The witnesses were also found to be inconsistent in their statements, making it difficult for the court to rely on their testimonies as evidence. 	+ PW-4, a police officer, testified about the investigation and the recovery of evidence. He stated that the police had received information about the occurrence and had reached the spot within 10 minutes, but the report was made after 10 minutes. He also stated that there was a gap of 10 minutes between the report made by the police and the spot, which made it impossible for the police to determine if the spot was occupied by the accused at the moment of the occurrence. 
+ CW-1, a constable, testified regarding the custody of the accused and the availability of witnesses. He admitted that there were no witnesses at the spot and that no empty shells were recovered from the place of occurrence. He further stated that no bullet marks were found on the places of occurrence, which raised doubts about the veracity of the complainant's testimony.  the report is also referred to as a ""Murasila"" (a report prepared by the Investigating Officer).

Bachazul Bakht at 21:00 hours, and appellant Muhammadullah was watching him. * Muhammadullah tried to open the door, but it was locked from inside, and he broke it with an axe at 00:30 hours. * The prosecution alleged that Muhammadullah and co-appellant Hanifullah murdered Lal Muhammad and his wife. * The case rested on last seen evidence, which was disputed by the court, as well as circumstantial evidence, which was deemed weak and unreliable.  "," The prosecution presented 10 witnesses, including the police officers who investigated the case, the doctor who conducted the post-mortem examination, and the family members of the victims.   * Sahib Zada (PW-1), the father of the deceased, introduced last seen evidence and stated that he and his son Lal Muhammad had gone to a mosque on the night of the occurrence. * Ismail, the brother of the deceased Bachazul Bakht, recorded a statement and charged both appellants for the murder. * Nazar Hussain (PW-9), the father of the deceased, stated that he joined the investigation after one month and one day after the occurrence.   * The prosecution's case relied heavily on the last seen evidence, which was reported late and lacked corroboration from an independent source. * The investigating agency failed to record statements from independent witnesses, including the inmates of the house, including children.  "," The trial court convicted the appellants under Section 302(b)/34 P.P.C and sentenced them to life imprisonment. The court also directed each convict to pay Rs. 200,000/- to the legal representatives of the deceased Mst. Bachazul Bakht and Rs. 200,000/- to the legal representatives of the deceased Lal Muhammad. The court held that the prosecution had proved its case against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt, and that the appellants had a common intention to commit the murders. The court also rejected the appellants' defense that the F.I.R was not proved and that the recovery of the crime weapons was doubtful.  The basis of the decision was the strong circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution, including the F.I.R, the recovery of the crime weapons, the last seen evidence, and the medical reports of the deceased. The court also relied on the testimony of the police officers and the family members of the victims.  The appeal was dismissed, and the conviction and sentence of the appellants were upheld.  * The Supreme Court of Pakistan dismissed the appeal and upheld the conviction of the appellants. * The court held that the FIR lodged by Muhammadullah was not admissible as evidence against him, as it was a previous statement and not a substantive piece of evidence. * The court also rejected the last seen evidence of Sahib Zada and Ismail, citing the delay in recording their statements and the lack of plausible explanation for the delay. * The court further held that the silence of the witnesses for 13/14 days after the occurrence was a striking aspect of the case, which had been overlooked by the trial court. * The court concluded that the prosecution failed to prove the guilt of the appellants beyond reasonable doubt and that the conviction was based on unreliable evidence.  **Section of Law Applied:**  * Article 38 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, which states that no confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence. * Sections 140 and 153 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, which relate to the admissibility of previous statements. * The Evidence Act, 1872, and the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, were also referred to in the judgment.  * The court disbelieved the prosecution's case due to the weak and unreliable evidence. * The court held that the prosecution failed to provide an unbroken chain of circumstantial evidence and that many links were missing. * The court also found that the FIR was based on an inadmissible statement made by Muhammadullah before the police, which was used to incriminate him. * The court acquitted Muhammadullah and his co-appellant due to the lack of sufficient evidence to prove their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. * The court emphasized the importance of providing solid evidence and the need to avoid convicting an accused person based on speculation or suspicion.

"," The judgment is based on the conviction and sentence awarded to Imran by the Military Court.

The Court held that the Military Court had jurisdiction to try Imran for the offenses charged, and that the conviction and sentence were not illegal or without jurisdiction. The Court also rejected the petitioner's contention that the Sun Set legislation had lapsed, and that the conviction was therefore invalid. The Court further held that the record of the Military Court proceedings was not open to public inspection, and that the petitioner's counsel was allowed to inspect the record under the supervision of the Court. The Court finally dismissed the petition, upholding the conviction and sentence of Imran.  **Basis of Decision:**  The basis of the decision is the Pakistan Army Act, 1952, as amended by the Pakistan Army (Amendment) Act, 2015, and the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. The Court applied the principles of judicial review, as laid down in the Supreme Court's judgment in Said Zaman Khan's case, and held that the Military Court had jurisdiction to try Imran for the offenses charged. The Court also relied on the judgments of the Supreme Court in Ghulam Nabi's case, Shamim Khan's case, and Muhammad Sadiq's case, to determine the scope of judicial review in the context of a challenge to a conviction and sentence awarded by a Military Court.  * The Constitutional Court found that the Military Court lacked legal jurisdiction to award the death penalty for the charges framed against Muhammad Imran. * The Court held that the sentence of death awarded to Muhammad Imran and the confirmation thereof passed by the Chief of Army Staff was set aside. * The case was remanded back to the Military Court to revisit the quantum of punishment awarded or to alter the charge framed against Muhammad Imran and proceed against him under the law. * The Court's decision was based on the fact that the Military Court's jurisdiction was limited to trying a civilian for a civil offense, and the charges against Muhammad Imran did not carry the capital punishment of death under the ordinary penal laws of Pakistan.

The prosecution also presented medical evidence to support the complainant's version of events.  No witnesses or their testimonies are mentioned or mentioned in this judgment.  The judgment does not provide a clear description of the crime scenario or the events leading up to and following the crime, and the witnesses who testified are not mentioned or shown to have provided sufficient evidence to establish the accused's involvement in the crime at the time of the incident. 
The crime scenario involves the murder of a person, allegedly committed by the accused. The FIR was registered under sections 302 (murder), 324 (attempt to murder), and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The charges against the accused were allegedly murder under section 302 PPC and section 15 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013.

" The appellant, Haris, is accused of murdering Abdullah, the son of Zahoor Khan, on June 26, 2019, at around 2035 hours.

The court found that Zahoor Khan was not an eyewitness to the occurrence and was a procured witness. The court also found that the recovery of the 30 bore pistol and ammunitions was not reliable, as the investigating officer did not associate any notable persons from the area during the raid and recovery proceedings. The court further found that the alleged crime empty of 30 bore was not sent to the FSL on the same day and was allegedly handed over by the investigating officer to the police station for safe custody.  **Final Judgment:**  The court acquitted Haris of the charges of murder and ordered his release from custody.  The court allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction and sentence of the appellant, and acquitted him of the charge of murder (section 302(b) PPC).

The complainant, Zulfiqar, who is the brother of the deceased, reported the incident to the police at around 9:30 am. The accused were charged with murder (Section 302 PPC) and attempted to murder (Section 34 PPC).

On November 26, 2010, a Kalashnikov and a 30 bore pistol were recovered from the possession of accused Allah Wasaya and Ehsanullah respectively. The appellant Allah Wasaya was produced to the local police by Inayat Khan on November 23, 2010, and was retained in the police station without a legal and lawful jurisdiction.

"," The appellants, Allah Wasaya and Ehsanullah, were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1,00,000 each, as well as six months' rigorous imprisonment in default of payment of the fine. The complainant, Zulfiqar, had filed a criminal revision petition (Cr.R.No.11-D/2012) to enhance the sentence, while the appellants had filed a criminal appeal (Cr.A.No.25-D/2012) to set aside their conviction and sentence.  The court held that the prosecution's case was not free from doubt, and the FIR was lodged after preliminary investigation and consultation. The court also doubted the presence of the complainant and other witnesses at the time of the occurrence. The confessional statements of the appellants were also found to be unreliable due to the manner in which they were recorded.  In view of the above, the court acquitted the appellants and ordered their release forthwith, if not required in any other case.

The State (PLD 1975 Supreme Court 187), and Muhammad Ismail Vs. The State (2017 SCMR 713).  The Court held that the prosecution failed to prove its case against the appellant Allah Wasaya. The recovery of the weapon of offence from the possession of the accused was doubtful and cannot be relied upon. The Court also noted that the crime empties were not sent to the laboratory immediately, which raised doubts about the recovery. The Court relied on several Supreme Court judgments, including Ghulam Akbar and another Vs. The State, Jehangir Vs. Nazer Farid and another, and Muhammad Younus Khan Vs. The State, to hold that the prosecution's evidence was not sufficient to dispel the doubt about the implication of innocent persons along with the guilty one.  The Court, therefore, accepted the appeal to the extent of the appellant Allah Wasaya, set aside the conviction and sentence recorded by the trial Court, and acquitted him from the charges levelled against him.

The appellant was also sentenced to five years' rigorous imprisonment for attempting to murder Azmat Ali and to pay compensation to the tune of Rs. 500,000 or in default, to suffer simple imprisonment for six months.  The High Court, however, reduced the sentence of death to imprisonment for life, taking into account the mitigating circumstances, including the absence of any previous motive between the appellant and the deceased, and the fact that the occurrence was a sudden and impulsive act without any pre-planning or pre-mediation. The court relied on the Supreme Court's judgments in ""ZAFAR IQBAL alias ZAFARULLAH KHAN vs. THE STATE"" and ""BAKHT MUNIR and another vs. THE STATE and another"" to support its decision.  The Peshawar High Court reduced the sentence of death awarded to the appellant to imprisonment for life under section 302(b) PPC. The court considered several mitigating circumstances, including: * The single stab blow, which was not repeated. * The appellant's presence at home after the occurrence, which showed an innocent character. * The fact that the deceased's Shalwar was not stained with blood or had a corresponding cut. * The absence of evidence linking the knife found on PW-15 to the commission of the offense.  The court applied the principle of considering mitigating circumstances for awarding a lesser penalty, as seen in previous Supreme Court cases. The sentence of death was reduced to imprisonment for life, and the rest of the convictions and sentences awarded to the appellant under section 324 PPC and section 337-D PPC were maintained.

However, their testimonies were disputed due to contradictions and inconsistencies.  No specific witnesses or their testimonies are mentioned in the judgment.  "," The court found that the prosecution failed to prove its case against Riaz due to several reasons:  1. The dying declaration of Sohail Shah was not strong evidence, as it was not tested through cross-examination. 2. The ocular account of Fawad Ali Shah and Samiullah was unreliable due to contradictions and inconsistencies in their statements. 3. The delay in lodging the report and the lack of plausible explanation for the delay raised doubts about the authenticity of the report. 4.

The judgment was based on the principles of criminal jurisprudence, which require strong, independent, and reliable evidence to sustain a conviction, particularly in a capital charge. The Supreme Court of Pakistan accepted the appeal of Riaz and set aside his conviction and sentence. The court found that the prosecution had failed to establish its charge against Riaz beyond a reasonable doubt and that the trial court had not properly appreciated the evidence on record. The court extended the benefit of doubt to Riaz and acquitted him from the charge levelled against him. He was ordered to be released forthwith if not required to be detained in any other case.

", There is no specific mention of witnesses in the judgment.  ," The court dismissed the bail petitions of the accused, Habibullah, Abbas Khan, and Hameed Khan. The court held that the mere acquittal of the co-accused does not entitle the accused to concession of bail. The court noted that the evidence recorded in the absence of the accused in the case of their acquitted co-accused cannot be taken into consideration, neither at the bail stage nor during trial. The court also distinguished the case from the Supreme Court judgment in ""Chairman NAB through PGA NAB Islamabad Vs Muhammad Khalid"" (2016 SCMR 676), where the co-accused were acquitted and the accused was granted bail due to the milder role in the offense.  The court further held that the accused remained absconders for a considerable long period and surrendered only after the acquittal of their co-accused. The court noted that granting bail to the accused solely due to the acquittal of their co-accused would encourage accused to remain fugitives from law during the disposal of the case of their co-accused.

The crime scenario involves a murder case where the deceased was shot and killed by the accused. The prosecution alleged that the accused was involved in the murder due to a previous blood feud between the parties.

However, the investigation was marred by several irregularities, including the failure to record the statement of the doctor who treated PW-9, the lack of a treatment chart from the hospital, and the absence of any witness to depose regarding the arrest of the accused.  "," The appellants, Muhammad Gulfam and Mst. Gul Mayo, were convicted by the learned Sessions Judge, Karak, for the murder of Mst. Maria Begum. The appellants were sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 2,00,000/-, with a further sentence of six months' simple imprisonment in default of payment of the fine.

The Court has also noted that the appellants' conduct during the investigation and trial was suspicious and raised doubts about their involvement in the crime.  The court ultimately acquitted Muhammad Gulfam and his co-accused of the charges, citing several irregularities in the investigation and the prosecution's failure to establish the presence of the witnesses at the scene of the crime.
