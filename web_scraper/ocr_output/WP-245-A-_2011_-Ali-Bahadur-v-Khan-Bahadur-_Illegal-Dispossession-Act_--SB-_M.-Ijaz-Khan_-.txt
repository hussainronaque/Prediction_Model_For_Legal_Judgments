JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD IJAZ KHAN, J.- Through the
instant petition filed under Article 199 of The
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan,
1973, the petitioner has challenged the judgment
of learned Additional Sessions Judge-IJ, Haripur
dated 24.03.2011 whereby the complaint filed by
the present petitioner was dismissed and

respondents No.1 and 2 were acquitted.

(Jamil) (SB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
2. Precisely, the facts of the case as per
contents of instant petition are that there was a
water-course (Kathi) and path situated in Khasra
No.828 which is the ownership of Mahazi Malkan
including the petitioner which was blocked by the
respondents No.l and 2. through raising
construction thereon after taking possession of the
same. In the wake, thereof the petitioner instituted
a complaint against them under section 3 of
Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 (hereinafter called
The Act of 2005). The learned trial court referred
the matter to the local police for inquiry and the
report was submitted accordingly. Thereafter the
respondents were summoned, charge was framed
and served upon them to which they pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial. In support of his case,
the complainant produced as many as five
witnesses. Thereafter, statements of acquitted
respondents were recorded under section 342
Cr.PC whereby they did not want to appear as
their own witness on oath under section 340(2)

Cr.PC, however, they produced defence

(Jamil) (SB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
evidence in shape of DW-1 (Muhammad Akhtar
SOK) and DW-2 (Muhammad Parvez Patwari
Halqa). After hearing arguments of both the
parties, the learned trial court dismissed the
petitioner’s complaint and acquitted the
respondents No.1 and 2 of the charges levelled
against them vide impugned order and judgment
dated 24.03.2011 which order and judgment has
now been challenged by the petitioner through
the instant petition.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for the
parties were heard in considerable and record
perused with their able assistance.

4. At the very outset, learned counsel for the
petitioner states that since the acquitted
respondent No.1 namely Khan Bahadur has died
during the pendency of this writ petition,
therefore, his complaint to bring home
punishment against the aforesaid acquitted
respondent would abate, however, the impugned

order could be set aside to the extent whereby

(Jamil) (SB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
even restoration of the disputed property has not
been ordered, therefore, for the restoration of the
possession of the disputed property within the
meaning of section 8 of The Act of 2005 the
instant case would proceed.

5. Learned counsel representing the acquitted
respondents states that once the accused/
respondent now dead was acquitted of the
criminal charge then even an order for restoration
of possession could not be made. In view of the
above controversy, the only question before this
Court was that as to whether after the death of
nominated accused who has been acquitted in the
complaint from criminal charge, an order for
restoration of possession could be made or not? In
order to dilate upon the legal proposition, it would
be relevant to reproduce below section 3 and

section 8 of The Act of 2005:

“3. Prevention of illegal possession of
property, etc

(1) No one shall enter into or upon any
property to dispossess, grab, control or
occupy it without having any lawful
authority to do so with the intention to
dispossess, grab, control or occupy the

(Jamil) (SB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
property from owners or occupier of
such property.

(2) Whoever contravenes the provisions
of the subsection (1) shall, without
prejudice to, any punishment to which
he may be liable under any other law for
the time being in force, be punishable
with imprisonment which may extend to
ten years and with fine and the victim of
the offence shall also be compensated in
accordance with the provision of section
544-A of the Code.

(3) Whoever forcibly and wrongfully
dispossesses any owner or occupier of
any property and his act does not fall
within subsection (1), shall be punished
with imprisonment which may extend to
three years or with fine or with both, in
addition to any other punishment to
which he may be liable under any other
law for the time being in force. The
person dispossessed shall also be
compensated in accordance’ with
provisions of section 544-A of the Code.

Section 8.

8. Delivery of possession of property to
owner, etc

(1) On conclusion of trial, if the Court
finds that an owner or occupier of the
property was illegally dispossessed or
property was grabbed in contravention

of section 3, the Court may, at the time
of passing order under sub-sections (2)
and (3) of that section, direct the accused
or any person claiming through him for
restoration of the possession of the

property to the owner or, as the case
may be, the occupier,if not already

restored to him under section 7.

(2) For the purpose of subsection (1), the
Court may, where it is required, direct
the officer-in-charge of the police station
for such assistance as may be required
for restoration of the possession of the
property to the owner or, as the case
may be, the occupier.

(Jamil) (SB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
The combined perusal of the aforesaid
provisions would show that for the criminal
charges if an accused person is proved to have
entered upon any property and has dispossessed
the owner/occupier from the same then he shall be
punished for a term as mentioned in subsection
(2) of section 3 of The Act of 2005. Similarly, an
accused person could also be convicted for a
sentence under subsection (3) of section 3 of The
Act of 2005 on the ground mentioned therein. The
plain and simple language of section 8 of The Act
of 2005 would also show that the Court who is
seized with the complaint under The Act of 2005
at the time of passing order under sub-sections (2)
and (3) of section 3 of The Act of 2005, may
direct the accused for restoration of the possession
of the property to the owner/occupier/
complainant, therefore, the combined effect of
both the above sections of law would be that if a
nominated accused is convicted under subsection
(2) or subsection (3) of section 3 of The Act of

2005 then in such an eventuality, Court would

(Jamil) (SB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
also restore possession to the complainant/ owner
and as against this if an accused person has not
been convicted and punished under section 3 of
The Act of 2005 then in such an eventuality an
order for restoration of possession of the property
could not be ordered. The words “at the time of
passing order under sub-sections (2) and (3) of
that section” and “direct the accused for
restoration of the possession of the property to
the owner” are of prime significance and they
clearly demonstrate the intention of the
Legislatures that the restoration of the possession
of property to the complainant/owner could only
be made if an accused person is convicted under
sub-sections (2) and (3) of section 3.

6. It is also relevant to mention here that
initially there was no provision regarding filing of
an appeal against an order passed by trial Court
either under subsection (2) or subsection (3) of
section 3 or an order passed under subsection (1)
of section 8 of The Act of 2005, however, through

an Act No.XXVIII of 2017, section 8-A was

(Jamil) (SB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
inserted in The Act of 2005 and the right of appeal
was provided to a person who has been convicted
and against whom an order for restoration of
possession has been passed. The said section of
law i.e. section 8-A being relevant in the present

controversy is also reproduced below:

“8-A. Appeal.- Any order made
under sub-section (2) and sub-
section (3) of section 3 and sub-
section (1) of section 8 shall, within
thirty days of the order, be appeal-
able before the High Court.”

The aforesaid section of law would

manifestly show that a word “and” has been used

between “Any order made under sub-section (2)
and “sub-section (3) of section 3” and “sub-

99

section (1) of section and as under the
established jurisprudence of interpretation of
statute the word “and” is always used as a

29

conjunctive, while “or” is used as disjunctive
which further supports the stance of learned
counsel for the accused/respondents _ that

conviction under subsection (2) or subsection (3)

of section 3 of The Act of 2005 is a condition

(Jamil) (SB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
precedent for passing an order under subsection
(1) of section 8 of The Act of 2005. In a case!
Supreme Court of Pakistan has observed that there
can be no escape from the fact that in common
parlance 'and' is used in the conjunctive sense,
while 'or' is employed in the disjunctive sense.

7. It is also by now settled jurisprudence that
where language of the Statute is clear and
unambiguous, the law enunciated therein should
be interpreted by assigning it the plain and
ordinary meaning. The Supreme Court of Pakistan
in recent cases’ has observed that when the intent

of the legislature is manifestly clear from the

wording of the statute, the rules of interpretation

require that such law be interpreted as it is by

assigning the ordinary English language and

usage to the words used, unless it causes grave

injustice which may be irremediable or leads to
absurd situations which could not have been

intended by the legislature. Only then, the Court

may see the mischief which the legislature sought
to remedy and interpret the law in a manner that
meets the intent of the legislature. We are
therefore of the view that the conclusion to this
effect reached by the High Court is quite
erroneous and unsustainable in law.
8. The question as to whether in absence of
any order of conviction under subsection (2) or
subsection (3) of section 3 of The Illegal
Dispossession Act, 2005 an order for restoration
of possession under subsection (1) of section 8 of
The Act of 2005 could be passed came before this
Court in the case of Syed Zanon Mian’ where para
No.6 being relevant is reproduced below:

“6. It is manifest from section 8 read

with subsections (2) and (3) of section 3

of the Act that the Court in case of

conviction of the accused can pass the

order for restoration of the property

but in the present case the learned trial

Court, after recording evidence in the

case, has acquitted the accused on one

hand and on the other hand has ordered

for restoration of possession of the land

to complainant. In other words,

conviction is sine qua non for handing

over the possession under section 8 of

the ibid Act. Thus, findings of the
learned trial Court are not in

(2022 YLR 2252)

(Jamil) (SB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
11

consonance with the above referred
provisions of the Act as well as section
367, Cr.P.C. requiring the Court to give
specific findings for determination of a
criminal controversy. So, the judgment
of the learned trial Court, being illegal,
is liable to be set aside.”

9. In view of the above, the answer to the
above question is that where an accused person
has been acquitted from the charges and no order
of conviction has been passed against him
under sub-sections (2) and (3) of section 3 of The
Act of 2005 then an order for restoration of the
property under subsection (1) of section 8 of the
ibid Act could not be passed.

10. Even otherwise, on merits of the case, the
instant complaint of the petitioner was liable to be
dismissed as the same was filed under The Illegal
Dispossession Act, 2005, which aims at to
safeguard and protect the private ownership/
possession of immovable property and not joint/
common ownership/occupation as the case in
hand where the subject property is admittedly
“Ghair Mumkin Kathi” (Khasra No.828) and as

per “Wajib-ul-Arz” for the year 1947-1948 the

(Jamil) (SB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
12

same would remain ownership-in-possession of
“Mahazi Malkan’” i.e. the petitioner and other co-
owners including the nominated accused to enjoy

their right of irrigation and right of way, and as

such the same cannot be claimed by the petitioner
as his exclusive ownership-cum-possession
entitling him to seek any remedy under The Act
of 2005, therefore, the learned trial court has
rightly dismissed complaint of the petitioner and
consequently acquitted the respondents No.1 and
2 of the charges levelled against them.

11. In view of above, this writ petition being
bereft of any merits is hereby dismissed. Needless

to mention that right of irrigation and right of way

attached to the subject property being “Ghair
Mumkin Kathi” and every violation thereof would
give rise to a fresh cause of action to all the co-
owners for redressal of their grievance(s) under

other relevant laws.
