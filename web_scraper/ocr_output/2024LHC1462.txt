For the State: General.

Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. — This appeal is directed against
the judgment dated 25.08.2022 delivered by the Additional Sessions
Judge, Chishtian, in case FIR No. 37/2021 dated 04.02.2021 registered
for an offence under section 377-B PPC at Police Station City

A-Division Chishtian, District Bahawalnagar.

2. On 04.02.2021, Complainant Muhammad Javaid (PW-1)
submitted a written application (Exh. PA) to Muhammad Aslam/SI
(PW-5). He stated that his son BJ. (name withheld to preserve
privacy), aged about 10 years, was a student of 4th Class in Evergreen
Public School in Mehboob Colony, Tehsil Chishtian. On 02.02.2021,
when B.J. returned from school, he was terrified and running a fever.
Upon inquiry, he began crying, and in the presence of Muhammad
Shabbir (PW-2), Muhammad Akram, and Muhammad Yasin, he stated

that he would no longer attend school because his Principal, Imdad

Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -2-

Ullah (the Appellant), called him daily into his office and molested
him. On the mentioned day, shortly before the school ended, the
Appellant summoned him to his office and, after bolting the door,
sexually abused him. BJ. further stated that the Appellant threatened
him with dire consequences and warned him not to tell anybody about
the incident. The Complainant requested that legal action be taken
against the Appellant for sexually abusing his child. Based on the said
application, FIR No. 37/2021 (Exh. PC) was registered.

3. Muhammad Aslam/SI (PW-5) investigated this case. On
5.2.2021, he arrested the Appellant. After completing the investigation,
he determined that he had committed the alleged offence. The report

under section 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted accordingly.

4. On 03.03.2021, the Additional Sessions Judge indicted the
Appellant, who denied the charge and claimed trial. The prosecution
examined five witnesses to prove its case. Complainant Muhammad
Javaid (PW-1), Muhammad Shabbir (PW-2), and BJ. (PW-3)
reaffirmed the contents of the application Exh. PA (and FIR
No.37/2021 Exh. PC). Dr. Muhammad Idrees (PW-4) provided
evidence regarding the Appellant’s medical fitness. The Investigating
Officer, Muhammad Aslam/SI (PW-5), gave the details of the
investigation and the evidence he collected in this case. The Deputy
District Public Prosecutor gave up PWs Muhammad Yaseen and
Muhammad Akram as unnecessary and closed the prosecution

evidence.

5. After the prosecution completed its evidence, the trial
court recorded the Appellant’s statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. and
confronted him with the incriminating material brought against him
during the trial. He refuted the allegations and professed innocence. He
maintained that the Chief Executive Officer (DEA), Bahawalnagar,
also found him innocent in an inquiry. Subsequently, the CEO issued

Letter No. 5745 dated 14.10.2021, confirming that no immoral activity
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -3-

was discovered in the Evergreen School owned by the Appellant. When
asked why this case was registered against him and why the PWs

deposed against him, the Appellant replied:

“Complainant and PWs deposed falsely against me and a false case
was registered against me in connivance with my ex-in-laws because
I have divorced my ex-wife namely Naseem Kousar d/o Iam-ud-
Din caste Malik r/o 69-ED Tehsil Arif-wala, District Pakpattan, and
I handed over dowry articles to her family on 24-01-2021. After a
few days, my ex-in-laws, due to the grudge of my divorce, registered
the instant false FIR against me in connivance with complainant and
police because my ex-in-laws have a deep relationship with the
complainant. So, in connivance and being in league with each other,
they registered this false case against me.”

6. The Appellant neither opted to make a statement on oath
under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor examined any witness in his defence.
However, he tendered in evidence the Certificate dated 14.10.2021
issued by the Chief Executive Officer (DEO), Bahawalnagar (Exh. DA)
and a copy of the divorce deed (Mark-A).

7. On the conclusion of the trial, vide judgment dated
25.08.2022, the Additional Sessions Judge convicted the Appellant
under section 377-B PPC and sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment
for fourteen years with a fine of Rs.1,000,000/- and, in default thereof,
to undergo simple imprisonment for further six months. The benefit of

section 382-B Cr.P.C. was extended to him. Hence, this appeal.

8. In support of this appeal, Mirza Muhammad Nadeem Asif,
Advocate, argued that the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act,
2021 (the “2021 Act”), enacted on 4.12.2021, established Special
Courts by section 3 to try the scheduled offences. The Additional
Sessions Judge, who delivered the impugned judgment dated
25.8.2022, was not a Special Court constituted/notified under the 2021
Act. Consequently, the said judgment was without jurisdiction. On the
case’s merit, Mr. Mirza contended that the FIR was lodged with
inexplicable delay, which impinged upon its credibility. He maintained
that the Appellant was innocent. The Complainant had lodged a false
case against him at the behest of his ex-wife, Naseem Kausar, and her

parents. Mr. Mirza further argued that Complainant Muhammad Javaid
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -4-

(PW-1) and Muhammad Shabbir (PW-2) were not eyewitnesses to any
wrongdoing by the Appellant. The prosecution had planted them to
bolster its fabricated case. Regarding BJ.’s testimony, Mr. Mirza
contended that it was inadmissible because the Additional Sessions
Judge failed to assess his competence through the voir dire test. The
counsel further argued that even if BJ.’s testimony was admissible
without the said test, the Appellant could not be convicted on its basis
due to the lack of corroboration. He prayed that the Criminal Appeal
No. 448/2022 be accepted and the Appellant be acquitted of the charge.

9. The Deputy Prosecutor General, assisted by the
Complainant’s counsel, controverted the above contentions. He argued
that the Additional Sessions Judge presiding over the Appellant’s trial
was duly notified as a Special Court under the 2021 Act. The
Appellant’s objection that the impugned judgment dated 25.8.2022 was
without jurisdiction was misconceived and had no legal foundation. On
the merits of the case, the Deputy Prosecutor General contended that
the prosecution proved its case to the hilt. The victim, BJ., fully
supported the prosecution case and withstood cross-examination with
intelligence. Complainant Muhammad Javaid (PW-1) and Muhammad
Shabbir (PW-2) corroborated B.J. on all crucial points. According to
him, BJ.’s testimony was not vitiated merely because the Additional
Sessions Judge did not carry out the voir dire test. The Appellant had
not adduced any evidence suggesting that the FIR against him was
mala fide. The contention that he has been falsely implicated in this
case at the instigation of his ex-wife Nasreen Kausar and her parents

was implausible. He prayed for the dismissal of the Appellant’s appeal.

10. We heard the learned counsel and examined the record

with their assistance.

11. The prosecution alleges that the Appellant habitually
molested B.J. but the present case centres on the incident of 2.2.2021.
During this episode, it claims, the Appellant summoned B.J. to his

office, locked the door, and subjected him to sexual abuse. The boy
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -5-

disclosed this to his father, Muhammad Javaid (PW-1), in the presence
of Muhammad Shabbir (PW-2) and two others. The incident was
reported to the police at 4:20 pm. on 4.2.2021 upon which FIR
No.37/2021 (Exh. PC) was registered. The Additional Sessions Judge,
Chishtian, indicted him on 3.3.2021 for an offence under section 377-B
PPC.

12. Parliament has enacted the Anti-Rape (Investigation and
Trial) Act, 2021 to ensure expeditious redressal of rape and sexual
abuse crimes in respect of women and children through special
investigation teams and special courts providing for efficacious
procedures, speedy trial, evidence and incidental matters.’ It was
published in the Gazette of Pakistan on 4.12.2021 and extends to the
entire country. However, section 1(3) of the 2021 Act stipulates that it
shall come into force on a date the Federal Government may appoint.
Section 3(1) provides that the Federal Government, in consultation with
the Chief Justice of the High Court concerned, shall establish as many
Special Courts throughout the country, as it may deem necessary, to try
the scheduled offences. Section 3(3) states that, in addition to or in lieu
of the establishment of Special Courts under section 3(1), the Federal
Government may, in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High
Court concerned, designate as many courts of Additional Sessions
Judges or such other courts as Special Courts, as it may deem fit. The
proviso to section 3(3) adds that where gender-based violence (GBV)
courts, juvenile courts or child protection courts have already been
designated, they shall be deemed to be the Special Courts under this
Act. Section 18 states that any person aggrieved by the final judgment
of a Special Court may file an appeal to the High Court in whose
jurisdiction the Special Court which rendered the judgment is situated.

A Division Bench of the High Court decides such an appeal.

13. Section 23 of the 2021 Act stipulates that the Special

Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to try the scheduled offences.

' Preamble of the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act, 2021
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -6-

Once the Act comes into effect, any ongoing trial of scheduled offences
in any other court will be automatically transferred to the Special Court
having jurisdiction under the Act. The Special Court will then proceed
with the case from the point at which it was pending immediately
before the transfer. Section 377-B PPC is one of the scheduled offences
under the 2021 Act.

14. The Federal Government, while exercising powers under
section 3(3) of the 2021 Act, designated Mr. Muhammad Nawaz Bhatti,
Additional District & Sessions Judge, Chishtian, as Special Court vide
notification dated 11.5.2022.

15. Mr. Zafar Iqbal Tarar, Additional Sessions Judge,
conducted the Appellant’s trial. He recorded the prosecution evidence
and the Appellant’s statement under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. He fixed
the case for final arguments but, in the meantime, the notification dated
15.5.2022 was issued. Thereupon, the case was transferred to Mr.
Muhammad Nawaz Bhatti. He heard the parties and delivered the
impugned judgment dated 25.8.2022 as the Special Court designated

under section 3(3) of the Act.

16. Mr. Mirza, the Appellant’s counsel, does not dispute the
above facts. His objection to the impugned judgment is based on the
fact that Mr. Bhatti did not mention his designation as the Special Court
when signing it. This objection is overly technical because Mr. Bhatti
was duly notified and had jurisdiction in the matter. His failure to
explicitly write “Special Court” under his signature has no legal
consequence. In Piao Gul v. The State [PLD 1960 SC (Pak) 307], the
trial for offences under section 8 of the North-West Frontier Province
Corps Law, 1941, could only be competently conducted before a Court
of Session, and for the Khyber Agency, the Court of the Political Agent
served as such a court. Mr. Faridullah Shah conducted Piao Gul’s trial
in his capacity as a Court of Session under the Criminal Procedure
Code, 1898, as applied to the Khyber Agency. However, he described

himself as a District Magistrate while framing the charge. The Supreme
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -7-

Court of Pakistan ruled that as long as the person conducting the
proceedings had the jurisdiction, any misdescription would not affect
the legality of the trial. In Muhammad Ramzan v. Mst. Khalida
Parveen (PLD 1971 Lahore 813), the Senior Civil Judge and the
Additional District Judge, Sheikhupura, disposed of the suit and the
appeal, respectively, as an ordinary civil suit and appeal. The appellant
argued that the trial Judge, Malik Mushtaq Ahmed, incorrectly
designated himself as the “Senior Civil Judge, Sheikhupura,” instead of
“Judge, Family Court, Sheikhupura.” Subsequently, while deciding the
appeal, the Additional District Judge referred to the trial court as the
“Civil Judge” instead of the “Judge, Family Court.” The appellant
argued that the matter had all along been treated as one governed by the
Civil Procedure Code and urged the High Court to treat the case filed
before it as a Second Appeal under section 100 of the Code. The High
Court rejected this argument, holding that the validity of a judgment or
order depends on whether the court had jurisdiction, not on the fact that
the court in question misdescribed itself or put an incorrect designation
under its orders. Further reference may be made to Allah Jiwaya v.
Judge Family Court and another (1990 MLD 239), and Matiullah v.
Mst. Saddigqa (2017 MLD 1871).

17. In view of the above, the impugned judgment dated
25.8.2022 rendered by Mr. Bhatti is to be reckoned as that of the
Special Court under the 2021 Act. The Appellant’s objection in this
respect is rejected. It is also essential to highlight that this appeal has
been categorized and treated as an appeal under section 18 of the Act,
which is why it has been referred to a Division Bench of this Court for

adjudication.

18. Now, we delve into the merits of the case. Mr. Mirza has
taken a strong exception to the fact that Muhammad Javaid (PW-1)
lodged the FIR with a delay of two days and wants us to throw out the
prosecution case on this ground alone. We must not do so. While the
law generally encourages prompt reporting of crimes, courts recognize

that child abuse is a sensitive issue. Several factors can contribute to
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -8-

delays in reporting child sexual abuse, including fear, shame, threats
from the perpetrator, or a lack of awareness. Hence, the courts in our
country do not consider the delay in making a report to the police
material? unless the circumstances are such that they warrant an
adverse view.’ The legal system aims to balance the need to protect
children from abuse with the principles of fairness and due process. In
the present case, the Appellant has not referred us to any circumstance
which may require us to take an adverse view against the prosecution

because of the delay.

19. The victim, BJ., who testified as PW-3, is the key
prosecution witness. In his examination-in-chief, he reiterated the
allegations levelled against the Appellant in the application Exh.PA and
FIR No.37/2021 Exh. PC. Mr. Mirza’s primary contention is that the
trial judge recorded his testimony without the voir dire test which,
according to him, was mandatory. Consequently, he claims that his
testimony is inadmissible. This raises the following two questions for
this Court’s determination: first, whether the voir dire test is mandatory
to assess the competency of a child witness and whether his testimony
is inadmissible without it. Second, whether an individual can be
convicted on the basis of solitary uncorroborated testimony of a child
who is a victim of sexual abuse. We shall answer these questions

seriatim.

20. In R v. DAI [2012] 2 LRC 633, the Supreme Court of
Canada distinguished between three often conflated distinct concepts:
(i) the competence of the witness to testify, (11) admissibility of their
evidence, and (iii) the weight of the testimony (its evidentiary value).
The rules governing these concepts share a common objective: to
ensure that convictions are based on reliable evidence and that the
accused receives a fair trial. Competence pertains to whether a
proposed witness has the capacity to provide evidence in court. The

purpose of this principle is to exclude worthless testimony at the outset

2 Zahid v. The State (2022 SCMR 50), Irfan Ali Sher v. The State (PLD 2020 SC 295).
> Mubeen Ahmed v. The State and another (PLD 2021 Islamabad 431).
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -9-

on the grounds that the witness lacks the fundamental capacity to
communicate evidence. Competence is a threshold requirement.
Although it is presumed in witnesses as a matter of course, it may be
challenged in cases involving children and adults with mental
disabilities. The second concept is admissibility, determining which
evidence from a competent witness can be received in the court record.
Admissible evidence must be relevant and not subject to exclusionary
rules. Admissibility rules aim to enhance the accuracy of fact-finding,
respect policy considerations, and ensure trial fairness. The third
concept involves the responsibility of the trier of fact to decide whether
to accept evidence, assuming the witness is competent and
admissibility rules are followed. The judge or jury evaluates factors like
demeanour, internal consistency, and consistency with other evidence
to determine acceptance. Conviction requires the prosecution to

establish all elements of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.

21. In R. v. Marguard [1993] 4 R.C.S. 223, Justice
McLachlin from the Canadian Supreme Court meticulously described
the standards for evaluating the competency of a child witness. She
elucidated that the assessment of testimonial competence encompasses
three key aspects: (a) the capacity to observe (including interpretation),
(b) the capacity to recollect, and (c) the capacity to communicate. The
judge must ensure that the witness possesses these capacities by
determining whether the witness can observe, remember, and
communicate the events. The focus is on assessing the minimum
threshold for the evidence to be receivable, not its credibility.
McLachlin J. emphasized that the inquiry is into the capacity to
perceive, recollect, and communicate, not whether the witness actually
perceived, recollects and can communicate about the events. Generally,
a witness’s performance during the trial provides the most reliable
measure of their capacity, and according to common law, a witness
demonstrating the ability to testify is permitted to do so. McLachlin J.
stated that there is no need to establish in advance that a child perceives

and remembers the precise events under consideration in the trial as a
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -10-

prerequisite for admitting their testimony. This requirement does not
apply to adult witnesses and should not be imposed on children.
McLachlin J. clarified that the test she introduced was not founded on
assumptions about the incompetency of children as witnesses, nor was
it intended to make it difficult for children to testify. Instead, the test
outlined the essential abilities that individuals, including children, must
possess to testify. Once this capability is established, any deficiencies
in the witness’s perception or recollection of events can be addressed as

factors affecting the weight of the evidence.

22. In Pakistan, the competency of a witness is determined
under Articles 3 and 17 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 (“QSO”),*
while the credibility of a witness is a question of fact which the court
decides following the principles settled for the appraisal of evidence.
Article 3 of the QSO does not explicitly specify any particular age
qualification for a witness. Before the enactment of QSO, Pakistan
followed the Evidence Act of 1872, which is still in force in India with
certain modifications. The 1872 Act has similarities with the QSO,

especially regarding the underlying assumptions, basic concepts, and

* Article 3 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 provides:

3. Who may testify. All persons shall be competent to testify unless the Court
considers that they are prevented from understanding the questions put to them, or from
giving rational answers to those questions, by tender years, extreme old age, disease,
whether of body or mind, or any other cause of the same kind:

Provided that a person shall not be competent to testify if he has been convicted
by a Court for perjury or giving false evidence;

Provided further that the provisions of the first proviso shall not apply to a person
about whom the Court is satisfied that he has repented thereafter and mended his ways;

Provided further that the Court shall determine the competence of a witness in
accordance with the qualifications prescribed by the injunctions of Islam as laid down in
the Holy Quran and Sunnah for witness, and, where such witness is not forthcoming, the
Court may take the evidence of a witness who may be available.

Article 17 reads as follows:

Io Competence and number of witness. — (1) The competence of a person to
testify, and the number of witnesses required in any case shall be determined in accordance
with the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Holy Quran and Sunnah.

(2) Unless otherwise provided in nay law relating to the enforcement of Hudood or
any other special law,

(a) in matters pertaining to financial or future obligations, if reduced to writing, the
instrument shall be attested by two men, or one man and two women, so that one
may remind the other, if necessary and evidence shall be led accordingly; and

(b) in all other matters, the Court may accept, or act on, the testimony of one man or
one woman or such other evidence as the circumstances of the case may warrant.
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -l1-

terminology. Section 118 of that Act resembles Article 3 of the QSO,
minus the provisos. The legal principles established in India and the
pre-QSO Pakistan regarding section 118 of the 1872 Act provide

valuable insights into understanding Article 3.

23. Under Article 3 of the QSO, a child is competent to be a
witness if he possesses the capacity and intelligence to understand and
respond rationally to questions — a criterion known as the “voir dire
test.”° In certain jurisdictions, specific guidelines and procedures exist
for evaluating a child’s competency to testify. In R. v. DAI, [2012] 2
LRC 633, while considering section 16 of the Canada Evidence Act,
the Supreme Court of Canada provided guidelines concerning
witnesses with challenged mental capacity. These guidelines, which are
also applicable to child witnesses, include: (i) The voir dire on a
proposed witness’s competence is an independent inquiry and should
not be combined with other issues, such as the admissibility of their
out-of-court statements. (ii) The voir dire should be brief and it is
preferable to consider all available relevant evidence before precluding
a witness from testifying. A witness should not be found incompetent
hastily. (ii) The primary source of evidence for a witness’s competence
is the witness himself. Their examination should be permitted, with
special consideration and accommodation for adults with mental
disabilities, ensuring that questions are phrased patiently in a clear and
simple manner. (iv) Individuals familiar with the proposed witness and
their everyday situation, often from their surroundings, may be called
as fact witnesses as they are the best sources of evidence on their
development. (v) Expert evidence may be produced if it meets
admissibility criteria, with a preference for experts having personal and
regular contact with the proposed witness. (vi) During the voir dire on
competence, the trial judge must inquire whether the proposed witness
understands the nature of an oath or affirmation and can effectively

communicate the evidence. (vii) The second inquiry into the witness’s

> Under this test the court puts certain preliminary questions before the child which have no
connection with the case, in order to know the competency of the child witness.
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -12-

ability to communicate evidence requires the trial judge to explore
whether the witness can relate concrete events, understand and respond
to questions, and differentiate between true and false everyday factual
statements. (viii) If the witness passes both parts of the test, they testify
under oath or affirmation; if they pass only the second part, they

promise to tell the truth.°

24. Satisfaction of the court in terms of Article 3 of the QSO is
not a mere procedural formality but a legal obligation. Hence, it must

be discharged with utmost care and caution. In Raja Khurram Ali

Khan and others v. Tayyaba Bibi and another (PLD 2020 SC 146),
the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that the “rationality test’ which

the presiding Judge applies at the start of a child witness’s examination-
in-chief, should extend throughout his entire testimony. The Supreme

Court approvingly cited Marquard and added:

“This threshold has been referred to as passing the ‘rationality test’
and the practice that has developed with time in our jurisdiction is
for the same to be carried out by a presiding Judge prior to recording
the evidence of the child witness ... the ‘rationality test’, which is
applied by the presiding Judge at the commencement of the
examination-in-chief of a child witness, should be made applicable
throughout the testimony of the child witness. If at any stage, the
presiding Judge observes any hindrance or reluctance in the
narration of events, the evidence should be stopped, and remedial
measures should be taken to ease the stress and anxiety the child
witness might be under, and if required, the case be adjourned to
another date. And further, in case the child witness is still unable to
narrate his testimony with ease, then the presiding Judge ought to
record his findings on the demeanour of the child witness, conclude
his evidence, and relieve him as a witness.”

25. Courts have considered the issue of whether an
omission by the judge or a magistrate to conduct a preliminary
examination of a child witness would, by itself, render his evidence
inadmissible in various cases. In Rameshwar v. The State of Rajasthan
(AIR 1952 SC 54), the trial judge certified that the witness did not
understand the nature of an oath and did not administer one. Despite

this, he took her evidence without any objection from the accused. The

® Section 6 of the Canada Evidence Act requires the trial court to inquire (a) whether the proposed
witness understands the nature of an oath or affirmation, and (b) whether he can communicate the
evidence. For this reason, R. v. DAI and R. v. Marquard make this inquiry an essential part of the
voir dire test. Article 3 of the QSO in Pakistan does not expressly mandate inquiry on the first issue.
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -13-

Supreme Court of India underscored the importance of judges and
magistrates recording their opinions regarding the  child’s
comprehension of the duty to speak the truth and provide reasons
therefor. However, it clarified that the absence of a formal certificate
does not automatically reduce the witness’s credibility. In this specific
case, considering the circumstances of the case and the lack of
objection by the accused, the Supreme Court concluded that the child

witness was competent, and her evidence was admissible.

26. In State of Orissa_v. Machindra Majhi and another
(AIR 1964 Ori 100), while considering section 118 of the Indian

Evidence Act 1872, the Orissa High Court ruled that the said provision
allows all individuals to testify unless the court determines they are
incapable of understanding or responding rationally to questions due to
factors like tender years, extreme old age, disease, or other similar
causes. The section is framed negatively, indicating that if the court
deems a witness incapable of comprehension and rational responses,
their evidence will not be accepted. Although there is no specific legal
provision mandating preliminary questions to test a child witness’s
capacity to testify, it is often regarded as prudent practice. The object of
such preliminary questioning is not to legalize the evidence but to save
the court time, ensuring it does not proceed further if satisfied that the
child is not a competent witness. The court can gauge the child’s
capacity through the evidence itself and its manner of delivery. If
satisfied, there is nothing illegal in directly recording the evidence

without resorting to preliminary questions.

27. In State of Maharashtra _v. Prabhu Barku Gade
(1995 Cri LJ 1432), the trial judge neglected to document the questions
put to the child victim before recording her testimony and only took
down her answers. It was contended that the trial judge’s preliminary
examination to assess the child’s comprehension was perfunctory. A
Division Bench of the Bombay High Court held that no legal or
procedural rule considers such an omission as introducing an infirmity

that would render the evidence unacceptable. The Court cited a
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -14-

previous decision, which held that it is “always desirable” to record the

questions, but it is not an absolute requirement.

28. In Khalil v. The State (PLD 1956 Lah 840), the trial judge
did not document the questions, if any, he might have asked the two
child witnesses to satisfy himself that they were intelligent enough to
understand what they were testifying about. After recording the name,
parentage, and address of each child witness, he examined them under
solemn affirmation, with a note that they appeared to him
“fairly” intelligent and capable of making a rational statement. Shabir
Ahmad, J. stated that the trial judge has no legal obligation to record
specific questions testing the child’s intelligence before taking down
their statement. While it is desirable to ask the child simple and
ordinary questions and record a brief proceeding so that the appellate
court may feel satisfied with his capacity to give evidence, failing to
follow such a course does not render the child’s evidence defective. In
a separate note, Abdul Aziz Khan, J. emphasized the importance of
recording questions and answers during the testimony of child
witnesses to assess their capacity. He stated that although there is no
specific legal provision mandating such documentation, the absence of
it leaves the appellate court uninformed about the child’s testifying
ability and it has to rely exclusively on the trial court’s judgment. On
the other hand, recording these interactions enables the appellate court
to independently evaluate the trial court’s justification in accepting or
rejecting the child witness’s evidence. Therefore, His Lordship
suggested that the courts examining child witnesses should adhere to
the prudent rule. This thought was echoed in Muhammad Ramzan

alias Jana v. The State (1968 PCr.LJ 392).

29. In Abdul Ghani and others v. The State (PLD 1959 Dacca
944), a Division Bench of the Dacca High Court ruled that it is not
obligatory for the court to undertake a preliminary examination of a
child witness before admitting their evidence. The court can gauge the
child’s ability to understand and respond coherently while providing

testimony. Even though the testimony is admissible without a
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -15-

preliminary examination, the court is encouraged to conduct one

because it would save time if it finds the witness incompetent.

30. In Muhammad Ilyas _v. Kabir Hussain and another
(2003 YLR 806), the trial court did not explicitly comment on the

witness’s competency. However, the statement indicated the witness’s
understanding of questions and ability to answer, suggesting
competency. The High Court ruled that the minor girl’s testimony
should not be discarded merely because the trial court did not inquire
about her fitness, emphasizing that a preliminary inquiry is a prudent

practice, not a legal obligation.

31. In The State v. Muhammad Boota (2014 YLR 306), the
trial court asked PW Gull Bano questions and was satisfied with her
understanding and rational answers, and documented this satisfaction
before recording her statement. During cross-examination, Gull Bano
responded logically. A Division Bench of the High Court repelled the
defence counsel’s contention that the trial court erred by not
transcribing the questions into writing. It emphasized that the sole

requirement is the court’s satisfaction.

32. In Iftikhar Ali v. The State (2022 PCr.LJ 1396), a
Division Bench held that while Article 3 of the QSO does not outline a
specific procedure for assessing a witness’s competence before
administering an oath, the practice is generally followed for very young
and elderly witnesses. However, the court emphasized that this practice
should not be viewed as a statutory barrier, and a child witness’s
deposition should not be excluded if they were not subjected to

questions confirming their competency before being sworn in.

33. The Sindh High Court took a somewhat different view in
Bashir Ahmed v. The State (PLD 1979 Karachi 147). It ruled that
before examining a child witness, the trial judge must determine their
competency by posing simple questions. If satisfied, the judge can
proceed with recording evidence. Otherwise, the examination should be

declined. The issue of administering an oath can be addressed
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -16-

separately. If a mature child provides rational answers but does not
understand the oath, evidence can be recorded without administering
the oath. Failure to conduct such an inquiry and make determinations

may render the witness’s testimony unreliable.

34. Analysis of the above-cited cases shows that the essential
requirement for a child, or any individual, to appear and testify as a
witness is that they should have the ability and intelligence to
comprehend the posed questions and furnish coherent responses. There
is a preponderance of opinion that the testimony of a child witness
cannot be discarded merely because the trial judge did not carry out a
voir dire test. Although it is advisable for the trial judge to meticulously
document the questions and corresponding answers to ensure that the
child understands the duty to speak the truth, the lack of such
documentation or the trial judge’s omission to opine on the child’s

competency does not render the testimony inadmissible.

35. At this stage, we must refer to the case of Muhammad
Mansha v. The State (2019 SCMR 64). One of the grounds for the
Supreme Court of Pakistan to acquit the accused was the trial court’s
failure to determine the witness’s comprehension level. In this case, the
sole prosecution eyewitness was deaf and dumb. The record did not
indicate how the trial court verified the proficiency of the individual
interpreting the signals of the witness during testimony, ensuring that
he was indeed “well versed in the language of signals”. The role of the
said individual was also ambiguous. It was unclear whether he acted as
a translator or an expert under Article 59 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat.
Furthermore, the trial court did not administer an oath to him, and
lastly, there was a conflict of interest as he was inimical towards the
accused. These details highlight that Muhammad Mansha’s case is
distinguished by its unique facts and cannot be cited to argue that it
holds a viewpoint different from our conclusions in the preceding

paragraph.
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -17-

36. Proceeding further, let’s address the second question: Can
an accused be convicted on the basis of solitary uncorroborated
testimony of a child who is a victim of sexual abuse? However, before
doing so, we must examine the status of a child’s testimony. In

Vetrovec v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 81, Dickson J. stated:

“Because of the infinite range of circumstances which will arise in
the criminal trial process, it is not sensible to attempt to compress
into a rule, a formula, or a direction the concept of the need for
prudent scrutiny of the testimony of any witness. What may be
appropriate, however, in some circumstances, is a clear and sharp
warning to attract the attention of the juror to the risks of adopting
without more, the evidence of the witness. There is no magic in the
word corroboration, or indeed in any other comparable expression
such as confirmation and support. The idea implied in those words
may, however, in an appropriate case, be effectively and efficiently
transmitted to the mind of the trier of fact.”

37. In Rv. W. (R.), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122, the Supreme Court of
Canada warned against applying negative stereotypes to children’s
evidence. At the same time, it emphasized on p.134 that the trier of fact

must be mindful of the weaknesses of a particular piece of evidence:

“Protecting the liberty of the accused and guarding against the injustice of
the conviction of an innocent person requires a solid foundation for a
verdict of guilt, whether the complainant be an adult or a child. What the
changes [in the way the courts look at evidence of children] do mean is
that we approach the evidence of children not from the perspective of
rigid stereotypes, but on what Wilson J. called a ‘common sense’ basis,
taking into account the strengths and weaknesses which characterize the
evidence offered in the particular case.”

38. Here, we may refer to Abdullah Khan v. The Queen,
[1990] 2 R.C.S. 531. The accused was a physician who was charged

with sexually assaulting a 34-year-old girl in his office. The trial judge
rejected the girl’s testimony because of her immaturity and it was one
of the main grounds for acquitting him. The Supreme Court of Canada
ruled that the judge erred by giving excessive importance to the child’s
tender age and creating a distinction between young and older children.

It stated:

“The trial judge also erred in placing critical weight on the child’s
young age. The Act makes no distinction between children of different
ages. The trial judge, in effect, found that T. met the two requirements
for permitting a child to testify under s. 16, but, emphasizing her
immaturity, rejected her evidence. He found that T. had sufficient
intelligence, and conceded that she ‘seemed to be aware at least of the
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -18-

consequences of telling a lie.” Having found that the two requirements
for reception of the evidence under s. 16 had been fulfilled, the trial
judge erred in letting himself be swayed by the young age of the child.
Were that a determinative consideration, there would be danger that
offences against very young children could never be prosecuted.”

39. In Rameshwar v. The State of Rajasthan (AIR 1952 SC
54), the Supreme Court of India took notice of the divergent views on

the need for corroboration in the testimony of adult women compared.
to children. The Court stressed that in every such case, the judge should
bear in mind the rule concerning the advisability of corroboration. In
jury trials, he must convey this rule to the jury, while in non-jury cases,
he should show that it is present in his mind by indicating that in his
judgment. The Supreme Court clarified that corroboration may be
dispensed if the judge or the jury is satisfied that it is safe to do so in
the particular circumstances of the case. The child’s tender years and
other circumstances appearing in the case, such as demeanour and the

unlikelihood of tutoring, may render corroboration unnecessary.

40. In Dattu_Ramrao_ Sakhare and others v. State of
Maharashtra [(1997) 5 SCC 341], the Supreme Court of India held
that the testimony of a child witness, if considered competent and
reliable, could serve as a basis for a conviction. Even without an oath, a
child’s testimony might be admissible under section 118 of the
Evidence Act as long as he can comprehend the questions and respond
rationally. The credibility of a child witness and their testimony hinges
on the specific circumstances of each case. When evaluating the
evidence of a child witness, the court should exercise caution, ensuring
that the witness is trustworthy, exhibits a demeanour similar to any

competent witness, and shows no signs of being coached.

41. In Panchhi and others v. State of U.P. [1998 (7) SCC
177], the Supreme Court of India stated that the court should not
summarily reject the testimony of a child. Instead, it should evaluate
the same carefully and cautiously because children can easily be

influenced by what others tell them and are susceptible to tutoring. The
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -19-

court’s responsibility lies in determining whether the child’s statement

is a genuine and voluntary expression, free from external influences.

42. In Ratansingh Dalsukhbhai Nayak v. State of Gujarat
[(2004) 1 SCC 64], the Supreme Court of India emphasized that the

determination of whether a child witness possesses sufficient
intelligence primarily falls within the domain of the trial judge. He is
expected to assess the child’s demeanour and apparent level of
intelligence. He may employ any examination method to determine the
child’s capacity, intelligence, and understanding of the obligation of
oath. While the trial court’s decision is typically respected, a higher
court may intervene if it becomes evident from the records that the
conclusion was flawed. This precaution is necessary because child
witnesses can be easily influenced and often inhabit a world of
imagination. Despite the acknowledged risk that child witnesses can be
malleable and susceptible to external influences, the established
principle is that if, upon scrutiny, the court finds a genuine ring of truth

in their testimony, there is no impediment in accepting it.

43. In our country, the courts are somewhat hesitant and
cautious in accepting the testimony of a child witness as a safe piece of
evidence. In Muhammad Afzal v. The State [PLD 1957 (W.P.) Lahore
788], this Court held that each case depends on its unique facts, and it
cannot be stipulated as a universal rule that the evidence of a child
witness should never be believed. It emphasized that the evidence of a
child witness should be subjected to close and careful scrutiny before

being acted upon.

44. In Ulfat Hussain v. The State (2010 SCMR 247), the
Supreme Court of Pakistan stated that while, in principle, a conviction
can be based on the testimony of an intelligent and understanding child
witness, the courts have generally preferred to follow the established
principles of prudence and the cautious approach associated with the

sole testimony of a child witness, regardless of the child’s intelligent
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -20 -

disposition. The Supreme Court emphasized that the degree of

prudence or care exercised depends on the specific facts of each case.

45. In State through Advocate General Sindh yv. Farman
Hussain and others (PLD 1995 SC 1), the Supreme Court of Pakistan,

by a majority decision, while dilating upon the competence and

evidential value of a child witness, opined:

“Evidence of child witness is a delicate matter and normally it is not
safe to rely upon it unless corroborated. It is a rule of prudence.
Great care is to be taken that in the evidence of child element of
coaching is not involved. Children are a most untrustworthy class of
witnesses, for, being of tender age, they often mistake dreams for
reality, repeat glibly as of their own knowledge what they have
heard from others and are greatly influenced by fear of punishment,
by hope of reward and by desire of notoriety. In any case the rule of
prudence requires that the testimony of child witness should not be
relied upon unless it is corroborated by some evidence on the
record.”

46. Child abuse is one of the most challenging crimes to detect
and prosecute primarily because there often are no witnesses except the
victim. It becomes more difficult when the perpetrator is a parent or a
close family member. The child may feel afraid, burdened by guilt, and
may be hesitant to disclose the abuse to others. Due to these
complexities, the courts deal with these cases with extra care and
special attention. In Bashir Ahmed v. The State (PLD 1979 Karachi
147), the Sindh High Court held that the rule as to corroboration is one
for the guidance of the courts and is not a rigid rule of law. Where the
prosecutrix is a minor girl and has been the victim of outrage, she
cannot be regarded as an accomplice, and her testimony should be
evaluated according to the ordinary principles which stress its intrinsic
worth and credibility. In such cases, the girl’s conduct may be

sufficient to justify the acceptance of her version.

47. In Raja Khurram Ali Khan and others v. Tayyaba Bibi
and another (PLD 2020 SC 146), the Supreme Court of Pakistan held:

“We also find that the trial court failed to appreciate the distinction
between a child witness, who is a witness of the crime, with one
who is herself a victim of the crime. This lack of distinction led the
trial Court to wrongly apply the principle of appreciating evidence
of an ordinary witness of a crime, and not applying the standard of
proof required for appreciating the testimony of a child witness, who
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -21-

is herself a victim of the said crime. Even otherwise, this Court
found that the prosecution had produced sufficient evidence against
the accused-convicts to safely discharge its ‘legal’ burden to prove
the guilt of the accused, which was not rebutted by the accused-
convicts by producing any evidence creating any doubt in the
prosecution’s case.”

A similar view was expressed in Zahid v. The State

(2022 SCMR 50).

48. The Supreme Court’s observations in Atif Zareef_and
others v. The State (PLD 2021 SC 550), though made in the context of
a rape case involving a woman, are relevant to the present discourse.
Recognizing the inherent difficulty in securing direct evidence for
sexual crimes due to their private nature, the Supreme Court
emphasized that the courts should not insist on additional direct
evidence to corroborate the victim’s testimony if it is found credible
within the specific facts and circumstances of a case. In such instances,
the victim’s testimony should alone suffice for the conviction of the
accused. The Supreme Court stated that a rape victim stood on a higher
pedestal than an injured witness because the latter only suffered
physical harm, while the former endured psychological and emotional

distress.

49. We conclude that the evaluation of a child’s testimony as a
victim of sexual abuse requires a thorough and balanced approach to
ensure the protection of their rights and interests while upholding
principles of justice. The absence of corroboration should not
automatically discredit the child’s testimony in such cases. The tender
age of the child, combined with other case-specific circumstances, such
as demeanour and the unlikelihood of tutoring, may make
corroboration unnecessary. However, this is a factual consideration in
each case. Courts must acknowledge that children may respond to the
trauma of abuse in diverse ways, which may include confusion, fear, or

emotional distress.

50. It is crucial to emphasize that the sexual abuse of a child
can take the form of penetrative or non-penetrative acts. Non-

penetrative cases pose more significant challenges, especially in our
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -22-

societal context, because this category has a heightened risk of false
accusations. Judges must determine the guilt or innocence of an
accused by thoroughly examining all available evidence, considering
the surrounding circumstances, and adhering to applicable legal
standards. Although a conviction based on the uncorroborated
testimony of a child victim of sexual abuse is legally possible, its
viability depends on the circumstances of the case and the strength of

the child’s testimony.

51. In the present case, BJ. testified that the Appellant called
him to his office daily and molested him. He further stated that on
02.02.2021, just before the school’s closure, the Appellant summoned
him, bolted the door of his office, and sexually abused him. B.J. alleged
that he threatened him with severe consequences and warned him
against disclosing the incident. Despite extensive cross-examination by
the Appellant, BJ. remained steadfast, answering each question
confidently and maturely despite his young age. During cross-
examination, the Appellant attempted to establish that CCTV cameras
were installed in the school, which could disprove the charges against
him, and the prosecution was deliberately withholding that evidence.
However, the Investigating Officer, Muhammad Aslam/SI (PW-5),

unequivocally affirmed that no such cameras were installed at the site.

52. According to the prosecution, on 2.2.2021, when B.J.
came home from school, he complained to his father, Muhammad
Javaid (PW-1), about sexual abuse by the Appellant. It claims that
Muhammad Shabbir (PW-2) and two others were also present on the
occasion. Both Javaid and Shabbir testified about this fact during the
trial. The next question that needs determination is whether this

evidence is legally admissible.

53. Hearsay evidence is the evidence given by a witness
consisting of a report of something which someone else has said rather

than a statement of something the witness has actually seen or
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -23-

experienced.’ Wigmore on Evidence states: “[The Hearsay Rule]
prohibits the use of a person’s assertion, as equivalent to testimony to
the fact asserted, unless the assertor is brought to the court on the stand,
where he may be probed and cross-examined as to the grounds of his

assertion and of his qualifications to make it.”®

The principle that bars
the admission of hearsay statements is rooted in the enduring belief that
cross-examination is the most effective means of uncovering the truth.
Many potential sources of inaccuracy and untrustworthiness that may
lay beneath a witness’s bare untested assertion can be brought to light
and exposed, if they exist, by subjecting them to cross-examination.
The opportunity to put the individual under oath and to observe their

demeanour is another traditional reason for requiring an appearance in

court °

54. Despite the pivotal role of cross-examination, exceptions
to the hearsay rule have long existed in evidentiary law. The rationale
for permitting the use of hearsay revolves around two main factors.
Firstly, certain hearsay statements can carry reliability even without
subjecting the original declarant to cross-examination. Trustworthiness
can be established from the circumstances under which the statement
was made, guaranteeing a level of reliability comparable to that found
in a statement that has undergone cross-examination. Secondly, there
are situations where applying the cross-examination test is impossible —
such as in cases where the declarant has died — and thus, it becomes
necessary to consider the statement in its untested form if it is to be
used at all. Hence, exceptions to the hearsay rule are based on two

fundamental principles: trustworthiness and necessity.’

55. Wigmore on Evidence enumerates 14 exceptions to the
hearsay rule.'’ Out of them, a few are more widely employed. These
include: dying declarations, statements of facts against interest, and

spontaneous exclamations.

56. Historically, res gestae and spontaneous exclamations
have been used synonymously. However, the term res gestae is broader
and overlaps with other exceptions of hearsay and different rules of
evidence. In Keefe v. State, 50 Ariz. 293, 72 Pac. 2d 425, Lockwood J.
explained that “res gestae”, which literally means “the thing done”,
refers in law to automatic and unintended circumstances accompanying
the particular act in issue. These circumstances are admissible as
evidence when they illustrate and explain the act, often involving
statements or explanations from witnesses present during the episode.
Lockwood J. distinguished between two classes of such statements or
explanations — “spontaneous exclamations” and “verbal acts”, adding
that the admissibility of each class is based upon entirely different

principles of law and logic. He further stated:

“A spontaneous exclamation may be defined as a statement or
exclamation made immediately after some exciting occasion by a
participant or spectator and asserting the circumstances of that
occasion as it is observed by him. The admissibility of such
exclamation is based on our experience that, under certain external
circumstances of physical or mental shock, a stress of nervous
excitement may be produced in a spectator which stills the reflective
faculties and removes their control, so that the utterance which then
occurs is a spontaneous and sincere response to the actual sensations
and perceptions already produced by the external shock. Since this
utterance is made under the immediate and uncontrolled domination
of the senses, rather than reason and reflection, and during the brief
period when consideration of self-interest could not have been fully
brought to bear, the utterance may be taken as expressing the real
belief of the speaker as to the facts just observed by him. Verbal acts
are utterances which accompany some act or conduct to which it is
desired to give a legal effect. When such an act has intrinsically no
definite legal significance, or only an ambiguous one, its legal
purport or tenor may be ascertained by considering the words
accompanying it, and these utterances thus enter merely as a verbal
part of the act. The use of utterances as verbal acts has four
limitations: (a) The conduct to be characterized by these words must
be material to the issue; (b) it must be equivocal in its nature; (c) the
words must aid in giving legal significance to the conduct; and (d)
the words must accompany the conduct.”

u Wigmore on Evidence (1940), Vol. V, § 1425, pp.208-9
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -25-

57. Courts sometimes apply time limitations to spontaneous
exclamations, which is incorrect and causes confusion. Such limitations
should only be applied to verbal acts. The real test in spontaneous
exclamations is not when the exclamation was made but whether the
speaker can be deemed to be expressing themselves under the stress of
nervous excitement and shock produced by the act in question. “There

can be no definite and fixed limit of time. Each case must depend upon

its own circumstances.”!”

58. As adumbrated, in instances of sexual abuse involving a
young child, the primary evidence very often consists of statements
made by the child to a third party. Usually, these statements do not
meet the criteria for admission under the conventional exceptions to the
hearsay rule. Faced with this situation, courts have increasingly opted
to relax the admissibility standards for statements made by children
regarding sexual abuse to others. In some jurisdictions, courts have
done this by making adjustments within the framework of the
spontaneous declarations doctrine. However, some commentators have
expressed disapproval of this approach. Yun writes:'*

“Under this approach, the use of the spontaneous exclamation
exception is virtually indistinguishable from its use in cases
involving adults. Some commentators criticize this approach. They
are that by treating child declarants as adults, the exception fails to
take into account the special circumstances surrounding child sex
abuse. It ignores the unusual need for child hearsay statements. The
emphasis on spontaneity is improper for two reasons. First, most
children do not view a sexual episode as shocking or even as
particularly unusual. Children often do not recount the event with
the shock or emotion required under the exception. Children are
simply not as highly sexualized or moralized as adults. They may
not know what has happened to them is wrong. This may be
especially true if the child has been involved in an incestuous
relationship. A parental imprimatur on the entire situation may often
cause the child to view everything as normal. Secondly, a significant
delay frequently precedes the child’s statement, thereby violating the
time requirement of the spontaneous exclamation exception. Even
when a child is aware of the nature of his or her assault, a report of
the event may still not be instantly forthcoming. This delay may be
caused by a variety of factors: the victim’s fears of not being
believed, feelings of confusion and guilt, efforts to forget, and
threats against the victim by the defendant. Consequently, a child
often keeps silent until something compels him or her to relate what

a Wigmore on Evidence (1940), Vol. VI, § 1750, p.143
8 See note 9.
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 - 26 -

has happened. Thus, the spontaneous exclamation unnecessarily bars
a significant proportion of probative evidence that should be
admitted.”

59. The shortcomings inherent in a rigid application of the
spontaneous exclamation exception to hearsay statements from child
victims in cases of sexual abuse have led to the emergence of the
“tender years exception.” It is designed explicitly for out-of-court
statements made by child victims of sexual crimes. Although the tender
years exception is sometimes considered a variation of the spontaneous
exclamation exception, it differs significantly. The requirement of
contemporaneity is eliminated. This exception allows for the admission
of statements from young victims regardless of the time elapsed
between the assault and the statement, provided that the delay is
adequately explained. The underlying rationale seems to be the
assumption that the child is under continuous duress throughout the
entire period. Notably, the tender years exception permits the
introduction of hearsay only to corroborate the child’s in-court
testimony. This exception was first recognized in People v Gage,
62 Mich. 271, 28 N.W. 835 (1886), where the court admitted the
hearsay statements of a ten-year-old victim of sexual assault that were

made approximately three months after the incident.

60. The Supreme Court of Canada made the following

statement of law in Abdullah Khan v. The Queen, [1990] 2 R.CS.

531, on the above subject:

“The first question should be whether reception of the hearsay
statement is necessary. Necessity for these purposes must be
interpreted as ‘reasonably necessary’. The inadmissibility of the
child’s evidence might be one basis for a finding of necessity. But
sound evidence based on psychological assessments that testimony
in court might be traumatic for the child or harm the child might also
serve. There may be other examples of circumstances which could
establish the requirement of necessity.”

“The next question should be whether the evidence is reliable. Many
considerations, such as timing, demeanour, the personality of the
child, the intelligence and understanding of the child, and the
absence of any reason to expect fabrication in the statement, may be
relevant to the issue of reliability. I would not wish to draw up a
strict list of considerations for reliability, nor to suggest that certain
categories of evidence (for example, the evidence of young children
on sexual encounters) should be always regarded as reliable. The
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -27-

matters relevant to reliability will vary with the child and with the
circumstances and are best left to the trial judge.”

61. In Abdullah Khan, supra, the Supreme Court of Canada
concluded that hearsay evidence related to a child’s statement about
crimes committed against them should be accepted, provided that the
criteria of necessity and reliability are satisfied. This acceptance is
subject to such safeguards as the judge may deem necessary and the
considerations affecting the weight that should be given to such
evidence. This does not automatically make out-of-court statements by
children generally admissible. The necessity requirement will probably

mean that, in most instances, children still need to testify in person.

62. In re Cindy L. (1997) 17 Cal.4th 15, 69 Cal.Rptr.2d 803,
947, P2d 1340 (Ciny L.), the Supreme Court of California held that
“the out-of-court statements of children who are subject to juvenile
dependency hearing pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section
300, may be admitted in that proceeding if the statements show
particular indicia of reliability, if the statements are corroborated, and if
interested parties have notice that the statements will be used ... The
requirement of corroboration [is] an extra prudential rule. Unlike the
special indicia of reliability requirement ... it is not mandated by due
process. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has held in the
context of a child sexual abuse prosecution that the confrontation
clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution is not
offended by the introduction of and full reliance on the child victim’s

hearsay so long as it meets the test of reliability. (Idaho v. Wright).”

63. In the present case, the testimony of Muhammad Javaid
(PW-1) and Muhammad Shabbir (PW-2) is admissible in view of
Illustration (j) to Article 21 of QSO, which provides as follows:

@)) The question is, whether A was ravished:

The facts that, shortly after the alleged rape, she made a
complaint relating to the crime, the circumstances under which, and
the terms in which, the complaint was made are relevant.

The fact that, without making a complaint, she said that she
had been ravished is not relevant as conduct under this Article
though it may be relevant as a dying declaration under Article 46
paragraph (1), or as corroborative evidence under Article 153.
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 - 28 -

64. Article 21 of the QSO is analogous to section 8 of the
Indian Evidence Act 1872. In Rameshwar v. The State of Rajasthan
(AIR 1952 SC 54), while considering that provision, the Supreme
Court of India held that it is “indisputable” that the rape victim’s
statement to her mother was admissible in evidence and added that it
could also be used for corroboration. It stated:

“’.. we are concerned here not only with its legal admissibility and
relevancy as to conduct but as to its admissibility for a particular
purpose, namely corroboration. The answer to that is to be found in
section 157 of the Evidence Act'* which lays down the law for India

. The section makes no exceptions, therefore, provided the
condition prescribed, that is to say, ‘at or about the time etc.,’ are
fulfilled there can be no doubt that such a statement is legally
admissible in India as corroboration. The weight to be attached to it
is, of course, another matter and it may be that in some cases the
evidentiary value of two statements emanating from the same tainted
source may not be high, but in view of section 118 its legal
admissibility as corroboration cannot be questioned. To state this is,
however, no more than to emphasizes that there is no rule of thumb
in these cases. When corroborative evidence is produced it also has
to be weighed, and in a given case, as with other evidence, even
though it is legally admissible for the purpose on hand its weight
may be nil. On the other hand, seeing that corroboration is not
essential to a conviction, conduct of this kind may be more than
enough in itself to justify acceptance of the complainant’s story. It
all depends on the facts of the case.”

65. In Raja Khurram Ali Khan and others v. Tayyaba Bibi
and another (PLD 2020 SC 146), the Supreme Court of Pakistan held

that in cases where the child witness is also the victim of the crime and
is unable to depose in the courtroom, and his evidence is “necessary” to
find the truth, and the same has a ring of “circumstantial
trustworthiness” attached therewith, then courts may consider the out-

of-court evidence thereof, as an exception to the “hearsay rule”.

66. Complainant Muhammad Javaid (PW-1) is B.J.’s father
while Muhammad Shabbir is the minor’s paternal uncle who has
adopted him. The PWs do not harbour any ill will towards the
Appellant that could serve as a motive for falsely implicating him in
this case. Their statements are in line with BJ.’s testimony, providing

consistent and corroborative evidence.

Section 157 of the Indian Evidence Act is analogous to Article 153 of Pakistan’s Qanun-e-
Shahadat, 1984.
Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 -29 -

67. We conclude that the prosecution has established the
charge against the Appellant beyond any shadow of doubt. Hence, we

dismiss this appeal.

68. We may write an additional note before parting with this
judgment.
69. When a child engages with the judicial system, the

response should be supportive, collaborative, and aligned with a child-
right-driven approach.'” Involvement with the legal system can take
various forms, such as being a party in a legal case, acting as a witness,
undergoing legal proceedings, or seeking legal remedies. The
aforementioned approach is based on acknowledging children as rights
holders and vulnerable individuals, emphasizing the crucial need to
establish an environment that prioritizes their well-being and protection
throughout legal processes. The United Nations has issued several sets
of guidelines and recommendations related to child witnesses and child
victims of sexual abuse. Notable documents include “UN Guidelines
on Justice in Matters Involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime,”
which provide extensive guidance on the treatment of child witnesses
during legal proceedings. Similarly, the United Nations Children’s
Fund (UNICEF) offers resources and guidelines on child protection,
including recommendations on child-friendly legal procedures.
UNICEF’s “Justice for Children” initiative aims to ensure that children
who are victims, witnesses, or offenders in legal processes are treated
with respect and provided with the necessary support. Our government
has adopted some of these international standards, but there is a need
for more concerted efforts, particularly in terms of the rehabilitation

and reintegration of these children into society.

70. Child sexual abuse is a deeply traumatic and sensitive
issue that demands that the justice system handle these cases with
exceptional care and consideration for the unique needs and

vulnerabilities of child victims. Parliament passed the Anti-Rape

Crl. Appeal No.448/2022 - 30 -

(Investigation and Trial) Act 2021 to effectively deal with rape and
sexual abuse offences (enumerated in the Schedules thereof).
Regrettably, some of its provisions have not been implemented,
although the Act was passed two years ago. As a result, the Act’s
intended goals have not been realized. The Federal Government is
directed to immediately review the steps taken to implement the Act

and ensure that the requisite systems are in place within sixty days.

71. The 2021 Act contains comprehensive provisions to
address child victims’ distinctive requirements and susceptibilities. The
courts are obligated to adhere to these provisions. In particular, they

should ensure that:

(i) Every child is treated with respect, dignity, and
sensitivity throughout the legal process.

(ii) The child’s identity is protected and confidentiality
is maintained to reduce potential stigma and harm to him.

(iii) The examination of child witnesses is conducted in
a manner that is sensitive to their age, maturity, and
capacity to understand, and it should be designed to elicit
their testimony in a child-friendly and supportive manner.

(iv) Cross-examination is a fundamental component of
the legal process. Judges should balance the child’s rights
and their need for protection with the accused’s right to a
fair trial. They may intervene to prevent aggressive or
inappropriate questioning during cross-examination. This
approach helps reduce the potential emotional impact on
the child while maintaining the integrity of the legal
process.

(v) Section 12 of the 2021 Act mandates that the trial of
the scheduled offences must be conducted in-camera.
However, in his discretion or upon application of either
party, the judge may allow specific persons to observe the
court proceedings or remain in the court. Moreover,
notwithstanding any other law for the time being in force,
the judge may take suitable measures, such as conducting
the trial through video-link or utilizing screens, to ensure
the protection of the victims and witnesses. The Special
Courts must allow this provision in letter and spirit.

(vi) The Special Courts should also hear bail
applications in-camera in cases involving the scheduled
offences.

72. Section 26 of the 2021 Act explicitly prohibits the
disclosure or revelation of the identity of a victim or the victim’s family
concerning the scheduled offences unless prior written permission is
obtained from the victim, the victim’s family, or the guardian in the
case of a minor victim. It is disconcerting that, in the present case, the
Additional Sessions Judge repeatedly used the victim’s full name
instead of employing an acronym in the present case. It is true that
section 26, supra, does not relate to the printing or publication of the
court judgments, but it is essential to recognize that this provision was
enacted with the societal goal of preventing the social victimization or
ostracism of sexual offence victims. Therefore, judges should exercise
extreme caution when writing judgments. Henceforth, they shall

identify the victims using acronyms rather than full names.

73. The Registrar of this Court is directed to circulate copies
of this judgment to all the District and Sessions Judges in the Punjab to

ensure compliance with the above directives.
