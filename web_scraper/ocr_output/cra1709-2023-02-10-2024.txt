3. The prosecution’s case as unfolded in First
Information Report (“FIR”) Exh.PW.3/1 is that on
22.10.2021 at 1550 hours, complainant Sher Dil Khan
(PW.9), in company of dead body of his wife Mst. Hameeda
deceased, in trauma room of Lady Reading Hospital
(“LRH”) Peshawar, reported to Gul Nabi Shah SI (PW.2) to
the effect that on the fateful day he along with his deceased
wife was present in his house, situated in Fagir Kalay Garhi
Fazil; that on commotion of children, when he along with the
deceased came out of their house, appellants along with
co-accused Faisal, duly armed with firearms present there
opened fire at them, as a result, his wife Mst. Hameeda
deceased got hit and succumbed to injuries on the way when
she was being shifted to hospital, while he luckily remained
unscathed. Besides him, the occurrence is stated to have been
witnessed by his nephew Sabir Umar (PW.10). No motive
was advanced by him behind the occurrence. Report of the
complainant was reduced into writing in the shape of
Murasila Exh.PW.2/1 by Gul Nabi Shah SI, who also

prepared injury sheet Exh.sPW.2/2 and inquest report
Exh.PW.2/3 of the deceased and shifted her dead body to
KMC through constable Farman for postmortem
examination. On the same day, Gul Nabi Shah SI, also
arrested appellant Kamal Jalal vide arrest Card Exh.PW.2/4.
On 11.12.2021 he also arrested appellant Bilal vide arrest
Card Exh.PW.2/5 and from his possession recovered one 30
bore pistol along with bandolier containing 10 live rounds of
the same bore vide recovery memo Exh.PW.2/6. A separate
FIR No.1061 dated 11.12.2021 under section 15 KP Arms
Act was registered against appellant Bilal.

4. On 22.10.2021 at 1526 hours, lady doctor Mustajab
Begum conducted postmortem examination on the dead body
of deceased and found the following injuries on her person.

1. A firearm entry wound 3x2 cm in size on top of
skull on left side 3 cm away from midline and
13 cm above forehead.

Gravid uterus contains male fetus of four months
POG 150 gram weight.

Opinion: According to her opinion the deceased died

due to firearm injury to her brain and its associated

blood vessels due to firearm.
5. After registration of the FIR, Safdar Khan Inspector
(PW.11), proceeded to the spot and prepared site plan
Exh.PB on the pointation of the complainant, recorded
statements of the PWs under section 161 Cr.P.C. During spot

inspection, he secured blood through cotton from the place of
the deceased, 05 empties of 7.62 bore from the places of
appellant Bilal and Faisal and one empty of 30 bore from the
place of appellant Kamal Jalal vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.1/1. Vide recovery memo Exh.PW.1/2, he took into
possession bloodstained garments of the deceased. He
obtained physical remand of the appellants from the Court of
learned Judicial Magistrate, interrogated them and recorded
their statements under section 161 Cr.P.C., initiated
proceedings under section 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. against the
absconding co-accused Faisal, sent the bloodstained Articles,
empties and pistol to the FSL, reports whereof are Exh.PZ
and Exh.PZ/1, respectively. Vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.11/19 he took into possession 30 bore pistol along
with 10 live rounds recovered from appellant Bilal, produced
by Moharrir. On completion of investigation he handed over
case file to the SHO, who submitted challan against the
appellants before the learned trial Court.

6. On receipt of challan, the appellants were summoned
by the learned trial Court and formally charge sheeted under
sections 302, 324, 338-C and 34 PPC to which they pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial. To prove guilt of the appellants,
the prosecution’s examined as many as twelve witnesses.
After closure of the prosecution’s evidence, statements of the
appellants were recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein
they denied the prosecution’s allegations and professed their

innocence. They, however, neither wished to be examined on
oath under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor opted to produce
evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial, the learned trial
court, after hearing both the sides, convicted and sentenced
the appellants as mentioned in the initial paragraph of the
judgment, hence, this appeal.

7. We have heard the arguments of learned counsel for
the parties and perused the record and evidence with their
valuable assistance.

8. As per version of complainant Sher Dil Khan (PW.9),
occurrence in this case has taken place in front of his house,
situated in Faqir Kalay Garhi Fazil at 1440 hours, which has
been reported by him in LRH Peshawar at 1550 hours. In his
report, complainant has alleged that on the eventful day on
the commotion of children when he along with his wife
Mst. Hameeda deceased came out of their house, the
appellants along with absconding co-accused Faisal present
there, opened indiscriminate firing at them, as a result, his
wife got hit and succumbed to injuries on the way when she
was being shifted by them to hospital. Besides him, the
occurrence is stated to have been witnessed by his nephew,
namely, Sabir Umar (PW.10).

9. Complainant Sher Dil while appearing in the witness
box as PW.9, has reiterated the same story as set forth by him
in the FIR. Neither in his initial report nor in his statement
before the court, he has advanced any motive behind the

occurrence. In cross-examination he admitted that during the
days of occurrence he was serving as a Hawaldar in FC
Intelligence Branch and was performing his duties in Qilla
Balahisar Peshawar; that his duty timining was from 08.00
AM to 06/7.00 PM; that he had no enmity with the appellants
prior to the occurrence rather their relations were cordial. He
admitted it correct that all the three appellants belong to three
different villages; that appellants and absconding co-accused
had come to the spot to target him only; that he does not
know as to why the appellants and absconding co-accused
had come to his house to target him; that the accused were
intending to target his whole family for no reason; that the
accused had no enmity with him and his family members;
that his children, namely, Muskan, Shah Said, Aiman and
Yahya were crying in the street when they saw the accused
armed with firearms; that no sooner he along with his wife
came out of their house, the accused opened firing at them;
that he came out first while his wife followed him after 3, 4
seconds; that all the four accused started firing abruptly; that
none of the accused made firing from the roof top at the
deceased. He admitted it correct that the deceased had
sustained single firearm injury on her skull.

10. The cross-examination of complainant create serious
doubt about his presence at the spot at the time of occurrence
for the reasons, firstly, if he was serving as a Hawaldar in FC
and posted in Qilla Balahisar and his duty timing was from

08.00 AM to 06/07.00 PM then his presence at 02.40 PM
(time of occurrence) in the house would not accept a prudent
mind. Though he has stated that he was on leave from duty
on the eventful day and in this regard also produced a leave
certificate Exh.PW.9/X-1, but the said certificate on the one
hand, is a photocopy, while on the other hand, has not been
produced/exhibited by any official from Qilla Balahisar. It
has also not been produced by him before the Investigating
Officer during investigation (1.0) of the case. The I.O. has
also not recorded statement of any official of the FC in this
regard. In this view of the matter, the leave certificate on the
part of the complainant is an abortive attempt to justify his
presence at the spot. Secondly, if he was the first target of the
accused then his escape or let off by four accused armed with
automatic weapons ejecting numbers of shots in seconds is
another strong circumstance which makes his presence at the
spot at the time of occurrence highly doubtful. Thirdly,
keeping in view the customs and traditions of people of this
party of the country, the women folk are strictly observing
pardha and in presence of male members in the house, they
are not allowed to go out of the house in case of any
commotion or brawl outside the house rather male members
in such like situation go out of the house to see what is
happening. Thus, coming out of the Mst. Hameeda deceased
on the commotion of children is another strong circumstance
which convince a prudent mind that complainant was not

present at the spot at the time of occurrence. Coming of four
accused to the house of the complainant with whom they had
no ill will or enmity rather had cordial relation and then
opening firing for no reason or motive, is also a disturbing
circumstance pinching a prudent mind. No bullets marks
have been noticed on the gate and walls of the house of the
complainant. No spent bullet has been shown recovered from
the spot. As per autopsy report the deceased has sustained a
solitary firearm entry wound with corresponding exit,
direction of which is from upward to downward, meaning
thereby that the assailant was on top position than the
deceased at the time of firing which is not the case of the
prosecution. Only 05 empties of 7.62 and one empty of 30
have been shown recovered from the spot despite the fact that
four accused have been assigned the role of indiscriminate
firing. In case of firing by four accused with automatic
weapons, much damage should have been caused to the
deceased and the complainant and there should have been
bullet marks on the main gate as well as walls of the house of
the complainant but such is not the case herein. The above
discussed facts and circumstances clearly suggest that the
occurrence has not taken place in the mode and manner as
alleged by the prosecution rather in some other mode best
known to the complainant.

11. So far as the following admissions on the part of
learned counsel for the defence in the cross-examination of

complainant are concerned?
“It is correct that all the three accused were firing
from their weapons with single, single fire shot; It is
incorrect to suggest that accused facing trial were
firing on each other and the deceased got hit due to
aerial firing in her own house.
By now it is settled law accused in a criminal case is not
bound by the admission made by his counsel. In this regard
we would refer to the case of Abdul Khaliq vs the State
(1996 SCMR 1553), wherein it has been held by the august
apex court that even if a question in cross-examination by the
defence counsel, amounts to an admission, the same cannot
bind the appellant. Relevant part of the judgment is
reproduced below:-
“Abdul Jabbar admitted to the defence suggest that
he was informed by deceased Abdul Wahabt that he
was fired at by Abdul Khaliq and Khudaidad. This
statement was ought to be used by the learned
Additional__Advocate__General__against__ the
appellant, as his admission to the effect that he
had fired at the deceased. Even if putting of such
question in cross-examination by the defence
counsel, amounts _to_an_admission, the same
cannot bind the appellant. In a criminal case an
accused is not bound by the admissions made by

his counsel. Reference can be made to the case of

Sh. Abdul Hamid and another Vs the State (1973 P

CrLJ858).
10

It is also settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that
prosecution is duty bond to prove its case through cogent and
confidence inspiring evidence beyond shadow of reasonable
doubt and it cannot derive any benefit from the weakness of
defence. In this regard reference can be made to the case of
“Rab Nawaz and others vs the State” (PLD 1994 Supreme
Court 858). Relevant part of the judgment is reproduced
below:-

“It is well-established principle of criminal
jurisprudence that the prosecution has to establish its
case beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt and
that they cannot derive any benefit from the

weakness of defence.

12. Placing reliance on the judgments (supra) of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court, admissions in cross-examination of
the complainant would not advance the prosecution’s case.

13. Coming to the testimony of another alleged
eyewitness, namely, Sabir Umar, who is nephew of the
complainant. He while appearing in the witness box deposed
that on 22.10.2021 he was coming to the house of his uncle
and when reached near his house, the children started crying,
upon which his uncle Sher Dil and his wife came out of their
house and the accused started firing at them with the
intention to commit their Qatl-e-Amd; that from the firing of
the accused he escaped unhurt while his deceased Aunt got

hit and injured who was shifted to LRH by him with the help
11

of his uncle Sher; that on the way to LRH she succumbed to
injuries.

14. Complainant Sher Dil in his statement has not assigned
the role of firing to the accused on PW Sabir Umar. Contrary,
PW Sabir Umar has charged the accused for firing at him
also. In cross-examination PW Sabir Umar admitted it correct
that he is resident of Bara District Khyber and during the
days of occurrence was residing in Mohallah Garhi Sohbat
Khan Peshawar. He has not stated a single word qua the
purpose of his visit to the house of his uncle. In cross-
examination he has stated that he was present in front of
house of the complainant at the time of firing. This PW has
also not sustained a single scratch what to say of receipt of
firearms injuries. Escape of PW Sabir Umar from the firing
of four accused having sophisticated weapons or his left off
by them to stand an eyewitness against them is also a strong
circumstance which makes his presence at the spot highly
doubtful. The alleged eyewitnesses have not furnished
confiding inspiring explanation so as to establish their
presence at the spot at the time of occurrence.

15. It needs no elaboration that presence of eyewitnesses at
the spot is not to be inferred rather is to be proved by
prosecution beyond scintilla of doubt. In the absence of some
confidence inspiring explanation regarding their presence at
crime scene, the two eyewitnesses are found to be chance

witnesses and their testimony can safely be termed as suspect
12

evidence. In arriving at such conclusion, we are enlightened
from the cases of “Ibrar Hussain and another versus The

State” (2020 SCMR 1850), “Mst. Mir Zalai_versus Ghazi

Khan and others” (2020 SCMR 319), and “Naveed Asghar

and 2 others versus The State” (PLD 2021 Supreme Court
600) wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan while
dealing with a case of chance witness observed as under:-

"Reading of the statement of Mirza

Muhammad Umar (PW-13) shows that he is a

chance witness; a witness who in view of his

place of residence or occupation and in the

ordinary course of events is not supposed to be

present at the place of occurrence but claims to

be there by chance. Testimony of such witness

requires cautious scrutiny and is not accepted

unless he gives satisfactory explanation of his

presence at or near the place of the occurrence

at the relevant time.”
The Hon’ble supreme court in case of Mst. Sughra Begum
and another versus Qaiser Pervez and others (2015 SCMR
1142) at para No.14, has observed regarding the chance
witnesses as under:--

"14... A chance witness, in legal
parlance is the one who claims
that he was present on the crime
spot at the fateful time, albeit, his
presence there was sheer chance
as in the ordinary course of
business, place of residence and

normal course of events, he was
13

not supposed to be present on the
spot but at a place where he
resides, carries on business or
runs day to day life affairs. It is in
this context that the testimony of
chance witness, ordinarily, is not
accepted unless justifiable reasons
are shown to establish his
presence at the crime scene at the
relevant time. In normal course,
the presumption under the law
would operate about his absence
from the crime spot. True that in
rare cases, the testimony of
chance witness may be relied
upon, provided some convincing
explanations appealing to prudent
mind for his presence on the
crime spot are put forth, when the
occurrence took place otherwise,
his testimony would fall within
the category of suspect evidence
and cannot be accepted without a

pinch of salt.."

A similar view was reiterated by the apex court in the case of

Muhammad Irshad versus Allah Ditta_and_others (2017
SCMR 142). The relevant part of the said judgment at Para

No.2 reads as under:-

".,.Muhammad Irshad
complainant (PW8) and Rab
Nawaz (PW9) were chance
witnesses and the stated reason for
their presence with the deceased
at the relevant time had never
been established before the trial
court through any independent

evidence..."
14

Likewise, in the case of Sufyan Nawaz and another versus
the State and others (2020 SCMR 192) at Para No.5, the

Hon’ble apex court has observed as under:--

Meee He admitted that in his
statement before police, he had
not assigned any reason for
coming to village on the day of
occurrence. In these
circumstances, complainant
Muhammad Arshad (PW.7) is, by
all means, a chance witness and
his presence at the spot at the
relevant time is not free from
doubt.."

16. Medical evidence also does not support the
prosecution’s case. The deceased has sustained a solitary fire
arm entrance wound, direction of which is from upward to
downward. None of the accused has been shown on higher
position than the deceased at the time of firing, therefore, the
entrance wound on the person of the deceased is a serious
blow to the prosecution’s case. Though, positive Serologist
report with regard to the blood secured from the spot and the
last won bloodstained clothes of the deceased prove the place
of occurrence to be the same as alleged by the prosecution
and postmortem report proves the unnatural death of the
deceased due to firearm injury but such corroborative and
confirmatory pieces of evidence, in absence of direct
evidence, by no stretch of imagination tell the name(s) of the

culprits. Such pieces of evidence are always taken in aid of

15

the direct evidence and not in isolation. The hon’ble Supreme
Court of Pakistan in its judgment rendered in the case of
“Imran Ashraf & 7 others v/s The State” reported_as
2001 SCMR 424, has observed that;

“Recovery of incriminating articles is used
for the purpose of providing corroboration
to the ocular testimony. Ocular evidence
and recoveries, therefore, are to be
considered simultaneously in order to reach

for a just conclusion”.
17. As regards positive FSL report Exh.PZ/1 to the
effect that one 30 bore crime empty recovered from the spot
has been fired from the pistol shown recovered on the
pointation of appellant Kamal Jalal from his house on
24.10.2021, suffice it to say that appellant Kamal Jalal has
been shown arrested on the day of occurrence i.e.
22.10.2021, while the alleged pistol was recovered on his
pointation on 24.10.2021. No explanation, much less
plausible, has been furnished by the prosecution as to why
the empty was kept in the PS till recovery of the pistol on
24.10.2021. Again, no explanation has been furnished by the
prosecution as to which the pistol and empties were sent to
the FSL on 26.10.2021. In a case titled Ghulam Akbar and
another Vs. The State (2008 SCMR-1064, it is observed by
their Lordships that law requires that empty recovered from
the spot should be sent to the FSL without any delay, failing
which such recovery evidence was not free from doubt and

could not be used against the accused. It is observed in the
16

case of Attaullah and others Vs. The State (PLD 1990
Peshawar-10), that the crime empties should be immediately

dispatched to Arms Expert and should not be kept by the
Investigating Officer because in that case objection regarding
manipulation of recovery will hold good. Similarly, it is by
now well established proposition of law that if the crime
empty is sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory after the
arrest of the accused or together with the crime weapon, the
positive report of the said Laboratory loses its evidentiary
value. Reliance in this respect is placed on the case of
“Jehangir vs. Nazar Farid and another” (2002 SCMR
1986), “Israr Ali vs. The State” (2007 SCMR 525) and
“Ali Sher and others vs. The State” (2008 SCMR 707).

18, On reappraisal of the evidence available on record, we
are firm in our view to hold that the prosecution case is
pregnant with doubts, benefit of which is to be extended to
the appellants not as matter of grace or concession but as a
matter of right. This cardinal principle of criminal
administration of justice is based on the concept of justice in
Islam which is to be observed more consciously and
carefully. Benefit of doubt features appearing in the case
invariably are required to be given full effect while deciding
a criminal case. Benefit of doubt, if any favourable to the
accused cannot be withheld in the exercise of discretion of
the Court at any stage. It is an axiomatic principle of law that

the benefit of doubt is always extended in favour of the
17

accused. The case of the prosecution, if found to be doubtful,
then every doubt, even the slightest, is to be resolved in

favour of the accused. In this regard reliance can be placed

on “Muhammad Masha vs the State” (2018 SCMR 772)

and relevant observations of their lordships appearing in para
No.4 of the judgment can advantageously be reproduced
hereunder:-

“Needless to mention that while giving benefit
of doubt to an accused it is not necessary that
there should be many circumstances creating
doubt. If there is a circumstance which creates
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the
guilty of the accused, then the accused would
be entitled to the benefit of such doubt, not as a
matter of grace and concession, but as a matter
of right. It is based on the maxim, “It is better
that ten guilty person be acquitted rather than
one innocent person be convicted”. Reliance in
this behalf can be made to the cases of “Tariq
Pervez_vs the State (1995 SCMR_ 1345),

Gulam Qadir and 2 others vs the State (2008
SCMR_1221), Muhammad Akram vs _ the
State (2009 SCMR_ 230) and Muhammad

Zaman vs the State (2014 SCMR 749).

In another judgment titled, “Abdul Jabbar vs the State

and another (2019 SCMR 129), their lordships have
observed that:-

“It is settled principle of law that once a single
loophole is observed in a case presented by the
prosecution much less glaring conflict... benefit
of such loophole/lacuna in the prosecution’s
case automatically goes in favour of an

accused.”
18

19. Placing reliance on the judgments (supra), we allow
this appeal, set-aside the conviction and sentences of the
appellants recorded by the learned trial Court through the
impugned judgment and hereby acquit them from the charges
levelled against them in the instant case. They be set at

liberty forthwith, if not confined in any ot!
