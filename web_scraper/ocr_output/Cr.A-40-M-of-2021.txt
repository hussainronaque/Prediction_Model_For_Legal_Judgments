2. On 09.12.2019, the complainant, Bakht

Amal (PW-8), reported the matter to the local police in
emergency room of Tehsil Headquarter Hsopital,
Besham. Bakht Amal and Bakht Taj Khan, his brother,
visited Besham bazaar for purchase of certain
household articles. They were present in the bazaar in
front of Rahim Hotel at Karora road, when the
appellant came across them and exchanged some hot
words with his brother, Bakht Taj Khan. The appellant
took out his pistol and fired at his brother, due to which
he got hit on his neck. After commission of the
offence, the appellant decamped from the spot. The
occurrence was stated to have been witnessed by one
Mumaber s/o Abdul Wahid. Murasila was drafted
which culminated into registration of the case against

the appellant at the Police Station concerned.

3. After completion of investigation, challan
was submitted against the appellant before the learned
Senior Civil Judge/Judicial Magistrate, Kolai Palas,
Kohistan at Besham, which was later on sent to the
learned Sessions Judge, Shangla, for trial. Copies were
supplied to the appellant u/s. 265-C, Cr. PC. Charge
was farmed against him, to which he pleaded not guilty

and claimed trial.

3.

4, The prosecution examined as many as
eleven (11) PWs. Statement of the appellant u/s. 342,
Cr. PC, was also recorded, in which he was afforded an
opportunity of evidence in defence and/or statements

on oath but he did not avail it.

5. After hearing arguments of the learned
APP duly assisted by the learned counsel for the
complainant and learned counsel for the appellant, the
learned trial Judge vide the impugned judgment dated
29.01.2021, convicted the appellant as mentioned in

para-] of this judgment.

6. I have heard arguments of learned counsel
for the parties and the learned Assistant Advocate

General, for the State and perused the record.

7. The evidence of Bakht Amal, the
complainant (PW-8) and Bakht Taj Khan, the victim
(PW-7), is crucial and may be discussed first. The
complainant narrated nearly the same story in his
statement recorded as examination-in-chief as he had
told in the Murasila. To restate concisely, he deposed
that on the date of the occurrence (i.e. 09.12.2019), he
and Bakht Taj Khan, his brother, visited Besham
bazaar for purchase of household articles. He added

that while he and his brother were wandering in the

Abdul Sabook!* (3.B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IQBAL
-4.

bazaar in front of Rahim Hotel at Karora road, the
appellant came across them and exchanged hot words
with Bakht Taj Khan. At that time, the appellant fired
at his brother, due to which he was hit on his neck. The
appellant ran away. He took his brother to the hospital,
where he made the report to the local police, which
was reduced in the shape of Murasila. The Murasila
was read over to him, which he acknowledged as
correct, Later on, the victim was shifted to DHQ
Hospital, Alupri, in a police van. He pointed out the
crime scene to the police and a site plan was prepared.
The police recovered blood and one empty of 30 bore
pistol from the spot, which were sealed in separate
parcels. He endorsed the memo of the above
mentioned articles and his as well as the signature of
Muhammad Anwar alias Muamber thereon. He also
stated that the motive of the occurrence was suspicion
of the appellant that the victim had illicit relationship
with his wife. He further explained that later on, it
came into his knowledge that the appellant had
telephonically asked his brother to commit the murder

of his wife.

8. The complainant was subjected to lengthy
cross-examination, such as, the time he and the victim
left their house; their arrival in the Besham bazaar; the

Abdul Saboch!* (5B) HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE Or. KHURSHID IOBAL
-5-

purpose of their visit to Besham bazaar; the shifting of
the victim to the hospital; the alleged shelter they took
in the nearby shop; hearing of hot words exchanged
between the victim and the appellant; and the recovery
of spent bullet from the spot and the motive. A close
reading of his cross-examination would reveal that the
defence failed to create substantial dent in his
testimony. He correctly deposed that he and the victim
both left the house at 07:00, a.m.; reached Besham
bazaar at about 08:30/09:00, a.m.; were present in front
of Rahim Hotel at Karora raod and visited Besham
bazaar for purchase of household articles. He denied a
suggestion that one Hukumat Khan shifted the victim
to the hospital. He further correctly reiterated firstly,
the police arrived in the Tehsil Headquarter Hospital,
Besham, to whom he made the report: secondly, the
victim was shifted to DHQ hospital, Alpuri: thirdly, he
denied a suggestion that he and the victim took refuge
in the shops of Sherin Zada and Gul Muhammad.
In cross-examination, he was asked that he had not
stated to the police in his statement recorded u/s. 161,
Cr. P.C. that the victim went to the shop of Mehraban
and it was on his return from the above referred shop
that the occurrence took place and that he had not

heard harsh words exchanged between the victim and

Abdut Sadech!* (3.B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL
-6-
the appellant. He was further asked that his hand got

besmeared with the blood of the victim; in his presence
spent bullet was not recovered from the spot and that
later on, wife of the appellant was done to death. The
answers to these questions may be referred here. For
example, the refuge by him and the victim in the shops
of Sherin Zada and Gul Muhammad; the entry and the
coming out of the victim from the shop of one
Mehraban; the non-hearing of the harsh words; the
besmearing of his hands with the blood of the victim;
the non-recovery of spent bullet from the spot and the
murder of wife of the appellant. These points are, if at
all, minor discrepancies, which have no bearing on the

main core of the prosecution case.

9, The victim Bakht Taj Khan (PW-7) in his
examination-in-chief deposed that he and Bakht Amal,
his brother/complainant, went to Besham bazaar, while
they reached Rahim Hotel, the appellant there stated
something to him, which he did not understand and the
appellant then took out his pistol, fired at him at which
he was hit on his neck. He then became unconscious;
his brother might have taken him to the hospital; when
he came to senses, he got information that the appellant
had telephonically directed his brother Muhammad
Muqam to commit his murder on suspicion of his illicit

Abdul Sebeoh!* (5.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL
-7-
relationship with his wife. He stated that the

occurrence was witnessed by his brother. He, too, was
subjected to lengthy cross-examination, which shows
that he was asked about the exact place of firing at
him; his consciousness after the occurrence; delay of
two months in recording of his statement; his shifting
to the hospital by Hukumat Khan; his refuge in the
bazaar; his arrival in the bazaar; the purpose of his visit
to the bazaar; the presence of one Mehraban in his
shop, his relationship with two shopkeepers, namely,
Sherin Zada and Gul Muhammad and the presence of
Muhammad Anwar on the spot. The substantial parts
of his statement i.e. the presence of the appellant,
uttering of certain words by the appellant, the firing of
the appellant at him with a pistol, with which he got
injured, were not successfully upset in the cross-

examination.

10. There are, however, certain other aspects
which the learned counsel for the appellant tried his
best to show as substantial dent in his statement. He
deposed that at the time of the occurrence, he came out
of the shop situated opposite Rahim Hotel. This
appears to be a minor discrepancy. The reason is that
mere this much statement could not be considered to

undo the very firing made at him.

Abdul Sebook!* (5.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Or. KHURSHID IOSAL

11. The medical report corroborates that a
firearm injury was caused on the neck of the victim. As
regards his unconsciousness and delay of two months
in recording his statement, reference has to be made to
the medico-legal report coupled with the statement of
Dr. Zafar Ali (PW-1). The medical report reflects that
when the police produced the victim before the
Medical Officer, a question was asked from the Doctor
as to whether the victim was able to speak or not. The
Doctor observed him: “vitally not stable, mentally not
active and alert”. This observation is enough to believe
that though he might not have been fully unconscious,
he was surely unable to speak. The medical evidence
further corroborates the prosecution story as it reflects
that the victim got firearm injury. On the record there
is also lying a copy of the medical report of the victim
from the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head &
Neck Surgery of Saidu Group of Teaching Hospital,
Saidu Sharif, Swat (Ex PW 1/3), which shows that the
victim remained in that hospital under treatment and
was discharged on 25.01.2020. The record shows that
his statement was recorded on 01.02.2020, some seven
days, after his discharge of the hospital. However, his
statement was recorded in Batagram. The complainant

charged him initially pursuant to an altercation and

Abdul Saboah!* GB) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID [OBAL
-9-

subsequently motivated by suspicion of _ illicit
relationship between him and the wife of the appellant.
Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that in the
medical report of Saidu Group of Teaching Hospital
(Ex PW 1/3), there is overwriting on the date of
operation. The Medical Officer has admitted it as
tampering and stated that it was not made by him. This,
too, is not material. The reason is that the date of
admission i.e. 10.12.2019, the next day of the
occurrence and the date of discharge i.e. 25.01.2020

are quite clear.

12, Coming to the recovery of incriminating
articles, the record shows that the bloodstained shirt,
one 30 bore pistol bearing No. 31012812 alongwith 13
rounds, blood and one empty of 30 bore were
recovered from the spot. As the appellant was also
arrested the same day while he was on the run from the
crime scene, the 30 bore pistol, the weapon of offence,
was recovered from his possession (Ex PC, Ex PC/1,
Ex PC/3 and Ex PC/4). The 30 bore pistol and the
empty were sent to the FSL, whose report was obtained
which is in positive. The empty and the pistol were
received in the FSL on 12.12.2019, within 72 hours of
the occurrence. Constable Nasrullah No. 563

(PW-3) and constable Akhtar Hussain No. 844 (PW-6)

Abdul Sabeoh!* (3.B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID [OBAL
-10-

gave evidence in support of the aforementioned

recoveries.

13. HC Manzoor Alam (PW-5) furnished
evidence of the fact that he and his colleague
Habibullah, another police official, overpowered the
appellant while he was running after the commission of
the offence. The very substantial fact of the decamping
of the appellant and his arrest by PW-5 and one
Habibullah, police official, could not be shattered

under cross-examination.

14, SHO Habib Said Khan (PW-9) recorded
the report of the incident in the emergency room of
THQ Hospital, Besham. He recorded the report
narrated to him by Bakht Amal, the complainant,
which he reduced into Murasila (Ex PA); obtained
consciousness certificate from Dr. Zafar Ali (Ex PW
1/2) on his application (Ex PW 9/1) and prepared the
injury sheet (Ex PW 9/2). His deposition shows that
the appellant having been arrested by PW-5, HC
Manzoor Alam and a 30 bore pistol found with him,
was produced to him, which he took into possession
and issued card of arrest of the appellant (Ex PW 9/3).
While under cross-examination, he stated that there is

no mention that the victim was unconscious. This fact

Abdul Sebook!* @.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IQBAL
-ll-
was explained by Dr. Zafar Ali (PW-1) coupled with

his report (Ex PW 1/2) in such a way that the victim
was found not vitally stable and not mentally alert and
active. He was asked about his entry into the daily
diary, to which he answered in affirmative though the

diary is not available on the record.

15. SI/OII Muhammad Saeed Khan (PW-10)
recorded statement of the victim in Batagram. His
statement recorded in his examination-in-chief reveals
that he obtained permission to go to Batagram for
recording statement of the victim. He also obtained the
medical report and the FSL report. The mere fact that
the victim happened to be in District Batagram and his
statement after having been recorded, could not be
seen as a material doubt. As discussed above, the
victim remained under treatment. While it may be said
that statement of the victim was recorded after about
seven days of his having been discharged from the
hospital, it appears that the victim was not traceable in
District Shangla. Moreover, this fact was not
challenged in cross-examination. Even otherwise, no
question of identification of the victim was put to
PW-10. SI/OII Sarbali Khan (PW-11) the investigating
officer prepared the site plan, recovered the
incriminating articles, arrested the appellant and got

Abdul Sabook!* G.B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID [OBAL
-12-

recorded statement of one Hazrat Ali u/s. 164, Cr. P.C.
He also deposed that during investigation, he
discovered that the real motive of the occurrence was
the suspicion of the appellant that the victim had illicit
relationship with his wife and pursuant to that the wife
of the appellant was murdered, in respect of which case
FIR No. 503 was registered on 09.12.2019, u/ss.
302/311/109, PPC, read with section 15-A.A, in Police
Station Besham. The site plan (Ex PB) shows that the
occurrence took place across the road in front of shop
of one Sherin Zada and Rahim Hotel was situated
across the road to the West of the crime scene. The
victim was found at point No. 1 and the appellant duly
armed with a pistol at point No. 2. The distance
between the two was shown as seven feet. The
eyewitness Muamber and Bakht Amal were shown at
points Nos. 3 and 4, respectively. They were at a
distance of 12 and 11 feet from the victim and the

appellant.

16. The conclusion of the above reappraisal of
evidence is that the occurrence took place in broad day
light in Besham bazaar, in presence of the eyewitness.
The appellant was known to the complainant party.
Both the complainant and the eyewitness furnished
plain, direct and cogent evidence to support the charge.

There is a strong motive of the occurrence which the
prosecution proved. The appellant was caught red
handed while decamping from the spot. The weapon of
offence i.e. point 30 bore pistol without license was
recovered from his possession, the empty was
recovered from the spot; both were examined in the
FSL, whose report was positive. The medical report
and the site plan substantiate the mode and manner in
which the occurrence took place. The appellant failed
to destroy the prosecution case convincingly and
cogently. The prosecution has successfully proved the
charge leveled against the appellant. Resultantly, J
uphold the conviction and sentence passed against the

appellant. The instant appeal is, thus, dismissed.
