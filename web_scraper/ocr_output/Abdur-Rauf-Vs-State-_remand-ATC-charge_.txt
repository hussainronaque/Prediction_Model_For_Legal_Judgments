JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, _J.- This

common judgment shall dispose of this appeal, filed by
appellant Abdur Rauf and connected Cr.A.No.568-P/2015,
filed by appellant Haji Rahim, as both are the outcome of
the same judgment dated 8.09.2015, of learned Judge Anti
Terrorism Court-I, Peshawar, whereby appellant Abdur
Rauf has been convicted under section 5 Explosive
Substance Act read with section 7 (ff) Anti Terrorism Act,
1997 and sentenced to undergo 14 years R.I. alongwith
forfeiture of his property, if any, in favour of the State,
whereas appellant Haji Rahim has been convicted under
section 11(w) Anti Terrorism Act, 1997 to undergo 01 year
R.I. and to pay a fine of Rs.50,000/- or in default thereof to
undergo 01 months S.I. further. Benefit of $.382-B Cr.P.C.

has been extended to them.

2. The prosecution case as unfolded in First
Information Report Exh.PA is that on receipt of
information about presence of Liagat, proclaimed offender
in case FIR No.43 dated 10.10.2014 under sections
365-A/302/148/149 PPC, Police Station C.T.D., in Ghari
Chandan Hari Chan area, within the criminal jurisdiction
of Police Station Mattani, Noor Ullah Jan Inspector (PW.1)
alongwith other police officials, rushed there, where on
seeing them, a young man having a polythene bag in his
hands, tried to flee away but was chased and overpowered.
On query, he disclosed his name as Abdur Rauf
(appellant). On search of the bag, explosive substance
weighing 2035 grams, 48 inches prima cord and three
detonators were recovered. He was formally arrested.
Murasila Exh.PA/1 was drafted and sent to Police Station
for registration of the case. During interrogation, he
disclosed the name of his accomplices as Haji Rahim
(co-appellant) and Kifayat Ullah (absconding co-accused).

3. On completion of investigation, challan was
submitted against the appellants before the learned Trial
Court, where they were formally charge sheeted, to which
they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To prove its case,
prosecution examined its evidence, on closure whereof,

statements of the appellants were record, wherein they

denied the prosecution allegations and professed their
innocence. They, however, declined to be examined on
oath or to produce evidence in defence. On conclusion of
trial, the learned Trial Court, after hearing both the sides
convicted and sentenced the appellants as mentioned
above, hence, these appeals.

4. During the course of arguments, it transpired
from the record that only explosive material has been
shown recovered from possession of appellant Abdur Rauf,
whereas there is nothing on record to show its use by the
petitioner. Mere possession of the explosive substance
without use, in a mosque, imambargah, church, temple or
any other place of worship in the Court premises, as
contemplated in the Third Schedule attached to Anti
Terrorism Act, 1997, therefore, mere possession of the
explosive substance does not fall within the ambit of Third
Schedule attached to Anti Terrorism Act, 1997, which read

as under:-

â€œ4, Without prejudice to the generality of
the above paragraph, the Anti Terrorism
Court to the exclusion of any other Court
shall try the offences relating to the
following, namely,

(i) Abduction or kidnapping or ransom;

(ii) use of fire-arms or explosives by any
device, including bomb blast in a mosque
imambargah, church, temple or any other place
of worship whether or not any hurt or damage is
cause thereby; or

(ii) firing or use of explosives by any device,
including bomb blast in the Court premises.

Thus, item No.4 mentioned above, shall be read in
conjunction to items No.1 to 3 of the Third Schedule,
which make it unambiguous that use of firearms or
explosive by any device will come within the ambit of the
schedule offence of Anti Terrorism Act, 1997, only in case
of its use in a mosque, imambargah, church, temple or any
other place of worship or court premises. Admittedly,
simple possession of the explosive material has also been
inserted in the Third Schedule attached to the Anti
Terrorism Act, 1997, but the insertion/ amendment is only
to the extent of Province of Punjab and not applicable to
the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In this view of the
matter, the case of the appellants falls under the Explosive
Substances Act, 1908, and would be triable by an ordinary
Court i.e. the Court of Sessions.

5. For what has been discussed above, we
without dilating upon the merits of the case in light of the
available evidence, lest it may prejudice the case of either

side, allow these appeals, set aside the impugned judgment

and send the case to the Ordinary Court/ Sessions Judge,
Peshawar for trial denovo, who shall either proceed with
the trial himself or entrust it to any Additional Sessions
Judge. The learned Trial Court shall conclude the trial as
early as possible but not later than two months from the
day of receipt of the record, avoiding unnecessary
adjournments except on reasonable ground, period of
which too, shall not exceed a week. During pendency of
trial, the appellants shall remain as under trial prisoners.
Office is directed to send the record to the learned Sessions
Judge, Peshawar, within two days, without fail.

6. The Additional Registrar (Judicial) of this
Court is directed to circulate copy of this judgment among
the learned Judges of the Anti Terrorism Courts, Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar for future guidance.
