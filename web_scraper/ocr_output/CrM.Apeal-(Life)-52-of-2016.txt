Assistant AG.

Complainant in person

SYED MUHAMMAD _ATTIQUE _SHAH, _J:-
Appellant-convict Yasir S/o Shamraiz has filed instant
appeal against the conviction and sentence recorded
against him by the learned Sessions Judge, Torghar at
Oghi, vide judgment and order dated 05.04.2016 in
case FIR No. 111 dated 15.07.2013 under Section
302/114/34 PPC of Police Station Darband, District
Mansehra, whereby the appellant-convict was
convicted under Section 302-B PPC and sentenced to
life imprisonment and to pay compensation amounting

to Rs. 100,000/- under Section 544-A Cr.P.C. to the
legal heirs of the deceased. Benefit of Section 382-B
Cr.P.C has been extended to him.

2. Brief facts of the case are that
Muhammad Nazir S/o Muhammad Faqir (PW-5)
reported the matter to Muhammad Zakir SHO (PW-2)
in CH Darband that after Aftar time, he was present in
his house. His nephew Muhammad Adeel left the
house after having Aftar and went towards Janazagah.
At about 08:30 PM, on hearing hue and cry, the
complainant also rushed towards Jianzagah and saw
that Yasir and Shamraiz were quarrelling with Adeel.
As soon as complainant reached there, Shamraiz
commanded his son Yasir to kill Adeel, as a result of
which Yasir inflicted knife blows to him on left side
of chest and on his back as a result of which Adeel
sustained injuries and fell on ground. Complainant
with the help of other persons present at the spot, lifted
the injured and was shifting him to hospital through
vehicle but he succumbed to injuries in the way.
Occurrence was stated to have been witnessed by Iqbal
S/o Umer Khan and Suleman S/o Mehmood. Motive
was disclosed to be a year back dispute between

accused and deceased over parking of vehicle. The
report was recorded by PW-1 in the shape of Murasila
(Ex PA/1) which was sent to police station for
registration of FIR (Ex PA).

3. Dead body of the deceased was sent for
postmortem examination. Autopsy on the dead body
of deceased was conducted by Dr. Hilal Hussain (PW-

3) who found the following injuries:-

i, Incised wound on left lateral wall of
the chest of % inch in size.
ii. Incised wound on fourth intercostal

space just below the left nipple, %
inch x % inch size.

iii. | Incised wound on left lateral side of
the thigh about midpoint % x 2 inch
in size.

iv. incised wound on upper part of left
hip area 1x% inch in size.

Investigation of the case was entrusted to
Muhammad Asif SI who visited the spot and prepared
site plan (Ex PW-6/1) upon  pointation of
eyewitnesses, arrested both the accused and issued
their cards of arrest (Ex PW-6/3) and during
interrogation, upon pointation of accused recovered
weapon of offence i.e. knife through memo (Ex PW-
6/5), sent parcels No. 1 and 2 along with recovered
knife to FSL through road certificate No. 157/21 and
on receipt of FSL report (Ex PW-6/9), placed in on

file. Upon completion of investigation he handed over
case file to SHO for submission of challan against the
accused.

4. The prosecution then submitted complete
challan against the appellant-convict as well as
acquitted co-accused Shamraiz.

5. After supplying copies to the accused in
compliance of Section 265-C Cr.P.C. the learned trial
Court framed charge against the appellant-convict and
acquitted co-accused on 22.10.2013 to which they
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution
was thus asked to produce its evidence. In order to
prove its case against the accused. Prosecution
produced and examined 07 PWs and closed its
evidence. The learned trial Court recorded statement
of the accused under Section 342 Cr.P.C. After hearing
arguments of learned counsel for the parties, the
learned trial Court convicted the appellant-convict
under Section 302-B PPC and sentenced him as

mentioned above, while co-accused Shamraiz was

acquitted of the charge.
6. Arguments heard and record perused.
Ds The prosecution case as set out on the

basis of material available on record is that on the
fateful night, an altercation took place between the
deceased and the accused. As a result of such
altercation, co-accused Shamraiz raised Lalkara
whereupon appellant-convict Yasir inflicted knife
blows to the deceased as a result of which he sustained
injuries and died. The occurrence was stated to have
been witnessed by Iqbal and Suelman while motive
was a previous dispute over parking of vehicle.

8. The prosecution case thus rests on the
oral testimony of complainant and eyewitnesses, the
recovery of crime weapon, postmortem report of the
deceased, motive as well as other incriminating
materials.

9. We will first examine the oral evidence of
the prosecution. Complainant in his report has stated
that at the time of occurrence, he was present in the
house and when he heard hue and cry, he rushed to the
spot and found that a quarrel had taken place in
between deceased and accused. When he reached
nearby, acquitted co-accused Shamraiz raised Lalkara
whereupon Yasir inflicted knife blows to deceased on
his chest as well as back, as a result of which he was

injured and fell on the ground. The complainant with
the help of other persons present at the spot, lifted the
deceased in injured condition and were shifting him
through vehicle to hospital but he succumbed to
injuries in the way. On the other hand, while appearing
as PW-S, he in his examination-in-chief deposed that
he lodged the report in police station and that the
accused was apprehended on the spot, which fact
negates the version of FIR as well as card of arrest of
the accused. Similarly, during his cross examination,
he deposed that he lodged the report in police station
and then took the dead body to hospital for
postmortem examination. He further deposed during
his cross examination that the deceased was lifted
from the house of Gulab and was being shifted to the
police station when he succumbed to injuries. Thus the
complainant has contracted his own report in his
statement recorded as PW-S. The alleged eyewitnesses
of the occurrence namely Iqbal and Suleman were
abandoned by the prosecution being won over and
except sole testimony of PW-5, the prosecution has not
produced any eyewitness of the occurrence, despite
the fact that as per complainant, there were many other

persons present at the spot at the time of alleged
occurrence. The statement of PW-5 being self
contradictory in nature, cannot be solely relied upon to
record conviction against the appellant-convict.

10. Moreover, the complainant in his report
mentioned that appellant-convict inflicted two injuries
with knife on the body of deceased, one on left side of
his chest and other on his back, while the postmortem
report of the deceased (Ex PW-3/1) shows four
injuries on the body of deceased, two on left side of
chest, one on thigh and one on upper part of left hip
area. Thus, the postmortem report also creates serious
doubt regarding stance of the complainant that he was
eyewitness of the occurrence. The complainant further
stated that he was very close to the deceased when the
accused attacked upon him, however, he neither tried
to rescue the deceased nor caught hold of the accused,
which conduct of the complainant makes his presence
at the spot doubtful. In a similar situation, in “Pathan
vs. The State (2015 SCMR 315)” the august Supreme
Court of Pakistan while dilating upon the conduct of
the witnesses, has held:-

“Keeping in view the

provision of Article 129 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
which is to the following

effect:--

"S. 129. Court may
presume existence of
certain facts.---The Court
may presume the existence
of any fact which it thinks
likely to have happened
regard being had to the
common course of natural
events, human conduct
and public and_ private
business, in their relation
to the facts of the
particular case-"

The presence of witnesses on
the crime spot due to their
unnatural conduct has
become highly doubtful,
therefore, no explicit reliance
can be placed on _ their
testimony. They had only
given photogenic /
photographic narration of the
occurrence but did nothing
nor took a single step to
rescue the deceased. The
causing of that much of stab
wounds on the deceased
loudly speaks that if these
three witnesses were present
on the spot, being close blood
relatives including the son,
they would have definitely
intervened, preventing the
accused from causing further
damage to the deceased
rather strong presumption
operates that the deceased
was done to death in a
merciless manner by the
culprit when he was at the
mercy of the latter and no one
was there for his rescue. In
similar circumstances, the
evidence of such eye-
witnesses was disbelieved by
this Court in the case of
Masood Ahmed and
Muhammad Ashraf v. The
State (1994 SCMR 6).

It was vehemently argued by
the learned Advocate
Supreme Court for the
appellant that on the day of
occurrence it was Sunday and
being a Gazetted holiday, the
appellant was not at all
required to attend to his
official duty at the school to
which he was attached and
for that reason the giving
company to him by his son
and by sheer chance the
joining of the other two P.Ws.
with them renders the
testimony of the P.Ws.
absolutely doubtful.”

Despite the fact that it was admitted by the
complainant (PW-5) that so many other persons were
present at the spot, none from them could be produced
as a witness in the case without any plausible
explanation, therefore, adverse inference would drawn
that had those witnesses been produced, they would
have not supported the prosecution case.

11. The IO while appearing as PW-6,
deposed that he could not recover any blood from the
spot, while complainant also stated in his cross

examination that the dead body of the deceased was
10

lifted from the house of Gulab which is situated nearby
the Jinazagah. This aspect of the case creates doubt in
in the scene of occurrence. Moreover, admittedly it
was a night occurrence, which had taken place on the
night of 5" of Ramazan. The complainant while
appearing as PW-5 stated that he identified the
accused in moon light. Whether it was possible for the
complainant or not to identify the culprits in the light
of moon on 5“ of Ramzan, is shrouded in mystery,
because the entire investigation is silent about the
source of light.

12. Now moving on to the recovery of knife,
the alleged crime weapon at the pointation of
appellant-convict. According to the prosecution, the
appellant-convict was arrested in the instant case on
16.07.2013 who on 17.07.2013 lead the police party to
the place of occurrence and got recovered the crime
knife from the bushes nearby the house of Gulab. The
alleged occurrence took place on 15.07.2013 while the
recovery was shown to have been effected on
17.07.2013 from bushes, which place admittedly was
accessible to everyone. The investigating officer of the

case (PW-6) during cross examination admitted that
11

no bushes were shown in the site plan nearby house of
Gulab or near the Jinazagah. He also admitted that the
recovered knife was an ordinary knife easily available
in every house and report of FSL does not suggest that
the blood found on the knife was that of deceased.
Moreover, the alleged knife was recovered in presence
of Ali Muhammad and Suleman. Both these witnesses
were never produced by the prosecution to strengthen
the recovery of knife upon pointatoin of accused,
therefore, the said piece of evidence also lost its
credence.

13. The complainant disclosed that the
occurrence was the result of previous dispute between
the accused and deceased over parking of vehicle
whereupon a quarrel had taken place a year back. In
order to support the motive, no evidence whatsoever
was brought on record, thus the motive also remained
unproved.

14. Coming to the Postmortem report of the
deceased. Though it suggests that the deceased had
sustained incised wounds on his body, however, the
complainant in his report as well as in his court

statement has himself contracted the mode and manner
of the occurrence, therefore, even if it is presumed that
the death of the deceased was result of injuries caused
to him through knife, it would not be sufficient to
record conviction against the appellant-convict.

15. The sifting of evidence and record
suggests that the prosecution case is full of dents and
doubts. The statement of lone prosecution eyewitness
i.e. complainant (PW-5) is self-contradictory, the
marginal witnesses to the recovery memo Ex PW-6/5
were never produced before the court. The most
important prosecution witnesses were abandoned by
the prosecution. The statements of persons residing
nearby the alleged scene of occurrence including
Gulab and Anwar were not recorded. The alleged
crime knife was sent to FSL, however, the report of
FSL does not suggest that the blood found on the knife
was that of deceased. No blood could be recovered
from the spot and there are serious doubts regarding
the place, time, mode and manner of the occurrence.
The eyewitnesses of the occurrence were never
produced to go through the test of cross examination.
The motive as alleged by the complainant, also

remained unproved. It is well settled law that even a
single doubt, if found reasonable, would entitle the
accused person to acquittal and not a combination of

several doubts. Reliance is placed on case titled

‘Ghulam Qadir Vs. The State’ (2008 SCMR 1221),

wherein, it has held that:

“It needs no reiteration that for
the purpose of giving benefit of
doubt to an accused person,
more than one infirmity is not
required, a_ single infirmity
crating reasonable doubt in the
mind of a reasonable and
prudent mind regarding the
truth of charge-makers the
whole case doubtful. Merely
because the burden is on
accused to prove his innocence
it does not absolve the
prosecution to prove its case
against the accused beyond any
shadow of doubt in this duty
does not change or vary in the
case.”

Reliance is also placed on case law
reported as 2009 SCMR 230, 1995 SCMR 1345, 2017
SCMR 596 and 2017 SCMR 709.
16. In view of the above, we hold that the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove its charge
against the appellant-convict, beyond any shadow of
doubt, therefore, while accepting this appeal, we set
aside the impugned conviction and sentence passed

against the appellant/convict and acquit him from the
14

charge leveled against him. He is in jail, he be set free
forthwith, if not required in any other case/crime.

17. These are the reasons for our short order
of the even date.
