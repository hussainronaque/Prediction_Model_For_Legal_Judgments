JUDGMENT
Date of hearing 06.11.2015
Appellant-petitioner Abdul Waheed by Malik Hidayat Ullah
Malana advocate
Respondent State and others by Mr. Kamran Hayat Khan
Miankhel Add: Advocate General for State and Mr. Muhammad

Ismail Khan Alizai advocate for complainant.

MUHAMMAD GHAZANFAR KHAN, J.- Through the
instant petition, the petitioner Abdul Waheed alias
Waheedullah has called in question the order dated
28.9.2015 rendered by learned Sessions Judge, Tank
whereby the concession of bail granted to him by learned
Judicial Magistrate-I], Tank in case FIR No.122 dated
07.7.2015 registered under sections 457/380/411 PPC at

police station Mulazai, District Tank, was recalled.

2. The allegations as contained in the FIR lodged
by Mst. Walia Bibi complainant on 07.7.2015 are that her
husband Rehmat Shah is abroad from the last about four
months and on the night of occurrence, she alongwith
children and mother were asleep in the courtyard of her
house when at about 02 AM, three persons duly armed
with Kalashnikovs entered the house and awakened her.

They demanded keys of the rooms and boxes which, due to
-2-

fear, were handed over to them. They committed theft of
cash amount of Rs.1,50,000/-, gold ornaments weighing
five tolas, sugar check machine, D.V.D and two Nokia

mobiles, hence the report.

3. The learned counsel for petitioner contended
that the petitioner is not directly charged in the FIR; that
there is delay in lodging he FIR which points towards
consultations and deliberations and that the petitioner was
rightly released on bail by the learned Judicial Magistrate
giving sound reasons, but the learned Sessions Judge, Tank
erred in recalling the bail, as grounds for grant of bail and

cancellation thereof are quite different.

4. On the contrary, learned counsel for the
complainant vehemently opposed the arguments of learned
counsel for the petitioner and contended that though the
petitioner has not been charged directly in the FIR, but he
has been charged in the statement of complainant recorded
under section 164 Cr.P.C. He further contended that
recovery of cash amount has been effected from physical
possession of the petitioner and that the offences with
which the petitioner is charged do fall within the
prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C, thus his bail has

rightly been cancelled by the learned Sessions Judge.

5. I have heard arguments of learned counsel for

the parties and have gone through the record.
6. Perusal of the record reveals that in the instant
case, the occurrence is alleged to have taken place on
07.7.2015 at 02 AM whereas the report has been lodged on
the same date at 09 AM i.e. with a delay of seven hours.
Admittedly no-one has been charged by name in the report
lodged by complainant. The accused/petitioner has been
charged for the first time on 09.7.2015 by the complainant
in her statement under section 164 Cr.P.C recorded by
learned Judicial Magistrate, wherein too, she has not
disclosed the source of her satisfaction. The only point
against the petitioner is recovery of cash amount of
Rs.41,030/- from his possession. It is yet to be seen at the
trial that whether the amount allegedly recovered from
possession of the petitioner is stolen amount or otherwise.
From the available record, the petitioner can be charged
with an offence under section 411 PPC, the punishment of
which does not fall within the prohibitory clause of section
497 Cr.P.C. Moreover, investigation in the case is
complete and the petitioner is no more required by the
local police for further investigation. All these factors, on
tentative assessment, make the case of petitioner one of

further inquiry entitling him for the grant of bail.

7. For the reasons mentioned above, the instant
petition is allowed and the petitioner is admitted to bail on

furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- (Rupees
-4-

three lac) with two sureties, each in the like amount, to the
satisfaction of Illaqa/Judicial Magistrate, who shall ensure

that the sureties are local, reliable and men of means.

8. These are the detailed reasons for my short
order of even date.
Announced.
