ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- Through this criminal
appeal under section 410 Cr.P.C., filed by Rukhtaj, the has
appellant, calls in question the legality and propriety of
judgment dated 09.06.2017, passed by learned trial
Court/Additional Sessions Judge-II, Mardan, whereby the
appellant having been found guilty of committing ‘Qatl-e-
Amd’ of Nauman deceased, has been convicted under
section 302 (b) PPC and sentenced to undergo life
imprisonment as Ta’azir and to pay Rs.1,00,000/-, as
compensation to legal heirs of the deceased in terms of
section 544-A Cr.P.C., and in default of payment thereof to
undergo 06 months S.I., in case FIR No.146 dated

23.02.2011, registered under sections 302/324/34 PPC and
section 15 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013, in Police
Station Ghari Kapoor, District Mardan.

2. According to First Information Report (FIR), on
23.02.2011 at 1300 hours, complainant Jehanzeb (PW.11),
in company of dead body of his nephew Nauman deceased,
reported to Zahir Shah SI( (PW.2) in casualty of District
Headquarter (DHQ) hospital Mardan, to the effect that on
the fateful day he alongwith the deceased was on the way
to Bazaar Adda situated near Mandi Aziz Khan Ghari
Kapora Mardan. The deceased was going a few paces
ahead of him when at 1215 hours, the appellant along with
Fida Hussain (absconding co-accused), duly armed with
firearms, emerged and opened indiscriminate firing him, as
a result, he got hit and died on the spot. Due to firing of the
accused, a passerby, namely, Intizar also sustained firearm
injuries. A previous blood feud between the deceased and
the accused has been advanced as a motive behind the
occurrence. Besides the complainant, the incident is stated
to have been witnessed by people present at the spot.
Report of the complainant was recorded in the shape of
Murasila Exh.PA/1 by Zahir Shah SI (PW.2), on the basis
of which FIR (Exh.PA) was registered in Police Station
Ghari Kapura. PW.5 also prepared injury sheet and inquest
report Exh.PW.2/1 and Exh.PW.2/2, respectively, of the
deceased as well as injury sheet Exh.PW.2/3 of injured

Intizar and referred the injured for medical treatment and
the dead body to the mortuary for postmortem
examination.

3. Dr. Amjad Kakakhel (PW.4), conducted autopsy
on the dead body of the deceased on 23.02.2011 at 01.10
a.m. and opined that firearm injuries to right lung and brain
of the deceased resulted into his death. He opined probable
time between injury and death as with thirty minutes and
between the death and postmortem within one hour.

4. Zahir Shah SI (PW.12) conducted investigation in
the case, who proceeded to the spot and prepared site plan
Exh.PB on the pointation of the complainant. During spot
inspection, he secured bloodstained earth from the place of
the deceased and injured Intizar vide recovery memos
Exh.PW.6/1 and Exh.Pw.6/3, respectively. Vide recovery
memo Exh.Pw.6/2 he took into possession two spent
bullets of 7.62 bore from the spot and through recovery
memo Exh.PW.6/4 the last worn bloodstained garments of
the deceased. Similarly, through recovery memo
Exh.PW.12/1 he took into possession the bloodstained
clothes of the deceased, sent the bloodstained articles to the
FSL for analysis, initiated proceedings under sections 204
and 87 Cr.P.C., against the accused, recorded statements of
the PWs including injured Intizar and handed over case file
to SHO for submission of challan under section 512

Cr.P.C. against the accused.
5. The appellant was arrested on 10.05.2015 and was
handed over to Iqbal Khan SI (PW.10), who obtained his
physical remand and_ interrogated him. During
interrogation, on the pointation of appellant, PW.10
recovered a 30 bore pistol without number from the tube
well concealed in a dump of bricks vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.10/3. He prepared sketch of the place of recovery
Exh.PW.10/4 and added section 15 KP Arms Act in the
case and sent the pistol along with fixed charger and 6 live
rounds Exh.P.1 to Armourer for examination.

6. On completion of investigation challan was
submitted against the appellant before the learned trial
Court where he was formally charge sheeted to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To substantiate the
guilt of the appellant, prosecution examined as many as
twelve witnesses. After closure of the prosecution evidence
statement of the appellant was recorded under section 342
Cr.P.C., wherein he denied the prosecution allegations and
professed innocence. He, however, declined to be
examined on oath under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. or to
produce evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial the
learned trial Court, after hearing both the sides convicted
and sentenced the appellant, as mentioned above, hence,

this appeal.
7. We have heard the exhaustive arguments of
learned counsel for the parties advanced at the bar and
perused the record with their able assistance.

8. In the initial report, complainant Jehanzeb and
injured Intizar are shown as eyewitnesses of the
occurrence. Besides them, other people present at the spot,
have also allegedly witnessed the incident, however, the
complainant neither in his report nor in his statement as
(PW.11), has disclosed the names of those persons.
Similarly, those persons have not been examined by the
Investigating Officer nor anyone from them has been
produced by the complainant in the witness box.

9. Complainant Jehanzeb is admittedly maternal
uncle of deceased, who posed himself as eye witness of an
occurrence, which was committed in sequence and
consequence of old enmity. Though his evidence is not to
be discarded as close relative and interested witness, but
the necessary caution has to be observed in accepting his
evidence, because it is generally approved proposition that
in case of rivalries and enmities, there is general tendency
that a person from victim side will pose himself as eye
witness of the occurrence and shall rope in the influential
members of rival side for participating in the assault, with a
particular designed role, therefore, the veracity of this
witness has to be examined with utmost care and caution.

On the analogy of above mentioned tendency of charging
accused in criminal cases, we are constrained to consider
the statement of complainant, who while appearing as
PW.11, in his examination-in-chief, reiterated the same
version as set forth by him in his initial report. In cross-
examination he deposed that he is running a motorcar
Bargain in village Ghari Kapura but is residing in
Mohallah Garhi Daulatzai, which is at a distance of 1 %
furlongs from the house of the deceased. He has not
furnished any explanation with regard to his visit to the
house of the deceased as well as his visit with the deceased
to the Adda Bazaar near Mandi Aziz Khan Ghari Kapoor
neither in the initial report nor in his statement. In cross-
examination when he was confronted about non-
mentioning of purpose of his visit to the house of the
deceased and then to the Adda Bazaar, he by making
dishonest improved stated that he visited the house of the
deceased so as to see his ailing niece i.e. the sister of the
deceased. His said niece has not been examined by the I.O
nor produced before the court so as to substantiate the
stance of the complainant. As admitted by the complainant,
he and the deceased were the residents of different
Mohallahs and that during the days of occurrence he was
indulged in the business of motorcar bargain. In this view
of the matter, firstly he falls within the definition of related
witness and secondly he be termed as chance witness,

because he resides in a separate house at different place i.e.
Mohallah Ghari Daulatzai situated at a distance of more-
than one furlong from the house of his nephew and niece.
Indeed he is a person who in the normal course is not
supposed to be present on the crime spot. He has not
offered cogent, convincing and believable explanation to
justify his presence at the spot. In his report, he has
categorically mentioned that after receiving injuries, the
deceased died at the spot, whereas, according to statement
of doctor Amjad Kakakhel (PW.4), probable time between
injuries and death was within thirty minutes, meaning
thereby that death of the deceased was not instantaneous as
alleged by the complainant. Contradicting his own version
in last portion of his cross-examination the complainant
deposed that the dead body of the deceased was shifted to
the hospital at 12.15 hours and report was written at 1300
hours. He further deposed that the dead body was already
shifted for postmortem examination and in the Police Post
the I.O. recorded his report. In the Murasila Exh.PA/1 the
complainant (PW.11) has given the time of occurrence as
12.15 p.m. and time of report as 1300 hours. If the
occurrence took place at 12.15 p.m. then how the
complainant lodged report at 12.15 p.m. in the hospital as
alleged by him in the cross-examination. Similarly, no
report written in any Police Post is available on file.
Statement of complainant that the deceased was already

shifted for postmortem and he made report to the I.O. in
Police Post, is suggestive of the fact that the dead body of
the deceased had already been shifted to the hospital by
people, and he reached after him and lodged the report. In
the occurrence in the broad daylight role of indiscriminate
firing was attributed to two accused including the appellant
by complainant, who has admitted that he can differentiate
between various kinds of weapons, but in his report he has
not specifically disclosed the descriptions or caliber of the
weapons allegedly used by the accused. We are conscious
of the fact that disclosing the description of weapon is not
necessary by the complainant but for a person, who posed
himself as eye witness and conversant with different kind
of weapon and remained mum about the kind of weapon
then invariably inference can be drawn that complainant
was not present on spot and was not taking risk to
contradict the recovery from spot and medical examination,
because lateron, three spent bullets of 7.62 bore have been
shown recovered from the spot which indicate the use of
Kalashnikov in the commission of offence. Likewise, in
the sketch of site (Exh.PB) the deceased has been shown at
point No.1 and complainant at point No.2. As per version
of complainant, at the time of occurrence, the deceased was
a few paces ahead of him. In this view of the matter the
complainant behind the deceased was also in direct firing
range of the appellant, but astonishingly he was not

targeted. According to complainant, he and deceased left
the house together for market just to get a round in bazaar.
In such a situation, i.e. during walk, the close relative like
uncle and nephew shall go along for chatting to each other.
Keeping sixteen paces distance by the uncle and going
behind the nephew is not only against the norms and
custom prevailing in the area, but also not appealable to
prudent mind. All the above facts and circumstances create
serious doubt about presence of the complainant at the spot
at the time of occurrence, hence his deposition being
interest and chance witness cannot be believed, resultantly
cannot be based for conviction of appellant. The place of
occurrence is a thoroughfare surrounded by from two sides
i.e. North and South by houses and shops but no person has
come forward to furnish the ocular account of the
occurrence or at least to the extent of presence of the
complainant at the spot at the time of occurrence. In case
titled, “Mst. Rukhsana Begum and others Vs Sajjad and
others” (2017 SCMR 596), it has been held by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court that single doubt reasonably shown that a
witness’s presence on the crime spot was doubtful during
the occurrence, it would be sufficient to discard his
testimony as a whole and that said principle may be
pressed into service in case where such witness was

seriously inimical or appeared to be chance witness.

Similarly, in case titled, “Muhammad Ali Vs the Stat”
10

(2017 SCMR_ 1468) it has been held by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court that:-

“A bare look at the site plan of the place of
occurrence shows that the incident in issue had
taken place at an open and uninhabited place. The
ocular account of the incident in issue had been
furnished before the trial Court by two
eyewitnesses and they were Shaukat Ali
complainant (PW.7) and Atta Muhammad (PW.8).
Both the said eyewitnesses were very closely
related to Mst. Naseem Bibi deceased inasmuch as
the complainant was a brother of the deceased and
the other eyewitness was an uncle of the deceased.
Both the said related eyewitnesses were also
chance witnesses as both of them lived about three
miles away from the scene of the crime. In the FIR
the reason stated for their availability at the spot at
the relevant time was that they were proceeding in
connection with a personal work but no such
personal work had been disclosed in the FIR. We
have gone through the statements made by the said
eyewitnesses before the trial court and have
pertinently observed that both the — said
eyewitnesses had advanced no reason whatsoever
before the trial Court explaining why they were
present at the spot at the relevant time. Such

related _and_chance_ witnesses who did_not

explain any particular reason for their
availability at the scene of the crime could not
readily be believed and this is more so when
they did not receive any independent
corroboration.”. (Emphasis supplied).

10. In the site plan Exh.PB, prepared at the pointation

of the complainant, besides introducing new events therein
one Fawad has also been introduced as eyewitness of the
occurrence and his presence has been shown at point No.3

therein. Similarly, in the site plan the role of running in the
11

Bazaar by the accused after the occurrence has been shown
followed by firing at the injured Intizar. All these events do
not find mention in the initial report of the complainant. In
the site plan injured Intizar has been shown at point No.7
where he allegedly received injuries which is not only
situated in different street/Bazaar of Ghari Gumbat road
falling at a distance of 720 feet from the place of the
deceased, but is also not visible from the place where the
complainant and alleged eye witness have posted in the
sketch of site of occurrence. Thus, the site plan Exh.PB
does not corroborate the version of complainant. The above
named subsequently introduced eyewitness, Fawad was
abandoned during trial. Similarly, injured Intizar, who was
an impartial witness, was also abandoned by the
prosecution which amounts to withholding of best
available evidence, hence, an adverse inference within the
meaning of Article 129 (g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984 will be drawn against the prosecution that had the
injured witness been produced in the witness box, he
would not have supported the prosecution case.

11. As regards, recovery of bloodstained earth from
the spot, the last worn bloodstained garments of the
deceased, positive Serologist in respect thereof as well as
medical evidence prove the unnatural death of the deceased
with firearms at the spot, but do not tell the name(s) of the

culprits. Besides, such pieces of evidence are always taken
12

into consideration in aid of the direct evidence and not in
isolation. In the preceding para-9 of this judgment the
direct evidence furnished by the purported eyewitness
Jehanze (PW.11), has already been disbelieved, therefore,
these corroborative pieces of evidence would not advance
the prosecution case.

12. So far as recovery of 30 bore pistol shown
recovered from the appellant is concerned, firstly it has not
been proved as weapon of offence because only spent
bullet of 7.62 have been shown recovered from spot and
secondly under said charge the appellant has been acquitted
and no appeal against acquittal has been filed by the State.
12. For what has been discussed above, the
prosecution has miserable failed to prove the guilt of the
appellant beyond reasonable doubt and also that the
purported eyewitness produced by the prosecution in
support of its case was nothing but planted and procured.
The learned trial Court by not appreciating the evidence in
its true perspective has landed into the field of error by
holding the appellant guilt of the offence, hence, conviction
and sentence of the appellant recorded by the learned trial
court are not sustainable in the eye of law.

13. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed, conviction and
sentences of the appellant recorded by the learned trial
Court vide impugned judgment dated 09.06.2017, are

hereby set aside. The appellant is acquitted of the charge
13

leveled against him in the instant case. He be set at liberty
forthwith, if not confined in any other case.

14. These are the reasons of our short order of even
date which is reproduced below:-

For reasons to be recorded later, we, allow this
appeal, set-aside the conviction and sentence of
the appellant, namely, Rukhtaj son of Khan
Dad, recorded under section 302 (b) PPC by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, Mardan
vide judgment dated 09.06.2017, in case FIR
No.146 dated 23.02.2011, registered under
sections 302/324/34 PPC and section 15 KP
Arms Act, 2013, Police Station Garhi Kapoora,
and hereby acquit him of the charge in the cited
case. He be set at liberty forthwith, if not
confined in any other case.
