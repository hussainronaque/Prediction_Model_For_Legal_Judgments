ROOH-UL-AMIN_KHAN,__J:- Appellant Haris has filed the
instant criminal appeal against the judgment dated 20.03.2021,

registered under section 302 PPC, at Police Station Cantt. Kohat.

2. For confirmation of death sentence of the convict Haris,
the learned Trial Court has sent Murder Reference No.8 of 2021.

Since, both the matters are the outcome of one and the same
judgment of the learned Trial Court dated 20.03.2021, therefore, we
propose to decide and answer the same through this common
judgment.

3. The prosecution’s case as unfolded in First Information
Report (“FIR”) Exh.PW.12/1 is that on 26.06.2019 at 2035 hours,
complainant Zahoor Khan (PW.10) along with his brother Faiz

Kohat Development Authority (KDA) hospital Kohat, to the effect
that on the eventful day i.e. 26.06.2019 at evening time “Sham
Vella” he along with his brother Faiz Ullah was going towards
Madrassa Amer Ma’avia, situated in village Muhammadzai Kohat.
They noticed at some distance his son Abdullah sitting with
appellant Haris and busy in chit chat. They suddenly heard report of
fire shot and saw appellant Haris running from the spot. They
rushed towards his son Abdullay lying dead in the pool of blood.
Their co-villagers attracted to the spot and lifted the deceased. He
does not know as to why the appellant committed murder of the
deceased. Report of complainant was recorded in the shape of
Murasila Exh.PW.8/1 by Gulzar Khan ASHO (PW.8), which was
thumb impressed by him as well as his brother Faiz Ullah as
verifier. Gulzar Khan ASHO (PW.8), prepared injury sheet

if!

4. On 26.06.2019, Dr. Javed Ullah (PW.5), conducted
autopsy on the dead body of Abdullah deceased and found the
following injuries on his body vide postmortem report Exh.PM:-

1. Firearm entry wound on left hypochondrum
size 11 cm with charring marks.

2. Exit wound on left lower back 2x2 cm.
Walla and peritoneum perforated. Stomach was
injured. Spleen shattered and left kidney
injured.

Qpinion: According to his opinion death of the deceased occurred
due to excessive bleeding from his spleen, left kidney and stomach
leading to shock and death.

Probable time between injury and death is opined as: 30 to 60
minutes and between death and postmortem 30 to 60 minutes.

5. On receipt of copy of FIR, Yousaf Khan OII (PW.2),
proceeded to the spot and prepared site plan Exh.PB on the
pointation of complainant Zahoor Khan. During spot inspection, he
secured bloodstained pebbles and bloodstained earth Exh.PA from
the place of the deceased vide recovery memo Exh.PW.2/1 and one
crime empty of 30 bore Exh.PB. Vide recovery memo Exh.PW.2/2
he took into possession the last worn bloodstained garments of the
deceased having bullet mark Exh.PZ, recorded statements of the
PWs under section 161 Cr.P.C. On 03.07.2019 Kariman Ali SHO
(PW.6), arrested the appellant during raid on his house and
recovered 30 bore pistol bearing No.1929, having fixed charger and
two spare chargers containing 34 live rounds of the same bore from

folding of his shalwar vide recovery memo Exh.PW.6/1. In this
ff

regard, he registered separate case under section 15 KP Arms Act
2013 against the appellant. He handed over the appellant to
Muhammad Iqbal SI (PW.4) along with arrest card, who obtained
two days physical custody of the appellant from the court of learned
Judicial Magistrate. Moharrir of the Police Station handed over him
the pistol recovered from the appellant and he sent the bloodstained
articles, empty and pistol to the FSL vide application Exh.PW.4/3
and road certificate is Exh.PW.3/2 reports whereof are Exh.PK/1
and Exh.PK./2. He annexed copy of register No.19 with record
which is Exh.PW.4/5. After completion of investigation he handed
over case file to the SHO, who submitted challan against the
appellant before the learned trial Court.

6. On receipt of challan by the learned Trial Court, the
appellant was summoned and formally charge sheeted under section
302 PPC to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To prove
its case, the prosecution examined as many as twelve witnesses.
After closure of the prosecution’s evidence, statement of the
appellant was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein he
denied the prosecution’s allegation and professed his innocence.
He, however, neither wished to be examined on oath under section
340(2) Cr.P.C. nor opted to produce evidence in defence. On
conclusion of trial, the learned Trial Court after hearing both the
sides, convicted and sentenced the appellant as mentioned above,

hence, this appeal.
7. We have heard the exhaustive submissions of learned
counsel for the parties and perused the evidence and record with
their able assistance.
8. According to FIR, occurrence in this case has taken place
on 26.06.2019 at Sham Vela, which has been reported on the same
day at 2035 hours, in emergency room of KDA hospital Kohat at by
Zahoor Khan (PW.12), father of Abdullah deceased, wherein he has
directly and singularly charged appellant Haris for murder of the
deceased with firearm. No doubt, appellant is directly and
singularly charged for murder of the deceased and substitution of
accused in such like cases is a rare phenomenon, however, it has
been held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled, “Dr. Israr
ul_ Haq vs Muhammad Fayyaz and another” (2007 SCMR
1427), that such phenomenon depends from case to case. It is
settled principle of law that for recording conviction strong and
corroborative evidence of unimpeachable character is required and
that findings of guilt against accused must not be based on
probabilities to be inferred from evidence, rather, must rest surely
and firmly on the evidence of unimpeachable character, otherwise,
the golden rule of benefit of doubt would be reduced to naught. It is
also settled principle of law that a witness who claims to be the
eyewitness of the occurrence, must prove his presence at the spot at
, / the time of occurrence and shall satisfy mind of the Court qua his
io presence through some physical circumstances or corroborative
evidence. We are also mindful of the dictum laid down by the

Hon’ble apex Court in case titled, “Mst. Sughra Begum and
pe

another vs Qaisar Pervez and others” (2015 SCMR 1142), that
ocular account in cases of Qatl-e-amd plays a decisive and vital role
and once its intrinsic worth is accepted and believed then rest of the
evidence, both circumstantial and corroborative, will be required as

a matter of caution. To the contrary, once the ocular account was

disbelieved then no other evidence, even of a high degree and
value, will be sufficient for recording conviction on a capital
charge, therefore, probative value of the ocular account has to be
seen in light of the facts and circumstances of each case.

9. Taking the case in hand at the touch stone of the
principles laid down by the august apex Court in the judgments
(supra), we will evaluate first the ocular account furnished by
Zahoor Khanh (PW.10), who is father of the deceased. In this view
of the matter his testimony has to be subjected to close scrutiny,
whereas, PW Faiz Ullah, the other alleged eyewitness has been
abandoned by the prosecution.

10. Zahoor Khan complainant while appearing as PW.10, in
his examination-in-chief reiterated the same story as set forth by
him in his initial report Exh.PW.8/1, which has already been
referred in earlier part of the judgment, therefore, in order to avoid
repetition the same is not reproduce, however, he added in his court
statement that he came to know about motive behind the occurrence
that the appellant was forbidding the deceased from friendship with
one Hobaib. In cross-examination, he stated that he is an electrician
by profession and during the days of occurrence was working at

Kohat Tunnel whereas PW Faiz Ullah was employed at Babri
cotton Mills Kohat, situated on Bannu road Kohat. From the
statement of complainant it is manifest that he is a chance witness.
As per ratio of judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case
titled, “Mst. Rukhsana Begum and others vs Sajjad and others”
(2017 SCMNR 596), chance witness was one who, in the normal
course was not supposed to be present on the crime spot unless he
offered cogent, convincing and believable explanation, justifying
his presence at the spot. He has not mentioned clearly time of

occurrence in his initial report Exh.PW.8/1 rather has disclosed it as
“Sham Vella”. He admitted it correct that he can read a watch.
Neither in his report nor in his court statement the complainant has
disclosed the name of any persons who attracted to the spot and
lifted the deceased. He further stated that there were about 30
religious teachers and 100 students in the Madrassah Ameer
Ma’avia and that his deceased son was also a student of the said
Madrassa. In his report Exh.PW.8/1, complainant has not
mentioned that that he witnessed the appellant while firing at the
deceased, rather his assertion is that “suddenly they heard report
of fire shot and saw the appellant running from the spot”. He
has not uttered a single word that he witness the appellant while
firing at the deceased. Similarly, he has also not mentioned that he
noticed the appellant armed with pistol or any other arm, while
running from the spot. While making dishonest improvement to
bring his testimony in line with the prosecution case he in cross-
examination denied the suggestion of defence that he had not

witnessed the appellant while firing at the deceased. He also
contradicted the place of occurrence by stating that the same is not
situated inside the guava orchard rather closed to the guava orchard,
whereas, as per site plan the place of occurrence is situated inside
the guava orchard. He also contradicted statement of Yousaf Khan
OIl (PW.2), who had conducted initial investigation in the case. As
per statement of Yousaf Khan OII (PW.2), he prepared site plan on
the pointation of complainant Zahoor Khan and during spot
inspection secured bloodstained pebbles and one 30 bore crime
empty. Contrary, complainant Zahoor Khan has stated in his
statement that no crime empty was recovered by the I.O. in his
presence during spot inspection. He further stated that distance
between the street and the spot where his deceased son was fired at
might be 7/8 feet and people of the village used the said street while
going to Madrassah. Not a single person has been produced by him
or examined by the I.O. to substantiate presence of complainant at
the spot at the time of occurrence. Medical evidence also belies the
testimony of complainant. He deposed that after receiving fire shot
the deceased died there and then at the spot. Contrary, as per
postmortem report Exh.PM and statement of Dr. Javed Ullah
(PW.5), probable time between injury and death is 30 to 60.
minutes, meaning thereby that the deceased at the most had not
succumb to injuries at the spot. The peculiar facts and
circumstances of the case discussed above convince a prudent mind
that the deceased was shifted to the hospital in injured condition by
the villagers where attendance of the complainant was procured and

thereafter he lodged report. In support of our view we will refer to
ff’

™,

inquest report of the deceased wherein one Shahid (PW.11) and
Sultan are the identifiers of the dead body of the deceased. Had the
complainant and PW Faiz Ullah, father and uncle of the deceased
present in the hospital the scriber of the Murasila and inquest report
must have mentioned their names in the inquest report. Besides, it is
admitted by complainant in his statement that distance between his
house and the place of occurrence can be covered within 10 minutes
while going on foot to the spot in normal routine. In this view of the
matter, the complainant being not an eyewitness of the occurrence
and did not know about its time has purposely mentioned at random
the time of incident as “Sham Vela”. Had he been present at the
spot at the time of occurrence he would have narrated the accurate
time of occurrence and actual condition of the deceased at the spot
because.

11. On reappraisal of the testimony of complainant Zahoor
Khan (PW.12), we are firm in our view to hold that he was not
present at the time of occurrence, as such is a procured witness. He
has not furnished any explanation, much less plausible, about his
presence at the spot along with his brother at the time of
occurrence. He has also failed to prove his presence at the spot at
the time of occurrence through some strong physical circumstance.
It is settled law that testimony of a chance witness is ordinarily not
accepted unless justifiable reasons are shown to establish his
presence at the crime scene at the relevant time, because in normal
course, the presumption under the law would be that such witness

was absent from the crime spot.
10

12. Adverting to circumstantial piece of evidence relied upon
by the prosecution and believed by the learned trial Court ice.
recovery of 30 bore pistol No.1929 Exh.P.1, from possession of the
appellant and positive FSL report about the said pistol with 30 bore
crime empty allegedly recovered by Yousaf Khan Oll/Investigating
Officer (PW.2). As stated earlier, complainant Zahoor Khan ASI
(PW.10), in his statement has categorically denied recovery of any
30 bore crime empty from the spot by the 1.0. in his presence.
Besides, the 30 bore crime empty has been shown recovered from
the spot by the 1.0. on 26.06.2019 but the same has not been sent to
the FSL on the same day, rather was allegedly handed over by him
to Moharrir of the Police Station for safe custody. The appellant has
been shown arrested on 03.07.2019 by Kariman Ali SHO (PW.6)
during raid on his house. Kriman Ali SHO (PW.6) deposed that on
receipt of spy information about presence of the appellant in his
house, on 03.07.2019, he raided his house, arrested him and
recovered a 30 bore pistol No.1929 having fixed charger and two
spare chargers containing 34 live rounds of the same bore from
folding of shalwar of the appellant. In cross-examination he stated
that he had not given copy of daily diary to the 1.0. showing his
departure and return to Police Station on 03.07.2019. He admitted
that there were residential houses around the house of the appellant.
He further admitted it correct that he has not associated any elder of
the locality during raid and recovery proceedings. He also admitted
it correct that the appellant had not made any resistance at the time

of his arrest. Alam Zeb Khan IHC (PW.1) is marginal witness to
11

recovery memo Exh.PW.1/1 vide which the above mentioned pistol
and ammunitions were taken into possession by the IO.
Muhammad Iqbal SI (PW.4) has stated that he has not recorded
statement of the SHO who had recovered the aforesaid pistol from
the appellant and that he had not investigated ownership of the
pistol in question. He admitted it correct that SHO only handed
over him the appellant and his arrest card and not the pistol and
ammunition etc. He further stated that on 04.07.2019, Moharrir of
the Police Station handed over him the recovered pistol. Arrest of
the appellant inside his house without associating any note-able of
the area coupled with the factum of no resistance of the appellant,
create the serious doubt about in the recovery of the alleged crime
pistol because it does not appeal to a prudent mind that a person
charged for murder would keep pistol in folding of his shalwar
inside his house and will not make any effort to escape on noticing
the police officials. In view of the above, we are firm in our view to
hold that pistol and ammunitions shown recovered from the
appellant is a planted piece of evidence on the part of the LO. just
to strengthen the prosecution’s case. Besides, the alleged crime
empty of 30 bore has been shown recovered from the spot on
26.06.2019 and the crime pistol on 03.07.2019. As stated earlier the
empty has not been sent to the FSL on the same day i.e. 26.06.2019.
Similarly, the pistol along with crime empty has also not been sent
to the FSL on 03.07.2019, rather sent to the FSL on 09.07.2019.
Where the empty and the pistol remained during the said period and

whether these were in safe custody or otherwise, no explanation,
12

much less plausible has been furnished by the prosecution in this
regard. No doubt, FSL report Exh PK/1 about the crime empty and
pistol is in positive but in a case titled Ghulam Akbar and
another Vs. The State (2008 SCMR-1064), it has been observed
by the Hon’ble Supreme Court that law requires that empty
recovered from the spot should be sent to the laboratory without
any delay, failing which such recovery evidence would not be free
from doubt and could not be used against the accused. Again in the
case of Jehangir Vs. Nazer Farid and another (2002 SCMR-
1986), the receipt of crime empties in the Forensic Science
Laboratory after seven days was not only condemned but it was
treated as of no assistance to the prosecution or for that matter
against the accused. Reliance is also placed on a case law titled
“Muhammad Younus Khan Vs. The State” (1992 SCMR-545).
It was also observed in the case of Attaullah and others Vs. The
State (PLD 1990 Peshawar-10), that the crime empties should be
immediately dispatched to Arms Expert and should not be kept by
the Investigating Officer because in that case objection regarding
manipulation of recovery will hold good. It is, by now, well
established proposition of law that if the crime empty is sent to the
Forensic Science Laboratory after the arrest of the accused or
+ together with the crime weapon, the positive report of the said
/ / Laboratory loses its evidentiary value. Reliance in this respect is
placed on the case of “Jehangir vs. Nazar Farid_and_another”
(2002 SCMR 1986), “Israr Ali vs. The State” (2007 SCMR 525)
and “Ali Sher and others vs. The State” (2008 SCMR_ 707).
13

Besides, when we have already disbelieved the ocular account, such
mysterious recoveries would not be sufficient for recording
conviction of accused in capital charge, because this type of
corroborative pieces of evidence are always taken into
consideration along with direct evidence. In case titled, “Noor
Muhammad Vs the State and another” (2010 SCMR 97), it has
been held by the august Supreme Court that recovery of crime
empty or rifle with matching report of FSL is a corroborative piece
of evidence, which by itself is not sufficient for conviction of the
accused in absence of substantive evidence.

13. Motive part of the prosecution story also remained
shrouded in mystery. Hobaib from whose company and friendship,
the appellant was allegedly forbidding the deceased has neither
been examined by the IO. nor produced in the witness box.
Similarly, no other proof in respect of motive has been brought on
record by the prosecution.

14. As far as medical evidence is concerned, on one hand it
is in conflict with the ocular version of the prosecution’s case,
while on the other hand, medical evidence is only supporting piece
of evidence, which may confirm the ocular account with regard to
receipt of injury, nature of the injury, kind of weapon used in the
occurrence but it would not tell the name of the assailant. Reference
in this context may be made to the cases of “Muhammad

Tasaweer versus Hafiz Zulkarnain and 2 others” (PLD 2009 SC

53), “Altaf Hussain versus Fakhar Hussain and another” (2008

14

SCMR_ 1103) and “Mursal_ Kazmi_ alias Qamar Shah and
another versus The State” (2009 SCMR 1410).

15. It is settled law that prosecution is duty bound to prove
its case against the accused beyond any reasonable doubt and if
any single doubt arises, benefit of the same must be given to
accused as the accused is always considered a most favourable
child of law. Guidance in this regard can be derived from case
titled, “Tariq Pervaz Vs the State” (1995 SCMR 1345) and case
titled, “Muhammad Akram Vs the State (2009 SCMR 230) and
Faryad Alis case (2008 SCMR 1086).

16. The learned Trial Court failed to appreciate the evidence
available on record in its true perspective, thus, has arrived at an
erroneous conclusion by holding the appellant guilty of the
offence, hence, the impugned judgment is not sustainable, as such,
is liable to be set aside. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed. The
impugned judgment along with conviction and sentence of the
appellant recorded therein, is hereby set aside and the appellant is
acquitted of the charge leveled against him. He be set at liberty
forthwith, if not wanted to be detained in any other case.

17. On ‘acquittal of the appellant-convict, the Murder

Reference No.08 of 2021, sent by the learned Trial Court, is
answered in the Negative.
18. These are the reasons of our short order of even date,
which is reproduced below:-
