AHMAD ALT, J.-The appellant Muhammad Saleem, has filed
instant appeal against acquittal of respondentsvide judgment
and order dated 07.02.2019 passed by Additional Sessions
Judge-I, Haripur, in case FIR No. 372 dated 12.12.2012 under
Section 302/34 PPC of Police Station KTS, District Haripur.

2. Brief fact of the case are that the grandfather of
the deceased namely Muhammad Saleem reported the matter
to the local police at the spot on 12.12.2012 at 11:40 hours to
the effect that his grandson Ansar Ahmed aged about 18 years
left the house for offering Isha Prayers but did not return, on
which they started his search in the nearby vicinity and also
inquired about him from his friends and relatives, but could

not find him. In the morning, the son of the complainant

informed him that the deceased was murdered and his dead
body was lying in the way leading to Committee Ground Dor.
The complainant rushed to the spot and found the dead body
of his deceased grandson. No one was charged by the
complainant in his initial report, nor any enmity with anyone
was disclosed. On the following day, i.e. on 13.12.2012,
complainant recorded his supplementary statement under
Section 161 Cr.P.C wherein he charged the respondents for
the murder of deceased. Upon completion of investigation,
the local police submitted complete challan against the
respondents for trial.

3. The learned trial court framed charge against the
accused/respondents and directed prosecution to produce its
evidence. Upon conclusion of evidence, statements of
accused/respondents were recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C.
and ultimately, vide judgment and order dated 07.02.2019, the
learned trial court acquitted the accused/respondents from the
charge levelled against them, hence the instant appeal.

4. Learned counsel for the appellant was served,
however, not in attendance today, therefore, the available
record was sifted.

5. Perusal of the record reveals that it was a blind

murder and there was no eyewitness of the occurrence,
therefore, the entire prosecution cases rests upon
circumstantial evidence i.e. recovery of dead body from the
spot, recovery of blood and one empty from the place of
occurrence, Postmortem report of the deceased, recovery of
crime weapon and_ confessional statement of
accused/respondent Jawad Ali Shah.

6. PW-14 in his statement deposed that they were in
search of the deceased when his son namely Nasir Jameel
informed him that the dead body of the deceased was lying on
the place of occurrence. The complainant thus rushed to the
spot and upon arrival of the police, made report. The son of
the complainant namely Nasir Jameel, however, never
informed the police about the presence of dead body of the
deceased at the spot, rather he rushed towards the
complainant and informed him about the presence of dead
body of the deceased at the spot.

The dead body of the deceased was then shifted to
hospital where Dr. Tahir Aziz Chughtai, (PW-1) conducted
the autopsy on the dead body of the deceased following
injuries:-

i. Entry wound measuring 2x % cm at lower end of

left ear of the face.
ii. | Exit wound measuring I x 1 cm at front side of right

ear of face.

Thus the postmortem report Ex PW-1/1 confirms
that the death of the deceased was the result of firearm injury.
7. The respondents were charged by the
complainant through his supplementary statement recorded on
13.12.2012. In the said statement, the complainant neither
mentioned any source of his satisfaction regarding
involvement of the respondents in the commission of offence,
nor any motive could be put forth, which resulted in the
commission of murder of the deceased by the
accused/respondents.

8. The prosecution seeks corroboration from
recovery of one empty of 30 bore from the spot and recovery
of pistol from the accused/respondent Faraz Hussain Shah, at
the time of his arrest. The evidence on record, however,
suggests that the IO visited the spot and recovered blood
stained stones and two bullets during spot inspection through
recovery memo Ex PW-10/1, while on the same day, through
a separate recovery memo Ex PW-4/1, the IO recovered one
empty of 30 bore. The marginal witnesses of both the
recovery memos are different and the marginal witness to

recovery memos Ex PW-10/l1 & Ex PW-4/1 materially

contradicted the investigating officer. Moreover, the
preparation of two separate recovery memos at the same spot,
during the same proceedings, does not appeal to a prudent
mind and create a reasonable doubt in recovery of empty from
the spot.

9. So far as recovery of pistol from possession of
accused/respondent Faraz Hussain Shah, is concerned. The
said recovery is witnessed by PW-11 Akhtar Mehmood. He
states that accused Faraz Hussain Shah was arrested on
14.12.2012 at 12:30 PM and in his presence, the crime pistol
was recovered from the possession of Faraz Hussain which
was taken into possession through memo Ex PW-11/1. He
further stated that accused Jawad Ali Shah was not with the
police at the time of arrest of accused Faraz Hussain Shah.
The investigating officer of the case (PW-15) on the other
hand, negated the stance of PW-11, by stating that at the time
of arrest of Faraz Hussain Shah, he was alone and none else
was present there. He further contradicted PW-11 by stating
that accused Jawad Ali Shah was with them at the time of
arrest of accused Faraz Hussain Shah. Thus not only the
recovery of empty from the spot of occurrence is doubtful,

rather the recovery of pistol from the possession of

respondent Faraz Hussain Shah is also full of doubts.

10. So far as confessional statement of the
respondent-accused is concerned, record shows | that
respondent/accused Jawad Ali Shah was arrested on
14.12.2012 and remained in police custody till 17.12.2012.
the confessional statement of the respondent Jawad Ali Shah
was recorded by PW-12. In her statement, PW-12 stated that
accused might have been produced before her at 08:30 to
08:45 AM. She gave him time to ponder over his confession
and after an hour. The accused was produced before the Court
for confessional statement by Shamraiz Khan (PW-6). He
states that he produced the accused before the Court for
recording his confessional statement at 10:00 AM. When the
statement of PW-6 and PW-12, is read in juxtaposition, it
seems that no proper time was given to the accused before
recording his confessional statement. Moreover, after
recording confessional statement, the respondent was again
handed over to the police and the probability that he was
under the fear that in case he would not tender his
confessional statement, he would be again handed over to
police, cannot be ruled out. There is no cavil to the

proposition that conviction can be awarded to the accused on

the basis of his sole confession, however, for that the
confession must be voluntary, inculpatory, true, without any
inducement, fear and coercion. In “Manjeet Singh Vs. The
State (PLD 2006 SC 30)”, the august Supreme Court held

that:-

“There is no rule of criminal
administration of justice that the Court
having found the retracted confession
voluntary and true, must also look for
the corroboration and in absence of
corroborative evidence conviction
cannot be maintained. The retraction
of a_ judicial or extra-judicial
confession itself is not an infirmity to
be considered sufficient to withhold
the conviction because the evidentiary
value of a confession is not diminished
by mere fact that it was retracted by
the maker at the trial and thus the
independent corroboration from other
source direct or circumstantial, cannot
be insisted in every case as a
mandatory rule rather the rule of
corroboration is applied as abundant
caution and in a case depending
entirely on the confessional statement
of a person or only of the
circumstantial evidence, this rule is
applied more cautiously.”

In the circumstance and the manner and mode,
the confessions of the respondent/accused was recorded
which was subsequently retracted, as a rule of caution, it must

be supported by some connecting/corroborative evidence.

“State Vs Wagar (1992 SCMR 950), Nazir Hussain Vs The
Crown (1969 SCMR 442) , Habib Ullah Vs The State (1971
SCMR 341) and Staet Vs. Minhun (PLD 1964 SC 813)”.

11. Moreover, even if the confessional statement of
the accused/respondent is taken into account, it is in the
nature of exculpatory confessional statement, as in the said
statement, the role of firing at the deceased has been
attributed to accused/respondent Faraz Hussain Shah. Another
important aspect of the case is that, from beginning till end,
there is no motive between the accused and the deceased,
which could have been the basis for the instant occurrence.

12. The sifting of evidence available on record
suggest that the prosecution has miserably failed to build up a
chain of circumstances to  prima-facie connect the
respondents/ accused with the commission of alleged offence.
There are material dents and doubts in the prosecution case,
which cannot be based for conviction of the respondents.
Moreover, it is settled proposition of law that after acquittal,
the accused earns double innocence. Reliance is placed on
“Zaheer Sadiq Vs. Muhammad Ijaz & others (2017 SCMR
2007), Mst. Anwar Begum Vs. Akhtar Hussain alias Kaka &
others (2017 SCMR_ 1710), Muhammad Zaman Vs. The

State (2014 SCMR_ 749), Muhammad Tasweer Vs. Hafiz
Zulkarnain (PLD 2009 SC 53), Shahid Abbas Vs. Shahbaz
& others (2009 SCMR_ 237), Muhammad _Shafi_Vs.
Muhammad Raza & others (2008 SCMR 329)”.

13. For what has been discussed above, it is held that
learned trial court has committed no legal or jurisdictional
error by acquitting the respondents. No_ illegality or
irregularity was found in the impugned order passed by the
learned trial court warranting interference by this court.

14. Resultantly, instant appeal fails which is, thus
dismissed in limine.

Announced.
