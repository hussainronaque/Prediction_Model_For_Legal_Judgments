Gohar Khan Inspector (PW-3) deposed that

operation staff. He produced the accused before the

Court of Judical Magistrate, vide application (EX

PW 3/1) and obtained his two days police custody,

interrogated him and recorded his statement under

section 161 Cr.PC. Gul Shed Khan SHO (PW-3)

arrested accused Gulzar on 8.5.2016 and issued his

Ali SI (PW-4) on receipt of murasila, incorporated

its contents into FIR ( EX PA). He is also marginal

witness to recovery memo (EX PW 4/1) vide which

the SHO Gul Amir Khan took into possession

bloodstained garments of deceased. Saeed-uz-

Zaman No.407 (PW-5) deposed that he is marginal

witness to recovery memo (EX PW 5/1) vide which

the I.O0 took into possession bloodstained earth
from the place of deceased and sealed the same in

parcel No.l. He is also marginal witness to

recovery memo (EX PW 5/2) vide which the I.O

recovered and took into possession 03 empties of

7.62 bore from the places of accused Sher Bahadar

and Gul Raz and 05 empties of 7.62 bore from the

places of accused Burhan, Farman and Khalil-ur-

Rehman, which were sealed into separate parcels.

Shafiullah (Rtd) Inspector (PW-6), who is author of

murasila (EX PA/1) reiterated the same facts,

which he has recorded in the murasila. He prepared

the injury sheet and inquest report of deceased (EX

PW 6/1 & EX PW 6/2) respectively. He prepared

the site plan (EX PW 5/1) at the instance and

pointation of complainant and eyewitness. During

spot inspection, he also recovered and took into

possession bloodstained earth from the place of

deceased. Similarly, vide recovery memo (EX PW
10

5/2) he recovered and took into possession 03

empties of 7.62 bore and 05 empties of 7.62 bore

from the places of accused. Khadim Shah Khan SI

(PW-7) deposed that he produced accused Gulzar

before the Judicial Magistrate Tangi, vide

application (EX PW 7/1) and obtained his one day

police custody and interrogated the accused. He

also produced accused Khalil-ur-Rehman before

the Court and obtained his two days police custody

and interrogated him.

5. The prosecution closed its evidence and

thereafter accused-appellants were examined under

section 342 Cr.PC, they neither wished to be

examined on Oath under section 340 (2) Cr.PC nor

opted to produce evidence in defence and denied

the allegations leveled against them. After hearing

the learned counsel for the parties, the learned trial

Court vide impugned judgment dated 19.01.2017
11

convicted and sentenced the appellants in the

manner already discussed above, hence the instant

appeal.

6. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties

heard and record perused with their able assistance.

7. It is the duty of the prosecution to bring home

charge against the accused beyond any reasonable

shadow of doubt, and most particularly in cases

where capital punishment is provided, the

prosecution is under statutory obligation to bring on

record unimpeachable and lucid evidence, which

shall satisfy the judicial mind of the Court with

regard to the proof of charge leveled by the

prosecution against the accused indicted for the

crime.

8. Bahadar Sher, the complainant, was examined

as (PW-07) during the proceedings under section-

512 Cr.PC, but at the trial of the convict-appellants,
12

the complainant was reported to be dead, therefore,

on the request of the prosecution, his statement and

that of the Investigating Officer namely Gul Amir

Khan, were transposed to the trial of the appellants.

True that the statement of a witness duly recorded

under section 512 Cr.PC can be transposed to the

trial of accused subsequently arrested and the same

falls within the category of substantive evidence yet

the Court has to evaluate the same on case to case

basis with care and caution while considering the

intrinsic worth of the statement in the

circumstances of each case for the reason that the

same has not been subjected to cross examination.

It is also desirable that the Courts shall strive for

strong independent corroboration while placing

reliance on such statement, which in opinion of the

Court would be sufficient enough to establish the

guilt beyond any reasonable shadow of doubt.
13

Judicial assessment of a statement recorded u/s 512

Cr.PC would require careful scrutiny by placing the

other evidence in juxtaposition with the statement

or statements recorded u/s 512 Cr.PC.

9. Presence of the complainant at the time of

occurrence is not believable for the reason that he

has neither disclosed the purpose of his visit to

village Saro Shah nor he is taking the dead body of

the deceased to the police station or for that matter

to the Hospital and is waiting for the arrival of the

police at the spot and thereafter lodging the report,

whereas it is admitted that the place of occurrence

is near to Police Post Gandheri, which is at a

distance of two kilometers.

10. As per contents of murasila (EX PA/1) the

complainant namely Bahadar Sher (now dead)

alongwith his deceased son Arshad Kamal and

nephew Hamayun, when reached the place of
14

occurrence, the accused (five in number) duly
armed with Kalashnikov came out from the
sugarcane crop and started firing at them, as a
result of which Arshad Kamal was hit and died on
the spot while the complainant and PW Hamayun
escaped unhurt. Perusal of postmortem examination
report (EX PM) reveals that there are seven entry
wounds on the dead body of the deceased and the
size of entry wounds No.1, 3, 9, 11, 13 are 1/4" x
1/4" with corresponding exit wounds measuring
1/2" x 1/2" while the size of entry wounds No.5 &
7 are 1/2" x 1/2" and 2" x 3" respectively. In this
regard we are fortified by the judgment of the
Hon’ble Apex Court rendered in Farman_Ali’s
case (PLD 1980 SC 201), wherein it was held that;

“In his dying declaration, Rashid Khan has involved

the three brothers as well as their friend, Farman Ali.

But the medical evidence and the evidence of the

Ballistic Expert do seem to cast doubt on his veracity.

The evidence of Doctor Muhammad Kamal, who had

conducted autopsy on the dead body of Rashid Khan'
is that the size of inlet of all the wounds suffered by
15

him was the same meaning thereby that he had been
shot from one or more than one weapon of the same
calibre. It is in the evidence of the Ballistic Expert,
however, that the- four empties sent to him for
examination' were found to have been fired through
-32 bore pistol which was also sent to him by the
Investigation Officer. It would therefore follow that
Rashid Khan had been shot through a pistol and
certainly not through a rifle with which Farman Ali is
said to have been armed. It is true that according to
the prosecution each one of the three appellant
brothers was armed with a .32 bore pistol. But the type
of injuries suffered by Rashid Khan rather suggest
that it was the work of one man. It is common
knowledge that .32 bore pistol is an automatic weapon
carrying in its charger seven bullets. The fact that the
deceased was found to have suffered seven inlet
wounds, three of them in his left Knee joint, one on
his left elbow, two in his abdomen and one in
backward direction to his right superior iliac spine,
the inlet -size of all of which is said to be the same,
would go a long way to show that this could as well be
the work of a single person and not of the three
appellants. There. is no evidence on the record to
show, however, as to which one of the three had
caused him the said injuries, therefore, no option is
left but to hold that the prosecution has failed to bring

home its case against any one of the appellants”.

11. Despite firing by all the five accused with

sophisticated weapons, the complainant Bahadar

Sher and PW Hamayun did not receive a single

firearm or lacerated injury. During spot inspection,

the I.O recovered five empties of 7.62 bore from
16

points No.6,7, & 8 assigned to accused namely

Farman, Khalil-ur-Rehman, and Burhan while from

points No.4 & 5 three empties of 7.62 bore were

shown to have been recovered from the places of

accused Bahadar Sher and Gulzar, which are inside

the sugarcane crops, but these empties were not

sent to the FSL for ascertaining as to whether these

were fired from one weapon or more. The true

mode and manner of the occurrence appears to

have been suppressed. The charge appears to have

been exaggerated and the net has been thrown wide

by implicating five persons without assigning any

specific role to any of them, possibility of false

implication could not be ruled out. In this respect

reliance is placed upon the judgment of Hon’ble

Supreme Court rendered in Sohni’s case (PLD

1965 Supreme Court-111), wherein it was held

that;
12.

Sher, Hamayun (PW) was also the eyewitness of

the prosecution, but he was abandoned being won

over by the defence. So, there is no ocular account,

which could establish the guilt of the convict-

appellants. It is also admitted that he was nephew

(sister son) of the complainant, an adverse

inference is to be drawn in the circumstances of the

17

“Furthermore, according to Doctor Muhammad
Yamin Khan out of the 9 injuries found one Maulo
deceased 2 were contused wounds, I incised wound,
1 was abrasion and the rest were contusions. Death
was due to the shock and compression of brain
caused by blood clots due to fracture of skull which
was caused by injuries Nos. 1 and 2 that were found
on the deceased. Most of the remaining injuries
were on the leg of the deceased. In view of the
number and nature of injuries one may legitimately
ask whether this could possibly have been the result
of assault by 6 accused persons or that they could
have been easily caused by two or three persons.
Viewing all the circumstances we are satisfied that
the High Court was right in insisting on some
corroboration of the evidence of the eye-witnesses
connecting the accused with the crime. As such
corroboration was lacking, the High Court was
justified in giving the benefit of doubt to the accused

persons.”

Besides the complainant namely Bahadar

case against the prosecution.
18

13. The only circumstance in the account of the
appellants is their abscondance but on this point the
law is by now well-settled that the same alone is
not sufficient to record conviction on a capital
charge and it can be used only as a corroboratory
and confirmatory in support of ocular account but
when there is no ocular account then it is of a very
little value for court for consideration. Reliance in
this regard is placed on the case of Rasool
Muhammad v. Asal Muhammad and 3 others
reported in 1995 SCMR 1373, wherein it has been

held that:--

"Abscondence per se is not proof of the guilt of an
accused person. Disappearance of a person named as
a murderer/culprit after the occurrence is but natural,
whether named rightly or wrongly"

Keeping in view the above discussion, case of
the prosecution is pregnant with doubts and dents
benefit whereof shall go to the appellants. We hold

that the prosecution miserably failed to prove its
19

case against the appellants beyond reasonable
shadow of doubt. Accordingly, this appeal is
allowed, the impugned judgment dated 19.01.2017
passed by the trial Court is set aside, the appellants
are acquitted of the charges leveled against them,
and be set free forthwith if not required in any other
case.

Above are the detailed reasons of our short
order of even date.
