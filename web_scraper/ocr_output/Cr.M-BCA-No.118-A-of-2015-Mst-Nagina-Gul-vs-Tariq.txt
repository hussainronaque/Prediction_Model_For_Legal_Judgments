QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- Mst. Nagina Gul
Ali, widow of Salabat Khan, petitioner has
moved the’ instant application for
cancellation of bail granted to
accused/respondent No.1, Tariq son of Gul
Faraz, in case vide FIR No.730 dated
20.10.2014 under Section 302 PPC read
with Section 109 PPC, Police Station
Mirpur, Abbottabad, by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-II, Abbottabad,

vide impugned order dated 27.02.2015.
2. The FIR was lodged on the
report of father of deceased Salabat Khan,
namely, Sawar Khan, who charged the
accused/respondent for the ‘Qat/-i-Amd’ of
his son, Salabat Khan at 1400 hours on
20.10.2014 in his report lodged in the
emergency ward of ATH at 1415 hours on
the same date i.e. 20.10.2014. In his
report, the complainant disclosed the
source of his information as driver Gulzar
and Gunman Munawar Khan, who were
accompanying his deceased son from his
house to Mandian and were present on the
College road at the time of occurrence.
The motive for the offence was cited as
previous blood feud; and father of the
accused/respondent, Gul Faraz, was also
charged for instigation/abetment.

3. The learned Additional Sessions
Judge-II, Abbottabad, admitted the
accused/respondent to bail on_ the

following grounds;
(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

(vi)

The complainant was not the
eye witness of the occurrence.
There was established enmity
between the parties, therefore,
charge of false implication could
not be ruled out.

The medical report in the shape
of Postmortem examination as
well as site plan showed that the
deceased had been fired at from
a close range.

The security guard namely
Munawar Khan who was
accompanying the deceased was
armed with 8 AM pistol but no
effort had been made by him to
counter the assailant.

The other witness namely Gulzar
did not know the murderer and
the name of killer was disclosed
to him by’ the_ co-witness
Munawar.

The mode and manner of
implicating the petitioner for
murder of deceased and alleged
presence of witnesses on the
spot indicated that in the event
of previous established enmity,

false implication could not be
ruled out, which in turn brought
the case of petitioner to the
ambit of further inquiry.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for
the petitioner, learned counsel for
accused/respondent No.1 and Additional
AG heard, and record perused.

5. It may be observed, at the very
outset, that while granting bail the Court
ought to see whether there was material
on the available record to prima facie
connect the accused/petitioner with the
commission of offence; and, as such, deep
appreciation of evidence would not be
permissible at the bail stage. However, the
impugned order of learned Additional
Sessions Judge-II, Abbottabad, dated
27.02.2015, speaks otherwise, as_ the
learned Additional Sessions Judge not only
overlooked the prima facie aspect of the
case but also accorded undue importance

and embarked on deep appreciation of
conduct of the security guard at the time
of occurrence.

6. Notwithstanding the fact that the
security guard/Gunman, Munawar Khan,
not only explained his conduct at the time
of occurrence in his statement before the
Police under Section 161 Cr.PC followed by
his statement under Section 164 Cr.PC,
which finds support from the statement
under Section 161 Cr.PC of the driver,
Muhammad Gulzar, the security
guard/gunman also explained as to how he
recognized the accused/respondent at the
time of commission of the _ offence.
Besides, there was overwhelming evidence
on the record to prima facie connect the
accused/respondent with the offence, such
as, direct charge of ‘Qatl-i-Amd’ against
the accused/respondent in the promptly
lodged FIR in the emergency ward of ATH
by the father of the deceased who had

rushed to the Hospital on _ receiving
information about his son falling victim to
the firing. It is, indeed, unlikely on the part
of agrieving father to substitute an
innocent person for the real culprit. There
was a strong motive of previous enmity,
and considering the same as a ground for
false implication at the bail stage would be
farther from reality, to say the least. The
complainant nowhere claimed to be an eye
witness, and mentioned the names of
security guard/Gunman, Munawar Khan,
and driver Gulzar as the two persons
accompanying his deceased son at the
time of occurrence, who furnished ocular
account of the occurrence. The medical
report supporting the site plan in respect
of firing from close range should have
been a good ground for holding the
accused/respondent prima facie connected
with the commission of the offence.
Likewise, the disclosure of the name of

accused/respondent to driver Gulzar by
security guard/Gunman, Munawar, was not
so significant and a fatal dent in the case
of the prosecution so as to create serious
doubts about veracity of the statements of
the two eye witnesses at the bail stage.
Additionally, after remaining absconder
and having been proceeded against under
Sections 204 and 87 Cr.PC as well as 512
Cr.PC, after his arrest, the weapon of
offence i.e. 30 bore pistol was recovered
from the possession of  accused-
respondent which was sent to FSL along
with two 30 bore pistol crime empties
recovered from the spot, and report of the
fire arm expert was received in the
affirmative.

7. In short, the impugned order of the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-II,
Abbottabad, dated 27.02.2015 is seriously
flawed and militates against the expressed

and established provisions of law and

justice, hence not = sustainable. 1999 SCMR
338, 2006 SCMR 1265, 2007 SCMR
482, 1996 SCMR 172, 2004 YLR 400,
PLJ 2014 Cr.C. (Peshawar) 808.

8. Therefore, on the acceptance of the
petition, the bail granted to
accused/respondent No.1 is cancelled and
order of the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-II, Abbottabad dated 27.02.2015 is
recalled, with the result,
accused/respondent No.1 be taken into
custody and_- produced’ before’ the

concerned Court.

Announced. JUDGE
