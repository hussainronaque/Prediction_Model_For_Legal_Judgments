‘Celebrities can be a big part of daily life.
They provide us with laughs, comfort,
entertainment, excitement, or a sense of
escape. When a celeb we feel connected to
passes away, it can feel like losing someone
close to us because they may have been
integral in some of our happiest or saddest
moments; They made us laugh, they made us
cry, but most importantly, they helped us
forget about our difficult moments when we

needed it most?"

The tragic deaths of celebrities are always

shocking for their fans. Fozia Azeem known as

death when in the morning of 16.17.2016 she was
found dead on her bed. Receiving this information,
Muhammad Ilyas Haider Inspector (Pw-20) along with
his official associates arrived at crime scene in the
area of Gulistan Street Muzaffarabad, Multan where
Muhammad Azeem (Pw-29), father of the lady
deceased, made a statement (PAT) and maintained that
his daughter Qandeel Baloch was in Showbiz who
came from Karachi to celebrate the festival of
‘Eid-ul-Fitr ®’; Muhammad Wasim (appellant), brother
of Qandeel Baloch, also came and asked her sister not
to work in Showbiz; in the night he/complainant and
his wife Anwar Bibi (Pw-30) slept on the first floor of
the house, whereas Qandeel Baloch went for sleep in
a room downstairs; when they/complainant etc. awoke
up in the morning, Muhammad Wasim (appellant) was
not present in the house; they were also under an
impression that Qandeel Baloch was sleeping but after
a considerable time, when they removed the cloth
from her mouth, she was found dead having
strangulation marks on her body. Muhammad Azeem
claimed that his son Muhammad Wasim (appellant)
had committed the ‘Qatl-i-Amd7’ of Qandeel Baloch
on the pretext of honour and he was facilitated by
Aslam Shaheen his/complainants’ other son.

Sections 302/109 PPC9. Later on through a
supplementary statement, Muhammad Azeem also
implicated Haq Nawaz, Abdul Basit, Muhammad
Abdul Qavi, Muhammad Zafar Hussain and
Muhammad Arif (PO) 72.

3. All accused including Muhammad Waseem
(appellant) and excluding Muhammad Arif (PO)
subsequent to submission of report under Section 173
Cr.P.C (Challan) were charged under Sections 302/
201/404/311/34/109 PPC on 12.12.2018 who pleaded
not guilty and demanded the trial.

4. In order to prove its case prosecution had
produced as many as 35 witnesses, whereas appellant
and his co-accused in their examinations made under
Section 342 Cr.P.C17 pleaded their false involvement.
The specific version of appellant was as under: -

“T have been falsely implicated in this
case. According to information when
police came to know about the
murder of my sister they pressurized
my father to implicate someone
otherwise they will be involved. The
police also asked my father and
mother to tell the names of my
brothers and family members. Later
on I and my brothers have been
falsely implicated due to intervention
of High-ups, which is in the
prosecution case. In present case
there is no direct evidence against me
and as I have already stated that my
judicial confession was obtained after
torturing me. I am innocent. ”

Muhammad Wasim vs. The State & another

Judge Multan, Muhammad Waseem (appellant) was
convicted under Section 311 PPC and sentenced to
imprisonment for life whereas all other accused were
acquitted.

6. Feeling aggrieved from his conviction,
appellant has approached this Court through the
instant criminal appeal.

7. Learned counsel for appellant maintained that
the legal heirs of deceased during the trial had
compounded the offence with appellant and his
brother co-accused Aslam Shaheen which was
rejected for the time being, however, while deciding
the case finally, said compromise was again taken into
consideration and relied upon but the learned trial
court wrongly proceeded to convict the appellant
under Section 311 PPC by ignoring the most
important fact that it was not a case of ‘Qisas’ but of
‘Ta ’zir’ so the provisions of Section 311 PPC had no
role in the given situation.

8. On the other hand, learned Law officers for the
State have argued that prosecution had proved its’
case beyond reasonable doubt on the strength of
confession made by appellant before a learned
Magistrate, the DNA reports, Polygraphist test and
recoveries at the instance of appellant; as the death of
Qandeel Baloch was the result of honour killing,
therefore, the leaned trial court despite compounding
the offence between two sides, rightly convicted the
appellant under Section 311 PPC.

9. HEARD.

10. The story about this occurrence is revolving
around one family only. Muhammad Waseem
(appellant) and Aslam Shaheen (since acquitted) are the
real brothers of Qandeel Baloch (deceased) whereas
Muhammad Azeem (Pw-29) and Mst. Anwar Bibi
(Pw-30) are the parents of deceased, appellant and
Aslam Shaheen.

11. Basic question before this Court is that whether
the compromise was complete for all the purposes
during the trial proceedings or not? Record indicates
that on 22.08.2019 an application under Section 345
Cr.P.C for compromise between the legal heirs of
deceased with Muhammad Waseem (appellant) and
Aslam Shaheen was submitted before the learned trial
court. This is not a fact under dispute that the only
legal heirs of Qandeel Baloch at the relevant time was
her parents Muhammad Azeem (Pw-29) and
Mst. Anwar Bibi (Pw-30) because her two brothers
were the accused of the case. On the same day,
statements of both the legal heirs were recorded where
they categorically maintained that they had forgiven
Muhammad Waseem (appellant) and Aslam Shaheen
(since acquitted) and they were having no objection for
the acquittal of said assailants. It is important to add
here that even today Mst. Anwar Bibi present in Court
with her learned Advocate stands for the said
compromise. However, Muhammad Azeem is not

present as he is no more in this world now.
Criminal eal No. 917 of 2019 6
Muhammad Wasim vs. The State & another

12. The learned trial court after recording the
statements, on the same date dismissed the application

and the relevant portion of the order is as under: -

“ce

Itis made clear that application u/s
345(2) Cr.P.C is not allowed for the
time_being, keeping in view the
restrictions as imposed by Sec. 345
(2) Cr.P.C.”

(Emphasized applied)

13. The above order makes it clear that on
22.08.2019 the compromise was complete between
two sides however its effect was postponed till a
particular time.

14. The learned trial court in paragraph No.29 of
the judgment again observed as under: -

“It is important to discuss here that
parents of Fouzia Azeem alias
Qandeel Baloch filed application for
compounding the offence to the extent
of accused Muhammad Waseem and
Aslam Shaheen and same was
dismissed by this court for the time
being, keeping in view the provisions
of Sec. 345 (2) Cr.P.C. wherein the
discretion is granted to the court for
acceptance of such compromise.
Again the mother of deceased
appeared before the court during
course of arguments of defense
counsels and insisted that
compromise be accepted as she has
lost her daughter and further does
not want to lose her son, even if the
compromise is accepted the case of
Muhammad Waseem accused falls
within the ambit of Sec. 311 PPC as
he has confessed before the learned
Judicial Magistrate while recording
his judicial confession that he
committed the murder of his sister
due to her photographs and videos
and the same has been discussed in
Criminal

eal No. 917 of 2019 7

Muhammad Wasim vs. The State & another

the preceding paragraph of this
Judgment.”

15. The conviction of Muhammad Waseem
(appellant) under Section 311 PPC itself indicates that
learned trial court had accepted the compromise but
finding the case as of honour killing declared it within
the ambit of Section 311 PPC.

16. An important question of law that whether
appellant could be convicted under Section 311 PPC
which is an outcome in case of waiver or
compounding of ‘Qisas’ or still he had to be convicted
under Section 302(b) PPC keeping in view the
amendment?? made in Section 302 PPC, shall be
examined in some other appropriate case.

17. The conviction of an offender on the principle
of ‘fasad-fil-arz?3’ or on the pretext of honour killing
must base on clear and qualitative evidence. As for
the purpose of convicting the appellant under Section
311 PPC the learned trial court has mainly relied upon
his confession recorded by Mr. Muhammad Sarfraz
Anjum Magistrate (Pw-34) therefore, I am compelled
to discuss the merits of that piece of evidence.

18. Appellant was produced before the learned
Magistrate on 18.07.2016 and the statement which he
made was as under: -

iS JB oe a -e siele cob oS HS LS Jibs

By way criminal Law (Amendment) (Offence in the name or on Pretext of Honour) Act, (XLII of 2016) it has
been provided that principle of fasad-fil-arz is attracted in cases under Sections 302(a) and 302(b) PPC. On the basis
of same Act definition of fasad-fil-arz was introduced under Section 299(ee) that also includes the commission of
offence in the name or the pretext of honour.

19. No doubt that in the last line he gave a reason
of murder of his sister due to pictures and videos but
still it does not mean that murder was on the pretext of
honour killing as the same was not specifically
pleaded by appellant in his alleged confession. This
goes without saying that a conviction particular in the
case of capital charge cannot be recorded by
presuming the facts.

20. A volunteer confession by accused is an
important consideration before it is relied upon. The
apex Court in Azeem Khan’s case’ was pleased to
formulate the following principles for a valid
confession: -

i. Before recording confession and that
too in crimes entailing capital
punishment the recording Magistrate
had to essentially observe all the
mandatory precautions (laid down in
the High Court Rules and Orders).

ii. Fundamental logic behind the same
was that, all signs of fear
uncalculated by the investigating
agency in the mind of the accused
were to be shed out.

iii. Accused was to be provided full
assurance that in case he was not
guilty or was not making a confession
voluntarily then in that case he would
not be handed over back to the
police.

iv. Sufficient time for reflection was to
be given after the first warning was
administered.

v. At the expiry of such time, recording
Magistrate had to administer the

Muhammad Wasim vs. The State & another

viii.

second warning and the accused
shall be assured that now he was in
the safe hands.

All police officials whether in
uniform or otherwise including Naib
court attached to the court must be
kept outside the court and beyond the
view of the accused.

After observing all these legal
requirements if the accused person
was willing to confess then all
required questions as formulated by
the High Court Rules and Orders
should be put to him and the answers
given, be recorded in the words
spoken by him.

Statement of accused should be
recorded by the Magistrate with his
own hand and in case there was a
genuine compelling reason then, a
special note was to be given that the
same was dictated to a responsible
official of the court like Stenographer
or Reader and oath shall also be
administered to such official that he
would correctly type or write the true
and correct version.

Accused shall be sent to jail on
judicial remand and during this
process at no occasion he shall be
handed over to any _ police
official/officer whether he was Naib
court wearing police uniform or any
other police official/officer because
such careless dispensation would
considerably diminish the voluntary
nature of the confession made by the
accused.

21. The honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan in

Ahmed Omers case7% on the question of non

removing of handcuffs during the statement under

Section 164 Cr.P.C was also pleased to hold as

under:-

“Any confession, even recorded
under section 164, Cr.P.C_ will

Muhammad Wasim vs. The State & another

10

become invalid if the accused is
produced before the Magistrate
remained in handcuff while making
such confession”

22. When examined the evidence of confession in

the light of above settled principles, it has been

observed that the learned Magistrate had committed

following illegalities which are not curable: -

i.

ii.

iii.

iv.

Appellant was produced before
learned Magistrate at about 02:30
pm whereas the alleged confession
shows that it was recorded at 03:00
pm. In such a serious and high profile
case only 30 minutes time for
reconciliation for appellant was
unreasonable to dispel or dislodge
any impression of fear and undue
influence on him.

The entire court staff was retained
inside the court. The learned
Magistrate was supposed to ask only
those members of his staff who were
necessary keeping in view the
security inside the court room.
Appellant was produced in custody
by police. The statement is completely
silent that handcuffs of appellant
were removed before he made the
statement and thereafter he was
again handcuffed.

Except the confession recorded in
Urdu, all other proceedings are in
English but there is no oath of the
Stenographer available on record to
show that he had typed every fact in
accordance with the dictation made
to him by the learned Magistrate.

The confession on the face of it
appears to be a so-called exercise
because except the statement of
appellant every fact typed was in
English. Even the questions put to
appellant and the answers thereof
were typed in English. The learned
Magistrate although in cross-
examination responded that he also
asked the questions in Urdu but he
Criminal

eal No. 917 of 2019 11

Muhammad Wasim vs. The State & another

admitted that he did not mention this
fact anywhere.

vi. It was the duty of larded Magistrate
to give a note that appellant was
familiar with the English language
and he gave the answers also in the
same language. If it was not so, it
was also his duty to give a specific
note that all the questions and
answers were translated to the
appellant in Urdu language.

vii. The learned Magistrate did not give
any certificate anywhere that what
were those compelling reasons that
he was unable to record the entire
proceedings in his own hand writing.
The statement in Urdu by the hand of
learned Magistrate makes it clear
that there was nothing wrong with
him on that day so it is not
understandable that why this exercise
was completed in English and Urdu.

viii. No doubt that after the alleged
confession appellant was sent to Jail
but surprisingly his custody was
handed over to the same
Investigating Officer who had
produced him in court with the
application for recording of
confession.

23. In view of above circumstances, the value of
confession cannot be considered more than a piece of
paper.

24. Once the evidence of confession is discarded,
there is no other material at all with the prosecution to
establish that it was a case of honour killing. This fact
cannot be skipped that it was an unseen occurrence
and all the private witnesses named Muhammad
Nawaz (Pw-22), Ashiq Hussain (Pw-25), Akhtar
Hussain (Pw-26), Khair Muhammad (Pw-27), Sabir
(Pw-28), Muhammad Azeem (Pw-29) and Anwar Bibi

(Pw-30) had resiled from their statements. They were
Criminal eal No. 917 of 2019 12
Muhammad Wasim vs. The State & another

declared as hostile by the prosecution but despite
considerable cross-examination on them nothing
favorable to the State could be brought on record.

25. I am conscious of the fact that a famous
celebrity of the country lost her life without any sin
but this fact alone is not relevant to sustain the
conviction of appellant for the reasons that the Courts
have to decide the cases in accordance with law that is
to say ‘a person will comply with the terms of the law
or will abide by or obey the law’. At this stage I will
like to refer a Latin phrase ‘Fiat Justitia’ which means
‘Let Justice be done’. This also reminds me the
golden principles while deciding a case which are as
follows: -

i. Appreciation of evidence involves
weighing the credibility and reliability of
the evidence presented in the case.

ii. Evidence is any matter of facts, the
effect, tendency or design of which is to
produce in the mind, a persuasion,
affirmative or dis-affirmative, of the
existence of some other matter of fact.

iii. Evidence means and _ includes all
statements, which the Court permits or
requires to be made before it by
witnesses, in relation to matters of fact
under enquiry and all documents
including electronic records produced
for the inspection of the Court.

iv. The standard of proof in Criminal case is
not the same as in the Civil.

v. Importantly, in criminal case, the burden
of proving the guilt of an accused is upon
the prosecution.

vi. Prosecution must stand by _ itself.
Essentially, accused need not establish
his case beyond all reasonable doubt
except in the cases, where burden
relating to a fact in issue is on him.
Criminal eal No. 917 of 2019 13
Muhammad Wasim vs. The State & another ~

vii. If there is a real and reasonable doubt as
to his guilt, the accused is entitled to the
benefit of doubt.

viii.The law always requires that the
conviction should be certain and not
doubtful.

26. As a consequence of the discussion made
above, this criminal appeal is allowed. Impugned
judgment to the extent of conviction of Muhammad
Waseem (appellant) is set_aside. He is acquitted from
the case on the basis of compromise. He is in custody
and he shall be released forthwith if not required in
any other case. The case property shall be dealt with
in the same manners as directed by the learned trial

Court.
