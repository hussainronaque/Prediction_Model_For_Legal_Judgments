ORDER

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J. Being

unsuccessful before the two courts below to get the

concession of post arrest bail, petitioner Muhammad

Suleman alias Dagai, through this further petition seeks the

same concession from this court in case FIR No.581 dated

21.09.2015, registered under section 376 PPC, in Police

Station Pabbi, wherein he is charged by Mst. Maimoona

aged 15/16 years for committing her rape in the Hujra of

Saif ul Islam situated in village Dargai.

2. Arguments heard and record perused.

3. No doubt, there is delay of a month in

lodging report but the same has been well explained by the

victim girl in her report that soon after her release, she

rushed to her house and narrated the entire episode to her

sister Mst. Saira, who approached the family members of

the petitioner to complain them and to settle matter, but

they threatened her. However, both the sisters due to

family honour, dignity and shame kept mum to disclose

this untoward incident before their parents. Keeping in

view the norms, customs and traditions of our society,

particularly in pathan society, in such like unfortunate

incidents, people do think hundred times before lodging

report so as to avoid disgrace and family honour and tries

to find out the midway, which cause delay, therefore, delay

in such like offences would be immaterial. The petitioner

has been charged directly by the victim in her report and

according to her medical report her hymen has been found

torn. On the face of record, victim is 15 years old girl and

it cannot be believed that she would put her career,

personal respect and family honour at stake by fabricating

a false story so as to stigmatize herself for the everlasting

life in absence of any motive. On tentative assessment

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

reasonable grounds exist which prima facie connects the

petitioner with the commission of offence, which is

heinous, shameful affecting the entire society and its

punishment falls within the Prohibitory Clause of S.497

Cr.P.C., therefore, I am not inclined to exercise the

discretion of bail in favour of the petitioner.

4. Resultantly, this petition being meritless
stands dismissed. However, prosecution is directed to
submit challan against the petitioner within a fortnight and
the learned Trial Court shall conclude the trial within a
period of three months from the date of receipt of the
challan. The learned Trial Court shall avoid unnecessary
adjournments except on reasonable and genuine grounds,
period of which shall also not exceed a week. In case of
failure to conclude the trial within the specified period, if
delay was not on the part of the petitioner or anybody
acting on his behalf, he would be at liberty to file fresh bail
petition before the learned Trial Court, which shall be
disposed of independently. Office is directed to send the
record to the quarter concerned within two days, positively.
