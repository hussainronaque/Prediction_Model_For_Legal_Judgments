JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- This criminal appeal filed
by appellant Shabib Hussain is directed against the judgment
dated 03.03.2012, passed by the learned trial Court/Judge
Anti Terrorism Court-III, Peshawar, whereby the appellant
having been found guilty of committing the ‘Qatl-e-Amd’ of
Muhammad Aslam Farooqi (A religious Scholar/Leader of
Sipah-e-Sahaba), has been convicted under section 302 (b)
PPC read with section 7 Anti Terrorism Act, 1997, and
sentenced to death and to pay a fine of Rs.10,00,000/-, as
compensation to LRs of deceased and in default thereof to
undergo 02 years imprisonment in case FIR No.415 dated

12.08.2007, registered under sections 302/324 PPC, S.7 Anti
Terrorism Act, 1997 and section 15 of the West Pakistan
Arms Ordinance, 1965, at Police Station Shah Qabool.

2. For confirmation of death sentence of the convict, the
learned trial Court has also sent Murder Reference No. 03
of 2012 in terms of section 374 Cr.PC.

3. Since, both the matters are the outcome of one and the
same judgment of the learned trial Court; therefore, we
propose to decide the same through this common judgment.
4. As per contents of FIR, on 12.08.2007, on receipt of
information regarding murder, Imtiaz Khan SHO (PW.11)
along with other police officials reached the spot i.e.
Mohallah Nagashbandi Jehangir Pura road, where
complainant Alamzeb (PW-1) , reported him to the effect
that on the fateful day i.e. 12.08.2007, he along with his
brother, namely, Muhammad Aslam Faroogqi “local leader of
Sepah-e-Sahaba”, when returned from Bazaar and reached
street of their house, known, as Mohallah Naqashband, a
young boy duly armed with firearm present there opened
indiscriminate fire at them, as a result, his brother got hit and
fell on the ground, while he luckily remained unscathed; that
he overpowered the culprit alongwith 30 bore crime pistol,
two magazines, one containing 6 live rounds and another
containing an empty and a live round. On search his further
search, a license copy of the pistol No PAK-51, a driving
license and NIC No. 21302-4209562-7, in his name were

recovered, which the complainant handed over to Imtiaz
Khan SHO along with the culprit and the crime pistol who
took the same into possession. He arrested the culprit vide
arrest Card Exh.PW.11/1, who disclosed his name as Shabib
Hussain (the appellant). PW.11 drafted the report of
complainant in the shape of Murasila Ex.PA/1 wherein the
complainant charged the appellant for murder of the
deceased on sectarian ground that appellant belongs to Shia
sect whereas, the deceased was the leader of Seph-e-Suhaba.
On the basis of Murasila FIR (Ex.PA) mentioned above was
registered against the appellant at Police Station Shah
Qabool. The deceased injured succumbed to the injuries,
therefore, Safdar Khan IHC prepared his injury sheet and
inquest report and shifted his dead body to the mortuary
under the escort of Jehanzeb Constable for postmortem
examination. PW.11 took into possession the 30 bore crime
pistol No.7715 having an empty in its chamber along with
two magazines and other articles mentioned above Exh.P.1 to
Exh.P.9 vide recovery memo Exh.PW.9/1. Dr. Iftikhar MO
KTH (PW.13) conducted autopsy on the dead body of the
deceased on 12.08.2007 at 1.00 p.m. and opined the cause of
death of the deceased to be the firearm injuries to his brain,
liver, right lung and chest.

5. Munir Khan SI PW.14 conducted investigation in
the case, he proceeded to the spot and prepared site plan
Exh.PB at the pointation of the complainant. During spot

inspection he secured bloodstained earth from the place of
the deceased and 05 crime empties of 30 bore from the place
of the appellant vide recovery memo Exh.PW.5/1 and sealed
the same in parcels. Vide recovery memo Exh.PW.4/1, he
took into possession the last worn bloodstained garments of
the deceased. Vide recovery memo Exh.PW.8/4 he took into
possession spent bullet Exh.P.11 sent by the doctor, after
postmortem examination of the deceased. He also took into
possession the parcels containing the crime pistols and
articles recovered from personal possession of the appellant
by complainant Alamzeb at the time of his arrest.. The
mobile SIM No.0344-98517 of the appellant was also taken
into possession by the I.O. vide recovery memo Exh.PW.8/3
and its CDR data vide memo Exh.Mark.A. During
interrogation, the appellant in his statement under section
161 Cr.P.C. named Syed Abid Ali, Farhd Ali, Nabi Hussain,
Hashim and Syed Ishfaq Hussain to be his co-accused in the
commission of offence, out of whom accused Syed Abdid
Ali and Farad Ali were also arrested.

6. On completion of investigation, complete challan
was submitted against the appellant and co-accused Abid Ali
and Farhad Ali. They all were jointly tried and on conclusion
whereby the learned trial Court, after hearing both the sides
acquitted co-accused Syed Abid Ali and Farhad Ali,
however, convicted and sentenced the appellant as mentioned

above vide judgment, impugned in the instant appeal.
7. Initially, appeal of the appellant was decided by this
Court vide judgment on 09.4.2015, whereby his conviction
and sentence was set aside and the case was remanded to
Anti Terrorism Court Abbottabad for trial denovo, however,
the judgment of this Court was set aside by the august Apex
Court vide judgment dated 6.10.2015 passed in Criminal
Appeal No. 22 of 2015, resultantly, was remanded to this
Court for decision afresh on merits. On 26.5.2016, this Court
again remanded the case to the learned trial Court for de novo
trial on the ground of defective charge. The complainant
being dissatisfied assailed the judgment of this Court dated
26.5.2016 before the Hon’ble supreme Court in Criminal
Appeal No. 583 of 2018, which was allowed, consequently,
the judgment of this Court was set aside and the case was
remanded again to this Court for decision on merit.

8. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record perused with their valuable assistance.

9. It appears from record that the occurrence has
taken place at 11.00 a.m. which has been reported with
promptitude at 11.15 a.m. Imtiaz Khan SHO (PW.11), in
cross-examination has deposed that on receipt of
information about the occurrence he along with other
police officials reached the spot within five minutes, where
complainant Alamzeb Khan (PW.1), handed over him the
appellant along with crime weapon and reported him about

the occurrence. The promptly lodged report of the
occurrence eliminates the possibility of consultation and
deliberation on behalf of the complainant with any other
person to falsely charge the appellant. Besides, the
appellant was unknown to the complainant as he is resident
of Mohallah Naqshband Peshawar while the appellant is
the resident of Parachinar. Both, complainant and the
appellant belong to different religious sects. It appears
from record that the deceased was a local leader of Seph-e-
Suhaba while the appellant hails from Shia sect. Alam Zeb
complainant while appearing as PW.1 reiterated the ocular
account of the occurrence as set forth by him in his initial
report. Similarly, Arshad (PW.2), has also furnished the
ocular account of the occurrence, who deposed that he was
running business of medicine; that on the day of
occurrence at about 11.00 a.m. he was going to bazaar. In
the way he saw Aslam Farooq deceased and Alamzeb
complainant and in the meanwhile, a person fired at them
with pistol, as a result, the deceased got hit, injured and fell
down on the ground while Alamzeb escaphed unhurt. The
complainant apprehended the culprit there and then at the
spot along with crime pistol. Other people also attracted to
the spot. In cross-examination he deposed that he is next
door neighbor of the complainant and at the time of
occurrence he was going to Bazaar from his house and was
in the street in which the occurrence took place. He

explained that at the time of occurrence the deceased along
with complainant was coming to home from Bazaar while
he was on the way to Bazaar, hence, he was facing towards
them; that after firing the complainant caught hold of the
accused and he also helped him; that accused fired 5/6
shots at the deceased; that police arrived at the spot after
10/15 minutes and the accused was handed over to them.
Both the eyewitnesses named have corroborated each other
on all important aspects of the case i.e. the day, date time
and place of occurrence as well as the mode and manner in
which the occurrence took place and arrest of the appellant
red handed at the spot along with crime weapon. Both the
witnesses have been subjected to taxing cross-examination
by the defence but nothing beneficial to the appellant could
be extracted from their mouths. Similarly, Imtiaz Khan
SHO (PW.11), in his statement has also corroborated the
ocular account of the eyewitnesses to the extent of arrest of
the appellant by the eyewitnesses and thereafter his
handing over to PW.11 along with crime pistol. The
positive serologist report about the bloodstained earth
recovered from the spot and the bloodstained clothes of the
deceased confirm the crime spot to be the same as alleged
by the eyewitnesses. An iota of evidence has not been
brought by the appellant to prove any ulterior motive on
the part of the complainant warranting his false implication
There exists no reason as to why the complainant will

substitute the real culprit of murder of his deceased brother
by falsely implicating an unknown innocent person from
Parachina Kurram. Admittedly, substitution of real culprit
charged directly and singularly is a rare phenomenon in the
system of criminal justice. Reference in this regard can be
made to case titled, “Allah Ditta Vs the State” (PLD 2002
Supreme Court 52) and case titled, “Muhammad Iqbal
Vs the State” (PLD 2001 Supreme Court 222. Recovery
of driving license and CNIC of the appellant at the time of
arrest further corroborate the ocular account. The autopsy
report of the deceased where he has sustained firearm
injuries on various parts of his body having similar
dimension, as a result, the deceased met his unnatural
death, also supports the ocular account.

10. The five crime empties of 30 bore pistol and a
spent bullet duly recovered from appellant, were sent to the
FSL along with recovered crime pistol No.7715, which as
per report Exh.PZ/1, have been fired from 30 bore pistol
No. 7715. This strong corroborative piece of circumstantial
evidence fully corroborates the ocular account and
strengthens the prosecution case.

11. Sufficient evidence has been brought on record by
the prosecution which proves that the deceased was a
religious scholar and prominent leader of Sipah-e-Sahaba,
whereas the appellant belongs to Shia sect, therefore,
murder of the deceased for the purpose of advancing a

religious and sectarian cause is sufficient to prove the act
of the appellant as terrorism. Coming of the appellant from
Parachinar Kurram Agency to Peshawar and committing
murder of the deceased proves the occurrence to be well
planned by the appellant, therefore, there exists no
mitigating circumstance to warrant lesser sentence. In this
view of the matter, the learned trial Court while
appreciating the evidence in its true perspective, has
reached to a right conclusion by holding the appellant
guilty of the offence and awarding him the capital sentence
to which no exception can be taken.

12. Resultantly, this appeal being meritless is hereby
dismissed. Murder Reference No.3 of 2012, sent by the
learned trial Court is answered in the “Affirmative” and

death sentence of the appellant/convict is confirmed.
