JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, _J.-

Through the instant appeal, appellant Khurram

Qazafi Mansoor, has questioned the judgment dated

27.01.2015, rendered by learned Special Judge

Anti-Terrorism Court, Mardan, whereby he has been

convicted and sentenced under section 5 Explosive

Substance Act, 1908 readwith S.7 (ff) Anti-Terrorism

Act, 1997, to undergo 07 years R.I. and forfeiture of

his property in favour of the State.

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
2. The State through Advocate-General

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar, has filed connected

Cr.A. No.240-P/2015, titled, “The State Vs

Khurram Qazafi Mansoor”, seeking enhancement of

sentence of the convict-respondent Khurram Qazafi

Mansoor.

3. Since, both the appeals are the outcome

of one and the same judgment of the learned Judge

Special Court Ant-Terrorism Court Mardan, dated

27.01.2015, therefore, this common judgment shall

govern the same.

4. Prosecution case as unfolded in First

Information Report is that on 21.06.2014, Mushtaq

Hussain Khan Inspector (PW.1) alongwith other

police officials, during search operation against

Proclaimed Offenders, on Malak Abad Babeni road,

intercepted a young boy having a polythene bag, on

search of which he recovered RPG-7 mortar, a hand

grenade, a fuse electrical cell, a safety fuse alongwith

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
detonator, and a fuse wire from the same. The

recovered explosive materials were defused through

Bomb Disposal Squad and then taken into possession

vide recovery memo Exh.PW.1/1. The accused, on

query disclosed his name as Khurram Qazafi

Mansoor (appellant-convict herein) was formally

arrested. PW.1 drafted murasila Exh.PA/1, on the

basis of which, FIR No.70 dated 21.06.2014, was

registered against the appellant under section 5

Explosive Substances Act, 1908, and S.7 Anti-

Terrorism Act, 1997, in Police Station IDS Gadoon,

Swabi.

5. On completion of investigation, challan

was submitted against the appellant before the

learned Trial Court, where he was charge sheeted

under section 5 Explosive Substances Act read with

S.7 (ff) Anti Terrorism Act, 1997, to which he

pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To prove its

case, prosecution examined as many as five

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
witnesses. After closure of the prosecution evidence,

statement of the appellant was recorded under section

342 Cr.P.C. wherein he denied the prosecution

allegations and professed his innocence. He,

however, declined to be examined on oath under

section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. or to produce evidence in

defence. On conclusion of trial, the learned Trial

Court, after hearing both the sides, vide impugned

judgment convicted and sentenced the appellant as

mentioned above, hence, these appeals.

6. We have heard the exhaustive

arguments advanced from both the sides on merits of

the case and perused the record with their able

assistance.

7. Without dilating up the merits of the

case in light of the available evidence, lest it may

prejudice the case of either side, we have serious

reservations in respect of charge with which the

appellant has been confronted as it is quite

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
ambiguous and does not not speak specifically as to

under which of the two laws, the appellant has been

charged sheeted, which exercise has prejudiced him

in his defence. Similarly, his conviction and sentence

recorded by the learned Trial Court is also on same

footing as it is not certain as to under which of the

two offences of the two laws, the appellant has been

convicted and sentenced. For convenience, we would

like to first reproduce the charge framed against the

appellant.

“That on 21.06.2014 at 1700 hours, you

accused were arrested by the local

police during search operation on

Babeni Malak Abad road near Farsh

and recovered a plastic bag from your

possession which was containing 1

PRG-7 mortar Gola, one Energa

grenade, one cell fuse electrical, one

safety fuse alongwith detonator and one

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
fuse wire of red colour and the words”
Hamza Sugar Mills Limited Khanpur

etc”

were written on the same bag
regarding which you could not furnish
any plausible explanation nor any valid
permit and your this act also created a
sense of fear and insecurity in the
society and thereby committed an
offence punishable under section 5
Explosive Substance Act readwith S.7
(ff) ATA which is within the cognizance
of this court”.
8. The threadbare reading of the charge
mentioned above, reveals that it does not specifically
determine as to whether the appellant has been
charge sheeted under S.5 of Explosive Substance Act,
1908 or under Section 7 (ff) of the Anti-Terrorism
Act, as it has been framed under a single head. It is

well settled principle of law that charge against

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
accused shall be specific, fair and clear in all respects

to provide an opportunity to the accused to defend

himself/herself in due course of trial. The charge

shall be clear and by no means, confused to prejudice

the accused. Charge is a precise formulation of

specific accusations made against an accused person,

who is entitled to know its nature at the early stage.

Its aim is to explain to the accused as correctly and

precisely as well as concisely as possible the

allegations with which the accused is to be

confronted. The charge must convey to the accused

with sufficient transparency and in clear terms what

the prosecution intends to prove against the accused.

It shall contain all essential details as to time, place as

well as specific manner of the alleged offence, the

manner in which the offence was committed with full

description of the accusation so as to afford the

accused an opportunity to explain the accusations

with which he is confronted. The prime object and

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
the principle of framing charge shall be, to make

aware the accused, of the substantive accusations

which are to be proved by the prosecution with clear

intention and with unambiguous description of the

offence so as to enable the accused to defend himself.

Guidance in this regard may be derived from S.A.K

Rehmani’s case (2005 SCMR 364). Section 232 of

the Cr.P.C. empowers the appellate Court that in case

it is found that on account of omissions of particulars

in framing charge, the accused has been prejudiced

and has not been provided an opportunity of clear

understanding of the charge to defend himself, it may

direct a fresh trial or even quash the conviction. For

convenience, section 232 Cr.P.C. is reproduced

below:-

“8.232. Effect of material error:- (1) If

any Appellate Court, or the High Court

or [Court of Session] in the exercise of

power of revsion or or its power under

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
Chapter XVII, is of opinion that any

person convicted of an offence was

misled in his defence by the absence of

a charge by any error in the charge, it

shall direct a new trial to be held upon

a charge framed in whatever manner it

thinks fit.

(2) If the Court is of opinion that the

facts of the case are such that no valid

charge could be preferred against the

accused in respect of the facts provoed,

it shall quash the conviction”.

As per mandatory provisions contained in S.233

Cr.P.C. for every distinct offence, a separate charge

shall be framed in order to enable the accused to

defend the accusation leveled against him. Section

233 Cr.P.C. runs as under:-

“S.233. Separate charges for distinct

offences: For every distinct offence of

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
10

which any person is accused there shall

be a separate charge and every such

charge shall be tried separately, except

in the cases mentioned in sections 234,

235, 236 and 239 Cr.P.C.

8.235 Cr.P.C. provides a proper mechanism for trial

of an accused, charged for more than one offence.

According to which if, in one series of acts so

connected together as to form the same transaction,

more offences than one are committed by the same

person, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial

for, every such offence. Sub-section (2) of 8.235

Cr.P.C. further clarifies the situation, according to

which if the alleged acts constitute an offence falling

within two or more separate definitions of any law in

force for the time being by which offences are

defined or punished, the person accused of them may

be charged with, and tried at one trial, for each of

such offence. Sub-section 3 of S.235 says that if

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
11

several acts, of which one or more than one would by

itself or themselves constitute an offence, constitute

when combined a different offence, the person

accused of them may be charged with and tried at one

trial for, the offence constituted by such acts when

combined and for any offence constituted by any one,

or more, of such acts. The following illustrations

shall clear more the above provision of $.235 Cr.P.C.

1. A commits house-breaking by

day with intent to commit adultery, and

commits in the house so_ entered

adultery with B’s wife. A may be

separately charged with, and convicted

of, offences under section 454 and 497

PPC.

2. A entices B, the wife of C, away

from C, with intent to commit adultery

with B, and then commits adultery with

her. A may be separately charged with,

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
12

and convicted of, offences under sections

498 and 497 PPC.

S.5 of the Explosive Substance Act, 1908, has been

added a schedule offence in third Schedule attached

to Anti Terrorism Act, 1997, and has been made

exclusively triable by the Anti Terrorism Court, in

the following manner:-

“Without prejudice to the generality of

the above paragraphs, the Anti Terrorism Court to the

exclusion of any other Court shall try the offence

relating to the following, namely:-

i) Abduction or kidnapping for ransom;

il) Use of firearms or explosives by any

device, including bomb blast in a

mosque, imambargah, church, temple

or any other place of worship, whether

or not any hurt or damage is caused

thereby; or

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
13

(iii) Firing or use of explosive by any

device including bomb blast in the

court premises.

(iv) Hurt caused by corrosive substance or

attempt to cause hurt by means of a

corrosive substance; and

(v) Unlawful possession of an explosive

substance or abetment for which an

offence under the Explosive Substances

Act, 1908 (VI of 1908).,

9. S.5 Explosive Substance Act and S.7

(ff) of the Anti Terrorism Act, are similar offences

except that the quantum of punishment of both the

offences vary from each other, therefore, accused

would be charged either under section 7 (ff) of ATA

or under the schedule offence but could not be

convicted under both the offences, S.5 Explosive

Substances Act, 1908, is scheduled offence, attached

to the third Schedule of the Anti Terrorism Act. The

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
14

Anti Terrorism Courts have been established in view

of the provisions contained in 8.13 of Anti Terrorism

Act, 1997. All offences with regard to use or threats

of actions, as enunciated under section 6 of the Act

and all offences mentioned under third schedule,

shall be exclusively triable by the Anti Terrorism

Court alongwith other offences with which the

accused may, under the Code be charged at the same

trial, as provided under S.17 of the Act, 1997. The

Anti-Terrorism Court can also try other offences with

which an accused may under the Cr.P.C. be charged

at the same trial if the offence is connected with such

other offence. For instance, if an accused is charged

under section 7 (a) Anti-Terrorism Act and under

S.302 PPC, he shall be separately charge sheeted

under section 7 (a) of the Act, 1997 and under section

302 PPC and on proof of the charges can be

convicted and sentenced under each of the two

sections of law, as the one relates to Special Law

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
15

while the other relates to ordinary law. This instance

can be found in Ex-Governor of Punjab Salman

Taseer’s murder case, wherein accused Malik

Muhammad Mumtaz Qadari was charged under

section 302 PPC and S.7 (a) Anti Terrorism Act,

1997. On conclusion of trial, learned Special

Judge(Court No.11) Anti Terrorism Court

Rawalpindi Division and Islamabad Capital

Territory, awarded him death sentence under section

302 (b) PPC and ordered him to pay Rs.1,00,000/- ,

as compensation to LRs of deceased under section

544-A Cr.P.C. Similarly, under section 7 Anti

Terrorism Act, 1997 he was also awarded death

sentence and to pay a fine of Rs.1,00,000/- vide judgment
dated 01.10.2011, against which appellant Malik
Muhammad Mumtaz Qadri, preferred Crl.Appeal No.90
of 2011, before the august Islamabad High Court,
Islamabad, which was decided on 09.03.2015. The

Islamabad High Court Islamabad, vide judgment dated

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
16

09.03.2015, maintained the conviction and sentence

of the appellant under section 302 (b) PPC, however,

set aside his conviction and sentence under section 7

(a) of the Anti Terrorism Act, 1997 by holding that

charge under section 7 (a) ATA, could not be proved

against the appellant.

10. We have observed in plethora of cases

that the learned Anti Terrorism Courts of this

Province (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), usually frame a

charge in cases where an accused is charged under

the Anti Terrorism Act, 1997 alongwith

corresponding offences of the Pakistan Penal Code

connected with the offences of ATA or schedule

offence, under single head by simply mentioning at

the end of the charge “and you thereby committed

an offence punishable under section 302 PPC read

with S.7 Anti Terrorism Act, 1997”, which is a

wrong exercise of law on the subject because Anti

Terrorism Act, 1997, is a special and a separate

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
17

enactment and section 302 PPC is even under a

separate Code. In such like cases, separate charge-

sheets should be formulated under each offence of

both the Statute. Similar, should be the case, in other

offences relating to Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and

general law with which an accused is charged and is

being tried alongwith the special law or schedule

offences in one trial.

11. Various provisions provided under the

Act of 1997, confer exclusive jurisdiction upon the

Anti Terrorism Court to take cognizance and try not

only scheduled offence, but also those connected

with or arising out of the schedule offence. All the

offences under section 6 of the Anti Terrorism Act,

1997 and offence under the third schedule attached to

Anti Terrorism Act, 1997, would be exclusively

triable by the Anti Terrorism Court or offences

connected with the schedule offence. The Anti

Terrorism Court can inflict punishment upon the

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
18

accused, if found guilty under any provision

contained in S.6 of the Anti Terrorism Court with the

corresponding punishment provided under S.7 of the

Act or provided under schedule offence, but cannot

award sentence under both the offences i.e. under

section 7 of the Act as well as the schedule offence.

However, in case of an offence under the Anti

Terrorism Act and general law, the Court can inflict

separate punishments under each offence of the two

enactments.

12. In this particular case, on the one hand,

it is not certain as to under which offence, the

appellant has been charge sheeted and then convicted

and sentenced. For convenience sake, we would like

to reproduce the operative part of the judgment of the

learned Trial Court:-

“Resultantly, the accused facing trial is

found guilty for the offence and as such

is convicted and sentenced to undergo

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
19

rigorous imprisonment for 7 years u/s 5

Explosive Substances Act, 1908 read

with S.7 (ff) ATA with forfeiture of his

property to the State”.

Section 367 Cr.P.C. speaks about language of

judgment and its contents. According to sub-section

(2) of Section 367 Cr.P.C. the judgment shall specify

the offence (if any) of which and the section of the

Pakistan Penal Code or other law under which the

accused is convicted and the punishment for which

he is sentenced.

13. As stated above, S.5 Explosive

Substances Act, by itself is a scheduled offence

having similarity with section 7 (ff) Anti Terrorism

Act 1997, except that both vary in terms of quantum

of sentence. Both the offences are exclusively triable

by the Anti Terrorism Court. The Anti Terrorism

Court can try other offence with which an accused

may under the PPC be charged at the same trial if the

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
20

offence is connected with the offences of Terrorism

or the schedule offence attached to ATA, but in such

a situation charge under each offence shall be distinct

and separate and similar would be the position of

punishment under each offence separately and

unambiguously. The Anti Terrorism Court can inflict

punishment upon the accused, if found guilty under

any provision contained in section 6 of the Anti

Terrorism Court with the corresponding punishment

provided under S.7 of the act or punishment provided

under the schedule offence, but cannot inflict

sentence upon an accused for an offence under S.7

ATA as well as under schedule offence, identical to

the offence under section 7 ATA. In such

circumstances, punishment under one offence shall

be inflicted.

14. For what has been discussed above, we

are firm in our view that the appellant has been

prejudiced by not confronting him with specific

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
21

charge and has been deprived of his right of defence.

Similarly, his conviction and sentence recorded by

the learned Trial Court, in the circumstances, cannot

be held in accordance with law, therefore, we by

allowing this appeal, set aside the conviction and

sentence of the appellant, recorded and awarded by

the learned Trial Court vide impugned judgment

dated 27.01.2015 and remand the case to the learned

Trial Court for trial de novo, right from the stage of

framing fresh formal charge against the appellant.

During this period the appellant shall remain as an

under trial prisoner. The learned Trial Court shall

conclude the trial expeditiously. Office is directed to

send the record to the learned Trial Court within two

days, without fail.

15. On setting aside the conviction and

sentence of the appellant, connected Cr.A. No.240-

P/2015, for enhancement of sentence of the convict

*M. Siraj Afridi PS
22

has become infructuous which stands dismissed as

such.

16. The Additional Registrar (Judicial) of

this Court is directed to send copy of this judgment

forthwith, with intimation to this Court, to the Judges

of the Anti-Terrorism Courts Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,

for their future guidance and strict compliance in

cases pending trial before their Courts and in the

freshly submitted cases, so as to decrease the agonies

of the accused involved in such like cases because if

the exercise of formulation of ambiguous charge

sheets, remain in field, it will open a Pandora’s box

through remand of cases to the Anti Terrorism Courts

in the Province, and the accused already in custody in

such like cases, will suffer for no fault on their part.

Announced.
