SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- Being booked in
case FIR No.148 dated 11.5.2016, registered under
Sections 302, 324, 427/34 PPC at police station
Mullazai, District Tank, accused/petitioner Malay Khan
son of Saleh Khan has approached this Court for his
release on bail. Earlier, he was declined bail by the
Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge, Tank, vide
order dated 12.02.2020.

2. Brief account of the prosecution story, as
disclosed in the FIR, is that on 11.5.2016, complainant
Ghazi Marjan brought the dead body of his brother
Baidullah Jan, on a tractor and made report at 1230
hours in police station Mullazai to the effect that he

alongwith his brother Baidullah were on their way from
-2-

village Kirti Haider to their home on a tractor driven by
his brother, when they reached on metal road, Umer
Khel near Mir Ali Koroona, it was about 1130 hours,
that accused Ajab Khan and Malay Khan, duly armed
with firearms were present there and on seeing the
complainant party, they started indiscriminate firing with
their respective weapons, as a result of firing of the
accused, Baidullah Jan, brother of complainant was hit
and succumbed to his injuries on the spot, whereas the
complainant luckily escaped unhurt, the tractor was also
damaged. After commission of the offence, the accused
decamped from the spot. Motive for the offence was
stated to be previous blood-feud. On the report of the
complainant, the instant case vide the captioned FIR was
registered against the accused.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. On scanning of the record, it surfaced that
the accused/petitioner has been directly charged for
commission of the offence. It is a daylight occurrence,
so no question arises with regard to misidentification of
the culprits, that too when the parties were known to
each other. The deceased had multiple injuries on his
body and the Investigating officer recovered seven
empties of 7.62 bore from the spot which lend support to
the case of the prosecution. It transpires from the record

that the tractor of the complainant was taken into
-3-

possession which has bullet marks on its body and was
damaged in which respect Section 427 PPC was added,
which further supports what the prosecution stated.

5; The learned counsel for the petitioner
argued the case at a considerable length and submitted
that the direction of injuries were from the front whereas
the assailants have been shown at points No.3 & 4
towards south which, to him, makes the case of
petitioner one of further inquiry. He also tried his best to
invite the attention of this Court that how the
complainant escaped unhurt when two of the accused
were firing at the tractor simultaneously. We are
conscious of the fact that while seized of the bail matter,
this Court is to make tentative assessment and deeper
appreciation of evidence at this stage is unwarranted,
which may prejudice the case of either side as is held in
case titled Aamir Bashir and another Vs, The State and
another (2017 SCMR 2060).

6. Besides the above, the petitioner remained
fugitive from law for almost three years and was arrested
on 27.01.2019. No explanation whatsoever is available
on record which could justify this long abscondence.
The co-accused is still at-large, so grant of bail to the
accused/petitioner would be a premium to the

absconding co-accused.
=

~4-

It is settled law that fugitive from law
loses some of the normal rights granted by the
procedural and substantive law and _ noticeable
abscondence disentitles the absconder to the
concession of bail notwithstanding merits of the case,

guidance can be gathered from the cases reported as

Awal Khan and others Vs. The State (PLD 1985 S.C.
402) and Raza Khan Vs. State (2013 MLD Peshawar-
$10).

7, It further transpires from the record that
trial against the accused/petitioner has commenced and
so far three PWs have been examined. In such situation,
releasing the accused on bail can hamper the trial as it is
now well settled that accused should not be released on
bail when its trial is in progress. In this respect, case
titled Said Akbar and another Vs. Gul _Akbar_and
another (1996 SCMR 93) can well be referred.

8. Having said so, the accused/petitioner is

not entitled to the concession of bail, hence this petition

having no merit stands dismissed. Lh
