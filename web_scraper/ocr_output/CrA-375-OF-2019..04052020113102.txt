KK
AHMAD ALL, J. Complainant/Hospital Director,
Ayub Teaching Hospital, MTI, Abbottabad has
filed instant Criminal Appeal against the
judgment and order dated 22.08.2019 passed by
learned Special Judge Anti-corruption
(Provincial), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Camp
Court, Abbottabad, whereby the learned trial
court acquitted the respondents No.1 to 3 from
the charges leveled against them in case FIR No.
08 dated 31.12.2011 under Section 409 PPC
read with Section 5(2) PC Act, of Police Station
ACE, Abbottabad.
2: The allegations against the
respondents in the FIR were that they
embezzled/misappropriated an amount of Rs.

05.07.860/ from the public funds, while posted |

at the Ayub Medical Teaching Institute,
Abbottabad.

3). The complainant wrote letter to the
Director ACE, Abbottabad on 01.08.2011 to
probe into the matter of embezzlement. In the
initial inquiry no one could be held responsible
for the embezzlement and upon advice of legal
advisor, a second inquiry was conducted
whereby responsibility was fixed upon accused
Naseer Khan and Zameer Hussain and a
criminal case was registered against them. The
ACE Abbottabad conducted an open inquiry and
found that an amount of Rs. 5, 07,860/- was
embezzled and the responsibility was fixed upon
accountant, superintendent and other officials of
Accounts Branch, however, on the basis of
affidavit submitted by accused/respondents
Naseer Khan and Zameer Hussain, present case
was registered against the respondents and upon
completion of investigation, challan was
submitted against the accused for trial. Learned
trial court summoned the accused, provided
copied to them and framed charge to which they

pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order to

prove its case, prosecution produced and
examined as many as 07 witnesses and closed
its evidence. Thereafter, statement of
accused/respondents No. 1 to 3 were recorded
under Section 342 Cr.P.C. Accused/respondents
neither opted to produce defense evidence nor
wished to be examined on oath. After hearing
arguments of learned counsel for the parties, the
learned trial court acquitted the
accused/respondents No. 1 to 3, vide the
impugned judgment and order, hence the instant
appeal.

4. Arguments in motion heard and
record gone through.

D: Perusal of record reveals that it is
the case of prosecution that embezzlement
amounting to Rs. 6,02,000/- was committed in
receipt/collection of OPD, Admissions fees. The
respondents were admittedly not posted in
Accounts branch, rather respondent Mujahid
was employed as Computer Programmer on
contract basis while respondents Naseer Khan
and Zameer Hussain were appointed as IT

Assistants on daily wages. The reappraisal of

entire prosecution evidence suggests that the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove that
the respondents were responsible for collection
and deposit of said fees, rather their duties are
computer related and not related to accounts.
Moreover, none of them is permanent employee
of the department and from the available record,
it seems that they have been made scapegoat in
order to save the skin of actual culprits.

6. Apart from the above, the name of
respondent Mujahid was not mentioned in the
application submitted by complainant (PW-5) to
the Director ACE, Abbottabad. PW-7 failed to
collect any evidence against Mujahid regarding
his involvement in the matter and no record
regarding his appointment and posting etc. was
brought on record to suggest that he was having
any nexus with the collections and deposit of
fees. The PW-4 who is an audit officer, fixed the
responsibility against the respondents, has based
his findings on surmises as there is nothing in
his inquiry to suggest that the respondents were
involved in collection or deposit of fees in any

manner, while no official/officer from the

accounts branch was made as an accused in the

| case. During course of investigation PW-1

collection recorded as Ex P-1 to Ex P-20,
however, the said record also does not connect
the respondents with the commission of offence
in any manner, rather the investigation even
failed to prove the appointment of the
respondents in the department in any capacity.

7. The sifting of evidence available on
record suggest that the prosecution has
miserably failed to prove its case against the
accused/respondents beyond any reasonable
shadow of doubt. Moreover, it is settled
proposition of law that after acquittal, the
accused earns double innocence. Reliance is
placed on “Zaheer Sadig Vs. Muhammad Ijaz

& others (2017 SCMR_ 2007), Mst._ Anwar

| Begum Vs. Akhtar Hussain alias Kaka &

others (2017 SCMR 1710), Muhammad Zaman
Vs. The State (2014 SCMR 749), Muhammad
Tasweer Vs. Hafiz Zulkarnain (PLD 2009 SC
53), Shahid Abbas Vs. Shahbaz & others (2009

SCMR__237, Muhammad __ Shafi Vs.

Muhammad Raza _& others (2008 SCMR

329)”.

8. For what has been discussed
above, it is held that learned trial court has
committed no legal or jurisdictional error by
acquitting the respondents. No illegality or
irregularity could be pointed out in the
impugned judgment and order passed by the
learned trial court warranting interference by
this court.

9, Resultantly, instant appeal fails

which is, thus dismissed in limine.
