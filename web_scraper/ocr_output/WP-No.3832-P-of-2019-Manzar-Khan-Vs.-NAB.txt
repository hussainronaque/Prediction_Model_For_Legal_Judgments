KKKKKKKKKKKEKE

WIQAR AHMAD, J.- The petitioner namely Manzar

Khan son of Sikandar Khan has sought grant of bail
by filing the instant Petition under Article 199 of the
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.

02. The allegations against the petitioner
may be gathered from Reference No.18/2007,
which was filed against him on 01.06.2007 before
the learned Administrative Judge, Accountability
Court, Peshawar (hereinafter referred to as “the
Accountability Court’). Khalid Khan and others
had lodged a complaint against the accused-
petitioner before the concerned officers of
National Accountability Bureau (hereinafter
referred as “NAB’, alleging therein that he
alongwith his brother-in-law namely Shehryar

Khan had lured the people of the locality to pay
2

for the booking of Tractors under the pretended
Prime Minister Scheme at the rate of Rs.2,51,000/-
per Tractor instead of market price of
Rs.3,10,000/- in the time span ranging from the
year 2002 to 2006, which could never be delivered
to the complainants and their monies were
embezzled. According to the Prosecution, it was a
case of cheating the public at large, therefore,
Reference was filed before the Accountability
Court after conclusion of investigation in the case.
Allegedly embezzled amount was stated to be
Rs.44.414 Million. It was also found during course
of investigation that the accused-petitioner had
been working as Junior Clerk/Crop Reporter (BPS-
05) in the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Agriculture Department at the relevant time. The
accused-petitioner was also found to have
entered into agreements with the affectees for
the return of their money but instead of fulfilling
his commitment, he disappeared. The case was
referred to the Accountability Court under Section
16 (c) of National Accountability Ordinance 1999
(hereinafter referred as “NAO”.

03. The accused-petitioner had neither

turned up during investigation nor could he be
3

arrested. He did not appear before the Court also,
and was proceeded against under Section 512
Cr.P.C, where-after he was declared proclaimed
offender and perpetual warrant of arrest was
issued vide Order dated 27.10.2007 of the
Accountability Court Peshawar.

04. Accused-petitioner was then arrested
on 14.05.2019 by the NAB authorities and after
completion of investigation and period of
remand, the accused-petitioner was sent to
Central Prison, Peshawar on 28.05.2019 and since
then, he is behind bars.

05. Learned counsel for the petitioner
draw the attention of the Court towards 2™ page
of the reference filed under Section 18(g) of the
NAO and contended that the total number of the
affectees given in the reference have been shown
to be 27 while the amount allegedly received by
the accused-petitioner comes out to be
Rs.44414000/-. He contended that the offence of
cheating of public at large do not stands out of
the record against the accused petitioner and that
NAB should not have initiated any proceedings in
the matter. He placed reliance on the judgments

of “Rafiq Haji Usman Vs. Chairman, NAB and
4
another’ reported as 2015 SCMR 1575, “Abdul
Waheed Khan Vs. Chairman, National
Accountability Bureau through Deputy Prosecutor
General and 4 others’ reported as PLD 2018
Peshawar 59, “Zahid Ali Noor Vs. NAB and
others" reported as 2017 P Cr.LJ 147,
“Muhammad Fakhar Javed Khokhar and another
Vs. National Accountability Bureau and others"
reported as 2018 P Cr.LJ 477 and “Naseem Abdul
Sattar and 6 others Vs. Federation of Pakistan and
4 others" reported as PLD 2013 Sindh 357.
Learned counsel for the petitioner also placed
reliance on Clause 4 of the Standing Operating
Procedures (SOPs) of NAB for selection of cases
and contended that in sub-Clause-D therein, NAB
authorities have been bound down to take
cognizance of only those cases where the
minimum number of affected persons are more
than 50 and the amount involved is not less than
100 million. He further added that the case is of
civil nature and conversion of the matter in
criminal domain is illegal.

06. Learned Special Prosecutor, NAB
contended that the case of the present petitioner

was initiated and investigated way back in the
5

year 2006/2007 while the SOPs referred by the
learned counsel for the petitioner has been put in
place in the year 2010, therefore, same could not
be applied to the case of the petitioner. He next
contended that the petitioner has defrauded poor
people of the locality, alluring them towards
making the payment by offering them a price
which was 60 thousand less than the market price
of the Tractors at the relevant time. He further
added that the accused had also gone into
absconsion and therefore he is not entitled to be
released on bail.

07. We have heard arguments of the
learned counsel for the parties and gone through
the available record.

08. Regarding the jurisdiction of NAB in
the instant case, it may be noted that not only a
public servant but an ordinary citizen may be
made the subject of investigation by NAB
provided the other conditions laid down in NAO
for the relevant offence are met as held by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in case of
“Abdul Aziz Memon and others Vs. The State and
others" reported as PLD 2013 Supreme Court

594. It needs mention here that though the
6
petitioner was public servant at the relevant time,
but he is not alleged to have committed the
offence in the discharge of his official duties. He is
booked for cheating the public at large u/s 9
(a)(ix) of NAO. In the case of an offence u/s 9
(a)(ix) it is the requirement of law, however, that
the cheating or criminal breach of trust is
committed in respect of “public at large”. It is
correct that the case in hand preceded the
devising of the SOPs by NAB, but it is not only a
question of compliance of SOPs but the
requirement of Section 9 (a)(ix) of the NAO 2001,
that in cases where public at large are defrauded
only then NAB can take cognizance. The said
clause is reproduced as under for ready reference:

“9. Corruption and Corrupt practices:

(a)A holder of a public office, or any
other person, is said to commit or to
have committed the offence of
corruption and corrupt practices: -

() ----

(ii) ----

(iii) ----

(iv) ----

(v) ----

(vi) ----

(vii) ----

(viii) ----

(ix) If he commits the offence of
cheating as defined in section 415
of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860
(Act XLV of 1860), and thereby
dishonestly induces members of
the public at large to deliver any
7

property including money or
valuable security to any person: or’.

09. The connotation “public at large’ has
not been defined in the National Accountability
Ordinance 2001. The word “public” however has
been defined in PPC 1860 in Section 12 as
follows.

“The word ‘public’ includes any class of the
public or any community”.

The said definition is not exhaustive but suggests
that it should be a class or a community as a
whole.

Black's Law Dictionary defines the two phrases as
follow: -

“Public:

Relating or belonging to an entire community,
state, or nation.

at large:

Not limited to any particular place, district,
person, matter, or question’.

10. The August Supreme Court of
Pakistan in the case of “Rafiq Haji Usman Vs.
Chairman, NAB and another’ reported as 2015
SCMR 1575 inter alia held as follows: -
“We are of the view that 13 persons would
hardly constitute public in its literal and
ordinary sense; furthermore meaning of the
word large i.e. “considerable or relatively

great size, extent or capacity having wide
range and scope” does not bring 22 or 13
8

persons as the case may be within its
concept and fold. Thus from this angle as
well the said section seemingly perhaps can
be held not attracted to the instant case”.
11. As held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court
of Pakistan in the above cited Judgment, the word
“public at large” should be a number of people
“considerable or relatively great size, extent or
capacity having wide range and scope”. Of late
NAB has quantified the term in the shape of Item
No.4 (4)(d) of its SOPs in the following words: -
“Cases involving interest of members of
public at large where the numbers of
defrauded persons are more than 50
persons and amount involved is not less
than Rs.100 million’.
12. We therefore have a criteria for
discerning the cases on the touch stone of the
phrase pubic at large in the shape of the relevant
part of the SOPs, which appears to be reasonable
as well.
13. Coming to the facts of the instant
case, it is clear from the Reference that the total
number of people allegedly deceived comes out
to be 27 with the allegations of embezzlement of
an amount of Rs.44.414 Million. In the case of

“Rafiq Haji Usman Vs. Chairman, NAB and

another’ cited above, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
9
of Pakistan has held that a number of 22 or 13
persons do not qualify the required number for
constituting it as “public at large”. On the said
touch stone, we are confident that the number of
27 persons also do not qualify the test of
connotation “public at large” and therefore, there
is a serious question regarding taking of
cognizance of the instant case by NAB, which is
yet to be determined by the learned Trial Court.
14. Whenever there is a serious question
regarding the jurisdiction of an_ investigating
agency, same has always been taken as a good
ground for grant of bail. Arrest of an accused
person is made because of authorization of
investigation by NAB. If the investigation is
authorized in a way that a mandatory condition
precedent is ignored then the arrest and ensuing
judicial custody also becomes questionable.
Though it’s final effect and impact is yet to be
adjudged by the Accountability Court, but the fact
that these serious questions are floating on
record, entitle the accused-petitioner to the grant
of bail. Such grounds have been treated inter alia
by this Court in the case of “Abdul Waheed Khan

Vs. Chairman, NAB and 4 others” reported as PLD
10
2018 Peshawar 59, as a good ground for grant of
bail as well as by the Hon'ble Lahore High Court
in the cases of “Muhammad Fakhar Javed Khokhar
and another Vs. NAB and others" reported as
2018 P Cr.LJ 477 and “Zahid Ali Noor Vs. NAB
and others’ reported as 2017 P Cr.LJ 147. The
Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has also
treated this ground as one of the grounds for
releasing the accused on bail in the case of Rafiq
Haji Usman Vs. NAB cited above.
15. So far as absconsion of the accused is
concerned, it is by now well settled that bail
cannot be declined merely for the reason that the
accused had gone in absconsion if his case is
otherwise fit for grant of bail.
16. In such view of the matter, we allow
the instant petition and admit the accused to the
grant of bail.
17. Above are the detailed reasons of our
short order of even date which is reproduced as
under: -

“For reasons to be recorded later in the detailed
judgment, this writ petition is allowed and
petitioner Manzar Khan being charged under
section 18(g)/9/10 read with section 24 of the
National Accountability Ordinance 1999 along with
offences mentioned in its Schedule further read
with section 512 Cr.P.C registered at Police Station
NAB Peshawar in Reference No.18/2007 shall be
released on bail subject to furnishing bail bonds in
11

the sum of Rs.10 million with two sureties each in
the like amount to the satisfaction of learned Trial
Court, who shall ensure that the sureties are local,
reliable and men of means”.
