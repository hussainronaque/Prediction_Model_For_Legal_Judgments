Date of hearing. 14.12.2020
JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- Fawad Ali SI (PW-2)

along with other police contingent was present on main road,
near Asota Lar in connection with ‘nakabandi’ when at 15.30
hours, an adolescent coming on foot was stopped on the basis
of suspicion. During his body search, the police recovered
from him three packets chars, total 3045 grams, fastened with
his body. Five grams chars from each of the packet was
separated for chemical analysis and sealed into parcels No. 1
to 3, while the remaining stuff was sealed into separate parcel
No.4. The pedestrian disclosed his name as Gul Zaman, the
respondent. He was arrested on the spot. Murasilla in this
respect was written, marked as Exh.PA/1, and sent it to Police
Station, Parmoli, through Aqil constable, where on the basis
of which a case FIR No. 331, dated 14.11.2017, under section
9 (c) CNSA, was registered at Police Station, Parmoli,
marked as Exh.PA.

2. After registration of the case, investigation was
entrusted to Shahzad Khan, SI, who on receipt of copy of

FIR, visited the spot and prepared the site plan, Exh.PB. He
also recorded statements of the PWs under section 161
Cr.P.C. After completion of the investigation, complete
challan was submitted before the court of learned Sessions
Judge/Judge, Model Criminal Trail Court, Swabi, for trial.

3. On summoning, the accused appeared before the trial
court. He was provided copies of the relevant documents
within the meaning of section 265 (c) Cr.P.C. He was,
accordingly, charge sheeted to which he pleaded not guilty
and opted to face the trial.

4. On commencement of the trial, the prosecution
produced Shah Nawaz Khan SI, who was present with the
Seizing Officer at the time of recovery and his statement was
recorded as PW-1. The Seizing Officer Fawad Ali was
examined as PW-2 while Shahzad Khan SI, who had
investigated the case, was examined as PW-3, and, thereafter,
the learned DPP appearing on behalf of the State closed the
prosecution evidence.

5. On conclusion of the prosecution evidence, the
accused was examined under section 342 Cr.P.C. He in his
statement deposed that he is innocent and has falsely been
involved in the case, however, he was neither ready to be
examined on oath nor wished to produce evidence in his
defence within the meaning of section 340(2) Cr.P.C. Learned
trial Court, after hearing the parties, vide judgment dated

14.07.2020, recorded acquittal of the accused.
6. Aggrieved from the findings of the learned trial Court,
the State through Advocate General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
has filed the instant criminal appeal.

7. Learned AAG appearing on behalf of the State
contended that since the recovery of 3045 grams chars was
made from the direct possession of the accused, the version of
the prosecution was also buttressed by the FSL report coupled
with the straightforward and honest testimony furnished by
the Seizing Officer, Investigating Officer and eyewitness, but
the learned trial court due to mis-reading and non-reading of
the evidence, recorded the impugned findings, which are
against the law and evidence available on record, therefore,
liable to be reversed.

8. We have considered the submissions of learned AAG
and gone through record of the case.

9. Leaving aside other aspects of the case as to whether a
person having narcotic substances on seeing a police party
from sufficient distance can dare to come on nakabandi,
particularly, when he had the opportunity to escape from the
scene, the leading thing to be seen in the instant case is as to
whether safe custody of the samples and its safe transmission
to the Forensic Science Laboratory is established and, if so,
whether the FSL report contains the requisite protocol as per
guidelines highlighted by the august Supreme Court in a cases
titled Qaiser Javed Khan vs. The State through Prosecutor
General Punjab, Lahore and another, (PLD 2020 SC 57),
Khair-ul-Bashar vy. the State (2019 SCMR 930), The State
through Regional Director ANF v. Imam Bakhsh and

others (2018 SCMR 2039), Ikramullah and others v. the

State (2015 SCMR 1002) and Amjad Ali v. the State (2012
SCMR 577). The perusal of record reveals that the Seizing
Officer (PW-2), though, in his examination in chief stated that
the samples for chemical analysis were taken from the
recovered stuff on the same date and in this respect an
application was also drafted by him but there is no evidence
on record to show that during the intervening period, i.e.,
from 14.11.2017 to 17.11.2017, in whose custody the samples
were lying, which throw serious doubt regarding safe
custody of the samples and its safe transmission to the
Laboratory. The Seizing Officer as PW-2 in cross
examination stated that the samples were sent to the Police
Station along with the murasilla through constable Aqil but
the said Aqil was not examined before the trial court despite
the fact that his name was cited in the calendar of witnesses
and there is also no explanation as to why he was not
produced before the court.

10. There is another important aspect of the case. The
record reflects that the occurrence took place on 14.11.2017
while as per FSL report, Exh. PK, the samples were received
by the Laboratory on 17.11.2017, after the delay of about
three days. We have also perused the application Exh.PW 2/1,
drafted by the Seizing Officer on 14.11.2017 for sending the
samples to the FSL, which reveals that parcels No.1, 2 and 3

were sent to the Laboratory, vide receipt No. 545, dated
15.11.2017 through constable Wasim ul Haq No. 1075. When
the application Exh.PW 2/1 was being drafted on 14.11.2017,
the samples were not sent to the Lab: then how reference of
the receipt No. 545 dated 15.11.2017 was given in the
application, which portion of the evidence being not
persuasive making cricks in the prosecution story.

11. Apart from the above, as evident from the receipt, the
samples were handed over to Wasim ul Haq FC No. 1075 on
15.11.2017 for its onward transmission to the Laboratory,
who, as per record, delivered the same in the Laboratory on
17.11.2017, thus, he was an important witness of the
prosecution to confirm as to where during the intervening
period from 15.11.2017 to 17.11.2017 the samples were
placed and whether safe custody and its transmission to the
FSL was safe, but, unexpectedly, neither his name is
mentioned in the list of witnesses of the prosecution nor he
was produced before the court. Even Moharrir of the Police
Station was not produced before the court to substantiate the
safe custody of the contraband.

12. When there is a broken chain of the safe custody of
the samples and its safe transmission to the Laboratory during
the intervening period, therefore, it can safely be held that the
report of FSL, Exh.PK is legally defective and, thus, not
admissible under the law. Hon'ble the Supreme Court in cases
reported as (2018 SCMR 2039), (2015 SCMR 1002) and (2012
SCMR 577) has held that in a case where safe custody of the

recovered substance or safe transmission of samples of the
recovered substance, as in the instant case, is not established
by the prosecution through any independent evidence, it
cannot be presumed with any degree of confidence that the
prosecution has succeeded in proving its case against the
accused beyond shadow of reasonable doubt.

13. We have also observed that the FSL report has not

been accompanied by the requisite protocol of the tests

applied. In the case titled Khair-ul-Bashar v. the State (2019
SCMR 930), Hon’able the apex Court has held that:-

"10. In the present case examination of the report of the
Government Analyst mentions the tests applied but does
not provide their results except a concluding result,
presumably of all the tests, which is not sufficient. The
Report also does not signify the test protocols that were
applied to carry out these tests. Hence, the mandatory
requirement of law provided under Rule 6 has not been
complied with and, thus, it is not safe to rely on the
Report of the Government Analyst dated 18-02-2016. As
a conclusion, it is reiterated, that the Report of the
Government Analyst must mention (i) all the tests and
analysis of the alleged drug (ii) the result of the each
test(s) carried out along with the consolidated result and
(iii) the name of all the protocols applied to carry out

these tests.”

Similarly, in the case titled Qaiser Javed Khan vs. The

State through Prosecutor General Punjab, Lahore and another,

(PLD 2020 SC 57) the august Supreme Court has observed that:-

“8. The report of the Government Analyst in the
instant case does not specify the protocols of the tests
applied and thus does not meet the requirements of the
law as interpreted by this Court in the cases of Amam
Bakhsh and Khair ul Bashar (supra). The said Report
cannot be relied upon for the conviction of the

petitioner.”
14. Likewise, it has now been well settled that once an
accused person is acquitted then strong and exceptional grounds
would be required for setting aside the judgment of acquittal.
We have read the entire evidence and found that the learned trial
Court has based the impugned findings on correct appreciation of
evidence on record by applying his conscious mind to the facts
and circumstances of the case. The reasons given by him find
support from the material available on the file. Moreover,
standard of appraisal of evidence in an appeal against acquittal is
somewhat different than an appeal against conviction, because
accused is presumed to be innocent in law and if after regular
trial he is acquitted he earns a double presumption of innocence
and heavy burden lies on the prosecution to invalidate such
presumption.

15. Since we do not see any cogent reasons to interfere with
the well reasoned judgment of the acquittal of the respondent,
therefore, the instant appeal being without any merit is hereby
dismissed.
