LAL JAN KHATTAK, J. Appellant Nisar Ahmad
has preferred this appeal against the judgment dated
07.09.2010 of the learned Sessions Judge, Mansehra,
delivered in case FIR No.119 dated 01.06.2002 under
Section 302/109/34 PPC of Police Station Phulra,
whereby he has been convicted under Section 302(b) PPC
for gatl-e-amd of Muhammad Tariq and sentenced to
rigorous imprisonment of life with payment of
compensation of Rs.50,000/-, payable to the legal heirs of
the deceased, in case of default whereof to further undergo
simple imprisonment of six months. Benefit under Section

382-B, Cr.P.C. has been given to the appellant.

2- Facts of the case are that on 01.06.2002

Mst. Zulikhan (PW-7) reported to IHC Mumtaz at Police
Post Lassan of Police Station Phulra, District Mansehra, to
the effect that on the fateful day her son Muhammad Tariq
left his house for duties at Civil Hospital Khamari. She
and her daughter-in-law Mst. Haleema accompanied him
to see him off. No sooner then they reached in front of the
appellant’s house, he emerged therefrom and started firing
at her son with which he was hit, fell on the ground and
died on the spot. Motive given for the occurrence was that
Mst. Afshan, sister of the appellant, had eloped for which
her son was suspected.

3- After arrest of the accused and completion
of investigation, the case was put in Court, which indicted
him for commission of the offence to which he pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial. Prosecution in order to
substantiate its case produced and examined eleven
witnesses, whereafter statement of the accused was
recorded, wherein he professed innocence. After
conclusion of the trial, the learned trial Court found him
guilty of the charge and on conviction sentenced him, as
mentioned earlier. It is worth to mention that co-accused
Sher Afzal, who was subsequently charged for abetment
of the offence has alreacy been acquitted by the learned
trial Court on 20.11.2003.

4- Learned counsel for the. appellant
contended that actually the ‘occurrence was unseen one

and both the eyewitnesses were planted by the

ee
investigating agency with mala fide intention just to
augment the prosecution case against the appellant, who
has been charged on the basis of suspicion. Further argued
that the prosecution evidence is replete with
contradictions, which are major in nature, and can’t be
ignored. It was also argued that the prosecution has not
proved motive of the case as set up against the appellant.
The learned counsel kept on arguing that medical
examination of the deceased has fully negated ocular
account of the case. Lastly, it was argued that there was no
corroboration to the eye version account and, as such, it
would not be safe to punish the appellant on the strength
of an uncorroborated ocular account, as furnished by PW-
7 and PW-8.

5- As against the above, learned counsel for
the complainant submitted that prosecution has
successfully proved its case against the appellant by
producing worth reliable and confidence inspiring
evidence, which has been corroborated by medical and
circumstantial evidence as well. It was argued that
unexplained long abscondence of the appellant is a
corroboratory evidence to his guilt. It was further argued
that a single accused has been charged for effective firing
at the deceased and there was no reason for the PW-7 and
PW-8 to substitute the real culprit for the appellant

because substitution is a rear phenomenon. The learned

State counsel adopted the arguments advanced by learned
counsel for the complainant.

6- We have heard learned counsel for - the
parties and gone through the case record.

7- Perusal of the case record would show that
complainant of the case, namely, Mst. Zulekhan appeared
before the court as PW-7 and reiterated what she had
alleged in her first information report (Ex.PWI1/1). To
support the complainant, Mst. Bibi Haleema, widow of the
deceased, appeared as PW-8. Both the aforesaid witnesses
are closely related to the deceased, therefore, their
evidence needs careful re-appraisal for safe administration
of justice. No doubt, it has been held umpteenth times by
the superior Courts that testimony of a closely related
witness can’t be discarded for his being related to a victim
but equally it is well settled that in order to convict an
accused on the basis of evidence furnished by a close
relative, the Court of law must strive for independent
corroboration to such testimony. Corroboratory evidence
consists of motive, promptly lodged FIR, recoveries from
the spot, site plan, mentioning in the FIR the description
of weapon used in the crime, stamp of injury suffered by
the complainant in case motive is common and he/she
claims presence on the spot, medical evidence of the
victim, conduct adopted by the eyewitnesses at the time of

occurrence, plausible explanation for presence of the
eyewitnesses on the spot and so on and so forth. In case
any one of the above factors is missing or negates the
ocular account so furnished by a closely blood related
witness then for the sake of safe administration of justice,
ocular evidence of such closely related witness will not be
taken into account to record conviction of an accused
because it is cardinal principle of law that to acquit
someone criminal mistakenly is better than to punish
someone innocent mistakenly.

8- On the touchstone of the above, on re-
appraisal of the case evidence, as furnished by PW-7 and
PW-8, it appeared to us that both the witnesses have not
furnished any plausible explanation for their presence on
the spot, when the occurrence had taken place. According
to the prosecution case, the deceased was serving in Civil
Hospital, Khamari, who daily used to go for his duties. In
the FIR, it has been alleged by the complainant that she
and her daughter-11-law had left their house with the
deceased in order to see him off. When the deceased on
daily basis used to go for his duties then joining him by
both the eyewitnesses to see him off does not appeal to
prudent mind because the practice to see someone off,
who is daily goer and comer is something contrary to the
common course of events. |

9- Furthermore, PW-7 has admitted in her

cross-examination that on the fateful day she and her
daughter-in-law were proceedings to their cattle shed.
This admission negates the initial version given by her in
the FIR that she and her daughter-in-law had left their
house to see the deceased off. Besides, leaving the dead
body on the spot, which was riddled with bullets,
complainant opted to leave the crime venue for lodging
the report without taking the deceased either to her house,
to hospital or even to police station. This unnatural
conduct of the complainant shows that she was not present
on the spot when the occurrence had taken place. Had she
been present over there, she would have preferred to take
the deceased to one of the places mentioned above. Such
unnatural conduct cannot be expected from a mother.

10- From the above, we can safely hold that
both the eyewitnesses actually were not present on the
spot when the deceased was fired at. Therefore, the
evidence furnished by PW-7 and PW-8 can easily ‘be
discarded, as same gets no corroboration from any
independent sources. It appears that they were introduced
in the case subsequently just to strengthen the prosecution
case.

11- In addition to the above, it is the
prosecution case that the occurrence had taken place at
10.15 A.M. and the report was made by the complainant at
11.45 A.M. but medico-legal report of the deceased

(Ex.PW5/1) reveals that dead body of the deceased was
7

brought to the hospital at 11.30 A.M. According to the
contents of the FIR, complainant while making her report
had stated therein that the dead body was still lying on the
Spot. When at the time of lodging of the report i.e. 11.45
A.M., the dead body was lying on the spot then how it was
examined by the doctor at 11.30 A.M. Examination of the
dead body of the deceased at 11.30 A.M. contradicts the
ocular version of the complainant so given by her in her
initial report and then in the Court.

12- From thorough and careful examination of
the case evidence, we have come to the conclusion that the
Prosecution has not proved its case against the appellant
beyond reasonable doubt, which is a hallmark of criminal
justice. Of course; a single accused is charged for
commission of the offence but mere charging a single
accused would not be enough to record his conviction
unless worth reliable and corroboratory evidence is
brought by the prosecution to connect him with the
offence, which is not the case here. No doubt, the
appellant, after the occurrence, had gone into hiding for
which he has given no plausible explanation but it is well
settled that mere abscondence of an accused would be no
ground to convict him because it is a cardinal principle of
criminal law that prosecution has to prove its case through |

its own evidence.
13- The learned trial Court has not properly
scrutinized and appreciated the case evidence in its true
perspective and has fallen in error to record conviction of
the appellant, which is not sustainable.

14- For what has been discussed above, we
accept the instant appeal, set aside the impugned judgment
of conviction and sentence and acquit the appellant of the
charge leveiled against him. He be set free forthwith if not
required to be detained in some other case.

15- Above are the reasons of our short order of

even date.

Announced,
28.05.2015.
