JUDGMENT
Date of hearing: 27/04/2020

Petitioner (Muhammad Idrees) By Mr. Waqar Ahmed
Khan, Advocate.

State by: —§ Sardar Muhammad Asif, AAG.
Complainant by: Mr. SardarWaqar-ul-Mulk, Advocate.

AHMAD ALT, J:- Petitioner Muhammad Idreesseeks
his release on bail in case FIR No. 233dated
15.03.2020 under Section 324/34PPC of Police station
Shinkiari, Mansehra.

2. Brief facts of the case are that the
complainant Muhammad Saeed reported the matter to
the local police in Emergency Ward of KATH, that he
was present in Jabori Bazaar for purchasing groceries.
At 11:30 hours, he was present near Basheer Hotel
jabori when Idress, AbdurRehman and Muhammad
Riaz, armed with pistols came and Idrees started firing
at the complainant as a result of which complainant

sustained injuries on his left leg. Naveed Ahmed S/o
Ghulam Mustafa tried to rescue the complainant, who
was also fired at by the accused as a result of which
he sustained injury on his hand. Motive for the

occurrence was a family dispute.

Ie

Arguments of learned counsel for the
parties were heard at length and record gone through.
4. According to the complainant, the
accused/petitioner fired at him with his pistol. As per
site plan, the complainant was at the mercy of the
accused/petitioner, however, he fired at non-vital part
of body of the complainant and as such the question
as to whether the accused/petitioner had intention and
attempted to commit Qatl-e-Amd of the complainant
and applicability of Section 324 PPC requires further
probe. August apex court in the case of “Umar Hayat
Versus the State and others (2008 SCMR 1621)”
granted bail to the accused person where the
complainant had received fire arm injuries on non-
vital part of the body.

5. The complainant though alleged in the
FIR that the occurrence was witnessed by the
eyewitnesses present at the spot, however, no

statement of any eyewitness has been recorded.
Accused/petitioner as per available record is neither a
previous convict nor hardened or disparate criminal.
Similarly, there is no allegation that the offence was
committed in the name or on the pretext of honour, as
such the question as to whether the punishment of
Ta’azir could be passed against him or not, keeping in
view the provisions of Section 337 N(2) PPC, makes
the case of accused/petitioner one of further inquiry.
Thus taking guidance from the judgment of apex
Court in the case of “Abdul Wahab& others Vs. The
state (2019 SCMR 516)” a case for grant of bail is
made out.

6. Even otherwise, to curtail the liberty of a
person was a serious step in law, therefore, the judges
should apply judicial mind with deep thought for
reaching at a fair and proper conclusion albeit
tentatively. Such exercise should not be carried out in
vacuum or in a flimsy and casual manner as that
would defeat the ends of justice because if the accused
charged, was ultimately acquitted at the trial then no
reparation or compensation could be awarded to him
for the long incarceration, as the provisions of

Criminal Procedure Code and the scheme of law on
the subject did not provide for such arrangements to
repair the loss, caused to an accused person, detained
in jail without just cause and reasonable grounds.
Wisdom can safely be derived from case law reported
in 2016 SCMR 18.

7. Moreso, it has also been held time and
again by the august Supreme Court that bail does not
mean acquittal of accused but only change of custody
from Government agencies to the sureties, who on
furnishing bonds take responsibility to produce the
accused whenever and wherever required to be
produced. Reliance could be placed on case reported
in 2008 SCMR 807 “Haji Muhammad Nazir Vs
State”.

8. The accused-petitioner is no more
required for the purpose of investigation. Besides,
there is nothing on record regarding his previous
involvement in such like criminal activities.

9. Before parting with the judgment, this
Court deems it necessary that the observations
rendered by the High Court while disposing bail
applications are not to be considered during the trial

of the accused. In this regard the august Supreme
Court of Pakistan in ShuaibMehmood Butt Vs.
[ftekharulHaq (1996 SCMR 1845) has rendered clear
guidance, which is to the effect that:-

“However we would like to
point out in no certain terms
that the observations made by
the High Court in the orders
granting bail and by us in this
order are confined to tentative
assessment made for _ the
purpose of disposal of bail
applications and not intended
to influence the mind of the
trial Court, which is free to
appraise the evidence strictly
according to its merits and the
law of the time of disposal of
the case, which of course,
needless to say, is the function
of the trial Court”.

10. For what has been discussed above, the
petition in hand stands accepted. Petitioner is directed
to be released on bail provided he furnishes bail bonds
in the sum of Rs. 200,000/- with two sureties each in
the like amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty
Judicial Magistrate concerned. Sureties must be local,

reliable and men of means.
