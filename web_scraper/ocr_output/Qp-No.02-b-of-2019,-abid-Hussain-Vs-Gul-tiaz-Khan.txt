2. Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner had

filed a complainant before learned Judicial Magistrate regarding

beating by Gultiaz Khan Moharrir of the Police Station Domel,

as a result of which he received server injuries and became

incapacitated from his left eye. The learned Judicial Magistrate

framed the charge against the accused/ respondent Gultiaz

under sections 337-A(i) PPC. The petitioner moved an

application before the learned Judicial Magistrate with respect

to alteration of charge under section 336 PPC instead of section

337-A(i) PPC, but the same was declined. The petitioner moved

criminal revision petition before the learned Sessions Judge,

Bannu, but with no premium. Hence, the instant quashment

petition.
3. Arguments heard and record perused.
4. Perusal of the record reveals that the accused/

respondent has been charged under section 337-A(i) PPC, on

24.03.2017, while the petitioner seeks alteration of charge

under section 336 PPC.

Section 337-A(i) PPC is reproduced as under:

*M.Azan/P.S* (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz.
-3-

() = Shajjah-i-khafifah to any
person, shall be liable to daman and
may also” be punished with
imprisonment of either description
for a term which may extend to two
years as ta’zir,

Section 336 PPC, is also reproduced as under:

336. Punishment for itlaf-i-
salahiyyal-i-udw. Whoever, by doing
any act with the intention of causing
hurt to any person, or with the
knowledge that he is likely to cause
hurt to any person, causes itlaf-i-
salahiyyat-i-udw, of any person,
Shall, in consultation with the
authorized medical officer, be
punished with qisas and if the qisas
is not executable keeping in view the
principles of equality in accordance
with the Injunctions of Islam, the
offender shall be liable to arsh and
may also” be punished with
imprisonment of either description
for a term which may extend to ten
years as ta’zir.

5. Perusal of the OPD slip, reveals that the petitioner

has been checked by Dr. Muhammad Irfan Wazir, DHQ

Hospital, Bannu, whereas the statement of said doctor, is

recorded as PW-02, who categorically stated that he “found the

*M.Azan/P.S* (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz.

patient having left traumatic contract and was booked for

contract surgery” The Magistrate is bound to form his own

opinion with regard to the offence so made out from the

complaint and available record, while he is not bound by the

opinion of local police, but the available record has not been

considered by the learned trial Court, while framing the charge.

The record available on file, clearly demonstrate that it would

attract penal provision of section 336 PPC.

6. So far as, alteration of charge is concerned, Section

227, Cr.P.C itself provides in explicit and unambiguous terms

that the court may alter or add to any charge at any time before

pronouncement of the judgment. The section 227 Cr.PC is

reproduced herein below for ready reference:-

"227. Court may alter charge.-

(1) Any court may alter or add to any
charge at any time before judgment is

pronounced.

(2) Every such alteration or addition shall

be read and explained to the accused."

Bare perusal of the section transpires that charge may be altered

or added before pronouncement of the judgment. It explicitly,

*M.Azan/P.S* (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz.
-5-
provides that before pronouncement of, judgment, charge can
be altered at any stage.

7. Moreover, if the accused was charged for a major
offence but the same was not proved, accused could be
convicted for a minor offence. Section 238, Cr.P.C empowered
the court to convict the accused for a minor offence though
charged for a major offence, but not if the case is adverse, as in
the instant case.

8. It is pertinent to mention that, if the charge is
altered, the Court is bound to allow the prosecution and the
accused to re-call and re-examine witnesses, already examined
under section 231 Cr.PC, which is reproduced as under:

“231. Recall of witnesses when charge
altered. Whenever a charge is altered
or added to by the Court after the
commencement of the trial, the
prosecutor and the accused shall be
allowed to recall or re-summon, and
examine with reference to such
alteration or addition, any witness who
may have been examined, and also to
call any further witness whom the

Court may think to be material.”

*M.Azan/P.S* (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz.
-6-

9. The outcome of the above discussion is that the

learned trial Court has not evaluated the available record and

erred in law by framing the charge, hence, the instant

quashment petition is accepted, the impugned orders of both the

Courts below are set aside and section of law 337-A(i) PPC is

altered to section 336 PPC, as it is triable by learned Sessions

Court, therefore, learned Judicial Magistrate, concerned is

directed to send the case to the court concerned.

Announced.
