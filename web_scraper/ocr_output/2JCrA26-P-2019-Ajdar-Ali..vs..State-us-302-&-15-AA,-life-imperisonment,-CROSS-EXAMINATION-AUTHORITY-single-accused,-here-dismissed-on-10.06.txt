and intra abdominal mesenteric vessel due to firearm injuries.

Probable duration between injury and death 20-30 minutes
while probable duration between death and postmortem 09-
10 minutes.

8.  Perusal of the record shows that the report/FIR was
lodged with promptitude by complainant (PW-5) at
emergency room of Civil Hospital Hangu, almost within 30
minutes of the occurrence and had charged the appellant as
a single accused for the qgatl-i-amd of deceased Irshad Ali.
The occurrence, admittedly, took place on metal road
Saidan Banda near Shaukat electric store which fact was
also confirmed by the site plan prepared by the I.O and the
report of FSL regarding the blood stained cotton secured
from the scene of occurrence by the I.O during spot
inspection and blood stained garments of the deceased.
Similarly the appellant was arrested at 18:10 hours by the
local police and from his possession the pistol 30 bore was
recovered and accordingly FIR No.1171 dated 23.12.2016
under section 15-AA was registered. The FSL report

regarding the recovered empties of 30 bore from the spot
has matched the 30 bore pistol which was recovered from
the possession of present appellant by Noor Wali ASI.
Likewise, the size of firearms four entry wounds with
corresponding exit wounds on the dead body of the
deceased Irshad Ali indicate use of one weapon of offence
and four empties shell of 30 bore recovered by the I.O from
the scene of occurrence during spot inspection also support
the prosecution version. The FSL report also confirmed that
four 30 bore crime empties marked Cl to C4 were fired
from one and the same 30 bore weapon.

9. The appellant has also confessed his guilty before the

Judicial Magistrate in the following words;

We are conscious of the fact that in this case the
accused/appellant was arrested on 23.12.2016 whereas his
confession was recorded after delay of 05 days thus in order
to use this confessional statement which was recorded at
belated stage requires very strong and unimpeachable
corroboration.

10. The complainant is the only eyewitness of the
occurrence who at the relevant time was aged about 18/19
years old. This witness is a natural witness and his presence
alongwith his father at the relevant time inspires confidence.
Not only promptitude in registration of the FIR but the
absence of motive to falsely implicate the present appellant
belies the impression regarding the non presence of this
witness at the time of occurrence, who appeared before the
Court as PW-5 and reaffirmed the mode and manner of
occurrence which he has narrated in the FIR. Even at the time
of recording his statement before the Court he does not
disclosed the motive for the occurrence which indeed was
known to the deceased and the appellant as explained in the
confessional statement of the appellant. The learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the appellant has mainly relied upon
the cross examination of this PW while referring to the

following portion of his cross examination “Jt is correct that
accused was known to me before this case. After the
occurrence the accused not arrested on the spot and
decamped from the spot and he was arrested later on by the
police. The accused was recognized to me by the local police;
however I did not know his name at the time of arrest”

The learned counsel while referring the aforesaid
portion of cross examination has argued that the name of the
accused was given in the mouth of the complainant by the
local police. However, we do not tend to agree with the
aforesaid submissions of the learned counsel for the appellant
because it is settled law that the Court would always look at
the overall structure of the prosecution case in order to see
whether the evidence of the witnesses otherwise coincide
with the other circumstances of the case. If the evidence
given by witnesses coincide with the other circumstances of
the case then any confusion if created through some
contradiction or confusion in his cross examination would be
of no help to the appellant because a witness at times may
either be confused by a vigilant/shrewd lawyer escaping the
attention of the learned Presiding Officer or even the State
counsel and would thus be able to extract something favoring
or less favoring the appellant without letting the witness

know the purpose of the said question. The apex Court in the
case of “Roshan and 4 others..Vs..The State” (PLD 1977
S.C 557) has observed that;

“Some counsel devote all their energies to create
contradictions, and to this end lengthy cross-examination
is conducted for hours and days which is intended to
confuse, even an intelligent person, and is not calculated
to elicit any useful information. This exercise is
undertaken because Courts give undue importance to
contradictions found in the statements of the prosecution
witnesses. The primary consideration in appraising the
evidence given by a witness is to determine, firstly, why
has he offered to testify? Has he seen the occurrence? If
50, has the witness a motive to implicate a person who was
not among the culprits or to exaggerate the part played by
any of them? If a witness satisfies these two tests, then the
Court should watch the general demeanour of the witness
in order to judge the quality of his perception and his
faculty to recall the past incidents. A witness may make
contradictory statements on some of the details of the
incident in respect of which he is deposing in Court. The
variation may be due to mere lapse of memory or the
confusion caused in his mind by a relentless cross-
examination. Very often a witness gives an incorrect
statement because he must answer every question
regardless of the fact whether he knows the answer to it
or not. It is not uncommon that the cross-examiner puts
words in the mouth of witness and the presiding officer is
not vigilant enough to check it. It is also common
experience that, without any particular intent, even
educated people exaggerate when describing an event.
Some witnesses may be prone to it more than others. Mere
contradictions, therefore, do not lead to the result that

whatever the witness has said on the salient features of
the case and which conforms to the other evidence on the

record is to be thrown over-board.”

Similarly the Supreme Court of India in case of “Leela

Ram (D) Through Duli Chand..Vs..State of Haryana and
Anr” (AIR 1999 SC 3717) has observed;
“While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the
approach must be whether the evidence of the witness
read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth. Once that
impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the
Court to scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping
in view the deficiencies, drawbacks and _ infirmities
pointed out in the evidence as a whole and evaluate them
to find out whether it is against the general tenor of the
evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier
evaluation of the evidence is shaken as to render it
unworthy of belief. Minor discrepancies on trivial matters
not touching the core of the case, hypertechnical
approach by taking sentences torn out of context here or
there from the evidence, attaching importance to some
technical error committed by the investigating officer not
going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit
rejection of the evidence as a whole. If the Court before
whom the witness gives evidence had the opportunity to
form the opinion about the general tenor of evidence
given by the witness, the appellate court which had not
this benefit will have to attach due weight to the
appreciation of evidence by the trial Court and unless
there are reasons weighty and formidable it would not be
proper to reject the evidence on the ground of minor
variations or infirmities in the matter of trivial details.
Even honest and truthful witnesses may differ in some
details unrelated to the main incident because power of
observation, retention and reproduction differ with

individuals.”
11. To recapitulate the prosecution case it appears that the
occurrence had taken place at 16:10 hours, the report was
lodged at 16:40 hours on the same day with promptitude, the
accused/appellant was directly named in the FIR by the
complainant as single accused who had no motive to falsely
implicate him. After two hours of the occurrence the accused
was arrested by the police alongwith the crime weapon which
according to the FSL report is the same weapon from which
the empties recovered on the spot were fired. The medical
evidence is in line with the prosecution case followed by the
confession of the appellant.

12. Moving on to FIR No.1171 dated 23.12.2016 under
section 15-AA. Record shows that 30 bore pistol bearing
No.F6058 loaded with 15 live rounds of the same bore was
recovered from the personal possession of the
accused/appellant by complainant Noor Wali ASI through
recovery memo EX.PWI1/I1 in the presence of witnesses
which is the crime weapon of main murder case FIR No.1170
dated 23.12.2016 under section 302 PPC, registered at Police
Station City District Hangu. The pistol in question has been
sent to the FSL alongwith four 30 bore crime empties
recovered from the spot and the report was received in

positive. The PWs produced by the prosecution were
examined through lengthy cross examination but nothing
helpful to the accused/appellant has extracted from their
month.

13. In view of above, the convictions of the appellant by
the learned trial Court vide judgment dated 21.06.2018 is not
open to any exception.

14. Moving on to the question of quantum of sentence.
Keeping in view the safe administration of justice and the
motive disclosed by the appellant in his confessional
statement, we are not persuaded to enhance the sentence from
life to death. Consequently, finding no merit in the criminal
revision No.114-P/2018, same is also dismissed.

Announced.

In case of “RIAZ HUSSAIN and others..Vs.. THE STATE”
(1994 P Cr.LJ 1730) has also observed;

“The primary consideration in appraising the evidence
given by a witness is to determine, why he has offered to
testify? Has he seen the occurrence? If so, has the witness
a motive to implicate a person, who was not amongst the
culprit. If a witness satisfies these two tests, then the
Court should watch the general demeanour of the witness
in order to judge the quality of his perception and his
faculty to recall the past incident. A witness may make
contradictory statements on some of the details of the
incident in respect of which he is deposing in the Court.
The variation may be due to lapse of memory, or a

confusion caused in his mind by a relentless

statement because he must answer every question
regardless of the fact whether he knows the answer to it
or not. Mere contradictions, therefore, do not lead to the
