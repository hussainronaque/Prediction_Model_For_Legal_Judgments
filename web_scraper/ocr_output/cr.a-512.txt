night and had gone to his village Amnwar. When he
visited his cattle-shed on 07.06.2017 at 07:00 AM, he
found that two of his cows valuing Rs. 1,50,000/- were

' nominated them for committing theft of cattles of the

complainant/respondent No. 2.

3. . Investigation in the case was started. The
cows were shown to have been recovered from the
accused vide a joint recovery memo Ex PW 2/3. Same
were also identified by the complainant vide
identification memo dated 08.06.2017 (Ex PW 3/1). A
pistol was also shown recovered from accused Saida

Prosecution produced six (06) witnesses, whereafter
statements of the accused were recorded under section
342 of Cr. PC. On conclusion of proceedings in the
case, accused/appellants were convicted of commission
of the offence and sentenced with a punishment as

reproduced above.

5. Accused/appellants then filed appeals
before the Court of learned Sessions Judge, Buner at
Daggar, wherein the Court held that appeals before the
Court of Session were not maintainable and same were

disposed of accordingly vide consolidated order dated

Abdul Sabooh/* {S.B.) Hon’ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-4.
07.11.2019 of the Court of learned Sessions Judge,

Buner at Daggar.

6. Learned counsel for accused/appellants
stated during the course of their arguments that appeals
before the Court of learned Sessions Judge were
perfectly maintainable under section 408 Cr. PC and
same have wrongly been returned for presentation
before this Court. Learned counsel also submitted that
through Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (hereinafter
referred to as ‘the Ordinance’), amendments have
been made in Section 408 Cr. PC which had duly been
adopted in the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa vide a
separate Notification dated 26.12.1975 published in the
official Gazette on 30.12.1975. Both the learned
counsel for accused relied upon the judgments reported
as 2013 SCMR 1281, 2018 SCMR 149, 1999 PCr. L J
1107, 2005 P Cr. LJ 1435, 2006 YLR 1 718, 2013
MLD 1054, 2018 YLR 96 and 2019 YLR Note 63, in

support of their contentions.

7. Learned counsel for complainant
supported the impugned judgment and stated that
Sessions Court did not have the jurisdiction to hear

appeal in the case.

judgments reported as 1994 P Cr. L J 1973, 2005
PCr. LJ 1435 & 2017 P Cr. L J 463 and opined that
appeals before this Court are maintainable as sentences
of more than four years imprisonment, have been

assailed therein.

9, The learned Asst:A.G appearing on behalf

of the State also supported the impugned judgment.

10. I have heard arguments of learned counsel
for the parties, learned amicus curiae, learned Asst:A.G

for the State and perused the record.

11. Perusal of record reveals that Clause ‘b’
of Section 408 Cr. PC has been amended vide item
No. 141 (iii)(a) of Schedule to the Ordinance, whereby
the words ‘a Magistrate specially empowered under
section 30’ have been omitted. Resultantly, power of
hearing appeals against all sentences passed by all
Classes of Magistrate was left with Court of Sessions
except those appeals falling in Clause (c) of Section
408 Cr. PC, which provided that a person convicted by

a Magistrate for an office under section 124-A of PPC,

- may make an appeal before High Court. Original text

of Section 408 Cr. PC prior to the amendments, is

reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

Ordinance has been notified to have come into force

13. Operation of certain provisions of the
Ordinance had been extended vide Notification of the
Home Department bearing No. S.O. Judl. Misc.
(HD)/75 dated 26.12.1975 published in the N.W.F.P
Gazette extension dated 30.12.1975. Same had also
been extended to erstwhile Provincially Administered
Tribal Areas of Chitral, Dir, Kalam, Swat and
Malakand vide Notification No. 127-S.0. (TA-1)HD/
76 dated 25" day of June, 1976. But it is important to
be mentioned here that relevant Clause ‘b’ of Section
408 of Cr. PC was intended to be amended vide item
No. 141 (ii)(a) of the Ordinance, which had neither
been made applicable in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa nor in
erstwhile PATA. The provisions of the Ordinance as it
existed in the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was
also extended again to PATA through N.-W.F.P
Regulation No. 1 of 1999 (The Shari-Niazm-E-Adl

Regulation, 1999). Same was extended to PATA again

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-10-

vide Shariah Nizam-e-Adl Regulation, 2009 (Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Regulation No. 1 of 2009). But it is
important to be noted that provisions of the Ordinance
in both 1999 Regulation as well as the 2009
Regulation, it had been provided that the laws, as it had
been applicable in the Province of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, were extended to the areas forming
erstwhile PATA. Reference in this respect may be
made to Section 3 of the 1999 Regulation as well as to
Section 3 of 2009 Regulation. Item No. 141 (iii)(a) has
never been made applicable in the Province of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, same cannot therefore be deemed to
have ever been extended to the area of erstwhile
PATA. Resultantly, relevant part of Clause (b) of
provisos to Section 408 Cr. PC has never been
amended in the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa or
PATA and therefore appeal for a sentence of more than
four years imprisonment shall continue lie to the High
Court in this Province in accordance with un-amended
Section 408 Cr. PC. The contention of learned counsel
for the appellants was therefore misplaced and the
learned Sessions Court has rightly held the appeals as
non-maintainable before it. So far as the judgments
relied upon by learned counsel for the appellants, are

concerned, it has no doubt been held in the case of

Abdu! Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad

EOS LIE Bay Gayle ree Ts Re US OED RES he ae Oe ee
-11-
Aman Ullah vs. The State reported as 2005 PCr. LJ
1435, by a Division Bench of Hon’ble Lahore High
Court that Section 408 (b) of the Cr. PC stood
amended and therefore appeal against the decision of
Magistrate Section 30 should lie before the Court of
Session. View of the said judgment was also followed
by Hon’ble Islamabad High Court in the case of

Jehanzeb and 3 others vs The State and another

reported as 2013 MLD 1054 as well as in the
subsequent judgment of Hon’ble Lahore High Court in

the case of Khadim Hussain vs The State reported as

2006 YLR 1718 and case of Abdul Waheed and

another vs The State and others reported as PLD

2016 (Lahore) 255, but position of the Province of
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is different in this respect as
relevant provision of the Article i.e. Item No. 141
(iii)(a) of the Schedule to the Ordinance has never been
made applicable in this Province or the erstwhile
PATA. Ratio of the said judgments cannot therefore be

relied upon in the case in hand.

14, Coming to merits of the case, it is
important to be noted that prosecution has been relying
on the evidence of arrest, recovery of two cows, a

Datsun and a 30 bore pistol (from one of the accused

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
pC ie Se oe bc ie 2 ee 2 See oc

ope
12-
namely Saida Jan), beside the pointation allegedly
made by the accused/appellants. Complainant has
charged the accused in his first report but he has never
been an eye-witness of the occurrence and it is also a
mystery as to how had he got the information about
commission of the offence by the three accused. The
accused were shown arrested, and the case property
recovered from them on 08.06.2017. Their card of
arrest Ex PW 2/2 and recovery memo Ex PW 2/3 were
stated to have been prepared on the spot. The
prosecution has been relying in this respect, mainly on
the evidence of PW-2 Salihzada as well as to some
extent on the evidence of PW-3 namely Said Jamil ASI
and the Constable namely Bakhti Gul examined as
PW-5. Salihzada Incharge Police Post Amnawar
(PW-2) has stated in his statement that the complainant
met him on 07.06.2017 at 22:00 hours, during his
routine patrolling of the area and lodged report of the
occurrence, which was reduced by him in the shape of
Murasila Ex PW 2/1. The most important part of his
statement is related to arrest and recovery of the stolen
cows, in which respect he stated that he had arrested
the accused/appellants Saida Jan, Wajid Ali and the
absconding accused namely Amir Zeb on 08.06.2017

at a place known as Teraj Kandaw and issued their

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-13-
card of arrest Ex PW 2/2. The cows were stated to have
been loaded in a Datsun, which were recovered vide
recovery memo Ex PW 2/3. A pistol was also stated to
have been recovered from accused Saida Jan vide
recovery memo Ex PW 2/3. He stated in his cross-
examination that the accused were arrested in the
afternoon. He also stated that he had not contacted the
SHO of the concerned area known as Gul Bandi and
that recovery had been effected on a tip-off given by an .
informer. He also stated that he was accompanied by
Constables Bakhti Gul and Said Wahid at the time of

recovery.

15. Investigating Officer in the case was
examined as PW-3, who has stated that when he got
information that the stolen cows had been seized by
police at Teraj Kandaw, he went there and took in his
possession the recovered cows, prepared its
identification report as well as site plan of the spot,
where recovery had been effected and conducted other
necessary investigation. In his cross-examination, he
stated that investigation in the case was handed over to
him on 07.06.2017 at 23:20 hours and that he left
Police Station Gagra for the purpose of investigation at

04:45 hours, the day following. He added that he went

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-14-
to the place of recovery from Police Station through a
route, where Police Posts Dewana Baba, Budal, Batara
and Gul Bandi as well as a check post come in the
way. The cows were stated to have been handed over
to him at 10 o’clock, and that he had spent about 1-1/2
hour on the spot, which was left at 11:30 AM.
Investigating Officer had also stated in his
examination-in-chief that he had obtained copies of the
relevant daily diaries and had placed the same on
record. There is a daily diary report on file, which

' contains excerpts of Naqal Mad No. 8 dated
08.06.2017, which shows that Said Jamil Khan ASI
had taken the three accused named above out of the
lockup at 08:30 AM on 08.06.2017 for producing
before the Court. This is very strange that when they
had been locked in lock up at 08:30 AM on
08.06.2017, then how had they been arrested on
08.06.2017 at afternoon time, according to the
statement of PW-2, from a far-off place. The
Investigating Officer has himself stated that he left the
place of recovery along with the accused and case
property at 11:30 AM on 08.06.2017. Further ahead he
has stated that he has produced the accused in the
Court at 09:30 AM. He had not clarified as to which

date he was referring to, but the application filed for

Abdul! Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad

ee a re ee i
-15-

seeking custody of the accused Ex PW 3/5 shows a
date of 08.06.2017, where at two points, the date
appears to have been changed from 07.06.2017 to
08.06.2017. Similarly, the date on recovery memo Ex
PW 2/3 also appears to have been changed from
07.06.2017 to 08.06.2017. This change of dates along
with discrepancy in the evidence of two witnesses
makes it doubtful that the accused had either been
arrested on the date and time given in the statements of
two witnesses and that recovery of the stolen cows had
been effected from them on the said date and venue.
Statement of Bakhti Gul recorded as PW-5 also reveals
that he had gone to the place of recovery i.e. Bartiraj
along with LO. The 1.0 had gone to the spot after
coming to know that police had already made recovery
of the stolen cows, according to his statement.
Regarding the recovery memo Ex PW 2/3, he had also
stated that in his presence, the I.O. has taken in
possession two cows along with Datsun and had also
taken in possession a 30 bore pistol. Statement of
PW-2 reveals that recovery had been effected by him
in the presence of this witness and later on, same had
been handed over to the L.O. Presence of this witness at
the time of recovery along with PW-2 also becomes
doubtful. It is also interesting to note that PW-1

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad

ee ae 7g mm ey
-16- ,
namely Habib Taj Constable has stated in his
examination-in-chief that the accused had been taken
for the purpose of pointation of the spot on 07.06.2017
in his presence, who had made pointation of the spot to
the I.O, report of which was prepared and exhibited as
EX PW 1/1. Though pointation of the spot has been
shown in the pointation memo Ex PW 1/1 to have been
made on 09.06.2017 but mentioning of date by PW-1
to be 07.06.2017 cannot be treated as a clerical mistake
because of change of date on certain documents
mentioned above and the discrepancy arising out of
existence of daily diary report No. 8 dated 08.06.2017.
The accused have been shown arrested on 08.06.2017,
then how could they be taken for pointation on
07.06.2017. When recovery and arrest of the accused
from the venue of Teraj Kandaw at the time and date
given in the recovery memo and card of arrest become
doubtful, it is sufficient to dislodge the whole case of
prosecution against the accused/ appellants. The
prosecution have -therefore failed in proving case
against the accused/appellants namely Saida Jan and

‘Wajid Ali beyond reasonable doubt.

16. The learned trial court while convicting

the accused had mainly relied upon omissions of the

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-17-
learned counsel for the appellant in cross-examining
the witnesses of prosecution on certain aspects of the
case, which were accepted as admitted facts by the
learned trial | Court Learned private counsel for
complainant as well as the learned Asst:A.G also laid
great stress on the fact that learned counsel for the
accused had not even disputed certain material aspects
of the case during the course of cross-examination and
thus the facts should be considered as accepted and
admitted. The principle that a fact is deemed admitted
in case of absence of cross-examination viz-a-viz the
said fact, was a principle applicable to civil cases and
not to criminal cases, as laid by the Hon’ble Apex

Court in the case of Nadeem Ramzan vs The State

reported as 2018 SCMR 149. Relevant part of
observation of the august Court is reproduced

hereunder for ready reference;

“We have specifically attended to the
sentence of death passed against the
appellant and have noticed in that context
that the motive set up by the prosecution
had not been established by it. While
discussing the motive part of the case the
High Court had observed that both the eye-
witnesses had stated about the alleged
motive and they had not been cross-
examined by the defence on that aspect of
the case and, thus, the alleged motive stood
proved. This approach adopted by the High
Court has been found by us to be
fallacious.”

Mere failure to make cross examine on a
particular aspect of facts cannot therefore be deemed as
admitted facts in a criminal case. Same has wrongly
been so considered by the learned trial Court in the

impugned judgment.

17. In light of what has been discussed above,
prosecution have been unable to prove case against the
accused/appellants beyond reasonable doubt. Judgment
dated 22.10.2019 of the Court of learned Senior
Civil Judge/Judicial Magistrate/Judge Model Trial
Magistrate Court, Buner is set aside to the extent of the
appellants/accused by extending them benefit of doubt.
Declaration of the absconding accused namely Amir
Zeb as proclaimed offender by the learned trial Court

in the impugned judgment shall however remain intact.

18. These are the reasons for my short orders

of even date, which read as follows;

“For reasons to be recorded later, I
allow both the appeals, set-aside the
judgment of conviction dated 22.10.2019
passed by the learned Senior Civil
Judge/Judge Model Trial Magistrate
Court, Buner in case FIR No. 926 dated
07.06.2017 registered under sections 457,
380, 34 PPC read with section 15-A.A at
Police Station Gagra, District Buner and
resultantly acquit the accused/appellants
namely Wajid Ali son of Arzumand and
Saida Jan son of Sher Afzal of the
charges leveled against them. They be

released forthwith, if not required in any
other case.”
