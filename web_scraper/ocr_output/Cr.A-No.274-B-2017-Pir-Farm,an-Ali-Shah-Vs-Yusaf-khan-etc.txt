Cr.A No.274-B/2017
Pir Farman Ali Shah
Vs
Yousaf Khan and others.
JUDGEMENT/ORDER.

Date of hearing 09.04.2019

Petitioner (s) by: By Pir Amjad Ali Shah and Tariq
Mehmood Khan, Advocate.

Respondent(s) by: By Mr. Bashir ur Rehman,
Mati Ullah Khan Marwat & Sultan Mehmood,
Advocate.
MUHAMMAD NASIR MAHFOQZ, J.- The appellant
through instant appeal has challenged the validity of order
dated 23.9.2016 passed by learned Additional Sessions
Judge-I, Bannu, in complaint case No.4 of 2014 whereby
complaint of the appellants has been dismissed and the

respondents/accused were acquitted.

2. Brief facts of the case are that Pir Farman Ali

Shah and 10 others have filed complaint under sections 3,7

and 8 of the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 against

Yousaf Khan and 03 others, respondents, in respect of
-2-

immovable property situated at Mouza Meta Khel, Bannu,

fully detailed in heading of the complaint. It has been

contended in the complaint that complainants are actual

owners in possession of the said property out of which 52

knalas and 03 marlas have been forcibly occupied by

respondents on two different dates i.e. 15.7.2013 and

19.11.2013 by driving out their tenants. Complainants

alleged that respondents are property grabbers and

desperate criminals while complainants belong to a

respectable Syed family of the area and they tried their

level best through elders to restrain respondents from their

wrong doing but in vain and they kept on usurping the

produce of the property in dispute. That the respondents

have no lawful justification in occupying the property

while complainants have authentic documents of title and

revenue record in their favour. The appellants/

complainants requested for legal action against the

respondents and restoration of possession of the property.

3. On receipt of the complaint, learned trial

Court directed the SHO concerned to inquire into the
-3-

matter and submit inquiry report within the meaning of

section 5 of the ibid Act. He submitted his report.

Respondents were summoned. They appeared and charge

was framed against them under section 3 of the Illegal

Dispossession Act, 2005, to which they pleaded not guilty

and claimed trial.

4. In support of the allegations complainants

recorded statements of Rashid Khan, Patwari Halqa,

Abdullah Khan ASI, IO, Sajjad Akhtar Shah, Riaz Ali

Shah and Pir Farman Ali Shah (complainants) as PW-1 to

PW-5 respectively. After closure of complainants’

evidence, statements of respondents were recorded under

section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein they denied the allegations,

however, they neither wished to be examined on oath nor

to produce defence. On conclusion of trial, the learned trial

Court dismissed the complaint vide its judgment dated

23.9.2016. Hence, the instant appeal.

5. I have heard arguments of learned counsel for

the parties and perused the record.
-4-
6. Learned counsel for the respondents raised a
preliminary objection that the instant criminal appeal is not
maintainable as the impugned order of acquittal does not
fall within the provisions of subsection 2 and subsection 3
of section 3 of the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005.
Learned counsel for the appellant controverted his

arguments and supported his appeal.

7. For the decision of the preliminary objection

reference is made to section 9 of the ibid Act, which is

reproduced as under:-

“9. Application of Code. Unless
otherwise provided in this Act, the
provisions of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898 (V of 1898), shall apply

to proceedings under this Act.”

In view of section 9 the Code of Criminal Procedure is

applicable and where no specific provision exists, relevant

provision from the Code of Criminal Procedure could be

resorted. Under section 417 Cr.P.C appeal against acquittal

lies before the High Court and therefore, the instant appeal

is maintainable.
-5-

8. The complaint under section 3,7 and 8 of the

ibid Act filed by the present appellants reveals detailed

allegations of their forcible dispossession from the suit

property comprising several Khasra numbers measuring 52

kanals 3 marlas. Their cultivators were alleged to be

restrained from cultivation of 6 kanals and 10 marlas of

land comprising Khasra Nos. 517 and 520 on 15.7.2013

while the property is alleged to be taken into possession on

19.11.2013.

9. Initially, when the learned trial Court received

the complaint, he directed the local police official for a

report in the light of said allegations. Firstly, learned trial

Court appears to have not recorded the statements of

complainants under section 200 Cr.P.C which is essential

requirement for proceeding with the complaint, secondly,

in pursuance of his direction the police submitted his

report on 04.5.2014 in a vague and in violation of the

relevant provisions of the Police Order, 2002 and Police

Rules. Investigation officer of police station Mandan was

legally bound to conduct an in-depth inquiry associating
-6-

both the parties by recording their statements as it is

legally done in a case initiated through first information

report under section 154 Cr.P.C., for the reason that a

private complaint has all the characteristics of an FIR,

when it is initiated. No effort whatsoever has been made

by the police officials to strictly comply with the relevant

provisions of law. Such vague report was not taken notice

by the learned trial Court and deviation from the routine

procedural requirements has rendered the impugned order

ab-initio, void, which has to be interfered with in the

instant criminal appeal. The said vague report further

losses its value in juxtaposition with the cross-examination

of Patwari Halqa as PW-1, specifically, his admission to

the effect that he prepared the report in Patwar Khana and

handed over the same to the police besides the fact that the

complainants or accused were not even present at that

time. So, not only the inquiry of police but the revenue

officials have also not made any effort to conduct an

impartial inquiry in a proper manner.

10. Since the procedural irregularity has rendered
-7-

the impugned order null and void, therefore, without

giving any findings on the pro and contra contentions of

both the parties, I deem it appropriate to accept the instant

appeal, set aside the impugned order and remand the case

back to the learned trial Court for trial de novo after

detailed investigation by police. Learned trial Court shall

procure fresh bail bonds from the accused/respondents.

Parties are directed to appear before the

learned trial Court on 17.4.2019.

Announced.
