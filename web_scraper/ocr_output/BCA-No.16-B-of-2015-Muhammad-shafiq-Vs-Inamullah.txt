MUHAMMAD __ YOUNIS THAHEEM, _ J.-

Muhammad Shafiq Khan the petitioner seeks

cancellation of pre-arrest bail of accused/

respondent Inamullah granted by learned

Additional Sessions Judge-I, Bannu vide order

dated 14.02.2015 in case FIR No. 456 dated

27.12.2014 under sections 324/109/34 PPC

Police Station Township District Bannu.
-2-

2. Brief facts of the case as per FIR are

that the complainant Muhammad Shafiq Khan

reported the matter to the local police to the

effect that on 27.12.20104 at 20.00 he alongwith

his brother Shahidullah Khan and other inmates

of the house were present in room, meanwhile

Shahidullah Khan started firing at him with 30

bore pistol, as a result of which he was hit at his

left foot and could do nothing being empty

handed. Accused Shahidullah Khan after the

commission of offence decamped from the spot.

Motive alleged by the complainant was that, he

has no enmity with Shahidullah whereas the

occurrence took place on the abetment of his

maternal aunt Mst. Asari Jana and her husband

Inamullah. After release of the accused

Shahidullah on bail, the accused/ respondent

voluntarily surrendered before the Court by

applying for pre-arrest bail, which was confirmed
-3-

on 14.02.2015, hence, the instant Bail

Cancellation Petition.

3. Learned counsel for petitioner argued

that respondent has been wrongly extended the

extra ordinary concession of pre-arrest bail by

learned lower court without pointing out any

malafide on the part of the prosecution; that

accused is directly charged in the FIR for

abetting the accused Shahidullah; that no notice

has been served upon the complainant and the

learned lower court without hearing the petitioner

confirmed Pre-arrest bail of accused/ respondent,

hence, the accused/ respondent was not entitled

to the concession of pre-arrest bail.

4. As against that, learned counsel for

respondent vehemently opposed the contentions

of learned counsel for petitioner by arguing that

the accused/ petitioner is only charged for

abetment and when principal accused has been
-4-

released on bail on the basis of compromise the

case of accused/ petitioner has become one of

further inquiry and the learned trial court was

justified to extent the extra ordinary concession

of pre-arrest bail to respondent.

5. Valuable arguments of both the

learned counsel for the parties, Asstt: A.G for the

state heard and record perused.

6. Perusal of record reveals that on the

eventful day in the house, accused Shahidullah

fired at his brother/ complainant Muhammad

Shafiq as a result of which he was hit at his left

foot. The allegation of complainant is that the

occurrence took place on the instigation of Mst.

Asari Jana and her husband  Inamullah.

Admittedly at the time of occurrence, the

accused/ respondent Inamullah was not present in

the house nor has the complainant mentioned any

source of his satisfaction from which it could be
-5-

deduced that accused/ respondent has

participated in the crime of abetment. Further co-

accused Shahidullah has already been released on

bail on the basis of compromise deed Ex:PB

submitted by the complainant and against which

no bail cancellation application has been moved.

Rather pre-arrest bail of accused/ respondent has

been questioned through instant petition. It has

once for all been settled in case titled

“Muhammad Ramzan _Vs_Zafrullah_ (1986

SCMR_1380), that when all the accused are

ascribed identical role, out of which one set of

accused is granted post arrest bail and the other

one is extended the concession of pre-arrest bail

and complainant chooses to challenge the pre-

arrest bail of one set of the accused, it shall not

be cancelled because they would again be

enlarged on post arrest bail on the principle of

rule of consistency, as their co-accused have

already been released on bail. As, in the instant

case the bail of accused/ respondent cannot be re-

called on technical ground, when it is vividly
-6-
seen that he would be enlarged on bail just after

his arrest on the rule of consistency.

7. So far as contention of learned

counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner has

not been served with any notice and the

impugned order has been passed at his back,

which is against the basic principle of natural

justice that no one should be condemned

unheard. Record reveals that two notices were

issued to the petitioner/ complainant, but he did

not appear. Co-accused Shahidullah and

complainant/ petitioner Muhammad Shafiq are

brothers inter se. Co-accused Shahidullah is

principal accused, while present accused/

respondent is charged for abetment. When

principal accused has been released on bail on

the basis of compromise and his bail has not been

challenged by moving any bail cancellation

petition, hence, not appearing the petitioner in

the case of present accused/ respondent seems to

be with reason and the petitioner could not take
-7-

its benefit, in such facts and circumstances of the

case.

8. Further lower court could not keep

the petition pending for an indefinite period to

procure the personal service of the petitioner as

under the National Judicial Policy, specific time

has been provided for disposal of bail petitions.

The impugned order is based on merits free from

any unilateral findings rather the same is passed

on merits on proper assessment of the material

available on record. When principal accused has

been enlarged on bail on the basis of

compromise, contesting the case of accused/

respondent by the complainant does not seem
-8-

free from any mala fide. Concession of pre-arrest

bail is always extended in the cases of mala fide

and ulterior motive on the part of complainant/

prosecution to save the innocent people from

their unjustified arrest and humiliation at the

hands of police, which principle is fully attracted

to the instant case, as such, respondent/accused

has rightly been extended the concession of pre-

arrest bail by the learned lower Court. Ref. “Syed

Muhammad Firdaus and others Vs the State”

(2005 SCMR 784).

9. No other ground such as any misuse

of concession of bail or tampering with the

prosecution evidence or extending threats to

complainant by the accused /respondent has been

urged. Besides that once bail is granted by a

Court of competent jurisdiction, then strong and

exceptional grounds are required for cancellation

thereof. Ref: “Muzaffar Iqbal Vs Muhammad
-9-

Imran_Aziz_and_ others” (2004 _SCMR_ 231).

Learned counsel for petitioner has failed to point

out any exceptional circumstance, which may

warrant interference of this court in bail granting

order.

10. What has been discussed above the

learned counsel for the petitioner has failed to

point out any illegality or wrong exercise of

discretion to convince this Court for interference

in the impugned order. Resultantly, this petition

being without any force is hereby dismissed.
