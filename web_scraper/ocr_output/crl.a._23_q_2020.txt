one year each. Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C. was also extended
in favour of each appellant. In appeal, the learned High Court

upheld the judgment of the learned Trial Court.

2. As per brief allegations levelled in the FIR by
Muhammad Hasssan {complainant}, on 03.01.2015 at-about 12:00
noon his younger brother Mustafa aged about 18/19 years, who
was a plumber by profession, went out of his house on his
motorcycle to Liaquat Bazar Quetta. He (Mustafa) had a Nokia
Mobile Phone with him having SIM No.0311-18421 19 and in the
way he met with his friend Abdul Latif volunteer at police blockade
at A-One City and told him that he was going to Bazaar and if his
phone number was found to be switched off, then he may contact
him ‘on his other mobile SIM number No. 0313-2280082, It is
further averred in the FIR that when at about 4.00 pm he
(complainant) made a call on his brother’s phone i.e. 0311-
1842119, the same was found to be switched off, therefore, he
contacted his relatives and friends of his brother. The friend of his
brother namely Abdul Latif, volunteer, told him that at about 12:00.
noon Mustafa came at A-1 City Police Blockade and gave another

SIM number to him. He (complainant) contacted at the second SIM

number, but the same was also found to be switched off. The -

complainant at his own started search, but the whereabouts of his
brother could not be traced out. On 08.01.2015, he (complainant)
saw a publication in the Daily Newspaper Mushriq, whereupon, he
alongwith his relatives went to the mortuary of Civil Hospital
Quetta and there he found the dead body of his brother.

Strangulation mark was visible on the neck of his brother and his

ri

ght eye was also removed. It was further averred that one day

earlier the dead body of his brother was brought in the hospital by :
the police authorities of P.S. Saddar from Killi Araban ‘field. On the
basis of aforesaid allegations, the FIR of the instant case was
registered against unknown accused. The appellants were later on j
implicated in this case on the basis of circumstantial evidence.
After completion of investigation, the Police submitted challan

before the learned Trial Court. i

3. In order to prove its case, the prosecution produced 07
witnesses as well as documentary evidence. In their statements

recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C, the appellants pleaded their

innocence and refuted all the allegations levelled against them.
However, they neither made their statements on oath as envisaged

under Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence in their

defence.
4. Arguments heard, Record perused.

t
5. Since there is no direct evidence and the prosecution !

case hinges upon the circumstantial evidence, therefore, utmost
care and caution is required for reaching at a just decision of the
case. It is settled by now that in such like cases every
circumstance should be linked with each other and it should form
such a continuous chain that its one end touches the dead body
and other to the neck of the accused. But if any link in the chain is
missing then its benefit must go to the accused. In this regard,

reference may be made to the cases of Ch. Barkat Ali vs. Major

Karam Blahi Zia and another (1992 SCMR 1047), Sarfraz Khan Vs. |

The State (1996 SCMR 188), Asadullah and another vs. The State 4

(PLJ 1999 SC 1018) and Altaf Hussain vs. Fakhar Hussain and

Criminal Appeals No.23-0, AND 24-0/2020

another (2008 SCMR 1103). In the case of Ch, Barkat Ali supra,

this Court held as under:-

under:-

«Law relating to circumstantial evidence is that

- proved circumstances must be incompatible with

any reasonable hypothesis of the innocence of
the accused. See ‘Siraj_vs. The Crown’ (PLD
1956 FC 123). In a case of circumstantial
evidence, the rule is that no link in the chain
should be broken and that the circumstances
should be such as cannot be explained away on
any hypothesis other than the guilt of the

accused.”

In the case of Sarfraz Khan supra, this Court held as

“H is well settled that circumstantial evidence
should be so inter-connected that it forms such a
continuous chain that its one end touches the
dead body and other to the neck of the accused
thereby. excluding all the hypothesis of his
innocence.”

In the case of Altaf Hussain supra, this Court laid

down as under:-

“7 Needless to emphasis that all the pieces of
evidence should be so linked that it should give
the picture of a complete chain, one corner of
which should touch the body of the deceased and
other comer to the neck of the accused. Failure of
one link will destroy the entire chain.”

in the above

Keeping in view the parameters laid down

mentioned cases, we proceed to discuss the evidence produced in

this case.

6. We have noted that there is neither any last seen

evidence nor evidence of waj takkar available on the record against

the appellants. The prosecution case is based on alleged confession

of Muhammad Younas, appellant before the police while

in

custody, the evidence of recovery of mobile phone and motorcycle

of the deceased on the pointation of Muhammad Younas,

appellant. There is also evidence of pointing out of place of
occurrence and place’ of recovery of dead body of the deceased
against the appellants. The prosecution has also produced the
medical evidence and the evidence qua the alleged motive that fhe :
appellants intended to commit sodomy with the deceased and on

the refusal of the deceased, they committed the occurrence.

'

7, It is pertinent to mention here that Muhammad
Hassan, complainant was real brother of Mustafa (deceased) but
he did not enter appearance in the witness box. According to the
prosecution, ‘he shifted to some unknown place, therefore, non-
bailable warrants of his arrest to compel him to appear before the

jearned trial court, could not be executed.

We have further noted that there is no extra judicial
confession of Rehmatullah and Naseer Ahmad, appellants. Insofar
as the alleged extra judicial confession of Muhammad Younas,
appellant is concerned, in this respect, the prosecution has
produced two witnesses namely Mansoor Ahmad, SI (PW-2) and
Naseebullah, ASI (PW-3}. According to the statement of Mansoor
Ahmad, SI (PW-2}, Naseer Ahmad appellant made extra judicial
confession on 17.01.2015 before Sarblund Khan, DSP, whereas
according to the statement of Naseebullah, ASE (PW-3),
Muhammad Younas, appellant made extra judicial confession
before Sarbuland Khan, DSP on 22.01.2015 and as such there is
conflict in the statements of witnesses of extra judicial confession
of Naseer Ahmad, appellant regarding the date of making of said
confession. Although according to the statement of Investigating

Officer namely Abdul Rahim Khokhar, I.P. (PW-6), Muhammad

Younas, appellant was arrested on 22.01.2015 but Mansoor

Criminal Appeals No,23-0, AND 24-0/2020

Ahmed, SI (PW-2) has stated that Muhammad Younas, appellant
made extra judicial confession before the DSP on 17.01.2015. It is
not understandable that if Muhammad Younas, appellant made
extra judicial confession about the murder of Mustafa, deceased,
before the Police party then as to why he was not arrested by the
Police on the said date i.e. on 17.01.2015 because according to the
statement of Abdul Rahim Khokhar, 1.P/1.0, Muhammad Younas,
appellant was arrested on 22.01.2015. We have further noted that
Mansoor Ahmed, SI (PW-2).has also stated that after confession of
Naseer Ahmad, appellant, he (appellant) was ‘taken to Jinnah
Town, Quetta in handcuffs for the recovery of motorcycle ete which
shows that even on 17.01.2015, the said appellant was under the
custody of police at the time of making of his alleged extra judicial
confession. It is by now well settled that the confession of an
accused before the police while in custody is inadmissible in
evidence. Reference in this context may be made to the case of

Saeed Ahmad Vs. The State (2011 SCMR 1686).

We have further noted that the police did not make
any effort to procuce Muhammad Younas, appellant before the

concerned Magistrate for recording of his judicial confession in

accordance with the law.

8. It is also noteworthy that according to the medical
evidence produced by the prosecution through Dr. Ali Mardan,
(PW-7)}, the right eye of Muhammad Mustafa, deceased was

missing and the same was removed with a sharp edged weapon

but there was no mention of removing the right eye of the deceased

with sharp edged weapor in the alleged extra judicial confession of

Muhammad Younas, appellant. It is further noteworthy that no

‘riminal Appeals No.23-O, AND 24-0/2020 7

sharp edged weapon has been recovered from any of the appellants

during the investigating of this case. In the light of above, the

evidence of alleged extra judicial confession of Muhammad Younas,

appellant is of no avail to the prosecution.

9. Insofar as the alleged recovery of mobile phone of the
deceased from the possession of Muhammad Younas, appellant is
concerned, we have noted that no proof of the ownership of above
mentioned mobile phone in the name of Muhammad Mustafa,
deceased has been brought on record. The SIM numbers i.e. 0311-
1842119 and 0313-2280082 of mobile phone of the deceased were
mentioned in the FIR. The said SIMs of the deceased were not
recovered from the possession of the appellants. Naseebullah, ‘ASI
(PW-3) who was recovery witness of mobile phone of the deceased
from the possession of Muhammad Younas, appellant has candidly
conceded during cross-examination that no SIM was present in the
recovered mobile phone. Although, it was the case of the
prosecution witnesses namely Mansoor Ahmed, SI (PW-2) and
Naseebullah, ASI (PW-3) that Muhammad Younas, appellant also
got recovered motorcycle of the deceased from his house but the
registration number of the said motorcycle of the deceased was not
mentioned in the FIR. No documentary proof was produced in the
prosecution evidence to show that the motorcycle allegedly
recovered from the possession of. Muhammad Younas (appellant)
was owned by Muhammad Mustafa, deceased or the same was in
the name of his any family member. Even, Muhammad Hassan,
complainant who was brother of the deceased did not appear in the

witness box to identify that the motorcycle allegedly recovered from

the possession of Muhammad Younas, appellant was the same

Criminal Appeals No.23-0, AND 24-0/2020 8

motorcycle, which belonged to Muhammad Mustafa, deceased. We
are, therefore, of the view that the above mentioned alleged
recoveries of motorcycle and mobile phone of the deceased from
the possession of Muhammad Younas, appellant are not helpful for

the prosecution case.

10. We have further noted that Call Data Record (CDR) of
the SIMs of the deceased and accused persons were also produced
in the prosecution evidence but as mentioned earlier no
documentary evidence was produced before the learned trial court
to establish that the SIMs mentioned in the call data record
(Exhibit-6-D to 6-Q) were in the name of the deceased or
appellants. Moreover, no phone recording or its transcript was
produced in evidence to show the nature of the conversation
between the appellants and the deceased. We are, therefore, of the
view that the evidence of CDR produced in this case is
inconsequential for the prosecution. Reference in this context may

be made to the case of Azeem Khan Vs. Mujahid Khan (2016 SCMR

274).

11. . Insofar as the prosecution evidence about the pointing
out of the place of occurrence and the place of recovery of dead
body by the appellants is concerned, it is noteworthy that no
incriminating material like blood stained earth etc was recovered
from the place of occurrence allegedly pointed out by the
appellants whereas the place of recovery of dead body was already
in the knowledge of the prosecution because according to the

‘prosecution case, the dead body was recovered from the. above-

mentioned place by the police on 07.01.2015 whereas the said

place was pointed out by the appellants on 22.01.2015. Under the

EER TED OES ETT

ARO UAE Te aE BT

Criminal Appeals No.23-0, AND 24-0/2020 9

circumstances, the above-mentioned prosecution evidence cannot

be used against the appellants.

12. The prosecution has also produced the medical
evidence through Dr. Ali Mardan (PW-7). The said medical evidence
has also not supported the prosecution case because according to
the said evidence, the right eye of Muhammad Mustafa, deceased
was missing, which was removed with a sharp edged weapon but
neither the said injury was mentioned in the alleged extra judicial
confession of Muhammad Younas, appellant nor the same was
explained by any other prosecution witness. As mentioned earlier
no sharp edged weapon has been recovered from any appellant.
According to the medical evidence, there was only two injuries on
the body of the deceased out of which one was due to strangulation
on the neck of the deceased whereas according to injury No.2, the
right eye of the deceased was missing and the said injury was
caused by a sharp edged weapon and no other injury was noted on
the entire body of the deceased to support the motive part of the
prosecution case. According to the prosecution case, the appellants
attempted to commit sodomy with the deceased before committing
his murder and when the deceased refused and raised hue and
cry, then the appellants committed the occurrence. There is no
mention of presence of any injury on the buttocks or on the anal
area of the deceased in the medical evidence and as such the
alleged motive of the prosecution has also not been supported by
the medical evidence. Hence, the alleged motive of the prosecution

has not been proved in this case.

13. We have, therefore, come to this irresistible conclusion

that the circumstantial evidence produced in this case is not

Bo, Criminal Appeals No.23-0, AND 24-0/2020 : 10

worthy of reliance and the prosecution has miserably failed to
prove its case against the appellants beyond the shadow of doubt.
It is by now well settled that even a single circumstance, which
creates reasonable doubt in the prosecution evidence, is sufficient
to discard the prosecution case whereas the instant case is replete
with number. of circumstances, which have created serious doubts
about the prosecution story. Reference in this regard may be made

to the cases of Mst, Asia Bibi Vs..The State (PLD 2019 SC 64),

Abdul Jabbar vs. State (2019 SCMR 129), Ayub Masih v. The

State (PLD 2002 SC 1048) and Tariq Pervaiz v. The State (1995

SCMR 1345).

14. In the light of above-discussion, these appeals are

allowed and the impugned judgment is set aside. The appellants

are acquitted of the charges. They shell be released from jail

forthwith unless required to be detained in any other case.
