3. On receiving the information
regarding this occurrence the police official Sub
Inspector of Police Station Ambela rushed to
Emergency Room, where he found the
complainant Abdur Rahim in his senses. He was
accompanied by his brother Fazal Rahim who
was unconscious. Besides, Muhammad Iqbal,
Sajjad Ali and Hamid Ali were seriously injured
and were lying in the Emergency Room. The

that Amin Gul was cutting trees near the poultry

restrained him from cutting trees; upon this
Amin Gul got infuriated and replied that the
property and trees grown upon it are his

Petitioner in order to frighten the complainant
and his associates started firing upon them.

Later all the three persons by the name of

also started beating the complainant-party. Due
to stick blows of the accused-party, the
complainant received injuries on his head and
on his overall body, while his brother Fazal

no

Nawab

the complainant and learned Astt: Advocate
General for the State, record with their

assistance gone through.

5. As Petitioner Arsal Khan alias Khan
like his father Amin Gul is an accused in
multiple cases registered against him, therefore,
while relying on the judgment of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan cited as 2017 SCMR
279 “Qurban Ali vs the State and others”, its
citation (b) refers to that when there is a prayer
for the grant of bail, criminal antecedents of
accused when there are list of different criminal
cases and are placed on record, the Hon’ble
apex Court observed that it was only seized of
the present bail application and _ the
effect/impact of the previous criminal record
against accused or his co-accused was not
relevant for disposing of the present bail
petition. Accused was granted bail accordingly.

Conversely, learned counsel for the complainant

referred to 2012 P CrLJ 345 (Sindh)

“Nazar_ Hussain and_another vs the State”,

which is with regard to constructive liability as
por

principle and its scope has been highlighted.
The other dictum reported in 1999 P Cr.L J 1
(Lahore) “ Rana Muhammad Safdar vs Gulzar
Ali_alias Papoo and other”, the principle of
vicarious liability of an accused at bail stage has
been stressed upon. Thus, learned counsel for
the complainant and learned A.A.G. opposed
the grant of bail in favour of the

accused/Petitioner.

6. In the case in hand, due to brutal
nature of the present Petitioner he has been
given an effective role that besides being
charged for aerial firing to frighten the
complainant-party, he alongwith his father and
another accused Ubaid is stated to have given
stick blows to the deceased, complainant and
other injured in furtherance of his common
intention shared with other co-accused. There is
direct involvement of the accused/Petitioner in
the commission of offence and being charged
for the murder of deceased Fazal Rahim
coupled with inflicting serious injuries to the

complainant and his associates. The occurrence

happened near the poultry farm owned by Fazal
Rahim who is the deceased. Apart from the
direct charge to have given stick blows, there is
recovery of crime stick of the type shown in the
photographs holding by the accused/Petitioner
to be the crime stick recovered from the spot

left behind after the occurrence.

7. There is an order passed in Cr.M
B.A. No. 204-M of 2017 of Petitioner Amin Gul
passed by the Peshawar High Court Mingora
Bench Dar-ul-Qaza Swat, the co-accused being
father of the Petitioner was held disentitled to

the concession of bail.

8. There are reasons to believe that the
accused/Petitioner is charged for an offence, the
punishment of which falls within the
prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C. The
Petitioner being given an effective role of the
type mentioned in the First Information Report,
as he has shared common intention with other
co-accused within the ambit of vicarious

liability and in view of his direct involvement to

have inflicted stick blows injuries to the
complainant-party, out of whom one has lost his
life while the others have been seriously injured
and more so on similar grounds bail petition of
the co-accused Amin Gul has already been

declined.

9. In view of what has been discussed
above, this petition has got no force, which is

hereby dismissed.
