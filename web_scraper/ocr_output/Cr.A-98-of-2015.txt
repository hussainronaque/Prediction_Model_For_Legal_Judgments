prosecution and pleaded innocence.  lHlowever, he
wished not to produce defence evidence or to appear as

his own witness on Oath under section 340(2) Cr.P.C.

6. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties
heard and record perused with their valuable

assistance.

7. In this unfortunate incident, three persons,
namely, Abdul Sattar, Mst. Zainab Noor and Ghazi
have lost their lives and one female got injured. ‘The
present appellant Muhammad Javed alongwith his
brother Mchboob (convicted accused) and nephew
Nazir (absconding accused) have been charged for the
offences. ‘The report of the occurrence was lodged by
Mst. Ashrafa, complainant (PW-2) daughter-in-law of
deceased Abdul Sattar, who alongwith Mst. Shatia
(PW-3) furnished ocular version of the occurrence.
‘The testimony of both the eyewitnesses was consistent,
confidence inspiring and trustworthy. ‘The defence
pointed out that delay in lodging the F.1.R was material

and argued that case was registered after consultation
and deliberation, however, this Court considers that
peculiar facts and circumstances of the case itself
explained the delay and the defence could not succeed
to. prove any consultation, deliberation — or
premeditation on the part of the complainant to falsely
charge the appellant in the case. It is not possible in
ordinary course of the life or even not appealable to a
prudent mind that actual and real culprit is left and in
place thereof innocent person is charged. ‘The
appellant was residing in the same vicinity and well
known to the complainant and eyewitness of the
occurrence. The appellant was duly identified in the
light of lantern, which was taken into possession by the
1.0 during investigation. The medical evidence also
supported the version of the complainant and there was
no mentionable contradiction in the statements of the
eyewitnesses, who are natural and both the witnesses
have established their presence at the spot at the time
of occurrence. Since the occurrence had happened in
the year, 1997 and the cyewitnesses furnished their

testimony after lapse of cighteen years. minor
9

discrepancy or contradiction in such a situation is
possible and the same is not material to discard their
evidence. The ocular account furnished by the
eyewitnesses was also corroborated through other
circumstantial evidence i.e. recoveries of blood stained
articles, empties ete from the spot. ‘Thus, this Court in
the light of above discussion is of considered opinion
that the charge against the — appellant-convict
Muhammad Javed has been proved beyond any
shadow of doubt and the findings of the learned trial
Court gua his conviction are based on proper
appreciation of evidence and the law applicable
thereto, which needs no interference by this Court in

its Appellate jurisdiction to that extent.

8. Ilowever, the question left to be determined
and considered by this Court is whether quantum of
nee awarded to the appellant, Muhammad Javed
was legally justified in the circumstances of the case in
view of the principles enunciated by the august Apex
Court in this respect. This Court considers that the

motive could not be proved by the prosecution through
10

cogent and reliable evidence during trial. It is well
settled that once motive was alleged by the
prosecution, then it was under Icgal obligation to
establish the same. This Court is of the considered
opinion that death penalty amounts to deprive a person
of his life, therefore, the Courts have to take great care
and caution, while awarding such capital punishment
to an accused person and to ensure that the evidence
which is being made basis for capital punishment is
consistent, cogent, reliable, independent — and
confidence inspiring and = coming — through
unimpeachable source. In these peculiar facts and
circumstances, and particularly in absence of any deep
routed blood feud enmity, this Court considers that
death sentence awarded to the appellant-convict by the
learned trial Court was not legally justified. In case of
SCMR_ 1797), the Hon’ble Apex Court, while
considering lack of direct motive against appellant
Allah Wasaya, as mitigating circumstance, altered the

sentence of death to imprisonment for life on two
counts. Reliance in this respect is also placed on case
titled Ijaz Ahmad Vs. The State (2017 SCMR 1941),
Amanat _Ali_Vs._ The State (2017 SCMR_ 1976),
Fayyaz alias Faizi Vs. The State (2017 SCMR 2024),

Rehmat Khan Vs. The State (2017 SCMR 2034),

Saifullah Vs. The State (2017 SCMR 2041) and

Ghulam Muhammad Vs. The State (2017 SCMR

2048).

10. Apart from the above, the Ilon’*ble Supreme
Court of Pakistan in a case reported as 2009 SCMR
1188 titled “Mir Muhammad alias Miro Vs. The
State” has held that it will not be out of place to
emphasize that in criminal cases, the question of
quantum of sentence requires utmost care and caution
on the part of the courts, as such decisions restrict the
life and liberties of the people. Indeed the accused
persons are also entitled to mitigating benefit of doubt

to the extent of quantum of sentence.

Il. Before parting with the judgment, it may be

mentioned here that initially, co-accused Mchboob was
arrested in this case and his trial was conducted by the
learned trial Court, who was subsequently convicted
and sentenced to death in this case vide judgment
dated 18.04.2008. The conviction and sentence of said
co-accused was maintained by this Court and Criminal
Appeal No.15/2008 was dismissed by this Court vide
judgment dated 19.01.2011 and death sentence
awarded to Mehboob was confirmed. Ilowever, the
august Apex Court has reduced the sentence of death
to that of life imprisonment in respect of convict
Mcehboob Criminal Appeal No.397 of 2011 filed by
him. ‘The relevant extract of the judgment of the

august Apex Court is reproduced below:

“After hearing the learned counsel for
the parties and going through the record
we have observed that according to the
prosecution three assailants had caused
multiple injuries to four victims and it
had nowhere been specified at any stage
of this case as to which one of the
assailants had caused which injury to the
victim. It is, thus, not clear as to where
the appellant had caused any injury to
any victim which injury had proved fatal.
This Court has already held that where it
is not clear in a case as to which one of
the accused persons had caused the fatal
injury to the deceased there the sentence
of death may be withheld by way of
abundant caution and a reference in this
respect may be made to the cases of

In view of the circumstances of the case
mentioned above we have decided to
exercise caution in the matter of the
appellant’s sentences of death. This
appeal is, therefore, dismissed to the
extent of the convictions and sentences of
the appellant recorded and upheld by the
courts below except to the extent of the
sentences of death passed against the
appellant on two counts of the charge
under section 302(b), PPC which
sentences of death are reduced to
imprisonment for life on each such
count. All the sentences of imprisonment
passed against the appellant shall run
concurrently to each other and the
benefit under section 382-B, Cr.P.C shall
be extended to him. This appeal is

disposed of in these terms.”

12. Thus, in view of above discussion and
decision of the august Apex Court in the case of
convict co-accused, Mchboob, this appeal is partially
allowed and the sentences of death on two counts
under Section 302(b) PPC, are altered to that of
imprisonment for life. Llowever, all other sentences
awarded to the appellant by the learned trail Court
shall remain intact.

Murder Reference No.03-A/2015 sent by the

learned Sessions Judge, Manschra under Section 374

of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 for confirmation
of death sentence awarded to appellant Muhammad
Javed son of Jumma, is answered in negative
