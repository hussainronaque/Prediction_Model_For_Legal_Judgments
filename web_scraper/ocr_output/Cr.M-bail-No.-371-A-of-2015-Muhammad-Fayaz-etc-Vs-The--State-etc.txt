QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- Muhammad
Fayaz and Rafique, accused/petitioners,
are seeking post arrest bail in case vide
FIR No.40 dated 25.02.2015 under
Sections 302/201/109/34 PPC, Police
Station Nara, Abbottabad, which was
registered on the report of Muhammad
Fareed, complainant/respondent No.2, who
reported to the police about the ‘Qat/-i-
Amd’ of his son Yasir Mahmood, who was
plying his Potohar Jeep on daily basis from

his village to Bodla for passengers
commuting between the two places; but
could not be contacted on telephone by
the complainant till 9.30 P.M on the day of
occurrence. According to the FIR, when
the complainant had taken passengers in
his vehicle to Havelian, he was asked by
an unknown person on his cell phone to
search for his son near the house of his
maternal uncle, whereupon he contacted
his near relative Imran and his brother
Muhammad Hafiz to search for Yasir
Mahmood, who, after some time, informed
him about the dead body of Yasir
Mahmood lying in Bandiyan. On reaching
the spot, he found the local police there on
the scene of occurrence and _ satisfied
himself that the accused/petitioners along
with co-accused Shoukat Ali, Shiraz and
Muhammad Fayaz had committed the
‘Qatl-i-Amd’ of his deceased son on the
instigation of Mst. Rehana Bibi, wife of

Shiraz, for unknown reasons after calling
the deceased from the house of Imran,
where he was staying on the direction of
the complainant. The complainant alleged
that Yasir Mahmood was killed after
subjecting him to torture. The report was
lodged at 1300 hours on the following day
of the occurrence i.e. 25.02.2015 and FIR
was registered on the same day at 1530
hours on the basis of Murasila drafted by
Muhammad Parvaiz, ASI. In his
supplementary statement under section
164 Cr.PC recoded on 09.03.2015, the
complainant also charged co-accused
Muhammad Salim for abetment and
helping the other co-accused in the
disposal of the dead body of his deceased
son.

2. During investigation, deceased Yasir
Mahmood was medically examined and the
Medical Officer found the cause of his
death ‘because of = strangling with

something like cloth but not rope’, and had
‘strangled vigorously’ and ‘head (forehead)
struck against something very hard, like
rock-edges’, leading to death of the
deceased because of ‘suffocation and head
injury’. The co-accused, namely, Shoukat
Zaman and Shiraz Khan were arrested on
01.03.2015; while the remaining co-
accused, including accused/petitioners,
remained at large, therefore, were
proceeded against under Sections 204 and
87 Cr.PC. Accused/petitioner Muhammad
Fayaz was arrested on 18.03.2015, while
accused/petitioner Muhammad _ Rafique
was” arrested on 09.04.2015. After
completion of investigation, complete
challan has been submitted in the case by
the police/prosecution on 29.06.2015.

3. Arguments of the learned counsel
for the accused/petitioners, the learned
AAG assisted by learned counsel for
complainant/respondent No.2 heard, and

record perused.
4. It may be pointed out, at the
outset, that co-accused Shoukat Ali alias
Shoukat Zaman had been released on post
arrest bail by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-III, Abbottabad, vide order
dated 03.04.2015, and _ petition for
cancellation of his bail was dismissed by
this Court on 08.06.2015. It may also be
added here that co-accused Shoukat Ali
alias Shoukat Zaman was charged for
exactly the same role which has been
attributed to the accused/petitioners.

5. Besides, the occurrence is
admittedly unseen and the complainant
has not disclosed either his source of
information or the basis for his satisfaction
about involvement of the
accused/petitioners in the commission of
the offence, as he charged the
accused/petitioners on mere suspicion.

Likewise, nothing incriminating has been
recovered from the possession of the
accused/petitioners, neither they have
made confessional statement despite
remaining in police custody. In the
circumstances, the so-called pointation of
the scene of occurrence, by’ the
accused/petitioners already known to the
police, would hardly be a valid reason for
refusal of bail to the accused/petitioners,
when they are even otherwise entitled to
the concession of bail under the rule of
consistency.

6. Furthermore, the
accused/petitioners are behind the bars
after their arrest but no longer required for
the purpose of _ investigation, as
investigation in the case is complete and
complete challan in the case has been
submitted on 29.06.2015.

7. In view of the above, the
application is accepted and the

accused/petitioners are admitted to post
arrest bail, but subject to furnishing bail
bonds in the sum of Rs.100,000/- each
with two sureties each in the like amount
to the satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial

Magistrate.
