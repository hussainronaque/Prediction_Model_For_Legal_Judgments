Respondent...

QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- Having been
declined bail by the learned Special Judge
Anti Corruption KPK, Camp Court
Abbottabad, vide order dated 16.09.2015,
accused/petitioner, Sardar Sameer Asmat,
has approached this Court for post arrest
bail in case vide FIR No.07 dated
09.09.2015 under Section 161 PPC read
with Section 5(2) Prevention of Corruption
(PC) Act, registered in Police Station Anti
Corruption Establishment (ACE), Haripur,

on the report of Haq Nawaz Khan,
complainant/respondent No.2, a
government contractor, who reported to
the Circle Officer about demand of illegal
gratification of Rs.20,000/- by the SDO
concerned, the accused/petitioner, in order
to issue cheque for return of security to
him for the work completed by him for the
Public Health Department Haripur. In his
report, the complainant offered to serve as
trap agent for action against the
accused/petitioner.

2. The trap report prepared by Sardar
Jawad Ahmed, Judicial Magistrate-II,
Haripur, showed recovery of signed 20
currency notes, Rs.1000/- each, from the
possession of the accused/petitioner in the
presence of staff of Anti Corruption
Department. The accused/petitioner was,
therefore, arrested in the case.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for

the  accused/petitioner and learned
Assistant Advocate General heard, and
record perused.

4. The complainant/respondent No.2
appeared before the learned Additional
Registrar of this Court and expressed his
desire to be represented by the State
Counsel.

5. The arguments of the _ learned
counsel for the accused/petitioner focused
on two essential ingredients of the case,
namely, witnessing of passing of money
and hearing of conversation between the
trap agent and the accused/petitioner by
the raiding Magistrate. The learned counsel
further argued that no explanation was
sought from the accused/petitioner for
recovery of the marked currency notes by
the Magistrate nor his statement was
recorded, and that in his statement
recorded by the 1.0., the
accused/petitioner did furnish his

explanation by saying that his father,
Asmat Ullah Khan Gandapur, was posted
as SDO in Haripur and that brother of the
complainant Haq Nawaz namely Shoukat,
Sub Engineer, C & W Haripur, was his
subordinate, who had borrowed
Rs.30,000/- from his father, out of which,
Rs.20,000/- were returned to him by the
complainant at the relevant time.

6. Regardless of the plea of defence
taken by the accused/petitioner in his
statement to the I.0 under Section 161
Cr.PC, it is, indeed, a fact that both the
offences with which the accused/petitioner
has been charged do not fall within the
prohibitory clause contained in Section 497
Cr.PC, as maximum penalty prescribed for
offence under Section 161 Cr.PC is three
years, whereas the penalty provided for
Section 5 (2) of the PC Act, 1947, is up to
seven years. Moreover, in both the
Sections of law, it has been left to the

discretion of the trial Court to either award
the penalty of imprisonment or impose
fine, or sentence an accused to both the
penalties of imprisonment and fine, thus
clearly leaving scope of only imposition of
fine only at the discretion of the trial
Court, in which case refusal of bail to the
accused/petitioner, resulting in his
incarceration till conclusion of the trial,
would amount to double jeopardy, in view
of the judgment of this Court reported as
PLD 1993 Peshawar 104.

7. Even otherwise, grant of bail in
offences not falling within the prohibitory
clause of Section 497 (1) Cr.PC was a rule
and refusal thereof an exception in the
light of judgment cited at the bar by the
learned counsel for the accused/petitioner
i.e. 2013 P.Cr.LJ 1051 (Sindh). In any
case, bail cannot be withheld as a
punishment in view of the judgment of the
august Apex Court reported as 2011

SCMR 161.
8. Consequently, on the acceptance of
the application, the accused/petitioner is
admitted to bail in the case provided he
furnishes bail bonds in the sum _ of
Rs.100,000/- with two sureties each in the
like amount to the â€” satisfaction of

Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate.
