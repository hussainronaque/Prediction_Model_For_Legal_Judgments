B of 2018, titled Mst. Anwar Bibi Vs The State etc,
being arisen out of one and same judgment dated

*Azam/P.S* (D.B) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
the convict / appellant Zahir Shah for enhancement of
his conviction.

4, Concisely the facts, as is evident from the

F.LR Ex: PW-3/1, lodged by the complainant Mst.
Anwar Bibi in the emergency room of civil Hospital
Bannu are that on the eventful day, her husband Abdus
Samad was busy in recitation of Holy Quran in the
courtyard of Masjid adjacent to her house, while she
was taking breakfast for him from her house; that as
soon as she reached near the Masjid , it was about 0615
hours, in the meanwhile the accused/ appellant Zahir
Shah S/O Mirali Resident of Ameen Mughal Khel
armed with repeater 12 bore shot gun and Kalashnikov
came there, first he fired with repeater 12 bore shot gun
and then made firing at him with Kalashnikov,
resultantly deceased was hit and fell to the ground.
Thereafter accused fled away from the spot, when she
attended her husband, he was breathing his last and

died on the spot. There was a money dispute between

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr, Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
the accused and the appellant/accused. Allegedly the
occurrence was also witnessed by another wife of
deceased namely Mst. Mehtab Jani.

5. The report of the complainant was

reduced into writing in shape of murasila (Ex.PW 4/1)
by Rahmatullah ASI and thereafter he prepared the
injury sheet and inquest report of deceased Haji Abus
Samad and handed over to constable Samiullah
No.5870 FRP for escorting the dead body to the doctor
for PM examination, while murasila was sent to the
Police station through constable Rashid No.5890 for
registration of case against the accused, the contents of
which were incorporated into F.ILR (Ex.PW 3/1). Copy
of F.I.R was handed over to Muhabbat Khan ASI CTD
for conducting investigation, who on receipt of it,
proceeded to the spot, where he prepared site plan
(Ex.PW 11/1) on the pointation of complainant Mst.
Anwar Bibi. During spot inspection, he also secured

blood through cotton from the mate and also took into

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
possession 02 empties of 12 bore from the place of
appellant/ accused as well as blood stained Qamees of
deceased, sent by the doctor through constable,
Samiullah No.5870, from the hospital, packed and
sealed in parcels on the spot and in this respect, also
prepared recovery memos Ex.PW 9/1 and Ex.PW 9/2
respectively. He also placed on file the result of blood
stained articles and that of empty shells which were
available on as Ex.PW 11/2 and Ex.PW 11/3
respectively. After completion of codel formalities, he
submitted complete challan against the appellant/
accused for the purpose of proceedings U/S 512

Cr.P.C.

6. After arrest of accused/appellant on 13-

10-2015, supplementary challan was submitted
against him in the trial court. He was summoned
from Central Jail Bannu. Copies U/S 265-C Cr.P.C

were supplied to him. Thereafter he was charge

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS, Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah,
sheeted, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed

trial.

7. In order to prove its case, prosecution
examined as many as (11) witnesses. After closure
of the prosecution evidence, statement of appellant/
accused Zahir Shah was recorded under section 342
Cr.P.C, wherein he professed innocence. He neither
wished to be examined on oath, as required under
section 340 (2)Cr.P.C. nor opted to produce defence
evidence. After hearing the prosecutor and defence,
learned trial court convicted and sentenced appellant/
accused, as mentioned earlier, hence the instant

appeal.

8. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties

heard and record perused with their valuable

assistance.

9. The complainant Mst. Anwar Bibi widow

of the deceased Haji Abdus Samad reported the matter

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
at 07.30 hours on 19.09.2014 at DHQ Hospital Bannu,
to one Rehmatullah ASI, PW-04, regarding the death
of her husband in the mosque of the village. The story
narrated in the F.I.R that the deceased, while reciting
the Holy Quran in the mosque situated near his house
that accused/ appellant Zahir Shah came duly armed
with a 12 bore repeater (shotgun) and a Kalashnikov
and opened firing initially, with his 12 bore shotgun
and thereafter with his Kalashnikov and the occurrence
was stated to be witnessed by the complainant Mst.
Anwar Bibi and eye-witness Mst. Mehtab Jani who
was examined as PW-10. The parties are closely related
as the accused is brother-in-law of the deceased and
PW-10 Mehtab Jani is sister of the accused/ appellant,
though issueless. The spot is a small mosque
comprising of one room and a little courtyard where the
deceased was shown at point No.1, while reciting the
Holy Quran, the accused/ appellant was shown at point

No.4 and the complainant alongwith PW-10 at point

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
No.3 and 4 respectively. The complainant was
examined as PW-09, who when appeared before the
trial Court, stated that as per routine she in the company
of PW-10, her soken (2 wife of her husband) used to
take breakfast for the deceased to the mosque and that
on the eventful morning when they were near to reach
the mosque, while in possession of breakfast, that the
accused emerged and with loud voice addressed the
deceased “Haji Gul how are you” with the voice the
deceased stood up and the accused started firing which
landed on his chest with two entry wounds. The
complainant while reporting the matter did not say a
word regarding addressing of deceased by the accused,
but during her court statement she improved and the
only purpose behind was to bring her statement in line
with the medical evidence, as on record the deceased
was shown with his face towards west, while reciting
the Holy Quran, whereas his back was exposed to the

accused/ appellant and if this was so then the seat of

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.

injuries must have been on the back, but in fact nobody
witnessed the occurrence rather the witnesses are
chance witnesses and the report was made after
preliminary investigation. In case titled “Noor

Muhammad Vs The state and another” (2010 SCMR

97), it is held that:

“There was no impediment or any
hurdle in the way of the
complainant or any other witness
to have gone to the police station
for lodging the report. It appears
that when the deceased was
removed from the place of
incident to the hospital they must
had passed from Rawat Police
Station and could have easily stop
therefore, for a little while for
lodging the report and at that time
the deceased was also in his
senses he could have given the
true facts about the incident to the
police but the complainant and
P.Ws. did not choose to do so.
Even one of the P.Ws. could have
been dropped at the Rawat for
lodging the report but this had

also not happened.”

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-10-

10. The distance between the mosque and the

house of the deceased was nearly forty / fifty feet and
there was hardly any occasion for the deceased to be
provided with breakfast as he could easily afford
coming home for the same. This introduction of
breakfast by the complainant is after thought with the
only purpose to establish her presence on the spot.
During spot inspection neither the Thermos, tea cups
nor pot containing Parathas was produced to the
investigating officer and so the Rahil and the Holy
Quran, while preparing the site-plan. The presence of
these two witnesses is doubtful as both of them were
Parda Nasheen Ladies and their coming to the mosque
in this part of the country does not appeal to a prudent
mind. Admittedly, both the ladies are illiterate and it
was hard for them to specify the weapons as in routine
the women of these areas are alien to the weapons and
what to say of its bore. The witnesses were chance

witnesses as they could not establish their presence on

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-ll-

spot and the story so tailored does not appeal to prudent
mind that the accused at the time of occurrence was
armed with two weapons and used one after the other
for commission of the offence. This aspect was further
belied by the circumstantial evidence, as no empty of
7.62 bore was recovered from the spot and even the
F.S.L report in respect of the empties so collected could
not connect the appellant with commission of the
offence. In case titled “G.M Niaz Vs the State” (2018

SCMR 506), wherein it is held that:

“The said eye-witnesses were not
only very closely related to the
deceased but they were also chance
witnesses who had utterly failed to
bring anything on the record
establishing their claimed presence
with the deceased at the relevant
time.”

11. The prosecution story is full of infirmities

with all efforts made to improve so that harmony could
be achieved between the circumstantial and medical
evidence. The complainant stated that soon after the

occurrence the dead-body was wrapped in a Chadar

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-12-

and was placed in a Flying Coach and was taken to the
Hospital, where the matter was reported. The
identification before the police and the Doctor during
Post Mortem, examination show that the identifiers
were the brothers of the complainant which suggests
that in fact the people attracted to the spot and also
brothers of the complainant, who took the dead-body
to the hospital and that the complainant was not
accompanying the dead-body, this was further clarified
when PW-04 Samiullah constable was examined, who
categorically stated that they rushed to the spot on
receiving the information and escorted the dead-body
from spot to the hospital, this contention of PW-07
takes the cart in another direction and his testimony
cannot be ignored and if we trust this witness then we
cannot hold otherwise but to say that the report was
made on the spot after the police arrived and thereafter
the dead-body was taken to the hospital after

preliminary investigation. In case titled “Nazeer

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-13-

Ahmad Vs the State and others” (2019 SCMR 594),
wherein it is held that:

“The FIR in respect of the
incident in issue had not been
lodged at the Police Station
giving rise to an inference that
the same had been lodged and
registered after deliberations
and preliminary investigation.
The record of the case shows
that some stranger had
informed the police about the
occurrence and that stranger
had never been identified or

produced during the trial.”

12. The investigating officer came to the spot,

who effected recoveries on pointation of the
complainant and thereafter the site-plan was prepared.
The pointation was made only by the complainant
whereas PW-10, Mst. Mehboob Jani figures nowhere
and we are surprised that when the Post Mortem was
conducted and the investigating officer reached to the
spot why the male members of the family were not

associated with the process of recovery, that why the

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-14-

complainant being a lady was preferred to be a
marginal witness and that why the complainant or the
investigating officer kept silence regarding presence of
PW-10, Mst. Mehboob Jani, who too was the wife of
the deceased. The investigating officer appeared as
PW-11, and was cross-examined who stated that he
recovered 2 empties of 12 bore from the spot alongwith
blood, but neither the Rahil nor the Holy Quran was
taken into possession. This witness was further cross-
examined and he admitted that he observed no bullet
marks on the surrounding walls of the mosque. PW-10
during her Court statement stated that when the
deceased fell on the ground the complainant took his
head in her lap and by then blood was oozing from the
wounds, but surprisingly neither her hands nor her
clothes were besmeared with blood. The complainant
was asked regarding caliber of the weapons, who stated
that she learnt it from her husband as he was fond of

weapons. The complainant further stated that the

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-15-

weapon used were taken by the accused from their
house as the relation between the two i.e. the accused
and deceased were cordial. Nothing was brought on
record that what prompted the accused to kill the
deceased, though the complainant introduced a dispute
over an outstanding amount which had brought them at
daggers drawn, to her it was the said cause which led
to the death of the deceased.

13. The witnesses made improvements with

the sole purpose to bring their statements in line with
the story they forwarded. The witness stated that the
deceased had longstanding civil dispute with his
nephews where the accused/ appellant took active part
and supported the deceased and when the dispute came
to an end the accused demanded Rs. 50,00,000/-(Fifty
lacs) from the deceased and the deceased was not
ready to honour the demand so this incident. The
prosecution could not bring anything on record to

justify the claim. The investigating officer failed to

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-16-

collect any material and the complainant did not
produce any witness to substantiate her stance, the
introduction of money dispute was after thought with
malafide intentions. The motive alleged could not be
proved. The motive once alleged, if not established will

weigh against the prosecution. In case titled

"Muhammad Ashraf alias Acchu_ Vs The _ State"

(2019 SCMR 652 Para-7), wherein it has been held: -

"7. The motive is always a
double-edged weapon. The
complainant Sultan Ahmad
(PW9) has admitted murder
enmity between the parties and
has also given details of the
same in his statement recorded
before the trial court. No doubt,
previous enmity can be a reason
for the appellant to commit the
alleged crime, but it can equally
be a reason for the complainant
side to falsely implicate the
appellant in this case for

previous grouse."

14. The prosecution case even lacks its

support from the medical evidence as admittedly the

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-17-

deceased was reciting Holy Quran in the mosque and
was facing west whereas the accused/ appellant was
standing at point No.4, just behind the deceased at a
distance of 16 feet and the deceased received two
firearm entry wounds on his chest and even the Doctor
opined that an X-Ray was done and the pellets were
lying in group form. The medical evidence is in conflict
with the ocular account, on one hand if the statement of
the complainant was taken to be correct the entry
wounds should have been from the back. Keeping in
view the distance as per medical jurisprudence a 12
bore shotgun cause an entry wound from 12 feet as 5X8
inches, and the pellets will enter separately, the doctor
has given the dimension 1"x1" which cannot be caused
from such a long distance.

15. The learned counsel stressed again and

again the inter-se relationship between the parties and
he vehemently contended that how a sister i.e. PW-10,

would depose against her brother and to the learned

*Azam/P,S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-18-

counsel on this score alone the appeal merits dismissal,
but we say sorry, if his contention was acceded to then
results would be dangerous. This Court cannot go with
emotions and sentiments of the people involved but to
follow the dictates of law, failing which the desired
goals can never be achieved and its failure will bring
the judicial machinery to a halt. This being the Court
of appeal and is under heavy obligations to scan and
scan the record, so that a just and fair conclusion could
be drawn. In case in hand the relation is admitted but
the presence of the witnesses on the spot at the time of
the occurrence was not established.

16. The learned counsel for the appellant

vehemently argued that the accused/ appellant
remained absconder for sufficient long time, but mere
absconsion of accused is not conclusive guilt of an
accused person; it is only a suspicious circumstance
against an accused that he was found guilty of the

offence. However, suspicions after all are suspicions,

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-19-

the same cannot take the place of proof, the value of

absconion, therefore, depends on the facts of each case.

In case titled "Liagat Hussain and others Vs Falak

Sher and others" (2003 SCMR 611 (a), wherein it has

been held:-

"(a) Eye-witnesses including the
complainant had failed to furnish
a plausible and_ acceptable
explanation for being present on
the scene of occurrence and were
chance witnesses-—Prosecution
case did not inspire confidence
and fell for short of sounding
probable to a man of reasonable
prudence---Abscondence of
accused in such circumstances
could not offer any useful
corroboration to the case of

prosecution"

17. Be that as it may, the prosecution failed to

convince this court that it was non-else but accused
who killed the deceased,

18. After thoroughly evaluating the evidence

available on file this court reaches to an inescapable

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-20-

conclusion that the prosecution has miserably failed to

prove its case against accused/appellant. Resultantly,

this appeal is, therefore, allowed, the conviction and

sentence of the appellant recorded by the learned trial

court is set-aside and he is acquitted of the charge by

extending him the benefit of doubt, he shall be released

forth with from jail, if not required to be detained in

connection with any other case. So far as the connected

Criminal Revision No.04-B/2018 is concerned, the

same stands dismissed.

19. Above are the reasons of our short order

of the even date.

Announced.
