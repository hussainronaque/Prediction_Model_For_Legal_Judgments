ORDER

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.- Petitioner

Sajad, seeks bail in case FIR No.330 dated 23.04.2013,
registered under sections 17 (3) Offences Against Property
(Enforcement of Hudood), Ordinance, 1979 and $.342 PPC,
in Police Station Sher Garh.

2. According to report of complainant Asghar
Khan on the fateful day he alongwith Bakhti Rawan,
carrying huge foreign currency in a motorcar to Islamabad
when reached near a mosque of Nazeer Khan Koroona, two
motorcars suddenly intercepted them. The persons sitting in
the said cars caught hold of them at gun point, tied their
eyes, thrashed them and forcibly snatched huge foreign
currency worth Rs.3,70,00,000/- from them and then left
them near a sugarcane fields; that he can identify the culprits
if brought before him.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. Unknown culprits are charged in the FIR by
complainant without disclosing their features and
description. Petitioner alongwith co-accused, has been
named by Afsar Ali, the owner of the alleged snatched
currency and PW Bakhti Rawan, in their statements under
section 164 Cr.P.C. on 24.04.2013, recorded after a delay of
more than a month from the day of incident without
disclosing the source of their satisfaction about complicity
of the petitioner in the commission of offence. No
identification parade of the petitioner has been conducted
either through complainant or PW Bakhti Rawan. Accused
and complainant as well as PW Bakhti Rawan being
unknown to each other prior to the incident, identification
parade was essential, more particularly when the
complainant in his report has specifically stated that he can
recognize the accused. Record is silent as to why
identification test of the accused through the eyewitness has
not been held. Moreso, not a single penny of the alleged
snatched currency has been recovered either from direct or
indirect possession of the petitioner or on his pointation. He
has also not confessed his guilt before the competent Court
of law. On tentative assessment of the material on record
and discussed above, participation of the petitioner in the

commission of offence requires further probe into his guilt.

Besides, co-accused whose case is on equal footing with that
of the petitioner have already been granted bail by the
learned lower court, against whom, no bail cancellation
application has been filed, therefore, on the principle of
consistency the petitioner is also entitled to concession of
bail.

5. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he furnishes
bail bonds to the tune of Rs.3,00,000/- with two local,
reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like amount to
the satisfaction of learned IIlaqa Judicial Magistrate/ MOD
concerned.

6. These are reasons of my short order of even
date.

Announced
25.01.2016.
