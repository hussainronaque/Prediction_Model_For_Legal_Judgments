JUDGMENT

ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- Through this appeal, the
appellants have challenged the judgment dated
15.09.2020 of the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-I, Swabi passed in case FIR No. 416 dated
25.07.2019 u/s 15 A.A of P.S Yar Hussain, District
Swabi, whereby they were convicted and sentenced
to undergo three years RI each with fine of
Rs.10,000/- each. In default of payment of fine, they
were directed to undergo further one month S.I each.
Benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C was extended to
them.

It is pertinent to note here that separate
challan under section 15 A.A had been submitted
against the appellants, as such, they have been
convicted and sentenced through a_ separate
judgment in the same FIR but inadvertently it was

mentioned in the short order that the reasons of

acquittal of the appellants will be later recorded in
the connected Cr.A No. 712-P/2020. The mistake
being inadvertent, is rectified and this appeal is
decided through a separate judgment independent of
the murder case.

2. Brief facts of the case are that during
investigation of the case against the present
appellants with regard to murder of deceased Ibne
Ameen, they disclosed that they had fired at the
deceased through their respective Kalashnikovs and
the said weapons have been concealed by them in
their house after the occurrence. Thus they led the
police to their house and a Kalashnikov having no
number with five rounds of 7.62 bore was recovered
on pointation of appellant Riaz Ali from an iron box
inside his residential room. Thereafter another
Kalashnikov bearing No.5617327729 with ten
rounds was recovered on pointation of appellant
Rehman Ali which he had concealed in an iron box
in his room. Both the weapons were taken into
possession vide recovery memo Ex.PW-1/1 attested
by Afsar Khan ASI (abandoned) and Mushtaq
Hussain ASI (PW-1).

3. After completion of investigation,

separate challan u/s 15 A.A was put in Court for trial

of the appellants on commencement whereof they
were formally charge-sheeted for the offence to
which they did not plead guilty and opted to face the
trial. Prosecution, in order to further substantiate its
case against the appellants, examined 03 PWs and
closed the evidence. After examination of the
appellants u/s 342, Cr.P.C, the learned trial Court
convicted the appellants in this case by awarding
them the sentences already detailed in the earlier

part of this judgment. Hence, this appeal.

4. Arguments heard and record of the case
was perused.
5. Perusal of the record shows that as per

prosecution version, the rifles recovered in the
present case were shown as the crime weapons in the
murder case, however, the said allegation against the
present appellants is disproved by FSL, copy of
which is available on record. According to the said
report, the Kalashnikovs allegedly recovered in this
case have not matched with the 05 crime empties
recovered from the spot, however, the learned trial
Court has convicted the appellants for keeping

unlicensed arms in their house.

6. Admittedly, the alleged recovery has

been made on joint pointation of the appellants and a

{Cr.A No. 713-P/2020 Riaz and another Vs. The State and another)

joint recovery memo was prepared regarding both
the weapons. Recovery of incriminating articles on
joint pointation of two or more accused is
inadmissible in evidence under Article 40 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. In this regard we
would refer the judgment in the case titled Ghulam
Mustafa Vs. Ali Nawaz and 2 others 2020 M L D
1260 [Sindh (Hyderabad Bench)], wherein it was

held that:

Moreover, it is alleged that the recovery was
made on the joint pointation of both the
accused and there is plethora of case laws
that recovery which is made on the
pointation of more than one accused on their
joint pointation is inadmissible in evidence
and cannot be relied upon. In this respect,
we are supported by the dictum laid down
by the honourable Supreme Court in the
case of Gul Jamal and another vy. The State
(1980 SCMR 654).

Zz In addition to above, the PWs have not
supported each other on material particulars of the
recovery. According to Ashfaq Hussain ASI (PW-1),
who is the attesting witness of recovery memo
Ex.PW-1/1, admitted in his cross-examination that
female, children as well as other male members of
the accused family were present at the time of
recovery of weapons, however, the Investigating

Officer Aurangzeb Khan S.I (PW-2) has denied

presence of males except the accused inside the
house. Furthermore, no sketch of recovery is
available on record of this case to support the above
version of prosecution. The afore-referred aspects of
the case suggest that the recovery of weapons has
not been effected in the mode and manner as alleged
by prosecution.

& The record further transpires that the
1.0 has not complied with the provision of section
103, Cr.P.C. Although non-compliance of the said
provision by police alone would not damage the
entire case of prosecution, however, the I.O in the
present case has failed to offer any plausible
explanation to justify non-association of private
witnesses with the recovery of unlicensed weapons
from the house of appellant. Moreso, the prosecution
has also failed to prove the charge of murder against
the present appellants and they have been acquitted
by this Court through a separate judgment in the

connected Cr.A No. 712-M/2020.

9 In view of the above, prosecution has
not proved its case against the appellants beyond
reasonable doubt, therefore, the impugned judgment
needs reversal in circumstances of the case.

Resultantly, this appeal is allowed, the impugned

judgment is set aside and appellants are acquitted of
the charge leveled against them in the present case.
They be released forthwith from jail if not required

in any other case.
