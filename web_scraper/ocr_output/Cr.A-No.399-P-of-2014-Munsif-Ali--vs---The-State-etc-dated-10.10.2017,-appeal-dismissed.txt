2. The convict/appellant was charged by
Mst. Noor Jehan, complainant, vide FIR
No.321 dated 28.03.2013 under sections
302/449 PPC and 13 A.O; registered in Police
Station, Kalu Khan, Swabi, where she had
brought dead body of her deceased daughter,
Mst. Salma, and also the appellant/accused
with the help of her co-villagers at 20:30 hours
on 28.03.2013 and lodged report to the effect
that she along with her deceased daughter,

Mst. Salma, another daughter namely Mst.
Romina and sister, Mst. Sajida, was present in
her house situated in village Ismaila, while her
deceased daughter, Mst. Salma, was busy in
sewing clothes with sewing machine inside
the room, that the accused/appellant entered
the house duly armed with a pistol at 19:30
hours and straightaway went to the room of
her daughter Salma and fired at her, with
which she was hit and died on the spot.
According to the complainant, she, with the
help of her daughter Romina and _ sister
Sajida, overpowered the accused/appellant,
and in the meantime her brothers-in-law
namely Taj Muhammad and Rab Nawaz
reached there and after subjecting the
accused/appellant to beating, brought him
along with 30 bore pistol to the Police Station
for handing over him to the police for further
legal proceedings. The motive for the
occurrence was mentioned as efforts on the
part of the accused/appellant to get married to
her deceased daughter, Mst. Salma, and her

refusal to marry her daughter to him. The
repor/FIR was also endorsed by Mst.
Romina, and after preparation of the inquest
report, the deceased was referred to Kalu
Khan Hospital for autopsy. The 30 bore pistol
loaded with two rounds was taken _ into
possession and the case was forwarded to the
investigation staff for investigation.

3. The Postmortem examination of the
deceased revealed six firearms entry wounds
with equal number of corresponding exit
wounds. During spot inspection, the 1.0
secured blood from the place assigned in the
site plan to the deceased and also an empty
shell of 30 bore near the place assigned to the
accused/appellant in the site plan. The 1.0
also recovered 100 Walt bulb from the scene
of occurrence, which was shown lit at the time
of occurrence. The blood stained cotton,
secured from the spot, and blood stained
garments of the deceased were sent to the
FSL for chemical analysis, and the result
received therefrom was in the affirmative.

Likewise, the 30 bore crime empty and 30
bore pistol were sent to the firearms expert
and opinion of the firearms expert was that the
crime empty was fired from the 30 bore pistol.
The appellant/accused, arrested on the spot,
was handed over by the complainant and her
relatives to the police in injured condition and
the Medicinal Officer found lacerated and
simple wounds on the body of the
appellant/accused. After completion of
investigation, complete challan was submitted
against the accused/appellant, leading to
commencement of trial in the learned trial
Court.

4. The learned trial Court framed formal
charge against the appellant/accused under
sections 449/302 PPC, to which the
accused/appellant pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. In order to prove its case against
the accused/appellant, the prosecution
produced as many as nine PWs, as follows:

e Doctor Mudasir Iqbal, Medical Officer
Civil Hospital Kalu) Khan (PW-1),
medically examined accused, Munsif
and prepared MLC (EX.PW1/1);
e Said Jamil Khan SHO, Police Station,
Kalu Khan (PW-2), submitted complete
challan after completion of investigation;

e Ajmal Ali Shah (PW-3), identified dead
body before the police as well as the
doctor;

e Rab Nawaz (PW-4), is marginal witness
to the recovery memos (EX.PW4/1 to
EX.PW4/5);

e Mst. Noor Jehan (PW-5), the
complainant;

e Mst. Romina (PW-6), the eyewitness;

e Doctor Shahida (PW-7), conducted
autopsy on the dead body of deceased
Mst. Salma and furnished Postmortem
report (EX.PM);

e Salim Khan §S.l/Investigating Officer
(PW-8); and

e Bashir Khan S.I (PW-9), registered FIR
(EX.PA) on the spot of the complainant;

5. After prosecution closed its evidence,
statement of the accused/appellant was
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C. Although,
the accused/appellant denied allegations
levelled against him by the prosecution, but
declined to be examined on oath and produce

defence evidence. Having heard the learned
DPP and _ learned counsel for the
accused/appellant, the learned trial
Court/Sessions Judge, Swabi, rendered the
impugned judgment dated 07.06.2014,
thereby, convicting the accused/appellant and
sentencing him to the punishment of
imprisonment and _ fine as _ mentioned
hereinabove; hence appeal by _ the
appellant/accused for setting aside the
impugned judgment as well as his conviction
and sentences awarded to him by the learned
trial Court/Sessions Judge, Swabi.

6. Arguments of learned counsel for the
appellant/accused and learned AAG assisted
by learned counsel for the complainant heard;
and record perused.

7. The report/FIR was lodged by mother
of the deceased in the Police Station within
one hour of the occurrence, where the
complainant, Mst. Noor Jehan, had not only
brought the dead body of her daughter, Mst.
Salma, but also the appellant/accused with

the help of her co-villagers, and had charged
the appellant as the only accused for the qafi-
i-amd of her daughter; and, at the same time,
had handed over 30 bore pistol snatched from
the appellant/accused after commission of
offence by him. The occurrence, admittedly,
took place inside the house of the
complainant, which fact was also confirmed by
the report of FSL regarding the blood secured
from the scene of occurrence by the 1.0
during spot inspection and blood stained
garments of the deceased. Likewise, the
same size and dimension of the firearms entry
wounds i.e. 1/4 X 1/4 inch indicated use of
one weapon of offence; while the firearms
expert further substantiated this fact by
furnishing positive report in respect of the
pistol snatched from the appellant/accused
after commission of the offence and handed
over to the police at the time of lodging the
report, and the sole empty shell of 30 bore
recovered by the 1.0 from the scene of
occurrence during spot inspection. The

lacerated wounds and_ raccon- eyes
(hemoatoma both eyes) found by the Medical
Officer (PW-1) after examination of the
appellant/accused at 10:30 P.M _=— on
28.03.2013 further confirmed not only
presence of the appellant/accused on the spot
at the time of occurrence, but also the
prosecution story to the effect that he was
subjected to beating by relatives of the
complainant and the deceased after
commission of the offence.

8. The ocular account furnished by the
complainant, Mst. Noor Jehan (PW-5), and
her daughter and the eyewitness, Mst.
Romina (PW-6), substantiated allegations of
the prosecution against the appellant/accused
not only in material details but also in minor
details like the time of occurrence, their
presence in the Veranda in front of the two
residential rooms and presence of the deceased
in the single room situated opposite the two
residential rooms and the Veranda and near the

Kitchen and the Bathroom. The said two eye

witnesses furnished graphic details of the facts that
the appellant/accused entered their house
duly armed with pistol and went to the room
where the deceased was busy in sewing
clothes with sewing machine and opened fire
at her, causing her death. Needless to say
that being members of the same family, the
complainant being mother and the eyewitness
being sister of the deceased, their presence
on the spot at the time of occurrence was
natural and the appellant/accused, being their
relative, cousin of husband of _ the
complainant, was also familiar to them and to
the scene of occurrence. Therefore, his
entering the house and straightaway going to
the room where the deceased was busy in
sewing clothes with a sewing machine was
not something unusual to create doubt about
the conduct of the appellant/accused at the
relevant time. The defence desperately
attempted to prove presence of father and
brother of the deceased on the scene of
occurrence at the relevant time, but ended in

proving this fact during cross examination of
these two PWs that father and brother of the
deceased used to leave for Yar Hussain in the
morning in connection with their business of
selling fruit and return in the evening, and
further that neither the father nor brother of
the deceased were present on the spot at the
time of occurrence, as the former was away
from home and the latter was busy in offering
prayers in the Mosque. The complainant and
the eyewitness were subjected to thorough
and searching cross examination, but no
material contradiction came to surface to cast
doubt on the prosecution version.

9. The motive for the commission of the
offence is also established on the record not
only from the testimony of the PWs but also
from the defence of the appellant/accused: as,
undoubtedly, the appellant/accused was
eager to get married to the deceased and
refusal of family of the deceased had caused
him disappointment. The intimate relationship
of the appellant/accused and the deceased

was line of defence of the appellant/accused,
and it was also suggested by the defence
during cross examination of the complainant
(PW-5) that her husband i.e. father of the
deceased had quarreled with the
appellant/accused after the appellant/accused
and the deceased were found together in a
Khwar two years prior to the occurrence and
further that the deceased had affairs with the
appellant/accused and then she developed
relations with another person. The
appellant/accused himself admitted his
strained relations with family of the deceased
in his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C and
also his quarrel with father of the deceased
after he and the deceased were found talking
to each other.

10. The appellant/accused has _ been
inconsistent with his plea of defence, as at
one occasion, during cross examination of the
complainant, his defence was that murder of
the deceased was committed by brother of the
deceased because of her relationship, firstly,

with him and then with another person; and at
another occasion, his defence was that he
was implicated in the case through
conspiracy, because when he was with a
Tableegi Jumat in the Mosque, situated in
village Yaqoobi, he was summoned on
telephone with a promise to give him the hand
of the deceased; but let alone murder of the
deceased by her brother, the
appellant/accused failed even to prove the
fact of his summoning by the family of the
deceased from the Mosque in Village Yaqoobi
where he was with a Tableegi Jumat, through
production of cell phone and phone data; and
through production of even a single member
of the said Tableegi Jumat to prove his
presence with the Tableegi Jumat in the
Mosque in Village Yaqoobi at the relevant
time. He neither produced defence evidence
nor even recorded his statement on oath to
prove his plea of defence.

11. Since there is no revision petition for
enhancement of the punishment awarded to

the appellant/accused by the learned trial
Court/Sessions Judge, Swabi; and even
otherwise, case of the prosecution against the
appellant/accused for committing the qatl-i-
amd of deceased, Mst. Salma, by firing at her
inside her house and house of the
complainant and the eyewitness stands
proved beyond any shadow of doubt through
the ocular and circumstantial evidence, as
explained hereinabove. Therefore, there is
nothing on the record to persuade us to arrive
at a different conclusion than the one arrived
at by the learned trial Court/Sessions Judge,
Swabi, about guilt of the appellant/accused.
Consequently, finding no merit in the appeal,
the same is dismissed.
