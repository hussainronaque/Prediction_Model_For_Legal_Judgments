SHAHID KHAN, J.- Through the subject
appeal, Jan Muhammad & Ali Muhammad,
hereinafter, the appellants/accused, have called
in question legality & validity of the judgment,
dated, 15.9.2022, of learned Additional Sessions
Judge-VI, D.I.Khan, whereby, on conclusion of
trial, in case FIR No.557, dated, 03.6.2018,
under Sections 302/34 PPC, of police station
Cantt, D.I. Khan, recorded their conviction under

Sections 302(b) PPC and sentenced them for life
-2-

imprisonment with compensation of
Rs.2,00,000/- under Section 544-A Cr.PC, or in
default thereof to further undergo six months
simple imprisonment. However, benefit of

Section 382-B Cr.PC was extended accordingly.

2. The complainant has also filed
Cr.Rev.No.02-D/2023 for enhancement of
sentence of the appellants/accused, both these
matters, being the outcome of one and same
trial, therefore, are to be disposed of by way of

this single judgment.

3. The prosecution’s case, as set forth
in the crime report, is that on 03.6.2018 at 0730
hours, complainant Abdur Rashid brought the
dead body of his father Atta Gul and reported the
matter at Emergency Room of Civil Hospital,
D.Khan to the effect that on the eventful date,
day & time (03.6.2018 at 0630 hours), his father
riding on motorcycle bearing registration No.FF-
2474/DIK, while the complainant and his brother
Khalid, riding on a bicycle, were proceeding to
their cloth’s shop, situated in Pir Zain-ud-Din
Market, Tank Adda, D.I.Khan. When they

reached thoroughfare Wandah Mochianwala, the
-3-

appellants/accused Jan Muhammad and Ali
Muhammad, duly equipped with pistols, arrived/
emerged there and started firing at his father
with intention to commit his Qatl-i-Amd. As a
result of it, he got hit and injured. His father has
also made firing with his pistol in self defence,
as a result of it, the appellant/accused Jan
Muhammad got injured. When the complainant
and his brother take care of their father, he
succumbed to his injuries. After the occurrence,
the appellants/accused fled away. Motive for the
occurrence is alleged as previous blood feud.
The report of the complainant was reduced into
writing in the shape of murasila which

culminated into registration of ibid FIR.

4. On completion of the investigation,
challan was drawn within the meaning of
Section 173 Cr.PC and after doing the needful, it
was sent up to the Court of competent

jurisdiction for trial accordingly.

5. On commencement of trial, copies
of the evidence (oral and documentary) were
delivered to the appellants/accused within the

meaning of Section 265-C Cr.PC, followed by,
G

-4-

confronted them with the set of allegations
through a formal charge. They denied the subject

allegations, pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

6. The prosecution, to bring home
charge against the appellants/accused, produced
twelve (12) witnesses to substantiate its version.
At the closure of the prosecution’s account, the
appellants/accused were confronted with the
evidence so furnished through formal
questionnaires within the meaning of Section
342 Cr.PC, to which they professed innocence
and claimed to have been falsely implicated in
the subject case. However, they neither wished
to be examined on Oath as required under
Section 340(2) Cr.PC nor intended to produce
evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial,
scanning of record with due assistance of learned
counsel for the parties and learned prosecutor,
the learned trial Court/Additional Sessions
Judge-VI, D.I.Khan, arrived at the conclusion
that the prosecution has successfully proved its
case against the appellants/accused without any

shadow of doubt, hence, vide impugned
x

-5-

judgment, dated, 15.9.2022, recorded their

conviction, as referred to above.

7. We have heard the arguments of the
learned counsel for the parties as well as learned
Asstt: A.G. representing the State and have gone

through the record of the case.

8. The record reflects that on the same
day ie. 03.6.2018 at 0705 hours, the
appellant/accused Jan Muhammad also lodged a
report vide FIR No.556, dated, 03.6.2018, under
Section 324 PPC, at police station Cantt,
D.LKhan, to the effect that on the eventful day,
he on his motorcycle bearing registration
No.BKL-8719 came to meet his brother Ali
Muhammad. At about 0630 hours, he was
proceeding on his motorcycle and when reached
thoroughfare Wandah Mochianwala, the
deceased Atta Gul arrived near him on his
motorcycle and started firing at him with his
pistol with intention to commit his Qatl-i-Amd,
as a result of it, he got injured. He also retaliated
the firing due to which Atta Gul got hit and died
on the spot. Motive for the occurrence is alleged

as previous blood feud.
eo

-6-
9. Both the FIRs No.556 & 557
confirm the occurrence and presence of the
appellant/accused Jan Muhammad and_ the

deceased Atta Gul on the spot.

10. According to PW-10 Dr. Bilal
Sher, Medical Officer, on 03.6.2018 at about
08:00 a.m. he conducted postmortem of the
deceased Atta Gul and issued postmortem
report as Ex.PM. The postmortem report of the
deceased reflects that the deceased had
received six firearm shots entry wounds at
chest & abdomen and six exit wounds on the
back. The postmortem report of deceased
established the fact that his death was
unnatural as the deceased received fire arm
injuries on his person. Even otherwise, the
defence has also not disputed the unnatural

death of deceased.

11. The ocular evidence has been
furnished by the complainant Abdur Rashid
(PW-3) and his brother Khalid Umar (PW-4).
They reiterated the contents of FIR in their

respective statements. In their statements they

specifically stated that the accused Jan
-7-

Muhammad and Ali Muhammad duly equipped
with pistols made firing at their father with
their pistols, as a result of it, he got hit and
died on the spot. They also stated that their
father also made firing at the accused in self
defence due to which accused Jan Muhammad
got injured. These witnesses fully corroborated
the contents of FIR. These witnesses have also
correctly narrated the date, time, the place of
occurrence and the manner of occurrence,
while despite lengthy cross-examination they

remained firm in their deposition.

12. The case of prosecution has further
been strengthened by the recovery of crime
weapon i.e. pistol from the appellant/accused
Jan Muhammad. At the time of lodging the
report vide FIR No.556, the appellant/accused
Jan Muhammad produced 30 bore pistol
No.31017777, allegedly belonging to him and
one 30 bore pistol without number belonging
to the deceased Atta Gul. However, during
investigation, it was found that license No.112-
D/1998 was issued to the deceased Atta Gul

against 30 bore pistol No.31017777 while 30
-8-

bore pistol without number was of the

appellant/accused Jan Muhammad.

13. The I.0, vide recovery memo
Ex.PW-5/1, recovered 07 empties of 30 bore
from point ‘A’ & ‘B’ and 03 empties of 30
bore from point ‘D’ in the site plan. The
empties and the 30 bore pistols were sent to the
FSL. According to report Ex.PK/1 one 30 bore
empty marked C1 was fired from 30 bore pistol
No.31017777| while nine 30 bore crime
empties marked C2 to C10 were fired from 30
bore pistol No.Nil. It shows that the
appellant/accused Jan Muhammad made
indiscriminate firing at the deceased Atta Gul
while the deceased Atta Gul in retaliation made
a single fire shot at the appellant/accused Jan

Muhammad who also got injured.

14. The appraisal of direct and
circumstantial coupled with medical evidence
after minute consideration of all the
circumstances, as well as the recoveries of
crime empties, matching of the same with the
crime weapon, we are of the considered view

that the appellant/accused Jan Muhammad is
-9-

responsible for the murder of the deceased Atta
Gul and has rightly been convicted and
sentenced by the learned trial Court for life
imprisonment, but we are unable to find
ourselves in agreement with the impugned
judgment of the trial Court to the extent of
appellant/accused Ali Muhammad. The
recovery of crime empties, the weapon of
offence and report of Fire Arms Expert
Ex.PK/1 are suggestive of the fact that the act
was done by one accused, admittedly by
appellant/accused Jan Muhammad, whereas,
the appellant/accused Ali Muhammad has not
at all taken participation in the alleged crime.
The prosecution has failed to establish the
mens rea of the appellant/accused Ali
Muhammad to commit such crime. The
prosecution has failed to establish through
incriminatory evidence with regard to common
intention or common object of the
appellant/accused Ali Muhammad to commit
the murder of deceased Atta Gul. Reliance is
placed on the case of “Muhammad Ameer v.
Muhammad Imran” (2017 MLD 1263

(Lahore), wherein it has been held that:
-10-

"4. After hearing the learned
counsel for the appellant and going
through the impugned judgment, it
is observed that the acquitted
respondent was admittedly, empty
handed at the time of the occurrence
that wok place at 10.30 a.m. on
14.12.2009 near the shop of Tariq
Mistri. According to the allegation,
both the acquitted respondent and
the death-convict Waheed Khan
walked to the place of occurrence,
hence, it could hardly be believed
that they facilitated or helped each
other to reach the spot. Being empty
handed, respondent Imran could
lend no help to his co-accused,
rather he might have put himself in
danger of being harmed by the other
side, had there been any retaliation
or counter-attack by them."

15. The reappraisal of entire
prosecution evidence would establish the fact
that the prosecution has — successfully
established the charge to the extent of main
appellant/accused Jan Muhammad through
cogent, consistent & confidence inspiring
evidence but it has miserably been failed to
establish the common intention and common
object of the appellant/accused Ali Muhammad
for commission of crime rather the prosecution
has only established his presence along with
the main accused at the relevant time, which in
our view is not sufficient to hold him

responsible for the charge.

For the above reasons, the appeal

same is upheld to the extent of appellant/accused
Jan Muhammad. The appellant/accused Ali
Muhammad be set free forthwith, if not required
in any other case. In the meanwhile, connected

Cr.Rev.No.02-D/2023 stands dismissed.
