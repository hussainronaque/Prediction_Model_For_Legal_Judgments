RRR EEE

QAISER RASHID KHAN, CJ.- Keeping in view the

fact that the prayers of the convicts Shafiq-ur-Rehman and
Abdul Latif alias Latif (hereinafter called as “the convicts-
petitioners) seeking the conversion of their sentence of
payment of compensation amount into simple imprisonment of
six months and also for the consolidation of their multiple
sentences in different trials cannot be looked into by this court
in its appellate jurisdiction having become functus officio after
dismissing their appeals against convictions, we, in the
peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and in the interest
of justice, while exercising inherent powers under section 561-

A CrPC convert this appeal into Cr.M (Quashment petition)
-2-

and in turn direct the office to make necessary entries in the

relevant registers as well as in the heading of the petition.

2. In essence, the grievance of the convicts-
petitioners is that despite completing their sentences, still they
have not been released merely due to non-payment of
compensation amount and by treating their sentences

consecutively as against concurrently.

3. Brief but relevant facts of the case are that
convicts-petitioners being charged in a criminal case FIR
No.267 dated 01.04.2010 under section 302 / 324 / 34 PPC of
Police Station Saddar, district Mardan faced trial and after its
conclusion, they were convicted under section 302(b) PPC for
the murder of Sultan, Ali Askar and Mukhtiar and accordingly
sentenced to imprisonment for life (on three counts) with the
direction to pay Rs.3,00,000/- to the legal heirs of each of the
deceased as compensation. Likewise, they were also convicted
under section 324 PPC for attempting at the lives of
complainant Mursaleen, Irfaq, Attaullah son of Kareem Khan
and Attaullah son of Fazal Rabi and in turn sentenced to
imprisonment for ten years with a fine of Rs.50,000/- each or
in default thereof to further undergo simple imprisonment for
six months. However, benefit of section 382-B, CrPC was
extended to the convicts-petitioners and their sentences were

ordered to run concurrently vide judgment dated 07.03.2012.
-3-

After the arrest of the convict-petitioner Shafiq-ur-
Rehman, the weapon of offence was recovered from his
immediate possession and besides the ibid FIR, he was also
booked in a separate FIR No.270 dated 01.04.2010 under
section 13 of the Arms Ordinance of Police Station Saddar,
district Mardan. After full-dressed trial, he was also convicted
under section 13 AO and accordingly sentenced to three years
R.I., with a fine of Rs.5,000/- or in default thereof to further
undergo one month S.I. Benefit of section 382-B CrPC was

however extended to him vide judgment dated 07.03.2012.

Whereas both the convicts-petitioners moved Criminal
Appeal No.168-P/2012 against their conviction under sections
302 / 324 PPC, the convict-petitioner Shafiq-ur-Rehman also
moved a separate Criminal Appeal No.176-P/2012 against his
conviction under section 13 of the Arms Ordinance before this
court, which were dismissed by this court vide separate
judgments dated 16.07.2015 with certain modifications in the
judgment of the learned trial court, impugned in Criminal

Appeal No.168-P/2012. Hence, the instant petition.

4. So far as the first prayer regarding conversion of
sentence of payment of compensation amount into simple
imprisonment is concerned, the learned counsel for the
convicts-petitioners has not seriously raised this issue during

the course of arguments, hence, left unattended.
-4-

5. Now coming to the second prayer qua treating
their sentences to be concurrent in different trials, suffice it to
say that from the above narrated facts of the case, only
convict-petitioner Shafiq-ur-Rehman is pressing hard such
plea because he had faced two trials in different FIRs, which
were the outcome of one and the same transaction and
accordingly had been convicted and sentenced thereunder
separately, which is not the case of the convict-petitioner
Abdul Latif alias Latif as he had only faced trial in one FIR
and was accordingly convicted thereunder. Hence, we confine
our findings only to the extent of the convict-petitioner Shafiq-

ur-Rehman.

6. The gist of the arguments of the learned counsel
for the convict-petitioner is that the relief under section 397
CrPC, which somehow was not earlier granted to the convict-
petitioner during the trial or appellate stage can be extended
by this court even at this stage while exercising powers under

section 561-A CrPC.

Such submissions are not seriously objected to by the

learned Additional Advocate General representing the State.

7. The moot question before us is that as to whether
sentences in two different trials, which were of course

outcome of one and the same transaction, can be consolidated
-5-

or for that matter run concurrently. Section 397 CrPC deals

with this proposition, which reads as under:-

397. Sentence on offender already sentenced
for another offence. When a person already
undergoing a sentence of imprisonment or
imprisonment for life is sentenced to
imprisonment, or imprisonment for life, such
imprisonment, or imprisonment for life shall
commence at the expiration of the
imprisonment, or imprisonment for life to which
he has been previously sentenced, unless the
Court directs that the subsequent sentence shall

run concurrently with such previous sentence.

8. Granted that as per the first portion of the ibid
section of law, the subsequent sentence to a convict already
undergoing a sentence has to commence after the expiry of the
previous sentence but simultaneously its later part leaves it to
the discretion of the court whereby it may direct for treating

the sentences to run concurrently.

9. Another crucial question is as to whether an
issue, which was not addressed to by both the learned trial
court and the learned appellate court can be tackled / resolved
at this stage?. The answer is “Yes”. Section 397 CrPC attends
to such a situation. In this respect, wisdom is safely sought
from the judgments of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan

reported as Rahib Ali vs. the State (2018 SCMR 418);

Sajjad Ikram & others vs. Sikandar Hayat & others (2016
-6-

SCMR_467) & Mst. Shahista Bibi & another vs.
Superintendent, Central Jail, Mach & others (PLD 2015
SC 15). For ready reference, the relevant portions thereof are
as under:-

Rahib Ali vs. the State (2018 SCMR 418)

Whereas section 397, Cr.P.C.; enables and
empowers the trial, and or Appellate/Revisional
court, as the case may be, in a subsequent trial
or in appeal or revision arising out of
subsequent trial to order for the consolidation
of sentence in subsequent trial with the
sentence(s) handed down in earlier trial(s) as
may be maintained or modified in
appeal/revision arising there from. In case
earlier, conviction was not brought to the notice
of the at the time of handing down the
subsequent conviction sentence the Trial or
Appellate/Revisional Court could exercise such
jurisdiction even after the sentence of
imprisonment in subsequent trial is announced
in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction under
section 561-A, Cr.P.C. read with section 397,
Cr.P.C., provided of course, where the trial, or
superior courts of appeal have specifically and
consciously ordered the sentences either in
same trial or in subsequent trial to run

consecutively.

17. In the light of discussion made above, there
remains no doubt that the High Court and so
also this Court have jurisdiction under section
561-A read with section 35 and or section 397,
Cr.P.C. as the case may to order such multiple

sentences in same transaction/trial or in a
-7-

separate and subsequent trial to run

concurrently.

Sajjad Ikram & others vs. Sikandar Hayat &
others (2016 SCMR 467)

12. The aggregate of punishment of
imprisonment for several offences at one trial
were deemed to be a single sentence. However,
the position of an accused person is different
who while already undergoing a sentence of
imprisonment for life, is subsequently convicted
and sentenced in another trial. Such subsequent
sentence in view of section 397, Cr.P.C. would
commence at the expiration of imprisonment for
life for which he had been previously sentenced
but even then in such cases, the said provision
expressly enables the Court to direct that the
subsequent sentence would run concurrently
with the previous sentence. It is clear from
section 397, Cr.P.C. that the Court, while
analyzing the facts and circumstances of every
case, is competent to direct that sentences in
two different trials would run concurrently. In
that eventuality, the Court has wide power to
direct that sentences in one trial would run
concurrently. The provision of section 397,
CrP.C. confers wide discretion on the Court to
extend such benefit to the accused in a case of
peculiar nature, like the present one. Thus
extending the beneficial provision in favour of
the appellant, would clearly meet the end of
justice. We, therefore, observe that there is
nothing wrong in treating the sentences of
imprisonment for life of the convict/appellants
on three counts to run concurrently, in view of

facts and circumstances discussed above.

8. Besides the provisions of section 35, Cr.P.C.
the provisions of section 397, Cr.P.C.
altogether provide entirely a_ different
proposition widening the scope of discretion of
the Court to direct that sentences of
imprisonment or that of life imprisonment
awarded at the same trial or at two different
trials but successively, shall run concurrently.
Once the Legislation has conferred the above
discretion in the Court then in hardship cases,
Courts are required to seriously take into
consideration the same to the benefit of the
accused so that to minimize and liquidate the
hardship treatment, the accused person is to get
and to liquidate the same as far as possible. In
a situation like the present one, the Court of law
cannot fold up its hands to deny the benefit of
the said beneficial provision to an accused
person because denial in such a case would
amount to a ruthless treatment to him/her and
he/she would certainly die while undergoing
such long imprisonment in prison. Thus, the
benefit conferred upon the appellant/appellants
through amnesty given by the Government, if
the benefit of directing the sentences to run
concurrently is denied to him/them, would
brought at naught and ultimately the object of
the same would be squarely defeated and that
too, under the circumstances when the
provision of §S.397, Cr.P.C. confers wide
discretion on the Court and unfettered one to
extend such benefit to the accused in a case of

peculiar nature like the present one. Thus,
-9-

construing the beneficial provision in favour of
the accused would clearly meet the ends of
Justice and interpreting the same to the contrary

would certainly defeat the same.

10. On the touchstone of the supra judgments of the
apex court and keeping in view the relevant provision of law,
we have come to the safe conclusion that the convict-
petitioner Shafiq-ur-Rehman is entitled to the relief, asked for

within the meaning of section 397 CrPC.

11. Accordingly, we admit and partially allow this
petition and in turn hold that the sentences of the convict-
petitioner Shafiq-ur-Rehman shall be deemed to have run
‘concurrently’ in both the trials. Cr.M is disposed of
accordingly. A copy of this judgment be endorsed to the
Superintendent, Central Prison, Mardan for information and
compliance.
