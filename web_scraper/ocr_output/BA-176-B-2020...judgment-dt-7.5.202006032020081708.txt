SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- The petitioners after having
been booked in case F.I.R No 186 dated 22.03.2020, under sections
302/324/353/148/149 P.P.C, 15 A.A, were arrested and after their
arrest they applied for their release on bail before the Court of
Additional Sessions Judge-II/Judge Special Task, Karak, which was
regretted vide order dated 09.04.2020. Feeling aggrieved the
petitioners approached this Court through the instant bail petition.

2. Brief facts giving rise to the instant bail petition are that
the complainant Kariman Ali ASHO on 22.03.2020 at 14.25 hours
reported the matter that today at 11.15 hours, the police party
including him had escorted a convoy to provide security to one Gul
Rauf advocate to ensure his safe passage to the graveyard of his

relatives situated at Spina Banda to offer Fateha, in compliance of the

directions issued by the august Peshawar High Court, Bannu Bench, in
WP No. 3938/2016. Gul Rauf advocate was also accompanied by his
nephew Imam Bashar son of Muhammad Rahman and on their way
back from the graveyard the accused Zakirullah, Rizwanullah sons of
Sher Nawaz, Sher Nawaz son of Gul Chaman, Muhammad Riaz and
Noor Tiaz sons of Muhammad Rasool, Muhammad Rasool son of Gul
Sanat Shah and Sabir Nawaz son of Adil Nawaz, all residents of Spina
Banda, duly armed appeared and started indiscriminate firing on the
police convoy which resulted into the death of Gul Rauf advocate and
injuries to Hamayun a police constable. The incident was
communicated to the control room and the accused were chased,
where the parties exchanged heavy firing, as a result of which one
accused Noor Tiaz was killed, whereas accused Muhammad Riaz son
of Muhammad Rasool, and Muhammad Rasool son of Gul Sanat Shah
were arrested. From possession of accused Muhammad Riaz a
Kalashnikov without number with fixed charger, double magazines
containing 7 rounds and from possession of accused Muhammad
Rasool son of Gul Sanat Shah a 30 bore pistol without number with
fixed charger were recovered, while rest of the accused decamped
from the spot. This was on 24.02.2020, when the Investigating Officer
recorded the statement of Imam Bashar under section 161 Cr.P.C.
where after he was produced before the Court of Judicial Magistrate
and his statement under section 164 Cr.P.C. was recorded, where he
specifically charged one Sabir Nawaz for causing the death of Gul
Rauf advocate and Noor Tiaz son of Muhammad Rasool for injuries to

constable Muhammad Hamayun.

3. Learned counsel for the parties alongwith Asstt:
Advocate General were heard at length and with their valuable
assistance the record was gone through.

4, It was submitted in favour of the petitioners that the
charge was the outcome of mala fide and ulterior motives; and that no
specific role has been attributed to any one of the petitioners and that
in fact it was the police party who committed the murders; and that the
case is one of further inquiry.

5. Conversely, the learned counsel for the complainant
alongwith Asstt: Advocate General submitted that it was a day light
occurrence; and that the petitioners were arrested on the spot and
recoveries were effected from their possession; and that the offence is
heinous and falls under the restrictive clause of section 497 Cr.P.C.

6. The incident occurred at village Spina Banda, which is
the place of the petitioners and the co-accused; and that there was a
blood feud between the parties, so the involvement of many more
accused of one and the same family is a question which needs
determination. The complainant of the case is Kareman Ali ASHO,
who was allegedly heading the convoy and this has been stated in the
report that one Imam Bashar nephew of the deceased Gul Rauf was
also accompanying them, but the said Imam Bashar did not opt to
report on the day for the reasons best known to the prosecution rather
it was on 24.02.2020, when his statement under section 161 Cr.P.C.
was recorded and thereafter he was produced before the court of
Judicial Magistrate for recording his statement under section 164
Cr.P.C. The prosecution is yet to explain that why the statement of

Imam Basher was not recorded on the day when he was allegedly

shown present at the time of police encounter and such delayed

statement loses its worth and it favours the persons charged, as is held

in case titled “Attaullah Vs the State (PLD 2019 Balochistan 75).

“According to settled norms of justice in a
criminal case when section 161 Cr.P.C.
statement is delayed; such evidence may
not be given that sanctity as is generally
given to the evidence of a witness whose
statement has been recorded promptly

soon after the occurrence.”

7. Though while reporting the matter the complainant did
not specifically charged the accused who killed the deceased and
injured the constable rather it was after two days of the occurrence
when the statement of Imam Bashar was recorded, where specific
roles were attributed to Sabir Nawaz and Noor Tiaz, this deviation by
the eye-witness from the report makes the case of the petitioners
arguable for the purpose of bail, even otherwise the petitioners were
shown arrested from the spot and are saddled with vicarious liability,
which cannot be determined at this stage, rather their involvement in
the episode can best be determined by the trial Court after recording
pro and contra evidence. In case titled “Ameer Bakhsh Vs the State

and another” (2019 P Cr.LJ Note 145), wherein it is held that:

“It is settled law that vicarious liability of the
accused is to be determined by the learned trial
court after recording evidence. Reliance is
placed on the case of Basharat Hussain v.
Ghulam Hussain and others (1978 SCMR 357)
wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan
refused to interfere with the order of this Court
granting bail to accused person in a case who
had held the deceased to facilitate the murder
by the co-accused.”

t

8. Though it was argued with vehemence that the spot
arrest of the petitioners and recovery of arms from their possession
leaves no room to hold them vicariously liable and that even at. bail
stage their involvement in the tragedy can be determined. This Court
cannot accede to the submissions so advanced, as this is admitted on
record that the place of occurrence is the village of all charged and
their presence can be interpreted either way, so this Court refrains to
comment upon this aspect of the case as it may prejudice the case of
either side. As I am seized of the bail matter, so tentative assessment is
warranted at bail stage with strong dislike to deeper appreciation, so
after assessing tentatively the petitioners have been succeeded in
making out a case for bail being one of further inquiry.
9. For what has been discussed above, this bail application
is allowed and the accused / petitioners are admitted to bail subject to
furnishing bail bonds amounting to Rs.2,00,000/-(two lacs), with two
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/ MOD.

Above are the reasons of my short order of the even

date.
