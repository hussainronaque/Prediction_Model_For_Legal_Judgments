JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT.

Cr.M/BA No. 2638-P/2017
JUDGMENT

Date of hearing: 18.12.2017
Petitioner: (Muhammad Idress) by Mr. Noor Alam Khan, Advocate.

Respondent: (The State) by :~ / \do. Alturas Aun AY -

WAQAR AHMAD SETH, J.- Petitioner, Idress son of Sifat
Khan, having been involved in case FIR No. 1461 dated
17.10.2015 under Sections 9(c) Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 1997 registered at Hayatabad, Peshawar was
refused bail on statutory ground i.e. non-conclusion of trial
by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-VIII/Judge Special
Court, Peshawar vide order dated 16.11.2017. Now, he has
approached this Court for the same purpose.

2. As per contents of F.I.R. on 17.10.2015, the
local police of PS Hayatabad, Peshawar, on spy information,
made nakabandi at the place of occurrence, when in the
meanwhile, motorcar/Alto bearing registration No. AB-
4714/Karachi coming from tribal territory was overpowered.
The driver disclosed his name as Muhammad Idress. On
search of vehicle, 15 packets charas garda weighing 15 Kgs
were recovered from its secret cavities made in the petrol
tank, out of which, 5/5 grams from each packet were

ye separated for analysis through FSL and the remaining stuff
A

-2-

was separately sealed in a parcel. The accused was arrested
on the spot and a case under the above section of law was
registered against him.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. On merit, the petitioner was refused bail upto
this Court and now he seeks bail on statutory ground i.e. non-
conclusion of trial, therefore, merits of the case need not to
be discussed. In the instant case, complete challan was
submitted in Court on 20.4.2016 and the case was entrusted
to learned Additional Sessions Judge-VIII, Peshawar for
disposal, who summoned the accused through Zamima Bay
for 2.5.2016, on which date, compliance of section 265-C
Cr.P.C. was made and the case was posted to 7.5.2016 for
framing of charge. On 7.5.2016, charge was framed against
the petitioner, to which, he did not plead guilty and claimed
trial, thus, PWs along with case property was summoned for
20.5.2016 and since then till 4.12.2017 only four (04) PWs
have been examined and one PW Sheraz has been
abandoned; thus, after lapse of more than one and a half
years, trial of petitioner could not be concluded, inspite of the
fact, that no delay has attributed to the petitioner except on
two occasions, whose counsel was not available. Petitioner is
behind the bars since 17.10.2015 and if the learned trial

Court shall proceed with the trial with such a pace, it would
-3-

not conclude in near future; hence, the petitioner has made

out a case for bail on statutory delay.

5. Recently, in Imtiaz Ahmed’s case_ (2017 SCMR
1194), the Hon’ble Apex Court has been held that:-

“S. 46—Right to speedy trial---Scope---
Trial before Special Court constituted
under the Control of Narcotic Substances
Act, 1997---To have a speedy trial, was the
Fundamental Right of accused---Said
principle applied more vigorously to the
trials before Special Courts, such as the
courts constituted under the Control of
Narcotic Substances Act, 1997---Any
unreasonable delay in the conclusion of
the trial, before Special Courts, would
amount to denial of justice”.

6. Similarly, in Adnan Prince’s case_ (PLD 2017
Supreme Court 147), the Hon’ble Apex Court has been held
that:

“S. 497----Penal Code (XLV of 1860), Ss.
295-A, 295-B &  295-C---Maliciously
insulting the religion or the religious
beliefs of any class, defiling etc. of copy of
Holy Quran, using of derogatory remarks
etc. in respect of the Holy Prophet-—Bail,
grant of ---Scope---Delay of more than two
years in conclusion of trial---Record
showed that three years and three months
had passed since arrest of accused—Delay
in conclusion of trial had mainly been
caused by the prosecution or the court
itself---Even if the adjournments sought by
the accused due to absence of his counsel
or his non-availability were excluded, his
total detention during the trial was more
than two years---Despite lapse of three,
years and three months examination-in-
chief of only a single witness had been
pb recorded during trial---Speedy trial was the
4 right of every accused person, therefore,
-4-

unnecessary delay in trial of such cases

would amount to denial of justice---

Accused had made out a case for grant of

bail due to inordinate delay in conclusion

of his trial---Accused was granted bail

accordingly”.
7. Thus, in view of the facts and circumstances of
the case and while relying on the aforesaid judgments of the
Hon’ble Apex Court, I accept this bail application and admit
the accused-petitioner on bail provided he furnishes bail bond
in the sum of Rs. 400,000/- (Rs. Four lacs) with two sureties
each in the like amount to the satisfaction of learned trial

Court, who shall ensure that the sureties are local, reliable

and men of means.

8. Above are the reasons of my short order of even
date.
