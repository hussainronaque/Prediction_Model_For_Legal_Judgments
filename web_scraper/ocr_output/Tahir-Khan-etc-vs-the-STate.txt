ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN_ KHAN, _J:- Through this criminal
revision petition under section 439 Cr.P.C., the petitioners
have questioned the order dated 18.01.2017, passed by the
learned trial Court/Additional Sessions Judge-I, Hangu,
whereby petitioners’ application under section 540-A
Cr.P.C. for their exemption from personal appearance was
dismissed, consequently, their bail was recalled and
proceedings under section 514 Cr.P.C. were initiated
against their sureties.

2. Facts in brief forming the background of the
instant revision petition are that petitioners are accused in

case FIR No.648 dated 01.08.2016, registered under
section 354-A, 355 and 149 PPC, at Police Station City
Hangu. Ad-interim pre-arrest bail of petitioners was
confirmed by the learned trial court vide orders dated
13.04.2018 and 11.08.2018, on the sole ground of
compromise. Later on, challan was submitted against the
petitioners and co-accused. When summoned, co-accused
Sawir and Imran appeared before the learned trial Court,
whereas the petitioners being abroad in connection with
earning their livelihood, did not appear, hence, NBWA was
issued against them vide order dated 02.01.2017 and
learned defence counsel directed to produce the petitioners
on the next date of hearing i.e. 18.01.2017. On the said
date, learned counsel for defence submitted an application
for exemption of the petitioners from their personal
appearance but the same was dismissed. Bail of the
petitioners was recalled and proceedings under section 514
Cr.P.C. initiated against sureties of the petitioners vide
order dated 18.01.2017, hence, this revision petition.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioners is not in
attendance. Learned AAG for the State and learned counsel
for the respondents heard and this petition is being
disposed of on the available record.

4. The main question for determination before this
Court is whether exemption can be granted to an accused
by the Court in absentia. To understand the intention of the

Legislature, section 540-A Cr.P.C. is reproduced below:-
“S.540-A:- (1) At any stage of an inquiry or
trial under this Code where two or more
accused are before the Court, if the Judge or
Magistrate is satisfied, for reasons to be
recorded, that any one or more of such accused
is or are incapable of remaining before the
Court, he may if such accused is represented by
a pleader, dispense with his attendance and
proceed with such inquiry or trial in his absence
and may at any subsequent stage of the
proceedings, direct the personal attendance of
such accused”.

Section 540-A Cr.P.C. has been coached in plain language
which does not postulate the physical presence of accused
as a conditioned precedent for granting exemption to him.
If it was intended by the law maker to attach such
condition, then it would have done it by mentioning the
same clearly and in unambiguous term. The term used
“before the Court”, employed in section 540-A Cr.P.C.
does not necessarily means and points towards the physical
presence of the accused. It is settled principle of
interpretation of Statute that while interpreting a Statute
relating to the realm of criminal law, which
transgresses/encroaches upon the liberty of person or
property of a subject, much care and caution be observed
and the interpretation be made in a manner which is to
preserve such right and not to disturb the same subject of
course having regard to the express language of the Statue

by not committing any violence to it. Guidance in this
regard can be derived from the judgment of the Hon’ble
apex Court in case titled, “State Vs Qaim Ali Shah (1992
SCMR 2192).

5. Admittedly, the petitioners after getting their
pre-arrest bail on the basis of compromise proceeded
abroad in connection of earning their livelihood. Besides,
one of the petitioners is present before the Court who by
appearance seems to have feeble financial position.
Keeping in mind the factum of compromise between the
parties and the law on the subject, the learned trial Court by
refusing exemption, re-calling bail and __ initiating
proceedings under section 512 and 514 Cr.P.C. has
unnecessarily burdened its self for no good reason.

6. Accordingly, this petition is allowed. The
impugned order of the learned trial Court is hereby set-
aside. The application of the petitioners under section
540-A Cr.P.C. is allowed and they are exempted from
personal appearance before the learned trial Court till
conclusion of the trial ie. the stage of closure of the
prosecution evidence, in case of trial, otherwise, till final
decision of the case, if the complainant party is no more
interested to prosecute the petitioners.
