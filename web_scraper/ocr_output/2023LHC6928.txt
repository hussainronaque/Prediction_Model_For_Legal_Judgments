Mr. Muhammad Shahzad Saleem
Warraich, Advocate.

Appellants by:

State by oe Munir Ahmad Sial, Deputy Prosecutor

Complainant by | Malik Azhar Abbas Waseer, Advocate.

Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan, J:- By this single judgment we shall
dispose of Criminal Appeal No.5537 of 2022 titled as “Muhammad Rafique and

another vs. The State _and_another”’, filed by Muhammad Rafique and Arshad

(appellants), as well as, Murder Reference No.14 of 2022, sent by the learned
trial Court for confirmation or otherwise of the sentence of death awarded to
Muhammad Rafique and Arshad (appellants) in private complaint in respect of
offences under Sections 302/364/147 and 149 PPC. We propose to dispose of both
these matters by this single judgment as both these have arisen out of the same
judgment dated 20.01.2022 passed by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Nankana
Sahib.

2. Initially on the complaint of Abdul Ghafoor, complainant (PW-1) case
F.ILR. No.51, dated 29.01.2013, was registered at police station Mangtanwala,
District Nankana Sahib, in respect of offences under sections 302/147 and 149 PPC
but later on being dissatisfied with the police investigation, Abdul Ghafoor
complainant (PW-1) filed private complaint (Exh.PB) against the appellants and

four (04) others. The learned trial Court, after observing all the pre-trial codal
Criminal Appeal No. 5537 of 2022 & 2
Murder Reference No. 14 of 2022. =

formalities, framed charge under sections 302, 364, 148, 149 PPC against the
appellants and their co-accused, namely Shahbaz (since acquitted), Mubarik Ali
(since acquitted), Qurban Riasat Ali (since acquitted) and Iftikhar alias Ghaffar
(since acquitted) on 12.08.2013, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
After conclusion of the trial, the learned trial Court (Additional Sessions Judge,
Nankana Sahib) vide its judgment dated 20.01.2022, has convicted and sentenced
the appellants as under:-

Under Section 302(b) PPC to ‘Death’ as tazir on two counts each

for committing Qatl-i-Amd of Jamal Hussain and Mst. Rabia Bibi

(deceased). Both the convicts were also ordered to pay

Rs.5,00,000/- (rupees five hundred thousand only) each to the legal

heirs of Jamal Husain (deceased) and in default thereof to further
undergo six months simple imprisonment each.

However, the learned trial Court vide the same impugned judgment acquitted
all the accused persons from the charges under Sections 364/149 of PPC. Shehbaz,
Mubarik Ali, Qurban Riasat Ali and Iftikhar alias Ghaffar co-accused were
acquitted by the learned trial Court from all the charges vide the same impugned
judgment while giving them the benefit of doubt.

3. Brief facts of the case as given by the complainant in his private compliant
(Exh.PB) are that he (complainant) was resident of Kot Bheeni Das. On 29.01.2013
at about 04:45 a.m., he (complainant) along with his wife Mst. Maqsoodan Bibi, his
sons, namely, Jamal Hussain aged 24/25 years (deceased), Bilal (PW-2), Ali Shah,
Sunny Abbas, Hammad Ali (given up PWs) was present in his house when
Muhammad Rafique (appellant) knocked the door of his house and called Jamal
(deceased) to open the door as he had some piece of work with him. Jamal
(deceased) opened the door. The complainant and his wife Maqsoodan Bibi and his
sons Bilal (PW-2), Ali Shan, Sunny Abbas, Hammad Ali (given up PWs) also came
out of their house to inquire about Jamal Hussain (deceased). They saw that
Muhammad Rafique (appellant) was armed with iron ‘kappa’, Shahbaz (acquitted
co-accused) was armed with iron ‘kappa’, Mubarik Ali (acquitted co-accused) was
armed with Sota Ghaffar (acquitted co-accused) was armed with sota, Arshad Ali
(appellant) was armed with iron ‘kappa’ and they were taking away Jamal Hussain

(deceased) while abducting him and were inflicting blows on his body with sotas.
Criminal Appeal No. 5537 of 2022 & 3
Murder Reference No. 14 of 2022. =

They (accused persons) threatened the complainant party that if anyone would
come near, then he shall be done to death but the complainant party kept on chasing
accused persons and the abductee. Accused persons took Jamal (deceased) in a
room of their house while beating him. Rafique (appellant) and his co-accused
pushed Jamal towards ground. Rafique (appellant) caught hold the deceased from
his right leg, whereas, Shahbaz (acquitted co-accused) caught hold the deceased
from his left leg. Qurban (acquitted co-accused) caught hold the deceased from his
right arm, whereas, Mubarik (acquitted co-accused) caught hold the deceased from
his left arm. Ghaffar (acquitted co-accused) sat on the abdomen of the deceased and
Arshad (appellant) cut the throat of Jamal deceased with iron ‘kappa’ due to which
he died at the spot. Then Muhammad Rafique appellant cut the throat of his niece
and sister of Arshad Ali (appellant), namely, Mst. Rabia Bibi with iron ‘kappa’ and
she also succumbed to the injury at the spot.

Initially the FIR (FIR No. 51 dated 29.01.2013 offences under Sections
302/147/149 of PPC P.S: Mangtanwala District Nankana Sahib) was lodged on
the complaint of Abdul Ghafoor complainant (PW-1) however, during the course
of investigation, police declared all the accused persons except Arshad Ali
(appellant) as innocent therefore, being dis-satisfied with the police investigation,
Abdul Ghafoor complainant (PW-1) filed the private complaint under Sections
302/364/147/149 of PPC in which the aforementioned accused persons were tried.
4. The appellants were arrested in this case and after completion of
investigation, the challan was prepared and submitted before the learned trial
Court. In the private complaint, summary evidence was recorded and the accused
were summoned to face the trial. The learned trial Court, after observing legal
formalities, as provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 framed
charge against the appellants and their co-accused on 12.08.2013 to which they
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

5. In order to prove its case, the prosecution produced three witnesses during
the trial, whereas, statements of ten Court witnesses were also recorded. The
prosecution also produced documentary evidence in the shape of Exh.PA to
Exh.PE, Exh.CW-1/1 to Exh.CW9/3 and Mark-A to Mark-I.

6. The statements of the appellants and their co-accused under Section 342 of

Cr.P.C. were recorded. Muhammad Rafique appellant refuted the allegations
Criminal Appeal No. 5537 of 2022 & 4
Murder Reference No. 14 of 2022. _-

leveled against him and professed his innocence, whereas, while answering to a
question that ‘Why this case and why the PWs deposed against you” Arshad Ali

appellant replied as under:-

Arshad Ali

“PWs are related inter-se, interested and are inimical towards me
and my co-accused persons. In-fact Mst. Rabia Bibi and Jamal Hussain
deceased persons developed illicit relations. On the fateful night, Jamal
deceased came into our house and Mst. Rabia Bibi and he went to her
room. I saw both of them in the said room in an objectionable position;
due to sudden provocation and Gairat, I picked up an iron KAPA lying
in the room and cut the throats of both the deceased persons in the heat
of passion. The occurrence was committed by myself alone and not by
any other accused persons. The complainant, PWs and the remaining
accused persons were not present at the time and place of occurrence as
alleged by Abdul Ghafoor complainant. After the occurrence, I myself
went to the police station, narrated the incident to the SHO concerned
and also produced the iron KAPA used by me in the occurrence. My
arrest was not shown immediately by the police and they kept it awaiting
and later on, according to the timings suitable to them they showed my
arrest. Later on, the complainant, with false facts and after concocting a
false story, got lodged FIR against me and others which was not
substantiated during investigation. During investigation, I also offered to
get record my statement under section 164 Cr.P.C. but the police, as it
was league with the complainant, did not produce before me before the
learned Judicial Magistrate for recording of my such statement. The
occurrence had happened due to the reason that Jamal and Rabia Bibi
deceased persons had developed illicit relations with each other. All the
facts narrated by the PWs are false.”

While answering to a question that “Why this case and why the PWs

deposed against you” Muhammad Rafique appellant replied as under:-

Muhammad Rafique

“PWs are related inter-se, interested and inimical towards me and

my co-accused persons. In-fact, Mst. Rabia Bibi and Jamal Hussain
Criminal Appeal No. 5537 of 2022 & 5
Murder Reference No. 14 of 2022. =

deceased persons developed illicit relations and on the fateful night, Jamal
deceased came into the house of Arshad my co-accused, where-after Jamal
Hussain and Rabia Bibi went to her room where Arshad my co-accused
saw them in an objectionable position and committed their murder due to
sudden provocation and Gairat. All the story narrated by the complainant

and the PWs is false.”

In answer to another question that “Have you anything else to say?”

Muhammad Rafique appellant replied as under:
“Tam innocent.”

The appellants and their acquitted co-accused neither opted to make their
statements on oath as envisaged under Section 340(2) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898 in disproof of the allegations leveled against them nor they
produced any evidence in their defence.

The learned trial Court vide its judgment dated 20.01.2022, found the

appellants guilty, convicted and sentenced them as mentioned and detailed above.
However, vide the same impugned judgment Shehbaz, Mubarik Ali, Qurban Riasat
Ali and Iftikhar alias Ghaffar co-accused were acquitted by the learned trial Court
while giving them the benefit of doubt.
7. It is contended by learned counsel for the appellants that the appellants are
innocent and they have falsely been implicated in this case by the complainant
being in league with the local police; that the occurrence was unseen; that there is
gross delay in conducting the postmortem examinations on the dead bodies of
Jamal & Mst. Rabia deceased and the said delay is suggestive of the fact that the
eye witnesses were not present at the spot at the relevant time therefore, the
abovementioned delay was consumed in procuring the attendance of fake eye
witnesses; that there are material contradictions in the statements of prosecution
witnesses; that there is conflict between the ocular account and the medical
evidence of the prosecution; that the motive has also not been proved in this case;
that the alleged recovery of ‘kappa’ has been planted against Arshad Ali appellant;
that the prosecution has failed to prove its case against the appellants beyond the
shadow of doubt. It is therefore, prayed that the instant appeal may be allowed and
the appellants may be acquitted of the charges by extending them the benefit of
doubt.
Criminal Appeal No. 5537 of 2022 & 6
Murder Reference No. 14 of 2022. =

8. On the other hand, it is contended by the learned Deputy Prosecutor General
assisted by learned counsel for the complainant that the occurrence in this case
took place on 29.01.2013 at 04:45 a.m., and the matter was promptly reported to
the police on the same day and the FIR was also lodged on the same day i.e. on
29.01.2013 at 10:15 a.m., hence, promptness of the FIR rules out the possibility of
any deliberation or concoction on the part of the prosecution; that both the eye
witnesses of the occurrence i.e., Abdul Ghaffor (PW-1) and Bilal (PW-2) were
residents of the same house from where Jamal deceased was abducted by the
accused persons therefore, their presence at the spot at the time of occurrence was
quite natural and probable; that the prosecution’s case against the appellants is
supported by the medical evidence furnished by the prosecution through Dr. Uzma
(CW-2), Dr. Muhammad Azhar Ameen (CW-3) and postmortem examination
reports, as well as, pictorial diagrams of Jamal & Mst. Rabia Bibi deceased
(Exh.CW-3/1) & (Exh.CW-2/1) respectively; that the prosecution case is further
corroborated by the recovery of ‘kappa’ from the possession of Arshad Ali
appellant and positive report of PFSA, Lahore (Exh.PE); that motive has also been
proved in this case against the appellants through reliable and confidence inspiring
evidence of the prosecution’s witnesses; that the prosecution has proved its case
against the appellants beyond the shadow of any doubt therefore, their appeal may
be dismissed, Murder Reference be answered in the affirmative and the sentences
of death awarded to Arshad Ali and Muhammad Rafique appellants by the learned
trial Court may be upheld & maintained.

9. Arguments heard. Record perused.

10. Prosecution story as set forth in the private complaint (Exh.PB) has already
been reproduced in para No.3 of this judgment therefore, there is no need to repeat
the same.

11. We have noted that the occurrence in this case took place on 29.01.2013 at
04:45 a.m., but the FIR was lodged on 29.01.2013 at 10:15 a.m., i.e., with the delay
of 05 hours and 30 minutes from the occurrence. Although the distance between
the place of occurrence and the police station was 12 kilometers and mere delay in
reporting the matter to the police may not be fatal to the prosecution case but we
have also noted that postmortem examination on the dead bodies of both the

deceased persons of this case, namely, Jamal and Mst. Rabia Bibi were conducted
Criminal Appeal No. 5537 of 2022 & 7
Murder Reference No. 14 of 2022. _

on 29.01.2013 at 07:30 p.m., and 07:45 p.m., respectively which means that there
was delay in conducting the postmortem examination on the dead body of Jamal
deceased of 14 hours and 45 minutes, whereas, there was delay of 15 hours in
conducting the postmortem examination on the dead body of Mst. Rabia Bibi
deceased. The abovementioned delay in conducting the postmortem examinations
on the dead bodies of both the deceased persons is suggestive of the fact that the
occurrence was unseen and the said delay was consumed in procuring the
attendance of fake eye witnesses. In the case of ‘Muhammad Ilyas Vs Muhammad

Abid alias Billa and others’ (2017 SCMR 54), the Apex Court of the country was

pleased to observe that delay of 09 hours in conducting the postmortem
examination suggests that prosecution eye witnesses were not present at the spot at
the time of occurrence therefore, the said delay was used in procuring the
attendance of fake eye witnesses. Relevant part of the said judgment at page No.

55 reads as under:-

“2. tisteseesees ees Post-mortem examination of the dead body of
Muhammad Shahbaz ‘deceased had been conducted after nine hours of
the incident which again was a factor pointing towards a possibility that
time had been consumed by the local police and the complainant party
in procuring and planting eye-witnesses and cooking up a story for the
prosecution. ”

Similarly, in the case of “Khalid alias Khalidi and two others vs. The State”
(2012 SCM 327), the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan considered the delay of

10/11 hours from the occurrence in conducting the post mortem examination on
the dead body of deceased, to be an adverse fact against the prosecution case and it
was held that it shows that the FIR was not lodged at the given time.

Similar view was taken by the Apex Court of the country in the cases
reported as “Sufyan Nawaz and another vs. The State and others” (2020 SCMR
192),“Zafar vs. The State and others” (2018 SCMR 326) and “Muhammad Ashraf
vs. The State” (2012 SCMR 419).

It is further noteworthy that the occurrence in this case took place in the
month of January i.e., on 29.01.2013 at 04:45 a.m., meaning thereby that the
occurrence in this case took place during the darkness of night. Bilal (PW-2) has

stated during his cross-examination that Fajar Namaz used to be offered during the
Criminal Appeal No. 5537 of 2022 & 8
Murder Reference No. 14 of 2022. =

month of January at 06:20 a.m. Relevant part of his statement in this respect reads
as under:-

,

“Tt is correct that during January namaz of Fajar is performed at 06:20 a.m.’

We have next noted that no source of light has been mentioned in the site
plan (Exh.CW-7/1) or in the statements of the abovementioned prosecution eye
witnesses rather Abdul Ghafoor complainant (PW-1) during his cross-examination
has conceded that no light was installed in the street between his house and that of
the accused. Relevant part of his statement in this respect is reproduced hereunder
for ready reference: -

“No light has been installed in the street between my house and that of accused.”

None of the prosecution eye witnesses stated that there was moon light at the
relevant time. Under the circumstances, the identification of the appellants during
the darkness of night is not free from doubt.

12. It is further noteworthy that conduct of the prosecution eye witnesses is
highly unnatural. According to the prosecution case, as set forth in the FIR, on the
night of occurrence, Jamal appellant was present in his house, where Abdul
Ghafoor complainant and his sons, namely, Bilal (PW-2), Ali Shan, Sanni Abbas
& Hammad Ali (given up PWs) were also present along with his wife, namely,
Mst. Maqsoodan Bibi and son Jamal (deceased) and as such, the complainant party
was comprising of total seven members. We have further noted that Bilal (PW-2)
who is son of the complainant, has further conceded during his cross-examination
that the house of his uncle Manzoor was situated in front of the house of the
complainant party and said Manzoor had six sons. He further conceded during his
cross-examination that he had not got recorded in his statement before the police
that any of his family members raised hue and cry when his brother was being
beaten and abducted by the accused persons nor he informed any neighbour in this
respect though house of his uncle Manzoor who had six sons was situated in front
of his house. Relevant parts of his statement in this respect read as under:-

“House of my uncle Manzoor is in front of our house..................My uncle

Manzoor have six sons named Imran, Arfan, Amir Shehzad, Gulfam,

Qaisar, Faisal Mahmood. I cannot tell their exact ages however Amir

Shehzad and Imran are married. Presently ages of Qaisar, Gulfram and
Criminal Appeal No. 5537 of 2022 & 9
Murder Reference No. 14 of 2022. =

Faisal are of about 24/25 years. Occurrence took place during winter on
29.01.2013 and in those days it was very cold..................1 have not got
recorded in my statement before police that I, my mother or any other
witness raised hue and cry that accused are taking away my brother Jamal
deceased. I have not got recorded in my statement before police that I went
to any neighbour to inform that accused have forcibly taken away my
brother Jamal deceased.”

It is also noteworthy that the accused persons were not armed with any lethal
firearm weapon like pistol, gun etc and according to the prosecution case, they
were armed with ‘kappas’ & ‘dandas’ but the complainant party, who was
comprising of at least seven members did not try to rescue Jamal deceased from the
hands of the accused persons. We are therefore of the view that conduct of the
prosecution eye witnesses, who were closely related to Jamal deceased is highly
unnatural therefore, their presence at the spot is highly doubtful, hence their
evidence is not worthy of reliance. We may refer here the case of “Liaquat Ali Vs.
The State” (2008 SMCR 95), wherein at Para No.5-A of the judgment, the
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to observe as under:-

“Having heard learned counsel for the parties and having gone
through the evidence on record, we note that although P.W.7 who
is first cousin and brother-in-law of Fazil deceased claims to
have seen the occurrence from a distance of 30 ft. (as given in
cross-examination) and two other witnesses namely Musa and
Ranjha were also attracted to the spot but none rescued Fazil
deceased and appellant had a free hand to inflict as many as 9
injuries on his person. The explanation given by these witnesses
that since Liaquat Ali had threatened them therefore, they could
not go near Fazil deceased to rescue him is repellant to common
sense as Liaquat Ali was not armed with a fire-arm which could
have scared the witnesses away. He was a single alleged
assailant and if the witnesses were there at the spot they could
have easily overpowered him. This makes their presence at the
spot doubtful.”

Similar view was reiterated by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the
cases of “Pathan Vs. The State” (2015 SCMR 315) & “Zafar Vs. The State and
others” (2018 SCMR 326). Under the circumstances, it cannot be safely held that

the abovementioned eye witnesses were present at the spot at the relevant time and

they had witnessed the occurrence because their conduct is highly unnatural.
Criminal Appeal No. 5537 of 2022 & 10
Murder Reference No. 14 of 2022. —_—

13. It is further noteworthy that ocular account of the prosecution in this case is
in conflict with the medical evidence. It was the case of the prosecution, as set
forth in the FIR, that on the night of occurrence, accused persons while armed with
different weapons came to the house of the complainant and forcibly dragged
Jamal deceased while giving him ‘sofa’ blows and took him into the house of the
accused party where they (accused persons) committed the murder of both the
deceased persons but according to the postmortem report of Jamal deceased, there
was no injury on his body except one injury on his neck which was attributed to
Arshad Ali appellant. It is further noteworthy that according to the postmortem
report of Mst. Rabia Bibi deceased, there were two injuries on her body. Injury
No.1 was on her right cheek, whereas, injury No.2 was on the right side of her
neck. None of the prosecution eye witnesses explained injury No.1 on the body of
Mst. Rabia Bibi deceased. Even the learned trial Court in paragraph No. 8 of the
impugned judgment has partly disbelieved the evidence of the prosecution eye
witnesses regarding the forcible abduction of Jamal deceased and infliction of
‘danda’ blows on his body by the accused party. Co-accused of the appellants,
namely, Mubarak Ali, Qurban Riasat Ali & Iftikhar alias Ghaffar who were
statedly armed with sotas, have already been acquitted by the learned trial Court
and petition for leave to appeal filed against their acquittal has also been dismissed.
today by this Court through a separate order of even date, being barred by time.
The abovementioned conflict between ocular account and medical evidence of the
prosecution created further dent in the prosecution case.

14. Insofar as the recovery of blood stained ‘kappa’ (Exh.CW-9/2) on the
pointation of Arshad Ali appellant is concerned, it is noteworthy that the
occurrence in this case took place on 29.01.2013, whereas, ‘kappa’ (Exh.CW-9/2)
was recovered on the pointation of the said appellant on 03.03.2013 ie., after 01
month & 03 days from the occurrence and during the abovementioned period,
Arshad Ali appellant had ample opportunity to wash way the blood on the ‘kappa’.
In the light of above, recovery of blood stained ‘kappa’ (Exh.CW-9/2) on the
pointation of Arshad Ali appellant is not free from doubt. The Hon’ble Supreme
Court of Pakistan in the case of ‘Basharat and another Vs The State’ (1995 SCMR

1735) disbelieved the evidence of blood-stained dagger which was allegedly
Criminal Appeal No. 5537 of 2022 & 1 1
Murder Reference No. 14 of 2022. —_—

recovered from the accused after ten days from the occurrence. Relevant part of the
said judgment at page No. 1739 is reproduced hereunder for ready reference: -

“11, The occurrence took place on 20.04.1988. Basharat appellant
was arrested on 28.04.1988. The blood-stained Chhuri was
allegedly recovered from his house on 30.04.1988. It is not
believable that he would have kept blood stained chhuri intact in his
house for ten days when he had sufficient time and opportunity to
wash away and clean the blood on it”

Moreover, blood disintegrates during the abovementioned period of 01
month and 03 days. Reliance in this respect may be placed on the case of

‘Muhammad Jamil Vs Muhammad Akram and others’ (2009 SCMR 120). In the

light of above, recovery of ‘kappa’ (Exh.CW-9/2) and positive report of PFSA
(Exh.PE) are inconsequential for the prosecution.

15. We have disbelieved the prosecution evidence qua ocular account and
recovery of ‘kappa’ but it is noteworthy that Arshad Ali appellant while making
his statement under Section 342 of Cr.P.C., has candidly admitted the occurrence
with the stance that on the night of occurrence, he committed the murder of both
the deceased on account of grave and sudden provocation and ‘ghairat’. The
occurrence in this case took place on 29.01.2013 which means that the same took
place prior to the amendment brought in Section 311 of PPC whereby it was
provided that if the offence has been committed in the name or on the pretext of
honour, punishment shall be imprisonment for life. As the abovementioned
amendment cannot be applied retrospectively and as the occurrence of this case
took place prior to the introduction of abovementioned amendment therefore, the
said amendment in the relevant law is not applicable in this case. We have further
noted from the statement of Arshad Ali appellant recorded under Section 342 of
CrP.C., that on the night of occurrence, he saw his sister, namely, Mst. Rabia Bibi
(deceased) with Jamal Hussain (deceased) in objectionable condition in a room of
his house, in the odd hours of night, therefore, due to grave and sudden
provocation, he committed the murder of both the deceased. It is by now well
settled that if the prosecution evidence is disbelieved then statement of an accused
is to be accepted or rejected in toto. If statement of Arshad Ali appellant is
accepted in toto, then to his extent, it is a case punishable under Section 302 (c) of

PPC and not a case punishable under Section 302 (b) of PPC. Consequently,
Criminal Appeal No. 5537 of 2022 & 12
Murder Reference No. 14 of 2022. —_

convictions & sentences of Arshad Ali appellant for the charge under Section 302
(b) of PPC are hereby set-aside and his convictions & sentences are converted to
the offence under Section 302 (c) of PPC. He is therefore, convicted under Section
302 (c) of PPC and is sentenced to fourteen (14) years rigorous imprisonment on
two counts. Compensation under Section 544-A of Cr.P.C., awarded by the learned
trial Court against Arshad Ali appellant is however, upheld & maintained.
Sentences awarded to Arshad Ali appellant shall run concurrently. Benefit of
Section 382-B of Cr.P.C., is also extended to Arshad Ali appellant. Insofar as the
case of Muhammad Rafique appellant is concerned, we have disbelieved the
prosecution evidence due to the reasons mentioned in paragraph Nos. 11 to 14 of
this judgment and as the said appellant has neither made any confession before the
learned trial Court nor he has admitted the murder of both the deceased in his
statement recorded under Section 342 of Cr.P.C., therefore, he is acquitted of the
charges by extending him the benefit of doubt. He is in jail. He be released
forthwith if not required to be detained in any other case.

16. Consequently, with the above said modification in the conviction &
sentence of Arshad Ali appellant, Criminal Appeal No. 5537 of 2022 filed by
Muhammad Rafique and Arshad appellants is hereby partly dismissed to the
extent of Arshad Ali appellant and partly allowed to the extent of Muhammad
Rafique appellant. Murder Reference (M.R. No. 14 of 2022) is answered in the
negative and death sentences of Muhammad Rafique and Arshad Ali appellants

are not confirmed.
