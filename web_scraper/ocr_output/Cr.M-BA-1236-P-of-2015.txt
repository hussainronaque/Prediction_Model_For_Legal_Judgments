IN THE PESHAWAR HIGH COURT,
PESHAWAR

(Judicial Department)

BA No. 1236-P/2015.
JUDGMENT
Date of hearing. 16.7.2015

Petitioner (Wazir Gul) By Syed Abdul Fayaz, Advocate.

State: By Mr. Muhammad Safdar Khan Standing
Counsel for the Federation (State).

QAISER RASHID KHAN, J. The petitioner,
Wazir Gul, seeks bail in case FIR No. 49/2015 dated
30.3.2015 registered under sections 419, 420, 468, 471,
109 PPC read with sections 30 NADRA Ordinance, 14
Foreigners Act and 5 (2) PC Act, Police Station FIA/
ACC, Peshawar after the said relief was declined to him
by the learned Special Judge (Central) Peshawar on
01.07.2015.

2. Allegations against the petitioner are that pursuant
to a written complaint the FIA authorities conducted
enquiry No.02/2015 wherein it was found that Wazir s/o

Said Akbar, Yousaf s/o Wazir, Mattiullah s/o Wazir
resident of Yakatoot, Street No.2 Mohmand Abad, Syed

Hassan Pir Road Peshawar presently House No. 912

Street No. 28, Sector F-9, Phase-6 Hayatabad Peshawar

being Afghan nationals have fraudulently obtained

Pakistani CNIC No. 17301-15197069-3, 17301-

91363335 and 17301-16730996-3 respectively in

connivance with NADRA officals, hence the FIR ibid.

Arguments heard and record perused.

3. As the record reveals, it was on the written

complaint of one Imtiaz Hussain who alerted the FIA

authorities and resultantly an enquiry was conducted

whereby it was unearthed that the accused-petitioner

alongwith his two sons though being Afghan Nationals

have acquired Pakistani CNICs. The main thrust of the

arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioner is

that the accused-petitioner has never claimed to be a

Pakistani and that he admits himself to be an Afghan

National presently settled in Germany with a German

nationality. His next contention is that the father’s name

of the petitioner is Gul Khan but in the CNIC, his
father’s name has been shown to be Said Akbar and

moreover, his real name is Wazir Gul but in the CNIC

his name has been mentioned as Wazir and all these

factors take the matter to one of further enquiry entitling

the accused-petitioner to bail.

4. However, the record shows otherwise. The

accused-petitioner managed to procure a Pakistani

CNIC with his name as Wazir s/o Said Akbar with his

photograph sporting short beard. He also managed

CNICs for his two sons namely, Yousaf s/o Wazir and

Matiullah s/o Wazir. Admittedly they are Afghan

Nationals. Available on record is also a photo copy of

the National Identity Card Form (in Urdu) on which too,

the photograph of the petitioner surfaces prominently.

Moreover, there are sworn affidavits of several persons

available on the file whereby they have testified to the

effect that the accused-petitioner is an Afghan National

and that he has obtained Pakistani CNICs for himself as

well as for his two sons in connivance with NADRA

officials.
5. Procuring a Pakistani CNIC by a foreign national

is undoubtedly a serious offence and has become all the

more serious in the present day scenario when the

country is faced with a wave of terrorism in which

foreign elements are involved. The accused-petitioner

cannot feign ignorance about his Pakistani CNIC

available on file. Being prima facie connected with the

commission of the offence, the accused-petitioner is not

entitled to be enlarged on bail.

Resultantly, this bail petition stands dismissed.

However, it is directed that any observations recorded in

this order, being purely tentative in nature, should in no

way prejudice the proceedings before the learned trial

Court where the case be decided on its own merits after

recording evidence.

Before parting with this order, it is observed that

such act of procuring Pakistani CNICs could not have

been made possible except with the active collusion and

connivance of the black sheep in the fold of NADRA. It

is about time that such elements are identified and
brought to book. A copy of this order be endorsed to the
Director General NADRA_ Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Peshawar as well as Chairman, NADRA Headquarters
Islamabad for information and necessary action.

Announced:
16.7.2015.
