ABDUL __SHAKOOR__ KHAN, _J:- Saifullah,

petitioner, seeks his release on bail in case
FIR No.136 dated 13.02.2017 under Section
324 PPC at Police Station Charsadda, District
Charsadda.

2. The brief facts of the case are that the
complainant Changaiz Khan’ in injured
condition reported to the local police at
casualty DHQ Hospital Charsadda to the effect
that on 13.02.2017 at17:30 hours he was
present at the place of occurrence, in the
meanwhile accused/petitioner armed with

deadly weapon came there and started firing
upon him with the intention to kill. As a result
of the said firing complainant received injury
on his left hand. Motive behind the occurrence
is stated to be domestic dispute with the
brother of the complainant. Hence
petitioner/accused was charged in the
aforementioned FIR.

3. The learned counsel for petitioner
contended that the accused/petitioner is
innocent and falsely charged in the present
case. He further contended that there is no
direct or circumstantial evidence on the
available record to connect the
accused/petitioner with the commission of the
offence. He further contended that the seat
and nature of injury sustained by the
petitioner would be punished for the hurt
caused, which fall within the contemplation of
Section 337-F (v) PPC. Thus, the petitioner is
entitled to the concession of bail.

4. As against that the learned State

counsel assisted by counsel for complainant
argued that the use of deadly weapon along
with the recovery of three empties from the
spot of occurrence leave no doubt as to the
intention on the part of the petitioner to kill
the complainant regardless altogether of the
nature and seat of injury, more-so the
petitioner remained fugitive from law for four
months, as such does not deserve for the
concession of bail.

5. I have carefully gone through the record
and anxiously considered the arguments of
learned counsel for the parties.

6. A look at the discharge summary Plastic

Surgery Unit Hayat Abad Medical Complex

which is available on judicial file shows that

there was a fracture of left thumb, which

alleged to be a fire arm injury. While a

perusal of other data so far available would

reveal that the occurrence was over without

the intervention of anybody, meaning thereby

complainant was at the mercy of the

accused/petitioner. When the alleged
occurrence viewed in this context and
background, the question whether’ the
petitioner intended the death of the
complainant requires further inquiry and
makes the case arguable for the purpose of
bail specially when there is no opinion of
expert regarding nature of injury i.e. simple
or grievous, which is on the non-vital part of
the body.

7. Moreover, basic punishment in view of
medical report for the offence allegedly
committed by the accused/petitioner was
either ‘arsh or daman’ and the sentence of
imprisonment was only discretionary and
likely to be awarded only if the behaviour of
the accused/petitioner was unusual, cruel or
indicative of misuse of force, authority or
occasion.

8. It has vehemently been argued by the
learned counsels appearing for the State and
complainant that the petitioner had remained

a proclaimed offender for a period of about
four months and, thus, he is not entitled to
any concession of bail. This Court, however,
not felt persuaded to agree with the learned
counsels for State and complainant. It has
already been held by the apex Court in the
cases of Ibrahim Vs. Hayat Gul and others
(1985 SCMR 382) and Muhammad Sadiq Vs.
Sadiq and others (PLD 1985 SC 182) thatina
case calling for further inquiry into the guilt of
an accused person bail is to be allowed to him
as of right and such right cannot be refused
to him merely on account of his alleged
abscondence which is a factor relevant only to
propriety. The same view was also followed
by the apex Court in the cases of Qamar alias
Mitho, (PLD 2012 S.C 222), Ehsanullah (2012
SCMR1137) and Muhammad Shafi (2016
SCMR 1593).

9. For the reasons stated hereinabove, the
present bail petition is accepted and the
petitioners are admitted to bail subject to

furnishing bail bonds in the sum_ of
Rs.200,000/- with two sureties each in the
like amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty

Judicial Magistrate.

Announced.
