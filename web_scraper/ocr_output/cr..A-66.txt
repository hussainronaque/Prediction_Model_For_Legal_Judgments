9) 2: As per prosecution story, on
25.08.2015 at 16:25 hours, the complainant
Muhammad Hazrat, PW-1 reported the

incident to Gul Zaman, ASI, PW-3 at the

NAWAB_ DB: Mr, Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
place of occurrence known as Hookhano Sar
Macho Talash about the unnatural death of his
son Rahim Zada, who was killed by unknown
accused. Therefore, on the basis of the said
report of the complainant, the ‘Murasila’ Ex.
PW-1/1 was drafted, which culminated into
FIR ibid being registered against unknown
accused at PS concerned on 25.8.2018.

3. Upon completion of the
investigation, complete challan was forwarded
to the SHO concerned for onward submission.
4. During the course of trial, the
prosecution examined as many as 10
witnesses whose statements were recorded and
placed on file. On closure of the prosecution
evidence, accused were examined under
section 342, Cr.P.C, wherein they denied the
charges, claimed innocence and stated to have
falsely been implicated in the case.

5. On conclusion of the trial, the
learned Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zila
Qazi Dir Lower convicted and sentenced the

accused/appellants vide the judgment

NAWAB_ DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
impugned herein. Hence, these connected
matters.

6. Arguments of learned counsel for
the accused/appellants and learned Astt:
Advocate General appearing on behalf of the
State were heard and record of the case was
perused. While the complaint on 21.05.2018
appeared before this Court and stated that he
did not want to engage counsel and would rely
on the arguments of the learned State counsel.

Ts The precise facts of the
prosecution case are that on 25.8.2015
pursuant to an information received by
Gul Zaman, ASI, PW-3 regarding the death of
the deceased Rahim Zada, the said ASI Gul
Zaman rushed to the spot where he found the
dead body of Rahim Zada son of Muhammad
Hazrat smeared in blood. There, father and
brother of the deceased alongwith elders of the
locality were present. The father of the
deceased reported the matter to the said ASI
Gul Zaman, PW-3 to the effect that his

deceased son had gone to the mountain

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
commonly known as Hookhano Sar for
collection of dry wood and grass, however,
he could not turn up, therefore, Ali
Muhammad, the relative was asked so to
search him who found the dead body of the
deceased in the aforesaid mountain smeared in
blood. The said report was recorded in shape
of ‘Murasila’ Ex. PW-1/1 and later was
incorporated in FIR No. 278 dated 25.08.2015
being registered against unknown accused at
PS concerned.

8. On 27.8.2015 Said Malookd the
brother and Muhammad Hazrat the father of
the deceased had recorded their statements
under section 164 Cr.P.C wherein they had
charged the present appellant Mst. Amina
Bibi, the widow of the deceased for
facilitation of murder of her husband.

9. On 28.8.2015 Mst. Amina Bibi
was arrested from the house of the
complainant, she was produced before the
Judicial Magistrate Chakdara, PW-10, where

she had confessed her guilt. Thereby,

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
attributing effective role of murder of the
deceased to the co-appellant Ghulam Sardar.
In the said confession, she had also admitted
her illicit relations with the co-accused
Ghulam Sardar.

10. On 30.08.2015 the Investigation
Officer had recovered an axe and a small hoe
(448) from the house of the deceased vide
recovery memo Ex. PW-8/8. Similarly, on
28.08.2015 the co-convict Ghulam Sardar
was also arrested, who according to the
investigation had made pointation of the place
of occurrence where he had killed the
deceased and in the said pointation he had also
shown Mst. Amina Bibi to be present with
him in the said Jungle.

11. Admittedly, it is an unseen
occurrence, hence the entire prosecution case
rests on the retracted confession of the
appellant Mst. Amina Bibi and the alleged
pointation made by the co-appellant Ghulam
Sardar, which was duly exhibited in the

site plan PW-8/1.

NAWAB DB: Mr, Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
“As

12. Since the main evidence against
the present appellants is the confession of
accused Mst. Amina Bibi, therefore, it would
be appropriate to reproduce the same, which

reads as under:-

13. No doubt, the said confession
was recorded on the first day of arrest of the
appellant Mst. Amina Bibi before the Judicial
Magistrate, PW-10, however, we have yet to

see as to whether the said confession which

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
was later retracted by her was voluntary and
true. Indeed, we have no doubt in our mind
that the promptly recorded confession even
if it is retracted can well be made as
ground for the conviction of the accused and
can also be considered as a corroborative
piece of evidence under Article 43 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 against
the co-accused provided that the said
confession is true and voluntary. It is evident
from record that the appellant Mst. Amina
Bibi after the commission of alleged crime
was in the house of her in-laws, wherefrom
she was arrested. She was charged on
27.08.2015 by the father-in-law and brother-
in-law, however, on the same date she was not
arrested and on the following day i.e.
28.08.2015 she was arrested and produced
before the Judicial Magistrate for recording of
her confession. Thus, before recording her
confession she was in custody of her in-laws,
therefore, in such circumstances, it was

incumbent upon the Judicial Magistrate to hawe

NAWAB_ DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr, Justice Syed Arshad Ali
provide her an atmosphere where she should
have felt no signs of fear in her mind with full
assurance that in case she was not guilty or not
making confession voluntarily then in that
case she would not be handed over back to the
police.

14. However, even if it is presumed
that it was promptly recorded confession and
voluntary, then the contents of the said
confession does not appear to be true because
in the said confession she had stated that she
had developed illicit relations with the
co-accused Ghulam Sardar. The said illicit
relations were known to her cousins, who had
leveled allegation of illicit relations against
them and subsequently she was also seen by
her husband in the company of Ghulam
Sardar. However, when the complainant
Muhammad Hazrat and Said Malook appeared
before the Court as PW-1 and PW-2
respectively they did not mention about such
relations before the Court. Whereas the father-

in-law Muhammad Hazrat has admitted in his

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-10-

cross-examination that he alongwith his son
and daughter-in-law were residing in a house
having a common boundary wall. Both the
witnesses have further admitted that they do
not know about any illicit relations between
the accused. Even the Investigation Officer,
while appearing as PW-8 has also admitted
during cross-examination that according to the
CDR data on the same day i.e. 25.8.2015 there
was no conversation between both the
accused. In the said confessional statement,
the appellant Mst. Amina Bibi did not say that
she was present at the time of murder of the
deceased in the jungle. Whereas addition
made in the site plan, Ex. PW-8/1 by the
Investigation Officer on the pointation of the
co-accused Ghulam Sardar, Mst. Amina Bibi
was shown present at the place of occurrence
at point No. 3. Thus, the contents of the
confession recorded by her is not corroborated
by the other evidence, therefore, the same

does not appear to be true.

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-ll-

15. As stated above, the retracted
confession if confidence inspiring can be
made a ground for conviction of the accused,
however, when the same appears to be untrue
and involuntary, it would not be safe to solely
rely on the said confession for conviction of
the accused without further corroboration of
the said confessional statement through
confidence inspiring circumstantial evidence.
Thus, in the circumstances, the benefit of
doubt must be given to the accused/appellants.
The alleged articles recovered from the house
of the accused are ordinary tools of farming
and there is no evidence that the same were
used in commission of offence.

16. Similarly, it is settled law
embodied in Article 43 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 that the confession of
the accused facing joint trial is only a
corroborative piece of evidence against the co-
accused, which requires strong corroboration.
In the present case, when we have disbelieved

the said confession against its maker i.e. the

NAWAB DB: Mr, Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-12-

appellant Mst. Amina Bibi, then the same has
no evidentiary value against the co-accused
Ghulam Sardar. Even otherwise, there is no
other corroborative piece of evidence
available on the file, which connects the
co-accused Ghulam Sardar with the
commission of offence. In this regard reliance
is placed on the judgment of the august
Supreme Court of Pakistan titled “Mushtaq
and others vs the State (2012 SCMR_109)”,
wherein it was held that:- “As the accused did
not admit to have killed the deceased,
therefore, he could not be held responsible
for killing on the confessional statements of
co-accused.”

The same ratio further reflects in

“

‘Abdur _Rehman’s_case_reported_as 2018

YER 1629”, wherein it was observed by the
Hon’ble High Court:- “Confession made by
accused could not be used as a substantive
piece of evidence to make the same basis of

conviction of co-accused. Confessional

NAWAB DB: Mr, Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-13-

statement could be used a corroborative
piece of evidence, if corroborated by
independent evidence.’’

17. In the above backdrop and after
reappraisal of the entire evidence, this Court is
of the firm view that the prosecution case
against both the accused/appellants has not
been proved beyond any reasonable doubt and
the judgment of learned trial Court dated
02.03.2017 is based on wrong appreciation of
evidence. Hence, we accept both these
connected appeals and set-aside the impugned
judgment rendered by the learned trial Court.
Therefore, the accused/appellants Mst. Amina
Bibi and Ghulam Sardar are acquitted of the
charges leveled against them. They be
released forthwith if not required in any other
case.

18. Likewise, the connected
criminal revision bearing No. 31-M of 2017
preferred by the State (petitioner) for
enhancement has become infructuous, which

is accordingly dismissed.
