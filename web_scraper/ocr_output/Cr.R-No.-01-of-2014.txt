Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
4. Before arguments were to be further
heard on merits, learned counsel for the
Petitioner pointed out that impugned judgment
has been rendered by the learned trial Court in
violation of section 367 Cr.P.C as the learned
trial Court has not determined points in the
impugned judgment for determination, rather
the findings were delivered in slipshod manner
without applying his judicial mind to the real
facts and circumstances of the case. Before
delivering any further findings in this behalf, it
would be appropriate to reproduce section 367

Cr. P.C for ready reference:-

S.367. Language of judgment:
Contents of judgment: (1) Every
such judgment shall, except as
otherwise expressly provided by
this Code, be written by the
presiding officer of the Court or
from the dictation of such
re presiding officer in the language
of the Court, or in English, and
shall contain the point or points
for_determination, the decision

thereon and the reasons for the
decision and shall be date and

signed by the presiding officer in

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim

open Court at the time of
pronouncing it and were it is not
written by the Presiding Officer
with his own hand, every page of
judgment shall be signed by him.

(2) It shall specify the offence (if
any) of which, and the section of
Pakistan Penal Code or other
law under which the accused is
convicted and the punished to

which he is sentence.

(underline is emphasized)

5. It is the main theme of section 367
Cr.P.C that the judgment of the Court shall
contain the points for determination, the
decision thereon and the reasons for the
decision. In this respect reliance has been placed
on case law cited as 1997 SCMR 871 " Sahib

Khan and 4 others vs The State and others".

The relevant of the said judgment speaks of:-

" For reasons to be recorded

later, we set aside the

wr impugned judgment in both

oo these appeals for the reason

that the impugned judgment
does not contain valuation of
evidence and discussion in the

manner it should be and also

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
does not assign reasons for
arriving at the conclusion as
required under section 367
Cr.P.C.

On the same analogy another
dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
Pakistan can be referred to cited as 2003

SCMR 698 "Ashig Hussain and others vs The

State and two others".

Likewise, the use of word "shall" in
section 367 Cr.P.C has been purposely used in
order to put emphasis that compliance of the
provision of ibid section is mandatory and non-
compliance whereof would render the judgment

inherently defective and illegal. In case titled

"Khalid Mehmood vs The State" (2004 P Cr.

LJ__984_(FSQ), this principle has been

enunciated in the following manner:-

" As to the second limb of

argument in the contention

pe that the learned trial Judge
a has also failed to formulate
the points for determination, it

may be pointed out here that

use of the word "shall" in

provision of section 367

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
placed on case titled as " Farrukh Sayyar and

2_others_yvs Chairman NAB Islamabad and

other _(2004_SCMR_ 1), wherein it has been

held:-

we

Cr.P.C, in accordance with the

terms, is mandatory."

In this behalf reliance can safely be

" It is mandatory requirement
of section 367 Cr.P.C that a
Court while writing a
judgment shall refer to the
point or points of
determination, record decision
thereon and also give reasons
for the decision. The Court
shall also specify the offence
of which, and the section of
the Pakistan Penal Code or
other law under which the
accused is convicted and the
punishment to which he is
sentenced. In the present case
the learned trial Court
overlooked the mandatory
provisions of section 367
Cr.P.C and rendered a
judgment which falls short of
the requisite standard. Failure
to specify the points for
determination as required

under section 367 Cr.P.C is an

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan

Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
omission which is not curable
under section 537 Cr.P.C and
absence of decision on the
points for determination and
reasons in the judgment
amount to an illegality which
prejudice the case of the

accused."
6. In the light of above-referred
dictums of the Hon'ble superior Courts learned
counsel for the accused/Respondent No. 1 and
learned A.A.G tried their level best to
distinguish the case of accused but they badly
failed to satisfy the Court in this regard in
respect of an illegality being committed by the
learned trial Court through the impugned
judgment in view of non-compliance of section

367 Cr.P.C.

7. Thus, in the above backdrop,
without dilating upon the merits of the
case/evidence, lest it may prejudice the case of
either side, we are of the absolute view that the
impugned judgment rendered by the learned
trial Court is violative of the statutory

provisions of section 367 Cr.P.C., therefore, is

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim

not sustainable in the eye of law. Thus, on
acceptance of this criminal revision the
impugned judgment of conviction is set aside
and the case is remitted back to the learned trial
Court for decision afresh as per spirit of section
367 of the Code of Criminal Procedure within a
shortest possible time after affording fair
opportunity of hearing to the learned counsel for
the parties including the State. The parties are

directed to appear before the learned trial Court
