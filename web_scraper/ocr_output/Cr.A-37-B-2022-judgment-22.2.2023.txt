SHAHID KHAN, J.--- Afsar Khan, the appellant through

Additional Sessions Judge, Karak at Takht-e-Nasrati in

so

2. The transient facts as unfolded in the first
information report are that on 18.11.2008 at 16:00 hours
the complainant Aurangzeb along with his brother Abdul
Wahab and cousin Wali Khan was fetching reed trees
through donkey cart from the house of Abdul Manaf to
their house. Wali Khan and Abdul Wahab were going
ahead at some distance. On their reaching to the house of
Abdul Wahab, meanwhile accused/ appellant along with
co-accused Junaid Khan, duly armed with Kalashnikovs
came to the place of incident from front side and fired at
Abdul Wahab, as a result of which he got hit and died on
the spot. The accused after commission of the offence
fled away from the place of incident. Motive for the
offence was stated to be dispute over paternal land.
Hence, the ibid FIR.

3. After completion of usual investigation, the
prosecution submitted challan under section 512 Cr.P.C
against the accused and on 26.3.2009 they were declared
as proclaimed offenders. Later on the accused/appellant
applied for Bail Before Arrest which was dismissed on
09.7.2019, whereafter he was arrested and thereafter
prosecution submitted supplementary challan against him
for trial. The accused was produced in custody and

provisions of section 265-C.Cr.P.C were complied with.
On 03.10.2019 formal charge was framed against the
accused/appellant to which he pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. The prosecution in order to prove its case,
produced and examined as many as ten witnesses.

4. On closure of prosecution’s evidence,
statement of appellant/accused was recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he professed innocence and
false implication, however, neither he opted to be
examined on oath as provided under section 340(2)
Cr.P.C, nor wished to produce defence evidence. After
hearing arguments, the learned trial Court arrived at the
conclusion that the involvement of the accused Afsar
Khan has been substantiated in view of the evidence so
recorded, as such, he was convicted & sentenced vide the
impugned judgment, Hence, the instant appeal against the

judgment of conviction.

5. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
accused/appellant argued that the accused/appellant is
innocent and falsely implicated by the complainant on
malafi basis; that order and judgment of Additional
Sessions Judge, Karak at Takht-e-Nasrati is illegal and
perverse and not sustainable in the eye of law. Added, no

weapon of offence or other incriminating article was
recovered from the possession of accused/ appellant during
investigation/interrogation; that there are glaring
contradictions on record which have virtually ruined the
case of prosecution and, therefore, the impugned judgment
of conviction is unsustainable; that after making
preliminary investigation the instant case has been
registered by the complainant; that the medical evidence,
site plan, recoveries and F.S.L report do not support the
prosecution case. Concluded, the occurrence has not taken
place in the mode & manner so alleged by the prosecution
and intended to have presented before the Court and the
allegations against the convicts/appellant are full of
surmises, conjectures and doubts, whereas, the learned trial
Court could not be able to appreciate the facts &
circumstances coupled with the mode & manner of the
occurrence and proper appreciation of the evidence so
furnished, as such, on acceptance of the appeal in hand, the
impugned conviction & sentence of the appellant/ accused
deserves to be set aside followed by his acquittal to meet

the ends of justice.

6. On the other hand, the learned Additional
Advocate General assisted by the learned counsel for the

complainant vehemently controverted the arguments
advanced by the learned Counsel for the appellant and
submitted that the instant case is arising out of an
promptly lodged F.I.R without any consultation &
deliberation rather based on actual facts & circumstances.
The appellant being known to the complainant party has
been directly nominated with not only specific role in the
commission of offence in respect of the promptly lodged
F.I.R excluding the remote chance of any consultation &
deliberation. Added, the evidence, substantive &
circumstantial so collected during the investigation,
connects the convicts/appellant with the commission of
offence. The complainant and eye witness on their turn as
PW-8 and PW-9 respectively are focal & consistent on the
emerged of the accused at the fateful time, being known to
him, have been duly nominated with the kind of weapons
of offence so carried followed by assault through firing
with their respective weapons of offence. Added, during
the trial, the substantive evidence so furnished has faced
the lengthy and searching examination-in-cross of the
learned defence counsel but nothing as favourable could
have been brought from their mouths to shatter their
veracity & truthfulness. The subject account is focal &
consistent on the material points and during the trial the

same has neither been shattered nor contradicted, as such,
=

worth reliable, therefore, the learned trial Court has
properly appreciated the facts & circumstances coupled
with the evidence, substantive & circumstantial and has
arrived at a right & just conclusion followed conviction of
the accused/appellants. Concluded the impugned
judgment & conviction of the learned trial Court being
based on proper appraisal of the evidence, substantive &
circumstantial coupled with the law on subject and

requested for dismissal of the subject appeal.

7. Learned counsel for the parties as well as the
Asstt: Advocate General were heard at length and the record

was scanned through, with their valuable assistance.

8 The record reflects that it was on 18.11.2008 at
16:00 hours, when the complainant alongwith his brother
Abdul Wahab and cousin Wali Khan after fetching reed
trees through donkey cart from the house of Abdul Manaf
were to proceeding to their house and when reached to the
place of incident, the accused/ appellant alongwith co-
accused, armed with Kalashnikovs, came there and fired at
Abdul Wahab with intention to commit his murder, as a
result of it, the deceased was hit, fell down and died on the
spot. The deceased was shifted to police station Takht-e-

Nasrati, where the matter was reported to Ali Hussain DSP
(PW-04). The scribe after drafting the FIR, prepared the
injury sheet and inquest report and the dead body was sent
to the doctor for postmortem examination. The investigating
officer after receiving copy of the FIR visited the spot and
on pointation of the complainant, prepared the site plan.
During spot inspection he vide recovery memo Ex.P.C
recovered and took into possession blood stained earth from
the place of deceased and sealed the same into parcel. Vide
same memo he also recovered and took into possession
three empties of 7.62 bore from the places of accused lying
in scattered condition and sealed the same into parcel.
Through recovery memo Ex.PC/1 the investigating officer
took into possession one blood stained shrit and one bunyan
belonging to the deceased. Initially, the appellant remained
in hiding and was declared a proclaimed offender. After his
arrest, the appellant faced trial and on its conclusion, was

convicted and sentenced as stated above.

9. There is no denial at all that the matter was
thrashed out by the learned trial Court and that the material
aspects of the case were taken into consideration while
determining the fate of the appellant. As this Court is seized
of the matter, so in order to appreciate as to whether the

conclusion drawn by the learned judge finds favour from
record of the case and as to whether the statements of the
witnesses were so consistent, which ended in conviction. To
ascertain this material aspect of the case, the court feel it
essential to revisit the entire case i.e. the collected record
and the recorded statements, as the question of life and

liberty of a citizen is involved.

10. In order to establish the charge against the
accused/appellant, the prosecution has examined as many
as 10 witnesses. The statement of accused/appellant was
recorded U/S. 342 Cr.P.C in which he denied the charge
and stated that he is innocent and has been falsely
implicated in the case.

11. The prosecution rested its case on the ocular
testimony, furnished by complainant/PW-8, brother of
deceased, eye witness/PW-9, cousin of the deceased, the
motive, medical evidence and recoveries from the scene
of crime i.e. blood stained earth and empties of 7.62,
abscondance of accused and site plan.

12. The most important witnesses examined by
the prosecution was the complainant who claims that he
has witnessed the whole occurrence from its
commencement till its end. In his statement, the witness

deposed that at the fateful time, date and place, he along
with his deceased brother Abdul Wahab and cousin Wali
Khan was bringing Sarkanda in donkey cart from the
house of Abdul Manaf. His deceased brother Abdul
Wahab and PW Wali Khan were going at some distance
in front of him. When they reached to the house of
deceased, the accused/appellant and co-accused Junaid
duly armed with Kalashnikovs came in front of them and
started firing at Abdul Wahab, with which his deceased
brother was hit and died on the spot. After commission of
offence, accused decamped from the spot. The
complainant, PW Wali Khan and people of the locality
took the dead body of the deceased to the police station,
where he lodged the report. The report correctly bears his
signature as well as the signature of Wali Khan. The site
plan was also prepared at his instance. Motive behind the
occurrence was dispute over the paternal land. He
charged the accused for commission of the offence.
Likewise, Wali Khan, eye witness/PW-9 deposed that on
18.11.2008 at about 16:00 hours, he along with his cousin
Aurangzeb and deceased Abdul hWahab was bringing
Sarkandas in Gadha Gari from the house of Abdul Manaf
and were coming to their house. He and Abdul Wahab
were going at some distance in front of Aurangzeb. When

they reached to the house of deceased, the accused duly
-10-

armed with Kalashnikovs came in their front and started
firing at the deceased, as a result of which he was hit and
died on the spot. After commission of offence, accused
decamped from the spot. He along with complainant and
people of the locality took the dead body of deceased to
the police station, where Aurangzeb lodged the report and
his signature was also obtained on it which correctly
bears his signature as well as the signature of Aurangzeb.
He also identified the dead body of the deceased before
the police as well as before the doctor.

13. These witnesses were cross-examined at
length by learned counsel for defence, however, nothing
could be elicited so as to doubt their statements. Besides,
their testimony get corroborated from the evidence of Dr.
Gul Sanat Shah (Retired Principal Medical officer) (PW-
7) who found 1/4x1/4 FAI entry wound on back of skull
on occipital area with 12x6 inch FAI exit wound on front
of skull with shattering of skull bone and brain exit injury
No.1, 1/4x1/4 inch FAI entry wound medical side of left
upper arm making exit 2 x % inch on later side of left
upper arm exist of injury No.2, 1/4x1/4 inch FAT entry
wound on back of upper right limb making exit 1/4x1/4
inch on anterior side of left arm exit to injury No.3,

1/4x1/4 inch FAI injury on left side pelvis making exist
-ll-

%2 x 4 inch on front of abdomen around umbilicus exit to
injury No.4 and 1/4x1/4 inch FAI entry wound on back of
left side chest making exit wound 1/4x1/2 inch on lateral
side chest right side chest exit to injury No.5) which
confirms the occular account of complainant regarding
the weapon used in the occurrence. The arguments of
learned counsel for the accused/appellant that the
complainant/PW-8 and eye witness/PW-9 were none
other than the brother and cousin respectively of deceased
and is, therefore, highly interested witness and his
deposition should, thus, be discarded, as it has not been
corroborated by any independent witness, does not
commended us. The mere fact that deceased was brother
of the complainant and cousin of the eye witness does not
impeach their evidence in any manner. However, their
evidence must be scrutinized carefully and if on such
scrutiny their testimony is found wholly trustworthy and
intrinsically reliable then probable conviction can be
based on the testimony of such witnesses, besides a close
relative of a deceased would be most reluctant to spare
the real culprit and implicate innocent person. We thus,
reject the submission of learned counsel for the appellant,
that PW-8 the complainant and PW-9 the eye witness

being related to the deceased shall not be relied upon.

Reliance is place on case titled “Ijaz Ahmad Vs. The
State and others” (2022 SCMR 1577) wherein it has
been held that:-

(d) Penal Code (XLV of 1860)---

“.---§, 302(b)--- Qatl-i-amd---Prosecution
witness related to the deceased---Testimony-
--Mere relationship of the prosecution
witnesses with the deceased cannot be a
ground to discard the testimony of such
witnesses unless previous enmity or ill will
is established on the record to falsely

implicate the accused in the case.”
14, Other than the above, it is case of the
prosecution that after the occurrence, the appellant and
co-accused Junaid had disappeared and were declared as
proclaimed offenders. The appellant Afsar Khan was
arrested on 09.7.2019, whereas, co-accused Junaid is still
wanted. Even if it is presumed that the abscondance of
appellant has not been proved in accordance with law,
even then his long disappearance and avoiding from
process of justice is a hurdle in his way and can be used
as corroboration to the occular account. The appellant
could not explain his long disappearance of about ||
years. The appellant also could not dispute his date of

arrest as stated by the investigating officer.
-13-

15. Pursuant to the above, we have come to the
conclusion that the prosecution has established its case
beyond any shadow of doubt against the appellant and
the conviction and sentence recorded by the trial Court
through the impugned judgment is based on correct
appreciation of evidence, which does not call for any
interference. Therefore, the judgment of conviction and
sentence recorded by the learned trial Court is

maintained and this appeal is dismissed accordingly.
