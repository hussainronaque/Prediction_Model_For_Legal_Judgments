SYED MUHAMMAD _ATTIQUE SHAH, _J.-
Through this single judgment, this Court shall dispose
of two Bail petitions, as both are outcome of one and
the same case registered vide F.[.R No.170 dated
01.05.2018 under sections 395/109 PPC, PS Mangal,

Abbottabad. ‘he particulars of the petitions are as

under:
(i) Cr.M (BA) No.896-A of 2018
Samiullah Vs. The State etc.
(ii) Cr.M (BA) No.908-A of 2018 Lal
Meran etc Vs. The State ete.
2. The allegations against the accused-

petitioners, Samiullah and Lal Meran, as reveals from

record of the case, registered on the report of
Muhammad Irfan Abbasi, complainant on 01.05.2018
at 14.00 hours, that they facilitated their co-accused
Izzat Khan Afridi and others in dacoity of different
foreign currency worth Rs.9,800,000/- from cash van
bearing No.BF-9472 on 30.04.2018 at 13.30 hours
near Nikka Pani, within the criminal jurisdiction of
Police Station Mangal, Abbottabad.

3. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
accused/petitioners and learned AAG heard and the
record perused. The complainant despite service has
not attended the Court.

4. Perusal of record would reveal that both
the present accused/petitioners are not charged in the
F.LR and subsequently, during investigation, they
were attributed the role of abetment in the
commission of alleged offence. ‘The main role of
committing dacoity has been attributed to the co-
accused Izzat Khan Afridi. Admittedly, nothing
incriminating has been recovered from the present
accused/petitioners. Morcover, at the moment, no
direct or circumstantial evidence is available on the
record connecting the accused/petitioners with the
commission of alleged offence. ‘Thus, without
touching other aspects of the case, this Court

considers that in view of the peculiar facts and
circumstances, a case of ‘further inquiry’ into the guilt
of the accused/petitioners is made out in their favour,
as contemplated in subsection 2 of section 497
Cr.P.C.

5. The observations rendered hereinabove
being tentative in nature, would not affect the mind of
the trial Court in any manner whatsoever, during trial
of the case.

6. Consequently, both the bail applications
are accepted and accused-petitioners Samiullah son of
Balo Khan and Lal Meran son of Sakhi Jan, are
admitted to bail, subject to their furnishing bail bonds
in the sum of Rs.200,000/- (Rupees two lacs), each,
with two sureties cach in the like amount, to the
satisfaction of the I/laga/Duty Judicial Magistrate,

Abbottabad.
