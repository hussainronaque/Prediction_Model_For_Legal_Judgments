SYED ARSHAD ALI, J.- This judgment of mine is aimed
to decide the issue of maintainability of the instant
application for leave to appeal and the connected Criminal
Appeal No. 250-M/2016 through which the judgments and
orders of the trial Courts have been challenged whereby
complaints of the present petitioner and appellant in the
connected appeal under the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005
(the Act) were dismissed and respondents in both the cases
were acquitted. The common question of law i.e
maintainability of appeal under the Act is involved in both
ec, _| the cases, which is decided through this single order.
2 The learned counsels for the respondents in
‘Taleroal* (SB) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali

(€r.M 3-M of 2019 Mst. Farah Deeba Vs, Said Muhammad and other)
both the cases have raised a preliminary objection on the

maintainability of the appeal stating that under section 8-A
of the Act, only appeal against conviction of the accused
under section 3 of the Act is maintainable whereas appeal
against his acquittal or dismissal of complaint is not
maintainable because the provisions of the Code of
Criminal Procedure (the Code) has very limited application
as provided under section 9 of the Act.

3. Against that the learned counsels for the
petitioners in both the cases have argued that not only
appeal against conviction of the accused facing trial of the
Act is maintainable but order passed by trial Court under
section 3 of the Act, be that acquittal or dismissal of
complaint, is also now maintainable before this Court. Both

the parties have relied on the following case law.

“Pir Farman Ali Shah and 10 others Vs. Yousaf Khan and 4

others” 2019 MLD 1622 (Peshawar (Bannu Bench)],
“Zafar Igbal Vs. The State and 5 others” 2012 P Cr.LJ 507

(Lahore], “Mian Sharif Khan Vs. Nawab Khan _and_5

others” PLD 2011 Peshawar 86, “Mian Bahadur Jan Vs.

The State and another’’ PLD 2009 Peshawar 70, “Yafas
Vs. The State and other’? PLD 2007 Peshawar 123 and

“Faiz Muhammad and others Vs. Mehrab Shah and others”

| PLD 1997 Peshawar 166.

4. Arguments heard and record of the case was
perused.
5 The aforesaid law referred by learned counsels

for the parties have no application to the present issue
because in the said case law the issue before the Court was
maintainability of appeal against any order passed under the
Act prior to insertion of Section 8A in the Act. However, in
the case of Mian Sharif Khan supra, a Division Bench of
this Court has held that under the Act, the right of appeal is
not available even to a convicted person under the Act.
Similarly, the law laid down by this Court in the case of Pir
Farman Ali Shah supra, wherein it was held that appeal
against acquittal under section 417 of the Code is
maintainable, the ratio of the law laid down by the Division
Bench of this Court in Mian Sharif Khan’s case was not
considered.

6. In the context of the present cases, the
complainants in their respective complaints before the trial
Court in both the cases have asserted their illegal
dispossession from the disputed property and have invoked
the provisions of Sections 3 to 8 of the Act for initiation of
legal action against the respondents. In order to
comprehend the issue, I would like to reproduce the

relevant provisions.

Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
(CoM 3-M of 2019 Mst. Farah Deeba Vs. Satd Muhammad and other)

3. Prevention of illegal possession of property, etc.- (1)
No one shall enter into or upon any property to
dispossess, grab, control or occupy it without having any
lawful authority to do so with the intention to dispossess,
grab, control or occupy the property from owners or
occupier of such property.

(2) Whoever contravenes the provisions of the subsection
(1) shall, without prejudice to, any punishment to which
he may be liable under any other law for the time being in
force, be punishable with imprisonment which may
extend to ten years and with fine and the victim of the
offence shall also be compensated in accordance with the
provision of section 544-A of the Code.

(3) whoever forcibly and wrongfully dispossesses any
owner or occupier of any property and his act does not
fall within sub-section (1), shall be punished with
imprisonment which may extend to three years or with
fine or with both, in addition to any other punishment to
which he may be liable under any other law for the time
being in force. The person dispossessed shall also be
compensated in accordance with provisions of section
511-A of the Code.

8. Delivery of possession of property to owner, etc.- (1)
On conclusion of trial, if the Court finds that an owner or
occupier of the property was illegally dispossessed or
property was grabbed in contravention of section 3, the
Court may, at the time of passing order under subsection
(2) and (3) of that section, direct the accused or any
person claiming through him for restoration of the
possession of the property to the owner or, as the case
may be, the occupier, if not already restored to him under
section 7.

8-A. Appeal. Any order made under sub-section (2) and
sub-section (3) of section 3 and sub-section (1) of section
8 shall, within 30 days of the order, be appeal-able before
the High Court.

7. The learned counsels for the respondents have

mainly argued that under section 8-A of the Act, the order
‘referred as appealable are the orders passed under sub-
section (2) & (3) of Section 3 which envisages for sentence,
therefore, appeal would be available to the convicted person
and not to the complainant. I do not find myself in

consonance with the said submission of the learned

(s8)

Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
{Cr.M 3-M of 2019 Mst. Farah Decba Vs Said Muhammad and other)
counsels for the respondents. Unlike the Code, which has
provided elaborately appeals against the orders of acquittal

and conviction of a criminal Court, Section 8-A of the Act

is absurd. However, on close perusal of the two words of

the provision i.e “any order” occurring in section 8-A of
the Act has a wider connotation and exhibit the intention of
the law maker. The word “any” is indeed a word of wider
meaning which prima facie means “without limitation”. In

the case of “Lakhi Barua v Union of India” (AIR 2008 Cal

59 (DB), the word “any” has been explained as under:-

“The word ‘any’ dictionarily means ‘one or some
or all’, In Black’s Law Dictionary (6" edn) it is
explained thus: “Word ‘any’ has a diversity of
measuring and may be employed to indicate ‘all’
or ‘every’ as well as ‘some’ or ‘one’ and its
meaning in a given statute depends upon the
context and subject-matter of the statute”.

Similarly, the word “order” when not defined
or explained in the Act, would be held equivalent to or
synonymous to the word ‘decision’. In the the case of

“Beneth Coleman & Co v. ITO (1983) 14] ITR 239, 245
(Bom)” the Indian High Court has explained the word

“order” as “grant or refusal of consent would be an
‘order’”.
Indeed, the words “order” or “judgment” are

ge to be interpreted in the context of a statute where it occurs.

In the Act, the trial Court (Court of Sessions Judge or

‘Tehannet* (SB) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
(Cr.M 3-M of 2019 Mst. Farah Deeba Vs, Satd Muhammad and other}

(SB)

Additional Sessions Judge) has been empowered to take

cognizance of the matter under the Act. The Act empowers
the Court to pass various orders during the proceedings.

8. Section 3 (1) of the Act makes illegal
occupying of the property as an offence and sub-sections
(2) and (3) thereof provides the punishment for illegal
occupation of the property. It is the discretion of the trial
Court, either to acquit or convict the accused or even
dismiss the complaint, if found non-maintainable, keeping
in view the law and evidence on record. The said order of
acquittal of the accused, dismissal of the complaint or
conviction of the accused would fall within the mischief of
word “order” and are thus appealable in terms of section
8A of the Act. Similarly the dismissal of the complaint will
have the same consequence because the complaint, as
provided in the Act, is not synonymous with the complaint
as provided in section 4 (h) of the Code. |

9 In light of the above discussion, appeal against
the order of acquittal passed by trial Court under the Act is
maintainable. Through this application the Petitioner has
sought leave of this court to file an appeal under section 417
of the Code, which is accordingly converted into appeal in
view of the law laid down by the August Supreme Court of

Pakistan in “Muhammad Akram Vs. DCO Rahim Yar

Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
{(Cr.M 3-M 0f 2019 Mst. Forah Deeba Vs. Said Muhammad and other}

| Khan” 2017 SCMR 56. The Office shall make necessary |
amendment/rectification in the memo of this petition as
well ‘as in the relevant register. Since the Respondent
accused in the instant case is present in the court, therefore

he shall submit a personal bond for his appearance for an

amount of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties each in the like

amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court, returnable to

the Additional Registrar of this Court. The issue regarding

maintainability of the connected Cr.A No. 250-M/2016

against acquittal of the accused is decided accordingly. The

accused/respondents in the said appeal shall also submit
personal bonds in the sum of Rs.50,000/- each with two
sureties for their appearance to the satisfaction of the trial
Court. To come up alongwith the connected Cr.A No.

250-M/2016 on 08.4.2020.
