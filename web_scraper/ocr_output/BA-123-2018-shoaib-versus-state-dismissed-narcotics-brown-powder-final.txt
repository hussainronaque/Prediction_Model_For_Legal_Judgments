QAISER RASHID KHAN, J. The accused/
petitioner, Shoaib , seeks bail in case FIR No. 837
dated 23.11.2017 registered under sections 9 (c),
Control of Narcotic Substances Act,1997, Police
Station Gulbahar, District Peshawar, with the
allegations that 12000 grams charas were recovered

from a plastic sack carried by him.

2. Arguments heard and the available record
perused.
3. All that the learned counsel for the

petitioner vehemently contends is that the
accused/petitioner has been falsely charged in the

instant case and more so that as per the FIR he was
allegedly found to be carrying 12 kgs of charas ‘garda’
however the FSL report shows the same to be ‘brown
solid’ and hence keeping in view such contradiction,
the matter obviously leads to one of further inquiry.
The learned counsel placed reliance on the judgment of

the august apex court in Criminal Appeal No. 14-P of

2015 titled “Muhammad Mustafa versus the State”
decided on 06.05.2015.

The learned AAG, on his turn, opposes
the bail petition of the accused/petitioner on the ground
that huge quantity of narcotics has been recovered
from his possession and thus disentitling him to the
concession of bail.

4. As per the FIR, it was during patrol duty
and on receipt of a spy information that a person
would be smuggling huge quantity of charas from the
tribal territory to Punjab through Lahore Bus Terminal,
Peshawar, when a nakabandi was laid by the local
police and on the arrival of the accused/petitioner
carrying a plastic sack, on the pointation of the spy,
was overpowered who disclosed his name to be Shoaib
and from the plastic sack, 12 packets of charas each

weighing 1000 grams were recovered and from each
packet, 5 grams were separated for the purpose of
sending the same to FSL for chemical analysis.
5. The argument of the learned counsel for
the petitioner that whereas in the FIR charas garda has
been mentioned but the FSL report shows the same as
‘solid brown’ cannot be looked into at this bail stage.
Of late, an impression is being imparted
that ‘garda’ as the word connotes means something to
be in powder or particle form. However, the same is
not true in the case of charas. Charas ‘garda’ for all
practical purposes is in semi solid raw form and after
going through some baking process, it turns into charas
pukhta and that is how the FSL report not only in this
case but in other cases as well show ‘charas garda’ as
‘brown solid’. In the case of charas, be that charas
garda or charas pukhta, it is only after undergoing
Duquensois test and Thinlayer Chromatography
(TLC) when the nature of the contraband item is
affirmed. In this case too, both the tests are in the
affirmative.
6. Given the recovery of huge quantity of
charas weighing 12 kgs from the personal possession

of the petitioner and the FSL report in respect of the
contraband charas being in the affirmative, the
accused/petitioner is prima facie connected with the
commission of the offence which squarely falls within
the prohibitory clause of section 497(1) Cr.P.C and
thus I hold him disentitled to bail. Accordingly, this
bail petition stands dismissed.

Before parting with this order, it is
directed that any observations recorded in this order
are keeping in view the arguments advanced by the
learned counsel for the petitioner and are thus purely
tentative in nature and shall accordingly in no way
prejudice the proceedings before the learned trial Court
where the case be decided on its own merits after
recording evidence.
