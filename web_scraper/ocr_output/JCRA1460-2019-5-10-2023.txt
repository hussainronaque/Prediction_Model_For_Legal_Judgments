JUDGMENT
ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- This jail criminal appeal,

filed by Zahoor son of Atlas Khan, the appellant, is
directed against the judgment dated 12.11.2019
(“impugned judgment), passed by learned Additional
Sessions Judge-VI Nowshera (Trial Court) whereby
he having found the appellant guilty of committing
murder of his father, namely, Atlas Khan, brother,
namely, Fagir Hussain and minor nephew and niece,
namely, Nisar Hussain and Mst. Manahil, respectively,
and an attempt to commit Qatl-e-Amd of complainant
Mst. Saira and other inmates of the house, has been
convicted and sentenced, in case FIR No.117 dated
17.04.2017, registered under sections 302 and 324 PPC

at Police Station Akbar Pura, as under:-
Under Section 302 (b) PPC:- To death on
four counts as Ta’azir and to pay
Rs.2,00,000/-, as compensation to legal heirs
of each deceased and in default thereof to
further undergo six months simple
imprisonment.

Under Section 324 PPC. To undergo

imprisonment for five years on three counts
and to pay Rs.50,000/- as compensation to
victims under section 544-A Cr.P.C. and in
default thereof to further undergo six months
simple imprisonment.

Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C.
has been extended to the appellant.

2. The learned trial Court has sent Murder

Reference No.42-P_of 2019, under section 374

CrP.C., for confirmation of death sentences of the
convict. As both the matters are the outcome of one
and the same judgment of the learned trial court,
therefore, we propose to decide and answer the same
through this common judgment.

3. The prosecution’s case as per First
Information Report (“FIR”) Exh.PA is that on
17.04.2017 at 0300 hours Mst. Saira complainant
(PW.6), in company of Mst. Bakht Zari, her mother-in-
law, reported to Murad Khan ASI (PW.3), in DHQ
Hospital Pabbi, to the effect that on the fateful night of
17.04.2017, she along with her mother-in-law,
father-in-law, namely, Atlas Khan, husband, namely,

Faqir Hussain, minor daughter Manahil, minor son
Nisar, brothers-in-law, namely, Arshad Khan (PW.7)
and Zahoor (the appellant) was present in her house,
situated in village Balu; that there was an oral
altercation between appellant Zahoor and his father
Atlas Khan over a house which the appellant was
intending to sell and his father was preventing him;
that at 0040 hours the appellant entered his room,
picked up a Kalashnikov and opened fire at them, as a
result, her father-in-law Atlas Khan, minor sons Nisar
Hussain and daughter Manhil got hit and died at the
spot whereas her husband Fagir Hussain sustained
firearm injuries; that she, her mother-in-law
Mst. Bakht Zari and brother-in-law, Arshad (PW.7),
luckily remained unscathed; that her injured husband
was shifted by Arshad (PW.7) to LRH Peshawar but he
succumbed to injuries. Motive behind the occurrence
was a dispute over a house which the appellant was
intending to sell. Report of the complainant was
reduced into writing by Murad Khan ASI (PW.3) in
the shape of Murasila Exh.PA on the basis of which
FIR Exh.PA was registered against the appellant. He
prepared injury sheets and inquest reports of Atlas
Khan, Nisar Hussan and Manahil deceased which are
Exh.PW.5/1 to Exh.PW.5/6, respectively. He shifted
the dead bodies of the deceased to the mortuary where

Dr. Mian Saad Ahmed (PW.9), Dr. Asghar Ullah Khan
(PW.10) and Dr. Malghalara Khan (PW.11), conducted
autopsy and opined the cause of death of the deceased
due to firearm injuries.

4. Abdul Azeem Khan SI (PW.12) conducted
investigation in the case, who on receipt of copy of
FIR, proceeded to the spot and prepared site plan
Exh.PW.12/1. During spot inspection he took into
possession blood through cotton from the places of the
four deceased through recovery memos Exh.PW.7/1 to
Exh.PW.7/4. Vide recovery memo Exh.PW.7/5 he
took into possession 22 empties of 7.62 bore from the
place of the appellant Exh.P.5. Similarly, vide
recovery memos Exh.PW.7/6 to Exh.PW.7/9 he took
into possession the last worn bloodstained garments of
the four deceased and sealed the same into parcel. He
also took into possession one electric bulb of 100 volt
Exh.P.10 from the crime spot. He sent the bloodstained
clothes of the deceased along with blood secured from
the spot to the FSL reports whereof are Exh.PW.12/3
to Exh.PW.12/10. Vide application Exh.PW.12/7 he
sent 22 empties of 7.62 bore to the FSL. The appellant
was arrested by SHO and handed over to Abdul
Azeem Khan SI (PW.12), who obtained his physical
remand from competent court and took into possession
the Kalashnikov recovered from the appellant at the

time of his arrest by SHO bearing No.EA.6397
Exh.P.11 vide recovery memo Exh.PW.5/1. He sent
the Kalashnikov and 22 empties of 7.62 bore to FSL
for examination and produced PWs Mst. Bakht Zari
and Arshad for recording their statements under
section 164 Cr.P.C. before the Magistrate.

5. On completion of investigation challan was
submitted against the appellant before the learned trial
Court, where he was formally charge sheeted to which
he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To prove its
case, the prosecution examined as many as twelve
witnesses. After closure of the prosecution’s evidence,
statement of the appellant was recorded under section
342 Cr.P.C., wherein he denied the prosecution’s
allegation and professed his innocence. He, however,
neither wished to be examined on oath under section
340(2) Cr.P.C. or to produce evidence in defence. On
conclusion of trial, the learned trial court, after hearing
both the sides convicted and sentenced the appellant as
mentioned in the initial paragraph of the judgment,
hence, this appeal and Murder Reference.

6. We have heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the parties and perused the evidence and
record with their valuable assistance.

7. The untoward incident of murder of four
persons of one and the same family has taken place on

the night of 17.04.2017 at 0040 hours inside the house
of complainant Mst. Saria (PW.6), situated in village
Balu, for which the appellant is directly and singularly
charged in the FIR. It is borne out from the record that
appellant was also residing in the same house jointly
with the deceased because Atlas Khan deceased was
father, Faqir Hussain deceased was brother and minor
Nisar Hussain and Manahil deceased were the nephew
and niece, respectively, of the appellant. The ocular
account of this unfortunate incident has been furnished
by complainant Mst. Saira who while appearing as

PW.6 has deposed as under:-
“That deceased Atlas Khan was my father-in-
law; deceased minor Nisar Hussain was my son
and deceased Manahi! was my daughter while
deceased Faqir Hussain was my husband.
Accused Zahoor is my husband’s brother while
PW Arshad is also my husband’s brother. On
the night of occurrence at about mid night, I
along with my mother-in-law, namely,
Mst. Bakht Zari, my father-in-law, namely,
Atlas Khan, my husband Fagir Hussain, my
children Nisar Hussan and Mst. Manahil as well
Arshad Khan my husband’s brother were
present in the house. Accused Zahoor made
altercation with my deceased father-in-law and
husband regarding the dispute over his share in
the house. The accused brought a Kalashnikov

at about 0040 hours (midnight) and made
indiscriminate firing at us, as a result of which

my father-in-law Atlas Khan, my minor children

Nisar Hussan and Manahil got hit and died on

the spot while my husband got hit and received

injuries while we escaped narrowly. We shifted

the dead bodies to Pubbi hospital while my

husband Faqir Hussain in injured condition was

taken to LRH Peshawar who succumbed to

injuries at LRH, Peshawar. The local police

recorded my report in Pabbi hospital already

Exh.PA while my mother-in-law Mst. Bakht

Zari verified the report and thumb impressed the

same. My report was read over to me and the

Murasila Exh.PA correctly bears my thumb

impression. Later on, police came to the spot

and prepared the site plan at my pointation. |

charge the accused for commission of offence.”
Similarly, Arshad Khan, who is the real brother of the
appellant while appearing as PW.7 has also furnished
ocular account of the incident in the following words:-

“That deceased Atlas Khan was my father,

deceased minor Nisar Hussain was my nephew

and deceased minor Manahil was my niece

while deceased Faqir Hussain was my brother.

Accused facing trial is also my brother while

Mst. Saira (complainant) is the widow of my

deceased brother Faqir Hussain. On the night of

occurrence at about mid-night, I along with my

mother, namely, Mst. Bakht Zari, my father,

namely, Atlas Khan and brother, Faqir Hussain,
children Nisar Hussain and Mst. Manahil of my
deceased brother, namely, Faqir Hussain and
complainant Mst. Saira were present in the
house. Accused facing trial made altercation
with my deceased father and brother regarding
the dispute over his share in the house and then
the accused brought Kalashnikov at about 0040
hours (midnight) and made indiscriminate firing
at us, as a result of which, my father Atlas
Khan, minor children of my brother, namely,
Nisar Hussain and Manahil got hit and died on
the spot while my brother Faqir Hussain also got
hit and received injuries while we escaped
narrowly. We shifted the dead bodies to Pabbi
hospital while I took my brother Faqir Hussain
in injured condition to LRH Peshawar where he
succumbed to injuries. The complainant had
made report in Pabbi hospital regarding the
occurrence. Afterward I also returned home
along with dead body of my brother Faqir
Hussain. In the meanwhile, the I.O. reached the
spot and in my presence he recovered and took
into possession some blood through cotton from
the places of the deceased and sealed the same
into parcels. ...”

8. Eyewitness Arshad (PW.7) is real brother of
the appellant and Mst. Saira (PW.6), is his
sister-in-law (Bhabi). Both have been subjected to

cross-examination, but nothing favourable to defence
or adverse to prosecution could be brought from their
mouths. Both have furnished truthful ocular account of
the occurrence and have proved their presence at the
spot at the time of occurrence. Appellant and the
eyewitnesses being inmates of one and the same house,
their presence at the spot at the night of incident is
quite natural and appealable to a prudent mind.
Eyewitnesses and the appellant being members of one
family coupled with altercation prior to the occurrence,
question of mistaken identity does not arise. Nothing
in black & white is available on file to remotely
suggest false implication or substitution of the
appellant. It does not appeal to a prudent mind that
eyewitnesses who had already lost their four beloved
will falsely implicate another innocent member of their
own family, that too, for four murders. During spot
inspection, the Investigation Officer has secured blood
through cotton from the places of four deceased
Exh.P.1 to Exh.P.4 vide recovery memo Exh.PW.7/1
to Exh.PW.7/4, respectively, in presence of marginal
witnesses which along with the bloodstained garments
of the deceased Exh.P.6 to Exh.P.9 were sent to the
FSL, and in this regard Serologist Reports
Exh.PW.12/19, Exhs.PW.12/2, Exh.PW.12/3 and
Exh.PW.12/4 are in positive. This piece of

circumstantial evidence strongly corroborate the ocular
10

account and confirms the crime spot to be the same as
alleged by the eyewitnesses. Similarly, during spot
inspection, the Investigating Officer has collected 22
crime empties of 7.62 bore Exh.P.5 vide recovery
memo Exh.PW.7/5. On 17.04.2017, the appellant was
arrested by Muhammad Fiaz Inspector (PW.1), and
from his possession a Kalashnikov bearing No.6397
along with 16 live rounds of the same bore was
recovered vide recovery memo Exh.Pw.1/1, In this
regard he registered separate case FIR No.118 dated
17.04.2017 under section 15 KP Arms Act 2013 in
Police Station Akbarpura against the appellant. The
recovered Kalashnikov along with 22 empties of 7.62
bore were sent to the FSL and as per to FSL report
Exh.PW.12/20, 22 empties taken from the spot, have
fired from the same Kalashnikov. This strong piece of
circumstantial evidence further corroborates the ocular
account of the prosecution’s case.

9. Medical evidence furnished by Dr. Mian
Saad Ahmed (PW.9), Dr. Asghar Ullah Khan (PW.10)
and Dr. Malghalara Khan (PW.11), who have
conducted autopsy on the dead bodies of the four
deceased also support the ocular account of the
prosecution’s case. According to statements of the
Medical Officers, the four deceased met their unnatural

death due to firearm injuries.
11

10. In view of the above discussion, we have
arrived at a conclusion that prosecution has proved
guilt of the appellant through cogent, confidence
inspiring and trustworthy ocular account corroborated
by strong circumstantial evidence and supported by
medical evidence. The learned trial court while
appreciating the prosecution’s evidence in its true
perspective has arrived to a right conclusion by
holding the appellant guilty of committing murder of
his father, brother, minor nephew and niece with
firearm. However, in view of the new development
occurred before this court during pendency of the
instant appeal sentence of the appellant under section
302(b) PPC requires consideration.

11. On 13.10.2020, learned counsel for the
appellant apprised the court that compromise has been
effected between the appellant and legal heirs of all the
four deceased. Accordingly, record of the case was
sent to the learned trial court with direction to record
statements of legal heirs of the deceased and after
fulfilling legal formalities of the compromise to submit
compliance report. In compliance of the order (ibid),
the learned trial court has submitted report, according
to which major legal heirs of all the deceased have
effected compromise with the appellant on their behalf

as well as on behalf of the minor legal heirs, however,
12

appellant is unable to pay share in Diyat to the extent
of Yahya minor son of Fagir Hussain deceased. On
07.06.2023, learned counsel for the appellant requested
for time to make efforts for depositing share of minor
Yahya and also to go through PLD 2019 Supreme
Court 461. On 05.09.2023, learned counsel for the
appellant pointed out that appellant being a destitute is
unable to pay/deposit share of minor legal heir of Faqir
Hussain deceased, however, requested for acquittal of
the appellant on the basis of partial compromise.
Keeping in view gravity of the offence wherein
appellant is charged for committing murder of his
father, brother and minor nephew and nice coupled
with partial compromise, this court deemed it
appropriate and in the interest of justice to hear learned
counsel for the appellant and Mr. Jalal ud Din Akbar-
e-Azam Khan Gara AAG on the point of partial
compromise and its effect on the case of the appellant.
Barrister Amir Khan Chamkani was appointed as
Amicus Curiae to assist the court on the aforesaid legal
point.

12. Arguments of learned counsel for the
parties, worthy AAG for the State and learned Amicus
Curiae, on the point of partial compromise and its

effect on the case of the appellant heard and the
13

precedent law referred by the worthy Amicus Curiae
gone through.

13, It is not disputed that this case is a case of
punishment under Za’zir and not Qisas because the
proof required for a case of Qisas in terms of Section
304 PPC has not been produced before the trial court.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled,

“Muhammad Yousaf vs the State and others” (PLD
2019 Supreme Court 461) in paragraph No.7 of the
judgment has held that “A criminal case becomes a
case of Qisas when, after the case has reached the trial
court, either the accused makes a confession before the
trial court during trial or Tazkiya tul Shahood is
undertaken by the trial court and unless either of the
said two things happen before the trial court every
criminal case is to be treated as a case of Ta’azir at
every stage of the case including the stage of
investigation. Compounding of offences in cases of
Ta’azir is governed by section 345 Cr.P.C. and
according to section 345(2) Cr.P.C. the offence of qail-
i-amd under section 302 PPC could be compounded.
with the permission of the relevant court. “By the heirs
of the victim other than the accused or the convict if
the offence has been committed by him in the name or
on the pretext of karo kari, siyah kari or similar other

customs or practices.” The said legal provision was
14

amended on 21.10.2016 and it presently reads as “By
the heirs of the victim subject to the provisions of
section 311 PPC.” According to law in this country
succession opens at the time of death of a person and
upon his death his assets automatically stand devolved
upon those who are entitled to inherit from him in
specified shares in terms of his personal law and such
inheriting persons are called the heirs of the deceased.
There is thus, no confusion in our law that an heir is a
person who is entitled to inherit from the deceased at
the time of his death. In view of this settled and
recognized principle when the law of the land provides
that in a case of Ta’azir an offence of Qatl-i-amd
under section 302 PPC may be compounded by the
“heirs of the victim”? and by section 345(2) Cr.P.C. is
that only a person who can directly inherit from the
victim is the person who can compound the offence of
Qatl-e-Amd of the victim and none else. Similarly, in
case of “Zahid Rehman vs the State” (PLD 2015 SC
77), the Hon’ble Apex court has dealt with the matter
of compromise in cases of Qisas and Tazir. Relevant
parts of the judgments are reproduced below:-

“There are certain other issues relevant to cases

of Qisas and Tazir and I take this opportunity
to clarify the legal position in respect of such

issues as well. The matter of compromise in
15

cases of murder has also remained subject of
some controversy before this court in the past
but the legal position in that respect has now
been settled and I would like to restate the
settled legal position so as to remove all
doubts. Sections 309, 310 and 338-E PPC and
section 345 Cr.P.C are relevant in this respect

and the same are reproduced below:-

This court has already declared that
section 309 PPC pertaining to waiver (Afw)
and section 310 PPC pertaining to
compounding (Sulh) in cases of murder are

relevant only to cases of Oisas_ and not _to
cases of Ta’zir and a reference in this respect
may be made to the case of Sh. Muhammad
Aslam and another Vs Shaukat Ali alias
Shaukat and others (1997 SCMR 1307), Niaz
Ahmad Vs the State (PLD 2003 SC 635) and
Abdul Jabbar vs the State and others (2007
SCMR 1496). In the said cases _it_has also
been clarified by this court that _in cases 9
Ta’zir the matter of compromise between the
parties is governed _and regulated by the
provisions of section 345(2) Cr.P.C. read with
section 338-E PPC. In the same cases it has
further been explained and clarified by this
court _that_a_partial_compromise_may_be
acceptable_in cases of Qisas_but_a_parti

compromise_is_not acceptable_in_cases_of

Ta’azir. The cases of Manzoor Hussain and 4
others vs the State (1994 SCMR 1327),
Muhammad Saleem Vs the State (PLD 2003
SC 512), Muhammad Arshad alias Pappu vs
Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore and 3 others
(PLD 2003 SC 512), Muhammad Ahmad Vs
the State (PLD 2003 SC 635), Riaz Ahmad Vs
16

the State (2003 SCMR 1067), Bashir Ahmad vs
the State and another (2004 SCMR 236) and
Khan Muhammad Vs the State (2005 SCMR
599) also throw sufficient light on such aspects
relating to the matter of compromise. It may be
true that compounding of an offence falling in
chapter XVI of the Pakistan penal Code is
permissible under some conditions both in
cases of Qisas as well as Tazir, but at the same
time it is equally true that such compounding is
regulated by separate and distinct provisions
and that such limited common ground between
the two does not obliterate the clear distinction
otherwise existing between the two separate
legal regimes.”

14. As the instant case is a case of Ta’azir,
where compromise has been effected between the
appellant and legal heirs of the deceased, that too,
during pendency of the appeal, therefore, in light of
ratio of judgment (supra) the instant case is to be dealt
with in light of the mandate of section 338-E PPC,
which for the sake of convenience and ready reference

is reproduced below:-

“338-E, Waiver or__compounding of
offences (1) Subject to the provision of this
Chapter and section 345 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1989 (V of 1898) all
offences under this Chapter may be waived or
compounded and the provisions of sections
309, 310 and 311 shall, mutatis mutandis,
apply to the waiver or compounding of such
offences.

Provided that, where_an offence
has been waived or compounded, the court
may in its discretion having regard to the
17

facts and circumstances of the case, acquit or
award tazir to the offender according to the

nature of the offence.
Provided further that where an

offence under this Chapter has been
committed and the principle of Fasad- fil-Arz
is attracted, the court having regard to the
facts _and_circumstances of the case shall
punish_an_offender with imprisonment or
fine as provided for that offence.

(2) All questions relating to waiver or
compounding of an offence or awarding of
punishment under section 310, whether before
or after the passing of any sentence, shall be
determined by the trial court.

Provided that where the sentence of
Qisas or any other sentence is waived or
compounded during the pendency of an
appeal, such question may be determined by
the Appellant Court.

Provided further that where qatl-i-
amd or any other offence under this Chapter
has been committed as an honour crime, such
offence shall not be waived or compounded
without consent of the court and subject to
such conditions as the court may deem fit
having regard to the facts and circumstances
of the case.”

15. In light of the evidence discussed above, we
have arrived at the conclusion that prosecution has
proved that appellant has committed murder of his
father, brother, minor nephew and niece, therefore, it is
a case where the provision of 3" proviso to section
338-E PPC (pertaining to Fasad fil Arz) are attracted.

Resultantly, we are not convinced to acquit the
18

accused on the basis of partial compromise, rather are
going to deal with his case under section 338-E PPC.

16. In case titled, “Muhammad Amin vs the

State” (2016 SCMR 116), the Hon’ble Supreme Court
while dealing with the matter of compromise in case of
Tazir, has observed as under:-

“Leave to appeal had been granted in this case

only to consider the question regarding
quantum of _appellant’s sentence. After
hearing the learned counsel for the parties and
going through the record we have observed
that according to FIR itself the appellant had
not straightaway launched an assault upon
Mst. Kalsoom Bibi deceased and the assault
launched by him was preceded by an
altercation and exchange of abuses at the spot
which showed that the situation had taken an
ugly turn at the spot in the absence of any
premeditation on the part of the appellant. The
record of the case further shows that
Muhammad Mehboob complainant, husband
of Mst. Kalsoom Bibi deceased was not an
eyewitness of the occurrence and according to
the FIR he had been informed about the
incident in issue by Muhammad Yaqoob
(CW1) but during trial the said Muhammad
Yaqoob (CW1) had contradicted the
complainant in that regard and had maintained

that he had not seen the occurrence at all.
19

Another factor having some bearing upon the
question of appellant’s sentence is that the
husband of the deceased, on his own behalf as
well as on behalf of the minor children of the
deceased, had forgiven the appellant and had
entered into a compromise with him which
compromise was not given effect by the courts
below because the compromise was
incomplete. Jt has been clarified by this court
in case of Abdul Ghaffar and others Vs the
State (2015_SCMR_ 1064) that _a_partial
compromise may not have any bearing upon
conviction of an accused person in a case of
Tazir but it may have, in circumstances of a
given case, some relevance to the question of

sentence_in_such_a_case. In_the_ above
mentioned circumstances _of this _case_we
have felt persuaded to reduce the appellant's
sentence of death to imprisonment for life on

the charge under section 302 (b) PPC. This

appeal is, therefore, dismissed to the extent of
the appellant’s conviction for an offence under
section 302(b) PPC recorded and upheld by
the courts below but the same is partly
allowed to the extent of appellant’s sentence
which is reduced from death to imprisonment
for life.” (Bold and underlines are ours for
emphasis).

In cases titled, “Jmran Shah Vs the State” (2003 P Cr.

LJ 760), and “Muhammad Ameer and another vs the
20

State” (2006 _P Cr LJ 1483), the worthy Lahore High
Court, Lahore, has reduced/converted the sentence of
death to imprisonment for life in cases of Tazir, on
account of partial compromise.

17. Deriving wisdom from the judgments
(supra) of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and the august
Lahore High Court, Lahore and placing reliance
thereon, in the instant case too, besides partial
compromise the occurrence has taken place without
premeditation. Admittedly, there was an oral
altercation between the appellant and bis father Atlas
Khan deceased and brother Faqir Hussain deceased
over selling of a house. During altercation the situation
took an ugly turn and the appellant in a heat of passion
rushed to his room, picked up a Kalashnikov and
opened indiscriminate firing, as a result, not only his
father and brother but also his minor nephew and niece
got hit and lost their lives. Thus, we while taking the
partial compromise and mode and manner of the
occurrence taken place without premeditation as a
mitigating circumstance, dismiss this appeal to the
extent of the appellant’s conviction, however,
reduce/convert his sentence from death on four counts,
recorded by learned Addi. Sessions Judge-VI, Nowshera
vide judgment dated 12.11.2019, to rigorous

imprisonment for life on four counts. Conviction and
21

sentences of the appellant under section 324 PPC are
maintained. The sentence of fine under sections 324
PPC and compensation amount under section 544-A
Cr.P.C. and period of imprisonment in default of
payment thereof as directed by the learned trial court
are kept intact. All the substantive sentences of
imprisonment shall run concurrently. Benefit of
section 382-B Cr.P.C. is extended to the appellant.
Accordingly, Murder Reference No.42_of 2019 is
answered in the Negative.
18. These are the reasons for our short order of
even date, which is reproduced below:-

“For reasons to be recorded later, this

Jail Criminal Appeal, filed by the Zahoor

son of Atlas Khan, the appellant, stands

dismissed in the terms that his conviction

and sentences recorded under section 324

PPC by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge-

VI, Nowshera vide judgment dated

12.11.2019, are maintained. Similarly, his

conviction under section 302 (b) PPC is

also maintained, however, his sentence

under the said section of law is converted

from death penalty on four counts to

rigorous imprisonment for life on four

counts. All the substantive sentences shall

run concurrently. Accordingly, Murder

22

Reference No.42 of 2019 is answered in

the Negative.
