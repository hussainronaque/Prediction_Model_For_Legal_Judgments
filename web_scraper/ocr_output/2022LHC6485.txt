enticing had taken Shahid Sharif to the Dera’* of Abdul
Ghaffar (appellant) where Abdul Ghaffar, Muhammad Bilal
(real bothers) and Muhammad Irfan Haider were already
present; all they committed sodomy one by one with Shahid
Sharif; on his hue and cry, Nawaz Sharif (Pw-3) and Ghulam
Haider (not produced) arrived there and rescued Shahid Sharif;
on resistance, Muhammad Bilal having a Churi’ gave an
injury on the thumb of left hand of Shahid Sharif whereas
Ikram-ul-Haq caused an injury with brick on small finger of
his left hand; Abdul Ghaffar placed him under fear by aiming
with the pistol; during the occurrence appellants also captured
the incident through a video.

5. On the basis of above application, FIR (PN) was

recorded by Iftikhar Ali ASI‘ (Pw-9).

6. On arrest of appellants, report’? under Section 173
Cr.P.C was summitted in court.

7. Initially, on 22" of June 2018, a charge was framed
against Ikram-ul-Haq, Abdul Ghaffar and Muhammad Irfan
Haider however later on, when Muhammad Bilal came in
picture, an amended charge on 22" of October, 2018 against
all appellants under Sections 367A/377/337F(v)337L(Gi) PPC
was framed, which they pleaded not guilty and demanded the
trial.

8. In order to prove its’ case prosecution had produced

learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor had closed the
prosecution’s evidence.

10. In their examinations made under Section 342 Cr.P.C,
appellants pleaded their false implications and opted not to
produce defence evidence or to appear as witnesses in terms of
Section 340(2) Cr.P.C.

12. Prosecution claims that Nawaz Sharif (Pw-3), the real
brother of victim, is also an eye witness but the position is
otherwise for the reason that according to his own statement,
he did not see the occurrence and when he arrived at crime
scene, the episode was over and disclosed to him by his brother
Shahid Sharif. However, he added that in his presence
appellants had succeeded to escape from venue of offences.

13.  Perusal of declaration of Nawaz Sharif (Pw-3) further

reveals that he is a chance witness. Amongst the various and

known kinds of witnesses?2, one is called ‘Chance Witness’
that means: -

> Aperson who, by coincidence or accidently, is
present at the scene of crime’.

> A person who in ordinary circumstances has
not to be present, where he claims to be.

> Aperson who in view of his place of residence
or occupation and in the ordinary course of
events is not supposed to be present at the
place of the occurrence but states to be there
by chance.

14. Under the settled principles of law statement of a
Chance Witness requires scrutiny with great care and caution
and can be accepted only if he gives satisfactory explanation of
his presence at or near the place of the occurrence at the
relevant time otherwise his testimony is liable to be rejected
straightaway?’.

15. It is not a disputed fact that residence of Nawaz Sharif
(Pw-3) was at a distance of about two Kilometers from place of
occurrence. He claimed that on the crime day he came to a
shrine near to venue of occurrence. His explanation to visit the
shrine is not logical, reasonable, convincing and acceptable
and does not appeal to mind for a simple reason that he was a
shopkeeper in the village which he used to open at 06:00 am
and to close in late night. It was not his case, that on the
relevant day there was any special event at the shrine and due
to that cause, while closing his shop, he went there.

16. His presence has also been negated because of his
unnatural conduct. His junior brother aged 14 years was
committed to sodomy by four persons, who all at the time of
his arrival were present but he made no effort to apprehend any
of the them, despite the fact that he was also a young man aged
25 years and was in a position to make resistance to some
extent.

17. Muhammad Sharif (Pw-2) father of victim admittedly is
not an eye witness of the occurrence who reported the matter to
police on the disclosure made by his son Shahid Sharif.

18. In view of above circumstances, this is a case of sole
witness. No doubt that testimony of solitary witness can be
accepted by following the principles of quality and not the

quantity and can be a foundation for conviction alone but if

found trustworthy, suffering from no infirmity and inherent
defects. Fact remains that criteria for assigning the sole witness
stamp of truth, certainly depends on facts and circumstances of
each case??.

19. Occurrence took place on 06" of April, 2018 at about
12:00 noon and first time the door of the police Authorities
was knocked by Muhammad Sharif/complainant after four
days that was 10" of April, 2018 at about 07:45 pm. There is
no universal principle that every delayed FIR shall defeat the
prosecution and at the same time the prompt FIR has to be
followed blindly. The reasons and explanations in case of
delayed FIR always play an important role and cannot be taken
lightly if the allegations are serious and heinous in nature So
the effect on prosecution’s case because of delay in FIR has to

be seen considering the special features of each case”. In Asia

Bibi’s case*“ the apex Court on the question of five days delay
in reporting the matter to police was pleased to hold as under: -

“There is no cavil to the proposition, however, it is to
be noted that in absence of any plausible explanation,
this Court has always considered the delay in lodging
of FIR to be fatal and castes a suspicion on the
prosecution story, extending the benefit of doubt to
the accused. It has been held by this Court that a FIR
is always treated as a cornerstone of the prosecution
case to establish guilt against those involved in a
crime; thus, it has a significant role to play. If there is
any delay in lodging of a FIR and commencement of
investigation, it gives rise to a doubt, which, of
course, cannot be extended to anyone else except to
the accused”

20. Coming to the case in hand, while explaining the reasons
for delay in FIR, Muhammad Sharif (Pw-2) maintained that he

was restrained by the persons of locality to approach the

police. But who those persons were, that is a mystery even
today? It was the duty of complainant to produce any of those
fellows, either before the Investigating Officer or the court but
no such effort was made at any stage, therefore, in the given
circumstances this serious inherent defect cannot be ignored.
21. For the sake of arguments if the explanation in FIR is
taken as correct, it was the duty of complainant to be consistent
and firm and to stand on the same reasons but when he
attended the witness box, he in his examination-in-chief, while
deviating from earlier referred explanation stated that: -

“Feeling humiliation and insult I kept quiet for
four days and on 10.04.2018 I moved an
application Exh.PA to the SHO for registration
of case”

22. Therefore, summing up this area of discussions, it is
held the delay in reporting the matter to police is definitely
damaging and fatal to prosecution.

23. It was the case of prosecution that the incident was
captured through a video and for that reliance was made on the
photographs (P1/1-13) stated to be retrieved from the mobile
phone recovered from the possession of Ikram-ul-Haq
(appellant). To detail this dimension, it was stated that on 16" of
April, 2018 when Ikram-ul-Haq was arrested, from his
possession a mobile phone was recovered and secured vide an
inventory.

24. As the snaps were alleged to be retrieved from the
mobile phone of Ikram-ul-Haq, therefore, it was the duty of
prosecution to establish its’ safe custody. In the light of
principles”? laid down by apex Court, it is understood that the

question of chain of safe custody is confined only to the cases

of narcotics. This Court in Muhammad Hamza’s case*® while

extending the scope of said principles had observed as under:

“The principles of ‘safe custody’ and ‘chain of safe
custody’ do not confine to any specific case or
situation but in every case where prosecution
demands conviction against an offender on the basis
of any material that constitutes an offence like hand
grenade as in the case in hand, bombs, explosive
materials, narcotics, arms and ammunitions etc. these
principles shall be strictly adhered to and cannot be
compromised under any circumstance. There is a
difference between ‘safe custody’ and ‘chain safe
custody’. ‘Safe custody’ means, if the case property is
with any official/individual that has to be in
accordance and under an authority of law or at a
secured place like ‘Malkhana’ where access has to be
under a specified procedure and law. Whereas ‘chain
of safe custody’ means that if case property is
transferred or transmitted from one place to other
place or from one official to other official, such
transmission has also to be under a recognized
method. Therefore, prosecution has to establish and
prove both ‘safe custody’ and ‘chain of safe custody’
side by side and if any of the links of chain is broken
the conviction cannot be recorded or if recorded
cannot ordered to be sustained”

25. According to Iftikhar Ali ASI (Pw-9) after the recovery
of mobile phone, it was handed over to Rafaqat Ali (Pw-8) a
private person of Jatala Mobiles and on his (ASI) request said
Rafaqat Ali retrieved the photographs which were taken into
possession on 21* of April, 2018. It is not understandable that
under what authority of law, Iftikhar Ali ASI handed over the
mobile phone to a private person despite the fact that the
required exercise had to be taken by government forensic
agency and none-else. From 16" to 21% of April, 2018 the
mobile phone remained in the personal custody of Rafaqat Ali
(Pw-8) which under no situation can be considered as a lawful

or safe custody. What he had been doing with the said mobile

Muhammad Hamza & another Vs. The State & another (Criminal Appeal No. 907 of 2017 decided on 14.04.2022) {approved for
reporting (https://sys.lhc.gov.pk/appjudgments/2022LHC2827 pdf)
Criminal Appeal No.344 of 2019 9
Criminal Appeal No.365 of 2019

during this period, no body knows. It is important to add here
that Rafaqat Ali (Pw-8) is the witness who had direct conflict
with the first cousin of Ikram-ul-Haq (appellant) which fact he
had admitted in the process of cross-examination.

26. Prosecution in this context is also in serious
contradictions. As mentioned earlier, version of Iftikhar Ali
ASI was that he handed over the mobile to Rafaqat Ali on 16"
of April, 2018 but when Ahsan Umair Constable (Pw-6) came
forward he maintained that mobile phone was given to Rafaqat
Ali on 21.04.2018 and on the same date photographs were
retrieved and taken into possession. Therefore, again a serious
uncertainty is there that during this period whether the mobile
phone remained in the custody of Iftikhar Ali ASI or Rafaqat
Ali? Prosecution is lack of any material to explain it.

27. Finally, the mobile phone was deposited in the office of
PFSA on 30" of May, 2018 as evident from the report (PU).
Even here, prosecution was under heavy responsibility to
establish that from 21° of April, 2018 to 29" of May, 2018
(period of more than a month) the mobile phone was in official and
lawful custody. Even in this regard, prosecution is at defeating
end. Iftikhar Ali ASI (Pw-9) never stated that he ever handed
over the said mobile to Muhammad Nawaz HC/Moharrar. The
declaration of Muhammad Nawaz HC/Moharrar is also
completely silent that he ever received said mobile phone
during the entire investigation or he ever kept in Malkhana in
safe custody or he ever handed over the same of Iftikhar Ali
ASI for transmission to the office of PFSA.

28. The report of PFSA is also not significant. It shows that
40 pictures were there in the mobile but no video at all. About
the genuineness of the pictures, it was observed that: -

“To opine about the genuineness of pictures is
beyond the scope of SOPs of Audio Visual
Criminal Appeal No.344 of 2019 10
Criminal Appeal No.365 of 2019

Analysis Department, Punjab Forensic Science

Agency”

29. Although pictures retrieved from the mobile phone have
lost legal value thereof, but for the sake of complete justice I
have also examined the same. All the pictures are so blur that it
is difficult to identify any person. However, in two pictures
only it can be seen that one person is committing sodomy with
another and the passive also appears to be calm and cool.

30. Finally, coming to the medical evidence, Dr. Zeeshan
Ahmad (Pw-4) on 10" of April, 2018 at about 07:30 pm had
conducted the medical examination of Shahid Sharif (Pw-1). He
observed two lacerations on 3’o clock and 6’o0 clock positions
with no dilated anal sphincter. He did not find any mark of
violence or resistance on any part of the body of the victim. He
observed the stitched incised wound on the left thumb and a
blackish bruise on the right finger of the victim. The statement
of doctor clearly indicates that earlier the victim was medically
examined but from where that is still in dark. The two injuries
on hand are also not significant for the reason that Shahid
Sharif was running a shop of Chicken in the village, therefore,
said minor injuries could be possible in routine.

31. Four days’ delay in medical examination again is a
destructive point to the prosecution in particular when the
DNA reports (PS and PT) are negative as according to the
expert no seminal material was detected on the tested evidence.
32. This Court in Muhammad Hamza case (ibid) on the
principles of appreciation of evidence had observed as under: -

“Appreciation of evidence which may be direct or
circumstantial is a delicate exercise that involves
weighing the credibility and reliability of the
incriminating material presented in a case and on
conclusion thereof it must present a good picture that
has to be accurate on all counts, with good
composition, exposure, focus, light, and timing. In a
Criminal Appeal No.344 of 2019 11
Criminal Appeal No.365 of 2019

criminal case as the question of life and liberty of an
accused is at stake therefore under the settled
principles of law a strict standard of proof is required
so as to prove the guilt which cannot base on
preponderance of probabilities but it must be proved
beyond reasonable doubt. The words ‘beyond
reasonable doubt’ mean that the prosecution must
convince the court that there is no other reasonable
outcome of the evidence produced in trial except the
conviction of accused.

The prosecution case presented in the court must be
true. There is also a difference between the words
‘may be true’ and ‘must be true’ and between these
two phrases there is a long distance that has to be
covered by legal, reliable and unimpeachable
evidence. So for seeking the conviction against an

>”

accused prosecution evidence ‘must be true’.

33. In legal proceeding, there are two basics burdens called
‘the legal burden’ and ‘the evidential burden’. The ‘legal
burden’ is the obligation on a party to prove what it has
alleged. In criminal proceedings, it is the prosecution who has
the legal burden of proving all the elements of offence or
offences and certainly beyond reasonable doubt. Whether
prosecution is successful or at the defeating end while
discharging the said duty, it is to be decided by the court at the
end of trial.

34. Whereas, the ‘evidential burden’is the duty of
prosecution to adduce sufficient, reliable, convincing and
conclusive evidence against the accused so as to get favorable
findings from the court. The discharge of evidential burden
will not lead to discharge the legal burden as both have to hit

the bull’s eye?” simultaneously. Therefore by now these are

the settled principles?? of law that: -

> Conviction cannot be based merely on the high
probabilities that may be inferred from evidence
in a given case.

Finding of the guilt should rest surely and firmly
on the evidence produced by the prosecution.
Mere conjectures and probabilities cannot take
the place of legal proof otherwise the golden rule
of benefit of doubt will be reduced to naught.
Accused is only to create doubt in prosecution’s
case.

It is the duty of prosecution to prove its case
beyond reasonable doubt.

Benefit of every reasonable doubt must go to the
accused.

Benefit of doubt however slight must go to the
accused.

Single infirmity in prosecution’s case will entitle
the accused to benefit of doubt.

Court is not supposed to thumb mark blindly what
the prosecution has desired.

Rule of law is the supreme consideration and
nothing is top to it. A Judge is only to be
impressed when “burden of persuasion” is
successfully discharged which means to convince
the court that qualitative evidence is there.

35. The ultimate and only outcome of the discussions,

deliberations and analyses made above is that prosecution had

badly failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt against

all the appellants Ikram-ul-Haq, Abdul Ghaffar, Muhammad

Bilal and Muhammad Irfan Haider and by declaring so both

criminal appeals are allowed. Impugned judgment is set_aside.

All the appellants are acquitted from the case. They are in

custody and they shall be released forthwith if not required in

any other case.
