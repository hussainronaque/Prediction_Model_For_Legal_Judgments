Ms. Asia Yaseen, Deputy District Public Prosecutor for the State.
Mr. Asif Mehmood Khan, Advocate for the complainant.

Through instant miscellaneous application, Muhammad Waseem
(applicant/convict) seeks suspension of execution of sentence awarded to
him by learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Lahore/trial court vide impugned
judgment dated: 28.02.2023 passed in complaint case titled as “Amjad Ali
versus Muhammad Saleem, etc.” in case arising out of F.I.R. No.344/2012,
dated: 04.04.2012 registered under Sections: 302, 452, 148, 149 PPC etc. at

Police Station: Saman Abad, Lahore, whereby he has been convicted and

sentenced with “Imprisonment for Life” under Section: 302 (b) PPC along

with payment of compensation of Rs.5,00,000/- under Section: 544-A
Cr.P.C. to the legal heirs of Muhammad Arshad (deceased of the case) and
in default thereof to further undergo S.I. for six months. Benefit of Section:
382-B Cr.P.C. was also extended to the applicant/convict.

2. After hearing learned counsel for the parties, learned
Deputy District Public Prosecutor and going through the
impugned judgment appended with the appeal, it has been noticed
that brief facts of the occurrence as per complaint have been
mentioned in paragraphs No.2, 3 of the impugned judgment and
perusal whereof reveals that accused persons namely {Muhammad
Saleem, Muhammad Waseem (present applicant), Muhammad Adeel,
Salah Uddin and two unknown accused armed with firearm weapons}
dragged Muhammad Arshad (now deceased of the case), Salah Uddin
(accused) raised a lalkara, accused persons started firing, Muhammad
Saleem (accused) made direct fire with rifle which hit at the chest of
Muhammad Arshad whereas accused persons made indiscriminate
firing in result whereof fire shots hit at walls of the houses,

Muhammad Arshad succumbed to the injuries.
Crl. Misc. No. 01/2023 in
Crl. Appeal No.20219/2023 2

Muhammad Saleem (aforementioned co-accused, who as per
case of the prosecution, caused injury to the deceased of the case) as
well as Muhammad Adeel and Salah-ud-Din (co-accused persons,
whose roles are at par and similar with the present applicant) have
already been acquitted in the case by the trial court on the basis of
same evidence through the same impugned judgment.

As per case of the prosecution, pistol was recovered from
Muhammad Saleem (co-accused, mentioned above) whereas pistol
and .44 bore rifle were recovered from present applicant however
after going through the impugned judgment, it has been apprised by
learned counsel for both the parties as well as learned Deputy District
Public Prosecutor that it has not been mentioned in the impugned
judgment that empties secured from the place of occurrence were
found as having been fired from said weapons.

When all aforementioned factors are taken into consideration in
totality, then conviction recorded and sentence awarded to the present
applicant needs reappraisal of evidence; in this regard, guidance has
been sought from the case of “SOBA KHAN Versus The STATE
and another” (2016 S C M R 1325) and relevant portion from the
same is reproduced: -

“17. It is by now well settled principle of law relating to
reappraisal of evidence that once co-accused, similarly
charged and attributed same and similar role in a particular
crime, is acquitted on the basis of same set of evidence where
the witnesses have maintained no regard for truth while
deposing on oath to tell the truth and nothing else then,
ordinarily they shall not be relied upon with regard to the
other co-accused unless their testimony/evidence is strongly
corroborated by independent cogent and convincing evidence.

18. Keeping in view the above principle of law, tentatively
it appears to us that the evidence furnished by the prosecution
in this case appears to be indivisible and in absence of
additional corroboration of the nature stated above, whether
conviction and sentence of the petitioner can be maintained on
the same evidence, on the basis of which the co-accused have
been acquitted with the same and similar role, thus, this fact
has entitled the petitioner to the concession of bail.”

It has been also categorically mentioned in paragraph No.24 of
the impugned judgment that present applicant/convict was on bail

during trial of the case and nothing is available on the record to show
that he misused said concession; case of “RAFAQAT AHMAD
Crl. Misc. No. 01/2023 in
Crl. Appeal No.20219/2023 3

versus THE STATE” (1994 S C M R 1206) can be safely referred in
this regard.

3. In view of what has been discussed above, case of the applicant
for suspension of execution of the sentence has been made out.
Resultantly, instant miscellaneous application is allowed; execution
of aforementioned sentence awarded to Muhammad Waseem
(applicant) is hereby suspended and he is ordered to be released on
bail till final disposal of main criminal appeal, subject to his
furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.500,000/- (Rupees five hundred
thousand only) with two sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of Deputy Registrar (Judicial) of this Court. However,
applicant is directed to remain present before this Court on each and

every date of hearing fixed in main criminal appeal.
