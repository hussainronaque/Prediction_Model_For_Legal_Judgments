SYED MUHAMMAD ATTIQUE SHAH

Accused-petitioner, Muhammad Anwar sccks his post
arrest bail in case FTIR No.284 dated 31.03.2018 under
sections 302/34 of Pakistan Penal Codec, 1860, read
with section 15 AA KPK registered at Police Station

2. The allegation against the accused-
petitioner, as revealed from the report lodged by
complainant Yasir Saleem is that he alongwith his co-
accused in furtherance of their common intention
committed Qatl-i-Amd of Nasir and Mst. Fizza Bibi,
brother and sister-in-law, respectively, of complainant

on 30.03.2018 at 1000 hours in village Banda Ali
Khan by firing at them. Motive for the occurrence
was stated to be love marriage of both the deceased.

3. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
partics heard and the record perused with their
valuable assistance.

4. Perusal of record would reveal that two
innocent persons have been murdered for the only
reason that they contracted marriage with their own
sweet will and consent. The female deceased,
Mst.iza Bibi was daughter of present
accused/petitioner, Muhammad Anwar. ‘Thus, the
brutal killing was for the sake of alleged ‘honour’ of
the accused/petitioner and his family. ‘The present
accused/petitioner is directly charged for commission
of the offence. The crime 30 bore pistol was
recovered on the  pointation of present
accused/petitioner and report of Virearms Expert
regarding crime pistol and empties recovered from the
spot is in affirmative coupled with postmortem report
and positive report of Scrologist regarding the blood
stained articles recovered during investigation. ‘The
role attributed to the present accused/petitioner is
distinguishable from the roles ascribed to co-accused,
who were released on bail by this Court. Thus, in

view of tentative assessment of material placed on
9

wey

record, this Court considers that there are reasonable
grounds to belicve that the present accused/petitioner
is, prima facie, connected with the commission of the
offence falling within the prohibitory clause of section
497Cr.P.C.

5. The observations rendered hereinabove
being tentative in nature, would not affect the mind of
the learned trial Court in any manner whatsoever,
during trial of the case.

6. Consequently, this bail petition is

dismissed.
