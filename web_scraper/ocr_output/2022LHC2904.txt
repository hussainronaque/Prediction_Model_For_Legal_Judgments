hospital and Arshad Ali injured succumbed to the injuries.

Hence the present FIR.

Parveen, Nazir Ahmad, Muhammad Sardar, Muhammad Ishaq,
Muhammad Yaseen and Muhammad Shafi being unnecessary,
tendered report of Chemical Examiner Ex.PX, report of Serologist
Ex.PV and Forensic Science Laboratory, closed its case.

16. After close of prosecution case statements of appellants
were recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C. They pleaded innocence
and denied the prosecution allegations. Aman Ullah Shah
appellant in reply to the question “why this case against you and
why the Pws deposed against you, answered as under:-

“It is a false case. The story has been concocted
and fabricated on the behest of Ismail Bhatti and
PW Subhan Sadiq Bhatti. The complainant party
waylaid and initiated trouble. They injured my
father Muhammad Shah and Muhammad Akram my
cousin (tayazad). It was my first plea that I was
sleeping in my house, there was noise that my
father has been murdered and I came out with a
gun. On seeing me, Amjad Ali complainant fired at
me thrice with pistol but I luckily escaped. A large
crowd had already gathered there, some of whom
were armed with fire arms and firing was also
taken place. I fired with my gun to scare off the
assailants of my father. Many persons appeared in
support of my plea during entire investigation.
During entire investigation police did not probe
into the facts of my first plea as required by law
and my lawful responsibilities. The I.O. never wrote
in his case diaries or opined that my first plea was
false. It was one sided, partial and dishonest
investigation under the influence of Ismail Bhatti,
etc.. The village population was sharply divided
between Bhattis and Syeds. During investigation,
section 109 PPC was deleted and as many as nine
accused out of 14 nominated in the FIR were found
innocent. Their names are:-

Amjad Ali Shah, Mansha Shah, Dildar Shah,
Akbar Shah, Nisar Shah, Shehzad alias Kala Shah,
Javed Shah, Fiaz Shah and Pannah Ali Shah.

Although all of us are innocent. The
prosecution with dishonest intention and malifides
suppressed the injuries of Muhammad Shah and
Akram Shah in league with the I.0O.

Naseer Ullah Shah appellant adopted the statement of
Aman Ullah Shah appellant and claimed to be innocent.
17. The appellants produced Muhammad Afzal H.C. (D.W.1)
and Muhammad Shah as D.W.2. in their defence evidence.

However, did not appear as their own witnesses under section
Criminal Appeal No.56573/2019 11
Criminal Revision No.56778/ 2019
Murder Reference No.203/2019

340(2), Cr.P.C.

18. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the
occurrence took place on a thorough fare but no independent
witness was cited by the prosecution; that the best evidence in
this case has been withheld, thus, necessary inference under
Article 129(g) of the Qanun-i-Shahadat, 1984 must be raised; that
conduct of the witnesses at the crime scene was unnatural; that
the postmortem examination was conducted with the lapse of 18-
24 hours, which suggests consultation and deliberation; that the
prosecution evidence was not in line with the medical evidence;
that the motive was not proved; that prosecution evidence was
replete with discrepancies/contradictions; that the recovered
weapon was found in working order and as_ such,
inconsequential; that majority of the co-accused of the appellants
were acquitted on the same set of evidence and as no
independent corroboration was forthcoming on record, thus,
conviction of the appellants cannot be sustained. Concluding his
arguments, learned counsel for the appellants added _ that
prosecution miserably failed to prove its case against the
appellant beyond reasonable shadow of doubt and every doubt
even slightest is always resolved in favour of the accused, thus,
the appellants be acquitted in this case.

19. Conversely, learned Deputy Prosecutor General assisted by
the learned counsel for the complainant controverted the
submissions put forth by the learned counsel for the appellants. It
was argued that it was a daylight occurrence, the parties were
residing in the same village, known to each other and there was
no question of mistaken identity; that the witnesses have
attributed specific roles to the appellants, supported by the
medical evidence as well as the recovery; that the motive was
also proved and the discrepancies hinted at by _ the learned
counsel for the appellants are negligible and do not adversely
affect the case of prosecution in any manner; that the prosecution

story is also corroborated by the medical evidence; that the
Criminal Appeal No.56573/2019 12
Criminal Revision No.56778/ 2019
Murder Reference No.203/2019

prosecution has proved its case against the appellants to the hilt,
therefore, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.

It may be mentioned that earlier this case was decided by
the learned trial Court vide judgment dated 29.8.2013. The
appellants filed criminal appeal No.293-J of 2013. Whereas, the
complainant filed Crl. Revision No.773-2013 and the learned trial
Court submitted Murder Reference No.279-2013. All the above
cases were decided by the Hon'ble Lahore High Court vide
judgment dated 16.4.2019 and the matter was remanded to the
learned trial Court to re-write the judgment.

After remand, the judgment was re-written by the learned
trial Court, vide judgment dated 18.7.2019, whereby the
appellants were held guilty, convicted and sentenced as
mentioned above.

20. We have given anxious considerations to the arguments
advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and have perused
the record.

21. During this occurrence, Arshad Ali, the deceased lost his
life. Whereas, Shafi, Zaheer Abbas, Bashir Ahmad, Abida
Nasreen, Perveen Akhtar, Nazir Ahmad and Ishaq sustained
injuries.

22. The occurrence took place on 06.9.2008 at about 3:30 p.m in
front of shop owned/run by the complainant within the area of
Chak No.463-GB. It was seven miles away from the police station.
The incident was reported at 4:45 p.m. The complainant Amjad Ali
entered in the witness box as PW.13, injured witness Zaheer
Abbas was examined as PW.14. He also supported the version
of the complainant.

23. The gist of the prosecution story was that on the day and
time of occurrence, the complainant was sitting in his shop along-
with Muhammad Aslam and Muhammad Arshad. The accused
including Akram Shah son of Manzoor Shah, Imran son of Sultan
Shah (since acquitted) and the appellant Naseer Ullah Shah
passed their shop and ridiculed them. The brother of the
Criminal Appeal No.56573/2019 13
Criminal Revision No.56778/ 2019
Murder Reference No.203/2019

complainant, Muhammad Aslam forbade them, which culminated
into altercation and the said accused left the crime scene by
extending threats of teaching the complainant party a lesson.
Meanwhile, Zaheer Abbas (PW.14) came to the shop of the
complainant to purchase the grocery. Meanwhile, all the accused
nominated in the FIR, while armed with their respective weapons
emerged at the crime scene. We would not go into details
regarding attribution and respective roles of the acquitted co-
accused. However, the appellants, both, were armed with 12
bore guns. A fire shot of Aman Ullah hit the chest of the deceased.
Whereas, fire shot attributed to Naseer Ullah Shah hit the injured
Zaheer Abbas (PW.14). On hearing alarm, Perveen Akhtar, Abida
Nasreen, Muhammad Yaseen, Muhammad Shafi, Bashir Ahmad,
Muhammad Ishaq PWs attracted to the spot. Then Naseer Ullah
Shah appellant fired which hit Muhammad Shafi, Bashir Ahmad,
Abida Nasreen, Muhammad Yaseen, Perveen Akhtar and
Muhammad Ishaq.

At this stage, it would be appropriate to mention that none
of the injured was examined during trial except Zaheer Abbas,
Bashir Ahmad and Muhammad Ishaq PWs. All the private
witnesses were closely related inter-se/the deceased. The
complainant was real brother of the deceased. Muhammad
Ishaq, Abida Nasreen were his chacha zad and Zaheer Abbas
PW was his close friend. Whereas, Bashir Ahmad PW was chacha
of the complainant. Perveen Akhtar was mother and Nazeer
Ahmad was father of the deceased.

24. The motive behind the occurrence was that a few moments
prior to the occurrence, the accused including Naseer Ullah Shah,
Akram and Imran ridiculed the complainant party which resulted
into altercation between the accused and Muhammad Aslam and
then, on return from their house all the accused enacted the above
episode.

25. As mentioned above, the occurrence took place in front of

shop run by the complainant. The injury sustained by the
Criminal Appeal No.56573/2019 14
Criminal Revision No.56778/ 2019
Murder Reference No.203/2019

deceased was assigned to Aman Ullah Shah, appellant. Whereas,
Naseer Ullah Shah was saddled with the responsibility of causing
fire arm injuries to the injured PWs. The complainant and Zaheer
Abbas PWs claimed to have witnessed this occurrence. The record
divulged that Muhammad Arshad deceased after sustaining
firearm injury fell down and then lifted/shifted by the
complainant and others to a rickshaw of Fazal Jatt resident of the
same village but he was not interrogated during the investigation.
The complainant admitted during the cross examination that while
shifting the deceased to rickshaw/hospital, his clothes got blood
stains but neither produced his blood stained clothes nor taken
into possession by the Investigating Officer. The witnesses were
at variance regarding salient features of the case. For example,
the complainant stated that only 5/6 fires were made by the
accused party. Whereas, Zaheer Ababs (PW.14) deposed that the
accused fired about hundred shots. The complainant gone on to
state that at the time of occurrence, he along-with the deceased
and Muhammad Aslam was standing in front of the shop but no
specific point is suggested by the scaled site plan Exh.PD. Akbar
Ali Nizami, appeared as PW.7. His statement revealed that the
place of occurrence was surrounded by a Chowk. He was unable
to specify the direction of the arrival of the accused and leaving
the crime scene. He admitted that had the said injured PWs told
him, he could have shown the same in his site plan and whatever
the witnesses told him, he incorporated those facts without
addition or omission in his notes recorded on Exh.PD and
Exh.PD/I but this fact is not confirmed by Zaheer Abbas (PW. 14)
who had shown his ignorance about arrival of PW.7 at the place
of occurrence. The place of occurrence was seven miles away from
the police station. The deceased succumbed to his injuries on his
way to hospital. Amjad Ali (PW.13) brought the dead body to
hospital at 3:45 p.m and at 3:50 p.m, the Medical Officer declared
Muhammad Arshad as dead. At this stage, we may mention that

Bashir Ahmad PW in his statement mentioned that the occurrence
Criminal Appeal No.56573/2019 15
Criminal Revision No.56778/ 2019
Murder Reference No.203/2019

took place at 2:30 p.m and no time of occurrence /death find
mentioned in column No.3 of the inquest report.

26. During the occurrence, as many as seven persons sustained
injuries, thus, it was a police case but they all were medically
examined privately-on their own. Though Bashir Ahmad PW
claimed that he was got medically examined by the police and it
was also in the statement of the Investigating Officer that he
dispatched all the injured to the Medical Officer for their medico
legal examination. However, no plausible explanation was
forthcoming on record for their medical examination without
police.

27. Admittedly, the prosecution is not bound to produce all the
witnesses to prove its case and even a case can be
concluded/decided on the basis of solitary statement but
amazingly, in this case, as mentioned above seven persons
sustained injuries but all of them were given up _ being
unnecessary except Zaheer Abbass, Bashir Ahmad and
Muhammad Ishaq meaning thereby that the best evidence in this
case was withheld by the prosecution and a necessary inference
under Article 129(g) of Qanun-i-Shahadat, 1984 has to be raised
that had_ the given up injured witnesses been produced at trial,
they would not have supported the prosecution version.

At this stage, it may also be mentioned that this case was
registered against fourteen accused. The investigating Agency did
not confirm the participation of the accused, namely, Ahmad Ali
Shah, Mansha, Dildar Shah, Akbar Shah, Nisar Shah, Shahzad
alias Kala, Javaid, Fayyaz and Pannah Ullah Shah. They all
were acquitted and the prosecution has not challenged their
acquittal. It is settled by now that if the majority of the  co-
accused is acquitted on the same set of evidence, the conviction
cannot be sustained if the strong corroboration is not forthcoming
on record, If some law is needed, reliance can be placed on
“Tftikhar Hussain and another versus State”(PLJ 2004 SC 552),
“Sarfraz alias Sappi and _2 others versus The State”(2000 SCMR

Criminal Appeal No.56573/2019 16
Criminal Revision No.56778/ 2019
Murder Reference No.203/2019

1758) and “Akhtar_Ali_and_others versus The State” (2008
SCMR-6).

28. Now, we would evaluate the prosecution case on the
touch stone of the law declared by the apex Court in the above
mentioned judgments. Motive behind the occurrence was an
altercation between three accused and Muhammad Aslam (not
produced) a few moments prior to the occurrence. The details of
altercation cannot be had from the available material and it was
not determined during the investigation, who specifically ridiculed
the complainant party. Whereas, during trial, the complainant
mentioned/ introduced another motive that the
appellants/accused committed this crime as case FIR No.362
was registered against Akram Shah etc. He admitted during the
cross-examination that he got recorded his supplementary
statement at 10:00 p.mon the day of occurrence and no motive
was mentioned in the said supplementary statement. It is settled
law that the motive is not the component of murder and some
crimes are motiveless. Even otherwise, the motive is hidden deep
in the mind of the perpetrators of the crimes and the prosecution
is not bound to introduce any motive but once a particular, motive
is set up and not established then, it militates against the
prosecution. In any case, Muhammad Aslam was not examined
during trial and, thus, it could safely be concluded that the
prosecution failed to prove the motive.

29. The appellant Aman Ullah Shah was arrested in this case
on 08.10.2008 and led to the recovery of crime weapon Exh.PT
from his house jointly occupied by the family members. At the time
of recovery, it was lying open and so did the iron box from where
the 12 bore gun was recovered/taken into possession. The
recovery of weapon was witnessed by Muhammad Aslam 513-HC
(PW.2). An objection was raised by the accused at the time of his
cross examination that he was incapable to cross examine the
witness as he was not delivered the copy of his statement

recorded under section 161, Cr.P.C but this important and legal
Criminal Appeal No.56573/2019 17
Criminal Revision No.56778/ 2019
Murder Reference No.203/2019

aspect was not seriously attended to by the learned trial Court.
The recovered gun was dispatched to Punjab Forensic Science
Agency through Ghulam Muhammad 32-C (PW.3) on 03.11.2008
and he deposited the same in the Forensic Science Laboratory on
the same day but the said parcel was received in the office of
Forensic Science Laboratory on 04.11..2008, thus, safe
transmission of the recovered gun was not proved. Any-how, the
recovered gun was found in working order, thus, recovery of 12
bore gun (P-3 )was inconsequential.

30. As discussed above, Zaheer Abbas (PW.14) was friend of
the complainant and claimed to have visited shop of the deceased
to buy certain articles. He was fired at by Naseer Ullah Shah, the
appellant and sustained firearm injury in his face but amazingly
no bruise/ scratch or damage to facial tissue was observed by the
Medical Officer on his face. His injury as observed by the Medical
Officer can advantageously be reproduced for ready reference:

> A firearm wound of entry 1.5 C.M x 1 C.M with missing of third
lower incisor tooth and upper right first incisor with their
bleeding sockets. Injury No.1 was kept under observation and
was referred to Dental Surgeon for assessment of nature of
injury and X-ray of face was also advised.
The probable duration of the injury was observed as one

hour. The possibility of suffering injury No.1 by firearm was
opined by him. On 17.9.2008, after receiving report of radiologist
DHQ Hospital, no bony injury was seen in facial bones according
to the report of Dental Surgeon dated 16.9.2008. However, that
injury was due to external blow or trauma and as such attracted
section 337(U), PPC.

31. The Medical Officer was cross-examined by the defence on
this significant aspect if the injury of Zaheer Abbas (PW. 14) could
be sustained in such circumstances. It was admitted by the
Medical Officer that if an injury on the person of Zaheer Abbas
had been caused by firearm, there would have been fracture of
facial bone. The relevant excerpts from the statement of Dr.

Shahid Nadeem (PW.9), read as under:
Criminal Appeal No.56573/2019 18
Criminal Revision No.56778/ 2019
Murder Reference No.203/2019

32.

“It is correct that if an injury on the person of Zaheer Abbas
had been caused by fire arm, there would have been fracture of
facial bone. Again said their could be possibility and no
possibility of the facture of the bone in such case. It is correct
that I have used word “possibility” of suffering of injury No.1 by
firearm and I mean by it that there may be possibility and there
may not be possibility of the injury having been caused by the
firearm. It is correct that while describing injury No.1 I have
used word ‘missing’. There was no corresponding injury on the
lips or the gums of injury No.1. I had examined the patient asa
private case and charged the usual fee of Rs.200/- as prescribed
by me. I did not inform the police as the patient himself
undertook to inform the police.

The gunshot wound/injuries to the face can have serious

aesthetic, functional and psychological consequences. There are a

number of types of dental trauma that can happened to

permanent teeth. These include:

Dental Trauma: is the physical injury to the tooth, gums,
alveolar bones (the bone that holds the tooth socket) or the
soft tissues of the lips and tongue.

Concussion: A tooth concussion is a mildest type of
trauma which can be inflicted on a tooth.

(ii) Subluxation: Subluxation refers to the situation in
which the tooth is dislocated without socket or worseness or
increased mobility of tooth due to weakening of supporting
structure.

Luxation: Tooth luxation occurs when trauma, such as fall,
disrupts the tissues, ligaments and bone that holds a tooth
in place:

(a) Lateral Luxation: The displacement of the tooth as a

result of nearby bone fracture;

(b) Intrusive Luxation: has been defined as dislocation

of a tooth in an axial direction into alveolar bone

(c) Extrusive Luxation: An extrusive luxation occurs

when periodontal ligament separates.
Avulsion: Avulsion refers to the situation in which the
entire tooth is completely displaced from the socket.

Alveolar Fracture: Alveolar fracture may involve an

isolated tooth or two, or more teeth with labial or
Criminal Appeal No.56573/2019 19
Criminal Revision No.56778/ 2019
Murder Reference No.203/2019

lingual displacement of the dento-alveolar segment,
resulting in loss of the arch continuity and painful
occlusal interference and

Tooth Fracture: A significant crack or breakage on

the ridged exterior shell of the tooth.
33. The injured Zaheer Abbas son of Muhammad Yaseen was
medically examined by Dr. Shahid Nadeem (PW.9) He observed a
firearm wound of entry 1.5 cm x 1 cm with missing of third lower
incisor tooth and upper right first incisor with their bleeding
sockets. The possibility of suffering injury No.1 by firearm was
there. No bony injury was seen in facial bones according to the
report of Dental Surgeon dated 16.09.2008, who appeared as

PW.12. His observations were as follows:

75432 | 23456
87643 | 234573
B-D-R present
61 | 12

-] | 16

34. The above observation of the dental surgeon revealed that
teeth No.1 and 6 were missing from the right upper and teeth
No.1 and 7 were not observed in the left upper. Whereas, teeth
No.1 and 2 do not find mention in the right lower and teeth No. 1
and 6 were not observed in the left lower. It is mentioned in his
statement that the broken down root of teeth No.1 of the right
upper and teeth No.1 and 2 of the left upper were observed and
BDR of tooth No.1 of the right lower and teeth No.1 and 6 of the
left lower were present. The presence of BDR (broken down root )
suggested that those teeth were not completely present in the
gingiva (gums). The injuries sustained by Zaheer Abbas as

described by PW.9 do not suggest if missing third lower incisor
Criminal Appeal No.56573/2019 20
Criminal Revision No.56778/ 2019
Murder Reference No.203/2019

tooth was on the upper or lower right or upper or lower left. No
danger to the facial tissues was either observed by the Medical
Officer or find mentioned in his statement and the similar was
the description regarding facial tissues by Dr. Ahmad Nadeem,
who appeared as PW.12. He observed mild swelling on the upper
lip and the right and _ left upper incisors were broken at the level
of gingival margin. Bashir Ahmad PW:17 was also medically
examined by PW:9, who observed the following injury:

Injury:-
.A lacerated wound .75 Cm. x 5 Cm on the inner middle

inner upper lip with partial fracture of left upper left

incisor and trimming of the second left upper incisor

and lower right first incisor and left first incisor are

also shaky

35. This fact was also not confirmed by _ the number

of teeth present as per observation of PW.12. His statement
reflected that teeth No.7 of the right lower was missing whereas,
broken down root of first upper incisor and left upper teeth Nos. 1,
2 and 6 were observed by him. We would observe at the cost of
repetition that the description of injuries by PW.9 and the
radiologist (PW.12) do not coincide with each other. However,
both the Medical Officers were in unison that the injuries
sustained by both the injured were result of external trauma.
Their injuries were described as gun shots wounds but no
damage to the facial tissue, fracture to maxilla or mandible and
no laceration was found on their gums. As mentioned above, PW.9
has admitted in his cross examination that if all the injuries on
the person of Zaheer Abbas had been caused by firearm there
would have been fracture of facial bone and no such categorical
statement regarding the same fracture sustained by Bashir
Ahmad was made by PW.9, thus, we can safely conclude that
cause of their injuries was external trauma, which could be result

of fall, punch, accident or by any other means , thus, the
Criminal Appeal No.56573/2019 21
Criminal Revision No.56778/ 2019
Murder Reference No.203/2019

prosecution failed to prove that firearm injuries claimed to have

been sustained by both the said injured were result of gun shots.

36. The prosecution also produced Muhammad Ishaq

son of Muhammad Shafi as PW.18, He was also medically

examined by Dr. Shahid Nadeem, who observed three injuries on

his body including laceration exposed bone on the left side of
head, contused swelling on the back of right shoulder and

contusion on the right upper back of chest.

37. All the three injured had not specifically attributed their
injuries to any of the accused not to speak of the appellants even
no role of the appellants find mentioned in the statements of
Zaheer Abbas, Bashir Ahmad and Muhammad Ishaq if they were
fired at by the appellants or beaten by ‘dandas’ or through some
other weapon by them. No doubt, they were medically examined
by PWs.9 and 10 and their medico legal reports were available on
the file but as mentioned above, they got those medico legal
reports on their own which is unusual in police cases and no
plausible reason was available on the file for their medical
examination without intervention of police. Though all the three
were injured but the tale described by them appeared to be
improbable and does not appeal to a prudent mind. The statement
of the prosecution witness does not inspire confidence and not in
consonance with probabilities. Dealing with a similar question, the
apex Court in case titled “Muhammad Saleem V. The State” (2010
SCMR 374) at page 377, observed as under:

eevees General rule is that statement of a witness must
be in-consonance with the probabilities fitting in the
circumstances of the case and also inspires
confidence in the mind of a reasonable and prudent
mind. If these elements are present, then’ the
statement of a worst enemy of the accused, can be
accepted and relied upon without corroboration but if
these elements are missing then the statement of a
pious man can be rejected without second thought.
Reference is invited to Haroon alias Harooni V. The
State and another 1995 SCMR 1627. The acid test of
veracity of a witness is the inherent merit of his own
statement. It is not necessary that an impartial and
independent witness, who is neither related to the
complainant nor inimical towards the accused would
Criminal Appeal No.56573/2019 22
Criminal Revision No.56778/ 2019
Murder Reference No.203/2019

stamp his testimony necessarily to be true. The
statement itself has to be scrutinized thoroughly and
it is to be seen as to whether in the circumstances of
the case the statement is reasonable, probable or
plausible and could be relied upon. The principle, that
a disinterested witness is always to be relied upon
even his statement is unreasonable, improbable and
not plausible or not fitting in the circumstances of the
case then it would lead to a very dangerous
consequences. Reference is invited to Muhammad
Rafique V. State 1977 SCMR 454 and Haroon V. The
State 1995 SCMR 1627”

It may also be mentioned that the injuries sustained by a
witness may reflect his presence at the crime scene but on the
basis of that injury it cannot be determined that the witnesses
described the whole truth, half truth or that he cannot be
disbelieved for sustaining such injury. A similar question came up
for consideration before their lordships in “Amin Ali v. The State”

(2011 SCMR 323), the relevant observations of their lordships can

also be reproduced hereunder:

“12. Certainly, the presence of the injured
witnesses cannot be doubted at the place of
incident, but the question is as to whether
they are truthful witnesses or otherwise,
because merely the injuries on the persons of
P.Ws. would not stamp them truthful
witnesses...”
At this stage, we may mention that the complainant also got

injured during this occurrence but this fact was not mentioned in
the “karvai police” recorded at the foot of Exh.PA. Even his injury

statement was not prepared by the police.

38. The occurrence took place at about 3:30 p.m on 06.9.2008.
The postmortem of the deceased was conducted by Dr. Shehbaz
Ahmad (PW.11). He observed the following injuries on his body:

l(a) A multiple firearm injury which are seven in

number present on left upper side of chest, margins

inverted, blackening present in area of6C.Mx7C.M.

A complex of exit wound on back left chest with margins

everted in area of 6 C.M x3 C.M which are there in

numbers with profuse bleeding.
Criminal Appeal No.56573/2019 23
Criminal Revision No.56778/ 2019
Murder Reference No.203/2019

39. He opined that probable time that elapsed between injuries
and death was sudden and between death and post mortem
examination was 12 to 18 hours. He also admitted that he has
not mentioned’ the time of death in the relevant column of
postmortem report (Exh.PN) and the same also was not mentioned
in column No.3 of the inquest report Exh.PQ. He further admitted
that no date and time was mentioned in the column of post mortem
report “examination of dead body”. He conducted the postmortem
examination of the deceased promptly after receiving the dead
body and police papers meaning thereby that he received the
police papers after the lapse of about 12-18 hours, which suggests
consultation and_ deliberation. Even otherwise, delayed
postmortem makes the prosecution case doubtful as declared by
the apex Court in case titled “Irshad _ Ahmed versus The State”
(2011 SCMR 1190) and the relevant observations of their

lordships are as follows:

“3. ..We have further observed that the post-mortem
examination of the deadbody of Shehzad Ahmed
deceased had been conducted with a noticeable delay
and such delay is generally suggestive of a real
possibility that time had been consumed by the police
in procuring and planting eye-witnesses and in
cooking up a story for the prosecution before
preparing police papers necessary for getting a post-
mortem examination of the deadbody conducted...”

40. The acquittal of the co-accused of the appellants remained
unchallenged till date. They were acquitted on the same set of
evidence. The prosecution failed to establish the motive through
convincing and cogent evidence. The recovery was also
inconsequential and medical evidence was also not in line with the
ocular account, thus, we have no hesitation to hold that the

conviction of the appellants cannot be sustained as no

independent corroboration was forthcoming on record.

41. The occurrence took place at mid-day, in front of shop

situated at a Chowk. It was mentioned by Zaheer Abbas (PW. 14)
Criminal Appeal No.56573/2019 94
Criminal Revision No.56778/ 2019
Murder Reference No.203/2019

that 50/100 persons were then present at the crime scene. All the
witnesses were related to each other/the deceased and no
independent witness was cited by the prosecution. Even some
injured witnesses were not examined and given up being
unnecessary.

42. The shortcomings in the case of prosecution, observed by us,
can be summarized as under:

(i) No specific time of occurrence is borne out from
the available record;

(ii) The best evidence was withheld by the
prosecution as most of the injured PWs_ were
not examined being unnecessary;

(iti) The prosecution failed to prove the immediate
motive as mentioned in the FIR because
Muhammad Aslam was not examined;

(iv)The recovery of crime weapon lends no
corroboration to the prosecution for the reasons
mentioned in the preceding paras;

(v) The medical evidence was also not in line with
the prosecution story as the postmortem was
conducted with unexplained delay of 12-18
hours;

(viJThe complainant reported the incident to police
but none of the injured PW was medically
examined through police;

(vii) No time of occurrence find mentioned in
Exh.PQ and the column of the postmortem
report regarding specific time of death is also
blank;

(viii) The parties were inimical to each other and
fraction between ‘Bhatti’ and “Syed” berotheri
was there in village;

(ix)The witnesses have made _ dishonest

improvements and were duly confronted with
Criminal Appeal No.56573/2019 25
Criminal Revision No.56778/ 2019
Murder Reference No.203/2019

their previous statements for such addition or
omissions;

(x) The safe transmission of the crime weapon
recovered from Aman Ullah was also not
established by the prosecution;

(xi) The co-accused of the appellants including
Ahmad Ali Shah, Mansha, Dildar Shah, Akbar
Shah, Nisar Shah, Shahzad alias Kala, Javaid,

Fayyaz and Pannah Ullah Shah were declared
innocent during the investigation;

(xii) Mansha and Ahmad Ali Shah were assigned
abetment by Nazir and Bashir Ahmad PWs but
the Investigating Officer deleted section 109
PPC during the investigation;

(xiii) The blood stained clothes of the complainant,

Zaheer Abbas PW and Muhammad Aslam PW
were not taken into possession;

(xiv) The scaled site plan was not prepared under
the instructions of the -injured witness;

(xv) The majority of the co-accused of appellants
were acquitted on the same set of evidence;

43. The resume of the above discussion is that the prosecution
miserably failed to prove its case beyond reasonable shadow of
doubt against the appellants. The complete tale has not been
described by the witnesses and certain material facts seems to
have been suppressed. The occurrence might have taken place but
not in the manner as described by the prosecution.

44. It is settled principle of law that prosecution primarily is
bound to establish guilt against the accused, beyond shadow of
reasonable doubt by producing trustworthy, convincing and
coherent evidence enabling the Court to draw the conclusion
whether the prosecution has succeeded in establishing accusation
or otherwise and if it comes to the conclusion that the charge was

imputed against the accused and have not been proved beyond
Criminal Appeal No.56573/2019 26
Criminal Revision No.56778/ 2019
Murder Reference No.203/2019

reasonable doubt, then the accused becomes entitled to acquittal

on the basis of benefit of doubt.

45. It is by now settled that benefit of doubt, if found in the
prosecution’s case, the accused shall be held entitled to the
benefit, thereof. It is also settled principle of criminal
administration of justice that if there is element of doubt, as to the
guilt of accused, it must be resolved in his favour. The golden rule
of benefit is initially a rule of prudence which cannot be ignored,
while dispensing justice in accordance with law. It is based on
maxim that it is better to acquit ten guilty persons rather than to
convict one innocent person. For acquittal of accused in an offence,
how-so heinous it may be, only a single doubt in the prosecution
evidence is sufficient. Reliance in this respect can be made on

“Mst. Nazia_Anwar_versus The State_and_others” (2018 SCMR

911) and the relevant observations of their lordships appearing
in page-922 at para-12 read as under:

“....The cardinal principle in the criminal justice
system in a situation like this, is to extend benefit of
doubt to an accused to acquit him/her of capital
charge, instead of reducing the sentence. Once
doubts about the genuineness of the story lurk into
the minds of the judges, the only permissible course
is to acquit the accused and not go for the
alternative sentence of life imprisonment. In this
regard reference may be made to the following case
laws:

“(i) Ayub Masih v. The State (PLD 2002 SC 1048)
(ii) Muhammad Zaman v. The State and others
(2014 SCMR 749)
(iti) Hashim Qasim v. The State (2017

SCMR 986)

It is also well entrenched rule and principle of law
that on the basis of probabilities, accused person
may be extended benefit of doubt acquitting him/her
of a capital charge however, such probabilities, high
howsoever could not be made basis for conviction of
an accused person and that too on a capital charge”

Reference in that respect may further be made
on “ Muhammad_Mansha_versus_The_State”"(2018
SCMR 772). The relevant observation of their lordships

appearing at page 778 in para-4 are as under:
Criminal Appeal No.56573/2019 27
Criminal Revision No.56778/ 2019
Murder Reference No.203/2019

“4, Needless to mention that while giving the
benefit of doubt to an accused it is not necessary
that there should be many circumstances creating
doubt. If there is a circumstance which creates
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt
of the accused, then the accused would be entitled
to the benefit of such doubt, not as a matter of grace
and concession but as a matter of right. It is based
on the maxim “it is better that ten guilty persons be
acquitted rather than one innocent person be
convicted”. Reliance in this behalf can be made upon
the cases of Tariq Pervez v. The State (1995 SCMR
1345), Ghulam_Qadir_and_ 2 others _v. The State
(2008 SCMR 1221), Muhammad Akram v. The State
(2009 SCMR 230) and Muhammad _ Zaman _v. The
State (2014 SCMR 749)”

46. For reasons mentioned above, the Criminal__Appeal
No.56573 of 2019 is allowed. Resultantly, the judgment
18.7.2019 rendered by the trial Court is hereby set aside. The

accused are acquitted of the charges. They are in custody, be
released forthwith if not required in any other case.
For the reasons recorded above, Crl. Revision

No.56778-2019 stands dismissed.

Murder Reference No.203 of 2019 is answered in

the negative and death sentence is not confirmed.
