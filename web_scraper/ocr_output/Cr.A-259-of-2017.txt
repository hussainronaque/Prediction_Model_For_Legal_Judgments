CONSOLIDATED
JUDGMENT

SYED ARSHAD ALI, J.- Through this single

judgment, we intend to decide this criminal
appeal bearing No. 259-M/2017 as well as
connected Cr.R. bearing No. 4-M/2018 as
both these matters emanate from one and the
same judgment dated 27.11.2017 handed

down by learned Additional Sessions

NAWABIPS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Judge/Izafi Zila Qazi Matta Swat, whereby the
appellant was convicted under section 302 (b)
of the Pakistan Penal Code (“PPC”) for the
murder of his wife Mst. Salma and sentenced
to life imprisonment along with a
compensation of Rs. 200,000/- (two lacs)
under section 544-A Cr.P.C and in default
thereof to further undergo simple
imprisonment for six (6) months. He was also
convicted under section 15 of the Arms Act
and sentenced to 2 years simple imprisonment,
however, it was ordered that both the
sentences shall run concurrently. Benefit of
section 382-B Cr.P.C was also extended to the
accused/appellant. Whereas the co-accused
Aqil, brother of the appellant and Bakhtiar,
father of the appellant were acquitted from the
charges leveled against them.

2: Briefly stated facts of the case as
reflected from the record are; that on
02.9.2016 at about 20:00 hours the police
official Sher Bahader Khan, ASI, PW-10, on

receipt of information regarding the incident,

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
came to the spot which is the house of the
present appellant and there he found the
deceased Mst. Salma dead and a pistol
unlicensed was also lying along with her dead
body. The same was recovered by the said
police official. At the spot, the complainant
Fazal Ghani, PW-3 who is father of the
deceased reported the matter to the effect that
on the eventful day, he was informed by the
present appellant through his cell phone No.
03488476803 that the deceased had
committed suicide. On such information,
when he reached at the place of occurrence, he
found his daughter; the deceased Mst. Salma
dead. The complainant charged the present
appellant for the murder of his daughter
whereas the acquitted co-accused Aqil and
Bakhtiar were charged for abetment.

3. The above-referred report of the
complainant was incorporated in ‘Murasila’
Ex. PW-10/1 which culminated into FIR
bearing No. 296, Ex. PA dated 02.09.2016

being registered against the present

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
accused/appellant and other co-accused at
23:00 hours under sections 302,109,34 PPC
and 15 Arms Act at Police Station Shaheedan
Waina Matta District Swat. Investigation was
started in the case, the appellant as well as his
father Bakhtiar was arrested on the following
day i.e. 03.09.2016 at 17:00 hours through
card arrest Ex. PW-9/2. The Investigation
Officer prepared the site plan Ex. PW-9/1 and
also made recoveries of the incriminating
articles from the spot.

4. On completion of the
investigation, complete challan was submitted
before the competent Court. At trial, the
prosecution examined as many as 12
witnesses whose statements were recorded and
placed on file. On closure of the prosecution
evidence, accused were examined under
section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein they denied the
charges, claimed innocence and stated to have
been falsely implicated in the case.

5. On conclusion of the trial, the

learned Additional Sessions Judge/ Izafi Zilla

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr, Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Qazi Matta Swat, convicted and sentenced the
accused/appellant, vide the judgment
impugned herein, whereas the other co-
accused Aqil and Bakhtiar were acquitted
from the charges, hence these connected
matters.

6. Arguments were heard and record
of the case was perused with the able
assistance of learned counsels for the parties
as well as the learned Law Officer
representing the State.

Ts It appears from the FIR, Ex. PA
that the occurrence has taken place at the
house of the appellant situated within the local
limits of village Kareenoona Wargar Bala Sur
which is at a distance of 9/10 KMs from the
police station. The time of occurrence
according to the FIR is
Dupher Vela (noon) and the ‘Murasila’ Ex.
PW-10/1 was drafted at 20:00 hours on the
same day i.e. 02.09.2016 whereas the FIR, Ex.

PA was registered at 23:00 hours.

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
8. As per postmortem report of the
deceased Ex. PW-1/1 furnished by lady doctor
Sidra, PW-1, the deceased has sustained the

following injuries: -

Wounds, bruises, position, _ size,
nature:-

e Bruise about 4-5 cm on length on

right leg slightly above right
ankle joint.

e Single entry wound present on
back on left side of chest at the
level of apex of scapula about
0.5-1 cm in length with no
charring marks.

e Exit wounds present on front at
upper abdomen at the level of
epigastrium about 3-4 cm in
length with irregular margins

and fresh bleeding.

Thus it is established on record

that it is the case of homicide and not suicide.

9. It is also evident from record that
on the following day of the crime ie.
03.09.2016 the Investigation Officer has also
recorded the statements of Hameedullah who

is the paternal cousin of the deceased who

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
latter appeared as PW-4 and Shakirullah
another maternal cousin of the deceased who
was latter examined as PW-5 during the trial.
Both the said PWs have claimed that they
have witnessed the occurrence.

10. According to the FIR, the time of
occurrence is noon time, the ‘Murasila’ was
drafted on 02.09.2016 at 20:00 hours. The
postmortem on the body of the deceased was
conducted on 10:25 P.M. (22: 25 hours) and
the FIR was registered at 23:00 hours.
According to the postmortem report the time
between death and the postmortem report is
7/8 hours, whereas the distance between the
police station and the place of occurrence is
9/10 hours. Hence, the prosecution had ample
opportunity to conduct a preliminary
investigation. The prosecution case is
completely silent about the reasons for delay
in registration of FIR and conducting of the
postmortem report with such delay. Even
strangely to note that the ‘Murasila’ was

drafted at 20:00 hours and the FIR was

NAWAB/PS* DB: ‘Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
registered at 23:00 hours, hence this fact also
renders the time of drafting of the ‘Murasila’
doubtful. Thus there is an inherent dent in the
prosecution story, hence the other evidence
i.e. ocular and circumstantial evidence is to be
looked into very carefully and with utmost
caution.

11. Admittedly, the complainant
Fazal Ghani, father of the deceased lady who
appeared as PW-3 is neither the eyewitness of
the occurrence nor he has stated in his report/
FIR that the occurrence was witnessed by
Hameedullah and Shakirullah. The motive
was stated to be that the present appellant who
is the husband of the deceased had sold the
dower ornaments of his deceased wife, which
was a continuous reason of quarrelling
between the spouses. However, the said
motive could not be established by the
prosecution in its evidence. Thus, the entire
prosecution case rests on the testimony of
PW-4 Hameedullah and PW-5 Shakirulllah

alongwith the circumstantial evidence that

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
admittedly the deceased was the wife of the
appellant and she died on account of unnatural
death i.e. was fired through firearm and her
dead body was found in the house of the
present appellant.

12. Hameedullah, while appearing as
PW-4 has stated in his statement that on
02.09.2016 which was Friday he alongwith his
cousin Shakirullah after Juma prayers paid
visit to the nearby mountain for entertainment.
They stayed there for about 1-1/2 hours and
while coming back when reached near the
house of the appellant; they heard noise and
commotion from the house of the present
appellant and when they went inside the
house; there Qabil the present appellant was
holding a pistol in his hand and he fired at the
deceased, they being empty-handed hence
returned. On their way, they found the
complainant and thereby informed him about
the incident. On the following day, the
Investigation Officer prepared site plan on

their pointation. In his cross-examination, he

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-10-

has admitted that his house is situated at a
distance from the house of complainant which
can be covered within a 3 minutes, whereas
the distance between his house and
Shakirullah is almost 1 KM. They went
towards the mountain at about 2-1/2 hours
hence they reached at the mountain on 03:00
P.M. There they stayed for about quarter past
one hour and the distance from the said
mountain and the house of the appellant can
be covered within 10/15 minutes. It is
pertinent to note that the complainant in his
statement has stated that the distance between
his house and the house of the appellant can
be covered within 30/45 minutes while
walking on foot.

13. Similarly, another alleged
eyewitness Shakirullah appeared as PW-5 and
has recorded somewhat similar statement.

14. As stated above, the said two
witnesses were neither cited as eye-witnesses
in the FIR nor their statement was recorded on

the same day. Indeed their statement was

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr, Justice Syed Arshad Ali
aal'E 2

recorded on the following day. It is settled
law that the credibility of a witness becomes
highly suspicious if his statement is recorded
with delay without offering any plausible
explanation. In this regard, reliance can be
placed on “Muhammad Sadig vs the State”
PLD 1960 Supreme Court 223), “Tarig Gul
ys Ziarat__Gul_ (1976 _ _SCMR___236,

“Muhammad _Igqbal_vs_the State” (1984
SCMR _ 930), and “Haroon alias Harooni vs
the State and another” (1995 SCMR 1627),
wherein it has been that:- “The general rule
of appreciation of evidence is that statement
of a witness must be in consonance with the
probabilities fitting in the circumstances of
the case and also inspire confidence in the
mind of a reasonable prudent man. It these
elements are present, then the statement of
the worst enemy, of an accused may be
accepted and relied upon without
corroboration, but if these elements are
missing, then the statement of a pious man

may be rejected without second thought.

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-12-

Similarly, it has been settled by
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in

“Muhammad _Khan’s _case vs __ Maula

Bakhshah” (1998 SCMR_570) that: - “It is
settled law that credibility of a witness is
looked with serious suspicion if his statement
under section 161 Cr.P.C is recorded with
delay without offering any plausible
explanation.

15. The complainant has stated in the
‘Murasila’ as well as in his court statement
that he was informed by the present appellant
through his cell number that the deceased had
committed suicide, whereas the Investigation
Officer Amir Zaib, SI while appearing as PW-
9 in his cross-examination has confirmed that
according to the CDR of the cell phone
mentioned in the ‘Murasila’ the complainant
did not receive any call from the appellant at
the relevant time. The said statement of the
complainant was also contradicted by the PWs
wherein they have stated that indeed it was

them who informed the complainant about the

NAWABIPS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-13-

occurrence. However, despite the complainant
had ample opportunity for deliberation and
consultation he has not mentioned in the
‘Murasila’ that the occurrence was seen by the
eyewitnesses Hameedullah and Shakirullah.
Therefore, the presence of the aforesaid two
eye-witnesses become very doubtful.
Furthermore, the conducted of the alleged
eyewitnesses of the occurrence is also
unnatural because according to _ their
statements the deceased was killed in their
presence who is their close relative but they
were not available when the police reached the
place of occurrence. They even did not
accompany the deceased to the hospital. Their
statements regarding the time of occurrence
which comes around 4 P.M. is also
contradicted by the statement of the
complainant and the time provided in the
postmortem report. Besides, their places of
residence are situated at considerable distance
from the place of occurrence, hence they being

the chance witnesses, therefore, they were

NAWABI/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-14-

supposed to justify their presence at the place
of occurrence at the relevant time which they

had failed. In this regard reliance is placed on

the case of “Mst. Rukhsana Begum and

others vs. Sajjad and others” (2017 SCMR
596) wherein it has been held that:- “Chance
witness was one who, in the normal course was
not supposed to be present on the crime spot
unless he offered cogent, convincing and
believable explanation, justifying his presence

there.”

Therefore, all these
circumstances render their testimony
untruthful, hence, the statements of both the
alleged eyewitnesses are to be excluded from
consideration.

16. Thus, the only circumstance
which exists against the appellant is that
admittedly the deceased was his wife and she
died unnatural death at the house of the
appellant. However, it discerns from record
that apart from deceased, his father, brother

and other female members of his family were

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
off Bis

residing in the said house. True that it has
been settled by the august Supreme Court of
Pakistan in number of judgments that with
regard to vulnerable members of the society,
such as children, women and the infirm, who
were living with the accused or was last seen
in his company before their death, the accused
ought to offer some explanation as to what
happened to them and when instead offering
explanation if the accused remains silent or
offers a false explanation he casts a shadow
upon himself. In such cases the immediate
conduct of the accused is relevant. However,
mere this circumstance that the deceased
remained in custody of her husband and dies
unnatural death was never alone considered a
sufficient proof for conviction of an accused.
In this regard reliance can be placed on the
case of “Saeed Ahmad vs the State (2015
SCMR_710), wherein the august Supreme
Court of Pakistan while upholding the
conviction of the appellant therein has held:-

“That with regard to vulnerable members of society,

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-16-

such as children, women and the infirm, who were
living with the accused or were last in his company
the accused ought to offer some explanation of what
happened to them. If instead he remains silent or
offers a false explanation he casts a shadow upon
himself. This does not mean that the burden of proof
has shifted onto the accused as it is for the
prosecution to prove its case, however, in respect of
the helpless or the weak that require protection or
care it would not be sufficient for the accused to stay
silent in circumstances which tend to incriminate
him, and if he elects to do so he lightens the burden
of the prosecution. Article 122 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order too stipulates that if a particular
fact is especially within the knowledge of any person
the burden of proving that fact is upon him. In the
present case the prosecution had established its case
against the appellant; two eye-witnesses had deposed
against him and the medical evidence confirmed
strangulation of the deceased. The appellant did not
attend to the last rites of his wife who had died whilst
residing with him, he also did not inform the police
nor took his wife to a hospital and disappeared for
two months, such circumstances corroborate the
prosecution case in the absence of the appellant
offering a reasonable explanation for his unnatural

conduct.”

NAWABI/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Zi

l7'-

However, in the above-referred
case all the Courts had believed the testimony
of the eyewitnesses who have witnessed
strangulation of the deceased at the hands of
the appellant and the brother of the appellant
who had facilitated her strangulation by
holding her down and the statements of the
said eyewitnesses were also corroborated by
the medical evidence. Furthermore, the
Honourable Supreme Court has also drawn
adverse inference from the immediate
abscondance of the accused after the
occurrence.

In the recent judgment reported
as “Arshad Khan ys the State (2017 SCMR
564)”, the august Supreme Court of Pakistan
has elaborately held in Para 4 of the judgment
that:- “It may be true that it has been held by this

Court in the cases of Arshad Mehmood y. The State
(2005 SCMR 1524) and Saeed Ahmed y. The State
(2015 SCMR 710) that in such cases some part of the
onus lies on the accused person to explain as to how
and in which circumstances the accused person's

wife had died an unnatural death inside the confines

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
=

= fg =

of the matrimonial home but at the same time
it has also been clarified by this Court in the
case of Abdul Majeed v. The State (2011
SCMR 941) that where the prosecution
completely fails to discharge its initial onus
there no part of the onus shifts to the accused
person at all.”

The said view was also

re-affirmed by the august Supreme Court of

‘

Pakistan in “Nazir Ahmad vs The State
(2018 SCMR 787).

17. In the context of the present case,
the accused and his father was arrested on the
following day of the occurrence from their own
house. And obviously they could not register the
case in presence of the father of the deceased.
Therefore, there is no circumstance to infer
adversely from the conduct of the present
appellant.

18. The upshot of the above discussion
is that when we have excluded from
consideration the statements of both the alleged
eyewitnesses and have reached at the
conclusion that the only circumstance that

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-19-

the deceased was the wife of the appellant
and died unnatural death in his house alone
is not sufficient for his conviction, when
their were other family members both male
and female were jointly residing in the said
house, the present appellant did not abscond
from the place of occurrence as he was
arrested on the following day of the crime,
no incriminating material was recovered
from his possession after his arrest, lead us
to the conclusion that the Appellant is
entitled to the benefit of doubt. Hence, we
accept this appeal and set-aside the
impugned judgment passed by the learned
trial Court. Resultantly, the appellant is
acquitted of the charges leveled against him.
He is in custody and be set free if not
required in any other case.

19. These are the reasons of our
short order of even date.

20. Likewise, the connected

criminal revision bearing No. 4-M of 2018

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-20-

preferred by the State (petitioner) for
enhancement has become infructuous, which
is also accordingly dismissed.
