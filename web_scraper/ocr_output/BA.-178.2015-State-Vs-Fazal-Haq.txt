QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:-_ ‘This _ single

judgment/order is directed to also dispose of
Cr.M/BA. No.248-A/2015 titled Iqbal Khan Vs The
State & another and Cr.M/BCA. No. 189-A/2015
titled Talha Khan Vs The State & others, as all the
three petitions arise out of the same case vide FIR
No. 42 dated 17.01.2015 under sections
302/148/149/109 PPC Police Station Havelian,
Abbottabad.

2. The case was registered on the report
of Talha Khan, complainant, who reported to the
police in RHC Havelian to the effect that he
alongwith his father, Ilftikhar Ahmad, were
proceeding towards ‘Jamia-Masjid | Hasnain

Karimain’ for offering ‘Fajar’ (morning) prayers and
when reached Mohallah Tanoli near the house of
Amin at 06:00 AM they saw Iqbal, Matloob and
Mukhtar sons of Yaqgoob, Basit son of Iqbal, Mohsin
son of Javed and Aftab son of Aurangzeb residents
of Jadoon Abad armed with deadly weapons who
were recognized in the light of mobile phone of his
father as well as his own torch, and that on the
direction/command of Iqbal, accused/petitioner in
Cr.M/BA.No.248-A/2015, the accused/petitioner in
the instant bail petition opened fire at his father who
was hit on his chest and died on the spot. According
to the complainant, his uncle Wagar Ahmad also
reached the spot while proceeding for offering
prayers and witnessed the occurrence. However,
they both escaped unhurt, while all the accused
named in the FIR made good their escape from the
scene of occurrence. Complainant further stated
that inhabitants of the Mohallah were also attracted
to the spot on their hue and cry. The motive for the
occurrence was cited as civil dispute and criminal
cases between them and father of the
accused/petitioner in the instant bail petition,

namely Javed son of Wilayat Khan, who, allegedly,
instigated the accused for commission of the
offence.

3. The local police conducted
investigation, and after completion of investigation,
has since submitted complete challan in the case.
During investigation, the investigating officer (1.0.)
got conducted post-mortem examination of
deceased Iftikhar Ahmad through the medical
officer who found multiple firearm entry wounds on
the body of the deceased. The 1.0. secured blood
stained earth from the place of the deceased shown
in the site plan and seven crime empties of 30 bore
from the place assigned to accused/petitioner,
Mohsin Javed, in the site plan. The 1.0. also took
into possession a 20 volts Bulb in working condition
from the outer wall of Muhammad Amin. Likewise,
the mobile phone of the deceased and torch of the
complainant were also taken into possession. The
blood stained earth secured from the spot by the
1.0. and blood stained garments of the deceased
were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory
(FSL), wherefrom the result was received in the
affirmative. Similarly, three crime bullets in a plastic

bottle received by the 1.0. from the medical officer
were sent to the firearms expert, and the expert
opined that the crime bullets were of 30 bore and
were fired from 30 bore pistol. The 1.0. also secured
cell data of mobile phones recovered from
accused/respondents in Cr.M/BCA. No.189-A/2015.
The accused/respondents, namely, Matloob Khan,
Mukhtiar Ahmad, Basit Khan and Aftab Ahmad
have been released on bail by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-VI, Abbottabad vide his
order dated 06.03.2015, whereas the
accused/petitioners, Mohsin Javed and Iqbal Khan
have been declined bail by the Courts below, hence
these two separate petitions for their post arrest
bail.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for the
accused/petitioners, learned Addl: AG and learned
counsel for the complainant heard, and record
perused.

5. The main thrust of the arguments of
learned counsel for the accused/petitioners was that
net of the charge was thrown wide open to implicate
several male members of the family for the Qatle-
Amad of deceased Iftiknhar Ahmad caused by a

single person. The learned counsel urged that the
complainant had stated in his report that the
accused were recognized in the light of his torch
and mobile phone of his deceased father, without
mentioning light from the bulb on the outer wall of
nearby house of Amin mentioned in the FIR, which
has been taken into possession by the I.O.
Moreover, the said Amin and other people residing
near the spot and attracted after the occurrence
have stated in their statements under section 161
Cr.PC that they found dead body of the deceased
lying there and that they informed relatives of the
deceased about the occurrence, thereby implying
that neither the complainant, nor the eye-witness or
any other relative of the deceased was present with
the dead body.

6. The learned Addl: AG and learned
counsel for the complainant, on the other hand,
argued that all the accused were directly charged in
the FIR and specific role of effective fire and Qatl-i-
Amd was attributed to the accused/petitioner,
Mohsin Javed, and that of Lalkara/command to
accused/petitioner, Iqbal. They further contended
that the spot shown in the site plan were confirmed

through reports of FSL regarding blood stained
earth and blood stained garments and further report
of the firearms expert with regard to crime bullets.
They maintained that the eye-witness mentioned in
the FIR, Waqar Ahmad, had supported the FIR.
They concluded that there was strong motive for
commission of the offence, and that the deceased
had apprehended threats to his life through
applications to the police officer in his lifetime.

7. The record reveals that the report was
lodged by the complainant in the emergency ward
of RHC Havelian, where he had brought the dead
body of his father, within 50 minutes of the
occurrence, apparently, in a promptly lodged FIR by
all standards, wherein the accused/petitioner,
Mohsin Javed, has specifically been assigned the
role of firing at the deceased and causing his Qatl-i
Amd on the direction/command of co-accused Iqbal
and in the armed presence of rest of the accused.
The complainant has shown recognition of the
accused in the torch light as well as in the light of
the mobile phone of his father, besides the fact that
all the accused are co-villagers of the complainant
and the parties are locked in civil as well criminal

litigation. Besides, the motive emanating from civil
and criminal cases, alleged by the complainant in
the FIR, appears augmented by applications dated
29.10.2013, 10.10.2013 & 04.09.2013, moved by
the deceased to the local police officers, thereby
seeking protection against threats to his life from
the accused in the case owing to the stated cases
between them. These facts would go a long way to
establish a prima facie case against
accused/petitioner, Mohsin Javed, notwithstanding
statements of Muhammad Amin and_ others
recorded after almost 23 days of the occurrence,
though not mentioned as eye-witnesses in the FIR,
and showing presence of the dead body on the spot
when they came out of their nearby houses after the
commission of the offence. How for their testimony
is going to dislodge the version of the complainant
in the FIR and eye-witness account of PW Wagar
Ahmad mentioned in the FIR, is yet to be
determined during trial, and this is, obviously, not
the appropriate stage for deep appreciation of
evidence. Likewise, whether the bulb taken into
possession by the 1.0. from the outer wall of the
nearby house of Muhammad Amin was lit at the

time of occurrence and as to what would be its
bearing on the case of prosecution, is also
something to be determined at the trial stage. In any
case, the promptly lodged FIR, direct charge
against accused/petitioner, Mohsin Javed, together
with medical report, ocular account of the witness
mentioned in the FIR and other circumstantial
evidence, prima facie, connect the
accused/petitioner with the commission of the
offence. Therefore, the instant bail petition of the
accused/petitioner, Mohsin Javed, is dismissed.

8. However, the role assigned to the
accused/petitioner, Iqbal Khan in Cr.M No.248-
A/2015 is distinguishable, as he has been assigned
the role of Lalkara/command in the case, requiring
further inquiry into his role in the commission of the
offence. Therefore, his petition for post bail is
accepted, and he is admitted to bail subject to
furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.1, 00, O00/-
(one lac) with two sureties each in the like amount
to the satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate.
9. As regards petition for cancellation of
bail granted to accused/respondents, Matloob
Ahmad, Mukhtiar Ahmad, Basit Khan and Aftab

Ahmad, suffice it to say that they have been shown
present duly armed at the time of occurrence in the
FIR, with no role of firing either effectively or
ineffectively or doing anything towards the
commission of the offence. As to how for their
armed presence on the spot at the time of
occurrence contributed to the commission of the
offence making them liable under section
148/149/109 PPC is, certainly, subject to further
inquiry. They were, therefore, rightly extended the
concession of post arrest bail by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-VI, Abbottabad vide his
impugned order dated 06.03.2015. Additionally,
neither there is any allegation in the application for
cancellation of bail, nor anything has been brought
on record showing misuse of concession of bail by
them. Consequently, the petition for cancellation of

bail of the accused/respondents is dismissed.

Announced.
