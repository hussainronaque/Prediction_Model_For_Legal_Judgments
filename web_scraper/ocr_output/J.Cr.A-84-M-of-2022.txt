JUDGMENT

Dr. Khurshid Iqbal, J.-

1. This Jail Criminal Appeal is directed against the
judgment of the Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi-l,
Buner, dated 29.11.2021, whereby he convicted Mst. Rainaz
(the appellant-accused) and sentenced her as under:

“Under section 302 (b) PPC, to undergo imprisonment

for life for committing qatl-i-amd of Mst. Gul Meena;

Under section 544-A, Cr. P.C., to pay compensation to the
tune of Rs. 100,000/- to the legal heirs of the deceased or
in default, she was ordered to suffer imprisonment for six
months;

Under section 15-A.A., to undergo simple imprisonment
for one year with fine of
Rs. 5000/-, or in default thereof, she was ordered to suffer
one-month S.1,

All the sentences were ordered to be run concurrently. The
benefit of section 382-B, Cr. PC., was also extended to the

appellant-accused.

2. Facts of the case shortly are that on 26.07.2020,
the local police received information that the occurrence of a
murder has taken place in village Babakra Ghazi Banda.
Pursuant to such information, Sher Aman Khan ASI of Police

Station Gul Bandi (PW-6) rushed to the spot. He found the dead

HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Or. KHURSHID IQBAL

-2-
body of a woman by the name Mst. Gul Mena. The
complainant/husband of the deceased present there reported that
he had gone to the Bazar of Ghazi Banda where he was
informed by his mother Mst. Jehanzeba through a cell phone
call that his wife has been killed by someone with certain
firearm weapon. He came to his home and found his wife dead.
He stated that one year ago his wife Mst. Gul Mena had left her
house with her free will and contracted Court marriage with him
due to which her brother Bakhti Mand was unhappy. He alleged
that the aforesaid Bakhti Mand had threatened both of them
through cell phone calls for committing their murder. He
showed his satisfaction that his wife was killed by her brother
Bakhti Mand. Later on, the complainant, his mother and father
recorded their statements u/s. 164, Cr. P.C. and charged Mst.
Rainaz (the appellant-accused) for committing the murder of
Mst. Gul Mena. The appellant is the youngest real sister of the

complainant/husband of the deceased.

Ie

On 30.07.2020, the appellant-accused was
arrested by the local police and on the same day, she was
produced before the Judicial Magistrate for recording her
confessional statement. Afier recording her confessional
statement, she was charged for the commission of the offence
while her mother Mst. Jehan Zeba was charged u/s. 201, PPC,
for concealing the real facts. The case against one Bakhti Mand

was dropped.

4. After completion of investigation, challan was
submitted against the appellant-accused and co-accused before
the trial Court. Copies were supplied to them ws.
265-C, Cr. PC. Charge was farmed against them, to which they

pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

5. The prosecution examined as many as thirteen
(13) PWs. Statements of the appellant-accused and the other co-
accused u/s. 342, Cr. PC, were also recorded, in which they
were afforded an opportunity of evidence in defence and/or

statements on oath but they did not avail it.

6. After hearing the arguments, the trial Judge vide

the impugned judgment dated 29.11.2021, convicted the

"Abdul Sebeokl™ (0.B) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE Or. KHURSHID JOBAL

-3-
appellant-accused as mentioned in para-1 of this judgment while
acquitted the co-accused Mst. Jehan Zeba of the charge leveled

against her.

7. We have heard arguments of learned counsel for
the parties and the learned Additional Advocate General, for the

State and perused the record.

8. Admittedly, Amir Khan, husband of the deceased
Mst. Gul Mena/brother of the appellant-accused Mst. Rainaz,
charged Bakhti Mand, brother of the deceased for the
commission of the offence on 26.07.2020. The reason he
showed was that he and the deceased had contracted Court
marriage at which her brother Bakhti Mand and other family
members were unhappy and had threatened her of committing
her murder. It was on 29.07.2020, the third day of the
occurrence that the aforesaid complainant Amir Khan suddenly
changed his version by recording his supplementary statement
ws. 164, Cr. P.C., in which he charged the appellant-accused,
his younger real sister. He deposed in his statement that during
the investigation, the appellant-accused told to the police that
she was the culprit. He added in his statement that it was for this
reason that he became satisfied and was sure that the appellant-
accused had committed the murder of his wife and that Bakhti
Mand was innocent. He further explained that relation between
his wife and his sister remained strained and that both would
usually quarrel with each other. The complainant never
appeared before the Court at the trial. Challan was received in
the trial Court on 10.12.2020. Charge was framed against the
appellant-accused on 05.01.2021. The case was fixed for
evidence of the prosecution for 18.01.2021. Amir Aslam
appeared at the trial on 16.10.2021 but was not examined due to
illness of counsel for complainant. On 23.10.2021, the next date
of hearing, Mst. Bakht Sherina, mother of the deceased, was
examined and Amir Aslam was abandoned on that date in the
light of the statement of Mst. Bakht Sherina (PW-12). Except
the police officials, the prosecution examined Mst. Bakht
Sherina, mother of the deceased (PW-12) in support of her case.
However, it is worth mentioning that the prosecution examined

two other oral witnesses, namely, Abdullah (PW-9) and

Abdut Sebook!* (0.B) HON'‘SLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL

4.
Kashmalay (PW-10), who furnished evidence of the fact that
they are the neighbourers of the accused Bakhti Mand. PW-10
stated that he was present with him on the eventful day as he
was busy in construction of a wall in his house. Mst. Bakht
Sherina charged the appellant-accused for the commission of the
offence. She referred to her statement u/s. 164,
Cr. P.C. recorded during the investigation, in which she charged
her for the murder of her daughter ‘because the appellant-
accused and her mother were not happy with the marriage
between the deceased and Amir Khan and that both were usually
quarrelling with the deceased. While under cross-examination,
she admitted having never visited the house of her daughter, She
further admitted that she has never met other relatives of Amir
Khan, her son-in-law. She added on her own that the appellant-
accused and her mother, being unhappy with the marriage of the
deceased, used to quarrel with her. She admitted being not the
eyewitness of the occurrence. In such circumstances, the only
evidence on which the prosecution relied was the confession the
appellant-accused made, before Mr. Salman Ahmad, the Judicial
Magistrate on 30.07.2020, the next day of her nomination as
accused in the case. We shall, therefore, examine her
confessional statement in greater details. Needless to say, a
confessional statement is required to be proved that it was

voluntarily given and that it was truthful.

9. As stated above, the appellant-accused was
arrested on 30.07.2021. She was produced before the Judicial
Magistrate the same day with an application that she was willing
to record her confessional statement. A close reading of the
certificate the Judicial Magistrate appended to the confessional
statement would show that she was produced before him at
12:15, p.m. He stated to have explained the questions mentioned
in the questionnaire to the appellant-accused, at 12:30, p.m.,
after 15 minutes. Therefore, she was given 15 minutes more to
think over her decision to confess to her guilt. At 12:45, hours,
the same questionnaire was again explained to her what the
Judicial Magistrate observed to have his satisfaction about her
alleged voluntariness. At 12:50, hours, he recorded her
statement himself by means of a computer. The certificate

further shows that she gave her statement in Pushto, her mother

HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Or. KHURSHID IQBAL

-5-
tongue, which he himself recorded in Urdu by means of a
computer and later on read it to her by translating it into Pushto,
which she allegedly admitted as correct and then thumb
impressed. The certificate also reflects that it took 15 minutes to
be completed, at 1:05, p.m. It may be pertinent to reproduce her

statement as under:

10. The questionnaire put before her contained 15
questions in all. She negatively replied to the questions
regarding the inducement or threat from the police or any
promise that she will be made an accomplice in the case and
would be pardoned. She affirmatively answered to the questions
that she knew the man before her was a Judicial Magistrate; that
she was not compelled for recording her confessional statement;
she knew that if she recorded her confession, the same would be
used against her and she may be convicted to death or life
imprisonment; she would not be handed over back to the police,
rather would be sent to the judicial lock up; and, she was
recording her statement voluntarily without any compulsion.
She replied negatively to the question that she was induced, she
wanted to consult her relative or an Advocate, she was subjected
to physical or mental torture and that any of her relative
threatened her of dire consequences, if she refused to confess
her guilt. She was asked as to why she was making such a big
decision to confess to her guilt. She gave a short answer, stating
that she had committed the offence and she wanted to say the
truth. About her custody with the police, she stated that she

remained for one day in police custody.

Abdul Sabooki* (0.8) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR, JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL

-6-
i, To begin with, her card of arrest reflects that she
was stated to have been arrested at 09 a.m., on 30.07.2020.
Looking at her confessional statement, she remained in police
custody for one day. It means that she was arrested on
29.07.2020, the day when she was first nominated in the case.
This categorically indicates that she remained in police custody.
The Judicial Magistrate did not attend to this aspect of the case,
which has its significance for the requirement of voluntariness
in confessional statement. This aspect may be seen in
Juxtaposition to question No. 11 and her reply thereto, put to her
in her statement recorded u/s. 342, Cr. P.C. The aforesaid
question and its reply read as under:

“Q.No.11: It is in the evidence that investigating officer

vide application Ex PW 13/18 produced you accused in

the Court of Judicial Magistrate, wherein you have

made a volunteer confessional statement which is placed

on file in shape of questionnaire Ex PW = 13/1,

confessional statement Ex PW 13/2, certificate Ex PW

13/3 and Court order Ex PW 13/4, respectively,

whereby you have admitted your guilt in the Court.
What do you say about it?

Ans. It is incorrect. On the day of arrest just after my

arrest, | was produced before an Authority stated by the

police to be the DSP Investigation.”
The trial Court also ignored this material aspect of the
confessional statement that she resiled from her confession by
furnishing the answer that the question was incorrect and then
added that she was arrested one day before her confessional
statement and was produced before a higher police official who
was shown to be a DSP Investigation. We would further observe
that though the Judicial Magistrate put the questions to her
rather, twice, he appears to have neither read the record nor
delved deep into the matter to ascertain whether the statement

was in fact true and voluntary.

12. As observed above, the Judicial Magistrate
hurriedly obtained the answers to the questions (within 15
minutes) without giving her time to think over her decision at a
stretch. In other words, the recording of answers to the questions
so quickly left her with no opportunity for thinking, rather, it
may be said that she could not get a proper opportunity to
understand the questions, to think over each one of them and

thereafter to tender her replies. Our concern is that even if the

Abdul Sebook!™ (0.B) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE Or. KHURSHID IOBAL

-7-
questions were explained to her, her replies should not have
been recorded instantaneously. Being a young and illiterate girl,
she could not have been expected to have understood and fully
comprehended the questions and the serious implications of her
replies, which resulted in her conviction at the conclusion of the
trial. In order to ensure the truthfulness of her statement, the
Judicial Magistrate did not take an opportunity to himself
judiciously understand as to whether: firstly, she was capable of
making firing with a pistol. Secondly, where and how did she
find the pistol? Thirdly, where, when and from whom she had
learnt to fire with a pistol? Fourthly, whether the domestic
quarrels between the womenfolk in a house could be
comprehended as ineffective because that will provoke a woman
of such a tender age to take such a serious decision? Fifthly, her
mother was also present in the house at the relevant time.
Sixthly, usually the elder one in the house, particularly the
mother of the appellant-accused, would quickly and rather
commandingly intervene and resolve even a verbal altercation
between younger women in the house. These aspects of the case
should have been considered by the Judicial Magistrate, while
he got involved with the appellant-accused when explaining the
questions to her, the background and the reasons in which she
was moving forward to record her confessional statement. Then
the trial Court was having greater responsibility to have a
demonstrable judicial understanding of the above aspects of the
case, most particularly, when there is no other independent,
impartial and confidence inspiring corroborative evidence in

support of the confession.

13. The law of confession is well defined and

thoroughly researched in authoritative judicial opinions. In

Hashim Qasim and another v. The State (2017 SCMR 986), it

was held:

“The confession of appellant, Khayam Khurshid,
recorded on 9.3.2007 by the Magistrate, namely, Shah
Waliullah (PW-15) is the most suspicious piece of
evidence in the whole case, besides having been
retracted one. It might be right, as was argued by the
learned counsel for the complainant, that retracted
confession, if corroborated by independent evidence of
reliable nature, can be made basis for conviction on a
capital charge but it must be subject to the above
cardinal principles.”

Abdul Sahook!* (0.8) HON’BLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL

8.
e In the case titled as Muhammad Ismail and
others v. The State (2017 SCMR 898), it was observed:

“The only other piece of evidence remaining in the field
was a judicial confession allegedly made by Muhammad
Iqrar, Khalid Hussain and Shakir Ali appellants before
a Magistrate under Section 164, Cr.P.C. but admittedly
the said judicial confession had been retracted by the
appellants before the trial Court and in the absence of
any independent corroboration such retracted judicial
confession could not suffice all by itself for recording or
upholding the appellants’ convictions.”

14, Coming to the site plan, the record reflects that it
was prepared on 26.07.2020 at the instance of the complainant.
On 30.07.2020, point No. 5 was added after nomination and on
arrest of the appellant-accused. In this respect, the I.O. in his
statement recorded as PW-13 stated that on 30.07.2020, he
arresied the appellant-accused Mst. Rainaz and issued her card
of arrest. On the same day, she led the police to the place of the
occurrence in the presence of a lady constable and pointed out
her place of presence at the time of the occurrence. In this
respect, he prepared a memo of disclosure (‘pointation’ as it is
ordinarily called) and has also made addition of point No. 5 with

red ink in the site plan already prepared.

15. Two points are worth consideration: firstly, it is
not clear at which time exactly the appellant-accused made
pointation of the place of the occurrence. According to the card
of arrest, she was arrested at 09 a.m. It appears she might have
led the IO to the place of the occurrence for the disclosure
between 09 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. when at the latter point of time,
she was produced before the Judicial Magistrate for recording
her confessional statement. Here again, we would refer to the
statement of the appellant-accused that she was produced one
day after her arrest. Secondly, the disclosure by the appellant-
accused could not be considered as discovery for the reason that
the site plan was already prepared on 26.07.2020 by the 1.0. So,
he was aware about it. The police investigators have recently
started this practice under the garb of discovery within the
meaning of Article 40 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order (QSO),
1984. This practice is totally wrong and illegal under the QSO.
Perhaps, the investigators tend to present it like a confession of

the accused which is not allowed under Article 39 QSO. No

Abdul Sabooh{* (0.8) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON‘BLE MA. JUSTICE Or. KHURSHIO JOBAL

-9-
doubt the provision of Article 40 provides that so much of such
information as is brought to light in consequence of discovery,
may be proved. Arguably, the information obtained in such a
manner, as is the situation in the case in hand, does not attract
the application of Article 40. The reason is that this does not
amount to discovery as the IO had already seen the scene of the
Occurrence and prepared its site plan. Mere taking of the
accused to the same place and verifying from her the place of
her presence and other details are not sufficient. Legally, such
evidence is inadmissible and should, in no case, be allowed to
be brought on the record, let alone believing in it. In a recent
Judgment, the Supreme Court has expressed serious concern
about it in a case titled as Hayatullah vs. the State (2018
SCMR 2092). The gravity of the concern could be ascertained
from the Court’s remarks that without attending to this aspect of
a case:

“(Indicates ignorance of the basic provisions of the law
on the part of Prosecutor, defence Counsel and the
learned trial Judge. It also indicates the lack of control

of the learned presiding officer over the proceedings
being conducted by him.”

The Hon’ble Court has observed that:

“After making such disclosure before the
police no new fact was discovered because it is
already in the knowledge of the police on
11.02.2006 that the deceased had received a
bullet injury and from the place of occurrence
an empty of 30 bore pistol was also recovered.
So, the recovery of pistol after the said
disclosure was not a new fact or not a fact
which was not in the knowledge of police. [...}
disclosure is worthless, irrelevant and
inadmissible as the said place was already in
the knowledge of the police and a site plan of
the same place had already been prepared on
11.02.2006.”

Thus, the disclosure is not covered under Articles 39/40 QSO. In

such circumstances the recovery of pistol, the empty and the

FSL report are of no legal value.

16. As sequel to our above discussion, we have
reached to the irresistible conclusion that the prosecution has
failed to prove the charge beyond reasonable shadow of doubt

against the appellant-accused. Thus, while allowing the instant

Abdul Sabsoki* (0.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Or, KHURSHID IOBAL

-10-
appeal, we acquit the appellant-accused Mst. Rainaz from the
charge leveled against her by setting aside the impugned
judgment dated 29.11.2021 recorded by the Additional Sessions
Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi-I, Buner. She be released forthwith, if not

required in any other case.

17. These are the reasons of our short order of the
even date. |
