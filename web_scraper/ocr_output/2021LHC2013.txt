6. After giving up Muhammad Yasin Constable being
unnecessary and producing the report of Punjab Forensic Science
Agency Lahore (PE) prosecution’s evidence was closed by learned
ADPP.

7. In her examination made under Section 342 Cr.P.C,
appellant pleaded her false involvement in this case. She opted not
to produce defence evidence or to appear in terms of Section
340(2) Cr.P.C.

8. Learned counsel for appellant contends that while examining
the appellant under Section 342 Cr.P.C, the report of chemical
examiner was not put to her and this defect is not curable under the
law, therefore on this score alone she is entitled for acquittal.

9. On the other hand, learned DDPP contends that point raised
is technical in nature and for that omission the conviction recorded
by learned Trial Court cannot be declared invalid.

10. Heard.

11. For effective discussion on the proposition before us,

Section 342 Cr. PC is reproduced as under: -
Cri. A. No.05 of 2021/RWP 3

“342. Power to examine the accused: (1)
For the purpose of enabling the accused
to explain any circumstances appearing
in the evidence against him, the Court
may, at any stage of any inquiry or trial
without previously warning the accused,
put such questions to him as the Court
considers necessary, and shall, for the
purpose aforesaid, question him
generally on the case after the witnesses
for the prosecution have been examined
and before he is called on for his
defence:

12. Under the above said provisions, it is the duty of trial Court
to examine the accused. Power to examine an accused under the
settled principles of law is not mere a formality but a mandate to
enable an accused to explain any circumstance, appearing against
him in evidence. During this exercise every piece of evidence
which can be used against appellant for the purpose of conviction
is required to be put to him, so he may in a position to respond
thereto. Every piece of evidence certainly includes the
documentary evidence also. Said examination of accused is based
on the principles involved in maxi “Audi Alteram Partem” that
means ‘no one should be condemned unheard’. These
circumstances to be put to accused are also called ‘incriminate
pieces of evidence’. The word incriminating means “a material
that has harmful effect”. Therefore, deviation from said duty shall

render the conviction invalid.

13. The honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan in ‘Din
Muhammad vs. The Crown 1969 SCMR 777’ was pleased to
observe as under: -

“In reaching these conclusions the
learned Judges have not considered a
material defect in the proceedings viz.
that three of the circumstances from
Cri. A. No.05 of 2021/RWP

which they were drawing inferences
adverse to the appellant had not been put
to him when he was questioned under
section 342, Cr. P. C by the committing
Magistrate and the Sessions Judge. No
question was put to him in respect of the
evidence of PW-3 about the reply he was
said to have given the witness when
asked about the whereabouts of the
deceased or the evidence of PW-7 or that
of PW-16. The circumstances spoken to
by these witnesses even if accepted as
proved, can be made the basis of an
adverse inference against the appellant
only on the ground that he had no
satisfactory explanation for them, but the
possibility of his having been able to give
an explanation though not convincing at
least plausible enough to create a
reasonable doubt cannot reasonably be
excluded. The importance of the
examination of the accused under section
342, Cr. P. C has been pointed out by
their Lordships of the' Privy Council as
well as by this Court in more than one
decision, and it is unfortunate that the
learned Judges overlooked this serious
omission”

14. In “Munir Ahmad alias Munni vs. the State 2001 SCMR 56

again it was observed that: -

“The matter does not end here. No
question with regard to _ this
incriminating piece of evidence was put
to the appellant during his examination
under section 342, Cr.P.C. This is
undoubtedly quite strange. In laws, if an
incriminating piece of evidence is not put
to an accused and it has resulted in
causing prejudice to the accused the
same shall not be considered as evidence
against him”

15. We have perused the examination of appellant recorded by

learned Trial Court where in question No. 5 only there is mention

of sending the sample to PFSA but by stretch of no imaginations

report of PFSA (PE) was put to her through any question for
*Sharif

Cri. A. No.05 of 2021/RWP 5

enabling her to explain that piece of evidence. Omission, therefore,
is not curable under the law and has caused miscarriage of justice.

16. In view of above, this Criminal Appeal is allowed.
Impugned judgment dated 19.12.2020 passed by learned Trial
Court is set aside and appellant is acquitted from the case. She is
in custody and she shall be released forthwith if not required in any
other case. The case property shall be dealt with in the manners as

directed by the learned Trial Court.
