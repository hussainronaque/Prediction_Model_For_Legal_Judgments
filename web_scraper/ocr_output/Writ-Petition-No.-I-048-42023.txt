Article 199 of The Constitution of Islamic

Through the instant petition filed under

Republic of Pakistan, 1973, petitioners namely

(Jamil) (DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
Gul Khan and Bakht Rawan seek the quashment
of an FIR registered against them with the
following prayer:-

“On acceptance of the instant writ
petition, FIR No.193 dated 09.08.2023
under section 409, 379, 411, 34 PPC
may graciously be ordered to be
quashed, being illegal, and against the
law, without jurisdiction, and any
other relief which would be deemed fit
and proper in the circumstances of the
case may also be granted to the
petitioners.”

and through the connected writ petition
No.1047-A/2023 filed under Article 199 of The
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan,
1973, petitioner namely Khawaja Akbar seeks
the custody of the vehicle which was taken into
possession by the local police in the instant FIR
as a case property with the following prayer:-

“On acceptance of the instant writ
petition, the vehicle in question, may
graciously be ordered to be handed
over to the petitioner. Any other relief
which this honourable court deems fit

and necessary, keeping in view the

(Jamil) (DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
. Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
circumstances of the case may also be
granted.”

3. Precisely, the facts of the case as per
contents of the instant petition are that petitioner
No.1 is a civil servant/public servant and is
since being performing his duties as Chowkidar
at Government Primary School Ranwaliya
Kohistan, whereas petitioner No.2 is a private
person (which fact is wrongly mentioned in the
petition as as per record petitioner No.2 namely
Bakht Rawan is a civil servant, whereas
petitioner No.1 namely Gul Khan is a private
person). It was on 26.08.2022 that due to
unprecedented flood, the said school got
damaged, as all its construction has razed to the
ground so as per direction of the principal
concerned, petitioners were going to shift iron
sheets and other materials from the premises of
the school to a safe place when in the meanwhile

the local police raided the school premises,

(Jamil) (DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
arrested both the petitioners and registered the
instant case FIR No.193 dated 09.08.2023 under
sections 409/379/41 1/34 PPC.

4. Thereafter petitioners approached to the
local Magistrate for the grant of bail, however, he
refused to entertain bail application of the
petitioners on the ground that since as one of the
accused is a civil servant and thus the matter
relates to the Anti-Corruption Establishment. In
view of the above, respondent No.2 sent the case
file to respondent No.3 i.e. Circle Officer Anti-
Corruption Establishment Mansehra for
proceeding with the investigation/enquiries of
the case. Thereafter the petitioners under
compulsion approached to the court of Special
Judge, Anti-Corruption for the grant of bail,
however, who too expressed its lack of
jurisdiction due to there being no FIR registered
by the Anti-Corruption Establishment against

the petitioners, therefore, their application was

(Jamil) (DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
Ye

dismissed being withdrawn. Now the petitioners
have approached to this court for the quashment
of the aforesaid FIR and as an interim relief for
the grant of bail.

5. When this case was taken up for hearing,
notices were issued to the respondents and today
arguments of the learned counsel for the parties
were heard in considerable detail and record
perused with their valuable assistance.

6.  Perusal of the record would indicate that
petitioner No.2 namely Bakht Rawan is a
civil/public servant, while petitioner No.1
namely Gul Khan is a private person, whereas
the local police of Police Station Dobair District
Kohistan has registered an FIR against the
petitioners under sections 409/379/411/34 PPC
and thereafter the present petitioners approached
to the learned Judicial Magistrate for the grant of
bail, however, he refused to entertain their bail
application and referred the matter to the Anti-

Corruption Establishment. In view of the above,

(Jamil) (DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
the petitioners also approached to the Special
Judge, Anti-Corruption (Provincial), however,
since till that date, no FIR was registered by the
Anti-Corruption Establishment, therefore, he
too, showed his inability to entertain their bail
application and when the petitioners were
confronted and meted out with the aforesaid
situation, they under compulsion have
approached to this court for the quashment of
the instant FIR and as interim relief have prayed
for the grant of bail which has already been
granted to them by this court vide order dated
19.09.2023.

7. It is an admitted fact that petitioner No.2
is a civil servant and he has been charged for the
offences as punishable under _ sections
409/379/411/34 PPC, therefore, it is to be seen
that as to whether an FIR can be registered or
not in ordinary Police Station against a civil
servant/public servant who has allegedly

committed an offence(s) which is/are found

(Jamil) (DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
~

mentioned in the Schedule attached to The West
Pakistan Anti-Corruption Establishment
Ordinance, 1961 (hereinafter called the
Ordinance of 1961).

8. In order to answer the above question, it
would be appropriate to reproduce the Preamble
and relevant provisions of the Ordinance of
1961 which are as under:

“Preamble. Whereas it is expedient to
provide for the constitution of a special
agency for the investigation of certain
offences relating to corruption by public

Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
Section 3. Constitution and powers of

offence shall be investigated or
departmental inquiries into the conduct
of any public servant concerned in such
offences shall be held;

(2)...

(3)...

(4) Subject to any orders or rules
which Government may make in this
behalf, the [Director General], officers
and members of the Establishment

shall, for the purpose of any preliminary
enquiry or investigation under_ this

Ordinance have _ throughout _ the
Province of West Pakistan all the
powers of search, arrest of persons and

seizure of property and all other powers,

the offences mentioned in the Schedule,

exercise any of the powers of the officer

meaning of clause (p) of sub-section (1)
of section 4 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898, in the area in which he
is for the time being posted, and charge
of a police station discharging the
functions of such an officer within the

Limits of this station.”

Similarly, The Schedule to the Ordinance
of 1961 is also reproduced below for ready

reference:

THE SCHEDULE

(a) Offences punishable under sections
161 to 166, 168, 217 and 218 of the
Pakistan Penal Code and as attempts,
abetments and conspiracies in relation
thereto or connected therewith.

(b) Offences punishable _under_ sections
186 to 188, 189, 201, 332, 353, 379 to
382, 403 to 409, 411, 417 to 420, 465
to 468, 471 and 477-A of the Pakistan
Penal Code, and as_ attempts,
abetments and conspiracies in relation
thereto or connected therewith, when
committed by any public servant as
such, or by any person acting jointly
with or abetting or attempting to abet

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
10

or acting in conspiracy with any
public servant as such; and

(c)Offences punishable under the
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947
and as attempts, abetments and
conspiracies in relation thereto or
connected therewith.

The aforesaid Preamble of the Ordinance
of 1961 and its provisions unmistakably speak
that the said law was enacted by the Legislature
to constitute a special agency for the
investigation of certain offences relating to
corruption by public servants. The term Public
Servant has also been defined in section 2 of the
Ordinance of 1961 which reads that a Public
servant means a public servant as defined in
section 21 of the Pakistan Penal Code, whereas
subsection (1) of section 3 of the Ordinance of
1961, mandates (which provisions of law is also a
non-obstante clause and thus is having a super
imposing effect) that the Government may
constitute an establishment to be known as the

Anti-Corruption Establishment, for the

(Jamil) (DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
11

investigation of offences set forth in the
Schedule and the appended Schedule therein
would show different offences which offences
are to be investigated by the Anti-Corruption
Establishment where all the offences for which
the present petitioners are charged i.e. sections
409, 379, 411 of the Pakistan Penal Code, are
specifically mentioned, therefore, the case of the
petitioners absolutely qualifies the aforesaid
mandatory requirement of the Ordinance of
1961 and thus in such state of affairs, an FIR
could only be registered by the Anti-Corruption
Establishment and not by an ordinary Police

Station.

9. It is also relevant to mention here that the
Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa while
exercising powers conferred upon it under
section 6 of the Ordinance of 1961 has also
made Rules namely “the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Anti-Corruption Establishment Rules, 1999”

(hereinafter called the Rules of 1999) where a

special procedure has been provided for the
enquiry/investigation of the offences for which a
public servant is charged. Rules 3, 4 and 10 of
the same being relevant are reproduced as

4. Registration of cases/arrest__of

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
14

specified below if the arrest is so

required during the investigation:-

(a) Public Servants upto BPS-16 -
-- Director

(b) Public Servants in PBS-17 &
above --- Chief Secretary

Provided that no prior permission
shall be necessary for the arrest of a
public servant caught as a result of a
trap as mentioned in the last proviso to
sub-rule (2) of Rule-4

10. Police Station of Establishment.

Cases shall be registered by the
Establishment at the Police Station of

the _ Establishment __ having _ the
jurisdiction.

The aforesaid Rules provide a total
different procedure for the investigation of
criminal cases as against the procedure as
provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1898 as the aforesaid Rules mandate that
preliminary inquiry/investigation shall be initiated
by the Establishment upon a complaint and the
Director Anti-Corruption Establishment has to

direct a preliminary enquiry and the same is to

(Jamil) (DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
15

be followed by an open enquiry and if any case
is made out against a public servant on the basis
of materials collected during these enquiries,
then Director has to accord sanction for the
registration of the case and such cases are to be
registered by the Anti-Corruption Establishment
at the Police Station of the Establishment having
the jurisdiction, therefore, with such mandate of
the law, .the local police of ordinary Police
Stations other than the Police Station of Anti-
Corruption Establishment are not authorized to
registered an FIR again a civil/public servant for
certain offences as set forth in the Schedule
attached to the Ordinance of 1961. It is settled
since long that whenever the law requires
something to be done in a particular mode and
manner then it must be done in that mode and
manner or else it will lose its sanctity.

10. Now adverting to the facts of this case
since petitioner No.2 is a civil servant/public
servant and he has allegedly committed offences

which are punishable under _ sections

(Jamil) (DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
16

409/379/411 PPC which offences are duly
mentioned in the Schedule attached to the
Ordinance of 1961 and then the instant FIR has
been registered in the ordinary Police Station
namely Police Station Dobair District Kohistan,
therefore, the subject FIR has illegally and
unlawfully been registered and thus the same
cannot legally sustain. This court in the case
titled “Haji ROOH-UL-AMIN vs. SAEED and
others” reported as 2018 PCr.LJ 50, has
categorically held that where a_ civil
servant/public servant is charged for any
offence(s) which is/are found mentioned in the
Schedule appended to the Ordinance of 1961
then such an FIR could not be registered in the
ordinary Police Station and the same has to be
registered by the Police Station of Anti-
Corruption Establishment. It has further been
held in the aforesaid case that a special
procedure of enquiry has been provided under
the Ordinance of 1961 and the Rules of 1999

where on receiving a complaint, the Director

(Jamil) (DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
17

would sanction the initiation of preliminary
enquiry and then of open enquiry and then if any
material is collected during the enquiry then
Director has to accord sanction for the
registration of FIR. Similarly, in the case titled
“Dr. ISHTIAQ HUSSAIN and_ another vs.
SPECIAL JUDGE ANTI-CORRUPTION

(PROVINCIAL), RAWALPINDI DIVISION,
RAWALPINDI and 3 others” reported as 2004

YLR_716, it has been held that The West
Pakistan Anti-Corruption Establishment
Ordinance, 1961 is in addition to other laws for
the time being in force and thus provides the
special procedure for the registration of FIR
with respect to certain offences mentioned in the
Schedule. It has further been held that when the
law had prescribed a particular manner and
procedure in which things were required to be
done, same must be done in that way and not
otherwise at all. In the case titled “BASHIR
AHMAD ys. THE STATE” reported as 2002

MLD 746, it was held that where the complaint,

(Jamil) (DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
investigation report or other steps either in
lodging an FIR or prosecution of criminal case,
were patently against the provisions of law or
otherwise, no case could possibly be made out,
then High Court had been clothed with the
jurisdiction to quash the same as no useful
purpose would be served to keep the matter
lingering on.

11. In view of the above discussions, the
instant FIR No.193 dated 09.08.2023 under
sections 409/379/411/34 PPC has since been
illegally and unlawfully registered by the local
police of Police Station Dobair District
Kohistan, therefore, this Writ Petition No.1048-
A/2023 is allowed and consequently the instant
FIR (detailed above) is quashed and the same
shall have no legal effect against the present
petitioners. Bail bonds furnished by the
petitioners in consequence of the bail granting
order of this court dated 19.09.2023 stand
cancelled and sureties thereof are also

discharged from their liability.

(Jamil) (DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
12. As far as the connected writ petition
No.1047-A/2023 for the custody of vehicle
bearing Registration No.D-830, Engine No.218,
Chassis No. YN850042368, is concerned, since
we have allowed the instant Writ Petition
No.1048-A/2023 and have quashed the FIR in
question, therefore, the subject vehicle which
was taken into possession by the local police in
the instant FIR, is no more a case property of the

aforesaid FIR for the time being.

13. Accordingly, the connected writ petition
No.1047-A/2013 titled “Khawaja Akbar vs. The
State” is also allowed and SHO Police Station
Dobair District Kohistan is directed to hand over
the possession of the subject vehicle bearing
Registration No.D-830, Engine No.218, Chassis
No.YN850042368 to petitioner Khawaja Akbar
son of Malik Dostum Khan resident of
Ranwaliya, Pattan Kohistan forthwith upon

receipt of attested copy of this order.

(Jamil) (DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.

14. Before parting with this judgment, it
may be clarified that the Anti-Corruption
Establishment shall not be prejudiced with
the aforesaid findings and they may proceed
with the enquiry/investigation of the case
against the present petitioners as per the
provisions of the Ordinance of 1961 and the
Rules of 1999 made thereunder or any other

relevant law on the subject.
