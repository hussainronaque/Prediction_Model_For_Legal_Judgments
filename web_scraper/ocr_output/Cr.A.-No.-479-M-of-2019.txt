JUDGMENT
WIQAR AHMAD, J.- Appellant namely Johar Ali
has called in question judgment dated 15.10.2019 of
the Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge/Model
Criminal Trial Court Malakand at Batkhela, vide
which the appellant was convicted and sentenced as
follows;

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
e U/S 302 (b) PPC to life imprisonment along with
compensation of Rs. 300,000/- (three hundred
thousand) under section 544-A Cr.P.C, payable to
legal heirs of the deceased. In default of payment
of compensation, the appellant was ordered to
further undergo six months simple imprisonment.
The compensation was ordered to be recoverable
as arrears of land revenue.

e U/S 324 PPC to five years rigorous imprisonment
along with fine of Rs. 100,000/-, or in default
thereof to suffer four months simple
imprisonment. The fine was ordered to be
recoverable as arrears of land revenue.

e All the sentences were ordered to run
concurrently.

e Appellant was also extended benefit of section
382-B Cr.P.C.

2. Appellant faced trial in the case registered
vide FIR No. 415 dated 15.12.2014 under sections 302,
324 PPC at Levy Post Dargai District Malakand, on the
basis of ‘Murasila’ (Ex. PW-5/1) sent by Aziz-ur-
Rehman, IHC (PW-5) on 15.12.2014. Complainant
namely Amjad Ali (PW-7) lodged report of the
occurrence at emergency ward of Dargai hospital by
stating that on the day of occurrence he along with his
brother namely Wajid Ali (deceased) were going to their
house, after offering of /sha prayers. As soon as the
complainant-party reached near the house of one
Hazrat Muhammad, the appellant namely Johar Ali
started firing upon them. Due to firing of appellant his
brother Wajid Ali got hit on his right eyebrow/face,
while the complainant escaped un-hurt. Motive behind

the occurrence was stated to be that his other brother

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
namely Jawad Ali had recorded his statement as a
witness in an earlier criminal case registered against the
appellant, due to which he had been feeling annoyed.

3. Since accused/appellant was _ initially
avoiding his lawful arrest, therefore proceedings under
section 512 Cr.P.C were initiated against him. During the
course of investigation, the Investigating Officer
recovered six empty shells of Kalashnikov from the spot
vide recovery memo Ex. PW-5/4 dated 15.12.2014. He
also prepared site plan Ex. PW-5/3 on pointation of the
complainant, and took in possession blood stained earth
from place of the deceased vide recovery memo Ex. PW-
5/5 dated 15.12.2014. He also took in possession a bulb
100 watt from the spot vide recovery memo Ex. PW-5/6
dated 15.12.2014. The Investigating Officer also took in
possession blood stained garments of the deceased vide
recovery memo Ex. PW-5/8 dated 20.12.2014.
The recovered items were sent to Forensic
Science Laboratory (hereinafter referred to as “FSL”)
for the purpose of chemical analysis and
comparison, wherefrom report Ex.PW-5/18 was
received and placed on file. He submitted challan
under section 512 Cr.P.C against the appellant on
14.01.2015. Evidence was recorded under section
512 Cr.P.C and accused/appellant was declared

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
proclaimed offender vide judgment dated 08.05.2015
of the Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge
Malakand at Dargai.
4. Appellant was arrested on 08.08.2017, on
whose pointation the Investigating Officer made
necessary additions in the already prepared site plan
vide pointation memo Ex. PW-5/15 dated 10.08.2017.
On completion of investigation, supplementary challan
was submitted against the appellant before learned trial
Court. After compliance of proceedings of section
265-C Cr.P.C, charge was framed against him on
13.11.2017 to which he pleaded “not guilty” and
claimed trial. Prosecution produced as many as eight
(08) witnesses, whose statements were recorded and
placed on file. On conclusion of proceedings in the
case, accused was examined under section 342 Cr.P.C.
The learned trial Court convicted and sentenced the
appellant vide impugned judgment dated 15.10.2019
of the Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge
Malakand at Batkhela, as stated earlier.

Feeling aggrieved from his conviction
and sentences, accused/appellant has filed the instant
appeal before this Court while complainant has also

filed connected Criminal Revision No. 112-M of 2019

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
for enhancement of the sentences awarded to
accused/respondent.

5. Learned counsel for appellant submitted
during the course of his arguments that presence of
complainant was not believable at the relevant time as
he had not accompanied the deceased then injured to
the hospital. In this regard, he referred to the initial
report of medical examination brought in evidence as
Ex. PW-1/1 wherein the injured had been shown by
the doctor to have been accompanied by one Israr
(PW-6) when he had first been brought to the hospital.
The learned counsel also stated that complainant while
deposing as PW-7 had also brought certain dishonest
improvements in his statement which had further
rendered his evidence unreliable. The learned counsel
also argued that prosecution have not been able to
prove commission of the offence in the mode and
manner as stated in first report of the occurrence
as well as statement of the eyewitness while deposing
in Court as PW-7. In this regard, he referred to
statement of the doctor who had _ conducted
postmortem examination of the deceased and whose
statement has been recorded as PW-3. He added that

Kalashnikov has been stated by the complainant to

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
have been used in the occurrence but the metallic
pieces shown stuck up in brainstem has made the
mode and manner of occurrence doubtful. He added
that, had the appellant fired at the deceased from a
distance of 7/8 paces the bullet would have crossed the
body through and through. In order to bolster his
arguments, he placed reliance upon the judgments
reported as 2020 SCMR 319, 2021 P Cr.LJ 373, 2021
YLR 52, 2021 YLR 95 and 2021 P Cr. LJ 479.

6. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of
the complainant started his arguments by referring to
the earlier complaint lodged by the deceased against
accused (Ex. PD), in order to explain motive for
commission of the offence. He also stated that injury
to the deceased might have been caused through a
rebound bullet or its pieces, but narration of the path of
bullet and the fact of its rebound, could not be
expected from the complainant, in such circumstances.
He added that the prosecution have been able to prove
that the appellant had made firing at the deceased as a
result of which the deceased had received firearm
injury and had died subsequently. In support of his
assertions, he relied upon the judgments reported as

2011 SCMR 429, 2016 SCMR 2152, 2020 SCMR 595,

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
2013 YLR 895,2019 YLR 1109, 2020 YLR 1423, 2021
SCMR 298, 2020 YLR 654 and 2021 P Cr.L.J 705.
The learned Astt: A.G appearing on behalf of State
also adopted the arguments of learned counsel for
complainant.

7. We have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the parties, learned Astt: A.G. appearing on
behalf of State and perused the record.

8. Perusal of record reveals that eyewitness
account of the occurrence has been offered by the
complainant while deposing in Court as PW-7. The
supporting evidence of last seen has been offered by
Israr Ahmad while deposing as PW-6. The other
corroboratory evidence shall however be discussed
later. The complainant while deposing as PW-7 has
stated that he along with his brother namely Wajid Ali
(deceased then alive) had gone to the nearby mosque
for offering Jsha prayers. When they left the mosque
they also met the other PW namely Israr, whereafter he
and his brother moved towards their house. When they
reached the house of one Hazrat Muhammad, the
appellant namely Johar Ali made firing on them and on
turning towards him, his brother received injury on his

right eye. He has further narrated taking of the injured

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
to the hospital and his onward referral to the hospital at
Mardan and then to Lady Reading Hospital
(hereinafter referred as “LRH’”), etc. In his cross-
examination he was confronted with his _ initial
report wherein it could not be found mentioned that on
getting out of the mosque they had met PW Israr and
that firing had been made upon them from their back.
He also stated that it had been correct that the actual
animosity had been existing between the appellant and
brother of the PW Jawad Ali and added that the
appellant had also made firing on said Jawad Ali. He
also stated that he along with the deceased then alive
as well as Israr had performed /sha prayers in
congregation. He was not able to tell whether rapid
firing had been made or whether firing had been made
in a single mode of fire. He also stated that the injured
had remained at the spot for about 20/30 minutes
during which time they had been taking him to end of
the street and then had put him in a vehicle so as to
take him to the hospital. Regarding the injuries
he has stated that the deceased had received 2/3
injuries. Further ahead in his cross-examination the
witness has also stated that he had not accompanied
the deceased then injured to the hospital

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
at Mardan or Peshawar and added that other brothers
namely Jawad and Bakhti Zaman had accompanied
him.

9. The other witness namely Israr had
though not been an eyewitness but he has stated that he
had offered Isha prayers with the complainant and the
deceased and had stayed at a grocery store near the
mosque while the deceased and complainant left for
their house. On hearing sound of fire shots he had
immediately rushed towards the place of occurrence
and seen the appellant duly armed with Kalashnikov,
running towards the shops, as well as the deceased
lying in injured condition due to receipt of fire shots.
In his cross-examination, the witness stated that the
Investigating Officer had recorded his statement on the
night of occurrence at about 21:30/21:45 hours. While
he was confronted with his statement recorded under
section 161 Cr.P.C it was not found therein that he had
stated to the Investigating Officer that he had
exchanged greetings (e+) with the complainant and
his brother after offering prayers and that he had
remained in the grocery store, as well as mentioning of
presence of Naveed Ali, brother of the complainant.
He has stated in his cross-examination that the

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-10-

deceased and complainant had been living in same
house which was situated at a distance 15/20 meters
from the mosque. He stated that the deceased had
remained on the spot for 10/15 minutes. He also stated
that when they reached the mosque for offering
prayers the deceased and complainant had been present
in the mosque already. Complainant has however
stated that all the three had entered the mosque
together.

10. Presence of the complainant cannot be
doubted just for the reason that the doctor had, in his
report of initial examination of the injured, stated that
injured had been accompanied by Israr (PW-6). The
doctor was not supposed to and he could not have
mentioned all the people who had accompanied the
injured to the hospital. The occurrence had taken
place close to house of the deceased and beside Israr
he might have been accompanied by a number of
people including the neighbors, but all of them could
not have been mentioned by the doctor, and that also in
such an emergency. He was not supposed to document
presence of the PWs but to give emergency treatment
to the injured who had by then been critically injured.

They had gone for offering /sha prayers in the nearby

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-l1ll-

mosque situated at a distance 15/20 meters. At /sha
time presence of the PW in his house or going for
offering /sha prayers to the mosque along with his
brother had been quite natural. When the occurrence
had taken place on their return to their house
immediately after offering /sha prayers and the timings
given in the ‘Murasila’ as well as report of initial
examination of the deceased then injured (Ex. PW-1/1)
support such fact, then presence of the complainant
along with his brother at the relevant time cannot be
disbelieved. His presence along with his brother Wajid
Ali (late) has also been mentioned by the other PW
namely Israr Ahmad, in his 161 statement recorded
same night on the place of occurrence, without any
delay. Report in the instant case has been lodged by
the complainant in the hospital after 55 minutes of the
occurrence, which cannot in circumstances of the case
be stated to be a delayed report. Arrival of the injured
at the hospital shown as 07:45 p.m. and lodging of
report at 07:55 p.m. would have been, after initial
management of the patient and thus the report in
circumstances of the case was reasonably prompt and
also shows presence of the complainant along with the

injured, in the hospital immediately after the

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-12-

occurrence. So far as the improvements in the
statements of two PWs are concerned these are of
embroidery nature, offered as further explanations, and
does not bear any decisive effect on the case of
prosecution. Had these improvements not been there,
the situation would have remained as it is now. The
improvements have not been making any difference
and same cannot be termed as dishonest improvements
carrying the potential of damaging the evidentiary
value of the statements of PWs.

11. There had no doubt been certain minor
contradictions in statements of PW-6 and PW-7, but it
is equally important that these two witnesses had been
examined in the Court after more than four years of the
occurrence and occurring of such minor contradictions
as mentioned earlier had been quite natural. The minor
contradictions had not been related to the actual
occurrence but related to arrival of the complainant
and his brother to the mosque as well as such other
matters which cannot be called as discrepancy on
material particulars of the case. When witnesses are
examined after more than four years of the occurrence
a photographic narration of the occurrence cannot be

expected from them. Hon’ble Supreme Court of

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-13-

Pakistan in its judgment given in the case of “Khadim
Hussain _v/s_The_ State” reported as PLD 2010
Supreme Court 669 has held that creeping in of minor
contradictions in testimony of PWs, with passage of
time, have been natural and same could be ignored.
Relevant part of observation of the august Court is
reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

"We have also adverted to the contention of learned
ASC that various contradictions in the statements of
the prosecution witnesses have not been taken into
consideration causing serious prejudice against the
appellant. It has been held time and again by this Court
that minor contradictions do creep in with the passage
of time and can be ignored safely.

Similarly, in the case of “Muhammad
Ilyas v/s The State” reported as “2011 SCMR 460”
the Hon’ble Supreme Court had also observed;

Contradictions which are not grave in nature can be
ignored safely as minor contradictions creep in with
passage of time. Merely on the basis of contradictions,
statement of a prosecution witness cannot be discarded
if corroborated by other incriminating material.

Further reliance in this respect may also
be placed on judgment of Hon’ble Apex Court
rendered in the case of “Zulfigar Ahmad _v/s_The
State” reported as “2011 SCMR 492”.

12. We would now discuss objection of
learned counsel for appellant regarding proof of the

mode and manner of the occurrence. Main focus of the

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-14-

learned counsel for appellant in this respect had been
on the claimed discrepancy between eyewitness
account and the medical evidence. The deceased then
injured had initially been taken to Dargai hospital
where he had been examined by doctor Shehzad who
appeared and testified in the case as PW-1. He has
given the following narration of the injury found on
body of the deceased;

“after profuse vomiting and blood stained face/body.
At that very moment, he was searched in detailed for
any obvious injury, but nothing was found, below the
neck except a lacerated wound on medial side right
eye, with eye swelling.

There was no other wound on scalp or face.

He was treated as case of raised intracranial (with
fluid, diuretics, analgesic) as a provisional diagnosis
of subdural/epidural hematoma. He was referred to
Mardan Medical Complex neurosurgical ward, for
CT brain (Report attached). CT show metallic pieces
in brain secondary to fire-arm injury. He was then
referred to LRH Neurosurgery from MMC. Where

he expired on 23.12.2014. A proper postmortem was
done in KMC, Forensic Department.”

The injured had also remained under
treatment in LRH and had expired later on. The doctor
who had conducted his postmortem examination has
been examined as PW-3. He has given the following
description of injury found on the dead body of the
deceased;

(1) Firearm entry wound right side face just inner to
eye (0.5 x 0.5 cm).

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-15-

(2) The small pieces seen in CT brain could not be
recovered despite extensive exploration.

CRANIUM AND SPINAL COR;
scalp, skull, membrane, brain are injured.

THORAX;
All organs were found healthy.

ABDOMEN;

All organs were healthy, and stomach was empty.

MUSCLES, BONES, JOINTS;

Skull was fractured and the injury was as
mentioned in the injury No. I

REMARKS BY MEDICAL OFFICER;

In my opinion the deceased died due to injury to
brain due to firearm.”

In his cross-examination the witness
stated that the metallic pieces shown in C.T. scan
report of the brain could not be discovered despite
exploration and that the single injury received by the
deceased had not been having an exit wound. True that
Kalashnikov was a formidable weapon, as argued by
learned counsel for the appellant and that an injury
caused from Kalashnikov at the distance of 7/8 paces
normally have an exit wound, as it is supposed to be
causing an injury through and through, but it is equally
important to be noted that in the site plan (in the case
in hand) bullet marks have been shown on the nearby
wall. There was high probability that the deceased had
received injury from pieces of a rebound bullet. This
appears to be an injury caused as a result of ricocheted
bullet or its pieces. Such a presumption may well be

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-16-

drawn from the medical evidence as well, where the
C.T. scan report has been shown to be indicating
metallic pieces inside brain. The metallic pieces in the
brain had however been categorically indicated to have
landed there as a result of firearm injury in the right
side face just inner to eye having an entry wound of
0.5 x 0.5 centimeter. Merely because of this instance
the eyewitness account of the complainant cannot be
called to be discrepant with the medical evidence, for
the reason that when a firing takes place an eyewitness
cannot be expected to trace the path of bullet with
normal human vision. Whether the deceased had
received the bullet directly or the injury was caused by
ricochet, cannot be noticed and told by an eyewitness.
When a person makes firing on another and causes
death thereby, he ensues a liability for causing
qatl-i-amd as defined in section 300 PPC, which is
reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

“300. Qatl-e-Amd; Whoever, with the intention of
causing death or with the intention of causing bodily
injury to a person, by doing an act which in the
ordinary course of nature is likely to cause death, or
with-the knowledge that his act is so imminently
dangerous that it must in all probability cause death,
causes the death of such person, is said to commit
qatl-e-amd.

The offence of gatl-i-amd stands

constituted when a person does an act;

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-17-

(a) with the intention of causing death or bodily injury
to another person, by doing an act which in the
ordinary course of nature is likely to cause death; or
(b) does an act with the knowledge that his act is so
imminently dangerous that it must in all probability
cause death and thereby causes death of another
person.

When the mens rea is followed by
actus reus resulting into death of a person in any of the
above-mentioned two situations the criminal liability
for causing gatl-i-amd of another person ensues
thereby. Not only the intention but even knowledge is
sufficient if the act is so imminently dangerous that it
have a definite potential of causing death of another
person. In the case in hand the intention of the
appellant was discoverable from facts of the case when
he opened straight firing at the deceased from a close
range, with a lethal weapon like Kalashnikov. The
mens rea and actus reus had both been forthcoming in
the instant case. The objective of the appellant has also
been achieved as a result of death of the person
intended by him. It does not matter whether the
deceased had received the bullet directly or he had
died due to the effect of a ricochet bullet. In both the

cases the appellant cannot escape the ensuing criminal

liability under section 302 (b) PPC.

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-18-

13. Prosecution have also been able to
successfully prove the motive in shape of Nagal Mad
No. 11 dated 08.10.2014 (Ex. PD), which had been
lodged by the deceased then alive Wajid Ali
himself against the appellant and one Zafar Khan.
It was alleged in the report that about six months back
deceased Amir Rehman had been killed by appellant
and co-accused Farman Ali due to unknown reasons.
In respect of murder of said deceased a separate
criminal case had earlier been registered vide FIR No.
100 dated 24.02.2014, a copy of which has also been
exhibited in the instant case as Ex. PB. Jawad Ali
brother of the deceased in the case in hand had
testified in the earlier case registered against the
appellant which fact had created a bad taste between
the parties. Accused were also alleged to have
threatened the complainant-party of dire consequences
due to said statement and had also made aerial firing in
front of house of the complainant party for
intimidating them. Prosecution have thereby
established existence of motive on part of the appellant
for commission of the offence.

14. Accused/appellant have also remained
absconder for more than two years. In order to prove

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-19-

the factum of absconsion prosecution have relied upon
testimony of Javaid DFC recorded as PW-4. He has
stated in his statement that he had obtained warrant
under section 204 Cr.P.C (Ex. PW-4/1) against the
appellant from the Court of learned Judicial Magistrate
along with proclamation under section 87 Cr.P.C (Ex.
PW-4/3). In respect of execution of warrant under
section 204 Cr.P.C he had visited village Wazir Abad
and searched for the appellant in presence of witnesses
but he could not be traced. He had also obtained
signatures of elders of the locality on the warrant and
submitted his report to the concerned Court. He has
further stated that he had also visited village Wazir
Abad for execution of proclamation notice, and in
presence of the witnesses, affixed the same on door of
house of the appellant as well as on the notice board of
concerned District Courts and other conspicuous
places of the village. Appellant had admittedly been
resident of same village and locality. He could not be
arrested by the local police despite being charged in a
murder case. In this respect sufficient material in the
form of warrant under section 204 Cr.P.C (Ex. PW-
4/1) and proclamation under section 87 Cr.P.C

(Ex.PW-4/3) has been brought by the prosecution on

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-20-

record. It can thus safely be held that the
accused/appellant had willfully absconded so as to
avoid his lawful arrest, after the occurrence and
lodging of the report.
15. Absconsion by itself cannot be held
sufficient for recording conviction on a capital charge,
but when other reliable evidence is available with the
prosecution, then such a prolonged and unexplained
absconsion may safely be taken into account as a
corroboratory piece of evidence against an accused.
Reliance in this respect may be placed on judgment of
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan rendered in the
case of “Riaz Hussain vs. The State” reported as
2001 SCMR 177, wherein it has been held;
“Tf, after the commission of a crime, a person whose
name is mentioned as a participator in the crime
absconds, his conduct shows that he is concerned in
the crime. Therefore, anything which tends to explain
his conduct and furnishes a motive other than a guilty
conscience, will be relevant under section 9, Evidence
Act". (Gangaram Hari Parit v. E., 62 IC 545: 22 Cr.
LJ 529). In view of what has been stated above the
factum of absconsion cannot altogether be ignored and
corroborative value of the abscondence of accused is to
be judged in the light of facts and circumstances of
each case.

The factum of abscondence having its own
significance also lends corroboration to the eye

account of Mst. Manzooran. If any reference is needed
PLD 1978 SC 102 can be cited.”

Further reliance in this respect may also be

placed on the judgments of the Hon’ble Supreme Court

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-21-

of Pakistan rendered in the case of Mawas Khan _vs.
The State and another reported as PLD 2004
Supreme Court 330 as well as the case of M_Anzur
Elahi_vs. The State reported as PLD 1965 (W.P.)
Lahore 656.

16. The weapon of offence i.e. Kalashnikov
could not be recovered in the case in hand, but as
stated earlier the appellant had remained absconder for
more than two years and the possibility of disposing it
of during such period could not be ruled out. The
testimony of PW Israr is also providing added vigor to
the case of prosecution in this respect as this PW had
seen the accused/appellant duly armed _ with
Kalashnikov decamping from the spot immediately
after the occurrence. Besides six empty shells of
Kalashnikov has also been recovered from the spot.
Therefore non-recovery of the weapon of offence in
the instant case would hardly make any difference. The
occurrence had taken place during night time and in
respect of identity of the appellant the Investigating
Officer had taken in possession a source of light i.e.

bulb vide recovery memo dated 15.12.2014.

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-22-

17. For what has been discussed above, the
appeal in hand was found lacking any substance and
same is accordingly dismissed.

18. So far as criminal revision No. 112-M of
2019 is concerned, it is settled law that minor
discrepancies in prosecution case may be considered in
determining the quantum of sentence. The minor
contradictions in statements of the PWs as discussed in
earlier part of this judgment have though not been
sufficient to entitle the appellant to outright acquittal, but
such minor weaknesses in the case of prosecution may
be considered in awarding him the lessor provided
punishment. Reliance in this respect is placed on
judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan
rendered in the case of “Falak Sher v/s The State”
reported as 1999 SCMR 2432. The learned trial Court
have therefore rightly awarded life imprisonment to the
appellant under section 302 (b) PPC instead of a death
penalty. This Court, in circumstances of the case, does
not find itself inclined towards interfering in the
sentence. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of
complainant could not show a good cause for such an

exercise as well. Criminal revision No. 112-M of 2019

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-23-

was therefore found divested of any force and same is
also dismissed accordingly.
