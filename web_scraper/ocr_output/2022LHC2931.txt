site plan of the place of occurrence and produced before the
Investigating Officer on 21.11.2012.

10. Muhammad Irfan (P.W.7) and Nadeem (P.W.8) were injured-
eye witnesses of the occurrence. They were deaf and dumb,
therefore, their statements were recorded with the help of
Muhammad Ashraf interpreter.

11. Ali Imran (P.W.9) was complainant of the case. He supported
the prosecution story as mentioned in the FIR.

12. Aziz Ullah S.L(P.W.11) conducted investigation of the case.
13. Muhammad Akram H.C. (P.W.12) escorted the dead body of
Muhammad Yaseen deceased to the mortuary.

14. Muhammad Ashraf (P.W.13) Interpreter as

School of Deaf and Dumb. He also made his statement in this
context before the LO. on 09.12.2012. Rest of the PWs were of

Appeal No 24016/2019
Murder Reference No.88-2019

16. After recording prosecution evidence, statements of accused
persons were recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C. Responding to a
question “why this case against you and why the PWs deposed
against you, Anjum Latif appellant stated as under:

“The complainant got registered this case against me
by suppressing the real facts. In fact the complainant
party was the aggressor and to conceal their
aggression they falsely got registered this case.
Moreover, using the undue political influence this false
case was registered. The complainant was not present
at the alleged place of occurrence. The complainant
and the PWs are related interst and are interested
witness and have deposed falsely.”

The other co-accused made a similar statement as mentioned

above.

17. The appellants and their co-accused neither appeared as their
own witnesses under Section 340 (2) Cr.P.C nor produced any
evidence in defence. However, Anjum Latif appellant tendered in
defence evidence a certified copy of Writ Petition No. 1852/2014
titled Amjad Latif Vs. DPO Sargodha as Ex.DA.

18. Learned counsel for the appellants, inter-alia, contended
that the occurrence took place on a thorough fare in a market but
no independent witness was cited by the prosecution; that all the
PWs were closely related to the deceased and, thus, were
interested witnesses; that the statements of the eye witnesses
were replete with contradictions/discrepancies; that the motive
was not proved; that the recoveries were effected from the
appellants simultaneously, on the same day from their house; that
the safe dispatched of crime empties to Punjab Forensic Science
Agency was not proved, thus, the report of Punjab Forensic Science
Agency was inconsequential; that the postmortem was conducted
after six hours of the occurrence, which suggested deliberation and
consultation; that one of the injured, namely, Omer Daraz was not
examined at trial; that Muhammad Irfan and Nadeem injured-eye
witnesses were deaff and dumb and their statements were not

recorded in accordance with law, thus, inadmissible; that scaled
Crl. Appeal No.23157/2019 6
Appeal No 24016/2019
Murder Reference No.88-2019

site plan was prepared at the instance of Zahid and Sagheer PWs,
not examined during trial; that the eye witnesses were examined
after the lapse of about twenty five days on 09.12.2012 but no
plausible explanation was forthcoming on record for such belated
statements; that Arshad alias Matool and owner of Moosa Mobile
Shop claimed themselves to be the eye witnesses of the occurrence,
interrogated-examined by the Investigating Officer but not produced
by the prosecution as witness; that co-accused of the appellants
including Amanullah alias Toni, Muhammad Ejaz, Muhammad
Imtiaz and Aftab were acquitted on the same set of evidence and
no independent corroboration was forthcoming on record to
sustain conviction of the appellants; that case of the prosecution
was replete with doubts and every doubt even slightest is always
resolved in favour of the accused, thus, the appellants are entitled

to acquittal.

19. Learned Deputy Prosecutor General assisted by the
learned counsel for the complainant argued that the parties were
known to each other, the appellants along-with their co-accused
were nominated in the FIR registered with promptitude, which
excludes the possibility of deliberation/consultation; that the eye
witnesses have rendered straight forward account of occurrence
and had no axe to grind against the appellants; that the medical
evidence lent further corroboration to the prosecution story; that the
motive was proved; that the deceased sustained firearm injury at
the hands of the appellant, namely, Amjad Latif, proved fatal; that
the discrepancies hinted at by the learned counsel for the
appellants were minor and negligible and do not effect the case of
prosecution in any manner; that the deaf and dumb witnesses
were examined through interpreter which is sufficient compliance
of the law on the subject; that positive report of Punjab Forensic
Science Agency also lend further corroboration to the complainant’s
version; that the prosecution proved its case against the appellants

to the hilt, thus, the appeals deserve dismissal;
Crl. Appeal No.23157/2019 7
Appeal No 24016/2019
Murder Reference No.88-2019

20. We have considered the points raised at the bar and have
perused record with able assistance of the learned counsel for the

parties.

21. The appellants were earlier convicted by the learned trial
Court vide judgment dated 07.12.2015 and appeals (Criminal
Appeal No.3851/2015 and Criminal Appeal No.37/2016) filed by
the appellants were disposed of by this Court and the judgment of
the trial Court was set aside vide judgment dated 08.11.2018,
whereby the case was remanded to the learned trial Court with the
direction to re-write the judgment after affording an opportunity of
hearing to learned counsel of both sides and while taking into
consideration all aspects of the case pertaining to the charge
framed, in accordance with law and while giving convincing and
elaborate reasoning, which satisfy the judicial conscience in the
interest of safe administration of criminal justice. Murder Reference
No.7 of 2016 was also answered in the negative. After remand, the
learned trial Court vide judgment dated 10.4.2019 acquitted co-

accused of the appellants including Aman Ullah, Muhammad Ijaz,
Muhammad Imtiaz and Aftab Ali. Whereas, the appellants were

held guilty, convicted and sentenced as detailed above.

22. On the fateful day and at the time of occurrence, the
deceased, namely, Muhammad Yaseen along-with his sons
including Ali Imran, Nadeem and Muhammad Irfan were going to
parking stand situated in Block No.6. All of them were
shopkeepers. The appellants had also their shops in the same
street. It was the case of the prosecution that Anjum Lateef, Aman
Ullah, Amjad Latif along-with other co-accused emerged at the
crime scene on a car. Whereas, Hassan Ijaz and Imtiaz reached at
the spot on a motorbike. Amjad Latif appellant fired at the
deceased hitting his right temporal region. Amjad Latif appellant
had beaten Nadeem PW. This occurrence was also witnessed by

Zahid and Sagheer PWs.
Crl. Appeal No.23157/2019 8
Appeal No 24016/2019
Murder Reference No.88-2019

23. An altercation between Muhammad Irfan (PW-7) and the
accused 2-3 days prior to the occurrence was the reason for the

outbreak of this episode.

24. After the occurrence, the deceased then injured was
shifted to hospital. Meanwhile, the police party reached there.
However, the deceased succumbed to the injury. During this
occurrence, the deceased sustained only one injury attributed to
Amjad Latif appellant and said single injury is also borne out from
the postmortem report Exh.PB. As mentioned above, the occurrence
took place at 6:30 p.m but the postmortem was conducted on the
following day at 1:30 a.m (at night). The medical officer admitted
during the cross-examination that he neither mentioned CNIC
numbers nor relations of the persons, who accompanied/ identified
the deceased _ at the time of post-mortem. He also gone on to add
that he received the dead body at 1:15 a.m and conducted
postmortem at 1:30 a.m on the same day. He also admitted that the
dead body was received at mortuary after completion of police

papers.

25. The occurrence took place on 13.11.2012 at 6:30 p.m in
Methai Wali Gali Block No.6-Sargodha. The place of occurrence was
a thorough fare and surrounded by thickly populated area
including shops. The record divulged that two shopkeepers from
the same market including Arshad alias Matool and proprietor of
Moosa Mobile Shop joined the investigation, claimed themselves to
be eye witnesses of the occurrence and supported the version of the
appellants-accused were interrogated/examined during the
investigation but none of them was produced at trial being witness.
The record further suggested that hundreds of people joined the
investigation in support of the defence version and also admitted by

the Investigating Officer during his cross-examination.

26. The eye witnesses were closely related to each other and

the deceased. The eye-injured witnesses including Ali Imran,
Crl. Appeal No.23157/2019 9
Appeal No 24016/2019
Murder Reference No.88-2019

Muhammad Irfan, Muhammad Nadeem were real sons of the
deceased. Whereas, Zahid PW was ‘behnoi’ of above witnesses
and Sagheer PW was their ‘phupha’. However, Omer Daraz PW
was their employee and not produced during trial.

27. It is settled by now that statement of a witness related to
deceased should be corroborated rather the statement of a worst
enemy could be relied upon, if it inspires confidence and intrinsic
worth of a statement is not shaken. It may be observed that mere
relationship of the witnesses with the deceased is not a ground for
discarding their statements when otherwise, confidence inspiring

and finds corroboration from the independent witnesses.

28. At this stage, it may also be mentioned that Muhammad
Irfan and Nadeem PWs were deaf and dumb. They claimed to have
been examined by the Investigating Officer after two days of the
occurrence but no such statement was available on record. Their
statements under section 161, Cr.P.C were recorded on
09.12.2012 after about twenty five days of the occurrence. No
plausible explanation was forthcoming on record for belated
recording of their statements. A similar question came up before the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in “Syed Saeed Muhammad
Shah_and_ another v. The State” (1993 SCMR 550), the relevant

observations of their lordships appearing in para-28, read as

under:

“28. ...2In this case unsatisfactory explanation which is not
substantiated can be equated with no explanation. In the case
Sikandar v. The State (PLD 1963 SC 17) there was controversy
as to when police statement of eye-witness was recorded and
in that regard there was choice between version of eye-witness
and investigating officer. It was held that controversy is to be
resolved on the basis of rule that benefit of doubt must be
given to the accused hence evidence of that eye-witness was
viewed with doubt. In the case of Ismail and others v. The
State (1983 PCr.LJ 823) evidence of witnesses was ruled out of
consideration on the ground that their police statements were
recorded after 8 days and prosecution offered no explanation.
In the case of Sirajuddin v. Kala and another (PLD 1964 SC
26), evidence of witness was held to be not reliable for the
reason of patent doubt as to the time as he first appeared
before the police for his statement.”
Crl. Appeal No.23157/2019 10
Appeal No 24016/2019
Murder Reference No.88-2019

The above view was reiterated by the apex Court in
“Muhammad Asif v. The State” (2017 SCMR 486) and “Rahat Ali
v. The State” (2010 SCMR 584)

29. The witnesses including Muhammad Irfan and Nadeem
also claimed to have sustained injuries at the hands of the
accused including the appellant, namely, Amjad Latif and his co-
accused. They were medically examined by Dr. Azmat Rafique
(PW.10), who observed six injuries on the person of PW, namely,
Nadeem and ExhPP reflected that four injuries were sustained by
Muhammad Irfan PW. All the injuries were abrasions, contusions
and swellings, simple in nature. They also claimed to have
severely beaten by the appellants along-with their co-accused but
no such torture/beating is borne out from the available record. The
injured-eye witnesses were at variance regarding material points.
Muhammad Irfan (PW-7) described that Anjum Lateef appellant
fired at the deceased hitting on his right temporal region which is
contradicted by medical evidence. Whereas, Nadeem (PW-8)
admitted that at the time of occurrence, his brother Ali Imran

(complainant) was not with them.

As mentioned above, the eye witnesses including
Muhammad Irfan and Nadeem were deaf and dumb. Their
statements were recorded with the help of interpreter, namely,
Muhammad Ashraf Instructor Deaf and Dumb School with the help
of Surrya Nasreen Senior Headmistress of the same school. He
was also examined during the investigation under section 161,
Cr.P.C as reflected by Exh.DC and that the statement of the said
eye-injured witnesses were also recorded with his help. All three
were examined on 09.12.2012. Nothing can be gathered from the
available record if both the injured were incapable to make
statements till 09.12.2012 and for what reasons their statements
under section 161, Cr.P.C were recorded after twenty five days of

the occurrence.
Crl. Appeal No.23157/2019 11
Appeal No 24016/2019
Murder Reference No.88-2019

There is no statutory provision which specifically deals
with the opportunity of recording evidence of a witness who is deaf
and dumb, however, Article 3 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984
contemplates that all persons are competent to testify, unless they
are prevented from understanding the questions put to them or
from giving rational answers to those questions. Further Article 59
of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 read with section 543, Cr.P.C are
relevant but they also do not directly deal with the mode of
recording evidence of a deaf and dumb witness. As regards the
precedent law in Pakistan, the question had been dealt with by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in judgment reported as Muhammad

Mansha_versus___The_ State (2019 SCMR 64), wherein their

lordships observed that the trial Court should determine the level
of said witness’s comprehension before recording his evidence and
that section 543, Cr.P.C required that an interpreter shall be bound
to state true dictation of such evidence or statement. The apex
Court further observed that the trial Court should also administer
oath to the person translating and in view of such violation of

criminal procedural law, the conviction could not be sustained.

30. As mentioned above, to record statement of a deaf and
dumb witness, there is no specific provision in Qanoon-e- Shahdat,
1984. However, there is specific/provision in Indian Evidence Act,
1872, which deals with the statement of dumb person. The said

section is reproduced for ready reference:

(i) “119. Dumb witness-----. A witness who is unable to speak may

give his evidence in any other manner in which he can make it
intelligible as by writing or by signs; but such writing must be
written and the signs made in open Court. Evidence so given shall

be deemed to be oral evidence.

31. In case titled State of Rajastan Vs. Darshan Singh @

Darshan Lal, Supreme Court of India held that object of enacting

the provisions of section 119 of the Evidence Act reveals that deaf
Crl. Appeal No.23157/2019 12
Appeal No 24016/2019
Murder Reference No.88-2019

and dumb persons’ were earlier contemplated in law as idiots.
However, such a view has subsequently been changed for the
reason that modern science revealed that persons affected with
such calamities are generally found more intelligent and to be
susceptible to far higher culture than one was once supposed.
When a deaf and dumb person is examined in the Court, it has to
exercise due caution and take care to ascertain before he is
examined that he possesses the requisite amount of intelligence
and that he understands the nature of his oath. On being satisfied
on this, the witness may be administered oath by appropriate
means and that also be with the assistance of an interpreter.
However, in case a person can read and write, it is most desirable
to adopt that method being more satisfactory than any sign
language. The law required that there must be record of signs and

not interpretation of signs.

32. Now, we would prefer to separate the terms “deaf” and

“dumb”. Not all deaf are dumb, and not all dumb are deaf.

Dumb in the sense “lacking the power of speech” is perceived as
insulting when describing human (but not animals), probably
DUMB also means stupid; “dull witted”. The noun dummy in the
sense means “person who lacks the power of speech”.

» 6,

Dumb is the old English word that means “mute”, “speechless”
and_ itself came from an even older word “dheubh” meaning

D6,

“confusion” “stupefaction” and dizziness. Today, dumb still means
“unable to speak” but it does not have anything to do with

intelligence.

As adjective, the difference between deaf and dumb is that deaf
is not having the faculty of hearing, or only partially able to hear

while dumb is unable to speak; lacking power of speech.

33. The language of deaf and dumb is called sign language,
and languages that use the visual/manual modality to convey the

meaning. There is no universal sign language. There are more
Crl. Appeal No.23157/2019 13
Appeal No 24016/2019
Murder Reference No.88-2019

than three hundred different sign languages in use around the
world. They vary from nation to nation. Along-with British sign
language, there are several sign languages used by English
speaking countries including USA (American sign language),
Australia (Australian sign language). Ireland (Irish sign language)
which is derived from French sign language but shares similarities
with British Sign language. One of the most widely used sign
languages around the world is Chinese sign language(CSL or
ZGS), which has upto twenty million users. While indo Pakistani

sign language has about eighteen million users across South Asia.

34. Let’s have a look to find sign languages, their stories and
their finger alphabets. The journey to communicating globally
begins here. Sign language is a visual means of communicating
through hand signals, gestures, facial expression and body
language. Most people start their sign language journey by
learning A-Z or alphabets equivalent in sign form. Use of the
hands to represent individual letters of a written alphabet is called

“finger spelling”

For example, most sign languages have a specific sign for the
word ‘tree” but may not have a specific sign for oak, so O.A.K
would be finger spelled to convey that specific meaning. According
to world Federation of Deaf, there are more than seventy million
deaf people worldwide. The convention on the rights of persons
with disabilities recognizes and promotes the use of sign
languages. It makes clear that sign languages are equal in status
to spoken language. UN General Assembly has proclaimed 2374
September as international day of sign languages in order to raise
awareness of importance of sign languages in the full realization

of the human rights of people who are deaf.

35. Languages, are more than words, like all other languages,
communication by way of signs has some inherent limitations,

since it may be difficult to comprehend what the user is attempting
Crl. Appeal No.23157/2019 14
Appeal No 24016/2019
Murder Reference No.88-2019

to convey but a deaf person need not be prevented from being a
credible and reliable witness merely due to his/her physical
disability. Such a person though unable to speak may convey
himself through writing if literate or through signs and gestures if
he is unable to read and write. The emphasized body language and
facial expression enabled the audience to comprehend the

intended message.

36. In Meesala Ramakrishan versus State of A.P, 1994(2),
R.C.R (Criminal) 675; (1994)4 (SCC 182), Indian Supreme Court has
considered evidentiary value of a dying declaration recorded by
means of signs and nods of a person who was not in a position to
speak for any reason and held that the same amounts to verbal
statement and, thus, was relevant and admissible. It was further
clarified that “verbal” statement does not amount to “oral”
statement. In view of provisions of section 119 of the Evidence Act,
the only requirement was that the witness may give his evidence
in any manner in which he could make it intelligible, as by writing
or by signs and such evidence can be taken to be oral statement.
Signs and gestures made by nods or head are admissible and such
nods and gestures were not only admissible to possess evidentiary

value, it was further observed.

37. The record divulged that the learned trial Court vide order
dated 16.9.2014 observed that the statement of the deaf and
dumb witnesses had to be recorded through Muhammad Ashraf
PW, superintendent of deaf and dumb school-Sargodha. At some
stage, an application was filed by the appellants for the
appointment of some other interpreter but on 30.10.2014, it was
resolved that the principal of deaf and dumb school-Sargodha
should also remain present to help the said interpreter meaning
thereby that had the interpreter been capable of explaining signs of
the witnesses, there was no question to bound down the principal
of deaf and dumb school, namely, Surraya Nasreen. The record is

silent regarding details of the signs made by the deaf and dumb
Crl. Appeal No.23157/2019 15
Appeal No 24016/2019
Murder Reference No.88-2019

witnesses as well as about the interpretation of their signs made
by the interpreter that, too, with the help of said principal. The
summoning of the said Headmistress itself suggested that the
witness/interpreter, namely, Muhammad Ashraf was not expert

and fully capable to convey the signs of the injured witnesses.

At this stage, it may also be added that the interpreter,
namely, Muhammad Ashraf himself was a witness and examined
under section 161, Cr.P.C as reflected by Exh.DC and _ that
statements of the injured witnesses including Muhammad Irfan
and Muhammad Nadeem were recorded with the help of said
interpreter. The record also revealed that he joined the
investigation, was a prosecution witness and appeared as PW.13,
thus, the learned trial Court should have abstained to examine the
injured-deaf and dumb witnesses on the basis of his interpretation.
The Kerala High Court dealing with the question of statement of
deaf and dumb witness to be recorded by somebody else referring
to the Calcutta High Court’s case in Ah Soi (1926(27) Crl.LJ 805)

(supra) observed as follows:

“if somebody else is available, it is better the services of a person
who is witness in the case is not made use of to interpret his
evidence or to converse with him. In Ah Soi v. King Emperor (AIR
1926 Calcutta 922): (1926(27) Crl.LJ 805), it has been held that a
witness who took active part during the investigation of the case
and who gave evidence before the committing Magistrate and who
was willing to give evidence on the side of the prosecution in the
Sessions trial should not be chosen as interpreter. The Calcutta
High Court said that this is opposed to the elementary ideas of
justice”

The record also suggested that Muhammad Ashraf had
been teacher in the school-injured witnesses meaning thereby that
the witnesses had attended the school of deaf and dumb but
record is silent if they were eligible to read and write, otherwise, it
would have been expedient to obtain their statements during trial in
writing and learned trial Court failed to determine if the injured
eye-witnesses were literate or otherwise. No doubt, language of
deaf and dumb persons requires special knowledge or skill which

may be acquired through specialist in the field. What may further
Crl. Appeal No.23157/2019 16
Appeal No 24016/2019
Murder Reference No.88-2019

be added here is that expert’s evidence produced in this case does

not reflect that he was expert in any of the sign language or was

well conversant with the signals made by the injured witnesses.

The above discussion leads us to hold that while examining a

deaf and dumb witness, following steps should be taken by the

learned trial Courts:

38.

To ascertain whether such a witness possesses the requisite
amount of intelligence;
Whether he understands the nature of oath;

Trial Court is also required to record his satisfaction to that

effect;

The trial Court is required to ascertain, if the witness either
by writing or sign can make intelligible of what he has to
speak;

If he is able to communicate his statement perfectly by
writing, it will be more satisfactory method of taking
evidence;

When such a_ witness is unable to write, then he can make
sign showing what he wants to say;

If it is by signs, those signs must be recorded by the learned
trial Court and not only the interpretations of those signs;

It is necessary to enable the appellate Court to know whether
the interpretation of the sign is correct or not;

It is not safe for a trial Court to embark upon the examination
of a deaf and dumb person on his own without help of an
expert or a person familiar with his mode of conveying ideas
to others in day to day life;

The interpreter should not be a interested person, who had
participated in the investigation and who is a witness in the
same trial;

Interpreter should be a person of the same surrounding but
should not have any interest in the case and he should be
administered oath;

We may also mention that the place of occurrence in this

case was not proved by the prosecution. As highlighted above, the
Crl. Appeal No.23157/2019 17
Appeal No 24016/2019
Murder Reference No.88-2019

occurrence took place in Methai Wali Gali, Block No.6-Sargodha. In
order to prove this fact, prosecution produced Muhammad Hafeez
draftsman as PW.6. During his cross-examination, it was admitted
that there was no shop of any PW or his relative in the said street.
The draftsman also admitted that he was aware of the fact that
injured witnesses were deaf and dumb and explained that he had
prepared the scaled site plan Exh.PF and Exh.PF/1, under
instructions of Zahid and Sagheer Ullah PWs, not produced by the

prosecution during trial.

The reasons for the outbreak of this episode was a quarrel
between Muhammad Irfan and the accused 2/3 days prior to the
occurrence. The Investigating Officer had not thrashed this aspect
of the matter during the investigation. In short, Muhammad Irfan
as PW.4 has not uttered even a single word that he had some
altercation, quarrel or dispute with any of the accused at any time
prior to this occurrence, thus, the assertions of the complainant
regarding motive is based on hearsay and not admissible. It is
settled by now that prosecution is not bound to introduce the motive
as some crimes are motiveless and that the motive is hidden deep
in the mind of the perpetrator of the crime but once, it is set up and

not established, then it adversely effects the case of prosecution.

39. During the investigation, the investigating Agency secured
from the crime scene two crime empties, received by Ghulam
Muhammad 638-C (PW.3) on 29.11.2012 from Abdul Rasheed MHC
1212 (PW.2)

40. Procedure for collection, preservation and transportation of

firearms and tool marks are provided in guidelines of PFSA as:

> Every evidence exhibit must be packed separately;

> Every firearm must be packed in unloaded condition with

safety on;

> There must not be live rounds in the chamber of the firearm,
magazine or in the parcel;

laws

>

>

Every cartridge case and bullet must be packed separately;

Evidence submitted for Gun Shot Residue (GSR) analysis
must be packed in hard box instead of cloth bag or paper
envelope. Layers of the clothes containing GSR must not touch
with the other layers.

Clothes must be wrapped by placing a white paper sheet
between the layers of clothes before packing it in a hard box;

Nature of examination must be clearly indicated in the docket;
Seals must be intact and as per mentioned in the docket;

Following inferences are drawn from the study of case

regarding procedure of collection, preservation and

transportation of firearms and Tool Marks:

42.

Investigating Officer should record the statements under
section 161, Cr.P.C mentioning parcel and recovery contained
in such parcel;

The weapon/recovery should be placed in safe custody at
“Malkhana” of the Police Station;

There should be entry/report of such recovery in the
“Malkhana” of the Police Station;

Entry/report of such recovery in the “Malkhana” of the Police
Station should be produced before the trial Court to
corroborate the version of prosecution;

Incharge of the “Malkhana’ should be produced and
examined regarding safe custody of the recovery/weapon;

Safe transmission of the recovery/weapon to the Forensic
Science Laboratory should be proved; and

Evidence of police official with regard to safe transmission of
weapon/recovery to the Forensic Science Laboratory is to be
recorded;

The report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency Exh.PW

revealed that parcels containing two 30 bore caliber cartridges

(Items C-1 and C-2) were submitted on 30.11.2012 but this fact

does not find mention in the statement of Ghulam Muhammad 638-

C (PW.3). His statement is silent as to where parcel 2 was

deposited, if it was Faisalabad, Lahore or Islamabad. He testified
Crl. Appeal No.23157/2019 19
Appeal No 24016/2019
Murder Reference No.88-2019

regarding receipt of the said parcel from MHC on 29.11.2012 but
there was no mention in his statement if it was deposited by him
with the office of public analyst on the following day Le.
30.11.2012 and if this is so, then it can safely be concluded that
the prosecution failed to prove the safe transmission of the crime
empties secured from the crime scene and thus, no reliance can be
placed on the said report. The report regarding parcel-I was, thus,
inconsequential.

43. It is also settled law that if the majority of the accused
nominated in a case is acquitted on account of false implication by
the eye witnesses, then, allegations qua remaining accused on the
basis of same set of evidence cannot be sustained without
strong/independent corroboration. In this context, we are guided by
the law laid down by their lordships in the case titled “IFTIKHAR
HUSSAIN and_another V. STATE” (PLJ 2004 SC 552) and
“SARFRAZ alias SAPPI and_2 others V. The State” (2000 SCMR

1758). Similar view was also reiterated in the subsequent
judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as
“AKHTAR ALI and others _V. THE STATE” (2008 SCMR-6).

44. The accumulative effect of the following inconsistencies
and deficiencies makes the prosecution case doubtful:

(i) The injured witnesses were deaf and dumb and their statements
were not recorded during trial in accordance with law;

(ii) That injured-eye witnesses have made dishonest improvements
in their statements duly confronted with their previous statements
recorded under section 161, Cr.P.C;

(iii) All the eye-witnesses were related to the deceased and, thus,
were interested;

(iv) The occurrence took place on a thorough fare but no independent
witness was cited by the prosecution;

(v) The Investigating Officer interrogated Arshad alias Matool and
owner of Moosa Mobile Shop, both, shopkeepers of local market

surroundings the place of occurrence and that they professed
Crl. Appeal No.23157/2019 20
Appeal No 24016/2019
Murder Reference No.88-2019

innocence of accused, but they were not examined under section
161, Cr.P.C or produced being witness during trial;

(vi) The prosecution miserably failed to prove motive as Muhammad
Irfan PW did not utter a_ single word regarding his
dispute/altercation with the accused 2/3 days prior to the
occurrence;

(vii)Safe transmission of crime empties were also not proved, thus,
positive report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency lends no
corroboration to the prosecution story;

(viii) The recoveries of crime weapons from the appellants on the
same day and at the same time from the same place were also
open to objection;

(ix) The postmortem was conducted after about seven hours of the
occurrence, which also reflected against the prosecution;

(x) The scaled site plan was prepared under instructions of Zahid
and Sagheer Ullah PWs as admitted by Muhammad Hafeez
draftsman but they were not examined during trial;

(xi) The majority of the co-accused of the appellants were acquitted
on the same set of evidence and their acquittal remained
unchallenged before this Court and no independent corroboration
was forthcoming on record from the available material;

(xii)The injured eye-witnesses were examined under section 161,
Cr.P.C after twenty five days of the occurrence and there was no
plausible explanation for recording their statements at belated
stage;

(xiti) The appellant, namely, Azhar was attributed role of
causing injury to Umer Daraz PW, not produced during trial. He
neither caused any injury to the deceased nor the injured PWs;

45. It is by now settled that doubt if found in the
prosecution’s case, the accused shall be held entitled to the benefit
thereof. It is also settled principle of criminal administration of
justice that if there is element of doubt, as to the guilt of accused, it

must be resolved in his favour. The golden rule of benefit is initially
Crl. Appeal No.23157/2019 21
Appeal No 24016/2019
Murder Reference No.88-2019

a rule of prudence which cannot be ignored, while dispensing
justice in accordance with law. It is based on maxim that it is better
to acquit ten guilty persons rather than to convict one innocent
person. For acquittal of accused in an offence, how-so heinous it
may be, only a single doubt in the prosecution evidence is
sufficient. Reliance, in this context, can be placed on “Mst. Nazia

Anwar versus The State and others” (2018 SCMR 911) and the

relevant observations of their lordships appearing in para-12 at

page 922, which read as under:

“....The cardinal principle in the criminal justice system in
a situation like this, is to extend benefit of doubt to an
accused to acquit him/her of capital charge, instead of
reducing the sentence. Once doubts about the genuineness of
the story lurk into the minds of the judges, the only
permissible course is to acquit the accused and not go for the
alternative sentence of life imprisonment. In this regard
reference may be made to the following case laws:

“(i) Ayub Masih v. The State (PLD 2002 SC 1048)
(ii) Muhammad Zaman v. The State and others

(2014 SCMR 749)

(iti) Hashim Qasim v. The State (2017SCMR 986)

It is also well entrenched rule and principle of law that
on the basis of probabilities, accused person may be extended
benefit of doubt acquitting him/her of a_ capital charge
however, such probabilities, high howsoever could not be

made basis for conviction of an accused person and that too
on a capital charge”

In a recent case, titled Najaf Ali Shah Versus
The State (2021 SCMR 736), the apex Court

observed as under:

«9, Mere heinousness of the offence if not proved to the
hilt is not a ground to avail the majesty of the Court to do
complete justice. This is an established principle of law and
equity that it is better that 100 guilty persons should let off
but one innocent person should not suffer. As the preeminent
English jurist William Blackstone wrote, “Better that then
guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer.”.
Benjamin Franklin, who was one of the leading figures of
early American history, went further arguing “it is better a
hundred guilty persons should escape than one innocent
person should suffer. All the contradictions noted by the
learned High Court are sufficient to cast a shadow of doubt
on the prosecution’s case, which entitles the petitioner to the
right of benefit of the doubt. It is a well settled principle of
law_that for the accused to be afforded this right of the
benefit of the doubt it is not necessary that there should be
many circumstances creating uncertainty and if there is only
one doubt, the benefit of the same _ must go to the petitioner.
This Court in the case of Mst. Asia Bibi_v. The State (PLD
2019 SC 64) while relying on the earlier judgments of this
Court has categorically held that “ if a single circumstance

Crl. Appeal No.23157/2019 22
Appeal No 24016/2019
Murder Reference No.88-2019

Irfan

creates reasonable doubt in a_ prudent mind about the
apprehension of guilt of an accused, then he/she shall be
entitled to such benefit not _as_a_ matter of grace and
concession, but as_of right. Reference in this regard may be
made to the cases of Tariq Pervaiz v. The State (1998 SCMR
1345) and Ayub Masih v. The Stat (PLD 2002 SC 1048).” The
same view was reiterated_in Abdul Jabbar v. State (2010
SCMR_129), when this Court observed _that_ once a_single
loophole is observed in a case presented by the prosecution,
such in the ocular account and medical evidence or presence
of _eye-witnesses_ being doubtful, the benefit of such
loophole/lacuna in the prosecution’s case automatically goes
in favour of an accused.”

46. For reasons mentioned above, the Criminal_Appeal
No.23157 of 2019 titled Anjum Latif versus The State, etc. and
Criminal Appeal No.24016_ of 2019 titled Amjad Latif versus The
State, etc. are allowed. Resultantly, the judgment dated 10.4.2019

rendered by the trial Court regarding conviction and sentence of the
appellants is hereby set aside. The appellants are acquitted of the
charges. The Court was apprised that the appellants Amjad Latif
and Azhar deposited amount of ‘Daman’ in compliance with the
judgment of the learned trial Court on 08.1.2015. However,
learned counsel was unable to make a categorical statement if they
were released from jail or not, thus, the appellant Anjum Latif shall
be released forthwith if not required in any other criminal case
and if the appellants including Amjad Latif and Azhar are still in
jail, they shall also be treated alike.

Murder Reference No.88 of 2019 is answered in the

negative and death sentence awarded to appellant Anjum Latif is
not confirmed.

The record of the learned trial Court be remitted forthwith.
