JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- The State through

Advocate General filed this criminal appeal against the
judgment and order dated 12.12.2015 of learned Judge,
Special Court (CNS), Peshawar, whereby accused-
respondent Safir Ullah, involved in a case registered
against him, vide FIR No. 06 dated 31.01.2015 under
section 9 ( c ) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act,
1997, at Police Station, ANF, Peshawar, was acquitted.

2. The story of prosecution, as reflected from
the FIR, is that on 31.01.2015 (PW-3) along with other
police contingent had made ,nakabandi, near Bagh-e-
Naran Chowk, Hayatabad, as there was prior information
to the high-ups that narcotics were to be smuggled to
Punjab from tribal territory in a vehicle bearing
registration No. RPT/ 1550. At 1770 hours, the spotted
vehicle came, which was stopped and its driver was
overpowered with the help of his companion. The driver
disclosed his name as Safirullah. On _ cursory

interrogation, he disclosed presence of chars in the rear
portion. The secret cavities were opened through tools,
which led to the recovery of sixty packets containing
chars, total 72 k. gs. He separated 10/10 grams from each
packet, sealed into parcels, while the remaining quantity
of chars was sealed into another parcel. On recovery of
narcotics and arrest of the accused, he drafted murasilla,
Exh. PW 3/2, which was dispatched to Police Station,
ANF, where on the basis of which the above referred FIR
was registered against the accused-respondent.

3. After completion of investigation, complete
challan was submitted against the respondent-accused to
the Court of learned Judge, Special Court (CNS)
Peshawar, where at the commencement of trial, the
prosecution produced four witnesses. On close of the
prosecution evidence, the accused-respondent was
examined under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he denied the
charges, professed innocence and stated to have falsely
been implicated in the case. He also recorded his stated on
oath within the meaning of Section 340(2) Cr.P.C, besides
producing one witness, namely, Abdul Qayyum, as DW-1
in his defence. The learned trial court, on conclusion of
the trial, acquitted the respondent-accused, vide judgment
herein impugned.

4. Learned AAG appearing on behalf of the
State submitted that the local police recovered colossal

quantity of chars from the vehicle which at the relevant
time was driving by the appellant and he was also arrested
on the spot. According to him, the prosecution produced
sufficient evidence which established the guilt of the
appellant but the learned trial Court due to mis-
appreciation of evidence on record on its perspective
acquitted him, therefore, the impugned judgment is liable
to be set aside the accused-respondent be convicted and
sentenced in accordance with law.

5. The accused-respondent was summoned time
and again but he did not appear before the Court,
therefore, we have heard learned AAG and perused the
record with his valuable assistance.

6. On scanning the record, we found material
contradictions in the statements of prosecution witnesses
which create reasonable doubt, which has rightly been
extended by the learned trial court in favour of the
respondent-accused. Assad Abbas SI (PW-3) is the
complainant of the present case, who in cross examination
stated that murasilla was handed over to Riaz Gul at 2000
hours after stopping of the vehicle in question, whereas as
per murasilla at 2000 hours the occurrence took place. The
complainant further stated that the narcotic in question
were taken to Police Station in official vehicle which was
driven by Zubair, while PW-4 Riaz Gul, who was present
with the I.O, stated in his cross examination that the

Zubair drove the official vehicle back to the Police station
and in the same breath stated the case property car was
also driven by Zubair from spot to the Police which is not
appealable to the prudent mind because one person cannot
drive two vehicles simultaneously. Again, the complainant
stated in his cross examination that during this time no
local police arrived to the spot but his statement was
entirely negated by Fida Muhammad SI, who during those
days was posted at Police Station, Hayatabad. He appeared
as CW-1 and stated that he was on routine gasht
along with other officials, when reached Bagh-e-Naran
chowk, they found narcotic police headed by SI Amir
Abbas, who have taken into custody a Datsun pick up
RPT/ 550 which was having inside 60 packets chars garda
which was recovered and taken into custody by narcotic
staff. He further stated that the driver was escaped from
the spot, meanwhile SHO of the Police Station also
reached the spot and the incident was communicated to
higher officers. The narcotic staff took the pickup
alongwith chars while they came to the Police Station and
entered DD No. 08 dated 31.01.2015, which is marked as
Exh. CW 1/1.

7. As against that, the accused-respondent in
reply to question No.1 in his statement under section 342

Cr.P.C stated in the following words:-

“Tt is false allegation. I am contractor by profession
and was coming to site of work from my house in
Shahkas in my Vitz Car No. BC 9204 Peshawar

when reached near Breaker at Bagh-e-Naran at
about 1445 hours on 13.1.2015, one person in grey
cloth aimed pistol from front on me and as such I
was stopped. The person dragged me from the
vehicle and brought me out. I saw another person on
the side standing with a black colour car, who has
covered his mouth but I recognize him to be Jabbar
serving in Khasadar force. When I resisted not to
board their car using my chadar for the purpose.
Meanwhile traffic sergeant also attracted to the spot
but I do not know as to what happened in between
them. My face was muffled and my hands were tied
and were taken to a room where demand for
payment of ten lacks for my release was made to
me. At evening time, ANF Datsun came and took
me to ANF Police Station at Town. On next day at
deegarvella, I was taken to the court. Neither I was
having any mazda Dalla with me nor any narcotic
was recovered. I am innocent falsely implicated.”

He recorded his statement on oath under
section 340 (2) Cr.P.C wherein he narrated the same story.
He also produced one Abdul Qayyum in his defence, who
also supported the stance of the respondent.

When placed the evidence of prosecution in
juxtaposition to the defence stance coupled with statement
of CW-1, one could draw an inference that possibility of
false implication of the respondent-accused in the case
could not be ruled out.

8. Apart from the above, the report of FSL Exh.
PW 3/12 is, no doubt, in affirmative, but the alarming
point for the judicial mined is the short of necessary
protocol. Neither any protocol was mentioned in the report
nor any test was referred to on the basis whereof the

Chemical Expert has concluded that the samples sent for
examination contained Chars. While holding this view we
are fortified from the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case titled as Khair-ul-

Bashar v. the State (2019 SCMR 930), wherein it was
held as under:--

"10. In the present case examination of the report of
the Government Analyst mentions the tests applied
but does not provide their results except a
concluding result, presumably of all the tests, which
is not sufficient. The Report also does not signify
the test protocols that were applied to carry out
these tests. Hence, the mandatory requirement of
law provided under Rule 6 has not been complied
with and, thus, it is not safe to rely on the Report of
the Government Analyst dated 18-02-2016. As a
conclusion, it is reiterated, that the Report of the
Government Analyst must mention (i) all the tests
and analysis of the alleged drug (ii) the result of the
each test(s) carried out along with the consolidated
result and (iii) the name of all the protocols applied
to carry out these tests.

Reliance is also placed on _ unreported
judgment dated 18.12.2019 in a case titled Qaiser Javed

Khan vs. The State through Prosecutor General

Punjab, Lahore and another (PLD 2020 SC 57
wherein it has been held by the Hon’able apex Court that:-

“8. The report of the Government Analyst in the
instant case does not specify the protocols of the
tests applied and thus does not meet the
requirements of the law as interpreted by this Court
in the cases of Amam Bakhsh and Khair ul Bashar
(supra). The said Report cannot be relied upon for

the conviction of the petitioner.”
9. When this being the state of thing, we do
not suggest to draw a conclusion different from what the
learned trial Court has drawn and, hence, we do not feel
hesitant to maintain the acquittal of the respondent-
accused, resultantly, the same is maintained and,
accordingly, dismiss the appeal.
