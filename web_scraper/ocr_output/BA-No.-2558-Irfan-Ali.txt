Sami Ullah alongwith other ANF officials was busy in
checking the luggage of the passengers at Bacha Khan
International Airport of flight No. SR-I from Peshawar to
Doha, when received information from his high ups about
trafficking of heroin by a passenger namely, Irfan Ali (the
petitioner) r/o Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab. On search of bags of
the petitioner, heroin powder cleverly mixed in the rubber
covers pasted at the bottom of the bags, were recovered. The
FIR was registered against the petitioner, while the rubber
covers were extracted from the carry bags and sent to the FSL

for identification, extraction and quantification of heroin
mixed in the rubber sheets. The Laboratory after applying the
extraction method separated 987 grams heroin from rubber
sheet in parcel No.1 while 889 grams heroin from the 2”
sheet, with a positive report.

3. Having heard the arguments of learned counsel for
petitioner and Special Prosecutor ANF, record perused which
reveals that the accused/petitioner is the permanent resident of
Mandi Baha Ud Din selected a flight for Doha and onward to
Italy from Bacha Khan International Airport Peshawar. During
boarding process the ANF authorities on having secrete
information got busted him and on search of two trolly bags
recovered suspected drugs soaked in a rubber type material
total weighing 08 kgs. The rubber sheets were extracted from
each trolley bag and transmitted to the FSL for identification,
extraction and quantification of heroin in each rubber sheet
(parcel No.1 and Parcel No.2) each weighing 4 kgs. The above
sheets were chemically processed in the FSL and heroin
substance was extracted from both the sheets to the extent of
987 and 889 grams respectively total 1896 grams. The above
said recovery has been effected from two different trolly bags
in personal possession of the accused, whereas during
investigation he has been found as a member of National Drug
Trafficking Organization, working for drug carrier at national
level. The ANF authorities have also sent a request for
cancellation of the NIC, passport and Visa of the petitioner to
the concerned authorities. The petitioner has been

apprehended at the airport at international departure section
where he was about to fly for Doha and onward to Italy. The
act of the petitioner is not only against the society but also
earning a bad name to the country at international level.
Besides, challan in the case is complete and trial has to
commence shortly. At this stage the petitioner having involved
in a heinous offence does not deserve the concession of bail.

4. For what has been discussed above, prima facie,
reasonable grounds exist to show the involvement of the
accused/petitioner in the commission of a heinous offence,
therefore, the instant bail application, having no merits is

hereby dismissed.
