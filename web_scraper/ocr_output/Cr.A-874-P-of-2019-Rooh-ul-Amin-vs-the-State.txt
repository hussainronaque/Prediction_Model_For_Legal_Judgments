ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:-_This criminal appeal,
filed by Rooh-ul-Amin, the appellant, calls in question the
legality and propriety of judgment dated 06.07.2019,
passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge-III/Model
Criminal Trial Court, Nowshera, whereby the appellant
having been found guilty of committing murder of Azeem
Ullah deceased, has been convicted under section 302 (b)
PPC and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment and to
pay Rs.2,00,000/-, as compensation to legal heirs of the
deceased in terms of section 544-A Cr.P.C. vide FIR
No.817 dated 24.09.2013, under sections 302/34 PPC,

Police Station Akora Khattak, District Nowshera.
2. According to First Information Report (FIR), on
24.09.2013 at 2155 hours, complainant Fanoos Khan
(PW.10), in company of dead body of his maternal cousin,
Azeem Ullah deceased, in mortuary of District
Headquarter (DHQ) hospital Nowshera Kalan reported the
crime to Umar Hayat ASI (PW.1) to the effect that on the
fateful night he along with Muhammad Arif, Ibrahim
(PW.11) and the deceased, was present in the shop of his
co-villager Ghulam Hassan, when at 1840 hours, appellant
Rooh ul Amin along with Amresh Khan (acquitted co-
accused), and Fazal Amin (absconding co-accused), duly
armed with firearm, entered the shop. Accused Amresh
Khan commanded co-accused named above to kill, on
which Fazal Amin and appellant Rooh ul Amin, opened
fire at the deceased; as a result he got hit and died at the
spot. Bulb was lit in the shop at the time of occurrence.
After the occurrence, the accused decamped from the spot.
Besides the complainant, the occurrence is stated to have
been witnessed by Muhammad Arif (abandoned) and
Ibrahim Khan (PW.11). A previous blood feud between the
accused and the deceased has been advanced as a motive
behind the occurrence.

3. Report of the complainant was recorded in the
shape of Murasila Exh.PA/1 by Umar Hayat ASI (PW.1),
who also prepared injury sheet and inquest report

Exh.PW.1/1 and Exh.PW.1/2 of the deceased and referred
his dead body for postmortem examination. Dr. Said
Badshah SMO (PW.2) conducted autopsy on the dead
body of the deceased on 24.09.2013 at 09.40 a.m. and
found the following injuries on his person:-

1. Firearm entry wound 4 x '4 inches on right side of

to firearm injuries to his vital organs i.e. both lungs and left

kidney.

He opinion probable time between injury and death : Within

hours.

4. Bashir Ahmad Khan DSP (PW.14) was entrusted
with the task of investigation, who proceeded to the spot
and prepared site plan Exh.PW.14/1 on the pointation of
complainant. During spot inspection he secured blood
through cotton from the place of the deceased vide
recovery memo Exh.PW.8/1. Vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.8/2, he took into possession 12 empties of 7.62

bore from the spot. Similarly, through recovery memo
Exh.PW.8/3, he took into possession 25 Watt energy sever
from inside the shop of Ghulam Hussain. Vide recovery
memo Exh.PW.3/1, he took into possession the last worn
bloodstained garments of the deceased. He sent the
bloodstained articles and the empties to the FSL, reports
whereof are Exh.PK/1 and Exh.PK, initiated proceedings
under section 204 and 87 Cr.P.C., against the accused,
recorded statements of the PWs and placed on file FIR
No.577 dated 11.09.2008 in support of the motive. After
completion of investigation he handed over case file to
SHO for submission of challan against the accused under
section 512 Cr.P.C.

5. Masood Khan SI (PW.12) arrested the appellant on
04.07.2017 vide arrest card Exh.PW.12/1. Accused
Amresh Khan surrendered before the court and obtained
ad-interim pre-arrest bail which was, later on, confirmed.
On completion of investigation, challan was submitted
against both the accused before the learned trial Court
where they were formally charge sheeted to which they
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To prove its case, the
prosecution examined as many as seventeen witnesses.
After closure of the prosecution evidence, statements of
the accused were recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C.,
wherein they denied the prosecution allegations and
professed innocence. They, however, declined to be

examined on oath or to produce evidence in defence. On
conclusion of trial, the learned trial court after hearing both
the sides, convicted and sentenced the appellant as
mentioned in the first Para of the judgment, however,
acquitted co-accused Amresh Khan, hence, this appeal.

6. We have heard the exhaustive arguments of
learned counsel for the parties and perused the record with
their valuable assistance.

7. It appears from record that occurrence has taken
place on 24.09.2013 at 1840 hours (6.40 p.m), in the shop
of one Ghulam Hassan, situated in village Jalarona, which
has been reported by complainant Fanoos Khan (PW.10) at
2155 hours (9.55 p.m) 1.e. after a delay of 03 hours and 15
minutes. No explanation, much less plausible, has been
furnished by the complainant to cover the delay either in
his initial report Exh.PA/1 or in his statement recorded as
PW.10. Similar is the case of Ibrahim (PW.11), whose
testimony is completely silent in this regard. Though, the
distance between the crime spot and DHQ hospital
Nowshera Kalan, has not been given in the Murasila, FIR
and inquest report, however, the same can be deduced
from the statement of complainant (PW.10) and Ibrahim
(PW.11) recorded before the trial Court. The former in
cross-examination deposed that if one travels from the
place of occurrence in a vehicle to DHQ _ hospital
Nowshera, he can reach within 45 minutes and that if one

travels through Karnal Sher Khan Interchange then the
distance can be covered within 20 minutes to the said
hospital. Similarly, according to Ibrahim (PW.11), the
distance between DHQ hospital Nowshera and village
Jalarona can be covered through a vehicle within 45
minutes. Complainant deposed that dead body of the
deceased remained at the spot for about 20 minutes,
whereas, according to PW Ibrahim it remained at the spot
for 10/12 minutes. Thereafter, a datsun Pickup was
arranged and the dead body was shifted to the hospital. In
view of statements of the purported eyewitnesses, if 20 and
45 minutes are excluded from 3 hours and 15 minutes, then
the dead body of the deceased should have reached the
hospital at 19.45 hours (7.45 p.m), but report has been
lodged in the hospital at 2155 hours (9.55 p.m). Similarly,
Postmortem of the deceased has been conducted by Dr.
Said Badshah (PW.2) on the same day/date at 9.40 p.m. i.e.
15 minutes prior to report. The unexplained delay in
lodging FIR, shall raise an inference that facts have been
tailored to sent a preconceived notion of suspicion or to
falsely implicate the appellant, therefore, statement of such
witness requires consideration with great care and caution.
In this context the prosecution case has to be adjudged
about the presence of complainant and alleged eyewitness.
The first circumstance would be that report has been
lodged after preliminary investigation i.e. after conducting

autopsy of the deceased by the doctor. Had the
complainant and alleged eyewitness present at the spot,
they would have taken the dead body to Police Station or
to hospital hurriedly and before conducting postmortem by
the doctor, must have lodged the report promptly. It is well
settled law that FIR is always considered as a basic
document in criminal cases, but if the same was recorded
after preliminary investigation, it loses its sanctity and
probative worth as such becomes a suspect document. In

this regard guidance can be derived from the judgments in

case titled, “Iftikhar Hussan_and others Vs the State”
(2004 SCMR 1185 and in case “Muhammad Waif Khan
and others vs the State and others” (2011 P Cr L J 470

Lahore), such an FIR cannot be treated either sacrosanct or
authentic, albeit, delay in reporting the occurrence shall
cast serious doubts about presence of the complainant and
eyewitness Ibrahim at the time of occurrence with the
deceased.

8. Complainant Fanoos Khan (PW.10) and Ibrahim
(PW.11) pose themselves to be the eyewitnesses of the
occurrence, were under laden duty to make their testimony
believable and reliable. They were required to satisfy the
mind of the court about their presence at the spot at the
time of occurrence through physical circumstances as well
as through corroborative evidence, but the evidence
produced by the prosecution most particularly the

statements of above named two witnesses have
embellished their deposition with falsehood and
exaggeration. The unnatural conduct of the witnesses can
be adjudged from their stunning into silence and idle
spectators even after witnessing the ghastly murder of their
close relative with their own eyes.

9. Complainant Fanoos Khan and Ibrim while
appearing as PW.10 and PW.11, respectively, in their
examination-in-chief, though have reiterated the same
story as set forth in the initial report Exh.PA/1, however, in
cross-examination their deposition was shaken so harshly
that they could not stuck firm on their statements. They
disclosed they are residents of village Nandrak while the
occurrence has taken place in the shop of Ghulam Hassan,
situated in village Jalaroona. In cross-examination both the
witnesses have admitted that Village Jalarona and
Nandrak, are two separate villages, lying at a distance of
about 12 Kilometers from each others. In this view of the
matter, both being not the residents of village Jalarona, are
chance witnesses. As per ratio of judgment of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in case titled, “Mst. Rukhsana Begum and
others vs Sajjad and others” (2017 SCMNR 596), chance
witness was one who, in the normal course was not
supposed to be present on the crime spot unless he offered
cogent, convincing and believable explanation, justifying
his presence at the spot. No explanation, much less

convincing and satisfying, has been furnished by PW.10
and PW.11 about their presence at the crime spot at the
time of occurrence. In cross-examination complainant
(PW.10) deposed that he can differentiate different kinds
of weapons. Perusal of his report Exh.PA/1 reveals that he
has not disclosed specifically about the description of
weapons used by the accused, rather, words “Aslaha
Atesheen” have been mentioned therein. “Aslaha
Atesheen” is a general term having wider application,
through which all types/kinds of firearms can be covered.
Usually this term is used by a procured witness so as to
show his presence at the spot and that the crime empties,
crime weapon and the medical evidence may not contradict
his version/report. As per prosecution version, the
occurrence has taken place inside the shop of Ghulam
Hassan and similarly, in the site plan, complainant
(PW.10) and Ibrahim (PW.11), have been shown inside the
said shop in close proximity with the accused. In such
eventuality, had they been present at the spot, they would
have easily recognized the weapon in possession of the
accused. Thus, intentional non-mentioning of specific
description of the weapons used in the occurrence is
another strong circumstance which creates doubt about
their presence at the spot at the time of occurrence. No
blood has been shown recovered from the Cot/Bed or any
bloodstained piece of rope of the Cott/Bed, on which the

deceased was allegedly sitting at the time of occurrence
10

inside the shop. Thus, this aspect of the case does not
corroborate the ocular version of the alleged eyewitnesses.

10. Both the PWs have deposed that after receiving
injuries the deceased died at the spot, but medical evidence
negates their version, as Dr. Said Badshah (PW.2), who
conducted autopsy on the dead body of the deceased, has
opined probable time between injuries and death as within
one hour. Ghulam Hussan, in whose shop the occurrence
has taken place, has not been examined. No bullet marks
have been noticed by the I.O. on wall of the shop lying in
the firing range from the place attributed to the appellant in
the site plan. Adjacent to the crime shop, the shop of one
Nabi Hssan has been shown, but he has also not been
examined. The dead body of the deceased was allegedly
shifted to the hospital by the complainant (PW.10) and
Ibrahim (PW.11), but none of them has been shown as
identifier of the dead body in the inquest report. Statements
of both the purported eyewitnesses to the effect that they
were not fired at by the accused and that they did not try to
apprehend the accused having no concern with them, is
also beyond the comprehension of a prudent mind. Ibrahim
(PW.11) has admitted the fact that his father and uncle
were charged in the murder case of Noor-ul-Amin son of
Aresh (acquitted co-accused). If this witness was present
on the spot, the assailants would never have forgiven him,

because the assailants who were mentally prepare to kill
11

the deceased, they would have not spare the direct inimical
person towards them so as to deposed against them in the
court of law. The unnatural behavior of PW.11 viz after
witnessing the crime, stood stunned into silence and
petrified for sufficient time, particularly, when his father
and uncle were directly charged for murder of the brother
of appellant, is sufficient to prove that he was not present

at the spot and was procured later on. In case titled, “Mst.

Rukhsana Begum and others Vs Sajjad _and_ others”

(2017 SCMR 596), in identical situation has observed as
under:-

“Site plan positions would show that the
complainant and the prosecution witnesses
were at the mercy of the assailants but no
threat was extended to them. Such
unbelievable courtesy extended by the
accused persons to the complainant and
prosecution witnesses, knowing well that
they would deposed against them create
serious doubts in the prosecution case. Such
behavior on the part of the accused persons
ran counter to natural human conduct and the
behavior explained in the provisions of
Art.129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984. Accused were acquitted of all the
charges leveled against them.

The nutshell of the above discussion is that both the
purported eyewitnesses failed to establish their presence at
the spot through physical and corroborative evidence.

Rather, their testimonies are suffering from major
12

contradictions and discrepancies, which makes their
presence at the spot highly doubtful. Similarly, medical
evidence also negates the testimonies of the purported
eyewitnesses. From the peculiar facts and circumstances of
the case it can be inferred that both the purported
eyewitnesses being relatives of the deceased and residents
of village Nandrak were not present at the spot, rather after
the occurrence, they were informed. By then the dead body
of the deceased had already been shifted to the hospital
where autopsy had been conducted and thereafter the
purported eyewitnesses reached the hospital and lodged the
report after due deliberation, consultation and preliminary
investigation and this why a delay of about 3 hours and 15
minutes occurred in lodging the report.

11. The above discussed facts and circumstances of
the case appearing in the prosecution evidence escaped the
notice of learned trial Court, resultantly, he reached an
erroneous conclusion by holding the appellant guilty of the
offence. Moreover, the learned trial court by disbelieving
the same set of evidence, acquitted co-accused Amresh
Khan but convicted the appellant, probably applying the
principle of “sifting grain from the chaff’, which principle
has been done away with by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in

its authoritative and elaborate judgment, rendered in case

of Hizar Hayat (PLD 2019 SC-527) by thrashing out the
13

entire law on the principle right from 1925 till date. The

relevant part of the judgment is reproduced below:-
“We may observe in the end that a judicial system
which permits deliberate falsehood is doomed to fail
and a society which tolerates it is destined to self-
destruct. Truth is the foundation of justice and justice
is the core and bedrock of a civilized society and, thus,
any compromise on truth amounts to a compromise on
a society's future as a just, fair and civilized society.
Our judicial system has suffered a lot as a consequence
of the above mentioned permissible deviation from the
truth and it is about time that such a colossal wrong
may be rectified in all earnestness. Therefore, in light
of the discussion made above, we declare that the rule
falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus shall henceforth be
an integral part of our jurisprudence in criminal
cases and the same shall be given effect to, followed
and _ applied by all the courts in the country in its
letter and spirit.” (Emphasis supplied)

12. No appeal has been filed against acquittal of co-
accused Amresh Khan either by the State or complainant.
In this view of the matter findings of the learned trial Court
qua acquittal of co-accused disbelieving the same
evidence, has attained finality.

13. On reappraisal of the evidence with care and
caution, we have reached to an irresistible conclusion that
prosecution has failed to prove its case against the

appellant beyond any reasonable doubt. We, while
14

extending benefit of doubt to the appellant, allow this
appeal and set aside his conviction and sentence recorded
by the learned trial court vide impugned judgment dated
06.07.2019. The appellant is acquitted of the charge. He be
set at liberty forthwith, if not required in any other case.

14. These are the reasons of our short order of even
date, which is reproduced below:-

For reasons to be recorded later, we, allow
this appeal, set-aside the conviction and
sentence of the appellant, namely, Rooh-ul-
Amin son of Muhammad Amin, recorded
under section 302 (b) PPC, by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-ITI/Model
Criminal Trial Court Nowshera, vide
judgment dated 06.07.2019, in case FIR
No.817 dated 24.09.2013, under sections
302/34 PPC, Police Station Akora Khattak
and hereby acquit him of the charges in the
cited case. He be set at liberty forthwith, if
not confined in any other case.
