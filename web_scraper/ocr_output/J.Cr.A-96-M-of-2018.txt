water tub/cane, wherein the appellant had dipped the
head of the deceased, was taken into possession vide

25.06.2017 who recorded his confessional statement
Ex PW-15/2. Later on 29.06.2017 section 7 of the
Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 was added in the case as
bet opinion of DPP. The F.S.L report regarding
blood and blood stained articles is Ex.PW-10/2,

which is positive for human blood.

After investigation, the Investigating

Agency submitted challan before the learned Anti-
Terrorism Court for trial of the appellant. Formal
charge was framed against him to which he did not
plead guilty and put himself at the option to face the
trial for the offences. The prosecution, in order to
prove its case against him, produced and examined
bs many as fifteen out of twenty-six PWs listed in

the calendar of witnesses.

| . When examined u/s 342, Cr.P.C, the
appellant negated the allegations leveled against him
by prosecution. He retracted his confession and
opted to record his statement on oath, however, he
did not produce any witness in his defence. His
statement on oath was accordingly recorded on
27.03.2018;

é On conclusion of trial, the learned trial
Court vide judgment dated 11.04.2018 convicted
him ws 302(b), 376 PPC and 7 ATA, the detail of
sentences has already been given in the earlier part
of this judgment. Hence, this appeal and the
connected murder reference.

2 We have paid our anxious consideration
to arguments of learned counsels for the parties as
well as learned Assistant A.G. for State and gone
through the record with their able assistance.

& . First we would take up the point
regarding applicability of section 6 of the Anti-
Terrorism Act, 1997 (The Act) to the present case
which is punishable u/s 7 of the Act, and likewise
we would also consider the legal position of trial of
the present appellant by the said forum which
culminated in conviction of the appellant under the

said penal provision of the Act as well as under

Tojamuves*| DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice ishtlag (brahim
: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wier Ahmad
Tolamuyes*|

“Te

sections 302(b) and 376 P.P.C. The main crux of
arguments of learned counsel for the appellant on
the point is that section 6 of the Act cannot be
attracted to facts and circumstances of the present
case in view of various judgments of the august
Supreme Court of Pakistan as well as this Court,
therefore, not only conviction of the appellant w/s 7
of the Act is illegal but the entire proceedings
donducted by Anti-Terrorism Court are against the

|

law. The above contention of learned counsel for the
|

appellant was rebutted by learned counsel for the
complainant.

9. The issue regarding applicability of
section 6 of the Act to particular cases has remained
a debated topic before the august Supreme Court as
well as High Courts and the view which was
persistently taken in this regard is that all the acts
mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the Act,
if committed with design/motive to intimidate the
government, public or a segment of the society, or
the evidence collected by prosecution suggest that
the aforesaid aim is either achieved or otherwise
appears as a by-product of the said terrorist
activities, are to be dealt with by the special Courts

| .
stablished under the Act. Thus, the test to

os: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
i Hon‘ble Mr Justice Wigar Ahmad
Toamuys*|

-8-—

determine whether a particular act is terrorism or not
is the motivation, object, design or purpose behind
the act and not the consequential effect created by
such act. In the present case, the allegation against
the appellant is that he raped a 5/6 years old girl in
an under-construction room on the rooftop of his
house and thereafter committed her murder. No
doubt, the offence of rape prior to the Anti-
Terrorism (Amendment) Ordinance, 2001 was a
scheduled offence but after restructuring section 6,
the offence of rape is no more a terrorist act as the
same does not appear in sub-section (2) of section 6
of the Act, hence, the said offence does not fall
within the cognizance of the Anti-Terrorism Courts.
As regards the charge of murder against the present
appellant, the mode and manner of the occurrence
does not suggests his design for creating fear and
terror in the public rather his only aim was to satisfy
his lust with the minor girl and, per prosecution
version, after achieving that goal he killed her in
order to conceal his crime. No doubt, a minor girl
was killed in a brutal manner, however, it is
persistent view of the august Supreme Court that
mere gravity or brutal nature of an offence would

not provide a valid yardstick for bringing the same

oe: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiger Ahmed
Talamul/Ps* |

-9-

within the definition of terrorism. This view was re-
affirmed by the larger Bench of the august Supreme
Court of Pakistan in a recent judgment in the case
titled Ghulam Hussain and others Vs. The State and
others reported as PLD 2020 Supreme Court 61,
and finally it was concluded in the said judgment

that:

For what has been discussed above it is
concluded and declared that for an action or
threat of action to be accepted as terrorism
within the meanings of section 6 of the Anti-
Terrorism Act, 1997 the action must fall in
subsection (2) of section 6 of the said Act and
the use or threat of such action must be
designed to achieve any of the objectives
specified in clause (b) of subsection (1) of
section 6 of that Act or the use or threat of
such action must be to achieve any of the
purposes mentioned in clause (c) of subsection
(1) of section 6 of that Act. It is clarified that
any action constituting an offence, howsoever
grave, shocking, brutal, gruesome or
horrifying, does not qualify to be termed as
terrorism if it is not committed with the
design or purpose specified or mentioned in
clauses (b) or (c) of subsection (1) of section 6
of the said Act. It is further clarified that the
actions specified in subsection (2) of section 6
of that Act do not qualify to be labeled or
characterized as terrorism if such actions are
taken in furtherance of personal enmity or
private vendetta.

Thus, the offences in the present case
do not qualify the meanings of section 6 which is

punishable u/s 7 of the Act. This Court, after

op: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Me, Justice Winar Ahmad:
Taremuyes|

-10-
scanning the entire evidence and material available
on record, has come to the conclusion that Section 7
of the Act is not applicable to the present case in
light of the judgment of the larger bench in Ghulam

Hussain’s case supra.

10. Now the questions before this Court

that in light of the ibid judgment of the larger Bench,
what would be the fate of the case when otherwise
the appellant was found guilty of the offences u/s
376 and 302, P.P.C and whether conviction of the
appellant under the aforesaid penal sections of the
Pakistan Penal Code can be maintained or not. The
Anti-Terrorism Court, after taking cognizance of a
non-scheduled offence, is vested with powers u/s 23
of the Act to transfer the case to a Court having
jurisdiction. For ready reference the said provision is
reproduced below:

23. Power to transfer cases to regular Courts.
Where after taking cognizance of an offence, an
Anti Terrorism Court is of opinion that the
offence is not a scheduled offence, it shall,
notwithstanding that it has no jurisdiction to try
such offence, transfer the case for trial of such
offence to any court having jurisdiction under the
Code, and the Court to which the case is
transferred may proceed with the trial of the
offence as if it had taken cognizance of the
offence.

| This Court exercises its jurisdiction as

an appeal Court u/s 25 of the Act read with section

OB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice (shtiag (brahim
Hon’ble Mr, Justice Wing Ahmad
Tajamul/PS*}

-11-

410, Cr.P.C and it is an admitted legal position that
appeal is continuation of the trial. The powers of this
Court as appeal Court whether u/s 25 of the Act or
under section 410, Cr.P.C, are regulated by section
423, CrP.C which confers vast powers on appeal
Court regarding reversal, alteration, reduction or

changing the nature of the sentence awarded to a
t

t

i

convict by trial Court. The said provision is

\ “
'

reproduced below for ready reference.

423. Powers of Appellate Court in disposing of
appeal.--(1) The Appellate Court shall then send
for the record of the case, if such record is not
already in Court. After perusing such record, and
hearing the appellant or his pleader, if he appears,
and the Public Prosecutor, if he appears, and, in
case of an appeal under Section 411-A, sub-
section (2) or Section 417, the accused, if he
appears, the Court may, if it considers that there
is no sufficient ground for interfering dismiss the
appeal, or may —

(a) in an appeal from an order of acquittal,
reverse such order and direct that further
inquiry be made, or that the accused be
retired or sent for trial to the Court of
Session or the High Court, as the case
may be, or find him guilty and pass
sentence on him according to law;

(b) in an appeal from a conviction, (1)
reverse the finding and sentence and
acquit or discharge the accused, or order
him to be retired by a Court of
competent jurisdiction subordinate to
such Appellate Court or sent for trial, or
(2) alter the finding, maintaining the
sentence, or, with or without altering
the finding, reduce the sentence, or,
(3) with or without such reduction and
. with or without_altering the finding,
alter the nature of the sentence, but,
subject to the provisions of Section 106,
sub-section (3), not so as to ‘enhance the
same;

(c) in an appeal from any other order, alter
or reverse such order;

DB: Hon’bie Mr. justice Ishtiag Ibrahim:
TapmulPse|

-12-
(4) make any amendment or any

consequential or incidental order that
may be just or proper.

(Emphases supplied)

Since, the appellant/convict in the
present case has been given fair and proper
opportunity of cross-examination of the PWs; he has
been examined u/s 342, Cr.P.C and even his
statement on oath was also recorded during the
course of trial, thus, we do not see any illegality or
even an irregularity in the entire proceedings
conducted by learned trial Court. Thus, this Court
while exercising its powers w/s 25 ATA or 410,
Cr.P.C read with section 423, Cr.P.C, has the powers
to look into conviction and sentences of the present
appellant recorded by trial Court under the general
law without remanding the case to the Court of
Sessions for deciding the case in exercise of its
ordinary criminal jurisdiction on the basis of
evidence recorded by Special Court. If the
conviction was found by this Court to be well-
seasoned and no illegality or material irregularity
was available on the face of record which would
vitiate the trial, in that eventuality this Court can
exercise its jurisdiction to set aside the conviction

under one head by maintaining the conviction and

DB: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
TalamuyPs*

-13-

sentence under the other head subject to appraisal of
evidence brought on file by prosecution. Wisdom in
this regard is drawn from the judgment of the august
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Waris Ali
and_5 others Vs. The State (2017 SCMR 1572)
wherein the appellants were initially charged u/s
302/324/452/436 P.P.C read with section 148 & 149,
P.P.C whereas sections 6 and 7 (a) of the Act were
subsequently added to the case. The trial Court in
the mentioned case, inter alia, awarded death
sentences to the appellants u/s 7(a) ATA which were
confirmed by the Lahore High Court in appeals. The
august Supreme Court of Pakistan, after hearing
appeal of the convicts, set aside their conviction u/s
section 7(a) of the Act by converting the same to one
under section 302(b), P.P.C and reduced the
gentences from death to life imprisonment in view of
the facts and circumstances of that particular case.
The relevant portion of the ibid judgment is as

under:

31. Accordingly, the conviction of the
appellants under section 7(a) of the Special
Act, is set aside and the same is converted to
one under section 302(b), P.P.C. however,
keeping in view the peculiar circumstances of
the case, this Court is influenced by caution
and for securing the ends of justice in the
matter of sentence because all was not well

OB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim:
if
Tajamul/Ps*,

-14-

with the complainant and the Prosecution, the
possibility that innocent persons amongst the
guilty one were also involved, could not be
altogether ruled out, thus, the death sentences
awarded to all the appellants are reduced to
life imprisonment on the counts mentioned in
the impugned judgment but under section
302(b), P.P.C. and the conviction and
: sentences awarded to them under section 6
! read with section 7 of the Special Act are set
aside.

lL Now we would look into conviction and
sentence of the appellant u/s 376 and 302 (b), P.P.C
recorded by learned trial Court in the impugned
judgment. It is a case of rape cum murder of a minor
girl for which the present appellant was charged by
father of the deceased/victim. The fact regarding
rape and murder of the deceased surfaced on
recovery of her dead body from a place near the
house of the present appellant, therefore, in the
mentioned circumstances the prosecution cannot be
expected to produce eye witness of the occurrence.

The evidence against the appellant in the present

‘
i

case consists of his judicial confession as well as
circumstantial evidence in shape of medical
evidence as well as recoveries of incriminating
articles from the spot and rooftop of the appellant’s

house.

OB: Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag ibrahim
-15-
12, ¢t Itis discernible from the record that the
appellant has recorded his confession before the
concerned Judicial Magistrate (PW-15) . on

25.06.2017 which is as under:

13. Although the confession was recorded

with delay because the appellant was arrested on

21.06.2017 and his confession was recorded on

Tajamul/Ps* . oB: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim,
-16->
25.06.2017, however, the mentioned delay would
not damage the reliability of the confession in view
of its confidence inspiring nature and its full
corroboration by circumstantial evidence on the
record. Confession of an accused and its different
aspects in each case is to be looked into in light of
its attending facts and circumstances, therefore, it is
not a rule of universal application that in each and
every case the delay will essentially damage the
evidentiary value of confession. Reliance is placed
on “Majeed V/s. The State ” 2010 SCMR 55

wherein it was held that: °

“10. No doubt there was delay of 12 days in
recording the confession but this by itself is
not sufficient to discard the same. This Court
in the case of Nabi Bakhsh v. State 1999
SCMR 1972 held that delay in recording the
confessional statement by itself is not

| Sufficient to affect its validity. However, no
hard and fast rule can certainly be laid down
about the period within which the
confessional statement of the accused ought
to be recorded during _ investigation.
Reference is also invited to Muhammad
Yaqoob v. State 1992 SCMR 1983”.

5

The Judicial Magistrate (PW-15) has
followed the relevant procedure while recording the
statement of the confessing appellant and any
illegality or even a material irregularity could not be

DB: Hon’bte Mr. Justice ishtlag Ibrahim,
Hen‘bis Mr. Justice Winer Ahmad
-17-
|
found in the entire proceeding conducted by him.
Prosecution has produced the Judicial Magistrate as

PW-15 who stated in his examination-in-chief that:

i

The accused stated before me in Pashto and I
recorded his statement word by word in Urdu.
After recording his confessional statement, I read
over the same to him and he thumb impressed his
Statement as a token of its correctness.

He confirmed his above narrations even

in his cross-examination by stating that:

i I made the accused understand about my status

and also read over the entire statement to him
after recording his statement when he admitting
the contents already recorded by me, he made his
thumb impression on his statement.

Perusal of the confessional statement,
the questionnaire filled in response to his replies and
duly thumb impressed by him and the certificate
endorsed by Judicial Magistrate would reveal that
the appellant has recorded his statement when he
was well within his knowledge regarding
significance and consequences of his confession.
Thus, we have no doubt or suspicious in our mind
regarding voluntariness of the appellant to record his
true confession by admitting his guilt with regard to
committing rape as well as murder of the minor girl.

Talamuyes*} 08; Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mir Justice Wioar Ahmad
-18-
14. There is also circumstantial evidence of
reliable nature on record against the appellant which
proves his proper nexus with the offences of rape
and murder of a little girl in a brutal manner. The
minor deceased was examined by lady Dr. Noon
Saha (PW-12). Her report Ex.PW-12/1 has already
been reproduced above, however, for the sake of

convenience the important and most relevant portion

thereof is once again replicated below:

Dry blood on her both feet and active bleeding
Jrom vagina, hymen was ruptured and there is
vaginal tear extending to rectum involving
muscles mucosa.

Rape of the minor girl prior to her
murder is abundantly “clear from the above
observations of the lady doctor who has also
observed bruises marks on neck of the deceased and
mentioned the cause of death as asphyxia due to
manual strangulation and throttling. She admitted in

her cross-examination that:

The bruises on the neck were found, one was 1
cm while the other was 2 cm in size. It might have
been caused by the index finger and thumb finger
at the time of commission of offence by the
accused.

The above observations of the doctor
are in line with confession of the appellant wherein
he has admitted that the minor became unconscious

when he subjected her to rape and thereafter he

Tafamul/PS* | 08; Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Winer Ahmed
-19-
killed her by pressing her neck. Thus, medical
evidence available on record abundantly

corroborates the confession of the appellant.

15. According to site plan Ex.PB, dead
body of the girl, covered with sacks, was recovered
from Point No.1 near the house of the present
appellant. The three blood-stained sacks, in which
the dead body was covered, labeled as Al-Fateh
Flour and General Mills, Malak Flour ‘Mills and
Askari Cement were seoured vide recovery memo
Ex.PW-8/2 whereas blood-stained sand from the
said place was taken into possession vide recovery
memo Ex.PW-8/1. This point is at distance of 120,
125 and 170 feet respectively from Points C, D & E
shown on the rooftop of the present appellant.
During investigation, the I.O recovered a pair of
slippers, placed on an old cot and covered with a
tarpaulin , from point “C”, which belonged to
deceased as identified by her father/complainant .
The cot and tarpaulin were also taken into
possession alongwith slippers vide recovery memo
Ex.PW-8/3. Two empty bags of Askari Cement were
lifted from point “D” which were taken into
possession vide recovery memo Ex.PW-8/4. Point

“E” is a portion of the under-construction room on

Taamuyese| t oe: Hon'ble Mr. Justice tshtlag tbrahim
i Hontble Mr, Justice Winer Ahmed
Tajaruy/Pss|

-20-

the rooftop of the appellant’s house from where
blood was recovered through cotton vide recovery
memo Ex.PW-8/6. Point “1B” adjacent to point “E”

was latter added with red ink in the site plan on
|

pointation of the appellant where the minor girl was
subjected to rape. Bakhti Khan SI, the Investigating
Officer, when appeared before the Court during trial

as (PW-10), stated in his cross-examination that:

First of all, I visited the place from where the
dead body was recovered and collected blood
from the place of presence of dead body. I also
recovered three sacks blood stained. The place
from where the dad body was recovered was
preserved through police constable....... On
22.06.2017, afier the recovery of three sacks, I
also took into possession one pair of shoes of
deceased, a Chrpai and on Tarpal........ At the
time of recoveries of different articles from the
house of the accused, a lady constable
accompanied me.

Prosecution has also produced Saqib-ur-
Rehman as PW-8 in support of the mentioned
recoveries who has verified the same in his

examination-in-chief. In cross-examination he stated
'

that:

The charpai Ex.P-5 was lying on the roof of the
house of the accused. Since new construction was
in progress, therefore, I cannot say exactly, how
many rooms were there on the roof of the house
of the accused. ....... the blood from the roof was
obtained through a piece of cotton.

The FS. report (Ex.PW-10/2)

regarding the blood and blood-stained articles

08: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishttaq tbrahim
t
| -2)-
mentioned above is positive for human blood.
Keeping in view the natural mode and manner of the

above mentioned recoveries from the spot coupled

_with photographs taken during pointation by the

Tajamulyes*| ,

appellant as well as the confidence inspiring
statements of PWs, any probability of false
procurement of the said evidence by police is

excluded.

16. Prosecution has established presence of
the appellant in the same vicinity through

trustworthy and reliable evidence. He stated in his

_ confession that after disposing of the dead body he

! .
confronted with Irshad but came back to his house

being nervous.’ Prosecution has produced the said
Irshad as PW-13. He verified in his statement that he
was coming from duty when in the meanwhile he
saw the appellant who was disturbed and was
proceeding to his house. Jehangir, who is son of the
niresent appellant, appeared before the Court as
PW-7. According to his statement, while busy with
other people in digging grave for the deceased, he
received information regarding involvement of his
father in the offence, hence, came from the

further stated that he was satisfied with regard to
commission of the crimes by his father being of
notorious character. In cross-examination he
confirmed that there was no ill-will between them

and the accused party rather they were enjoying their

lives jointly. He further admitted that:

It is correct that I have said in previous statement

; recorded u/s 164, Cr.P.C that the character of my

father is not good rather he was a man of
malicious character, however, there was no FIR
registered against the accused/my father.

This witness had no motive to falsely
depose against his own father, therefore, his

statement, being worth credence, can be relied upon
in support of the prosecution case. The appellant has
recorded his statement on oath and admitted in his
cross-examination that PW Jehangir (PW-7) was
residing with him in the same house before his
involvement in the present case. Although he denied
his nexus with the occurrence but admitted his
presence in his house as well arrest by police on the
same day. To sum up, presence of the appellant on
the day of occurrence in the same village and even

near the place of recovery of the dead body is

established.

17. After thrashing out the material on
record, we have come to the conclusion that the
prosecution story stands to reason and is natural,
convincing and free from any inherent
improbability. All the circumstances mentioned
above are inter-linked with each other in the manner
making out an unbroken. chain connecting the
present appellant with rape and murder of the
deceased, thus, qualifies the criteria of acceptable
circumstantial evidence discussed by the august —

Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Hashim

Qasim and another Vs. The State (2017 SCMR 986)

wherein it was laid down that:

Placing reliance on circumstantial evidence, in
cases involving capital punishment, the
superior Courts since long have laid down
stringent principles for accepting the same. It
has been the consistent view that such evidence
must be of the nature, where, all circumstances
must be so inter-linked, making out a single
chain, an unbroken one, where one end of the
same touches the dead body and the other the
neck of the accused.

18. Learned counsel for the appellant
objected non-availability of DNA report regarding
blood of the appellant to ascertain his nexus with
rape of the deceased. No doubt, the DNA report is
not available on record though his blood and vaginal

swab of the victim were sent for the said purpose,

Tajamuyes*| ‘ 8: Hon’bte Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr Justice Winar Ahmad
however, it was not the requirement of law to test his

t

blood for DNA for determination of the fact that the

semen found on the body or garments of the victim

was of the present appellant. This view was taken by
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in another recent
judgment handed down in the case of Faroog

Ahmad Vs. The State (PLD 2020 S.C 313) by

observing that:

t
‘

The rape having being established, was it then
necessary to conduct a DNA test to determine
that the semen retrieved from the victim's
body and shalwar was of the petitioner. We do
not think that such DNA testing was required
under the circumstances. Moreover, DNA
testing is. not a requirement of law. In
Shakeel's case (above) it was held (in
paragraph 9), that: .

It is well-established by now that
"omission of scientific test of semen
status and grouping of sperms is
neglect on the part of prosecution
which cannot materially affect the
other evidence." In this regard we are
Sortified by the dictum as laid down in
case titled Haji Ahmad v. State (1975
SCMR 69)...
In the above cited case of Haji Ahmad v. State
(1975 SCMR 69) the father had raped his step-
daughter and his conviction was sustained by
this Court in the absence of a DNA test; the
Trial Court had relied on the girl's testimony,
chemical examiner's report confirming
existence of semen on vaginal swabs taken
from her and the medico-legal report showing
her to have been sexually molested. Similarly,
this Court in the case of Irfan Ali Sher v. State
(Jail Petition No. 324/2019, decided on 17 April
2020) upheld a conviction under section 376
PPC in the absence of a DNA test. Rejecting
the petitioner's argument that 'DNA report

-25-

was not sought! this Court held (in paragraph
3), that:

As regards the semen not being sent
for DNA forensic determination with
a view fo link it with the perpetrator is
not a requirement of law.

It is also not desirable that we should impose
additional conditions to prove a charge of
rape, or of attempted rape, and to do so would
be a disservice to victims, which may also have
the effect of ‘enabling predators and
perpetrators. However, there may be cases
where an accused's DNA is retrieved for
i forensic determination to establish his guilt.
19. Upshot of the above discussion is that
prosecution has proved. the charge against the
present appellant beyond shadow of reasonable
doubt; the evidence on record has properly been
appreciated by trial Court while recording
conviction and sentence of the appellant, thus, the
impugned judgment, being well-reasoned, does not

calls for any interference. Resultantly, this appeal,

being bereft of merits, is accordingly dismissed. The

conviction and sentence recorded by trial Court vide
impugned judgment dated 11.04.2018 in case F.LR
No. 361 dated 21.06.2017 w/s 302 & 376 P.P.C is
maintained, however, his conviction and sentence
u/s 7 ATA is set aside, hence, he is acquitted of the

charge under the said head. Murder Reference
