SYED ARSHAD ALI, J.- Through this appeal,
appellant/convict, Saeed Ayaz son of Ibrahim has
assailed judgment dated 23.09.2019 of learned
Additional Sessions Judge-XII, Peshawar, rendered in
case F.I.R No1085 dated 05.12.2000 registered under
sections 302/324/34 P.P.C at Police Station Badhber,
Peshawar, whereby, he was convicted u/s 302 (c)
P.P.C and sentenced to undergo fifteen (15) years R.I
as Ta’zir, with directions to pay Rs.50,000/- (rupees
fifty thousand) as compensation to the legal heirs of

deceased Waris Khan in terms of section 544-A
Cr.P.C or in default to undergo six months S.I. He
was further convicted u/s 324/34 P.P.C and sentenced
to undergo five (05) years R.I for attempt at the lives
of PWs Baras Khan and Anwar Khan, with a fine of
Rs.20,000/- or in default to undergo six months S.I.
Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C was extended to the

convict-appellant.

2. On 05.12.2000 at 22:00 hours, complainant
Baras Khan (PW-6) reported the matter before the
police to the effect that his sons namely Waris Khan
and Anwar Khan would work in a bricks kiln situated
at Maira Musazai. In the same kiln, present appellant
and his co-accused namely Riaz and Mir Wali were
also working. On eventful day at 20:30 hours, on
hearing some noise, the complainant attracted to the
spot/kiln, where he saw a scuffle between his sons
and present appellant and co-accused on some matter.
All the three accused were armed and they started
firing at complainant-party, as a result of which, his
son namely Waris Khan sustained firearm injuries
while he (complainant) and his son PW Anwar

escaped unhurt. Injured Waris Khan succumbed to his
injuries on the way to the hospital. No motive was
disclosed by the complainant for the murder of the
deceased. This report of the complainant was reduced
in shape of murasila (Ex.PW6/1) by Abdul Hamid
(Rtd) Inspector (PW-10), on the strength whereof the
F.LR was registered against the appellant and co-

accused.

3. Complainant Baris Khan (PW-6) through the
FIR ibid had charged the present appellant Saeed
Ayaz as well as Riaz and Mir Wali already convicted

for the murder of his son Anwar.

4. Initially, co-accused namely Riaz and Mir Wali
were arrested and convicted in the case while the
present appellant was absconding and thus was
proceeded under section 512 Cr.P.C. On his arrest on
25.04.2018 and completion of investigation,
supplementary challan was submitted against the
appellant before the learned trial Court. After the
compliance of the provision of section 265 (c) Cr.P.C,
on 30.07.2018 the appellant was formally indicted to
which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In

order to substantiate its charge against the appellant
the prosecution produced as many as 13 witnesses
besides constables Amir Muhammad and Fazal
Qayum as CW-1 and CW-2. Thereafter, statement of
the appellant was also recorded u/s 342 Cr.P.C,
wherein he denied the allegations of the prosecution,
however, he neither wished to be examined on oath

nor desired to produce evidence in defence.

5. On conclusion of trial, the appellant was
convicted and sentenced by the learned trial Court in
the manner mentioned above through its judgment
dated 23.09.2019, hence, this criminal appeal.

6. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
complainant as well as learned AAG has raised a
preliminary objection that on the same set of
evidence which was recorded in earlier trial, co-
accused, namely, Riaz and Mir Wali were convicted,
therefore, this appeal also requires the same
treatment and as such the conviction be maintained
as the prosecution evidence remained successful in
establishing case against the present appellant.

7. Mr. Astaghfirullah, Advocate, learned counsel

representing the appellant while rebutting the
arguments of learned counsel for the
State/complainant has argued that under the criminal
law evidence recorded in the earlier proceedings even
in the same FIR cannot be considered for conviction
of an accused who is subsequently arrested and tried
through a separate trial. He has placed reliance on
“ZALEY MIR alias ZALEY..Vs..STATE” {PLJ
1999 Cr.C.(Peshawar) 1022}. In this view of the
matter this court would first address the aforesaid
objections/legal issue.

8. Arguments of learned counsel for the appellant
and learned AAG for the State assisted by learned
counsel for the complainant heard and _ record
perused.

9. The concept of independent and fair trial is
engrained in our criminal administration of justice
and for that reason when number of accused are
charged for an offence and some of them are arrested
in time and their case is investigated and then sent for
trial the outcome of this trial will have no bearing on
the trial of the accused who has been subsequently
arrested and tried. The Court seized of the subsequent

trial has to apply his independent judicial mind while
appreciating the evidence recorded in the said trial.
However, in exception circumstances when any of
the witness who had recorded his statement in the
earlier trial is not available in terms of Article 47 of
the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, his testimony can be
transposed to the subsequent trial but the said
statement should be very carefully examined keeping
in view the surrounding circumstances of each and
every case. The apex Court in the case of “ALLAH
DITTA..Vs..The STATE” {PLD 1960 Supreme
Court (Pak) 18} while hearing an appeal against the
judgment of the High Court where the High Court
while dealing with a case of absconder whose co-
accused faced the trial and were convicted, had
literally relied upon the findings recoded in earlier
judgment of the High Court of the co-accused and
sentenced the subsequently arrested accused. The
apex Court had remanded the case with direction that
the High Court has to apply independent mind to the
evidence recorded in a separate trial of the absconder
which was indeed the only case before the Court.
This issue was elaborately dealt with by the Indian

Supreme Court in case of “Megh Singh..Vs..State of
Punjab” (2004 SCC Cri. 58) wherein it has
observed;

“The acquittal of some of the co-accused based on
appreciation of evidence in their case is no ground
to bar a criminal trial as the appreciation by the
concerned judge in a criminal trial is not binding
when the latter case is tried in the case of the other
co-accused and it is for the learned trial Judge to
appreciate the evidence adduced in the latter case.
In that regard, possibly a particular witness may
or may not be believed and his reliability may also
be tested in the light of what he has stated in the
earlier case etc. But those are all matters for the
trial Judge to do. All that we want to say is that it
will not preclude the trial of the case for the mere

reason that the co-accused were acquitted”

This issue was reaffirmed in the case of “Gorle
Section Naidu..Vs..State_of AP” (AIR 2004 SC

1169). Similarly the full Court of Kerala High Court

in case of “Moosa..Vs..Sub_Inspector_of Police”
(2006 KHC 184) has observed;

“The acquittal of some of the accused by itself is
not a reason to bar the trial in the case of the other
accused. Here, the other accused was absconding.
It was also held by the Full Bench that in a trial
against the co-accused the prosecution is not
called upon, nor is it expected to adduce evidence

against the absconding co-accused”
Our own High Court in the case of
“HAYATULLAH..Vs..ALI_ ABBAS _and_another”
(2018 YLR Note 43) has also held a similar view.
Hence the objection is overruled.

10. Moving on to the merit of the case. The
incident was reported by complainant Baras Khan
(PW-6) on 15.12.2000 at about 2200 hours in Police
Post Mumraiz to the effect that his sons namely
Waris Khan and Anwar Khan would work in a bricks
kiln situated at Maira Musazai. In same kiln, present
appellant and his co-accused namely Riaz and Mir
Wali were also working. On eventful day at 20:30
hours, on hearing some noise, the complainant
attracted to the spot/kiln, where he saw a scuffle
between his sons and present appellant and co-
accused on some matter. All the three accused were
armed and they started firing at complainant-party, as
a result of which, his son namely Waris Khan
sustained firearm injuries while he (complainant) and
his son PW Anwar escaped unhurt. Injured Waris
Khan succumbed to his injuries on the way to the
hospital. No motive was disclosed by the

complainant. This report of the complainant was
reduced in shape of murasila (Ex.PW6/1) by Abdul
Hamid (Rtd) Inspector (PW-10), on the strength
whereof the F.I.R was registered against the appellant
and co-accused.

11. On the following day, Abdul Hamid
Inspector/Investigation Officer (PW-10) had visited
the spot and prepared the site plan (Ex.PB) wherein
the deceased has been shown at point-1 scuffling
with Riaz and in the same time he received firearms
injuries. The complainant Baras Khan is shown at
point No.2 and in between Riaz, deceased and
complainant there is a Hut (Chappar) having four
pillars. Anwar Khan (PW-7) has been shown at point
No.3 i.e. towards west of the Hut (Chappar) whereas
the complainant, deceased and Riaz convicted
accused were present on the northern and southern
side of the Hut (Chappar). Accused Saeed is shown
at point No.5 whereas Mir Wali the convicted
accused is shown at point No.6 of the site plan.

12. The deceased was examined by Dr. Shahida
(PW-8), according to which she has found the

following injuries:
10

1. F.A entry wound 0.5 cm in diameter on back left
chest 15 cm from midline and 10 cm below top of
shoulder.

2. F.A entry wound 0.5 cm in diameter on back right
chest 3 cm from midline and 7 cm below inferior
angel of scapula.

3. F.A entry wound 0.5 cm in diameter on right lateral
chest 19 cm below axilla and 19 cm from midline.

4. F.A exit wound 3x1 cm on front right chest 13 cm
from midline and 10 cm above nipple.

5. F.A exit wound 4x2 cm on front right chest 2 cm from
midline and 8 cm above coastal margin.

6. F.A exit wound 5x3 cm in size on front left chest 1
cm below top of shoulder and 10 cm from midline.

7. F.A gutter wound 9x1 cm on right thigh 9 cm below
iliac crest and 35 cm above knee.

8. F.A lacerated wound 7x4 cm on right forearm 3 cm
above wrist.

9. F.A lacerated wound 4x2 cm on back left hand 3 cm

above thumb.
13. The star witnesses i.e. complainant Baras Khan
and Anwar Shah appeared before the trial Court as
PW-6 and PW-7 respectively. Complainant Baras
Khan (PW-6) while appearing in the Court has
reaffirmed his allegation as recorded in the FIR
whereas Anwar Khan has appeared as PW-7.
Needless to mention that at the time of occurrence he

was a 12 years old boy. It appears from the statement
11

of PW-12 that Riaz (convicted accused) had some
sexual desire for PW-12 and that is the probable
motive for the occurrence. He in his statement, states
that he alongwith with deceased brother Waris Khan
would work in a brick kiln of Zaman Khan. On the
relevant date when they finished their work and were
preparing to leave the brick kiln for their house,
accused Riaz asked him that he should stay behind,
on this his deceased brother retaliated, which resulted
into firing. The accused/appellant who was facing
trial had fired at his brother, resultantly he died on
the spot and in the meanwhile his father also reached
at the spot. In his cross examination he states that he
cannot say that from whose fire shot the deceased
was hit and died. He also confirms that at the time of
occurrence it was dark however later he has
voluntary stated that there was a light present near
the place of occurrence.

14. The close perusal of the evidence, site plan and
medical evidence (the place and size of the injuries)
shows that the occurrence has taken place at the spur
of the time most probably for the reason that the

convicted accused Riaz had a sexual desire for Anwar
12

Khan who was a 12 years old boy. It was the doing of
one person for which three persons have been charged.
Whereas, all the three persons have been charged for
the said offence. Two of the accused have already
undergone their conviction. Thus keeping in view the
safe administration of justice the present appellant has
earned benefit of doubt as right. In the case of
“Farman Ali and 03 others...Vs...The State” (PLD
1980 Supreme Court 201), the apex Court while
granting benefit of doubt to the accused facing trial
had observed;

“In his dying declaration, Rashid Khan has
involved the three brothers as well as their friend,
Farman Ali. But the medical evidence and the
evidence of the Ballistic Expert do seem to cast
doubt on his veracity. The evidence of Doctor
Muhammad Kamal, who had conducted autopsy
on the dead body of Rashid Khan is that the size of
inlet of all the wounds suffered by him was the
same meaning thereby that he had been shot from
one or more than one weapon of the caliber. It is
in the evidence of the Ballistic Expert, however,
that the four empties sent to him for examination
were found to have been fired through 32 bore
pistol which was also sent to him by the
Investigation Officer. It would therefore follow
that Rashid Khan had been shot through a pistol
and certainly not through a rifle with which

Farman Ali is said to have been armed. It is true
15.
08:30 hours in the month of December and thus it
was dark at the time of occurrence. More particularly
in the circumstances when PW-7
examination admits that he does not know that whose
fire shot had hit the deceased creates serious doubts
in the prosecution story that all the accused while

committing the murder of the deceased Waris Khan

13

that according to the prosecution each one of the
three appellant brothers was armed with a 32 bore
pistol. But the type of injuries suffered by Rashid
Khan rather suggest that it was the work of one
man. It is common knowledge that 32 bore pistol is
an automatic weapon carrying in its charger seven
bullets. The fact that the deceased was found to
have suffered seven inlet wounds, three of them in
his left knee joint, one on his left elbow, two in his
abdomen and one in backward direction to his
right superior iliac spine, the inlet size of all of
which is said to be the same, would go a long way
to show that this could as well be the work of a
single person and not of the three appellants.
There is no evidence on the record to show,
however, as to which one of the three had caused
him the said injuries, therefore, no option is left
but to hold that the prosecution has failed to bring

home its case against any one of the appellants”

Apart from the above, the time of occurrence

were sharing common intention.

in his cross

16. The only circumstance in the account of the
appellant is his abscondence but on the point the law is
by now well-settled that the same alone is not
sufficient to record conviction on a capital charge and
it can be used only as a corroboratory and
confirmatory in support of ocular account but when the
ocular account is disbelieved then it is of a very little
value for court for consideration. Reliance in this
regard is placed on the case of Rasool
Muhammad..vs..Asal_ Muhammad _and_3_ others
reported in 1995 SCMR 1373, wherein has been held

that:--

“Abscondence per se is not proof of the
guilt of an accused person. Disappearance
of a person named as a murderer/culprit
after the occurrence is but natural, whether
named rightly or wrongly”

17. For the said murder accused Riaz and Mir Wali
have already been convicted, thus, keeping in view
the safe administration of justice and by extending the
benefit of doubt in the circumstances, the conviction
and sentence of the appellant/convict recorded by
learned trial Court in the impugned judgment is not
sustainable. Therefore, this appeal is allowed, the

impugned judgment dated 23.09.2019 of the learned
15

trial Court is set aside and appellant/convict is
acquitted of the charge leveled against him. The
appellant be released forthwith from jail if not

required in any other case.

18. Above are the reasons of our short order of the

even date.
