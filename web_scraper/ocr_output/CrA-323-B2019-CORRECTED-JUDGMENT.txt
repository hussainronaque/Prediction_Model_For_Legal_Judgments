For Appellants: Mr. Anwar-ul-Hag Advocate.

For State: Mr.Shahid Hameed Qurashi Addl:A.G.

For Respondents: Mr. Abdul Jabbar Khan Khattak Advocate.

SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- Rafagatullah, the appellant
has called in question the judgment dated 24.10.2019, of learned
Additional Sessions Judge-II, Karak, whereby appellant involved
in case F.[.R No. 198 dated 20.4.2018, registered at Police
Station Latamber, District Karak, has been convicted under
section 302(b) P.P.C and sentenced to death as Taazir, with
compensation Rs.200000/- to the legal heirs of deceased under
section 544 Cr.P.C or in default thereof to further undergo six
months SI. Murder Reference No.7-B/2019 has also been sent by
the learned trial Court for its confirmation, hence this judgment
shall decide both the criminal appeal and murder reference.

2. Brief facts of the case, as spelt out from the F.LR,

are that on 20.4.2018, at 1815 hours, Umar Fayaz, in injured
condition, at Emergency Room of K.D.A Hospital, Karak
reported the matter to Habibullah HC,(PW-1) to the effect that he
was busy in laboring through wheel barrow in cattle fair Ahmad
Abad, at about 07.00 hours, accused Rafaqatullah, duly armed
with firearm, arrived and on seeing him started firing at him, as a
result of which he was hit and sustained injuries and fell down.
The occurrence was witnessed by the persons present there. The
report of complainant was reduced in shape of Murasila Ex:PA,
and sent to the Police Station through constable Raufullah
No. 854,(PW-2), where’ Mumtaz Khan SI] culminated the
contents of Murasila into FIR Ex:PA/1. After preparing the
injury sheet Ex:PW 1/1, the injured complainant was sent to the
doctor under the escort of Noor Islam No.374. Later on, the
injured complainant succumbed to his injuries and section of law
324 P.P.C was altered with section 302 P.P.C. After completion
of investigation complete challan under section 512 Cr.P.C was
submitted before the learned trial Court 01.05.2018. The accused
was arrested on 15.07.2018. The prosecution after completion of
_ investigation submitted supplementary challan against the
accused/ appellant on 02.09.2018.

3. On commencement of trial, the learned trial Court
summoned the accused from jail, who was produced in custody.
The learned trial Court after complying with the provision of
section 265-C Cr.P.C, framed the charge against the appellant, to

which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution in

order to prove its case, produced and examined (10) PWs in
support of its case, whereafter, statement of accused/ appellant
was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he professed his
innocence, however, neither he wished ‘to be examined under
section 340(2) Cr.P.C., nor produced evidence in his defence.
The learned trial Court after hearing arguments of learned
counsels for the parties vide impugned judgment dated
24.10.2019, convicted and sentenced the appellant as mentioned
above. The accused/ appellant challenged the impugned
judgment through instant criminal appeal, while the Murder
Reference No.7 -B/2019 has also been sent by the learned trial
Court for its confirmation.

4. Arguments of leamed counsels for the parties heard
and the records perused with their valuable assistance.

5. The unfortunate incident occurred in the cattle: fair
of village Ahmad Abad, where the complainant was selling
vegetable in his handcart, it was at about 07.00 a.m, when he was
fired at by the accused, fell down on the ground and was rushed
- to the K.D.A hospital Karak, where in-the Emergency room his

report was taken down, wherein he stated that at the time of

occurrence he was busy in sellirig vegetable in the cattle fair

(Mela Muwashian) Ahmad Abad, when the accused/ appellant
fired at him and he fell down. No motive was given for the
offence. The prosecution story is based on the dying declaration

of the complainant, whereafter, his brother namely Muhammad

4

Riaz introduced himself as an eyewitness. The learned trial Court
relied upon the report of the deceased then injured and PW-10,
Muhammad Riaz, brother of the deceased and awarded death
sentence to the appellant. In order to reach a just conclusion this
Court is burdened with heavy duty to consider and reconsider the
available circumstances of the case and the status of the sole eye-
witness, who happens to be the brother of the deceased.

Muhammad Riaz was examined as PW-10, who stated that by
/

profession he was a labourer and also worked in Punjab. He
further stated that on the eventful day he was present in his
village and it was 06.30 a.m that he left his house for the cattle
fair to purchase household articles and was busy in the nearby
shops, when the accused Rafagatullah came and started firing at
his brother. He further stated that after receiving the fire shot the
deceased then injured fell to the ground and the appellant
decamped from the spot. He went on to say that he asked the
nearby people to arrange a vehicle for transportation of the
injured to the hospital and that in the meanwhile his uncle Mir
Sardar also reached to the spot, who took the injured in a Datsun
pickup to the hospital accompanied by other co-villagers and that
he was asked to stay on the spot. The prosecution case hinges on
the testimony of this witness and that was what-prevailed with
the learned trial Court. The learned trial Court could not
appreciate the status of this witness and his presence on the spot,

the way it should have been. This Court is to see as to whether

the occurrence happened in the manner as it was presented and
that whether the complainant was in fact present on the spot.
This is on record that soon after arrival of the injured to the
hospital his report was taken down by PW-01, Habibullah HC
°
and if this is presumed that the complainant was well oriented in
time and space then despite mentioning other people as witnesses
of the occurrence the complainant would have straightaway
named his brother Muhammad Riaz as the eye-witness but he
was not named so. Had he been present there he would have
been named in the report by the complainant and he would have
signed the F.I.R as a rider. This is again surprising that when the
complainant received firearm injuries, why PW-10 being present
on the spot did not accompany his injured brother to the hospital
to save his life. This witness ‘was put to lengthy and searching
cross-examination which he could not resist and when a question
was put to him that why he did not accompany his injured
brother to the hospital, he stated that soon after the occurrence
his uncle Mir Sardar réached to the spot and he with the help of
other co-villagers put the injured in the ‘vehicle left for the
hospital and directed him to stay on ‘the spot till arrival of the
Investigating Officer. The distance between the village of the
complainant and the cattle fair where the incident occurred, is
2/3 kilometers and the circumstances suggest that PW-10 and
other relatives got information in the village, and thereafter, they

came to the spot. The presence of PW-10 is further doubtful as

6

one of the marginal witness, namely, Ahmad Saeed who was
examined as PW-7, stated that he alongwith the Investigating
Officer reached to the spot at 10.35 a.m. and that no one from the
locality including the eye-witness was present there. He further
stated that after arrival to the spot the Investigating Officer
informed PW-10 to reach to the spot and accordingly he did. The
Investigating Officer recovered one empty of .30 bore alongwith
blood stained earth from place of the deceased and on pointation
of the eye-witness the site-plan was prepared. Despite the fact .
that Mir Sardar Khan was shown as identifier in the column of
identification in the inquest report, but he was not examined as
prosecution witness to confirm the presence of PW-10 at the time
of occurrence, the mode in which the vehicle was arranged and
the deceased then injured was shifted to the hospital. Habibullah
HC was examined as PW-01, who scribed the report and he
stated that the deceased was accompanied by 4/5 persons, but he
‘did not know them. Had Mir Sardar been present with the injured
in the hospital, then he would have introduced himself as uncle
of the deceased and would have at least signed the FJ.R as a
rider. The Investigating Officer was examined as PW-8, who
stated that when he reached to the spot many people were present
there but he did not ask any one regarding the occurrence and he
did not record the statements of the shop .keepers of the
surrounding — shops. The Investigating Officer took into

possession an empty handcart, allegedly used by the complainant

7

for selling vegetable, but nothing was brought on record to
substantiate the stance of the complainant and the eye-witness
regarding selling of vegetable on the spot. The eye-witness when
examined as PW-10, stated ‘that he had come from his house to
purchase household articles and that he was busy in the said
purchases when the incident occurred, even this witness could
not produce the articles he allegedly purchased from the shops as
this was the sole purpose of his presence. The prosecution could
not prove presence of the witness on the spot but it was after the
incident that PW-10 attracted from the village on getting
information regarding the incident. We have no other choice but
to hold that the witness was not presént on the spot. This PW i.e.
PW-10, stated that soon after the occurrence he asked the nearby

o

people to arrange the vehicle for transportation of the injured to

the hospital and that these were the people who arranged the .

vehicle and the injured was placed therein, but the Investigating
Officer did not bother to record the statements of the cleaner and
driver of the vehicle. If the witness ‘was present on the spot then
why he remained on the spot despite the fact that his brother after
receipt of the.fire shots had not then died and in such eventuality
the prime purpose with a brother present on the spot would be
nothing but to rush to the hospital and to save the life of his
brother. This witness has shown an unnatural conduct and the
way he behaved could not impress this Court to stamp him as a

truthful witness, rather he can be termed as interested and a

8 a

chance witness with the sole purpose to implicate the appellant
for commission of the offence, that too to fulfill the wishes of the
Investigating Officer.

6. Chance witness, in legal parlance, is one who claims
that he was present on the crime spot at the fateful time, albeit
his presence there was a sheer chance as in the ordinary course of
business, he was not supposed to be present on the spot, but
should have been present at the place where he resides, carries on
business and runs day to day life affairs: I is in this context that
the testimony of chance witness ordinarily, is not accepted unless
justiciable reasons are shown to establish his presence at the
crime scene at the relevant time. In normal course, the
presumption under the law would operate about his absence from
the crime spot. True that in rare cases, the testimony of chance
witness may be relied upon, provided some convincing
explanation appealing to prudent mind for his presence on the
crime spot are put forth, when the occurrence took place
otherwise, his testimony would fall within the category. of
suspected evidence and cannot be accepted without a pinch of
salt. In case titled Khalid Javed and another vs. The State (2003
SCMR_ 1419), it was observed that evidence of chance witness
would be acceptable subject to establishing his presence at the
place of incident and in the absence of corroborative evidence to
support the version of a chance witness the same had to be

excluded from consideration. Reference can also be made to the

cases reported as Javed Ahmad alias Jaida vs. The State (1978
SCMR 114), Muhammad Ahmad & another vs. The State &
others (1997 SCMR 89), Imran Ashraf & others vs. The State
(2001 SCMR 424) and Zafar Hayat vs. The State (1995 SCMR
896). In the case titled Allah Ditta_vs. The State (1999 YLR

1478), the Hon’ble Lahore High Court held that chance
witnesses cannot be safély relied upon on a capital charge in the
absence of satisfactory explanation regarding their presence near

the place of occurrence where they were ordinarily expected to

be present. In the case of Muhammad Akram vs. The State
2008 P.Cr LJ 993), it was observed that chance witness cannot
be believed safely if he fails to offer cause of his presence at the
spot at a given time. .

7. We have no intention of laying down an inflexible
rule that the statement of an interested witness can never be
accepted without corroboration. There may be an interested
witness whom the Court regards as incapable of falsely
implicating an innocent person. But he will be an exceptional
witness and, so far as an ordinary interested witness is
concerned, it cannot be said that it is safe to rely upon his
testimony in respect of every person against whom he deposes.
In order to satisfy that no innocent persons are being implicated
alongwith the guilty, the Court will in the case of an ordinary
interested witness look for some circumstance that gives

sufficient support to his statement so as to create that degree of

10

probability which can be made the basis of conviction. This is
what is meant by saying that the statement of an interested
witness ordinarily needs corroboration. In this respect, reliance is
placed on the case reported as Muhammad Ahmed & another
Vs. The State & others (1997 SCMR 89).
8. The injured was statedly brought to the hospital at
about 08.15 a.m where the matter was reported to one Habibullah
who prepared his injury sheet and sent the deceased then injured
under the escort of Noor Aslam constable to the doctor for his
medica} examination. The scribe was examined as PW-01, who
stated that the injured was received conscious and his report was
taken down, but his this stance cannot be accepted as correct as
he did not observed the legal formalities. Despite the fact that the
report was made in the emergency room of hospital, we are
surprised that why PW-1 did not feel the need to call for the
doctor and to ask for a certificate as to whether the injured was
oriented in time and space and to ascertain his capability to talk.
PW Habibullah stated that at the time of report the doctor was
not present and that it was after the report that the injured was
sent to the doctor alongwith injury sheet for his Medico-legal
examination. This attitude of the scribe cannot be ignored and
this fact has created dents in the prosecution case and it has put a
question mark to the capability of the deceased then injured to
talk. One Dr. Abdul Samad (PW-04), examined the complainant

and prepared his Medico-legal report, who stated that the injured

. 7

Fy
'
was conscious and capable to talk and that he had given these
observations in the Medico-legal report of the injured. The
record is silent as to where from PW-04, confirmed that the
injured was conscious, oriented in time and space, when there is
/
nothing on record that either his pulse was noted or blood
pressure was checked. This witness was thoroughly cross-
examined who stated that soon after bringing the injured before
him, he observed the injured in severe shock and without wasting
time the patient was referred for onward management to a
surgeon, when this witness has admitted that the patient was in
the state of severe shock then how it was held that the patient
was Conscious. No certificate was given by the doctor regarding
the condition of the injured and even the report of the injured
was not taken down in his presence. There was a willful attempt
on part of the prosecution and the doctor to make the case a
success. The deceased then injured was shifted to Peshawar for
onward treatment as his condition was turning from bad to worse
but he succumbed to the injuries and was brought back to the
hospital at 19.10 hours and thereafter his post mortem
examination was conducted. The post mortem report shows the

following:-

WOUNDS

1. One entry wound in the RHC (right hypochondria) 4cm

from costal margin and 10cm from midline, laparotomy

{
12

wound closed and dressed with bandages. The bullet entry
marked and signed. .
CRANIUM AND SPINAL CORD...... Normal

THORAX. _ All-the organs found normal
ABDOMEN, - _Walls, . peritoneum, pancreas, small

intestine, lever were found damaged,

When this was the condition of the deceased then injured and |
when the doctor who examined the injured neither attested the
report nor issued a certificate, this Court cannot exclude the

possibility that the patient was unable to talk and that no report

cy

was made by him.

2

In case titled Khyber Khan Vs. Shahid Zaman and

another (2019 P.Cr.L.J. Peshawar 979), it was held that:-

For believing a dying declaration, inter
alia, one of the essential ingredient is
that the prosecution shall establish
through cogent evidence that the dying.
man was in full senses, conscious and
alert to the surroundings, was fully
oriented in space and time and was able
to make a coherent statement and the
doctor present at the occasion shall
give a fitness certificate about the
condition of a dying man, but such is
not the case herein.

9. No doubt, dying declaration is an important piece of
evidence and that sanctity is attached to the dying declaration, \
because a dying man is not expected to tell lie, but it is equally ;

true that it is always considered as weak type of evidence being
un-tested by cross-examination, therefore, it puts the Courts on

guard and great care is demanded to ascertain that:-
1. Whether the maker has the physical capacity to make
the dying declaration.
2. Whether the maker had opportunity to identify the
assailant/assailants.
3. Whether there was a chance of mis-identification on
the part of dying man in identifving and naming the
allacker/attackers.
4. Whether it was free from prompting from any .
outside quarter; and
5. The witness who heard the deceased making his
statement, heard him correctly and whether this
evidence can be relied upon.
10. It is universal principle of criminal justice that dying
declaration by itself is not strong evidence being not tested by
way of cross- examination. The only reason for accepting the
same is the belief phenomenon of the Court of law that a person
apprehending death due to injuries, caused to him, is ordinarily
not expected to speak a falsehood. To believe or disbelieve a
dying declaration thus is left to the ordinary human judgment,
however, the Courts always insist upon strong, independent and
reliable corroboratory evidence for the sake of safe dispensation
of justice. Relying blindly and without proper scrutiny on such

statement, would be no less dangerous approach on the part of

the Courts of law.

In case titled Tahir Khan Vs. The State (2011
SCMR 646), it was held that:-

Mere dying declaration shrouded by and
fraught with so many infirmities is not
enough to convict a person.

14
In case titled Mst. Ghulam Zohra and another Vs.

Malik Muhammad Sadiq and-another (1997 SCMR 449), it has

been held that:-

“Police Officer had not obtained certificate
Jrom the Doctor before recording the statement
of the deceased in an injured condition that he
was in a fit condition to give the statement, nor
he had given a plausible explanation for such
omission and fitness of the deceased to make
the statement, thus, remained doubtful”.

In this respect, case reported as Raza Khan_Vs.

Razeem (2018 P.Cr.L.J. Peshawar Note 66) can also be referred.

HH. The motive alleged could not be proved. The motive

once alleged, if not established will weigh against the

prosecution. In case titled "Muhammad Ashraf alias Acchu Vs
The State" (2019 SCMR 652 Para-7), wherein it has been held:-

"7. The motive is always a double-edged
weapon. The complainant Sultan Ahmad
(PW9) has admitted murder enmity
-between the parties and has also given
details of the same in his statement
recorded before the trial court. No doubt,
previous enmity can be a reason for the
appellant to commit the alleged crime, but
it can equally be a reason for the
complainant side to falsely implicate the
appellant in this case for previous grouse."

ry

12. The learned counsel for the appellant vehemently
argued that the accused/appellant remained absconder for
sufficient long time, but mere absconsion of accused is not
conclusive guilt of an accused person; it is only a suspicious

circumstance against an accused that he was found guilty of the

15
offence. However, suspicions after all are suspicions, the same
cannot take the place of proof, the value of absconton, therefore,

depends on the facts of each case. In case titled "Liagat Hussain

and others Vs Falak Sher and others" (2003 SCMR 611 (a)

S

wherein it has been held:-

"(a) Eye-witnesses including the complainant
had failed to furnish a plausible and
acceptable explanation for being present on
the scene of occurrence and were chance
witnesses---Prosecution case did not inspire
confidence and fell for short of sounding
probable to a man of reasonable
prudence---Abscondence of accused in such
circumstances could not offer any useful
corroboration to the case of prosecution"

13. Abscondence alone cannot.be made the basis for
conviction on a capital charge when the other evidence of the

prosecution is doubtful. In this respect, cases reported as

Muhammad Sadiq Vs. State (2017 SCMR_ 144), Muhammad
Salim Vs. Muhammad Azam and another" (2011 SCMR-474)
and Rohtas Khan Vs. State’ (2010 SCMR_566) can also be

referred. Needless to say. that absconsion is a corroborative piece
of evidence and in cases where direct evidence fails,
corroborative piece of evidence is of no avail, as in the instant
case.

“14. ' After thoroughly evaluating the evidence available
on file, we feel no hesitation in concluding that the prosecution

has miserably failed to prove its case against accused/appellant

Meee (D.B)

16

beyond any reasonable doubt and the learned trial Court has not
appreciated the evidence in its true perspective and fell into error
by convicting the accused. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed,
the conviction and sentence of the appellant recorded by the
learned trial Court is set-aside and he is acquitted of the charge
by extending him the benefit of doubt, he shall be released
forthwith from jail, if not required to be detained in connection
with any other case. Murder reference No.07 -B/2019 is
answered in negative.

15. Above are the reasons of our.short order of the even

date.
