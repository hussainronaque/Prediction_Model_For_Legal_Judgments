Complainant by

MALIK SHAHZAD AHMAD KHAN J.:- By this judgment, I
proceed to decide Criminal appeal No. 36587 of 2019, titled ‘Rafaqat Ali Vs The
State’ filed by the appellant, namely, Rafagat Ali against his conviction and sentence
passed by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Daska District Sialkot vide judgment
dated 30.04.2019. The appellant, namely, Rafaqat Ali along with Muhammad Adeel
(co-convict tried separately being juvenile), Muhammad Ali & Sultan Bakhash (co-
accused since acquitted) was tried in case FIR No. 218 dated 09.06.2018 registered
at Police Station Satrah District Sialkot offences under Sections 302/147/149 of PPC
by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Daska District Sialkot and after conclusion of
the trial vide judgment dated 30.04.2019, the learned trial Court convicted and
sentenced the appellant as under:-

Under Section 302 (c) of PPC to undergo rigorous

imprisonment for ten (10) years for committing the
murder of Muhammad Adil deceased

Benefit of Section 382-B of Cr.P.C., was also extended in favour of the
appellant. The learned trial Court however, acquitted Muhammad Ali & Rana

Sultan Bakhash co-accused by extending them the benefit of doubt.

Cri. Appeal No. 36587 of 2019.

2. Brief facts of the case as given by the complainant Abdul Sattar (PW-10) in
his complaint (Ex.PB/1), on the basis of which the formal FIR (Ex.PB) was chalked
out, are that on the intervening night of 08/09 .06.2018 he (complainant) was sleeping
on the roof of his house. At about 01:00 a.m., (night) he suddenly woke up on hearing
the noise of quarrel. The complainant went from his roof to the roof of his neighbour
Rana Sultan Bakhsh (co-accused since acquitted) and in the light of electric bulb, he
saw that Rafagat (appellant), Muhammad Adeel (co-convict), Rana Muhammad Ali
(co-accused since acquitted), Rana Sultan Bakhsh alias Sabir (co-accused since
acquitted) and two unknown accused persons whom the complainant (PW-10) could
identify on coming before him, were beating his (complainant’s) son, namely,
Muhammad Adil deceased with ‘dandas’ and ‘sotas’ while he (Muhammad Adil
deceased) was lying on the ground. The complainant (PW-10) raised hue and cry to
save his son on which Muhammad Iqbal (given up PW) and Muhammad Bilal (PW-
11) reached at the spot. In the meanwhile, the accused persons kept on beating
Muhammad Adil deceased with ‘dandas’ and ‘sotas’. The complainant party rescued
Muhammad Adil deceased from the clutches of the accused persons. Accused
persons fled away from the spot while extending threats of dire consequences and
giving abused to the complainant party. They (complainant party) picked
Muhammad Adil deceased in injured condition and shifted him to the hospital for
medical treatment but he succumbed to the injuries on the way to the hospital.

The motive behind the occurrence was that a few days prior to the occurrence,
hot words were exchanged between Muhammad Adeel co-convict and Muhammad

Adil deceased.

3. After submission of report under Section 173 of Cr.P.C., and completion of
all the codal formalities, the learned trial Court framed charge against the appellant

& his co-accused on 15.10.2018, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

4. In order to prove its case, the prosecution produced twelve (12) witnesses
during the trial. Prosecution also produced documentary evidence as Exh.PA to
Exh.PN and closed its evidence. Statements of the appellant & his co-accused under
Section 342 of Cr.P.C were recorded by the learned trial Court wherein they refuted
the allegations levelled against them while stating that on the night of occurrence

Muhammad Adil deceased entered the house of accused party to commit rape with
3
Cri. Appeal No. 36587 of 2019.

the niece of the appellant, namely, Sana, whereupon, the accused party raised hue
and cry due to which people gathered at the spot and Muhammad Adil deceased was
tortured by the mob. The appellant or his co-accused however, neither made their
statements on oath as envisaged under Section 340 (2) of Cr.P.C., nor they produced
any witness in their defence.

5. The learned trial Court vide its judgment dated 30.04.2019 found the
appellant, namely, Rafaqat Ali guilty for the offence under Section 302 (c) of PPC
and convicted and sentenced him as mentioned and detailed above. The learned trial
Court however, vide the same judgment acquitted Muhammad Ali and Sultan
Bakhash co-accused while extending them the benefit of the doubt. Muhammad
Adeel co-accused was separately tried being juvenile and he was convicted &
sentenced for offence under Section 302(c) of PPC vide the judgment of even date
i.e., 30.04.2019 passed by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Daska District Sialkot.
6. It is contended by learned counsel for the appellant that the appellant is
absolutely innocent and he has falsely been implicated in this case by the
complainant being in league with the local police; that there is delay of more than
six (06) hours in lodging the FIR which has created doubt in the prosecution story;
that the occurrence was unseen and the prosecution eye witnesses are chance
witnesses; that there is conflict between the ocular account and the medical evidence
of the prosecution as the prosecution eye witnesses failed to explain injuries Nos. 8
to 11, which were burn marks of electric shocks, noted by the Medical Officer during
postmortem examination on the dead body of Muhammad Adil deceased; that the
prosecution has also failed to prove the motive part of the occurrence; that nothing
has been recovered from the appellant and the alleged recovery of ‘danda’ has been
planted against the appellant; that co-accused of the appellant, namely, Muhammad.
Ali and Sultan Bakhash having the similar role have been acquitted by the learned
trial Court and appeal against their acquittal has also been dismissed by this Court
vide order dated 07.12.2022 therefore, the appellant cannot be convicted &
sentenced on the basis of same prosecution evidence which is lacking independent
corroboration; that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case against the
appellant beyond the shadow of doubt therefore, his appeal may be accepted and he

may be acquitted of the charge by extending him the benefit of doubt.
4
Cri. Appeal No. 36587 of 2019.

7. On the other hand, it is contended by learned Deputy Prosecutor General for
the State assisted by learned counsel for the complainant that FIR in this case was
promptly lodged which rules out the possibility of any fabrication or concoction;
that the appellant was specifically named in the FIR with the role that he along with
his co-accused while armed with ‘dandas’ caused injuries on the body of
Muhammad Adil deceased and the role attributed to the appellant by the prosecution
eye witnesses is fully supported by the medical evidence; that the prosecution case
against the appellant is further corroborated by the recovery of ‘danda’ (P-1) on his
pointation; that acquittal of co-accused is of no avail to the appellant because Sultan
Bakhash co-accused was declared innocent by the police, whereas, Muhammad Ali
co-accused was not resident of the place of occurrence hence, case of acquitted co-
accused is distinguishable from the case of the appellant; that the motive was also
proved by the prosecution through reliable evidence of prosecution witnesses; that

there is no substance in the appeal filed by the appellant hence, the same may be

dismissed.
8. Arguments heard. Record Perused.
9. According to the prosecution’s own case, the occurrence in this case took

place in the house of the appellant at 01:00 a.m., on the intervening night of
08/09.06.2018 but the FIR was lodged on 09.06.2018 at 07:15 a.m., and as such,
there is delay of 06 hours and 15 minutes in lodging the FIR. The distance between
the police station and the place of occurrence was 5-kilometers. Abdul Sattar
complainant (PW-10) has also stated during his cross-examination that he had the
facility of car at his disposal on the night of occurrence through which he shifted
Muhammad Adil deceased from the place of occurrence to the hospital. Relevant
part of his statement in this respect reads as under:-

“I and my son Tahir took the deceased in injured condition in a car

to hospital, situated at Satrah.”

Under the circumstances, the abovementioned gross delay in reporting the matter
to the police has created doubt regarding the truthfulness of the prosecution story. I
am therefore, of the view that the FIR was not promptly lodged in this case therefore,
possibility of deliberations and concoctions in the prosecution story cannot be ruled
out in this case. Reliance in this respect may be placed on the cases reported as

‘Akhtar Ali and others Vs The State’ (2008 SCMR 6), ‘Nazeer Ahmad Vs Gehne

5
Cri. Appeal No. 36587 of 2019.

Khan and others’ (2011 SCMR 1473) & ‘Mehmood Ahmad and three others Vs The
Sate and another’ (1995 SCMR 127).

10. It is further noteworthy that postmortem examination on the dead body of
Muhammad Adil deceased was conducted on 09.06.2018 at 11:40 a.m., i.e., with the
delay of 10 hours and 40 minutes from the occurrence. The said delay is also
suggestive of the fact that the prosecution eye witnesses were not present at the spot
at the relevant time and the abovementioned delay was consumed in procuring the
attendance of fake eye witnesses. In the case of ‘Muhammad Ilyas Vs Muhammad

Abid alias Billa and others’ (2017 SCMR 54), the Apex Court of the country was

pleased to observe that delay of 09 hours in conducting the postmortem examination
suggests that prosecution eye witnesses were not present at the spot at the time of
occurrence therefore, the said delay was used in procuring the attendance of fake eye
witnesses. Relevant part of the judgment at page No. 55 reads as under:-

2. este eeere essere ee Post-mortem examination of the dead body
of Muhammad Shahbaz deceased had been conducted after nine
hours of the incident which again was a factor pointing towards a
possibility that time had been consumed by the local police and the
complainant party in procuring and planting eye-witnesses and
cooking up a story for the prosecution.

Similar view was taken by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case

of ‘Zafar Vs The State and others’ (2018 SCMR 326).

11. Ocular account of the prosecution was furnished by Abdul Sattar complainant
(PW-10) and Muhammad Bilal (PW-11). It was the case of the prosecution that on
the night of occurrence, the complainant on hearing the noise of hue and cry, woke
up and went to the roof of Rana Sultan Bakhash (co-accused since acquitted) who
was his neighbour, wherefrom, he witnessed the occurrence but during his cross-
examination, he (complainant) stated that his house was not situated in the street in
which the house of the accused persons was situated. He further stated that if one
has to go from his house to the house of the accused persons then he had to enter his
street and then to the street of the accused persons. Relevant parts of his statement
in this respect read as under:-

“My house is not situated in the street in which house of accused
persons is situated........0.0.00.. It is correct that my house is not
adjacent to the house of the accused persons. If one wants to go from
my house to the house of accused persons, he has to enter in my

street and then towards the street of the accused persons. The
6
Cri. Appeal No. 36587 of 2019.

distance between the door of my house and that of house of accused
persons is 30/35 feet. If one wants to go from my house to that of the
house of accused persons, he has to cross two houses and two

Havelis of other persons before entering the house of accused

,

persons.’

The story narrated by the complainant during his cross-examination has
negated the story narrated by him in the FIR.
12. It is further noteworthy that conduct of the prosecution eye witnesses in this
case is highly unnatural. According to the prosecution case, the complainant party
was comprising of three (03) adult male members, namely, Abdul Sattar
complainant (PW-10), Muhammad Bilal (PW-11) and Iqbal (given up PW). Abdul
Sattar complainant (PW-10) is real father of Muhammad Adil deceased. He also
stated during his cross-examination that Muhammad Bilal (PW- 11) was his paternal
cousin. It was the case of the prosecution that the appellant and his co-accused were
armed with ‘dandas’ at the time of occurrence and as such, the accused persons were
not armed with any formidable weapon like gun, pistol etc but the abovementioned
witnesses kept on standing like silent spectators and allowed the appellant and his
co-accused to inflict, as many as, 17 injuries on the body of Muhammad Adil
deceased. They did not try to rescue Muhammad Adil deceased from the appellant
and his co-accused during the occurrence or to apprehend them at the spot, after the
occurrence. The abovementioned conduct of the prosecution eye witnesses is highly
unnatural which further shows that they were not present at the spot at the relevant

time. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of ‘Liaquat Ali Vs. The

State’ (2008 SCMR 95) at Para No.7, observed regarding conduct of the witnesses
of ocular account as under:-

“2. The prosecution story briefly stated is that on the fateful day at
about 8.00 a.m. complainant Shameer (P.W.7) was going to the
“Lumberdar” (Revenue Officer) to pay “Abyana” and at that time his
cousin namely Fazil deceased was going ahead of him at some
distance. Suddenly within his view Liaquat Ali appellant armed with a
knife appeared and raised a Lalkara that Fazil would not be spared
and thereafter gave him successive knife blows on various parts of his
body. On hue and cries raised, Muhammad Siddique (P.W.8), Ranjha
and Musa (not produced) were attracted to the spot. They tried to
rescue Fazil but on being threatened by Liaquat they were unable to
protect Fazil deceased and within their view he succumbed to the
Injuries and died... cece cee cee ene cee cee cee cee aee cee eee eee ce eee eae eeeaee eee

Cri. Appeal No. 36587 of 2019.

5-A. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and having gone
through the evidence on record, we note that although P.W.7 who is
first cousin and brother-in-law of Fazil deceased claims to have seen
the occurrence from a distance of 30 ft. (as given in cross-examination)
and two other witnesses namely Musa and Ranjha were also attracted
to the spot but none rescued Fazil deceased and appellant had a free
hand to inflict as many as 9 injuries on his person. The explanation
given by these witnesses that since Liaquat Ali had threatened them,
therefore, they could not go near Fazil deceased to rescue him is
repellant to common sense as Liaqat Ali was not armed with a fire-
arm which could have scared the witnesses away. He was a single
alleged assailant and if the witnesses were there at the spot they could
have easily overpowered him. This makes their presence at the spot

Likewise, in the case of ‘Pathan Vs. The State’ (2015 SCMR 315) at Para

No.4, the Apex Court of the country was pleased to observe as under:-

“

. ..The appellant was armed only with scissors not a
formidable weapon of destruction. The complainant is the son of the
deceased while Baradi and the other PW Muhammad Yousaf are also
related to the deceased. The causing of such large number of injuries
one after another to the deceased with scissors must have consumed
reasonable time due to the pause in between the first injury and the last
one but all the three PWs including the son with a strong stature and
built remained as silent spectators. They did not react or showed any
response when the accused was causing the injuries. No man on the
earth would believe that a close relative would remain silent spectator
in a situation like this because their intervention was very natural to
rescue the deceased but they did nothing nor attempted to chase the
accused and apprehend him at the spot.”

Similar view was taken in the case of ‘Zafar Vs. The State and others’ (2018
SCMR 326).

13. It is also noteworthy that there is conflict between ocular account and the
medical evidence of the prosecution. Dr. Kamran Malik (PW-8) conducted
postmortem examination on the dead body of Muhammad Adil deceased and found
17 injuries on his body. According to his evidence, injuries No. 8 to 11 were the
marks of burns and electric shocks. Injury No. 11 was burn scars total 5 in number
which means that there were, as many as, nine (09) burn scars and electric shock
marks on the body of Muhammad Adil deceased but none of the prosecution eye
witnesses stated in his evidence that as to how the abovementioned injuries were
received by Muhammad Adil deceased. Had the prosecution witnesses been present
at the spot at the relevant time then they should have explained the abovementioned.

injuries on the body of the deceased. I have further noted that no electric wire or any
8
Cri. Appeal No. 36587 of 2019.

other weapon which can cause burn marks or electric shock marks, has been

,

recovered from the possession of the appellant. In the case of ‘Irfan Ali Vs The State

(2015 SCMR 840), the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a similar situation
observed in paragraph No. 11 at Page No. 844 as under:-

“11. The most striking feature of the case is that in the FIR complete
photographic narration of the entire tragedy has been given so much so,
Muhammad Khan acquitted accused and the appellant were attributed
causing specific injuries with the fire shots of 30-bore pistols at the deceased.
With such degree of accuracy each and every detail of the incident was given
however, it was not due to mental disorientation that the dagger blows
inflicted on the deceased found during the autopsy on the dead body, could
not be noticed by the complainant. This doubt of reasonable nature and
substance would strongly suggest that the complainant and the other eye-
witnesses were not present at the spot, therefore, lodging the report after
more than 3 hours and spending 1-1/2 hour at the spot with the dead body,
no room was left for this glaring omission. This omission is very fatal to the

,

prosecution case and it is established that crime was an unwitnessed one.’

Likewise in the case of ‘Usman alias Kaloo Vs The State’ (2017 SCMR 622),

while reiterating the abovementioned principle of appreciation of evidence in
criminal cases, the august Supreme Court of Pakistan extended the benefit of doubt
of the accused of the said case, inter-alia, on the ground that the eye witnesses could
not mention in their statements the exact number of injuries sustained by the
deceased during the occurrence. Relevant part of the abovementioned judgment at
page No. 625 reads as under:-

"Be seccee Some of the above mentioned eye-witnesses had maintained that
the deceased had received only one injury at the hands of the appellant but

the Postmortem Examination Report shows that the deceased had received

”

as many as 8 injuries on different parts of his body......

It is further noteworthy that Dr. Kamran Malik (PW-8) has neither mentioned
the probable time that elapsed between the injuries and death, as well as, probable
time that elapsed between death and postmortem examination in the postmortem
report (Exh.PH) nor he mentioned the abovementioned details in his evidence
recorded by the learned trial Court. He frankly conceded during his cross-
examination that he normally mentions the duration between the injuries and death
and between death and postmortem examination in the postmortem reports. Under

the circumstances, it is not determinable in this case that what was the probable time
9
Cri. Appeal No. 36587 of 2019.

of occurrence when Muhammad Adil deceased received injuries on his body. Under
all the abovementioned circumstances, I have come to this conclusion that the ocular
account of the prosecution is not supported by the medical evidence.

14. Motive behind the occurrence was that few days earlier to the occurrence, hot
words were exchanged between Muhammad Adil deceased and Muhammad Adeel
co-convict. No specific date, time and place of the motive occurrence has been
brought on the record by any of the prosecution witnesses. No reason of the earlier
quarrel which took place between Muhammad Adil deceased and Muhammad Adeel
co-convict has been stated by any of the prosecution witnesses. A vague motive was
alleged by the prosecution which has not been proved in this case and the learned
trial Court has rightly disbelieved the motive part of the prosecution case in the
impugned judgment. Moreover, the prosecution story of motive does not appeal to a
prudent mind because if there was any earlier quarrel between the deceased and
Muhammad Adeel co-convict, then what was deceased doing in the house of accused
persons at the odd hours of night (01:00 a.m.). The prosecution evidence in this
respect is completely silent, which makes the prosecution story further doubtful.
15. Insofar as the recovery of ‘danda’ (P-1) on the pointation of the appellant is
concerned, it is noteworthy that as per prosecution case, the aforementioned ‘danda’
(P-1) was recovered after the joint disclosure of the appellant along with his co-
convict, namely, Muhammad Adeel and Muhammad Ali (co-accused since
acquitted) and as such, the said recovery becomes doubtful in the eye of law. It is
further noteworthy that the aforementioned ‘danda’ (P-1) was not stained with blood
and as such, there is nothing on record to connect the said recovery with the
occurrence. Moreover, the recovered ‘danda’ (P-1) is of common pattern and is
available in the markets easily and as such, the same can be planted against the
appellant. Under the circumstances, it is not safe to rely upon the aforementioned
recovery of ‘danda’ (P-1) against the appellant and the said recovery was rightly

disbelieved by the learned trial Court.

16. It is further noteworthy that Rafaqat Ali appellant along with Muhammad Ali
and Rana Sultan Bakhash (co-accused since acquitted) was assigned the joint role of
inflicting “danda’ blows on the body of Muhammad Adil deceased by the
prosecution eye witnesses. Abovementioned Muhammad Ali and Rana Sultan

Bakhash co-accused have been acquitted by the learned trial Court vide impugned
10
Cri. Appeal No. 36587 of 2019.

judgment dated 30.04.2019, whereas, Crl. Appeal No. 36580 of 2019 filed against
the acquittal of the said co-accused has already been dismissed as having been
withdrawn after arguing the same at length, by this Court vide order dated
07.12.2022. Although learned counsel for the complainant has tried to distinguish
the case of the appellant from the case of Rana Sultan Bakhash @ Sabir co-accused
since acquitted on the ground that the abovementioned acquitted co-accused was
declared innocent by police, whereas, the appellant was found guilty by the
Investigating Officer but it is by now well settled that the police opinion becomes
irrelevant after recording of prosecution evidence by the learned trial Court, as
observed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of ‘Muhammad
Ahmad (Mahmood Ahmed) and another Vs The State’ (2010 SCMR 660), therefore,

the case of the appellant cannot be distinguished from the case of acquitted co-
accused merely on the basis of police opinion. Under the circumstances, the
prosecution evidence which has been disbelieved against the abovementioned co-
accused cannot be believed against the appellant without independent corroboration
which is very much lacking in this case. Reliance in this respect may be placed on
the cases of ‘Akhtar Ali and others Vs The State’ (2008 SCMR 6), ‘Muhammad Ali
Vs The State’ (2015 SCMR 137), ‘Muhammad Akram Vs The State’ (2012 SCMR
440) & ‘Ulfat Hussain Vs The State’ (2018 SCMR 313).

17. Learned Deputy Prosecutor General assisted by learned counsel for the
complainant has next argued that the appellant has admitted in his statement
recorded under Section 342 of Cr.P.C., as well as, in the suggestions given to the
prosecution eye witnesses that the occurrence took place in his house where
Muhammad Adil deceased was done to death by a mob but the appellant did not
produce any defence evidence in support of his claim and as such, he admitted the
occurrence therefore, he was rightly convicted & sentenced by the learned trial
Court. There is no substance in the abovementioned argument of learned Deputy
Prosecutor General assisted by learned counsel for the complainant because the
appellant has nowhere admitted in his abovementioned statement or in the
suggestions given to the prosecution eye witnesses that he committed the murder of
Muhammad Adil deceased rather he stated that on the night of occurrence when

Muhammad Adil deceased entered his house to commit the rape of sister of
11
Cri. Appeal No. 36587 of 2019.

Muhammad Adeel co-convict, namely, Sana Tabassum, they (appellant and his co-
accused) raised hue and cry, whereupon, a mob gathered at the spot and gave beating
to Muhammad Adil deceased. It is therefore, evidence that the appellant did not
admit that he gave beating to Muhammad Adil deceased on the night of occurrence.
It is by now well settled that it is first and foremost duty of the prosecution to prove
its case and if the prosecution fails to prove its case then statement of an accused is
to be accepted or rejected in toto. It is legally not permissible to accept inculpatory
part of the statement of an accused and to reject exculpatory part of the said
statement. Reference in this context may be made to the case of ‘Muhammad Asghar

Vs. The State’ (PLD 2008 Supreme Court 513). The relevant paragraph of the said

judgment at page 520 is reproduced hereunder for ready reference:-

‘Tt is settled law by now that a statement of an accused recorded
under section 342, of Cr.P.C. is to be read in its entirety, is to be
accepted or rejected as a whole and reliance should not be placed
on that portion of the statement which goes against the accused
person. Reference can be made to the case of ‘Shabbir Ahmad v.
The State’ PLD 1995 SC 343 and ‘The State v. Muhammad Hanif
and 5 others’ 1992 SCMR 2047. It has been held by this Court in
the judgment reported as ‘Wagar Ahmad v. Shaukat Ali and others’
2006 SCMR 1139, that prosecution is bound to establish its own

case independently instead of depending upon the weakness of the

defence, and the assertion of the accused in his statement under
section 342, of Cr.P.C. was not sufficient to establish the
prosecution case regarding guilt of the accused and such statement
of the accused could be accepted in toto in the absence of any other
prosecution evidence. In the case in hand, the High Court should
have either accepted appellant’s statement in its entirety or rejected
it altogether, but it had misdirected itself while choosing a portion
of the statement, which went against the appellant, and convicting

him.’

If after rejection of the prosecution evidence, abovementioned statement of
the appellant is accepted in toto then no offence is made out against the appellant. It
is also noteworthy that Muhammad Ali and Rana Sultan Bakhash @ Sabir (co-
accused since acquitted) also made statements on the same lines as that of the

statement of Rafaqat Ali appellant has been recorded under Section 342 of Cr.P.C.,

and their defence counsel also gave the same suggestions to the prosecution eye
12
Cri. Appeal No. 36587 of 2019.

witnesses but the abovementioned co-accused, namely, Muhammad Ali and Rana
Sultan Bakhash @ Sabir have been acquitted by the learned trial Court and appeal
against their acquittal has already been dismissed by this Court vide order dated
07.12.2022 therefore, the appellant cannot be convicted & sentenced merely on the
basis of his abovementioned statement or suggestions given by his counsel to the
PWs.

18. Ihave considered all the aspects of this case and have come to this irresistible
conclusion that the prosecution could not prove its case against the appellant beyond
the shadow of doubt. It is by now well settled law that if there is a single
circumstance which creates doubt regarding the prosecution case, the same is
sufficient to give benefit of doubt to the accused, whereas, the instant case is replete
with number of circumstances which have created serious doubts regarding the

truthfulness of the prosecution story. In ‘Tariq Pervez Vs The State’ (1995 SCMR

1345), the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, at page 1347, was pleased to observe
as under:-

Seeeeae The concept of benefit of doubt to an accused person is deep-
rooted in our country. For giving him benefit of doubt, it is not
necessary that there should be many circumstances creating doubts.
If there is a circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a prudent
mind about the guilt of the accused, then the accused will be entitled
to the benefit not as a matter of grace and concession but as a matter
of right.’

The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan while reiterating the same principle

in the case of ‘Muhammad Akram Vs The State’ (2009 SCMR 230), at page 236,

observed as under:-

“3... It is an axiomatic principle of law that in case of doubt, the
benefit thereof must accrue in favour of the accused as matter of right
and not of grace. It was observed by this Court in the case of Tariq
Pervez v. The State 1995 SCMR 1345 that for giving the benefit of
doubt, it was not necessary that there should be many circumstances
creating doubts. If there is circumstance which created reasonable
doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then the
accused would be entitled to the benefit of doubt not as a matter of
grace and concession but as a matter of right.”

19. In the light of above discussion, the instant appeal (Criminal Appeal No.
36587 of 2019) filed by Rafaqat Ali appellant is allowed, his conviction and

sentence recorded by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Daska District Sialkot vide
13
Cri. Appeal No. 36587 of 2019.

impugned judgment dated 30.04.2019 is hereby set-aside and he is acquitted of the
charge by extending him the benefit of doubt. He is in custody. He be released

forthwith if not required to be detained in any other case.
