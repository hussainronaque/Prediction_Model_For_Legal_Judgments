2. The Prosecution story as narrated in the FIR
(Ex.PF/A) chalked-out on the complaint (Ex.PF) of the
complainant-Muhammad Yaseen (PW-8) is detailed in Paragraph
No.1 of the impugned judgment, which is reproduced as under in
verbatim: -

“Briefly sated facts necessary to be dilated upon for
culminating the fate of this as per complaint Exh.PF
are that on 19.07.2015 on Sunday, complainant
alongwith his brother Intizar Hussain, Amanat Ali &
Farooq Ahmed, (sons of Bashir Ahmed), Nazir &
Qurban (sons of Haider), Rani Bibi and Shehnaz Bibi
came at Jaguwala Chak No.4 in order to attend
“Punchayat” because wife of complainant’s brother
Intizar Hussain, after quarrelling had come in the
house of her parents at Jaguwala Chak No4. A
“Punchayat” was convened at the Dera of Sharif
Lumberdar in this regard. The respectable of said
“Punchayat” decided that Shazia Bibi will be sent with
Intizar Hussain after 3/4 days and also demanded
Rs.13,000/- as expenditures which were paid by the
complainant on the spot and were returning back
towards Kangan Pur on Carry “Dabba”. When they
reached Meer Kot Canal near Chunian then Shazia
Bibi on the asking of his brother Shehzad made a
phone call to the brother of complainant namely Intizar
Hussain by saying that her parents have agreed to send
her with him today and asked them to come back to
took her alongwith children with them. On which, they
again reached at the “Dera” of said Muhammad Sharif.
Said Muhammad Sharif and his son Sarfraz also went
with them in the house of in-laws of the brother of
complainant. The wife of brother of complainant
namely Shazia Bibi alongwith children were sent with

them with their consent in carry “Dabba”. At about
06:30 p.m. when complainant party reached at a
distance of 50/60 feet from the house of accused
persons then suddenly accused persons namely
Shehzad, Imran, Shoban, Hanif, Ramzan, Rizwan,
Ibraheem and Naveed alongwith four unknown
accused persons armed with their respective weapons
“Churras”, “Sotas” and “Dandas” emerged from the
sugarcane crop in front of the Carry “Dabba”. An
unknown accused to whom they can identify raised
Lalkara to the effect that Intizar Hussain and the
members of “Punchayat” who had come with him
would not be left alive. On which, all the said accused
persons de-boarded the complainant party from Carry
“Dabba” and grappled with them and the accused
persons after dragging the complainant’s brother took
him in sugarcane crop, two unknown accused persons
caught hold the legs of the brother of complainant
brother and an unknown accused caught hold him from
his head and got him lying on the ground. Accused
Imran made a blow with his ‘Churra’ and cut the throat
of the brother of complainant, accused Shehzad made
a ‘Churra’ blow which hit underneath the right armpit
of the brother of complainant, accused Shoban made a
“Churra” blow which hit on the right flank of brother
of complainant, accused Hanif made a ‘Churra” blow
on the forehead of the brother of complainant, accused

side of the belly of the brother of complainant, accused

holding Shazia Bibi from her hair made a ‘Churra’
blow which hit in front of her chest between the
breasts. Accused Hanif threw down Shazia Bibi on the
ground by saying that our honour has been at stake due
to her act and made ‘Churra’ blows which hit on her
right breast and right armpit. Whereas remaining
accused persons and unknown accused persons started

The motive behind the occurrence was that the
brother of the complainant had contracted love
marriage six years prior of the occurrence due to
which accused party had grudge against the
complainant party and committed this occurrence.”.
3. All the accused/appellants, on commencement of trial,
when formally charged pleaded innocence and claimed trial.
Thirteen prosecution witnesses were produced to prove the guilt of
the accused. Dr. Sadia Ashraf WMO (PW-3) and Dr. Dildar
Mehboob (PW-4) provided medical evidence; Shabbir Hussain, S I.
(PW-12) and Muhammad Iqbal, SJ. (PW-13) conducted
investigation of this case, whereas Muhammad Yaseen,
complainant (PW-8), Shehnaz Bibi, (PW-9), Nazir Ahmed, (PW-
10) furnished the ocular account. Muhammad Nawaz (PW-11) is
the recovery witness of “Churras”. Additionally, CW-1 Tayyab
Mehmood, Record Keeper of THQ Hospital, Pattoki, also was
examined to produce the record of mortuary pertaining to the year
2015.

Given-up PWs were namely Amanat Ali son of Bashir
Ahmed, Rani Bib wife of Qurban and Sardar Muhammad Yaseen
son of Dais Muhammad being unnecessary, and further, PW
namely Shazia Bibi widow of Intizar Hussain was given-up as won
over being related to the accused party reflecting from the
statement of learned ADPP. The learned DDPP by tendering

documentary evidence, report of PFSA (Ex.PT & Ex.PU), closed

the prosecution evidence.

4. Upon the completion of the prosecution’s evidence,
the accused while recording their statements u/s 342, Cr.P.C.
controverted the prosecution’s allegations, however, despite
consent failed to produce any evidence or appeared themselves u/s
340(2), Cr.P.C. to refute the prosecution’s story and on culmination
of trial proceedings recorded the conviction and_ sentence,
mentioned in detail in paragraph one of this judgment.

5. The learned counsel representing the appellants in all
three appeals, filed against their conviction and sentence, contended
that while passing the impugned judgment the learned trial Court
has not taken into consideration that the prosecution’s story is a
result of manipulations and consultation as admitted by the injured
eye-witness namely Shehnaz Bibi while appearing as PW-9 that the
complainant-Muhammad Yaseen (PW-8) moved application
(Exh.PF) after consultation with all of them. It is further contended
that six hours delay in the registration of FIR whereas distance from
place of occurrence to Police Station was 05-Km, was also
established from record; that the learned trial Court also overlooked
the delay of 20-hours in conducting postmortem of deceased-Intizar
Hussain, which facilitated/extended an opportunity to the
complainant to lodge a false case against the appellants, as it was a
blind murder, thus, the possibility of fabrication on the part of the

complainant cannot be ignored; that the learned trial Court

proceeded to convict and sentence the appellants while relying on
Criminal Appeal No.54462/2019. 7
Criminal Appeal No.54463/2019.

Criminal Appeal No.56789/2019.

Criminal Appeal No.54461/2019.

the statements of PW-8, PW-9 & PW-10, who were closely related
to the deceased being real brothers and sister-in-law (Bhabi),
respectively, and their testimony could not be relied upon until and
unless the same was supported by the other relevant factors; that the
learned trial Court has brushed aside the defence plea that the
appellants were not present at the spot and they were involved
falsely merely on the basis of suspicion and hearsay evidence as
they knew nothing about this blind murder; that the medical
evidence contradicts the ocular version of the prosecution case; that
the prosecution miserably failed to prove the factum of guilt against
the appellants for the main reason that no independent witness was
produced, in particular, Sharif Lumberdar and his son Sarfraz,
therefore, the prosecution failed to prove the motive as well as
occurrence; that the impugned judgment is the result of misreading
and non-reading of material pieces of evidence inasmuch as
material contradictions amongst the statements of the prosecution
witnesses have been ignored; that the co-accused of the appellants
namely Muhammad Shoban and Muhammad Ibraheem with
specific role of inflicting Churra blows, in investigation, were
found innocent, consequence whereof, challan/report u/s 173,
Cr.P.C was submitted showing their names in column No.2, who
although faced trial because of summoning them by the learned

trial Court on application/complaint, yet they along with

Muhammad Hanif and Muhammad Ramzan, who were also shown

to have given Churra blows, were acquitted of the charge on the
basis of the same set of evidence, in such eventuality, appellants’
conviction is not justified, hence, claimed acquittal by setting-aside
the impugned judgment.

6. On the other hand, the learned counsels for the
appellant/complainant in appeal challenging acquittal of
respondents No.2 to 5 and revision petition seeking an
enhancement of the sentence of the respondents No.2 to 4
(appellants in Crl. Appeal No.54462/2019), assisted by the learned
Deputy Prosecutor General, supported the impugned judgment and
contended that the prosecution proved its case including motive
against the appellants beyond any shadow of doubt; that the FIR
was registered with promptitude and the said fact rules-out any
possibility of consultation as alleged by the appellants; that the
medical evidence is completely in line with the ocular account
furnished by PW-8, PW-9 & PW-10; that the learned trial Court
convicted and sentenced the appellants on the basis of confidence
inspiring evidence produced by the prosecution witnesses, who
were subjected to lengthy cross-examination but they remained
consistent/firm and deposed in line with the version of the
prosecution without pointing-out anything contrary to the story in
FIR as well as the report under Section 173, Cr.P.C.; that there is

nothing on record to even prima facie suggest that aforesaid PWs

were behaving under malice; that the PWs had no previous enmity

Criminal Appeal No.54461/2019.

Murder Reference No.288/2019.
to falsely depose against the appellant and keeping in view the
number of injuries the other enemies could also be involved if the
complainant party had any intention to falsely implicate the
innocent persons as well and; that the prosecution evidence cannot
be shattered for the reason that the PWs furnishing ocular account
were Closely related with the deceased; hence the three appeals may
be dismissed and the sentence recorded by the learned trial court
may be maintained. Lastly, the learned counsels prayed for
enhancement of sentence of respondents No.2 to 4 while accepting
Crl. Revision No.56788/2019 and, in consequence whereof, Crl.
Appeal No.54461/2019 filed against acquittal of respondents No.2
to 5 therein, may be accepted and they be punished accordingly.
7. We have heard the learned counsels for the parties as
well as the learned Deputy Prosecutor General and perused the
record in the light of respective contentions of the parties.
8. The developed jurisprudence in criminal side demands
construction of a case by the prosecution upon four pillars of
evidence, which consist of:

(i) ocular account;

(ii) motive;

(iii) medical; and

(iv) recovery

and to establish the guilt of the accused production of substantive

piece of evidence in all its disciplines is necessary, and the lack

thereof always damages the prosecution’s case in securing
conviction. The ocular evidence as we have inferred from reading
of plethora of judgments of this Court as well as honourable
Supreme Court is the most important/significant pillar of the
prosecution’s case, which shall be proved without any shadow of
doubt because its trustworthiness/accuracy/purity/credibility and it
being confidence inspiring, is enough to award conviction. Reliance
is placed on “Muhammad Anwar v. The State” (1997 P.Cr.LJ.
321), “Imtiaz alias Taji and another v. The State and others” (2020
SCMR 287), “Muhammad Mansha v. The State’ (2018 SCMR
772), “Muhammad Arshad v. The State” (2020 SCMR 2025) and
“Zahid v. The State” (2022 SCMR 50). The relevant portions from
the said pronouncements laying down the principles of ocular

account are reproduced hereunder for facility of reference:-

“1997 P.Cr.L.J. 321, supra,

The touchstone in assessing and evaluating the
evidence of eye-witnesses two important factors should
be seriously taken into consideration i.e. (1) Whether
in the circumstances of the case it was possible for the
eye-witnesses to be present at the scene or their
explanation for their presence at the place of
occurrence could be accepted and (2) whether there
was anything inherently improbable or unreliable in
their evidence. The ocular evidence would carry
convincing weight and create unswerving confidence,
which was corroborated by the medical evidence and
the motive relating to the occurrence. Such type of
evidence is further strengthened if the F.I.R. was
promptly lodged without giving any time for
fabrication or inventing totally false story. It is true
that there is no inflexible role that the statement of an
interested or an inimical witness can never be
accepted without corroboration. It is also true that

interest and truth some times are so intermingled that
those might go together and corroborated, therefore,
is not always to be considered as a sine qua non for
the acceptance of the evidence of such interested
witnesses. The creditable value is to be attached even
to such witnesses if their evidence is found free from
doubt, infirmity or the possibility of the implication of
wrong persons is excluded. Rule of prudence in such
circumstances requires to find out whether a witness
had seen the occurrence, could identify the culprits
and was reliable enough to be believed without
corroboration. It is also well-understood that the
evidence of an interested witness was not like the
evidence of an approver, which would need
corroboration and abundant caution before its
acceptance. The rule of caution cannot be confined to
a water-tight compartment nor it can be kept in a
straightjacket. In nutshell every case is to be evaluated
and considered on its own merits because in human
affairs, the facts and circumstances differ from place
to place and mostly from time to time.

2020 SCMR 287, supra,

The ocular account in this case was furnished by
Tariq Ejaz (PW-10) and Meer Tahir (PW-11). Tariq
Ejaz (PW-10) is the complainant of the case and is
the real son of deceased Ejaz Ahmad. He has given
sufficient explanation for his presence at the spot at
the relevant time.

2018 SCMR 772, supra,

Once the Court comes to the conclusion that the eye-
witnesses had made dishonest improvements in their
statements then it is not safe to place reliance on their
statements. It is also settled by this Court that when
ever a witness made dishonest improvement in his
version in order to bring his case in line with the
medical evidence or in order to strengthen the
prosecution case then his testimony is not worthy of
credence. The witnesses in this case have also made
dishonest improvement in order to bring the case in
line with the medical evidence (as observed by the
learned High Court), in that eventuality conviction
was not sustainable on the testimony of the said
witnesses.

2020 SCMR 2025, supra,

The ocular account in this case is supported by 02
injured PWs, the statements of the prosecution
witnesses coincide with each other on salient
features of prosecution version. The ocular account
is corroborated by the medical evidence, recovery of
hatchet further lends support to the prosecution case
and during the course of investigation, the petitioner
was found involved and his name was placed in
column No.03 of the report under section 173,
Cr.P.C.

2022 SCMR 50, supra,

The whole prosecution case qua ocular account
hinges upon the testimonies of these two witnesses.
Amongst these two witnesses Mst. Shahida Bibi
happens to be the victim of the occurrence. While
making her statement in Court, she has narrated the
whole occurrence in a very mature and natural
manner touching the contents of the crime report on
all aspects without any disconnection.

We have examined the evidence of the prosecution in

terms of established principles of criminal jurisprudence and do not

find the prosecution witnesses’ testimony credible, free of doubt,

infirmity and exclusion of possibility of implication of wrong

persons for the following reasons:--

i)

ii)

All the three eye witnesses (PW-8, PW-9 & PW-10)
were categorical/unanimous about returning of Mst.
Shazia Bibi to her parents’ home along with her three
children and obviously spent considerable time with

them in peaceful manner.

They were also consistent about sending/permitting of
Mst. Shazia Bibi to go with her husband (deceased)
and their three children by the accused party (brothers

of Shazia Bibi) without creating any hindrance.

iii)

v)

vi)

vii)

viii)

PWs/witnesses did not claim absence of the accused
persons at the time of departure of Mst. Shazia Bibi

along with her children from her parents’ house.

Testimony of all the PWs is silent about happening of
any unpleasant act/action at the time of departure of

Mst. Shazia Bibi along with her husband (deceased).

The silence of PWs’ testimony confirms the presence
of the accused persons/appellants at the time of
departure of Mst. Shazia Bibi with her husband from
her parents’ house on carry-dabba, how the accused
persons could reach at the place of occurrence before
them (complainant party) which was admittedly 50/60

feet away from the house of the accused party.

Neither any other vehicle was recovered from the
place of occurrence nor its availability was alleged,
therefore, the story articulated in the FIR does not
appeal to be plausible and inherently improbable-

unreliable, hence, creates doubt about its reality.

Allegedly, all the three witnesses had attended the
convened Punchayat but did not utter a single word
either about any vengeful attitude of the accused party

or nurturing of motive, in the Punchayat proceedings.

It does not appeal to an ordinary man of prudence that
if real brother of two young/strong men/witnesses was
being slaughtered/attacked with Chhuras and they did
not jump/make any effort to rescue him as none of the
witnesses sustain any injury which is enough to

hold/infer that either they were not present and the

story was concocted after recovery of the dead-body or

it was the height of callousness on their behalf.

It is quite strange and astonishing that none of
witnesses made any effort even after occurrence to
take/shift promptly the injured persons whatever
condition may be to Hospital despite having, as

alleged, their own vehicle (Carry-Daba).

Admission of PW-10 in cross-examination about his

reaching at the spot after police is very significant.

PW-4 Dr. Dildar Mehmood, Medical Officer,
categorically admitted in his testimony about
conducting of post-mortem at about 3:10 PM on
20.07.2015 although dead-body was received on
19.07.2015 at 10:30 PM because the police provided

the complete documents (FIR and other police
documents) necessary to conduct autopsy on

20.07.2015 at 3:00 PM; meaning thereby, FIR was

lodged with delay of more than 18/20 hours, hence,
facts and time mentioned in the FIR were not genuine.
It is routine of police to keep the space in the daily
diary and page in the FIR register book and after
completing the preliminary investigation with
connivance of the family of the deceased involves the
accused party otherwise there was no justification for
providing the FIR and other documents (police papers)
with delay of 15/16 hours for conducting the
postmortem. Twenty hours delay in conducting the
post-mortem examination is sufficiently enough to
draw an inference that neither the FIR was recorded

nor relevant police papers were ready till that time and

conducting post-mortem with such delay was fatal as
held in case reported as, Ata Muhammad and another
vs. The State (1995 SCMR 599) wherein it was held
as under:-

“We know by our experience that time of recording
of F.I.R. is not always genuine. The police, after
learning about the commission of the crime keeps
the space in the daily diary (Roznamcha) and a
page in the F.I.R. Register blank for incorporating
therein the gist of the information, the factum of
registration of the case and the detailed report
subsequently, in the light of preliminary
investigation made by it. Furthermore, in this case
the F.ILR. was lodged by Bati eye-witnesses himself.
So, his previous statement recorded in the F.IR.
does not come from any distinct source. It is well
settled that a witness cannot corroborate himself by
repeating the version before different persons on
different occasions. The evidence at the trial cannot
be corroborated or reinforced by proving that the
witness had made a similar statement to a third
party on a previous occasion. Mere repetition of a
story will not give it any force or prove its truth.”

The testimony of Investigating Officer/PW-12 also
falsifies the prosecution story regarding prompt
registration of case as he admitted in his cross-
examination regarding shifting time of dead-body from
the place of occurrence at about 01:00/01:30 a.m.
(night) through Tractor-Trolley despite having Carry-
Dabba. It is also cleared from his testimony about
approaching of the police by the complainant to inform
about occurrence through application at 12:15 a.m.
(night). He further deposed that,

“Tt is correct that neither complainant nor any of
the witness deposed before me that they tried to
rescue deceased Intizar Hussain when accused
persons were inflicting injuries on his body.
Neither the complainant nor any of the witness
deposed before me that why they did not informed
the police. Complainant and witness even not

imparted any reasoning to me that why they did not

and Shenaz Bibi to any hospital, inspite of the fact
that as per their version they had a carry Daba
with them at that time.”

Therefore, the evidence on this aspect of the case is

artificial, hence, disbelieved.

Police file is also silent about recording of any
statement of a person from the locality regarding
occurrence, holding of any Punchayat and presence of
complainant party at the place of occurrence. Even
during trial none of the participants of the Punchayat

was produced.

Another aspect which is pertinent to mention here is
that son of Sharif Lumberdar namely Sarfraz had
subsequently been nominated by the complainant
through his supplementary statement on 24.08.2015 as
one of the unknown person along with Muhammad
Hayat son of Muhammad Hanif. But their names were
not mentioned in column No.3 of report under Section
173, Cr.P.C. PW-9-Mst. Shehnaz Bibi, admitted that
till that day, she got no information about the three

unknown accused persons.

As per story of the prosecution, three unknown
persons played an active role to get the deceased out of
Carry-Dabba, dragging him to the place of occurrence
and firmly holding the deceased (aged 30-32 years)
from his legs and head. If these unknown persons had
not taken the initiative of playing a vital role, at least
main injury No.1 slitting of throat, could not be

effected/inflicted.

xvi) All the more, the best evidence which could come
either from the injured wife of the deceased Mst.
Shazia Bibi or from the aforesaid Lumberdar, Head of
Punchayat, has been withheld. Mst. Shazia Bibi got
herself medically examined and her MLR was
exhibited as Exh.PB, PB/1 & PC; she got recorded her
statement under Section 161, Cr.P.C. on 18.08.2015
but she being the star/direct witness was not produced
before the learned trial Court, leading to adverse
inference against prosecution. Reference is made to
Muhammad Saleem v. Muhammad Azan and another
(2011 SCMR 474), wherein it has been held that:-

“According to the prosecution one Muhammad
Hayat was also injured in the incident in question
who was not produced by the prosecution without
sufficient reasons highlighted by the prosecution,
therefore, learned High Court was justified to
presume that had the witness been produced he
would not have supported prosecution case as law
laid down by this Court in Muhammad Shafqat’s
case (1970 SCMR 713).”

Reference has also been made to “Ghulam Qadir and 2
others v. The State” (2008 SCMR 1221), relevant portion
whereof is reproduced below:-

“It may be pertinent to mention here that
Muhammad Zaman, Muhammad Akhtar and Akbar
Khan employees of the Mill, stated to have
sustained injuries in the occurrence, have not been
produced at the trial. Best evidence has been
withheld without any justifiable reason. Needless to
add that if, an injured witness himself does not
appear to charge an accused for his injury and the
Court is not satisfied with his disability or
incompetence or reasons for not appearing then the
conviction for his injury cannot be recorded on the
basis of other evidence under Qisas, as held by this
Court in Asghar Ali alias Sabah v. The State 1992
SCMR 2088.”

10. The motive behind the occurrence as set-up by the
prosecution was alleged to be that Intizar Hussain, deceased-brother
of the complainant, had contracted love marriage with Shazia Bibi,
daughter of accused-Muhammad Hanif, sister of Muhammad Imran
and Muhammad Shehzad, about six years prior to the occurrence
and due to that grudge all the accused with their common intention
committed qatl-i-amd of Intizar Hussain deceased. In support of the
motive, the prosecution failed to lead any independent credible
evidence. On the other hand, in the testimony of PW-9 Mst.
Shehnaz Bibi, she deposed in her examination-in-chief:-

“As the wife of Intizar Hussain Mst. Shazia Bibi had

gone to her parental house on account of resentment

with her husband.”
She did not allege contract of marriage as motive rather alleged
differences between husband and wife as motive. Likewise, PW-10
Nazir Ahmed in his testimony alleged the same reason as deposed
by his wife i.e. PW-9. Both these witnesses did not allege/plead
about nourishing of grudge on account of love marriage. Even if it
is accepted that said marriage was not an arranged one but she did
come back to her parents’ house after six years. As time
cures/settles such a dispute, therefore, for that matter they accepted
Mst. Shazia Bibi with her minor children and subsequently she was
allowed to go with her husband in a very peaceful manner as there
is nothing on record to establish showing any intention of accused

party for taking of any revenge.

Murder Reference No.288/2019.

Motive has been elaborated upon by the honourable Supreme

Court in the case of “Pathan v. The State” (2015 SCMR 315)

wherein it has been held that,

“True that, motive in legal parlance is ordinarily not
considered as a principal or primary evidence in a
murder case, however, in some rare cases like the
present one, the motive would play a very vital and
decisive role for committing a murder. As the motive
has almost disappeared for want of proof and being
entirely feeble, artificial and not at all appealing to a
prudent mind, therefore, it has rendered the entire
episode of the tragedy doubtful. On this score too the
prosecution case is liable to be discarded as a whole”.

In view of the above, the motive part stands unproved.

And if the motive is not proved, then ocular evidence is required to

be evaluated with great caution. The case of “Noor Muhammad v.

The State and another” (2010 SCMR 97) is referred. The relevant

portion reads as under:

11.

"Thus, the prosecution has failed to prove the
motive. It has been held in the case of Muhammad
Sadiq v. Muhammad Sarwar 1979 SCMR 214 that
when motive is alleged but not proved then the ocular
evidence required to be scrutinized with great caution.
In the case of Hakim Ali v. The State 1971 SCMR 432
it has been held that the prosecution though not called
upon to establish motive in every case, yet once it has
set up a motive and failed to establish it, the
prosecution must suffer consequence and not the
defence. In the case of Ameenullah v. State PLD 1976
SC 629 it has been held that where motive is an
important constituent and is found by the Court to be
untrue, the Court should be on guard to accept
prosecution story".

PW-8 Muhammad Yaseen/complainant and PW-10

Nazir Ahmed are the real brothers of the deceased-Intizar Hussain

whereas PW-9 injured Mst. Shehnaz Bibi is sister-in-law of the
deceased and wife of PW-10 Nazir Ahmad, therefore, closely
related to the deceased; hence, are held to be interested witnesses,
so, their testimony could not safely be believed inasmuch as, as per
FIR as well as ocular version furnished by these three P.Ws., if to
the fortune of the deceased brother, his three real brothers, i.e.
Muhammad Yaseen, Nazir Ahmed and Qurban Ali, were present at
the time and place of occurrence along with their closely related
male family members i.e. Amanat Ali and Farooq Ahmed, both
sons of Bashir Ahmad, they could have been helpful to the
deceased instead of being mere spectators. Admittedly, they did not
even make an attempt to raise alarm, rather gave a free hand to the
accused to inflict as many as twelve injuries on the person of the
deceased inasmuch as all the three P.Ws. are consistent on the point
that they never received any injury, i.e. PW-8/Muhammad Yaseen
deposed that, “other than Shehnaz Bibi none of us was medically
examined”. PW-9 Mst. Shehnaz Bibi admitted that,
“Apart from Intizar Hussain we were seven in
numbers. None from the brothers of the deceased or
witness was medically examined. Volunteered, but they
received injuries. None from the brothers of deceased
or any witness received any “Churri’ blow on any
part of their body.”
PW-10 Nazir Ahmed stated that, “none from all the witnesses

including me became slightly injured in this case.” Said PW went

one step ahead by admitting that, “after the occurrence police

reached at the spot and he also reached there’. Meaning thereby,
he did not witness the occurrence.

12. Although it was alleged that PWs were closely related
witnesses hence their testimony was inimical to implicate all the
accused persons in this case falsely. There is no hard and fast rule
to throw out the testimony of the interested relative witnesses
merely for the reason of relationship but at the same time to give
weight to that testimony, its credibility must be examined on the
touchstone of free from doubt, infirmity or exclusion of possibility
of implication of wrong person(s). What we have noted in
preceding paras about the doubts, infirmity and deficiency in
evidence, is sufficient to hold that the witnesses had not seen the
occurrence, and had they been present at the spot, the occurrence
might have not taken place in the manner as the prosecution flouted
in its case.

13. In view of the evidence taken from record, it is held
that as the ocular account was furnished by interested witnesses
being the real brothers and sister-in-law of deceased-Intizar
Hussain, therefore, statements of such interested witnesses cannot
be taken into consideration when they do not inspire confidence
about their presence at the spot. At the cost of repetition, obviously
the three real brothers and closely related members assembled and
accompanied the deceased to protect him. Their presence has

become doubtful on account of insufficient and implausible

explanation not to participate/act/react to save the life of their real
brother. And it is well settled that when the ocular evidence is held
to be unreliable, the strongest corroborative evidence may not cure
such deficiency/lacking inasmuch as when the direct evidence is
unacceptable, the corroborative evidence becomes worthless.
Reliance is placed on “Noor Muhammad v. The State and another”
(2010 SCMR 97) and “Dr. Israr-ul-Haq v. Muhammad Fayyaz and
another ’”’.

In case titled as “Dr. Israr-Ul-Haq Versus Muhammad
Fayyaz and another” (2007 SCMR 1427), the august
Supreme Court of Pakistan held that

4... It is also a settled law when ocular evidence is
disbelieved in a criminal case then the recovery of
an incriminating article in the nature of weapon
of offence does not by itself prove the prosecution
case.... It is also a settled law that the direct
evidence having failed, the
corroborative evidence is of no help.

In case titled as “Yasir Versus The State” (2010 Y R 2344), the
Hon’ble Lahore High Court held that

“Even otherwise, it is settled law that when the ocular
account is not reliable then merely on the basis of
supporting pieces of evidence, conviction cannot be
made. Reliance has been placed on the case of Riaz
Ahmad (Supra) (sic), wherein the Hon'ble apex Court
has observed as under:

"The prosecution also produced the positive
F.S.L. report meaning thereby the crime empties
secured from place of incident matched with the
gun recovered from the possession of the
appellant. This being a corroborative piece of
evidence, which by itself is insufficient to convict
the appellant in absence of substantive piece of

evidence. Reference is invited to Ijaz Ahmad v.
State 1997 SCMR 1279. It was held in the case of
Asadullah v. Muhammad Ali PLD 1971 SC 541,
that corroborative evidence is meant to test the
veracity of ocular evidence. Both corroborative
and ocular testimony is to be read together and
not in isolation. In the case of Saifullah v. the
State 1985 SCMR 410, it was held that when there
is no eye-witness to be relied upon then there is
nothing, which can be corroborated by the
recovery. It has been held in the case of Riaz
Masih v. The State 1995 SCMR 1730 that
recovery of crime weapon by itself is not sufficient
for conviction on murder charge. In the case of
Siraj v. Crown PLD 1956 Federal Court 123, it
was held that recovery of the handle of blood-
stained hatchet at the instance of the accused,
when other evidence was disbelieved, then it was
not enough for conviction".

14. In view of the above, when prosecution evidence is not
free from doubt then the defence version taken by the appellants in
their statements under Section 342, Cr.P.C. is to be believed in
total. In this view of the matter, the alleged recoveries of Churras
from appellants are inconsequential. It is well settled law that
when presence of the eye-witnesses is not found free from doubt
and is not confidence inspiring, in such eventuality, the benefit of
doubts goes to the accused as a matter of right and not as a grace
and in granting such benefit, single circumstance is sufficient. In
case titled as “Abdul Jabbar and another V. The State” (2019
SCMR 129), the August Supreme Court of Pakistan held that,

“11. Having concluded in such a manner, the
learned High Court still went on to maintain the
conviction of the appellants under section 302(b)/34,

P.P.C. while converting their sentence of death into

imprisonment for life. We are afraid this approach of
the learned High Court is a complete departure from
the principles settled for administration of justice in
criminal cases. It is the settled principle of law that
once a single loophole is observed in a case
presented by the prosecution much less glaring
conflict in the ocular account and medical evidence
or for that matter where presence of eye-witnesses is
not free from doubt, the benefit of such
loophole/lacuna in the prosecution case
automatically goes in favour of an accused.”
15. For what has been discussed above, we have come to
an irresistible conclusion that the prosecution had failed to prove
the case against the appellants beyond any shadow of doubt. Hence,
Criminal Appeal Nos. 54462/2019, 54463/2019 and 56789/2019
are hereby accepted, the impugned judgment of conviction and
sentence recorded by the learned trial is set-aside and all the
appellants namely, Muhammad Imran, Muhammad Shahzad,
Muhammad Rizwan and Muhammad Naveed are acquitted of the
charges by extending them the benefit of doubt.
16. Criminal Appeal No.54461/2019 filed by Muhammad
