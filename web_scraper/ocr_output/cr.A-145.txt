3. When did not plead guilty by the

aie
statement recorded by the learned counsel for the
complainant and learned Public Prosecutor.
Thereafter, the accused facing trial was
examined under section 342 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, wherein he negated the
prosecution evidence through his respective
answers and posed innocence.

4. At the end, in Sessions Case No. 57/7 of
the year 2013, the learned Additional Sessions
Judge/ Izafi Zila Qazi Matta came up with his
judgment dated 05.05.2014, whereby the

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
e Both the sentences shall run concurrently,
however, benefit of section 382-B Cr. P.C. was
extended to the accused/Appellant.

5. We have afforded fair opportunity of
hearing to the learned counsel for the
accused/Appellant, learned counsel for the
complainant and learned Astt: Advocate General
for the State, record was delved deep into with
their valuable assistance.

6. The prosecution story mainly hinges
upon the ocular account of Mst. Nusrat Bibi
examined as PW-6, who is said to have witnessed
the occurrence hounding after her deceased
husband and the accused/Appellant Muhammad
Hanif right from her house to the place of
occurrence known as Jungle Mehrab Paty Wond
Banda. It was on 24.08.2013 when it struck 2
o’clock the accused/Appellant Muhammad Hanif
had come to the house of the deceased Alam Sher
duly armed with Kalashnikov and after demand
of the borrowed money which became the cause
of death of her deceased husband. Thereafter,
they left for the place where this murder took

place. The deceased had left behind another

widow by the name of Mst. Shahida Bibi
examined as PW-7, who supported the
complainant Mst. Nusrat Bibi PW-6 with regard
to the motive being set that on account of the
borrowed money for its return the
accused/Appellant Muhammad Hanif became
infuriated who took her husband outside their
house while Mst. Nusrat Bibi (PW-6) charged
them and at Asar Vela she was informed that her
husband has been killed by the © said
accused/Appellant Muhammad Hanif. These
important prosecution witnesses if are believed to
be truthful witnesses being of ocular account it
would bring the accused/Appellant's case not
only for the punishment awarded by the learned
Sessions Court but also criminal revision
preferred by the complainant for enhancement
would be worth for its consideration. The
conduct of these witnesses who are widows
would be rational particularly when Mst. Nusrat
Bibi had run down her husband and_ the
accused/Appellant to the place which is a densely

forest. To believe her, PW-6 Mst. Nusrat Bibi at

the time of lodging of the First Information
Report has not mentioned about carrying
the Kalashnikov when  accused/Appellant
Muhammad Hanif had all alone came to their
house while in the examination-in-chief at the
very opening Para she has improved her
statement by stating that the accused/Appellant
Hanif had come to their house alongwith
Kalashnikov. She has been confronted when

replied that:-

Being the sole witness to the

occurrence if she would have been there at the
relevant time and the place where the deceased
was put to death the accused/Appellant should
have also resorted to kill her, but this fact has

utterly been denied in the following manner:-

under an admission PW-6 deposed in her cross-

8. While these extracts from cross-
examinations of these important prosecution
witnesses who are widows of the deceased
particularly when PW-6 Mst. Nusrat Bibi has
stated that she had followed her husband and the
accused/Appellant to the place where the murder
has taken place which is densely forest. Even
while making report after long 5 hours it would
we
oe sufficient to observe with certainty that the
conduct of both these widows/prosecution
witnesses is quite unnatural and this occurrence
seems to be un-witnessed by anyone amongst

these widows.

9, It has been held in 2003 SCMR 1466

"Mst. Shamim and 2 others vs the State and

another" as under:

“prosecution story being foundation on
which edifice of the prosecution case
was raised occupied a pivotal position in
a case, it should, therefore, stand to
reason and must be natural, convincing
and free from any inherent improbability
and it was neither safe to believe a
prosecution story which did not meet
said requirements nor a prosecution case
based on improbable story could sustain
conviction."

In another wisdom reported in 1999
SCMR 1220 "Muhammad Khan and another vs
The State''. On appraisal of the evidence, the
presence of the eyewitnesses at the spot at the
relevant time and accompanied the deceased to
the place of occurrence if create doubts it would

be given worth as "conviction must be based on

—_—
unimpeachable evidence and certainty and_any

doubt arising in the prosecution case_must be

resolved in favour of the accused".

A similar occurrence was reported in

2002 _YLR_ 593 (Lahore) ''Mst. Safia_vs_ The

State", where conduct of the eyewitnesses at the

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan

s—

“9 =

time of occurrence was unnatural and
unbelievable benefit of doubt was extended to an
accused and was acquitted accordingly. The
Judgment of the Hon'ble Peshawar High Court
Peshawar reported in 2002 P Cr. LJ 1914
(Peshawar) ''Mir Mat Khan alias Matokai_vs
The State" was also delivered in similar like
circumstances, where appreciation of evidence
would require thorough scrutiny particularly
when interested evidence like here, the deceased
widows statements are to be taken with great care
and caution and these statements are to be
scrutinized for its reliability.

Searching altogether similar type of
case cited as 2002 P Cr. LJ 384 (Lahore) "' Altaf
and 4 others vs The State’ is also considered

where conduct of eyewitness is shown unnatural

pod and the story had been concocted in order to

falsely implicate the accused in the case.
Occurrence has not occasioned as stated by the
eye-witnesses. Ocular testimony was
contradictory on material points. Medical

evidence did not corroborate. Investigation in the

Nawab (0.8.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
-10-
case was not thoroughly made. Benefit of doubt
was extended to the accused. In this case too, the
occurrence seems to be un-witnessed as
Mst. Nusrat Bibi has cited herself to be present at
the spot where her husband was put to death
while watching the fire shots attributed by the
accused/Appellant which killed Alam Sher.

10. Where the medical evidence contradict
these statements altogether, PW-9 Dr. Shah
Kameen Khan Medical Officer has suggested
entry wound on right side scalp and a large size
exist wound on right side scalp. There is entry
wound on right side chest. Exist on right side
front of chest While 3rd entry wound on left side
chest back. Exist on front of left side chest,
therefore, there is also contradictory statement of
PW-7 Mst. Shahida stating watching fire shots 20
in number from such close range and it will bring
this case under the shadow of doubt on this score
too.

11. The site plan has shown panoramic
view where the deceased has been put to death in

a place which is densely forest surrounded by tall

Nawab (0.8.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan

-ll-
trees, there is zigzag path and the sole eyewitness
i.e. PW-6 Mst. Nusrat Bibi widow of deceased
has been shown at such a distance from that
angle, it is almost impossible to watch the
occurrence, thereby it also becomes a ground that
this occurrence has been un-witnessed and un-
seen.

12. Now coming to the recovery of
Kalashnikov alongwith live rounds allegedly
recovered from accused/Appellant on 24.08.2013
upon his arrest and taken into possession vide
recovery memo Ex. PW-5/1, suffice it to say, that
bare perusal of the recovery memo by itself
would reveal that how could _ the
accused/Appellant has appeared so casually in
front of the police officials duly armed with

Kalashnikov which as per version of prosecution

Pe /_.has been used as weapon of offence in respect of

murder of deceased. Even for the sake of
arguments if the accused/Appellant may have
committed the murder of deceased he would have
definitely avoid the police party in such

circumstances. Moreover, as per version of the

Nawab (0.8.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
por

-12-
sole eyewitness of the occurrence PW-6 Mst.
Nusrat Bibi the accused/Appellant was arrested
by the police from his house, whereas as per
statements of the recovery witnesses the alleged
recovery was effected from path known as 'Gham
Said’. Though the FSL report has been furnished
in positive but during cross-examination PW-3
Akbar Aman Constable (recovery witness) did
not specifically mention the source of
identification via which the accused/Appellant
was apprehended duly armed with Kalashnikov
during dark hours of the night. Thus, the mode
and manner of the alleged recovery of

Kalashnikov by all means is doubtful.

It is settled by now that the recovery of
empties etc are always considered to be
corroborative piece of evidence and such kind of
evidence by itself is not sufficient to bring home
the charges against the accused especially when
the other material put-forward by the prosecution
in respect of guilt of the accused/Appellant has

already been disbelieved.

Nawab (0.8.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
-13~-

It has been affirmed by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court of Pakistan in case cited as 2001

SCMR_ 424 "" Imran Ashraf and _7 others vs the

State"' in the following manner:-

"Recovery of incriminating articles is
used for the purpose of providing
corroboration to the ocular testimony.
Ocular evidence and_ recoveries,
therefore, are to be _ considered
simultaneously in order to reach for a

just conclusion."

Likewise, if any other judgment is needed

on the same analogy, reference can be placed on

2007 _ SCMR_ 1427 _(""— Dr. __Israr-ul-Haq _ vs

Muhammad _Fayyaz_and_another"", wherein the
relevant citation (c) enunciates:
"Direct evidence having failed,
corroborative evidence was of no help.
When ocular evidence is disbelieved in
a criminal case then the recovery of
' po. an incriminating article in the nature

of weapon of offence does not by itself

prove the prosecution case.

13. The gist of the whole discussion is that
the prosecution case against the
accused/Appellant is pregnant with doubts. It is
settled principle of law that in case of doubt, the

benefit thereof must accrue in favour of the

Nawab (0.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
-14-
accused as a matter of right and not of grace. It
was observed by the apex Court in the case of

"Tariq Pervez v. The State 1995 SCMR 1345
"that for_giving the benefit of doubt it was not

necessary __that___there should __be__many

circumstances creating doubts". If there is

circumstance which created reasonable doubt in

a prudent mind about the guilt of the accused,
then the accused would be entitled to the benefit
of doubt not as a matter of grace and concession
but as a matter of right.

Similar citation of judgment 2008

SCMR 1221 "Ghulam Qadir and 2 others vs the

State" Supra enunciates:-

"Benefit of doubt. Principle of
applicability. For the purpose of benefit
, wo of doubt to an accused, more than one
infirmity is not required. Single infirmity
creating reasonable doubt in the mind of
a reasonable and_ prudent person
regarding the truth of charge, makes the

whole case doubtful. "

14. In view of the above discussion, we are

of the absolute view that the prosecution failed to

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
-15-
prove its case against the accused/Appellant
beyond any shadow of doubt; therefore, his
conviction cannot be maintained, ergo, while
extending the benefit of doubt, we accept this
appeal by setting aside his conviction and
sentences recorded by the learned trial Court
through the impugned judgment dated 05.05.2014
and acquit him of the charges leveled against him.
He be set free forthwith, if not required in any

other case.

15. Similarly connected Criminal Revision
bearing No. 32-M of 2014 filed for enhancement
of the sentence by the complainant-party is also

dismissed having become infructuous.

16. These are the detailed reasons for our

short order of even date.
