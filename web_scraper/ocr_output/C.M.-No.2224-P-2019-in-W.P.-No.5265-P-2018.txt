General, Mr. Shumail Ahmad Butt, Advocate
General and Mr. Amir Javed, Advocate, on
behalf of applicants/respondents No.1, 2, 3 and 5.

petitioners in main writ petitions.

RRKKKEEE

ABDUL SHAKOOR, J. Through this application,

applicants/respondents No.1, 2, 3 and 5, have prayed for
the constitution of Larger Bench in the main writ petition
and petitions connected therewith, to give an
independent view in it, since Divisional Bench, headed
by the Hon’ble Chief Justice in the case of “Abdul
Rasheed _Vs._ Federation of Pakistan _and_others”
(decided on 18.10.2018), has taken a view altogether
different than the one earlier expressed by 21 different
Benches of this Court in 24 cases involving the same
points as were involved in the aforesaid case of Abdul
Rasheed. It was also made a point for the constitution of
Larger Bench that previously Divisional Benches of this

Court, while delivering the judgments in similar cases,

Page 2 of 11

have held that it lacked the jurisdiction to question the
verdicts of Field General Court Martial passed under the
Pakistan Army Act, 1952.

2. Learned Additional Attorney General, learned
Advocate General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Mr. Amir
Javed, Advocate, appearing on behalf of
applicants/respondents No.1, 2, 3 and 5 in support of
their prayer made in the instant application for the
constitution of Larger Bench in the aforesaid writ
petition and petitions connected therewith, have argued,
the Divisional Bench, headed by the Hon’ble Chief
Justice, while acquitting the accused/convicts in the
above referred case (Abdul Rasheed Vs. Federation of
Pakistan and others) and connected matters therewith;
who were convicted by the Field General Court Martials
under the Pakistan Army Act, 1952 has not taken note of
24 decisions of almost 21 Benches of this Court,
wherein, in similar cases having the same facts, in view
of limited scope of the judicial review mandated under
Article 199 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973, in the
face of repeated admissions of the guilt made by the
convicts, culminating in the one before the Court
Martial, have observed, it would not be appropriate for
this Court to interfere in the impugned conviction

recorded and sentence awarded by the Field General

Page 3 of 11

Court Martials under the Pakistan Army Act, 1952. It is,
by now, well settled through the judicial
pronouncements of the Apex Court that earlier judgment
of Bench of equal Judges of the High Court on the same
point of law was binding on the subsequent Bench, and
if the subsequent Bench intends to take a different view,
then it has to make a request for the constitution of
Larger Bench, however, with all respect and humility,
the Bench, headed by the Hon’ble Chief Justice, has
given a different verdict than the verdicts of the earlier
Divisional Benches of this Court, on the same very
point, therefore, it has become essential, a Larger Bench
be constituted for an independent view in the aforesaid
writ petition and petitions connected therewith. Since the
same will resolve the controversy of different opinions
of the Benches of this Court in similar matters, decided
by the Military Courts. In support of their contention,

they relied upon the cases “Multiline Associates Vs.

Ardeshir_Cowsjee (PLD 1995 SC 423), Ardeshir
Cowsjee_Vs._Karachi_Building Control__Authority

(KMC) (1999 SCMR_ 2883), Atma Ram Vs. State of

Punjab (AIR_1959 SC 519 ref), M/s. WAK Limited
Multan Road, Lahore Vs. Collector Central Excise and
Sales Tax, Lahore (Now Commissioner Inland

Revenue _LTU, _Lahore 2018 SCMR __ 1474

(PLD 2019 SC 43).

3. On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the petitioner of the main petition and
petitioners of the connected petitions, vehemently
opposed, the instant application being based on malafide
and not maintainable and prayed for its dismissal with
costs. They, in support of the point of malafide, pointed
out, the Bench, headed by the Hon’ble Chief Justice had
been stressing to the applicants/respondents to argue the
case but they have avoided it on the one pretext or the
other. On 19.03.2019, applicants/respondents were given
last opportunity by the Bench to produce the relevant
record regarding conviction of the accused/convicts for
the examination of their counsel on 25.05.2019
positively, failing which the matter would be heard on
the available record on 28.05.2019. However, on
28.05.2019 instead of submitting the requisite record on
the basis of which conviction was recorded against the
accused/convicts of the aforesaid cases,
applicants/respondents only submitted the comments. As

the comments so filed were not supported by the sworn

Page 5 of 11

affidavit, therefore, they were directed by the Bench to
submit the said comments alongwith sworn affidavit on
the next date of hearing. After the receipt of comments,
the case was fixed for hearing on 04.09.2019 and
applicants/respondents’ counsel instead of arguing the
case, sought further time. However, the Bench adjourned
the matter with the condition that it will be decided on
01.10.2019 on the basis of written arguments of the
applicants/ respondents and arguments of the counsel of
the accused/convicts of the above petitions. On
01.10.2019, the applicants/respondents, instead of
submitting written arguments, as per the direction of the
Bench dated 04.09.2019, filed the instant application for
the constitution of Larger Bench. This conduct of the
applicants/respondents is more than sufficient in
proving, the instant application is filed with malafide
intention to delay the disposal of the above writ petitions
which are pending disposal since long. In support of the
point of non-maintainability of the instant application, it
was contended, there is no provision in the Peshawar
High Court Rules or Civil Procedure Code, 1908, which
may give a right to party of case to file an application
before the Court for the constitution of Larger Bench;
and thus, the instant application is liable to be dismissed

on this score alone.

4. We have seriously considered the submissions of
the learned counsel of the parties and carefully gone
through the judgment passed by the Bench of this Court
in the case of “Abdul Rasheed Vs. Federation of
Pakistan and others” decided on 18.10.2018 and earlier
24 judgments of this Court, probably, rendered by 21
different Benches.

5. No doubt, it is well settled principle, when a
subsequent Bench of the High Court comprising same
numbers of Judges, does not wish to agree with the view
of earlier Benches on the same point then instead of
giving a different view, it has to request for the
constitution of Larger Bench to revisit the earlier view of
the Court. The wisdom behind to honor the earlier view
of the Benches of the same High Court by the
subsequent Bench on the same point of law, is to
maintain harmony in the decisions of the Court on the
same point of law. If, a Bench of equal numbers of
Judges, is permitted to give a different view than the
earlier view of the Bench of equal numbers of Judges on
the same point of law, it will certainly create a chaos and
confusion, not only for the public at large, but also for
the Courts, subordinate to the High Court. Since, Courts
subordinate to the High Court will be unable to follow

different views of the High Court on the same point of

Page 7 of 11

law as guiding principle for resolution of the controversy
arising in the cases on the same point. Perusal of the
judgment dated 18.10.2018 passed in the case of Abdul
Rasheed would show that in it, no different view has
been expressed than the view of earlier Benches of this
Court, as submitted by the applicants/respondents. It has
exercised the jurisdiction of judicial review, keeping in
view the record, came before it relating to the cases of
accused/convicts decided by the Military Courts. As, it is
settled principle, High Court, in exercise of its judicial
review under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, 1973, has the mandate to
positively interfere with the decisions of the Criminal
Courts/Military Courts, against which no right of appeal
is available to the accused/convicts. If the case of
prosecution was based on no evidence or insufficient
evidence, void, quorum non-judice, without jurisdiction
and based on malafide or malice in law. A close
examination of the earlier judgments of the Benches of
this Court would show that there was no such material
before them, which came in the case of Abdul Rasheed
and cases connected therewith. Hence, they have
declined to interfere with the conviction recorded and
sentence awarded to the convicts by the Military Courts.

Whereas, the Bench decided the case of Abdul Rasheed

Page 8 of 11

Vs. Federation of Pakistan and other connected cases,
has summoned the complete record of the Military
Courts on the basis of which it has recorded the
conviction of the accused/convicts and accordingly
awarded them sentences. Examination of the said record
revealed to the Bench that questions put to all the
accused-persons by the Military Courts were one and the
same with exactly the same answers in all cases.
Statements made by the accused-persons show that they
spoke what they were briefed in the Interment Center, as
it was next to impossible, the accused-persons, after
remaining in the Interment Center for years, could
remember the exact date, time and minute of the alleged
occurrence in which they were convicted. Proceedings,
before the Military Courts, infact, were a complete
prosecution show and accused/convicts were denied their
fundamental right of engaging a private counsel of their
choice at their own expense. It was also observed by the
Bench, nothing on the record showed that during trial,
families of the accused/convicts who frequently
requested for meeting with them in the Interment Center
were ever informed or had the knowledge of the trial
proceedings. The alleged confessional statements made
by the accused/convicts without any independent advice

after months/years of confinement with Military Courts

Page 9 of 11

and Interment Center, cannot be made a base for
awarding them a sentence of capital punishment. All this
led the Bench to conclude that it, in view of the aforesaid
principle of judicial review can interfere with the
conviction recorded and sentences awarded to the
accused/convicts by the Military Courts.

6. The conduct of the applicants/respondents which
has been pointed out by the learned counsel of the
petitioners is showing, they have filed the instant
application simply to linger on the matters pending
adjudication before this Court for its disposal since long.
It is also worth to mention here, applicants/respondents
since the admission of the aforesaid petitions till
27.09.2019 has never made a request for the constitution
of Larger Bench. When they were finally directed by the
Bench to submit their written arguments on 01.10.2019
for the disposal of the aforesaid cases then they sprung
into action for filing the aforesaid application for the
constitution of Larger Bench. We are fully agreed with
the contention of the learned counsel of the
accused/convicts that there is no provision either in
Peshawar High Court Rules or Civil Procedure Code,
1908, which may give a right to party of a case to make a
request for the constitution of Larger Bench. It is also

not out of context to mention here, this Court till date has

Page 10 of 11

neither heard the arguments of the learned counsel of the
parties in the aforesaid writ petition and petitions
connected therewith, nor a situation has arisen wherein it
could examine the record. As, till date, the
applicants/respondents have not produced the record of
the Military Courts on the basis of which it has recorded
conviction of the accused/convicts of the petitions
pending disposal. Thus, no question of constitution of
Larger Bench arises.

7. Apart from the above, it is a matter of record,
applicants/respondents have already challenged the
decision of this Court rendered in the case of Abdul
Rasheed and cases connected therewith before the Apex
Court. The Apex Court, after entertaining the appeals of
the applicants/respondents, was pleased to suspend the
operation of the judgment rendered by this Court in the
case of Abdul Rasheed and cases connected therewith.
When such being the case, we understand, this Court
cannot constitute a Larger Bench in the case, which’s
operation stood suspended by the order of the Apex
Court viz-a-viz the judgments rendered by the earlier
Benches of this Court.

8. For what has been discussed above, we do not see
any reason for the constitution of Larger Bench as

prayed for by the applicants/respondents No.1, 2, 3 and

Page 11 of 11

5. Accordingly, the instant CM is dismissed, being based
on malafide and not maintainable.

9. Main writ petition and petitions connected
therewith are adjourned to 26.11.2019 for final
arguments. Till the date fixed, interim order granted in
all the cases shall continue.

10. It may be noted, no further adjournment shall be
granted in the aforesaid cases to anyone on any ground
on the date fixed. Copy of this order be placed on the
connected writ petitions.
