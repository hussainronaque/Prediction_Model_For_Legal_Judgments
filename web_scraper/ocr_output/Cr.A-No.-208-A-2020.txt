Date of Hearing 08.02.2023

Appellants (Muhammad Mr. Muhammad Arshad

Liagat & another) by Awan, Advocate.

Respondent (State) by Sardar Ali Raza, AAG.
Complainant by Mr. Shad Muhammad Khan,
Advocate.

WIQAR AHMAD, _J:- Matter was reported by
complainant Khanwaiz S/o Kala Khan on 15.12.2017
at 12:30 hours in Emergency Room of DHQ Hospital,
Abbottabad, by stating that on the relevant day, he
along with his father Kala Khan, brothers Sadiq and
Khursheed had appeared before High Court. After
leaving Court, they reached near Mansehra Wagon
Stand at 12:20 hours. Complainant along with his
brother Khursheed were ahead while their father Kala
Khan and brother Muhammad Sadiq were behind them

at some distance. They heard firing and saw that Liaqat
and Abdul Qayyum had been firing at Sadiq while
Haider Zaman and Rashid had been firing at Kala
Khan, as a result of which both of them sustained
firearm injuries. Accused also made firing upon
complainant and his brother Khursheed, however, they
rescued themselves by running from the spot.
Thereafter, they shifted injured to DHQ hospital,
Abbottabad. Occurrence was stated to have been
witnessed by complainant, his brother Khursheed and
other people present at the spot. Motive was disclosed
to be previous blood feud enmity between parties. On
the basis of said report of complainant, recorded in the
shape of Murasila Ex PW-10/1, FIR Ex PA was
registered against the accused.

2. Upon completion of investigation,
complete challan was submitted against the appellants
Liaqat and Abdul Qayyum as well as acquitted co-
accused Haider Zaman whereas challan under Section
512 Cr.P.C. was filed against absconding co-accused
Rashid. After supplying copies to the accused in
compliance of Section 265-C Cr.P.C, learned trial
Court framed charge against them to which they

pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order to prove
wo

its case against the accused, prosecution produced and
examined 16 PWs and closed its evidence. The learned
trial Court recorded statements of the
accused/appellants under Section 342 Cr.P.C. After
hearing arguments of learned counsel for the parties,
the learned trial Court convicted appellants Liaqat and
Abdul Qayyum, as mentioned above while co-accused
Haider Zaman was acquitted.

3. Appellants-convicts Muhammad Liaqat
and Abdul Qayyum sons of Kala Khan have filed
instant appeal against conviction and sentence passed
against them by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge/Model Criminal Trial Court, Abbottabad, vide
judgment dated 13.10.2020 in case FIR No. 1275
dated 15.12.2017 under Section 302/324/34 PPC of
Police Station Cantt: Abbottabad, whereby the
appellants-convicts had been convicted under Section
302-B PPC and sentenced to life imprisonment and to
pay compensation amounting to Rs. 500,000/- under
Section 544-A Cr.P.C. to the legal heirs of the
deceased, in default whereof they had to further
undergo SI for six months. Benefit of Section 382-B

Cr.P.C had been extended to the appellants. Connected
Criminal Revision bearing No. 43-A/2020 had been
filed by complainant Khanwaiz, seeking enhancement
of sentence awarded to the appellants while in Cr. A
No. 211-A/2020 complainant has assailed judgment of
learned trial Court to the extent of acquittal of co-
accused Haider Zaman. This single judgment is aimed
at the disposal of instant criminal appeal as well as
connected Criminal Revision No. 43-A/2020 and Cr.A
No. 211-A/2020, as all the connected matters are the
outcome of one and the same judgment of learned trial

Court.

[>

Learned counsel for the appellants argued
that the learned Court below has acquitted Haider
Zaman on same set of evidence while appellants
Liaqat and Abdul Qayyum have been convicted
thereon, which judgment should not be allowed to
sustain. He also contended that when four persons had
been charged for making firing, then damage should
have been much more than the one sustained by the
complainant party and therefore, the main story of
prosecution was not believable, particularly due to the
fact also that the PWs had escaped unhurt. He also

contended that locale of the injuries received by
nn

deceased Sadiq showed that he had been fired from
different angles out of which some of the fires also
appeared to be from a heighted place but site plan has
not been supporting version of the complainant in this
respect. The learned counsel also contended that report
has though been shown lodged within ten minutes, but
distance between place of occurrence and the hospital
could not have been covered in said ten minutes and
therefore, lodging of the report at the given time did
not seem to be appealable to a prudent mind. Learned
counsel for the appellant also placed his reliance on
the judgments reported as “2017 SCMR 1155, 2018
MLD 1635, 2014 SCMR 749, 2022 YLR

(Balochistan) 1620 and PLD 1990 Peshawar 10.

[et

{Learned counsel for complainant, while
rebutting arguments of learned counsel for the
appellants, contended that convicts/ appellants namely
Muhammad Liagat and Abdul Qayyum had been
arrested on the spot and therefore, their cases had been
different from accused Haider Zaman to whom, the
Court below had extended benefit of doubt. Learned
counsel further contended that a human being cannot

be treated to be a statue and that at the time of
occurrence, the deceased would definitely have been
trying to save himself and change his positions,
therefore receiving of injuries from different angles
would not belied the prosecution story.

6. Learned AAG stated that the occurrence
had taken place in city of Abbottabad and that hospital
being at very close distance of half kilometer, could be
reached within ten minutes. Learned AAG also stated
that being a spot arrest case, regarding accused/
appellants Liaqat and Abdul Qayyum, wherein report
has also been promptly lodged, the chances of
deliberation and consultations were not there prior to

lodging of the report.

7. We have heard arguments of learned

counsel for the parties and perused the record.

[2

Perusal of site plan Ex PW-15/2 reveals
that occurrence had taken place in the city of
Abbottabad on main road. Appellants namely Liaqat
and Abdul Qayyum have been arrested immediately
after occurrence while they were fleeing from the spot.
For proving their arrest in the stated manner,
prosecution had been relying on statement of PW

Tariq recorded as PW-4 and PW Ajmal Khan SHO
examined as PW-6. Both the appellants mentioned
above have been assigned the role of making firing at
deceased namely Sadiq. Deceased Muhammad Sadiq
had four entry wounds as per Postmortem report Ex
PW-9/1. Report in the case had been lodged with
promptitude wherein motive of blood feud enmity has
been mentioned. Prosecution have also been able to
prove presence of PWs on the spot.

9. So far as eyewitness account of the
occurrence is concerned, complainant of the case
namely Khanwaiz has been examined as PW-13 who
has stated in his examination-in-chief that on the day
of occurrence, he along with his father Kala Khan,
Sadiq and Khursheed had come to High Court as a bail
application of Khan Muhammad and Sajawal had been
fixed before the Court on 12.05.2017. When they had
been returning from this Court and going towards
Mansehra Wagon Stand, they were attacked by the
opposite party, among whom Liaqat and Abdul
Qayyum made firing on his brother Muhammad Sadiq
while Rashid (absconding accused) and Haider Zaman
(acquitted co-accused) made firing at his father Kala

Khan. He has also stated that he and other PW
Khursheed had been going ahead while his father and
brother were coming after them with a distance of
16/17 paces at the time of occurrence. He has also
stated that he and his surviving companion namely
Khursheed ran towards Adda and saved themselves,
while other people present at the spot also fled away
from the spot. They returned thereafter, lifted both the
deceased then injured and took them to DHQ hospital,
Abbottabad. He was also witness to the recovery
memo vide which IO recovered five empties of 30
bore from the spot and sealed them in parcel. Similar
narrations had also been offered by the other PW
namely Muhammad Khursheed. It is important to be
noted that both eyewitnesses have been subjected to
extraordinary lengthy cross-examination, but both the
eyewitnesses have remained firm and consistent
regarding mode and manner of commission of the
offence. No major contradiction could be solicited
from their mouths. Among minor contradictions,
learned counsel for the appellants has highlighted their
narrations in the cross-examination that on their arrival
in the hospital, Muhammad Sadiq died. By comparing

said part of his statement with the statement of doctor
namely Dr. Muhammad Irshad, (PW-8), wherein he
had stated that at 12:40 PM, he had examined
Muhammad Sadiq, the learned counsel was arguing
that the witness was telling lie and report had not been
lodged with that promptitude as mentioned in Murasila
i.e. at 12:30 hours, because according to doctor,
Muhammad Sadiq had been alive at 12:40 hours.
While stating that on their arrival at hospital
Muhammad Sadiq had died, the witness had not
mentioned any specific timing. It is important that as
per Postmortem report, the time between injury and
death of Muhammad Sadiq had been approximately 20
to 40 minutes. Thus difference of five or ten minutes
in narration of the occurrence wherein brother and
father of a person had been taken to hospital in an
extreme emergency, was not something which would
weaken the force of his statement. The hospital was
stated to be situated at a distance of half to 1 %
kilometer where also the exact distance could not be
expected from the witnesses, but it is apparent that the
hospital was situated in same vicinity. The occurrence
had taken place near a wagon stand and availability of

vehicle for taking the injured to hospital was also
beyond question. In emergency things get quicker and
when complainant had started lodging report of the
occurrence in ten minutes, then there is nothing

unnatural therein.

10. What is important to be noted is that both
the eyewitnesses have remained consistent regarding
all the important aspects of the case. Nothing could be
brought during their cross-examination which could
have shaken intrinsic worth of their testimonies. Their
presence was found proved for the reason that bail
application of their two brothers had been fixed for
arguments before this Court on the fateful day. Having
enmity, coming of more than one person for court
attendance was also understandable. Besides lodging
of a prompt report also fortifies the factum of their
presence. Inquest report Ex PW-10/5 in its column No.
4 indicated names of complainant as well as the other
PW as identifiers of the dead body. In such situation,
their presence on the spot also stands proved and
established.

11. The doctor (PW-8), who had examined
deceased then injured namely Kala Khan, has given

following narration of injuries;-
3.

Entrance wound: 4 x 1/3 inches left side base of
neck interior aspect inverted margins.

Exit Wound: I % inch x 1/3 inches back of right
side of chest mid and lower section everted
margins with profuse bleeding.

Gasping.

Similarly, in respect of injured Muhammad

Sadiq, he had also noted;

Ve

Entrance wound: % x % inch lefi iliac fossa
inverted margins with perfuse bleeding.
Entrance/exit wound across right forearm 6
inch x I % inches muscle deep.

Entrance wound ' inch x 1/3 inch mid and back

of lefi hand inverted margins with bleeding.

Similar description of injuries has been given by

Dr. Syed Imtiaz Ali Shah (PW-9) who conducted

postmortem examination of the deceased. In this

respect a part of cross examination of Dr. Syed Imtiaz

Ali Shah (PW-9), who had conducted postmortem

examination of both the deceased, would also be

beneficial which part is reproduced hereunder;

“It is correct that the dimension of injury
regard the entry wound No. A(2), entry wound
No. C(1), entry wound No. D(1) is 1x1 cm
whereas the dimension of entry wound B(1) is
“em x % em. It is correct that the possibility
cannot be ruled out that fire on the person of
deceased Kala Khan were made from different

ranges. Witness volunteered that the
difference between the dimension of injury
BU) as compared to other injuries may
depend upon several factors including the
distance of fire, the direction of the fire, the

area where the bullet hit, the muscle mass

,

elc.’

12. Both appellants i.c. Muhammad Liaqat
and Abdul Qayyum have been charged for making
firing at Muhammad Sadiq deceased. He had
admittedly received firearm injuries. Injuries were also
of different dimensions. So far as plea of learned
counsel for the appellants that injuries had been caused
by firing from different surface levels and ranges, are
concerned, same is not supported by other evidence on
record but the fact that the victims had received
different injuries from different angels was because of
the fact that neither the victims nor the assailants could
be presumed to be static and in a constant state at the
time of commission of offence. The description of
injuries in medico-legal report as well as postmortem
report have been corroborating testimony of the
eyewitnesses, so far as the appellants namely

Muhammad Liagat and Abdul Qayyum are concerned.
13. Case of the respondent/acquitted accused
(Haider Zaman) was however, different in this respect.
He along with the absconding co-accused namely
Rashid had been assigned the role of firing at deceased
Kala Khan. Kala Khan was shown to have received
one firearm injury, having a corresponding exit
wound. It was one of the factor that the learned trial
Court had given him benefit of doubt in the shape of
his acquittal.

14. Besides, appellants in the conviction
appeal namely Liagat and Abdul Qayyum had been
arrested by the local police in hot pursuit, immediately
after the occurrence. Prosecution have examined Tariq
No. 1039 (PW-4) and Amjad Khan SHO (PW-6) to
prove arrest of the appellants immediately after the
occurrence as well as for proving recovery of weapon
of offence from possession of appellant Muhammad
Liaqat at the time of his arrest. One of the issue
highlighted by learned counsel for the appellants at
bar, was that arrest had been made at 01:05/01:10 PM
(noon) as per statement of PW-6. In this respect, it is
important to be noted that case of prosecution has not

been that of spot arrest but that of arrest in hot pursuit.
Appellants, after commission of offence have no doubt
fled away from the spot and while running therefrom,
they had been chased by the policemen. It is also in the
evidence of Mushtaq No. 121/FC (PW-5)_ that
appellant Abdul Qayyum, while fleeing from the spot,
was having opportunity of throwing pistol in the Nalla
near wall of Cantonment Board. Besides they had also
been armed, having committed an offence moments
before and policemen would have been on guard so as
to ward of any damage to the chasing party. All this
had consumed time which is reflected in time
difference between the occurrence and arrest of the
appellants. This fact is therefore, not vitiating the
weight of prosecution evidence produced for proving
arrest of the accused after the occurrence. Said
evidence can, therefore, be safely used for the purpose
of corroborating the eyewitness account.

15. So far as contention of learned counsel
for the appellants regarding acquittal of co-accused
namely Haider Zaman is concerned, we do not agree
with learned counsel for appellants that prosecution
was having same strength of evidence against the

convicted appellants and the respondent/ accused
namely Muhammad Liaqat and Abdul Qayyum.
Eyewitness account have no doubt been same in
respect of all accused but the difference was lying in
corroboration. In respect of the convicted appellants
namely Liaqat and Abdul Qayyum, the eyewitnesses
account was fully corroborated by their arrest
immediately after occurrence, recovery of weapons of
offence from accused Liagat at the time of his arrest
(and in case of appellant Abdul Qayyum, on his
pointation) and matching reports of FSL with the
empties recovered from the spot. The medico-legal
report of the injured was also lending support to
eyewitness account. In the case of acquitted accused
namely Haider Zaman, it is important to be noted that
he could not be arrested immediately after the
occurrence. The weapon of offence recovered on his
pointation was also in rusty condition. FSL report Ex
PW-16/12 though mentions that pistol in question was
found to be in working condition, however, there is no
report of its matching with empties recovered from the
spot. Moreover, no one having such enmity would use
rusty pistol and that also for killing his enemy close to

city center. The report of medical officer was also not
lending full support to eyewitness account to the
extent of this person because two persons had been
charged for making firing while deceased Kala Khan
had received single injury. Possibility of missing one
fire may not be ruled out but when there are two
probabilities, the probability favouring accused would
be preferred. Learned trial Court extended him benefit
of doubt, as a measure of abundant caution. This court
while reappraising evidence has got no reason to differ
with opinion of learned trial Court in this regard. So
far as argument of learned counsel for the appellants
regarding the principle “falsus in uno falsus in
omnibus”, as expounded by honourable Supreme
Court of Pakistan in its judgment reported as “PLD
2019 SC 527” is concerned, there is no cavil to such
proposition, but while acquitting Haider Zaman, he
had been extended benefit of doubt as a measure of
bundant caution. Said factum of his acquittal cannot
be dubbed as an affirmative proof of the fact that the
eyewitnesses have been untruthful.
16. This Court while giving its judgment in
the case of “Ayaz Gul Vs. The State” (Jail Criminal

Appeal No. 863-P/2019) had also held that giving
benefit of doubt to an accused cannot be construed in
all circumstances that the witnesses had been telling
lies. Relevant observations given in this regard are
reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

“True that initially four persons were charged
in the FIR but subsequently during the
preparation of the site plan as well as in the
cross examination of the PWs the role of the
accused has been distinguished. More-so, the
appellant/accused has also made confession
and the report of recovery of crime weapon
and empties recovered from the spot is also in
positive. The learned trial Court has rightly
acquitted the co-accused while extending
them the benefit of doubt by considering
overall circumstances of the case, whereas
convicted the present appellate Ayaz Gul. If
the Court extends the benefit of doubt to an
accused person it does not mean that the
witnesses are not truthful witnesses. The
prosecution has successfully proved its case
against appellant through the testimony of
injured witnesses and could not create
suspicion in establishing the presence of the
eyewitnesses on the spot as well as of the
appellant at the relevant time and their
credibility has not been shattered, however,
same would only show a_ reasonable
possibility in our mind that participation of
acquitted co-accused has not been duly

proved by the prosecution. At times, Court
extends benefit of doubt to some of accused as
an abundant caution that will not certainly
signify that the witnesses were not truthful. As
such this Court holds that the learned trial
Court has properly evaluated the prosecution
evidence brought on record by extending
benefit of doubt to acquitted co-accused and
rightly convicted and sentenced the appellant
Ayaz Gul. The acquittal of co-accused will not
entitled the appellant Ayaz Gul to outright

acquittal.”

Witnesses in this case were related to the
deceased and also inimical towards appellants because
of previous enmity, and therefore some corroboration
was required for relying their testimony. In the case of
convicted appellants, there had been very strong
corroboratory pieces of evidence against them as
discussed above, while in case of acquitted accused
namely Haider Zaman, corroboration of a similar
standard had not been available. In such circumstances
learned trial Court had rightly treated case of the
convicted appellants differently from that of the
acquitted accused (respondent in Cr. A No. 211-
A/2020).

17. In view of what is stated above it was

found that prosecution has proved guilt of the
appellants namely Muhammad Liagat and Abdul
Qayyum through cogent and confidence inspiring
evidence. The learned trial Court has rightly made
conviction and awarded sentences to them which
needs no interference by this Court and the conviction
and sentence awarded to the appellants are therefore,
maintained and the appeal is dismissed.

18. So far as criminal revision — for
enhancement of sentence bearing No. 43-A/2020 is
concerned, we have considered submissions of learned
counsel for petitioner in this respect but we are not
inclined to enhance the penalty awarded by learned
trial Court. Minor weaknesses in the case of
prosecution which could not be considered for
acquittal of the accused, may well be taken into
account for lesser punishment as held by the august
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Feroz Khan
Vs. The State” reported as 2002 SCMR 1999. In this
case also, the minor weaknesses highlighted by
learned counsel for the respondents/convicts were not
considerable for a case for acquittal, but same may
well be kept in the background, while opting for a

lesser sentence of life imprisonment. Sentence of life
20

imprisonment awarded to both appellants namely
Muhammad Liaqat and Abdul Qayyum does not
warrant a review in the instant Criminal Revision.
Same was also found divested of merits and is
accordingly dismissed. Similarly, connected criminal
appeal bearing No. 211-A/2020, filed by complainant
against acquittal of co-accused Haider Zaman, in view
of discussions made hereinabove, had also been found
divested of merits and same is also dismissed.

Heard and Announced on.
