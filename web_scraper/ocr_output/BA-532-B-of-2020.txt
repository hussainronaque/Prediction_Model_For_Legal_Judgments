SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- This order shall dispose of two
petitions for post arrest bail bearing Cr.M.BA. No.528-B of 2020
and Cr.M.BA. No.532 of 2020, as both have arisen from one and
the same FIR No.523 dated 17.11.2016, Under Sections
302/324/337-A(i)/337-F(i)(ii)/ 148/149 PPC, Police Station Domel,
District Bannu. Having failed to secure bail from the Court of
learned Additional Sessions Judge-III, Bannu, order dated
26.09.2020, the petitioners have approached this Court for their
release on post-arrest bail.

2. The prosecution story disclosed in the first information
report (F.LR), in brief, is that on 17.11.2016 at about 08:10 hours,
complainant Rasmal Khan, in injured condition, while present with
injured Zubair, Khurshid, Sikandar, and Faheemullah, made report at
Khalifa Gulnawaz Teaching Hospital, Bannu, to Niaz Muhammad

Khan A.S.H.O, to the effect that on the eventful day, he alongwith
-2-

above-named, injured was present in his bargain situated near Mohajir
Camp, when at about 09:00 hours, petitioner Sher Andaz Khan, armed
with pistol, and petitioner Sher Wali, armed with 12 bore double barrel
rifle, alongwith acquitted co-accused Muhammad Tahir, armed with
pistol, Sadiqur Rehman, Ihsanullah alias Mujram Khan, Muhammad
Nawaz and co-accused Gul Wali, Khushdil, all armed with
Kalashnikovs, arrived at the spot and launched assault on them, with
the butts of weapons, as a result whereof, Sikandar and Faheemullah
received injuries, on resistance of the complainant party, petitioners
and acquitted co-accused Tahir Khan resorted to firing, resultantly,
from the firing of the petitioner Sher Andaz Khan, complainant Ramsal
Khan got hit, whereas from the firing of accused acquitted co-accused
Muhammad Tahir Khan, Khurshid got hit, while from the firing of Sher
Wali petitioner, Zubair Khan sustained injuries. After commission of
the offence, the accused fled away from the spot. The complainant
alongwith other injured were taken to the hospital for treatment where
he lodged the report, which was further verified by Zubair Khan
(injured) and Khurshid Khan by affixing their signature and thumb
impression as riders of the report. Murasila was transmitted to the
Police Station where a case vide the captioned FIR was registered
against the accused. Subsequently, on 19.11.2016, injured Khurshid
Khan succumbed to his injuries. Motive for the offence was stated to be
a dispute over landed property.

3. The learned counsel for the parties, alongwith Asstt:
Advocate General where heard at length and with their valuable

assistance the record was gone through.

-3-

4. True, that in the incident, the complainant alongwith
another got injured whereas one Khurshid Khan lost his life, but
equally true that as many as eight accused were charged for the
occurrence where three out of them i.e. Muhammad Tahir, Sher Andaz
and Sher Wali were attributed effective role, whereas accused Sher
Andaz Khan was given the role of firing at injured/complainant
Ramsal, similarly, the role of firing at injured Zubair was attributed to
petitioner Sher Wali, whereas to the acquitted co-accused Muhammad
Tahir, at deceased Khurshid Khan, but besides them, five others were
also charged with different roles excluding the role of firing. The
record tells that after facing trial, the principal accused Muhammad
Tahir, who was charged for the murder of deceased Khurshid Khan
was acquitted of the charges alongwith other co-accused.

5. The record tells that the petitioner Sher Wali is charged
for causing firearm injury on the person of one Zubair, who received
the firearm injury on his thigh, whereas petitioner Sher Andaz Khan is
charged for causing firearm injury on the person of the complainant
Ramsal, which landed on his chest with no repetition of fire shots and it
is yet to be seen as to whether the petitioners are vicariously liable for
the murder of the deceased, as eight accused are charged for the alleged
assault, out of whom, three were charged for effective firing, as the
principal accused Muhammad Tahir alongwith others has been
acquitted of the charges, so the petitioners cannot be saddled with the
vicarious liability, rather their case is to be taken into consideration in
respect of the injury caused, as there is no repetition of fire shot and a

single injury is received by the injured, so their intention to commit the

-4-

murder is yet to be determined by the trial Court after recording pro
and contra evidence.

6. This Court cannot lose sight of the fact, that out of eight,
five accused have been acquitted of the charges, and the prosecution
evidence was disbelieved in totality regarding the presence of the
complainant Rasmal on the spot and the mode and manner of the
occurrence, so the benefit from acquittal of the co-accused can be
extended to the petitioner even at bail stage. This Court is conscious of
the fact that the acquittal of co-accused is no ground for release on bail
of the subsequently arrested accused, but every case has its own
peculiar circumstances. In case in hand, I do not feel hesitation to
extend the benefit to the petitioners even at bail stage, as held by
Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled Muhammad
Faisal Vs. The State and another (2020 SCMR 971).

7. It was vehemently argued that the petitioners remained
absconders for considerable long time and on this score alone, they are
disentitled to the concession of bail, but I do not see myself in
agreement with what the learned counsel submitted, as the abscondence
alone is not sufficient to disentitle an accused to the concession of bail
if he otherwise deserves the same on merit. This Court is conscious of
the fact that at bail stage, tentative assessment is to be made and that
deeper appreciation is not warranted, but bail applications cannot be
heard and decided in vacuum rather the Court should consider the
available record/material for the purpose. While assessing tentatively,
this Court reaches to a conclusion that the petitioners have been
succeeded in making out a case for bail as one of further inquiry,

Resultantly, both the petitions are allowed and the accused/petitioners

-5-

— are admitted to bail, subject to furnishing bail bonds amounting to
Rs. 200000/-(two lac) with two sureties, each in the like amount to the

satisfaction of Ilaqa Judicial Magistrate/ MOD concerned.

8. Above are the detailed reasons of my short orders of the
even date. i
