JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.-

Petitioner Muhammad Usman Raees, seeks bail

in case FiR No.103 dated 06.08.2015, registered

under section 462-C PPC, in Police Station FIA,

ACC, Peshawar.

2. Allegations against the petitioner are

that on 05.08.2015, Walid Khan Engineer (D)

SNGPL, alongwith FIA official, namely,

Asfandar and SNGPL Team, conducted a raid

on his factory known as “Khattak Chemicals”

situated at Sabir Abad and found the factory

consuming gas through an illegal direct line

connected with existing 8” dia gas min line,

hence, this case.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. It appears from the record that in

support of allegations levelled in the FIR,

neither initially the FIA officials nor

subsequently, the police have collected any

incriminating evidence. Nothing in black and

white has been brought on record in respect of

the alleged factory to be the ownership of the

petitioner. Similarly, the extension pipe line vide

the gas was being consumed by the petitioner

illegally from the mine pipe line has been taken

into possession. This court is conscious of the

fact that in such like offence, general public do

not stand witness against the others, therefore,

such cases are always built up through

incriminating evidence such as recoveries from

the spot. The FIA officials and the police has not

taken pain to collect any such incriminating

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

evidence so much so that no site plan has been

prepared. No proper report qua damage caused

by the petitioner to the Government Exchequer

has been assessed. Though a general assessment

report in respect of damage of entire year

keeping in view the alleged illegal consumption

of the petitioner has been prepared, but it has

not been clarified therein specifically as to how

much damage he has caused to the Public

Exchequer by the petitioner through illegal

connection. This court has taken serious notice

of the matter, that the law enforcing Agencies

are dealing such cases in a casual manner, which

ultimately results in acquittal of the offenders, as

cases are always decided on the basis of

evidence collected against the offenders. Thus

court cannot shut its eyes or to remain mum like

a silent spectator on the conduct of the

concemed authorities, whose negligence proves

loss to the Government Exchequer. The

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

concerned authorities of the SNGPL, FIA and

Police are, therefore, expected that in future in

cases of theft of electricity, gas, petroleum etc,

they shall be vigilant and shall leave no stone in

collecting the incriminating evidence in support

of the allegations in the FIR.

5. For the reason discussed above, the case

of the petitioner is arguable for the purpose of

bail. Besides, the applicability of S.462-C PPC,

in presence of S.25 (d) of Oil and Gas

Regulatory Authority Ordinance, 2002, which is

a Special law, is yet to be determined during

trial. S.462-C PPC provides punishment of

imprisonment for a term which may extend to

ten years but shall not be less than five years and

with fine which may extend to three million

rupees while punishment provided under section

25 (d) of the OGRA Ordinance, 2002, is

imprisonment which may extend to three years

or with fine or with both and it is settled law that

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

when an accused is charged under two different

statutes for the same offence, the offence having

lesser sentence is taken into consideration for

the purpose of bail, so on this ground too,

petitioner is entitled to concession of bail.

6. Resultantly, this petition is allowed.

Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided

he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of

Rs.3,00,000/- with two local and _ reliable

sureties each in the like amount to the

satisfaction of learned  TIllaqa Judicial

Magistrate/MOD, concerned.

The Additional Registrar (Judicial) of
this Court is directed to sent copy of this
judgment to the General Manager SNGDPL,
Director General FIA, and the Additional
Inspector General (Investigation), Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar for future guidance and
compliance.
