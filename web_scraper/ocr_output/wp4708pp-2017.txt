YAHYA AFRIDI, C.J.- Petitioner, seeks the
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court, praying
that:-

“It is, therefore, prayed that
directions be issued to :-

i, Respondents 1 to 3 to ensure
protection and security of
petitioner and her family so that
their lives are protected in
accordance with command of
the Constitution.

ii. Respondents 3 and 4 to submit
weekly progress report of the
investigation to the High Court
so as High Court can satisfy
itself that investigations are fair
and free from influence.

iii. | Respondents 3 and 4 to include
Rehmatullah son of Saeedullah
in the FIR as an accused adding
offence of making video in the
FIR and further directions to
police authorities to recover
video from the possession of
Rehmatullah or anyone else to
whom he might have been
handed over the same so as
misusing of video is avoided.

iv. Revenue authorities be directed
to suspend absconder Sajawal
Patwari.

v. Such other relief as may be
deemed proper.”

2. The respondents were put to notice, and
the worthy Inspector General of Police, Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa was directed to submit his response in
writing to the prayers sought in the instant petition.
The same was responded in terms that;

“Prayers:-

1. The first prayer of the petitioner is
not tenable as the respondents have
already provided security cover to
the complainant party. As pointed
out in reply to para-8 that security
has been provided to the
complainant party vide office order
No.27768 dated 02.11.2017 and
No.3293 dated 03.11.2017. Special
guards of 1-HC and 3-FC under the
supervision of Noorzali Khan
Inspector have been detailed for the
security of complainant party.
Therefore, prayer No.1 of petitioner
is infructuous.

2. The investigation is being monitor
and supervised on daily basis by the
senior officer. The accused are
produced before the Court on their
arrest and respondents are also
ready to submit progress report to
the Honourable High Court through
Registrar.

3. Necessary directions have been
issued to the investigation team to
conduct investigation with regard to
accusation of Rehmat Ullah and
recovery of the video from the
possession of Rehmat Ullah if any.
4. Under the law and rules a civil
servant when committed to judicial
lockup automatically _ becomes
suspended. Anyhow, necessary
departmental action will be also
ensured.

It is, therefore, prayed that the
petition of petitioner may be disposed of
as the same is premature at this stage,
not maintainable, without any merit,
substance, and force.”

3. When the worthy counsel for the
petitioner was confronted with the response of the
worthy Inspector General of Police, Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, he was satisfied with the efforts made
by the respondent-Government, and in particular,
the worthy Inspector General of Police, Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa and urged him to ensure that the
justice is not only done but shown to have been
carried out, without any bias, fear or discrimination.
4. No doubt, Courts, more particularly a
Constitutional Court, ought not to interfere in
investigation process, which is exclusively the
domain of the Investigation Agency, as provided
under the enabling provisions of Criminal Procedure
Code, 1898 (“Cr.P.C”). However, in the peculiar
circumstances of the case, this Court directs the
worthy Inspector General of Police, Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa to ensure that the investigation in the

instant case be carried out in a timely manner as
provided under the enabling provisions of Criminal
Procedure Code, 1898. And in particular, the
progress report of the investigation be submitted by
the worthy Inspector General of Police, Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa to the Director, Human Rights Cell,
Peshawar High Court, Peshawar, for the perusal of
the Chief Justice in his Chambers.

Accordingly, this writ petition is

disposed of, in the above terms.
