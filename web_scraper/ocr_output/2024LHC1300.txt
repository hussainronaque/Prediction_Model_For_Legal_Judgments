Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C was

2. Appellant has filed this Criminal Appeal against his
conviction and the trial Court has sent Murder Reference
for confirmation of his death sentence or otherwise, which
are being decided through this single judgment.

3. Heard. Record perused.

4. Barira Zahid aged about 13 years was done to death
at the hands of her Islamic teacher (appellant) in the
Baithak of her tutor Zahida Parveen’¥® when she was
teaching the students on 14.02.2022 at 4:00 p.m,
whereafter FIR was lodged on the same night at 08:35 p.m,
on the statement of her father Zahid Naseer?¥6/complainant
Appellant was apprehended red-handed at the spot with
“Churra.”

5. Anshra Zahid real sister of the deceased was with the
deceased at the time of occurrence and appeared before the
trial Court as PW-7 but it was declared by the trial Court
that she being a tender age is not a competent witness to
testify under Article 3 of the Qanun-Shahadat Order, 1984
and her statement was not recorded.

6. Zahida Parveen?” (tutor of the deceased) while appearing
before the trial Court stated in her statement that on
14.02.2022, she was in the Baithak of her house for
tuition, it was leave time, students were coming and going,
Barira Zahid (deceased) and her sister Anshra Zahid (discussed
above) Were sitting in front of her on mat, Adil Zaib (appetlant)
armed with Churra came there, she asked him as to why he
entered in the Baithak, appellant (adil zaib) told her to go
aside otherwise she would be killed, then he (appetiant)
caused injuries on the person of Barira Zahid (deceased) with
repeated blows of Churra, on hue and cry of her as well as
students present there, Mohalladars attracted there, Zahid

Naseer?W-6 and his brother Shahid Naseer (given up Pw) also
Murder Reference No.57 of 2022 &
Criminal Appeal No.699 of 2022

reached there to take their daughters back (anshra Zahid and
others) to their house, appellant was apprehended with
Churra at the spot by them.

7. Zahid Naseer?W® (real father of deceased) while reiterating
the abovesaid story before the trial Court further stated
that Adil Zaib (appeliant) had been teaching the Holy QUR’AN
to his daughters Anshra (discussed above), Barira Zahid
(deceased) and son (Mobiz Zahid) in his house at Maghrib time,
on 08.02.2022 Barira Zahid (deceased) told him that her
teacher (appellant) had a bad eye on her, when on the
following day i.e 09.02.2022, Adil Zaib (appellant) came to his
house at Maghrib time for teaching the Holy QUR’AN to her
daughters and son, he (Zahid Naseer™-*) told him that he
(appellant) has betrayed his trust and hurt him, then
appellant infuriated and went away while extending
threats. He further submits that appellant was
apprehended at the spot with blood stained “Churra”’ and
has been handed over to Muhammad Riaz, SIP¥-12 with
“Churrad’ on his arrival who while appearing before the trial
Court has supported this evidence.

8. Both the eye-witnesses (Zahid Naseer?W- and Zahida Parveen?™’)
have absolutely no grudge or ill-will to falsely implicate the
appellant in the present case. They were cross-examined at
length but their evidence could not be shaken during the
process of cross-examination. They have corroborated each
other on all material aspects of the case. They have also
established their presence at the time of occurrence at the
place of occurrence with their stated reasons. Their

evidence is straightforward, trustworthy, confidence

inspiring and cannot be discarded mere on probabilities.

9. The discrepancies in the statements of the PWs
pointed out by learned counsel for the appellant, are minor
and general in nature, occur in every case when witnesses

(who are human-beings) are cross-examined after a long time of
Murder Reference No.57 of 2022 &
Criminal Appeal No.699 of 2022

the occurrence as in present case, are not fatal to the
prosecution case.

10. The medical evidence has been furnished by Dr.
Musarrat Batool’”* who during post-mortem examination
on the dead body of Barira Zahid (deceased) observed 22-
injuries caused with sharp edged weapon on her person
attributed to Adil Zaib (appellant) which were ante-mortem in
nature and were sufficient to cause death in ordinary
course of nature, therefore, the medical evidence has fully
supported the ocular account discussed above.

11. Report (Exhpt) of PFSA shows that blood stained
Churra recovered from the possession of the appellant has
matched with DNA profile of Barira Zahid (deceased).

12. Appellant has denied his involvement in this case in
his statement recorded u/s 342 Cr.P.C. and stated that he
is innocent and has falsely been involved in this case. He
has neither opted to appear as witness u/s 340 (2) Cr.P.C.
nor produced any defence evidence except Exh.DA in
support of his defence plea which is neither plausible nor
believable and is discarded.

13. In view of the above discussion, we are of the view
that the prosecution has proved its case beyond shadow of
doubt against the appellant through the _ evidence
discussed earlier.

14. Coming to the quantum of sentence of the appellant
(adil Zaib), having considered all the pros and cons of the
case, an irresistible conclusion drawn by this Court is that
the appellant (Adil Zaib) being an Islamic teacher has
committed shocking and callous murder of his student
Barira Zahid aged about 13 years with repeated Churra
blows causing 22-injuries on her person, only to quench his
lust without her fault. We are unable to find any mitigating
circumstance in favour of appellant (Adil zaib) and are of the

considered view that there is no extenuating circumstance
Murder Reference No.57 of 2022 &
Criminal Appeal No.699 of 2022

in favour of the appellant for extending him any benefit with
regard to his sentence who does not deserve any leniency.

15. For the foregoing reasons, the convictions and
sentences of the appellant (adil zaib) awarded _by the trial
Court are maintained. The compensation, fine and sentence
in default thereof are also maintained. Resultantly,

Criminal Appeal filed by the appellant (adil Zaib) is

dismissed and death sentence awarded to him is

CONFIRMED. Murder Reference is answered in

AFFIRMATIVE.
