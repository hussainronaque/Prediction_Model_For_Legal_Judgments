of 520 grams of Amphetamine (Ice) from the shopping

bag.

4. Amphetamine / Ice is the latest and most —
lethal among the contrabands, which as against the other
narcotics like ‘charas’ is not possessed in maunds and
kilograms but in small quantity given the fact that it is by
far the most expensive contraband. However, its small
quantity has proved to have devastating effects on its
consumers, who mostly happen to be from the younger
generation including the school and college going students.
By that count, 520 grams of Amphetamine / Ice recovered
from the direct and immediate possession of the accused-
petitioner is a huge quantity in respect of which the FSL
report is also in the affirmative. Thus, the accused-
petitioner is prima facie connected with the commission of
the offence attracting the prohibitory limb of section 497
Cr.P.C. Hence, I hold him disentitled to the concession of

bail.

5. Resultantly, this bail _ petition stands
dismissed.

Announced.
Dated: 14.06.2021.
