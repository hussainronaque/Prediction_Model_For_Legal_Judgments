2. The occurrence relates to murders of
Mst. Bachazul Bakht, sister-in-law of the appellants,
and Lal Muhammad, her alleged paramour, who
were reported to have been done to death by the
appellants for their illicit relations after they were
found together in a room at night time. According to
the contents of the first information report, appellant
Muhammadullah proceeded to Police Station
Khurshid Khan Shaheed Khwaza Khela on

effect that he was present in his house while his
brother Sajid, husband of deceased Mst. Bachazul
Bakht, had gone to Punjab for earning his livelihood
whose house is situated over his house. It was further
stated in the report that he had sensed long ago that
his sister-in-law had illicit relations with his co-
villager Lal Muhammad, so, he was watchful at that
night when at 21:00 hours Lal Muhammad entered
the house of his brother for committing Zina, so, he
went behind him but found the door locked from

inside and tried to open it but could not succeed. At

after entering the room, caused blows with axe and
knife at head and body of his sister-in-law
Mst. Bachazul Bakht due to which she fell on the
ground. He found Lal Muhammad in a wooden box
which was opened and thereafter caused blows to
him with axe and knife as a result of which both died
on the spot whose dead bodies were lying there. He
next narrated that he left the axe and knife on the
spot and came to police station for giving
information of the occurrence after covering some

distance on foot and the remaining in a vehicle.

7. On 28.02.2012, Sahib Zada, father of
deceased Lal Muhammad, and Ismail, brother of
deceased Mst. Bachazul Bakht, recorded their 164,
Cr.P.C statements and charged Muhammadullah
alongwith his brother Hanifullah for committing
murders of the deceased. The former introduced the
last seen evidence by stating that appellant
Hanifullah had invited his son at the night of
occurrence who had gone with him to his house. He
further stated that he had a dispute with the
appellants over boundary of land and they had
threatened him for dire consequences in furtherance
of which the committed brutal murder of his son
alongwith their sister-in-law on the pretext of honor.
The latter disclosed in his statement that one year
prior to the occurrence his deceased sister had come
to his house and told his mother that the appellants
had bad intentions towards her. In view of the above
statements of the PWs, section 34 P.P.C was
inserted in the case and appellant Hanifullah was

also arrested on 28.02.2012.

8. After completion of investigation,
complete challan was submitted in Court whereafter

the appellants were tried in due course. Prosecution

examined ten PWs in all mentioned in the calendar
of witnesses and therafter the appellants were
examined under Section 342, Cr.P.C. They pleaded
to be innocent and stated to have been falsely
charged. Appellant Muhammadullah denied to have
reported the matter; he alleged that he being
illiterate, the F.I.R has wrongly been attributed to
him. Appellant Muhammadullah recorded his
statement on oath within the meaning of Section
340(2), Cr.P.C while appellant Hanifullah did not do
so. They felt no need of producing evidence in their
defence. The learned trial Court, after hearing the
arguments, convicted and sentenced the appellants
vide judgment dated 22.01.2014, the detail of
sentences has already been mentioned. Hence, this

appeal.

9. Learned counsel for the appellant, inter
alia, contended that F.LR is not a substantive piece
of evidence and its contents could neither be used
against an accused making it nor his co-accused
unless same were proved in Court by its maker by
subjecting him to the test of cross-examination;
since, the F.I.R in the present case has not been

proved through the alleged lodger thereof even he

Mr. Justice ishtiag Ibrahim:

{Cr.A No. 21-M of 2014 Muhommadulish and one other Vs. The State}

has denied to have registered the same, therefore,
conviction of the appellants on this ground is illegal.
He further contended that the appellants have been
charged in this case after 13/14 days of the
occurrence and no plausible explanation has been
given by prosecution in this regard, as such, the
delay is fatal to prosecution case and credibility of
the witnesses has become highly suspicious. He also
argued that mere recovery of the dead bodies from
the house of the appellant’s brother is not a valid
ground for their conviction most particularly when
the prosecution case mainly depends upon weak
type of circumstantial evidence. The learned counsel
was of the opinion that recovery of crime weapon
Kalashnikov on the alleged pointation of one of the
appellant is doubtful. They added that there is
disparity between medical report of deceased Lal
Muhammad and the contents of F.I-R, which negates
the prosecution version. It was further argued that
the last seen evidence introduced by prosecution at a
belated stage has no evidentiary value and the trial
Court, while relying upon such evidence, has not
considered the fundamental principles laid down by

superior Courts; that the extra judicial confession is

not admissible in evidence, it can neither be proved
in terms of Article 39 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order
nor it is sufficient for recording conviction unless it
is strongly corroborated by tangible evidence
coming from unimpeachable source which is not
available in the present case. He next argued that the
occurrence is unwitnessed and the prosecution case
mainly rests on circumstantial evidence, so, the trial
Court was duty bound to analyze it with due care
and caution which has not been employed in the
present case. He finally submitted that the impugned
judgment is the result of wrong appreciation of the
prosecution evidence, therefore, the same be set
aside and the appellant be acquitted of the charge.

He placed reliance on the following judgments.

10. As against that learned counsel for
Respondent No. 2 contended that F.LR, being a
public document and relevant, is admissible in
evidence without any further proof. He submitted
that first information report made by accused as
complainant is admissible in evidence against him
and findings of the learned trial Court to this effect
are in accordance with law and settled principles.
Referring to the disparity between F.I.R and medical
report, the learned counsel stressed that object of the
F.LR is to set the law into motion and each and
every detail is not necessary to be given therein,
therefore, the prosecution story given in the F.LR is
either to be believed or disbelieved but it cannot be
accepted partly; since the contents of the F.ILR, more
or less, stand proved in light of the strong
circumstantial evidence, therefore, the same are to
be taken as a whole against both the appellants,
which has rightly been done by learned trial Court
by outweighing the minor contradictions. He argued
that F.LR recorded in consequence of receipt of
information has an evidentiary value; it may be used
for the purpose of contradiction under Article 140

and for the purpose of corroboration under Article

153 the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order, 1984. The learned
counsel added that common intention of the
appellants can easily be inferred from facts and
circumstances of the present case from which it is
abundantly clear that both the appellants committed
the double murders in furtherance of their common
intention. He next argued that prosecution has
proved its case against the appellants beyond
reasonable doubt, the appellants should have been
punished according to the nature and gravity of the
offence committed. He further contended that
appellant Muhammaduliah has disclosed a strong
motive behind the occurrence in the F.LR and
recovery of the dead bodies from the same place
further strengthens the fact that the murders were
committed by appellants on the pretext of honour,
hence, their conviction by the trial Court is
according to the evidence available on record.
Learned counsel lastly submitted that in light of the
contents of F.LLR, recovery of crime weapons i.e axe,
knife and Kalashnikov, last seen evidence of PW-1,
recovery of the dead bodies from the spot and
medical reports of the deceased, being inter

connected and consistent, duly establish the guilt of

dismissed. Learned counsel representing the State
supported the arguments of learned counsel for

il. We have heard the arguments and gone
through the record in light of the valuable of

assistance of learned counsel for the parties.

12. The most debated point in the case is
that as to whether F.I.R lodged by an accused can be
taken into account against him or not. Case of the
prosecution is that appellant Muhammadullah
committed murders of his sister-in-law Mst.

Bachazul Bakht and Lal Muhammad for the alleged

illicit relations between them and their union for the
purpose of zina at that particular night; thereafter he
went to police station and admitted his guilt by
making report of the occurrence. Before making
discussion on the point of admissibility of F.LR as
evidence or otherwise, first we would see as to
whether or not the F.I.R can be attributed to
appellant Muhammadullah in light of the prevailing
circumstances of the ase. The F.I.R was lodged on
15.02.2012. He was produced before Judicial
Magistrate on 16.02.2012 and vide application
Ex.PW-6/21 his custody for seven days was sought
which was allowed and four days custody in favour
appellant Muhammadullah was allowed on the same
date. Question arises that when the appellant
proceeded to police station of his own and lodged
the report by admitting his guilt, as alleged by
prosecution, then why the need for his further
custody was sought instead of making a request to
the Court for recording his judicial confession.
Again when the appellant was produced before the
Judicial Magistrate on 20.02.2012, he refused to
confess his guilt. Prosecution has brought nothing on

the record to show that the appellant was tutored by

Tajamul/Ps*

DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Younls Thaheem
Mr, Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

{Cr.A No. 21-M of 2014 Muhammadutiah and one other Vs. The State}
-16-
his counsel or any other person for not recording his
judicial confession. Keeping in view the absence of
any such proof and the mode and manner of his
production before the Judicial Magistrate coupled
with his statement on oath, how can we hold that the
F.I.R was lodged by appellant Muhammadullah by

making a voluntary confession before the police.

13. Now coming to the point under
consideration. It is well settled that F.I.R by itself is
not a substantive piece of evidence unless its
contents are affirmed on oath and the maker thereof
is subjected to the test of cross-examination.
Registration of F.LR at the instance of accused is a
confession before police which being extra-judicial
in nature, is not admissible in evidence against him
according to Article 38 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat

Order, 1984 which reads as:-

“38. confession to police officer not to be
proved. No confession made to a police officer
shall be proved as against a person accused of
any offence”.

In the present case, the learned trial
Court has based conviction of the appellants mainly
on the F.I.R lodged by one of them and the last seen

evidence, the evidentiary value whereof will be

Mr. Justice tehtiag Ibrahim

(CA No, 21-M of 2014 Muhammoduligh and one other Vs. The State)
-17-
discussed later on in this judgment. In view of
various provisions of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order,
the status of the F.LR lodged by accused is that of
his previous statement, therefore, cannot be made a
basis for his conviction. Wisdom is derived from the
judgment in the case titled “Muhammad Saleh Vs.

The State” (PLD 1965 Supreme Court 366) wherein
it has been held that:-

“Muhammad Saleh himself went to the Police
Station to report the matter, What he said was
recorded at 11-30 a.m. on the 26th February.
That statement was inadmissible evidence on

account of its inculpatory nature”.

The august Supreme Court while
deciding the case of “Muhammad Bakhsh Vs. The
State” (PLD 1956 Supreme Court (Pak.) 420,
confirmed the observations of High Court whereby
report made by accused was excluded from

consideration. The Hon’ble apex Court held that:-

“Mr. Mehmud who has opposed the appeal
admits that the report made by the appellant
at the Police Station was rightly excluded by
the High court but he contends that the
judicial confession though on oath was

admissible ........ ”

First information report is a previous
statement of accused in view of Articles 140 and
153 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat which can be used for
contradicting its maker but unless it is proved in
accordance with the above provisions of law, it
cannot be given the status of evidence, as such,
cannot be considered as a proof of its contents
mentioned therein by its maker. In this regard we

would refer the judgment of Supreme Court of India

reported as “Nasar Ali Vs. The State of
Utarpardesh” (AIR 1957 S.C _366) wherein it has

been laid down that:

“A first information report is not a
substantive piece of evidence and can only
be used to corroborate the statement of the
maker under s. I57 of the Evidence Act or
to contradict it under S. 145 of that Act. It
cannot be used as evidence against the maker
at the trial if he himself becomes an accused,
nor to corroborate or contradict other
witnesses. It is a cardinal principle of criminal
jurisprudence that the innocence of an
accused person is presumed till otherwise
proved. It is the duty of the prosecution to
prove the guilt of the accused subject to any
statutory exception”.

First Information Report _ basically

covers the information regarding a cognizable

offence given to officer incharge of a police station
the purpose of which is to set the law in motion for
conducting investigation in the case. It is not a
substantive piece of evidence unless the maker
himself deposes in Court to confirm the contents of
the F.LR entered therein at his behest. Keeping in
view the above status of the F.I.R, this document by
itself cannot advance the prosecution case except it
is recorded by a person who is near to die which is
commonly known as dying declaration but that is
also admissible in evidence under certain principles
laid down by superior Courts. The august Supreme
Court of Pakistan in its judgment in the case titled

“Ghaus Muhammad alias Ghausa and another Vs.

the State” (1979 SCMR 155) held that:-

“The maker of the F. I. R. has died. It cannot
be used as corroboration of the testimony of
another person, namely Nur Muhammad P.
W. At best the prosecution can use it for
showing that the name of Nur Muhammad is
mentioned in the F. I. R. but that by itself

would not advance the prosecution case”.

In light of various provisions of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 mentioned earlier
and the above referred dicta of the Superior Courts,

we reach to the conclusion that the F.LR lodged by

Tajamnuyes*|

Mi. Justice tshitiag (brahim

{CA No. 21-0 of 2014 Muhammadulich and one other Vs. The State}
-20-
the appellant Muhammadullah cannot be used
against him as evidence in view of the prevailing
circumstances of this case. The undue weight
attributed to the F.I.R by the learned trial Court has

no legal justification.

Learned counsel for the complainant
during his arguments mainly relied on the judgment
rendered in the case titled “Muhammad Khan Vs.
Dost_Muhammad_and_17 others” (PLD 1975
Supreme Court 607) and contended that first
information report can be used as an admission
against a person on whole instance it was registered.
We would not subscribe to the above submission of
the learned counsel as the facts and circumstances
forming background of the referred judgment of the
Hon’ble apex Court are different from the present
one. There was purportedly a cross version of that
case the report of which had been lodged by the
convict earlier in time, which is not the situation
here in this case. Even the judgment of the Privy
Council (AIR _1939 P.C 47) relied upon by counsel
for the convict in that case was distinguished by the
Hon’ble apex Court mainly on the ground that it was

not a case of F.I.R registered in a cross case. It

would be proper to reproduce the observations
recorded by the august Supreme Court in the case of
Muhammad Khan supra to further elucidate our

point of view.

“On the merits of the objection, the first limb
of the argument is without substance. The
Privy Council case proceeded on entirely
different facts. It was not a case of an F. I. R.
being registered in the cross-case. The short
question, which in so far as it is relevant to
this case, was whether the statement made
before the Police, during the investigation of a
case, by a person who had not till then joined
the investigation as accused, can subsequently
be proved by the prosecution against him as
his admission, in the same case. The
prosecution in that case sought to prove an
admission by the accused on the plea that the
expression, "the person" in section 162, Cr. P.
C. refers to a person, other than an accused or
a potential accused and that therefore any
admission (as distinguished from downright
confession of guilt) made by an accused or a
potential accused is provable against him. The
argument was rejected, and their Lordships
came to the conclusion that such "statement is
not admissible even when made by the person

ultimately accuser".
To sum up, the learned trial Court has
illegally taken into account the F.LR against
appellant Muhammadullah who allegedly made the

report. Next is the question that whether it can be

used against the co-appellant Hanifullah or not.

Admittedly, he is not nominated in the F.LR by co-
accused Muhammadullah and was charged by
relatives of both the deceased in their 164, Cr.P.C
statements recorded at a belated stage, therefore,
there arise no question of taking into account the

F.LR against the co-appellant Hanifullah.

14. Record transpires that the occurrence
took place on 15.02.2012 while the appellants were
charged on 28.02.2012. Sahib Zada (PW-1), father
of the deceased Lal Muhammad introduced last seen
evidence while recording his 164, Cr.P.C statement
on 14" day of the occurrence wherein he stated that
on the night of occurrence, he and his son Lal
Muhammad had gone to mosque of Degan Lakhar
for offering Isha prayers; after the prayers he came
back to his house while deceased Lal Muhammad
stayed there for recitation of the Holy Quran. When
the deceased came to his house, he told him (his
father) that Hanifullah had invited him for a feast; in
the meanwhile Hanifullah called his son, in response
whereof the deceased went with him. He further
stated that on the next day he came to know that his
son had been done to death. PW-2 Ismail, brother of

deceased Bachazul Bakht also recorded his

statement and charged both the appellants for the
murder of his sister. Before discussing credibility of
the said witnesses, first we would discuss the delay
caused in recording the statements of the PWs and
its legal repercussions on the prosecution case. No
plausible explanation has been given by prosecution
as why the statements of PWs were recorded at such
a belated stage which would definitely affect the
credibility of the witnesses in the circumstances of
the present case, hence, they could not be safely
relied upon for conviction of the appellant. Wisdom

is derived from the judgment in the case titled

“Rahat_Ali Vs. The State” (2017 _SCMR_584)

wherein it is held that:-

“9, The story narrated by P.W.2 that after
the abduction he went to sleep in the house
also does not seem to be true because in such
a situation he could not have gone to sleep
when his parents were abducted. His natural
and immediate conduct would have been to
go to his uncle or to his mother who was
first wife of deceased to inform her about
the incident. Thus there is inordinate delay
of silence of P.W.2 which creates doubt
about his veracity. Delay of 24 hours, 4 days
and 15/20 days in reporting the matter to
the police or recording the statement of
witnesses by the police has been found

adversely affecting the veracity of witnesses

The State PLD 1960 SC 223, Sahib Gul v.
Ziarat Gul 1976 SCMR 236 and Muhammad
Iqbal v. State 1984 SCMR 930, respectively.
It has also been observed by this Court that
delay in recording the statement without
furnishing any plausible explanation is also
fatal to the prosecution case and the
statement of such witness was not relied
upon in the case of Syed Muhammad Shah
v. State 1993 SCMR 550. Therefore, the
evidence of P.W.2 is coming within the scope
of above rules laid down by this Court.
Hence, his statement cannot be safely relied
upon in the peculiar facts and circumstances

of the present case”,

In a recent judgment rendered in the

case of “Muhammad Asif Vs. The State” (2017
SCMR 486) the Hon’ble apex Court held the same

view by observing that:

te veneeees, Again there is another doubtful
aspect of the case because Nazar Hussain
(PW-9), the father of the deceased who
according to the FIR was stated to be
guarding the dead body, on arrival of the local
police to the spot, however, in the very
examination in chief at page/20 of the paper
book he has squarely stated that he joined the
investigation after one month and one day
after the occurrence. There is a long line of
authorities/precedents of this court and the
High Courts that even one or two days
unexplained delay in recording the statement

of eye-witnesses would be fatal and testimony

of such witnesses cannot be safely relied

upon”.

In view of the principles laid down in
the above referred judgments, the silence of the PWs
for 13/14 days of the occurrence is a striking aspect
of this case which has been overlooked by the
learned trial Court while recording conviction of the

appellants.

IS. PW-1 Sahib Zada has introduced the
last seen evidence in this case against co-appellant
Hanifullah. While describing the motive in his
statement, PW-1 stated that he had a dispute with the
appellants over the boundary line of land and they
had threatened him for dire consequences. The
relevant portion of his statement is as under:-

When the appellants had allegedly

PW-1, departure of the deceased at night time with

ridiculous. It appears that PW-1 introduced another

story of invitation of the deceased by appellant
Hanifullah which neither stands to reason nor
properly fits in the story set up by prosecution. The
fact that statement of PW-1 was recorded with a
considerable delay without any explanation, we do
not find ourselves in the position to believe it in utter
disregard of the well-recognized principles for
appreciation of evidence. While deciding the case of
“Fayyaz Ahmad Vs. The State” (2017 SCMR 2026),
the august Supreme Court laid down certain
fundamental principles for guidance of the Courts
while deciding cases based on the last seen evidence.
Some of the principles befitting the circumstances of

this case are reproduced below.

“(vi) Quick reporting of the matter without
any undue delay was essential, otherwise the
prosecution story would become doubtful for
the reason that the last seen evidence was
tailored or designed falsely to involve the
accused person.

(vii) Last seen evidence must be
corroborated by independent evidence,
coming from an unimpeachable source
because uncorroborated last seen evidence
was a weak type of evidence in cases involving
capital punishment.

In the present case, neither the last seen
evidence has been reported in time nor it gets

corroboration from an unimpeachable and

independent source; therefore, the same is of no

avail to prosecution.

16. In addition to above, the story set up in
the F.LR does not stand to reason. It is mentioned
therein that deceased Lal Muhammad entered the
house of Mst. Bachazul Bakht at 21:00 hours while
appellant Muhammadullah was watching him; he
tried to open the door but it was locked from inside
and thereafter broke the door with axe at 00:30
hours. Question arises that for what purpose the
appellant waited for three and half hours in the
intense cold at night time when finally his intention
was to break the door with axe. This infirmity in the
F.I.R has not been explained by prosecution. In
addition to above, there is also inconsistency
between post-mortem report of deceased Lal
Muhammad and contents of the F.I-.R. There is no
mention in the F.ILR regarding use of fire arms in the
occurrence but the doctor found fire arm injuries of
the dead body of deceased Lal Muhammad. This is
another glaring contradiction in the prosecution case
which pricks our judicial mind qua the guilt of
appellants independently as well as under their

alleged common intention.

17. It is also the version of prosecution that
when appellant Muhammadullah came to police
station his dress and boots were stained with blood.
Although, the F.S.L report regarding the said articles
is positive for human blood but it has not been
clarified that the group thereof matched with the
group of both of the deceased or not. In other words
prosecution has not established that the dress and
shoes of appellant Muhammadullah were stained
with the blood of deceased. This clarification was
utmost necessary in view of the peculiar facts and
circumstances of the occurrence which has not been
done. If we presume that his dress was stained with
the blood of deceased even then this may happen by
lifting the dead bodies after the occurrence without
his involvement in the murders. In the view of this
Court, the mere fact that dress and shoes of the
appellant were stained with human blood is not
sufficient to prove that he committed the murders of

the deceased.

I8. Admittedly, the occurrence is
unwitnessed one and the prosecution case mainly
depends upon the last seen evidence which has been

disbelieved by this Court vide the discussion in the

preceding paras. Next is the circumstantial evidence
of the case but the same is also not sufficient to
prove the appellants guilty of the charge.
Prosecution was duty bound to establish its case
against the appellant by providing all links in
unbroken chain, which are not available in the
present case. Mere the fact that the dead bodies were
recovered from the house of Sajid, brother of the
appellants, cannot be considered enough for holding
the appellants responsible for the murders they are
charged with. So is the recovery of axe, knife and
Kalashnikov, which were allegedly presented by co-
appellant Hanifullah but on the alleged pointation of
appellant Muhammadullah. When we look into the
contents of the F.L.R in light of the last seen
evidence, the prosecution case appears to be quite
doubtful and ambiguous. Record also shows that all
the marginal witnesses to the recovery memos are
police officials and no private witness has been
associated with the investigation. How was it
possible that a single independent witness was not
available at the time of investigation though other
houses are situated near the place of occurrence nor

the police bothered to record statements of the other

inmates of the house including the children of
deceased lady. We are conscious of the fact that
people normally refrain from indulging in the
matters of Courts and police stations but still no
signs appear in the case to show that the
investigating agency tried its level best but could not
succeed. It appears that police handled the case quite
in a mechanical manner and looking into the matter
in view of the mode of investigation conducted in
the case, it may be inferred that the FIR was
attributed to appellant Muhammadullah against his
will or taking advantage of his illiteracy. Thus, it is
held that the prosecution case rests on very weak
circumstantial evidence which cannot be considered
randomly for conviction of the appellant. In this
regard we would again refer the case of Fayyaz
Ahmad supra (2017 SCMR_ 2026) wherein it has

been held that:-

5. To believe or rely on circumstantial
evidence, the well settled and deeply
entrenched principle is that it is imperative
for the Prosecution to provide all links in
chain an unbroken one, where one end of the
same touches the dead body and the other the
neck of the accused. The present case is of
such a nature where many links are missing in

the chain.

To carry conviction on a capital charge
it is essential that courts have to deeply
scrutinize the circumstantial evidence because
fabricating of such evidence is not uncommon
as we have noticed in some cases thus, very
minute and narrow examination of the same is
necessary to secure the ends of justice and
that the Prosecution has to establish the case
beyond all reasonable doubts, resting on
circumstantial evidence. "Reasonable Doubt"
does not mean apy doubt but it must be
accompanied by such reasons, sufficient to
persuade a judicial mind for placing reliance
on it. If it is short of such standard, it is better
to discard the same so that an innocent person
might not be sent to gallows. To draw an
inference of guilt from such evidence, the
Court has to apply its judicial mind with deep
thought and with extra care and caution and
whenever there are one or some indications,
showing the design of the Prosecution of
manufacturing and preparation of a case, the
Courts have to show reluctance to believe it
unless it is judicially satisfied about the guilt
of accused person and the required chain is
made out without any missing link, otherwise
at random reliance on such evidence would

result in failure of justice.

Undoubtedly, the F.I-R is based on the
alleged statement of appellant Muhammadullah
before the police tendirg to incriminate him for the
murders, which is inadmissible under Article 38 of
the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 which has

already been reproduced herein above. The use of

firearms in the occurrence but non-mentioning
thereof in the F.LR coupled with recovery of
Kalashnikov on the alleged pointation of appellant
Muhammadullah from the co-appellant, non-
association of independent and natural witnesses
with the investigation and the last seen evidence are
the factors in this case which do not form a link to
connect the appellants with the offences they are
charged with. In this regard we would refer the
judgment of this Court in the case titled

“Muhammadullah Vs. The State” (PLD 2001

Peshawar 132” wherein it has been held that:-

“Appreciation of evidence ---F.I.R. was based
on the statement made by the accused before
the police tending to incriminate him with the
offence charged with, which was inadmissible
in evidence by virtue of Art. 38 of Qanun-e-
Shahadat, 1984-- Discovery of the house at the
instance of the accused where the dead body
was found could prove nothing but his
knowledge about the place of occurrence---
Recovery of shot gun from the possession of
accused and empties from the spot as well as
positive report of the Ballistic Expert might,
at their best prove the use of the shot gun in
the commission of the crime, but in no manner
could prove that the same had been used by
the accused in the commission of the offence---
Even otherwise, Ballistic report had no value
as the shot gun and the empties had been
despatched to the Ballistic Expert after a
delay of one month---Necessary witnesses
having not been examined in the case either
during the investigation or in the Court, tile
story about the motive for the occurrence
appeared to be false and fictional---Neither
any direct evidence was forthcoming to
connect the accused with the crime, nor any
circumstantial evidence incompatible with his

deceased have been recovered from the house of
brother of appellants which is situated adjacent to
their house, but this fact is not sufficient to establish
that the murders were committed by them either
under their common intention or by any one of them

through solid evidence. Wisdom is derived from the

his deadbody had been found in the house of

many other members of the appellant's
family. It is not disputed that the murder in
issue had remained unwitnessed. The motive
set up by the prosecution had been disbelieved
and ruled out of consideration by the trial
court and the only circumstance relied upon

of the appellant and, hence, it was concluded
by the courts below that it must be none other
than the present appellant who had done the
deceased to death. We have found such an
approach adopted by the courts below to be
nothing but speculative. It is trite that
suspicion howsoever grave or strong can
never be a proper substitute for proof beyond
treasonable doubt required in a criminal case.
The house in issue was admittedly inhabited
by many other members of the appellant's
family. The role played by the appellant in the
incident in issue had never become available
on the record and it had never been disclosed
or alleged by the prosecution as to under what
circumstances the deceased had been done to
death. It has, thus, surprised us to learn that
not only the trial court but also the High
Court had concluded that the prosecution had
proved its case against the appellant beyond
reasonable doubt. We expect the courts below
to do better in future”.

20. Notwithstanding with the fact whether it
is a case of honour killing or simple murder, it is the
duty of prosecution to establish the case beyond
shadow of doubt against the accused by adducing
unimpeachable evidence otherwise the Court is left
with no other option but to extend the benefit of
doubt to him. The mere fact that it was the
occurrence of honour killing and the case was of
higher intensity should not be the considerations for

Courts for convicting an accused rather the material

according to settled principles. In other words, the
rule for appraisal of evidence in ordinary cases and
the cases of honour killing should be one and the
same and appreciation of evidence with a different
yardstick on the ground that it is a case of honour
killing, would not be just and fair. The Courts are
required to appraise the evidence according to the
settled principles for arriving at a just and fair

conclusion.

21. As a sequel of our above discussion,
this appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment is set
aside and the appellants are acquitted of the charge
