5. Learned counsel for the Petitioner

referred to PLD 2017 Supreme Court _733

“Muhammad _Tanveer V/S The State and

another, 2011 SCMR 1708 “ Riaz Jafar Natig
V/S_ Muhammad _ Nadeem Dar _and_others”,
unreported judgments of this Court rendered
in_Cr.M_ B.A. No. 199-M of 2017 decided on
24.5.2017 titled as “ Inamullah V/S The State

Note 34 (Peshawar) “Haji Sardar Ali V/S Yar
Muhammad and another”. In the light of these
dictums of the Hon'ble superior Courts prayed
for the grant of bail. Inversely, learned counsel

for the complainant assisted by learned Astt:

™ Advocate General for the State placed reliance

on 2016 MLD 1450 (Peshawar) “ Imran Khan
Orakzai V/S_The State and another”, 2013 P
Cr.LJ_1022 (Lahore) “Sardar _Muhammad

and 2012 MLD 799 (Peshawar) “ Wajid Aman
V/S' The State and_another” thereby prayed for

utter dismissal of the bail petition.

6. It appears from the record that
though the accused/Petitioner has been directly
charged for issuance of bogus cheques
dishonestly to the complainant for huge amount
of Rs. 4,70,000/- and Rs.900,000 respectively,
however, from the available record it divulges
that he was mainly refused the concession of
bail on the ground of his previous involvement
in alike nature of offences. Without being
prejudice to the merits of the case lest it may
affect claims of each party, suffice it to say, that
it has been held in plethora of judgments by the
Hon’ble superior Courts that the offence under
section 489-F PPC provides a maximum
punishment of three years and it does not fall

within the prohibitory clause of section 497 (1)

Cr. P.C, and when an accused was behind the
bars for sufficient length of time. Investigation
in the case was complete, inasmuch as charge
has been framed against an accused and such an
accused was no more required by police for
further proceedings. Then, such an accused was
granted bail, even in previous cases an accused
whose bail bonds have been forfeited, where
there is a case of further inquiry and the accused
making a case for bail on merits. Similar view
has already been taken for the grant of bail even
despite involvement of the accused/Petitioner in
other cases of alike nature, particularly, when
there is no previous conviction, mere
implication in other criminal cases will not stand
as hurdle in the way of releasing of an

accused/Petitioner on bail. In context of the present

case, though the prosecution placed on record

tories of certain FIRs which were registered

against accused/Petitioner Muhammad Shoaib but
the record is silent as to whether the
accused/Petitioner has been convicted and

sentenced in the above-referred cases or otherwise.

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
a

Ts The most recent view of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan in Criminal Appeal No.
273 of 2017 has altogether formed a distinct view
that for the offence when an accused has been
charged does not attract the prohibitory clause,
there can be no strong reason to withhold the
concession of bail, as grant of bail in such like

cases is a rule and refusal is an exception.

8. Moreover, as per version of the
complainant, these cheques have been issued to him
by the accused/Petitioner in respect of his
outstanding amount and in between the parties
there existed a joint property business. Thus, in
view whereof, prima facie the matter appears to be

civil in nature.

9. Learned counsel for the complainant

and learned Astt: Advocate General put a query

po by the Court as to whether there are any
oo

exceptions existed in the case, in view whereof
bail could be refused to the accused/Petitioner,
they though argued the case at considerable

length but could not pin-point any such exception.

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
10. In view of the above, the Petitioner at
this juncture is entitled to the concession of bail,
hence, he is asked to furnish bail bonds in the
sum of Rs. 200,000/- (Rupees two lacs) with two
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction
of learned Trial Court, who shall ensure that the

sureties are local, reliable and men of means.

11. Before parting with this judgment, it
is pertinent to mention here that the observations
made above are purely tentative in nature and

should in no way prejudice the case of either

party during trial. if
