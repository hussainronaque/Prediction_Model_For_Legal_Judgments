JUDGMENT
Date of Hearing 27.02.2018
Appellant (Mehtab) by Mr. Shad Muhammad Khan,
Advocate.
Respondent (State) by Sardar Muhammad Asif
Asstt: AG.

SYED ARSHAD ALI, J:- Appellant-convict Mehtab
S/o Ayub has filed instant appeal against the
conviction and sentence passed against him by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-II, Abbottabad,
vide judgment dated 05.06.2015 in case FIR No. 1057
dated 17.09.2013 under Section 13 AO of Police
Station Cantt: Abbottabad, whereby the appellant-
convict was convicted under Section 13 of the Arms
Ordinance and sentenced to suffer one year SI. He was
further ordered to pay Rs. 2000/- as fine or in default

of payment of fine, he shall further suffer fifteen days

simple imprisonment. Benefit of Section 382-B
Cr.P.C. was extended to him.

2. The case vide FIR No. 1057 dated
17.09.2013 was registered under Section 302 PPC on
the basis of Murasila, whereby the incident of murder
of deceased Muhammad Azhar was reported by
present appellant. Later, during course of
investigation, the present petitioner was found to be
the culprit and was thus arrayed as accused in the main
case. During investigation in the main case, on
17.09.2013, the investigating officer recovered one 30
bore pistol bearing NO. 101630 lying in front of the
window of room, where the murder of deceased was
committed. Later, the father of the appellant produced
license of the recovered pistol and the appellant also
confessed his guilt before the learned Judicial
Magistrate, by stating that he had fired at the deceased
with the said pistol, Hence, he was also charged under
Section 13 AO and separate challan was submitted
against him.

3. The prosecution produced six PWs in
order to prove its charge under Section 13 AO against

the accused. Thereafter, statement of the appellant-
Peshaver dig OF Atd. Bench
lAuthorized Under Se:/'5 Evid Ordns‘};

convict was recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C. In his
statement under Section 342 Cr.P.C. the appellant-
convict professed innocence and claimed that he was
falsely charged.

5. After hearing arguments of learned

- counsel for the parties, the learned trial Court

convicted the accused under Section 13 of the Arms
Ordinance and sentenced him to undergo SI for one
year and to pay fine of Rs. 2000/-, in default whereof
to further undergo simple imprisonment for fifteen

days. Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C. was extended

to him.
6. Arguments head and record perused.
7. The pistol in question has not been shown

to have been recovered from the personal possession
of the appellant-convict, nor upon his pointation,
however, the fact that the said pistol was recovered
from front of window of room of the hostel where
appellant-convict and deceased were present on the
relevant night, has sufficiently been proved. The
prosecution also successfully proved that the said
pistol was used by the appellant-convict in the

commission of murder of the deceased through
recovery of license of the pistol from the father of
appellant-convict and positive report of Firearms
Expert.

8. The PWs were subjected to lengthy cross
examination, however, no material contradiction could
be brought on record to shatter their credibility. Indeed
the prosecution successfully proved its case against the
appellant-convict, beyond any shadow of doubt. The
learned trial Court correctly appreciated the
prosecution evidence and has rightly convicted the
appellant-convict. No illegality or irregularity could be
pointed out in the impugned judgment and sentence
passed by the learned trial Court warranting
interference by this Court.

9. Resultantly, we are not inclined to
interfere with the impugned conviction and sentence
passed by the learned trial Court. The appeal in hand,

being bereft of any merits, stands dismissed.

Announced.
