JUDGMENT

Dr. Khurshid Iqbal, J.-

1. By this single opinion, I propose to
dispose of the above captioned two Quashment
Petitions (QPs). The reason is that they pertain to
the custody of one vehicle (a 1996 model Toyota
car, locally called “ghwagai”; hereafter “vehicle in
question) between the same parties and their
respective applications, having been decided by the
same Court (the learned Judicial Magistrate) though
by different orders: one, passed on 23/10/2019, and
the other, on 27/11/2019, and Criminal Revisions
Petitions (CRPs) decided by the same Court
(learned Additional Sessions Judge). The question
for determination is that whether the principle that

the person last in possession of a property is still

Abdul Sabooh = (S.B.} Hon'ble Mr. Justice Dr. Khurshid Iqbal
-2-

applicable when more persons than one (the last
possessor, being the petitioner herein) have come to

the Court with competing claims.

2. The germane facts of the case are that
Gulbaz (Respondent # 2), claiming to be the owner
of the vehicle in question, reported to the police that
19 months ago, he had given the vehicle in question
to Malak Sahil alias Tawabuddin for his temporary
personal use. But Malak Sahil never returned it to
him despite his efforts. His report was recorded in
the daily diary # 56, on 27/09/2019. An inquiry was
Jaunched which culminated into a criminal case at
the strength of FIR # 301, on 11/10/2019, against
Malak Sahil under section 406, PPC, registered in
Police Station (PS) Dir, District Dir Upper. The
vehicle in question was recovered from the
possession of the petitioner in Swat. The petitioner
and the complainant both agreed to park the vehicle
in PS Charbagh in Swat. However, it was later
shifted to Dir Upper where the complainant, the
petitioner and one Shah Jehan, filed separate
applications for the custody before Judicial
Magistrate, who has allowed the application of the
complainant per his orders referred to above. When

arrested, Malak Sahil admitted that he has sold the .

vehicle in question and promised to make good a
sum of Rs. 6,30,000/- to the complainant, but he

never honoured his promise.

3. I have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the parties and the learned Assistant
Advocate General, for the State and perused the

record.

4. A preliminary objection was raised that
one QP against the judgment of the Revisional
Court is not maintainable for the reason that the
petitioner didn’t challenge the Judicial Magistrate’s
order dated 23/10/2019 before the Revisional Court.
However, he filed a CRP against the Magistrate’s
order dated 27/11/2019 which the Revisional Court
decided by a consolidated Judgment dated

06/06/2020. The record confirms this fact.

5. It is pertinent to mention that one Shah
Jehan also came forward and claimed custody,
contending that he has purchased the vehicle from
Malak Sahil, he then sold it to Awal Khan. He
further contends that Awal Khan returned it to him
owing to the dispute over it and subsequently, he

returned it to Malak Sahil.

6. Coming to petitioner’s case, a bare
perusal of his QPs would show that he has set up no
specific plea as from whom he has purchased or
otherwise got the vehicle in question when and
where. His only plea is that he is the last possessor.
He claims it from the complainant only to whom the
custody has been given by the Judicial Magistrate,
which has been confirmed by the learned Revisional
Court. The record reflects that the entire story, till
this stage, revolves around the complainant and
Malak Sahil: the former having registered the
criminal case against the latter on the charge of

criminal breach of trust.

7. During investigation of the case, the
petitioner has recorded his statement under section
161, Cr. P.C. in which he has stated that he has
purchased the vehicle in question from one Fazal
Rahman son of Bakht Zada, a resident of village
Rorya Charbagh at the sale consideration of
Rs. 5,00,000/-, out of which he has paid
Rs, 2,00,000/-, and the remaining is still outstanding
against him. He has shown no sale deed in this
respect. Malak Sahil has also recorded his statement
under section 161, Cr. P.C. in which he has admitted

having obtained the vehicle in question on the

Abdul Sabooh (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Dr. Khurshid Iqbal
-5-
pretext of his personal need and sold it to Shah

Jehan. Shah Jehan has also recorded a similar
statement in which he has reiterated his contention
noted in paragraph 5, above. On the record, the sale
deed in favour of the complainant is available which
shows that he had purchased it from one Bacha
Rahman, a resident of Dir Upper. Moreover, the
complainant is also in possession of original

documents of the vehicle in question.

8. The conclusion of the above discussion
is that the complainant has a deed showing him as a
purchaser. He had given the vehicle in question to
Malak Sahil for his personal use and charged the
aforesaid Malak Sahil for committed criminal
breach of trust (under section 406, PPC). Indeed,
whatever transaction Malak Sahil has entered into
with whomsoever at which particular point of time,
has no legal value for the simple reason that a
criminal case has been registered against Malak
Sahil for which he has to face trial. While it is yet to
be seen whether the charge against Malak Sahil
would be proved or not, at the moment, a criminal
charge exists against him which prima facie
disentitles anyone whose claim, somehow or the

other, is traceable to him. The record shows that

Abdul Sabooh (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr, Justice Dr. Khurshid Iqbal
-6-

Shah Jehan has also filed a civil suit against the
aforesaid Malak Sahil and the complainant. It is
worth mentioning that copy of a sale deed dated
21/03/2018 is available on the record which shows
that the complainant has sold the vehicle in question
to Malak Sahil (showing his name as Bakhtuddin).
However, there is no counterclaim of Malak Sahil

against the complainant.

9. Finally, I shall come to law on the
subject. In a 1991 Karachi case, in which a criminal
case under section 14 of the Offences Against
Property (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance,
1979, was registered, the Court ruled that the
custody of a stolen car cannot be granted to a
petitioner who claims its purchase from a thief in a
criminal case regarding it (Qaiser Shafeeq Vohra
v. The State and another, 1991 MLD 2590
[Karachi]). The Court referred to the cases of
Ghulam Shabbir Lashari_ v. The State, 1991 P
Cr. LJ 287 and A.K.A.RA. Chettyar v. Ma Saw
Hla, AIR 1937 Rangoon 450, stating it as the
“nearest parallel to the present case” and quoted the

following observation of the Court:

“Where the known facts plainly show that
the property has been stolen, it would be
intolerable to allow the person in whose
possession the property is found to retain it

Abdul Sabooh = (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Dr. Khurshid Iqbal
-7-

as against the rightful owner and force the
latter to a civil suit for its recovery if the
accused absconds.”

A further reading of Qaiser Shafeeq above would
show that the Court deviated from the established
principle of grant of custody to the last possessor,

for the following reasons:

“Tam conscious of the fact that a different
view has been expressed in number of cases
including the one relied upon by learned
Sessions Judge to the effect that ordinarily
the Court is required to give temporary
custody of the property to a person who
was last in possession unless otherwise
there are special features which may
warrant a different course. The present
case is certainly of an _ exceptional
character where the concerned police has
avoided to prosecute the persons who could
be thieves or purchaser of the property
from the thieves. A cruel wrong was done
to the applicant which was perpetuated by
different Courts at different stages. In this
way a person who himself was a victim and
who had a preferential right was denied
the custody of his own car by a person who
claimed to have purchased it from thief.”

10. Another relevant case is Abdul Rashid

y. Allah Ditta and other, 1985 MPD 1376

[Lahore]. The facts of this case reveal that while the
petitioner was held entitled to the custody of vehicle
in question (a tractor) as the person found last in
possession, there was a criminal case registered
regarding it under sections 382/148/149, PPC, and
section 17 of the Offences Against Property

(Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979, against

of

the respondent. In short, there was allegation of
forcible removal of the vehicle in question from

possession of the first owner.

1. The answer to the question mentioned
in paragraph-1, above, is that where more than one
person lay claim to the custody of property, the
principle that the contender claiming to be last in
possession would not apply, particularly when there
is a criminal charge, say, theft or criminal breach of
trust against one of them. In other words, it is to be

seen whose claim stand on a higher pedestal.

12. In light of the above discussion, I find
no force in both the QPs, which are accordingly

dismissed.
