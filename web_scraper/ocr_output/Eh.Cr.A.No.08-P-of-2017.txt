Accountability Bureau, Islamabad

Vs

JUDGMENT
Date of hearing 09.05.2018.

Petitioner(s) by:

Respondent(s) by:

IKRAMULLAH KHAN, J.- Before us, for

consideration is the appeal filed by the
Chairman, NAB against the impugned Judgment
dated 09.09.2017, rendered by the learned
Accountability Court-ll, Peshawar, whereby the
respondents were acquitted of the charges
leveled against them, under the NAB Ordinance,
1999 by exercising jurisdiction conferred under
Section 265-K Cr.P.C.

02. In essence, allegations against the
present respondents are that they have
established an industrial empire in a short
period and acquired huge assets
disproportionate to their known sources of
income amounting to Rs.82.09,25,815/- in toto;

that before 1985, total land holdings of accused
2

and their family were 377 kanal and 01 marla in
District, Mardan and after 1985, land holdings of
the respondents and their family increased to
8853 kanal and 09 marla; that the respondents
in their income tax/wealth tax returns have
never declared their bank accounts; that in first
round of litigation, all the accused were
acquitted by the learned Judge, Accountability
Court under Section 265-K Cr.P.C. on different
dates, against which Ehtisab Criminal Appeals
were filed before this Court, which were
dismissed on 17.02.2004. Appeals against the
said Judgment were preferred before the Apex
Court by the NAB and the same was remanded
back for trial afresh. The learned Trial Court after
hearing arguments, acquitted the accused vide
impugned judgment dated 09.09.2017, hence,
the instant appeal.

03. Learned counsel for the appellant
contended that the impugned Judgment is
against the law and facts on record; that the
learned Trial Court has not appreciated the
evidence on_ record, adduced by _ the
prosecution, whereby prosecution had proved

its case against the respondents beyond any
3

reasonable grounds; that the NAB Ordinance is a
special law and frequent exercise of power
envisaged under Section 265-K Cr.P.C. could not
be exercised; that the respondents were under
their legal obligation to discharge their burden
in term of Section 14 of the NAB Ordinance to
enter into the witness box and bring on record
their sources of income to commensurate with
the huge property illegally accumulated by the
respondents but without discharging of this
burden, placed upon every accused facing
charges under NAB Ordinance, the learned Trial
Court has acquitted the respondents for un-
explained reasons.

04. On the other hand, the learned
counsel for the respondents contended that the
case against the respondents and_ other
acquitted accused, was the result of malafide
and political victimization; that the NAB has got
no jurisdiction to either initiate any inquiry or
investigation against any member of the public
particularly a businessman, except those who
had any nexus with the offences, prescribed
under Section 9 of the NAB Ordinance, while

special law could not be applied generally, in
4
order to substitute general law of the land; that
all the respondents are businessmen, bonafide
citizen of the land having no nexus whatsoever
with the offences prescribed under Section 9 of
the NAB and does not qualify the meaning of
any person, used in the NAB Ordinance,
otherwise, the NAB would exercise its power to
investigate any person holding properties which
would be against the preamble of the Ordinance
itself; that the NAB has not proved its case
against the respondents and no specific charge
had framed against the respondents; that the
Accountability Court could exercise jurisdiction
conferred under Section 265-K Cr.P.C. at any
stage of the trial when arrives to the conclusion
that the Prosecution was not able to bring guilt
home to the accused.

05. We have heard learned DPG on
behalf of the State as well as learned counsel for
the respondents in light of law and facts on
record.

06. In order to elucidate the contention
of the learned counsel for the respondents that
the NAB could not be given unbridled power to

substitute for general law of the land and
initiate inquiry and investigation under the NAB
Ordinance against each and every person,
despite the fact that such person has no even a
remote nexus/link with any business of
government or exchequer.

07. It would be expedient to reproduce
the preamble of the NAB Ordinance, which
reads as: -

“An Ordinance to provide for the setting
up of a National Accountability Bureau so
as to eradicate corruption and corrupt
practices and hold accountable all those
persons accused of such practices and
matters ancillary thereto;

Whereas it is expedient and necessary to
provide for effective measures for the
detection, investigation, prosecution and
speedy disposal of cases _ involving
corruption, corrupt practices, misuse or
abuse of power’ or authority,
misappropriation of property, taking of
kickbacks, commission and for matters
connected and ancillary or incidental
thereto;

And Whereas there is an emergent need
for the recovery of outstanding amounts
from those persons who have committed
default in the repayment of amounts to
Banks, Financial Institutions,
Governmental agencies and _ other
Agencies;

And Whereas there is a grave and urgent
need for the recovery of state money and

other assets from those persons who have
misappropriated or removed such money
or assets through corruption, corrupt
practices and misuse of power or
authority;

And Whereas there is an urgent need to
educate the society about the causes and
effects of corruption and _ corrupt
practices and to implement policies and
procedures for the prevention of
corruption in the society; and

And Whereas there is an_ increased
international awareness that nations
should co-operate in combating
corruption and seek, obtain or give
mutual legal assistance in matters
concerning corruption and for matters
connected, ancillary or incidental thereto;
And Whereas it is necessary that a
National Accountability Bureau be set up
so as to achieve the above aims;

And Whereas the National Assembly and
the Senate stand suspended in pursuance
of the Proclamation of the Fourteenth
day of October, 1999 and the Provisional
Constitution Order No.1 of 1999, as
amended;

And Whereas the President is satisfied
that circumstances exist which render it
necessary to take immediate action;

Now, Therefore, in pursuance of the
aforesaid Proclamation and Provisional
Constitution Order as well as Order No.9
of 1999, and in exercise of all powers
enabling him in that behalf, the President
of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan is

pleased to make and promulgate the

following Ordinance”.
08. To summarize and __ specifically
construe the intention of the law maker, for
which the NAB- Ordinance was duly
promulgated, reads as: -

i. Eradication of corruption and corrupt
practices.

it. Misuse of power or authority.

iti. Misappropriation of property, taking of
kickback, commission.

iv. Recovery of amounts from defaulter of
Bank and other financial institution and

all matters ancillary or accidental thereto.

09. While by virtue of Section 4, the NAB
Ordinance was extended to the whole of
Pakistan and shall also apply to all citizens of
Pakistan and persons who are or have been in
service of Pakistan wherever they may be.

10. Both the preamble and_ the
provisions contained in Section 4 of the NAB
Ordinance, no doubt apply not only to persons
in service of Pakistan or have been in service of
Pakistan but also all citizens of Pakistan, subject
to involvement of them in any matter either
mentioned in the preamble of the Ordinance or
matter connected, ancillary or incidental thereto,

or have any nexus with the offences prescribed
under Section 9 of the NAB Ordinance, which
reads as: -

“9. Corruption and corrupt practices:

other person, is said to commit or to have

the Chairman NAB shall refer the matter
to a Court for approval and for the
release of the accused, if in custody.]

(d) Omitted by Ord.CXXXIll of 2002

dated 23.11.2002’.

11. In order to further explain not only
the applicability of the provisions of the NAB
Ordinance insofar as “all citizen” mentioned in
Section 4 of the NAB Ordinance are concerned
but also the jurisdiction of the NAB, prescribed
under Section 22 of the NAB Ordinance, which
reads as: -

"22. Jurisdiction. (a) The Chairman NAB
may inquire into and investigate any
suspected offence which appears to him
on reasonable grounds to involve an
offence under this Ordinance, and has
been referred to him, or of his own
accord.

(b) The Chairman NAB may, if he thinks
fit, conduct any such investigation in
conjunction with any other agency or any
other person who is in the opinion of the

Chairman NAB, a proper or person to be

concerned, in it”.

12. All the above mentioned provisions
of law if read and construe conjunctively,
definitely and in unequivocal terms, describe

that any person or any citizen of Pakistan who is
11

involved in any offence, described under Section
9 of the Ordinance having nexus with corruption
or corrupt practices or cheating of public at
large or an offence of criminal breach of trust as
defined under Section 405 PPC with regard to
any money or valuable security entrusted to him
by public at large, the NAB has the jurisdiction
to inquire into and investigate against such
accused but if any citizen, person having no
nexus with corruption or corrupt practices
specifically defined under Section 9 of the NAB
Ordinance, the jurisdiction of the NAB could not
be extended generally to each and every
persons having holding or accumulated
properties, privately through any legal business.
13. This legal preposition has already
been exclusively interpreted and explained by
the Apex Court in his Judgment reported as
(PLD 2013 Supreme Court 594) wherein it is
held, insofar as the accountability of general
public is concerned, that: -

“If we were to accept the contention that
the National Accountability Ordinance,
1999, and_ particularly section 9(a)
thereof, is applicable only to holder of a
public office and a person aiding and

abetting or conspiring with holder of a
12

public office then the provisions of
sections 9(a)(xi) and 9(a)(xii) reproduced
above would be rendered partially or
wholly redundant. It is trite that
redundancy cannot or ought not to be

attributed to the legislature.

13. The discussion made above leads us
to an irresistible conclusion that the
principle of ejusdem generis pressed by
Mr. Wasim Sajjad does not apply to the
words "any other person" appearing in
section 9(a) of the National
Accountability Ordinance, 1999 and that
the words "A holder of a public office, or
any other person," used in that section
are disjunctive as they refer to different
classes of persons. In the context of the
scheme and scope of that Ordinance the
words "any other person" are to be given
their ordinary meanings and are simply
to be accepted as referring to any other
person, nothing more and nothing less.
On the subject of interpretation of such
words appearing in a statute we may
usefully refer to the following passages
of the judgment rendered by this Court in
the case of Justice Khurshid Anwar
Bhinder and others v. Federation of

Pakistan and another (PLD 2010 SC 483):

"A fundamental principle of
constitutional construction has always
been to give effect to the intent of the
framers of the organic law and of the
people adopting it. The pole star in the
construction of a Constitution is the
intention of its makers and adopters.

When the language of the statute is not
13

only plain but admits of but one
meaning, the task of interpretation can
hardly be said to arise. It is not allowable
to interpret what has no need of
interpretation. Such language best
declares, without more, the intention of
the lawgivers, and is decisive of it. The
rule of construction is "to intend the
Legislature to have meant what they have
actually expressed". It matters not, in
such a case, what the consequences may
be. Therefore if the meaning of the
language used in a_ statute is
unambiguous and is in accord with
justice and convenience, the courts
cannot busy themselves with supposed
intentions, however admirable the same
may be, because, in that event they
would be _ travelling beyond their
province and legislating for themselves.
But if the context of the provision itself
shows that the meaning intended was
somewhat less than the words plainly
seem to mean then the court must
interpret that language in accordance
with the indication of the intention of the
legislature so plainly given. The first and
primary rule of construction is that the
intention of the Legislature must be
found in the words used by the
Legislature itself. If the words used are
capable of one construction only then it
would not be open to the courts to adopt
any other hypothetical construction on
the ground that such _ hypothetical
construction is more consistent with the
alleged object and policy of the Act. The
essence of law lies in its spirit, not in its

letter, for the letter is significant only as
14

being the external manifestation of the
intention that underlies it. Nevertheless
in all ordinary cases the courts must be
content to accept the litera legis as the
exclusive and conclusive evidence of the
sententia legis. They must, in general,
take it absolutely for granted that the
Legislature has said what it meant, and
meant what it has said. Its scriptumest is
the first principle of interpretation.
Judges are not at liberty to add to or take
from or modify the letter of the law
simply because they have reason to
believe that the true sententia legis is not
completely or correctly expressed by it.
That is to say, in all ordinary cases
grammatical interpretation is the sole
form allowable. It is no doubt true that
the felt necessities of the times must, in
the last analysis, affect every judicial
determination, for the law embodies the
story of a nation's development through
the centuries and it cannot be dealt with
as if it contains only axioms and
corollaries of a book of mathematics. A
Judge cannot stand aloof on chill and
distant heights. The great tides and
currents which engulf the rest of men, do
not turn aside in their course and pass the
Judge by. But at the same time, the Judge
must remember that his primary function
is to interpret the law and to record what
the law is. He cannot allow his zeal, say,
for social or agrarian reform, to overrun
his true function. He does not run a race
with the Legislature for social or agrarian
reform. His task is a more limited task;
his ambition a more limited ambition. Of

course in this process of interpretation he
15

enjoys a large measure of latitude
inherent in the very nature of judicial
process. In the skeleton provided by the
Legislature, he pours life and blood and
creates an organism which is best suited
to meet the needs of society and in this
sense he makes and moulds the law in a
creative effort. But he is tied by the basic
structure provided by the Legislature
which he cannot alter and to appeal to
the spirit of the times or to the spirit of
social or agrarian reforms or for the
matter of that any other reform for the
purpose of twisting the language of the
Legislature is certainly a function which

he must refuse to perform.

The words of a statute must, prima facie,
be given their ordinary meaning. Court
must not shrink from an interpretation
which will reverse the previous law; for
the purpose of a large part of our statute
law is to make lawful that which would
not be lawful without the statute, or,
conversely, to prohibit results which
would otherwise follow. Judges are not
called upon to apply their opinions of
sound policy so as to modify the plain
meaning of statutory words but where, in
construing general words the meaning of
which is not entirely plain there are
adequate reasons for doubting whether
the Legislature could have _ been
intending so wide an interpretation as
would disregard fundamental principles,
then Court may be justified in adopting a
narrower construction. At the same time,
if the choice is between’ two

interpretations the narrower of which
16

would fail to achieve the manifest
purpose of the legislation, court should
avoid a construction which would reduce
the legislation to futility and should
rather accept the bolder construction
based on the view that Parliament would
legislate only for the purpose of bringing

about an effective result’.

14. So, no further construction would be
appropriate and no finding could be given
except the one held by the Hon‘ble Supreme
Court of Pakistan which shall be accepted
however, on the basis of the above mentioned
principle of law, the NAB has not invested with
unbridled, general jurisdiction to inquire into
and investigate against each and every person,
accumulated properties on any pretext that such
properties were not come of corruption and
corrupt practices and shift burden in term of
Section 14 of the NAB Ordinance to such
person, who has no nexus with the matters
enumerated in the preamble of the Ordinance or
with the provisions contained in Section 9 of the
NAB Ordinance.

15. His lordship, in the above mentioned
Judgment had further explained and had

clarified the jurisdiction of the NAB authorities
17
in regard to any person, in the concluding para
of the Judgment, which reads as:

“For what has been discussed above we
hold and declare that the provisions of
the National Accountability Ordinance,
1999 are applicable even to a person who
is not holder of a public office and also to
a person who has not aided, assisted,
abetted, attempted or acted in conspiracy
with holder of a public office and the
words "any other person" appearing in
section 9(a) of the said Ordinance are to
be understood and applied accordingly.
For removal of any doubt or ambiguity it
is clarified that a stand alone private
person can be proceeded against under
the said Ordinance if the other conditions
mentioned in that Ordinance in that

respect are satisfied”

16. Now adverting to the facts of this
case, the respondents were charged, inquired to
and investigated by the NAB on the grounds
that the accused during the period 1989-90 to
1996-97 (excluding the period from 15.02.1997
to 12.10.1999 Le. two years and eight months)
had accumulated / acquired properties, assets
(well mentioned in the charge sheet), in his
name and in the name of his spouse,
dependents, benamidars and associates, which
are grossly disproportionate to the known

sources of income; that the accused also jointly
18
purchased / owned the vehicles (mentioned in
the charge sheet), which are grossly
disproportionate to the known sources of
income of the accused; that the accused
committed the offence of corruption and
corrupt practices within the meaning of Section
9 of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999
punishable under Section 10 of the said
Ordinance.
17. In order to prove the principle
charge against the respondents that they had
collected their income deceitfully, fraudulently
and dishonestly, whereby had caused a wrongful
loss of Rs.2996 million to the Central Board of
Revenue, Government of Pakistan, NAB
examined as many as 63 witnesses, all of them,
had categorically stated that respondents had
paid their respective taxes.
18. The prosecution had not brought on
record an iota evidence that respondents had
ever involved in evasion of any taxes.
19. No doubt, a special procedure is
available in cases of evasion of taxes but though
if such evasion is construed to be an offence

under Section 9 of the NAB Ordinance, then, the
19
NAB was required to prove such evasion of taxes
through conceivable evidence.
20. It is settled principle of law that
charge shall be specific in criminal cases in order
to know the charges leveled against an accused
in order to defend himself.
21. In case in hand, the respondents and
their other family members are attached with
various set of business since, 1952 while the
primogenitor and elder brothers of respondents,
who had busted their business had died before
framing of charge in instant Reference while
some of co-accused, being co-partner and co-
sharer, in the business and properties under
consideration were also acquitted.
22. It is not the purpose of the NAB law
that each and every person, shall be held
accountable to prove their sources of income
and properties accumulated by them in past
length of sphere of their lives if any such person
is involved in corruption, corrupt practices,
cheating, misappropriation of money, having
nexus with the offences, prescribed under
Section 9 of the NAB Ordinance or even

enlarging the scope to cases of evasion of taxes
20

but the NAB Ordinance shall not be made a tool
by any government or by the NAB itself to
politically or otherwise victimize a businessman
having no any remote nexus with any offence of
corruption or corrupt practices, cheating public
at large, or criminal breach of trust, in regard to
money etc entrusted to him by public at large as
envisaged under Section 9 of the NAB
Ordinance.

23. In case of Muhammad Hashim Babar
(2010 SCMR 1697), the Apex Court has held that
mere possession of any pecuniary resources of
property by itself is not an offence but failure to
satisfactorily account for such possession of
pecuniary resources or property makes the
possession objectionable constitutes an offence
but if accused cannot explain, presumption
under Section 14(c) of National Accountability
Ordinance, 1999 that accused is guilty of
corruption and corrupt practice is required to be
drawn. Likewise in (PLD 2011 Supreme Court
1144), the Apex Court is also held the same view
that mere accumulation of wealth / properties is

not an offence by itself.
21

24. Keeping in view the principle of law,
enumerated by the Apex Court, in the above
mentioned judgment, NAB could only exercise
its jurisdiction in order to inquire and investigate
offences against any person, citizen of Pakistan,
if such person is involved and connected, having
any nexus either with the offences, prescribed
under Section 9 of the NAB Ordinance, or
matters incidental thereto or ancillary thereof
but could not harass, inquire and investigate
against any person, who stood alone having no
remote or direct or indirect nexus with the
offences, described /prescribed under Section 9
of the NAB Ordinance, 1999 or incidental and
ancillary thereto.

25. Insofar as the acquittal of
appellants/respondents is concerned, not only
the charge, framed against the respondents
does not disclose any offence n view of Section
9 of the NAB Ordinance but also the evidence is
shaky and no an iota evidence is brought on
record that the respondents had involved in any
office of tax evasion, cheating, fraud, corruption
or corrupt practices. No doubt, the respondents

have had huge property but the same had not
22

concealed and well mentioned in income tax
returns, which is confirmed by relevant
prosecution witnesses themselves. Prosecution
has also failed to prove that the concerned
business of respondents were illegal. Article 18
of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of
Pakistan, 973 confers rights upon any citizen of
Pakistan to enter upon any lawful profession or
occupation and to conduct lawful trade or
business, while the provisions enshrined therein
Article 23 of the Constitution, 1973 every citizen
shall have the right to acquire, hold and dispose
of property in any part of Pakistan, subject to
the Constitution and any reasonable restrictions
imposed by law in the public interest.

For what has been discussed above,

this appeal is dismissed.

Announced.
