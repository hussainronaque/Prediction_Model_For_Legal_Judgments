JUDGMENT SHEET

PESHAWAR HIGH COURT
Mingora Bench (Dar-ul-Qaza) Swat
(Judicial Department)

Cr.M.B.A. No. 621-M/2020
ORDER

_ Date of hearing: 20.11.2020

Petitioner:- (Bilal Ahmad) by M/S Noor Alam
Khan and Fawad Afzal, Advocates.

Respondent:- (The State) by Mr. Sohail Sultan,
Astt:A.G,

WIQAR AHMAD, J:- This order is directed to dispose
of application filed by petitioner namely Bilal Ahmad
for grant of post arrest bail in case FIR No. 84 dated
12.09.2020 registered under section 9 (D) of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 2019 at

Police Post Hussan Khan Shaheed Ala Dand District

Malakand.

2. As per contents of FIR, complainant namely
Naik Rehman Post Commander along with other levy
officials had laid a picket (“Nakabandi”). They stopped a
motorcar bearing No. 6432/POLICE, which was being
driven by present accused/petitioner namely Bilal Ahmad
at the relevant time, while another person sitting in its
front seat had been identified as Shakeel Ahmad. During
search of motorcar, the levy officials recovered five (05)
packets of Chars total weighing 6,000 grams lying in a

white colour plastic bag beneath the front seat of

Nawab (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
motorcar. Accused were arrested at the spot and the
motorcar was also taken in possession. ‘Murasila’ was
drafted which culminated into ibid FIR registered against
accused/petitioner and other co-accused at police station

concerned.

3. I have heard arguments of learned
counsel for petitioner, learned Astt: A.G for State and

perused the record.

4. Perusal of record reveals that about six
(06) KGs of contraband Chars was found lying hidden
in the motorcar, which was being driven by the
accused/petitioner at the time of commission of the
offence. FSL report has been received which further
confirmed that the recovered contraband had been
Chars. Accused/petitioner was found connected with
commission of the offence on tentative appraisal of the

record.

5. Learned counsel for petitioner had laid
great stress on the issue that words “or” has been used
in clause (a), (b) and (c) of section 9 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic Substances Act,
_ 2019, which suggested that the sentences of
imprisonment had been interchangeable and it had been
a settled principle that lessor punishment provided for

an offences should be taken for the purpose of bail,

Nawab (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad

i
therefore the offence could not be deemed to have been
falling in prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C. This
Court would not be able to agree with such assertion of
leamed counsel for petitioner, as the word “or”
occurring in clause (a), (b) and (c) cannot be
interpreted the way learned counsel for petitioner
argued at.bar. No doubt, words “or” has been used in
clause (a), (b) and (c), but wordings of clause (d) of

section 9 is very much clear which provided as;

(d) death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a
term which may extend to fourteen years and with
fine which may extend up to rupees one million and
not less than five lacs, if the quantity of narcotic
substance exceeds the limits of one kilogram.

Provided that if the quantity exceeds ten kilograms,
the punishment shall not be less than imprisonment
for life in any case.”

It is quite clear that in cases where the
quantity of recovered narcotic substance exceeds the
limit of one kilogram, the term of imprisonment
provided therein has been fourteen years along with
fine which may extend to one million and not less than
five lacs. The offence is therefore falling within
prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C and
accused/petitioner was not found entitled to the
concession of bail on tentative appraisal of the

evidence.

6. In light of what has been discussed above,
the application in hand was found to be lacking any

substance and same is accordingly dismissed.
