alongwith other police party were present at the
place of occurrence known as Toop Khana near Eid
Gha Shagoor. In the meanwhile, a person appeared
from Latkhowa side on foot, he was holding a thing
on his back. After some struggle he was
apprehended. He disclosed his name as Mir Waiz a
resident of Badakshan Afghanistan. This person was
holding a plastic bag (ss) and a bag om his back.
Out of the plastic bag opium wrapped up in plastic
bag was recovered, which on weighment come to
9,000 grams while from the bag four packets in
shape of cloth bags were recovered weighing 11,700
grams. Thus huge quantity of opium weighing
20,700 grams was effected from the
accused/Appellant. The accused was arrested in
presence of PWs, since the accused could not
produce any National Identity Card at the time of
arrest, therefore being Afghan National he was trying
to enter into Pakistan illegally. On the basis of

‘Murasila’? Ex. PW-2/1, FIR No. 69 (Ex. PW-2/2)
~  @

dated 12.7.2013 under sections 9 (c) CNSA & 14 F.
Act was registered at Police Station Shaghoor
against the accused/Appellant.

3. After registration of the case, investigation
was handed over to Haider Ghazi SHO Police
Station Shaghoor, who in presence of PWs taken into
possession the opium weighing 20,700 grams vide
recovery memo Ex. PW-1/3. Out of each bags 5/5
grams of opium were separated for chemical analysis
while the rest was packed into separate parcel. He
has also taken into possession a sale money of
different denomination of Pakistani currency and
Afghani currency. Murasila Ex. PW-2/1 was sent to
Police Station Shaghoor and accused/appellant was
formally arrested vide card arrest memo Ex. PW-4/2.
Recovered contraband in shape of opium was sent
for expert opinion vide Urdu docket Ex. PW-4/3.
Application Ex. PW-4/4 was moved for custody of
accused to the Court. He also recorded statements of

the PWs under section 161 Cr.P.C. On receipt of
- @

expert opinion it was placed on record as Ex. PW-
5/4.After completion of investigation, he submitted
complete challan Ex. PW-4/6 before the Court.

4. The appellant/convict was produced
before the Court, where he was formally charge
sheeted to which he pleaded not guilty and opted to
face the trial.

5. The prosecution in order to prove
charge against appellant produced four witnesses at
trial. On conclusion of prosecution evidence,
appellant was examined under Section 342, Cr.PC, in
which he professed innocence, denied the charges
and stated to have falsely been implicated in the
case. He, however, neither opted to appear as his
own witness in terms of Section 340 (2), Cr.PC, nor
wished to produce evidence in defence. The learned
trial Court, after hearing the parties and appraising
the evidence, convicted and sentenced the appellant

as stated above. Feeling dissatisfied with conviction
and sentences, appellant has come to this Court with
instant appeal.

6. Learned counsel for appellant contended
that the prosecution story as advanced in shape of
present proceedings are based'on hear-say evidence,
as neither the site plan was prepared nor it seems that
the accused/appellant was arrested with huge
quantity of contraband opium, thus with all
probabilities it can be presumed that the contraband
opium was planted one. He further added that it is
not consumable to prudent mind that how such huge
quantity of opium weighing 20,700 grams was
carried by a single individual on foot. It was lastly
argued that the marginal witnesses of thé recovery
memo are police officials and there is also delay in
sending the sample for Chemical analysis and more
so no independent or impartial witnesses have been
associated with the recovery process.

7. Learned A.A.G appearing on behalf of the

Sate opposed the submissions so made by learned
counsel for appellant and contended that prosecution
has proved its case against the appellant beyond
reasonable doubt and supported the impugned
Judgment. He argued that the accused/Appellant
being Afghan National was arrested from the area
which is situated adjacent to Afghanistan border
where such kind of cases do occur and even
otherwise it is almost next to impossible that such
huge quantity of opium can be planted by the police
officials.

8. We have considered the arguments of
learned counsel for the parties and have gone
through the record.

9. The perusal of record reveals that a huge
quantity of narcotic substance has been recovered
from personal possession of the appellant. The local
police after arrest of the appellant fulfilled all the
legal and codal formalities in line with the version
taken by the prosecution. Sardar Ali, SI PS Shaghoor

appeared as PW-1, who has conducted partial
-  @

investigation. He has obtained . custody of the
accused through an application Ex. PW-1I/1 and
accused was produced to the concerned court
through an application Ex. PW-1/2 for recording
confessional statement, on his denial he was sent to
judicial lockup. PW-2 Ibrahim Shah ASI drafted the
First Information Report on the basis of Murasila Ex.
PW-2/1, which is placed on record as Ex. PW-2/2.
PW-3 is Atta-ur-Rahman ASI PS Shaghoor, who in
presence of other PWs at about 1.30 AM at
nighttime arrested the accused/Appellant with huge
quantity of opium. In his presence the Investigating
Officer taken into possession the recovered
contraband vide recovery memo Ex. PW-3/1]. PW-4
is the Investigating Officer, who has conducted the
investigation and he too, supported the prosecution
case as taken place in the mode and manner.

10. All the prosecution witnesses were
cross-examined at length by the defence but nothing

adverse could be extracted from them to doubt the
prosecution case. This Court is also not in
compromising term with the submissions of learned
counsel for the Appellant that in view of non-
preparation of site plan the story advanced by the
prosecution has lost its evidentiary value. In this
respect, suffice it to say, that site plan is not a
substantive piece of evidence, rather it is a
corroborative piece of evidence and its non-
preparation by no means dilute the whole version of
prosecution, as in the case in hand there is huge
recovery of contraband i.e. 20,700 grams. Even
otherwise, the accused/Appellant could not justify
his presence in the place of occurrence and that too
at nighttime with such huge quantity of opium and
above all being Afghan national who was illegally
entered into Pakistani territory for the purpose of
transportation of contraband. More so, it is not
appealable to prudent mind that such huge quantity
of contraband weighing 20,700 grams can be planted

on behalf of the police officials, as admittedly the
-  @

area where this occurrence had taken place is known
for such kind of activities as drug peddlers do take
advantage of the stiff terrains and huge mountains
situated in the area (Chitral), where normally
presence of the police officials are low due to harsh
weather, so, the smugglers often used these stiff
terrains for transportation of the narcotics.
‘

11. We are not persuaded to agree with the
learned counsel for appellant that there is violation of
section 103 Cr.P.C, which could be considered fatal
to the prosecution case. Provision of Section 103
Cr.P.C stand excluded in view of provision of
Section 25 of Control of Narcotic Substances Act,
1997. Statements of police officials cannot be
discarded merely on the ground that they belong to
police force unless any animosity on their part for
false involvement of an accused is established on
record. Reliance can be placed on Naseer Ahmad v/s

The State (2004 SCMR 1361 ), Riaz Ahmad v/s The

State (2004 SCMR_988) followed in the case o

vt

*

~ @

Ismaeel v/s State (2010 SCMR 27). No previous ill

will or mala fide has been alleged by the appellant
against the PWs.

12. The story of prosecution has further been
corroborated by the positive FSL report, Ex-PW-4/5.
Though, there is delay in sending the sample to
Chemical Examiner, yet the same would be
inconsequential as there is no evidence that the
samples were tainted. The appellant was examined
under section 342 Cr.P.C wherein he, though, denied
the allegation but he neither appeared himself as his
own witness nor led evidence to contradict what the
prosecution had proved against him. All the
prosecution witnesses have deposed in line to the
prosecution story. The witnesses were subjected to a
lengthy cross examination but the defence failed to
shatter their testimony fatal to the prosecution case.
The prosecution has been able to bring home guilt of
the appellant keeping in view the ocular account,

recovery of huge quantity of narcotic substance and
-Li-

positive report of chemical examiner, Ex.PW-4/S.
The judgment of conviction and sentence passed
against the appellant is based on correct appreciation
of evidence on record and there is nothing on record
to indicate that the judgment is based on any error of
law or the same is different to well-established
principles of judicial approach or the same can in
any manner be characterized as unjustified.

13. For what has been discussed above, this

criminal appeal being shom of merits stands

dismissed.
