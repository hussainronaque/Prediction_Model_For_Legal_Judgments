SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.--- This is an application under

section 426 Cr.P.C for the suspension of sentence of Sher Jan,

the appellant who has been convicted and sentenced by the

learned trial Court as under:-

Imprisonment for life under section 302/34(b)

PPC for raising Lalkara/for issuing command

to his son Bait Ullah to commit murder of

Naseer Muhammad (now dead) with a

compensation of Rs.20,00,000/-(Twenty Lakhs)

under section 544- A Cr.P.C to be paid to the

legal heirs of the deceased. In default thereof

to further undergo six months S.I. Benefit of

Ihsan (D.B) Justice Abdul Shakoor and Justice Shakeel Ahmad.
section 382-B Cr.P.C was extended to the

petitioner/appellant.

2. The facts necessary for the disposal of this petition

are that on 03.5.2014 at 16.40 hours complainant Mehrab Khan

reported the matter to Pasham Khan ASI, to the effect that he

went to the shop of one Saif ur Rehman situated in his village to

purchase house-hold articles, whereas his sons namely Naseer

Muhammad and Nisar Ahmad were also present there. He after

purchasing house hold articles was returning from the shop. His

son Naseer Muhammad was some paces ahead, while he along

with other son Naseer Ahmad were behind him. At 1600 hours

accused Sher Jan and co-accused Baitullah (juvenile co-accused

facing trial) appeared on motorcycle. Accused Sher Jan was

driving the motorbike while co-accused Baitullah duly armed

with Kalashnikov was sitting behind him. As soon as the

accused crossed the complainant party, accused Sher Jan

ordered his son Baitullah to kill Naseer Muhammad. Upon

which accused Bait Ullah started firing at his son Naseer

Muhammad, as a result of which he was hit and fell down. The

accused after commission of the offence fled away from the

Ihsan (D.B) Justice Abdul Shakoor and Justice Shakeel Ahmad.
spot. When the complainant and his son Nisar Ahmad attended

Naseer Muhammad, he was taking his last breath. Motive as

alleged in the crime report is that the co-accused Bait Ullah had

committed decoity in the house of the complainant on the basis

of which he and his group was charged.

3. It has been argued by the learned counsel for the

petitioner that the only allegation against the petitioner is that

he raised Lalkara at the time of occurrence; that the petitioner

remained present before the Court during the whole trial; that

the petitioner has been convicted under section 302(b) PPC read

with section 34 PPC whereas there is no such evidence, which

could attract the provision of section 34 PPC qua the petitioner

and this fact even otherwise shall finally be determined at the

time of hearing the main appeal, which is not at sight in the

near future.

4. As against that the learned counsel appearing on

behalf of the complainant contended that the petitioner has

specifically been charged for raising Lalkara/issuing command

to his son to kill Naseer Muhammad, besides, facilitating the

crime, therefore, section 34 PPC is fully attracted under the

Ihsan (D.B) Justice Abdul Shakoor and Justice Shakeel Ahmad.
attending circumstances of the case; that the petitioner has been

convicted after a full dressed trial, therefore, he is not entitled

for suspension of sentence.

5. The learned AAG representing the State supported

the contention of the learned counsel for the complainant and

added that conviction of the petitioner does not fall within the

ambit of section 426(1-A) Cr.P.C, therefore, his prayer for

suspension of sentence is not tenable in the eye of law.

6. We have given our anxious consideration to the

contentions raised by the learned counsel for the parties and

have gone through the record with their eminent assistance.

7. Undoubtedly, there is no bar to the tentative

assessment of evidence on the basis of which finding of guilt is

given, for the purpose to consider the application of suspension

of sentence under section 426(1) Cr.P.C. In this respect we are

fortified by the full Court judgment of Lahore High Court

reported as “Altaf Hussain Shah Vs. The State”(1986

P.Cr.L.J. 2202), wherein it was observed that:-

“the power and discretion of the appellate Court
to grant bail is not fettered or restricted by
reference either to the conviction or sentence
passed against an appellant but this discretion
must be exercised in a proper manner.”

Ihsan (D.B) Justice Abdul Shakoor and Justice Shakeel Ahmad.
In this context reliance can also be placed on the cases reported

as “Allah Yar and another Vs. The State”(1996 P.Cr.L.J.

211) and “Mumtaz Ali and another Vs. The State” (2012

YLR 2204).

8. It is now settled that appellate Court has got

implied power to grant relief which is ancillary or incidental to

appeal during pendency of appeal. This power of appellate

Court under section 426(1) Cr.P.C is in fact limited and court

during pending disposal of appeal, suspend the sentence of

accused in appropriate cases in its discretion for good and

sufficient reasons, unlike section 426(1-A) Cr.P.C , wherein it

is not a discretion of the Court but the grant of bail is

mandatory and for its refusal reasons must be stated, reflecting

that grant of bail is a rule while refusal thereof an exception in

the case falling within the ambit of sub-section (1-A) of section

426 Cr.P.C. The two provisions, one is under sub-section (1)

and the other is under sub-section (1-A) of section 426

Cr.P.C are unlike and in contrast to each other and in the

former it is the discretion of the Court and in case of

suspension of sentence the reasons will have to be recorded

Ihsan (D.B) Justice Abdul Shakoor and Justice Shakeel Ahmad.
while in the latter it has been made mandatory that the sentence

shall be suspended with a further provision that in case of

refusal, reasons will have to be recorded.

9. We have noticed that the only allegation against

the petitioner is that he raised Lalkara/issued command to his

son to commit murder of Nasser Muhammad and facilitated the

crime. Genuineness or otherwise of allegation against the

petitioner would be adjudged at the time of final adjudication of

main appeal, thus he has made out a case for suspension of

sentence. In this behalf reference may be made to the cases

report as “Muhammad Ashfaq Vs. The State” (2005 YLR

2314), “Noor Muhammad Vs The State and another” (2013

YLR 235), Muhammad Ali Vs The State” (2007 YLR 2986),

“Mst. Nasreen Bibi Vs The State” (PLD 2007 Lahore 531),

“Muhammad Yaseen Vs. The State”(2007 MLD 1066) and

“Mumtaz Hussain Vs The State” (2006 YLR 2385).

10. In view of the above, we accept this petition and

suspend the sentence of the petitioner. He is directed to be

released on bail subject to his furnishing bail bonds in the sum

of Rs. 3,00,000/-(Rupees three Lakhs) with two sureties each in

Ihsan (D.B) Justice Abdul Shakoor and Justice Shakeel Ahmad.
the like amount to the satisfaction of learned trial Court/ASJ-
II, Lakki Marwat. The petitioner shall appear before the Court
in person on each and every date of hearing of his main appeal.

Announced.
