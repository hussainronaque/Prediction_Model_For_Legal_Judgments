SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.--- Through this appeal,
the appellant has called in question the judgment dated
19.02.2021 passed by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-I, North Waziristan in case FIR No.15 dated
30.10.2019 under section 302/34 PPC registered with
police station Miranshah, North Waziristan, whereby, he
convicted the appellant under section 302(b) PPC and
sentenced him to imprisonment for life on two counts
alongwith payment of Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lac)
to the legal heirs of each deceased under section 544-A
Cr.P.C or in default thereof, to :undergo six months
simple imprisonment, whereas, co-accused Haji

Muhammad was acquitted of the charges for want of
evidence. Benefit under section 382-B Cr.P.C was
extended to the appellant.

2. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant has questioned the
legality of the impugned judgment and the awarded
sentences through instant appeal.

3. Briefly stating, facts of the case, as divulged in the
first information report “FIR” ExPA, are that complainant
Bakht Rasool made a report to the local police in terms
that on the day of occurrence, he alongwith his sons
namely Shakir Ullah and Kausar Ullah was proceeding to
Bazar; when they reached near the house of Alam Raheel
alias Alam Raseel, they saw accused Alam Raheel alias
Alam Raseel duly armed with Kalashnikov, Haji
Muhammad and his son Yasir duly armed with pistols;
that it was about 07:15am, when accused Alam Raheel
alias Alam Raseel started firing at Shakir Ullah and
Kausar Ullah through his Kalashnikov, resultantly, both
of them got hit and succumbed to the injuries on the spot.
The accused decamped from the spot after the
commission of offence. Motive is alleged to be a dispute
over womenfolk. Hence, the FIR.

4. After completion of investigation and arrest of the

accused / appellant, prosecution submitted complete
challan, where at the commencement of trial, the
prosecution produced and examined as many as 10
witnesses. On close of prosecution evidence, statements
of appellant / accused and that of co-accused Haji
Muhammad were recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C,
wherein they professed innocence and false implication,
however, neither they opted to be:examined on oath as
provided under section 340(2) Cr.P.C, nor wished to
produce defence evidence. After hearing arguments, the
learned trial Court vide the impugned judgment dated
19.02.2021, convicted and sentenced the accused /
appellant as mentioned above, whereas, co-accused Haji
Muhammad was acquitted of the charges for want of
evidence. Hence, the instant appeal against the judgment
of conviction.

5. The learned counsel for the parties alongwith
Assistant Advocate General were: heard at length and
with their valuable assistance, gone through the record.

6. The tragic incident occurred on 30.10.2019, when
the complainant alongwith his deceased sons were on his
way to local Bazar. The deceased after receiving firearm
injuries died on the spot and their dead bodies were

shifted with the help of co-villagers from the place of
incident to a vacant plot situated in front of the house of
the complainant. The SHO of the concerned police station
after receiving information regarding the incident reached
to the spot, where the complainant reported the matter
and the same was penned down in the shape of Murasila.
After drafting the murasila, the injury sheets and inquest
reports were prepared and the dead bodies were sent to
the doctor for postmortem examination. It is pertinent to
mention that soon after the incident, the appellant was
arrested from in front of his house and from his personal
possession, a Kalashnikov alongwith live rounds were
taken into possession. The investigating officer after
getting copy of the FIR, reached to the spot and on
pointation of the complainant, prepared the site plan.
During spot inspection, the investigating officer took into
possession three empties of 7.62 bore near from the place
of the convict / appellant, whereas, bloodstained earth
was collected from the places of the deceased. The site
plan also depicts bullet marks on the house of the
appellant. The investigating officer dispatched the
Kalashnikov recovered from the possession of the
appellant alongwith three empties ef 7.62 bore recovered

from the spot to the Forensic Science Laboratory and
after chemical analysis, a laboratory report was received
with an opinion that the same were fired from the
recovered Kalashnikov. The accused was produced
before the Court of Judicial Magistrate on 31.10.2019,
where he opted to confess his guilt and as such, his
statement under section 164/364 Cr.P.C was recorded.
The co-accused were also arrested in the instant case after
their bail before arrests could not be confirmed. All the
three accused faced trial and on conclusion of the trial,
the accused Alam Raheel alias Alam Rasil was convicted
and sentenced as stated above, whereas, the co-accused
were acquitted of the charges. Feeling aggrieved, the
convict / appellant approached this Court through the
instant criminal appeal.

7. The impugned judgment was read with valuable
assistance of learned counsel for the parties, where the
learned trial judge dealt with the material aspects of the
case and after application of his ‘judicial mind to the
collected material and recorded statements, convicted the
appellant. This being the Court of appeal, feels it essential
to thrash out the collected material to ascertain as to
whether the learned trial judge was justified to convict the

appellant, and to acquit the co-accused and as to whether
the evidence on file was properly appreciated. True that
the learned trial judge was influenced from the
confessional statement of the convict / appellant and that
from the death of the two deceased alongwith close
relationship of the parties, but we are to scan through the
record as to whether the approach of the learned trial
judge, more particularly, keeping before these three
essential elements of the prosecution, was justified and as
to whether the reasons advanced by the learned trial judge
find support from the attending circumstances of the case.
True that the appellant was arrested from the spot, he
confessed his guilt before the competent Court of law and
that the weapon used in the episode was recovered from
his possession, which wedded with the recovered
empties, but equally true that these factors alone are not
sufficient to convict an accused charged for the murder,
rather the prosecution is still under obligation to collect
independent evidence in that respect, so that miscarriage
of justice could be avoided.

8. Though, the complainant is the sole eye witness of
the incident and that the accused were his nephews, yet
we are to see as to whether the incident occurred in the

mode, manner and at the stated time; and as to whether it
was the complainant who saw the incident; and as to
whether the convict / appellant was arrested form the spot
and from his personal possession, a Kalashnikov used in
the incident was taken into possession and as to whether
the confession made by the convict / appellant is true and
voluntary. The complainant was examined as PW-09,
who stated that on the day of incident, he in the company
of his deceased sons, was proceeding to the local Bazar to
make purchases, when they reached in front of the house
of the convict / appellant, he in the company of his co-
accused, appeared on the spot; that the convict / appellant
was duly armed with a Kalashnikoy, started firing at the
deceased, who, after receiving firearm injuries, fell to the
ground and died on the spot; that the co-accused were
present on the spot duly armed with pistols; that after
having been fired at the deceased, the accused decamped
from the spot. In order to ascertain the veracity of the
statement of the complainant, it is essential to go through
the background of the parties which led to the strain
relationship between them. The motive was alleged as a
dispute over womenfolk, but the same was not explained
by the complainant. The explanation came on record

when the convict / appellant confessed his guilt before the
Court of Judicial Magistrate and his statement was
recorded under section 164 / 364 of the Criminal
Procedure Code, 1898. The convict / appellant during his
statement before the Court of Judicial Magistrate
explained that two of his daughters were married to the
deceased and that two of the daughters of the complainant
were engaged to his sons. He further explained that with
the passage of time, the situation between the parties
turned strained and in that eventuality, one of the
daughters of the convict / appellant who was married to
deceased Kausar Ullah was living a deserted life in his
house and that the daughters of the complainant who
were engaged to the sons of the convict / appellant were
refused to them and were engaged to the sons of his
cousins / Tarboors and this was because of these reasons,
that he got infuriated and on the day of incident, when the
deceased were passing in front of his house, he fired at
them, as a result, the deceased died on the spot. This
explanation by the convict / appellant lends support to the
motive alleged by the complainant. The houses of the
complainant and the accused are situated at a little
distance from each other and that the presence of the

complainant at the time of incident is nearer to the truth.
It was the complainant who pointed out the spot to the
investigating officer and on his pointation, the site plan
was prepared and the recoveries were effected. The
recoveries of three empties of 7.62 bore from the place of
the convict / appellant and bloodstained earth from the
places of the deceased strengthen the prosecution case to
a greater extent. The scribe reached to the spot on
receiving information and the matter was reported by the
complainant on the spot and thereafter, the dead bodies
were shifted to the doctor for postmortem examination.
The scribe was examined as PW-07 who stated that while
present a little away from the place of incident, an
informer informed him regarding the tragedy and when
he alongwith police officials reached to the spot, the
complainant was present who reported the matter which
he took in the shape of Murasila and after preparation of
the injury sheets and inquest reports, the dead bodies
were sent to the doctor for postmortem examination. This
witness was cross examined on material aspects of the
case, but nothing detrimental to the prosecution case
could be extracted from his mouth. This witness was
cross examined at length, but the defence could not

succeed in shattering his testimony, rather he explained
-10-

the minute details of the case. True that the complainant
when appeared before the trial Court stated that after the
deceased lost their lives, the co-villagers arranged cots
and their dead bodies were shifted to a vacant plot
situated in front of his house, but this will not discredit
the veracity of the complainant, as he gave the exact
picture of the incident and his stateinent rings true, as the
same was spontaneous. This was questioned time & again
that when the incident occurred in front of the house of
the convict / appellant, what led to shift the dead bodies
therefrom, before reporting the matter and that why the
witnesses remained inconsistent on this particular aspect
of the case, but we cannot ignore the current status of the
area that has recently been merged in the province and
earlier to that, the like cases were dealt under the FCR,
after merger, much is needed to educate the people and
make them understand the present criminal justice
system. The scribe was examined regarding his length of
service and his caliber to investigate, who candidly
conceded that he got training from the police officials
posted from Bannu in the area. The lack of expertise and
the quest to learn has made the status of this witness

above board and we cannot discredit the prosecution case
-ll-

because of the slightest infirmities crept in. It doesn’t
matter that the dead bodies were ‘ying on the spot or
shifted in front of the house of the complainant, rather we
are to see as to whether the incident occurred at the stated
time and as to whether the deceased died on the spot due
to the firing made by the convict / appellant. It is
pertinent to mention that on the day of incident, the
convict / appellant was arrested from in front of his house
and from his personal possession, a Kalashnikov used in
the incident was taken into possession, the same was sent
to the forensic science laboratory alongwith the recovered
empties and a report was received in positive. The
bonafide of the complainant can be assessed from the fact
that the effective role of firing was attributed to the
appellant, whereas, no role of firing was attributed to the
co-accused. The physical circumstances of the present
case, in the shape of recoveries from the spot and positive
laboratory report support the case of the prosecution in
general and the statement of the complainant in
particular. The complainant came forward and narrated
the events as these occurred and no infirmity could be
pointed out in his statement. The complainant was

questioned regarding the targets and he categorically

-12-

stated that the appellant fired at the deceased and did not
fire at him, but we are not persuaded to count this fact
against the prosecution. Had there been blood feud
between the parties then the complainant would have
been fired at, but in the present case, the convict /
appellant was nourishing a grudge against the deceased
only.

9. The record tells that soon after the incident, the
convict / appellant was arrested alongwith the weapon
used and on the next day of his arrest, he was produced
before the Court of Judicial Magistrate, where he opted to
confess his guilt and as such, his statement under section
164 / 364 Cr.P.C was recorded. The learned Judicial
Magistrate who recorded the confessional statement of
the appellant was examined as PW-04 who stated that on
31.10.2019, the convict / appellant was produced before
him for recording his confessional statement; that he
provided sufficient time to the accused to think and
recompose himself which he did and thereafter, his
statement was recorded; that relevant questions were put
to the accused before his statement was recorded and
after having been satisfied that the: accused, without any

influence and coercion, was ready to confess so, his
-13-

statement was recorded. The learned Judicial Magistrate
was cross examined at length, but nothing detrimental
could be extracted from his mouth in favour of the
appellant and in disfavor of the prosecution. This witness
remained consistent on material aspects of the case and
even, he disclosed that after recording his confessional
statement, the accused was handed over to the Naib Court
who onward sent him to the judicial lock up. This was
agitated that the convict / appellant after recording his
statement was handed over to the same police who had
brought him before the court, but it came on record that
police from the police line were called and the appellant
was handed over to them to place him in the judicial lock
up. The learned counsel for the appellant wanted to reap
the harvest of this procedural irregularity, but he failed to
understand that the area where the incident occurred was
by then under the influence of miscreants and strict
security was needed to shift the appellant from the Court
of Judicial Magistrate to the judicial lock up. It has never
come on record that the convict / appellant was handed
over to the police official who produced him before the
Court of Judicial Magistrate, rather for his transportation

to the judicial lock up, Nafri from the police line was
-14-

demanded and on their arrival, he was handed over to
them and they shifted him to the concerned judicial lock
up. The sequence of events narrated by the appellant
while confessing his guilt leaves no ambiguity that it was
he who killed the deceased. Despite efforts, the defence
could not succeed in convincing this Court that either the
confession was made on inducement or the appellant was
tortured. As the appellant was arrested on 30.10.2019 and
he recorded his confessional statement on 31.10.2019, no
ambiguity is left in holding that the confessional
statement is true and voluntarily recorded as is held in
case titled “The State v. Minhum (PLD 1964 SC 813):
"Retracted confessions, whether
judicial or extra-judicial, could
legally be taken into consideration
against the maker of those
confessions himself, and if the
confessions were found to be true
and voluntary, then there was no
need at all to look for further
corroboration. As against the maker
himself his confession, judicial or

extra-judicial, whether retracted or
-15-

not retracted, can in law validly
form the sole basis of his
conviction, if the Court is satisfied
and believes that it was true and
voluntary and was not obtained by
torture or coercion or inducement.
The question, however, as to
whether in the facts and
circumstances of a given case the
Court should act upon such a
confession alone is an entirely
different question, which relates to
the weight and evidentiary value of
the confession and not to its
admissibility in law.”

f
10. True that the only confessional statement cannot be

made basis for convicting an accused charged, but
equally true that when the prosecution is in possession of
the ocular account and circumstantial evidence, then in
that eventuality, the confessional statement can be taken
into consideration for convicting an accused charged. In
the present case, it is not only the confessional statement

of the appellant, but we have an eye witness as well, who

-16-

remained consistent in his statement from beginning to
the end and the defence could not succeed in discrediting
him, rather his veracity as a witness is intact and that can
be taken into consideration. Another important aspect of
the case is the spot arrest of the appellant and the positive
laboratory report in respect of the collected empties and
recovered weapon. True that positive laboratory report is
supportive in nature and that alone cannot be taken into
consideration to determine the fate of an accused charged,
but as the prosecution has direct eye witness account and
voluntary confession of the appellant, so the same can be
taken into consideration as a supportive piece of
evidence, and the same lends support to the case of the
prosecution. While considering positive forensic science
laboratory report as a corroborative piece of evidence in
support of prosecution case, it was held in the case of
“Ali Muhammad & another Vs The State” (2002 YLR
710) that:

“The recoveries of empties of T.T.

pistol vide recovery memo (Ex.P/ 3-

C) and recovery of empties of 9.MM

vide its recovery memo and recovery

memo of 25 empties of Kalashnikov
-17-

as Ex.P/7-A and the positive report
of Forensic Science Laboratory
regarding them are also strong
corroborative pieces of evidence to

prove the case of prosecution.”

11. The investigating officer appeared before the trial
Court and was examined as PW-10 who stated that after
receiving copy of the FIR, he visited the spot and on
pointation of the complainant, prepared the site plan. He
further disclosed that after effecting recoveries from the
spot, the same were sent to the forensic science
laboratory and thereafter, the statements of the witnesses
were recorded. It was agitated time & again that despite
the fact that the matter was reported on the spot and by
the time the dead bodies were available, but the
complainant has not been cited as the identifier of the
dead bodies before the police at the time of report and
before the doctor at the time of postmortem examination,
but we are not hesitant to hold that these submissions of
the learned counsel hold no grounds. As admittedly, the
incident occurred a little away from the house of the
complainant and in front of the house of the appellant, so

the presence of the complainant either in the house or in
-18-

the vicinity on the day and at the time of incident cannot
be excluded. We cannot forget that the complainant lost
his two young sons in his immediate presence and that
soon after the incident, co-villagers attracted to the spot
and out of them, two identified the dead bodies before the
scribe at the time of report and before the doctor at the
time of postmortem examination. It is not a rule of thumb
that in all cases the complainant must be the identifier
and that if he fails to identify the dead body before the
police at the time of report and before the doctor at the
time of postmortem examination, then his presence would
outrightly be rejected. If so, then the damage caused
would be beyond repair, as the approach of the learned
trial Court while dealing with this aspect of the case must
vary from case to case. As the present incident occurred
in the close proximity of the house of complainant and
the appellant was no other than the father-in-law of the
deceased, we lurk no hesitation to hold that the
complainant was present on the spot at the time of
incident. The cumulative effect of all the collected
evidence gives no other inference, but that the incident
occurred in the mode, and manner and that the

complainant was present at the time of incident.
-19-

12. The prosecution succeeded in proving the alleged
motive and even, the confessional statement of the
appellant has fully supported the same. The details of the
strained relationship provided by the complainant and the
appellant, leaves no room to doubt and we lurk no doubt
in mind that the same has been proved on record. True
that weakness or absence of motive hardly plays a role to
dislodge the prosecution case, provided it succeeds in
proving the same through trustworthy and confidence
inspiring evidence. As in the present case, the prosecution
fully succeeded in bringing home guilt against the
appellant, so the motive, if not proved, has no role to
play, but the prosecution succeeded in proving the alleged
motive and even, the appellant supported the same.

13. The close relationship between the parties has
excluded the element of false implication, as both the
accused are the nephews of the complainant and the
daughters of the appellant were married to the deceased
and vice versa. The defence could not bring on record any
other motive and even nothing was suggested to the
witnesses that they had a mala fide to charge. When such
is the position, there remains no ambiguity in holding that

the appellant is the actual killer. As stated above, the
-20-

parties are in blood relationship and the complainant
being real father of the deceased, is not expected to let off
the real culprit and falsely implicate the appellant for the
murder of his sons, especially when there was no blood
feud between them, so substitution or false implication
becomes a rare phenomenon in the circumstances. A
similar view was expressed in the case of “Zeeshan alias
Manna Vs The State” (2019 YLR 59):

“It cannot be expected from Niaz Ali

complainant, who is father of

Muhammad Ishaq deceased that he

would let off the real culprit and

would falsely involve appellant in the

murder of his real son in the absence

of enmity between them. Substitution

in such situation is rare

phenomenon.”

14. The cumulative effect of what has been stated
above leads this Court nowhere, but to hold that the
learned trial Court was fully justified to convict the
appellant and that the reasons provided for his conviction
find support from the collected evidence and recorded

statements. We do not see any irregularity or inherent
-21-

defects in the judgment rendered by the trial Court and
that the learned trial judge competently applied his
judicial mind to the facts & circumstances of the present
case. When such is the position, we are not persuaded to
interfere and upset the findings so:recorded. The instant
criminal appeal being bereft of merit is hereby dismissed.
15. Now, diverting to the quantum of sentence
awarded by the learned trial Court, we went through
record of the case minutely. In order to ascertain as to
what led the learned trial judge to choose a lesser
sentence instead of normal penalty of death and in order
to appreciate this particular aspect of the case, we deem it
essential to go through the confessional statement
recorded by the appellant. While going through the same,
it tells nothing, but that it was the refusal of the
complainant to honour his commitment regarding the
marriage of his daughters to the sons of the appellant
which led to the present tragedy. The appellant is no other
than the father-in-law of both the deceased and there must
be some hidden reasons which disturbed the mind of the
appellant who took such an extreme step. While scanning
through the record to know the hidden cause, we came to

a definite conclusion that the tension between the families

-22-

UL overpowered his senses which in turn provoked him to
kill even those who were the nearest. The clean breast
confession of the appellant leaves no ambiguity that it
was because of the strained relationship between the
parties which overpowered the faculties of the appellant,
which in turn yielded to the tragic deaths. In the given
circumstances of the present case, we are not persuaded
to interfere and honour the request of the complainant for
enhancement of the sentence. We do appreciate the
approach of the learned trial Court on this particular
aspect of the case, the awarded sentence is fully justified
which hardly calls for interference. The instant criminal
appeal being bereft of merit is, therefore, dismissed.
