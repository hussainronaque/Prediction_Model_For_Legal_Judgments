JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- This criminal appeal

has been filed against the judgment dated 09.10.2019
passed by learned Judge, Anti-Terrorism Court, D.I Khan,
whereby accused-respondent Noroz Khan alias Abu Bakar,
involved in a case FIR No. 416, dated 15.09.2014, under
sections302/324/458/337-D/148/149 PPC/7 ATA of Police
Station, Gomal University, D.I Khan, was acquitted of the
charge.

2. The case of prosecution, as divulges from the
record, is that on 15.09.2014 at night time (00.15 hours),
some 15/20 persons, duly armed with Kalashnikovs and
hand grenades, entered into the house of complainant
Azghar Khan (PW-10), awoke inmates of the house and
after making identification of the complainant and his
brothers, namely, Fakhar Zaman and Muhammad Ismail

to be the brothers of Saif ur Rehman, the then SHO Police
Station, Kulachi, (PW-09), made firing at them, due to
which Fakhar Zaman and Muhammad Ismail were hit and
died at the spot while the complainant received injuries.
As per contents of the report, before firing at the
complainant party, one of the criminals having long hairs
and beard introduced himself to be Amin Jan alias
Malong, the Taliban Commander, while names of the rests
of the culprits were disclosed by him as Nauroz alias Abu
Bakar (the accused-respondent), Umar Baz, Bahadar,
Najibullah, Nagib, Nadim, Qari Daud and Khalid
Mansoor. Motive behind the occurrence was disclosed by
him to be the killing of his Naib Commander Salim alias
Shah Jee in a police encounter by Saif ur Rehman SHO,
the then SHO Kulachi. The matter was reported by the
complainant in injured condition at Civil Hospital, D.I
Khan which was recorded in shape of FIR Exh.PW 2/1.
Investigation of the case was entrusted to Ghazi Mar Jan
DSP (PW-14), who visited the spot and prepared the site
plan Exh.PB at the pointation of Amina Bibi (PW-11).
During spot inspection, he took into possession blood
stained earth from the places of deceased vide memo
Exh.PW 7/1. He also recovered three rounds of 7.62 bore
and one spent bullet, vide memos Exh.PW 7/2 and
Exh.PW 7/3. He further recovered 57 empties of 7.62 bore
from the places of accused vide recovery memo Exh.PW

7/4. He further took into possession blood stained
garments of the deceased and complainant coupled with
three empty packets of biscuits and footprints vide
recovery memo Exh.PW 7/5, Exh.PW 7/6 and Exh.PW
4/1. He also sent the blood stained garments and
recovered empties to the FSL for opinion and its report is
Ex.PW 14/6 and Exh.PW 14/7. Since the accused were
avoiding their lawful arrest, therefore, warrants under
section 204 Cr.P.C and notices under section 87 Cr.P.C
were issued against them. After completion of
investigation, he submitted the case file to SHO
concerned, who filed a charge sheet against all the
accused under section 512 Cr.P.C.

3. Subsequently, Nauroz alias Abu Bakar, the
accused-respondent, was arrested in the case on
16.03.2019 and supplementary challan against him was
submitted before the Court. Charge against him was
framed wherein he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
The prosecution in order to prove its case examined
eighteen witnesses. After closure of the prosecution
evidence, the accused-respondent was examined under
section 342 Cr.P.C wherein he pleaded innocence and
stated to have falsely been implicated in the case.
However, he was neither ready to be examined on oath
nor wished to produce defence. The learned trial after
hearing the parties, recorded acquittal of the accused-

respondent, vide judgment dated 09.10.2019. Feeling
aggrieved, the State through Advocate General has filed
the instant criminal appeal.

4. Arguments heard and record perused.

5. As per contents of the FIR, the occurrence took
place on 15.09.2014 at 00.15 hours while the report was
lodged on the same night at 01.30 hours. Admittedly, this
ill-starred event is nocturnal one and in the given position
of the case the question as to identification of the accused-
respondent is required to be closely scrutinized. As per
prosecution story, 15/20 armed persons had entered into
the house of complainant and after awakening the
complainant and his two brothers, namely, Fakhar Zaman
and Muhammad Ismail and after identifying them to be
the brothers of Saif ur Rehman, the then SHO Police
Station, Kulachi, made firing at them, due to which
Fakhar Zaman and Muhammad Ismail were hit and died at
the spot while the complainant sustained severe injuries.
No doubt, this disastrous incident had taken place in the
house of complainant but the question before the court is
as to whether the present accused-respondent was
identified beyond reasonable doubt by the complainant
and eyewitness Mst. Amina Bibi to be amongst the
lawbreakers. Presence of the complainant on the spot at
the relevant time, keeping in view the stamp of injury on
his person, is, no doubt, established, however, his

testimony as to the identification of the accused-
respondent on the spot at the relevant time is not above
board and rings true for the reasons that the complainant
appeared before the trial court as PW-10 and stated in his
examination in chief that 14/15 persons entered into his
house while in his report he had stated that 15/20 persons
had entered into his house. Likewise, in his cross
examination, the complainant stated that accused Malang
Jan, Nauroz and Abbas were on front and in the same
breath he stated that the accused-respondent was not
previously known to him. When the accused-respondent
was not known to him then how he identified him to be
Nauroz alias Abu Bakar, which makes his testimony
equivocal. Moreover, his statement is also contradictory to
the statement of Mst. Amina Bibi (PW-11) because in her
cross examination she stated that the accused had muffled
their faces while the complainant stated that none had
muffled his face. Similarly, the former stated in her cross
examination that first the injured Muhammad Asghar was
taken to the hospital and after one hour the dead bodies of
the deceased were taken to the hospital, while the latter in
cross examination stated that he and his deceased brothers
were put in the two vehicles on charpai. He further stated
that profuse blood was oozing from him and his deceased
brothers, however, he could not say as to whether cots
were stained with blood or not. Presence of the

complainant on the spot at the time of occurrence is not
doubted as he was having stamp of injuries on his person
but it has now been settled that a confirmed presence by
itself is not equivalence of truth, as held by the apex court
in the case titled “Ishtiaq Hussain and another vs. the
State_and_ others” (2021 SCMR 159). It has also been
well settled that injuries on a prosecution witness only
indicate his presence at the spot but what he deposes
cannot be accepted as gospel “truth”. His testimony is to
be tested and assessed on the principles applied for
appreciation of any other prosecution witness. The apex
court in the case titled “Amin Ali and another vs. The
State” (2011 SCMR_ 323) has held that presence of
injured witness cannot be doubted at place of incident
merely because he has injuries on his person but does not
stamp him to be a truthful witness. It is also settled law
that the factum of the presence of a witness being natural
would establish his presence on the spot but would not
take the prosecution case any further. Rel: Muhammad
Iqbal vs. Abid Hussain alias Mithu and 6 others (1994
SCMR 1928) Said Ahmad v. Zammured Hussain and 4
others (1981 SCMR_ 795), Muhammad Hayat and
another v. The State (1996 SCMR 1411), Muhammad
Pervez and others v. The State and others (2007
SCMR 670), Amin Ali and another vy. The State (2011

SCMR 323), Nazir Ahmad v. Muhammad Iqbal and

another (2011 SCMR 527) and Atta Ullah and 3 others
v. The State (2016 YLR 2148). It is also basic tenet of

the jurisprudence that to disbelieve a witness, it is not
necessary that there should be numerous infirmities and
there is one which impeaches the credibility of the
witness, which may make the entire statement doubtful.

6. Mst. Amina Bibi was examined as PW-11 and
she during cross examination admitted that the accused
was not known to her prior to the occurrence and when the
accused-respondent was not known to her then how she
identified him. The prosecution, though, produced Saif ur
Rehman as PW-9 but his testimony too is not in harmony
with the statement of complainant as he in cross
examination stated that he reached to his house within an
hour and when he reached to his house at that time the
dead bodies were not present and the same were brought
at about 03/3.30 a.m. He stated that the details about the
occurrence was told to him by his cousin Asmatullah after
his arrival at his house, while complainant as PW-10
stated in his cross examination that his brother Saif ur
Rehman met him in hospital within an hour after their
arrival in hospital. He further stated that Saif ur Rehman
left the hospital along with the dead bodies of his
deceased brothers.

7. Moreover, the complainant in his cross
examination stated that after arrival to the hospital, first

his report was recorded by the Incharge reporting Centre
and he was in senses but his statement has been belied by
the statement of Doctor Ghulam Muhammad PW-1. He in
cross examination stated that the injured complainant was
in serious condition and was unable to speak. When the
complainant was not able to talk, then how he lodged the
report and named the accused-respondent in his report,
which piece of evidence is also making cricks in the
prosecution story.

8. Also the complainant has neither disclosed
description of the accused-respondent in his first report
nor after his arrest, was his identification parade
conducted through the complainant and eyewitness. Yes,
the complainant in his report and during his court
statement unveiled that the names of the present accused-
respondent was disclosed to him by the principal accused,
namely, Amin alias Malang Jan but his such statement is
not sufficient for conviction of an accused person,
particularly, for the offences carrying capital punishment.
It is a double murder case and the respondent-accused is
facing a capital charge and in such like cases, evidence
must come from some unimpeachable source, which
should be corroborated and duly supported by some strong
piece of evidence, which, in the present case, is missing.

9. There is no cavil with the proposition that the
prosecution is duty bound to prove its case beyond any

reasonable doubt and if any single and slightest doubt is
created, benefit of the same must go to the accused. It is
well embedded principle of criminal justice that there is
no need of so many doubts in the prosecution case, rather
any reasonable doubt arising out of the prosecution
evidence, pricking the judicial mind is sufficient for
acquittal of the accused. Reliance is placed on a case law
Tariq Parvez vs. The State (1995 SCMR_ 1345). The
same principle was reinforced by the Hon’able Supreme
Court in a case titled Muhammad Akram vs. The State
(2009 SCMR 230)

10. Apart from the above, the scope of interference
in appeal against acquittal is most narrow and limited
because in case of acquittal the presumption of innocence
is significantly added to the cardinal rule of criminal
jurisprudence that an accused shall be presumed to be
innocent unless proved guilty. Simple is that the
presumption of innocence is doubled and the courts shall
be very slow in interfering with such an acquittal
judgment, unless it is shown to be perverse, based in gross
violation of law, suffering from the errors of grave mis-
reading or non-reading of the evidence. The principle
attributed to the appeal against acquittal is laid down by
the apex Court in its land mark judgment titled “Ghulam
Sikandar and another Vs. Mamraiz Khan and others”

(PLD 1985 SC 11) where their Lordships have ruled that:-
10

“In an appeal against acquittal the Supreme Court
would not on principle ordinarily interfere and
instead would give due weight and consideration to
the findings of Court acquitting the accused. This
approach is slightly different from that in an appeal
against conviction when leave is granted only for the
re-appraisement of evidence which then is
undertaken so as to see that benefit of every
reasonable doubt should be extended to the accused.
This difference of approach is mainly conditioned by
the fact that the acquittal carries with it the two well-
accepted presumptions; One initial, that, till found
guilty, the accused is innocent; and two that again
after the trial a Court below confirmed the
assumption of innocence. The acquittal will not carry
the second presumption and will also thus lose the
first one if one points having conclusive effect on the
end result the Court below: (a) disregarded material
evidence; (b) misread such evidence; (c) received
such evidence illegally.

In either case the well-known principles of re-
appraisement of evidence will have to be kept in
view when examining the strength of the view
expressed by the Court below. They will not be
brushed aside lightly on mere assumptions keeping
always in view that a departure from the normal
principle must be necessitated by obligatory
observance of some higher principle as noted above
and for no other reason.

The Court would not interfere with acquittal
merely because on re-appraisal of the evidence it
comes to the conclusion different from that of the
Court acquitting the accused provided both the
conclusions are reasonably possible. If, however, the
conclusion reached by that Court was such that no
reasonable person would conceivably reach the same
and was impossible then this Court would interfere

in exceptional cases on overwhelming proof
11

resulting in conclusive and irresistible conclusion;
and that too with a view only to avoid grave
miscarriage of justice and for no other purpose. The
important test visualized in these cases, in this behalf
was that the finding sought to be interfered with,
after scrutiny under the foregoing searching light,
should be found wholly as artificial, shocking and
ridiculous”.

Similarly, in the case of “Mst. Jallan Vs. Muhammad
Riaz and other” (PLD 2003 SC 644) it was observed by
the august Supreme Court that:-

“Once an accused had earned acquittal in his favour,
he enjoyed double presumption of innocence and the
Court while examining the case of such accused must
be very careful and cautious in interfering with the
acquittal order and normally should not set aside the
same merely for the reason that some other view was
also possible---interference, however, could be made
in exercise of powers conferred upon the Court under
S.417, Cr.P.C., if it was proved that the Court whose
judgment was under scrutiny had misread such
evidence”.

Reference can also be made to case law titled
“Zaheer-ud-Din Vs. The State” (1993 SCMR-1628
“Khan Vs. Sajjad and 2 others” (2004 SCMR 215),
“Barkat Ali Vs. Shaukat Ali and others” (2004 SCMR
249,. “Farhat Azeem Vs. Asmat Ullah and 6 others”
(2008 SCMR 1285), “Haji Payo Khan Vs. Sher Baz
and others” (2009 SCMR 803), “Muhammad Aslam
Vs. Sabir Hussain and others” (2009 SCMR 985).

11. In view of the above discussion and the case

law relied upon, we do not propose to draw a conclusion
12

different from what the learned trial court has drawn
and, hence, we do not feel hesitant to uphold the acquittal
of the respondents-accused, resultantly, the same is

maintained and, accordingly, dismiss the appeal.
