Vs

JUDGMENT

Date of hearing 17.9.2018

Appellant-Petitioner: By Shahid Hameed Qureshi, Addl: AG

Respondent:

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.---_ The State through Advocate

General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar has filed the

present criminal appeal under section 417 Cr.P.C against the

impugned judgment/order dated 10.01.2018 of the learned

Judge Anti Terrorism Court, Bannu, whereby with reference

to crime report No.21 dated 13.4.2016 of Police Station CTD,

Bannu, he had acquitted accused/respondents Ihsan Ullah son

of Sain Gul, Hayat Ullah son of Khan Gul and Dil Baz son of

Dost Muhammad Khan all r/o Grerra Shah Jahan, District

Bannu of the charges under sections 387/427 PPC/3/4

ESA/21-J/7ATA. The appeal was filed on 17.2.2018, after the
-2-

expiry of period of limitation, which is 30 days as

enumerated in section 417(2-A) Cr.P.C.

2. The learned AAG, representing the State mainly

argued that the delay in filing the appeal occurred due to non-

availability of the documents. He next contended that most of

the time consumed in collection of the case file from the

department concerned. He lastly argued that under

circumstances of the compelling nature the delay may be

condoned in the interest of justice.

3. We have given our anxious consideration to the

submissions of the learned AAG representing the State and

perused the record with his eminent assistance.

4. The appeal was filed with the delay of about 05

days. The only plea urged before us that the delay in filing the

appeal occasioned due to non-availability of the documents

and that most of the time consumed in collection of the case

file from the department concerned, therefore, the same may

be condoned in the interest of justice.

5. Perusal of the record reveals that the

accused/respondents were acquitted of the charge vide

judgment dated 10.01.2018, the application for issuance of

certified copy was not submitted and certified copy of the

impugned judgment was obtained on 20.01.2018, but despite

obtaining the same on 20.01.2018, the appeal in hand was

filed before this Court on 10.02.2018, it was returned with

objections, after removal of the same it was re-submitted on

17.02.2018, the appeal is barred by 05 days. The only plea

urged before us is that most of the time consumed in

obtaining the documents from the concerned department, it

appears from the record that vide order No. SO (Pro:/HD/1-

13/2017/Vol-1 dated 30.01.2018, the Provincial Government

had accorded sanction to the Advocate General to file the

appeal, but despite that it was filed after lapse of considerable

time. For seeking the condonation of delay each day has to be

explained, which is lacking in this case. Furthermore, the

State cannot be treated differently than ordinary litigants and

is not entitled to preferential treatment and is to be treated on

equal footing with ordinary litigant. In the reported case of

the “State through Advocate General Sindh Vs. Amir

Bakhsh” (1981 SCMR 410), the Hon’ble Supreme Court

held as under:

“Tt must also be stated that it has been the
consistent view of this Court, as expressed in
Nazar v. The State (1968 S C M R 71), Jalal
Khan v. Lakhmir (1968 S C M R 1345),
Muhammad Khan v: Sultan (1969 S C MR
&2), Piran Ditta v. The State (1970 SC MR
282), and Nur Muhammad v. The State (1972
S C M R 331), that in petitions against
acquittal delay cannot be condoned unless it
is shown that the petitioner was precluded
from filing his petition in time due to some act
of the acquitted respondents; or by some,
circumstance of a compelling nature; beyond
the petitioner's control. The reason for taking
the strict view is that in most jurisdictions an
acquittal, once record by a competent Court
is final, and the matter cannot be reopened at
the instance of any party including the State.
However under our law, a acquittal can be
challenged in certain circumstances, but if it
is not challenged within the period allowed by

law, it becomes final. In these circumstances

Thsan (D.B) Justice Abdul Shakoor and Justice Shakeel Ahmad.

is only just and proper that a petition against
acquittal must not be entertained if it is filed’
beyond time, unless it be shown that the
petitioner was prevented from moving the
wine by an act of the acquitted accused, or by
some circumstance of a compelling nature

beyond the control of the petitioner. ’

In the reported case of “Government of Punjab Vs.

Muhammad Saleem” (PLD 1995 SC 396) the Hon’ble

Supreme Court held as under:

“In the present case, the High Court gave
good reasons for declining to condon the
delay. It held that the ground taken by the
appellants in their application under section 5
of the Limitation Act that they could not file
the appeal within time as they had entered
into correspondence — with litigating
departments and the Solicitor was quite vague
and reliance was also placed on a judgment
of this Court reported in 1990 SCMR 1059
wherein it was held that “It is a well-settled
principle of law that under section 5 of the
Limitation Act, delay of each day is to be

explained” and further that, the Government

Thsan (D.B) Justice Abdul Shakoor and Justice Shakeel Ahmad.
-6-

cannot be treated differently than a private
litigant on the question of limitation under
section 5 of the Limitation Act. Discretion
exercised by the High Court proceeded on
correct appreciation of factual and legal
position. It, therefore, does not call for any
interference by this Court. It may be stated
that even before us, learned counsel
appearing for the appellants has failed to
explain each day’s delay. According to the
respondent, the papers were received in the
office of the Advocate-General on 6.1.1992
and the appeal was filed on 9.1.1992 but no
explanation whatsoever has been offered for
the delay of these days.

6. In order to bring a case for condonation of delay,

the appellant is required to show that there was sufficient

cause and it was beyond the control to file within the

prescribed time. The explanation offered for condonation of

delay by the learned AAG is neither cogent nor plausible.

Furthermore, nothing has been alleged that the delay was

occurred due to some act of the acquitted accused/

respondents, who have acquired valuable rights, which cannot

be lightly disturbed or destroyed as held by the Apex Court in

the reported case of “Muhammad Bashir Vs. Province of

Punjab”(2003 SCMR 83).

7. Resultantly, this appeal is dismissed in LIMINE
being barred by time.
