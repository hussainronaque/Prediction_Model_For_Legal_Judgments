Respondent Mst. Mumtaz etc
KRKREKKKEKEKE

NISAR HUSSAIN KHAN, J.- Appellants Qudrat Sher

and Quraish, have filed this criminal appeal against the judgment
of learned Additional Sessions Judge, Lahor, District Swabi,
dated 24.5.2014 whereby:
> Appellant Qudrat Sher has been convicted under Section
302(b) PPC and sentenced to death alongwith payment of
compensation of Rs.one lac to the legal heirs of deceased
in terms of Section 544-A Cr.P.C. or in default to undergo
six months S./. Whereas
> Appellant Quraish has been convicted under Section

302(b) PPC and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for
life and has been ordered to pay compensation of
Rs. One lac to the legal heirs of deceased in terms of
Section 544-A Cr.P.C., or in default to undergo six months
S.]. He has also been extended benefit of Section 382-B

CrP.C.

2. Brief facts leading to the filing of instant appeal
are that that on 6.9.2013, Mst.Mumtaza brought dead body of her
daughter deceased Mst.Mosamma to the police station in a
Datsun with the help of his co-villagers and reported the matter to
the effect that her deceased daughter Mst.Mosamma was married
to one Adalat Shah some seven years ago, who was presently
serving abroad and due to strained relations with the in-laws, her
deceased daughter was living with her parents. Further stated
that on the fateful day, she and her deceased daughter were on
their way to Gondal Town in a Tanga. On reaching near Mandi Mir
Baz Khan, no sooner both of them deboarded from the Tonga, all
of a sudden Qudrat Sher and Quaraish, both residents of their
village Jalsai, emerged and on the command of Quraish, Qudrat
Sher started firing at the deceased as a result of which, the
deceased was hit and died on the spot. Motive advanced by the

complainant for the gory incident was that deceased’s character
was allegedly aspersed by her father-in-law. Accordingly, both
the aforesaid accused were charged in the FIR No. 900, dated
6.9.2013 registered under Sections 302/34 PPC at P.S. Lahor,
District Swabi.

3. After arrest of accused Qudrat Sher and Quraish, they
were sent up for trial before the learned Additional Sessions
Judge, Lahor, District Swabi. The prosecution in order to prove its
case against the accused facing trial, examined 10 witnesses
including sole eye-witness i.e.complainant Mst.Mumtaza who
appeared as PW.10. After close of prosecution evidence, accused
facing trial also opted to be examined on oath as well as to
produce defence evidence. So both the accused stood examined
as DW.1 & DW.2 while Kamdar Khan appeared as DW.3 and
Shamsul Qamar as DW.4. Both the accused while appearing as
DWs categorically stated that at the relevant time, both were busy
“ploughing peanut produce” sic, in the fields of DW.4 Shamsul
Qamar. They both claimed innocence. DW.3 Kamdar Khan is
plying his Tonga in the said area as Taxi and at the relevant time
both complainant and deceased Mosamma were travelling in the
sameTonga.This witness stated that he witnessed the occurrence;

& he could identify the assailants if produced before him and that
the deceased was not done to death by the accused facing trial.
Similarly, Shamsul Qamar while appearing as DW.4 stated that
both the accused facing trial were working in his fields at the time
of occurrence as they had been with him from dawn to dusk. The
learned trial court after scanning the evidence adduced by the
prosecution, found the accused facing trial guilty for the
commission of offence charged with and recorded the aforesaid
conviction and sentence, vide judgment dated 24.5.2014, referred

to above. Hence the instant appeal.

5. Learned counsel for appellants argued that
presence of complainant at the venue of occurrence is not
proved; that medical report is in conflict with ocular account; that
prosecution has failed to prove motive; that complainant has
made dishonest improvements in her court statement, so is not a
reliable witness; that Tanga driver being impartial witness was not
examined by the police who was testified as defence witness. He
maintained that in the light of infirmities, impugned judgment of
the trial court is based on surmises and conjectures, hence is not

Sustainable.
6. Learned counsel for complainant stated that he is
under instructions of his client not to oppose the acquittal of the
appellants because complainant Mst.Mumtaza and Adalat Shah,
husband of the deceased, have pardoned the convicts/appellants

on the basis of compromise.

7. Learned AAG while opposing the appeal
contended that appellants remained absconder; that Kamdar DW
had been persuaded by the convicts/appellants to favour them.
He maintained that none of the DWs deposed that Ahmad, brother
of the complainant, has committed crime. He maintained that
though the husband and mother have pardoned the appellants
but father is abroad, hence the compromise is not complete, so

appeal is liable to be dismissed.

8. We have gone through the entire evidence
carefully and have also considered the submissions made by the

learned counsel for the parties.

9. According to prosecution version, deceased in the
company of the complainant was proceeding in a horse-cart to
Gondal Town. When they reached near Mandi Mir Baz Khan, in the

precincts of Village Jalsai, they deboarded from it. In the
meanwhile Qudrat Sher S/O Bahadar Sher R/O Village Jalsai and

Quraish S/O Sher, resident of same village, emerged, armed with

pistols. The moment they sighted the deceased Mst. Musamma,

Quraish ordered Qudrat Sher to kill her, on which Qudrat Sher

fired at her, as a result of which, she was hit and died on the spot.

The occurrence was also witnessed by many passer-byes. Motive

of occurrence is that her father-in-law aspersed her charactor. It is

pertinent to mention that Quraish is father-in-law of the deceased

whereas Qudrat Sher appellant is remotely related to them in the

sense that his sister is married to Ahmad, brother of the

complainant. She did not narrate in her report that the deceased

was brought to her house one day prior to the occurrence which

she narrated in the court statement. She did not alleged in her

first report that Qudrat Sher asked the Tanga Driver to stop and

let the deceased step down which she added in her court

statement. She stated in her cross-examination that six persons

were travelling in the Tanga out of whom 3 were male and 3 were

female including the deceased and the complainant but strangely

none of them made statement before the |.0. Though Kamdar

Tanga driver according to her own version, is their co-villager but

he too made no statement before the |,O. nor the |.0. recorded his
statement. Strangely, she after the occurrence left the dead body

of the deceased at the spot and rushed to the police station as per

her cross-examination which is an unnatural conduct of a mother.

She narrated in her cross-examination that on her way to Police

Station, she met Inaamullah her co-villager who took her to the

police station where she consumed 5 to 10 minutes. She came at

the spot after 20 to 30 minutes and found the dead body at the

spot which was already placed in the vehicle. She admitted in her

cross-examination that her brother Ahmad did not participate in

the condolence of the deceased who has strained relations with

her after the occurrence. She further admitted that her two

brothers are inimical towards her. She admitted that her brother

Ahmad is not available in the village after the occurrence. She

made startling disclosure in her cross-examination that her

brother Ahmad came to her and confessed that it is he who

committed the murder of deceased. She in the same breath

further stated that such statement was made to save the skin of

the accused facing trial. When she was confronted about

presence of Tanga Driver, she with volte-face stated that he

was not present at the time of report. She also knew

the shopkeepers whose shops are located
near the venue of occurrence but surprisingly none of them made

statement before the police nor accompanied her to the police

Station, despite the fact that they were present at the spot at the

time of occurrence as per her own admission.

10. The Investigating Officer Wafadar Khan S.I. P.S.

Lahor was examined as PW.3 who in cross-examination stated

that accused submitted application to the DPO, Swabi, about their

innocence which was marked to him. He recorded statements of

impartial witnesses, namely Ahmad Sher, Miskeen, Saddar,

Shamas Khan, Shams ul Qamar, Taj Akbar and Kamdar Khan

horse cart driver . He stated that according to their statements,

offence was committed by someone else who has not been

charged by the complainant. He further stated that in the light of

investigation on application of the accused, he has expressed his

opinion about their innocence. When this statement of the 1.0. is

put in juxtaposition with the admission of the complainant that

Ahmad, her brother, confessed his guilt before her that her

deceased daughter was done to death by him, it emerges without

any shadow of doubt that the appellants have been falsely

implicated by the complainant, reason based known to her.

Though as per statement of Fazal Manan S.I. PW.6, he took into
possession one 30 bore pistol vide recovery Memo Ex.PW.6/3 on
the pointation of accused Qudrat Sher but his cross-examination
shatters the veracity of the recovery when he deposed that the
pistol in question was in open condition and not sealed into
parcel. He further admitted that the pistol in question was not sent
to the FSL which slackness on his part is explained by him that
since no empty was recovered, hence despatch of pistol to the
FSL was a futile exercise. Firstly the |.0. was legally obliged to
seal the recovered pistol into a parcel in presence of witnesses
and sign the same. Lying of the crime weapon in an open
condition can be substituted at any time or may be planted
because it does not bear the signature of the |.0. and the date of
recovery. Similarly, report of the FSL was sine qua non to
establish that whether the crime weapon was in working condition
or otherwise. Thirdly, the recovery is also of no use to the
prosecution because according to the same witness it was
effected from joint house owned by Muhammad, Shaukat and
Zakir. It is not certain to whom this crime weapon did belong. It is
not safe to rely on such recovery for recording conviction in an

offence of capital punishment.
10

11. Statement of Doctor and Post-mortem report
transpires that entry wound bore charring marks while distance
between the deceased and the assailants as per site plan was 3
paces or 7 to 8 feet and the crime weapon is a pistol. Charring
marks cannot be caused from such a distance when the crime
weapon is 30 bore pistol and this opinion is forfeited by medical
jurisprudence of Modi, Tailor and Parikh. One may extend
concession on such minor discrepancies occurring in the
prosecution evidence because he may not be expected to give
inter se distance of deceased and the assailants with precision
and photographic exactitude provided the other prosecution
evidence is straightforward and trust worthy. However, when
such infirmities are seen in the light of the shady ocular account,

it also becomes doubtful.

12. In case Muhammad Ashraf Vs The State (2012
S C M R —- 419), PWs made improvements in their court
statements to bring their testimony in line with the medical
evidence and were not believed. Like-wise in the case of
Muhammad Rafique and others Vs The State and others ( 2010
S_C M R — 385), the august Supreme Court observed that no

explicit reliance can be placed on statement of a witness who
11

makes improvement in his statement before the Court, different

from the one recorded in the FIR and consequently, appeal was

accepted and accused was acquitted from the charge. Similarly,

in case titled Akhtar Ali and others Vs The State (2008 SC MR-

6), the august Supreme Court while reiterating the principle laid

down in the cases of Muhammad Rafique and another Vs The

State and others (1994 SCMR -1179), Qalab Ali through L.Rs and

others Vs SIPAHIA and others (2005 SCMR —- 1857), Rahab Vs
Muhammad Ismail & two others (2001 SCMR 1745), Rahab Vs
Muhammad Ismail and two others (2002 SCMR 233) and Khalid

Javed and another Vs The State (2003 SCMR - 1419), held that

once prosecution witness makes an improvement in his court
statement, he renders his testimony as unreliable because of
aspersion caused on her credibility for false improvements.
Hence his statement cannot be relied upon for recording or

maintaining conviction in an offence of capital punishment.

13. The principle of sifting of grains from the chaff in
criminal jurisprudence is well entrenched in our judicial system.
When case of appellants is analysed on the said principle, it is
found that the testimony of the complainant is belied by herself in

her cross-examination when she admits that her real brother
12

Ahmad did confess his guilt before her and after the occurrence,
he is not available in the village. It is also strange to note that the
motive is attributed to Quraish, father-in-law, but he himself did
not fire at the deceased. Rather it was third person, remotely
related to him, who was commanded to do away with the life of
deceased. At the cost of repetition, it is yet again surprising to
note that Kamdar, a natural witness of the occurrence who
allegedly brought complainant and the deceased in his horse cart
to the place of occurrence, has not been examined by the I.0 nor
was produced by the complainant before the police. Rather his
statement was recorded by the |.0. during re-investigation of the
case on application of accused in support of their innocence
wherein he exonerated the appellants. Though the shopkeepers
around the venue of occurrence were present at the time of
occurrence but none of them was examined. The statement of
complainant is not corroborated by any independent impartial
witness. None of the persons present at the place of occurrence
Supported prosecution version. All these deficiencies and
infirmities cast serious aspersion on the prosecution version. In
view of the tainted ocular account, mere recovery of weapon of

offence on the pointation of appellant which too is doubtful in its
13

character, cannot be accepted as a corroborative piece of
evidence because a tainted piece of evidence cannot be used for
corroboration of the tainted ocular account. No doubt in view of
the P.M. report, an innocent soul has been done to death but who
has committed the occurrence has not been established through
confidence inspiring, trust worthy evidence of un-impeachable

character.

14. Complainant alleged in her report, aspersion of
immoral activity by father-in-law of the deceased as motive of
occurrence. Though she made statement before the court too but
did not produce any corroborative piece of evidence in support
thereof which was essential in view of her unbelievable statement
regarding commission of crime. She did not utter a single word
that what was the nature of character of the deceased lady and
how she was ascribed of infidelity and in whose presence such
blame was thrown on her character. Though prosecution is not
required to establish the motive but once the same is set up it is
bounden duty of the prosecution to substantiate the same which
prompted the assailants to commit such a callous act. If the
prosecution fails to prove the motive, it would adversely affect the

veracity of the prosecution version. Same was the principle set in
14

Noor Muhammad Vs The State and another (2010 S C MR- 97).

In the report, in view of doubtful ocular account, recovery of crime
empty and crime weapon with matching report of the FSL being a
corroborative piece of evidence was not believed for maintaining
conviction and the appellant was acquitted by accepting his

appeal.

15. Though appellants have also testified on oath in
terms of section 340(2) Cr.P.C. and have also examined defence
witnesses in support of their innocence, more particularly Kamdar
Khan horse-cart driver has been examined as PW.3 but we do not
feel persuaded to dilate upon defence evidence in view of the
basic principle of dispensation of criminal justice “primarily it is
the bounden duty of the prosecution to prove its case beyond any
shadow of doubt.” Even if the defence evidence is not found to be
trust worthy, prosecution is still under obligation to prove its case
through natural, straightforward, trustworthy and confidence
inspiring evidence of unimpeachable character. It cannot earn
benefits from the weaknesses of the defence evidence. As such

the evidence led in defence need not be dilated upon.
15

16. The learned trial court has failed to appreciate the

glaring infirmities floating on the record and recorded conviction

which is the result of flagrant misreading and wrong appraisal of

evidence, causing grave miscarriage of justice.

17. It is cardinal principle of criminal justice that

prosecution is bound to prove its case beyond any shadow of

doubt. If any reasonable doubt arises from the prosecution case

which pricks the judicial mind, benefit of the same is to be

extended to the accused not as a matter of grace or concession

but as a matter of right. It is also settled principle of criminal

justice that there is no need of existence of so many doubts in the

prosecution case, rather single reasonable doubt arising from it,

may crumble the whole edifice of the prosecution case. This

analogy is well entrenched in our judicial system developed on

Anglo-Saxon law but stemming out of divine law ordained way

back fourteen centuries ago by The Holy Prophet (Peace be Upon

Him) when he commanded that it would be better to acquit 100

culprits than convicting one innocent man, which is respectfully

followed by the courts till date. Thus by applying the said

principle, in the light of above discussion, appellants are also

entitled to the benefit of doubt, barely floating on record.
16

18. For the reasons discussed above, this appeal is
allowed, the conviction and sentence recorded by the learned trial
court stand set aside and the appellants are acquitted of the
charge. They be set at liberty forthwith, if not required in any
other case.

19. The Murder Reference No.11/2014 is

answered in negative.
