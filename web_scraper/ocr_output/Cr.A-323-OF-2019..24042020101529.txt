AHMAD ALT, J:- The State through
Advocate General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has called in
question the acquittal of accused/respondent, in case
F.LR No. 182 dated 17.04.2015 under Section 302
PPC of PS Shinkiari, District Mansehra, vide
impugned judgment dated 11.03.2019 of the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-II, Mansehra by filing
instant appeal under section 417 (2-A) Cr.P.C.
2. Brief facts of the case are that the
wy complainant, Mst. Bibi Fatima wife of Said Khan,
reported the matter to the local police on 17.04.2015
at 15.30 hours, who reached the spot in village Khara
Battangi cum Makra Miana that she alongwith her

father-in-law, Ahmad Ali and sister-in-law Mst. Razia
Bibi was present in her cattle shed, while her
daughter, Mst. Sabeela Bibi, Mst. Hussan Bano,
sister-in-law of complainant and Mst. Dilshad Bibi
alongwith her husband Mir Umar  (accused/
respondent) residents of Kalas Richari, who visited
their home as a guests, were present in the house. She
heard fire shot from the side of her house at 11.00
hours and she alongwith Ahmad Ali and Mst. Razia
Bibi rushed towards the house; she saw Mir Umar
near the gate of her house having pistol in his hand
running outside; she entered the house and saw her
daughter, Mst. Sabeela Bibi lying dead in the door of
the room smeared with blood and blood was oozing
from back side of her head and right ear; the ladies
and the children present inside the house told that Mir
Umar had fired at Mst. Sabeela Bibi, her daughter and
ran away from the spot. However, no motive was
disclosed by the complainant in her report and she
charged the acquitted accused/respondent, Mir Umar
for ‘Qatl-i-Ama’ of her daughter, Mst. Sabeela Bibi.
The report of the complainant was recorded in shape
of ‘Murasila’ (Ex.PW 8/1)) and the instant case was

registered against him vide F.I.R (Ex.PA).
8) During investigation, PW-8 Shiraz Ahmad
SHO prepared injury sheet (Ex.PW 8/2) and inquest
report (Ex.PW 8/3) of deceased Mst. Sabila Bibi and
sent the dead body to the Rural Health Centre,
Shinkiari for postmortem. Subsequently, accused was
arrested on 30.04.2015 and I.O prepared his Card of
arrest (Ex.PW 8/4), who was absconding in the case
after commission of the alleged offence. During
personal search of accused/ respondent the SHO
recovered unlicensed 30 bore pistol alongwith
magazine containing four live rounds vide recovery
memo (Ex.PW 8/5) without number from his trouser
fold and after completion of investigation, complete
challan was submitted by him in the Court of Sessions
for trial against acquitted accused/respondent, Mir
Umar. Accused/respondent was charged for the
offence under section 302 PPC, but he pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial. In order to prove its case, the
prosecution examined fourteen witnesses and
statement of accused/ respondent Mir Umar was also
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein, he
denied the allegations of the prosecution leveled

against him in this case. However, he wished
not to appear on Oath as his own witness within the
contemplation of section 340 (2) Cr.P.C but he opted
to produce Sultan Muhammad son of Ghulam Nabi,
School Teacher alongwith Attendance Register for
17.04.2015, as defence witness, who was later on
examined in the Court as DW-1.

4. The learned trial Court, after hearing the
arguments of learned counsel for the parties, acquitted
the accused/respondent vide impugned judgment/
order dated 11/03/2019. Hence, the present appeal.

3: Arguments of the learned AAG heard.
Record perused.

6. Admittedly, the alleged occurrence was stated
to have taken place on 17.04.2015 at 11.00 hours in
the house of Mst. Bibi Fatima, complainant, situated
in village Khara Battani cum Makra Miana. The
report of the complainant was recorded by the SHO in
the shape of ‘Murasila’ (Ex.PW 8/1) at 15.30 hours at
the spot, situated at a distance of 3/4 kilometers from
police station Shinkiari, who reached there, on receipt
of information about the occurrence. Of-course, the
complainant had not witnessed the occurrence as she

at the time of alleged occurrence was present in her
cattle shed alongwith her father in law, Ahmad Ali
and sister-in-law, Mst. Razia Bibi. However, in her
report she mentioned that her daughter Mst. Sabeela
Bibi was present in her house alongwith Mst. Hussan
Jan, wife of brother of husband of the complainant
alongwith Mir Umar, acquitted accused/respondent
and his wife Mst. Dilshad Bibi, who came there as
guests. In the report the occurrence was stated to have
witnessed by ladies and children present in the house
but their names were not disclosed in the F.LR.
During trial, the prosecution examined Mst. Fatima
Bibi, complainant as PW-6 and Mst. Sobia, minor
daughter of complainant, aged about 10 years as an
eyewitness of the occurrence. Admittedly, the name of
the sole eyewitness, Mst. Sobia, produced before the
trial Court as PW-7 was not mentioned in the F.LR,
however, presence of Mst. Hussan Bano and Dilshad
Bibi wife of accused/respondent Mir Umar was
disclosed by the complainant in her report. Moreover,
the complainant also introduced Mst. Sidra her other
daughter as eyewitness of the occurrence in her court
statement, however, she was not produced before the

Court and abandoned being unnecessary. The
complainant stated that she was informed about the
occurrence by her daughters Mst. Sobia (PW-7) and
Mst. Sidra, abandoned PW.

7. It is settled law that ocular account in such
cases plays a decisive and vital role and once its
intrinsic worth is accepted and believed then the rest
of the evidence, both circumstantial and corroboratory
in nature, would be required as a matter of caution.
Conversely, once the ocular account is disbelieved
then no other evidence, even of a high degree and
value, would be sufficient for recording conviction on
a capital charge, as such, the probative value of the
ocular account in light of the facts and circumstances
of the case would be seen. In the light of the above
mentioned facts, this Court has to appraise the
evidence on record of the case. Firstly, the delay of
about four and a half hours in lodging the report could
not be explained satisfactorily by the prosecution
during evidence and what would be the significance
of such delay in the circumstances of the case. In the
report, nothing was mentioned about the said delay,
however, the complainant PW-7 in her statement

attempted to justify the delay by stating that her father
in law went to the police station to inform the police
about the occurrence, who consumed three hours and
when police came to the spot she lodged the report.
Anyhow, the explanation furnished for such delay is
not plausible because the police station is situated just
at a distance of 3/4 kilometers from the spot.
Moreover, it is not explained by the complainant that
why her father-in-law had not lodged the report to the
police when he went to the police station to inform
them about the occurrence. The facts narrated by the
complainant in her report at the spot could be
disclosed by her father-in-law to the police in the
police station. Delay of four and a half hours in
lodging the F.I.R. in the particular circumstances of
the case had assumed great significance as the same
could be attributed to consultation, taking instructions
and calculatedly preparing the report and that too
without mentioning the names of the eyewitnesses
therein. Non-explanation of the delay in making the
report to the police coupled with the improvements
and contradictions made by the eyewitnesses in their
statements had rendered their testimony doubtful and

unreliable which did not inspire confidence.
Secondly, the very presence of the alleged eyewitness,
Mst. Sobia on the spot at the relevant time was not
established because as per evidence of DW-1, Sultan
Ahmad, Head Master GPS Makra Miana produced by
the accused/respondent in his defence, both Mst.
Sobia Bibi (PW-7) as well as Mst. Sidra Bibi,
abandoned PW, were present in school on the eventful
day i.e. 17.04.2015. Thus, in such circumstances, the
learned trial Court has rightly held that neither Mst.
Sobia Bibi (PW-7) alleged eyewitness of the
occurrence was present at the spot nor she witnessed
the occurrence. Thirdly, the prosecution has failed to
produce other major female inmates/women folks i.e.
Mst. Hussan Bano etc of the house, who were stated
to have present at the relevant time, and they were
abandoned being won over. However, the obvious
inference which could be drawn in the peculiar facts
and circumstances of the case is that the occurrence
was an unseen occurrence, as such, other female
inmates of the house refused to stand as a witness to
depose falsely against the accused/respondent.

8. It is the settled principle of justice that on

acquittal an accused person earns twofold innocence.
Moreover, the standard and principle of appreciation
of evidence is entirely different from that in a case of
conviction. The findings of the trial Court could only
be reversed by this Court in its appellate jurisdiction,
when the same are found perverse, fanciful, arbitrary
or based on misreading and non-reading of material
evidence causing miscarriage of justice. The minute
analysis of the entire evidence on record, suggests that
the occurrence had not taken place in the mode and
manner as alleged by the prosecution and the presence
of the eyewitness could not be establish from any
independent source, therefore, her deposition could
not be relied upon for safe administration of justice.
Reliance can be placed on 1995 SCMR 127, 2015
SCMR 1142, 2017 SCMR 2002, 2017 SCMR 2007,
and 2017 SCMR 1710.

9. In view of above discussions, it is crystal clear
that the case of the prosecution is full of doubts and
the statements of the complainant and eyewitness are
contradictory, which create serious doubts about the
mode and manner of the occurrence and veracity of
the testimony furnished by the alleged eyewitness. As

such, the learned trial court has rightly acquitted the
10

accused/ respondent and its judgment does not need to
be interfered with by this Court in its Appellate
jurisdiction, particularly, when no appeal has been
preferred by the complainant party.
10. It is well settled law that even a single doubt,
if found reasonable, would entitle the accused person
to acquittal and not a combination of several doubts.
Reliance is placed on case titled Ghulam Qadir Vs.
The State (2008 SCMR 1221), wherein, it has held
that:

“It needs no reiteration that for the

purpose of giving benefit of doubt to

an accused person, more than one

infirmity is not required, a single

infirmity crating reasonable doubt in

the mind of a reasonable and prudent

mind regarding the truth of charge-

makers the whole case doubtful.

Merely because the burden is on

accused to prove his innocence it does

not absolve the prosecution to prove

its case against the accused beyond

any shadow of doubt in this duty does

not change or vary in the case.”
Reliance is also placed on case law reported as 1992
SCMR_ 366, 1995 SCMR 1345, 1995 SCMR_ 1730,
2004 SCMR 215, 2004 SCMR 140, 2009 SCMR
230, 2013 SCMR 192, 2016 SCMR 2073, 2016 PSC

(Criminal) 612, 2017 PSC (Criminal) 14, 2017 S C

M_ R 986 and 2019 P.Cr.L.J. 337.
11

11. Accordingly, for the reasons _ stated
hereinabove, this Court is of the considered view that
the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond any
reasonable doubt against the accused/respondent,
hence, the instant appeal being devoid of substance is

hereby dismissed in /imine.
