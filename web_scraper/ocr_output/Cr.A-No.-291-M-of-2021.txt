JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD IJAZ KHAN, J.- Through this

single judgment, we intend to decide the instant
criminal appeal No. 291-M of 2021 as well as
the connected criminal appeal No. 323-M of
2021, as both these appeals arise out from one
and the same impugned judgment of conviction
and sentence dated 12.10.2021 passed by the
learned Judge Special Court/Sessions Judge

Malakand at Batkhela.

NAWAB (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Naz Khan
2. As per contents of FIR
complainant Naik Rehman, Post Commander of
Levy Post Hassan Khan Shaheed, Alladhand
along with other levy official laid a barricade at
Alladhand road near Sharab Dara when in the
meanwhile they stopped a motorcar bearing No.
6432/Police coming from Amandara side.
Driver of the car disclosed his name as
Bilal Ahmad, while the person sitting in its front
seat has been identified as Shakeel Ahmad.
During search of the motorcar, the levy officials
recovered a white colour plastic /ying beneath
the front seat on mate which contained five
packets of Chars total weighing 6000 grams.
Further search of the accused/appellant namely
Bilal Ahmad led to recovery of three service
cards of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police
Department. Both the accused were arrested on
the spot and the motorcar was also taken in
possession. ‘Murasila’ was drafted which was
reduced into FIR No. 84 dated 12.09.2020
registered under section 9 (d) of The Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic Substances

Act 2019 (hereinafter referred to as “The K.P.

NAWAB (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad fjaz Khan
CNSA Act of 2019”) at Levy Post Alladhand
District Malakand.

3. The accused were summoned by
the learned trial Court and charge was framed
against them on 07.01.2021, to which they
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The
prosecution was invited to produce its evidence,
who accordingly examined five (05) witnesses
in support of their case, Thereafter, statements
of accused were recorded under section 342
Cr.P.C and on conclusion of trial in the case, the
accused/appellants were convicted vide the
impugned order/judgment dated 12.10.2021 of
the Court of learned Special Court/ Sessions
Judge Malakand at Batkhela and were sentenced
as follows;

“Under section 9 (d) K.P CNSA to 10
years rigorous imprisonment each along
with fine of Rs. 500,000/- (five hundred
thousand), or in default thereof they were
ordered to undergo six months simple
imprisonment. The appellants were also
extended benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C.

The appellants have now
challenged the aforesaid judgment by filing the

instant criminal appeals before this Court.

NAWAB (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad jaz Khan
4, Arguments of learned counsel for
the appellants as well as learned Astt: A.G.
appearing on behalf of the State were heard in
considerable detail and the record perused with
their able assistance.

5. As per the prosecution’s case
information were received by the complainant
namely Naik Rehman, Post Commander who
appeared as PW-3 that on the day of occurrence
he along with police personnel namely Mohib
Gul, Shamrooz Khan, Sikandar Wahab and
driver Mubarak Hussain were present at the
barricade laid at Alladhand road near Sharab
Dara when in the meanwhile a motorcar
bearing No. 6432/Police came from Amandara
side at 18:30 hours which was signaled to stop.
Driver of the car disclosed his name as Bilal
Ahmad whereas the person sitting on the front
seat disclosed his name as Shakeel Ahmad.
Both were de-boarded from the car and on

search of the motorcar beneath the front seat on

NAWAB (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad tjaz Khan
mate a plastic bag comprising five packets of

Chars was recovered which were wrapped up in
a white colour polythene bag and 10 grams
sample from each packets were separated for
the purpose of FSL through knife and these
samples were sealed in parcels No. 1 to 5
whereas the remaining stuff was sealed in
parcel No. 6 and the same were affixed with the
monogram of “M.T”. On further search of the
appellant namely Bilal Ahmad three service
cards of the Police Department were recovered
from his side pocket and the same were sealed
in parcel No. 07 and thereafter both the
accused were arrested and only the ‘Murasila’
was sent to the police station through the driver
namely Mubarak Hussain for registration of the
FIR.

6. First of all this Court will
determine that as to whether on the available

evidence prosecution has been able to establish

NAWAB ($.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
the conscious knowledge of either of the
appellants or of both of the appellants jointly.
As stated in the ‘Murasila’ that recovery
of alleged contraband was made from
beneath the left side of the front seat on mate
“op Cue Pa CS Cu Cid Gb ULL” so, this
possibility cannot be excluded that the same
may be kept by co-appellant who was front-
seater namely Shakeel Ahmad and the appellant
namely Bilal Ahmad was not in the knowledge
of the same and this possibility is equally
applicable to the case of appellant namely
Shakeel as the packets of Chars may be kept by
Bilal Ahmad and the co-appellant Shakeel was
not in the knowledge. So when once both
possibilities could not be excluded then the
prosecution was bound to prove the conscious
knowledge of either of the appellants or of both
the appellants jointly but the prosecution has

not been able to discharge their burden. In the

NAWASB (S.B} Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
case of “Muhammad Noor & others v/s The

State” reported as 2010 SCMR_ 927, the

Hon’ble Apex Court has held that it is
permissible to look into the object of the
legislature and find out whether, as a matter of
fact, the legislature intended anything to be
proved except possession of the article as
constituting the element of the offence. Even if
it is assumed that the offence is absolute, the
word "Possess" appearing in the section 6
connotes some sort of knowledge about the
things possessed. So we have to determine what
is meant by word."possess" in the section. It is
necessary to show that the accused had the
article, which turned out to be narcotic drugs. In
other words the prosecution must prove that the
accused was knowingly in control of something
in the circumstances, which showed that he was
assenting to being in control of it. It is not

necessary to show in fact that he had actual

NAWAB (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
know] edge of that which he had. In the case of
“Shahzada v/s The State” reported as 2010
SCMR 841 it was also held by the Apex Court
that no such evidence has been led by the
prosecution to prove the above aspects of the
case so as to make the appellants responsible
for the commission of the crime along with the
Driver. If the property would have been lying
open within the view of the appellants or they
knew the placement of the property then the
situation would have been different. In such a
situation, the appellants were required to
explain their position, as required under Article
122 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 and
without such explanation their involvement in
the case would have been proved. As the
property was not within their view and they had
no knowledge of the placement of the property,
therefore, they cannot be held responsible and

in joint possession of the property with the

NAWAB (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
Driver. In another case the august Supreme
Court of Pakistan reported as 1997 SCMR 345
in such like situation, the other fellow of the
truck driver sitting with him has been absolved
of the charge in view of the possibility that he
might had no, knowledge of the presence of
heroin in the truck.

7, Secondly this Court will determine
that as to whether on the available evidence the
prosecution has been able to establish the safe
transmission and safe custody of the samples
and remaining stuff from the spot to the police
station. It may be noted that in the ‘Murasila’ it
has not been specifically mentioned that the
seizing officer namely Naik Rehman who
appeared as PW-3 has handed over the parcels
of samples to PW Mubarak Hussain for their
transmission to the police station and the same
remained a mystery till date that as to whether

the seizing officer has ever handed over the

NAWAB (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad faz Khan
-10-

samples to Mubarak Hussain or not and as to
whether the seizing officer has retained these
samples with himself or not as the said
Mubarak Hussain has not been produced by the
prosecution in the Court who was the most
relevant and natural witness to answer these
questions, and as such because of his non-
production the prosecution has itself created
these lacunas in its case, which goes deep into
the roots of the prosecution case.

8. Similarly, the seizing officer
namely Naik Rehman who appeared in the
Court as PW-3 has also not uttered a single
word that as to whom he has handed over the
samples and his whole statement is completely
mum regarding handing over of the samples to
PW Mubarak Hussain or even to the Muharir of
the police station namely Zakir Hussain. In this
view of the matter, the seizing officer and other

police personnel who were present on the spot

NAWAB (8.8) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
Ty,

-ll-

have not been able to establish on record that as
to how they have made the transmission of the
samples and the remaining stuff from the spot
to the Mall Khana of police station.

9. The separation of the samples by
the seizing officer namely Naik Rehman also
become doubtful as under the Rules the
abbreviation of the name of the seizing officer
is to be the monogram on the parcels of the
samples, which in the present case should have
been “N.R” ie. Naik Rehman, however, the
parcels which were received in the laboratory
are bearing the monogram “M.T.” which is the
abbreviation of name of Muhammad Tufail
who happened to be the Investigating Officer of
this case and who appeared as PW-5, however,
he in his Court statement has never stated that
he separated the samples from the recovered
stuff and inscribed the monogram on the parcels

as “M.T” and rightly so as per the prosecution

NAWAB (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-12-

case it was the seizing officer namely Naik
Rehman who separated the samples. In this
view of the matter, the separation of the
samples from the recovered stuff by the seizing
officer namely Naik Rehman appears to be not
a true statement specially when he in his court
statement has categorically mentioned that he
was present on the spot, when Muhammad
Tufail reached there and on his directions he
started the investigation, so, in such state of
affairs the prosecution has not been able to
establish on record that as to who has separated
the samples from the recovered contraband
leaving behind many doubts of their safety qua
their transmission and custody.

10. In narcotic cases it is the duty of
prosecution to establish the seizure of
contraband, taking of samples from the
recovered stuff, their safe transmission from the

spot to the police station and from police station

NAWAB (S.8) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-13-

to the F.S.L and the safe custody of remaining
contraband, however, as stated above that in the
present case Mubarak Hussain who brought the
‘Murasila’ from the spot to the police station
was not produced before the Court whereas the
seizing officer namely Naik Rehman (PW-3) in
his examination-in-chief has not uttered a single
word that as to whom he handed over the
parcels of separated samples of contraband and
as such the unbroken chain has not been
established by the prosecution. This silence
assume more significance when it is seen that
the alleged parcels are not bearing the
monogram of abbreviation of the seizing officer
(“N.R”) rather it bears the abbreviation of name
of Investigating Officer ic. Muhammad Tufail
(“M.T”) and as such the prosecution has not
been able to prove that as to who separated the
samples from the recovered stuff and that as to

who has dispatched or taken them to the police

NAWAB (S.8) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-14-

station, which failure of the prosecution is fatal
for their case. In the case of “Qaiser Khan
v/s The State” reported as 2021 SCMR 363,
the Hon’ble Apex Court has held that the
record shows that there is nothing on the
record to establish that to whom the alleged
recovered narcotics were handed over in the
police station for safe custody. The Forensic
Report reflects that the alleged narcotics were
received in the laboratory on 11th December,
2012 but evidence on the record is silent that
where the same remained for two days i.e.
from 9th December, 2012 to 11th December,
2012. Similarly evidence regarding safe
transmission of alleged recovered narcotics to
the laboratory for chemical analysis is also
missing. The law in this regard is settled by
now that if safe custody of narcotics and its

transmission through safe hands is not

NAWAB (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-15-

established on the record, same cannot be
used against the accused. Similarly, the
Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of “Zubair
Khan v/s The State” reported as 2021 SCMR
492 has also held that prosecution produced
two witnesses, namely, Basharat Hussain,
Inspector as (PW-1) and Abdul Ghani as (PW-
2); the former furnished comprehensive
details regarding interception of vehicle along
with the contraband and investigative steps
taken thereafter whereas the former
corroborated his deposition, however, the
prosecution unredeemedly failed to establish
the essential link of safe transmission of
samples to the office of Chemical Examiner as
despite opportunity Abdul Hakeem, EC/B-131
who had delivered the samples failed to enter
the witness box, leaving the entire case in the
lurch. Same view has also been reiterated by the

Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of “Abdul

NAWAB (8.8) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-16-

Ghani_& others v/s The State & others”

reported as 2019 SCMR 608 by holding that it
is not denied that Ali Sher, H.C. who had
delivered the samples of the recovered
substance at the office of the Chemical
Examiner had also not been produced during
the trial so as to confirm safe transmission of
the samples of the recovered substance.

11. In this case, admittedly as the
seizing officer was Naik Rehman, therefore, the
parcels bearing the samples should have been
carrying the monogram of his name i.e. “N.R.”,
however, the same were inscribed with “M.T”
which is the abbreviation of the name of the
Investigating Officer Muhammad Tufail and
thus this very fact by itself doubted and
destroyed the whole prosecution case right from
its inception as it has never been the case of
prosecution that Muhammad Tufail has

separated the samples and sealed them in

NAWAB (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-17-

parcels. Such flaw was found fatal by the
Hon’ble Apex Court in the case “ Khtar Iqbal
ws The State” reported as 2015 SCMR 291 by
observing that the most important factor in that
connection, which compounded all those doubts
and raised a big question mark upon the
veracity of the prosecution's case against the
appellant, was that after allegedly recovering
the contraband substance from the boot of the
motorcar driven by the appellant the parcels of
the recovered substance were sealed with a
monogram reading as SJ and it had been
disclosed by Mati-ur-Rehman (P.W.2) before
the learned trial Court that the said monogram
belonged to one Sameen Jan Inspector who was
not even posted at the relevant Police Station at
the time of the alleged recovery from the
appellant and as a matter of fact at the said time
the said Inspector was serving at a Police

Station in Quetta. Mati-ur-Rehman (P.W.2) had

NAWAB (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-18-

not been able to advance any explanation
whatsoever as to why the recovery officer
namely Assistant Director Rehmat had not put
his own monogram on the seals of the parcels
prepared by him and as to why he had used the
monogram of some other officer who was not
even posted at the relevant Police Station at the
relevant time. Similarly, this Court in the case

of “Usman Shah v/s The State” reported as

2022 YLR 821 has also reiterated the same
stance by holding that the seizing officer while
appearing before the Court as PW-2, deposed in
his Court's statement that after recovery of
contraband, he separated samples for FSL
purpose and sealed in parcels Nos.1 to 8 and
remaining stuff in parcel No.9 with a
monogram of "MK" which, he categorically
admitted that same is not pertained to his name
and in-fact the same stands for Mukhtiar Khan,

S.I., who was stated to be present with the

NAWAB (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-19-

complainant. The alleged recovery seems to be
doubtful, rather hints at something to be planted
by complainant, because said Mukhtiar Khan SI
was never cited as a witness during proceedings
in the instant case. This witness, after few
moments, in his cross-examination contradicted
his own statement by deposing that "Mukhtiar
Khan S.I. was present in the P.S. at that very
time. The MK monogram was lying with me in
the official van", Be that as it may, the Seizing
Officer, pursuant to spy information, should
have been required to have his own monogram
with the letters "RK" in his possession to have
strengthened and substantiated his version, but
he disrupted the episode in a casual manner.

12, As in the present case the
Investigating Officer was Muhammad Tufail,
who was IHC (Incharge-Head-Constable) was

not an “authorized officer” within the meaning

NAWAB ; (8.8) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
Wy

-20-

of section 2 (e) of The K.P. CNSA Act which is

reproduced below;-

Authorized Officer means,-

(G3) an officer of the Directorate General, not
below the rank of [Inspector], authorized by
the Director; or

(ii) (ii) a Police officer/official not below the
rank of Sub-Inspector, authorized by the
Regional Police Officer

The aforesaid definition of the
“authorized officer” states that any officer of
the Directorate General not below the rank of
Inspector who is duly authorized by the
Director or a police officer/official not below
the rank of Sub-Inspector, who is duly
authorized by the Regional Police Officer. In
the present case section 2 (e) (ii) would be
applicable, however, on record there is no
authorization of Regional Police Officer in
favour of Muhammad Tufail, IHC is available
on file so as to term him as an “authorized
officer” within the meaning of section 2 (e) (ii)

of The K.P. CNSA Act 2019 and as such the

NAWAB (S.8) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-21-

investigation conducted by him lacks statutory
backing and sanctity.

13. It is also settled law that for
giving benefit to an accused, it is not essential
that there should be many grounds for the
same, even a single doubt is sufficient to
extend its benefit to an accused person as it is
the cardinal principle of criminal
administration of justice that let hundred
guilty persons be acquitted but one innocent
person should not be convicted. In the case of

“Muhammad _Mansha v/s The State”

reported as 2018 SCMR_ 772, the Hon’ble
Apex Court has held that while giving the
benefit of doubt to an accused it is not
necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating doubt. If there is a
circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in
a prudent mind about the guilt of the accused,
then the accused would be entitled to the
benefit of such doubt, not as a matter of grace
and concession, but as a matter of right. It is

based on the maxim, "it is better that ten guilty

NAWAB (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
%

-22-

persons be acquitted rather than one innocent
person be convicted". Reliance in this behalf

can be made upon the cases of Tariq Pervez v.

The State (1995 SCMR 1345), Ghulam Qadir
and 2 others v. The State (2008 SCMR_1221),
and Muhammad Zaman v. The State (2014

SCMR_749. In the case of “Muhammad
Akram v/s The State” reported as 2009 SCMR
230, the Hon’ble Apex Court has held that it is
an axiomatic principle of law that in case of
doubt, the benefit thereof must accrue in favour
of the accused as matter of right and not of
grace. In the case of “Tariq Pervaiz v/s The
State” reported as 1995 SCMR_ 1345 , the
Hon’ble Apex Court has held that the concept
of benefit of doubt to an accused person is
deep-rooted in our country. For giving him
benefit of doubt, it is not necessary that there
should be many circumstances creating doubts.
If there is a circumstance which creates
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the
guilt of the accused, then the accused will be
entitled to the benefit not as a matter of grace

and concession but as a matter of right.

NAWAB (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-23-

14, For what has been discussed
above, this Court is of the firm view that the
prosecution has failed to prove its case against
both the accused/appellants beyond reasonable
doubt; therefore, their conviction cannot be
maintained. Resultantly, while extending them
the benefit of the doubt, both these connected
criminal appeal bearing No. 291-M and 323-M
of 2021 are allowed and the impugned
order/judgment of conviction and sentence
dated 12.10.2021 recorded by the learned trial
Court is set aside and consequently the
appellants namely Shakeel Ahmad and Bilal
Ahmad are acquitted of the charges levelled
against them. They be released forthwith from

the Jail, if not required in any other case.

15. These are reasons for my short orders
of even date.
