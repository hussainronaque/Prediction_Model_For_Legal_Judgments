JUDGMENT

SAHIBZADA_ASADULLAH, J.- Through this single
judgment, we shall decide the instant Cr.A No. 166-
P/2020 titled “Shabbir Hussain vs the State” and the
connected Cr.R No.21-P/2020 titled “Dr. Wazim Khan
Vs. Shabbir Hussain & another’ as both the matters
are arising out of one and the same judgment dated
18.02.2020 passed by the court of learned Additional
Sessions Judge-ll/MCTC, Peshawar delivered in case
FIR No. 860 dated 11.08.2013 under section 302 PPC

of police station Hayatabad, Peshawar, whereby the

appellant Shabbir Hussain was convicted under
section 302 (b) PPC as Tazir and sentenced to
undergo imprisonment for life and to pay Rs.4,00,000/-
(rupees four lac) as compensation to legal heirs of the
deceased within the meaning of section 544-A CrPC or
in default whereof to further suffer simple
imprisonment for six months. Benefit of section 382-B

CrPC was extended to the convict/ appellant.

2. Precisely stated facts of the case, as spelt
out from the contents of murasila are that on
11.08.2013 complainant Dr. Wazim Khan reported the
matter in Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar to
the effect that he alongwith his paternal nephew
Murtaza Khan was preset in front of the main gate of
his house whereas, the deceased Azam Khan came
out of the house and was proceeding in the street and
when reached opposite to the house of appellant
Shabbir Hussain, the appellant, who was standing in
the gate of his house armed with pistol, started firing at
his brother with an intention to kill him as a result of
which his brother received firearm injuries while the
appellant decamped from the spot. Complainant
alongwith his nephew shifted the deceased then
injured to the hospital but on the way, he breathed his
last. The accused/ appellant was charged for the

commission of offence hence, the present FIR.
3. On conclusion of the investigation, challan
was submitted before the learned trial Court, where the
appellant was summoned and on appearance, was
provided copies of the relevant documents u/s 265-C
CrPC and thereafter, he was formally charge sheeted
to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. After
commencement of the trial, the prosecution produced
as many as (15) witnesses. Thereafter, the statement
of accused-appellant was recorded under section 342
CrPC wherein, he posed innocence, however, neither
he opted to produce defense evidence nor wished to
be examined on Oath u/s 340(2) Cr.PC. On conclusion
of the trial, the learned trial Court convicted and
sentenced the appellant in the manner quoted to

above, hence, the instant appeal.

4. The learned counsel for the parties heard
at length alongwith learned AAG and with their

valuable assistance, the record was scanned through.

5. The heart wrenching incident led to the
death of deceased Azam Khan. The dead body was
shifted to the Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar
where the complainant reported the matter. The injury
sheet and inquest report were prepared and the dead
body was sent for the postmortem examination. The

Investigating Officer, after receiving copy of the FIR,
visited the spot and on the pointation of the witnesses,
prepared the site plan. During spot inspection, blood
through cotton was collected from the place of
deceased. The Investigating Officer on the same very
day visited the hospital where, he collected the OPD
chit, which contains the details of arrival of the dead
body to the hospital. After the commission of offence,
the accused/appellant went into hiding and it was after
considerable long time that he was arrested and faced
the trial. On conclusion of the trial, the learned trial
court was pleased to convict and sentence him vide

the impugned judgment.

6. The learned court after concluding the
trial, held the appellant responsible for the murder of
deceased Azam Khan and as such, he was convicted
and sentenced. As in the instant case, single accused
is charged, so this court is to see as to whether the
approach of the learned trial court was in accordance
with law and, as to whether the learned trial court
succeeded in appreciating the evidence on file. True
that single accused by itself is not a circumstance to
determine the fate of the said accused, rather under all
circumstances, the prosecution is to bring on record
independent, disinterested and reliable evidence,
coupled with the fact that the learned trial court must

take extra care while determining the involvement of
accused in the incident. True that in case of single
accused substitution is a rare phenomenon, but that is
not the rule of thumb, rather under all circumstances,
both, the prosecution and the court is burdened with
liability to proceed with the matter in accordance with

law.

7. The points for determination before this
court are as to whether the incident occurred in the
mode & manner and at the stated time; as to whether
the witnesses were present on the spot at the time of
incident and in the hospital at the time of report; as to
whether the medical evidence supports the case of the
prosecution and, that the prosecution succeeded in
proving the alleged motive and, as to whether the
prosecution succeeded in bringing home guilt against

the appellant?

8. There is no denial to this fact that the
unfortunate incident claimed the life of the deceased
and the matter was promptly reported, but to ascertain
as to whether the incident occurred in the stated
manner, we deem it essential to go through the report
of the complainant and his court statement and the
statements of the eye witness as well. It is evident
from the record that the incident occurred at 17:40

hours whereas, the matter was reported in Hayatabad
Medical Complex (HMC) at 18:05 hours within the
shortest possible time. The record further tells that the
deceased was brought to the hospital and, in that
respect, an OPD chit was collected where the name of
the deceased is mentioned alongwith the time of his
arrival as 17:57 hours. The said chit was collected by
the Investigating Officer and is duly exhibited. In order
to appreciate the presence of the witnesses at the time
of incident, we deem it essential to go through their
statements. The complainant was examined as PW-8
and the eye witness as PW-9. The complainant stated
that on the day of incident, he alongwith the eye
witness was present in the street, infront of his house,
that the deceased was proceeding towards the house
of the appellant and on reaching near the house of the
appellant, the appellant fired at him with a pistol in his
possession; that the accused decamped from the spot,
they rushed to the deceased, the dead body was
shifted to the hospital and the matter was reported.
The eye witness confirmed the report of the
complainant and he also explained the circumstances
in which the unfortunate incident occurred. There is no
denial to this fact that both the parties, during the days
of incident, were residing in the same street and, that it
was the complainant and the eye witness, who shifted

the dead body of the deceased from the spot to the
hospital. As both the parties were not related to each
other and as nothing was brought on record showing
their ill-will, so the presence of the witnesses near the
place of incident or at the place of incident at the
stated time is natural. The learned counsel for the
appellant submitted that as the occurrence took place
on the 3 day of Eid, so under all circumstances, the
witnesses were present in their village and after
receiving information regarding the tragic incident, they
rushed to the hospital where the complainant reported
the matter. The submissions of the learned counsel for
the appellant do not appeal to a prudent mind, as it is
not necessary that all people living in cities must go to
their villages to celebrate Eid, rather it depends upon
every individual. As it is not the rule of universal
application, as the behavior of people vary from person
to person. True that the complainant belonged to
village Bakhshoo Pull but that by itself would not
determine the availability of the complainant and the
eye witnesses in Hayatabad on the day of incident. As
the witnesses confirmed that they were present near
their house and nothing was brought on record which
could persuade the presence of witnesses in their
village. The learned counsel sought the indulgence of
this court on the ground that as Mst. Zubaida was

present in the house, so it was essential for the
Investigating Officer to record her statement regarding
the presence of the witnesses in Hayatabad, on the
day of incident. We are not convinced that the non-
recording of the statement of Mst. Zubaida by the
Investigating Officer would be fatal for the prosecution.
As admittedly, Mst. Zubaida was present inside the
house, so her examination or on-examination would
hardly be a circumstance to determine the truthfulness
and veracity of the witnesses. As admittedly, Mst.
Zubaida is the closest relative of the deceased and the
witnesses, so she cannot be given such preference,
rather she enjoys equal relationship with the
deceased. We are to see the presence of the eye
witnesses on the spot and we are to see as to whether

they succeeded in establishing their presence.

9. The dead body was hurriedly shifted to
the hospital and it was the complainant, who reported
the matter and interestingly, an OPD chit was collected
where the arrival of the dead body to the hospital is
entered and the same confirms that the deceased was
brought to the hospital at 17:57 hours i.e. within 17
minutes of the incident. This aspect of the case is
further confirmed by the doctor, who mentioned the
time between the injury and death as immediate and,
time between death and postmortem as 1 to 4 hours.

The scribe was examined as PW-2 (Fazal Rabbani SI),
who explained that on the day of incident, he was
patrolling in the area and, that on receiving information
regarding the arrival of the dead body to the hospital,
he rushed to the hospital where, the complainant
reported the matter. He also confirmed that he
prepared the injury sheet and inquest report and
thereafter, the dead body was sent for postmortem
examination. True that the eye witness did not verify
the report of the complainant, but that by itself would
not be sufficient for holding that the eye witness was
not present with the complainant when he reported the
matter. It was agitated that had the complainant and
eye witness been present with the dead body, then
they would have identified the dead body of the
deceased before the police at the time of report and
before the doctor at the time of postmortem
examination. The learned counsel for the appellant
wanted to convince that the witnesses were procured
from their village and, that the matter was reported
after consultation and deliberation. We are not in a
happy mood to accept the submissions of the learned
counsel, as admittedly, the dead body identifiers
belonged to Hayatabad, and were living in another
street. If the identifiers had come from the village of the
complainant, then the submissions of the learned

counsel would prevail and then this court might take
10

another view but as the identifiers were from the same
locality where the incident occurred, so we are
convinced that the complainant, the eye witness and
the identifiers collectively shifted the dead body of the
deceased to the hospital soon after the incident. There
is no denial to this fact that the parties were having no
previous ill-will, rather it was an altercation between
the appellant and the deceased few days earlier to the
incident that took the life of the deceased. As the
parties were not related to each other and as the
witnesses had no grudge with the appellant, so the
bonafide of the witnesses cannot be doubted and, that
no malafide can be attributed to the witnesses. As
admittedly, the house of the appellant and that of the
deceased as well as the witnesses were situated in the
same street, therefore, the stated time cannot be
disputed. As admittedly, the incident occurred on the
3 day of Eid, so under ordinary circumstances,
people are always present in their houses or in the
area, where they live. The witnesses remained
consistent regarding the manner in which the incident
occurred and, regarding the manner in which the
matter was reported, the defence failed to shatter their
credibility and, this court is inclined to hold that the
incident occurred in the stated manner and at the

stated time. The attention of this court was brought to
11

the inquest report where instead of using the word
“pistol” the word firearm (Asliha-e-Atasheen) is used
and the learned counsel wanted to convince that while
reporting the matter, the complainant disclosed that
the appellant was armed with a pistol, if the inquest
report was made on the information of the
complainant, then instead of firearm the word pistol
would have been used. We are not convinced with
what was agitated, as on one hand, there is no ill-will
between the parties, so question of false implication
does not arise whereas, on the other, the dead body
was shifted to the hospital soon after the incident and
the report was made within the shortest possible time,
so the circumstances by itself are sufficient to hold that
the witnesses were present and that the incident

occurred in their immediate presence.

10. The Investigating Officer of the case
namely; Sabir Khan DSP (retired) was examined as
PW-12, who confirmed that after receiving copy of the
FIR, he visited the spot and on the pointation of the
witnesses, prepared the site plan. The site plan shows
the houses of the appellant and that of the complainant
in the same street. The site plan further discloses the
inter-se distances between the accused, the deceased
and the eye witnesses. It was argued that when the

eye witness and the deceased were present at a
12

distance of 70 feet then how the witness identified the
‘appellant and, how they saw a pistol in the hands of
the appellant. An attempt was made to convince that
from such a long distance the witnesses could hardly
identify the weapon in possession of the appellant.
True that the motive was not known to the eye witness
and, that he did not caution the deceased regarding
the intention of the appellant, but as the motive is
given as an altercation between the appellant and the
deceased few days before the incident, so the witness
was not of the view that the appellant would kill the
deceased, as intention of the appellant could not be
gathered by the eye witness may be for the reason
that the altercation was not so harsh. If the
complainant had any malafide to charge the appellant,
then on the very day of the incident, he would have
introduced the motive, but as he was not in the
knowledge of the altercation between the appellant
and the deceased, so he kept silent and soon
thereafter, he submitted an application, that too, on the
same day regarding the motive between the parties. It
is pertinent to mention that the eye witness was
examined on the very day of the incident by
Investigating Officer and he explained the motive and
he confirmed that few days earlier to the incident an

altercation took place between the appellant and the
13

deceased. As single accused is charged for the tragic
incident, so in case of single accused substitution is a
rare phenomenon. Reliance can be placed on “Imran
Mehmood Vs the State and another” (2023 SCMR

795), which reads as follows: -

“However, it is by now a well-established
principle of law that mere relationship of
the prosecution witnesses with the
deceased cannot be a ground to discard
the testimony of such witnesses out-
rightly. If the presence of the related
witnesses at the time of occurrence is
natural and their evidence is_ straight
forward and confidence inspiring, then the
same can be safely relied upon to award
capital punishment. Learned counsel for
the appellant could not point out any
reason as to why the complainant has
falsely involved the appellant in the
present case and let off the real culprit,
who has brutally murdered her father and
uncle. Substitution in such like cases is a
rare phenomenon.”

11. The time of incident, the time of report and
the time of examination of the dead body of the
deceased by the doctor, are the circumstances, which
confirmed that all the events happened in quick
succession and, there was hardly an occasion for the
witnesses to consult and deliberate as admittedly, the
parties were not related to each other and, as

admittedly, no previous ill-will was brought on record
14

either by the complainant or by the Investigating
Officer, so the defence could not convince that either
the witnesses were interested or they had a motive for
false implication. True that the witnesses are closely
related to the deceased, but under no circumstances,
they can be held as interested and inimical towards the
appellant. There is no cavil with the proposition that
the statement of a close relative can be taken into
consideration provided it rings true and provided it
inspires confident. As both the witnesses were cross-
examined on material aspects of the case and as
nothing detrimental to the prosecution case could be
extracted from their mouths, so mere relationship of
the witnesses with the deceased can hardly be a
ground to label them as interested witnesses. An
interested witness is one who has an interest to falsely
implicate and, who has an interest to substitute the
real culprit for the innocent. As on one hand, the
defence could not convince that the complainant had a
malafide to charge and on the other the prosecution
could not collect any evidence regarding malafide on
the part of the complainant, so this court is confident in
holding that it was the accused/appellant, who killed
the deceased and that the witnesses were present at
the time of incident and at the time of report in the

hospital.
15

12. The medical evidence is in harmony with
the ocular account and, that the witnesses remained
consistent on this particular aspect of the case. True
that the deceased received an entry on right of his
neck with its exit to the left but equally true that it alone
cannot determine the presence of the appellant and
the presence of the deceased at the stated time. An
attempt was made to convince that in case the
deceased was proceeding towards the appellant, then
he would have received an injury from his left with its
exit on his right, but the defence ignored that the
deceased received three firearm injuries and apart
from the injury on the neck, he received another injury
on his shoulder which travelled from left to right. As the
defence could not convince that what injury was
received by the deceased at the earliest and which of
the injury thereafter, so this court can presume that
after receiving the injury on his shoulder, the deceased
changed his direction and it was in that eventuality that
he received an injury on the right of his neck with its
exit on the left. We cannot ignore that man is not a
statue, rather every individual reacts differently in
particular circumstance of each particular case. The
possibility cannot be excluded that after receiving
firearm injury on his shoulder, the deceased wanted to

rescue himself and, that while struggling so, he
16

received an injury on his neck. The medical evidence
fully supports the ocular account. True that medical
evidence is confirmative in nature and in absence of
trustworthy eye witnesses account, the same can
hardly be a circumstance for holding the accused
responsible, but as in this particular case, the
witnesses remained consistent, so the medical
evidence can be taken into consideration. As is held in
case titled “Ansar and others Versus The State and
others”, (2023 SCMR 929), which is reproduced
herein below: -

“All these witnesses of the ocular
account remained consistent on each
and every material point qua the date,
time, mode, manner of the occurrence
and the locale of the injuries on the
person of the deceased and the injured
PW. Sarfraz (PW-3) had sustained
injuries during the occurrence, which
have fully been supported by the
medical evidence given by Or.
Muhammad Tariq, who appeared as PW-
8. The testimony of this injured PW as
well as the stamp of injuries on his
person clearly proves his presence at
the place of occurrence. These PWs
remained consistent on each and every
material point inasmuch as they made
deposition according to the
circumstances surfaced in this case,
therefore, it can safely be concluded that
the ocular account furnished by the
prosecution is reliable, straightforward
and confidence inspiring. These PWs
were subjected to lengthy cross-
examination but their testimonies could
not be shattered.”

13. The motive is given as an altercation

between the deceased and the appellant few days
17

earlier to the incident. True that while reporting the
matter, the complainant did not disclose the motive,
rather it was the eye witness, who disclosed the same
and the complainant submitted an application on that
very day for that very purpose. The learned counsel
wanted to convince that the silence of complainant
regarding the motive is a circumstance, which confirms
his absence from the spot, but we are not persuaded,
as the complainant had no malafide so, he did not
mention the same. Had the complainant an intention to
falsely implicate, then he was at liberty to introduce a
motive of his choice. Even otherwise, the statement of
the eye witness was recorded under section 161 CrPC
on that very day and he explained the motive to the
Investigating Officer. There is no cavil with the
proposition that absence or weakness of motive is not
a ground for the acquittal of an accused, rather the
same can be taken into consideration to determine as
to what sentence should be awarded. To be more
specific, the absence or weakness of motive can be
pressed into service for determining the quantum of
sentence and, that was what the learned trial court did
while awarding the sentence. . Reliance could be
safely placed on judgment of the Apex Court in case
title “Mazhar Abbas alias Baddi Vs the State” (2017
SCMR 1884), which is reproduced as under;
“It is well settled by now that once the
prosecution alleges a motive and fails to
prove the same during the trial, the same
can be taken as a mitigating circumstance
while deciding the quantum of sentence of
a convict. Therefore, this appeal is partly
allowed and the sentence of death awarded
to the appellant is altered to imprisonment
for life”.

14, The appellant remained absconder for
considerable long time till his arrest on 26.10.2015,
and he failed to explain the same. True that
abscondance alone is not sufficient for holding an
accused guilty, but once the prosecution succeeds in
brining home guilt against the accused, then
abscondance can be taken into consideration. As in
this particular case on one hand, the witnesses
established their presence on the spot, whereas, on
the other, his long unexplained abscondence is a

circumstance which can be taken into consideration.

15. The cumulative effect of what has been
stated above, leads this Court to an irresistible
conclusion that the prosecution succeeded in bringing
home guilt against the appellant and that the learned
trial court has rightly appreciated the evidence on file.
The impugned judgment is well reasoned, which calls
for no interference. The instant criminal appeal being

bereft of merit is hereby dismissed.
19

16. Now diverting to Cr. R No.21-P/2020, the
complainant has asked for enhancement of the
sentence, so we deem it appropriate to re-assess the
evidence and to see as to whether the awarded
sentence needs the ends of justice or that the same
calls for interference. As the parties were not related to
each other and as there was no blood feud between
the parties, so it is for the prosecution to tell that what
permitted the appellant to kill the deceased and that
what was the cause of killing. As admittedly, the
parties had no blood feud and as disclosed by the
witnesses the incident occurred because of an
altercation took place between the two few days
earlier. As the witnesses failed to explain that what
was the cause of altercation and that at which time the
deceased and appellant exchanged harsh words, so in
our understanding the prosecution failed to convince
the real cause of kill. As the motive right from the
beginning till the end is uncertain and as the witnesses
could not explain the same, nor the investigating
officer could collect any independent evidence in that
respect, so we are conscious that the cause of killing
was even not known to the witnesses. When such is
the state of affairs, then this Court is confident in
holding that the approach of the learned trial Court was

correct and is strictly in accordance with law. When the
20

like circumstances arise, then the failure of motive or
its absence can be taken into consideration for
determining as to what sentence should be awarded,
as the appellant is convicted and sentenced to life
imprisonment, so in our understanding the uncertainty
of motive was the cause which persuaded the learned
trial Court to award the sentence. As in this particular
case the prosecution succeeded in bringing home guilt
against the appellant and as the real cause of killing is
shrouded in mystery, so the weakness or motive is a
circumstance which is to determine the quantum of
sentence and the learned trial Court has competently
exercised the discretion. The instant criminal revision

being bereft of any merit is hereby dismissed.
