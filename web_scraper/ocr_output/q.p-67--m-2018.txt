JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- Through instant petition
under section 561-A, Cr.P.C, petitioner Malak Muhammad
Naeem has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court for
quashing of order dated 29.09.2018 rendered by learned
Judicial Magistrate-I, Swat whereby case FIR No. 247 dated
15.04.2016 u/s 506, 148, 149 PPC, 15 A.A of P.S Banr,
District Swat registered on the report of petitioner has been

cancelled and accused respondents have been discharged.

2. Brief facts of the case are that petitioner produced
SMG Kalashnikov No. 25020104 with two chargers
containing 44 rounds and mobile phone Nokia having
Telenor SIM No. 03489305725 before police on 02.04.2016
and made a report to the effect that the accused respondents
alongwith 5/6 other unknown persons were demolishing
boundary wall of his ancestral property situated at Tarkashi

Shaheed. When he proceeded to the spot in the company of

Taemuves* (S.B) Hon’ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
“his relatives and tenants, the accused made their escape
| good, however, a young boy, he can identify him from his
face, was present inside a tent set up in their land, aimed his
Kalashnikov at them. They tried to snatch the Kalashnikov
| from the boy and during the struggle he was hit on his head
| by his own gun. He charged the above named accused and
their companions for making interference in his land.
Report of the petitioner was recorded vide DD No. 33 dated
; 02.04.2016. Being displeased for non-registration of FIR,
petitioner filed an application u/s 22-A, Cr.P.C before the
learned Justice of Peace who disposed of the same vide
order dated 13.04.2016 with directions to SHO to inquire
the matter in terms of section 156(3), Cr.P.C and if found
sufficient material then the FIR be lodged under the
relevant section(s) of law. On the following day of the
above order, complainant filed another application before
the learned Justice of Peace with the prayer for revising the
order dated 13.04.2014 as the same was not in conformity
with the verbal order of Court announced in the open Court
directing the SHO to register FIR as the inquiry proceedings
had already been completed. The learned Justice of Peace
marked the application to SHO concerned for compliance
within three days, as such, case vide FIR No. 247 dated

15.04.2016 u/s 506, 148, 149 PPC, 15 A.A was registered

Tajamwcs* (8.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

against the accused respondents at P.S Banr, District Swat.
The accused filed pre-arrest bail before the learned Sessions
Judge, Swat which was entrusted to learned Additional
Sessions Judge-VI, Swat for disposal. Ad-interim pre-arrest
bail was granted to accused by the said forum vide order
dated 18.04.2016 and notice was issued to petitioner and
State for 20.04.2016. Thereafter, the Inquiry Officer filed an
application dated 03.05.2016 for discharge of the accused
u/s 169, Cr.P.C which was forwarded/recommended by
SHO on 04.05.2016. Being aggrieved, the petitioner
challenged the application and recommendations of the
SHO before this Court through Q.P No. 40-M/2016 which
was disposed of vide order dated 02.11.2017 in light of
statement of learned counsel for accused and learned
Assistant A.G. that let the learned trial Court may proceed
with the matter in accordance with law. Lastly, Final Report
was put before the learned Magistrate for cancellation/
dismissal of the case FIR No. 247 dated 15.04.2016 u/s 506,
148, 149 PPC, 15 A.A of P.S Banr, District Swat lodged at
the behest of petitioner which was accepted vide order
dated 29.09.2018. Resultantly, the ibid FIR was cancelled
and the accused respondents were discharged, hence, instant

petition.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

Tams (S.B) Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

4. First of all, Cr.Misc. No. 234-M/2019 filed by
petitioner needs disposal wherein he has prayed for
substitution of Respondent No.1 “SHO, Police Station Banr,
District Swat” with “Judicial Magistrate-I, Swat”. The
application is allowed and “SHO, Police Station Banr,
District Swat” mentioned at Serial No.1 in the panel of
respondents be read as “Judicial Magistrate-I, Swat”. Office
is directed to make necessary entries to this effect in the

relevant record with red ink.

3. The present case revolves around powers of
Investigating Officer under section 169 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure, 1898 which reads.

169. Release of accused when evidence deficient. If,
upon an investigation under this Chapter, it appears to the
officer incharge of the police-station, or to the Police-
officer making the investigation that there is not sufficient
evidence or reasonable ground or suspicion to justify the
forwarding of the accused to a Magistrate, such officer
shall, if such person is in custody, release him on his
executing a bond, with or without sureties, as such officer
may direct, to appear, if and when so required, before a
Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence
on a police-report and to try the accused or send him for
trial.

Under the above provision, the Investigating
officer is only empowered to release a person in custody, on
executing a bond, if he reaches to a conclusion that
sufficient evidence or reasonable ground are not available to
justify forwarding accused to Magistrate. It means that

release of an accused would be valid only when the

Tepmmats* (S.B) Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

prosecution evidence is deficient otherwise it is the
exclusive jurisdiction of trial Court to decide the guilt or
innocence of any person charged with allegation for
committing an offence. The record transpires that another
FIR No. 220 dated 02.04.2016 u/s 324, 427, 147, 148, 149,
452 PPC has been registered against the petitioner side at
the instance of complainant Fazal Subhan (herein accused
Respondent No.6) in the same police station Banr alleging
that the complainant side alongwith other 19/20 unknown
accused came to the spot and beat him with kicks, fists and
~ butt of Kalashnikov thereby causing injury on his head
whereafter they demolished his residential room and
boundary wall. Placing both the FIRs in juxtaposition with
each other, it is evident that both the parties have levelled
counter allegations against each other besides they also
claimed adverse title and possession of the land where the
occurrence has taken place. Even the Investigating Officer
has made controversial the Kalashnikov produced by
petitioner at the time of lodging the report and has declared
the same as case property of case FIR No. 220 lodged by
accused in view whereof section 15 A.A was added in said
FIR. However, copy of recommendations dated 02.07.2016
of the learned APP (annexed with Cr.Misc. No. 197-

M/2019) is available on file wherein it has been opined that

Tapmecs? {S.B) Hon’ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

| section 15 A.A was wrongly inserted in FIR No.220. The
| said opinion has been approved by learned DPP with

directions to 1.0 for making compliance of the directions
| regarding deletion of the mentioned penal section from the

FIR and to res-submit the case before the Court.

, 6. The moot questions for resolution before this
' Court are whether the Investigating Officer could determine
| guilt or innocence of the accused and secondly, whether the
impugned order of the learned Magistrate by discharging
the accused and cancellation of FIR in the attending
circumstances of the case was in accordance with law or
otherwise. As regards the first question, job of Investigating
Officer is confined only to collection of evidence which has
to be placed before competent Court. Thereafter the Court
has the authority and obligation to form an opinion about
guilt or innocence of accused person and to adjudicate upon
according to the evidence. In the present case, the
Investigating Officer has straightaway declared the accused
respondents as innocent by evaluating the defence evidence
with the request to learned Magistrate for their discharge
and cancellation of FIR. Such determination of guilt or
innocence of a person by police officer investigating the
case were beyond his powers because if opinion of police

officer declaring an accused innocent be casually accepted

Talamulos* (8.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

for acquittal of an accused, then such practice on behalf of
Court would also justify conviction of an accused on the

basis of opinion of Investigating Officer. Reliance in this

regard is placed on “Muhammad Ahmad (Mahmood
Ahmad) and others Vs. The State” (2010 SCMR 660)

wherein it was observed that:

It may be mentioned here, for the benefit and guidance
of all concerned, that determination of guilt or
innocence of the accused persons was the exclusive
domain of only the Courts of law established for the
purpose and the said sovereign power of the Courts
could never be permitted to be exercised by the
employees of the police department or by anyone else
for that matter. If the tendency of allowing such-like
impressions of the Investigating Officers to creep into
the evidence was not curbed then the same could lead
to disastrous consequences. If an accused person could
be let off or acquitted only because the Investigating
Officer was of the opinion that such an accused person
was innocent then why could not, on the same
principle, another accused person be hanged to death
only because the Investigating Officer had opined
about his guilt.

Further reliance is placed on “Muhammad
Arshad and others Vs. The State and others” (PLD 2011
S.C 350) wherein the same view was reaffirmed. Thus, in
light of above judgments, it was not the domain of the
Investigating Officer to determine innocence of the accused
respondents on the basis of defence evidence keeping in
view the attending facts and circumstances of the present

case.

Temas’ (S.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
8. Adverting to the second question with regard to

legality of the impugned order, the learned Magistrate has

discharged the accused respondents and cancelled the FIR
, by holding that the time of occurrence mentioned in both
| the FIRs is different though the same had been lodged

i regarding the same occurrence; that there is delay in

lodging the report incorporated in FIR No. 247 suggesting

consultation and deliberation on behalf of petitioner; that

| the petitioner and his associates are aggressors who have
| tried to possess the property by making interference and
| that petitioner has acted like J.O by taking into possession
| the material from the spot which were the case property in
! case FIR No. 220. Admittedly, both the parties have leveled
| counter allegations against each other in their respective
| reports. The question with regard to aggressor and
| aggressed upon has always been considered by superior

| Courts as a valid ground of further probe in bail matters,

therefore, prior to recording of pro and contra evidence, the
learned Magistrate has fallen in an error by holding that

complainant and his associates were aggressors more

particularly when the parties are in dispute regarding the
_ land in which the occurrence had taken place. The learned
| Magistrate has recorded the above observations at a

premature stage when determination of the points so

Tapmnce’ (S.B) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

resolved needed verification through statements of the
witnesses during the trial proceedings, thus, the learned
Magistrate has recorded his findings for acquittal of the
accused though his job was to weigh the evidence of both
the sides through application of independent mind for
reaching at a just conclusion for rejecting or accepting the
request of Investigating Officer regarding discharge of the
accused respondents. Thus, in the circumstances when there
was a set of prosecution evidence on one side and defence
evidence on the other, it was for the trial Court to weigh
_ both sets of evidence on judicial scale to rely on one and
discard the other, as such, section 169, Cr.P.C do not confer
any such power upon the Investigating Officer to evaluate
the defence evidence and prefer it over prosecution
evidence to declare the accused innocent. Reliance is placed
on “Asal Mar Din Vs. Farid Gul and 2 others” (2014

PCr.LJ 197 Peshawar) wherein it has been held that:

Investigating Officer can release an accused in his
custody when sufficient evidence was lacking or there
were no reasonable grounds of suspicion against
accused. The said power is not identical to the power of
preponderance of evidence to be exercised by the trial
Court. When there is a set of prosecution evidence on
one side and defence evidence on the other, the trial
Court is empowered to weigh both sets of evidence on
judicial scale to rely on one and discard the other. The
theme of section 169, Cr.P.C. did not admit any such
power of Investigating Officer to evaluate defence
evidence of an accused and prefer it over the
prosecution evidence to declare him innocent.

9. Admittedly, FIR No. 247 has been registered on
the directions of the learned Justice of Peace whereas the
accused respondents have already been released on bail. In
such circumstances police could not proceed under section
169, Cr.P.C for discharge of the accused when both the
parties had relied upon their respective evidence in light
whereof it was the domain of trial Court to determine the
iguilt or innocence of both the parties in view of counter
allegations after recording pro and contra evidence,
therefore, the order of learned Magistrate while discharging
the accused and cancelling the FIR at the very initial stage
was not in accordance with law. Rel: “Hafeez Ahmad Vs.
Malik_M._Anwar_and_others” (1987 P Cr. L J 450

Lahore).

10. In light of the above discussion, this Court in
exercise of its jurisdiction under section 561-A, Cr.P.C is of
the opinion that not only the Investigating Officer has acted
beyond his powers by determining innocence of the accused
respondents through evaluation of defence evidence but the
learned Magistrate has also committed an illegality by
cancelling the FIR and discharging the accused while
concurring with the Investigating Officer by analyzing both
sets of evidence without application of judicious mind.

Resultantly, instant petition is allowed and the impugned
