SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J:- This criminal
appeal is directed against the judgment dated
22.02.2021, of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-l, Swabi at Lahor, delivered
in case FIR No.342 dated 27.06.2009
registered under section 302 PPC. at police
station Yar Hussain, District Swabi, whereby
the appellant has been convicted under
section 302 (b) PPC and sentenced to death
as “Tazir’ and to pay Rs.1,000,000/- as
compensation to legal heirs of the deceased
within the meaning of Section 544-A Cr.P.C
recoverable as arrears of land revenue or in
default whereof to suffer six months SI. He

shall be hanged by the neck till declared
dead. However, benefit of section 382-B
Cr.P.C was extended to the appellant.

2. Precisely stated facts of the case, as spelt
out from the record, are that on 27.06.2019,
complainant Mst.Parveen (P.W.7), with the
help of co-villagers, brought the dead body of
her deceased husband, namely Sher Afsar
Khan to police station Yar Hussain, in a private
Suzuki and reported the matter to the effect
that on the eventful day, she was present in
her house and her husband was present in the
thoroughfare in front of his Hujra, near their
house, meanwhile, she heard commotion and
firing. When she came out of her house, she
saw her husband lying dead in a pool of blood,
in front of the main gate, of the Hujra. She also
saw the convict/appellant, armed with pistol
running from the spot making aerial firing. On
the report of complainant, present case was
registered against the appellant. Motive behind
the occurrence was stated to be dispute over
women folk between the parties.

3. On arrest of the appellant and completion
of investigation, complete challan was

submitted before the court of competent
jurisdiction. The accused was charge sheeted
to which he did not plead guilty and claimed
trial. As such the learned trial court was
pleased to direct the prosecution to produce its
evidence. In order to prove its case,
prosecution produced and examined as many
as 12 witnesses, whereafter statement of the
accused was recorded wherein he professed
his innocence, but did not opt to record his
statement under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. On
conclusion of trial, the learned trial court held
him guilty and as such he was convicted and
sentenced vide impugned judgment, hence,
the instant criminal appeal has been preferred
by appellant/convict, while Murder Reference
No.04-P/2021, was also sent by the learned
trial Court under Section 374 Cr.P.C, for
confirmation of death sentence awarded to the
appellant/convict, which shall also be disposed
of along with instant criminal appeal through
single judgment.

4. The learned counsel for parties as well as
the worthy Additional Advocate General, were
heard at length and with their valuable

assistance the record was scanned through.
5. It was the unfortunate day of June, in the
year 2009, that the deceased received firearm
injuries and the matter was reported by the
complainant, in the local police station, where
she charged the appellant for the murder of
the deceased. The FIR was chalked out and,
thereafter the injury sheet and inquest reports
were prepared and the dead body was sent for
post mortem examination. The investigating
officer, after receiving copy of the FIR, visited
the spot and on the pointation of the
complainant and the eyewitness prepared the
site plan. During spot inspection, though no
blood was collected from the spot, but an
empty of .30 bore pistol was taken into
possession and the investigating officer also
observed bullet marks on the main gate of the
Hujra of the deceased. The accused, after the
occurrence, went into hiding till his arrest on
27.01.2019. It is pertinent to mention that on
the day of incident, the minor son of the
deceased also recorded his statement under
section 161 Cr.P.C with the investigating
officer and on 02.07.2009 he was produced

before the court of competent jurisdiction,
where his statement under section 164 Cr.P.C
was recorded. As the motive was disclosed as,
the strained relation of Mst.Sumbal with her in-
laws and that she, during the days of incident,
was residing in the house of the deceased, so
she also recorded her statement with the
investigating officer under section 161 Cr.P.C
and also her statement was recorded before
the court of competent jurisdiction under
section 164 Cr.P.C. On arrest of the appellant,
a .30 bore pistol was recovered from his
personal possession, containing five live
rounds, and in that respect, a separate FIR
bearing No.54 dated 27.01.2019, under
section 15 AA/13 AO KPK, was registered.
The accused faced trial and on conclusion of
the trial, was convicted and sentenced vide the
impugned judgment.

6. The learned trial court convicted the
appellant by taking into consideration the
evidence on file and the statements of the
witnesses. True that while reporting the matter
the complainant did not disclose herself to be
the eyewitness of the incident, but she

disclosed that on hearing commotion she
came out of the house, she saw _ the
convict/appellant leaving the spot, by making
aerial firing and the dead body of her
deceased husband was lying in a pool of
blood.

7. This court is to see as to whether the
learned trial court properly appreciated the
evidence on file and as to whether the
impugned judgment is based on solid reasons,
that too, collected from the record of the case.
True that in the instant case single accused is
charged and substitution in the like cases is a
rare phenomenon, but it is not the rule of
thumb that under all circumstances, an
accused charged _ singularly, be held
responsible for the murder, rather the courts of
law are under the obligation to apply its’
judicial mind to the evidence on file and to look
for independent corroboration. The case of a
single accused under no circumstances will
absolve the courts of law from searching
independent corroboration, in the collected
evidence, rather it increases the liability of
both i.e. the investigating agency and the

courts of law, to be more vigilant and to apply
extra care, so that miscarriage of justice could
be avoided.

8. The points for determination before this
court are, as to whether the incident occurred
in the mode, manner and at the stated time; as
to whether the complainant saw the accused
while leaving the scene and that the
eyewitness was accompanying the deceased;
that the medical evidence supports the case of
the prosecution; that the prosecution
succeeded in establishing the disclosed
motive and as to whether the witnesses
remained consistent on the material aspects of
the case. This is for the prosecution to prove
that the witnesses were present at the time of
incident, more particularly, the eyewitness
Saifullah and to show that the prosecution
succeeded in bringing home guilt against the
appellant. This court is to see as to whether
the appellant deserved to be awarded the
normal penalty of death and that the learned
trial court was justified to award the same. In
order to answer the formulated questions/
points, we deem it appropriate to scan through

the record and to re-visit the statements of the
witnesses, as in that eventuality this court
would be in a position to reach to a just and
proper conclusion. As in the instant case, the
most important witnesses are the complainant
and the eyewitness, so we would like to go
through their statements. The complainant
was examined as P.W.07, who stated that on
the day of incident while present in her house,
she heard commotion followed by firing; that
she rushed to the street and saw the appellant
duly armed leaving the spot; that she found
the deceased lying in a pool of blood
struggling between life and death; that the
dead body was picked up from the spot, put on
a cot and was shifted to the Police Station in a
Suzuki Pick Up; that she reported the matter,
which was duly verified by one Sarbali Khan.
The eyewitness was examined as P.W-08,
who supported the version of the complainant
and disclosed that on the day and at the time
of incident, he was present with the deceased
and that it was in his presence that the
convict/appellant attracted to the spot,
altercated with deceased and, thereafter fired

at the deceased. The witnesses were cross-
examined on the material aspects of the case,
more particularly, the manner in which the
incident occurred and the manner in which the
complainant rushed out from her house, saw
the appellant and reported the matter. The
complainant was put to searching cross-
examination, but nothing detrimental from her
mouth could be extracted to favour the
appellant. As the complainant and _ the
eyewitness are the most relevant and
important witnesses, so their conduct plays a
vital role in the determination of the instant
matter and for that matter, we deem it
essential to go through the record of the case
and also the material collected by the
investigating officer. The site plan shows the
house of the complainant near to the place of
incident and also Hujra of the deceased. As
the incident occurred in front of the Hujra of
the deceased and the house of the
complainant was situated in the street
intervening by few houses, so we are to see
as to whether from such a distance the
commotion could be heard and that from such

a distance the complainant was capable to
10

witness the aerial firing made by the appellant.
True that while in house, the place of incident
was not visible to the complainant, but the
same is visible if one comes out from the
house. The complainant disclosed that after
hearing commotion and firing she rushed to
the street and saw the appellant making aerial
firing, while leaving the spot. The site plan
depicts that after firing at the deceased the
appellant left the spot and it was at point 2-A,
of the site plan, that the complainant noted his
subsequent presence while making aerial
firing and the place was visible to the
complainant. The presence of the complainant
in the vicinity cannot be doubted, as the house
of the complainant was in the same street,
where the incident occurred and_ the
availability of the complainant in her house, at
the time of incident was nothing, but natural.
The complainant was asked regarding the
manner in which the dead body was shifted to
the police station and regarding the persons
who witnessed the incident, the complainant
explained the circumstances and disclosed

that as it was the time of panic, so she could
11

not remember the names of all those, who
were present on the spot, at the time of
incident. Even otherwise, it was nothing, but
natural that on hearing fire shots many more
people would have attracted to the spot and
that it was with the help of the co-villagers that
the dead body of the deceased was shifted
from the spot to the police station. Much was
submitted regarding the presence of the
eyewitness i.e. Saif Ullah, that the complainant
did not mention his name while reporting the
matter, so his presence on the spot is neither
established, nor inspires confidence. This is
surprising that when the complainant
appeared before the learned trial court it was
the defence who examined her regarding the
presence of the eyewitness, and that it was in
an answer to a question that she disclosed,
that on the day of incident the deceased left
the house in the company of the eyewitness,
and that the eyewitness was present with the
deceased at the time of incident. We cannot
ignore that the reply was made by the
complainant when a specific question was

asked by the defence, regarding the presence
12

of the deceased and the eyewitness. An
attempt was made to convince this court that
the eyewitness was introduced at a belated
stage, that too, with ulterior motives, but we
are not satisfied with what was submitted. As
the complainant knew the fact that on the very
day of the incident the eyewitness got
recorded his statement and after few days of
the incident, his statement under section 164
Cr.P.C was recorded before the court of
competent jurisdiction, so the silence of the
complainant regarding his presence, while
recording her examination-in-chief, is not
detrimental to the prosecution case, as
admittedly both the statements of the
complainant were and are available on the file.
The record tells that during the days of
incident, the eyewitness was hardly 8/9 years
of age, if not present, then the complainant
would avoid the risk of naming him, as she
knew that being of tender age, he would not
resist the searching cross-examination, and
even would fail to convince the investigating
officer in that respect, but when she named

him as the eyewitness and when_ the
13

statement of the eyewitness was recorded, no
inference other than the one, can be drawn
that the witness was present on the spot when
the unfortunate deceased was done to death.
The presence of the eyewitness has further
been established from his statement recorded
under section 161 Cr.P.C, on the day of
incident and from his statement recorded
under section 164 Cr.P.C few days after the
incident. There were ample opportunities for
the complainant to substitute the eyewitness,
but she did not and her conduct speaks, that
what she told was correct and natural. The
eyewitness was examined as P.W-08, several
questions were put to this witness, to see his
reliability, but his testimony could not be
shattered and he remained consistent on the
material aspects of the case. He remained
consistent to what he saw and he explained
the manner in which the two altercated and the
appellant fired. The witnesses remained
consistent throughout and no contradiction
could be pointed out and no inconsistency
could be noted. It does not matter that the

name of the eyewitness was not mentioned in
14

the report. The same would be decisive only if
the statement of the witness was not recorded
on the day and soon thereafter. As admittedly,
the statement of the eyewitness was recorded
by the investigating officer, on the day of
incident and few days after the incident by the
court under section 164 Cr.P.C. The question
regarding non-mentioning of the name, of the
eyewitness, in the FIR has been answered by
this court in case titled Rahat Ali Vs. The
State and another (2018 PCr.LJ 206), which
reads as follows:-

“The significant piece of evidence
before us is the statement of Abdar Ali
Shah (PW-7). As stated earlier, he has
not been named in the FIR to be the
eye-witness of the occurrence.
Learned counsel for the appellant
during the course of his arguments
vehemently urged that since the name
of Abdar Ali Shah is not mentioned in
the FIR, therefore, his testimony is not
worth consideration. He was of the
view that the safer course is to keep
his statement out of consideration.

We know that as a rule of
prudent, Courts should keep out of
consideration the testimony of a
witness whose name is not figured in
the FIR but it is not a rule of law. The

Court in a fit case may go for
15

consideration of the testimony of such
a witness if it is corroborated with
other reliable evidence on record and
in this view of the matter, we would see
as to whether Abdar Ali Shah has
witnessed the occurrence and, if so, up
to what degree it has_ been

corroborated.”
9. True that the incident was reported to the
police, after a delay of 45 minutes, but the
delay was duly explained by the complainant,
and she disclosed the manner in which the
dead body was picked up and shifted to the
Police Station. Apart from the witnesses, the
prosecution case is further supported by the
recovery of an empty from the spot and the
bullet marks on the outer gate of the Hujra of
the deceased. The presence, of all concerned,
is supported by the fact that the Hujra of the
deceased was situated adjacent to the place
of incident and the presence of the deceased
and the eyewitness was natural. True that
during spot inspection the investigating officer
failed to collect blood from the spot, but
keeping in view the seat of injury, there was
every possibility that the blood would have

travelled to the body cavity, and when so,
16

there was hardly an occasion for the
investigating officer to collect the same from
the ground. The credibility of the complainant
could not be shattered, despite searching
cross-examination and even the defence failed
to attribute, any mala fide to the complainant,
to charge. The record is silent regarding the
abhorrence of the complainant against the
appellant and even nothing was collected by
the investigating officer, that could help in
understanding that the charge against the
appellant was based on mala fide and that the
real culprits were let off. As in the instant case
single accused is charged, so substitution is
the rarest phenomenon. As is held in case
titled Imran Mehmood Vs. The State (2023
SCMR 795) which reads as under:-

“Learned counsel for the appellant
could not point out any reason as to
why the complainant has _ falsely
involved the appellant in the present
case and let off the real culprit, who
has brutally murdered her father and
uncle. Substitution in such like cases

is a rare phenomenon.”
10. Right from the beginning the conduct of

the complainant remained natural, despite the
17

fact that she had the opportunities to introduce
the witnesses of her choice and to pose
herself as the eyewitness of the incident, but
she did not, rather she narrated the events as
it occurred. An attempt was made to convince,
that when the complainant was not the
eyewitness and that when the eyewitness was
not named in the FIR, then in that eventuality
the witnesses lose their credibility and their
testimony cannot be taken into consideration.
The learned counsel forgot that at the time of
incident the complainant was inside the house,
but on hearing commotion and firing she
rushed to the street and saw the appellant
making aerial firing while running from the
spot. As it was soon after the incident that she
noticed the presence of the appellant on the
spot with a pistol in his hand, making firing, so
the subsequent events by itself are sufficient
to tell that the appellant had hand in the affair
and he was rightly held responsible for the
murder of the deceased. We cannot forget that
the law has taken note of the like
circumstances and = also the — criminal

jurisprudence was conscious of the same. The
18

concept of ‘Res gestae’ plays a vital role in
criminal jurisprudence and the same has time
and again been pressed into service by the
superior courts of the land, more particularly,
the apex court. In the like circumstances, we
are benefited from a case titled Muhammad
Ijaz Vs. The State (2023 SCMR 1375), which
reads as follows:-

“Ghulam Akbar, complainant (PW-14)
and Abdul Latif (PW-15) had heard the
gunshot and witnessed the petitioner
fleeing away from the place of
occurrence after commission of
offence while he was having a pistol
in his hands. Evidence of these
witnesses is in the nature of waj
takar, the probative strength of which
rests in the doctrine of res gestae in
view of Article 19 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984. The _ said
doctrine of res gestae is based upon
the assumption that statements of
witnesses that constitute part of the
res gestae are attributed a certain
degree of reliability because they are
contemporaneous making them
admissible by virtue of their nature
and strength of their connection with
a particular event and their ability to
explain it comprehensively. These
prosecution witnesses were residents

of the same locality, therefore, their
19

presence at the place of occurrence

was natural.”
11. True that the eyewitnesses are closely
related to the deceased, but equally true that
mere relationship of the witnesses with the
deceased would hardly be a ground to
disbelieve the witnesses or to label them
interested witnesses. As the defence could not
succeed in bringing on record, that the
witnesses had a previous grudge with the
appellant or that the parties were having blood
feud, so in such eventuality, the relationship of
the witnesses with the deceased would hardly
be a ground for disbelieving them. Once the
witnesses are found trustworthy and
confidence inspiring, then their statements
cannot be brushed aside and conviction can
be based even on the testimony of related
witnesses. The witnesses cannot be termed as
interested witnesses, as no mala fide was
attributed to them and nothing was brought on
record that the witnesses under all
circumstances wanted to implicate the
appellant in the death of the deceased,
knowing the fact that he was innocent. When

such is the state of affairs, we are not ready to
20

accept the submissions of the learned
counsel, and even the testimony of an
interested witness can be taken into
consideration, once it comes to surface that
the witness had no mala fide to charge. In the
like circumstances we are benefited from the
judgment of the apex court reported as
Muhammad Ijaz Vs. The State (2023 SCMR
1375), which reads as follows:-

“There is no denial to this fact that
these PWs were related with the
deceased but the law in this regard is
well settled. A related witness cannot
be termed as an interested witness
under all circumstances. A _ related
witness can also be a natural witness.
If an offence is committed within the
presence of the family members then
they assume the position of natural
witnesses. In case, their evidence is
reliable, cogent and _ clear, _ the
prosecution case cannot be doubted.
However, a related witness would
become an interested witness when
his evidence is tainted with malice
and it shows that he is desirous of
implicating the accused by
fabricating and concocting evidence
but the learned counsel for the
petitioner could not show us anything

in this regard.”
21

12. The medical evidence is in line with the
ocular account. The eyewitness categorically
stated that on arrival to the spot an altercation
took place between the two and, thereafter the
accused/appellant fired at the deceased. As in
case of altercation the deceased and the
appellant were facing each other, so the seat
of injury on the chest of the deceased is a
circumstance, which confirms the eyewitness
account. Not only the medical evidence but the
statements of the witnesses are in line and this
harmony between the witnesses and the
medical evidence, has strengthened the
prosecution case beyond imagination.

13. The motive was stated to be the strained
relationship between the parties and the cause
of annoyance was the sitting of Mst.Sumbal in
the house of the deceased. The record tells
that Mst.Sumbal was married to the brother of
the appellant and her husband was stationed
abroad, so Mst.Sumbal developed some
differences with her in-laws, and as such she
came to the house of the deceased and was
living there. It was brought on record that the

appellant was interested in taking her back to
22

his house, but she was not willing and even on
the day of incident the appellant had come
with the same intention. We learnt that after
the incident, Mst.Sumbal left the house of the
deceased and is still residing in the house of
her husband, so this court is confident in
holding that the prosecution succeeded in
establishing the motive. Even otherwise,
absence or weakness of motive would hardly
be a ground for acquittal of the accused, rather
the same, in appropriate cases, can be
pressed into service for determining, as to
what sentence should be awarded.

14. Another circumstance which goes against
the appellant is, his long abscondance to
which he failed to explain, as admittedly, the
incident occurred way back in the year 2009
and he was arrested in the year 2019 after
almost 10 years of the occurrence. Once the
prosecution succeeds in bringing forward
reliable evidence, then abscondance can be
taken a_ circumstance in favour of the
prosecution and to the disfavor of the accused

and the present case is no exception.
23

15. The crucial issue before this court for
determination is, that what should be the
appropriate sentence? True that in case of
“Qatl-i-Amd”, the normal penalty is death, but
equally true that the same sentence should not
be awarded mechanically, instead the reasons
must be given, and once it was found that the
murder was cold blooded, then the normal
penalty of death is the only reward, but for the
same there must be reasons. In the present
case, it was the appellant who arrived to the
spot, and according to the eyewitness
altercation took place between the two, and
the appellant fired at the deceased. As the
eyewitness failed to explain as to what words
were exchanged between the two and that
what agitated the mind of the appellant, to
such an extent, that he fired at the deceased,
so in such eventuality this court is not reluctant
in holding that the prosecution failed to explain
the real circumstances which prompted the
appellant to kill. The single injury on the body
of the deceased is another circumstance,
which must be taken into consideration. As an

atmosphere of uncertainty prevailed over the
24

causes, which led to the death of the
deceased, the unclear atmosphere in case is
the determining factor to determine the
sentence to be awarded. To our
understanding, the learned trial court went in
haste on this particular aspect of the case, and
the awarded sentence is more than the
required, which calls for interference. The
instant criminal appeal is partially allowed, and
instead the appellant is convicted and
sentenced under section 302 (b) PPC to life
imprisonment, whereas _ the remaining
sentences are left intact.

16. As the appeal is partially allowed, so the
connected Murder Reference is answered in

negative.
