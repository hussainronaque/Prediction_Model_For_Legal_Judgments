3. After usual investigation challan was submitted against
the appellant before the Court. The learned trial court after
observing all the pre-trial codal formalities, charge sheeted the

4. The prosecution, in order to prove its case, produced as
many as eight witnesses during the trial.

Mst. Sahiba Bibi (PW.1) was complainant of the case.
She corroborated the prosecution story as mentioned in the
FIR. Shah Din Alvi (P.W.2) deposed that on 06.07.2011, at
about 02.00, he heard noise and was attracted to the place of
occurrence. Some people were also present there and saw the
decoits while running towards the fields. He inquired from the
people who told that unknown persons committed dacoity and
the appellant also committed rape upon Sahiba Bibi. The
complainant told that decoits also looted Rs.2,500/-. Arshad
Ali (P.W.3) corroborated the statement of P.W.2. Safdar

corroborated the story of the FIR. Abdul Hameed ASI (P.W.7)
investigated the case and prepared challan against the

Sahiba Bibi but her attendance could not be procured,
therefore, Doctor Muhammad Younas Rana examined as

secondary evidence as he recognized her handwriting. He
described that she conducted medical examination of Mst.
Sahiba Bibi on 09.09.2011 at 11.15 a.m. and found following
injuries:-

“Vulva vagina was healthy, hymen old torn and healed
margins admits two fingers easily. Uterus and cervix
were normal. Six vaginal swabs were taken, three
were sent to chemical examiner and three for DNA.”
Criminal Appeal No.333-J-2014 3

5. Learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor gave up
Doctor Saghir Ahmad Ch. and Zahid Ali Constable PWs as
being unnecessary.

6. Statement of the appellant under Section 342 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, was recorded. He refuted
the allegations levelled against him and professed his
innocence. Responding to question No.7 “Why this case
against you and why PWs deposed against you?, appellant

replied as under:

“It is a false case which was lodged
against me on the asking of Ashraf
Thaikedar with whom I had exchanged
hot words. The victim, Sahiba Bibi, has
illicit relations with Ashraf Thaikadar
and on his instigation, the complainant
got lodged this false case against me. All
the PWs have deposed falsely against me
on the asking of Ashraf Thaikidar. They
are inter se related with each other.”

7. The appellant neither appeared as his own witness on
oath as provided under Section 340(2) of The Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898 in disproof of the allegations levelled against
him nor produced any evidence in defence.

8. The learned trial Court vide its judgment dated
31.05.2014, held the appellant guilty, convicted and
sentenced him as mentioned and detailed above.

9. Learned counsel for the appellant, inter-alia, contends
that the prosecution miserably failed to prove its case against
the appellant; that no independent witness is cited by the
prosecution; that the ocular account is full of contradictions
and discrepancies; that the medical evidence lends no
support to the prosecution story; that the case of prosecution
is improbable and does not fit in the probabilities; that the
benefit of doubt is the vested right of the accused and not to
be extended by way of concession but grace as of right,
thus, the appellant is entitled to acquittal.

10. Learned Deputy Prosecutor General opposed this appeal
with vehemence and submitted that there was no reason for

the prosecution witnesses for his false implication; that the
Criminal Appeal No.333-J-2014 4

eye witnesses have rendered straightforward account of the
occurrence; that the contradictions do creep up after the
passage of time and discrepancies hinted at by the learned
counsel for the appellant were not fatal for the prosecution.
Concluding the arguments, learned District Public Prosecutor
submitted that the prosecution has proved its case beyond
reasonable shadow of doubt and prayed for the dismissal of
appeal

11. Heard. Available record perused.

12. The occurrence in this case had taken place on
06/7.9.2011 at 8:00 p.m under the ‘Sheesham’ tree in the
area of Chak No.27/KB Arif Wala, Pakpattan. The victim
appeared as PW.1 and stated that two persons came to their
house. They were armed with pistols. The co-accused of the
appellant, namely, Shahid confined the sister/father of the
victim in the room and that then the appellant brought the
victim to a nearby field at a distance of about four kanals
from her house. It was month of September but the
prosecution was uncertain if the day of occurrence was 6‘ or
7h of September as midnight does not begin at 8:00 p.m. The
conduct of the victim appears to be unnatural. She neither
raised any hue and cry nor attempted to resist the appellant
in any manner while she was being taken/brought to a
nearby field. She claimed to have been raped upon by the
appellant against her will but neither she produced her torn
clothes during the investigation nor any mark of violence was
seen/observed by the medical officer at the time of her
medical examination, conducted after three days of the
occurrence. The victim claimed that bulb was on at the time of
occurrence but no such bulb is shown in, at or around the
‘Sheesham’ tree, whereas, Shabbir Hussain (PW.6) claimed
otherwise. He responded to a question that no bulb was on at
the time of occurrence, thus, question of witnessing the
occurrence either by the father of the victim or any other seems to

be improbable, in particular, when no such light find mentioned
Criminal Appeal No.333-J-2014 5

in the site plan prepared by the Investigating Officer. It is also
in the evidence that co-accused of the appellant introduced
himself as Shahid, tied the hands of the sister and father of
the victim and then confined them in the room near tube well
but the said sister was not examined either during the
investigation or at trial, thus, the best evidence was withheld
by the prosecution and necessary inference may be raised in
view of the Article 129(g) of Qanun-i-Shahadat that had she
been produced at trial, she would not have supported the
prosecution version.
13. The prosecution has not explained as to why the victim
was medically examined after three days. As mentioned
above, her last worn clothes were not produced before the
medical officer or secured during the investigation. The victim
was medically examined by Dr. Humera Huma WMO and her
medico legal report was proved through secondary evidence.
The medico legal report Exh.PC suggested that the vaginal
swabs were dispatched to the chemical examiner and the
opinion of the medical officer was subject to the result of the
said swabs but neither the report of the chemical examiner
was available on record nor taken during the investigation
and for that reason, the final opinion of the medical officer
was also not available on the record.
14. At this juncture, it may be mentioned that the appellant
was medically examined by Dr. Sagir Ahmed Ch regarding
his potency. A novel procedure has been adopted by the
learned trial Court by recording a statement of the accused
without oath to the following effect:

“Iam potent”

The statement of the appellant was recorded on
07.9.2013 but this fact also find no mention in the interim
order of the said date.

The above statement of the accused cannot be equated
with a statement which is recorded under section 342, Cr.P.C.

or 340(2), Cr.P.C. As the statement of the accused under
Criminal Appeal No.333-J-2014 6

section 342, Cr.P.C. is recorded in question and answer form
and a certificate is to be furnished by the learned trial Court
at the foot of the statement in terms of section 364 Cr.P.C,
whereas, the statement under section 340(2), Cr.P.C. is
always on oath and the accused can be cross-examined by
the other side. There is no cavil with the proposition that the
statement of the accused can be recorded under section 342,
Cr.P.C more than once in appropriate cases, if needed, but of
course, after observing formalities as prescribed by law. The
statement is also read over to the accused and then he admits
the contents of the statement and then put his thumb
impression or signed the same as token of its correctness. As
highlighted above, a procedure which is not prescribed by
law was adopted by the learned trial Court by recording
statement of the appellant referred to above and then, neither
the medical officer was summoned nor the said medico legal
report was put to the accused in his statement recorded

under section 342, Cr.P.C.

15. The superior Courts has been repeatedly impressing
upon the trial Courts that questioning of accused under
section 342, Cr.P.C. should not be treated as mere formality
as it is an important facet for criminal trial and in this case,
it has been followed only in breach. If a particular
incriminating material is not put to the accused calling upon
him either to admit or to deny or to explain the same, it can
never be used against the accused. In this case, the said legal
duty has not been properly discharged by the learned trial
Court. The learned trial Court has not put separate questions
in respect of this incriminating evidence, rather, no question
find mentioned in the above statement of the accused dated
07.9.2013 except his reply which is neither thumb marked
nor signed nor any certificate was recorded by the learned
trial Court under section 364 Cr.P.C.

It is settled principle of law since long that if there is

any incriminating circumstance, flowing from any
Criminal Appeal No.333-J-2014 7

event/circumstances or documentary evidence, question in
that respect has to be put to the accused seeking his
reply/ explanation in his statement under section 342, Cr.P.C.
if it is not done so then such circumstance has to be excluded
and in no case any order regarding prejudice or conviction,
can be passed against the accused persons on the basis of
such circumstance. If question of such circumstances has
been ignored by the learned trial Court then it is illegal and
amounts to an abuse of the process of the Court. In the
present case, the trial Court has committed the abuse of the
process of Court by not questioning the appellant in respect of
the incriminating circumstance i.e. medico-legal report
regarding his potency, although the document was available
on the record. It is also settled by now that when
incriminating circumstances were not put to the accused in
examination under section 342, Cr.P.C. the evidence giving
rise to the circumstance cannot be utilized by the Court.

16. The father of the victim also claimed to be the eye
witness of the occurrence. The occurrence took place at 8:00
p.m and prosecution could not prove the fact if it was 6‘ or
7h of September or if it was midnight between 6% or 7h
September. The site plan available on the record did not
reflect any outlet, window or ventilator in the room then
occupied by family of the victim and in such circumstances,
there was no possibility of witnessing the occurrence at 8:00
p.m from a distance of four kanals. The record is totally silent
regarding source of light at the place of occurrence or the room
wherein the father and sister of the victim were confined and
they claimed to have witnessed the occurrence. As the victim
claimed to have been raped upon by the appellant in an open
field but neither any family member nor any passerby or
independent person was cited by the prosecution in support of
the complainant’s version. The record further suggested that
the parties were related to each other and at some stage there

was chance of betrothal/engagement between the victim and
Criminal Appeal No.333-J-2014 8

the appellant. Allegedly, the appellant as well as his co-
accused were armed with weapon but how that weapon was
used during the commission of crime is another question
which is open to objection. No such explanation is forthcoming
on record, thus, recovery effected from the appellant lends no
corroboration to the prosecution version.

17. It may be observed that the story of the prosecution
does not fit in the probabilities. There is no cavil to the
proposition that duty of the Court is to sift chaff from the
grain. A similar question came up for consideration
before apex Court in “Muhammad Saleem V. The State”

(2010 SCMR 374) at page 377, the apex Court was

pleased to observe as under:

“oevees General rule is that statement of a witness must be
in-consonance with the probabilities fitting in the
circumstances of the case and also inspires confidence in
the mind of a reasonable and prudent mind. If these
elements are present, then the statement of a worst enemy
of the accused, can be accepted and relied upon without
corroboration but if these elements are missing then the
statement of a pious man can be rejected without second
thought. Reference is invited to Haroon alias Harooni V.
The State and another 1995 SCMR 1627. The acid test of
veracity of a witness is the inherent merit of his own
statement. It is not necessary that an impartial and
independent witness, who is neither related to the
complainant nor inimical towards the accused would stamp
his testimony necessarily to be true. The statement itself
has to be scrutinized thoroughly and it is to be seen as to
whether in the circumstances of the case the statement is
reasonable, probable or plausible and could be relied upon.
The principle, that a disinterested witness is always to be
relied upon even his statement is unreasonable, improbable
and not plausible or not fitting in the circumstances of the
case then it would lead to a very dangerous consequences.
Reference is invited to Muhammad Rafique V. State 1977
SCMR 454 and Haroon V. The State 1995 SCMR 1627”

18. It is by now settled that benefit of doubt, if found in the
prosecution’s case, the accused shall be held entitled to the
benefit, thereof. It is also settled principle of criminal
administration of justice that if there is element of doubt, as to
the guilt of accused, it must be resolved in his favour. The
golden rule of benefit is initially a rule of prudence which
cannot be ignored, while dispensing justice in accordance

with law. It is based on maxim that it is better to acquit ten
Criminal Appeal No.333-J-2014 9

guilty persons rather than to convict one innocent person. For
acquittal of accused in an offence, how-so heinous it may be,
only a single doubt in the prosecution evidence is sufficient.
Reliance in this respect can be made on “Mst. Nazia Anwar

versus The _State_and_others” (2018 SCMR 911) and the

relevant observations of their lordships appearing in page-

922 at para-12 read as under:

novos The cardinal principle in the criminal
justice system in a situation like this, is to
extend benefit of doubt to an accused to acquit
him/her of capital charge, instead of reducing
the sentence. Once doubts about the
genuineness of the story lurk into the minds of
the judges, the only permissible course is to
acquit the accused and not go for the
alternative sentence of life imprisonment. In
this regard reference may be made to the
following case laws:

“(i) Ayub Masih v. The State (PLD 2002 SC
1048)

(ii) Muhammad _ Zaman v. The State and
others

(2014 SCMR 749)

(iti) Hashim Qasim v. The State (2017

SCMR 986)

It is also well entrenched rule and
principle of law that on the basis of
probabilities, accused person may be extended
benefit of doubt acquitting him/her of a
capital charge however, such probabilities,
high howsoever could not be made basis for

conviction of an accused person and that too
on a capital charge”

In a recent case, titled Najaf Ali Shah Versus The State
(2021 SCMR 736), the apex Court observed as under:

«9, Mere heinousness of the offence if not proved
to the hilt is not a ground to avail the majesty of the
Court to do complete justice. This is an established
principle of law and equity that it is better that 100
guilty persons should let off but one innocent person
should not suffer. As the preeminent English jurist
William Blackstone wrote, “Better that then guilty
persons escape, than that one innocent suffer.”.
Benjamin Franklin, who was one of the leading figures
of early American history, went further arguing “it is
better a hundred guilty persons should escape than
one innocent person’ should’ suffer. All the
contradictions noted by the learned High Court are
sufficient to cast a shadow of doubt on _ the
prosecution’s case, which entitles the petitioner to the
right of benefit of the doubt. It is a well settled
principle of law that for the accused to be afforded
this right of the benefit of the doubt it is not necessary

Criminal Appeal No.333-J-2014 10

that_there_should_ be many circumstances creating
uncertainty and if there is only one doubt, the benefit
of the same must go to the petitioner. This Court _in
the_case of Mst. Asia Bibi v. The State (PLD 2019 SC
64) while_relying on the earlier judgments of this
Court has categorically held that “ if a_single
circumstance creates reasonable doubt in a_ prudent
mind about the apprehension of guilt of an accused,
then he/she shall be entitled to such benefit not as a
matter _of grace and _ concession, but_as__ of right.
Reference in this regard may be made to the cases of
Tariq Pervaiz_ v. The State (1998 SCMR 1345) and
Ayub Masih _v. The Stat (PLD 2002 SC 1048).” The
same view was reiterated_in Abdul Jabbar v. State
(2010 SCMR 129), when this Court observed _that_ once
a_single loophole is observed in a_ case presented by
the_ prosecution, such _in_ the _ocular_account and
medical evidence or presence of eye-witnesses being
doubtful, the benefit of such loophole/lacuna in the
prosecution’s case automatically goes in favour of an
accused.”

19. After considering the material available on record, Iam
of the view that the prosecution had failed to prove its case

beyond reasonable shadow of doubt against the appellant.

20. For the reasons mentioned above, this Criminal Appeal
No.333-J_ of 2014 is allowed. The impugned judgment dated
31.5.2014 is set aside. He be released forthwith if not

required in any other criminal case.
