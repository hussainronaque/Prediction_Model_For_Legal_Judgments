Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi, Swat at Matta, in
case F.LR No. 850 dated 21.08.2017 u/s 302 P.P.C
read with section 15 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Arms Act, 2013, registered at police station Matta,
District Swat whereby the appellant was convicted

and sentenced as under:

i) u/s 302 (b) P.P.C

Life imprisonment (rigorous) with payment
of Rs.200,000/- as compensation to legal
heirs of deceased Mst. Sheema or to further
undergo six months SI in case of non-
payment of compensation.

ii) u/s 15 A.A.

Six months R.I with fine of Rs. 10,000/-. In
case of default, the appellant/convict was
directed to undergo further 10 days S.I.

2. Complainant Qasim Jan (PW-11),
while present in the house of the Appellant/convict
situated at village Asharay made the report on
20.08.2017 at 23:55 hours to Habib-ur-Rehan ASI
(PW-4), who had attracted to the spot on receiving
the information about: the murder of deceased,
wherein he had reported that about 15 years ago his
daughter Mst. Sheema (deceased) was married to the
appellant/ convict Tandimand, who was a drugs
addict and was in habit of beating his wife. For the
said reason the complainant had kept his daughter
confined/restrained in his house several times,

however, on the request of the appellant he would

allow her to go with him. On the eventful day, on

receiving information regarding the occurrence, the

complainant came to the house of the

appellant/convict at 22:30 hours where he found his
daughter in pool of blood and a blood-stained axe
was lying near her dead body. He charged the
present appellant for committing the murder of

deceased through axe blows.

3. The above report of complainant was
recorded through Murasila (Ex.PW-4/3) which was
later translated into F.I.R (Ex.PA) on 21.08.2017 at
00:30 hours (12:30 A.M). The author of Murasila
(PW-4) prepared injury sheet (Ex.PW-4/l) and
inquest report (Ex.PW-4/2) of: the deceased and
shifted the dead body to hospital Matta for post-

mortem.

4. Muhammad Fayaz Khan Inspector
(PW-7) has conducted investigation in the case,
during the said investigation he prepared site plan
(Ex.PB), secured the blood-stained axe arid boot left
by the appellant/convict, blood from the spot and
blood stained shirt of the deceased through recovery
memos. The positive F.S.L_ report regarding the
mentioned blood-stained articles is ExPW-9/8

whereas the F.S.L report regarding the internal parts

of the deceased secured by the doctor during the

post-mortem is Ex.PW-9/9.

Py Initially, the appellant/convict remained
absconder. The process u/s 204 & 87, Cr.P.C
conducted against him proved fruitless, however, he
was later produced by elders of the locality in police
station on 24.09.2017, where he was formally
arrested in the present case. He recorded his
confessional statement before the Judicial Magistrate

on 26.09.2017 copy of which is available on record

as Ex.PW-10/1.

6. After completion of usual investigation,
challan was put in Court for trial of the appellant/
convict. Formal charge was framed against him to
which he did not plead guilty, therefore, the
prosecution produced twelve (12) witnesses in
support of its case. After examination of the
appellant/convict u/s 342, Cr.P.C, the learned trial
Court has found him guilty of the charge, hence,
awarded him the sentence detailed in the earlier part
of this judgment. Being aggrieved the appellant/
convict has preferred the instant appeal whereas the
complainant has filed the connected revision petition

for enhancement of the sentence.

Zz It is pertinent to note that this Court was
informed on 29.10.2019 regarding compromise
between the parties, therefore, the learned trial Court
was directed to confirm the factum of compromise
by recording statements of the legal heirs of the
deceased. The learned trial Court has sent its report
whereby this Court has-been apprised that parents of
the deceased, the only legal heirs survived by her,
have effected a genuine compromise with the
appellant/convict without any pressure and they
have pardoned him in the name of Almighty Allah.
Today the father of the deceased present in the court
has confirmed the factum of compromise by stating
that since the Appellant is his nephew (son of his

sister) therefore, he has pardoned him.

However, when the case came up for
hearing on 13.01.2020, it transpired from perusal of
the record that prima facie it was a case of honour
killing, therefore, this Court deemed it appropriate to
hear the case on merits and thereafter to form an
opinion regarding the compounding of the offence in

view of the legal bar contained in section 311 of the

Code.
8. Arguments heard and record of the case
was perused.

9 On merit, the close perusal of the
evidence would reveal that prosecution has
established its case against the appellant/convict. It
is the case of prosecution against him that he had
killed his wife by inflicting injuries to her through
axe blows inside his house on 20.08.2017 at 22:20
hours. The report has been promptly lodged keeping
in view the distance between police station and place
of occurrence as well as the time at which the
occurrence had taken place. The place of occurrence
is established in view of the site plan Ex.PB,
recovery of blood from Point-A adjacent to Point-1
where Mst. Sheema was found dead between the
veranda and courtyard of her house. The blood-
stained axe with which the deceased was done to
death was recovered from Point-B in the site plan.
The post-mortem report Ex.PW-1/1 fully supports
the prosecution version as mentioned in the PAR,
The report of Serologist Ex.PW-9/8 regarding the
blood-stained earth taken from the spot, blood-
stained axe and boot of the appellant as well as
blood-stained shirt of the deceased is positive with
the observations that “it was human blood and of the
same group”. The PWs have recorded iheit

straightforward, statements. _—_—- wherein no

contradictions of glaring nature could be found to

make the recoveries doubtful.

10. Although there is no eye witness of the
occurrence, however, the appellant/convict has
recorded his confessional statement before the
competent Court on 26.09.2017. This statement was
promptly recorded wherein the appellant has
narrated all the events of the occurrence in the
manner which is corroborated by the circumstantial
evidence. He has admitted that he had killed his wife
with axe blows on seeing her in a compromising
position with his friend Umar Sahib. The
confessional statement, being fully corroborated by
remaining evidence on record, can rightly be termed
as true and voluntary confession. Thus, the
prosecution has established its case against the
appellant through confidence inspiring evidence

beyond shadow of any reasonable doubt..

il. Now the moot question for
determination before this Court is the release of the
present appellant/convict on the basis of
compromise. Although the complainant has not
stated the exact motive for the murder of | the

deceased, however, the appellant/convict has

explained the mode and manner of the murder in his

12. Needless to reaffirm, that when there is
no ocular evidence available on file and the accused
has confessed his guilt then the contents of the
confession should be accepted as a whole. Thus we
have no occasion to disbelieve the motive narrated
in the confessional statement of the deceased. The
aforesaid confessional statement was reproduced in
order to form an opinion as to whether the death of

the deceased was on the pretext of honour or she

was done to death on account of grave and sudden

provocation.

13. The murder of a _ person most
particularly a female on the pretext of honour has
been termed fasad-fil-arz under 299 (ee) of the Code
and thus is not compoundable in terms of section
311 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (“Code”) read
with section 345 (7), Cr.P.C. Section 345 (7) puts an
embargo on compounding the offence of murder, if
committed on | the pretext of honour. For ready

reference the said provision is reproduced as under;

“345 (7). No offence shall be waived or .
compounded save as provided by this
section and section 311 of the Pakistan -
Penal Code 1860 (Act XLV of 1860)”.

14. The word “pretext of honour” has not been
defined in the Code, however, it would be
appropriate to refer the provisions of the Code

relevant to the term “pretext of honour”.

299 (ee), P.P.C. “fasad-fil-arz” includes the past
conduct of the offender, or whether he has any
previous conviction, or the brutal or shocking
manner in which the offence has been committed
which is outrageous to the public conscience, or if
the offender is considered a potential danger to the
community, or if the offence has been committed
in the name of the pretext of honor.

302, P.P.C (proviso). Provided that nothing in
clause (c) shall apply where the principle of fasad-

fil-arz is attracted and in such cases only clause (a)
or clause (b) shall apply.

311, P.P.C, (proviso). Provided that if the offence |
has been committed in the name or on the pretext :

of honour, the punishment shall be imprisonment
for life. -

The proviso to section 302 and the entire
section 311 were inserted in the Code through
Criminal Law (Amendment) (Offences in the Name
or on pretext of Honour) Act, 2016 (Act XIII of

2016).

14. Causing death of a person due to grave
and sudden provocation was indéed a mitigating
circumstance under the erstwhile section 300 of the
Code which was punishable u/s 304, P.P.C before
introduction of Qisas and Diyat Ordinance. Despite
the introduction of Qisas and Diyat Ordinance,

whereby the erstwhile section 300 and section 304

- of the Code was replaced with the explicit

Tafamul/PS*

provisions relating to culpable homicide amounting
to murder and the said exceptions as earlier
provided under section 300 and 304 of the Code are
not available in clear terms, however, the august
Supreme Court of Pakistan has recognized all the
exceptions mentioned under the erstwhile section
300, P.P.C as mitigating circumstances for awarding
lesser punishment under the newly enacted section

302 (c) of the Code. Reliance is placed on “Ali

Muhammad V._Ali Muhammad _and another” (PLD

1996 SC 274).

15. Now the question arises that when a
person kills his wife immediately after having found
her in compromising/unacceptable position with a
person stranger to her would fall within the mischief
of murder on the pretext of honour and thus would
not be compoundable due the restrictions as
provided under section 345 ( 7) Cr.P.C. or the said
murder would fall under the category of grave and
sudden provocation, taking the case out of the
purview of honour killing. In the case of
“Muhammad Qasim Vs. The State” reported as PLD
2018 S.C 840, the august Supreme Court has drawn
a distinction between the honor killing and death of
person as a result of grave and sudden provocation.
Relevant para of the judgment is reproduced as

under:

4. The discussion made above leads us to an
inescapable conclusion that the case in hand
was indeed a case of grave and sudden
provocation which could possibly attract the
provisions of section 302(c) P.P.C. as declared
by this Court in the case of Zahid Rehman vy.
The State (PLD 2015 SC 77). The learned
Deputy Prosecutor-General, Punjab
appearing for the State has, however, pointed
out that in terms of the first proviso to section
302(c), P.P.C. the case in hand was a case of
murders committed in the name or on the
pretext of honour and, thus, it was to be

DB: Hon'ble Mr, lustice Syed Arshod Ali

Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
(1.A No, 94M of 2019 Tondimand Vs. The Stae ond onother)
-12-

treated as a case attracting the provisions of
sections 302(a) or 302(b), P.P.C. and not those
of section 302(c), P.P.C. We have attended to .
this aspect of the matter with care and have
found that the words "in the name or on the
pretext of honour" used in the first proviso to
section 302(c), P.P.C. are not without any
significance or meaning. The said words
indicate that a murder committed "in the
name or on the pretext of honour" has to be a
calculated murder committed with
premeditation in the background of honour
whereas the words used in the context of
grave and sudden provocation in Exception 1
to the erstwhile Section 300, P.P.C. were
"deprived of the power of self-control". Such
words used in Exception I to the erstwhile
section 300, P.P.C. catercd for a situation
which was not premeditated and had
developed suddenly leading to grave
provocation depriving a person of the power
of self-control. Such different phraseology
used by the legislature in these distinct
provisions clearly indicates catering for
different situations and, therefore, the words
"in the name or on the pretext of honour"
ought not to be mixed or confused with grave
and sudden provocation leading to depriving
of the Power of self-control. This distinction
between honour and grave and sudden
provocation was clearly recognized by this
Court in the case of Muhammad Ameer v.
The State (PLD 2006 SC 283) and the same is
manifestly attracted to the facts of the present
case as well. It has already been found by us
above that the case in hind was a case of
grave and sudden provocation and honour
only provided a backdrop (to the same.

‘has awarded him lesser punishment ws 302 (c),

Topmuyess|

P.P.C thereby discarding the element of killing the
deceased on pretext of honour, and as such the
proviso to section 302 (c) was not considered as
legal contour for awarding punishment less than life
imprisonment. In the present case, the appellant has
killed his wife when he had seen her in a
compromising position with a stranger. The mode
and manner as mentioned by him in his confessional
statement does not suggest any pre-planning or
premeditation on his part before killing his wife,
therefore, his case squarely falls within the

definition of section 302 (c), P.P.C. .

14. In view of the above, we hold that the
murder of deceased by the appellant was not an
honor killing (pretext of honor) but the incident was
result of grave and sudden provocation which had
erupted at spur’ of the moment, therefore, the
prohibition contained in section 311 P.P.C read with
Section 345 (7), Cr.P.C is not attracted to the present

case.

15. Report of the learned trial Court would
reveal that the deceased was survived by her parents,
three brothers and two sisters, however, according to

Hanafi law of inheritance, in the present case only

parents of: the deceased are her legal heirs as only
they can directly inherit from the deceased at the
exclusion of brothers and sisters. In view of their
such status, only they have the right to compound the
present offence under section 345 (2), Cr.P.C. In
this regard we may refer to Illustration (g) with note
to Section 63 of D.F Mulla’s Principles of
Muhammadan Law (Pakistan Edition) as well as
Fatwa of one Mufti Muhammad Ayaz available with
the report as Ex.PD which was obtained during the
compromise proceedings. Guidance can also be

sought from the judgment of the august Supreme

Court of Pakistan in “Muhammad Yousaf Vs. The -

State and others”’ PLD 2019 Supreme Court 461
wherein it has been held that:

There is, thus, no confusion in our law that
an heir is a person who is entitled to inherit
from the deceased at the time of his death.
In view of this settled and recognized
principle when the law of the land provides
that in a case of Ta'zir an offence of qatl-i-
amd under section 302, P.P.C. may be
compounded by the "heirs of the victim"
and when ‘an heir of a victim is only a person
who inherits dircctly from the victim then
what is clearly meant by section 345(2),
Cr.P.C. is that only a person who can
directly inherit from the victim is the person
who can compound the offence of qatl-i-amd
of the victim and none else.

The report of trial Court would further
reveal that parents of the deceased have patched up
the matter through compromise deed Ex.PA in
support of which they have recorded their joint
statement whereby they have waived their right of
Qisas and Diyat against the appellant/convict. We
are satisfied from the report of the learned trial Court
that the parties have effected a genuine compromise
and parents of the deceased have pardoned the
appellant in the name of Almighty Allah without
duress or pressure.

16. For what has been discussed above, the
instant appeal is accepted on the basis of
compromise, the impugned judgment dated
26.02.2019 is set aside to the extent of conviction
and sentence of the appellant u/s 302: (b) P.P.C,
hence, he is acquitted of the charge of murder of
deceased Mst. Sheema Bibi. Conviction and
sentence of the appellant u/s 15 A.A is maintained
whereas the benefit u/s 382-B, Cr.P.C with further
directions regarding concurrent running of the
sentences have already been extended to him by trial
Court. He be released forthwith from jail if not

required in any other case. The connected Cr.R
