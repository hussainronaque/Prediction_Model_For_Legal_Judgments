Benefit of Section 382-B Cr. PC was also

extended to the appellant.

2. FIR in the case in hand was registered on
the basis of Murasila Ex PW 6/1. Complainant namely
Mst. Shanbata lodged report of the occurrence to the
local police by stating that she and Mst. Elishba
(deceased) had been present in the room of their house
on the day of occurrence. In the meanwhile, the
appellant came to the room duly armed with a pistol
and made firing at his wife as a result of which she got
injured. The occurrence was also stated to have been
witnessed by daughter-in-law of the complainant
namely Mst. Bacha Zadgai wife of Wahid Khan, who
also supported and thumb impressed report of the
complainant. The accused/appellant was accordingly
charged for commission of the offence by the
complainant. Initially, case against the accused/
appellant had been registered under section 324 PPC
but later on, the injured succumbed to injuries and
died, the section of law was therefore altered to that of

302 PPC.

articles were also obtained and placed on record as Ex
PW 11/9 and Ex PW 11/10. During investigation,
mother and brother of the deceased lady had also

leveled against her, vide the impugned judgment dated

09.01.2019.

4. We have heard arguments of learned

counsel for the parties, learned Asst:A.G appearing on

behalf of the State and perused the record.

5. Prosecution have been relying upon
statements of the two witnesses recorded during trial of
the case beside confessional statement of the appellant
and other corroboratory evidence produced during the
course of trial. On arrival of the local police at the spot,
report of the occurrence had been made by the
complainant namely Mst. Shanbata wife of Amir
Chaman, who had been grandmother of the appellant.
Same had been seconded by Mst. Bacha Zadgai who
had also been related to the appellant. Complainant
was examined during trial as PW-6 and the other PW
who had seconded her report, was examined during
trial as PW-7. The complainant while deposing in
Court as PW-6 has stated that she and her daughter-in-
law namely Mst. Bacha Zadgai (PW-7) had been
present in the room of their house on the day of
occurrence, and Mst. Elishba (deceased then alive)
entered her room. The appellant came to the room

while being duly armed with a pistol, after Zuhr prayer

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-5-

and made firing at his wife as a result of which she got
injured. She has also stated that when the police
arrived to the spot, she had not been in her senses due
to some heart disease. She further stated that the police
had got recorded her statement and that of her
daughter-in-law as well. She reaffirmed the contents of
report Ex PW 6/1 and stated that she had thumb
impressed the same. In her cross-examination, she
stated that she had four sons and four daughters and
had been living with her younger son namely Wahid.
She also stated that father of the appellant had been
living in a separate house. She denied the suggestion
that the other PW namely Mst. Bacha Zadgai had not
been having cordial relation with the inmates of the
appellant’s house. She could not recollect the time of
arrival of police but stated that as soon as she got
senses, the police recorded her statement which had
been a time between Zuhr and Asr. In rest of her cross-
examination also, she had stood firm in her stance and
the learned counsel for defence could not extract
anything from her mouth which may be found
beneficial for the case of appellant. Same was the case
with the other eye-witness namely Mst. Bacha Zadgai

(PW-7), who had also been related to the appellant.

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-6-
She is wife of Wahid Khan, who has been uncle of the

appellant. She has also given a description of the
occurrence similar to PW-6. In her cross-examination,
she has also stood firm in her stance and has never
deviated there-from. She has also fully supported case
of the prosecution and nothing beneficial to the case of
appellant could be extracted from her mouth. She has
denied the suggestion that her husband had killed the
deceased in the name of honor. She admitted it correct
that the Jirga had put in restrictions on the appellant
and her deceased wife, whereby they had been
restrained from coming to village Chakdara. She
however added that the couple had later on come to
said village and had started living there. She also stated
that the family of Mst. Elishba (deceased) had not been
happy with their settling in village Chakdara. She

further stated that they had been living there for a year.

6. These two witnesses examined as PW-6
and PW-7 had been closely related to the appellant and
had not been related to the deceased or her parents.
The occurrence has taken place inside their house.
Their presence could neither be doubted nor had it
been seriously questioned during the course of cross-

examination. When these two witnesses have deposed

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-7-

against the appellant, then no reason existed for
disbelieving their testimony. Their statements have
also been consistent with other particulars of the case
as well as the corroboratory evidence collected by the
Investigating Officer during the course’ of
investigation. No discrepancy could be found in their
statements inter-se or when put in juxtaposition to
other particulars of the case. Statement of PW-6 in her
examination-in-chief that at the time of arrival of
police, she had not been in senses, has been clarified in
her cross-examination that she has regained her senses
and thereafter lodged report of the occurrence to the
local police. These were absolutely reliable witnesses,
whose statements have been sufficient for convicting
the accused even in absence of any corroboratory
evidence. In the case of Muhammad Iqbal and
others vs. Muhammad Akram and another reported
as 1996 SCMR 908, Hon’ble Supreme Court of

Pakistan has held in this respect;

“Ocular evidence may be classified into three
categories: Firstly, wholly reliable; secondly,
wholly unreliable; and thirdly, partly reliable
and partly unreliable. In the first category,
conviction may safely be sustained on
uncorroborated testimony.”

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad

7. The appellant was grandson of the
complainant (PW-6), who had been 80 years old
woman. Existence of any malafide for false implication
of the appellant had been beyond imagination. No such
fact could be brought by the defence side in support of
existence of such a malice on part of PW-6 and PW-7.
Mere suggestion to PW-6 without any supporting
material and background of any animosity, would not
be sufficient for doubting testimony of PW-6. Both the
witnesses have been absolutely reliable and no reason

existed for discarding their testimony.

8. The appellant has also got his
confessional statement recorded on 03.08.2017. He had
been arrested on 31.07.2017 at 05:30 p.m. In his
confessional statement, he has stated that due to
quarrel between his mother and ex-wife, his mother
had left house and went to the house of his maternal
grandmother while his wife had gone to the house of
his paternal grandmother i.e. complainant in the case in
hand. He has further stated that he repeatedly requested
his ex-wife to come along with him to their own house
but she refused and therefore he fired at her and also
intended to kill himself, but a bullet got stuck in the

pistol. It is important to be noted that the pistol had

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-9.

also been recovered on pointation of the appellant vide
recovery memo Ex PW 10/3. It has been noted in such
recovery memo that a bullet had got stuck in chamber
of the pistol. The pistol had also been exhibited as Ex
P-3 in statement of PW-10. This factum is providing
sufficient corroboration to the confessional statement
of the accused, which is even otherwise found to have
been recorded voluntary besides being proved in its
contents. For proving the confessional statement,
prosecution have also examined the concerned
Magistrate as PW-12, who has deposed in respect
thereof and his testimony has also remained intact,
during the course of cross-examination, wherein
nothing could be found which could have shaken
evidentiary value of the confessional statement. In
addition to the eye-witness account, confessional
statement of the appellant may also be considered

safely.

9. The Doctor was examined as PW-9, who
has given description of the injury found on the body

of the deceased lady in the following words;

1. A firearm entry wound 1.5-2 cm x 1-2 cm
on front of right side of abdomen. 7-8 cm
from midline of abdominal wall and 2 cm
above and medial to anterior superior
iliac spine.

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-10-

2. A firearm exist wound (size 1-2 cm x 1-2 cm)
in upper outer quadrant of right buttock
near lumber region on back. 7-8 cm from
backbone (vertebral column).

In her statement as well as in her cross-
examination, the Doctor has stated that the deceased
lady Mst. Elishba had been alive, responsive, fully
conscious and well oriented, when she had initially
been brought to the Hospital. The time of arrival at the
Hospital has been shown as 03:00 p.m. on 31.07.2017.
She had also been brought to emergency ward of THQ
Hospital Chakdara by some policemen. Learned
counsel for the appellant has argued that the concerned
policemen had not taken report of Mst. Elishba
deceased, which fact indicated that she had in-fact, not
been ready for nominating the appellant i.e. her
husband for commission of the offence. The
complainant while lodging report of the occurrence to
Gul Rahman ASI at 03:30 p.m. has stated that after the
lady had received injuries, she had been taken to the
Hospital by the relatives. It has come in evidence that
relatives of the deceased had been living in another
village i.e. Sesada Chakdara. Relatives of the appellant
and complainant had however been living close to the
place of occurrence and it was quite natural that they

would have taken the deceased lady to the Hospital.

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-|1-

This fact also becomes clear from the statement of
PW-7 namely Mst. Bacha Zadgai, who has stated in
her cross-examination that she had accompanied the
lady to the Hospital at Chakdara. She has also stated
that police had already been present in the Hospital,
but she had not lodged any report to them at the
Hospital. She has further stated that after sometime,
she had come back to her house, where the police had
arrived and on their arrival, she and her mother-in-law
had got their statements recorded in respect of the
occurrence. The deceased then alive and in injured
condition, was at their disposal as she had not been
accompanied by any of her relatives like father, brother
and sister etc. In the given situation, if the police
present at the Hospital had not taken report of the lady,
it could not be presumed that she had not been
charging the appellant. Nothing has come in evidence
about the fact that the lady had ever been asked by
anyone, and this presumption of not charging the
appellant, cannot be drawn in circumstances of the
case, particularly when the appellant has been charged
by his relatives including his grandmother as well as
wife of his uncle, in whose house the occurrence had

taken place.

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad

10. The ocular evidence has otherwise been
fully in line with the medical evidence. No
contradiction could be found making the eye-witness
account doubtful. Weapon of offence i.e. pistol has
also been recovered. In support thereof, PW-10 and
PW-11 have been examined, who have also remained
consistent in their testimony. The alleged pistol along
with one empty shell and four live cartridges of same
bore had also been sent to the Forensic Science
Laboratory for the purpose of chemical analysis,
wherefrom matching report Ex PW 11/10 had been

received and placed on record of the case.

1. Prosecution have successfully proved case
against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.
Conviction of the appellant recorded by the learned
trial Court vide the impugned judgment has fully been
justified in circumstances of the case and appeal to the
extent of conviction of the appellant did not carry any

substance.

12. The sentence of death awarded to the
appellant however requires a_ reconsideration.
Appellant has committed the offence in a state of mind
where his emotions overpowered him all of a sudden

and he made firing at the deceased lady. It is apparent

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-13-

from the confessional statement of the appellant that he
first requested and insisted that the lady should
accompany him to his house. This is believable for the
reason that the couple had entered into a love marriage
about two years before the occurrence, which fact is
evident from the statements of PW-1 and PW-2, sisters
of the deceased. His emotional state of mind is also
depicted from the fact that he even intended to kill
himself but was prevented by the stucking bullet in
chamber of the pistol, as per contents of the
confessional statement, which we have accepted as true
and voluntary. There had not been any premeditation
in committing murder nor had there been any motive
and the contributing factor of quarrel between mother
and wife of the appellant had happened all of a sudden
and the refusal of the deceased to accompany the
appellant, had put the appellant (who had been a boy of
26 years of age and had just read to the level of 5"
class), in such an emotional state of mind in which he
had committed the unfortunate incident, not only
killing the deceased but also devastating his own life.
In such circumstances, we do not find imprisonment of

death penalty by the learned trial Court as justified and

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-14-

therefore order its reduction to the penalty of life

imprisonment.

13. On allowing of the instant appeal
partially, sentence of the appellant is ordered to be
converted into life imprisonment, which shall run
concurrently with the sentence separately awarded to
the appellant in connected case registered vide FIR
No. 550 dated 02.08.2017 under section 15-AA at
Police Station Chakdara District Dir Lower.
The appellant shall also have benefit of section 382-B
Cr. PC. Murder Reference No. 01-M of 2019 sent by

learned trial Court is accordingly answered in negative.

14. These are reasons for our short order of

even date, which reads as;

“For reasons to be recorded later, this appeal
is partially allowed, the impugned judgment
dated 09.01.2019 of the Court of learned
Additional Sessions Judge, Dir Lower at
Chakdara rendered in case FIR No. 544
dated 31.07.2017 registered under section
302/109 PPC at Police Station Chakdara
District Dir Lower, is modified by converting
the sentence of death awarded to the
appellant/convict namely Muhammad Uzair
son of Khaista Rahman under section 302 (b)
PPC to life imprisonment along with benefit
of section 382-B Cr. PC. Rest of the sentence
in respect of amount of compensation
awarded by learned trial Court shall remain
intact. The modified sentence of life
imprisonment in the case in hand _ shall
however run concurrently with sentence
in the connected case registered vide FIR

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-15-

No. 550 dated 02.08.2017 under section
15-AA at Police Station Chakdara District
Dir Lower, a conviction in which case was
upheld vide separate judgment of even date
in Criminal Appeal No. 23-M of 2019.
Murder Reference No. 1-M of 2019 is
answered in negative.”
