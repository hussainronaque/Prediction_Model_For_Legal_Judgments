MANZOOR AHMAD MALIK, J. Cri, P. No. 114 of 2013:

also directed to pay compensation of Rs.400,000/- to the legal heirs of
deceased in terms of Section 544-A, Code of Criminal Procedure, in default
whereof to undergo S.I. for six months. For his conviction under Section
324 PPC, the petitioner was sentenced to two years R.I., with a direction to

sentences of imprisonment were ordered to run concurrently and benefit of

Aggrieved of his conviction~and ‘sentence, the petitioner filed a criminal
appeal before the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar, which was dismissed
through the impugned judgment. Hence, the instant criminal petition for
) leave to appeal.
2. Prosecution case against the petitioner as divulged from the
contents of FIR, registered on the statement of complainant Muhammad
Deen, is that on the fateful day and time, the petitioner alongwith his co-
accused Sardar Ali, Asim Ali and Ameen (since absconding) made firing at
the complainant side, as a result whereof Shahid succumbed to the injuries
at the spot, whereas Mehar Deen was injured, who later on died in the
hospital.
3. We have heard learned counsel for the convict-petitioner,
learned counsel for the son of deceased Mehar Din (petitioner in connected
petition) and learned Additional Advocate General, KPK at length and have
perused the available record with their assistance.
4. It has been observed by us that the occurrence in this case, as
per prosecution, had taken place on 28.12.2009 at 5.05 p.m. and the matter
was reported to police within thirty minutes of the occurrence, as a result
whereof formal FIR was registered at 05.35 p.m. The promptitude in
reporting the matter to police rules out possibility of deliberation and
consultation.
5. Learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently contended that
in this case the prosecution only produced complainant Muhammad Din
(PW1), whereas PW Asif, who has been cited as a witness in the FIR, was
given up by the prosecution and adverse inference can easily be drawn

under the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 that said eyewitness was not

ready to support the case ofthe prosecution. In this respect, it has been
observed by us that in criminal cases it is the quality of evidence and not

the quantity which is relevant. A scrutiny of statement of complainant

Muhammad Din (PW1) recorded before the trial Court reveals that he

remained consistent on all the material aspects of the case and his testimony
inspires confidence. So far as non-production of PW Asif is concerned, the
complainant Muhammad Din (PW1) in his court statement has explained
that another eyewitness Irfan Ullah was done to death by the petitioner side
during trial and in this respect a case was separately registered. In these
circumstances, it was but natural for PW Asif not to appear during trial.
Even otherwise, complainant Muhammad Din (PW1) who is father of
deceased Shahid and brother of deceased Mehar Din is not expected to
substitute petitioner for real culprits. The medical evidence adduced by Dr.
Zia ur Rehman (PW10) who conducted medical examination of Mehar Din
(deceased) in injured condition, Dr. Naveed Alam (PW9) who conducted
autopsy on the dead body of deceased Mehar Din and Dr. Iftikhar Ahmad
(PW8) who conducted autopsy on the dead body of Shahid Khan
(deceased) supports the case of prosecution against the petitioner as the
doctors observed firearm injuries on the person of both deceased. In these
circumstances, we have no manner of doubt in our mind that prosecution
has successfully proved its case against the petitioner beyond reasonable
doubt. So far as contention of learned counsel for the petitioner that
positive report of FSL qua empties secured from the spot and weapon
recovered ‘from the petitioner is of no avail to the prosecution because

petitioner has since been acquitted from the case registered against him

under the Arms Act (in a separate trial), is concerned, it has been observed

by us that even if the positive-report of FSL is excluded from consideration,
the prosecution has brought home the guilt of petitioner through confidence

inspiring direct evidence in the shape of testimony of complainant

" Muhammad Din (PW1) having full support from the medical evidence.

Though for a number of reasons/mitigating circumstances, the learned
courts below have not awarded sentence of death to the petitioner but on
our own independent estimation, it has been observed by us that the
prosecution has set out a specific motive in the FIR inasmuch as the
occurrence had taken place in the aftermath of a property dispute but the
prosecution during trial has not produced any independent witness to prove
the same and it is only the word of the complainant Muhammad Din. In
these circumstances, we are of the view that prosecution has not been able
to prove the motive set out by it and the premium of such non-proof must
go to the petitioner. Therefore, the petitioner has rightly been sentenced to
imprisonment for life on two counts, which sentence, in the circumstances
of the case, meets the ends of justice.

6. For the foregoing, the instant criminal petition having no

merit is dismissed and leave to appeal is refused.

Cri. Petition No. 113-P of 2015

7. Through the instant petition, the petitioner who is son of
deceased Mehar Din, seeks enhancement of sentence of respondent No.1.
The petition is barred by time. The grounds mentioned in the application
for condonation of delay are not acknowledged in law. As already
discussed in Para 5 above, the sentence of imprisonment for life on two

counts awarded to respondent No.1 by learned courts below is sufficient in

“4the circumstances of the case. No interference in the impugned judgment is

Consequently, Cri. Petition No. 113-P of 2015 is dismissed for being barred

by time as well as on merits.
