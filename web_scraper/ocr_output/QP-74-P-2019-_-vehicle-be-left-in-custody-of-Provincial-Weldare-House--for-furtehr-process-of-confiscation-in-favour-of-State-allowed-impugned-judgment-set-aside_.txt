JUDGMENT

Date of hearing 20.08.2020

Petitioner (s) by: | Syed Hamad Ali Shah, Advocate
Respondent (s) by: Mr. Ijaz Muhammad, Advocate
State (s) by: Mr. Rab Nawaz Khan, Addl: AG

IKRAMULLAH KHAN, J-. Through the

instant quashment petition, filed under
section 561-A Cr.PC_ petitioners have
challenged the impugned judgment dated
18.09.2019, rendered by learned Sessions
Judge, Nowshera, whereby the learned Judge
has handed over the vehicle bearing
registration No.LEC-102 on interim custody

to the respondent/claimant owner.

2. In essence, a motor vehicle bearing

Registration No.LEC-102, had seized by
squad of Intelligence Bureau of Excise
Taxation & Narcotics Control Department,
KP, Peshawar (Petitioners) on the basis of
suspicion, of having bogus Registration
documents and tamper chassis. The motor
vehicle concerned was inspected and
examined through Forensic Science
Laboratory for the purpose to determine any
tampering within the chassis of the vehicle,
which was found to be tampered. The
Registration documents after verification
from the concerned Registration Authority,
Lahore, were also declared to be bogus. That
the respondent namely Tajdar Khan,
claiming to be owner and lost possessor,
applied thereto the learned Court of
Sessions, for interim custody of the motor
vehicle concerned, by filing an application
under section 516-A Cr.PC, which was
allowed through the impugned judgment,
hence the instant petition, filed by the

petitioners with the following relief:

“It is, therefore, most humbly
prayed that in view of aforesaid
facts the impugned order may
kindly be quashed/set aside and
the vehicle in question may be
left in the custody of Provincial
Ware House, for the further
process of confiscation in favour
of State under the relevant law."

3. Learned counsel for petitioners
contended that the impugned judgment is
against law; that the learned Court has no
jurisdiction to exercise any power to make
direction, in view of Section 516-A Cr.PC for
giving interim custody of the motor vehicle
concerned, as the same was not case
property described thereunder Section 516-
A Cr.PC; that under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
(Road Checking, Seizure and Disposal of
Motor Vehicles), Rules, 2015, a definite
hierarchy is provided, for disposal of
vehicles, seized under the Rules, 2015 and
no criminal case has been registered by the
petitioners against the respondent,
therefore, the learned Court of Sessions has
got no jurisdiction to release the vehicle

under consideration on bail/interim custody.

4. On the other hand, learned counsel

for respondent argued that the vehicle under
consideration is case property of case FIR
No.44, which had released by competent
Court of law on bail/interim custody; that on
one hand, the petitioners could not seize the
vehicle under consideration under the Motor
Vehicle Rules, 2015, while on other hand, no
criminal proceedings under different head of
law, could be initiated against the motor
vehicle under consideration, therefore, the
impugned judgment is based on proper
appreciation of law on the subject, and is
just and fair, could not be set aside by this
Court, in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction

saved thereunder Section 561-A Cr.PC.

5. | have heard learned counsel for the
parties, and also learned Additional
Advocate General on behalf of the State in
light of facts on record and law on the

subject.

6. In order to resolve the legal
proposition, agitated during course of
argument by learned counsel for the parties,

it would be expedient to give reference to
relevant provisions of law, under which
petitioners could seize and confiscate motor
vehicles and power/jurisdiction of Courts, in
matter of releasing/handing over of motor
vehicles, involved in any criminal case, seized
by law enforcing agencies under provisions

of respective law on the subject.

7. The Government of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, in exercise of its legal rights,
conferred upon her, under section 43, 23 and
25(4) of the Provincial Motor Vehicles
Ordinance, 1965, has made the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa (Road Checking, Seizure and

In term of Sub-section 3 of Rule 9 ibid while

10. The above mentioned Rules
provide a concise and complete procedure,
thereafter seizure of a vehicle under these
rules, and before confiscation of the same,
which are still holding the field and, is
prevailing law on the subject, while on other
hand, the provisions contained in Section
516-A Cr.PC, empower a criminal Court to
make order for disposal of properly pending
trial in certain cases which reads as:

“Sec. 516-A. Order for Custody
and disposal of Property Pending
trial in certain cases.- When any
property regarding which any
offence appears to have been
committed, or which appears to
have been used for the commission
of any offence, is produced before
any Criminal Court during any
inquiry or trial, the Court may make
such order as it thinks fit for the
proper custody of such property
pending the conclusion of the
inquiry or trial, and, if the property
is subject to speedy or natural
decay, may, after recording such
evidence as it thinks necessary,
10

order it to be sold or otherwise
disposed of.

Provided that, if the property
consists of explosive substances, the
Court shall not order it to be sold or
handed over to any person other
than a Government Department or
office dealing with, or to an
authorized dealer in, such
substances.

Provided further that if the property
is a dangerous drug, intoxicant,
intoxicating liquor or any other
narcotic substance seized or taken
into custody under the Dangerous
Drugs Act, 1930 (Il of 1930), the
Customs Act, 1969 (IV of 1969), the
Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd)
Order, 1979 (P.O. 4 of 1979), or any
other law for the time being in
force, the Court may, either on an
application or of its own motion
and under its supervision and
control obtain and prepare such
number of samples of the property
as it may deem fit for safe custody
and production before it or any
other Court and cause destruction
of the remaining portion of the
property under a certificate issued
by it in that behalf:

Provided also that such samples
shall be deemed to be whole of the
property in an inquiry or proceeding
in relation to such offence before
any authority or Court.”

11. As clear from the available record
that the petitioners had taken into custody
and had seized the motor vehicle under
consideration, on the basis of having not
only forged registration number, but also
tampered chassis frame, under Motor

Vehicles Rules, 2015, and no any criminal
11

case had registered by the petitioners
against the respondents, and no any criminal
inquiry is under process or any trial is
pending before any criminal Court, while the
vehicle in question is neither a case property
nor used in commission of an offence, so in
such circumstances, the provisions of Section
516-A Cr.PC is not at all attracted and
applied thereto the seizure of the motor
vehicle in question and, the learned Court of
Sessions had got no jurisdiction in order to
pass any judgment to hand over custody of

the vehicle in question to the respondent.

12. In so far as, the contention of
learned counsel for respondent is concerned,
that the motor vehicle under consideration is
case property of case FIR No. 44 registered
against accused namely Tajdar Khan could
be considered by the officers, designated
under the Rules, 2015 for the purpose.
However, the record reveals that the vehicle
which had given on_ superdari/interim

custody to respondent had bearing Chassis
12

No. Z RE.1414508599 and Registration No.
LEC-12-102, but in case in hand, the vehicle
so seized by petitioners although display
registration No.LEC-12-102 but the
document/registration was found and
declared to be bogus , while the chassis
number is wielded. It could not be presumed
that the vehicle so seized under
consideration is the one, which is also case

property of case FIR No. 44.

13. All these disputed and _ factual
controversy, be dealt with by the Competent
Authority, designated as such under the
Motor Vehicles Rules, 2015 and, the
petitioners, if so advised may take recourse

to the concerned Authorities.

14. For the reasons mentioned
hereinabove, this petition is allowed and
accepted, consequently the impugned
judgment dated 18.09.2019 is set aside. The
motor vehicle, if already handed over to
respondent, shall be re-taken into custody

by the petitioners, and shall initiate process
13

under the Rules, 2015, if not already
commenced and, the petitioners or any
other claimant/owner may be _ afforded
Opportunity to prove its legal ownership
(if any) and the matter be decided in

accordance with law.
