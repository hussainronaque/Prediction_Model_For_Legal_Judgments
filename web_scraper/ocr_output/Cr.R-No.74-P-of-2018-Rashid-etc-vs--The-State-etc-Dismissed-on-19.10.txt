Wis

QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- Rashid and two

other petitioners are accused in the case
lodged under Sections 302/324/34 PPC vide
FIR No.372 dated 26.07.2015 on the report of
complainant/respondent No.1, Ali Zaman.
Through the instant criminal revision petition
under Section 439 Cr.P.C, they assailed order
of the learned trial Court/ASJ-Il, Mardan,
dated 24.05.2018, whereby the learned trial
Court discarded statement of the
complainant/respondent No.1; which,

according to the petitioners, was recorded in
the Court as PW.6 in the presence of counsel
for complainant and _ learned Public
Prosecutor. They prayed for making statement
of the complainant recorded as PW.6 as part
of record of the case.

2. Arguments of learned counsel for the
parties heard; and record perused.

3. It is an admitted fact, not even denied
by the petitioners, rather admitted by them
even in the instant revision petition, that the
so-called statement of the complainant was
not recorded by the learned trial Court/ASJ-Il,
Mardan, as the learned ASJ was not present
in the Court at that time and had rushed to the
casualty of DHQ Hospital, Mardan, in a
precarious condition, his BP ranging in
200/140. Therefore, the statement recorded in
the absence of the learned presiding officer of
the trial Court, even in the presence of
counsel for the complainant and Public
Prosecutor, would not be worth consideration
under the law. The defence, by no stretch of

imagination, can shift the burden of risk it took
by opening its cross examination to the
opposite side in the absence of learned
Presiding Officer of the trial Court. The plea of
the defence for making statement of the
complainant so recorded as part of the
record is not only unprecedented, but finds no
support from any legal provision or precedent
of the Courts. As such, the learned trial
Court/ASJ-Il, Mardan, was perfectly justified in
declining request of the petitioners/accused to
make statement of the complainant, recorded
in the absence of the learned Presiding
Officer, as part of the record.

4. Consequently, the order dated
24.05.2018 of the learned trial Court is not
open to exception, hence maintained; and the
revision petition against the impugned order is
dismissed for being without substance and
merit.

Announced.
19.10.2018.
