WAQAR_ AHMAD SETH, CJ.- Petitioner, Mian
Muhammad Tariq Shah son of Muhammad Zahir Shah, seeks
his post arrest bail in case FIR No. 502 dated 04.02.2018
under Section 489-F PPC registered at Police Station
University Town, Peshawar. He has been refused bail by the
learned lower courts; hence, the instant petition for the same
purpose.

2. _ As per contents of F.LR., the complainant has
sold out plot situated at Phandu Bala to the petitioner, who
issued cheque No. 0270746 amounting to Rs. 25,998,500/-
Bank Alfalah Islamic Jamrud Road Azam Town, Peshawar to
the complainant, which on presentation, was dishonoured

because of insufficient amount.

i 3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. Perusal of the record would reveal that
complainant was the owner of 86 marlas landed property
situated at Phandu Bala, Phandu Road, Peshawar in respect of
which he executed an agreement for its sale with the
petitioner. Amount of Rs. 64,240,000/- was fixed as sale
consideration, out of which, Rs. 48,00,000/- was paid by the
petitioner to the complainant as earnest money and remaining
amount was to be paid in different installments. In order to
discharge liability of repayment, petitioner has issued cheque
amounting to Rs. 5,200,000/- to the complainant but due to
non-availability of amount, the same was dishonoured and FIR
No. 1795 dated 01.12.2017 was registered against the
petitioner in Police Station Faqir Abad, Peshawar.
Compromise was effected between the parties and petitioner
was released on bail, however, in consequence of compromise,
the petitioner issued another cheque amounting to Rs.
58240000/- to the complainant, which on presentation to the
bank was dishonoured and in this respect, FIR No. 137 dated
08.02.2018 was registered against the petitioner in Police

Bb Station Chamkani, Peshawar. Again compromise was effected
-3-
between the parties and petitioner was released on bail but
despite the fact, the petitioner has again issued cheque No.
0270746 dated 04.07.2018 amounting to Rs. 25,998,500/- to
the complainant, which on presentation to the bank was
dishonoured due to insufficient amount and the instant F.LR.
has been registered against him.

5. It may be advantageous to mention here that for
to constitute an offence under Section 489-F PPC, the
following ingredients have to be there.

i, Cheque issued with dishonest intention;

ii. Towards repayment of a loan or
fulfillment of an obligation; and

iii. The cheque is  dishonoured on
presentation.

6. In the present case, the cheque for a huge amount
was issued by the petitioner for fulfillment of obligation in
terms of agreement dated 26.03.2018, placed on file, with the
knowledge that sufficient amount is not available in his
account to honour the cheque and thus there was prima facie
the element of dishonesty on the part of petitioner and that the
cheque was dishonoured at the bank’s counter is now part of

Vi the record of the case. Thus, on all fours, the provisions of
-4-

Section 489-F PPC are squarely attracted in the present case.
Moreover, the complainant cannot be bound down to seek his
remedy by approaching the civil court through a recovery suit
when there is no legal embargo on him not to press into
service the penal provisions against the delinquent through the
registration of an FIR.

7. The mere fact that the offence for which the
petitioner is charged does not hit the prohibitory clause of
section 497 Cr.P.C. cannot per se make him entitled to the
concession of bail. Grant of bail in such like cases is not a rule
of universal application as each case merits decisions on the
basis of its own facts and circumstances. Reliance, in this
respect, may advantageously be placed on the cases of
Muhammad Siddique vs. Imtiaz Begum and two others (2002
SCMR 442) and Shameel Ahmad vs. The State_ (2009 SCMR
174).

8. It may not be out of place to mention here that the
issuance of cheques which are in turn dishonoured has taken
our society by storm so much so that such instrument is looked

y upon by the beneficiary with a degree of doubt and skepticism
-5-

till it is honoured by the concerned bank. Such practice has
also eroded the mutual trust of the general public and there are
instances when people shy away from accepting cheques even
from trustworthy persons. Moreover, no one is supposed to
commit the financial murder of another member of the society.
Even otherwise, it is settled that for deciding the bail
application, the court has to observe the tentative assessment
and deeper appreciation of evidence is not required and it will
not be fair to go into discussion about the merits of the case at
this juncture. In this respect, reliance is placed on the cases of
Saleh Muhammad vs. The State (PLD 1986 SC 211) and The
State vs. The Zubair_and four others (PLD 1986 SC 163).
Thus, taking a tentative assessment of the available record, the
petitioner being prima facie connected with the commission of
offence coupled with the fact that he has also issued another
cheque amounting to Rs. 52,00,000/- to the complainant and
FIR No. 1795 dated 18.12.2017 under Section 489-F PPC
Police Station Faqir Abad, Peshawar was also lodged

B disentitled him to the concession of bail.
-6-
9. Resultantly, the bail petition being without any
substance is hereby dismissed.

Announced.
