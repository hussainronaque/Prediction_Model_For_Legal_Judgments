JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.-

Petitioner (1) Riaz Ullah (2) Aman and
(3) Muhammad Omar, seeks bail in case FIR
No.39 dated 24.04.2015, registered under
sections  170/171/419/411 PPC, S.5
Explosive Substances Act, S.7 Anti
Terrorism Act and S.15 Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013, at Police
Station CTD, Peshawar.

2. Arguments heard and record perused.

3. It appears from record that petitioners

alongwith co-accused have been arrested red

handed by Haroon Jadoon SHO alongwith

other police officials, near Professors

Coloney Jumma Khan Khawar Pukhta Pull,

wearing official uniform of “Khasadar” in a

motorcar having fake number plate, from

which heavy arms and ammunitions as well

as explosive have been recovered. Recovery

of huge quantity of arms and ammunitions as

well as explosive substance from direct

possession of the petitioner in a motorcar

having fake registration number as well as

their wearing official uniform of “Kassadar”,

are sufficient material which indicates

towards their intention of terrorism. The

offence is heinous and against the entire

society. Our country, particularly, the

Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has

already suffered a lot because of terrorism,

therefore, offenders of such like offences

deserve no leniency.

4. Resultantly, this petition stands

dismissed.
