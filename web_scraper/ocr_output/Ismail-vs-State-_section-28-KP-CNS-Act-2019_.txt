ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- Petitioner Ismail son of
Muhammad Khitab, seeks post arrest bail in case FIR
No.483 dated 03.05.2020, registered under section 9 (d)
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic Substances Act,
2019 (to be referred hereinafter as the Act of 2019) and
section 14 Foreigners Act, at Police Station Agha Mir Jani
Shah, Peshawar.

2. According to First Information Report (FIR), on
receipt of spy information regarding presence of the
petitioner in possession of narcotics on a thoroughfare
leading to Dir Colony, on 03.05.2020 Syed Sajid Ali Shah
ASI along with other police officials, reached the spot and

in the midnight at 00.05 hours, apprehended the petitioner
along with plastic bag, containing 15 sachets of heroin,
total weighing 75 grams and an amount of Rs.1800/- in
cash, being the alleged sale proceed of narcotics.
Allegedly, on the pointation of the petitioner, the ASI also
recovered 06 packets heroin from ceiling of his baithak,
each weighing 1000 grams. He separated 05 grams from
each packet and one gram from 75 grams as samples for
chemical analysis by the FSL, hence, this case.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record perused.

4. Main thrust of the arguments of learned counsel
for the petitioner was that the alleged search, seizure and
arrest of the petitioner without warrant, has been made by
an ASI, whereas, according to section 28 of the Act of
2019, search, seizure and arrest without warrant can only
be made by an “Authorized Officer” and under section
2(e) (ii) of the Act of 2019, “Authorized Officer” means a
Police Officer/official not below the rank of Sub-Inspector
duly authorized by the Regional Police Officer, therefore,
the entire proceedings are nullity in the eye of law and the
petitioner is entitled to be released on bail on this score
alone. In support of his arguments, he placed reliance on
the judgment of Division Bench of this Court dated
27.12.2019, rendered in WP No.6372-P/2019 followed by

Judgments dated 27.03.2020, 30.03.2020 and 20.04.2020,
passed by single Bench in Cr.Misc.BAs Nos.341-P, 580-P
and 468-P of 2020.

5. I have gone through the judgments (supra)
wherein, in the former cases, inter alia, the concession of
bail has been granted to the accused on the ground of
proceedings, not initiated by the “Authorized Officer”,
whereas, in the the latter case, the accused has been granted
bail on the sole ground of non-compliance of the
provisions of section 28 of the Act of 2019, without
touching merits of the case. With utmost respect, I differ
with the view taken in the judgments (supra) for the
following reasons:

6. The Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997
(Act XXV of 1997) (to be referred hereinafter as the Act
of 1997), was enacted and promulgated in the year 1997,
and made applicable throughout the Pakistan. The
Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the year 2019,
enacted and promulgated the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control
of Narcotics Substances Act 2019 (Act No.XXXI of 2019),
vide notification dated 4" September, 2019, extendable to
the whole of the Province of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and
under section 59 thereof, the Act of 1997 was repealed but
only to the extent of cultivation, possession, selling,
purchasing, delivery and transportation etc within the

Province to the extent of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. For the
sake of convenience and ready reference section 59 of the
Act of 2019, is reproduced below:-

“59. Repeal and Savings:- (1) The Control of
Narcotics Substances Act, 1997 (Act No.XXV of
1997), to the extent of cultivation, possession,
selling, purchasing delivery and transportation etc
within the Province, to the extent of the Khyber

Pakhtunkhwa is hereby repealed.”

7. The thread bare reading of section 59 of the Act of
2019 depicts that though the Act of 1997 has been repealed
but only to the extent of cultivation, possession, selling,
purchasing, delivery and transportation etc, within the
province of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, however, it does not
speaks specifically about repealing of rest of the provisions
of the Act of 1997.

8. Perusal of both the enactments would reveal that
section 21 of the Act of 1997, is analogous to a great extent
with section 28 of the Act of 2019, as both speak about the
power of entry, search, seizure and arrest of accused
without warrant. For the sake of convenience and ready
reference, section 21 of the Act of 1997 is reproduced

below:-

21. Power of entry, search, seizure and arrest

without warrant. — (1) Where an officer, not below

the rank of Sub-Inspector of Police or equivalent
authorized in this behalf by the Federal

Government or the Provincial Government, who
from his personal knowledge or from information
given to him by any person is of opinion that any

narcotic drug, psychotropic substance or controlled
substance in respect of which an offence punishable
under this Act has been committed is kept or
concealed in any building, place, premises or
conveyance, and a warrant for arrest or search cannot
be obtained against such, person without affording
him an opportunity for the concealment of evidence
or facility for his escape; such officer may:-

(a) enter into any such building, place, premises or
conveyance;

(_b) break open any door and remove any other.
obstacle to such entry in case of resistance;

(c) seize such narcotic drugs, psychotropic
substances and controlled substances and other
materials used in the manufacture thereof and any
other article which he has reason to believe to be
liable to confiscation-n under this Act and any
document or other article which he has reason to
believe may furnish evidence of the commission of
an offence punishable under this Act; and

d) detain, search and, if he thinks proper, arrest any
person whom he has reason to believe to have
committed an offence punishable. under this Act.

(2) Before or immediately after taking any action
under sub-section (1), the officer referred to in that
sub-section shall record the grounds and basis of his
information and proposed action and forthwith send
a copy thereof*, to his immediate superior officer.

(Bold and underline supplied emphasis).

I deem it appropriate to reproduce section 28 of the
Act of 2019, for facility reference and comparison with
section 21 of the Act of 1997, which read as under:-

28. Power of entry, search, seizure and arrest
without warrant.---(1) Where an authorized
officer, who from his personal knowledge or from
information given to him by any person, is of the
opinion that any narcotic substance is kept or
concealed in any building, place, premises, dwelling

house or conveyance and warrant for the search or
arrest cannot be obtained from the Special Court
against such person without affording him an
opportunity for the concealment of evidence or
facility for his escape, such officer may-

(a) enter into any such building, place, premises,
dwelling house subject to the proviso of sub-section
(1) of Section 27 of this Act;

(b) break open any door and remove any other
obstacle to such entry in case of resistance;

(c) seize such narcotic substances, methamphetamine
and other materials used in the manufacturing
thereof and any other article or documents which he
has reason to believe to be liable for confiscation or
may furnish evidence of the 4 commission of an
offence punishable under this Act; and

(d) search and, if he thinks proper, arrest any person
whom he has reason to believe to have committed an
offence punishable under this Act.

(2) Before or immediately after taking any action
under sub-section (1), the authorized officer,
mentioned in sub-section (1), shall record the
grounds and basis of his information and take
immediate necessary action and forthwith send a
copy of the same to the Director or as the case may

be to the Regional Police Officer”.
The word “Authorized Officer” has been defined
under section 2(e) of the Act of 2019, which means:-

(i) An Officer of the Directorate General, not
below the rank of Sub-Inspector, authorized
by the Director; or

(ii) A Police Officer/official not below the rank
of Sub-Inspector, authorized by the
Regional Police Officer.

9. Section 21 of the Act of 1997 (almost ditto copy of
section 28 of the Act of 2019), has remained the point of

discussion before the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in
different cases. Useful reference can be made to case titled,

“Muhammad Younas and others vs Mst. Perveen alias

Mano and others” (2007 SCMR 393), wherein the august

Supreme Court was pleased to hold that arrest of accused
in possession of narcotics by a Police Officer below the
rank of Sub-Inspector would not vitiate the prosecution
case, rather the competent Court would proceed to
determine the guilt or innocence of the accused on the basis
of evidence, irrespective of the manner in which he is
brought before the court. The relevant portion of the
judgment (supra) is reproduced below:-

“The other argument of the learned counsel for the
respondent No.1 as to the violation of the provision of

section 21 and 22 of the Act needs to be dealt with.

Ordinarily, only an officer of the rank of Sub-
Inspector or equivalent or above may exercise the
powers of arrest and seizure of narcotics. But this
is not an absolute rule. There may be cases of
extreme urgency requiring prompt action, where
an_accused_is caught with narcotics in his
possession by a Police Officer of a lower rank. Can
it_be said that such Police Officer should just let
him go with the narcotics? The answer would
certainly be in the emphatic “No”. The guilt or

innocence of an accused does not depend on the
question of competence or otherwise of a Police
Officer to investigate the offence. A trial of an
accused is not vitiated mere on the ground that the
case has been investigated by an officer who is not
authorized to do so unless a contrary intention
appears from the language of a statute. The competent
Court would proceed to determine the guilt or
innocence of an accused on the basis of the evidence

produced before it irrespective of the manner in
which he is brought before it. A somewhat similar
view was taken in the cases of “Mr. Abdul Latif Vs
GM Paracha and others” (1981 SCMR 1101), “State
through Advocate General Sindh Vs Bashir and
others” (PLD 1997 SC 408), “The Crown vs Mehar
Ali” (PLD 1956 FC 106), “ M.S.K Ibrat Vs the
Commander in chief, Royal Pakistan Navy and
others” (PLD 1956 SC 264), “Ahmad Khan Vs Rasul
Shah and others” (PLD 1975 SC 66 at page 81, 88and
151-152), “Muhammad and others Vs the State”
(1984 SCMR 954) and “the State vs Sohail Ahmed
and 04 others” (PLD 1990 FSC 29). We may however
observe that in a proper case, a Police Officer, if
guilty of deliberate usurpation of power and violation
of a statute may render himself liable to disciplinary
or penal action or both in accordance with law. The
purpose of enacting protective provisions of sections
21 and 22 of the Act seems to be that normally the
cases of narcotics being of serious nature should be
handled by more responsible Police Officer.
(emphasis supplied).
In case titled, “The State vs Abdali Shah”, (2009 SCMR

291), it has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court that:-

“

Even the provisions of sections 20 to 22 of CNSA
being directory, non-compliance thereof would not
be a ground for holding the trial/conviction bad in
the eyes of law. On this ground the conviction of

the appellant cannot be set aside. Reference in this
behalf can be made to the case of Fida Jan v the State

2001 SCMR 36; State through AG Sindh v Hemjoo
2003 SCMR 881, Karl Johan Joseph v the State PLD
2004 SC 394 and Muhammad Younas v Mst. Perveen
alias Mano and others 2007 SCMR 393, wherein it is
observed that where provisions of CNSA are
directory in nature, non-compliance of the same is not

fatal”. (emphasis supplied).
Similarly, while dilating upon the provision of section 21

of the Act of 1997, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case

titled, “The State Vs Abdali Shah” (2009 SCMR 291),
made the following observations:-

“It would be seen that a huge quantity of 52 Kgs of
chars was allegedly recovered from the Taxi beside
which the respondent was standing while closing its
dickey. It is not possible that the police would foist
such a huge quantity of charas upon him, It appears
that the learned High Court has relied heavily
upon the technical aspect of the seizure and arrest
which in our opinion are misconceived as in the
fist_place_no raid was carried out by the police
personnel but the respondent apprehended during
normal patrol duty. As such the provisions of
section 21 are not applicable. Even otherwise, it
cannot be expected that upon apprehension of the
accused the police party would go in search of the
officer who is entitled to arrest the accused being
an ASI. At the most, this was an irregularity which
was curable under section 537 Cr.P.C. as held by

this Court in case of Muhammad Hanif (supra).
(emphasis supplied).

10. In light of the law laid down by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in the judgments (supra), I feel no
hesitation to hold that mere non-compliance of the
provisions of section 28 of the Act of 2019 (para materia
to section 21 of the Act of 1997), would not vitiate the
proceedings, and such non-compliance cannot be made
a_sole_ground for release of the accused on bail,
particularly, in cases of extreme urgency requiring prompt

action.
10

11. In the case in hand, the occurrence has taken place
at 00.05 hours i.e. mid night. There was no time for the
complainant ASI to comply with the provisions of section
28 of the Act of 2019. The petitioner has been arrested red
handed and huge quantity of narcotics has been shown
recovered from his possession and on his pointation.
Statement of witnesses to the recovery proceedings
recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C., who on the face of
record has no ill will or enmity with the petitioner, support
the version of the Seizing Officer. On tentative assessment
of the material on record, petitioner is prima facie
connected with the commission of offence which is not
only against the State but also against the society at large,
hence, he is not entitled to the concession of bail.

Resultantly, this petition stands dismissed.

12. Before parting with the order, it is necessary to
mention here that controversy with regard to power of
entry, search, seizure and arrest without warrant, by an
officer below the rank of Sub-Inspector has already been
resolved by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the
judgments (supra). Probably the cases (supra) had not been
brought into the notice of Hon’ble Benches of this Court
while deciding cases relied upon by learned counsel for the
petitioner, mentioned in Paragraph No.4 of this judgment.

In such a situation, it has been remained the practice to
11

refer the case to Hon’ble the Chief Justice of this Court for
constitution of a Larger Bench, but keeping in view the
mandatory provisions of Article 189 of the Constitution of
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, which says that any
decision of the Supreme Court shall, to the extent that it
decides question of law or is based upon or enunciates a
principle of law, be binding on all other Courts in Pakistan,
I feel no need to sent the case to Hon’ble the Chief Justice
for constitution of the larger Bench, because even if the
larger Bench is constituted, the law already laid down by
the Hon’ble Supreme Court, shall prevail.

13. The Additional Registrar (Judicial) of this
Court shall send copy of this judgment to the worthy
Sessions Judges of the entire Districts, who shall
further circulate the same among the Courts dealing
with the cases of narcotics.
