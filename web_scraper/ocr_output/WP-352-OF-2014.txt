JUDGMENT SHEET

WP. No.352-A/2014.
Date of hearing 18.02.2020.

Petitioner/s (Pehlwan Shah &others) by
Mr.Hamid Faraz Abbasi, Advocate.

Respondent/s (Liaqat Shah & Anwar
Shah) by Mr. Muhammad Shafique Awan,
Advocate and Raja Muhammad Zubair,
AAG for respondent No. 4.

AHMAD _ ALI, J. Through this petitioner
under Article 199 of the Constitution of
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the
petitioners Pehlwan Shah and two others
have made the following prayer:-

On acceptance of instant writ
petition, the FIR No. 363
dated: 06.05.2014 may
graciously be quashed and any
other relief in the
circumstances of the case,
which this Hon’ble Court
deems fit and proper, may also
be granted.

2. Brief but relevant facts leading to filing

of instant writ petition are that respondents

No.1 and 2 filed a complainant under section
506/406/427/430/43 1/432/34 PPC before
respondent No. 3/Judicial Magistrate-II,
Havelian, Abbottabad against the present
petitioners on 06.05.2014. The learned
Judicial Magistrate after receiving the
complaint on the very first date passed an
order, which is impugned herein through this
writ petition.

3. Learned counsel for petitioner mainly
relied upon the arguments that learned
Judicial Magistrate without
adverting/considering towards the mandatory
provisions of law, in a cursory and slipshod
manner passed the impugned order, which is
not his domain but only vested with learned
Justice of Peace under section 22-A Cr. P.C.

4, Before going deep into the discussion,
it is necessary to reproduce the impugned
order, which is as under:-

Private complaint submitted. It be
registered. Complainant Liaqat shah
and Anwaar Shah through learned
Tariq Khan  Jadoon, Advocate
submitted this private complaint
against respondents under sections
506/ 406/ 427/ 430/ 43 1/ 432/ 34 PPC.
The contents of the complaint clearly

refer that the cognizable offences are
made out. Therefore, the petitioner
should contact the concerned police
station for registration of the FIR. The
police should register the case and
investigate the matter. There is
nothing to proceed privately in this
complaint. The petitioner should
contact the concerned PS if advised.
With these observations this complaint
is dismissed.

5. It is true that the learned Judicial
Magistrate may proceed with the complainant
filed before him in accordance with law and
rules applicable but in no way he can perform
functions which he is not empowered under
the law as in the instant case, the record
reveals that upon filing of complainant against
petitioners under sections 506/ 406/ 427/ 430/
431/ 432/ 34 PPC, the learned Judicial
Magistrate on the very first instance held that
“The contents of the complaint clearly refer
that the cognizable offences are made out. He
in the same order also held that “Zhe police

should register the case _and investigate the

matter, therefore, in consequence of the said

order, the local police got registered the case
FIR 363 dated:06.05.2014 under sections 506/

406/ 427/ 430/ 431/ 432/ 34 PPC.
6. The legislature has empowered Ex-
Officio Justice of Peace under section 22-A
[6] (i) Cr. P. C and not to Judicial Magistrate
to pass an order for registration of FIR, which
happened in the present case. Section 22-A
Cr.P.C is reproduced herein below for ready
reference:-

22-A. Powers of Justice of the Peace.
(1) A Justice of the Peace for any
local area shall, for the purpose of
making an arrest, have within such
area all the powers of a Police
Officer referred to in section 54 and
an officer in-charge of a_police-
station referred to in section 55.

(2) A Justice of the Peace making
an arrest in exercise of any powers
under subsection (1) shall, forthwith,
take or cause to be taken the person
arrested before the officer in-charge
of the nearest police-station and
furnish such officer with a report as
to the circumstances of the arrest
and such officer shall thereupon re-
arrest the person.

(3) A Justice of the Peace for any
local area shall have powers, within
such area, to call upon any member
of the police force on duty to aid
him:

(a) in taking or preventing the
escape of any person who has
participated in the commission of
any cognizable offence or against
whom a reasonable complaint has
been made or credible information
has been received or a reasonable
suspicion exists of his having so
participated; and

(b) in the prevention of crime in
general and, in particular, in the
prevention of a breach of the peace
or a disturbance of the public
tranquility.
(4) | Where a member of the police
force on duty has been called upon to
render aid under subsection (3), such
call shall be deemed to have been
made by a competent authority.

(5) A Justice of the Peace for any
local area may, in accordance with
such rules as may be made by the
Provincial Government:

(a) issue a certificate as to the
identity of any person residing within
such area, or

(b) verify any document brought
before him by any such person, or

(c) attest any such document
required by or under any law for the
time being in force to be attested by a
Magistrate,

and until the contrary is proved, any
certificate so issued shall be
presumed to be correct and any
document so verified shall be deemed
to be duly verified, and any
document so attested shall be
deemed to have been as fully attested
as if he had been a Magistrate.

1[(6) An ex-officio justice of the

peace may issue appropriate

directions to the police authorities
concerned on a complaint regarding-

(i) non-registration of a criminal
case;

(ii) transfer of investigation from
one police officer to another;
and

(iii) neglect, failure or excess
committed by a __ police
authority in relation to its
functions and duties.]

7. So, in addition to the remedy of
filing a direct complaint under S.200, Cr.
P. C before Magistrate, the provision of
S.22-A Cr. P. C. has been added to the
Statute Book whereby — Sessions
Judges/ Additional Sessions Judges by

virtue of their office being justice of
peace, can exercise all powers of a police
under S.54, Cr. P. C. This section clearly
explains that Ex-officio justice of peace
had been fully empowered to issue any
direction to police authorities, whenever
any complaint about their neglect, failure
or excess committed in relation to its
functions including non-registration of
case in cognizable offences, and the
police is duty bound to register a case.
Reliance is placed on case titled: Malik
Muhammad Sadiq versus Station House
officer & others reported in 2013 P Cr. L
J 1177 wherein it is held:-

J. Law casts holy duty upon
the learned Justice of Peace for
examining the petition and other
material available on record for
determining if any cognizable
offence is made out therefrom or
not. In this connection, learned
Justice of Peace is bound by law to
take into consideration contents of
petition filed under section 22-A
and 22-B, Cr.P.C. as well as to
examine the complainant/petitioner
if needed. He may seek a report
from the SHO of Police Station
concerned in the matter. No doubt
spirit of promulgating provisions of
section 154, Cr.P.C. is that report
should not be entered/registered
afier holding preliminary enquiry
but this provision of law has grossly
been misused by first informants,
who just to satisfy their ego or to
take revenge from its opponent, lay
false information. Even such first
information is also provided in
cases involving civil disputes like
one relating to execution of an
agreement to sell and business
transaction etc., as such in order to
sift the chaff from grain, it has
become imperative for Court to
have a report from Police Station.
Further in appropriate cases, the
person against whom a direction for
registration of case is sought, may
also be summoned in the Court for
showing cause as to why direction
for registration of case should not
be issued against him. The calling
of aggrieved person is based on
analogy that SHO before submitting
report to Court, summons both
parties and after hearing them
dispatches same to Court with his
own finding thus if that report of
SHO, is considered, in which both
parties have already been heard
then there is no harm in calling that
party in the Court for arriving at
Just conclusion. This would help in
curbing multiplicity of litigation and
work load could be managed
besides saving precious public time.
This practice if adopted would
advance the principle of natural
Justice i.e. audi alteram partem.

8. So, in view of the above, it has been
crystal clear that Judicial Magistrate was not
empowered under the law to issue directions
to the police regarding registration of case,
which powers are only vested with the learned
Ex-Office Justice of Peace under section 22-A
Cr. P.C, so, without discussing the merits of
the complaint and leaving aside the question
that whether the offences allegedly committed
are cognizable or nor, we reached at the
conclusion that the act of the learned Judicial
Magistrate issuing directions to the police
regarding registration of case is beyond his
jurisdiction, so the whole proceedings upon

which the superstructure was build ie
~

registration of case are not sustainable. Hence,
the instant writ petition is allowed and as a
result thereof, the impugned order of learned
Judicial Magistrate dated: 06.05.2014 is set-
aside and resultantly, the FIR No. 363 dated:
06.05.2014 is quashed.

Announced,
18.02.2020.

JUDGE

Hon'ble Justice Shakeel Ahmad and Justice Ahmad Ali.
