rer)
SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- Appellant, Irfan Ullah, was
tried by the learned Sessions Judge, Bannu for the offences
under sections 302/353 PPC read with 15-AA, in case FIR
No.11 dated 21.08.2018 registered with Police Station CTD,
Bannu and vide judgment dated 30.07.2021, the appellant was
convicted under section 302(a) PPC and sentenced him to death
as Qisas alongwith payment of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five
Lacs) as compensation under section 544-A Cr.P.C to the legal
heirs of deceased or in default thereof, to undergo six months
S.I. The appellant was also convicted under section 15-AA and
sentenced for 01 year S.I with fine of Rs.10,000/- or in default
thereof, to suffer 01 month S.I. The sentences were ordered to
run concurrently and benefit under section 382-B Cr.P.C was

also extended to the appellant.
2. Through the instant appeal, the appellant has questioned
the legality of the impugned judgment and the awarded
sentence, whereas, the learned trial Court has sent the connected
Murder Reference No.02-B/2021 under section 374 Cr.P.C for
confirmation of the death sentence or otherwise, while
respondent has preferred Criminal Revision Petition No.34-
B/2021 for enhancement of the compensation amount. Since all
these matters have arisen out of same judgment, therefore, we
intend to decide the same through this single judgment.

3. Succinetly, facts of the present case are that on
21.08.2018 at 14:45 hours, complainant Khalid Khan LHC /
DFC No.1554, aged about 33 / 34 years, in injured condition, at
the Emergency Ward of Civil Hospital, Bannu lodged a report to
the effect that he is posted as DFC at PS Basia Khel. On the day
of occurrence, he was present in the area while discharging his
duties, when accused Irfan Ullah, appellant herein, called him to
meet him for some information, so he, on his motorcycle, came
to his village Kachkot Asad Khan, where he found accused
armed with pistol, who, on seeing him, started firing at him with
the intention to commit his qatl-e-amd, resultantly, he got
injured and fell on the ground, while accused decamped from the
spot after the commission of offence. The complainant was
shifted to Civil Hospital, Bannu by the people of the locality. No

enmity was disclosed. Hence, the FIR.
4. After completion of investigation and arrest of the
accused / appellant, prosecution submitted complete challan,
where at the commencement of trial, the prosecution produced
and examined as many as 12 witnesses. On close of prosecution
evidence, statement of appellant / accused was recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he professed innocence and false
implication, however, neither he opted to be examined on oath
as provided under section 340(2) Cr.P.C, nor wished to produce
defence evidence. After hearing arguments, the learned trial
Court vide the impugned judgment dated 30.07.2021, convicted
and sentenced the accused / appellant Irfan Ullah as mentioned
above. Feeling aggrieved the appellant approached this court
through the instant criminal appeal, whereas the learned trial
Judge requested this Court through the connected Murder
reference for confirmation or otherwise of the awarded sentence.
5. The learned counsel for the parties along with learned
Asstt: A.G representing the State were heard at length and with
their valuable assistance, the record was gone through.

6. In the unfortunate incident the complainant after receiving
firearm injuries was shifted to the hospital, where he reported
the matter to one Zahir Shah Khan ASI, who after drafting the
murasila, prepared his injury sheet and the injured was referred
to the doctor for his medical examination. The investigating

officer after receiving copy of the FIR, visited the spot and on
his personal observation, prepared the site plan. During spot
inspection, the investigating officer collected two empties of .30
bore from the place of the accused and blood stained earth from
the place of the deceased. Initially, the matter was investigated
through a joint investigation team duly constituted under section
19(1) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. It is pertinent to mention
that at the time of report, a mobile phone was handed over by
the deceased then injured, which was taken into possession and
thereafter, the deceased then injured was referred to the doctor
for his medical examination. The injured was examined and his
medico legal certificate was prepared. The unfortunate injured
could not survive and succumbed to the injuries on 24.08.2018,
on his death the section of law was altered from section 324 PPC
to 302 PPC. The accused was arrested on 26.08.2018 and at the
time of his arrest, a mobile phone alongwith a .30 bore pistol
were recovered from his personal possession. The investigating
officer after collecting the mobile phones both, from the
deceased and the convict appellant, applied for the call data
record, which was collected, the same transpires that both the
deceased and the convict / appellant were in active
communication with each other on the day of incident and even,
a little before the incident. During investigation, section 7 of the
Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 was deleted and as such, the matter

was remitted to the Court having jurisdiction in the matter. The
convict / appellant faced trial and on conclusion of the trial, the
learned trial Court was pleased to convict the appellant vide the
impugned judgment.

7. The learned trial Court assessed the evidence thoroughly
and after application of its judicial mind to the collected
material and recorded statements, convicted the appellant as
stated above. The impugned judgment was read with the help of
learned counsel for the parties, which tells that the matter was
dealt with thoroughly and that the learned trial judge fully
appreciated the material aspects of the case. As the appellant has
questioned his conviction before this Court through the instant
criminal appeal, so this Court feels it essential to reassess and re-
appreciate the already assessed and appreciated evidence. True
that in the incident, a police official lost his life and it was he
who reported the matter while injured, but equally true that the
accused deserves to be treated in accordance with law and has
the right to fair trial. Yes, the deceased met a tragic death, but
we will not allow the gravity of the matter to govern us, by
doing so, we will lose the confidence of all involved, and there
is every likelihood of miscarriage of justice. We are to tread
with care to discover the involvement of the appellant in the
death of the deceased. The sole determining factor in the instant
case is the declaration of a dying man with no eye witness

account and as such, we are burdened with additional care, so to

rescue the innocent and punish the guilty. True that dying
declaration has received several interpretations regarding its
evidentiary value, but we cannot ignore the judicial consensus in
holding it a weak kind of evidence, it has never been thrown
away, rather emphasis is provided for its corroboration from
independent sources. History tells that once sanctity was
attached to the declaration made by a dying person, but with
passage of time, this approach went through a drastic change
with the drastic change in moral values and behavior of the
society. The consensus once built up was revisited and the
courts of law were burdened with the additional liability of the
due diligence and extra care, while convicting the accused. In
the recent past, keeping before the moral degeneration of
society, the sole declaration of a dying man was hardly
considered a ground to convict unless corroborated. In this
particular case, we are to see the worth of the report made by the
complainant then injured. This is for us to examine that the
prosecution followed the law on the subject and the guidelines
provided. As we have no other eye witness who saw the tragedy
and the complainant did not face the taxing cross examination,
so we are bound to scan through the record before we conclude.
We accept that the claim of prosecution is based on
circumstantial evidence and we are firm in our belief that in

cases, which hinge on circumstantial evidence, heavy duty is

cost upon the prosecution to build up an unbroken and well
connected chain, with the collected evidence, where its one end
touches the neck of the accused charged and the other the body
of the deceased. Prudence accepts no missing link and in case of
a missing link, the prosecution would be the worst sufferer and
the accused a beneficiary. To proceed with the matter in hand,
we are eager to know that what evidence is collected, apart from
the report made. This is for us to assess the collected evidence,
to gauge its worth and competence, more particularly its
inherent worth that could lend support to the statement of a
dying person.

8. The moot questions which this Court is to determine are;
as to whether the deceased then injured was capable to talk; and
as to whether the matter was promptly reported, that too, by the
deceased then injured; and as to whether the statement of the
doctor inspires confidence regarding the alertness and
consciousness of the deceased then injured; and as to whether
the Call Data Record collected by the investigating officer
connects the appellant with the death of the deceased; and as to
whether the deceased and the appellant went on talking through
their respective mobile phones with each other a little before the
incident and as to whether it was the appellant who killed the

deceased.

9. As the entire case of the prosecution revolves around the
dying declaration of the deceased then injured, so we deem it
essential to determine its evidentiary value. This court is to see
as to whether the deceased then injured was shifted to the
hospital soon after the incident and as to whether he was
examined by the doctor, the moment he was brought before. In
order to ascertain this particular aspect of the case, the
statements of two witnesses i.e. the doctor who examined the
deceased in injured condition and the scribe who reported the
matter are of much importance. The doctor was examined as
PW-04 who stated that on the day of incident, he was present in
the hospital when the deceased was brought by the people of
locality in injured condition. After receiving the injured, he
started his medical examination and prepared his medico legal
certificate; that while providing treatment to the injured, in the
meanwhile, the local police attracted to the hospital who started
drafting the murasila and prepared the injury sheet. The scribe
was examined as PW-11, who stated that when he reached to the
hospital, the injured was under treatment of the doctor and by
the same time, he reported the matter which was taken in the
shape of murasila and his injury sheet was prepared; that after
preparation of the injury sheet, the deceased was referred to the
doctor for further treatment. It is pertinent to mention that the

matter was reported to the local police at 15:30 hours and it was

agitated by the learned counsel for the appellant that when the
report was made after the medical examination then an inference
could be drawn that the matter was investigated and later on,
after consultation and deliberation, the appellant was charged for
the death of the deceased. We are not persuaded with what the
learned counsel for the appellant submitted, as both the
witnesses i.e. the doctor and the scribe categorically admitted
that at the same time, the treatment of the injured was in
progress and the police official was busy in drafting the
murasila. We are conscious of the fact that the scribe when
appeared before the trial Court, during his cross-examination,
stated that after drafting the murasila and preparation of the
injury sheet, the injured was referred to the doctor for his
medical examination, but the same alone is not sufficient to
discard the report of the deceased then injured, as the injured
had no mala fide to falsely implicate the appellant for the
injuries caused to him. True that the scribe has shown an
abnormal alertness and wanted to toe the lines, as in criminal
cases, first the report is made, then the injury sheet is prepared
and thereafter, the injured is referred to the doctor for his
examination, but this explanation of the scribe can only and only
be considered a procedural lapse, which cannot overweigh the
confidence inspiring report of the complainant. Both the

witnesses walked with bonafide, had they any mala fide then

-10-

they would have told the story in the manner that would suit the
prosecution. The prime question for us to determine is; as to
whether at the time of making the report, the deceased was
capable to talk; and as to whether a certificate was obtained from
the concerned doctor regarding his alertness and orientation and
as to whether the seat of injuries on person of the complainant
was so severe to confirm that at the time of his examination, he
was not in senses. In order to appreciate this particular aspect of
the case, we deem it essential to go through the statements of the
doctor i.e. the doctor who examined the injured when he was
brought to the hospital and the doctor who conducted the
autopsy on the dead body of the deceased. The doctor, who
provided first aid to the injured at the time of his arrival to the
hospital, confirmed that while examining the injured he was
capable to talk and the same has been mentioned in the medico
legal certificate. The doctor was asked as to whether any
certificate was provided by him to the local police and as to
whether any request was made by the local police in that respect,
the doctor replied in affirmative and stated that a written request
was made which was duly endorsed by him. He further stated
that it was he who opined to the local police regarding the
orientation and capability of the deceased then injured, to talk.
The doctor who conducted autopsy on the dead body of the

deceased was examined as PW-02 who stated that it was he who

-ll-

conducted postmortem of the dead body of the deceased and that
he found two firearm injuries on his abdomen. He further stated
that at the time of postmortem examination, he observed that the
major organs, inside the body, were injured. An attempt was
made to extract from the mouth of this witness that due to
excessive bleeding, the deceased then injured was not in a
position to report the matter, but this witness did not reply to
appease the appetite of the learned counsel representing the
complainant. There is no denial to the fact that the deceased
received firearm injuries on the vital parts of his body and that
the major organs of his body were injured, but we cannot ignore
that the deceased then injured survived for three long days and
thereafter breathed his last in the Khyber Teaching Hospital,
Peshawar. The attending circumstances of the present case leave
no ambiguity in mind that the complainant was in senses and
was fully oriented in time and space. The certificate asked by the
police and report tendered by the doctor leaves no ambiguity
that the deceased was capable to talk. When this Court reaches
to a conclusion that it was the complainant who reported the
matter then in that eventuality, this Court is under the obligation
to search for independent corroboration, as the sole statement of
the complainant is not sufficient for convicting the appellant.
We feel it essential to scan through the record once again in

order to find out as to whether the collected evidence supports

-12-

the stance of the complainant and as to whether the prosecution
succeeded in creating a chain. Whether the dying declaration
alone can form the basis for conviction or not has been

questioned by the apex Court in its reported judgment

“Farmanullah Vs Qadeem Khan and another” (2001 SCMR
1474), wherein it is held that:

“It has to be remembered that the
Legislature has advisedly, as a matter
of sheer necessity, incorporated in
section 32 an exception to the general
rule that hearsay is no evidence. In the
very nature of things the sanctity of
oath and the test of cross-examination
are not available to ascertain the
veracity of a dying statement, but the
nature of the statement itself and the
circumstances under which it is made
make probable the truth of the
statement and thus, take the place of
oath and cross-examination. On first
principles, the sanctity attached to
such statements by the statute should
be respected unless there are clear
circumstances brought out in the
evidence to show that a dying
declaration is not reliable for any
reason.”

10. Initially, for investigation of the case, a joint investigation
team was constituted under section 19(1) of the Anti-Terrorism

Act, 1997. The matter was investigated from different angles
-13-

and the investigating officer made efforts to collect independent
evidence in support of his case. The record tells that the
investigating officer took into possession a mobile phone from
the deceased at the time of his examination by the doctor, and
from the appellant soon after his arrest. It is pertinent to mention
that the respective cell numbers of the deceased and accused
were thoroughly investigated and in that respect, the Call Data
Record was collected. The Call Data Record which comprises of
several sheets, was duly exhibited and we, with the help of
learned counsel for the parties, went through the same. It is
interesting to note that on the day of incident, there was an
active communication between the deceased and appellant, more
particularly, a little earlier to the time of occurrence. We noted
that on the day of incident, the deceased received a call from the
cell number shown in possession of the appellant when he was
present at Bus stand in Bannu City. It is pertinent to mention
that soon thereafter, a second call was received by the deceased
when he was proceeding towards the village of the appellant,
whereas we found that the last call was received by the deceased
when he had already reached near the village of the appellant.
This was questioned time & again by the learned counsel for the
appellant that the prosecution could not succeed in linking the
appellant with the collected cell number and that even the

prosecution failed to bring on record the ownership of the cell

-14-

number in possession of the deceased. We understand the
anxiety of the learned counsel representing the appellant, on this
particular aspect of the case, and it was his anxiety which forced
us to revisit the collected material and recorded statements. True
that the respective cellular companies were not visited by the
investigating officer, and equally true that the forms, initially
filled by the deceased and appellant for acquiring their
respective cell numbers, have not been taken into possession, but
the record tells that the investigating officer did visit the
franchise wherefrom both, the deceased and the appellant
purchased the SIMs in their possession and to substantiate its
claim the prosecution collected the relevant documents. It is
pertinent to mention that on the day of incident, the deceased
while leaving the police station recorded his departure in Daily
Diary No.12 of the even date, where he expressed his onward
engagement in the area and the said document was never
questioned and which lends support to the prosecution story.

11. The prosecution took the pain to produce and examine all
the relevant witnesses, including the marginal witness in whose
presence, the spot was inspected, the empties were recovered
and blood was collected. One of the marginal witness who
accompanied the Investigating Officer was examined during
trial, who was questioned time and again regarding his departure

with the Investigating Officer, the time spent on the spot and the

-15-

completion of spot proceedings, but nothing detrimental could
be extracted from the mouth of this witness to favour the
appellant. This witness remained consistent throughout and his
consistency further added to the credibility of the investigation
conducted. There is no denial to the fact that the accused was
arrested on 26.08.2018 and from his personal possession, a .30
bore pistol was recovered and section 15 AA was inserted in the
FIR. It was on pointation of the appellant that addition in the site
plan was made, where the accused / appellant pointed out the
place wherefrom he fired at the deceased. It was vehemently
argued that the appellant was charged on the basis of mala fide
and that he had no hand in the affair, but the record tells that the
appellant was actively involved in the business of narcotic and
in that respect several FIRs were registered against him in the
concemed police station. The investigating officer collected the
details of all the cases, where the appellant was charged and a
list was produced before the Court which was duly exhibited.
We went through the collected FIRs and found that in all the
cases registered against the appellant, the appellant was
convicted. The defence took the plea that no major punishment
was awarded to the appellant in the referred cases and the
quantum of awarded sentence does not hold him responsible for
the death of the deceased, as the prosecution is to prove its own

case on the strength of the collected evidence. We are not

-16-

impressed with the submissions made at the bar, as this is not
the quantum of sentence, rather the involvement of the appellant
in the like activities which confirms the stance of the
complainant that the appellant was nourishing a grudge against
the deceased, the reasons disclosed by the deceased for his
injuries, while reporting the matter, fully persuades us that the
appellant had an axe to grind.

12. The investigating officer dispatched, the crime empties
collected from the spot alongwith .30 bore pistol recovered from
the possession of the appellant, to the firearms expert to
ascertain as to whether the collected empties were fired from the
recovered pistol. The firearms expert after chemical analysis
held that the same were fired from the recovered pistol and in
that respect a positive report was submitted. The number of
empties collected from the spot confirms the stance of the
complainant as the deceased was having two entry wounds on
his abdomen. The safe custody right from collecting the empties
from the spot and its dispatch with the recovered weapon, to the
firearms expert has been proved on record. The investigating
officer recorded the statement of all the concerned police
officials including, Muharrir of the concerned police station in
whose custody the articles were lying and the police official who
took the same to the laboratory, they were produced before the

Court and their statements were recorded. Both the witnesses

t|

-17-

were thoroughly examined on material aspects of the case, but
they remained consistent throughout. The positive laboratory
report is a circumstance that supports the statement of the
complainant to a greater extent. True that the laboratory report,
in itself, is not sufficient for convicting an accused charged, but
equally true that it can be considered a circumstance in aid to the
collected evidence. In the present case, we lurk no doubt in mind
that the report of the complainant is fully supported by the
positive laboratory report.

13. Next important piece of evidence is the medical report,
which fully supports the prosecution case. The number of
injuries on person of the deceased and the empties collected
from the spot support the stance of the complainant. We are
fully convinced that the appellant made two fire shots and the
deceased received the two, so the medical evidence fully
supports the stance of the complainant. True that medical
evidence is confirmatory in nature which alone is not sufficient
for the conviction of an accused charged, but equally true that
when the prosecution otherwise succeeds in bringing on record
strong evidence in its favour then medical evidence has the key
role to play and the present case is no exception. It was
vehemently argued that dying declaration is a weak kind of
evidence and is hardly sufficient for the conviction of an

accused charged. We are afraid that the defence went wrong
-18-

while asking our indulgence in its favour. It has never been held
that the declaration of a dying man worth no consideration, but
instead much care is advised and for that purpose, precautionary
measures were asked. If we hold that dying declaration is a weak
type of evidence we never intend that it has no sanctity, if such
would be the intention then the Courts of law would commit an
error which is hard to be rectified. The legislature was fully
conscious of its importance that is why its glimpses can be seen
in the Evidence Act, with its later implantation in the shape of
Article 46 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. While dealing
with the matter, one must be aware of the guidelines given and
parameters provided by the superior courts from time to time. As
discussed earlier that the deceased then injured was capable to
talk, the next test is to see the worth of the collected evidence
and the extent of support it provides. The continuous struggle of
the investigating officer to collect the most reliable evidence has
blessed the report with sanctity. As discussed earlier, a well knit
chain of events is available that touches the two ends and we
find it hard to discard. The continuity of events offers no space
for indulgence and we, with no hesitation, hold that the
prosecution succeeded in labeling the convict / appellant as the
actual killer. In case titled “Naveed Asghar and two others Vs
the State (PLD2021 SC600), it is held that:

“The settled approach to deal with the

question as to sufficiency of
-19-

circumstantial evidence for conviction
of the accused person is this: If, on the
facts and circumstances proved, no
hypothesis consistent with the
innocence of the accused person can be
suggested, the case is fit for conviction
of the accused person on_ such
conclusion; however, if such facts and
circumstances can be reconciled with
any reasonable hypothesis compatible
with the innocence of the appellant, the
case is to be treated one of insufficient
evidence, resulting in acquittal of the
accused _person.13_ — Circumstantial
evidence, in a murder case, should be
like a well-knit chain, one end of which
touches the dead body of the deceased
and the other the neck of the accused.
No link in chain of the circumstances
should be broken and the
circumstances should be such as
cannot be explained away on any
reasonable hypothesis other than guilt
of accused person. Chain of such facts
and circumstances has to be completed
to establish guilt of the accused person
beyond reasonable doubt and to make
the plea of his being innocent
incompatible with the weight of
evidence against him. Any link missing
from the chain breaks the whole chain

and renders the same unreliable; in
-20-

that event, conviction cannot be safely
recorded, especially on a_ capital
charge.14 Therefore, if the
circumstantial evidence is found not of
the said standard and quality, it will be
highly unsafe to rely upon the same for
conviction; rather, not to rely upon
such evidence will a better and a safer
course.15”

14. It was argued that the prosecution could not succeed in
proving the alleged motive as no independent witness was
examined by the investigating officer in that respect. True that
no witness came forward to tell that there was a previous ill-will
between the two and that it was because of the active connivance
of the deceased that the appellant was booked in several criminal
cases, but we cannot forget that the investigating officer placed
on file copies of different FIRs, where the appellant was charged
in narcotic cases. As the appellant was convicted in all the cases
he was charged in, so we are confirmed in our belief that there
was bitterness between the two which led to the death of the
deceased. There is no cavil to the proposition that absence or
weakness of motive, by itself, is not sufficient to dislodge the
case of the prosecution, rather the same can play a role in
persuading the mind of the Court for awarding lesser sentence.

15. The matter does not end here; we are still to walk an extra
mile with the only zest to discover the real mode of the incident.

We want to unearth the way the incident occurred and the place

-21-

where the deceased was done to death, as the very report of the
complainant has created confusion on this particular aspect of
the case especially, when it is considered in light of the prepared
site plan, the collected empties and the recovered blood. The
report of the complainant has twisted the incident. The conflict
between the site plan and the report has created the atmosphere
of uncertainty. Mystery prevails throughout that has created an
atmosphere of confusion regarding the exact place and the exact
mode of the incident. The report tells that soon after reaching to
the village on his motorbike, the appellant on seeing the
deceased fired at him. It is further mentioned that after receiving
firearm injuries, the injured was shifted to the hospital by people
of the locality. If we accept to what the complainant stated then
the blood and empties should have been recovered from the
thoroughfare, but these were not. The site plan depicts that the
incident occurred inside the maize crop which was of man’s
height. This is surprising that the spot field was surrounded by
many more fields all having maize crops. It is astonishing to
note that while preparing the site plan, the investigating officer
noted that an area of 6x6 feet in the maize crop was trampled as
the two had struggled before the deceased was fired at. This is
for the prosecution to tell that what brought the two inside the
maize crop and that for what purpose. We struggled hard to find

an answer, but despite efforts we could not. The complainant

-22-

while reporting the matter suppressed the real facts. Had the
Investigating Officer recorded statements of the people who
shifted the deceased then injured to the hospital, the mystery
would have been resolved, but his lack of interest has added
much in creating a state of uncertainty which despite efforts we
failed to resolve. The recoveries effected from inside the field
confirm that the deceased received firearm injuries in the field. It
is a begging question that what led the two inside the field and
that why they engaged in physical struggle which trampled the
crop. This particular aspect of the case leads us to hold that both
the deceased and the appellant came forward with twisted facts
and as such if on one side the appellant is responsible for the
death of the deceased then on the other the conduct of the
deceased is not above board. The learned trial judge failed to
appreciate this aspect of the case and went in haste while
convicting the appellant. We are still to know the reasons
prevailed with the learned trial judge which held the appellant
responsible under section 302 (a) P.P.C. We cannot ignore that
the requirements for conviction under section 302(a) P.P.C are
altogether different and the learned trial Court failed to justify,
so we lurk no hesitation in mind that the learned trial Court fell
in error while convicting the appellant under section 302(a)
P.P.C, as such the awarded sentence is legally incorrect and the

learned trial Judge while awarding the sentence misdirected

-23-

himself both in law and on facts of the case. We are to answer
that what should have been the appropriate sentence, more
particularly when both the sides suppressed the real facts and
consciously attempted to create an atmosphere of uncertainty as
has been held in case titled “Abdur Rahim Vs The State” (2021
YLR Note 139):

“The factum of suppression of real facts of the
appellant by both the sides, are the
circumstances suggesting the act of firing by
the appellant to have been committed in
exercise of his defence, the benefit of which can
be extended to him irrespective of the fact that
he did not specifically take that plea during
trial. Reliance is placed on case titled "Ghulam
Fareed v. The State" (2009 SCMR 929),
wherein it has been held that:

"The appellant did not raise this plea during
trial either in his statement under section 342,
Cr.P.C. or at the time when the prosecution
witnesses were subjected to  cross-
examination. There is no bar to raise such
plea despite having not taken the said plea
specifically during trial, and the court can
infer the same from the evidence led during
trial, if the same is tenable. However, to
justify such an inference, in favour of the
accused who stands convicted on a murder
charge and sentenced to death, his conduct
during the occurrence should fall within the

parameters of private defence, as codified in

-24-

the Pakistan Penal Code."
16. We without hesitation hold that the appellant deserves to
be punished under section 302(c) PPC and not under section
302(a) PPC. We, therefore, partially allow the appeal by setting
aside the conviction and sentence awarded under section 302(a)
PPC and convict the appellant under section 302(c) PPC to 15
years rigorous imprisonment. The compensation of
Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lacs) imposed upon the appellant
under section 544-A Cr.P.C as well as his conviction and
sentence of imprisonment and fine under section 15-AA by the
trial Court shall remain intact. Both the sentences shall run
concurrently. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C is extended in
favour of the appellant. The Murder Reference No.02-B/2021 is
answered in negative. As after appreciating the evidence
available on file the awarded sentence has been reduced to 15-
years RI, so the criminal revision No. 34-B of 2021 has lost its

utility and the same is dismissed as such.
