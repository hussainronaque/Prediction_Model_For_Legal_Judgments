ORDER

Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, J.: The case in hand is a case in
which the father and a brother of Azeem Shah deceased and
another had allegedly killed the deceased by firing at him. The
motive set up by the prosecution was that there was a dispute
between the parties over some landed property but no independent
proof in support of the alleged motive had been adduced before the
trial court. In the absence of an established motive there was no
earthly reason why respondent No. 2 would join others in killing
his own son. According to the FIR as well as the statement made
by the solitary eyewitness namely Rahat Shah complainant (PW9)
respondent No. 2 and two others had effectively fired at the
deceased whereas the report received from the Forensic Science

Laboratory established that all the five crime-empties secured from

the place of occurrence had been fired from one and the same .30
bore weapon. This meant that exaggeration to the extent of
respondent No. 2 was quite possible. Rahat Shah complainant
(PW9) was the solitary eyewitness and he had claimed that he had
taken the deceased to the hospital in an injured condition whereas
the doctor medically examining the injured deceased appearing
before the trial court as PW5 had categorically stated that the
deceased was brought to the hospital in an injured condition by
Maaz Ullah, F.C. This was also indicative of the fact that the
complainant was not with his injured brother when the said
brother had been injured at the spot. According to the site-plan of
the place of occurrence the deceased had been fired at from his
front side whereas the medical evidence showed that five out of the
eight firearm entry wounds received by the deceased were on his
back which also suggested that the solitary eyewitness produced
by the prosecution had in fact not seen the occurrence. For all
these reasons the High Court had concluded that the prosecution
had failed to prove its case against respondent No. 2 beyond
reasonable doubt and we have not been able to take any legitimate
exception to the said conclusion reached by the High Court. This

petition is, therefore, dismissed and leave to appeal is refused.
