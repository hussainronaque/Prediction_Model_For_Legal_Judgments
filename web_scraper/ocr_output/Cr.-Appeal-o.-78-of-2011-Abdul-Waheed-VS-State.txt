QALANDAR_ALI_KHAN,J:- Since this
appeal by appellant, Abdul Waheed, and Cr.R
No.29/2011 emanate from one and the same

. judgment of learned Additional Sessions

\

Judge-IV, Mansehra, dated 17.05.2011, in
case vide FIR No.316 dated 16.08.2008
under Sections 302/34 PPC Police Station
Baffa, this single order shall also dispose of
criminal revision by Niaz Muhammad,
petitoner/complainant.

2. The case was registered on the
report of the complainant who charged the
appellant and his brother Abdur Rashid for

‘Qatl-i-Amd’ of his brother Dil Muhammad
and wife of the appellant, Mst Noreen Bibi,
inside the house of the appellant. In his
report, the complainant disclosed that while
he was present in the Tobaco shop of one
Khaliq Dad and his deceased brother, who
was employed with the appellant, was also
present on the road side, a boy approached
him and took him to the house of the
appellant where-from he heard voice of fire
shots, whereupon he rushed to the scene of
ccurrence and found dead bodies of both Dil
Muhammad and Mst Noreen Bibi besmeared
with blood. The complainant also mentioned
name of Chan Khan son of Shamal Khan to
have witnesseAthe occurrence as an eye
witness, along with other people.

3. After registration of the case, the
local police conducted investigation, during
which, the postmortem examination of both
the deceased revealed death of Dil
Muhammad caused by multiple fire arm
injuries whereas death of Mst Noreen Bibi

caused by stab wounds. A 30 bore pistol was
recovered from the appellant and 9 crime
empties of 30 bore were also recovered from
the spot during spot inspection by the
Investigating Officer. The axe used for
causing ‘Qatl-i-Amd’ of deceased Mst Noreen
was also recovered from the house of the
appellant. Both the appellant and co-accused,
Abdur Rashid, were arrested, and the
appellant recorded confessional statement
before the learned Judicial Magistrate,
Mansehra, wherein beside confessing ‘Qatl-i-
Amd’ of both Dil Muhammad and Mst Noreen
Bibi, he revealed motive/reason for the
offence as illicit relations between the two
deceased, which enraged and provoked him
when he saw them in objectionable condition
as he entered his house.

4. After completion of investigation,
challan was submitted to the trial Court,
where the accused were charged under
Sections 302/34 PPC, to which they pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial. During trial, the

prosecution produced as many as 11
witnesses including Lady Dr. Bushra Manan
(PW.4), Dr. Muhammad Amjad (PWS), Ijaz-
ur-Rehman, Judicial Magistrate, Mansehra
(PW.6), Muhammad Afzal khan SHO (PW.10)
and Niaz Muhammad (PW.11), beside other
formal witnesses. PW.4 conducted P.M
examination of deceased Mst Noreen Bibi,
PW.5 conducted P.M examination of deceased
Dil Muhammad, PW.6 recorded confessional
statement of the appellant, PW.10 is the
investigating officer and PW.11 is
complainant. It may, however, be added here
that even the complainant is not an eye
witness as he himself stated in the FIR that
he was attracted to the spot on hearing of
fire shots. In other words, not a single eye
witness was produced by the prosecution,
and the prosecution case was, as such, based
on the confessional statement of the
appellant, which was also reiterated in the
statement under Section 342 Cr.PC of the
appellant. During trial, major legal heirs of

deceased Mst Noreen Bibi, namely, Mst
Begum Jan, her mother, and Mst Parveen
Bibi, her sister, entered into compromise with
accused and also recorded their statements
in the trial Court to the effect that they have
pardoned the accused facing trial, by further
disclosing that deceased Mst Noreen Bibi was
also survived by a minor brother, Khursheed
aged about 8 years, and minor sister, Mst
Amna aged about 6 years, who were being
looked after by their mother, Mst Begum Jan,
who also expressed no objection to the
cquittal of the accused on behalf of her
minor children.

5. On conclusion of trial, the learned
trial Court/Additional Sessions Judge-IV,
Mansehra, while acquitting the co-accused
Abdur Rashid of the charge levelled against
him “due to lack of proof”, convicted the
appellant for offence punishable under
Section 302 PPC “vis-a-vis Qatl-i-Amd of
deceased Dil Muhammad”; and sentenced him
to rigorous imprisonment for a term of fourteen

years with fine of Rs.100000/-. In case of
non-payment of fine, the convict was to
further undergo simple imprisonment for six
months. Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.PC was
extended in his favour. As for charge of
offence relating to ‘Qatl-i-Amd’ of deceased
Mst Noreen Bibi, the appellant was also
convicted for the offence in the terms that;
“For the matter on sentence of latter
conviction, it is apt to clarify that he i.e.
convict Abdul Waheed would have been liable
for the sentence of ‘Qisas, if two out of the
four legal heirs of deceased Mst Noreen Bibi
had not waived their right of Qisas as
discussed earlier in Paragraph-11 of this
judgment. Therefore, having regard to the
observations in Paragraph-11 ibid; convict
Abdul Waheed is held liable for payment of
‘Diyat’, within the meaning of Subsection (2)
read with its proviso of Section 309 PPC, to two
legal heirs (namely Khursheed and Mst Amina)
of deceased Mst Noreen bibi who have neither
waived nor compounded the right of Qisas. The

amount of ‘Diyat’ to the extent of
respective shares of said legal heirs shall be
determined having regard to the monetary
value of ‘Diyat’ notified by the Federal
Government for the fiscal year commencing
from July 1, 2008.”

6. In the detailed reasons recorded in
the impugned judgment/order dated
17.05.2011, the learned trial Court accepted
the plea of sudden provocation to the extent
of ‘Qatl-i-Amd’ of deceased Dil Muhammad
and, therefore, convicted him under Section
302© PPC; but, on the other hand, declined
to accept the plea of sudden provocation in
respect of ‘Qatl-i-Amd’ of Mst Noreen Bibi on
the grounds that ‘Qatl-i-Amd’ of deceased Dil
Muhammad was caused by fire arm whereas
‘Qatl-i-Amd’ of Mst Noreen Bibi was caused
by stab wounds and some blunt means
causing fracture of skull, damage to brain
matter; coupled with the fact that time
between death and P.M examination of

deceased Dil Muhammad was shown less
than 12 hours while that of Mst Noreen Bibi
was revealed as more than 12 hours.

7. Arguments of learned counsel for
the appellant, Additional Advocate General
assisted by learned counsel for complainant
heard, and record perused.

8. At the very outset, the learned
counsel for the appellant submitted a
certificate from the Superintendent, Central
prison, Haripur, showing that substantive
sentence including sentence in default of
payment of compensation of the appellant
had expired on 17.11.2014 and that he was
presently confined in jail only for non-
payment of ‘Diyat’ amount. The learned
counsel for the appellant, therefore, stated at
the bar that he would not press his appeal
against conviction and sentence of the
appellant under Section 302 © PPC regarding
‘Qatl-i-Amd’ of deceased Dil Muhammad, and
that he would confine his arguments to the
conviction of the appellant and his liability to

pay ‘diyat’ within the meaning of subsection-
— 2 read with its proviso of Section 309 PPC to
two legal heirs (namely Khursheed and Mst
Amina) of deceased Mst Noreen bibi. The
Learned counsel vehemently contended that
in the absence of other corroborative ocular
evidence, the sole basis for conviction of the
appellant on both counts was his confessional
statement, also reiterated in his statement
under Section 342 Cr.PC; therefore, the
confessional statement should have been
either accepted or rejected in toto instead of
ccepting one part of the _ confessional
statement, while rejecting the other. The
learned counsel challenged the wisdom of
making a distinction on the ground of nature
of weapon of offence and a slight difference
in duration between death of both the
deceased and their P.M examination. Learned
counsel further contended that the learned
trial Court should have either accepted
compromise of the legal heirs of deceased
Mst Noreen Bibi, including minor legal heirs,

under Section 309 PPC’ read with

ee
oN

10

Section 345 (2) Cr.PC or should have also
convicted the appellant under Section 302 (c)
PPC on account of ‘Qatl-i-Amd’ of Mst.
Noreen Bibi.

9. The learned Additional Advocate
General assisted by learned counsel for the
complainant, on the other hand, argued that
the appellant had confessed his guilt of
committing the gruesome murder of both the
deceased, including his wife, but was treated
leniently, though deserving normal penalty of
death. They maintained that in addition to his
confessional statement before Judicial
Magistrate during investigation, the appellant
had also confessed again before the trial
Court in his statement under Section 342
Cr.PC, without showing any remorse and
penitence. They further contended that the
prosecution had established its case beyond
any shadow of doubt, therefore, the
appellant deserved capital punishment for

the double murder.
11

10. Adverting straightaway to the
conviction of the appellant and his liability to
pay ‘diyat’ to minor legal heirs of deceased
Mst Noreen Bibi, it would, indeed, be relevant
to refer to record of the case, and point out,
without fear of contradiction, that the entire
case of the prosecution hinges on the
confessional statement of the appellant,
reiterated in his statement under Section
342 Cr.PC; and, undoubtedly, conviction of
the appellant is also, primarily, based on his
onfessional statement, therefore, in the
circumstances, the confessional statement
being solitary piece of evidence, must have
been relied upon in toto without any pick and
chose (2004 SCMR_ 41808). It has
consistently been held by the superior Courts
in the country that statement of the accused
has to be accepted in totality and without
scrutiny (1992 SCMR 2017 and PLD 1996
Karachi 316). Since the occurrence and
‘Qatl-i-Amd’ of both the deceased was for the

same reason i.e. provocation of the appellant
12

after seeing his wife in objectionable
condition with deceased Dil Muhammad, use
of different weapons of offence and
difference in duration of death and P.M of the
deceased became immaterial, so as to judge
the ‘Qatl-i-Amd’ of the two deceased
differently by holding one as result of sudden
provocation and the other devoid of such
consideration, rendering the same liable to
‘Qisas’. Moreover, Mst Begum Jan, being
mother of both her minor son and daughter,
as their natural guardian and thus fully
ompetent to also enter into compromise on
ehalf of her minor children (2002 MLD
1277, Lahore). Therefore, the trial Court
should have either accepted compromise
between major legal heirs of deceased Mst
Noreen Bibi also on behalf of her minor legal
heirs, or should have convicted the appellant
under Section 302 © PPC while accepting the
plea of grave and sudden provocation of the
defence in respect of ‘Qatl-i-Amd’ of

deceased Mst Noreen Bibi as
13

well. The conviction of the appellant and
making him liable to pay ‘diyat’ to the minor
legal heirs of Mst Noreen Bibi was, therefore,
not justified in view of the _ forgoing
discussion.

11. As regards revision petition for
enhancement of sentence of the appellant
from imprisonment to death, suffice it to say
that the appellant has already undergone the
substantive sentence of imprisonment
including sentence in default of payment of
compensation, therefore, enhanced sentence
of death would amount to double jeopardy
(2002 SCMR 1993). Therefore, the revision
petition, being bereft of substance, is
dismissed.

12. Consequently, the appeal to the
extent of conviction of appellant under
Section 302© PPC in respect of ‘Qatl-i-Amd’
of deceased Dil Muhammad is dismissed as
not pressed; while his conviction and liability
to pay ‘diyat’ to the minor legal heirs of

deceased Mst Noreen Bibi is converted into
14

conviction under Section 302 © PPC and the
appellant, Abdul Waheed, is deemed to also
have been sentenced to rigorous
imprisonment for a term of 14 years with fine
of Rs.100000/- and in case of non-payment
of fine to further S.I for six months, with
benefit of Section 382-B Cr.PC; and
sentences on both counts i.e. ‘Qatl-i-Amd’ of
Dil Muhammad and Mst Noreen Bibi, running
concurrently.

13. The appeal and revision petition

are disposed of accordingly.
