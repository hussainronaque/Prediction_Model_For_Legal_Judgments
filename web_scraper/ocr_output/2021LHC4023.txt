2. Being dissatisfied from his conviction,
appellant has assailed the judgment of learned trial
Court through the instant criminal appeal.

3. Facts of the case are that on 02.05.2012 upon
receipt of information of the occurrence Javed Ahmad
SI (Pw-11) arrived at place of occurrence in Chak
No.309, where Tanvir Ahmad (Pw-5) made a
statement (PC) where he maintained that his sister
Nasreen Bibi was married with Muhammad Umar
(appellant); for the last two months she was residing
with them because of hostile relations with her
husband; the appellant by giving threats used to force
them to send Nasreen Bibi with him; he/complainant
and his father got him realized many a times and
asked that he should send his parents for this purpose,
but appellant did not agree on it; on the day of
occurrence (02.05.2012) at about 05:30 pm
he/complainant, his father Abdul Sattar, uncle
Ghulam Rasool (Pw-6) and his brother Imran while
sitting in the house were busy in conversation; at that
occasion Muhammad Umar, Abdul Razzaq and
Mushtaq armed with Pistols came there on a
motorbike No.VRO-8557; when Abdul Sattar asked
from appellant for reason to come there, he made a
fire that hit on the left side of chest of Abdul Sattar
who being injured fell down and died at the spot,
whereas all accused escaped from crime scene.

4. Appellant was arrested on 17.06.2012 and from
his possession a Pistol 30-bore was also recovered.

5. On conclusion of investigation report under
Section 173 Cr.P.C (Challan) was submitted in Court.
6. A charge under Sections 302/452/34 PPC was
framed against appellant and his co-accused for which

they pleaded not guilty and demanded their trial.
Criminal Appeal No. 88-J of 2015 3
Muhammad Umar vs. The State & 2 others

7. In support of its case prosecution had produced
Ghulam Abbas HC/author of FIR (Pw-1), Muhammad
Nawaz  Constable/parcels depositor (Pw-2),
Muhammad Arshad who identified the dead body
(Pw-3), Zafar Iqbal HC/Moharrar (Pw-4), Tanvir
Ahmad/complainant (Pw-5), Ghulam Rasool/eye
witness (Pw-6), Dr. Muhammad Fayyaz (Pw-7),
Naseem Ahmad Constable who escorted the dead
body for postmortem examination (Pw-8), Atique-ur-
Rehman Patwari who prepared scaled site plan
(Pw-9), Muhammad Riaz Constable witness of arrest
of appellant (Pw-10) and Javaid Ahmad SI/I.O (Pw-
11).

8. After the prosecution’s evidence was closed,
appellant and his co-accused were called for their
examination under Section 342 Cr.P.C. To the
question that why this case was against him and why
witnesses deposed against him, version of appellant
was as under: -

“I being the son-in-law of Abdul Sattar
deceased and brother-in-law of complainant
has been implicated in this case falsely after
consultation and deliberation. I cannot think
even to kill my father in law. The lame
excuse of my strained relations with Nasreen
Bibi my wife has been pretended just to
implicate me in this case by the complainant
and the PW. Both the PWs (Pw-5 & Pw-6)
are interested witnesses being closely
related inter-se. They have also made an
excuse of awarding threats to them on
telephone by me but it is without substance
and merits and neither my cell number nor
their cell numbers have been narrated in the
ExP-C/ExP-A or the same has _ been
mentioned in the depositions in ocular
account (Pw-5 & Pw-6). I have been made
an escape goat because the murderer of my
father-in-law was not traceable who was
killed by some unknown assailants and the
PWs were not eye witnesses who were
imported to be as such by Javed SI after
mediation and consolation. The statements
Criminal Appeal No. 88-J of 2015 4
Muhammad Umar vs. The State & 2 others

of both the PWs in ocular account are rife
with contradictions and improvements
regarding their sitting on the costs viz-a-viz
sitting of Abdul Sattar deceased. The
investigation was also conducted by the 1.0
in a dishonest manner just to implicate me in
the case at the instance of the complainant

party”
9. Appellant did not opt to produce defence

evidence, however he made the statement on oath in
terms of Section 340(2) Cr.P.C where he maintained
that he was present in his house when he came to
know that his father-in-law had died; he was falsely
involved in this case; pistol was also planted on him
and that he was ready to take special oath regarding
his innocence on Holy Book.

10. Learned counsel for appellant contended that
this is the duty of prosecution to prove its case beyond
reasonable doubt and for that it cannot take any
benefit from weakness of defence; the benefit of
doubt in all circumstances has to be extended in
favour of accused who is the favorite child of law;
both eye witnesses are close relatives of deceased,
therefore, their credibility is under uncertainty; the
recovery of pistol and story of motive has already
been disbelieved by the learned trial Court, whereas
the ocular account is not supported from other
medical evidence; statements of two eye witnesses do
not inspire confidence, therefore, cannot be relied
upon; after the occurrence none from complainant’s
side informed the police which indicates that none of
them was present there and they came forward later
on with a false story; there was no justification or
reason for appellant to commit the Qatal-e-Amd of
Abdul Sattar who was the father of his wife. He

finally maintained that as prosecution has badly failed
Criminal Appeal No. 88-J of 2015 5
Muhammad Umar vs. The State & 2 others

to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, therefore,
appellant deserves for acquittal.

11. On the other hand, learned DPG for the State
maintained that this is a case of absence of enmity,
therefore, question of false involvement does not
arise; occurrence took place in the day light inside the
house of complainant so question of misidentification
does not arise; mere this fact that the eye witnesses
are inter se related shall not discredit their testimony
who with quite consistency narrated the manners of
occurrence and defence was not able to shatter their
confidence in cross examination; it is a case of
promptly lodged FIR, hence question of manipulation
or consultation does not arise. He finally argued that
the learned trial Court on the basis of qualitative
evidence has rightly convicted the appellant.

12. This Appeal was admitted to regular hearing on
17.07.2021. On 17.01.2018 when it was fixed first
time for hearing, Tanveer Ahmad/Complainant
appeared and on his request that he wanted to engage
an Advocate, it was adjourned. On 27.03.2018,
08.04.2019 and 23.09.2019 the Appeal was repeatedly
fixed for hearing but no one from complainant side
came forward. On the next dates those were
08.10.2019, 12.11.2019 and 10.02.2020 follow up
notices (Pervi) was issued to complainant, but of no
consequence. Thereafter, on many dates this appeal
came for hearing and every time complainant was
absent. Many of the follow up notices issued show
that complainant was served in person or through his
brother. However reports reveal that he has gone to
Saudi Arabia. It means that complainant has no

interest in this appeal.

Muhammad Umar vs. The State & 2 others

13. HEARD

14. The learned Trial Court has disbelieved the
story of motive and recovery of pistol from the
possession of appellant, but convicted him while
relying on ocular account and medical evidence.

15. Much stress has been made by the learned DPG
on the argument that as it is a case of promptly lodged
FIR, therefore, possibility of false involvement of
appellant is out of question. I cannot hold so for the
reasons that promptitude in FIR is not enough, if on
the basis of judicial scrutiny of the evidence on record
it is found that prosecution is failed to prove its case
beyond reasonable doubt. It is also not a guarantee
that in timely recorded FIR, involvement of an
innocent person is not possible.

16. With regard to ocular account prosecution’s
story is revolving around the statements of Tanveer
Ahmad/complainant (Pw-5) who is the son of
deceased and Ghulam Rasool (Pw-6) the real uncle
(Mamoo) of complainant.

17. Dr. Muhammad Fayyaz (Pw-7) had conducted
the post-mortem examination of Abdul Sattar
(deceased) and found two injuries on his body those
were as under: -

1. An abraded collar of firearm wound
measuring 1x1 cm present at left side of
front of chest, just below the nipple with
inverted margins, blackening and
burning was present. Relevant hole was
present in Qameez and Bunyan (Entry
wound).

2. A lacerated collar of firm arm wound
present at right side of low back (right
renal area position) measuring 3cm x
2%cm with everted margins. Relevant
holes were present in Qameez and
Bunyan (exit wound).

(Emphasized)
Criminal Appeal No. 88-J of 2015 7
Muhammad Umar vs. The State & 2 others

18. In cross-examination Dr. Muhammad Fayyaz
admitted that blackening is caused as a result of fire
shot when the victim is at a three feet distance from
the assailant.

19. Tanveer Ahmad (Pw-5) facing the challenge of
cross-questioning categorically replied that “the
distance between my father and assailant was 24
Karams when my father received the fire shot’.
Admittedly 24 Karams mean fourteen feet. In scaled
site plan (PJ) the distance between deceased and
appellant has been mentioned as 3 Karams at the time
of firing, which is not disputed as 16.5 feet. In this
view of the matter there is a serious contrast in
medical and ocular account of this case.

20. On the question of conflict in medical evidence

and statements of eye witness, the apex Court in

Barkat Ali’s case’ was pleased to hold as under: -

“It is an admitted fact that eye witnesses had
stated that the deceased was hit by the
respondents at about 30-35 feet whereas
according to the medical report, there was
burning and blackening and is evident from
the statement of PW.2, therefore, ocular
account furnished by the two eye witnesses
in not in consonance with the medical
evidence which clearly contradicts the
statements of the eye witnesses. It is a settled
law that blackening appears on the dead
body in case the deceased has received
injuries at a distance of 4 feet according to
medical jurisprudence by Modi. It is a
settled law that oral evidence cannot be
accepted to the extent of its inconsistency
with the medical evidence. See Mardan Ali’s
case 1980 SCMR 889, Bagh Ali’s case 1983
SCMR 1292, Sain Dad’s case 1972 SCMR
74 and Zardshad case 1969 SCMR 644”

' Barkat Ali VS Muhammad Asif & Others 2007 SCMR 1812
Criminal Appeal No. 88-J of 2015

Muhammad Umar vs. The State & 2 others

The Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan

again in Amin_Ali’s case’ while observing similar

inconsistency, was pleased to rule as follows: -

“The medical officer found one entry wound
on her back with blackening, whereas PWs
13, 14 and 15 deposed that the fire shot was
fired from the roof of the shop. Entry wound
with blackening marks cannot be caused
from such a long distance. From the above
position, it is manifest that ocular testimony
is in conflict with the medical evidence.
Thus, the deceased and injured did not
receive the injuries in the manner as alleged
by the prosecution”

In an identical proposition the Honourable

Supreme Court of Pakistan in Muhammad Zaman’s

case* was pleased to declare that: -

“Let us assume that FIR, whose maker
passed away before his examination in the
Court cannot be looked into for any purpose
yet the prosecution versions neither rings
true nor inspire confidence when a fire arm
entry wound found on the person of PW No.
5 caused by a shot fired from a distance of
13 feet was accompanied by blackening
which is not possible beyond 3. feet.
Especially when it has never been the case
of the PW that any of the assailants fired at
him from a close or contact range. In
Modi’s Medical Jurisprudence and
Toxicology (21* Edition), at page 354, it has
been held that “Blackening is found, if a
firearm like shotgun is discharged from a
distance of not more than 3 feet”

The same proposition was taken into account in

its recent judgment by the Honourable Supreme Court

of Pakistan in Muhammad Mehboob’s case‘ and it

was observed that: -

“Two .12 caliber shot guns, one produced
by the complainant and the second
recovered pursuant to a disclosure, spell out

Muhammad Umar vs. The State & 2 others

a confrontation in close blank proximity; on
the contrary, in scaled site plan (Ex. PE/2),
inter se distance between the appellant and
the deceased is shown as 9-1/2 Karams, a
scenario that does not accommodate
autopsy findings of burning surrounding
each wound”

24. Dr. Muhammad Fayyaz (Pw-7), in cross-
examination, further replied that “it is correct that the
bullet passed through the body from upward to
down”. This obviously indicates that the assailant was
on a higher level than the deceased. Tanveer Ahmad
(Pw-5) when questioned in the process of cross-
examination, he responded that: -

“The accused when entered in the house
accused Umer was leading them the gate
from which the accused entered in the house
was towards south from my father. My
father got up from the cot and went towards
the accused. The distance between my father
and assailant was 2% Karams when my
father received the fire shot”

25. So the transparent position is that it is a case of
straight fire by appellant to Abdul Sattar (deceased))
therefore, the declaration by doctor that it was from
upward to downward has also made the prosecution’s
case doubtful.

26. The conduct of witnesses at the time of
occurrence or thereafter is quite relevant, when
examined on the touch stone of Judicial scrutiny. The
police station from crime scene was at a distance of
about 7 KMs. Real father of Tanveer Ahmad and
brother in law of Ghulam Rasool was shot dead by
appellant at about 05:30 pm but before arrival of
Javed Ahmad SI (Pw-11) none of them or any other
person present at crime scene bothered to inform the

Police. This fact was admitted by Tanveer Ahmad
Criminal Appeal No. 88-J of 2015 10
Muhammad Umar vs. The State & 2 others

without any reservation in cross-examination while
replying that neither he nor Ghulam Rasool or his
brother Muhammad Imran reported the matter to the
police. He had shown his ignorance that who
informed the police about the occurrence. This fact
that none of the witnesses informed the police is also
supported on perusal of the statement of Javed Ahmad
SI (Pw-11) who maintained that: -

“The occurrence as is incorporated in the
relevant column of FIR is 05:30 pm.
Someone informed me that occurrence has
taken place within the limits of Chak No.
309/EB. It is correct that I have recorded in
my police proceedings on over leaf Ex. PC
that I was informed by police 15. The
information by 15 was apprised through
wireless set”

27. There is also a serious discrepancy about
recording of complaint (PC) by Javed Ahmad SI
(Pw-11), whether it was reduced into writing at crime
scene Chak No. 309/EB or the story was otherwise?
The opening sentences of Javed Ahmad SI are very
important and as under: -

“On 02.05.2021, I was present to check
crime and patrolling duty at Bridge
Khaddar Canal 40/KB, complainant came
there and made a statement before me which
was reduced into black and white and the
same was Ex. PC. Then I reached the spot”

28. In cross-examination when Javed Ahmad SI
was confronted with the instance he took in his
examination-in-chief, he volunteered that “J have
committed mistake while stating that the statement of
Tanveer Ahmad was recorded by me at bridge
khaddar canal 40/KB but the same was recorded by

me at the place of occurrence”.
Criminal Appeal No. 88-J of 2015 11
Muhammad Umar vs. The State & 2 others

29. Infirmity in prosecution’s case still continues.
Narrations made by Tanveer Ahmad (Pw-5) and
Ghulam Rasool (Pw-6) are that appellant along with
his two acquitted co-accused came on a motorbike but
escaped by leaving it there. This absolutely appears to
be an abnormality in prosecution’s story, because
appellant was residing in a village that was at a
distance of 15/16 KMs. Appellant and his co-accused
were armed with pistols and they had no fear of
anyone therefore, leaving the motorbike at venue of
crime makes no sense at all. Thus, the version of
appellant he made in his statement under Section 340
(2) Cr.P.C that his motorbike was removed by the
police from his house and planted on him cannot be
tuled out.

30. Last but not least, Tanveer Ahmad claimed that
while escaping from crime scene, appellant and his
co-accused also made firing in the air but except one,
no empty whatsoever was found on spot inspection.
31. This is the settled principle of law that
prosecution cannot escape from its duty to prove the
case beyond reasonable doubt. Mr. James Q.
Whitman? in his book “The Origins of Reasonable
Doubt” while digging in deep into its past, has
written about origins that it was not primarily
intended to protect the accused, instead, strange as it
may sound, the reasonable doubt formula was
originally concerned with protecting the souls of the
jurors against damnation. According to him

convicting an innocent defendant was regarded, as a

potential mortal sin’. Referring to medieval doctrine’,
judging was a spiritually dangerous business. Any
sinful misstep committed by a judge in the course of
judging “built him a mansion in Hell.” To be a judge
in a capital case was to participate in a killing, and
that meant judging was full of spiritual peril. He kept
on saying that doubt was the voice of an uncertain
conscience, and it had to be obeyed. “In cases of
doubt,” as the standard theological formula ran, “the
safer way is not to act at all.” A judge who sentenced
an accused person to a blood punishment while
experiencing “doubt” about guilt committed a mortal
sin, and thus put his own salvation at grave risk. There
is plenty of evidence that English jurors took these
ominous threats quite seriously, especially at the end
of the eighteenth century. Jurors experienced “a
general dread lest the charge of innocent blood should
lie at their doors.” It was in response to such juror
“dread” that the reasonable doubt standard introduced
itself into the common law, especially during the
1780s. It is still with us today, a living fossil from an
older moral world. “Beyond a reasonable doubt”
standard was not originally designed to make it more
difficult for jurors to convict but it was originally
designed to make conviction easier, by assuring jurors
that their souls were safe if they voted to condemn the
accused. He finally wrote that: -

“The law cannot give any convincing
answer to the question, what is the meaning
of “beyond a reasonable doubt?”. That is a
question only history can answer”

T A mortal sin, in Catholic theology, is a gravely sinful act, which can lead to damnation if a person does
not repent of the sin before death.

5 Medieval philosophy is the philosophy that existed through the Middle Ages, the period roughly
extending from the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century to the Renaissance in the 15th
century

Muhammad Umar vs. The State & 2 others

32. The presumption of innocence is a_ legal
principle that every person accused of any crime is
considered innocent until proven guilty. Under the
presumption of innocence, the legal burden of proof is
thus on the prosecution, which must present
compelling evidence before the Court. These are the
golden principles of law that: -

a. Finding of guilt against an accused
cannot be based merely on the high
probabilities that may be inferred from
evidence in a given case.

b. Finding of the guilt should rest surely
and firmly on the evidence produced by
the prosecution.

c. Mere conjectures and _ probabilities
cannot take the place of proof otherwise
the golden rule of benefit of doubt will be
reduced to naught.

d. It is the duty of prosecution to prove its
case beyond reasonable doubt.

e. Accused is only to create dents in
prosecution’s case.

f. Benefit of doubt however slight may be
must go to accused not as a matter of
concession or grace but as a matter of
right.

g. Even a single infirmity in prosecution’s
case would entitle accused to benefit of
doubt.

33. In Muhammad Akram’ case’ the Honorable
Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to hold that: -

“It is an axiomatic principle of law that in
case of doubt, the benefit thereof must
accrue in favour of the accused as matter of
right and not of grace. It was observed by
this Court in the case of Tariq Pervez v. The
State 1995 SCMR 1345 that for giving the
benefit of doubt, it was not necessary that
there should be many _ circumstances
creating doubts. If there is circumstance
which created reasonable doubt in a prudent
mind about the guilt of the accused, then the
accused would be entitled to the benefit of
doubt not as a matter of grace and
concession but as a matter of right”

° Muhammad Akram vs. The State 2009 SCMR 230
Criminal Appeal No. 88-J of 2015 14
Muhammad Umar vs. The State & 2 others

34. On the question of single circumstance creating
doubt it was ruled by the apex Court in Muhammad
Imran’s case'” that: -

“It is by now well settled that benefit of a

single circumstance deducible from the
record, intriguing upon the integrity of
prosecution case, is to be extended to the
accused without reservation”

35. Ina latest verdict rendered in Najaf Ali Shah’s

case!! it was declared that: -

“This is an established principle of law
and equity that it is better that 100 guilty
persons should let off but one innocent
person should not suffer. As the preeminent
English jurist William Blackstone wrote,
"Better that ten guilty persons escape, than
that one innocent suffer." Benjamin
Franklin, who was one of the leading
figures of early American history, went
further arguing "it is better a hundred
guilty persons should escape than one
innocent person should suffer." All the
contradictions noted by the learned High
Court are sufficient to cast a shadow of
doubt on the prosecution's case, which
entitles the petitioner to the right of benefit
of the doubt. It is a well settled principle of
law that for the accused to be afforded this
right of the benefit of the doubt it is not
necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating uncertainty and if
there is only one doubt, the benefit of the
same must got to the petitioner. This Court
in the case of Mst. Asia Bibi v. The State
(PLD 2019 SC 64) while relying on the
earlier judgments of this Court has
categorically held that "if a_ single
circumstance creates reasonable doubt in a
prudent mind about the apprehension of
guilt of an accused, then he/she shall be
entitled to such benefit not as a matter of
grace and concession, but as of right.
Reference in this regard may be made to
the cases of Tariq Pervaiz v. The State
(1998 SCMR 1345) and Ayub Masih v. The
State (PLD 2002 SC 1048)." The same view
was reiterated in Abdul Jabbar v. State

'© Muhammad Imran vs. The State 2020 SCMR 857
" Najaf Ali Shah vs. The State the 2021 SCMR 736
Criminal Appeal No. 88-J of 2015 15
Muhammad Umar vs. The State & 2 others

(2010 SCMR 129) when this court
observed that once a single loophole is
observed in a case presented by the
prosecution, such as conflict in the ocular
account and medical evidence or presence
of eye-witnesses being doubtful, the benefit
of such  loophole/lacuna in the
prosecution's case automatically goes in
favour of an accused”

36. Concluding the discussion made above, this appeal
is allowed. Impugned judgment dated 31.03.2015 passed
by the learned Additional Sessions Judge Burewala
district Vehari is set aside. Appellant is acquitted from the
case. He is in custody and shall be released forthwith if

not required in any other case.
