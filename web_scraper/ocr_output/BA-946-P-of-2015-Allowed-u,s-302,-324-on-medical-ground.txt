QAISER RASHID KHAN, J. The petitioner seeks
bail in case FIR No. 153 dated 20.7.2014 registered
under sections 302/324/452/34 PPC, Police Station
Azakhel District Nowshera on medical grounds as
earlier his bail petition was dismissed on merits by this
court on 1.12.2014.
Arguments heard and record perused.

2. On 16.7.2015 when this petition came up for
hearing the learned counsel for the petitioner placed
reliance on the report dated 29.4.2015 of the Standing
Medical Board whereby some cardiac problem was

diagnosed but since none from among the doctors who
constituted the medical board was a cardiologist,

therefore, the Director General Health Services

Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was directed to

constitute another Standing Medical Board comprising

of a cardiologist as well for the examination of the

petitioner and to submit its report regarding the gravity

of the ailment that the petitioner is suffering from. On

01.9.2015 the Standing Medical Board submitted its

report but on 11.9.2015 when the case was again taken

up for hearing, the learned counsel for the complainant

expressed his reservations regarding the said report.

Finally on 21.9.2015 when this petition again came up

for hearing keeping in view the reservations of the

learned counsel for the respondent regarding the report,

therefore, in the interest of justice a fresh Standing

Medical Board was ordered to be constituted by the

Director General Health Services KPK Peshawar

comprising of a senior cardiologist of repute. Now that

the report of the Standing Medical Board dated

14.10.2015 is before the court wherein the cardiac
problem of the accused-petitioner has been discussed in

detail and finally it has been opined as under:

“Such patient with no improvement in his cardiac
status over these years cannot be treated in close
confinement such as lock-up or jail. He needs
further evaluation of coronary status which may
necessitate another stenting or CABG surgery. He
needs to be in easy access to cardiac care facilities
as he is prone to re-infarction, fatal arrhythmia or
sudden cardiac death. He needs lifelong
supervised cardiac treatment so he is a high
cardiac risk patient which cannot be taken care of

in jail or confinement.”

Keeping in view the report of the Standing

Medical Board according to which treatment of the

petitioner is impossible within the confines of the jail,

therefore, placing reliance on the dicta as reported in

1979 SCMR 320 “Haji Mir Aftab vs. The State”, 1998

SCMR 1065 “Zakhim Khan Masood vs. The State”

2000 SCMR 107 “Mian Manzoor Ahmad Watto ys.

The State”, PLD 2002 SC 546 “Ch. Zulfigar Ali vs.

The State” and 2004 SCMR 15 “Firdous Paul vs. The

State” this application is allowed and the petitioner is

granted bail on medical grounds provided he furnishes
bail bonds in the sum of Rs.300000/- with two sureties,

each in the like amount, to the satisfaction of the trial

court concerned which shall ensure that the sureties are

local, reliable and men of means.
