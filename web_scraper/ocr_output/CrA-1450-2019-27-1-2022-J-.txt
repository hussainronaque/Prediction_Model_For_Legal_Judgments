arising out from one and the same judgment dated 19.11.2019,

4. The prosecution’s case as per contents of First
Information Report (“FIR”) Exh.PA/1 is that on receipt of
information about the occurrence, on 13.10.2014 Khalid Iqbal
Khan SHO (PW.12) reached RHC Yar Hussain Swabi, where
complainant Jan Muhammad (PW.10), in company of dead
bodies of Hassan Ali, Mst. Kalsoom, Ghani ur Rehman alias
Bacha deceased, respectively and injured Mst. Iram at 2000 hours
reported him to the effect that on the fateful night of 13.10.2014
he along with his sons, namely, Hassan Ali, Akbar Ali, daughter-
in-law, Mst. Iram, Mst. Kalsoom wife of Wahid and other
inmates was present in his house, situated in village Bazaargai.
At 2000 hours, Shah Khalid and Shahid Murad (appellants) along
with co-accused Ghani-ur-Rehman alias Bacha (now dead), duly
armed with firearms entered his house and opened fire at them
with the intention to do them away, as a result, his son Hassan
Ali and Mst. Kalsoom got hit and died on the spot whereas, his
daughter-in-law Mst. Iram (PW.11), sustained firearm injuries.
He and his son Akbar Ali luckily remained unscathed. Similarly,

as a result of firing of Hassan Ali deceased made by him in self-
if!

Cr.A. No.1450-P of 2019

defence, one of the accused, namely Ghani ur Rehman alias
Bacha got hit and died on the spot. Motive behind the occurrence
is that some 14/15 years prior to the occurrence, Mst. Kalsoom
deceased had eloped with Wahid (brother-in-law of complainant)
and both had contracted marriage. Besides the complainant, the
incident is stated to have been witnessed by PWs Akbar Ali and

against the appellants.

8. On arrest of the appellants and completion of necessary
investigation, supplementary challan was submitted against them
before the learned trial Court, where they were formally charge
sheeted to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To
prove its case, the prosecution examined as many as fourteen
witnesses. After closure of the prosecution’s evidence, statements
of the appellants were recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C.,

wherein they denied the prosecution allegations and professed
CrA. No.1450-P of 2019

their innocence. They declined to be examined on oath or to
produce evidence in defence, however, stated that cross FIR
No.484 pending trial is their defence. On conclusion of trial, the
learned trial Court, after hearing both the sides, convicted and
sentence the appellants as mentioned in the first Para of this
judgment, hence, this appeal on behalf of the appellants against
their conviction and sentence and the connected revision petition
on behalf of the complainant for enhancement of their sentences.
9. We have heard the exhaustive arguments of learned
counsel for the parties and perused the record with their able
assistance.

10. It appears from record, particularly, the First Information
Report (FIR) that the untoward incident of this case has taken
place on 13.10.2014 at 2000 hours inside the house of
complainant Jan Muhammad (PW.10), situated in village
Bazaargai, District Swabi, which has been reported by him at
2130 hours to Khalid Iqbal Khan SHO (PW.12) in RHC Yar
Hussain. In the incident, one Hassan Ali and Mst. Kalsoom wife
of Wahid, deceased respectively, have lost their lives from
complainant side whereas one Mst. Iram has sustained firearm
injuries whereas from accused’s party one Ghani-ur-Rehman
deceased has lost life as a result of firing of Hassan Ali deceased,
allegedly made by him in self-defence when they were under the
attack of the accused party. The ocular account of the incident
has been furnished by PWs Jan Muhammad complainant and

injured Mst. Iram. The prosecution has relied upon the ocular
10
Cr.A, No.1450-P of 2019

account of the above named two witnesses as well as
circumstantial/corroborative evidence in the shape of recoveries
of blood from the places of the deceased, injured, their
bloodstained clothes, Serologist reports in respect thereof,
recovery of crime empties and crime weapons, to be discussed in
detail in later part of the judgment, as well as medical evidence,
in support of the ocular version of the prosecution’s case.
11. First we are taking the ocular account of the
prosecution’s case for reappraisal to determine as to whether the
same is truthful, trustworthy and confidence inspiring and to
what extent it has been corroborated by circumstantial pieces of
evidence as well as supported by medical evidence.

Jan Muhammad complainant while appearing as PW.10
deposed as under:-

“Deceased Hassan Ali was my son. Mst. Kalsoom
deceased was the wife of Wahid and Wahid is my
brother-in-law (sister of Wahid is married to me). Injured
Mst. Iram is the wife of my son Akbar Ali. Accused
facing trial Shah Khalid and Shahid Murad are brothers
inter-se and are  obrothers-in-law of deceased
Mst. Kalsoom (brothers of first Fiancé of Mst. Kalsoom)
while Ghani ur Rehman deceased was the uncle of
accused facing trial. On the fateful night I along with my
family members, deceased Hassan Ali, Mst. Iram, Akbar
/f / Ali including deceased Mst. Kalsoom were available
there in our house situated at Bazargai. Accused facing

; trial Shahid Murad, Shah Khalid along with deceased
Ghani ur Rehman entered out house duly armed with the
intention to kill us and started firing with their respective
firearms while my deceased son Hassan Ali by exercising

of his right of private defence started firing upon the
11 aN

Cr.A, No.1450-P of 2019
accused in retaliation. During the occurrence with the
firing of accused facing trial and deceased Ghani ur
Rehman Mst. Kalsoom and Hassan Ali received injuries
and died while PW Mst. Iram got injured and with the
firing of my deceased son Hassan Ali one of the accused
Ghani ur Rehman was hit and died on the spot while we
and other members of the family remained unhurt.
Accused facing trial decamped from the spot. Motive of
the occurrence was that some 14/15 years prior to the
occurrence my brother-in-law Wahid brought
Mst. Kalsoom deceased for the purpose of marriage. The
occurrence was seen by me, by my son Akbar Ali,
daughter-in-law Mst. Iram and other inmates of the
house. I charge the accused for the commission of
offence. Thereafter I handed over Kalashnikov of
deceased Ghani ur Rehman along with 14 live rounds and
Kalashnikov of my deceased son Hassan Ali along with
10 live rounds to the police in the hospital and lodged the
report Exh.PA/1 which I thumb impressed as a token of
its correctness while PW Mst. Iram signed my report as
verifier. The spot was pointed out by me to the I.0.”
PW Jan Muhammad has been subjected to lengthy and taxing

cross-examination through skillful hand, but nothing favourable
to defence could be extracted from his mouth while answering
the questions of defence. He remained stuck to his stance taken in
the FIR and site plan. He correctly pointed out the places of the
deceased, injured and the accused at the time of occurrence. It is
fully established from record that the occurrence has taken place
inside the house of the PW Jan Muhammad on 13.10.2014 at
2000 hours though nocturnal but in the recent days marriage of
PW Mst. Iram had taken place in the house and the prosecution

has brought ample evidence on file about availability of plenty of
”

12
Cr.A. No.1450-P of 2019

lights lit in the house at the time of occurrence, therefore,
identification of the appellants was quite possible, particularly,
when they were previously known to the complainant party.
Nothing was extracted from the mouth of PW Jan Muhammad
to the effect that on the day and time of occurrence he was not
present in the house and was present somewhere else. As per
statement of Jan Muhammad, he is 62 years old; therefore, his
presence in his house at the time of incident was quite natural and
is appealable to a prudent mind. In the initial report/Murasila,
PW Jan Muhammad has not concealed the real facts, rather has
narrated all the events occurred at the spot at the time and after
the occurrence. He is so fair and straightforward witness that he
himself handed over Kalashnikov of his son Hassan Ali deceased
to Khaliq Iqbal SHO (PW.12), the author of Murasila had
disclosed that it was the weapon used by Hassan Ali deceased in
self-defence, and as a result of his firing, accused Ghani ur
Rehman got hit and died on the spot. Similarly, he has also
handed over Kalashnikov of accused Ghani-ur-Rehman (now
dead) along with 14 crime empties fired through the same. Again,
the honesty and credibility of PW Jan Muhammad can be seen
from the fact that he along with dead body of his family
members, also shifted the dead body of Ghani ur Rehman
accused to RHC Yar Hussain despite the fact that he could easily
arrange to dispose of his dead body so as to minimize role of his
son in the incident, but he has not concealed the facts and

evidence of the occurrence. Both the appellants in their
an

13
Cr.A. No.1450-P of 2019

statements under section 342 Cr.P.C., have stated that they are
relying on case FIR No.484 dated 17.11.2014 registered under
sections 302/3243/34 PPC, on the report of Shakeel, as defence.
Record of the FIR No.484 (ibid) is available before us, wherein
complainant Shakeel has charged Jan Muhammad (PW.10) along
with his son Akbar Ali. The story narrated in FIR No.484 (ibid)
is that on 13.08.2014 Shakeel along with his uncle Ghani ur
Rehman alias Bacha and other Jirga members, namely, Ahmad
Zeb and Saeed ur Rehman went to the house of Jan Muhammad.
Dispute between the parties was that Mst. Kalsoom, who had
been engaged with Waheed Murad some 14/15 years back, had
eloped with one Wahid son of Noor ul Baz. That about a month
prior to the occurrence, Mst. Kalsoom along with her husband
Wahid had come to the house of Jan Muhammad. As Jan
Muhammad was relative of Shakeel hence, a jirga was sent to
resolve the issue of Mst. Kalsoom. During Jirga accused Jan
Muhammad and his sons suddenly turned aggressive and started
altercation with complainant Shakeel and Ghani ur Rehman, who
were separated by the Jirga members. The accused then rushed to
a room and came out with deadly weapons and started
indiscriminate firing upon Shakeel and Ghani ur Rehman as a
result the latter got hit and died on the spot, whereas, Shakeel and
Jirga members escaped unhurt.

12. It appears from record that neither Shakeel complainant
nor Ahmed Zeb and Saeed ur Rehman etc, the alleged Jirga

members, have been produced by the appellants as defence
14
Cr.A. No.1450-P of 2019

witnesses. It may be noted that FIR No.484 (ibid) has been
registered on the direction of the Justice of Peace on the
application under section 22-A Cr.P.C. of complainant Shakeel,
with considerable delay. One thing can be gathered from FIR
No.484 (ibid) that the accused party has admitted the incident but
to minimize their role, have concealed material facts of the
occurrence but the same have been honestly disclosed by PW Jan
Muhammad in the instant case. In FIR No.484 (ibid), the motive
of the instant case has also been admitted that Mst. Kalsoom had
eloped with Wahid brother in law of PW Jan Muhammad and a
month prior to the occurrence she along with her husband had
visited the house of PW Jan Muhammad and was residing there.
Murder of Mst. Kalsoom deceased, inside the house of PW Jan
Muhammad corroborate the ocular account of PW Jan
Muhammad.
13. Another eyewitness, namely, Mst. Iram aged 24/25 years,
who has stamp of injuries on her person while appearing as
PW.11, deposed as under:-

“On the fateful night, I along with my family members and

Mst. Kalsoom were present in our house. In the meanwhile,

accused facing trial along with Ghani Rehman entered our
/ house duly armed with firearms and started firing with
their respective firearms upon us. My brother-in-law
Hassan Ali while exercising right of self defence stated
firing upon the accused in retaliation. With the firing of

accused I got injured while Mst. Kalsoom and Hassan Ali
15
Cr.A, No.1450-P of 2019

got hit and died whereas Ghani Rehman deceased got hit

with firing of my brother-in-law Hassan Ali and died.

Accused decamped from the spot. I pointed out the spot to

the police after my discharge from the hospital. I charge

the accused for commission of the offence”.
14, Mst. Iram (PW.11) has also been subjected to lengthy
cross-examination by the defence but nothing beneficial to the
appellants could be extracted from her mouth. She remained
stuck to her initial stance and corroborated the testimony of
complainant Jan Muhammad on each and every aspect of the
occurrence i.e. the day, date, time and place of occurrence as well
as the mode and manner in which the occurrence took place. She
has also furnished true account of the events occurred at the spot.
She has not tried to minimize the role of firing on their behalf by
Hassan Ali deceased. She while replying to the questions of
defence has correctly pointed out the places of each deceased and
the accused at the spot at the time of occurrence. It has been
brought from her by the defence itself that first the three
assailants opened firing at them and then Hassan Ali deceased
opened fire at the assailants. Her testimony is also consistent with
PW Jan Muhammad on all the events after the occurrence i.e. her
shifting along with the dead bodies to the hospital and making
report by the complainant in RHC Yar Hussain in her presence.
Not a single question has been put to her by the defence so as to

make question the identity of the appellants.
f

16
Cr.A.No.1450-P of 2019

15. No doubt, the occurrence is nocturnal but it is evident
from record and material produced by the prosecution that it has
taken place inside the house of the complainant Jan Muhammad.
It is also proved from evidence that both the parties were
previously known to each other having serious motive of
elopement of Mst. Kalsoom deceased (lady of accused’s family)
with family members of complainant party. Similarly, during spot
inspection, Mira Khan SI (PW.13), the Investigating Officer, has
taken into possession 100 Watt bulb Exh.P.12 from the Western
wall of the spot house vide recovery memo Exh.PW.4/12 while
vide recovery memo Exh.PW.4/13, he has taken into possession
energy saver Exh.P.13 installed on the wall of southern room of
the spot house. Similarly, vide recovery memo Exh.PW.4/13 the
1.0. has also taken into possession another energy saver Exh.P.14
from the kitchen of the spot house and vide memo Exh.PW.4/14
another energy saver Exh.P.15 installed on southern room of the
spot house vide memo Exh.PW.4/15. Through recovery memo
Exh.PW.4/16 another 100 Watt bulb Exh.P.167 has also been
taken into possession by the 1.0. It has also been explained by the
prosecution witnesses that due to marriage ceremony of PW Mst.
Iram and Akbar Ali they had installed plenty of light in the spot
house. In view of the above recoveries coupled with the fact that
parties were well known to each other question of mistaken
identity of the appellant by the eyewitnesses does not arise.

16. Similarly, from the places of Mst. Kalsoom and Hassan

Ali as well as injured PW Mst. Iram, blood was secured by Mira
17
Cr.A, No,1450-P of 2019

Khan SI, the Investigating Officer, vide recovery memos
Exh.PW.4/1 to Exh.PW.4/3, which along with last wom
bloodstained garments of the deceased and that of injured
Mst. Iram was sent to the FSL, positive report whereof Exh.PK/1
corroborates the ocular account of the eyewitnesses and proves
the crime spot to be the same place as alleged by the
eyewitnesses. FSL report with regard to Kalashnikovs of
deceased Ghani ur Rehman and Hassan Ali deceased, produced
by complainant to the Author of Murasila at the time of report,
were also sent to the FSL by the 1.0. along with 14 and 04 crime
empties, and according to FSL report 14 empties were fired from
the Kalashnikov of Ghani ur Rehman deceased and 04 from that
of deceased Hassan Ali. This piece of circumstantial evidence
also corroborates the ocular account furnished by the
eyewitnesses.

17. Statement of Lady Dr. Mst. Shazana (PW.1), who
conducted autopsy on the dead body of the deceased
Mst. Kalsoom and examined injured PW Mst. Iram, also support
the ocular account of the prosecution’s case. According to
Postmortem report Exh.PM, Mst. Kalsoom met her unnatural
death due to firearm injuries to her vital organ like heart.
Similarly, as per medico legal report, PW Mst. Iram has sustained
firearm injuries. Dr. Irtaza Ajmal Khan, who had conducted
autopsy on the dead body of deceased Ghani ur Rehman alias
Bacha and Hassan Ali deceased appeared in the witness box and

affirmed the death of both the above named deceased as unnatural
fr

18
Cr.A. No,1450-P of 2019

due to firearm injuries. All the deceased have received firearms
injuries on their bodies having different dimensions meaning
thereby that different weapons have been used in the commission
of offence. In this view of the matter, medical evidence also
supports the eyewitness’s account of the instant case.

18. As stated earlier, motive advanced by the complainant
Jan Muhammad has not only been proved by the prosecution in
the instant case but also admitted by the accused party in FIR
No.484 wherein it has been alleged that on the eventful night
there was a Jirga between the parties over the issue of elopement
ofMst. Kalsoom with one Wahid, brother-in-law of the
complainant Jan Muhammad.

19. On reappraisal of the evidence available on record, we
have reached to an irresistible conclusion that the prosecution has
proved the guilt of the appellants through cogent and confidence
direct/ocular evidence corroborated by strong circumstantial
pieces of evidence and supported by medical evidence. In this
view of the matter, the learned trial court has rightly held the
appellants guilty of the offences to which no exception can be
taken.

20. Adverting to the question of quantum of sentence to be
awarded to the appellants to meet the ends of justice. Record
depicts that the appellants along with co-accused Ghani ur
Rehman (now dead), are charged for indiscriminate firing at the
complainant party. It is not certain that from the fire shots of the

three accused which of the deceased got hit. Similarly, it is also

Cr.A. No.1450-P of 2019

not certain as to from firing of which of the three accused PW
Mst. Iram sustained firearm injuries. Similarly, as a result of
firing of one of the deceased Hassan Ali one Ghani ur Rehman
has also lost his life. Considering the above aspects as mitigating
circumstances, we are firm in our view to hold that the learned
trial court has rightly no awarded the normal penalty of death to
the appellants. The sentences awarded by the learned trial court to
the appellants under each offence are quite appropriate and
justifiable under the law.

21. For what has been discussed above, this appeal filed by
the appellant-convicts and the connected Cr.R. No.287-P of 2019,
filed by petitioner-complainant Jan Muhammad, are hereby
dismissed. Judgment dated 19.11.2019 passed by learned
Additional Sessions Judge/Judge Model Criminal Trial Court,
Swabi is hereby maintained.
