Mr. Rafiq Ahmad, Assistant

HAIDER ALI KHAN, J.- This single judgment

shall dispose of the instant appeal bearing Cr.A

No.71-M/2015 titled Ihsanullah Vs. The State, as

well as the connected Cr.A No. 73-M/2015 titled

Tanvir Ahmad Vs. The State, as both the appeals

arise from one judgment dated 10.4.2015 delivered

in case F.I.R No. 19 dated 15.2.2012 under sections

380/406/411/109 PPC, sections 5 & 6 of the

Explosive Substances Act, 1908 and section 5 of

Explosive Act, 1884, by the learned Additional

[Cr.A No. 71-M/2015 Ihsanullah Vs. The State and other]
-2-

Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi, Chitral whereby the

appellants Ihsanullah and Tanvir Ahmad have been

convicted under section 380 PPC and sentenced to

five years R.I with fine of Rs.20,000/- each.

2. Precise and relevant facts of the case

per contents of the F.I.R are that on 15.2.2012 at

18:00 hours Muhammad Sohail, Admin SAMBO

Construction Company Koghozi, Chitral, handed

over an application/report addressed by Jae

Gi Lim, Administration/Procurement Manager of the

said Company, stating therein that at the previous

night someone had stolen explosives containing 22

boxes, weighing 550 kilograms of Wabax Special

worth Rs.700,821.5/- from Magazine located in

Golen Gole Warehouse. The application/written

report was incorporated into Mursila which later on

converted in F.I.R, Ex.PW-12/1.

3. Investigation of the case started during

the course whereof, one Dil Muhammad, who was

working as a foreman in the Company, was

[Cr.A No. 71-M/2015 Ihsanullah Vs. The State and other]
Tajamul*

-3-

nominated in the case as an accused by availing the

services of sniffer dogs but later on he was

discharged on 25.2.2013 on application of the DPP.

On further investigation of the case, the present

appellants/accused alongwith their seven other co-

accused were nominated in the case and after

completion of the investigation, complete challan

was submitted in the Court of learned Sessions

Judge, Chitral who entrusted the case to the learned

Additional Sessions Judge for trial of all the

accused. The trial Court framed the formal charge

against the accused but they did not plead guilty

thereto and claimed trial. On commencement of the

trial, the prosecution produced as many as 18 PWs

in support of its case out of which 16 witnesses were

examined and the prosecution closed the evidence.

Thereafter, the trial Court recorded statements of the

accused under section 342 Cr.P.C wherein they

denied the allegations levelled by the prosecution,

however, they felt no need either to be examined on

[Cr.A No. 71-M/2015 Ihsanullah Vs. The State and other]
-4-

oath in terms of section 340(2), Cr.P.C or to produce

any evidence in their defense.

After hearing the arguments, the learned

trial Court found the appellants/accused and co-

accused Muhammad Din guilty of the charge and on

conviction, sentenced them as mentioned in para

No.1. The appellant Ihasanullah has challenged his

conviction through the criminal appeal in hand

whereas appellant Tanvir Ahmad has impugned his

conviction through the connected Cr.A No. 73-

M/2015 which are being disposed of through this

single judgment.

4. Learned counsel for the appellants

argued that the impugned judgment of the learned

trial Court is against the law and facts available on

the record; that no direct evidence is available

against the appellants and the trial Court has

convicted them on the basis of weak and fabricated

evidence; that the learned trial Court has not

analyzed the prosecution evidence in its true

[Cr.A No. 71-M/2015 Ihsanullah Vs. The State and other]
Tajamul*

-5-

perspectives besides the same has been misread and

mis-appreciated which has resulted in grave

miscarriage of justice; that the prosecution has

miserably failed to prove its case against the

appellants beyond shadow of doubt and the evidence

produced by the prosecution is full of contradictions;

that the appellants have been convicted on the basis

of statement of co-accused Muhammad Din against

the settled principles of criminal law and finally the

learned counsel concluded that through the same set

of evidence other co-accused have been acquitted

whereas the appellants were illegally awarded

punishment by the trial Court.

5. As against the above, the learned A.A.G

vehemently defended the impugned judgment of the

trial Court and argued that sufficient material is

available on the record which reasonably connects

the appellants with the commission of the offence

and is sufficient for conviction of the appellants,

therefore, the impugned judgment cannot be termed

[Cr.A No. 71-M/2015 Ihsanullah Vs. The State and other]
Tajamul*

-6-

as illegal or perverse in any manner, whatsoever. He

further contended that prosecution has successfully

proved its case against the appellants beyond any

shadow of doubt through credible and convincing

evidence, hence the impugned judgment needs no

interference by this Court.

6. Arguments heard and record perused.

7. Perusal of the record shows that while

taking cognizance of the case, no sanction of the

Provincial Government was obtained as required

under section 7 of the Explosive Substances Act,

1908. For convenience sake, said provision of law is

reproduced herein below:-

“7, No Court shall proceed to the trial of
any person for an offence against this Act
except with the consent of the (Provincial
Government).”

Admittedly, the learned trial Court has

proceeded with the trial without any sanction in this

regard on behalf of the Provincial Government

which is the mandatory provision of Section 7 of the

Act ibid and in case of non-compliance of the same,

[Cr.A No. 71-M/2015 Ihsanullah Vs. The State and other]
-7-

the whole trial stands vitiated. It is well settled that

where a thing was provided to be done in a

particular manner, it must be done in that manner

otherwise the act would not be lawful. In the present

case, the trial Court has acted in violation of

mandatory provision of law and hence the trial was

vitiated. Reliance in this regard can be placed on

() 1995 P.Cr.L.J_ (Karachi) 177 (2) 2011 YLR

(Lahore) 522 (3) 2012 P.Cr.L.J (Peshawar)

844 and (4) 1998 P.Cr.L.J (Karachi) 1262.

8. Another important aspect of the case is

that samples of the explosives were sent to the F.S.L

and the report furnished in this regard is in positive,

but neither the explosives nor the F.S.L report has

been exhibited before the Court which is another

glaring illegality committed by the trial Court.

9. Even on merits, perusal of the record

shows that the appellants were charged one year

after the occurrence which took place on 15.2.2012

and the trial Court convicted them on the statement

[Cr.A No. 71-M/2015 Ihsanullah Vs. The State and other]
Tajamul*

-8-

of their co-accused. Record also shows that there is

no eye witness to the occurrence and no recovery of

the explosives has been effected from the appellants.

10. As regards confession of the appellant

Tanvir Ahmad, record shows that the appellant had

recorded his confessional statement before the Court

but later on he retracted the same. In such like

situation the Court has to see whether the retracted

confessional statement is corroborated by other

circumstantial evidence or otherwise. The available

material on the record shows that corroboration of

the retracted statement of the appellant Tanvir

Ahmad by the remaining evidence is not of the

degree on the basis whereof his conviction could be

recorded. Moreso, conviction of the appellants on

the basis of statement of co-accused, their

nomination in the case after the lapse of one year

and non effecting recovery of the explosives from

their possession, are the factors which create doubt

[Cr.A No. 71-M/2015 Ihsanullah Vs. The State and other]
-9-
in a prudent mind, benefit of which must go to the
accused.
11. For what has been discussed above,
both the appeals are allowed, the impugned
judgment dated 10.4.2015 of the trial Court is set
aside and the appellants are acquitted of the charge
levelled against them. The appellants are in jail,
therefore, they be released forthwith if not required
in any other case.

Above are the reasons of my short order
of the even date.

Announced.
