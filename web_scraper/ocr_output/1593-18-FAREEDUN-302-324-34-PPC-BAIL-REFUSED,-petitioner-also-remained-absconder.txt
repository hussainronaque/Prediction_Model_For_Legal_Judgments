SHAKEEL AHMAD:-J: Petitioner Fareedun son of Zarif

Khan, seeks his release on bail in crime No.1079 dated

11.09.1999 registered under Sections-302/324/34 PPC at

Police Station Kalu Khan, wherein he is charged for

committing murder of Abdullah Jan and attempting at the

lives of complainant and one Farhad.

2. At the very outset, the learned counsel for the

petitioner drew the attention of the Court to the affidavit

sworn by the complainant Syed Mahmood Shah Bacha

appended with the petition at page-20 and argued that the

complainant has stated in the affidavit that he has falsely
charged the present petitioner, therefore, the prosecution

case requires further inquiry into the guilt of the petitioner.

3. As against that, the learned AAG representing

the State argued that the evidentiary value of the affidavit is

to be adjudged during the trial after recording evidence; that

after commission of offence, the petitioner remained at large

for more than 18 years; that the petitioner has specifically

been charged for committing murder of deceased Abdullah

Jan; the post mortem report supports the contention of the

complainant.

4. Mst. Ishrat daughter of the deceased appeared

in person and contended that the complainant has effected

compromise with the petitioner after taking money from

him, therefore, the affidavit appended with the petition is not

worth consideration.

5. I have heard the arguments of the learned

counsel for the accused-petitioner, the learned AAG

appearing on behalf of the State and daughter of the

deceased Abdullah Jan.
6. Perusal of the record reflects that petitioner is

one of the nominated accused for committing murder of

deceased Abdullah Jan and attempting at the lives of the

complainant and Farhad. After commission of offence, the

petitioner remained at large for more than 18 years, he was

arrested on 21.4.2018 and he has not offered any explanation

for his noticeable abscondence, much less plausible. It is

settled law that fugitive from law looses some of his normal

rights, procedural as well as substantial, and bail may be

refused on the sole ground of abscondence regardless of the

merits of the case. In the case titled Muhammad

Sadigq..vs..Sadiq_and others (PLD 1985 SC 182) bail

allowed by the Peshawar High Court, Abbottabad Bench,

was cancelled by the august Supreme Court, wherein there

was unexplained noticeable abscondence of 06 months of

the accused. Same view was expressed by their lordships in

the cases titled Awal Gul..vs..Zawar Khan and_ others

(PLD 1985 SC 402), and Ibrahim..vs..Hayat Gul and

others (1985 SCMR 382) and latest in the line is Raja
Fazal_ur_Rehman..vs..Muhammad_ Afzal_and_ others

(2010 SCMR 179).

7. Perusal of the Post Mortem report of deceased

Abdullah Jan reveals that he has sustained multiple firearm

injuries on his body which too supports the prosecution.

Coming to the affidavit appended with the petition, in the

absence of the complainant, I leave its evidentiary value to

be decided by the learned trial Court, mere submission of an

affidavit by the complainant as alleged by the learned

counsel for the petitioner in his absence would not make it

out a case of further inquiry.

8. Another important development worthwhile to

be mentioned is that supplementary challan has been put in

Court and trial has commenced, and in such a situation, it

has all along been the settled principle of law set by the

august Supreme Court that when the case is fixed for

evidence or the trial has begun or likely to commence, bail

application should not be considered on merits and the

matter be left to the trial Court, lest it may prejudice the case

of either side. In this respect reliance can be placed on the
cases reported as Muhammad Sadik and others..vs..The

State (1980 SCMR 203), Muhammad

Ismail..vs. Muhammad Rafique and another (PLD 1989

SC 585), Mian Dad..vs..The State and another (1992

SCMR 1418), Said Akbar and another..vs..Gul_ Akbar

and__another (1996 SCMR_ 931), and Shahid

Faroogq..vs..The State and others (2011 SCMR 1619).

9. For what has been discussed above, this petition

being bereft of merit is dismissed. However, the learned trial

Court is directed to conclude the trial expeditiously. The

office is directed to send the record back immediately.
