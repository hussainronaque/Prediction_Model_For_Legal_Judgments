3. They questioned the legality and validity of their

conviction and sentences by filing a Criminal Appeal No. 341-P/14 in
this Court, which was dismissed, vide judgment handed down on
03.2.2015 maintaining the conviction and sentences recorded by the

learned trial Court.
4. Feeling aggrieved from the conviction and sentences

rendered by the two courts, the petitioners filed a petition for leave to
appeal in the Hon’able Supreme Court, which was granted on
18.10.2016. The relevant portion of leave granting order of the
Hon’able Supreme Court is reproduced as under:-

Learned counsel for the convict-petitioners (in both petitions)
while relying on the judgment of this court in Irfan and another
v. Muhammad Yousaf (2016 SCMR 1190) has contended that
the petitioners have been charged under section 324/34 PPC
read with section 7 of the Anti Terrorism Act, 1997, under
section 353/34 PPC read with section 7 of the Anti Terrorism
Act, 1997, under section 5 of the Explosive Substances Act read

with section 7 of the Anti Terrorism Act, 1997 and section 13 of
the Arms Ordinance read with section 7 of the Anti Terrorism
Act, 1997 to face trial and were subsequently
convicted/sentenced under the aforementioned provisions of
law; that this court in the afore-referred judgment has
categorically held that it is mandatory for the learned trial
court that afier finding the accused guilty of one or more
offences, upon recording conviction, separate sentence must be
clearly awarded and that where a specific sentence for a
distinct offence was not awarded, it could not be construed that
same was impliedly awarded as the very judgment to that
extent becomes illegal and violative of the mandatory
provisions of section 367(2) & (3) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. The learned counsel went on to argue that in the
light of the observations of this court in Irfan and another
(supra), the learned trial court, in the instant case, has fallen in
error in not recording the conviction/sentence against the
petitioners separately for each distinct offence, which is not
permissible under the law.

3. Contentions raised need consideration. Leave to
appeal is therefore, granted in both the petitions to examine the
aforesaid questions and also to reappraise the entire
prosecution evidence for safe administration of criminal
justice.

5. Now, the petitioners have filed the instant Cri; Misc
application under section 426(2-B) of the Code of Criminal Procedure
for suspension of their sentences and grant of bail in the case till the
final decision of the appeal pending before the apex Court.

6. Learned counsel representing the petitioners contended
that since leave to appeal has been granted to the petitioners by
Hon’able Supreme Court, therefore, they are entitled to be released on
bail in view of the jurisdiction vested in this court under section

426(2-B) Cr.P.C.
As against that, learned AAG, appearing on behalf the
State, argued that in cases tried by Anti Terrorism Court, the said power
is not available to this Court in view of the bar contained in Section
25(8) of the Anti Terrorism Act, 1997. He went on to say that since the
petitioners/ convicts during pendency of appeal in this Court were not
on bail then how the said jurisdiction can be exercised after the decision
of appeal by invoking provisions of Section 426 (2-B) Cr.P.C, the
moreso, when the sentences awarded to the applicants are not short.
7. The moot question which falls for determination before
the Court is the applicability of the provisions of Section 426 Cr.P.C to
the cases tried by the Anti Terrorism Court as there is a specific bar in
Section 25(8) of the Anti Terrorism Act, 1997. To appreciate the
proposition, a careful appraisal of section 25 of the Act, ibid, is

necessary, which runs as under:-

25 Appeal.- (1) An appeal against the final judgment of an
Anti Terrorism Court shall lie to a High
Court.

(5) An appeal under this section shall be heard
and decided by a High Court within seven
working days.

(6&7) omitted.

(8) Pending the appeal in the High Court shall
not release the accused on bail.

A bare perusal of the provisions of Sub-Section 8 of
Section 25 of the Act, ibid, would show that because of specific bar,
sentences awarded by a Special Court cannot be suspended by the High
Court during the pendency of appeal, but it should not be read in

isolation as in sub-section 5 of Section 25, there are clear cut directions
with respect to the decision of appeal by the Court within seven
working days and here the question would be that if the appeal is not
decided within the stipulated period, and, as such, remained pending for
many years due to heavy work load of the Court then what remedy is
available to the convict that too, when his case is otherwise that of
coram non judice or short sentence or when he is suffering from
ailment, which could not be treated in the jail. There is no two opinion
about the fact that shocking delay in prosecution of a criminal cases
amounts to abuses of process of court and in a situation like the one, the
court earns the right for the grant of bail notwithstanding the bar
contained in Section 25(8) of the Act in respect of release of a convict
on bail during pendency of his appeal.

Simple is that the High Court is not deprived of the
jurisdiction to grant bail to the convict while exercising extra ordinary
jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of
Pakistan. Needless to say that the barring clause being legislation is
subordinate to the Constitution. We, in the circumstances, are clear in
mind that this court can suspend the sentence and release a convict on
bail despite the barring clause if his case is that of coram non judice or
the sentence is short and there is no possibility of hearing of appeal in
near future or where the convict during the pendency of appeal
developed an ailment of such a nature which could not be treated in jail.

8. Adverting to the merit of the instant petition, it will be

more appropriate to reproduce section 426 (2-B) Cr.P.C , which reads

as under:-

426. Suspension of sentence pending appeal: Release of
appellant on bail:

(2-B) where a High Court is satisfied that a convicted
person has been granted special leave to appeal by the
Supreme Court against any sentence which it has imposed
or maintained, it may if it so thinks fit order that pending
the appeal the sentence or order appealed against be
suspended, and also, if said person is in confinement, that
he be released on bail.

It appears from the above provisions of law that for the
suspension of the sentence granting leave to appeal is one of the
conditions, but the sentence could only be suspended if the High Court
thinks it fit, meaning thereby that discretion still rests with the High
Court. In the present case, the first requirement to avail the remedy
under section 426 (2-B) Cr.P.C is satisfied, but at the same time, the
convict is required to show that during the pendency of appeal before
the Hon’able Supreme Court, the appeal could not be disposed of
within the stipulated period, the judgment sought to be suspended

suffers from legal error and the convict was on bail during the appeal

before the High Court. Definitely while dealing with an application

under section 426(2-B) Cr.P.C, neither the merits of the case nor
reappraisal of the evidence is permitted. In the present case, during the
pendency of appeal before this court the convicts were not on bail.

9, In view of the above, we have no doubt in our mind that

the petitioners/ applicants have not been able to show good grounds to
give them relief by adhering to the provisions of 426 (2-B) Cr.P.C and

such being the position the petition stands dismissed.
