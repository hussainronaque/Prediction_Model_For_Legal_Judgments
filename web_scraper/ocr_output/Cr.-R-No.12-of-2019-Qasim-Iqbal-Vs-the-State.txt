CM No.182-B of 20189

In view of arguments advanced at the bar
the instant Cr. Misc: Application for early fixation is
allowed and main Cr. R is fixed for hearing to today.

Cr.R No.12-B of 2019

1. Complainant /petitioner has implored this
Court for transposition of the statement of Mir Daraz,
recorded as PW-2, on 08.07.2013 before the Anti
Terrorism Court, Kohat, as his statement in the
proceedings of subject mentioned F.I.R No. 178 dated
01.06.2013 PPC and section 7 of the ATA.

2. I have heard arguments of learned counsel

*M.Azam/P.S* (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz.

for petitioner and perused the available record.

3. Learned counsel for petitioner stated that

learned trial Court, Additional Sessions Judge, Karak

at Takht-e-Nasrati was legally bound to accept his

application for transposition in the light of judgment

titled “Arbab Tasleem Vs the State” reported as PLD

2010 SC 642. It was argued that statement of Mir

Daraz eye-witness in the subject mentioned F.I.R was

recorded as PW-2, at the time of proceedings under

section 512 Cr.PC against the absconding accused and

the same may be considered statement recorded in the

instant proceedings after transposition, in light of

Article 47 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984.

4. In the instant case Mir Daraz alleged eye-

witness is stated to be abroad in United States of

America and therefore, his presence before the Court

would result in prolonging trial. Under Article 46 of

the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, statement made in

some earlier proceedings is relevant, in case the

witness is no more alive/ available. Article 47 of the

*M.Azam/P.S*

(S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz.

-3-

Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984, envisages different

situation for considering relevancy of the statement

recorded in earlier proceedings subject to condition as

mentioned in proviso to the main Article Le.

proceedings must be between the same parties or their

representative in interest and adverse party in first

proceedings had right and opportunity of cross-

examination and finally question in issue are

substantially the same in the first and in second

proceedings. It appears from the impugned order that

the PW Mir Daraz real brother of the complainant had

attended the Court on 08.07.2013 and his statement

was recorded and son of PW assured the Court that his

father Mir Daraz will be back from United States of

America in the end of March, 2019. So the case was

adjourned to 04.03.2019. On 05.03.2019 this petition

was filed and the fate of the witness having attended

the Court or not, in the month of March is still

unknown. The law as it is, has to take its own course

and no one could be allowed to twist it for his own

benefit. The judgment cited at the bar has considered

such statement having evidentiary value, but such like

statement of PW -2, Mir Daraz could not be equated

with the statement that has been subject to cross-

examination. In order to give weight to the statement

of such witness the court is legally bound to consider

its intrinsic value.

5. The judgment cited at the bar has got

distinguishing features from the aspect that thrice right

of cross-examination was afforded to the other side,

but ultimately the PW was murdered. So his statement

was considered for the purpose of conviction, but in

the present case situation is different, as that statement

of PW is being required to be transposed, which was

recorded during proceedings under section 512 Cr.PC

and was not a regular trial.

6. In view of above, the instant criminal

revision petition is disposed of with the direction that

the petitioner may procure attendance of PW Mir

Daraz within shortest possible time, to avoid any more

delay as considerable delay has occurred after lodging
F.I.R in the year 2013 and specify a particular date for
recording statement of PW Mir Daraz.
