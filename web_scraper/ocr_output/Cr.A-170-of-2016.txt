under Sections 419/420/468/471/34 P.P.C.

private complaint against the accused/

SB: Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 170-M of 2016 Sherin Zada Vs. Bakht Biland and 04 others)
respondents under sections 419/420/468/471/
34 P.P.C. in the Court of learned Judicial
Magistrate, Chakdara, Dir Lower. Assertions
of the appellant in the complaint are that a
civil case between the owners/possessors over
the landed property of villages Dherai and
Khair Abad is subjudice before the Member,
Board of Revenue and the residents of Dherai
have appointed respondent Bakht Biland to
pursue that case on their behalf. The appellant
further alleged that respondent Bakht Biland
has fraudulently produced a fake power of
attorney on his behalf before the said forum
which has been attested by respondents
Khaista Muhammad and Waris Khan who are
equally responsible for committing the offence

of fraud/forgery.

3. The learned trial Court after
recording statement of the appellant under
Section 200, Cr.P.C. directed the S.H.O
concerned for detailed report. After receipt of
the report, the accused/respondents were
summoned and after fulfilling the formalities

of Section 241-A, Cr.P.C formal charge was

framed against them. On 02.06.2016, counsel
for accused submitted an application for
acquittal of the accused under Section 249-A,
Cr.P.C which was allowed vide order dated
16.07.2016 resultantly the respondents were
acquitted of the charge. Being aggrieved,
appellant filed application for special leave to
appeal before this Court against the order of
the learned trial Court which was allowed vide
order dated 31.03.2017 and special leave to
appeal was granted to him whereafter the
appeal was registered at Serial No. 170-M/

2016, the fate of which is being decided

through this judgment.

4. Arguments heard and _ record
perused.

5. The main stance taken by the

learned counsel for the appellant during the
course of arguments that the S.M.B.R or other
Revenue hierarchy is not a Court and the
learned trial Court has wrongly acquitted the
respondents/accused by considering the fact

that the complaint has not been forwarded by

SB: Mr. Justi Ibrahim

{(Cr.A No, 170-M of 2016 Sherin Zada Vs. Bakht Biland and 04 others)
the concerned Court. According to Sub-
section 2 of section 195 Cr.P.C, the term
‘Court’ includes a Civil, Revenue or Criminal
Court. For the sake of convenience, 195 (2)

Cr.P.C is reproduced below.

(2) In clause (b) and (c) of the
sub-section (1), the term “Court”
includes a Civil, Revenue or
Criminal Court, but does not
include a Registrar or Sub-
Registrar under the Registration
Act, 1908.”

Besides above, section 476 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure provides
mechanism for dealing with the complaints
made u/s 195 of the Cr.P.C, which is
reproduced herein below.

“476. Procedure in cases mentioned in
Section 195. — (1) When any offences
referred to in Section 195, sub-section
(1), clause (b) or clause (c), has been
committed in, or in relation to, a
proceeding in any Civil Revenue or
Criminal Court, the Court may take
cognizance of the offence and try the
same in accordance’ with the
procedure prescribed for summary
trials in Chapter XXII. “

Undoubtedly, the case in hand
originated as a result of the alleged fraudulent
submission of forged power of attorney in the

SB: Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 170-M of 2016 Sherin Zada Vs. Bakht Biland and 04 others)
TejamulPs*

matter which was subjudice between the
parties before the Member Board of Revenue,
Peshawar. Section 5 of the West Pakistan,
Board of Revenue Act, 1957 reads as follows.
“5, Powers of the Board. (1) The
Board shall be _ controlling
authority in all matters
connected with the
administration of the land,
collection of Land Revenue,
preparation of land records and
other matters relating thereto.
(2) The Board shall be the
highest Court of appeal and
revision in the revenue cases in
the Province.”

In view of such legal position, in
the opinion of this Court, the appellant have
misconceived the legal preposition at the time
of directly making complaint before the Judicial
Magistrate instead of the Court where the

matter was subjudice. In this respect, reliance is

placed on the case of ‘Ch. Atta Muhammad and

2 others Vs. The State and another’ reported in

1981 PCr.LJ 55.

6. Moreover, the impugned order
was also perused which reveals that the
learned trial Court has acquitted the accused

by pressing into service the provisions of

SB: Mr, Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

{(Cr.A No. 170-M of 2016 Sherin Zada Vs. Bakht Biland and 04 others)
TajamuvPs*

Section 195(1)(c), Cr.P.C. The next contention
of learned counsel for the appellant is that the
learned trial Court has misinterpreted the
above provision as the respondents have also
been charged under Sections 419, 420 & 468,
P.P.C. No doubt, apart from Section 471, the
appellant has also charged the accused under
Section 419, 420 and 468 of the Pakistan Penal
code but his main allegation is that of a fake
power of attorney which was submitted on his
behalf in the Court of Member, Board of
Revenue. Using of a forged document as
genuine is an offence punishable under Section
471, P.P.C for which the accused are mainly
charged whereas the remaining offences are
ancillary in nature and appears to have been
levelled malafide, in order to extend the scope
of the complaint and to meet the question of
jurisdiction of the learned trial Court in the
matter, admittedly, the Court in which the civil
case is subjudice has not made any complaint,
therefore, the learned trial Court was not

Competent within the meaning of ibid referred

SB: Mr. Ightiag Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 170-M of 2016 Sherin Zada Vs. Bakht Biland and 04 others)
Section 195(1)(c), Cr.P.C to take cognizance

of the offence.

7. In light of the above discussion,
the learned trial Court has committed no
illegality by acquitting the respondents from the
charge in this case. Therefore, this appeal,

being devoid of merits, is dismissed.
