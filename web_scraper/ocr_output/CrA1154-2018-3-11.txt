JUDGMENT

LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- Through this
judgment, we shall also decide Cr.R
No.170-P of 2018 titled  “Fida
Muhammad Vs Manzoor etc” as both the
matters have emanated from judgment
dated 08.12.2018 of the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-lll, Swabi
delivered in case FIR No.27 dated
30.10.2012 under sections 302/427/34

whereby upon conviction under section
302 (b) PPC, the appellants have been

deceased under section 544-A Cr.PC.
They have further been convicted under
section 427 PPC and sentenced to
imprisonment of one year each with
benefit under section 382-B Cr.PC.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on
30.10.2012, deceased Baz Muhammad,
the then injured, himself reported the
matter to SI Jehanzeb (PW-9) in Civil
Hospital, Kalu Khan to the effect that he
was proceeding on motorbike from his
house to “arhat” and when reached the
place of occurrence there appellants
Manzoor and Ayaz, both sons of Iqbal,
appeared duly armed with firearms and
started firing in order to kill him with
which he was hit. As per FIR , the
occurrence was witnessed by one Fida
Muhammad. Motive as given in the First
Information Report was a dispute over
crops between the first informer and the
appellants who were working in the
former's fields. It was worth to mention
that the deceased was first taken to Civil
Hospital Kalu Khan for medical treatment
and then was referred to anther hospital

for further management as his condition
was critical but on his way to the hospital
he breathed his last.

3. After arrest of the accused and
completion of investigation, case was put
in Court for trial culminated in their
conviction and sentence as mentioned
above whereagainst they have filed the
instant appeal while the complainant has
preferred Cr.R No.170-P of 2018 seeking
enhancement of the sentence awarded
to the convicts.

4. Arguments heard and record gone
through.

5. Perusal of the case record would
show that no doubt both the appellants
have been charged by the deceased, the
then injured, in his FIR for their firing at
him and the occurrence was stated to
have been witnessed by PW-10 Fida
Muhammad but the important fact for
determination in the case is that the
ocular account has been furnished by
uncle of the deceased and as such his
testimony is to appreciated with much
care and caution. No doubt, evidence

provided by closely related eyewitness is
as good as given by _ another
independent witness having no relations
with the victim but before placing
reliance on the ocular account of the
related witness the Courts always look
for independent source which could
corroborate such evidence and same is
taken into consideration only _ for
recording conviction of the accused if
same is corroborated by independent
circumstantial evidence and factors of
the case.

6. If on the touchstone of the above,
the testimony of sole eyewitness in the
case namely Fida Muhammad (PW-8) is
tested it would then appear that same
lacks corroboration from related
circumstantial evidence of the case
because according to the medical
examination, the deceased has
sustained two firearm entry wounds on
his person, i.e. one on medial aspect of
the middle part of his left thigh and the
other on front of his right leg below the
knee joint and per medico-legal report

furnished by Dr. Fazle Hadi (PW-8)
dimensions of both the injuries sustained
by the deceased are of one and the
same size i.e. 1/2” x 1/2” inches. Besides
the above, another point in the case for
consideration is that though from the
spot though three empties of 7.62 bore
were taken into possession by the
investigating agency but there is no
report of FSL which could show that the
recovered empties were fired from one
or more than one weapon. Omission on
the part of the prosecution to produce
FSL report to the ibid aspect has cast
reasonable doubt on its case in absence
of which and keeping in view the
similarity of dimensions of the injuries, it
cannot be held with certainty that the
deceased was done to death by more
than one man as is the prosecution
version benefit of which shall go to the
appellants-accused being a century old
principle of criminal jurisprudence.

7. In Addition, conduct of PW-10,
namely Fida Muhammad who is uncle of
the deceased too is questionable as

according to him after taking the
deceased to Kalu Khan hospital, he
thereafter returned to his village leaving
the victim alone in critical condition who
later on was referred to another hospital
for further treatment. Leaving the injured
in critical condition in the hospital alone
and not accompanying him to another
hospital for his further medical treatment
by PW-10 is his such unnatural conduct
which cannot be expected by a prudent
mind from a very close relative. Had he
been present on the spot at the time of
firing and with the then injured in Civil
Hospital, he must have accompanied
him when he was referred to another
hospital for further management which
attitude of the witness amply excludes
his presence on the crime spot and with
the then injured in the Civil Hospital
where the report was lodged.

8. No doubt, initial version of the
occurrence was provided by the
deceased himself to PW Jehanzeb, who
testified as PW-9 but there is no material
on the case file which could show that

said report was lodged by the then
injured in immediate presence of the
Medical Officer who provided initial
treatment to him. Though, while
appearing as PW-8, Dr. Fazle Hadi has
stated that at the time of his examination,
the patient was fully conscious, able to
talk and well oriented but as he has not
stated in clear and unequivocal terms
that in his presence the then injured had
reported the matter to the police
nominating therein the appellants,
therefore, the report lodged by the then
injured (Ex.PA) on which signatures of
PW-8 do appear cannot be taken into
account as his dying declaration for
recording conviction of the appellants.

9. Site plan of the case too is not
supporting the prosecution version
according to which the eyewitness was
found present in front of the house of the
deceased for which he has not given any
explanation that what for he was
standing in front of the deceased house.
Giving no justification qua his presence
on the spot at the time of occurrence by

PW-10 shows that his presence was
procured subsequently in order to
strengthen the prosecution case.

10. Another important aspect of the
case is that PW Sher Afsar, who is rider
of the FIR, was not produced. Non-
examination of said Sher Afsar too has
weakened the prosecution case as in his
presence the then injured had reported
the matter to the local police regarding
the occurrence. Examination of PW Sher
Afsar was necessary as in his presence,
per prosecution, the deceased had
reported the matter. Thus, the
prosecution for no valid reason withheld
a very relevant piece of evidence.

11. Thorough and careful examination
of the case record shows that the
learned trial Court has not appreciated
the case evidence in its true perspective.
The deductions and conclusions drawn
by the learned trial Court making base
for recording the appellants’ conviction
are not borne out from the case evidence
for which the impugned judgment cannot

be sustained.
12. For what has been discussed
above, this appeal is allowed, conviction
and sentence recorded by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-lIll, Swabi
vide impugned judgment dated
08.12.2018 are set aside and the
appellants are acquitted of the charges
leveled against them. They be released
forthwith from custody if not required or
wanted to be detained in any other case.
13. So far as Cr.R No.170-P/2018 is
concerned, suffice it to say that as we
have set aside the impugned judgment
of conviction, therefore, this criminal
revision for enhancement of the awarded
sentences has become __ infructuous
which is hereby dismissed.

Above are the reasons of our short

order.
