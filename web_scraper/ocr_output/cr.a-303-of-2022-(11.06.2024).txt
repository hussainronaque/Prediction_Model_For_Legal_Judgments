JUDGMENT

ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, CJ.- Sahar Gul, the appellant, charged in case
No.174/PMS dated 25.11.2018, registered under sections 302 & 324
PPC in Police Station Lower Kurram, District Kurram, for committing
murder of Khaista Jan deceased (grandfather) and attempting at the
life of Muhammad (brother) of his wife Mst. Shakila, respectively, at
Tehsil Headquarter Hospital (THQ) Sadda, after facing regular trial
has been convicted and sentenced by learned Additional Sessions
Judge Sadda Kurram (“Trial Court”) vide judgment dated
11.03.2022 (“impugned judgment”) as under:-

Under Section 302 _(b)_ PPC:- To undergo
imprisonment for life as Ta’azir and to pay rupees
five lacs as compensation to legal heirs of the
deceased in terms of section 544-A Cr.P.C. and in
default of payment thereof to further undergo six

Under section 324 PPC:-To undergo rigorous

imprisonment for ten years and to pay rupees one lac
2

as fine and in default of payment thereof to further
undergo six months simple imprisonment.
Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C. has been

extended to him.

2. The prosecution’s case as per First Information Report
(“FIR”) is that on receipt of information through one Khyal
Muhammad Hawaldar Levy Force (PW.2), about committing murder
of one person and causing injury to another by appellant Sahar Gul in
THQ hospital Sadda and that he has been arrested by the hospital’s
administration along with the crime dagger, on 25.11.2018 Abdullah
Political Moharrir Saddar (PW.1), along with other officials of the
Levy Force reached the hospital, where he arrested the appellant. In
the hospital the Political Moharrir came to know that Mst. Shakila
wife of the appellant being annoyed was living in her parent’s house;
that she being pregnant on the fateful day was brought to the hospital
by her mother Mst. Malala, grandfather, namely, Khaista Jan deceased
and brother, namely, Muhammad and on medical examination when
the doctor told that a child in the womb of Mst. Shakila has expired
and the same shall be removed through surgery, the appellant present
in the hospital got infuriated and gave dagger blow to Khaista Jan
deceased and Muhammad, as a result, both got injured, however, the
former then succumbed to injury. On the aforesaid report, FIR dated
25.11.2018 under sections 302/324 PPC was registered against the
appellant in Police Station Lower Kurram.

3. Investigation in the case was conducted by Political Tehsil
Lower Kurram, who recorded statements of Mst. Jannat Bibi,

Mst. Shula (hospital made wife), Mst. Haleema Charge Nurse, THQ
3

Sadda, Mst. Shakila and Muhammad. After completion of
investigation challan was submitted against the appellant before the
learned trial Court, where he was formally charge sheeted to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To prove its case, the prosecution
examined as many as seven witnesses. After closure of the
prosecution’s evidence, statement of the appellant was recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein he denied the prosecution’s allegation
and professed his innocence. He, however, neither wished to be
examined on oath under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor opted to produce
evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial, the learned trial court,
after hearing both the sides, convicted and sentenced the appellant as
mentioned in the initial paragraph of the judgment, hence, this appeal.

4. | We have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties
and perused the record and evidence with their able assistance.

5. As per FIR, occurrence in this case has taken place on
25.11.2018 in Tehsil Headquarter (THQ) Hospital Sadda, the
erstwhile Kurram Agency (now District Kurram). Though
Investigating Officer has neither prepared site plan of the crime spot
nor has taken into possession any blood or bloodstained garments of
the deceased through recovery memo nor placed on file medico legal
report of injured Muhammad (PW.5) and postmortem report of the
deceased, if any, however, such flaws on the part of the Investigating
Agency is obvious for the reason that after few months of the
occurrence, FATA Interim Governance Regulation, 2018, was
promulgated on 29" May, 2018, with an aim to provide for an interim

system of administration of justice, maintenance of peace and good
4

governance in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and repeal of
the Frontier Crimes Regulation, 1901 and matters connected therewith
and ancillary thereto till the merger of the Federally Administered
Tribal Areas (“FATA”) with the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
On expiration of life of the Regulation (ibid), Constitution (Twenty-
fifth Amendment) Act, 2018, was brought by the government,
whereby FATAs/PATAs were merged with the Province of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, therefore, the Political Moharrir being not acquainted
with the relevant provisions of the Cr.P.C. governing the
investigation, has probably dealt with the investigation in the manner
as provided in the FCR. However, as the trial in the case has been
conducted in accordance with law and proper opportunity of
producing evidence and hearing has been provided to both the parties,
therefore, flaws in the investigation would not have any adverse
bearing on the prosecution’s case. It would also not be out of context
to mention here that eyewitnesses of the case being the inhabitants of
the erstwhile Kurram Agency and not acquainted and aware of the
legal complications of the newly promulgated system and the law
made applicable to the FATA, therefore, one cannot expect from the
PWS the standard of evidence to be expected from the witnesses and
the prosecution of the settled area, Admittedly, after promulgation of
the FATA/PATAs into settled area, the entire law and system for the
people of the erstwhile FATAs/PATAs and the prosecution was new,
therefore, it would be more appropriate to reappraises the

prosecution’s evidence with a lenient yardstick.
6. Ocular account of occurrence has been furnished by injured
Muhammad (PWS), who is the brother-in-law (sister’s husband) of the
appellant, Mst. Shakila Bibi (PW6), who is the wife of the appellant
and an independent and impartial witness, namely, Haleema Charge
Nurse THQ hospital Sadda (PW.7). Besides their testimony, the
appellant was arrested red handed at the spot along with crime dagger
by the hospital Administration and was handed over to Abdullah
Political Moharrir Sadda (PW.1). In this regard the testimony of
Khyal Muhammad Hawaldar Levy Force posted in THQ hospital
Sadda is of worth perusal. He has deposed that on 25.11.2018 he was
on duty at DHQ hospital Sadda where the occurrence took place; that
the appellant was arrested along with dagger by the hospital
administration and he informed Political Moharrir Sadda about the
occurrence who along with other levy officials reached the hospital
and arrested the appellant along with crime dagger. The testimony of
Abdullah Political Moharrir Sadda (PW.1) fully corroborates the
testimony of Khyal Muhammad Hawaldar. He deposed that on
information of Khyal Muhammad Hawaldar about the occurrence he
rushed to THQ hospital Sadda along with officials of Levy Force and
arrested the appellant along with the crime dagger and learnt that he
has committed murder of Khaista Jan deceased and caused injury to
Mohammad.

7. The injured PW Muhammad while appearing in the witness box
deposed that his sister Mst. Shakila was marred to the appellant but
due to harsh and cruel behaviour, she while abandoning her husband’s

house was living in her parents’ house and by then she was also
pregnant; that on the fateful day they took Mst. Shakila to THQ
hospital Saddar for checkup and telephonically informed the appellant
to come to the said hospital; that on examination of Mst. Shakila when
doctor told that child in her womb has expired, the appellant got
infuriated and gave dagger blow to him and Khaista Jan, as a result,
they both got injured, however, Khaista Jan succumbed to injures. In
cross-examination he stated that he received injury on his chest and
hand, however, his wounds were only stitched and he was not
hospitalized.

8. Mst. Shakila wife of the appellant while appearing in the
witness box as PW.6 has fully corroborated the testimony of
eyewitness Muhammad. She while narrating the entire episode
deposed that after her examination when she was told that child in her
womb has expired, the appellant got infuriated and gave dagger blow
to her brother Muhammad and grandfather Khaista Jan deceased as a
result both got injured, however, the latter then succumbed to injury.
9.  Haleema Charge Nurse, THQ hospital Sadda is an independent
and impartial witness being not related to any party. She while
appearing as PW.7 in the witness box deposed that during the days of
occurrence she was posted at THQ hospital Sadda as Charge Nurse;
that on the fateful day Mst. Shakila was brought to the said hospital
and she was complaining of PV bleeding; that in the meantime the
appellant arrived at the hospital and threatened the hospital staff not to
treat his wife; that in the meanwhile, there was a scuffle between the
appellant and another person and later on she learnt that few persons

were got injured in the scuffle. The testimony of Haleema Charge
Nurse fully proves the occurrence to have taken place inside THQ
hospital. Her testimony also proves presence of the appellant at the
crime spot. However, one thing can be inferred from her statement
that there was scuffle between the parties.

10. On reappraisal of the prosecution’s evidence we are firm in our
view to hold that prosecution has proved its case against the appellant
through cogent and confidence inspiring direct evidence.
Eyewitnesses Mst. Shakila is the wife of the appellant while
Muhammad is his brother-in-law. It does not appeal to a prudent mind
that such close relatives will charge an innocent person. No doubt, no
medico legal report of injured PW Muhammad is available on file and
there is also no autopsy report of the deceased, however, an OPD chit
furnished by THQ hospital Sadda is available on file which shows that
Khaista Jan deceived had received a single stab wound of 3cm on
upper thigh which is a non-vital part. Mere fact that postmortem
report of the deceased has not been conducted would not damage the
prosecution’s case. In this regard we would refer to the judgment of

the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled, “Abdur Rehman vs the

State” _(1998 SCMR_ 1778), relevant part of which is reproduced

below:-
“Now adverting to crucial point involved in the
present case, it may be seen that when factum of
Qatl-e-Khata or (Qatl-e-Amd has been
independently established through strong and
convincing evidence, mere fact that dead body

was not discovered or postmortem was not
conducted has altogether no material effect or
legal consequence.”

Identical controversy has been dealt with by this court in case of
provincially Administered Tribal area titled, “Rahim Ullah Vs the
State” (NLR 1985 page 41 Peshawar) by observing that:-

“Absence of postmortem examination and
inquest report regarding injuries sustained by the
deceased would not be fatal for the prosecution’s
case.”

Similar is the view of this court in case titled, “Zard Ullah Khan vs

the State” (1998 MLD 855) wherein it has been held that a guilty

person cannot escape from conviction merely for absence of
postmortem report which always form a corroborative piece of

evidence of the ocular testimony. Even otherwise, in case titled,

“Aqil Vs the State” (2023 SCMR 831), it has been held by the

Hon’ble Supreme Court that:-
“Tt is settled principle of law that the value and status
of medical evidence and recovery is always
corroborative in its nature which alone is not
sufficient to sustain conviction. Minor discrepancies
and conflicts appearing in medical evidence and the
ocular version are quite possible for variety of
reasons. ...where ocular evidence is found
trustworthy and confidence inspiring , the same is
given preference over medical evidence and the same
alone is sufficient to sustain conviction of an accused.

11. Admittedly, the occurrence has taken place at the spur of

moment without premeditation and the deceased has sustained only
Net

single stab wound that too on non-vital part of his body. The appellant
has not repeated the act of giving further dagger blows to the deceased
despite the fact that he was at his mercy. Identical situation came up
before the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled, “Muhammad Salim

Vs Muhammad Aslam and others” (1983 SCMR 53). Relevant part
of the judgment is reproduced below:-

“Only one injury proved fatal and that too was caused not on
any vital part of the body but on the knee which resulted in
the severance of the femoral artery and the consequent loss
of blood which led to his death. The learned counsel for the
appellant contended that clause 3rdly of section 300 PPC
applied to the case as the injury in the ordinary course of
nature was sufficient to cause his death. It is true that this is
the opinion of the doctor but nonetheless from the physical
facts and the other inferential conclusions drawn by us, the
incident was not premeditated but to be a sudden after which
involved a grappling and the injury thus being caused on the
knee in the heat of the moment which by itself could not
saddle him with the knowledge of the precise local of
different arteries and veins in the limbs of human body so as
to lead only to the inferential conclusion to kill him.
Therefore, it is a case of lesser culpability and all that they
could have presumed to have intended was to cause grievous
hurt with a dangerous weapon. This presumption is further
augmented by the presence of the other incised injury not on
any vital part of the body and that too being simple in
nature. The element of intention, therefore, being absent, we
would hold that the offence committed was one under
section 304 Part-II, PPC.”
In view of the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case coupled

with single dagger blow on the person of the deceased that too on his
non-vital part ie. thigh, case of the appellant falls within the
Exception (4) of the previous section 300 PPC, which by that time,

was punishable under section 304 PPC. For the sake of convenience
10

and ready reference Exception 4 of the then section 300 PPC is
reproduced below:-

“Exception 4:-Culpable homicide is not murder
if it is committed without premeditation in a
sudden fight in the heat of passion upon sudden
quarrel and without the offender’s having taken
undue advantage or acted in cruel or unusual
manner.”

12. No doubt, neither old section 300 nor exceptions thereto are
available at present on the Statue book, however, it is laid down by
the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled, “The State Vs Muhammad

Hanif and 05 others” (1992 SCMR 2047), that all the matters which

were initially dealt with by erstwhile section 304 PPC, are now to be

considered under section 302 (c ) PPC. The same view has been
repeatedly upheld by the august apex court in a number of cases. In

case titled, “Muhammad Ajmal Vs the State” (2022 SCMR 88), in

an occurrence of sudden flare up, the Hon’ble Supreme court has
observed the following:-

“The above mentioned evidence of both the witnesses
clearly indicate that the deceased went to the workshop
of appellant for repair of tractor, for the first time and in
the absence of any previous ill will or grudge, at the
spur of the moment due to “lain dain” probably
regarding the payment of work done, by the appellant
by repairing the tractor, suddenly there was altercation,
followed by exchange of abusive language between the
appellant and deceased, all of a sudden this occurrence
took place indicating that there was no premeditation
and at the spur of the moment due to abusive language,
in the heat passion, appellant gave a solitary blow with
the hatched which was lying there. He did not repeat
the blow although deceased was lying on his mercy. He

did not take undue advantage nor acted in a cruel or
11

unusual manner. So all the ingredients of the above

exception are born out from the prosecution case and

his_case_falls_under_ section 302(c) PPC. All the

arameters mentioned above clearly indicate that it

is a case falling under section 302(c ) PPC and _ not
section 302 (b) PPC.
13. Placing reliance on the judgment (supra) of the Hon’ble

Supreme Court, we convert the conviction of the appellant from
section 302(b) PPC to section 302 (c) PPC and reduce his sentence
from life imprisonment to rigorous imprisonment for twelve years
rigorous imprisonment. Conviction of the appellant under section 324
PPC is maintained, however, period of his sentence is reduced from
10 years to 05 years rigorous imprisonment. The sentence of fine
under section 324 PPC and period in default of payment therefore and
the compensation under section 544-A Cr.P.C. shall remain intact.
Both the substantive sentences under sections 302(c ) and 324 PPC
shall run concurrently. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. shall remain
intact in favour of the appellant.

14. With the above modification in the conviction and sentences of

the appellant, this appeal stands dismissed.
