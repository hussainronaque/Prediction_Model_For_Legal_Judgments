2. It refers to a doomful incident that
occurred at an unknown time on 06.8.2013 ata
oe place river Swat near Odigram, which is at a

jer =
oe distance 4/5 KMs towards West of the Police
Station Rahim Abad District Swat. The maker

of this report is Sher Afzal who is uncle of the

rahim Khan

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice M
Hon'ble Mr. Justice I

minor lad by the name of Fayaz aged about 7/8
years whose autopsy was conducted and after
being assured that death of the deceased was
not natural as the  accused/Appellant
Rehman Gul is said to have killed him and
thrown his body in river Swat. No motive was
set as by the time it was not known as the
occurrence being unseen.
3. By setting the charge, the learned trial
Court has given three (3) heads, under the first
head the accused Rehman Gul is said to have
pushed one Fayaz son of Akbar Ali resident of
Odigram into river Swat and killed him at the
instance of co-accused/Appellant Asghar Ali
alias Ghamay on 06.08.2013 at an unknown
time, thereby committed the offence under
sections 302,109 PPC. Under the second head
on 05.08.2013 at ‘Sham wela’ (~Ls a4) co-
accused/Appellant Asghar Ali alias Ghamay
a? paid Rs. 20,000/- to co-accused/Appellant
Rehman Gul to kill minor lad Fayaz and the
latter acted upon by throwing him in the water

in river Swat, thus, the co-accused/Appellant

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Asghar Khan alias Ghamay has committed the
offence of abetment and instigation for causing
murder of the minor Fayaz, the offence
committed within the meaning of section 302
t/w 109 PPC. The third head speaks off that
when at the time Rehman Gul the co-
accused/Appellant was pushing the minor
Fayaz in the river Swat to kill him the instigator
Asghar Khan abettor of the offence was himself
present at the time of occurrence and thereby
committed the offence of Qatl-i-amd
punishable under section 302 read with section
114 PPC.

4. When these accused/Appellants did
not plead their guilt, prosecution examined
mother of the deceased by the name of Mst.
Masia Bibi as PW-1, Nadar Khan as PW-2,
Sher Afzal lodger of the First Information
Report and uncle of the minor lad Fayaz as
PW-3, minor sister of the deceased Fayaz
Sumera star witness of the prosecution as PW-
4, the alleged shopkeeper Usman Ali as PW-5,

Akbar Khan as PW-6, Usman Ali as PW-7,

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hanif Khan SHO as PW-8, Nameer Gul IHC
No. 417 as PW-9, Naeemullah Constable No.
881 as PW-10, Sultan Mehmood SI as PW-11,
Fazal Rahim as PW-12,Abdul Bari Shahzad as
PW-13, Dr. Nasrullah Khan as PW-14, the
Judicial Magistrate concerned Syed
Shaukatullah Shah as PW-15 and under the
joint statement of learned counsel for the
complainant and learned A.P.P evidence of the
prosecution was concluded

5. After closure of the prosecution
evidence, the accused/Appellants were
examined under section 342 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, describing themselves as
scapegoats, they denied the charges, posed
innocence and stated to have falsely been
implicated in the case. They, however wished
to produce no defence, nor to examine
themselves on oath as required under section

340(2), Cr.P.C.

‘Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
6. After delivery of the detailed reasons
in the impugned judgment, appropriate
sentences thought for have been recorded,
which are now impugned through these
connected criminal appeals.

7. Having heard arguments at length of
learned counsel for the accused/Appellants,
learned counsel for the complainant and
learned A.A.G. for the State, record delved
deep into with their able assistance.

8. The disclosure of facts leading
involvement of the accused/Appellant
Rehman Gul is on account of clue of last seen
evidence given by Sumera daughter of late
Akbar Ali aged about 8 years. This minor girl
has been examined as PW-4 who is the real
sister of the deceased Fayaz, under the Court

observation was held competent to reply the

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
questions, thus, on her examination, she has
narrated that on the fateful day her brother
Fayaz alongwith her, both of them were
standing in front of their house, in the
meanwhile, accused/Appellant Rehman Gul
came there and asked her brother to take him
to his uncle Sher Afzal who was working in
Agriculture field. When the minor Fayaz did
not return till late at night, extensive search
was carried out by family members including
mother, uncle and other relatives, then the
minor Sumera disclosed that
accused/Appellant Rehman Gul had taken her
brother on the pretext as referred to. Later, her
brother was murdered by throwing him in the
river. She has been cross-examined at length,
who has admitted that accused/Appellant

Rehman Gul was never known to her

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
previously and likely accused/Appellant
Asghar Khan was also not known to her as she
has never seen them before. It was further
disclosed by another person by the name of
Usman Ali examined as PW-5 that he while
sitting in his shop on 06.08.2013 situated in his
village Odigram, Rehman Gul
accused/Appellant accompanied by _ the
deceased Fayaz came to his shop where
Rehman Gul paid him Rs. 10 for purchase of
peanuts, later both of them left his shop.
Accused/Appellant Rehman Gul is known to
him as his sister’s house is situated near his
house and he often acclimated visit to his
sister’s house. Under the information given
through lodger of the First Information Report
and being named therein the

accused/Appellant Rehman Gul was arrested

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan.
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
on 10.08.2013 at 11:45 hours while standing in
General Bus Stand. His custody was obtained
and while confessing his guilt before the
Judicial Magistrate PW-15 Syed Shaukatullah
Shah, he disclosed that he had thrown the
minor lad Fayaz in Swat river, while co-
accused/Appellant Asghar Khan alias Ghamay
accompanied him for the act of commission of
Qatl-i-amd being committed at the instance of
Asghar Khan. The accused/Appellant Rehman
Gul was working with him on daily wages @
Rs. 250/- per day and he used to stay with him
for the night as the co-accused/Appellant
Asghar Khan told him that he has relations
developed with mother of the minor lad Fayaz,
thereby in order to get her hands this young lad
ought to have been killed for which an offer

was made of Rs. 20,000/- and on receiving this

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
gal
_

10

amount it was co-accused/Appellant Asghar
Khan who brought the minor and then he
pushed him into ravine, after doing so he
decamped from the place situated nearby Swat
river and after 4 days of the occurrence the co-
accused/Appellant Asghar Khan disclosed that
the name of child is Fayaz who is fatherless.
Thus, the police in view of this confessional
statement arrested the co-accused/Appellant
Asghar Khan 11.08.2013.

9. Where statement of minor sister of
the deceased by the name of Sumera PW-4
coupled with the statement of PW-5 Usman
Ali for the purpose of last seen evidence would
absolutely negate the confessional statement
given by the accused/Appellant Rehman Gul
before the Judicial Magistrate as he had never

been to the shop of PW-5 Usman Ali for

‘Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
purchase of peanuts of Rs. 10 and he never
took minor lad Fayaz under the pretext to meet
him with his uncle Sher Afzal who was
working in the agriculture field. The other way
around the confessional statement annihilate
the last seen evidence as betoken by the sister
of deceased and the shopkeeper examined as
PW-4 and PW-5 one after another. This
confessional statement has been believed by
the learned trial Court and on its basis the
evidence has been carried out and the extreme
penalty of death to both the
accused/Appellants has been awarded;
therefore, the role of each accused/Appellant is
to be appreciated, if any, in the light of
evidence so adduced by the prosecution. The
last seen evidence is nevertheless enough to

sustain conviction on murder charges where

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
the witnesses have some connection with the
deceased their independent corroboration is
required to rely upon it. The last seen evidence
is always considered weak type of
circumstantial evidence and it cannot be made
basis for conviction of murder charge, there is
need of strong corroboration and other pieces
of evidence. In context of the present case
except the minor sister of the deceased and
shopkeeper Usman Ali PW-5 statements
would utterly fly in the face of the version of
prosecution in view of the confessional

statement if taken in juxta position. Reliance is

placed on PLJ_ 2015 Cr.C. (Lahore) 207

if

‘Mazhar Hussain vs the State”, wherein the
relevant citation speaks off:-

"Last seen evidence is a
week type of evidence unless
corroborated with some other

piece of evidence which is

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan.
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
13

conspicuously missing in
instant case. Last seen
evidence can be procured at
any time during investigation
if direct evidence is not

available to prosecution.

Similar view has also been affirmed

in case law cited as 20/3 YLR 1364 (Lahore)

“Zafar Iqbal _vs_the State’. The relevant

citation enunciates:-

"Prosecution case was

based = on circumstantial
evidence. Last seen evidence
which was a week type of
circumstantial evidence could
not be made basis for
conviction on murder charge
when the was related to the
deceased and his testimony
was not corroborated by any

other evidence.

pate Last seen evidence is
not enough to sustain conviction
on murder charge when the
witness has some connection
with the deceased and
independent corroboration is

required to rely upon it.

10. The learned Trial Court has mainly
given credence to the confessional statement of
the accused/Appellant Rehman Gul in order to
hold truthfulness and its veracity, the
prosecution examined the Judicial Magistrate
Syed Shaukatullah Shah, PW-15, who
recorded confessional statement on 12.08.2013
at 01:00 P.M. Accused/appellant Rehman Gul
was produced before him by the Investigation
Officer and it was believed that the
accused/Appellant Rehman Gul offered
himself to disclose the real facts leading to the
commission of Qatl-i-amd of the minor lad
Fayaz, therefore, after questionnaire setting up
as many as 11 questions were asked and
replied, statement was reduced under section
164 Cr.P.C. read with 364 Cr.P.C. This

witness who is a Judicial Officer has

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim.
15

categorically admitted in his  cross-

examination:-

Where confessional statement has
nexus to be believed and on its basis
conviction is to be followed, such confessional
statement ought to have been corroborated
with other evidence. Where judicial confession
before the Magistrate is at the stage of
recording of the statement of the said accused

making confession recorded under section 342

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Cr.P.C or even prior to is retracted particularly
when such retracted confession is leading to
conviction it renders it altogether inadmissible
in evidence and is liable to be set aside.
Wisdom in this behalf is supported by the
judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of
Pakistan cited as 2017 SCMR__ 898
“Muhammad Ismail and others vs the State”.
The relevant citation (b) reads:-

Reappraisal of evidence.
Judicial confession before
Magistrate, retraction — of---
Effect. Judicial confession
allegedly made by accused-
persons/appellants before a
Magistrate under S. 164, Cr.P.C
had been retracted before the
Trial Court and in the absence of
any independent corroboration
such retracted judicial confession
could not suffice all by itself for
poe recording or upholding the
: accused persons' conviction.
Convictions and death sentences
awarded to accused persons
were set aside in circumstances

and they were acquitted of the

‘Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
charge of murder. Appeal was

allowed accordingly.

In the case in hand, in view of the
admissions as referred by the learned Judicial
Magistrate the course of its admissibility
which is ought to be declared as volunteer, but
this possibility is ruled out in view of the
dictum laid down in PLD 1971 Lahore 850 “
Ghulam Muhammad ys _ the State”, wherein
the relevant citation opines:-

"All that the Magistrate told
the accused was that he should
sit down and think over the
matter and then make a
statement according to his own
free will. This warning was not
sufficient to bring to the mind of
the confessor the serious results
that had to follow the
confession. The warning is to be

re = administered in the language
used in subsection (3) of section
164, Cr.P.C and where it is
administered in a casual way the
Courts have refused to rely on
such a confession. The

Magistrate even did not explain

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
to the accused before time was
allowed for consideration that
he was not bound to make a
confession and if he made one,
it will be used against him. The
warning administered by the
Magistrate in this case does not
confirm to the one prescribed by
the Statute and this failure is
enough to vitiate the confession
apart from other circumstances

which make it unacceptable."

Where the Magistrate was duty
bound to have asked the questionnaire and to
have let known the accused that the confession
being made would use against him and that the
said Magistrate is to appear against him as
prosecution witness to confirm all the
possibilities for making it to believe the
statement recorded before him as to convince
the Court liable it for conviction of the
accused. Warning has not been administered
while recording this confession of the

accused/Appellant Rehman Gul, thereby, it

‘Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
was requirement under the prescribed Statute
and its failure is sufficient to  vitiate
confession. Apart from built-up, narration by
the Investigation Officer put in the mouth of
the accused/Appellant Rehman Gul to mere
state words for his implication thereby the
confession is hardly believable to be
volunteered statement before the said learned
Judicial Magistrate.

11. There is always a motive which is set
in the First Information Report where the
crime of murder takes place there are reasons
to believe that such heinous crime is always
committed where motive remained proved. In
this case, the co-accused Asghar Khan alias
Ghamay wished to marry mother of the
deceased and as this minor lad was all

the time attached with his mother, while

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Mst. Masia Bibi mother of the deceased was
working as Sweeper in private school, the
accused/Appellant Asghar Khan did not get a
chance to convey his feelings for offering her
hands despite of the fact that Masia Bibi,
mother of the deceased had grown up children
and that too when she stepped in the witness-
box as PW-1, she has categorically denied that
ever has met with the accused/Appellant

Asghar Khan, she states:

Thus, in the given circumstances
when the motive is not set as to why the
accused/Appellant Asghar Khan will pay an
amount of Rs. 20,000/- when he has never
wished to marry Mst. Masia Bibi mother of the
deceased and paid an amount of Rs. 20,000/-
to the co-accused/Appellant Rehman Gul and
this fact has also been admitted by the PW-3

Sher Afzal in the following manner:-

20.0000 S Kuler we Hisieg

Thereby, by the statement of PW-1
Mst. Masia Bibi compelled with the statement
of PW-3 Sher Afzal the purpose set as motive
to kill the minor by the co-accused/Appellant
Asghar Khan through accused/Appellant

Rehman Gul remained unproved.

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
22

12. The medical evidence furnished by
PW-14 Dr. Nasrullah Khan is also not in line
with the version of prosecution, as the medical
report is completely silent with regard to cause
of death and even this fact has been plainly
admitted by the Medical Officer concerned
when cross-examined by the defence that in
his report the cause of death has not been
given. The medical evidence put-forward by
the Medical Officer and the statement of
mother of the deceased Mst. Masia Bibi PW-1,
if are placed in juxta position, she clearly
admitted in her cross-examination that during
the days of occurrence it was hot season and
the kids often go to the river for taking bath
coupled with the fact that when the cause of
death is shrouded with mystery in view of

medico-legal report, the deceased child might

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
po
e—

have been drowned while swimming in the
river.

13. Last but not the least it could be the
preliminary objection but neither been taken
by the learned Trial Court nevertheless the
learned defence counsel, nor even the learned
counsel for the complainant and learned
A.A.G. appearing on behalf of the State have
ever pointed out that previously the charge has
not been framed under section 34 of the
Pakistan Penal Code as obviously when the
accused/Appellants were tried for the offences
under sections 302 read with 109 and 114
PPC, the accused/Appellants under the
asservations shared their common intention.
Thus, the charge being framed without such
allegations would also bring a serious blow to

the prosecution as it could amount to not

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
por

24

sharing common intention by both the
accused/Appellants in committing Qatl-i-amd
of the deceased Fayaz by throwing him in the
river Swat.

14. In such like scenario, it is hard to
believe the prosecution version as it seems to
have been developed by the police inviting
troubles for both the accused/Appellants
Rehman Gul and Asghar Khan alias Ghamay.
This lead to serious implication of creating
doubt. It has been enshrined in Islamic
Jurisprudence some 1400 years ago that it
would be better to acquit 100 culprits than to
convict one innocent soul. Even otherwise,
conviction must be based on unimpeachable
evidence and certainty of guilt and any doubt
arising in the prosecution case must be

resolved in favour of the accused. Reliance in

‘Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
25

this regard is placed on the case law cited as

"Muhammad Khan and another vs. The State

1999 SCMR 1220". It has now been settled that
for giving benefit of doubt to an accused, there
need not be number of circumstances to prove
the innocence of accused; even single
circumstance creating reasonable doubt is
sufficient for the acquittal of an accused.
Reliance in this regard is placed on the case

law cited as Muhammad Khan and another

vs. The State, 1999 SCMR 1220.

15. In view of the above discussion and
scrutiny of evidence from all angles, we are of
the firm view that the prosecution has failed to
prove the guilt of the accused/Appellants
through cogent and unimpeachable evidence.
The basic principle of Sharia/Law is that
conviction must be based on evidence beyond
any shadow of doubt because the damage

resulting from erroneous sentence is

‘Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
irreversible, ergo, while extending the benefit
of doubt to the accused/Appellants, we accept
both these connected appeals by setting aside
the conviction and sentences recorded through
the impugned judgment dated 20.05.2015 by
the learned Trial Court and acquit them of the
charges levelled against them. They be set free

forthwith, if not required in any other case.

16. Similarly, Murder References
No. 4-M & 4-A of 2015 are answered in

negative.

17. These are the detailed reasons for our

short orders of even date.
