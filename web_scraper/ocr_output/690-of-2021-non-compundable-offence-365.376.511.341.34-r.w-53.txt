KAMRAN HAYAT MIANKHEL, J.-. This petition
has been moved on behalf of petitioner Adnan
alias Nomi son of Ismaeel for admitting him to bail
till final conclusion of trial in case FIR No. 494
dated 06.06.2022 registered under sections 365/
376/511/341/34 PPC read with sections 53 of
Child Protection Act at Police Station City District
Mansehra.

2. As per contents of FIR, the allegation
against the petitioner is that he and co-accused
committed rape with the complainant.

3. At the very outset, learned counsel for the
petitioner stated at the bar that the matter has
been patched up with the complainant. The
complainant present in the court stated at the bar
that she has got no objection on acceptance of
the bail petition. In this respect her statement was

recorded and placed on file. Though the offence
with which the petitioner has been charged is not
compoundable. However, the parties have
themselves entered into compromise outside the
court.

4. Offences under sections 365/376 PPC do
not find mention in the table of section 345 (1)
Cr.P.C, therefore, the same are not
compoundable. Judicial notice of compromise
was always taken by the court, though otherwise
not compoundable. The august Supreme Court of
Pakistan while taking judicial notice of
compromise in non-compoundable â€” offence,
converted the criminal petition into leave to
appeal and accepted the same by reducing the
sentence to the one, he had already undergone.
In this context reliance can be placed on the case
reported as Ghulam Ali Vs The state (1997
SCMR 1411).

5. If the complainant is no longer willing to
prosecute the accused, then it is not for the courts
to compel her to do so, as one can take the horse
to pond for drinking water but he cannot compel
him to drink the water. In a similar case reported
as Muhammad Akbar Vs The State 1997 MLD
3096, the factum of compromise was taken into
consideration while granting bail in offences of

Sections 10 & 11 (Enforcement of Hudood)
Ordinance, 1979 read with section 377 PPC.
Likewise, in the case reported as Niaz
Muhammad Vs The State 1987 MLD 1780,
compromise was taken into consideration and bail
was granted to the petitioner. In the case reported
as Mussarat Elahi Alias Bibi Vs the State (1997
P.Cr.L.J 1193), the same view was followed.
Besides, co-accused namely Ghullamullah
Qureshi and Abdul Saboor have already been
released on bail by this court vide order dated
02.09.2022, therefore, rule of consistency is also
applicable to case of present petitioner.

6. Thus, | am fortified in my opinion that
judicial notice of compromise having been taken
place in the cases, even in non-compoundable
offences, therefore, without going deep into the
merits of the case, on the ground of compromise,
besides, case being one of further inquiry into the
guilt of the petitioner, this petition is accepted and
the petitioner is admitted to bail on furnishing bail
bonds in the sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (two lac) with
two sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate. The
sureties must be locale, reliable and men of
sufficient means.
