JUDGMENT

AHMAD ALL J. Through the instant appeal, the

appellant, Farman Ali s/o Wazir Gul, has
impugned the judgment of learned Additional
Sessions Judge/Judge Model Criminal Trial
Court, Mardan, dated 20.08.2019, whereby he
was convicted and sentenced to life
imprisonment and burdened with payment of
Rs.200,000/- as compensation to LRs of the
deceased u/s 544-A Cr.P.C or in default whereof
to suffer 06 months SI, in case FIR No.513 dated
02.12.2015 u/s 302/34 PPC, Police Station
Choora Mardan, Peshawar.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on the day of
occurrence i.e. 02.12.2015, at about 08:10 hrs,
Munir Khan ASI, on receipt of information of

incident, reached at the spot, where
complainant/Sani Gul reported the matter to him
in terms that he alongwith other inmates was
present in his house, when he heard some hue and
cry upon which he came out of his house and saw
that his brother Farman Ali (present accused-
appellant), acquitted co-accused (Inam) and
absconding co-accused (Muhammad Ali) were
quarreling with his other brother Zahid Khan and
during such fray the acquitted and absconding co-
accused pushed the deceased Zahid Khan inside
the house of present accused-appellant, who fired
at him with his pistol with the intention to kill
him, resultantly, he got hit and died on the spot.
The co-accused made their escape good from the
spot while present appellant with weapon was
overpowered and was handed over to the above
mentioned Munir Khan, ASI. Motive was
narrated to be dispute over women folk.
Consequently, FIR ibid was registered.

2. On completion of investigation, challan
was submitted in Court where the accused-
appellant was charge-sheeted to which he pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution in
order to prove its case, produced and examined as
many as twelve witnesses whereafter statement of

the accused was recorded, wherein, he professed
his innocence. The learned Trial Court, after
conclusion of trial, found the appellant guilty of
the charge and, while recording his conviction,
sentenced him as mentioned above. Feeling
aggrieved, the appellant has filed the instant

appeal before this Court.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for the
appellant and learned AAG (relied upon by the
complainant) heard and record gone through with
their able assistance.

4. There is hardly any occasion to believe
that prosecution has established its case against
the present appellant. Perusal of the FIR reveals
that IO of the case was already proceeded
towards the spot of occurrence in connection
with Mad No.7 dated 02.12.2015 which was,
admittedly, lodged by the present accused
appellant prior to the present occurrence. It is
further apparent from the record that the present
appellant was already sent to hospital for
treatment being in injured condition alongwith
constable No.690, namely, Kashif of Police Post
Manga. In this regard MLC is also available on
file. In the circumstances, it is not appealable to

a prudent mind that when the appellant was sent
to the hospital then how he was arrested on the
spot alongwith weapon of offence (pistol).

5. So far as arrest and recovery of pistol
from the appellant are concerned, statement of
PW-6 (Munir Khan ASI) is worth perusal. The
relevant portions of his statement is reproduced
below for ready reference:-

PW-6

“T arrested the accused and prepared card
of arrest of accused Farman which is
Ex.PW6/1. I also prepared recovery
memo Ex.PW6/2 with respect of recovery
of pistol from accused facing trial
Farman Ali in presence of marginal

* ”
witness .

However, when PW-5/Sartaj FC#3463 appeared
before the Curt, he has totally negated the story
of PW-6 by deposing in his cross examination in
the following manner:-

PW-5

“The pistol was produced to the IO. By
the complainant in the PS at about
5:00/5:30 pm. Firstly, I had taken the
injury sheet to the hospital. I had left the
PS for hospital at 9:30 am. I reached to
the hospital with 15 to 20 minutes. I do
not remember the time for which I had
remained in the hospital. The pistol was
of black colour. At the time of production
of pistol to the IO only me and Asad Ali
constable were present. The IO sealed the
pistol into parcel produced to him by the

complainant who affixed the sealed upon
it. My statement was recorded by the IO
u/s 161 Cr.P.C I do not remember that
whether I stated in my statement u/s 1621
Cr.P.C that the pistol was sealed into
parcel or not. It is wrong to suggest that
nothing was produced in my presence to
the IO and I have falsely deposed in the

Court today”.

6. Be that as it my, suffice it to say that no
witness to the recovery memo was examined by
the prosecution as PW during the trial. Likewise,
the witness mentioned in the FIR, namely,
Abdullah, was also abandoned by the
prosecution. In the situation, adverse inference
under Article 129(g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order
1984 can be safely drawn.

7. Moreover, the most important witness i.e.
complainant/PW-11, also did not offer anything
in respect of arrest of the accused-appellant and
recovery of weapon at the spot. For ready
reference, the relevant portion of his statement is
reproduced below:-

PW-11

“On the day of occurrence at 7:30 am I was
inside my house when I heard noise, when
I came out I saw the accused facing trail
and the absconding accused, they pushed
the deceased inside their house and
accused Farman Ali started firing upon
him with which Zahid got hit and expired

there and then two of the accused
Muhammad Ali and Inam ran away from
the spot while we caught Farman Ali. We
shifted the dead body to the mortuary. I
made the report at the spot at about 8:10
am. Motive for the occurrence was women
dispute. After making the report the was
read over to me and I thumb impressed it
while on e Abdullah also thumb impressed
my report as a token of its correctness. The
IO also prepared site plan at my instance.
My report written in shape of murasila
which is Ex.PA/1. I charge the accused for
the commission of offence.

This witness himself disputed and contradicted
his own statement by deposing in his cross
examination that;

“the report was made in the hujra of
Sohrab.........000 I had not gone with
the deceased o the hospital while Ajab,
Muslim, Srtaj had gone with the dad
body to the hospital.......... Blood had
not oozed out from the body of the
deceased and my hand and clothes
were not smeared With it......... it is
correct that the site plan, recovery
memos etc were prepared in the hujra

of Sohrab”

8. PW-4(Illaqa Nazim) is an independent
witness in the episode. He appeared before the
Court and deposed as under:-

PW-4

XX...“ am Nazim of the Union
Council concerned. I was present in my
house early in morning on hue and cry

I attracted to the house of complainant

Sani Gul when I reached, the dead body
was lying in the house of complainant
Sani Gul, where women folk around the
dead body were present along with
other neighbours. I along with co-
villagers boarded the dead body in a
Suzuki pick up and escorted to the PP
Manga. Then we proceeded to DHQ
Hospital Mardan.”

His, above deposition, totally negates the stance
of complainant/Sani Gul taken in the FIR that
“during quarrel the acquitted and absconding
co-accused pushed the deceased Zahid Khan
inside the house of appellant, who fired at him
(deceased) with his pistol with the intention to
kill him, resultantly, he got hit and died on the
spot”. PW-4 has not only contradicted the place
of occurrence but also hinted at the non presence
of the complainant at the spot, as when this
witness was accompanying the dead body of
deceased to the DHQ, Hospital, Mardan, no one
from the complainant side was accompanied.

9. As alleged by the prosecution, the
occurrence took place inside a house, so the
female inmates living therein were natural
witnesses, but neither their statements under
section 161 was recorded nor they were
produced before the Court during trial. In this

manner, the prosecution withheld the best
evidence available, as such, under Article 129(g)
of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 984, legal inference
could be drawn that if the said witnesses had
entered into the witness box then they would not
have supported the prosecution case. Case law
refers: PLD 2016 SC 17.

10. Besides, no blood was recovered from the
spot of occurrence, which makes the venue of
the occurrence to be highly doubtful.

11. Another glaring tincture in the prosecution
case is that the IO/PW-12 stated before the Court
during trial that FIR and murasila was handed
over to him at the spot by Munir Khan ASI/PW-
6. Murasila in fact is a first information report
and such practice is against the fundamental
principles of criminal justice which gives a
license to police officials to maneuver the FIR in
any manner. Reference is made to case law laid
down in 1992 P.Cr.L.J 158.

2. From perusal of the record, one could
easily find that the prosecution evidence is
completely silent about the acquitted co-accused.
Such attitude of complainant as well the other
PWs except PW-4, pose themselves to the rule
‘falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus’ meaning

thereby “false in one thing, false in everything,
coupled with the fact that no appeal against
acquittal has been filed by the complainant.

3. The crux of afore-mentioned discussion is
that either the prosecution witnesses were not
present on the spot or they are not telling the
truth. Prosecution failed to build any nexus of the
accused-appellant with the commission of the
offence. Reliance could be safely placed on case

law reported in PLJ 2019 SC (Criminal Cases)

265.

12. The above discussion has led this Court to
believe that the learned trial court has erred in
appreciating the case evidence in its true
perspective. It has been held, time and again by
the superior courts, that a slightest doubt occurs
in the prosecution case is sufficient to grant
acquittal to an accused. The conclusions drawn
by the learned trial Court are not borne out of the
case evidence, therefore, the impugned judgment

is not sustainable.

7. For what has been discussed above, this
appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment is set
aside and the appellant is acquitted of the charge

levelled against him. He be set at liberty
10

forthwith, if not required to be detained in any

other case.
8. Above are the reasons of short order of
even date.
