JUDGMENT

AHMAD ALI, J. Through the instant petition, petitioner Abdul
Mateen S/o Pastak seekshis post-arrestbail case FIR No.928
dated 07.12.2019 under sections 377/355/34 PPC read with
Section 53 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection &
Welfare Act, 2010, Police Station Sarai Saleh, (Haripur), Same
relief was, however, declined to him by the learned trial Court
vide order dated 13.01.2020.

2. Brief facts of the case are thatcomplainant NaimatUllah
reported the matter to the local police that his nephew
SajjadAlam is student of 6" class. Two months prior, their

relative Abdul Latif enticed away SajjadAlam and in the
Page 2 of 7

orchards near bypass of Garr Sarai Saleh, he committed
sodomy with the victim and recorded his video. He threatened
the victim that in case he disclosed the occurrence to anyone, he
would kill him. Thereafter, with the consent of Abdul Latif,
Abdul Mateen also committed sodomy with the victim several
times. The complainant came to know about the occurrence
through his relatives and he asked from his nephew, who
disclosed entire facts to him. On the basis of said report, FIR
was lodged against the accused/petitioner.

3. I have given my anxious thought to the blue streak
arguments of learned counsel for the parties and gone through
the record with their able assistance.

4. Perusal of record reveals that the occurrence took place
two months prior and report was lodged on 02.12.2019 without
any plausible explanation. Moreover, the complainant failed to
disclose that who out of his relatives disclosed the occurrence
to him.

5. No doubt, the complainant, in his report, has though
charged accused for the commission of offence, but the medical
report available on recordsuggests that no sexual act wasdone
with the victim.Similarly, the report of FSL also does not

support the prosecution version. Except the solitary statement
Page 3 of 7

of complainant, no other incriminating evidence is available on
record to prima facie connect the accused-petitioner with the
commission of crime.Besides, no other eyewitness has been
cited so as to support the version of complainant.
6. So far as applicability of sections 53 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010
(hereinafter to be referred as the Act of 2010), is concerned, it
depicts that this law was specially introduced/enacted and
promulgated in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with particular
purposes i.e. to provide for the care, protection, maintenance,
welfare, training, education, rehabilitation and reintegration of
‘children at risk' in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. For the sake of
convenience and ready reference, the preamble of the Act of
2010, is reproduced below:-

"WHEREAS, it is expedient to provide for the care,

protection, maintenance, welfare, training, education,

rehabilitation and reintegration of children at risk in
the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa".

"Child at risk" has been defined under section 2(1)(e)
of the Act in the following words:-

"Child at risk" means a child in need of protection,
who

(i) is at risk, including an orphan, child with
disabilities, child of migrant workers, child
working and or living on the street, child in
conflict with the law and child living in extreme

poverty.

(ii) is found begging; or
Page 4 of 7

(iii) is found without having any home or settled
place of abode or without any ostensible
meaning of subsistence; or

(iv) has a parent or guardian who is unfit or
incapacitated to exercise control over the child;
or

(v) — lives in a brothel or with a prostitute or
frequently visits any place being used for the
purpose of prostitution or is found to associate
with any prostitute or any other person who
leads an immoral or depraved life; or

(vi) _ is being or is likely to be abused or exploited
for immoral or illegal purposes or gain; or

(vii) is beyond the parental control; or
(viii) is imprisoned with the mother or born in jail;

(ix) has lost his parents or one of the parents and
has no adequate source of income; or

(x) is victim of an offence punishable under this Act
or any other law for the time being in force and
his parent or guardian is convicted or accused
for the commission of such offence; Or

(xi) is left abandoned by his parent or parents as the
case may be, which will include a child born
out of wedlock and left abandoned by his
parent;

7. Keeping the Preamble of the Act in juxtaposition with
the definition of the "Child at risk" as contemplated under
section 2(1)(e) of the Act coupled with the facts and
circumstances of the instant case it could not be ascertained as
to whether the alleged victim, falls under the definition of
"child at risk" or otherwise. In such an eventuality, the

applicability of sections 53 of the Act of 2010, to the case of
Page 5 of 7

petitioners is yet a begging question.Wisdom can be derived
from case law reported in 2016 SCMR 1523, 2014 MLD 190
& 2018 YLR Note 114. In the given scenario, applicability of

sections 355 PPC would also require debate during trial.

8. In such eventuality, when the child did not fall under the
definition of “child at risk” as provided under Section 53,
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010;
and when except the solitary statement of complainant without
any medical support, no other incriminating evidence is
available on record to show any nexus of the accused-petitioner
with the commission of crime, at least at this stage, the case
against accused/petitioner squarely falls within the ambit of

further inquiry.

9. Moreover, in the instant case, no compliance with the
provision of Section 164-B Cr.P.C has been made because no
samples for DNA test have been obtained either from the
accused-petitioners or victim despite the fact that the word
“shall” is used in the said provision, making its applicability
mandatory. The prosecution must keep in mind this aspect
while dealing with such like offences, in the best interest of the

victim as well as the accused.

10. Investigation in the case is complete and accused-
petitioner is no more required to the prosecution for the very
purpose.Even otherwise, in view of the above stated facts, the
case calls for further inquiry under Sub-Section (2) of Section
497 Cr.P.C, therefore, further retention of the petitioner in jail

will serve no useful purpose.

11. Apart from the above, it has been held time and again by
the august Supreme Court that bail does not mean acquittal of
accused but only change of custody from Government agencies
to the sureties, who on furnishing bonds take responsibility to
produce the accused whenever and wherever required to be
produced. Reliance could be placed on case reported in 2008
SCMR 807 “Haji Muhammad Nazir Vs State”.

12. Before parting with this order, this court finds it
necessary to mention that all the observations recorded above
are tentative assessment just for the disposal of bail petition and
not intended to influence the mind of trial Court, which is free
to appraise the evidence strictly in accordance with law and
merits of the case.

13. So, by cutting the cackle, on tentative assessment of
material available on file, a case for the grant of bail is made

out. Consequently, this bail application is allowed and accused-
Page 7 of 7

petitioner, named above, is admitted to bail provided he
furnishesbail bonds in the sum of Rs.100,000/- (one lac), with
two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate, concerned, who shall ensure
that the sureties are local, reliable and men of means.

14. Above are the reasons of short order of even date.
