KAMRAN _ HAYAT MIANKHEL, J.- This
petition has been moved on behalf of the
petitioners namely Khanvai Khan and Afsar
Khan for admitting them to bail till final
conclusion of trial on statutory delay, who is
detained in case FIR No.103_ dated
19.01.2018 registered under sections 324/34
PPC/512 Cr.P.C at police station, City District

Haripur.

2. The allegation against the petitioners
is that they injured the son of complainant
namely Hamraj Khan by means of firearm.
They were placed under arrest on 25.02.2020
and 26.02.2020. Vide order dated 07.07.2022

he was declined bail by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-VlI, Haripur on_ statutory

delay, hence, this petition.

3. | have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the petitioner as well as learned
State counsel assisted by learned counsel for
complainant at length and scanned the record

with their valuable assistance.

4. Perusal of the record depicts that
petitioners were arrested on 25.02.2020 &
26.02.2020 and challan was_ submitted
against them before the learned trial court on
25.11.2020 and charge was framed against
him on 08.12.2020. It is evident from the
record that in this case twenty witnesses are
to be examined by the prosecution but till
today six witnesses have been examined by
the prosecution. It is by now settled law that
speedy and fair trial is the inherent right of
every accused. The guiding principle for the
grant of bail on the ground of inordinate delay
was laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court
in the case of Riasat Ali Vs Ghulam
Muhammad and the State (PLD 1968 SC

353), wherein it was held that “delay in
prosecution of accused amounts to abuse of
process of law and is a valid ground for
bailing out accused, however, delay in
prosecution of each case as a ground for bail
is to be weighed and judged, in each case on
its merits.” It is clear from the record that the
delay, if any, in concluding the trial is neither
attributable to the petitioners nor anyone
acting on their behalf and there is nothing on
record to suggest that petitioners are either a
hardened or desperate or dangerous criminal
or previously convicted offenders or involved
in the act of terrorism.

5. As regards the category of accused
mentioned in sixth proviso, it will be
appropriate to refer the case reported as
‘Moundar Vs The State’ (PLD 1990 SC 934)
wherein, the Full Bench of august Supreme
Court of Pakistan held as under:

“It is quite plain that the normal rule
stipulated in the Third proviso to
section 497 was that an under trial
prisoner shall be released, after expiry
of the respective period, without the
trial concluding. The Fourth proviso is
in substance an exception to the
aforesaid general rule contained in the
Third proviso. Before the Court applies
the exceptional provisions of the
Fourth proviso, it has to form an
opinion that the accused was a
previous convict or a criminal of one of
the categories described therein. The
words are "in the opinion of the Court".
Such opinion cannot be obviously
subjective but must be based upon
materials placed before the Court,
reasonably supporting the conclusion
that the person concerned is a criminal
of the classes described. The word
"criminal" has not been defined. It will
not be proper and indeed would be
difficult to define it or give it a specific
meaning. However, it is a common
word of the English language.
According to the Shorter Oxford
English Dictionary the word carries
several meanings, including the
meaning-- a person accused of a
crime. In the context of the provisions
under construction, we feel that the
word cannot be construed in the
technical sense, namely, that a formal
accusation must be made against the
person or that he should have been
adjudged guilty of a charge in a Court
of law. It appears to have been used in
the sense of a person who violates the
law of the land. The three adjectives
qualifying the word "criminal" may also
be examined.

According to the same dictionary the

word "harden" has been defined to
mean, inter alia, (1) to render or make
hard; to indurate, (2) to embolden,
confirm, (3) to make callous or
unfeeling and (4) to make persistent or
obdurate in a course of action or state
of mind. The word "hardened" has also
been defined to mean "made _ hard,
indurate; rendered callous; hard-
hearted; obdurately determined in a

course".

The same dictionary gives’ the
meaning of the word "desperate" inter
alia, in relation to person: driven to
desperation hence reckless, violent,

ready to risk or do anything.

The, same dictionary gives the
meaning of the word "dangerous",
inter alia, as fraught with danger or

risk; perilous, hazardous, unsafe.”

| am in respectful agreement with the
above enunciation of law. In the instant case,
the prosecution has not placed on record
anything before the Court to indicate that the
petitioners are hardened, desperate or
dangerous criminal or previously convicted
persons for an offence punishable with death
or imprisonment for life or a persons involved
in the act of terrorism. Under these

circumstances, it can safely be concluded that
the petitioners have successfully proved its
case for the grant of bail on the basis of
statutory delay, after remaining in custody for
more than one year and no prospects existed
of the trial being concluded within reasonable
time and detention of the accused-petitioners
for an indefinite period would amount to an
abuse of the process of the Court.
6. For what has been discussed
hereinabove, this petition is allowed and
petitioners are admitted to bail, subject to
furnishing bail bonds in the sum_ of
Rs.1,00,000/-(one lac) with two sureties, each
in the like amount to the satisfaction of the
Illaqa / duty Judicial Magistrate, who shall
ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and
men of means.

These are the detailed reasons of the
order of even date.
Announced:

11.11.2022.
