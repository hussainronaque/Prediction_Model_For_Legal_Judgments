MUHAMMAD AMJAD _ RAFIQ, J:- Accused/appellant

Fakhar Iqbal Shah was convicted in a trial concluded by learned
Additional Sessions Judge, Khanewal, in case FIR bearing No.241
dated 26.05.2022 registered under sections 302, 148, 149 PPC at
Police Station Kacha Khu, District Khanewal, vide impugned
judgment dated 30.05.2023, and sentenced as under:-

“Imprisonment for life, as Ta’zir under Section 302(b) PPC, for
committing murder of Qaim Ali deceased alongwith compensation of
Rs.400,000/- under section 544-A of Cr.P.C. to the legal heirs of
deceased and in default thereof to further undergo simple
imprisonment for six months ”

Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. was extended to the

convict/appellant.
Crl.A.No.592/2023. 2
Crl. Revision No.241/2023

Whereas co-accused Muhammad Iqbal Shah & Shehzad Anjum Shah
stood acquitted of the charge. Against said conviction and sentence,
the appellant has filed criminal appeal bearing No. 592/2023, whereas,
the complainant has preferred criminal revision No.241/2023 for
enhancement of sentence. Both these matters are being decided

through this single judgment.

02. Qaim Ali, a servant of Syed Siffat-ul-Hassan Shah, complainant
PW-6 was murdered on firing by five accused namely Fakhar Iqbal
Shah (appellant), Muhammad Iqbal Shah, Shahzad Anjum, Shujaat
Haider Shah and Jahanzeb alias Papi Shah. One fire of Kalashnikov
was attributed to the appellant which hit on the left side of head near
left ear of the deceased. Firing of remaining accused with
Kalashnikov, Gun 12 bore & Pistols remained ineffective. It was an
occurrence of 26.05.2022 at 12.30 p.m., committed in the street
leading to central Chowk of Chak No. 39/10-R, Kacha Khu, District
Khanewal. It was told that Qaim Ali was not ready to leave the
employment of complainant despite threats by the accused thus on
such motive he was murdered. Earlier on the day accused once again
extended him severe threats to life, and for reporting this aggression
complainant along with deceased were going to police station Kacha

Khu when occurrence took place.

03. Police found Shujaat Haider Shah and Jahanzeb alias Papi Shah
innocent during investigation and their discharge from the case was
recommended, but Magistrate did not agree to it, therefore, their
names were placed in column No.2 of report under section 173
Cr.P.C. Learned trial court however, conducted the trial of three
accused excluding Shujaat Haider Shah and Jahanzeb alias Papi Shah.
Out of whom only Fakhar Iqbal Shah, the appellant was convicted and

sentenced to imprisonment for life as stated above.

04. In this case a cross version also stood recorded and police to
the extent of firing by complainant party added offence under section

337-H (2) PPC, therefore from the evidence in this case it is an
Crl.A.No.592/2023. 3
Crl. Revision No.241/2023

admitted position that complainant party and accused party (except
two accused) were found present at the place of occurrence, therefore,
case needs a narrow appreciation of facts relating to position of parties

at the place of occurrence with their respective roles.

05. The story cracked by the witnesses about murder of Qaim Ali
weaves a scene which shows passing of the complainant, witnesses
and deceased through a street heading towards central chowk of Chak
No. 39/10-R in order to move to Police Station Kacha Khu when all of
a sudden, the occurrence broke out. Such situation is portrayed
through the site plan prepared by the police. Scaled site plan though
available in the file as Exh. PV but draftsman did not enter appearance
in the dock and it was claimed by Muhammad Kashif Nawaz TSI PW-
10 that he was dead. Prosecution did not seek a lawful tendering of
such site plan in evidence; therefore, it cannot be read into the
evidence. Thus, it is essential to see in depth view of unscaled site

plan to appreciate the facts spur out from the evidence.

---Site plan facts---
06. According to site plan complainant party was heading towards
north and they were quite at a distance from Central Chowk of Chak
No. 39/10-R where deceased received firearm injury in the street, but
as per FIR police station was towards South-west from the place of
occurrence. Moving to opposite direction does not cater any support
to the facts that they were actually going to police station to complain

about the day time threats of Iqbal Shah accused.

According to prosecution story, fire was made by Fakhar Iqbal
Shah, appellant from northern side, which is reflected from point No.
2, hitting the deceased at point No. 1 (south-west) which is an
impossible angle because there was an intervening wall of 5/6 feet on
northern side whereas 2 feet high wall on eastern side, it could only
hit the deceased if bullet takes a swing of around 10 feet from point

No.4 to point No. 1, which is an impossibility.
Crl.A.No.592/2023. A
Crl. Revision No.241/2023

Accused Fakhar Iqbal Shah was at point No. 2, whereas other
four accused duly armed with rifle, Gun and pistols were at point No.
3 but spent shells were found present at point No. 4 which is just in
front of point No. 1 where the deadbody was lying. There is no
mention of inter se distance between point No. 1 & point No. 4 in the
site plan but distance of accused (at point No. 2 & 3) from point No. 1
(where dead body was lying) is mentioned as 10 Karms (55 feet),
same would obviously be read for point No. 4 as well; therefore,
availability of spent shells at a distance of 10 Karams from the point

where accused made firing is an impossible situation.

Prosecution claimed that accused received fire in the street and
died there and then, but as per site plan his deadbody was found
present in the nearby courtyard of baithak of one Muhammad Aslam
Juggi (point No.1 in site plan) which is accessible from said street
only on crossing a two-feet high wall on western side as highlighted
above. It is near to impossibility that after receiving fire by the
deceased in the street, his body tossed to nearby courtyard. Deadbody
of deceased is also visible lying in the courtyard from the pictures
produced by the prosecution and the defence. No splash of blood on
western side wall, nor even explanation how deadbody reached to that
place which raises a question that had no answer. Investigating officer
PW-10 also collected blood from one place (point No.1) and admitted

during cross examination as under;

“Tt is correct that it has been mentioned in Exh. PU that deceased
Qaim Ali after receiving injuries fell down on point No.1 and
succumbed to the injuries on same place.”

07. Blood so collected was deposited in the PFSA on 16.08.2022
after about 3 months which fact is reflected from PFSA Report Exh.
PW as well as from the statements of Ghulam Sarwar 779/HC,
Moharrir PW-4 & Muhammad Kashif Nawaz, investigating officer
PW-10. It was because at the time of collection of blood police was
not sure about the place where actually deceased received the fire

because dead body was lying contra to claim of witnesses and in the
Crl.A.No.592/2023. 5
Crl. Revision No.241/2023

memo of collection of blood there was an overwriting/cutting of word
“Mitti/soil with Cotton/rooi” probably due to reason that courtyard of
baithak was soiled and not soling. PW-10 investigating officer faced
the cross examination with respect to cutting/overwriting on the
memo showing collection of blood, which is as under;
“Tt is incorrect to suggest that in Ex.PP the word “Rooi/cotton” was
overwriting by rubbing the word “mitti/soil”. It is incorrect to

suggest that the Exh.PP, the word “mitti/soil” is also rubbing in
third line”

Such facts are visible on naked eye view of Ex.PP, and run against the
claim of prosecution about place of occurrence. Malafide of
investigating officer PW-10 is also reflected from the fact that though
on 16.08.2022 he was not posted in the police station Kacha Khu yet
he took the samples of blood-stained earth for its deposit in the PFSA

and this fact he admitted during cross examination as under;

“Tt is correct that I was not posted at P.S Kacha Khu on 16.08.2022. It
is incorrect that I was not authorized to collect the samples for
onward transmission to PFSA.”

It shows that he conducted defective investigation and did not
dispatch the samples in time, that was the reason no other police
officer was ready to take responsibility of depositing of parcels in the

PFSA.

08. Prosecution has not opted to produce the first responder and
most relevant witness i.e., employees of Ambulance Service 1122.
Though prosecution obtained a written report and in pictures produced
by prosecution and defence presence of officer with uniform of such
Service is visible yet his statement to any effect is not available on the

record nor he entered appearance in the dock.

---Medical evidence---

09. Appearance of deadbody and examination of clothes by the
doctor shows that white dots were on whole body and clothes were
mud stained, though place of occurrence was a street with no mud but

no explanation of such facts is on the record.
Crl.A.No.592/2023. 6
Crl. Revision No.241/2023

10. Inquest report, consists of four pages, is not an original
document, rather on carbon copy some of the columns left blank in
original were filled with live writing which indicates that whole
information was not added in such report at one point of time giving
birth to suspicion of consultation and deliberation. In such report
neither the distance of police station from where deadbody was found
is mentioned nor articles carried by the deceased at the time of death.
Age of deceased, and condition of mouth & face is also not mentioned
in column No. 8 & 9 of the report. Column No. 12 relating to weapon
of offence was also kept blank as well as column No. 22 & 23, and
necessary information is also missing in column No. 24. Despite these
apparent flaws, interestingly challan was passed by the prosecution
agency and prosecutor who conducted prosecution did not attend such
facts too, so much so learned lower court also allowed to tender such
defective report in the evidence which was not admissible at all. As
per law documentary evidence is proved through primary evidence by
producing original document itself, or by secondary evidence through
tendering of its copy but that too after satisfying the court about loss
of original, but it has not been done in this case. This is the basic
document which help to formalize the position of deadbody, its
presence, condition and articles lying around it, which facts later
speak out by the witness in support thereof. This document also
provides a line of inquiry to police for detection of mode of crime and

also identifying the offenders with ensued arrest.

11. Locale of injury on left side of head just behind left ear is also
stands in contradiction to prosecution story according to which
deceased was facing towards accused persons. 10 spent shells of rifle
and seven of pistol collected by the police from the spot clearly shows
that number of fires made by accused persons remained ineffective
because neither they hit witnesses nor to deceased except one as stated
above. Size of wound was also observed by the doctor as of 5 cm x 8
cm which is not possible with a riffled weapon and that too from a

range of 55 feet. Exit wound was also not observed by the doctor,
Crl.A.No.592/2023. 7
Crl. Revision No.241/2023

therefore, exploration of forensic literature on the subject is essential.
A book titled “SIMPSON’S FORENSIC MEDICINE” by Bernard
Knight in Tenth Edition (Chapter-8, Firearm and Explosive Injuries)
explains the nature and function of riffled weapons as under;
“These comprise revolvers, ‘automatic pistols’, rifles, and many types
of military weapons. All differ from shot gun in that they fire one
projectile at a time through a barrel that has spiral grooves cut into the
metal, the intervening projections being called ‘lands’. These grip the

bullet and impart a gyroscopic spin which assists in maintaining an
accurate trajectory.”

In the same book at page 110 & 111 it is mentioned as follows;

“Due to higher velocities and the greatest mass of the bullet, many
riffled wounds will traverse the body, causing both an entrance and
an exit wound. Exceptions will be where bone is struck, obstructing
the bullet or fragmenting it. Small calibre bullets as .22, unless from
a high velocity weapon, may often fail to exit from the body.”

Non-availability of exit wound in this case could be the result as
highlighted above by Simpson. Now the reason for size of injury is as

follows;

“At extreme ranges, the gyroscopic track is lost and the missile
begins to wobble and even turn end-over end. This causes a larger,
more irregular wound and the bullet may even strike side-ways,
leaving a linear wound.”

This could happen in this case as well; probably fire was made from
extreme range beyond 55 feet and bullet while wobbling hit the
temporal bone of the deceased. In this way claim of presence of
accused at a distance of 55 feet cannot be honoured, particularly when
investigating officer opined that during the occurrence both the parties

resorted to aerial firing.

12. It was an occurrence at about 12.30 p.m. on 26.05.2022, doctor
observed time elapsed between injury and death 15-30 minutes, Police
station was at a distance of 12 miles FIR was registered at 1.15 p.m.
not on oral assertion of complainant but on the written complaint
(verified by PW-2), wherein it is mentioned that witnesses were left
at guard of deadbody which means that at the time of registration of

FIR deadbody was at the place of occurrence, but postmortem report
Crl.A.No.592/2023. 8
Crl. Revision No.241/2023

reveals receiving of deadbody in dead house at 1.00 p.m. whereas
PW-10 Muhammad Kashif Nawaz SI states that on 26.05.2022 Umar
Saeed 420/C handed over him police file of this case for investigation
and he proceeded to the place of occurrence where deadbody was
available. After collecting blood underneath the deadbody, he
prepared papers for postmortem and dispatched the deadbody to RHS
Kacha Khu in the company of Nafees Abass and Zameer ul Hassan
through Muhammad Farooq 908/C. During cross examination he told
the time of shifting of deadbody as 1:45 p.m. but said Muhammad
Farooq 908/C when appeared as PW-9 stated reaching of RHC at 1:45
p.m. Thus, receiving of deadbody in deadhouse at 1.00 p.m. which
was also endorsed by the Dr Muhammad Naeem Anwar PW-1 leaves

many questions and doubts on the facts knitted by the prosecution.

13. Defence disputed the time of occurrence as well by referring the
cross examination of Abdul Mujeeb ASI PW-12 who after arresting
the accused persons concluded the investigation with the help of DSP.
While responding to a question during cross examination he deposed

as under;

“Tt is correct that on 23.08.2022 I collected the report from office
of rescue 1122 and 15 (Exh.PH) also. It is correct that according to
report of rescue 1122 that information was received to rescue 1122
at 12.13 p.m. (noon). According to that report already & shifted to
RHC Kacha Khu, Khanewal, mentioned. In column of remarks in
report 15, it has been mentioned that some people are fighting
there and doing firing there.”

Thus, death of deceased at the place of occurrence, shifting of
deadbody by police on the day of occurrence at relevant time becomes

highly doubtful.

14. Another alarming fact gets notice of this court that PW-1 doctor
did not declare cause of death at the time of postmortem examination
rather on 22.09.2022 after about four months on the request of police
this lacuna was filled out. There was no exit wound in this case; entry
wound on left temporal side resulted into presence of bullet inside the

cranial cavity but doctor was unable to explain the point from where it
Crl.A.No.592/2023. 9
Crl. Revision No.241/2023

was extracted and also what was the trajectory because it was distant
fire without blackening around it as per prosecution story. Bullet
recovered from the cranial cavity was not sent to PFSA for
examination, even no X-ray or MRI was produced by the prosecution
to prove that bullet was inside the brain. Thus, cause of death and
circumstances in which death occurred is also doubtful in this case,
that was the reason inquest report was also defective. The overall
perusal of medical evidence shows that it stands in contradiction with
ocular account, therefore, cannot be relied upon in support of
prosecution story. Reliance is on case reported as “RIASAT ALI and

another versus The STATE and another” (2024 SCMR 1224).

---Cross version analysis---

15. In this case a cross version was recorded and held intact to the
extent of ineffective firing by the complainant party, sequence of facts
portrays that spent shells collected from the place of occurrence at
point No. 4 were probably of the weapons used by the complainant
party because point No. 4 in the site plan (place where spent shells
were found) is near to the place where the complainant and witnesses
were present i.e., Point No. 5 and this fact was conceded by the
investigating officer when appeared as PW-10 as under;

“Tt is correct that as per Exh. PU site plan recovery of empty is

shown more nearer where the Pws were present then that of the
position of accused persons at point No.2 & 3.”

Cross version carries the narrative that Qaim Ali was hit by the firing
of complainant party, and report under section 173 Cr.P.C. also states
that Qaim Ali started firing first and accused persons retaliated.
Another investigating officer Abdul Mujeeb ASI PW-12 when

appeared in the dock concedes as under;

It is correct that on 28.08.2022, it was version of the accused
persons that at the time of death of Qaim Ali (since deceased), he
was armed with rifle and pistol. It is correct that it was the version
of the accused party that complainant party was coming behind
Qaim Ali (since deceased) who received firearm injury from the
hands of complainant party. It is correct on 28.08.2022, 31 persons
appeared in support of accused party and they all professed that
Crl.A.No.592/2023. 10
Crl. Revision No.241/2023

accused were not involved in the occurrence. It is correct that
persons who appeared in support of accused party stated that the
deceased was murdered by the firing of complainant party. It is
correct that it is mentioned in daily diary dated: 28.08.2022 that
during inspection of site, which empties of bullet 30 bore and
empties of Kalashnikov were taken into possession by the police
which were lying scattered near the deadbody of the deceased. It is
correct that where the deadbody of deceased Qaim Ali was lying,
distance of dead body and position of accused persons was 50-55
feet. The rifle and pistol of the deceased were picked up by the
complainant party.

(Emphasis supplied)

Thus, showing the empties/spent shells near the deadbody means that
they were found scattered at point No. 1, courtyard of baithak of
Aslam Juggi, where the accused never approached which shows that
Qaim Ali deceased and complainant party was firing at accused party
while taking shelter of 5/6 feet high northern wall and accused party
was also retaliating when one of the fires hit the deceased. It can be
presumed that in order to make fire at accused party, deceased might
have tilted his head on the right from behind the northern wall when a
blind bullet from accused side hit him. Position of deceased if was so,
as assumed, the fire would definitely hit on left side of head, but how
or whose fire hit him cannot be assessed through guess work. As
observed above, it was a distant fire without producing blackening
around the wound, therefore, complainant party who was hiding

behind the northern wall cannot view who actually had made that fire.

---Recovery of Rifle---
16. Rifle planted on the appellant was his licensed weapon but
despite that it did not match with the spent shells collected from the
place of occurrence. Rifle was also not identified by the witnesses as
the same used in the occurrence. Practice of marking an article like
rifle as ‘P’ on the recovery memo is not mere a formality rather being
real evidence it must be shown to the witnesses to identify or
comment upon it so as to facilitate the inspection of Court that this
was the weapon used by the accused for commission of offence.
Proviso two to Article 71 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 says as

under;
Crl.A.No.592/2023. 11
Crl. Revision No.241/2023

“Provided further that, if oral evidence refers to the existence or

condition of any material thing other than a document, the Court
may, if it thinks fit, require the production of such material thing for

its inspection:

(Emphasis supplied)
This proviso obviously creates an exception to direct evidence and
requires that if oral evidence refers to the existence or condition of
any material thing other than document which of course includes
weapons, stolen articles, implements, instruments, substance, vehicles
and depending upon the nature of offence committed some of the spot
recoveries like cigarette butts, packets, pen, mobile, bottles, crockery,
utensils, stoves, gas cylinders etc., must be produced for the
inspection of court. The words “for its inspection” referred in above
proviso has wide connotation which requires a detailed examination
of such article/material thing by the court and while relying upon such
recovery court should also give its findings about such article. Rule
14-F of Chapter 24-B, Volume III of the Lahore High Court Rules and
Orders mandates as under:-

“Clothes, weapons, money, ornaments, food and every article
which forms a part of the circumstantial evidence should be
produced in Court and their connection with the case and
identity should be proved by witnesses”.

Thus, in the present case Court should have given finding with respect
to description of weapon, its calibre and other necessary details so as
to productively use this kind of evidence as corroboration to principal
facts, which has not been done. Thus, recovery of rifle cannot be

relied upon or used against the accused/appellant in any manner.

17. Neither Muhammad Aslam Juggi appeared during investigation
or trial nor the residents of adjacent houses were associated in to the
investigation despite the fact it was daylight occurrence. Interestingly
as per site plan there is a grocery store of one Niaz Utra just opposite
to place where deadbody was found but he was also not the witness in
this case. Existence of grocery store is an indicator that people of
locality might have been available at the time of occurrence but

prosecution opted not to produce any independent witness and relied
Crl.A.No.592/2023. 12
Crl. Revision No.241/2023

on their own team of people consisting of three brothers including
complainant. Under Article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984 adverse inference is drawn to the effect that had such witnesses
been produced by the prosecution at the trial, they would not have
supported the case of the prosecution. Reliance is placed on case reported as
“RIASAT ALI and another versus The STATE and_ another”
(2024 SCMR 1224).

18. Motive alleged by the prosecution seems dreary, neither
plausible nor appealable; enmity usually exist between the parties and
not with their servants/employees, particularly when there was no
earlier dispute between them. It was nothing but a word of mouth,
thus prosecution failed to prove the motive in this case. Reliance is
placed on cases reported as “NOOR MUHAMMAD versus THE
STATE and another” (2010 SCMR 97) & “PATHAN versus The
STATE” (2015 SCMR 315).

19. Another aspect of the matter is that during trial, co-accused
Muhammad Iqbal Shah & Shehzad Anjum Shah stood acquitted by
the learned trial Court, as such, serious doubt was created upon the
prosecution case qua the involvement of Fakhar Iqbal Shah present
accused/appellant and he could not have been convicted under the
principle of “falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus” (false in one thing,
false in all), on the same set of evidence. Reliance is placed on the
case reported as “Notice to Police Constable Khizar Hayat son of
Hadait Ullah” (PLD 2019 SC 527) and “PERVAIZ KHAN and
another versus The STATE” (2022 SCMR 393).

20. It is settled principle of law that conviction must be based on
unimpeachable, trustworthy and reliable evidence. Any doubt arising
in prosecution case is to be resolved in favour of the accused and
burden of proof is always on prosecution to prove its case beyond
reasonable doubt. It is also an established principle of law and equity
that it is better that 100 guilty persons should let off but one innocent

person should not suffer. In attending circumstances, prosecution has
Crl.A.No.592/2023. 13
Crl. Revision No.241/2023

failed to prove the charge against the accused/appellant beyond
shadow of doubt and numerous doubts crept into the evidence,
therefore, benefit of which is extended to the appellant not as a matter
of grace but as a matter of right. Reliance is on cases reported as
“MAQSOOD_ ALAM and another Versus The STATE and others”
(2024 SCMR 156), “ABDUL QADEER Versus The STATE”
(2024 SCMR 1146), “MUHAMMAD IMTIAZ BAIG and _ another
Versus The STATE through Prosecutor General, Punjab, Lahore and
another” (2024 SCMR 1191), “MUHAMMAD HASSAN and another
Versus The STATE and_ others” (2024 SCMR 1427), “KHIAL
MUHAMMAD _Versus_ The STATE” (2024 SCMR_ 1490) &
“MUHAMMAD IJAZ alias BILLA and another Versus The STATE
and others” (2024 SCMR 1507).

21. Consequently, this (Criminal Appeal No.241 of 2023 filed by
Fakhar Iqbal Shah, appellant is allowed, and conviction and sentence
recorded by the learned trial court against him is set-aside. Appellant,
namely, Fakhar Iqbal Shah is acquitted of the charge. He be released
forthwith, if not required to be detained in any other case. The case
property, if any, be disposed of in accordance with law and the record
of the learned trial court be sent back immediately. As the appellant
has been acquitted from the charge while accepting his appeal,
therefore, criminal revision No.241/2023 for enhancement of
sentence is dismissed.
