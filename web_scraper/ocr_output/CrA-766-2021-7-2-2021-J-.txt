JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN_KHAN, _J:-This criminal appeal filed by
Zarwais Khan, the appellant, is directed against the judgment
dated 15.07.2021, passed by learned ASJ-II/Judge Special Court,
Khyber, whereby the appellant has been convicted under section
9 (d) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic Substances Act,
2019, and sentenced to undergo five years rigorous imprisonment
and to pay Rs.500,000/- as fine or in default thereof to further
undergo six month simple imprisonment, in case FIR No.199
dated 01.09.2020, registered under section 9 (d) and 15 KP Arms
Act, 2013 at Police Station Jamrud.

2. The prosecution’s case as unfolded in the First
Information Report (FIR) Exh.PW.2/1 is that on receipt of spy
information about availability of huge quantity of narcotics in the

house of appellant, on 01.09.2020 Adnan Khan SI (PW.4) along
yt

with other police officials including the SHO Police Station
Jamrud, raided the house of appellant, apprehended him in the
court-yard of his house along with a polythene bag in his hand,
search of which led to the recovery of three packets of heroin,
each weighing 1000 grams, making the total of 3000 grams. The
complainant-SI (PW.4), separated 05 grams from each packet as
sample for chemical analysis by the FSL. On search of the house,
he also recovered a Kalashnikov bearing No.AA.99999630578
along with fixed charger, containing 9 live rounds of the same
bore. He took the alleged recovered heroin, arm and ammunitions
vide recovery memo Exh.PW.4/1 in presence of its marginal
witnesses, drafted Murasila Exh.PW.4/2 and sent the same to
Police Station on the basis of which FIR Exh.PW.2/1 was
registered against the appellant.

3. On receipt of copy of FIR, Tilawat Shah SI (PW.7)
proceeded to the spot and prepared site plan Exh.PW.7/1, on the
pointation of the Seizing Officer, recorded statements of the PWs
under section 161 Cr.P.C, sent the samples to the FSL, report
whereof is Exh.PW.7/5 and on completion of investigation
submitted challan under section 9 (c) KP CNS Act, 2019 and
challan under section 15 KP Arms Act, 2013, against the apellant
before the learned trial Court.

4. On receipt of challan by the learned trial court, the
appellant was summoned and formally charge sheeted to which
he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial, hence, prosecution

evidence was invited. On closure of the prosecution’s evidence,
Cl ¢

statement of the appellant was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C,
wherein he denied the prosecution’s allegation and professed his
innocence. He, however, declined to be examined on oath or to
produce evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial, the learned
trial court after hearing both the sides convicted and sentenced

the appellant as mentioned above, hence, this appeal.

5. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard and
record perused.
6. In the FIR, the time of occurrence is shown as 0300

hours in the month of September i.e. midnight. From the very
initial report Exh.PW.4/2, the story of the prosecution seems
dubious. It is the case of prosecution that when complainant
Adnan Khan SI along with other police official including the
SHO of Police Station Jamrud, raided the house of the appellant,
he was standing in the courtyard of his house having in his
possession a polythene bag containing 03 Kgs heroin. Presence of
the appellant, in the courtyard of his house at 0300 hours (night),
that too, along with 03 Kgs heroin, is beyond the comprehension
of a prudent mind as in such hours of night people are found in
their beds and not in the courtyard. Adnan SI (PW.4) in cross-
examination has admitted that he has not annexed with record
daily diary showing his departure and arrival in Police Station on
the day of occurrence. He further admitted it correct that SHO
Police Station Jamrud was also present with him in the raid, but
he has not cited him as witness to recovery proceeding. The

complainant SI has not furnished any explanation, much less
en

plausible, as to why the SHO, who was Incharge of the Police
Station did not became complainant and Seizing Officer in the
case. Complainant SI (PW.4) has further admitted that they were
not accompanied by any lady constable and that at the time of
raid two female inmates along with children were also present in
the spot house. He further admitted it correct that he has not
sealed the recovered Kalashnikov into parcel on the spot and that
no note-able of the locality was associated with the alleged
recovery proceedings. Non-association of any noteable of the
area as well as lady constable with the raid and recovery
proceedings not only makes the recovery highly doubtful but
amounts to violation of the provisions of sections 27, 28 and 31
of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic Substances Act,
2019 (Act of 2019). Under Proviso attached to section 27 of the
Act of 2019, in case of search of the dwelling house, the Officer
conducting search shall accompany lady constables and shall
given an opportunity to the women of such dwelling house to
observe pardh in order to maintain the dignity and modesty of the
women and dwelling house. Similarly, under proviso to section
31 of the Act of 2019, in case of search of a dwelling house, the
provisions of section 103 Cr.P.C. shall_be_strictly_observed.
Section 32 of the Act of 2019, provides penal consequences, in
case of non-compliance of the provisions of section 27 of the Act
of 2019, according to which an officer authorized under section
27, if enters into dwelling house without compliance of section

103 of the Code or does not give an opportunity to women of
such dwelling house to observe pardha, as provided in
sub-section (1) of section 27, shall be punishment with
imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and
shall also be liable to fine which may extend to rupees one lace
but shall not be less than rupees fifty thousands. The above
mandatory provisions of the law have been blatantly violated by
the complainant/Seizing Officer in the instant case, therefore, he
is liable to face the legal consequences under the law.

7. Neither the complainant SI nor the Investigating Officer
has brought on record an iota of evidence to prove the spot house
was the sole ownership of the appellant or in his sole occupation.
Rather, from the prosecution evidence it is proved that two
females along with children were also present in the spot house
meaning thereby that the house was jointly owned. Aziz ASI
(PW.6), who was posted as Moharrir in Police Station Jamrud on
the day of occurrence has stated that the Kalashnikov handed
over to him by Adnan Khan SI was not in sealed condition.
Tilawat Shah SI (PW.7)/Investigating Officer in  cross-
examination has stated that the spot house was consisting of
several rooms and that he has not recorded statement of any
person of the surrounding houses. He further admitted that in
Register No.19 column No.6, 7 and 8 are blank and in application
to the FSL, receipt number, name of the person who took the
samples to the FSL are also not mentioned.

8. On reappraisal of the prosecution’s evidence, I have

reached to an irresistible conclusion that the recovery of
contraband narcotic, arm and ammunition from the house of the
appellant as alleged by the prosecution, is highly doubtful, benefit
of which is to be extended to the appellant.

8. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed. Conviction and
sentences of the appellant recorded by the learned trial Court vide
judgment dated 15.07.2021, are hereby set-aside and the
appellant is acquitted from the charge leveled against him in the
instant case. He be set at liberty forthwith if not confined in any
other case.

9. Before parting with the judgment, the learned trial Court
is directed to open separate file against the Seizing
Officer/complainant of the instant case for proceedings against
him under section 32 of the Act of 2019, after giving him proper
notice and providing him an opportunity of hearing. Copy of this
judgment along with judicial record be transmitted to the learned
trial court for onward proceedings at that end strictly in
accordance with the provisions of section 32 of the Act of 2019.
