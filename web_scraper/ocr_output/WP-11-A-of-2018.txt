Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Minerals Sector Governance
Act, 2016 was promulgated, which was further
amended and repealed vide Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Minerals Governance Act, 2017 (Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Act No.XXXVI of 2017) when it was
notified on 15" November, 2017. The aim and
object of promulgation is to provide for effective
regulation of minerals, mines and mining in the
Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, through
development of the sector by establishment of
transparent administrative, management, legal and
fiscal frameworks and to cater for internationally
competitive, stable, conducive and enabling business
environment for investments in the minerals sector
thereof. Since in the instant case, the FIR is
registered alleging violation of sections 54 and 83 of

the Minerals Sector Governance Act, 2016, as such,
the relevant provisions of the Repealed Act of 2016
would be reproduced:

“§.2 (q) Licensing Authority means:-

(i) In relation to large scale mining and
small scale mining, the Committee
constituted under section 6 of this Act;
and

(ii) In relation to minor minerals, the
Director General Mines and Minerals.”

“54.Unauthorized mining.---(1) If any person,
directly or indirectly, starts prospecting,
exploring or mining any mineral outside the area
granted to him under a mineral title or in any
area for which he has not obtained a mineral title
or if any person obstructs free access of a
holder of a mineral title to the licensed or leased
area or directly or indirectly tries to interfere with
the prospecting or mining operations by a holder
of a mineral title, he shall be punishable with
imprisonment for a term of minimum six months
which may extend up to three years, and a fine
of minimum five hundred thousand which may
extend up to two million, or with both.

(2)The Licensing Authority shall appoint a
technical committee to assess the losses
incurred due to obstruction, hindrance, or
closure of the prospecting, exploration or mining
operations caused by any person, and shall
proceed to recover the assessed losses from
such person, which in case of default, shall be
recovered as arrears of land revenue.

(3)In the event of any unauthorized mining,
obstruction, hindrance or interference in the
prospecting, exploration or mining operations,
the administration of the locality, on request of
the Licensing Authority, shall take all necessary
steps to stop the illegal acts to ensure smooth
operations of the holder of the mineral title.
(4)Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-
section (1), the Licensing Authority shall have
the power to stop unauthorized work in such
manner as it may deem fit and recover in
addition to the penalty, the pit-mouth value of
the mineral so excavated from the person
responsible for such un-authorized work.”

In Schedule V & VI of the Mineral Sector
Governance Act, 2016, certain offences were
mentioned relating to the violation of provisions of
the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mineral Sector
Governance Act, 2016. Similarly, section 83

provides offences, punishment and its cognizance.
This

section being relevant to the

present

controversy, it is, therefore, reproduced as below:

“83.Offences, punishments and cognizance.--
(1) The offences specified in Schedule-V and
Schedule-VI shall be liable to punishment by
way of imprisonment, fine, seizure, forfeiture,
confiscation, impounding and such _ other
penalties as are provided in this Act.
(2)Whoever commits any of the offences
specified in-
(a) Part-l of the Schedule-V shall be

accused was directed by the Licensing

fine which may extend to one thousand
rupees for every day for the period the
accused has persisted in the offence
from the date of its commission;
(b) Part-ll of Schedule-V shall be

from the date of its commission; and
(c) Schedule-VI_ shall in the first

and, where an accused repeats the

the same punishment as provided in
clause (b).
(3) The offences specified in clause (a) of
sub-section (2) shall be cognizable and non-

1898), but the limit of punishment mentioned in
sub-section (2) of section 262 thereof shall not
be applicable.
(6) Unless any specific provision is provided
in this Act, the provision of Criminal Procedure
Code, 1898 (V of 1898) shall apply to all the
proceedings under this Act.”

5. In the instant case, the FIR registered
against the accused/petitioners has been questioned
on the ground that it was not reported by the
Licensing Authority or an officer authorized by it in
his behalf, as such, we endeavor to further elaborate
this matter. Section 154 of the Criminal Procedure
Code, 1898 deal with registration of FIR, it is

reproduced for convenience of reference:

“4154. Information in cognizable cases. Every
information relating to the commission of a
cognizable offence if given orally to an officer in
charge of a police station, shall be reduced to
writing by him or under his direction, and be
read over to the informant ; and every such
information, whether given in writing or reduced
to writing as aforesaid, shall be signed by the
person giving it, and the substance thereof shall
be entered in a book to be kept by such officer in
such form as the 1[Provincial Government] may
prescribe in this behalf

Provided that if the information is given
by the woman against whom an offence under
section 336B, section 354, section 354A, section
376 or section 509 of the Pakistan Penal Code,
1860 (Act XLV of 1860)is alleged to have been
committed or attempted, than such information
shall be recorded by an investigating officer in
presence of a female police officer or a female
family member or any other person with consent
of the complainant, as the case may be

Provided further that if the information,
given by the woman against whom an offence
under section 336B, section354, section 354A,
section 376 or section 509 of the Pakistan Penal
Code, 1860 (Act XLV of 1860) is alleged to have
been committed or attempted, is distressed such
information shall be recorded by an investigating
officer at residence of the complainant or at a
convenient place of the complainant's choice in
presence of a police officer or family member or
any other person with consent of the
complainant, as the case may be.”

F.I.R. under section 154 Cr.P.C can be registered by
an informant about any occurrence and necessarily

he may not be an aggrieved person while section 83
of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mineral Sector
Governance Act, 2016 provides that the offence
relating to violation of its provisions shall be
reported to the respective police station by the
Licensing Authority or an officer authorized by it in
this behalf. In this case, the Mineral Guard of the
relevant office of the respondent-department has
reported for registration of F.I.R., allegedly
complaining about violation of sections 54 and 83 of
the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Minerals Sector
Governance Act, 2016, in violation of section 83 of
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Minerals Sector Governance
Act, 2016.

6. Two principles of law are applicable to
the case in hand, one is that where law required an
act to be done in a particular manner, it has to be
done in that manner alone and such dictate of law
could not be termed as technicality. Reference can
be made to the case of ‘Muhammad Anwar and
others Vs. Mst. Ilyas Begum and others’ (PLD
2013 SC 255) and the other principle that is the
foremost is that where there is conflict of procedural
law on the same subject, special law has to be
applied. Reference can be made to the case of
‘Tanveer Hussain Vs. Divisional Superintendent,

Pakistan Railways and two others’ (PLD 2006 SC
249), PLD 2019 Islamabad 1, 2019 P.Cr.L.J 504,
PLD 2019 SINDH 209 and PLD 2019 Lahore 429.
7. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mineral
Sector Governance Act, 2016 being a special law
wherein section 83 authorizes only the Licensing
Authority or the person authorized by it in his behalf
to report violation of the provisions of the Act ibid,
however from the record we have not found any
authorization from the Licensing Authority, thus, the
registration of F.I.R by an unauthorized person in
the instant case cannot be considered as a legal
F.LR. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in
case of ‘Syed Mushahid Shah and others Vs.
Federal Investment Agency and others’ (2017
SCMR 1218) held that where there is conflict
between a special law and general law, the former
will prevail over the latter, as such, it is held that
section 154 Cr.P.C shall be read with section 83 of
the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mineral Governance Act,
2016 and the word informant mentioned in section
154 Cr.P.C shall be considered as substituted with
the word ‘Licensing Authority or the person
authorized by it in this behalf’ for the purpose of
registration of F.I.R.

8. For the reasons stated above, this and

the connected writ petitions are allowed. The F.I.Rs
impugned having been registered in violation of law
are struck down. However, the respondents shall be

at liberty to proceed afresh against the petitioners in
accordance with law, if they are so advised.
