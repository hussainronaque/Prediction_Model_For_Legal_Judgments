JUDGMENT

Dr. Khurshid Iqbal, J.-

lL This writ petition has been filed by
the petitioners, Toti Rahman and 06 other,
residents of Rahim Abad, Tehsil Samarbagh,
District Dir Lower. They seek the following
prayer under article 199 of the Constitution:

“On acceptance of the instant petition, the
order/judgment dated 29.06.2022 passed
in Cr, Revision No.14/I0 of 2022 by
Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zila Qazi,
Samarbagh, Dir Lower (respondent No.8)
and order/judgment dated 02.12.2021
passed by Executive Magistrate, Sarnarbagh,
Dir Lower (respondent No.9), be quashed
and complaint under section 133 Cr.P.C
filed by respondents No.2 to 7 may please
be dismissed.

Any other remedy which is just, efficacious
may also be awarded in favour of petitioner
though not specifically prayed for,”

Bakht Sher Ali/Steno* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Dr. Khurshid Iqbal

2. Facts shortly are that the respondents
No.2 to 7 filed a complaint u/s. 133, Cr.P.C,
against the petitioners before the learned Assistant
Commissioner/Executive Magistrate, Samarbagh,
District Dir Lower. They contended therein that a
path leads to their houses has been constructed by
the local elders some 15 years ago and to this
effect, the residents of Rahim Abad have settled
certain terms in the shape of a contract about the
usage as well as extension of routes from it to the
houses of individuals. They further averred that
the petitioners were obstructing the path in dispute

and have blocked it for the respondents No.2 to 7.

3. The learned Executive Magistrate
sent the above-mentioned complaint to the SHO
of the Police Station concerned for necessary
action as per law. After making necessary
investigation, the police submitted its detailed
inquiry report coupled with the statements of
witnesses recorded during the investigation.
Pursuant to the police report, the learned trial
Court passed a conditional order on 28.05.2021,
whereby he directed the petitioners to remove the

obstruction from the path in dispute and appear

Bakht Sher Ali/Steno* {S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Dr. Khurshid Iqbal

before him either to show cause or claim jury,

failing which, further legal action will be taken
against them. The petitioners through their
counsel appeared before the learned trial Court
and till 02.12.2021. They did not make any
objection to the existence of the path. The learned
trial Court vide his order dated 02.12.2021
confirmed his previous order passed on 28.05.2021,
regarding removal of obstruction and _ its
restoration to original shape for the use of
residents of the locality. Being aggrieved, the
petitioners assailed the aforesaid order through a
revision petition before the learned Additional
Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi, Dir Lower at
Samagbagh, however, which met the same fate

vide his judgment passed on 29.06.2022,

4, The petitioner has thus filed the

instant writ petition against the aforesaid orders.

5. I have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the parties, learned Asst: A.G for the

official respondents and perused the record.

6. Perusal of record transpires that a

conditional order was passed by the learned

Assistant Commissioner on 28.05.2021 with the

Bakhi Sher Ali/Steno* {S.B.) Hon’ble Mr, Justice Dr. Khurshid Iqbal

direction to open the path in dispute and appear
before him and either show cause or claim jury,
failing which further legal action will be taken
against them. Thereafter, the petitioners
continuously appeared before the learned AAC
but they did not deny the existence of the path in
dispute. It was on 02.12.2021, about 07 months
after the conditional order that they submitted an
application for dismissal of the complaint. While
they denied the existence of the path in their
application, their counsel stated before the learned
AAC that they have not blocked the: path in
dispute and further that if it is found they would
have no objection on its removal. The arguments
of the learned counsel for the petitioners that the
petitioners were summoned several times and
their evidence was not recorded, is not tenable.
The reason is that w/s.139-A, Cr.P.C, the
petitioners were bound to have denied the
existence of the disputed path at the earliest.
Had they done so, the relevant procedure as laid
down in Section 137, Cr.P.C would have been
adopted by recording evidence in the manner
as provided in section XX, Cr.P.C. Since,

the petitioners failed to discharge their burden,

Bakht Sher Ati/Steno* (S.B.) Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Dr. Khurshid Iqbal

the learned trial Court, thus made the conditional
order as absolute vide the impugned order passed

on 02.12.2021 under Section 137(3), Cr.P.C.

7. Learned counsel for the petitioner
submitted that in fact no show-cause notice was
issued to the petitioner by the learned Assistant
Commissioner. He maintained that rather the
petitioner kept appearing before the Court. He
relied on the case of Ghulam _Mustafa_v.
Muhammad _Ismail_and 2 others, reported as
1992 MLD _67 [Azad Jammu_and_ Kashmir].
It was held therein that it was necessary for the
Magistrate to have held an inquiry into the denial

of public right and given conclusive findings

thereto.

8. As discussed above in the case in
hand, the complaint was lodged on 18.05.2021.
Though a conditional order u/s.133, Cr.P.C should
have been issued on the same day, however,
the learned Assistant Commissioner forwarded
it to the SHO of Police Station concerned for

action as per law. On 28.05.2021, a conditional

order was passed, a copy of which was placed

Bakht Sher Ali/Steno* {S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Dr. Khurshid Iqbal

6
on the record by the complainant party vide C.M
No.1544-M of 2022. It is, thus, clear that a
show-cause notice as issued, to which, the
petitioner did not respond at all. It has been held
in numbers of cases that the passing of an order
ws. 133, Cr.P.C itself is sufficient to be considered

as show-cause notice. Reference may be made to

the case of Faiz Muhammad v. Civil Judge and
Judicial Magistrate and 2 others, reported as

2007 _YLR_ 256 _ {Sindh (Hyderabad _Bench)].

It is held:

“10. I am not inclined to agree with the plea of
the learned counsel for the applicant that show-
cause notice was necessary to be given before
passing the conditional order. The plain reading
of the section 133 of the Code, nowhere,
requires issuance of show-cause notice before
passing a conditional order. The conditional
order itself is a show-cause notice in its nature as
it evident from jurisdiction, given by the Section
133 of the Code itself on satisfaction of
Magistrate about fulfillment of any of the siz,
given categories, The same is:
Such Magistrate may make a conditional
order requiring the person causing such
obstruction or nuisance, or carrying on such
trade or occupation, or keeping any such
goods or merchandise, or owning,
possessing or controlling such-building,
tent, structure, substance, tank, well or
excavation or owning or possessing such
animal or tree, within a time be fixed in the

order.

Bakht Sher AliSteno* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Dr. Khurshid Iqbal

Similarly, in the case of Hag Nawaz

and 2 others v. Ramzan and 6 others, reported as

PLD 1975 Peshawar 199 [Peshawar High Court],
it is held:

“[...] the requirement of an order, which a
Magistrate is required to make under section 133,
Cx.P.C, would appear to be that first he must apply
his mind to the complaint/information laid before
him and if he is satisfied that a case has been made
out for the exercise of his jurisdiction, he should
then issue a notice to respondent to show cause on a
specified date why he should not be made to undo
the public nuisance. Now an order of this nature
would be a conditional ordet within the meaning of
section 133, Cr.P.C. for if respondent does not
appear in the proceedings or else has not been able
to show cause against the order, all that the
Magistrate would then do is to make his order
absolute to carry out which would then be the
obligation of respondent failing which it can be
executed by the Magistrate himself. [...]”

In the above referred case, it was
further held that if the order in question was
defective in some measure, it could have been
cured u/s. 537, Cr.P.C. It means that the
non-issuance of conditional order on a day the

complaint was filed was a curable irregularity.

9. In the case of Fayyaz Hussain v. The

State and 4 others, reported as 2015 YLR 194
[Lahore], in which, there was a similar complaint
in respect of a public thoroughfare and a civil suit

was also filed for declaration and permanent

Bakht Sher Ali/Steno* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr, Justice Dr. Khurshid Iqbal

injunction, while the complaint was dismissed,
and a criminal revision petition filed was also
dismissed by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge and it was held that the revisional Court
having passed a final order, the same could not be
interfered by the High Court under Article 199 of
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan,

1973. The relevant portion is reads as under:

“4, Tt is ell established that findings of the revisional
court of competent jurisdiction cannot be assailed
by invoking the constitutional jurisdiction of this
Court under Article 199 of the constitution of
Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973, therefore,
instant writ petition is not maintainable against the
order passed by the learned additional Sessions
Judge in criminal revision petition. Reliance is made
upon, (i) Badaruddin v, Mehr Abmad Raza,
Additional Sessions Judge Jhang and 6 others (PLD
1993 SC 399) and (ii) Muhammad Fiaz Khan v.
Ajmer Khan and another (2010 SCMR 105). It
may be expedient to reproduced the relevant extract
from the case of Badrauddin (supra), which reads
below:

al 7. Second ground given by the High Court is
that writ will not lie if final order is passed by
the Revisional Court. There is no dispute about
the fact that powers of the High Court for
exercise of revisional jurisdiction under section
439, CrP.C. are wider in scope than powers in
the writ jurisdiction. By amendment in the law
now Sessions Court and High Court have
concurrent revisional jurisdiction which is
allowed in the normal course to be exercised
first by lower forum but that does not decrease
the scope of jurisdiction as mentioned above. In
such circumstances it is said that if there is
finding by the Court of competent jurisdiction
on the revisional side then it has attained
finality. On the same question writ petition
would be non-maintainable because otherwise it
would amount to allowing question finally

Bakhe Sher Ali/Steno* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Dr. Khurshid Iqbal

decided in one set of forums to be agitated
afresh in another set of forums and that way
there will be no end to the finality. In support
of the proposition reference can be made to the
cases of Abdul Rehman Bajwa v. Sultan and
others (PLD 198I Supreme Court 522) and
Javaid Iqbal v. Muhammad Din and another
(1990 SCMR 1309).”

10. In the light of above conclusion,
the learned counsel for the petitioner failed to
make out a case for interference by this Court
under article 199 of the Constitution read with

section 561-A, Cr.P.C.

11. Resultantly, the instant writ petition

being bereft of merits, stands dismissed.
