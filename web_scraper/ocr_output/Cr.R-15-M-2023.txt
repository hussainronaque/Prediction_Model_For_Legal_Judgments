JUDGMENT

Dr. Khurshid Iqbal, J.-

1. The instant revision petition u/s. 439-A,
Cr.P.C, is directed against the order of Additional Sessions
Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi, Dir Lower
at Chakdara, passed on 10.02.2023, by which,
an application of the petitioners for summoning of Gul
Rehman son of Khaista Rehman and Said Rahman son of

Ali Rehman as defence witnesses, was dismissed.

2. Facts succinctly are that the petitioners are
facing trial in the case FIR # 366 of 11.09.2020 u/ss.
302/324/337-F(vi/34, PPC, registered at Police Station
Chakdara, District Dir Lower, before the Court of
Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi, Dir Lower, at
Chakdara. At the last stage of the case, proceedings before
the final arguments, the petitioners-accused submitted an
application for summoning and recording statements of the
aforementioned two persons as defence evidence, which
application was dismissed vide impugned order.

3. The petitioners have now called into question

the above-referred impugned order before this Court
through the instant criminal revision petition.

4. Arguments of counsel for the petitioners,
Asst: A.G, for the State and counsel for the respondent
No.2/complainant, heard. Record gone through.

5. Admittedly, both the witnesses, namely, Gul
Rahman s/o Khaista Khan and Said Rahman s/o Ali
Rahman have been shown as the eye witnesses of the
occurrence. They were shown as witnesses of the
prosecution in the final report (challan). The prosecution
has abandoned them on 22.08.2022 for the reason that they
are strangers and they have been
won over by the petitioner/accused. Although the
petitioners/accused in their statements, recorded w/s.342,
CrP.C on = 25.10.2022 and on 09.01.2023,
didn’t prefer to avail the opportunity of producing evidence
in defence. However, in the latter statements they availed
the opportunity of recording statements on oath. The latter
statement has been recorded after alteration in the charge
against them on 12.12.2022. Perusal of the altered charge
would show that when asked about the production of
evidence in defence, they replied in the negative but added
that they may
do so if it is deemed necessary after the closing of the
prosecution evidence. Learned Counsel for the petitioners
stated that the statements of the petitioners on oath have
not been recorded till date. The A.A.G and counsel for the
private respondent/complainant didn’t controvert the
argument.

6. Counsel for the complainant party stated that
the witnesses concerned have recorded their statements
ws.164, Cr.P.C during the investigation. He added that
since they have been won over, therefore, the
petitioners/accused intend to create a diverse impact on the
evidence of the prosecution. This Court would restrain
from making any comment in this regard, lest, it may
prejudice either party. Two significance aspects of the
matter in hand are that; firstly, both the witnesses have
been shown in the FIR as the eye witnesses of the
occurrence. This being so, perhaps the trial Court could
have summoned them as CWs for the just decision of the
case. Secondly, though the prosecution closed its case, the
trial Court has yet to examine the petitioners/accused on
Oath u/s.340(2), Cr.P.C. and to hear the arguments of the
parties before announcing the judgment.

7. Section 540, Cr.P.C, which relates to the
power of the Court to summon material witness or examine
the person present before it. The provision has two parts.
The first part vests in the Court the discretionary power to
summon anyone as a witness or examine any person who is
present though was not summoned as a witness. The
second part which is mandatory in nature, makes it
obligatory on the part of a Court to summon and examine
or recall and reexamine any such person if his evidence
appears to be essential for the just decision of the case.

8. As the witnesses concerned have been shown
in the FIR as the eye witnesses of the occurrence, therefore,
their evidence appears to be essential for the just decision
of the case. It is a settled legal principle that a witness may
be examined if his/her evidence is necessary for the just
decision of the case. In Nawabzada Shah Zain Bugti and
others v. The State, (PLD 2013 SC 160), the Supreme
Court has observed that the law laid down in section 540,
Cr.P.C., not only enables but in certain situations, makes it
obligatory on Court to summon witnesses who couldn’t
otherwise be brought before the Court for evidence. The
Court has relied on AJR 2007 SC 3029, in which, the object
of section 311 of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code (an
analogous provision) was discussed as under:

“9. The Court cannot summarily
dismiss an application for additional
evidence in terms of section 540
Cr.P.C. by merely holding that either
the said witness was not mentioned in
the challan or that it was belated

application or that it may fill up

lacunas in prosecution case, unless the
totality of material placed before it is

considered to find out whether
examination of the said witness is
essential for a just decision of the case.
While dilating on the purpose of an
analogous provision in Indian
Criminal Procedure Code (Section
311), the Supreme Court of India in
Iddar and others v. Aabida and
another (AIR 2007 SC 3029) observed

as follows:
Bakht Sher Ali Khan/Steno* (3.8) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE Br. KHURSHID JOBAL
“The object underlying section
311 of the Code is that there may
not be failure of justice on
account of mistake of either
party in bringing the valuable
evidence on record or leaving
ambiguity in the statements of
the witnesses examined from
either side. The determinative
factor is whether it is essential to

the just decision of the case. The
section is not limited only for the
benefit of the accused, and it will
not_be an improper exercise of
the powers of the Court to
summon _a_witness_under_the
Section merely because the
evidence supports the case for the

prosecution and not that of the
accused. The section is a general

section which applies to all
proceedings, enquiries and trial
under the Code and empowers
Magistrate to issue summons to
any witness at any stage of such
proceedings, trial or enquiry. In
section 311 the — significant
expression that occurs is “at any

stage of inquiry or trial or other

proceeding under this Code”. It
is, however, to be borne in mind

that whereas the section confers
a very wide power on the
Court on summoning witnesses,
the discretion conferred is to be
exercised judiciously, as the
wider the power the greater is the
necessary for application of
judicial mind.” (underlining
supplied)

9. Our Supreme Court has further observed in
the above case that while trying a case, a court shall bear in
mind that it has to discover the truth in a bid to pass a
judgment to serve the purpose of justice. It has further

Bakht Sher Ali KhanfSteno* @.8) KON‘SLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID JOBAL

observed that in order to discern the truth, which relevant
extract is as follows:

“10. [...] the Court even without any
formal application from prosecution

or accused, can Summon any person as
witness or examine any person in
attendance though not summoned as a
witness or recall and re-examine any
person already examined. In Ansar
Mehmood yv. Abdul Khaliq (2011
SCMR 713), the judgment of the High
Court was reversed and that of the
trial Court restored which had
allowed examination of additional
evidence in terms of section 540,
Cr.P.C. [...]”

Reference may be made to the cases Shair Ali Shah y. the
State_through Advocate General Muzaffarabad and 4
others (2018 YLR 1777 Shariat Court AJ&K) and (2001
SCMR 308) [Supreme Court of Pakistan].

10. The matter in law is also worth consideration
from the perspective of Section 265(f) Cr.P.C., which
provides that the Court shall summon the persons whom
the prosecution or the complainant state to have been
acquainted with the facts of the case and unable to give
evidence. It further provides that the court may refuse to
summon such person if it is vexatious, or tend to cause
delay or defeat the ends of justice. It also provides that at
the close of the prosecution evidence, if the accused wants
to adduce evidence, the court shall allow him such
opportunity to produce evidence in defence. For this
purpose, the provision further adds that the court shall issue
process for compelling the attendance of witnesses the
accused wants to produce in defence. However, the court
may refuse if it appears to be vexatious or aimed it causing
delay in the decision of a case. It needs no emphasis that
the matter in hand has a material bearing on the right to a
fair trial of the petitioners/accused which is a
constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights under
Art.10(A) of the Constitution. Reference may be made to
Muhammad Tanveer v. The State and others (2020 MLD
62) [Multan Bench] in which section 265(f), Cr.P.C and
Art. 10(A) of the Constitution have been discussed.

11. Learned counsel for the complainant/
respondent relied on 2004 YLR 213 (Lahore). A close
reading of this judgment would show that it is not
applicable in the facts and circumstances of the case. The
reason is that the complainant sought to abandon certain
witnesses which the court did not allow. The learned
counsel also relied on 2003 YLR 2010 (Lahore). In this
case, an application was moved by the complainant in a
case for summoning of Naib Tehsildar as a court witness.
The court observed that earlier an application for re-
summoning of Patwari was moved which was dismissed.
The plea of summoning of Naib Tehsildar as a court
witness at a belated stage was thus seen as an effort to
frustrate the defence version developed in cross
examination. This ruling is also not applicable in the
present circumstances. In the instant case, the examination
of the two witnesses does not appear to be vexatious, this
being already shown as eye witnesses of the occurrence.
Moreover, such examination is not likely to cause delay in
the conclusion of the trial.

12. As sequel to the above discussion,
the instant criminal revision petition is allowed and
the impugned order dated 10.02.2023 is set aside. The trial
Court is directed to call the aforesaid witnesses, record
their statements as CWs, afford full opportunity of cross
examining them, both, by the prosecution
as well as the defence counsel and conclude the trial
as soon as possible.
