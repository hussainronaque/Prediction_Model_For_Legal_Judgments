ORDER

Jamal Khan Mandokhail, J.- Brief facts of the case are that

* an FIR No. 51/2000 dated 02.03.2000 was registered by one Haji
Muhammad Ishaq, (“complainant”) under sections 302, 201, 109

and 34 Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) at Police Station, Samundri,

District Faisalabad against the appellant and three unknown

persons. It is alleged that the appellant made firing upon Farman

Ali who fell down and thereafter, the other co-accused also made

firing as a result ninerviat Farman Ali succumbed to his injuries.

The appellant absconded whereas, out of the unknown persons,

oné Muhammad Shafiq was arrested. He faced trial and was

acquitted of the charge by the Trial Court.

2. The appellant was subsequently arrested on 25 May 2006.

During the investigation, upon a disclosure of the appellant, a 30.
bore pistol allegedly used in the commission of the offence was

recovered on his pointation. After completion of the investigation,

3 2
Crl.A.No. .57 of 2019 etc

report under section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.PC)
was submitted before the Court of Additional Sessions Judge,
Faisalabad (Trial Court). After conclusion of the trial, the appellant
was convicted under section 302(b) PPC and was sentenced him to
death by the Trial Court, vide judgment dated 26.04.2008. An
appeal filed by the appellant was dismissed by the High Court,
maintaining the judgment of the Trial Court and answered the
Murder Reference in affirmative through the impugned judgment.
Feeling aggrieved, a petition for leave to appeal was filed, wherein

leave was granted.

3. Arguments heard and have perused the record. In order to

prove its case, out of the two eye-witnesses, the prosecution has

-produced only Muhammad Asghar, who recorded his statement

before the Trial Court as PW-9 whereas, the other eye-witness,
namely Muhammad Idrees was given up. Similarly, the.
complainant of the case could not be examined, because of his
murder. Investigating Officer (IO) recorded his statement before the
Trial Court as PW-10 and stated that on 24 March 2000, he was
present at Ryness Chowk, Chak No. 466/GB Samundri, where the
complainant appeared and informed him about the incident. His
statement was reduced into writing, which was read over and
explained te him, who signed it. The 10 contended that the said
written complaint was sent to the police station through Safdar Ali,
Constable for registration of a formal FIR, EX-PG, and thereafter
he went to the place of the occurrence. The said Safdar Ali was not
produced before the Trial Court to prove the contention of the IO.
On the other hand, PW-9 the sole eye-witness stated that after the ~
occurrence, the police arrived at the spot and recorded his

statement. The witness did not mention the departure of the

Crl.A No, .57 of 2019 etc %
complainant from the place of the occurrence, his meeting with the
IO at bypass. Because of non-appearance of the complainant for
the reason mentioned above before the Trial Court, the statement
of the IO with regard to appearance of the complainant before him
at bypass Chowk, recording his statement, signing it as a
complaint and registration of the FIR, has no corroboration. If for
the sake of arguments, it is believed that the FIR was registered on
the basis of the complaint, it was admittedly lodged after a
considerable delay, without an explanation in this behalf. Under
such circumstances, the motive assigned by the complainant to
the appellant and his intention described in the FIR has not been

established.

4. According to the eye-witness and as per the FIR, the

appellant made four firing shots upon the person of the deceased
who fell down, whereafter, the other three unknown accused also
made firing upon the deceased. Be that as it had: it is not clear
that out of the four shots fired by the appellant, how many bullets
hit the deceased. Similarly, it is also not explained that how many
bullets were fired by each of the three accused and how many of
them had hit the deceased. The Medical Officer who appeared as
PW-7, described that in all, the deceased received six injuries out
of which, injury No. 1 was a result of a blunt weapon, whilst, rest
of the five injuries were a result of fire arms weapon. Admittedly,
no pve was recovered from the place ‘of the occurrence,
therefore, in the given circumstances, it cannot be said with
certainty that out of all the four assailants, whose fire shots
resulted into fatal injury(s), causing death of the deceased. The
statement of the doctor that injury No. 1 was a result of blunt

weapon, shows that there might have been a scuffle between the

a

: 4
Crl.A.No. .57 of 2019 etc

deceased and the accused resulting into retaliation and outrage.
The prosecution’s case rests only upon the sole statement of the
eye-witness, but he did not disclose that the act done by the
appellant and the three accused persons was preplanned to

commit murder.

5. As far as recovery of the pistol on the pointation of the
accused is concerned, no forensic report was obtained, because of
the fact that no empty was recovered from the place of the
occurrence. The prosecution has failed to prove that the pistol
recovered on the pointation of the appellant was actually the same,
which he used in the commission of the offence, therefore, the

High Court has rightly disbelieved the recovery. Facts and

- circumstances of the case, lead us to a conclusion that the

occurrence had taken place all of a sudden without there being any

proof of premeditation. It was a free fight, without proof of the
motive alleged in the FIR. On the basis of the available material, it
is the prosecution’s case that all the accused committed firing
upon the deceased. Under such circumstances, the role of the
appellant cannot be differentiated from that of the others. One of
the co-accused, has already been aoanieed by the Trial Court on
the same set of evidence. It would, therefore, not be safe to single
out the appellant and hold him alone responsible for the
commission of the offence. However, the prosecution has
succeeded in storing its case against the appellant under section
302(b) read with section 34, PPC for the act done by him along
with the co-accused. In such view of the matter, awarding capital
punishment to the appellant was unjustified. On the basis of the
mitigating circumstances discussed herein above, the fora below

were required to exercise their discretion by awarding lesser

‘ t
B

Cri.A No. .57 of 2019 etc

punishment as provided by section 302(2), PPC, put they did not

exercise their jurisdiction.

6. Even otherwise, the appellant was arrested in the month of
May 2006 and it took two years to complete his trial. The appeal
filed before the High Court in the year 2008 remained pending for
more than five years till its dismissal. The pe’ ition for leave to
appeal filed against the impugned judgment before this Court in
the year 2013 was fixed for hearing for the first time on 28th
January 2019, when leave was granted. Thereafter, the case came
up for hearing on 15% November 2021 and lastly on 19% March
2024 when the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties
_ were heard. The appellant remained in prison since May 2006 and
* was incarcerated in death cell w.e.f. 2013 till date, almost for more
than eleven years. Section 302(b), PPC provides a punishment for
idati or imprisonment for life, The total period of detention of the
appellant in prison is about 18 years, without earning a single-day
‘of remission, because of awarding death sentence. If remissions
are counted towards his sentence, the appellant has served almost
an imprisonment for life. The delay in conclusion of judicial
proceedings was on account of the system in vogue and for no fault
of the appellant. After serving a sentence for life, including eleven
years detention in death cell, executing his death penalty at this
stage would not only be harsh, but would also be contrary to the
principle of life expectancy!. Under such circumstances, the
appellant cannot be sentenced twice for one and the same offence,
hence punishment for death awarded to the appellant cannot

sustain.2

JUDGMENT

Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, J:-_I have had the
privilege of going through the judgment (“majority jadement
authored by my learned Colleague Mr. Jamal Khan Mandokhail, J.
With great respect, I do not find myself in agreement to it for the

facts and reasons mentioned herein.
Be Facts in the brief are that an FIR No.51/2000 dated
02.03.2000 was registered by Muhammad Ishaq (complainant)
under section 302, 201, 109 and 34 PPC against the appellant and
- 3 unknown persons at the Police Station Samundari, District
* Faisalabad. The allegations are that appellant made firing upon the
Farman Ali who fell down and thereafter the other co-accused also
mane firing and Farman Ali succumbed to injuries. In order to hide
the dead body the appellant along with other co-accused put the

dead body in the jeep and absconded. The appellant absconded

whereas out of the unknown persons one Muhammad Shafiq was .

arrested and faced trial and was acquitted of the charge.

2. . The appellant was arrested on 25.05.2006 and after a
full-fledged trial he was convicted and sentenced to death penalty
by the Trial Court. The death sentence was subsequently
confirmed by the High Court, and his appeal against the éonviction
was dismissed.

3. While the majority judgment acknowledges that the
prosecution successfully proved its case against the appellant, it
has, in consideration of the following mitigating circumstances,
altered the death sentence to life imprisonment:-

i) That FIR was lodged after a considerable delay.
nD rs
,

Dissent in Cr. Appeal No.S7/2019 -2-

ii) That it remains uncertain how many shots were fired by
each of the four assailants, and it is unclear whose shot
caused the deaths of the victims.

iii) That the incident occurred spontaneously, with no
evidence of premeditation, and it was deemed a free fight
without any discernible motive.

iv) That co-accused Muhammad Shafiq has ‘ites acquitted.

v) That there were considerable delays in the conclusion of
trial and hearing of appeal consequently the appellant

remained in custody w.e.f. May 2006 till date.

“Tfind myself unable to concur with any of these considerations.

4. The incident in the present case occurred on
02.03.2000 at 03:30 p.m. The complainant, Haji Muhammad Ishaq
(who was murdered on 10.05.2002 by the present appellant),

promptly reported the matter at 4:10 p.m., and a formal FIR was

* registered shortly after, at 4:30 p.m at P.S City Samundari, District

Faisalabad. Considering the distance between police station and

place of occurrence it can safely be concluded that there was no

delay in the registration of the FIR.

5. In the present case, the complainant, Muhammad
Ishaq (since dead), along with Siharemad Asghar (PW-9) and
Muhammad Idrees (given up PW because of relocating abroad),
were the primary eye-witnesses. However, the complainant
Muhammad Ishaq and his son Mushtaq Ahmed were subsequently
murdered by the appellant and Muhammad Idress was given up as
PW because he was living abroad/outside the Pakistan.

6. The relevant portion of the ocular account furnished

by Muhammad Asghar (PW-9) is reproduced hereinbelow:-
Dissent in CrLAppeal No.57/2019 -3-

“Stated that about 7% years back, at about 3,30 p.m, I
alongwith Muhammad Ishaq, Muhammad Idrees and
Farman Ali was present in the Bazar in front of outer door
of the house of Baoo Arian. A Jeep white in colour No.2007
Karachi came from the eastern side. Four persons including.
accused Ghulam Rasool present in the Court and one
Shafique alighted from the jeep. Ghulam Rasool was armed
with pistol and the other three accused had guns, Accused
Ghulam Rasool made Lalkara to Farman to the effect that
he would be taught a lesson for pursuing the cases and
made four fire shots with his pistol, upon the person of
Farman, which landed on different parts of his -body.
Farman fell down and succumbed to the Injuries. The other
accused continued firing with their weapons. The accused
persons put the dead body of Farman In their jeep and
went towards Tandlianwala side. The occurrence was
witnessed by me as well as Muhammad Idrees and
Muhammad Ishag. The police arrived at the spot and
recorded my statement. After three days of the occurrence,
the dead body of Farman was found at SAIM NALA Chak
No.136/G.B. Ishaq PW was lateron murdered by accused
Ghulam Rasool after two years and 2.1/2 months
alongwith his son Mushtag. (under objection).”

Muhammad Asghar (PW-9), being a resident of the same
locality, is a natural eye-witness to the occurrence, as he lived in
close proximity to the place of incident. Muhammad Asghar (PW-9)
was subjected to extensive cross-examination; however, nothing
emerged during this process that could favor the appellant. His
testimony is direct, consistent, and inspires confidence
7. . The ocular account was corroborated by the medical
evidence furnished by the Dr. Sadiq Ali (PW-7) who conducted the
postmortem examination on the dead body of Farman Ali. At this
juncture it is pertinent to highlight that after mercilessly shooting
Farman Ali to death, appellant put the dead body in jeep and
absconded towards Tandlianwala. The dead body of the deceased
was found after three days from the Saim Nala Chak No. 136/G.B.
8, - Dr. Sadiq Ali (PW-7), after conducting the post mortem
examination and tabled following injuries on the dead body:-

1. A lacerated wound 4cm x 1 cm bone deep on the left

side of forehead.

2. A firearm wound of entry about 2em x 1 cm on the right
cheek, 2 cm below the right eye, no blackening and
scorching was seen.

Dissent in CrLAppeal No.57/2019 -4-

Wound of exit. A lacerated wound 3cm x 2 cm, margins
were everted on the left cheek, 4 cm below the left eye.

3. A firearm wound of entry 2cm x 1 cm oval in shape on
the right cheek, 1 cm front of right ear, no blackening or
scorching was seen.

Wound of exit. A lacerated wound 4cm x 5 cm, on the
back of head, everted margin, 11 cm back to the right ear.

4. A firearm wound of entry 2cm x 2 cm on the outer-
surface of left upper arm, no blackening, bone under lying
of the injury was fracture.

Wound of exit. A lacerated wound 3cm x 2cm margins
everted on the inner side of left upper arm.

5. A firearm wound of entry 3 cm x 2 cm on left of front
chest In the line of anterior axillary fold, 20 cm below the
top of left shoulder, no blackening and scorching was
seen,

Wound of exit. A lacerated wound 4 cm x 2 cm on the
back of abdomen on the right side, about 20 cm below the
right shoulder bone.

6. Firearm wound of entry 3 cm x 2 cm on the left front of
abdomen, in the mid axillary line, 10 cm below the left
. nipple, no blackening was seen. :

: Wound of exit. Lacerated wound 4 cm x 3 cm, margins
A et “everted In the apigestrium.”

Based on the post-mortem report following opinion was
rendered by the Dr. Sadiq Ali (PW-7):-
” Opinion:
By doing external as well as internal post mortem
examination, the PW-7 was of the opinion that all the
injuries were ante mortem. Injury No.1 was inflicted by
blunt weapon, while other injuries were inflicted by
firearm weapon. Injury Nos.2, 3, 5 and 6 were dangerous
and grievous in nature. In ordinary course above

mentioned four injuries could cause death individually
. and collectively. Injuries No.1 and 4 were simple.

Thus, ocular account furnished by the eye-witness stands

fully corroborated by the medical evidence.

9. Perusal of the evidence further demonstrates that
incident in the present case cannot be characterized as a free fight
or unpremeditated murder because firstly Farman Ali (deceased)
was shot to death, then his dead body was thrown in a nala.
Moreover, when the FIR in the present case was registered by

complainant Muhammad Ishaq, the appellant not only murdered
Dissent in CrLAppeal No.57/2019 ~5-

him in a brutal and gruesome manner but also assassinated son
Mushtaq Ali in the same incident.
10. Regarding the question of whether the prosecution's
inability to establish a motive may be considered a mitigating
factor justifying a reduction of the death penalty to life
imprisonment, it is now firmly established in the law that the
absence of motive, failure to prove motive, or a motive that remains
unclear or not alleged does not constitute a mitigating
circumstance.

=o AT " Similar view was taken by the Supreme Court in case

Of Moazam Shah Vs Mohsin Shah (PLD 2001 SC 458) wherein it

was ruled that:-

* “Motive by itself neither proves nor disproves. any
_ assertion conclusively. Motive does help in determining
the guilt of a person particularly of investigation, but it
remains invisible to all in many cases except the
offenders. When there is clear proof that person has
committed the crime, motive or previous ill will becomes
immaterial and is not necessary to sustain a conviction."

Moreover, in the case of Ghalib Hussain vs Muhammad Arif (2002
SCMR 29) this view was affirmed and held that:-

"In this context it has heen held time and again by this
Court that motive by itself neither proves nor disproves
any assertion conclusively."
A similar issue arose in the case of Nazakat v. Hazrat Jamal and

another (PLD 2007 SC 453), where the Supreme Court, after

considering the established legal principles on this matter,

observed that:
13, At the very outset, it is pertinent to-note that before

H i ispute th i
but confi i G to the quan’ of si

only. The main reasons which weighed with the learned
Division Bench of the High Court in reducing the sentence
to imprisonment for life was that neither the motive was
established by the prosecution nor it was known as to
what happened just before the incident which remained
ouded in mystery. W. i is bei

beyond any shadow of doubt.

Reference can be made to the case of Muhammad Akbar
and another v. The State PLD 2004 SC 44, wherein it was.
held by this Court that when prosecution proves its case
through reliable and trustworthy evidence beyond any
doubt inadequacy or weakness of motive or where motive
was alleged but not proved, would become immaterial and
would not adversely affect prosecution case and normal
penalty of death can be imposed on the assailants if there
were no mitigating or extenuating circumstances for lesser
penalty. It has also been held in this case that "motive
shrouded in mystery" by itself is not a mitigating
circumstance for awarding lesser sentence and this theory
has, been discarded. In the case of Muhammad Amin alias
Irfan and another v. The State 2004 SCMR 1676 also this
Court while discarding the motive held that lack of motive
or weakness thereof is immaterial to withhold the normal
penalty of death in murder cases when trustworthy
evidence had squarely brought home the guilt against the
accused beyond any doubt.”

- In the case of Muhammad Latif v, The State (PLD 2008 SC 503) it
has been affirmed that:-

“Therefore, the old rule of failure of prosecution to prove

the motive, took the change through the judgments of the

superior courts with the passage of time. Now-a-days.

ission of the a
12. _ Thus, law is clear on this matter that the death
penalty cannot be withheld solely because the prosecution fails to
allege or establish a motive. The underlying reason behind this is
that true motive for an offence is typically known only to the
accused, rather than to the complainant, informant, or any other
witnesses, unless it is explicitly or implicitly conveyed. Witnesses
may describe the actions of accused during the commission of the
offence. Others may try to infer or label the motive based on their
observations or the information available to them, but the actual
motive remains solely with the accused.

13. As far as acquittal of the Muhammad Shafiq (co-
accused) is concerned, it is pertinent to highlight that his case is

entirely distinguishable from the appellant. Muhammad Shafiq was
Dissent in Crl. Appeal No.57/2019 -7-

neither specifically named in the FIR nor any specific injuries were
attributed to him, whereas the appellant was _ specifically
nominated and role of inflicting firearm injuries was assigned to
him. The role assigned to Muhammad Shafiq was not
substantiated by the medina! evidence, in contrast to the
appellant’s role, which is fully supported by such evidence.
Additionally, no motive was established against Muhammad
Shafiq, whereas a specific motive was alleged in relation to the
appellant. Consequently, as Muhammad Shafiq’s case is
fundamentally distinct from that of the appellant, his acquittal

‘holds no bearing on the appellant’s case.

14. At this juncture, it is important to note that present
appellant ‘committed murder of Muhammad Ishaq, the
complainant of present case and his son Mushtaq Ahmed on
10.05.2002. Consequently, FIR No. 127, dated 10.05.2002, was
registered at the same police station. Following a full-fledged trial
in that case (FIR No. 127, dated 10.05.2002), the appellant was
convicted and sentenced to death by the trial court. The death
sentence awarded to the appellant was upheld and confirmed by
the High Court. The appellant’s appeal against the said decision of
High Court (Cri. Appeal No. 56/2019) has also been consolidated
with this appeal. We cannot lose sight of the fact that appellant is
a habitual criminal/murderer. He firstly murdered Farman Ali
(deceased in present case) thereafter he killed Muhammad Ishaq
who was pursuing the case of Farman Ali. Not only this, but
appellant also went further to murder the son of the complainant
Muhammad Ishaq namely Mushtaq Ahmed. Thus,: actions of

appellant reveal a complete disregard for human life and an effort

Dissent in CrLAppeal No.57/2019 -8-

to prevent any legal repercussions by silencing individuals who are

critical to the prosecution.

15. An important question that needs determination is
that whether a delay in trial or deciding the appeal in the cases of
death sentence constitutes a mitigating circumstance to award a
lesser punishment. A similar question came up before the Supreme
Court of Pakistan in the case of Muhammad Hassan vs. The State

(1973 SCMR 344) wherein it has been observed that:-

“Sh. Shaukat Ali, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of
the petitioner has not disputed before us the conviction of
the petitioner for the murder of the two girls. He has,
however, contended that in the facts and circumstances of
the case the petitioner should not have been awarded the
. extreme penalty of law, namely, death. He has contended
in the first instance, that having regard to the fact that a
long time had elapsed between the occurrence and the
sentence of death passed upon the petitioner, the High
Court should not have confirmed the death sentence. He
has submitted that the occurrence took place on the 3rd
of November 1969, and the petitioner was convicted and
sentenced to death on the 19th of May 1971, by the trial
Court and his death sentence was confirmed by the High
Court on the 30th of September 1972. In support of this
contention he has drawn our attention to Chapter 24-B,
Rule 6 of the Rules and Orders of the High Court of
Judicature at Lahore, Vol. III, which says that the High
Court requires explanations to be furnished in monthly
Sessions Statements of any cases pending over two

li f Hi
that mere delay in the disposal of a death sentence case
would entitle the condemned person to automatically
in commutati f his death se: 6.”

_ Moreover in the case of Samano v. The State (1973 SCMR 162) it

was ruled that:-

“] am, therefore, of the view that both the appellants have
been rightly convicted and no distinction can be made
. between the two. As regards the sentence, it is true that
the incident took place as long ago as November 1954, but
the mere length of time taken in concluding the trial and
in deciding the appeals filed by the appellants would not
by itself constitute an extenuating circumstance justifying
the imposition of the lesser penalty. The appellants acted
¢
:

Dissent in Crl.Appeal No.57/2019 -9-

in a cruel and cold-blooded manner by allowing
themselves to be hired as assassins. They do not deserve
any leniency in the matter of punishment. I would,
therefore, maintain their sentences and dismiss both the,
appeals.”

Similar view was also taken in the case of Shah Muhammad v. The

State (PLD 1973 SC 332) as reproduced below:-

* In this view of the matter, we have, after giving our
anxious consideration to all the facts and circumstances
of the case and the able arguments advanced on behalf of
the appellant, come to the conclusion that this appeal
must fail and accordingly dismiss it. The convictions and
sentences of the appellant are upheld. The fact that more
\than 4 1/2 years have elapsed since his conviction is not
a circumstance, which we can take into consideration. If
the delay in the execution of the sentence can by itself be

. @ sufficient ground for commutation then the appellant
can approach the Executive. authorities for such
commutation; but, so far as this Court is concerned, it
cannot, in the facts and circumstances of this case,
recommend any such action.”

.In the case of Bakshish Elahi v. The State (1977 SCMR 389) it was

noted that:-

“The Legislature has conferred very wide discretion on the
Courts in the matter of sentences under the Penal Code,
but as the discretion has to be exercised judicially, the
Courts would be entitled to take into account the law and
order situation, if the object of punishment or one of the
objects of punishment be to deter the commission of.
further crimes. Now, I do not see how there can be any
doubt about this question. Salmond observes in his book
on Jurisprudence (Tenth Edition) at page 111
“Punishment is before all things deterrent, and the chief
end of the law of crime is to make the-evil doer an example
and a warning to all that are likeminded with him" would
agree with this passage, and the learned Single Judge
yeas justified in holding that a severer sentence was
necessary on account of the increase of crime, provided of
course culpable homicides of the type under consideration
have increased, as held by the learned Single Judge.”

16. In the present case, the prosecution clearly
demonstrated that the appellant, along with others, was involved
in a deliberate and premeditated murder. Because of the brutality
and dangerousness of the act, it is necessary to impose the strict
punishment i.e. capital punishment in order to deliver justice and
protect society. Mitigating the punishment based on the long trial
or the time the appellant spent in custody does not change the

severity of the crime. While it is unfortunate the appellant was in
ro) ¢€
‘

Dissent in Crl.Appeal No.S7/2019 si
10-

custody for a long time due to delays in the trial and hearing of
appeal that does not justify leniency. The length of time in custody
is a result of the legal process, not an indication that the crime was
any less serious. Given the clear evidence of the appellant's
involvement in a brutal murder, the death penalty remains the
appropriate and necessary punishment. Reducing it would
undermine the justice deserved by the victims and the severity of
the crime committed.
f U7 In light of the above discussion, I find that both the
Trial court and the High Court have thoroughly examined all
aspects of the case, appreciated the evidence, and have rightly
; imposed the death penalty as a just and appropriate sentence.
18. Consequently, this appeal is dismissed and death

penalty imposed by the learned High Court is maintained.
