2. The learned trial court, however, vide same judgment
acquitted Muhammad Munir co-accused by extending benefit
of doubt.

3. The prosecution story, in brief, was that on 26.08.2013 at
about 4.00 a.m., Imam Bakhsh appellant armed with Rifle
alongwith one unknown accused riding on motorcycle entered
into the Dera of the deceased. The appellant fired at Khalid
Hussain, deceased hitting in his abdomen, who after
sustaining fire shot fell on the ground and the appellant
alongwith his co-accused fled away from the spot.

4. After usual investigation, challan against the accused
persons was submitted in Court. The learned trial court after
observing all the pre-trial codal formalities, charge sheeted the
appellant to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be
tried.

5. The prosecution, in order to prove its case, produced as
many as ten witnesses during trial..

6. Doctor Hassan Mahmood (P.W.1) medically examined
Khalid Hussain then injured and observed following injuries
on his person:-

1. (a) A lacerated wound of size 1.5 cm x 1 cm x going

deep blindly with inverted margins present on
apigestric region KUO.

2. (b) A lacerated wound of size 2 cm x 1.5 cm going

deep blindly with inverted margins present on

Fy pnp ~_ at a distance of 2 cm from injury

The duration of injuries was between 5/6 hours. MLC

No.HM 558/2013 Ex.PC was the correct computerized copy of

the same and was signed by the (PW. 1).

7. Muhammad Nawaz A.S.I. (P.W.2) conducted partial

investigation of the case. Naseeb Ahmad SI. (P.W.3) also
‘conducted investigation.

8. Sajjad Hussain (P.W.4) identified the dead body of the

deceased. Muhammad Shahid Bashir ASI (P.W.5) was
Criminal Appeal No.76/2017
Murder Reference No.06 of 2017

witness of recovery of rifle from Muhammad Munir (acquitted

co-accused).
9. Doctor Muhammad Zahid Faroog (P.W.10) conducted
post mortem examination on the dead body of Khalid Hussain

deceased and observed following injuries on his person:

1. Wound in epigastric 1 cm below xiphisternum 2 x
2 cm with omentum coming out of the it.

2. Abdomen was tender and patient was dyspneic
right side breath sound were not audible,

3. On abdomen exploration three litters blood in
peritoneal cavity torn falctform ligament shattered
liver and 600 ml of blood in pleural cavity.

4. Injury of intrahepatic biliary channels.

The probable time between injury and death was within
two months & 21 days and the time between death and

post-mortem was about 8 to 10 hours.
In his opinion, all the infuries were ante mortem and
caused by some fire arm weapon which caused
destruction of vital organs like liver right lung leading
to hypovolemic shock and later on developed septicemia
and leads to death. Post Mortem Report No.22/2013
dated 2.12.2013 Ex.PT/1-6 was the true computerized
copy of the original. The doctor formed his opinion on
the basis of MLC notes B.V. Hospital Bahawalpur Ex.PU.
10. The prosecution while giving up Muhammad Naeem,

Muhammad Shameer PWs being won over, Irshad Hussain,
Muhammad Ramzan, Atta Muhammad, Muhammad Azam,
Fazal, Ahmad Yar, Ghulam Murtaza Constable and Allah

Rakha being unnecessary, closed its evidence.

11, The statement of the appellant under Section 342, of
The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, was recorded. He
refuted the allegations levelled against him and professed his

innocence. Responding to the question “why this case was

reqistere: inst you and why the PWs depos ai

you?,” Imam Bakhsh appellant replied as under:

“Neither I along-with any other person on motor
bike went to the place of occurrence on
26.8.2013 nor I caused any fire shot on the
person of the deceased as alleged. Neither the
injured/ the deceased was directly shifted from
the alleged place of occurrence to THQ,
Hospital, Hasilpur nor he was conscious to
make his statement as alleged by the
prosecution. Factually, the injured/the deceased
did not make any statement before Muhammad
Criminal Appeal No.76/2017 ‘
Murder Reference No.06 of 2017

Nawaz SI and his alleged statement Exh.PD is a
Jabricated document maneuvered by the I.0 on
the asking of Irshad Hussain & Sajjad Hussain
the real brothers of the deceased just in order
to falsely involve me in this case. Neither the
injured/the deceased was attended by Shameer,
Munir & Naeem Khan PWs as alleged nor they
shifted him to the THQ, Hospital Hasilpur. In
fact, the injured/ the deceased had sustained
Sire arm injuries on his person at the hands of
some un-known assailants during the odd hours
of the night and his brother Sajjad & Irshad
Sirstly shifted him from the place of occurrence
to DHQ Hospital,Vehari and thereafter they
brought him to THQ, Hospital Hasilpur and
there they maneuvered the preparation of
alleged report of doctor Exh.PA/1 and then his
alleged statement Exh.PD with the connivance
of the police. In fact, the alleged occurrence
was committed by some un-known persons and I
have got no concern with the commission of
alleged crime. We both the parties belonged to
the same locality and we are supporting rival
political groups due to said reason, I have been
involved in this case by the complainant party
on the asking of my rivals.”

The appellant neither appeared as his own witness on oath
as provided under Section 340(2) of The Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898 in disproof of the allegations levelled against
him nor produced evidence in his defence.

12, The learned trial Court vide its judgment dated
28.01.2017, held the appellant guilty, convicted and
sentenced him as mentioned and detailed above.

13. Learned counsel for the appellant argued at some
length. The crux of his arguments was that the case of
prosecution was entirely based on the statement of the
injured/the deceased, which was neither proved nor
supported by the PWs nor through the attending
circumstances, thus, the conviction awarded to the appellant
on the basis of dying declaration by the learned trial Court
cannot be sustained.

14. Learned Deputy Prosecutor General assisted by the
learned counsel for the complainant opposed this appeal
with vehemence and submitted that the occurrence was

promptly reported to police by the injured, which excluded the
Criminal Appeal No.76/2017
Murder Reference No.06 of 2017

possibility of any deliberation or consultation; that the
appellant was nominated with specific role of causing fatal
injuries to the deceased, which gets support from the medical
evidence; that the dying declaration was duly proved and

was rightly relied upon; that the appellant remained

absconder for a considerable period, another additional factor
which goes against the appellant. Added that even if the
including the recovery,
the

corroborative pieces of evidence
absconsion are excluded from consideration even then,
prosecution proved the dying declaration of the deceased,
thus, the appeal deserves dismissal.

15. We have given our anxious consideration to the
arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties
and have perused the record with their able assistance.

16. The occurrence in this case took place on 26.8.2013 at
4:00 a.m when the deceased along-with Muhammad Akram,
Jannat Bibi (mother), Nawaz Bibi(sister of Muhammad Akram)
was sleeping in their dera situated at Mauza Khairu Deh.
The deceased got up on the arrival of motorbike driven by
unknown accused having appellant as pillion rider. The
appellant raised a lalkara that the deceased would be done
to death. He was armed with a rifle and fired straight at the
deceased hitting in his abdomen. The alarm raised by the
ladies attracted Muhammad Shamsher, Naeem Khan (both
given up PWs) and Muhammad Munir (PW). The motive
behind the occurrence was old enmity between the parties.

17. At this stage, it may be mentioned that Muhammad
Shamsher and Naeem Khan (PWs) were given up being won
over, whereas, Muhammad Munir (PW) was nominated as
accused by real brother of the deceased, namely, Irshad
Hussain on 17.11.2013. However, he did not appear during
trial as a witness. So far as, Jannat Bibi and Nawaz Bibi are
concerned, they neither joined the investigation nor examined
Criminal Appeal No.76/2017
Murder Reference No.06 of 2017

at trial, thus, the case of the prosecution is entirely based on
the statement of the injured/ the deceased(Exh PD), reduced
into writing by Muhammad Nawaz ASI (PW.2). He received
the information regarding the occurrence at Batalian Adda
and reached straight at Tehsil Headquarter Hospital, Hasil
Pur. The deceased mentioned the names of the witnesses
including Muhammad Shamsher, Naeem Khan, Jannat Bibi,
Nawaz Bibi and Muhammad Munir in his statement (Exh. PD).
Their statements under section 161, Cr.P.C. were also
recorded by PW.2 who submitted written application Exh.PA
before the medical officer in order to ascertain whether the
injured was in a condition to make the statement. The medical
officer opined vide his report Exh.PA/I, that the injured was
capable to make the statement. He prepared the injury
statement Exh.PB and then he handed over the injury
statement to medical superintendent through Muhammad
Hussain constable. He then recorded statement of the injured
Exh.PD which is in his hand writing and thumb marked by
the injured. Later on, on the basis of Exh.PD dispatched
through Allah Rakha PQR, FIR was registered.

18. The only evidence available on record is the dying
declaration of the deceased and now it is to be seen if it was
proved and the conviction awarded to the appellant by the
learned trial Court on the basis of said statement can be
sustained.

19. Article 46(1) of the Qunoon-i-Shahadat, 1984 explores
the concept of dying declaration. Article 46 deals with the
cases related to that person who is dead or who cannot be
found. A dying declaration is called as “Leterm Mortem”,
which means “words said before death”. Dying declaration is
a very important documentary evidence. It is hearsay
evidence but even then it is given a lot of weightage.
Recording of dying declaration is also important and if it is
recorded properly by a proper person keeping in mind the
Criminal Appeal No.76/2017 .
Murder Reference No,06 of 2017

essential ingredients of the dying declaration, it retains its
full value. Missing any single ingredients of dying declaration
makes it suspicious and then the accused may get the
benefits of its shortcomings.

20. Dying declaration is based on maxim “Nemo monturus
praesumitur mentire” i.e. a man will not meet his maker with
a lie in his mouth. Hearsay evidences are not given any
weightage in the courts because the person who is giving
this evidence is not telling his experiences but that of another
person and who cannot be cross-examined to verify the facts.
Dying declaration is an exception to this rule because if this
evidence is not considered very purpose of the justice will be
forfeited in certain situation when there may not be any other
witness to the crime, as in this case, except the person who
has since died. Sometimes it is the best evidence in such
situations. Its admissibility is explained in Article 46(1) of The
Qunoon-i-Shahadat 1984. According to this situation, when
the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his
death, or any of the circumstances of the transaction which
resulted in his death, in cases in which the cause of that
person’s death comes into question. Such statements are
relevant whether the person who has made this was

expecting his death or not.

21. The most important point of the consideration is that the
victim was in a fit condition of mind to give the statement
when recording was started and remained in fit condition of
mind till the recording of the statement finished. Merely
stating that patient was fit will not serve the purpose. This
can be best certified by the doctor who knows best about
the condition of the patient. But even in conditions, where it
was not possible to take fitness certificate from the doctor,
dying declarations have retained their full sanctity but there
are other witnesses to testify that victim was in such a
condition of the mind, which did not prevent him from making
Criminal Appeal No.76/2017 .
Murder Reference No.06 of 2017

Statement. Medical opinion cannot wipe out the direct
testimony of the eye witness stating that the deceased was

in fit and conscious state to make dying declaration.

22. Second most important point to be considered is that it
should not be under the influence of any body or prepared by
Prompting, tutoring or imagination. Even if any one of these
points is proved then dying declaration is not considered

valid. If it becomes suspicious then it will need corroboration.

23. The dying declaration will be admissible in evidence
only when the person making statement dies and if the cause
of the person’s death comes into question. If the person who
has made a dying declaration survives, such statement will
not come within the purview of Article 46(1) of the Qunoon-i-
Shahadat 1984. Dying declaration is an exception to the
general rule of excluding the hearsay evidence. The burden of
proving the dying declaration is always on the prosecution.
Since an accused can be convicted solely on the basis of
dying declaration, the Court is expected to carefully scrutinize
the same. The dying declaration should inspire the confidence
of the Court about truthfulness of such declaration. If the
Court, after careful evaluation of the entire evidence, feels
that the same was result of either tutoring, prompting or
product of imagination, the Declaration will not be accepted.
If the contents of the very dying declaration contradicts the
core of the prosecution case, the declaration will not be the

basis for conviction.

24. There is no particular form to be employed in making
dying declaration. It can be oral, written, gestures and signs,
thumb impressions, incomplete and can also be in form of
question answer. However, there must be distinct and definite
assertions on the part of the person who makes the
statement. The declaration should be in written form in the
exact words stated by the person who made the statement.
Criminal Appcal No.76/2017 ’
Murder Reference No.06 of 2017

When a magistrate records the dying declaration then it
should be in question answer form as the magistrate will
opt to seek information rightly as in some other cases dying
declaration becomes the sole way to help in conviction of the
accused.

25. How to prove a dying declaration, we think, it is
desirable to comment on. The evidence is defined in Article
2{(c) of the Qunoon-e-Shahadat, 1984 as all statements which
the Courts permit or requires to be made before it by the
witnesses in relation to matters of fact under enquiry and all
documents produced for the inspection of the Court. The Court
is defined in Article 2(a) of the Qunoon-e-Shahadat, 1984 and
include all the judges and magistrates and all persons, except
arbitrators, legally authorized to take evidence.

26. The relevant provisions of Article 46 of Qunoon-e-
Shahadat 1984 reads as under:

“46. Cases in which statement of relevant fact by person
who_is dead or cannot be found, etc, is relevant.
Sometimes, written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a
person who is dead, or who cannot be found, or who has
become incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance
cannot be procured without an amount of delay or expense
which under the circumstances of the case appears to the
Court unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts in the

following cases:

(1) When it relates to cause of death. When the
statement is made by a person as to the cause of his
death, or as to any of the circumstances of the
transaction which resulted in his death, in cases in
which the cause of that person’s death comes into
question such statements are relevant whether the
person who made them was or was not, at the time
when they were made, under expectation of death, and
whatever may be the nature of the proceeding in which
the cause of his death comes into question.

(2) saves Sienaee
Criminal Appeal No.76/2017 m
Murder Reference No.06 of 2017

27. Article 46 says that the statements, written or verbal, of

relevant facts, made as to the cause of one’s death, are
themselves relevant facts. Article 47 of the Qunoon-e-
Shahadat says that evidence given by a witness before any
person authorized by law to take it is relevant forthe purpose
of proving the truth of the facts which it states when the
witness is dead, or cannot be found.

28. Now, such statements must, of course, be proved
whether they are written statements or verbal statements. If
they are verbal statements, the persons who heard the
deceased make the verbal statement must be examined on
oath as witness, and if a person at the time made a record of
the deceased’s statement, he may refresh his memory under
Article 155 or if he has no specific recollection of the statement
made, he may, under Article 156 of the Qunoon-e-Shahadat
1984 testified to the facts mentioned in the document if he is
sure that the facts were correctly recorded by him. In the
latter case, it seems to us the witness must still depose by
reference to the documents as to what the deceased said. We
do not mean it is necessary for the witness to read out his
statement and for the magistrate to record what the witness
reads out. The witness may be said to testify to the facts
mentioned in the documents if he produces the document and
to take oath that all that is written therein was actually
stated by the deceased.

29, If the statement to be proved is a written statement, as
in this case, made by a person who is dead, then it must be
proved that such statement was so made by the person who
is dead. In that case, of course, the written statement itself
becomes substantive evidence. What is to be decided is what
Criminal Appeal No.76/2017 it
Murder Reference No.06 of 2017

constitutes a written statement made by a person who is
dead, therefore, the expression “written statement” made by a
person who is dead means that the written statement must

have been actually made by the deceased person.

Now, a person may make a written statement either by

writing it out himself or by dictating it to some body else.
Usuaily, a person who is in immediate expectation of death is
too feeble to be able to write out his statement himself but if
any written statement is produced in the Court purporting to
have been made by a person who is dead, it must be shown,
if that person did not write that statement himself that he
dictated the statement and that he did not make the statement
in answer to any questions except sucha question as” will
you please state what it is you wish to be written down?. It
must be proved that the dictation has been taken down
correctly.. The procedure to establish such statement is to
show that the dictated statement was read over to the
deceased and admitted by him to be correct but the proper
procedure has not been adopted by Muhammad Nawaz ASI
(PW.2) as the fact of reading out the statement to the
deceased and admission of the deceased regarding statement
to be correct is not mentioned in his statement recorded during
trial.
30. To prove the capability of the deceased for making
dying declaration, the prosecution also produced Dr.
Muhammad Hassan Mahmood SMO. (PW.1), his certificate
Exh.PA/I is available on the record, which reflected that the
deceased was conscious and capable to make statement. He
was cross-examined by the defence on this particular aspect.
Relevant excerpt from his statement reads as under:

«..,,As per my opinion in case any person had sustained fire

arm injury on his belly six hours prior to his examination,

he may be conscious. Volunteers in case he had sustained
infury on any vital part like liver, heart, kidney then he

cannot be conscious after six hours time but in case he had
sustained injury on his stomach and intestine then he will
Criminal Appeal No.76/2017
Murder Reference No.06 of 2017

be conscious after six hours. ...- it is incorrect to suggest
that the injured was unconscious at the time when I
examined him and I did mention him as conscious due to
pressure from the complainant ‘s side and with malafide
intention”

31. Dr. Zahid Faroog appeared as PW.10 and in his final
opinion commented that after thorough external and internal
examination of the dead body all the injuries were observed
as ante mortem and caused by firearm weapon which caused
destruction of vital organs like liver, right lung, leading to
hypovolemic shock and later on developed septicemia which
led to death and as liver being one of the major organ of the
human body was damaged as per statement of PW.10, thus,
the capability of the deceased making statement appeared to
be doubtful.

32. The occurrence in this case took place on 26.8.2013.
The appellant in this case was arrested on 13.5.2016. Naseeb
Ahmad ASI (PW.3) filed an application (Exh.PG), on
21.10.2013 for issuance of warrants for the arrest of the
appellant whereupon, Ilaqa magistrate issued his warrants
Exh.PH for his arrest. On 30.10.2013, he entrusted the said
warrants to Ghulam Murtaza 1089-C for execution but he was
not produced during trial to depose regarding execution of the
non bailable warrants of the appellant. The record is totally
silent if the appellant was proceeded against under section 87
or 88 Cr.P.C.

33. Itis necessary that before treating an accused to be an
absconder or fugitive from law, the Court is required to take
into consideration all the factors such as evidence on the
record or to be produced by the prosecution to support the
absondance of an accused; the proceedings taken by the
Court under sections 87 and 88 Cr.P.C, stand taken by an
accused after his arrest; any evidence in rebuttal available
with the prosecution regarding stand of the accused at the
time of trial. In addition to that, it may be observed that if no
Criminal Appeal No.76/2017 bed
Murder Reference No.06 of 2017

proceedings were taken under sections 87 and 88 Cr.P.C. bya
trial Court, then the abscondence of an accused in our view is
of no consequences. Reliance in this context can be made to
the case reported in “Khan Mir _versys Amal Sherin_alias
Kamal and 2 others” (1989 SCMR 1987), “Mumtaz versus
The State’(1990 PCr.LJ 2055}

34. The resume of the above discussion is that the appellant
was nominated being the principal offender in the statement of
the injured/the deceased recorded by Muhammad Nawaz ASI
but no other witness mentioned in the said statement was
examined during trial. The medical evidence regarding
capability of the deceased for making dying declaration was
also open to objection. At this stage, we may also mention
that the appellant closed his evidence on 27.1.2017 and
placed on record (Exh.DA) which is a copy of record ofa
emergency ward of District Headquarter Hospital, Vehari
wherein the name of the deceased is mentioned at serial
No.7048 dated 26.8.2013 at 7:30 a.m. The defence suggested
to PW.2 that the deceased was brought to THQ, Hospital
Hasilpur from some other hospital but this fact has been
suppressed by the prosecution. Above all, medico legal report
(Exh.PC) suggested two injuries having inverted margins on
the epigastric region whereas, the deceased in his dying
declaration attributed only one shot to the appellant which is
belied by the medial evidence. In addition to that, Irshad
Hussain real brother of the deceased made an application
during the investigation and nominated Muhammad Munir
(acquitted co-accused) being the real culprit.

35. It is principle of criminal jurisprudence that the dying
declaration by itself is not a strong evidence being not tested
by way of cross-examination. The only reason for accepting
the same is that a person apprehending death due to injury,
caused to him is ordinarily not expected to speak the
falsehood. To believe or disbelieve the dying declaration,
inka Appeal No.76/2017 4
uirder Reference No.06 of 2017

thus, is left to the ordinary human judgment. However, the
Courts always insist upon strong, independent and reliable
corroborative evidence for the sake of safe dispensation of
justice. It has repeatedly been held by the apex Court that
relying upon the dying declaration without proper scrutiny
would be dangerous approach on the part of the Court of law.

In case titled Mst. Zahida Bibi v. The State (PLD 2006 SC
255), the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has observed at

page 262 as under:

“that except the dying declaration of the deceased, no other
evidence, direct or circumstantial, was available. This is an
admitted fact that the statement of the deceased was not
recorded by the Sub inspector of Police in Hospital in
presence of the doctor and further neither any member of
the hospital staff was associated at the time of recording
the statement nor it was got verified by any official of the
hospital that the statement was actually made by the
deceased, Be that as it may, the status of such a statement
would be hardly a statement under section 161, Cr.P.C, and
not a dying declaration of the deceased. This may be seen
that the dying declaration or a statement of a person
without the test of cross-examination is a weak kind of
evidence and its credibility certainly depends upon the
authenticity of the record and the circumstances under
which it is recorded, therefore, believing or disbelieving the
evidence of dying declaration is a matter of judgment but it
is dangerous to accept such statement without careful
scrutiny of the evidence and the surrounding
circumstances, to draw a correct conclusion regarding its
truthfulness. The rule of criminal administration of justice
is that the dying declaration like the statement of an
interested witness requires close scrutiny and is not to be
believed merely for the reason that dying person is not
expected to tell Ite. This is a matter of common knowledge
that in such circumstances in preference to any other
person, a doctor is most trustworthy and reliable person for
a patient to depose confidence in him with the expectation
of sympathy and better treatment to disclose the true facts,
In the present case, in the manner in which the statement of
deceased was recorded by Sub inspector would seriously
reflect upon its correctness and consequently could not be
considered worthy of any credit to be relied upon as dying
declaration.

28. Similar view has been taken by the Hon’ble Supreme
Court of Pakistan in case titled Tahir Khan v, The State

(2011 SCMR 646) and Farhan Ahmed V. Muhammad Anayat
(2007 SCMR 1825).”

36. From the perusal of the impugned judgment of the trial
Court, we came to the conclusion (Exh.PD) that the learned
trial judge has not properly appreciated and scrutinized the
Irfan

Criminal Appeal No.76/2017 -
Murder Reference No.06 of 2017

evidence produced during trial. The impugned judgment is
based on misreading and non reading of evidence. The
prosecution failed to prove the dying declaration and its case
beyond reasonable shadow of doubt.

37. In the light of the above analysis, we are of the view

that the dying declaration (Exh PD) could not be treated as an
admissible evidence and the conviction on the basis of such
evidence on capital charge was not legal and that after
excluding the dying declaration of the deceased which was
the foundation of the prosecution case, remaining evidence
would not be sufficient to sustain conviction. We, therefore,
hold that the prosecution has not been able to prove the
charge against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.
Resultantly, Criminal Appeal No.76 of 2017_ is allowed, The
impugned judgment is set aside. The appellant is acquitted of
the charge. He is in custody, be released forthwith, if not
required in any other criminal case.

Murder Reference _No.06 of 2017 is answered in the

negative and the death sentence is not confirmed.
