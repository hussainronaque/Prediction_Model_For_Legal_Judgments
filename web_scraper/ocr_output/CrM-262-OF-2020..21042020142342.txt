Vs.
The state and another
JUDGMENT
Date of hearing: 20.04.2020.

Petitioner (Gulbaz) by: Mr. Abdul Saboor Khan,
Advocate.

State by: Sardar Muhammad Asif, AAG.
Complainant by: Mr. Shad Muhammad Khan,
Advocate.

AHMAD ALI, J.- Through the instant petition, the
complainant has prayed for cancellation of bail
granted to the respondent No. 2 (Siraj) by the
learned Sessions Judge, Kohistan Lower, vide orders
dated 12.03.2019 in case FIR No. 247 dated
18.12.2019 under Section 302/311/148/149 PPC of
Police Station Dobair, District Kohistan Lower.

2. Complainant Gulbaz, accompanying the
dead body of his paternal cousin Yousaf Khan,
reported the matter to the local police that he along
with his cousin were returning home after taking

groceries and at about 01:00 PM, when they reached
village Sair Barkalay Ranwalia, accused Siraj S/o
Nosher, Ajdar Khan S/o Doraj, Doraj S/o Nosher,
Hassan S/o Seraj and Sadbar S/o Doraj were present
in the way, who were duly armed. On seeing the
complainant and deceased, Seraj and Ajdar Khan
started firing on Yousaf Khan who sustained injuries
and died on the spot. Rest of the accused were
present to aid accused Seraj and Ajdar Khan. After
the occurrence, accused decamped towards their
houses and meanwhile from the house of accused
Doraj, firing was heard and on query complainant
came to know that accused Doraj has committed
murder of his wife Mst. Zahib. The motive for the
occurrence was the suspicion of the accused that
both the deceased had illicit relations. On the basis
of report of the complainant, FIR was lodged against
the accused.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner
argued that the respondent-accused along with his
co-accused were directly charged for effective firing
at the deceased; that it was a broad daylight
occurrence, the presence of the eyewitness/
complainant has been established, medical evidence

duly supports the prosecution version, empties were
recovered from the spot and the grant of bail in such
circumstances was unusual; that the plea of alibi
raised by the accused/respondent required further
probe and on the sole plea, the bail could not be
granted. He argued that the order of the learned
Sessions Judge is not according to the record. He
argued that in each and every case, there is a room
for further inquiry, but it does not mean that it will
entitle the accused for the extraordinary concession
of bail in offences punishable with death or
imprisonment for life.

4. Learned State Counsel adopted the
arguments of the learned counsel for complainant.

5, Conversely, learned counsel for the
accused-respondent, argued that the FIR was not in
consonance with the site plan prepared at the
instance of the complainant. The record available on
file apparently makes the case to fall within the
ambit of further inquiry and _ that the
accused/respondent being a cancer patient was
rightly granted bail as he succeeded to establish that
he was not available on spot at the time of
occurrence. He argued that considerations for

cancellation of bail are different from the
consideration for grant of bail. He argued that there
must be strong and exceptional circumstances that
could warrant interference in bail granting order. He
placed reliance on the case of Muzaffar Iqbal Vs.
Muhammad Imran Aziz and others (2004 SCMR
231).

6. Arguments heard and record perused
with the able assistance of learned counsel for the
parties.

he While considering the bail application,
the Court has only to see that whether there are
reasonable grounds to believe that the accused has
committed the offence punishable with death or
imprisonment for life. The Court is not required to
conduct a preliminary inquiry/trial but has only to
make tentative assessment. The apex Court of the

country has set the guidelines for grant or refusal of
a bail in the case of “Yarig Bashir and 5 others Vs.

The State (PLD 1995 Supreme Court 34)”, wherein

it has been held that:-

“For arriving at the conclusion as to
whether or not there are reasonable
grounds to believe that the accused is
guilty of offence punishable with
death, imprisonment for life or with
ten years’ imprisonment, the Court
will not conduct a_ preliminary
trial/inquiry but will only make
tentative assessment, i.e. will look at

the material collected by the police

for and against the accused and be

prima facie satisfied that some

tangible evidence can be offered

which, if left unrebutted, may lead to

the inference of guilt. Deeper

appreciation of the evidence and

circumstances appearing in the case

is neither desirable nor permissible at

bail stage. So, the Court will not

minutely examine the merits of the

case or plea of defence at that stage”.
8. Deeper appreciation of evidence at bail
stage is not permissible, however, while allowing
bail to the accused, the learned Sessions Judge has
considered those factors, which are usually thrashed
after recording prosecution evidence and the same is
thus not sustainable. The accused were charged with
an offence punishable with death or imprisonment
for life.
9. Perusal of the bail granting order would
transpire that the learned Sessions Judge, while
allowing bail to the accused/respondent has
considered his plea of alibi. The record shows that
the accused/respondent raised his plea through
application dated 26.12.2019 wherein he claimed
that on the relevant day, he was present in his office.

His application was sent to the department for

inquiry and report. However, the investigating
officer of the case has not confirmed his plea of
alibi. The respondent/accused is directly charged for
the murder of deceased Yousaf Khan by making
indiscriminate firing on him. The occurrence was
witnessed by the eyewitnesses and the medical
reports of the deceased support prosecution version.
10. There is no cavil with the proposition
that when once bail is granted, strong and
exceptional grounds are needed to get it cancelled,
however, in this case, this Court finds that the
incident took place on 18.12.2019, at 01:00 p.m, and
the matter was reported to the local police at 1500
hours. There is no noticeable delay in lodging of the
FIR as it is yet to be established that whether the
place of occurrence was easily accessible and that
there was transport available and that the FIR was
lodged after deliberation etc. The respondent was
duly nominated in the FIR, with specific role of
firing at the deceased. In the case of “Mst. Noor
Habib Vs. Saleem Raza and others (2009 SCMR
786)” it was held by the apex Court that:-

“Considering the case of
respondents for grant of bail on
the above touchstone, we are of

the view that learned High Court
was not at all justified in
extending benefit of grant of bail
to Saleem Raza and Akhtar Islam
respondent. Both the respondents
have been specifically named in
the FIR for firing effectively along
with others, culminating in the
murders of two young brothers,
aged 35 years and 32 years
respectively. Fifty-two crime
empties have been recovered from
the place of occurrence and large
number of fire-arm injuries are
found on the persons of the
deceased. In such circumstances
when they all had been prima-
facie implicated, there was no
Justification for the grant of bail
to any of them. Learned counsel
for the petitioner rightly
contended that whatever pleas
they desire to raise in their
defence, could be raised at the

trial stage.”

11. In the instant case too, the respondent
stands directly charged for making effective firing at
the deceased, recoveries have been effected from the
place of occurrence and the medical report of the

deceased shows multiple firearm injuries on his
body. In the case of “Ghulam Qammber Shah Vs.
Mukhtiar Hussain (PLD 2015 SC 66)”, the august
Supreme Court of Pakistan, recalled the bail granted
to the accused, by holding that:-

“On the merits of the case, we
have notices that respondent No.
1 was attributed a specific firearm
injury on the neck of Zahid
Hussain PW who has so far stood
by his allegation against the
respondent in that respect and he
is prima-facie supported by the
medical evidence. In these
circumstances, it could not be
said that the case against
respondent No. 1 called for
further inquiry into his guilt for

the purpose of releasing him on

,; post-arrest bail.”

Reference can also be made to the case
of “Mst. Jewan Mai Vs. The State (PLD 2015 SC
242) and Abdul Ghaffar Vs. Sakhi Sultan and 3
others (1987 SCMR 1556)”.

12. The petitioner stands directly charged
for an offence punishable with death or
imprisonment for life and falls within the

prohibitory limb of Section 497 Cr.P.C. and in such
like cases, the grant of bail on the grounds which are
yet to be established during trial, is uncalled for. The
order of the learned Sessions Judge, Kohistan
Lower, on the face of it, is perverse and the
discretion exercised in allowing bail is arbitrary,
therefore, the bail granting order is not sustainable in
the eye of law.

12. Needles to mention that the
observations recorded herein above, are purely
tentative in nature for disposal of petitioner for
cancellation of bail and shall, in no way, prejudice
the learned trial Court.

13% For the afore-stated reasons, the petition
in hand is allowed, bail granting order dated
12.03.2019, passed by the learned Sessions Judge,
Kohistan Lower is set aside, consequently bail
granted to the respondent-accused is hereby
cancelled. He is present in Court, taken into custody
and sent to Judicial Lockup.

14. Above are reasons of my short order of
even date.
