On the strength of same decision co-accused of appellant were
acquitted from the case.

3. Feeling aggrieved from conviction, appellant has
approached this Court through the instant criminal appeal.

4. Facts of the case are that by filing the complaint, on
02.04.2012, Mst. Nazran Bibi (Pw-1) against Tanveer Abbas
(appellant) and his co-accused beside one Muhammad Irshad
(Proclaimed Offender) for their prosecution under Sections
364/302/201/404/148/149 PPC, it was alleged that on
29.07.2011 at about 08:30 pm, she/Nazran Bibi along with her
parents and brother Allah Ditta (deceased) were present in their
house; in the meantime Tanveer Abbas (appellant) while
standing at the door of the house called Allah Ditta who went
out; she/complainant also came out and saw Tanveer Abbas
(appellant), Muhammad Irshad (PO) and Fageer Hussain (accused)
present on two motorbikes; Allah Ditta (deceased) accompanied
them but did not return; at about 11:00 pm, she associating her
parents started search of Allah Ditta; when they reached at the
house of Tanveer Abbas (appellant), no one was present there;
they moved further to explore and on the way Muhammad
Wasil (Pw-3) as well as Khizar Abbas (not produced) met them
who told that at about 11:00 pm, when they were sitting at the
hotel of Muhammad Ramzan, they had seen Allah Ditta
(deceased) with Tanvir Abbas (appellant), Munir Hussain, Anwaar
Hussain and Muhammad Irshad (PO) and all they were stepping
towards Canal 15/L; she/complainant had been searching Allah
Ditta but of no success; she had a strong belief that her brother
was abducted by assailants with an intention of his ‘Qatal-i-
Amd’ or after committing his murder they/accused had screened
the dead body; motive was that Allah Ditta (deceased) was an
employee of Tanvir Abbas (appellant) which he/Allah Ditta
discontinued about one month earlier for the reason that Tanvir
Abbas (appellant) conceived a suspicion about illicit relations of

his wife with Allah Ditta (deceased); about the abduction of

Allah Ditta, she got recorded FIR® No.320 on 03.08.2011 under
Section 364 PPC at Police Station Sadar Mianchannu; while
reporting the matter as she was under agony therefore, she
missed some important facts with regard to Allah Ditta, so she
made a supplementary statement that Allah Ditta was in
possession of a black colored wallet having his original CNIC,
Rs.500/-, a handkerchief of blue lined colour with embroidery
of his name ‘Allah Ditta’; there was also a silver ring in
his/Allah Ditta finger with his name engraved; after registration
of case at about 03:00 pm, Muhammad Wasil (Pw-3) and Khizar
Hayat also told her that Tanveer Abbas (appellant), Muhammad
Irshad and Fageer Hussain came to his house; they asked for
pardon; they, turn by turn, admitted that on 29.07.2011 after
abduction, Allah Ditta was taken to the house of Tanveer Abbas
(appellant) where he was murdered by way of a fire with pistol
30 bore made by Tanveer Abbas (appellant); they further
disclosed that while leaving Muhammad Irshad and Faqeer
Hussain for guarding the dead body, Tanveer Abbas (appellant)
went to the house of Jahangir (accused) and obtained from him a
‘Kassi”’ (.«S) and jute bag; with the help of Muhammad Irshad
and Faqeer Hussain the dead body was wrapped in jute bag and
brown colored Chadar®% while sitting on the motorbike
(KWB-3243) they had taken the dead body in the Canal 15/L
opposite to Chak No.43/15-L, where they threw it near the
Canal and then all three escaped from there; after making said
confession they left the house of Muhammad Wasil. Ultimate
version of complainant was that police had made connivance
with assailants who declared Munir Hussain and Anwaar
Hussain as innocent so she was compelled to file the private
complaint.

5. After issuance of processes by the learned trial court,

appellant and his co-accused including Muhammad Irshad (PO)

turned up to face the trial. As during proceedings Muhammad
Irshad disappeared, so he was declared as an absconder.

6. It is important to mention here that, on 03.08.2011,
Mst. Nazran Bibi (Pw-1) also submitted an application (PA) to
SHO? Police Station Sadar Mianchannu, where she only alleged
that Tanvir Abbas etc. had taken with them Allah Ditta and they
were also seen later on by Muhammad Wasil and Khizar Hayat
when they were going towards Canal. She further declared that
the abduction of her brother was with an intention to kill by the
assailants. Motive attributed was the same as referred earlier.

7. On the basis of above stated application, FIR No.320, on
03.08.2011, under Sections 364/302/404/201/148/149 PPC was
registered at Police Station Sadar Mianchannu.

8. A charge under Sections 302/404/201/148/149 PPC
framed against appellant and his co-accused, on 06.09.2012,
was not pleaded guilty by them and they demanded the trial.

9. In order to prove her case, Nazran Bibi/complainant got
her statement recorded as Pw-179. She too produced Abdul Aziz
(Pw-2) and Mohammad Wasil (Pw-3).

10. Learned trial court also examined Muhammad Ameen
Constable (Cw-1)’7, Dr. Muhammad Shahbaz (Cw-2), Shabbir
Ahmad ASI” (Cw-3), Raja Ghulam Fareed Janjua/Draftsman
(Cw-4), Muhammad Ashraf HC7? (Cw-5) and Muhammad Latif

13. HEARD

14. Case in hand is based on circumstantial evidence. This

Court in Allah Rakkha’ case’? referring to definition of

circumstantial evidence, had observed as under: -

i.

iii.

Evidence of facts or circumstances from
which the existence or non existence of fact
in issue may be inferred.

The proof of various facts or circumstances
which usually attend the main fact in
dispute, and therefore tend to prove its
existence.

As a series of circumstances leading to the
inference or conclusion of guilt, when direct
evidence is not available.

It falls short of directly establishing a fact in
issue, but which is admissible by reason of
its relevance to the fact in issue.

A particular set of circumstances may lead
to the appropriate inference being drawn.

A theory, supported by a significant quantity
of corroborating evidence.

It simply means that when there is no direct
evidence of a problem, it's a good idea to
look around for any other evidence that
might be useful.

15. While differentiating the direct and circumstantial

evidence it was also observed that: -

“Sometimes it is easier to understand the
difference with an example. If your brother
comes to you and says he saw it snow today,
then there is direct evidence that it was
snowing. If your brother told you that he woke
up and saw snow on the ground, then there is
circumstantial evidence that it snowed. He did
not see it snow, but it is a reasonable inference
that if there is snow on the ground, it must have
snowed”

16. The honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan in its land

mark judgment’®

has also been pleased to formulate the

following principles to appreciate the circumstantial evidence: -

appeal No. 445 of 2013) decided on 05.10.2021 (approved for reporting)

iii.

viii.

ix.

Circumstantial evidence may sometimes be
conclusive, but it must always be narrowly
examined.

Circumstances should be ascertained with
minute care and caution, before any conclusion
or inference adverse to the accused is drawn.
The process of inference and deduction involved
in such cases is of a delicate and perplexing
character, liable to numerous causes of fallacy.
This danger points need for great caution in
accepting proof of the facts and circumstances,
before they are held to be established for the
purpose of drawing inferences there from.

A mere concurrence of circumstances, some or
all of which are supported by defective or
inadequate evidence, can create a specious
appearance, leading to fallacious inferences.

It is necessary that only such circumstances
should be accepted as the basis of inferences
that are, on careful examination of the evidence,
found to be well-established.

A high quality of evidence is, therefore,
required to prove the facts and circumstances
from which the inference of the guilt of the
accused person is to be drawn.

There are chances of fabricating evidence in
cases that are based solely on circumstantial
evidence; therefore, the court, in such cases,
should take extra care and caution to examine
the evidence with pure judicial approach on
strict legal standards to satisfy itself about its
proof, probative value and reliability.

When there are apparent indications of
possibility of fabricating evidence by the
investigating officer in making the case, the
court must be watchful against the trap, which
may misled to drawing a false inference, and
satisfy itself about the fair and genuine
collection of such evidence. The failure of the
court to observe such care and caution can
adversely affect the proper and safe
administration of criminal justice.

The settled approach to deal with the question
as to sufficiency of circumstantial evidence for
conviction of the accused is this: If, on the facts
and circumstances proved, no hypothesis
consistent with the innocence of accused can be
suggested, the case is fit for conviction on such
conclusion; however, if such facts and
circumstances can be reconciled with any
reasonable hypothesis compatible with the
innocence of the accused, the case is to be
treated one of insufficient evidence, resulting in
acquittal of the accused.
Criminal

eal No.620 of 2016

Tanveer Abbas vs. The State & another.

xi. Circumstantial evidence, in a murder case,
should be like a well-knit chain, one end of
which touches the dead body of the deceased
and the other the neck of the accused.

xii. No link in chain of the circumstances should be
broken and the circumstances should be such as
cannot be explained away on any reasonable
hypothesis other than guilt of accused.

xiii. Chain of such facts and circumstances has to be
completed to establish guilt of the accused
beyond reasonable doubt and to make the plea
of his being innocent incompatible with the
weight of evidence against him. Any link
missing from the chain breaks the whole chain
and renders the same unreliable and in that
event, conviction cannot be safely recorded,
especially on a capital charge.

xiv. Ifthe circumstantial evidence is found not of the
said standard and quality, it will be highly
unsafe to rely upon the same for conviction;
rather, not to rely upon such evidence will a
better and a safer course.

17. Applying the above referred principles on the subject, I
proceed to examine the various pieces of evidence relied upon
by the prosecution.

18. The main focus of prosecution is that, Tanveer Abbas
(appellant) and his co-accused got recovered the dead body on
11.08.2011 from the Canal. But unfortunately the focus
remained blurring as what prosecution had desired to prove, it
could not.

19. To discuss this evidence, date of arrest of Tanveer Abbas
(appellant) and his co-accused is quite relevant. According to
Mst. Nazran Bibi (Pw-1), Tanveer Abbas (appellant) and
Muhammad Irshad (PO) were arrested on 04/05 .08.2011 and she
was confident about it. She further responded she met both the
accused in Police Station on these dates. Muhammad Wasil
(Pw-3), in his examination-in-chief, stated the date of arrest of
Tanvir Abbas (appellant) as 11.08.2011 when he joined Khizar
Hayat Inspector. This date is in complete contrast to the date
given by Mst. Nazran Bibi. Muhammad Wasil was also self

conflict when he, in cross-examination, specifically replied that
Criminal

eal No.620 of 2016

Tanveer Abbas vs. The State & another.

‘as per his information accused were arrested in case after 5/6
days of the occurrence’. From this angle the dates becomes the
same which Nazran Bibi (Pw-1) maintained in her deposition.
On the other hand, Muhammad Latif SI (Pw-6) without any
ambiguity and in clear words claimed that on 11.08.2011 at
about 07:00 am he arrested Tanveer Abbas (appellant) and
Muhammad Irshad (PO) from Chak No44/15-L. Taking into
account this contradictory position, subsequent story of
recovery of dead body, has come under serious doubts.

20. Whether the dead body was recovered at the instance of
appellant or any other accused, this is also a mystery.
Mst. Nazran Bibi (Pw-1), in her examination-in-chief,
maintained that on 11.08.2011 in presence of her and
Muhammad Latif SI, Tanvir Abbas (appellant) got recovered the
dead body of Allah Ditta from Canal which she had identified.
In cross-examination, she further stated that the dead body was
brought out from the Canal by appellant with his own hands.

21. When Muhammad Wasil (Cw-3) made his examination-in-
chief, he added that Tanveer Abbas (appellant), Muhammad
Irshad (PO) and Faqeer Hussain (accused) led to the recovery of
dead body. Undoubtedly this statement is in full contrast to the
account of Mst. Nazran Bibi. However the declaration of
Muhammad Latif SI is entirely different who was never of the
view that appellant or his co-accused got recovered the dead
body. What he narrated in his examination-in-chief that was as
under: -

“On the same day I along with accused Tanveer
Abbas, Faqeer Hussain and Muhammad Irshad
proceeded to Canal 43/15-L where accused got
recovered Chaddar P15 which was blood
stained. I made it into sealed parcel, took the
same into possession vide recovery memo
Exh.Cw-6/4 and attested the recovery memo by
PWs Muhammad Wasil and Khizar Hayat and
recorded their statements under Section 161
Cr.P.C. We searched for dead body in the
Canal within the area of 128-Pull, the dead

eal No.620 of 2016

body of the deceased Allah Ditta was
recovered ”
22. Even in his cross-examination, there is nothing to suggest

that, if the dead body was recovered either at the instance of
appellant or any of his co-accused.

23. I have also gone through the identification memos
prepared by the Investigating Officer. None of these documents
indicates with clarity that appellant or his co-accused after
disclosure led the police party to the Canal and got recovered
dead body. All these documents at the most show that either the
place of murder or the venue of Canal was pointed by appellant
and his co-accused.

24. The Investigating Officer, in  cross-examination,
responded that before 11.08.2011, it was not in the knowledge
of complainant that the dead body was thrown in Canal. If this
was the real position, what the prosecution has explanation
about the important words came out from the mouth of
Mst. Nazran Bibi (Pw-1) that on 29.07.2011 somebody informed
her that accused persons had murdered Allah Ditta and the dead
body was thrown in Canal. How prosecution will come out
from this challenge when Muhammad Latif SI in cross-
examination answered that: -

“It is correct that the complainant of this
case remained in search the dead body of
deceased Allah Ditta from the date of
occurrence till the arrest of accused in
the Canal”

25. It is therefore concluded that in view of above infirm,
week, shaky, contradictory and self contradictory evidence the
recovery of dead body at the instance of appellant or any of his
co-accused has not been proved by the prosecution.

26. Moving the discussion to the next piece of evidence that
is the extrajudicial confession, which has already been referred
in opening paragraphs of this judgment, Muhammad Wasil

(Pw-3) asserted that Tanveer Abbas (appellant), Muhammad
Criminal

eal No.620 of 2016

Tanveer Abbas vs. The State & another.

Irshad (PO) and Fageer Hussain (accused) came to him on
03.08.2011 and made the confession turn by turn. On
confrontation from his statement recorded under Section 161
Cr.P.C and cursory declaration he has been found under
improvement when he added that appellant and his co-accused
made confession turn by turn. In his earlier statements it was
appearing to be joint extrajudicial confession which under the
settled principles of law has no evidentiary value’’.

27. The conduct of Muhammad Wasil (Pw-3) is highly
objectionable for the reason that if on 03.08.2011 he got the
important information, why he did not appear before the police
on the same day and why he came forward on 04.08.2011 for
his statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C? On this area the
principles cannot be ignored that delayed statement of an
important witness without offering any explanation is not
reliable’.

28.  Extrajudicial confession also under the recognized
principles is the weakest type of evidence and no conviction can
be recorded on the basis thereof 79.

29. According to next hook of chain of evidence on the arrest
of Tanveer Abbas (appellant), he was found in possession of
CNIC of Allah Ditta (deceased). Even here prosecution has to
face defeat and for this its’ own witness Mst. Nazran Bibi (Pw-1)
is contributory who, in cross-examination, replied that CNIC
was in the wallet of deceased on recovery of his dead body.

30. Damage to prosecution is further multiplied when the
statement of Abdul Aziz (Pw-2) is also found under heavy
smoke of doubts. He claimed that, on 29.02.2011, at midnight
he had seen that Jahangir (accused) was handing over a ‘Kassi’
and jute bag to Tanveer Abbas (appellant). It appears that this

evidence has been introduced with a specific purpose to give a

so-called strength to the so-called extrajudicial confession,
where it was stated that Tanveer Abbas (appellant) had gone to
Jahangir (accused) for taking ‘Kassi’ and jute bag and it was
used to move the dead body to Canal. If, on 29.07.2011, this
gentleman had witnessed what he stated and he told this fact to
complainant on 30.07.2011 as responded in cross-examination,
the complainant was supposed to disclose this important fact
while reporting the matter to police so on this reason alone
statement of Abdul Aziz is of no consequence for the
prosecution.

31. An empty was recovered at the instance of appellant on
11.08.2011 whereas pistol was recovered on 17.08.2011. It
appears that both the recoveries most probably were made from
the same place so it is a serious question that if the appellant got
recovered empty on 11.08.2011 what was the hurdle in his way
also to get recovered the pistol on that day. This fact has
smashed the authenticity of the positive report of firearm expert
(PJ) which now at the most is a piece of paper with no
supportive outcome for prosecution.

32. When all other hooks of the chain have been destroyed
and broken, this Court has no option but to say the last seen
evidence ‘Goodbye’ which too repeatedly has been considered
as the weakest type of proof??.

33. Last but not least the allegations of abduction and the
murder of Allah Ditta, was almost against all accused including
the appellant. Four out of five accused have been acquitted by
the learned trial court by disbelieving the statements of
witnesses so no question arises to believe the same evidence
qua the appellant?7.

Court finds that prosecution has badly failed to prove its’ case
beyond reasonable doubt against Tanveer Abbas (appellant),
therefore, this criminal appeal is allowed. Impugned judgment
dated 10.06.2016 to the extent of convicting the appellant is set
aside. He is acquitted from the case. He is on bail. His surety is
discharged from the terms and conditions of bail bonds. Case
property shall be dealt with in the same manners as directed by
the learned trial court.

35. Before parting with this judgment, I want to observe that
the learned Additional Sessions Judge also sentenced the
appellant to pay fine despite the fact that under Section 302(b)
PPC no such punishment has been provided, therefore, copy of
this judgment shall be sent to the learned Additional Sessions
Judge wherever he is posted for his information and guidance in

future.
