JUDGMENT

MUSARRAT HILALL, J.- This criminal appeal has been
directed against the judgment dated 29.09.2020 passed by
learned Additional Sessions Judge/Judge Special Court,
Nowshera, whereby the appellant Muhammad Khuram,
was convicted and sentenced under section 9 (c ) CNSA
to imprisonment for life with a fine of Rs. 2,00,000/-or in
default thereof to further undergo SI for six months.

2. . The prosecution story, as reflected from the record,
is that on 28.02.2018 at 2400 hours, on prior tip off,
Muhammad Yaseen, Intelligence Officer, Custom,
along with other staff intercepted the accused-appellant at
Rashakai Interchange, situated in the criminal jurisdiction
of District Nowshera, while trafficking huge illegal stuff,
ie, 25 k.gs chars and 3 k.gs opium, in a motorcar

bearing registration No. LXL-5640 driven by him and
upon his arrest, a case FIR No. 16/2018, dated
01.03.2018, under sections 6/7/8 & 9 (c) CNSA was
registered against him at police station, I & P Branch
Customs House, District Peshawar. Since the vehicle in
question was in the name of Saleem Shahid Hashmi,
therefore, he was also arrayed as accused in the case.
After completion of investigation and submission of
challan, the case was tried by learned Judge, Special
Court, Nowshera. During pendency of the trial,
co-accused Saleem Shahid Hashmi was acquitted of the
charge under section 265-K Cr.P.C while the present
appellant was charge sheeted to which he pleaded not
guilty and opted to face the trial. Learned trial court after
recording statements of the prosecution witnesses and
examination of accused-appellant under section 342
Cr.P.C, convicted and sentenced him, as referred to
above, vide judgment dated 29.09.2020, hence the
present appeal.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4.  Perusal of the record would reveal that report
regarding the occurrence was not recorded on the spot as
the incident took place on 28.02.2018 at 2400 hours at

Rashakai Interchange, District Nowshera, while report
was recorded on the following day i.e., 01.03.2018 at
11.00 hours at Peshawar. Reason for not recording the
report on the spot, as given in the FIR, is that on arrest of
accused and cursory inspection of the motorcar, there
was no proper management for measurement of the
narcotics, therefore, the motorcar was brought to the
Customs Intelligence and Investigation Peshawar. When
appeared as PW-2, the complainant stated in his cross
examination that on reaching the office back from the
place of occurrence, neither murasilla was scribed nor
FIR was registered. Ishfaq Ahmad (PW-3) was present
with the complainant at the relevant time, who in cross
examination stated that when they came back to the
office, they locked the accused in the lockup and,
thereafter, went to their houses; however, the case
property and accused were handed over to the security
personnel present in the office.

The object of recording of murasilla or
registration of FIR, apart from setting law into motion, is
to provide base for carrying out investigation in the right
direction. No doubt, there are no hard and fast rules as to
the duration of time consumed in the registration of FIR,

but such prompt measure would rule out the possibility of
deliberation, consultation and enquiry before furnishing
the information. The element of delay in lodging the
crime report is treated with caution because there is a
tendency to involve innocent people during the interval.
The longer the intermission the greater are the chances of
false implication, therefore, it is necessary for the
prosecution to at least come forward with plausible
explanation for the delay caused. In the instant case, the
complainant Muhammad Yaseen being responsible
officer, under the law, was required to have drafted
murasilla, prepared card of arrest of the accused and
recovery memo about seizing of the motorcar on the spot
on 28.02.2018 and not supposed to postpone the process
of registration of case FIR or investigation for the
following day. He has not only skipped the legal and
procedural course but also handed over the seized
motorcar and accused to the Security Staff having
nothing to do with investigation of the case, therefore, in
the circumstances, there is every possibility of placing
the narcotics in the motorcar during the intervening
period, which aspect of the case, creates serious doubt in

the story of prosecution.
5. Another doubtful aspect of the case is that
complainant in examination in chief has stated that FIR
Ex PW 2/9 was drafted by him but the same has not been
signed by him. The complainant has completed the entire
proceedings, including registration of FIR, while sitting
in his office in presence of his subordinates, who are
shown marginal witnesses to the recovery memo. In the
FIR, only columns of number of FIR and time of report
were left blanks which columns were later on filled in
with hand writing.

6. We have also observed material contradictions in
the statements of PWs which further makes the case of
prosecution doubtful. Complainant in cross examination
stated that the information was conveyed to him by
Superintendent Manzoor while Ashfaq (PW-3) in cross
examination stated that Inspector Arif Ullah had
conveyed the information. Similarly, the former stated
that there was one secret cavity in the motorcar, while the
latter stated that the vehicle was having two secret
cavities. Likewise, their testimony regarding colour of
narcotics was also not in line as the former stated that the

colour of charas was of ‘Mehendi’ and the opium was
‘blackish’, while the latter stated that colour of chars and
opium was ‘Khar’ ( bo ).

7. No doubt, FSL report regarding the illegal stuff
available on record is in positive but the same too is
undependable. In order to place reliance on the FSL
report, in narcotic cases, the prosecution is required to
establish the continuous chain of custody of the sample
and its safe transmission to the laboratory coupled with
requisite protocol by the laboratory, but in the instant
case, neither the FSL report has been exhibited nor the
same indicates requisite protocols nor there is any track
of the samples as to how and through whom the same
were transmitted to the laboratory. It has now been well
settled that where safe custody of the recovered
substance or safe transmission of samples of the
recovered substance is not established by the prosecution,
it cannot be held that the prosecution had succeeded in
establishing its case against the accused. Rel: State
through Regional Director ANF v. Imam Bakhsh and
others (2018 SCMR 2039). Similarly, in the case titled

Mst. Sakina Zaman vs. the State (2021 SCMJR 451),
the august apex court has held that:-

“The chain of custody or safe custody and safe

transmission of narcotic drug begins with seizure of the
narcotic drug by the law enforcement officer, followed
by separation of the representative samples of the seized
narcotic drug, storage of the representative samples and
the narcotic drug with the law enforcement agency and
then dispatch of the representative samples of the
narcotic drugs to the office of the chemical examiner for
examination and testing. This chain of custody must be
safe and secure. This is because, the Report of the
Chemical Examiner enjoys critical importance under
CNSA and the chain of custody ensures that correct
representative samples reach the office of the Chemical
Examiner. Any break or gap in the chain of custody i.e.,
in the safe custody or safe transmission of the narcotic
drug or its representative samples makes the Report of
the Chemical Examiner unsafe and unreliable for

justifying conviction of the accused.”

In the case titled Khair-ul-Bashar v. the State

(2019 SCMR_ 930), Hon’ble Supreme Court has held

that:-

“The Report also does not signify the test protocols that
were applied to carry out these tests. Hence, the mandatory
requirement of law provided under Rule 6 has not been
complied with and, thus, it is not safe to rely on the Report
of the Government Analyst dated 18-02-2016. As a
conclusion, it is reiterated, that the Report of the
Government Analyst must mention (i) all the tests and
analysis of the alleged drug (ii) the result of the each test(s)
carried out along with the consolidated result and (iii) the

name of all the protocols applied to carry out these tests.

The above view has also been reiterated in the case

titled Qaiser_Javed_ Khan vs. The State through
Prosecutor General Punjab, Lahore and another,
C

(PLD 2020 SC 57) by the Hon’able the apex Court by
holding that:-

“8. The report of the Government Analyst in the instant
case does not specify the protocols of the tests applied and
thus does not meet the requirements of the law as
interpreted by this Court in the cases of Amam Bakhsh and
Khair ul Bashar (supra). The said Report cannot be relied

upon for the conviction of the petitioner.”

8. The crux of the above discussion is that the
prosecution has not been able to bring home the charge
against the appellant beyond any shadow of doubt,
therefore, it would not be safe to maintain the conviction
and sentences awarded to him on such evidence and that
too for the offence carrying capital punishment, thus, by
extending benefit of doubt, the instant appeal is allowed,
consequently, the impugned judgment of conviction
rendered by the learned Judge Special court is set aside
and the appellant is acquitted of the charge levelled
against him. He be released forthwith if not required in
any other case.

Above are the reasons of short order of even date.
