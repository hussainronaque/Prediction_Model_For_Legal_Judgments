JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.-

This appeal, filed by appellant Bakht Munir,
calls in question the legality and propriety of
judgment dated 10.06.2013, rendered by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-VI, Mardan, whereby
the appellant having been found guilty of
committing the murder of his wife Mst. Bushra
deceased, has been convicted under section 302
(b) PPC and sentenced to undergo life
imprisonment and to pay Rs.1,00,000/-, as
compensation to legal heirs of the deceased in
terms of S.544-A Cr.P.C. or in default thereof to
undergo 06 months S.I. further.

2. The prosecution case is that, on receipt

of information qua incident of murder in the

limits of Qazi hospital Par Hoti Mardan and that
the culprit was decamping from the spot,
Mohmand Khan ASI, rushed there, noticed a
person running. who was_ chased and
apprehended by him near Faisal Steel alongwith
30 bore pistol. On query, said person disclosed
his name as Bakht Munir (appellant-convict
herein). The pistol containing two live rounds in
its chamber giving smell of freshly discharge
was taken into possession vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.2/1. On cursory interrogation, the
appellant disclosed that since he was suspecting
the character of his wife Mst. Bushra, therefore,
did her away with the said pistol. He was
formally arrested, murasila Exh.PA/1was drafted
and sent to Police Station, on the basis of which
FIR No.24 dated 14.01.2012 under section 302
PPC in Police Station Par Hoti Mardan was
registered against the appellant.

3. Lady doctor Nasra Anjum conducted
autopsy on the dead body of the Mst. Bushra
deceased and found the following injuries on her

person:-

1. A firearm entry wound on left occipital
region (back of skull) 1 x 1 cm.

2. A firearm exit wound in front of right ear 2
x 2 cm.

3. Firearm entry wound on right forearm
dorsal side (lower 1/3") of 2 x 2 cm.

4. A firearm exit wound on right forearm
ventral aspect (lower 1/3™) of 5 x 4 cm.

Opinion: According to her opinion the deceased

met her unnatural death due to firearm injury to

her brain.

Probable time between injuries and death has

been given as “within minutes” while between

death and postmortem as “one to two hours.

4. Muhammad Akbar S.I. visited the crime

venue and prepared site plan Exh.PB. He also

prepared the sketch of the place of arrest of the

appellant, recorded statements of the PWs,

secured blood from the place of the deceased

vide recovery memo Exh.PW.7/1, took into

possession 2 crime empties of 30 bore vide

recovery memo Exh.PW.7/2, bloodstained last

worm garments of the deceased vide recovery

memo Exh.Pw.5/1, sent the empties and pistol to

the FSL as well as the bloodstained articles,
reports whereof are Exh.PZ and Exh.PZ/1. He
also collected record of the family suits between
the deceased and = appellant, produced
Mst. Zubaida and Shah Zeb for recording their
statements under section 164 Cr.P.C. before the
learned Judicial Magistrate, interrogated the
accused/appellant and after completion of
investigation handed over case file to Nihar Ali
Khan SHO, who submitted challan against the
appellant.

5. On receipt of challan by the learned
Trial Court, appellant was summoned and
formally charge sheeted, to which he pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial. To prove its case,
prosecution examined as many as_ eight
witnesses. After closure of the prosecution
evidence, statement of the appellant was
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C. wherein he
denied the prosecution allegations and professed
his innocence. He, however, declined to be
examined on oath or to produce evidence in
defence. On conclusion of trial, learned Trial

Court, after hearing both the sides, convicted

and sentenced the appellant, as mentioned
above, hence, this appeal.

6. Learned counsel for the appellant argued
that impugned judgment of the learned trial
Court is based on surmises and conjectures as
there is no eyewitness of the occurrence; that
alleged admission of guilt by the accused before
the police is not a judicial confession, therefore,
has no evidentiary value under article 38 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, therefore,
cannot be used against him; that on the one
hand, the recovery of the alleged pistol from
possession of the appellant is highly doubtful,
while on the other hand, it has been sent to the
FSL with the alleged crime empties after a delay
of seven days, for which no explanation, much
less plausible, has been furnished by the
prosecution, therefore, the positive FSL report in
respect thereof would not advance the
prosecution case. He further contended that first
husband of the deceased, namely, Farooq, from
whom she had three sons, namely Adnan,
Noman and Zeeshan had been murdered,

whereafter she contracted second marriage with

one Ibrahim, but she get divorce from him
through a court decree and lastly she married the
appellant so it does appeal to mind that she
might have been murdered by her second
husband or the relatives of first husband. He
lastly, contended that it is a blind murder and the
prosecution miserably failed to prove the guilt of
the appellant through cogent and confidence
inspiring direct or circumstantial evidence,
therefore, impugned judgment of the learned
Trial Court is liable to be set aside and the
appellant be acquitted.

7. Conversely, learned AAG assisted by
learned counsel for the complainant contended
that appellant has been arrested red handed
alongwith the crime pistol, who admitted his
guilt before the police; that the positive FSL
report qua the crime empties and pistol coupled
with medical evidence and recoveries from the
spot support the prosecution case. They while
supporting the impugned judgment, sought
dismissal of the appeal.

8. We have heard and arguments and

perused the record carefully.

9. Admittedly, it is a case of no
eyewitness. Muhammad Akbar Khan SI (PW.7),
who conducted investigation in the case
categorically, admitted that the occurrence is
un-witnessed as nobody has come forward to
furnish the ocular account.

10. The only circumstance against the
appellant which prevailed before the learned
Trial Court is his alleged admission before the
police about his guilt, but he has not confessed
his guilt before the competent Court of law,
therefore, his alleged statement before the police
would amount to confession before the police
and such statements have no evidentiary value
under Article 38 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat
Order, 1984. Another piece of evidence which
prevailed before the learned Trial Court for
recording conviction of the appellant is the
positive FSL report about the crime empties and
the crime pistol, Mohmand Khan ASI, who
arrested the appellant alongwith crime pistol
appeared as PW.7. In cross-examination he
deposed that after arrest of the accused, he

himself brought him to Police Station and put

him in the lockup; that after that he drafted
murasila and recovery memo; that first he
prepared recovery memo and then after two
minutes drafted murasila. He further deposed
that the pistol and live rounds were sealed on the
spot in parcel by him. Contrary to his statement,
Feroz Khan FC (PW.3), who stood as marginal
witness to the recovery memo Exh.PW.2/1 vide
which the alleged crime pistol was taken into
possession, deposed that the murasila was
drafted on the spot and he shifted the accused
and murasila to Police Station. Both the star
witnesses of the recovery are not consistent with
each other about drafting of murasila and
shifting the accused to Police Station. Both have
furnished squarely different versions, which one
is true would be best known to them, however, it
create serious doubts about the arrest of the
appellant and recovery of alleged pistol from his
possession.

11. Besides, the crime pistol had been
allegedly recovered on the same day of incident
ie. 14.01.2012, but has been sent to the FSL

with the crime empties on 21.01.2012 ie. after a

delay of seven days, for which no explanation,
much less plausible has been furnished by the
prosecution as to where and in whose custody
the pistol and empties remained for this period
and whether these were in safe hands.
Muhammad Akbar Khan S.1
(PW.7/Investigating Officer deposed that he has
not recorded statement of any concerned person
regarding delay in sending the articles to the
FSL. In the circumstances, two interpretations of
this piece of evidence are possible, one that the
alleged empties and pistol have not been
tampered, and the other, that these were not in
safe hand and have been tampered. It is settled
law that when two interpretations of evidence
are possible, the one favouring the accused shall
be taken into consideration. In this view of the
matter, the positive FSL report qua the crime
empties and pistol being delayed without any
plausible explanation, would not advance the
prosecution case, therefore, has wrongly been
relied upon by the learned trial Court.

12. There is no direct or circumstantial

evidence to bring home the guilt of the

10

appellant. Rather, there are so many
circumstances, discussed above creating serious
doubts in the prosecution case which go to the
roots of the prosecution case and according to
golden principle of benefit of doubt one
substantial doubt would be enough for acquittal
of the accused. The rule of benefit of doubt is
essentially a rule of prudence, which cannot be
ignored while dispensing justice in accordance
with law. Conviction must be based on
unimpeachable evidence and certainty of guilt
and any doubt arising in the prosecution case,
must be resolved in favour of the accused. The
said rule is based on the maxim “ it is better that
ten guilty persons be acquitted rather than one
innocent person be convicted” which occupied a
pivotal place in the Islamic Law and is enforced
strictly in view of the saying of the Holy Prophet
(PBUH) that the “mistake of Qazi (Judge) in
releasing a criminal is better than his mistake in
punishing an innocent”.

13. For what has been discussed above, we
allow this appeal, set aside the conviction and

sentence of the appellant recorded by the learned

11

Trial Court vide impugned judgment dated
10.06.2013 and hereby acquit him of the charge
levelled against him. He be set at liberty
forthwith, if not required in any other case.

These are reasons of our short order of
even date.

Announced
17.09.2015.
