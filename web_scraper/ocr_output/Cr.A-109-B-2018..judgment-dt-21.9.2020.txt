SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- The appellant Wakil

Khan assailed the judgment dated 25.05.2018 of learned
Additional Sessions Judge-III, Lakki Marwat, whereby the
appellant involved in case F.I.R No. 258 dated 27.07.2014,
registered at Police Station Ghazni Khel, district Lakki Marwat,
has been convicted under section 302(b) P.P.C for life
imprisonment alongwith compensation Rs.30,00000/- under
section 544-A Cr.P.C. He was further convicted under section
427/34 P.P.C and sentenced to imprisonment for two years with
fine Rs.50000/- or indefault to undergo six months SI. Both the
sentences are directed to run concurrently and benefit of section

382-B Cr.P.C was also extended in his favour.
-2-

2. The complainant also filed criminal revision
No.39-B of 2018, for enhancement of sentence of appellant.
Both, the appeal and revision petition are going to be decided

through this common judgment.

3. Brief facts of the case are that, on 27.07.2014 at
16.40 hours, complainant Sher Nawaz Khan, deceased then
injured in Civil Hospital, Lakki Marwat, reported the matter to
the local police, to the effect that he after hiring a Taxi from
Adda Tajazai were proceeding towards his village Khawaja
Khel, when they reached at metal road Zaitoon Khel Bega
Tajazai, accused/ appellant Wakil Khan and Sher Azam Khan
duly armed with pistols were present, who on seeing started
firing at him, as a result of which he got hit and injured, motorcar
was also damaged, while the driver escaped unhurt. After
commission of offence the accused decamped from the spot.
Motive was stated to be previous blood feud. Syed Azam Khan
S.H.O reduced the report of complainant in shape of Murasila
Ex: PA/1 and sent the same to the Police Station for registration
of F.LR through constable Gul Syed Shah No.270. He prepared
injury sheet Ex: PA/2, and sent the injured for medical
examination under the escort of constable Nazir No. 6590 (PW-
04). On the following day i.e. 28.07.2014 the complainant Sher

Nawaz succumbed to the injuries.

4. After completion of investigation the complete
challan was submitted before the learned trial Court on
18.08.2014 under section 512 Cr.P.C, as by then the accused

were absconding. The convict/ appellant was arrested on
-3-

28.02.2017 and after completion of necessary investigation
supplementary challan was submitted against him on 25.03.2017.
Learned trial Court after complying with the provision under
section 265-C Cr.P.C, charge sheeted the accused, to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution in order to
prove its case against the appellant produced as many as thirteen
(13) witnesses. The appellant submitted an application for
summoning PW Dr. Muneerullah, which was accepted vide
order dated 14.03.2018, he was summoned and his statement was
recorded as CW-1. On close of prosecution evidence statement
of accused/ appellant was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C,
wherein he professed innocence by refusing the allegations. He
submitted that he wanted to be examined on oath as provided
under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C and to produce defence evidence.
appellant was examined as DW-02, he produced Muhammad
Khan SI (DW-1) and Noor Aslam Khan (DW-03). After hearing
arguments of learned counsel for the parties, vide impugned
judgment dated 25.07.2018 the accused/ appellant was convicted
as mentioned above. Feeling aggrieved the appellant assailed the
same through instant criminal appeal, while the legal heirs of

deceased preferred criminal revision petition No.39-B of 2018.

5. The learned counsel representing the appellant
submitted that it was a blind murder and no witness came
forward to confirm the testimony of the deceased; and that
despite the fact the injured while reporting the matter disclosed
of a driver who was driving the motorcar at the time when the

tragedy occurred but his name was not mentioned and even the
-4-

Investigating Officer could not collect the driver to record his
statement in this respect. He further submitted that the injured
received firearm injuries on vital parts of his body and that he

could not talk, what to talk of reporting the matter.

6. Conversely, the learned counsel representing the
complainant stated that the matter was promptly reported; that
the injured was oriented in time and space and that the concerned
doctor issued a certificate in that respect. He lastly submitted that
a dying person will not tell a lie and that in case in hand

substitution is a rear phenomenon.

7. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties,
learned Addl: A.G representing the State heard and record

perused with their valuable assistance.

8. The tragic incident occurred when the deceased
was travelling in a motorcar along with a driver when the
accused/ appellant along with the absconding accused opened
indiscriminate firing at them, which resulted into injuries on
person of the deceased who got injured and was taken to D.H.Q
Hospital Lakki Marwat, where the deceased then injured
reported the matter to one Syed Azam Khan ASI, charging the
accused. The deceased succumbed to his injuries on the
following day, in which respect section 302 P.P.C was added and

as such the charge was altered.

9. The prosecution story is resting upon the dying
declaration with no further evidence and in such a situation the

courts of law must be cautious and vigilant while awarding
-5-

punishment, so to avoid miscarriage of justice. In case in hand
the learned trial Court based its decision mainly on the testimony
of the complainant who by then was injured, but this court is to
see as to whether the incident occurred in the mode, manner and
the time and as to whether the report was in fact made by the

complainant while injured.

10. The incident occurred at 15.50 hours, whereas the
matter was reported at 16.40 hours, and this promptness weighed
heavily with the trial court, resulting into conviction. The core
issue before us to resolve is as to whether the deceased then
injured was oriented in time and space and as to whether both the
doctor as well as the police official, who recorded the report
observed all the legal and codal formalities. The scribe was
examined as PW-06, who stated that while on gusht he received
information and he rushed to the hospital, where he found the
deceased then injured lying in injured condition who reported the
matter to him. This is pertinent to mention that despite the fact
that the complainant was seriously injured with having multiple
firearm injuries on his person but the scribe did not feel the need
to consult the doctor and to request a certificate as to whether the
injured by then was capable to talk and oriented in time and
space. The scribe (PW-06) stated that as the patient was
conscious and capable to talk so he did not feel the need either to
consult a doctor before the report or to ask for a certificate, the
conduct of the scribe is not only abnormal but unnatural as well.
There is no denial to the fact that the matter was reported in the

emergency room of D.H.Q Hospital, Lakki Marwat but despite
-6-

the availability of doctor and other concerned the scribe went
reckless knowing the fact that his this conduct will put a greater
impact to the prosecution case, as the only available evidence
was the statement of the complainant. The report was penned
down and the injury sheet was prepared where after the injured
was taken to the doctor for his medical examination under the
escort of one Constable Muhammad Nazir and as such the
Medical Officer examined the injured at 04.45 p.m. The medico-
legal report was prepared but the column meant for relatives was
left blank and it finds mention that the injured was brought by
constable Muhammad Nazir. We have gone through the medico-
legal report but to our utmost surprise neither the puls nor the
blood pressure finds mention, to ascertain there from as to
whether the injured was capable to talk and even the doctor did
not take the pains to opine regarding the physical condition of
the injured and to explain that whether at the time when the
injured was produced before him for medical examination, he
was oriented in time and space. The doctor was examined as
PW-05, where he admitted that neither any certificate was asked
from him nor he endorsed the injury sheet in that respect, he
went on to say that as at the time of report his opinion regarding
the capability of the injured and his physical condition was not
requested, so he did not endorse the Murasila. The injured
travelled from the spot to D.H.Q Hospital Lakki Marwat where
he was examined by PW-05, who after realizing the serious
condition of the injured referred him to Civil Hospital Bannu,

where one Dr. Munirullah (CW-01) operated him. This is
-7-

pertinent to mention that when the injured was received in Civil
Hospital, Bannu entries were made in the relevant register
regarding his arrival to the hospital and also the time of his
admission has been mentioned as 04.46 p.m. In this respect the
abstract from the relevant register are placed on file and duly
exhibited. We are yet to see that when the interse distance
between D.H.Q hospital, Lakki Marwat and Civil Hospital
Bannu, is more than 40 K.M, then how the injured was received
in Bannu at 06.46 p.m. where PW-05 has stated that at 04.45
p.m. he examined the injured in D.H.Q Lakki Marwat. Another
important aspect of the case is that PW-05 did not mention the
inner injuries of the injured rather he assessed the condition from
having a cursory look over the wounds, whereas Dr. Munirullah
who operated the injured explained that which vital organs of his
body were damaged. CW-01, was examined as Court witness
and both the sides were provided equal opportunity to cross-
examine him and both the sides tested the veracity of this witness
through cross-examination. The witness admitted the arrival of
the injured to the hospital and took the entries in the relevant
register as correct. He was further cross-examined regarding the
nature of injuries, who admitted that the injuries were received
on vital parts of body and that the patient could go into shock
within 30 minutes. The post mortem was conducted where the
doctor mentioned nearly all the major organs of his body as
damaged, and we are yet to assess as to whether a patient with
such injuries could make a coherent statement. The autopsy was

conducted on the dead-body of the deceased where the doctor
-8-

after post mortem examination declared all major vital organs of
the body, as damaged. There is another aspect of the case, which
cannot be ignored that subsequently an application was
submitted to the doctor at D.H.Q Hospital, Lakki Marwat
regarding the capability of the patient to talk. We are surprised
that what need was felt either to the scribe or to the Investigating
Officer who requested a certificate in this respect, which while
writing down the report he did not feel the need. When PW-06,
i.e. the scribe was examined he stated that as the patient was
oriented time and space, so he did not feel the need to ask for a
certificate. This fact takes up to hold that in fact the investigating
agency realized the blunder at a belated stage that’s why the need
was felt to fill up the lacunae, which could go deep to the roots
of the prosecution case. The endorsement made by the doctor
and the opinion given on the application submitted for the
purpose tells that the doctor referred to what he previously
examined and stated that he had earlier examined the patient,
where he was conscious and could talk. We scanned the record
to see as to whether any other document apart from the medical
report was also prepared, where PW-05 had given such opinion
but we failed to come across any such document, however, it was
the medico-legal report which was prepared by the doctor but he
did not mention the physical condition of the patient and the

capability to talk, therein.

11. No doubt, dying declaration is an important piece
of evidence and that sanctity is attached to the dying declaration,

because a dying man is not expected to tell lie, but it is equally

-9-

true that it is always considered as weak type of evidence being
un-tested by cross-examination, therefore, it puts the Courts on

guard and great care is demanded to ascertain that:-

1. Whether the maker has the physical
capacity to make the dying declaration.

2. Whether the maker had opportunity to
identify the assailant/assailants.

3. Whether there was a chance of mis-
identification on the part of dying man in
identifying and naming the attacker/attackers.

4. Whether it was tree from prompting
from any outside quarter; and.

5. The witness who heard the deceased making
his statement, heard him correctly and
whether this evidence can be relied upon.

12. It is universal principle of criminal justice that
dying declaration by itself is not a strong evidence being not
tested by way of cross- examination. The only reason for
accepting the same is the belief phenomenon of the court of law
that a person apprehending death due to injuries, caused to him,
is ordinarily not expected to speak a falsehood. To believe or
disbelieve a dying declaration thus is left to the ordinary human
judgment, however, the Courts always insist upon strong,
independent and reliable corroboratory evidence for the sake of
safe dispensation of justice. Relying blindly and without proper
scrutiny on such statement, would be no less dangerous approach

on the part of the Courts of law.

In case titled Mst. Ghulam Zohra and another Vs.

Malik Muhammad Sadig and another 1997 SCMR 449), it has
been held that:-

-10-

“Police Officer had not obtained
certificate from the Doctor before
recording the statement of the deceased
in an injured condition that he was ina
fit condition to give the statement, nor
he had given a plausible explanation
for such omission and fitness of the
deceased to make the statement, thus,

remained doubtful”.

13. The prosecution case is shrouded in mystery as to
who brought the injured to the hospital soon after the incident;
and that who was driving the motorcar when the deceased was
fired at, but despite thorough search we could not come across
any such evidence. The Investigating Officer visited the spot and
prepared the site-plan and also took into possession the motorcar
in which the incident had occurred. The Investigating Officer
was examined as PW-12, who stated that when he reached to the
place of incident the motorcar was left abandoned; and that
nobody was present in the surroundings. He further stated that he
took all measures to trace out the owner of the motorcar and the
person who was driving the motorcar at the time of incident, and
towards the end he succeeded to locate the owner of the motorcar
and that he disclosed the name of the driver, who was driving the
motorcar when the deceased received firearm injuries. We are
surprised that the Investigating Officer did not move an inch in
this respect, he did not try to record the statement of the owner as
well as driver of the motorcar and he did not mention his name in
the calendar of witnesses. The Investigating Officer displayed an

abnormal conduct despite the fact that he knew that it was the
-ll-

driver who could tell the truth but he did not take the pains to
investigate the case on that lines. The driver was not examined
and even he was not associated with the investigation of the case,
had he been examined he would have been the best evidence to
dig out the truth, but the Investigating Officer kept mum for
reasons best known to him. There is no cavil to the proposition
that the prosecution is to produce the best available evidence and
when disinterested evidence is not produced then the inference is
always drawn against the prosecution that had he been produced
he would have not supported the case of the prosecution. Article
129 (g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984, caters for the

situation.

In case titled “Riaz Ahmad Vs the State” (2010 SCMR

846), wherein it is held that:

“One of the eye-witnesses Manzoor
Hussain was available in the Court on
29-7-2002 but the prosecution did not
examine him, declaring him as
unnecessary witness without realizing
the fact that he was the most important,
only serving witness, being an eye-
witness of the occurrence. Therefore, his
evidence was the best piece of the
evidence, which the prosecution could
have relied upon for proving the case but
for the reasons best known, his evidence
was withheld and he was not examined.
So a presumption under Illustration (g)
of Article 129 of Qanun-e-Shahadat
Order, 1984 can fairly be drawn that had

the eye-witness Manzoor Hussain been
-12-

examined in the Court his evidence
would have been unfavourable to the

prosecution.”

14. This is intriguing to note that two persons are
charged for effective firing upon the deceased, but the post
mortem report tells that the dimension of all entry wounds is one
and the same. The doctor who conducted autopsy on the dead-
body of the deceased was examined, who confirmed the
dimension of injuries on the person of the deceased as one and
the same, in such eventuality the possibility cannot be excluded
that in fact it was the job of one person and this conflict between
the medical and ocular account is another blow to the

prosecution case.

15. The appellant soon after his arrest submitted an
application regarding his innocence to the police high ups which
was marked to the concerned Investigating Officer with
. directions to inquiry into the matter in light of the grounds taken
in the application. The investigation was conducted and the
police official recorded statements of independent witness in that
respect where it was laid open that the accused/ appellant was
not present at the place of occurrence at the time of incident.
Furthermore, the accused was examined under section 342
Cr.P.C, where too, he explained his innocence and his nexus
with the murder of the deceased. Be that as it may, once a
prosecution could not prove its case against the accused to the
hilt then the defence plea if taken by the accused whether proved

or unproved turns ineffective.

-13-

16. The learned counsel for the complainant
vehemently argued that the accused / appellant soon after
commission of the offence went into hiding and that it was in the
year 2017, he surfaced and was taken into custody. He submitted
that the long unexplained abscondence must be taken in favour
of the prosecution and should be considered a_ strong
circumstance to help in conviction. True that long unexplained
abscondence weighs against the accused, but it never absolves
the prosecution of the liability to prove its case against the
accused beyond reasonable doubt, as the prosecution is always
under the bounden duty to prove its case to the hilt and when it
proves its case through disinterested and convincing evidence
then the abscondence is taken and considered as a corroborative
piece of evidence, but in case in hand the prosecution could not
succeed in proving its case against the appellant and in such

eventuality abscondence alone plays no role.

In case titled "Liagat Hussain _and_others Vs

Falak Sher and others" (2003 SCMR 611(a), wherein it has
been held:-

"(a) _Eye-witnesses including _ the
complainant had failed to furnish a
plausible and acceptable explanation for
being present on the scene of occurrence
and were chance witnesses---Prosecution
case did not inspire confidence and fell for
short of sounding probable to a man of
reasonable prudence---Abscondence of

accused in such circumstances could not

i
!
i
-14-

offer any useful corroboration to the case

of prosecution"

17. The motive was given as blood feud between the
parties and it was stressed time and again that the appellant had
the motive to commit the offence, but we cannot ignore that
motive is a double edged weapon which cuts either way. The
prosecution could not produce convincing evidence in this
respect and even the Investigating Officer did not record the
statements of independent witnesses which could prove the
motive on record. True that in each and every case the
prosecution is not required to prove the motive and that its
absence or failure will not help the accused/ appellant but
equally true that once the prosecution alleges a motive then it is
under obligation to prove the same failing which none else but
the prosecution will suffer, as is held in case titled "Hakim Ali
Vs. The State" (1971 SCMR-432), that the prosecution though
not called upon to establish motive in every case, yet once it has
setup a motive and failed to establish, the prosecution must
suffer consequences and not the defence. The above view has

been reiterated in the case of "Amin Ullah Vs. The State"

(PLD _1976 SC_ 629), wherein, it has been observed by their
lordships, that motive is an important constituent and if found by
the Court to be untrue, the Court should be on guard to accept
the prosecution story. It was again re-enforced by the august
Supreme Court in the case of "Muhammad _Sadiq_Vs.
Muhammad Sarwar" (1997 SCMR 214). Again on the same

principle, case laws titled Noor Muhammad Vs. The State and

ee ee

“4

-15-

another" (2010 SCMR 997) and "Amin Ali and another Vs.
The State" (2011 SCMR-323) can also be referred.

18. After evaluating the evidence from all angles this
Court reaches to an inescapable conclusion that the prosecution
has miserably failed to prove its case against accused/appellant.
Resultantly, this appeal is, therefore, allowed, the conviction and
sentence of the appellant recorded by the learned trial court is
set-aside and he is acquitted of the charges by extending him the
benefit of doubt, he shall be released forth with from jail, if not
required to be detained in connection with any other case. As the
appeal has been allowed so Cr. R No.39 -B of 2018 stands

dismissed.

19. Above are the reasons of our short order of the
even date.
