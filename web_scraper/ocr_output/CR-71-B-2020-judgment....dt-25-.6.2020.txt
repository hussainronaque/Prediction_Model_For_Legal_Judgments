CR No. 71-B/2020

Present: Mr. Mukhtiyar Ali Khan Khattak,
Advocate for petitioners.

KA
Sahibzada Asadullah, J.- Through this Civil
Revision petition, petitioners have challenged vires of
judgment dated 29.6.2019 passed by the learned Civil
Judge-III, Karak, whereby preliminary decree of
redemption was granted in favour of
respondents/plaintiffs and judgment dated 21.01.2020 of
learned Additional District Judge-II, Karak who
dismissed appeal of petitioners.
2. Brief facts arising out of this Revision
Petition are that the petitioner filed a suit against
petitioners for possession through redemption of
property measuring 03 kanal 04 marla situated at Mouza
Esak Tehsil and District Karak detail whereof was fully
given in the headnote of the plaint. It is averred in the
plaint that originally the ownership of predecessor in
interest of respondents/plaintiffs namely Lal etc. who
transferred the suit property by way of mortgage in

favour of Ramzan and Khushamad sons of Azam

through his paternal uncle Fateh Raz. The suit property

-2-

was mortgaged for period of eight years against
mortgaged money of Rs. 15 (Kabuli) British currency.
The said mortgagees subsequently transferred the
mortgaged rights by way of sale in favour of two
persons namely Farhad Jan son of Mangal Jan and
Majan son of Bakhmal vide mutation No. 9049 dated
25.5.1966. The respondents/plaintiffs after death of their
predecessor requested the defendants for redemption of
the suit property subject to payment of mortgaged
money but they refused. After service of summon, the
suit was vehemently opposed by the petitioners while
submitting their written statement, controverting the
facts as alleged by the petitioners in their plaint. The
learned trial court vide impugned judgment dated
29.6.2019 passed preliminary decree of redemption in
favour of respondents/plaintiff. Not contented with the
said judgment and decree, the petitioners filed RCA,
which was dismissed by learned Additional District
Judge-II, Karak vide judgment dated 21.01.2020, hence,
this Revision Petition.

3. The contention of learned counsel for the
petitioners is that the evidence available on record has
not been examined by both the learned Courts below in
its true perspective and the issues have not been decided
in accordance therewith, therefore, the judgments
impugned are not sustainable in the eye of law.

Regarding question of limitation, learned counsel for the

-3-

petitioners has contended that it stood established from
record that the suit was hopelessly time barred, as the
suit property was mortgaged eight years prior to
settlement of 1886-87, therefore, the instant suit was
not redeemable and the respondents/plaintiffs were not
entitled to get the decree whereas both the learned
Courts below have committed material illegality and
irregularity while deciding this particular issue against

the defendants-petitioners and in this respect, evidence

available on record has not been taken into
consideration resulting in miscarriage of justice.

4. Arguments heard and record perused.

5. Considering the arguments and perusing
the record made available, it is observed that initially
the respondents/plaintiffs had instituted a suit seeking
declaration regarding suit property alleging that the suit
property was never mortgaged by their predecessor and
the entries prevailing in the revenue record are
fraudulently made, which suit was dismissed vide
judgment dated 14.9.2009 for the reason that period of
limitation for seeking redemption is sixty years, whereas

the respondents/plaintiffs have challenged a hundred

years old document with malafide intention to cover the
period of limitation. It is pertinent to mention that a civil
suit No. 58/1 of 2000 was filed on behalf of

predecessor of the parties Mir Gul shah and Roshan Gul

sons of Mughal Seeking redemption of the suit property

-4-
[but subsequently this suit was dismissed as withdrawn |
with the permission to file afresh suit on the ground that
at the time of mortgage of the suit property their
ancestor Mughal was minor, therefore, they intend to
challenge the mortgaged mutation on the ground that
contract on behalf of a minor was not valid.

6. In evidence, it is unequivocally

demonstrated that as per Ex.PW-1/1 & Ex.PW-1/2, the

plaintiff Roshan Gui is entered as owner mortgagor of

suit Khata No. 711 whereas Khush Lisan son of Jalat
Khan etc are entered as mortgagee. The record further
tells that Ex.PW-2/1 to Ex.PW-2/26, the suit property
mentioned in khasra No. 452 measuring 02 kanal 17
marla is entered in the names of Mughal etc as
owners/mortgagors whereas Khushamand son of Azam
as mortgagee for Rs. 15/- through verbal deed for an
indefinite period.

7. At this juncture it may be expedient to

reproduce the provisions of Section 60 of the Transfer
of Property Act 1882 which reads below:-

“60. Right of mortgagor to redeem: At
any time after the principal money has
become due, the mortgagor has a right,
on payment or tender, at the proper
time and place, of the mortgage-
money, to require the mortgagee (a) to
deliver to the mortgagor the
mortgaged-deed and all documents
relating to the mortgaged property
which are in the possession or power of
the mortgagee, (b) where the
mortgagee is in possession of the
mortgaged property, to deliver
possession thereof to the mortgagor,
and (c) at the cost of the mortgagor
either to re-transfer the mortgaged
property to him or to such third person

as he may direct, or to execute and

-5-

(where the mortgage has been effected
by a registered instrument) to have
registered an acknowledgment in
writing that any right is derogation of
his interest transferred to the mortgagee
has been extinguished:

Provided that the right conferred by this
section has not been extinguished by the
act of the parties or by decree of a
Court.

The right conferred by this section is
called a right to redeem and a suit to
enforce it is called a suit for redemption.

Nothing in this section shall be deemed
to render invalid any provision to the
effect that, if the time fixed for
payment of the principal money has
been allowed to pass or no such time
has been fixed, the mortgagee shall be
entitled to reasonable notice before
payment or tender of such money.
Redemption of portion of mortgaged
property. Nothing in this section shall
entitle a person interested in a share
only of the mortgaged property to
redeem his own share only, on payment
of a proportionate part of the amount
remaining due on the mortgage, except
only where a mortgagee, or, if there
are more mortgagees than one, all such
mortgagees, has or have acquired, in
whole or in part, the share of a
mortgagor.”

The expression of provisions supra affirms
the right of redemption in all mortgages and no clog can
be put against such statutory right and possession of
mortgagee over property remained as mortgagee and
would not stand converted into possession as owners
thereof. In terms of Section 60 of the Transfer of
Property Act 1882 the right of redemption is statutory
right. Besides it is also a rule of justice, equity and good
conscience. It has been variously held by the Superior

Courts that any clog on redemption of the mortgage will

-6-

be invalid being violative to the law and equity. Section |
60 of the Act ibid unequivocally affirms the right of
redemption in all mortgages following the principle
‘once a mortgage always a mortgage’. Reliance be made
upon Suleman and 3 others Vs. Custodian, Evacuee
Property, West Pakistan, Lahore and 2 others (PLD
1971 Lahore 77).

8. As regards the point of limitation and
laches suffice to say that once it is held that the disputed
transaction is one of the mortgage and not the absolute
sale the refusal to get the property redeemed therefore
becomes recurring wrong on the part of the mortgagee
for which the principle of laches is not attracted at all.
Reliance be made upon Mr.Fazlul Quader Chowdhry
and others Vs. Mr.Muhammad Abdul Haque (PLD
1963 Supreme Court 486). Besides it is pertinent to
mention that when a matter is referable to the law of
limitation the question of laches looses significance. In
the attending circumstances of this case no period of
limitation would run against the
respondents/mortgagors. The property can be get
redeemed by the respondents/mortgagor at any stage
without mischief of the law of limitation barring
redemption after the passage of sixty years in terms of
Article 158 of the Limitation Act 1908. Reliance be
made upon Abdul Haq Vs. Ali Akbar and 12 others (1998

CLC 129 Peshawar).

9. Even otherwise, concurrent findings of
facts cannot be upset by this Court in its revisional
jurisdiction in a casual manner rather it has to be proved
that the same are perverse or arbitrary or the same are
based on misreading or non-reading of evidence. It is

also settled law that finding on question of fact or law,

erroneous the same may be, recorded by the court of
competent jurisdiction, cannot be interfered with by the
High Court in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction
under section 115 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 unless
such findings suffer from controversial defects,
illegality or material irregularity as law lad down

10. The above portrayal and discussion lead
me to the conclusion that learned Courts below have
properly exercised the jurisdiction vested in them and
the orders passed are in conformity with the law to
which no exception can be taken. This Revision Petition
has no force and therefore, the same is hereby dismissed

in limine with no order as to costs.
