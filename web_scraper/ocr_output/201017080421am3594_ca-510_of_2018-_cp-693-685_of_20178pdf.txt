judgment of acquittal of learned trial Court in favour of
respondent to the said extent and the case was remanded to
the learned trial Court to proceed in terms of Section 8 of the
Tegal Dispossession Act. In the memo of instant petition,
the petitioner has challenged the impugned judgment to the
extent of not convicting and not awarding punishment to the
respondents in terms of sections 3/4 of the Illegal
Dispossession Act, 2005.
2. After hearing the learned counsel for the
petitioner and learned counsel for respondents No. 1 to 4 at
length and perusal of available record, it has been observed
by us that the petitioner filed a complaint under section 3 of
the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 before the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Mardan. After due Process,
the respondents were summoned and were charge sheeted.
The evidence was recorded and on conclusion of trial, the
learned trial Court, vide its judgment dated 28.02.2015,
dismissed the complaint of the petitioner with the following

observations:-

“16. As per available record, the dispossession of
the complainant from the impugned land has not
been established as the essential ingredients
required to prove on record are (1) That land was
in possession of complainant (2) that complainant
was illegally without due Process of law was
dispossessed Jrom the said land with the specific
reference of time and date.

17. In the light of my above discussion, the
xinstant complaint is dismissed being not proved

3. Having gone through the evidence available on
record, it has been observed by us that the findings of
acquittal rendered by the learned trial Court are based on
proper appreciation of evidence available on record and the
learned High Court has rightly not interfered with the
aforesaid findings. Even before this Court, learned counsel
for the petitioner was not able to establish the lawful
possession of the disputed land by the petitioner or that he
was illegally dispossessed by the respondents. In these
circumstances, the instant petition is without merit, which is
dismissed accordingly. Leave to appeal is refused.

4. Through this petition, petitioner Zigrawar @
Aigre and others (respondents in the connected petition)
have called in question the judgment dated 06.04.2018,
whereby the criminal appeal filed by the respondent No.1
Roidad Khan (petitioner in the connected petition) against
the acquittal of petitioners (herein) was disposed of. The
learned High Court while passing the impugned judgment
did not interfere with the findings of acquittal rendered by
the learned trial Court, however, made the following
observations, against which the instant petition is directed:-

“15. Therefore, for the aforestated reasons, this
aeeppeal is -digposed of in terms that property

under consideration, shall be restored to the

* appellant in terms of section 8 of the IMlegal
Dispossession Act. The impugned judgment is
modified to such extent and the case is remanded
to learned trial Court to proceed in terms of
section 8 of the Illegal Dispossession Act, in order
to deliver the property to appellant. In case of any
hurdle, resistance either by respondents or any
other person on their behalf, the learned trial
Court shall exercise its jurisdiction under sub-
section (2) of section 8 of the Act, in order to direct
the officer-in-charge of the concerned police
station for such assistance necessary for
restoration of the possession of the property to the
appellant.”

5. After hearing the learned counsel for the
petitioner and learned counsel for respondent No.1
(petitioner in the connected petition) at length, and perusal
of available record, it has been observed by us that the
petitioners earned their acquittal after regular trial by the
learned trial Court. The learned trial Court has also observed
in its judgment that the dispossession of the respondent
No.1 from the impugned land has not been established. Even
before this Court, learned counsel for respondent No.1
(petitioner in the connected petition) was not able to point
out anything from the record to show that the disputed land
was under his lawful possession at the relevant time and
that he was unlawfully dispossessed from the said land. In
these circumstances, the observation of the learned High
Court in the impugned judgment to the extent of restoration
of disputed property to respondent No.1 in terms of section 8

*of the Illegal Dispossession Act (Para 15 as reproduced

above) is uncalled for. Therefore, the instant criminal
petition is converted into an appeal and the same is partly
allowed. The observation given by the learned High Court to
the extent of restoration of disputed property to respondent
No.1 in terms of section 8 of the Illegal Dispossession Act, (in
Para 15 of the impugned judgment) is set aside. During the
course of arguments, it has been stated by the learned
counsel for the petitioners that qua the title of the disputed
land, litigation on civil side is pending between the parties.
In these circumstances, it is made clear that the
observations given in the instant judgment, any observations
made in the impugned judgment or in the judgment of the
learned trial Court will not, in any manner, prejudice the
case(s) of either of the parties, if so pending before any
forum.

Disposed of in terms noted above.
