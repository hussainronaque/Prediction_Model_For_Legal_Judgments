Date of hearing: 09.04.2021

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, L.- Gul Shah Peeri,
the petitioner herein, seeks her post arrest bail in a case FIR
No.61, dated 17.03.2021, under sections 302/109 PPC,
registered at Police Station Teri, District Karak. The
allegations against her, in brief, are that she had abetted
co-accused Muhammad Naseer son of Akhri Gul to commit
the murder of Zeetullah on 02.03.2021. Earlier, she
approached to the lower forum for the same relief; however,
her application for bail was dismissed by learned Additional
Sessions Judge, Banda Daud Shah, District Karak, hence,
instant bail application.

02. Facts of the case, as reflected from the record, are that
Muhammad Ishaq had contracted two marriages with Mst.
Khatmana and Gul Shah Peeri (the accused-petitioner).
Deceased Zaitullah was the son of Muhammad Ishaq from

Mst. Khatmana. Co-accused Muhammad Nasir is the son of
Akhri Gul, the brother of Muhammad Ishaq. On 02-03-2021,
one Spin Zad Gul son of Sucha Gul in the causality of Civil
Hospital, Teri, lodged a report to the local Police that he was
present in his house, situated at Urmer, when received
information that his nephew Zeetullah has attempted to
commit suicide by firing at him. He rushed to the place of
occurrence, where he found Zaitullah in injured condition. He
was put in a Suzuki while on the way to Hospital Terri; the
injured succumbed to his injuries. The complainant stated in
his report that father of the deceased was in Dubai in
connection with his livelihood while mental condition of the
deceased was stated to be deranged. So, in the backdrop,
inquiry under section 174(3)Cr.P.C was started. During
inquiry, on 17-03-2021, the complainant, Mst Khatmana and
Muhammad Asif recorded their statements under section 164
of Cr. P.C, wherein they stated that the deceased was done to
death by Muhammad Nasir at the instigation of the accused-
petitioner Shah Peeri. Motive for the commission of offence
was stated to be the preventing of co-accused Muhammad
Naseer from frequent visit by the deceased to the house of
accused-petitioner.

03. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the
accused-petitioner has falsely been roped in the instant case
for the only reason that she is the step mother of the deceased.
He contended that it was an unseen occurrence and the

accused-petitioner was charged for the commission of offence
not only after 16 days of the occurrence but also without
disclosing any source of satisfaction. According to him, the
deceased was not only mentally disabled but the fact of
suicide has also been disclosed by the complainant in his first
report, thus, being two versions case, it is of further inquiry.
The petitioner is behind the bars along with her suckling baby
since her arrest and the welfare of the minor is also
incompatible to the jail life and on this score too, the
petitioner is entitled to the concession of bail, he lastly added.
In support of his arguments, he placed reliance on the case
law reported as 2017 P Cr. LJ Note 50, 2012 P Cr. LJ 841,
PLD 2018 Peshawar 138, 2011 YLR_2975 and 2020 P Cr
LJ Note 90.

Conversely, Learned AAG assisted by learned counsel
for the complainant contended that, though, the petitioner has
been charged after 15/16 days of occurrence, but it is visible
from the record that father of deceased was in Dubai and after
his arrival, after due satisfaction of the complainant, mother
of the deceased and brother have recorded their statements.
They contended that the medical as well as other material so
far collected by the investigating agency also belied the stand
of suicide. In support of their submissions, they relied on
PLD 1997 SC 545, Unreported judgment in Cr. Mise.
(BA) No. 210-B of 2014 dated 03-09-2014.

04. I have considered the submissions of learned counsel

for the parties and gone through record of the case.
.

5. Admittedly, the petitioner is charged for abetment
under section 109 PPC and that too without source of
information or satisfaction. The petitioner was arrested in the
case and remained in police custody but she did not confess
her guilt. She belongs to the fair sex and is behind the bars
along with her suckling daughter, aged about 14 months,
since her arrest. The concept of ‘welfare of minor’ is surely
incompatible with jail life, so, on this score also, she is
entitled to the concession of bail because instead of detaining
the innocent infant in the jail for indefinite period for the
crime allegedly committed by her mother (the accused-
petitioner), particularly, when husband of the petitioner is in
Dubai in connection with his livelihood, so, in this state of
affairs, there would be no one to look after the baby outside
the jail premises. In the famous case of Ghamidiyyah, our
Holy Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H) was pleased to suspend
the sentence of a pregnant woman not only till the delivery of
child but also postponed it till the period of ‘Riza’ i.e.,
lactation period”. This principle was followed by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in case titled Mst. Nusrat_vs. The State
(1996 SCMR 973), wherein it has been observed that instead
of detaining the innocent child/infant in the Jail for the crime
allegedly committed by his mother, it would be in the interest
of justice as well as welfare of minor that the mother be
released from Jail. Hon’ able the Lahore High Court in the

case of Sadiq Waqas vs. The State and another (2012
PCr.LJ_ 841) as well as this court in case titled Mst. Shhnaz

Versus the State and another, decided on 02.06.2017, in

Cr.Misc.(BA) No. 1023-P/2017 also followed the above
principle. .

06. Therefore, without touching other aspects of the case
lest it prejudice the case of either side, while driving guidance
from case law, supra, the petition for the grant of bail is
allowed, resultantly, the petitioner is directed to be released
on bail subject to furnishing bail bond in the sum of Rs:
2,00,000/- (two lac) with two sureties, each in the like
amount, to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/Duty Judicial Magistrate.

Above are the detailed reasons of my short order of

even date. eo
