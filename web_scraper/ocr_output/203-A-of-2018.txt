SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- |n a trial conducted
by the learned Sessions Judge Abbottabad,
appellant Hashim, aged about 31 years, was
found guilty of committing rape with Mst.
Tahira Sarfaraz (complainant), thus, he was
sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for ten
(10) years with a fine of Rs.50,000/- or in
default of payment of fine to suffer further six
(06) months S.I under Section 376 PPC and
to one year R.I with a fine of Rs.10,000/- or in
default of payment of fine to six (06) months
S.| under Section 342 PPC. The fine, if
realized, was ordered to be paid to the victim.
Similarly, in the same trial, appellant Tanveer,
aged about 24 years, was also found guilty of
facilitating the offence to one year R.I with a

fine of Rs.10,000/- or in default to suffer
further six (06) months S.I under Section 109
PPC. Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C was
extended to both the appellants. Since the
appellants have filed their separate appeals,
therefore, through this single judgment we
shall also decide Cr.Appeal No. 197-A/2018
tiled “Tanveer Vs. The State & another”
being the outcome of one and the same
impugned judgment dated 23.10.2018.

2. The incident took place’ on
22.12.2016 at 08:00 A.M inside the shop
allegedly owned by accused Tanveer. The
report was lodged by the complainant Mst.
Tahira Sarfaraz (PW-8) on 26.12.2016 at
19:40 hours at Police Station Donga Gali
Tehsil and District Abbottabad. The distance
between the police station and place of
occurrence is 25 / 26 kilometers.

3. The prosecution case is that Mst.
Tahira Sarfaraz d/o Sarfaraz (complainant /
victim) submitted an application to the effect
that she is a student of 7" class at
Government Middle School Pirkot. As
routine, after working hours, a student used

to be deputed for cooking of food on daily
basis. One month prior to the occurrence,
when she went inside the kitchen for cooking
food, teacher Hashim entered into the
kitchen, locked it and took her snapshots and
asked her to keep her mouth shut, otherwise,
he would upload her snapshots on internet
and she would also be expelled from school,
whereupon she kept mum. After a few days,
he called her in his office and obtained her
signature on a blank paper posing it to be an
admission form. On 22.12.2016, at about
08:00 A.M Hashim accused called her
through watchman for bringing milk from shop
of co-accused Tanveer. Hashim asked her
that the document over which her signature
was obtained was the Nikah Nama form and
now she is his legally wedded wife. He
undressed her forcibly and committed Zina
with her by use of force. On her hue and cry
Nazir and Riaz, associate teachers came
there, beat Hashim, whereafter he decamped
from the spot. She put on her clothes and
proceeded to house. Her mother took her to
her father, who was serving in Pak Army at

Kharian. On return, she lodged the report,
which was incorporated into FIR. She was
referred to BBS Teaching Hospital
Abbottabad, where she was_ medically

examined on 27.12.2016 and observed as

under: -
“Conscious, well oriented in
date and place. No mark of
violence or resistance on any
part of body or clothes.”

4. On 30.12.2016, accused Hashim

was examined by Dr. Muhammad _ Irshad
(PW-13) and found him fit to do sexual
intercourse, his report was exhibited as
Ex.PW-10/8. Ex.PW-7/1 is the medico-legal
report of the complainant / victim. According
to report of Radiologist Ex.PW-10/2
complainant was aged about seventeen and a
half years. Muhammad Khalid, ASI, (PW-10)
arrested the appellant Hashim on 29.12.2016.
5. In order to prove its case, the
prosecution examined as many as thirteen
(13) witnesses. Sabir Khan, SI (PW-2) only
recorded FIR Ex.PA. Amjad, Constable, is
witness of recovery memo Ex.PW-3/1 vide

which lady doctor handed over three swab
tubes sealed in Khaki envelop for DNA to ASI
Donga Gali. Abdul Shakoor (PW-4) is witness
of recovery memo Ex.PW-4/1 vide which
doctor handed over to him a phial 3cc for
onward transmission for DNA and cross
match. Asim (PW-5) brought the docket,
which he incorporated in the entry of two
parcels in Register No.5/21 Ex.PW-5/1,
whereafter, he handed over the same to
constable Tufail for sending the same to FSL
Islamabad. Tariq Zaman, Constable No. 697
9PW-6) is marginal witness of recovery memo
through which doctor handed over 3cc blood
for onward transmission for DNA test
alongwith swabs of victim. The recovery
memo was exhibited as Ex.PW-6/1. PW-7
and PW-13 are the medical officers, gist of
whose statements have been given whereas
Mst. Tahira Sarfaraz, complainant, appeared
as PW-8 and supported the contents of FIR.
Muhammad Riaz (PW-9) the alleged
eyewitness of the occurrence was declared
hostile, he was cross-examined by the
learned counsel for the complainant as well

as defence counsels. The second eyewitness
of the occurrence namely, Nazir Ahmad was
given up by the prosecution on the ground of
having been won over. Muhammad Khalid,
ASI (PW-10) investigated the case and after
completion of investigation handed over the
case file to PW-1 for submission of challan.
Muhammad Amin (PW-11) and Muhammad
Zareen (PW-12) are witnesses of pointation
memo Ex.PW-10/31 vide which Tanveer
pointed out the place of occurrence to the 1.0.
The accused when examined denied the
charge and pleaded innocence, however, did
not produce evidence in defence.

6. It has been argued by learned
counsels for the appellants that appellants are
innocent and have falsely been implicated in
the case; that complainant i.e. alleged victim
was sixteen (16) years of age at the time of
occurrence; that the prosecution has failed to
bring home the guilt of the accused beyond a
ray of doubt; that the medico-legal report
does not support the version of the
complainant; that there is inordinate delay in
lodging the report; that evidence so furnished

is not sufficient to sustain conviction; that PW-
9 Muhammad Riaz did not support the stance
of the complainant and prayed for acquittal of
the accused by extending benefit of doubt.

7. On the other hand, learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the complainant and
the learned Assistant Advocate General,
representing the State, jointly argued that
statement of victim is straightforward and
rings true; that complainant is aged about 13 /
14 years, she has got no ill will or personal
enmity with the accused to falsely implicate
them; that appellant Hashim is attached to a
noble and sacred profession and was
supposed to impart knowledge to the students
not to outrage their modesty; that all the
prosecution witnesses are consistent on the
manner, mode, time and place of occurrence,
they were cross-examined at length but no
dent could be caused in their statements; that
prosecution has proved its case beyond a ray
of doubt and that the impugned judgment
needs no interference.

8. We have heard the arguments of
learned counsel for the parities and scanned

the record with their valuable assistance.
9. In our opinion Mst. Tahir Sarfaraz,
complainant, at the time of alleged
occurrence was not below the age of sixteen
(16) years as stated by her and recorded by
the investigating officer. According to report of
Radiologist Ex.PW-10/2, she is seventeen
and half years (17%) old. Although lady
Doctor Shaheen Mahtab stated that she was
aged about 13 / 14 years, she admitted in
cross examination that her age was written as
13 / 14 years at the instance of Investigating
Officer, however, the determination of age by
medical officer is always probable
determination and one cannot say with
certainty about the age of the person
examined by the medical officer. Thus,
keeping in view report of Radiologist, we hold
that Mst. Tahira Sarfaraz was above sixteen
(16) years of age at the time of occurrence.

10. We have’ gone. through the
statements of the victim (Mst. Tahira
Sarfaraz) and lady Doctor. The medical
evidence Ex.PW-7/1 shows that there are no
marks of violence or injury on any part of the

body of victim. Her hymen was found torn, but
it was an old tear, admitting two fingers with
slight difficulty. According to the allegation of
the victim, her clothes were removed by the
accused Hashim forcibly and thereafter he
committed Zina-Bil-Jabar with her, but despite
that neither her clothes were torn nor any
injury was given nor any resistance was found
on her body or clothes by the lady Doctor nor
any sign of resistance was found or observed
on the scene of crime by the |.O during spot
inspection.

11. Another important aspect of the case
is that PW-7, the lady doctor, who examined
Tahira Sarfaraz, while answering to a
question stated in cross-examination that the
mention of old healed tear of hymen means
that the first sexual contact took place with
the victim more than two weeks back as this
tear heals within two weeks. Admittedly, she
was examined on 27.02.2016, seven (07)
days after the occurrence. The above
discussion leads us to the conclusion that
occurrence has not taken place in the
manner, mode, place and time as described

by the prosecution.
10

12. We also noticed that the lady Doctor
had taken her swabs from posterior fornix and
cervix in three tubes and handed over the
same for detection of semen and DNA.
However, it was returned with the observation
that possibility of semen detection for vaginal
swabs sample of victim after three (03) days
is very rare as is depicted from letter Ex.PW-
10/24 and Ex.PW-10/26. No doubt, she was
examined seven (07) days after the
occurrence, but it is known phenomena /
proposition, that semen remains active and
alive upto 17 days at the best. In this respect
reliance can be placed on the judgment
reported as 2002 P.Cr.L.J 831 Mst. Sherman
Vs. The State. Though in the instant case
she was examined seven (07) days after the
occurrence but despite that the report of
swabs and DNA was not given.

13. Now adverting to statement of
Muhammad Riaz, the eyewitness of the
alleged occurrence, who appeared as PW-9.
The second eyewitness Nazir was abandoned
on his being won over. In this case, at the

relevant stage when examination in chief of
11

PW-9 was being recorded, the complainant
side felt that PW is speaking in a different
tone, which is not favourable to the
prosecution, the learned counsel for the
complainant requested that the witness may
be declared hostile. After due hearing and
perusing the record, he was declared hostile
and the parties were given opportunity to
cross-examine him. We have gone through
his statement minutely to adjudge the
credibility and veracity of his statement. It is
by now established that statement of such
witness cannot be discarded altogether and
has to be considered like the evidence of any
other witness, but with a caution. In this
context reliance can well be placed on the
judgments reported as Zahid Khan Vs. Gul
Sher and another 1972 SCMR_ 597,
Muhammad Sadiq Vs. Muhammad Sarwar
1979 SCMR 214. After perusal of the
statement of Muhammad Riaz (PW-9), we
came to the conclusion that despite
opportunity of cross-examination this witness
was not confronted with his earlier statement

recorded under Section 161  Cr.P.C.
12

Furthermore, nowhere he stated that he had
seen the accused Hashim committing Zina
with Tahira Sarfaraz. Thus, evaluation of
entire evidence available on the record leads
us to the irresistible conclusion that there is
no corroboration to the statement of Mst.
Tahira Sarfaraz.

14. There is delay of six (06) days in
lodging of the FIR. Mst. Tahira Sarfaraz has
stated in her statement that after the
occurrence, she came to her house, her
mother took her to her father at Kharian,
thereafter, they came back to Abbottabad on
27.12.2016 and lodged the report. In support
of her this stance neither her mother nor her
father was produced by the prosecution we
are afraid, this explanation is too common to
be given weight.

15. Now adverting to pointation of the
accused Tanveer. Nothing was recovered or
discovered or nothing new was added on his
pointation, therefore, the same does not carry
weight.

16. Coming to charge against accused

Tanveer, he was charged for facilitating the
13

crime. Neither it was proved through evidence
that the shop in question belongs to him nor
PW-9 stated in his statement that he closed
the door of the shop and facilitated the crime.
Even otherwise, the prosecution has failed to
prove the main charge against principal
accused Hashim, therefore, conviction and
sentence under Section 109 PPC is not
sustainable against accused Tanveer.

17. The basic principle of Sharia law is
that the conviction must be based on
evidence beyond any shadow of doubt. The
principle can be deduced from an undisputed
Hadith: -

“Ayesha reported that the
Massenger of Allah said ‘Drive
off the ordained crimes from
the Muslims as for as you can.
If there is any place of refugee
for him, let him have his way,
because the leader's mistake
in pardon is better than his
mistaken in punishment:
Mishkatul Msabili (Eng.
Translation by Fazi-ul-Karim)
Vol.Il,P.544 Law Publishing

Company, Lahore.”
14

18. Because the damage resulting from
erroneous sentence is_ irreversible. The
principle that it is better to acquit a guilty
person than to punish an innocent one had
been proclaimed by the Holly Prophet of
Islam fourteen hundred (1400) years ago has
now become the guiding principle for the safe
administration of justice.

19. For the reasons stated hereinabove,
we do not uphold the conviction of the
appellants and allow this and the connected
appeal, set-aside their conviction and
sentences and acquit them of the charges,
levelled against them by extending them
benefit of doubt. They be set at liberty

forthwith, if not required in any other case.
