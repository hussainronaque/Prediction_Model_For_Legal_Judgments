Complainant: Nemo

Mohib Ali (appellant) had faced trial in case FIR No.
437 (PA/1) recorded on 01.12.2010 under Sections 302/34
PPC at police station Sadar District Rajanpur on the
complaint of Habib-ur-Rehman (Pw-6) for the allegations of
commission of rape and Qatal-e-Amad' of Javeria (aged 7/8
years). During investigation Section 376-A PPC was also

appellant. It is important to mention here that as appellant
was Juvenile’ so trial was conducted by the learned Sessions
Judge as Juvenile Court whereas his co-accused Qasim Ali
was tried by the same court in its ordinary jurisdiction. It
will not be out of context to refer here that Qasim Ali was
acquitted from the case.

3. Facts of the case are that on 01.12.2010 Muhammad
Sharif Sub Inspector (Pw-9) on receipt of information of this
occurrence arrived in the area of Asni where Habib-ur-
Rehman (Pw-6) made a statement (PA). He maintained that
Javeria aged about 7/8 years was her daughter; on
30.11.2010, when in the evening he returned to his house his
daughter was missing; search was started and announcement
was also made from the loudspeakers of the mosque but of
no consequence; on the second day (01.12.2010) at about
07:30 am he along with Abdul Qadir (Pw-7) Bilal (not
produced) and others during search, when arrived at the
graveyard, they found the dead body of Javeria; there was
strangulation around her neck with her Shalwar* and also
blood on her private part of the body.

4. After endorsement, Muhammad Sharif SI sent the
complaint to police station on the basis of which FIR (PA/1)
was recorded by Zafar Hussain SI (Pw-1).

5. Appellant was arrested on 17.01.2011. During
investigation, according to prosecution, appellant made a
confession before Mr. Irfan Ahmad learned Magistrate (Pw-
11). In the process of investigation also Abdul Qadir (Pw-7)
and Bilal claimed that in the evening of 30.11.2010 they had
seen the appellant and his co-accused Qasim Ali where
Javeria was also present and they were giving a fruit (guava)
to her. On the basis of said material the report under Section

173 Cr.P.C (Challan) was submitted in Court.

Juvenile Justice System Ordinance , 2000) {since repealed under Section 25 of the Juvenile Justice System Act, XXII
of 2018}.

6. A charge under Sections 302/364-A/376(ii)/34 PPC
was framed against appellant which he pleaded not guilty
and demanded his trial.

7. In support of its case prosecution had produced Zafar
Hussain SI/author of FIR (Pw-1), Dr. Muhammad Rizwan
(Pw-2), Asghar Ali/draftsman (Pw-3), Khalil Ahmad HC/
Moharrar (Pw-4), Khalid Hussain/Constable (Pw-5), Habib-
ur-Rehman/complainant (Pw-6), Abdul Qadir (Pw-7),
Ghulam Akbar/Constable (Pw-8), Muhammad Sharif SI/IO
(Pw-9), Lady Doctor Mah Jabeen (Pw-10) and Mr. Irfan
Ahmad Magistrate (Pw-11).

8. Bilal Hasani being unnecessary was given up by the
learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor, who after
producing the report of Chemical Examiner (PM) had closed
the prosecution’s evidence.

9. In his examination made under Section 342 Cr.P.C,
version of appellant was as under: -

“It is an unseen occurrence. No PW had
seen the occurrence. PWs are related inter
se so they are interested witnesses and they
have deposed against me falsely only to
strengthen the prosecution case. My
maternal uncle (Mamoo) Sarwar is brother-
in-law of complainant. I am an orphan and
only the bread winner of my family
including three sisters. Master Faiz father of
prosecution witness Bilal Hasani had
demanded the hand of my sister for his son
prior to the occurrence but I had refused to
give the same, so they had grudge against
me and falsely involved me in this unseen
occurrence ”

10. Appellant opted not to produce defence evidence or to
appear in terms of Section 340(2) Cr.P.C.

11. Both learned counsel for appellant jointly contend that
it is a case of circumstantial evidence based on weak
testimony of Abdul Qadir (Pw-7) therefore, conviction of
appellant cannot sustain. They further add that so-called

confession of appellant is suffering from serious infirmities
Criminal Appeal No. 13-J of 2014 4
Mohib Ali vs. The State

and illegalities which under no circumstance can be a base
for conviction of appellant.

12. On the other hand, learned ADPP in an emotional
manner maintains that a girl of 7/8 years of age was not only
committed to rape but murdered without any sin, so the
appellant deserves no leniency; there was no enmity
whatsoever of the private witnesses with the appellant,
hence question of false involvement does not arise; Abdul
Qadir (Pw-7) who had seen the appellant and his co-accused
with the deceased on 30.11.2010 in the evening is a credible
witness and his testimony cannot be thrown out of
consideration; prosecution on the strength of qualitative
evidence was succeeded to prove its case beyond reasonable
doubt who has been rightly convicted by the learned trial
court. Learned ADPP finally maintains that the learned trial
court by not awarding normal penalty of death has already
taken a lenient view in favor of appellant.

13. HEARD.

14. Iam conscious of the fact that the nature of crime is
serious and heinous in nature as a girl of 7/8 years was not
only committed to rape but done to death by strangulation.
But on this reason alone an offender cannot be sent to
gallows. Under all circumstances the basic principles cannot
be compromised that this is the duty of prosecution to prove
its case beyond reasonable doubt; the evidence produced by
prosecution must be credible and reliable having the ring of
truth; case cannot be decided on the basis of surmises and
conjectures; weak and infirm evidence must lose its worth
particular when it is a case of capital charge and that the
maxim “Justitia nemini neganda est’ (Justice is to be denied
to nobody) is the basic consideration while deciding a case.

15. It also reminds me an article’ ‘HEART VS. HEAD:
Do Judges Follow the Law or Follow Their Feelings ” by

Andrew J. Wistrich, Jeffrey J. Rachlinski and Chris Guthrie

(United States of America). This Article explores the question

whether feelings

about litigants also influence judges’

decisions. Some of the important abstracts are as under: -

i.

vii

United States Circuit Judge Jerome Frank®
asserted that “Mr. Prejudice and Miss.
Sympathy are the names of witnesses, whose
testimony is never recorded, but must
nevertheless be reckoned with in trials by
jury.

Sympathy and empathy in the jury box can
be defended as softening the sometimes
sharp edges of our legal system. Judges,
however, are supposed to make reasoned
decisions based on the facts and the law
rather than on the basis of sympathy or
empathy for litigants.

Judicial oaths require Judges to put their
feelings towards litigants aside.

iv. Equating empathy with partiality, Senator

Charles Grassley’ asserted that “the most
critical qualification of a Judge is the
capacity to set aside one’s own feelings so
that he or she can _ blindly and
dispassionately administer equal justice for
all.

Asked about the proper role of a Judge
during her Senate confirmation hearing,
United States Supreme Court Justice Sonia
Sotomayor® responded “Judges can’t rely on
what’s in their heart. . . . It’s not the heart
that compels conclusions in cases. It’s the
law.”

. Judge Michael Boggs” testified before the

Senate Judiciary Committee “the comforting
part about being a Judge is that the law
should prevail in each and every case.
Sympathy or empathy for the party has no
role.”

The idea that one set of rules applies to the
sympathetic litigant and another set applies
to the unsympathetic litigant is not consistent
with the rule of law.

_An Ohio'® appellate Judge expressed deep

sadness for “the tragic loss of life the case

presents” but then added that “when I put on

the robe as Judge, I must not let my feelings,

16. Emotion, sympathy, empathy and kindness are aliens

during the dispensation of justice. For a Judge the only

principle is to follow is "Let justice be done though the

heavens fall''". This principle signifies the belief that justice

must be realized regardless of consequences.

17. The Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan in Naveed

12 . . .
Asghar’s case ~ on the question of heinousness of a crime

was pleased to hold that: -

“The ruthless and ghastly murder of five
persons is a crime of heinous nature; but the
frightful nature of crime should not blur the
eyes of justice, allowing emotions triggered
by the horrifying nature of the offence to
prejudge the accused. Cases are to be
decided on the basis of evidence and
evidence alone and not on the basis of
sentiments and emotions. Gruesome,
heinous or brutal nature of the offence may
be relevant at the stage of awarding suitable
punishment after conviction; but it is totally
irrelevant at the stage of appraising or
reappraising the evidence available on
record to determine guilt of the accused
person, as possibility of an innocent person
having been wrongly involved in cases of
such nature cannot be ruled out. An accused
person is presumed to be innocent till the
time he is proven guilty beyond reasonable
doubt, and this presumption of his innocence
continues until the prosecution succeeds in
proving the charge against him beyond
reasonable doubt on the basis of legally
admissible, confidence inspiring,
trustworthy and reliable evidence. No matter
how heinous the crime, the constitutional
guarantee of fair trial under Article 10A
cannot be taken away from the accused. It
is, therefore, duty of the court to assess the
probative value (weight) of every piece of
evidence available on record in accordance
with the settled principles of appreciation of
evidence, in a dispassionate, systematic and

structured manner without being influenced
by the nature of the allegations. Any
tendency to strain or stretch or haphazardly
appreciate evidence to reach a desired or
popular decision in a case must be
scrupulously avoided or else highly
deleterious results seriously affecting proper
administration of criminal justice will
follow. It may be pertinent to underline here
that the principles of fair trial have now
been guaranteed as a Fundamental Right
under Article 10-A of the Constitution and
are to be read as an integral part of every
sub constitutional legislative instrument that
deals with determination of civil rights and
obligations of, or criminal charge against,
any person”

18. On the touchstone of above said principles now I
proceed to examine the evidence produced by the
prosecution. Statement of Habib-ur-Rehman/complainant
(Pw-6) has already been referred in the opening paragraphs
of this judgment, where he did not disclose any clue
whatsoever about any of the assailants. In the same
document/complaint names of Abdul Qadir (Pw-7) and Bilal
Hasani were also mentioned who associated the complainant
for the search of his daughter.

19. In witness box both Habib-ur-Rehman and Abdul
Qadir made material improvements in their statements.
Habib-ur-Rehman in his examination-in-chief stated as
under (relevant lines only): -

“J also informed Abdul Qadir and Bilal PWs
telephonically about missing of my
daughter. They came to my house in the
evening on the same day. Above named PWs
informed me that they had seen the deceased
in the company of Mohib and Muhammad
Qasim accused present in court who were
giving her guava fruit. Then we went to the
accused persons and inquired about
deceased. They disclosed that they had left
deceased near graveyard”
Criminal Appeal No. 13-J of 2014
Mohib Ali vs. The State

20. In cross-examination he was duly confronted by

defence and it was established that the reproduced lines were

result of improvements.

21. Perusal of statement of Abdul Qadir (Pw-7) also

makes it clear that he, too, changed his story and by

improving maintained as under: -

“About two years back on 30.11.2010 at
about 3:30 pm when I was residing in Qasba
Asni, I along with Bilal (PW) were present
at a shop in the said village when we saw
Mohib Ali and Qasim Ali accused persons
present in court taking away Mst. Javairia
daughter of the complainant while giving
her guava fruit. We returned back home and
after about 1% hours came to Rajanpur. I
received telephone call from Habib ur
Rehman complainant just before Maghrib
prayer time that her daughter Mst. Javairia
deceased was missing. Then we returned
back to Asni and started search of deceased
and got an announcement in the loud
speaker of mosque. Then I along with Habib
ur Rehman complainant went to Mohib Ali
and Qasim Ali accused persons present in
Court and inquired about deceased. They
disclosed that they had left the deceased
near the graveyard”

22. The question of improvement by a witness came for

consideration before the apex Court in Syed Muhammad

Shah’s'* case and it was held that: -

“Secondly, statements of the witnesses in the
court in which improvements are made to
strengthen the case of the prosecution are
not worthy of reliance. It is held in the case
of Amir Zaman v. Mehboob and others
(1985 SCMR 685) that testimony of
witnesses containing material improvements
are not believable. Reference can also be
made to the cases of Haji Bakhsh v. The
State (PLD 1963 Kar. 805), Qaim Din and
others v. The State (1971 P Cr. LJ 229) and
Fazla and another v. The State (PLD 1960
Lah. 373)”

8 Syed Saeed Muhammad Shah & another vs. The State 1993 SCMR 550
Criminal Appeal No. 13-J of 2014 9
Mohib Ali vs. The State

23. Again on same question in Sardar Bibi’s case" it was
held that: -

“As doctor, while conducting postmortem
examination, declared that the deceased
persons received bullet injuries hence for
the first time during trial, Falak Sher and
Sikandar were shown to be armed with 30
bore pistol and Munir being armed with
7mm rifle. This willful and dishonest
improvement was made by both the
witnesses in order to bring the prosecution
case in line with the medical evidence. In the
FIR the complainant alleged that fire shot of
Falak Sher hit Zafar Iqbal deceased on his
chest and the fire shot of Sultan Ahmed
accused also hit on the chest of deceased
Zafar Iqbal. According to doctor, there was
only one fire-arm entry wound on the chest
of the deceased Zafar Iqbal. In order to meet
this situation, witnesses for the first time,
during trial made omission and did not
allege that the fire shot of Sultan hit at the
chest of Zafar Iqbal, deceased. So the
improvements and omissions were made by
the witnesses in order to bring the case of
prosecution in line with the medical
evidence. Such dishonest and deliberate
improvement and omission made them
unreliable and they are not trustworthy
witnesses.”

24. Same view also finds support from Muhammad Arif’s
case!”,

25. If Abdul Qadir and Muhammad Bilal Hasani had
joined Habib-ur-Rehman on the same day i.e. 30.11.2010,
started search and both they told that they had seen the
assailants and deceased together, why this important fact
was not unveiled by Habib-ur-Rehman when he made the
statement (PA) to Muhammad Sharif SI? It is important to
refer here that by no stretch of imaginations in his statement,
Habib-ur-Rehman maintained that he made any telephone

call to Abdul Qadir and Muhammad Bilal and they

associated him on 30.11.2010 but what was claimed that

'4 Sardar Bibi & another vs. Munir Ahmad & others 2017 SCMR 344
'S Muhammad Arif vs. The State 2019 SCMR 631
Criminal Appeal No. 13-J of 2014 10
Mohib Ali vs. The State

both the witnesses came to him in the morning of
01.12.2010.

26. In view of above, the worth, veracity, credibility and
reliability of Habib-ur-Rehman and Abdul Qadir are
completely smashed.

27. The prosecution therefore, is left only with the
confession (PM) made by appellant.

28. Before I discuss and appreciate the merits of the
confession, I will like to refer the relevant provisions of law
and principles settled on this subject by the apex Court.

29. Section 164 Cr.P.C and the Rules and Orders of the
Lahore High Court, Lahore Volume III and Chapter 13 are
directly related to recording of a confession. Under Section
164 Cr.P.C: -

i. Power to record confession lies with a
Magistrate of the First Class and any
Magistrate of the Second Class specially
empowered.

ii. It can be recorded in the course of an
investigation, or at any time afterwards
before the commencement of the trial.

iii. It shall be recorded and signed in the
manners provided in Section 364 Cr.P.C.

iv. The Magistrate is under a statutory duty that
before recording any confession he shall
explain to the accused that he is not bound
to make a confession and if he does so it can
be used as evidence against him.

v. The Magistrate shall record confession only
if he has reason to believe that it is being
made voluntarily.

30. Under the High Court Rules and Orders the following
questions have been formulated which a Magistrate is bound
to put to an accused under all circumstances for the purpose
of his satisfaction that the same is being made with free will
and consent, without any promise, duress, compulsion,
threat, ill treatment or any other extraneous consideration.

_No.1. Do you understand that you
are not bound to make a
Confession?
Criminal Appeal No. 13-J of 2014 11
Mohib Ali vs. The State

No.2. Do you understand that your
statement is being recorded by
Magistrate, and that if you
make a Confession, it may be
used as evidence against you?
No.3. How long have you been in
Police custody?
Do you understand that after
making a Statement before me
you will not be remanded to
Police custody but will be sent
to the judicial lock up?
Understanding these facts are
you making a Statement before
me voluntarily?
Q.No.6. What are your reasons for
wishing to make a Statement?

Z

aN

-No.

n

31. It must be noticed that above are the minimum
number of questions and there can be no deviation however,
if the answers are of such a character as to require a
Magistrate to do so, he can put such further questions as
may be necessary to enable him to judge whether the
accused is acting voluntarily. So the entire exercise is to
ensure that what an accused wants to say that is the
volunteer voice of his conscious, mind and heart. It must not
be ignored also that before a Magistrate proceeds to record
the confession, he should arrange so far as is compatible
with his safety and that of his staff and with the safe custody
of the prisoner; that the latter is left for some time out of the
hearing of Police Officer or other persons likely to influence
him.

32. A volunteer confession by accused always remained
an important consideration for the apex and higher courts of
the country. In “Azeem _Khan’s case'° the principles
reinforced by the apex Court are as under: -

i. Before recording confession and that
too in crimes entailing capital
punishment, the recording Magistrate
had to essentially observe all the
mandatory precautions (laid down in
the High Court Rules and Orders).

'© Azeem Khan & others Vs. Mujahid Khan & others 2016-SCMR-274

viii.

12

Fundamental logic behind the same
was that, all signs of fear
uncalculated by the investigating
agency in the mind of the accused
were to be shed out.

Accused was to be provided full
assurance that in case he was not
guilty or was not making a confession
voluntarily then in that case he would
not be handed over back to the
police.

Sufficient time for reflection was to
be given after the first warning was
administered.

At the expiry of such time, recording
Magistrate had to administer the
second warning and the accused
shall be assured that now he was in
the safe hands.

All police officials whether in
uniform or otherwise including Naib
court attached to the court must be
kept outside the court and beyond the
view of the accused.

After observing all these legal
requirements if the accused person
was willing to confess then all
required questions as formulated by
the High Court Rules and Orders
should be put to him and the answers
given, be recorded in the words
spoken by him.

Statement of accused should be
recorded by the Magistrate with his
own hand and in case there was a
genuine compelling reason then, a
special note was to be given that the
same was dictated to a responsible
official of the court like Stenographer
or Reader and oath shall also be
administered to such official that he
would correctly type or write the true
and correct version.

Accused shall be sent to jail on
judicial remand and during this
process at no occasion he shall be
handed over to any police
official/officer whether he was Naib
court wearing police uniform, or any
other police official/officer because
such careless dispensation would
considerably diminish the voluntary
nature of the confession made by the
accused.
Criminal Appeal No. 13-J of 2014 13
Mohib Ali vs. The State ~

33. By applying the law and principles referred above, it
is to be appreciated that if the evidence of confession in this
case meets the required standards or short of it? First of all it
is to be seen that whether appellant was arrested on
17.01.2011 as claimed by Muhammad Sharif SI (Pw-9) or
the position was otherwise? Statement of Habib-ur-Rehman/
complainant (Pw-6) shows that he had seen the appellant in
police custody first time after 4/5 days of the occurrence that
means by or before 05.12.2010 appellant was with the
Investigating Officer. Even Abdul Qadir (Pw-7) in cross
examination categorically replied that appellant was arrested
on the day of recovery of dead body.

34. In view of above, prosecution itself has confirmed that
the appellant was arrested much earlier to 17.01.2011 which
means that he remained under illegal confinement since the
actual day of his arrest, so on this ground alone the
confession has lost its worth.

35. For the sake of arguments, if it is presumed that
appellant was arrested on 17.01.2011, even then the
prosecution has multiple barriers to cross. First time
appellant was produced before the learned Magistrate (Mr.
Irfan Ahmad) on 18.01.2011 with a request (DB) by the
Investigating Officer to record his confession and
surprisingly the learned Magistrate passed a unique order
which is as under: -

“The police has requested for recording
statement of accused person under Section
164 Cr.P.C. Upon queries of this case it
appears that accused person is under some
pressure and influence. The request of
recording statement under Section 164
Cr.P.C will remain pending and the same
would be decided when the accused person
would be produced in this Court on the next
of hearing”

36. Again, on 22.01.2011, appellant was produced by
Muhammad Sharif SI (Pw-9) with similar request (DC)
Criminal Appeal No. 13-J of 2014 14
Mohib Ali vs. The State

before the learned Duty Magistrate (Mr. Muhammad Ashraf)
and again an astonishing order passed was as follow: -

“Since, accused is in police custody,
therefore, keeping in view this aspect he is
directed to engage his counsel to proceed
further, in this request of the police for the
statement of accused under Section 164
Cr.P.C. At the same time notice to co-
accused be issued for four days”
37. Story further goes on, when on 26.01.2011 third time
Investigating Officer brought the appellant (DD) before the
learned duty Magistrate (Mr. Muhammad Ashraf). Even this
time better sense did not prevail and following order was
passed: -

“Tt is fresh request of local police to record
the statement of accused person under
Section 164 Cr.P.C. It is further noted that
on 22.01.2011 Investigating Officer was
directed to produce co-accused person
before the court, but, he has failed. Keeping
in view this aspect he is further directed to
arrest co-accused person and _ produce
before the court on 31.01.2011, after that
this request shall be entertained ”

38. Before reverting to the final day when confession was
recorded, I want to observe that the learned Magistrates one
after the other committed serious illegalities while passing
the orders (ibid) on the repeated requests of the Investigating
Officer. On the very first day (18.01.2011) when the
appellant was produced before the learned Magistrate (Mr.
Irfan Ahmad), he was supposed to proceed in the manners as
prescribed under Section 164 Cr.P.C read with the relevant
Rules and Orders of this Court. After formulating the
questions and taking their answers, he could declare that
appellant was seeming to be under pressure and in that
eventuality he/learned Magistrate was not supposed to return
his custody to the Investigating Officer but to send him to
Jail and to call him again at an appropriate date according to

his own satisfaction so as to find out that still there was or
Criminal Appeal No. 13-J of 2014 15
Mohib Ali vs. The State

not any pressure or influence on appellant? In any case even
thereafter, appellant had to be sent to Jail and no authority
was vested with the learned Magistrate to hand over his
custody to the Investigating Officer. Similarly, the learned
duty Magistrate could not adjourn the matters by assigning
so-called reasons for the arrest of co-accused, issuance of
notice to him or asking the appellant to engage an Advocate.
If the first learned Magistrate committed illegality, at least
second learned Magistrate (Duty) on 22.01.2011 and
26.11.2011 could do the right instead of following the same
illegality made by him and the first learned Magistrate.

39. Let’s forget what was done in past and come to the
point that what happened on 31.01.2011, when the
confession of appellant (PM) was recorded. It was in
complete deviation of the statutory provisions and procedure
prescribed earlier and the principles settled by the apex
Court. The leaned recording Magistrate (Mr. Irfan Ahmad)
committed following illegalities: -

i. At the time of alleged confession
Muhammad Sharif SI was present
inside the court.

ii. The questions as formulated under
the High Court Rules and Orders
were not put to appellant.

iii. Appellant was not asked that since
when he was in police custody.

iv. The question that said confession if
made can be used against appellant
was not asked from him.

v. The question that if appellant wanted
to make confession voluntarily is also
missing.

vi. No oath was taken from the
Stenographer who under the dictation
recorded questions and answers as
well as the order with regard to
satisfaction of the learned
Magistrate.

vii. There is no mention that handcuffs of
appellant were removed before he
was called upon for his confession.

viii. Not a single minute was given to
appellant to reconcile and to give a
Criminal Appeal No. 13-J of 2014 16

Mohib Ali vs. The State

second thought before he had to make
the confession.

ix. The confession was recorded on
Oath.

40. Whatever has been referred above, it takes me to a
definite conclusion that the evidence of confession could
never be a base for conviction of appellant and the same has
been wrongly believed by the learned trial court.

41. It is said that confession evidence is powerful but
flawed. Mr. Saul M. Kassin’’ in his research (Confession
Evidence Commonsense Myths and Misconceptions) ® about
false confession has shared his experience as under: -

“Confessions have been proven false in a
numbers of ways, for instance, when it turns
out that no crime was committed, the real
perpetrator is found, or the confessor’s
involvement was physically impossible.
Whatever the mechanism, although the
prevalence rate is unknown, false
confessions occur with some degree of
regularity. In Europe, 12% of prisoners, 3%
to 4% of college students, and 1% to 2% of
older university students reported that they
have confessed to crimes they did not
commit (Gudjonsson, 2003). In North
America, police investigators recently
estimated that 4.78% of innocent people
confess during interrogation (Kassin et al.,
2007). Within the recent population of post
conviction DNA cases, roughly 25%
contained confessions in  evidence—a
sample that represents the tip of a much
larger iceberg (Drizin & Leo, 2004; Gross,
Jacoby, Matheson, Montgomery, & Patel,
2005; Scheck, Neufeld, & Dwyer, 2000) ”’

42. Mr. Erin Blakemore in Washington Post!” (June 23,
2019) had reported that according to the National Registry of
Exonerations”’, 27% of people in the registry who were

accused of homicide gave false confessions, and 81% of

people with mental illness or intellectual disabilities did the
same when they were accused of homicide.

43. Even in Pakistan the situation is not less than worst.
Most of the cases having the evidence of confession are
failed when brought in the court on various reasons.
Maimoona Rafique Advocate in her article”! (False
Confession: A Cause of Wrongful Convictions in Pakistan) has
written: -

“According to research, the untrained
investigator feels they have a sixth intuition
about suspect guilt and deceits leading them
to mistakenly believe the false confessions
they get are real. Furthermore, the unethical
or prejudiced investigator has an improper
mentality when it comes to the interview.
They are convinced that the suspect is guilty.
As a result, they don’t think the suspect is
talking the truth until he or she confesses;
everything else is considered a lie and
treated as such”

44. Referring United Kingdom she further wrote that even
in that jurisdiction, about 25% of the suspects make the false
confession due to the pressure of police, techniques they
haven’t know, or even they were not aware by the law that
they are not bound to answer they may remain silent. Many
of the accused confessed and become convicted and
afterward they become to know that those convicted persons

were just an innocent person.

45. Ending the discussion made above, this criminal
appeal is allowed. Impugned judgment dated 28.11.2013 is
set_aside. Appellant is acquitted from the case. He is in

custody and shall be released forthwith if not required in any

other case.
