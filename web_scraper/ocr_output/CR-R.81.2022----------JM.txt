JUDGMENT
Date of hearing ad 13.02.2023.
Petitioners by --- Mr. Muhammad Tariq Afridi,
Advocate.
Respondents by = --- Mr. Abdul Sattar Khan, Advocate.

S M ATTIQUE SHAH, J:- Instant petition is directed
against the order of learned Additional District and;
Sessions Judge-IX, Peshawar dated 01.04.2022,
whereby application of the respondents filed under
section 7 of Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 was
accepted.

2. Brief facts of the case are that
respondent No.1 filed a complaint under section 4
of the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 against the
petitioners alongwith an application under section 7
of the ibid Act for restoration of possession of the
flour mill in question. The learned trial Court
solicited report of the local police, and; thereafter,
summoned the petitioners. The petitioners

appeared before the Court. Subsequently, the
learned trial Court vide impugned order dated
04.10.2022, accepted the application of respondent
No.1, filed under section 7 of the Illegal
Dispossession Act, 2005 while restoring the
possession of mill in question to the respondent
No.1; hence, instant petition.

3. Learned counsel representing the
respondents, at the very outset has challenged
maintainability of instant petition filed under section
439 Cr.P.C. on the ground that the impugned order
is interim in nature and; as such, the same cannot
be challenged before this court in instant petition.
Further, that Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 has
not provided any specific provision of revision
against the impugned order and as such on this
score too, the instant petition is not competent.
Further, that if substantial justice has been done to
a party by the learned trial court while exercising its
jurisdiction, and during such exercise, if any
irregularity has been committed, the same requires
to be ignored in the larger interest of justice.
Further, that the learned trial court has properly
exercised its jurisdiction in accordance with law
applicable thereto while passing the impugned
judgment as such the same is not open to any

interference by this court. On merits, learned
ww

counsel for the respondents argued that the
learned trial court has properly assumed the
jurisdiction and; passed the impugned order qua
restoration of possession in terms of section 7 of
the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 after
appreciating the material available on record of the
case, therefore, the same requires no interference
by this court in instant petition. In support of his
contentions learned counsel placed reliance on
various judgments. Saleem Ran and 23 others
Vs. lind Additional Sessins Judge, Malir,
Karachi and 5 others, (2020 YLR 634), Atta
Rasool and 3 others Vs. Haji Muhammad
Rafique and 2 others (2019 P.Cr.L.J. 1023),
MuhammadAnwar Qureshi Vs. The State and 7
others (2019 YLR 2307), The State/Anti
Narcotics Force through Assistant Director Vs.
3° Additional Sessios Judge/Special Judge
CNS Court, Hyderabad, (2019 YLR 1037),
Ehsanullah and 2 others Vs. Manzar Hussain
(2010 YLR 3161), Samander Khan and another
Vs. Haji Abdul Rehman and 23 others (PLD 2007
Quetta 72) Muhammad Ramzan alias Jani Vs.
Muhammad Aslam and others (2007 P.Cr.L.J.
1784), Nazir Ahmed and others Vs. The State

and others (PLD 2005 Karachi 18), Mahmood Ali
Butt. Vs. Inspector General of Police, Punjab,
Lahore and 10 others (PLD 1997 Supreme Court
823), Zulfiqgar and others Vs. The State and 10
others (1991 SCMR 326), J.Samuel and 9 others
Vs. Mst. Rabia Bibi and others (1991 P.Cr.L.J.
885), Shahzada and others Vs. Malik
Shamsuddin and another (PLD 1977 Supreme
Court 384) and Abdul Wahab Vs. The Crown
(PLD 1955 Federal Court-88).

4. Conversely, learned counsel
representing the petitioners strongly controverted
the submissions of the learned counsel for the
respondents made at the bar qua the
maintainability of the instant petition, and; on merits
as well, while arguing that in its revisional
jurisdiction under section 439 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure 1898, this Court has ample
power to entertain the instant petition filed against
the interim order of learned trial court passed in
terms of section 7 of the Illegal Dispossession Act,
2005. Further, that section 9 of the Act ibid
provides that at the time of exercise of its
jurisdiction under Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005
the learned trial court can recourse to the
provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898

if the same is not specifically excluded. On merits,
learned counsel argued that impugned order is
nullity in the eye of law being passed in violation of
the explicit provision of section 7 of the Act, 2005
as the same has been passed before the
commencement of trial and; as such is liable to be
set aside upon acceptance of instnat petition.
Placed reliance on Habibullah and another Vs.
The State and 9 others (2000 MLD 1162), Haq
Nawaz and others Vs. The State and others
(2000 SCMR 785), Rana Muhammad Ahsan
Rasool Vs. The State and others (2013 P.Cr.L.J.
953) and Edward Henry Louis Vs. Dr.
Mutammad Safdar (2009 P.Cr.L.J. 1359).

5. Heard. Record perused.

6. This court intends to first dilate upon
the question of maintainability of instant petition
filed under section 439 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898 (the code). A thorough perusal of
the provision of Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005
(the Act) would show that only an appeal u/s 8-A of
the said Act has been provided in the matters
covered under sub-section 2 & 3 of section-3
alongwith sub-section-1 of section 8 of the said Act
before this court which clearly show that an appeal
u/s 8-A is only restricted to the above referred

provisions, which undoubtedly excludes all other
orders either final or interim from the appeal
jurisdiction of this court u/s 8-A of the Act.
However, it does not mean that other orders i.e.
final or interim passed by the learned trial court
while exercising its jurisdiction under the provisions
of said Act are not amenable to the jurisdiction of
this court in terms of the provision of section 439 of
the Code, otherwise the aggrieved person would
be left remediless which is certainly neither
permissible nor desirable under the law. It is worth
mentioning that section-9 of the Act, 2005
envisages that “unless otherwise provided in
this Act, the provisions of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898 (V of 1898), shall apply to
proceedings under this Act”, which means that in
absence of a specific provision in the Act, 2005
recourse could be made to the relevant provision of
the Code when a difficulty arise during the
proceedings under the said Act. Admittedly,
no provision of appeal or revision has been
provided by the Act, 2005 in the matters arising
out of section 7 of the said Act, therefore, in
such eventuality, the aggrieved person can
avail the remedy provided by the Code for

redressal of his grievance. 2015 P.Cr.L.J 1490

Abdul Haque Vs. Mir Ahmad and 6 others. It is
worth mentioning that a similar question came up
for hearing before Hon'ble Lahore High Court
Lahore in case of Sana Ullah Khan Vs. The State
and 3 others (2022 P.Cr.L.J. 1828 Lahore) which
was dealt with in the following manner: -

5, Learned counsel for the appellant
while placing reliance on the case
"Mst. Farah Deeba v. Said
Muhammad alias Toti and another"
(2021 MLD 580) contends that the
word "any" used in section 8-A
means any order either of
conviction or acquittal because it is
passed while dealing with the
complaint under subsections (2)
and (3) of section 3 of the Act. The
contention of learned counsel for
the appellant is not sustainable for
the reason that legislator has not
provided right of appeal against all
orders passed under the provisions
of this Act. For reference, following
are the orders which can be passed
during proceedings under the Act
on a complaint, but no appeal is
provided there-against:-

i) Dismissal of complaint under
section 203, Cr.P.C. when there is
no sufficient ground;

ii) Taking cognizance of
complaint and summoning of
accused;
iii) Direction to the police to
arrest the accused as authorized
under section 4(3) of the Act;

iv) Order of attachment of
property under section 6 of the Act;
v) Order of eviction and mode
of recovery of possession as an
interim relief under section 7 of
the Act;

vi) Rejection of application under
section 265-K, Cr.P.C.;

vii) On conclusion of trial, award
of compensatory costs to the
person complained against if the
complaint is found false, frivolous or
vexatious under section 5(4) of the
Act.

The above situations reflect that the
legislator has not felt the necessity
to provide a right of appeal against
such orders because they are
regulated under the provisions of
Code of Criminal Procedure and
most of the suitable remedy is to
invoke revisional jurisdiction of the
High Court.

7. In view thereof, the instant Criminal
Petition filed u/s 439 of the Code is held
maintainable while the objection raised by the
respondents' qua maintainability of the same is

turndown; being misconceived. The case law
produced at the bar by the learned counsel for the
respondents is distinguishable and; thus does not
attract to the matter in hand.

8. Coming towards merits of the case,
record reflects that complaint under the provisions
of Act, 2005 was filed by respondent No. 1
against the petitioners on 22.01.2022, after
recording the statement of the complainant, matter
was referred to the SHO concerned for inquiry.
Upon receipt of such inquiry, learned trial court
passed the impugned order after hearing the
parties which suggests that the impugned order
was passed before the commencement of trial. As
the impugned order is passed u/s 7 of the Act,
2005 therefore, the same is reproduced for ready
reference:-

7. Eviction and mode of recovery
as an interim relief.-

(1) _ If during trial the Court is satisfied
that a person is found prima facie to be
not in lawful possession, the Court shall,
as an interim relief direct him to put the
owner or occupier, as the case may be,
in possessiin.

9. The ibid provision explicitly provides
that the court can pass an order in terms of section
7 during the trial which clearly shows that such
order is to be passed after the commencement of
trial. The matter of the cognizance of a case by the
court and; commencement of the trial came up for
hearing before the august Apex court in the case of
HAQ NAWAZ and others V. THE STATE and
others 2000 SCMR 785 wherein it was held “that
taking of cognizance of a case is not
synonymous with the commencement of the
trial in a case. Taking of cognizance of a case
by the court is the first step, which may or may
not culminate into the trial of the accused. The
trial in a criminal case, therefore, does not
commence with the taking of the cognizance of
the case by the court”. The matter of cognizance
of a case and; commencement of the trial in
specific context to the provision of section 7 of the
Act, 2005 also came up for hearing from time to
time before the courts in various cases wherein it
was held that provision of section 7 shall only come
into operation when a charge is framed against the
accused. 2007 Y L R 1657 Lahore SABIR AYYAZ

Sindh ABDUL FATAH V. MAHARRAM ALI and
others. 2016 P CR. L J 1103 Islamabad GHULAM
UMER MEMON and others V. JABBAR SATTI
and others. The ibid legal question has also
recently been extensively, dealt with in the case of
KHAIR MUHAMMAD V. ALI SHER and others
reported in 2022 P Cr. LJ 1603 Sindh in the

following manner:-

8. The main point for the
consideration before this court is
that whether section 7 of the ibid
Act is applicable after taking
cognizance and before framing the
charge or after framing of the
charge and recording evidence. For
ready reference section 7 is re-
produced as under:-

"7. Eviction and mode of
recovery as an interim relief.---(1) If
during trial the Court is satisfied that
a person is found prima facie to be
not in lawful possession, the Court
Shall, as an interim relief direct him
12

to put the owner or occupier, as the
case may be, in possession.

9. The perusal of section 7 of
the Act manifests that the grant of
interim relief is subject to the
condition "during trial". The
expression during trial has been
interpreted by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court of Pakistan in a case of Haq
Nawaz and others (2000 SCMR
785), wherein it was held as under:-

"From a review of above
provisions of the court, it is quite
clear to us that taking of cognizance
of the case by the court is not
synonymous with the
commencement of trial in a case.
Taking cognizance of case by the
court is the first step which may or
may not culminate into the trial of
the accused. The trial in a criminal
case, therefore, does not
commence with the taking of the
cognizance of the case by the
court."

10. It is observed that for taking
cognizance of the offence and
investigation under the provision of
Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 a
separate provisions are provided
under sections 4 and 5 of the lilegal
Dispossession Act, 2005 which
reads as under:-

4. Cognizance of offence.---
(1) Notwithstanding anything
contained in the Code. or any law for
the time being in force, the
‘contravention of section 3 shall be
triable by the Court of Session on a
complaint.

(2) The offence under this Act
shall be non-cognizable.

(3) The Court at any stage of
the proceedings may direct the
police to arrest the accused.

5. Investigation and
procedure.---(1) Upon a complaint
the Court may direct the officer-in-
charge of a police station to
investigate and complete the
investigation and forward the same
within fifteen days to the Court:

Provided the Court may
extend the time within which such
report is to be forwarded in case
where good reasons are shown for
14

not doing so within the time
specified in this subsection.

(2) On taking cognizance of a
case, the Court shall proceed with
the trial from day to day and shall
decide the case within sixty days
and for any delay, sufficient reasons
shall be recorded.

(3) The Court shall not
adjourn the trial for any purpose
unless such adjournment is, in its
opinion, necessary in the interest of
justice and no adjournment shall in
any case be granted for more than
seven days.

From perusal of the above
provisions it is clear that in respect
of the "taking cognizance" and
“investigation”, the Act has its own
provisions. However, for the trial
and other proceedings for which
there is no provision in the Act ibid
then by virtue of section 9 of the
Act, Criminal Procedure Code, 1898
is applicable which provides the
procedure for framing of the charge
and the said procedure for framing
the charge is governed by sections
265(c) and 265(d) of the Criminal
Procedure Code, 1898. Therefore, it
is mandatory upon the trial court to
15

first comply with the provisions of
sections 265(c) and 265(d), Cr.P.C.
before commencing the trial. It is
further observed that before
complying section 265 (d), Cr.P.C.,
the provision of section 265(c),
Cr.P.C., is to be complied with,
wherein the accused is entitled to
be supplied the relevant documents
of the complaint in order to enable
him to know the exact nature of
allegations before he is sent-up to
stand the trial. The purpose whereof
is to afford the accused sufficient
time to study the allegations against
him and to prepare his defence if
any. In clause (b) of subsection (2),
it is further provided that the copies
of the complaint or any other
document which has been filed by
the complainant shall be supplied to
the accused free of cost not later
than seven days before the
commencement of the trial. The
supply of the relevant copies of the
complaint to the accused before
seven days of the commencement
of the trial has a direct connotation
to the framing of charge, which
means that the trial of an accused
would not start unless the relevant
documents are supplied to him in
terms of section 265(c), Cr.P.C.
which shail then lead to the framing
16

of charge under section 265(d),
Cr.P.C.

11. It is further observed that
under section 265(d), Cr.P.C, the
court, after perusing the police
report, the complaint and all other
documents and statements filed by
the prosecution, is of the opinion
regarding availability of sufficient
grounds to proceed with the trial, it
shall frame a charge in writing
against the accused. The study of
above provisions of law shows that
the trial would not start until a
period of seven days after supplying
the relevant copies to the accused
in terms of clause (b) to subsection
(2) of section 265, CrP.C. is
expired and charge is framed, which
can be considered as a first step
towards the commencement of trial.
After the first step as discussed
above a second step for recording
evidence starts and the condition
provided in section 7 of the Illegal
Dispossession Act “during trial"
come in to the force.

12. It is well settled principle of
interpretation law that "If the words
of the Statute are themselves clear
and unambiguous, no more is
necessary to expound those words
in their natural and ordinary sense,
the words themselves in such a
case best declare the intentions of
legislature", as held in the case of
Mumtaz Hussain v. Dr. Nasir Khan
and others (2010 SCMR 1254).

Honourable Supreme Court in
another case of Ghulam Haider and
others v. Murad through Legal
Representatives and others (PLD
2012 SC 501), has held as under:-

"Where the plain language of
a statute admits of no other
interpretation then the intention of
the legislature conveyed through
such language is to be given its full
effect."

13. Admittedly in the present
case charge has not been framed
against the applicants, even the
NBWs issued against them were
not served upon some of the
applicants as has been reflected
from the impugned order, the
application under section 7 of the
Act was allowed. Relevant para of
the impugned order is re-produced
as under:-

‘After preliminary inquiry
cognizance was taken by this court
C's

and present complaint is on regular
file is pending for service/ NBWs
against some of the accused
persons".

Perusal of the impugned
order as re-produced above reflects
that the learned trial court has not
attended itself to the condition
precedent appearing in section 7 of
the Act 2005 before passing the
impugned order, which is therefore,
without lawful authority and not
Sustainable in the eyes of law.

10. In the present case, as earlier
discussed, learned trial court passed the impugned
order before commencement of the trial which is
certainly violative of the provision of section 7 of the
Act, 2005. Therefore, the impugned order is
setaside, and; matter is remitted to the learned trial
court for its decision afresh strictly in accordance

with law applicable thereto.
