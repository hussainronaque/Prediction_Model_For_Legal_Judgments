JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.- Through

this constitutional petition under Article 199 of the

Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 “the

Constitution” petitioner Mst. Hina Rukhsana, seeks an

appropriate writ to declare the order/ action of SHO Police

Station Akora Khattak, Nowshera whereby

arrest of respondent-accused Gul Zarin in a murder charge

has been deferred and he has been exonerated/ discharged

by invoking the provision of $.169 Cr.P.C. by placing his

name in column No.2 of the Challan, which is sheer mala

fide and abuse of process of the law, hence, liable to be set

aside.

2. Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that

Muhammad Younas deceased, was the husband of the

petitioner who contracted court marriage with the

petitioner, on which respondents No.8 to 9 and co-accused

Abdul Wali and Saddam, the close relatives of the

petitioner being annoyed, committed his murder; that in the

same incident petitioner also sustained multiple firearm

injuries; that consequent upon the report of the petitioner

FIR) No.752. dated 28.08.2013 under _ sections

302/324/148/149 PPC, has been registered at Police Station

Akora Khattak, wherein she has charged the respondents

for commission of the offence; that version of the petitioner

get corroboration from recovery of 22 crime empties of

7.62 bore, bloodstained earth from the spot, medico legal

report of the petitioner and autopsy report of her deceased

husband; that the accused-respondents, after commission of

the offence went into hiding, resultantly, proceedings under

section 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. were initiated and challan in

terms of S.512 Cr.P.C. was submitted against them, but all

of a sudden on 17.09.2013, respondent No.8 Gul Zarreen,

who is serving as DSP in Police Department was

discharged/ exonerated under section 169 Cr.P.C. by the

SHO, in a clandestine manner; that against the illegal action

of the SHO, petitioner approached the learned Sessions

Judge, who directed the prosecution to re-submit challan

vide order dated 13.01.2014; that in the meantime,

respondents No.8 and 9, obtained ad-interim pre-arrest bail

from the Court of learned Sessions Judge, Nowshera, which

was, later on, withdrawn; that both the accused-respondent

are enjoying liberty unwarranted on the basis of nepotism

and favoritism being higher rank official in Police

Department. He contended that an appropriate writ

directing the SHO concerned Police Station to arrest

respondents-accused may kindly be issued and all action

and inaction of the SHO, be declared as illegal unlawful

and without lawful authority.

2. Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents

contended that during investigation that respondent/accused

Gul Zareen, having been found innocent has been placed in

column No.2 of the challan by the I.O./ SHO and has

recommended his discharge from the charge. He contended

that the action of the SHO being in accordance with law,

has not caused any miscarriage of justice.

3. We have heard the respective submissions

advanced at the bar from both sides and perused the record

with their able assistance.

3. Under Section 169 Cr.P.C., the Investigating

Officer/S.H.O of the Police Station, is empowered to

release an accused on his executing a bond, with or without

sureties, when the charge is found groundless or the

evidence against him/her is deficient, which may not justify

the forwarding of the accused in the Court. For

convenience we would like to reproduce S. 169 Cr.P.C.:-

“169. Release of accused when evidence

deficient: If, upon an investigation under

this chapter, it appears to the Officer

Incharge of the Police Station, or to the

Police Officer making the investigation

that there is not sufficient evidence or

reasonable ground or suspicion to justify

the forwarding of the accused to a

Magistrate, such Officer shall, if such

person is in custody, release him on his

executing a bond, with or without

sureties, as such officer may direct, to

appear, if and when so required, before a

Magistrate empowered to take cognizance

of the offence on a police-report and to try

the accused or send him for trial”.

The main theme of this section is availability of sufficient

or deficient evidence on the basis of which the

Investigating Officer has to form opinion about guilt or

innocence of accused. Powers under section 169 Cr.P.C. is

to be exercised by the I.O. when he does not find sufficient

evidence or when he finds reasonable ground or suspicion

to justify the forwarding of the accused and in such

circumstance he may place his name in column No.2 of the

challan, and thereafter it would be the job of the trial Court

whether it agrees with the opinion of the I.O. or not. If the

Trial Court does not agree with the opinion of the I.O., it

may summon the accused placed in column No.2 of the

challan and may treat him as a regular accused by formally

charge sheeting him.

4. In this case, some evidence has been collected

by the I.0./SHO in support of plea of alibi of respondent-

accused Gul Zareen (DSP Police Department), according

to which he was found on his duty in Battagram,

on the day, date and time of incident. The Hon’ble

Supreme Court in case titled, “Sarwar and others Vs the

State and others” (2014 SCMR 1762), in an authoritative

judgment delivered by a larger Bench held as under:-

“Even in cases of the most heinous offences

the police was under no_ statutory

obligation to necessarily and straightaway

arrest an accused person during an

investigation as long as he was joining the

investigation and was cooperating with the

same”.
The only irregularity committed by the I.0./SHO in the
instant case, is that he while releasing the
respondent/accused Gul Zarin under section 169 Cr.P.C.
did not obtain his bail bond with or without sureties,
therefore, we direct the respondent-accused Gul Zarin to
submit bail bond to the tune of Rs.3,00,000/- with two
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of

learned Trial Court.

5. With the above observations, this petition

stands disposed of accordingly.

Announced.
