JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- This single judgment in

the instant petition shall also decide Criminal Miscellaneous (Q)
No. 23-P as similar question of law is involved in both these
petitions.

2. The petitioners have challenged their convictions and
sentences awarded by Additional Assistant Commissioner (Rev) /
Special Magistrate First Class Hangu dated 28/03/2020 whereby
they were sentenced for simple imprisonment for three months
and 100,000/ fine under section 6 & 9 of Food Stuffs Control Act,
1958, by exercising the powers under section 262 of Criminal
Procedure Code, 1898.

3. The letter dated 27" of march 2020 issued by the section
officer (security-I]) of Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Home & Tribal Affairs Department addressed to Deputy
Commissioners of 13 Districts including Hangu with the Subject:

Shopkeepers purportedly involved in hoarding of essential items,

with name address of the shopkeeper/ store owner. Though,
neither the petitioners were named in the list nor any separate
application/complaint was made against them, however they were
produced before Additional Assistant Commissioner (Rev)

Hangu, Special Magistrate of first class, on 28h march, 2020,
where they were tried summarily under Chapter XXII of Cr. P. C
and were sentenced and convicted through impugned order dated
28-03-2020. They have assailed their sentences and conviction
through respective appeals before learned Additional Sessions
Judge, Hangu, however the appeals were returned being not
appealable/competent. Hence these petitions.

4. On the point of maintainability arguments were on 27-04-
2020 and while considering that Price Control and Prevention of
profiteering and Hoarding Act, 1977 and Food Stuff Control Act,
1958 do not provide any provision of appeal, thus both these
petitions were held maintainable.

5. Arguments heard and record perused.

6. Section 2(h) of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 provides

the definition of compliant which reads as: -

(h)."Complaint”: Complaint means the allegation made
orally or in writing to a Magistrate, with a view to his taking
action, under this Code that some person whether known or
unknown, has committed an offence, but it does not include
the report of a police officer.

Likewise, Special Magisterial courts are constituted under section
14 of the ibid Act which is reproduced as under: -

(1) The Provincial Government may on the recommendation
of the High Court, confer upon any person all or any of the
powers conferred or conferrable by or under this Code on a
Judicial Magistrate in respect to particular cases or to a
particular class or particular classes of cases, or in regard to
cases generally in any local area.

(2) Such Magistrates shall be called Special Judicial
Magistrates, and shall be appointed for such term as the
Provincial Government may, in consultation with the High
Court by general or special order, direct.

(3) The Provincial Government may also appoint Executive
Magistrate for particular areas or for performance of
particular functions and confer upon them or any of the
powers conferred or conferrable by or under this Code on an
Executive Magistrate.

(4) Such Magistrates shall be called Executive Magistrates,
and shall be appointed for such term as the Provincial
Government may, by general or special order, direct:
Provided that no powers shall be conferred under this sub-
section on any police officer below the grade of Assistant
Superintendent, and no powers shall be conferred on a
police officer except so far as may be necessary for
preserving the peace, preventing crime and detecting,
apprehending and detaining offenders in order to their being
brought before a Magistrate, and for the performance by the
officer of any other duties imposed upon him by any law for
the time being in force.(5) The Provincial Government may
delegate, subject to such limitations as it thinks fit, to any
officer under its control the powers conferred by subsection

(3).

Accordingly, chapter XXII of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898,
deals with the summary trial of the offences with restrictive limb
as provided under section 260(c)(a) which is reproduced as under:

(a) offences not punishable with death, transportation or
imprisonment for term exceeding six months.
In the same manner section 262(2) of the ibid Act deals with

the limit of imprisonment which reads as: -

No sentence of Imprisonment for a term exceeding three
months shall be passed in the case of any conviction under
this Chapter.

Thus, it is manifested from the afore-mentioned provisions of the
code of criminal procedure that summary trial could not be
ordered for an offence entailing punishment exceeding six months
only those offences could be tried by the special Magistrate
summarily the sentence of which is less than six months, whereas
the offences for which the petitioners were charged under sections
3, 6 and 9 of the Food Stuffs Control Act, 1958, which for
convenience are reproduced as under: -

Section 3 (1) The Government, so far as it appears to it to
be necessary or expedient for maintaining supplies of any
foodstuffs or for securing its equitable distribution and
availability at fair prices, may, by notified order, provide for
regulating or prohibiting the keeping, storage, movement,
transport, supply, distribution disposal, acquisition, use or
consumption thereof and trade and commerce therein.

(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the powers
conferred by sub-section(1) an order made there under may
provide:

(a)for regulating by licences, permits or otherwise the
manufacture of any article of food from any foodstuffs;
(b)for controlling the prices at which any foodstuff may be
bought or sold;

(c)for regulating by licences, permits or other-wise, the
storage, transport, distribution, disposal, acquisition, use or
consumption of any foodstuff;

(d)for prohibiting the withholding from sale of any
foodstuff ordinarily kept for sale;
(e)for requiring any person holding stock of any foodstuff to
sell the whole or a specified part of the stock to such
persons or class of persons or in such circumstances as may
be specified in the order;

(ffor regulating or prohibiting any class of commercial or
financial transactions relating to any foodstuff which, in the
opinion of the authority making the order is, or is likely to
be, detrimental to public interest;

(g) for collecting any information or statistics with a view to
regulating or prohibiting any of the aforesaid matters; for
requiring persons engaged in the supply or distribution of,
or trade or commerce in, any foodstuffs, to maintain and
produce for inspection such books, accounts and records
relating to their business and to furnish such information
relating thereto as may be specified in the order; and (i) for
any incidental and supplementary matters including, in
particular, the entering and search of premises, vehicles,
vessels and aircraft, the seizure by a person authorized to
make such search of any articles in respect of which such
person has reason to believe that a contravention of the
order has been, is being, or is about to be committed, or any
records connected therewith, the grant or issue of licences,
permits or other documents, and the charging of fees
therefor.

Section 6. (1) If any person contravenes any order made
under section 3, he shall be punished with imprisonment for
a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or
with both and, if the order so provides, any Court trying
such contravention shall direct that any property in respect
of which the Court is satisfied that the order has been
contravened shall be forfeited to the Government, unless for
reasons to be recorded in writing, it is of the opinion that the
direction should not be made in respect of the whole, or as
the case may be, a part of the property.

(2) The owner of any vessel, conveyance or animal carrying
any property in respect of which an order under section 3 is
contravened, shall, if the carrying is part of the transaction
involving the contravention and if he knew or had reason to
believe that the contravention was being committed, be
deemed to have contravened the order, and, in addition to
the punishment to which he is liable under sub-section (1),
the vessel, conveyance, or animal shall when the order
provides for forfeiture of the property in respect of which
the order is contravened, be forfeited to the Government.

(3) If any person to whom a direction is given under
subsection (3) of section 3 fails to comply with the
direction, he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term
which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.
Section 9. If any person (i) when required by an order made
under section 3 to makes any statement or furnishes any
information, which is false in any material particular and
which he knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be
false, or does not believe to be true, or

(ii) makes any such statement as aforesaid in any book,
account, record, declaration, return or other document
which he is required by any such order to maintain or

a

furnish, he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term
which may extend to three years or with fine or with both.

7. Though the petitioners were convicted and sentenced under
the above-mentioned provisions of Food Stuffs Control Act, 1958,
however, warrant of imprisonment reveals that they were
convicted under sections 7 & 10 of price control and prevention of
profiteering and hoarding Act, 1977, whereunder Section 7 it was
provided as under: -

Section 7. (1) Any person who contravenes any order made
under section 3 or a notification issued, or order made under
section 6 shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term
which may extend to three years and with fine which may
extend to one lac rupees; Provided that, if a person
convicted for an offence punishable under this subsection is
again convicted for such offence, the term of imprisonment
awarded to him shall not be less than one year.(2)If the
order made under section 3 so provides, any Court trying
any contravention of such order may direct that any
property in respect of which the Court is satisfied that the
order has been contravened shall be forfeited by the Federal
Government.

Section 10. False Statement. If any person—(i)when required
by an order made under section 3 to make a statement or
furnish any information makes any statement or furnishes
any statement which is false in any material particular and
which he knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be
false, or does not believe to be true; or

(ii)makes any statement as aforesaid in any book, account,
record, declaration, return or other document which he is
required by any such order to maintain furnish, he shall be
punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend
to three years or with fine, or whit both.

8. Not only the offences for which the petitioners were charged,
convicted and sentenced either under the provisions of Food
Stuffs Control Act, 1958 or Price Control and Prevention of
Profiteering and Hoarding Act, 1977 provide the sentence which
may extend to three years but also the petitioners were not named
in the in the letter No. So (Security-I)/1-1/L&0O/2019 dated 27
march, 2020, of the subject of shopkeepers reportedly involved in
hoarding of essential items in all thirteen districts including
Hangu. Likewise, the accused of only those offences could be
tried summarily the punishment whereof is less than six months as

explicit from section 260(c)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code,
1898. No doubt the section 10(2) Food Stuffs (Control) Act, 1958
& section 11 of Price Control and Prevention of Profiteering and
Hoarding Act, 1977 provide that all the offences punishable under
these Act shall be tried summarily in consonance with the
procedure provided in chapter XXII of the Code, 1998. It is
pertinent to mention that section 5 of both the enactments
provided overriding effect which may be read as an addition to the
catalogue of cases enumerated in section 260, Cr. P.C. which
could prevail against the general provisions made in the Cr. P. C.
but when the petitioners were not named in the report / letter
issued by the government and when no evidence is available on
record against them then how they were entangled is a question
mark on the part of respondents regarding which when the learned
AAG was confronted he could not explained it and candidly
conceded that the petitioners were not named in the report,
however, added that during the course of investigation/inquiry
their names were surfaced. Although learned AAG agitated the
issue of involvement of petitioners in the commission of offence
yet the analysis of record shows that nothing was brought on
record to connect the petitioners with the commission of offence.
9. For the reasons discussed above, both these petitions are
allowed, the impugned orders are hereby quashed along with the
proceedings against the petitioners, they are on bail their bail bond
stands cancelled and sureties are discharged.
