SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- Through this
judgment, we shall also decide Cr.R No.182-P of
2021 titled “Muhammad Ayaz Vs Zarshad etc” as
both the matters have emanated from same
judgment dated 07.10.2021 of the learned
Additional Sessions Judge/Judge MCTC, Mardan
delivered in case FIR No.329 dated 02.06.2008
under sections 302/324/148/149 PPC of Police

Under section 302 (b) PPC for life as Tazir on two

which shall be payable to legal heirs of both the

Cr.PC, in default whereof he shall further undergo

shall be recoverable as arrears of land revenue
from the person and estate of convict.

Under section 148/149 PPC imprisonment for three

Under Section 324 PPC for attempted murder of

years with fine of Rs.20,000/-, in default whereof the
appellant shall further undergo for one month SI. All
the sentences shall run concurrently. Benefit under
section 382-B Cr.PC has been extended to him.

2. Briefly stated facts in the FIR are that on
02.06.2008 at 2100 hours, complainant Muhammad
Ayaz in injured condition reported the matter to the
police at Rustam Hospital, Mardan to the effect that
on the eventful night he alongwith his sons namely
Ehsanullah and Qaiser Shah were proceeding to
their house from Rustam Adda and when reached
to the place of occurrence at about 2040 hours,
there the accused Zarshad alongwith absconding
co-accused Naseeb Zada, Gul Zada, Saleh Zada
and Arshid were present duly armed with firearms in
a yellow Suzuki motorcar, who on seeing them

doboarded from the car and started indiscriminate
firing upon them. As a result of their fire shots, his
son Ehsanullah got hit and died on the spot while he
and his other son Qaiser got critically injured. The
occurrence was witnessed by Qaiser Shah (the then
injured), Ramzan and Qareebullah. Motive for the
occurrence was that a few months prior to the
occurrence an altercation had taken place between
the complainant party and the accused. He charged
the accused for the murder of his son Ehsanullash
and causing injuries to him and his other son Qaiser
Shah. Murasila was drafted and sent to the Police
Station for registration of FIR. Later on the other
injured namely Qaiser Shah also succumbed to the
injuries sustained by him in the present incident.

3. After arrest of the accused and completion of
investigation, case was put in Court where the
appellant was indicted to which he pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial. Prosecution, in order to
prove its case, produced and examined as many as
10 witnesses, whereafter statement of the accused
was recorded wherein he professed his innocence.
The learned trial Court, after conclusion of the trial,
found the appellant guilty of the charge and while
recording his conviction sentenced him as
mentioned above, hence this appeal. It is worth to

mention that the complainant through the criminal
revision has also sought enhancement of the
awarded sentence.

4. Arguments heard and record gone through.

5. The unfortunate incident claimed the lives of
two and the complainant survived after receiving
firearm injuries. The dead bodies and the injured
complainant were shifted to the hospital where the
complainant reported the matter, verified by the
eyewitness. The murasila was drafted, the injury
sheets and inquest reports were prepared, and after
doing the needful the injured complainant alongwith
the dead bodies was sent to the doctor, where the
complainant was medically examined and autopsy
on the dead bodies of the deceased was conducted.
The investigating officer after receiving copy of the
FIR visited the spot and on pointation of the
eyewitnesses prepared the site plan, during spot
inspection the investigating officer collected blood
stained earth from the respective places of the
deceased and injured and also recovered 14
empties of 7.62 bore near from the places assigned
to the accused. It is pertinent to mention that during
spot inspection an electric Bulb was also taken into
possession, which was installed on the outer wall of
one Pervez Khan and the same was packed and

sealed into a parcel. The accused after having been
charged remained fugitive from law and that it was
on 20.07.2018 that the appellant was arrested, who
faced the trial and ultimately was convicted by the
learned trial Court vide the impugned judgment.

6. — The learned trial Court took into consideration
the material aspects of the case and that after
scanning through the record convicted the appellant
vide the impugned judgment. The impugned
judgment was gone through with the able
assistance of the learned counsel for the parties,
where the learned trial Court dealt with the matter
comprehensively, and while handing down the
impugned judgment the learned judge was pleaded
to highlight the material aspects of the case. The
learned trial Court attempted to substantiate its
findings from the record of the case and statements
of the witnesses. This Court being the Court of
appeal is shouldering the responsibility to assess
and reassess the already assessed evidence, so
that miscarriage of justice could be avoided. True
that in the incident we have the injured complainant
alongwith the eyewitnesses, who witnessed the
incident, but the stamp of injuries on person of the
injured complainant by itself are not sufficient to
hold the appellant responsible for the death of the

deceased, rather this Court is to see the veracity of
the statement of the complainant and also the worth
of the statements of the eyewitnesses in order to
ascertain as to whether the incident occurred in the
mode, manner and at the stated time. This being
the Court of appeal is under the bounded duty to
walk with care, so that the innocent could be
rescued and the guilty could be punished.

7. The questions which this Court deems
necessary, to be determined are as to whether the
incident occurred in the mode, manner and at the
stated time; as to whether the eyewitnesses were
present at the time of incident and at the time of
report; as to whether it was the injured complainant
who reported the matter, or as to whether the report
was made by the police from its own and after
procuring the attendance of the witness the same
was signed from the complainant and from the
eyewitness; that as to whether the prosecution
succeeded in establishing the alleged motive and as
to whether the medical evidence supports the case
of the prosecution.

8. There is no denial to the fact that the incident
occurred at the stated place and that the
investigating officer succeeded in collecting blood
stained earth from the places of the deceased and

also the crime empties from the place of incident,
this Court is to see as to whether the presence of
the complainant and the eyewitness is established
from the record and as to whether the complainant
with the deceased was coming back from his shop
situated in Rustam Bazaar. The record tells that
both the accused and the complainant party were
closely related but having strained relationship since
long. The record further tells that both the parties
are the residents of the same village, but with their
houses situated away, from the place of incident. In
order to ascertain as to whether the incident
occurred in the mode, manner and at the stated
time, we deem it essential to go through the
statements of the witnesses i.e. the complainant
and the eyewitness. The complainant was
examined as PW-6, who stated that on the day of
incident after getting released from their business,
he alongwith the deceased was on his way back to
his home when they reached to the spot they came
across the eyewitness as well, when in the
meanwhile the accused, including the appellant
attracted to the spot in a motorcar, doboarded from
the same and started firing at them; that after
receiving firearm injuries the complainant got injured
whereas one of the deceased died on the spot and

the second in the hospital; that the incident was
witnessed in the light of a bulb installed on the outer
wall of the house of one Pervez Khan; that he
reported the matter in the hospital which was duly
explained to him and the eyewitness PW Ramzan
verified his report; that he was examined by the
doctor and his medico legal certificate was
prepared. The eyewitness was examined as PW-7,
who in his examination in chief supported the report
of the complainant and confirmed the source of
identification, as the light of a bulb installed on the
outer wall of one Pervez Khan. In order to know as
to whether the witnesses supported each other on
material aspects of the case and as to whether the
witnesses succeeded in convincing that the incident
occurred in the fashion as disclosed by them, we
went through their statements. The witnesses failed
to confirm the presence of their shops in the local
Bazaar and even no independent witness was
produced in that respect and as such the witnesses
failed to convince this Court that it was because of
their joint business that they were heading back to
their houses when the tragedy occurred. Even the
investigating officer could not collect any evidence
in that respect, more particularly no witness from
the said Bazaar was examined. When the most

important piece of evidence was left undetermined
and when the parties were lacking interest in that
respect, this Court is left with no other option but to
hold that the returning back from the shop was
introduced for the sole purpose to convince of their
presence on the spot at the time of incident. The
investigating officer did not investigate the case on
these particular lines and even he did not visit the
local bazaar to ascertain the veracity of the
statements of the witnesses and even no witness
was examined from the local bazaar who could
disclose the availability of the shops of the
complainant party, so the getting together of the
complainant, the deceased and the eyewitnesses
does not appeal to a prudent mind.

9. An other intriguing aspect of the case is the
presence of PW Ramzan on the spot at the time of
incident, he was examined as PW-7 who stated that
during the days of occurrence he was having his
business in Bunir and that it was his routine to reach
his village at the stated time and would join the
complainant party on his way to his home; that on
the day of incident he reached in routine and met
the complainant party near the place of incident and
thereafter the incident occurred. The explanation
tendered by the complainant regarding his presence

on the day and at the time of incident is after
10

thought. As on one hand no witness was produced
to confirm that during the days of occurrence PW
Ramzan was working in Bunir and even the
investigating officer did not visit Bunir to confirm the
same. The presence of the complainant and PW
Ramzan at the place of incident and at the time of
incident is nothing but a co-incidence which does
not appeal to a prudent mind and this particular
situation has been dealt with by the Apex Court in
case titled “Naveed Asghar and two others Vs
The State” (PLD 2021 Supreme Court 600) which
reads as follows:-

“16. Reading of the statement of
Mirza Muhammad Umar (PW-13)
shows that he is a chance witness:
a witness who in view of his place
of residence or occupation and in
the ordinary course of events is not
supposed to be present at the
place of the occurrence but claims
to be there by chance. Testimony
of such witness requires cautious
scrutiny and is not accepted unless
he gives satisfactory explanation of
his presence at or near the place of
the occurrence at the relevant
time.”

10. The witnesses during their cross-examination
disclosed that the accused attracted to the spot ina
motorcar and when the complainant party reached
to the place of incident, they deboarded and started

firing at them. On one hand the witnesses remained

inconsistent regarding the order in which the
11

accused were setting in the motorcar and on the
other the witnesses failed to tell that in which
manner they deboarded. This is astonishing to note
that five persons, duly armed with sophisticated
weapons, fired at the deceased, but the
eyewitnesses did not receive a single firearm injury.
In case all the accused would fire at the deceased,
there was hardly an occasion for the eyewitnesses
to survive.

11. This is admitted by the witnesses that the
accused were identified in the light of the bulb,
installed on the outer wall of one Pervez Khan. The
witnesses while recording their statements under
section 161 Cr.PC, before the investigating officer,
left no ambiguity that the accused were identified in
the bulb light which confirms that at the time of
incident the darkness had prevailed and that the
identity of the accused was possible only and only
in the light of the bulb. As while reporting the matter
the complainant remained silent that how the
assailants were identified, so the introduction of the
bulb is after thought and the same could not
convince the judicial mind of this Court. The
investigating officer, when appeared before the trial
Court stated that the same was recovered at a

belated stage and even the statement of the owner
12

of the house, from whose house the same was
removed, was not recorded. When such is the state
of affairs then this Court is not ready to accept the
availability of the bulb at the time of incident and
that in such eventuality the identity of the culprits
could not be established on the record.

12. The number of accused has_ been
exaggerated as for the death of the deceased and
for the injuries of the complainant as many as five
persons were charged, who were allegedly armed
with sophisticated weapons, but the number of
injuries on the dead bodies of the deceased and
that on the complainant are the factors which run in
conflict with the statements of the witnesses and
report of the complainant. Had all the accused fired
then the number of causalities would have been
more than the one in hand and that the
eyewitnesses would have not survived. The record
tells that as many as five male members of the
same family are charged and that it is for the
prosecution to convince that all of them participated
in killing of the deceased and causing injuries to the
complainant. Another intriguing aspect of the case
is, that the investigating officer during spot
inspection collected 14 empties from the spot, but

the same were not sent to the Fire Arms Expert to
13

determine that the same were fired from one or
different weapons. Had a single accused been
charged then it was less important to send the
recovered empties to the laboratory but in case of
five accused it was obligatory, but its non-sending to
the expert is a circumstance which the prosecution
could not overcome and which has damaged the
prosecution case beyond repair. It is important to
note that in the site plan Point B is given to the
empties which are lying just behind Point No.6& 7
and the same cannot be taken to have been fired by
all the five accused. Now this is for the prosecution
to tell that who out of the accused fired the fatal
shots. Once the effective role of the fire shots has
been attributed to all the accused, then it was for
the prosecution to prove that all the accused
actively participated, but the circumstances suggest
that the number of accused has been exaggerated.
The exaggeration on part of the prosecution is a
circumstance which shook the very foundation of
the prosecution case and that despite efforts the
witnesses could not reconcile. No ambiguity is left
that on one hand the witnesses suffer from
contradictions whereas on the other the number of
accused has been exaggerated, this particular

situation has beautifully been dealt with by the High
14

Court of Sindh in a case reported as “Waleed Shah
Vs The State” (2022 P Cr. L J Note 1) which reads
as:-

“It is, therefore, obvious that the
complainant has implicated as
many persons as possible from
the accused side. The net was
thrown wide deliberately in order
to ensure that no male member
from the accused side was spared
to pursue the criminal case.”

13. There is no denial to the fact that the
complainant was shifted to the hospital in injured
condition, but there is no denial from the fact as
well, that the complainant received injuries on the
most vital parts of his body. In order to ascertain as
to whether at the time of report the complainant was
conscious and oriented in time and space, we deem
it essential to go through the statement of the
scribe, to whom the report was made and to read
the statement of the doctor who examined the
injured complainant. It is interesting to note that
while reporting the matter, that too, in the hospital
the scribe did not feel the need to ask from the
doctor, a certificate, regarding the capability of the
complainant to talk, admittedly, neither any
certificate was obtained from the doctor, nor an
opinion of the doctor was sought to confirm that the
complainant was capable to talk. The severity of

injuries on body of the complainant is a factor which
15

cannot be lightly ignored and the same _ has
increased the anxiety of this Court regarding his
physical condition at the time, when he allegedly,
reported the matter. The doctor was examined as
PW-4 who stated that the injured was produced to
him alongwith the injury sheet and that thereafter
the injured was examined and his medico legal
certificate was prepared. The doctor also confirmed
that no opinion was asked by the scribe at the time
of report and that he was not associated with the
process. When on one hand it is admitted on record
that prior to report the doctor was not consulted, no
certificate was asked regarding the capability of the
complainant to talk and on the other the scribe was
not a medical expert, then in that eventuality the
report of the complainant needs corroboration from
independent sources. The issue in hand has been
dealt with by the august Peshawar High Court,
Peshawar in a judgment reported as “Wakeel Khan

Vs the State and another” (2021 YLRN 62).

“This is pertinent to mention that despite
the fact that the complainant was
seriously injured with having multiple
firearm injuries on his person but the
scribe did not feel the need to consult
the doctor and to request a certificate as
to whether the injured by then was
capable to talk and oriented in time and
space. The scribe (PW-06) stated that
as the patient was conscious and
capable to talk so he did not feel the
need either to consult a doctor before
the report or to ask for a certificate, the
conduct of the scribe is not only
16

abnormal but unnatural as well. There is
no denial to the fact that the matter was
reported in the emergency room of
D.H.Q Hospital, Lakki Marwat but
despite the availability of doctor and
other concerned the scribe went
reckless knowing the fact that his this
conduct will put a greater impact to the
prosecution case, as the only available
evidence was the statement of the
complainant.”

14. As in the instant case the eyewitness failed to
establish his presence on the spot at the time of
incident and also thereafter, so the sole statement
of the complainant, which too, is suffering from
inherent defects, by its self is not sufficient to hold
the appellant and rest of the accused responsible
for the tragedy. This is intriguing to note, that twice
the signature of the complainant was obtained, on
the murasila, but the scribe could not convince that
why such an unusual exercise was under taken, his
failure to explain, by itself is sufficient to tell that
soon after his arrival the complainant was not in
senses to report and that his signature was put by
the eyewitness. It was after the complainant
regained his senses that his genuine signature was
obtained. When such is the conduct of the
witnesses and when such is the conduct of the
scribe, then it is for the prosecution to suffer.

15. The medical evidence is in conflict with the

ocular account, as on one hand the consciousness
17

of the complainant, at the time of report, could not
be established and on the other the number of
injuries are not in consonance with each other, so
we are confirmed that the medical evidence is in
conflict with the ocular account. This conflict
between the two has further created dents in the
prosecution case and has added much to the scale
of the appellant. True that medical evidence is
confirmatory in nature and in presence of
eyewitness account the same plays a little role, but
we cannot ignore, that in case the witnesses are not
worthy of credence, then in that eventuality, the
conflict between the two plays a decisive role, more
particularly, in determining the liability of accused
charged.

16. The record tells that the motive between the
parties was a previous ill-will and in that respect few
FIRs are available on file, but the offences, for
which some of the accused were charged, in those
FIRs, were trivial in nature and the same would
hardly urge the accused to eliminate the deceased.
Even the investigating officer could not gather
supportive evidence in that respect. As the manner
in which the incident occurred does not appeal to a
prudent mind and even in respect of the motive no

independent witnesses were produced, which could
18

confirm that the motive was the only cause for the
instant tragedy. True that weakness or absence of
motive is hardly a ground to acquit the accused
charged, but equally true that when motive is the
constituent part, then the prosecution is under the
obligation to prove the same and its failure will help
only and only the accused charged.

17. The incident occurred way back in the year
2008, whereas, the convict-appellant has been
arrested, on 20.07.2018 and that he failed to explain
his long absence from the law enforcement agency,
but we cannot forget that abscondence alone is not
sufficient to convict, rather the prosecution must
come with strong evidence in support of its claim
and in that eventuality the abscondence is a factor
which can be taken into consideration. In the
instant case the witnesses failed to convince of their
presence on the spot and to convince of the manner
in which the incident occurred, so in the attending
circumstances of the case the long abscondence
on part of the appellant is hardly a ground to be
pressed into service.

18. The cumulative effect of what has been stated
above leads this Court to an irresistible conclusion
that the prosecution failed in bringing home guilt

against the appellant, and that the impugned
19

judgment is suffering from inherent defects, which
calls for interference. The instant criminal appeal is
allowed, the impugned judgment is set aside. The
appellant is acquitted of the charge leveled against
him. He be set at liberty forthwith, if not required to
be detained in connection of any other criminal
case.

19. As the appeal against conviction has
succeeded so the connected criminal revision
bearing No.182-P/2021 has lost its utility and the

same is dismissed as such.
