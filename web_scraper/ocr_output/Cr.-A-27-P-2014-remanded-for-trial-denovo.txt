JUDGMENT

settee
AHMAD ALI, J. Through this common
judgment we would propose to decide the
connected appeals bearing No.31-P/2014 titled
Yasir Shahzad Vs Abdul Wahab & another and
Cr.A No.32-P/2014 titled Bakhtiar alia Kala Vs
Abdul Wahab & another, being the outcome of
one and the same FIR.

2. In all the above mentioned appeals, the
appellants have questioned the judgment dated
11.01.2014, recorded by the learned Judge, Anti-
Terrorism Court-I, Peshawar, in case FIR No.301
dated 18.04.2013, under sections 365-A/302 PPC,
7-ATA, police Station Shaheed Gulfat Hussain,
Peshawar, whereby each of the appellant was

convicted and sentenced u/s 365-A to life
imprisonment; and u/s 302 to life imprisonment as
well. Both the sentences were directed to run
concurrently.

3. Brief facts of the case are that the accused-
appellants alongwith co-accused abducted the
minor Muhammad Shoaib son of the complainant
Abdul Wahab for ransom and due to fear of
exposure of their identify put the minor to death,
hence the instant criminal case vide FIR ibid.

4. After completion of investigation, complete
challan against the appellants was submitted
before the learned trial Court where they were
formally charged, to which they did not plead
guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution, in order
to prove its case against the appellants, examined
23 PWs. Thereafter, the appellants were examined
under section 342, Cr.P.C, wherein they professed
innocence and false implication. After hearing the
arguments, the learned trial Court convicted and
sentenced the appellants as mentioned above vide
impugned judgment dated 11.01.2014.

5. Arguments heard and record gone through.
6. After the case is argued at some length, it
revealed from the record that there were two
charges framed in the instant case by the learned

trial Court. First charge was framed against the
accused Bilal (minor of 14 years age) on
20.06.2013 whereas the 2â„¢ charge was framed on
23.07.2013 against accused Bilal (already charged
on 20.06.2013), Ali Raza and Bakhtiar alias
Kalay, while co-accused Yasir Shahzad (major)
appellant in Cr.A No.31-P/2014 and one other,
initially have become fugitive of law.

7. Formal charge framed by the learned trial
Court on 23.07.2013 against Bilal, does not
indicate the age of accused-appellants, while the
charge framed on 20.06.2013 against accused
Bilal indicates his age to be 14 years. Similarly
perusal of impugned judgment reveals that one of
the acquitted accused was a child and the other
three convicted co-accused/appellant are of the
ages of 17 to 21. Report of Standing Medical
Board also transpires the age of one of the accused
(Bakhtiar i.e. appellant in Cr.A No.32-P/2014) to
be 17-18 years. Section 2(b) of Juvenile Justice
System Ordinance, 2000 defines a child as a
person who at the time of commission of an
offence has not attained the age of eighteen years.
In such circumstances, the learned trial Court was
required to first determine exact ages of the other
accused-appellants before proceeding with the

case, because if found below the age of eighteen
years, the juvenile could not be tried together with
their adult co-accused Yasir Shahzad in view of
the provisions contained in section 5 of the
Ordinance ibid, reproduced below for ready

reference:--

"No joint trial of a child and adult person...

(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section
239 of the Code, or any other law for the time
being in force, no child shall be charged with or
tried for an offence together with an adult.

(2) If a child is charged with commission of an
offence for which under section 239 of the Code, or
any other law for the time being in force such child
could not be tried together with an adult, the
Court taking cognizance of the offence shall direct
separate trial of the child by the Juvenile Court."

Section 7 of the Ordinance ibid deals with

determination of age which is reproduced as

under:--

"If a question arises as to whether a person before it is
a child for the purposes of this Ordinance, the
Juvenile Court shall record a finding after such
inquiry which shall include a medical report for
determination of the age of the child."

The learned trial Court lost sight of above

provisions of law and tried both the appellants
jointly, thus the judgment is not sustainable in the
eye of law.

9. For the reasons mentioned above, we accept
the instant and connected criminal appeals (Cr.A
No.31-P/2014 & Cr.A No.32-P/2014), set aside

the impugned judgment of conviction and
sentence dated 11.01.2014 and remand the case to
learned Judge, Anti-Terrorism Court-I, Peshawar,
with the direction to first determine that what were
the ages of accused-appellants at the time of
commission of offence and then to proceed with
the case de-novo in the light of above observations
to be commenced on 12.10.2019 and complete the
same within two months, positively. Till then the
appellants shall remain as under-trial prisoners.
Office is directed to transmit the record to the

learned trial Court forthwith.
