JUDGMENT

ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- Impugned herein is the
order/judgment dated 09.02.2017 passed by learned
Judicial Magistrate-I/Ilaqa Qazi, Swat whereby

of the charge in case F..R No. 863 dated 05.09.2015
under Sections 489-F/420 P.P.C registered at Police
Station Mingora, District Swat.

2 Brief facts of the case are that a sale
deed was executed between the complainant Fazal

Aftab Alam. The latter handed over a cheque
bearing No. 8042723 dated 15.06.2015 of Habib

dishonored by the concerned bank on presentation
thereof for encashment. Complainant submitted an
application before D.P.O, Swat for taking legal
action against the accused, hence, the above referred
F.LR was registered against him. He was arrested in
the said F.LR whereafter the parties effected
compromise vide deed dated 02.04.2016 according
to which one Aman Khan stood surety for the
respondent and he issued to complainant a cheque
dated 06.05.2016 of Rs.500,000/- of Allied Bank
Ltd. Mingora Branch with further undertaking that
he will be responsible for payment of the said
amount to complainant in case the cheque was
dishonored. The compromise was presented in the
trial Court on the basis of which bail petition of the
respondent was allowed on 02.04.2016. The
subsequent bank cheque issued by surety Aman
Khan was also dishonored, hence, case vide F.I.R
No. 532 dated 27.05.2016 under Sections 489-F/420
P.P.C was registered against him at police station
Mingora. In that case, first an oral compromise was
effected between complainant and Aman Khan who
promised for payment of the outstanding amount
and thereafter a written compromise was effected

between them on the basis of which B.B.A of Aman

Khan was confirmed. In the meanwhile the
complainant died; Aman Khan who was accused in
the subsequent F.I.R was acquitted of the charge on
the basis of compromise. The present respondent
Aftab Alam was also acquitted of the charge by
learned Judicial Magistrate vide order/judgment
dated 09.02.2017 on the basis of compromise
effected by the parties at bail stage, hence, this
appeal.

3. Partial arguments in this case have
already been heard. Abstract of the arguments
advanced by learned counsel for the appellant is that
though in the compromise effected with Aman Khan
full payment of the outstanding amount to the
complainant has been mentioned but actually Aman
Khan has paid nothing to the complainant. He
further contended that the compromise effected with
the respondent was just for the purpose of bail,
therefore, his acquittal on the basis of that
compromise is illegal. He maintained that the case
has hotly been contested by father of the
complainant i.e the appellant as there was no
compromise between the parties in essence, but the
learned trial Court illegally acquitted the accused on

the basis of compromise without affording an

Tajamul/PS*

opportunity to the appellant for producing his
evidence. Learned State counsel supported the
arguments of learned counsel for the appellant.

4. Learned counsel for the accused
respondent during his arguments on the previous
date had referred to copies of compromise deeds and
submitted that pursuant to the compromise that was
effected between the complainant and respondent,
there is another compromise between the
complainant and Aman Khan in the subsequent
F.I.R whereby he paid an amount of Rs.500,000/- to
complainant which was outstanding against
respondent Aftab Alam. He further submitted that
copies of the compromise deeds and statement of the
complainant in support thereof is part of the record,
therefore, the learned trial Court has committed no
illegality by acquitting the respondent on the ground

that once a compromise is always a compromise.

Arguments heard and record perused.

The moot question in this case which
needs to be resolved by this Court is as to whether
compromise effected at bail stage can be considered
for acquittal of an accused during trial or not.
Section 345 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure

caters with the offences which can be compounded

{5.8} Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 72-M of 2017 Fazal Jameel through his father Vs. The State and one other)
Tajamul/Ps*

by the specified persons without intervention of
Court. These offences have been mentioned in a
table next following the said sub-section wherein the
offence under Section 489-F, P.P.C also figures.
Compromise in such offences takes effect from the
moment it is effected by the parties; the Court is
bound to pass an order in accordance with the terms
and conditions enumerated therein and the parties to
such compromise cannot resile from it at subsequent

stage of the trial. Wisdom in this regard is derived

from the case titled “Tarig Mehmood Vs. Naseer

Ahmad _and_ others” (PLD 2016 Supreme Court
347) wherein it has been held that:-

“Subsection (1) of Section 345, Cr.P.C enlists
the offences which may be compounded by the
specified persons without any intervention of
any Court and in some of the above
mentioned precedent cases it had been
clarified that compounding in such cases takes
effect from the moment the compromise is
completely entered into by the parties, the
relevant Court which is to try the offence in
issue is left with no jurisdiction to refuse to
give effect to such a compromise and a party
to such a compromise cannot resile from the
compromise at any subsequent stage of the

case”.
Z Admittedly, complainant had effected

compromise with accused/respondent on

02.04.2016. Copy of a deed to this effect is available
on record. The offence under Section 489-F, P.P.C
falls within the category of cases mentioned in Sub-
section (1) of Section 345, Cr.P.C, therefore, the
parties are bound by that compromise in view of the
principle laid down by the apex Court in the above
referred judgment. Thus, keeping in view the
provision under Sub-section (1) of Section 345,
Cr.P.C and the above referred judgment of the
august Supreme Court, the learned trial Court has
committed no illegality by acquitting the accused on
the basis of compromise entered by the parties at the
initial stage of the case.

8. Although, accused/respondent is also
charged in this case under Section 420, P.P.C which
falls in the category of cases mentioned under Sub-
section (2) of Section 345, Cr.P.C which cannot be
compounded without intervention of the Court but
from the allegations leveled in the F.LR, the case is
purely of Section 489-F, P.P.C and no ingredient of
Section 420, P.P.C could be found therein, therefore,
there is no application of the said section of law in
the present case. It appears that police have inserted
Section 420, P.P.C on its own as the contents of the

F.1L.R constitute only the offence under Section

(S.8) Mr. Justicg Ishtiag Ibrahim
{C1.A No. 72-M of 2017 Fazal Jomeel through his father Vs. The State and one other)

489-F, P.P.C. In the view of this Court, mere
insertion of Section 420, P.P.C in the case without
any accusation to this effect in the F.ILR is
misconceived, therefore, it will not affect acquittal
of the respondent/accused on the basis of
compromise effected at bail stage.

Lz Record shows that complainant effected
compromise with Aman Khan in the subsequent
F.LR at the time when his B.B.A was sub-judice
before the learned Additional Sessions Judge-IIl,
Swat. His B.B.A was confirmed vide order dated
22.08.2016 on the basis of compromise exhibited at
that stage as Ex.PA, in support of which the
complainant recorded his statement. According to
this compromise and statement of the complainant
recorded before the Court, Aman Khan paid
Rs.500,000/- to complainant which is the bone of
contention in the present case. It means that at
present no amount of the complainant or his father is
outstanding against the accused respondent Aftab
Alam. Contention of the appellant that actually no
amount has been paid by Aman Khan to
complainant, does not appeal to reason as how could
the complainant verify the contents of the

compromise with Aman Khan by recording his

statement before the Court without receiving the
outstanding amount from him. This aspect of the
case also shows that the controversy between the
parties has already been resolved through private
patch up during the life of the complainant and
further proceedings in the matter would be just a
futile exercise.

10. For what has been discussed above, the
impugned order/judgment is maintained and this
appeal, being devoid of merits, is dismisse¢/

Announced.
