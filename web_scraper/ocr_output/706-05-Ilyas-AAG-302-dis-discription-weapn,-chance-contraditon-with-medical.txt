JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- This criminal appeal

has been directed against the judgment dated 13.09.2005
passed by learned Additional Sessions judge-V,
Charsadda, whereby the accused-respondent, Ilyas Gul
involved in a case FIR No. 651, dated 01.10.2000 under
section 302/324/34 PPC of Police Station, Batagram, was
acquitted of the charges.

2. The prosecution story, as reflected from the record,
is that on 01.10.2000 complainant Malik Aman lodged a
report to the effect that on the day of occurrence, he along
with Arshad Khan and Murtaza was present on the
thoroughfare situated near his house when at 09.45 hours
accused Hamyun, Gulzar, Ijaz and Ilyas duly armed came

and at once started firing at them, as a result of fire shot of
accused Ilyas, his brother Arshad was hit and died at the
spot while he and his uncle Murtaza escaped from their
firing. The accused after commission of the offence fled
away from the spot. Motive for the offence was dispute
over landed property. The report of complainant was
recorded in shape of FIR Exh. PA by Syed Qasim Shah,
ASI, (PW-9). He prepared inquest report and injury sheet
of the deceased and sent dead body of the deceased to the
mortuary under the escort of Inayat Ullah (PW-1).

3. Dr. Jahangir (PW-8) conducted postmortem
examination of deceased Arshad Khan and found the
following injury on his person:-

1. Firearm injury inlet wound on the chin 1
cm x lcm.

2. Firearm injury inlet wound on the occipital
region 1 4 c.m.

3. Firearm injury grazing wound on the right
side of throat.

He also found Scalp, skull, vertebrae, membranes,
brain, spinal cord and blood vessels of thorax as injured.
According to his opinion, the deceased died due to severe
bleeding and shock caused by firearm injury. He recorded
probable time between injury and death as half an hour
while between death and P.M about one and half hour.
The P.M documents are marked as Ex.PM, Exh.PM/1,
Ex.PM/2 and Exh.PM/3.

4. Syed Qasim Shah (PW-9) after recording report of

the complainant visited the spot and prepared the site plan
Exh.PQ at the instance of complainant and eyewitness
Murtaza Khan. During spot inspection, he recovered two
empties of 7.62 bore and blood stained earth from the spot
vide recovery memo Exh PR and Exh.PR/1 in presence of
the marginal witnesses. He also took into possession blood
stained garments of the deceased sent by the medical
officer vide memo ExPR/2. He also sent blood stained
articles to Forensic Science laboratory and its report is
ExPZ/1. Accused Hamayun, Gulzar and Ijaz were arrested
in the case while accused-respondent Ilyas was avoiding
his lawful arrest, therefore, warrant of arrest under section
204 Cr.P.C, followed by notices under section 87 Cr.P.C
were issued against him. After completion of
investigation, PW-9 submitted the case file to SHO
concerned, who submitted complete challan in the case.

5. On receipt of challan under section 173 Cr.P.C,
accused Hamayun, Gulzar and Ijaz faced the trial and after
conclusion of the trial, learned trial court acquitted them,
vide judgment dated 07.08.2003, while the present
accused-respondent Ilyas was declared as proclaimed
offender. After arrest of the accused-respondent on
14.05.2004 and submission of supplementary challan
against him, it was forwarded to the court of Learned
Additional Sessions Judge-V, Charsadda, for trial, who,

on its conclusion, vide judgment dated 13.09.2005,
recorded his acquittal, hence, the instant appeal by the
Complainant Shah Jehan.

6. Learned counsel for the appellant and AAG
contended that it was a day light occurrence and the
accused-respondent was also charged by the complainant,
for effective firing at the deceased in a promptly lodged
FIR but the learned trial court in presence of
straightforward testimony of complainant (PW-6) and
eyewitness Murtaza (PW-10) duly supported by the
testimony of investigating officer (PW-9) as well as
circumstantial evidence in shape of medical evidence,
recovery of two 7.62 bore empties from the spot, blood
stained earth and garments of the deceased coupled with
longstanding abscondance of the accused-respondent as a
result of misreading and non-reading of evidence its true
perspective acquitted him of the charge by considering
minor discrepancies which in no way were fatal to the
prosecution case, therefore, the impugned judgment is
liable to be set aside and the accused-respondent may be
awarded punishment in accordance with law.

7. On contrary, learned counsel for the accused-
respondent submitted that it was an unseen occurrence but
complainant with the connivance of police procured the
complainant and Murtaza Khan from the place of their
business at Peshawar, who had falsely involved the

accused-respondent along with three others for the
commission of offence. He contended not only there are
glaring contradictions in the testimony of complainant
and the alleged eyewitness Murtaza Khan but on the same
set of evidence co-accused have already been acquitted
which judgment is still in field and, as such, supported the
impugned judgment.

8. We have listened arguments of learned counsel for
the parties and gone through record of the case.

9. The record reveals that four persons, including the
present accused-respondent, were charged by _ the
complainant for indiscriminate firing at the deceased
Arshad Khan, besides ineffective firing at the complainant
and eyewitness Murtaza Khan, however, the effective role
was attributed to the present accused-respondent. Three of
the accused, namely, Hamayun, Gulzar and Ijaz after
full-fledged trial were acquitted by the trial court on
07.08.2003. The entire case of the prosecution against the
present accused-respondent hinges on the ocular account
given by complainant Malik Aman (PW-6) and Murtaza
Khan (PW-10), recovery of two empty shells of 7.62 bore
and blood stained earth from the spot,Medical evidence,
Motive and abscondance of the accused-respondent.
Since the most important role in the case is that of the
ocular account, therefore, in our view, we would like to
discuss it first of all by making careful appraisal of the

same to draw conclusion as to whether they were present
at the spot and, if so, their testimony is worthy of
credence, believable and whether their conduct is natural
and in accordance with the ordinary human conduct or
otherwise. From the perusal of contents of FIR, it is
evident that the complainant in his first report charged
four persons for indiscriminate firing at them and further
clarified that it was the fire shot of the present accused
Ilyas, which proved effective but, strangely enough, he
has not disclosed the type of weapons, which the accused
were carrying at the time of occurrence despite the fact
that, as per site plan the complainant and the assailants
were very close to each other at the time of occurrence,
therefore, there was no occasion or chance for the
complainant to omit the description of the crime weapon
possessed and used by each  accused-respondent.
Moreover, complainant in his cross examination admitted
that during the days of occurrence, he used to run a shop
in the Gor Mandy in Peshawar. Similarly, PW Murtaza
Khan stated that during the days of occurrence he was
running business of shopping bags in Bashir Abad
Peshawar, while Alamzeb (PW-4), who is marginal
witness to the recovery memo Ex.PR and Ex.PR/1 was
also associated with him. They tried to give explanation of
their presence at the spot and stated that on the day of
occurrence it was Sunday but their explanation is not

plausible because they were not government servants.
They were businessman and Sunday was not holiday for
the business community. They also failed to explain as to
for what purpose all the three were present on the
thoroughfare. It has now been well settled that for
conviction of an accused person it would be highly unsafe
to rely upon testimony of a chance witness when remained
uncorroborated and for conviction of a accused on capital
charge on the basis of testimony of chance witness, the
court has to be at guard and corroboration has to be sought
for relying upon such evidence. Reliance: 2017 SCMR
1710 Anwar Begum vs. Akhter Hussain. Besides the above,
yet another attempt can be made to adjudge the
truthfulness or otherwise of their evidence on merits to
ascertain whether evidence furnished by them has any
intrinsic value for bringing the guilt home against
accused-respondent or not. As per contents of FIR, the
deceased on receipt of injuries at the hands of the accused-
respondent at 09.45 hours died at the spot but his this
statement is totally belied by the medical evidence as well
as statement of Inayatullah (PW-1) who had escorted the
dead body of the deceased from Police Station to the
Mortuary. The occurrence, as per record, took place at
09.45 a.m while the medical report reveals that the
deceased died at 10.50 a.m. Dr. Jahangir Khan (PW-8),
who had conducted autopsy, in the first line of his cross

examination stated that it has correctly been recorded in
the column of death that it was occurred at 10.50 a.m.
Similarly, PW-1 stated in his cross examination that he
escorted the dead body of the deceased at 11.00 a.m from
the Police Station while as per medical report the P.M was
conducted at 10.50 a.m, before the receipt of dead body of
the deceased. Apart from the above, Alam Zeb PW-4 in
cross examination stated that he reached to the spot after
5/6 minutes of the occurrence and when he came out of
the house the deceased Arshad Khan was lying dead on
the spot. He further stated that at the time of recovery
from the spot the dead body of the deceased was not yet
brought from the Police Station while the complainant
during cross examination stated that Alam Zeb PW came
to the village along with the dead body. The reappraisal of
statements of both the PWs lead us to draw an inference
that evidence furnished by them suffer from inherent
improbabilities, improvements and contradictions which
are sufficient to discard their evidence. It is cardinal
principle of jurisprudence that to disbelieve a witness it is
not necessary that there should be numerous infirmities
and if there is one which impeaches the credibility of the
witness that may make the entire statement doubtful.
From the perusal of their statements it is evident that
presence of both the eyewitnesses on the spot is highly

doubtful.
10. No doubt, medical evidence supports the
prosecution story to the extent that the deceased died due
to fire arm injury and not beyond but medical evidence
does not establish either identity or the involvement of the
accused in the crime. Medical evidence can be used to
support the ocular testimony or any other incriminatory
evidence but in the present case ocular testimony having
been found not confidence inspiring, therefore, the same is
of no use to prosecution.

11. So far as the abscondance of the accused-
respondent is concerned, it is also of no use to prosecution
because it can neither remove the defects of the oral
evidence nor is itself sufficient to justify the conviction.
Reliance is placed on the case Rohtas Khan vs. The
State (2010 S C M R 566) wherein it has been held that
conviction cannot be sustained on abscondance of accused
alone.

12. The gist of the above discussion is that the presence
of PW-6 and PW-10 was highly doubtful at the time of
occurrence as they failed to explain their presence in a
satisfactory manner at the place of occurrence and their
testimony has not been corroborated by any independent
evidence. It is well settled principle of law that
prosecution primarily is bound to establish guilt against
the accused without shadow of reasonable doubt by

producing trustworthy, convincing and coherent evidence
10

and if Court comes to the conclusion that the charge so
leveled against the accused has not been proved beyond
reasonable doubt, then the accused becomes entitled for
his acquittal on getting benefit of doubt. Rule of benefit of
doubt is essentially a rule of prudence which could not be
ignored while dispensing justice in accordance with law.
Said rule is based on the maxim “it is better that ten guilty
person be acquitted rather than one innocent person be
convicted” which occupied a pivotal place in the Islamic
Law and is enforced strictly in view of the saying of the
Holy Prophet (p.b.u.h) that the “mistake of Qazi (Judge)
in releasing a criminal is better than his mistake in
punishing an innocent”. It has been now settled that
conviction must be based on unimpeachable evidence and
certainty of guilt and any doubt arising in the prosecution
case must be resolved in favour of the accused. Wisdom is
derived from the case titled reported as Muhammad
Khan and another vs. The State, 1999 SCMR 1220 and
Muhammad Ikram vs. The State (2009 S C M R 230).

13. Moreover, law relating to appraisal of evidence in
appeals against acquittal is stringent, because the
presumption regarding innocence of accused is doubled
and multiplied after accused is found not guilty by a
competent Court of law and such findings cannot be upset,
disturbed and reversed except when the impugned

judgment is found to be perverse, shocking, alarming,
11

artificial and suffering from jurisdictional error or
misreading or non-reading of evidence. Wisdom is
derived from the case Muhammad Yaqoob .vs. Manzoor

Hussain and three others (2008 S C MR 1549).

14. In the light of above discussion, it is difficult to hold
that the judgment of the trial court is either perverse or is a
result of complete misreading or non-reading of evidence on
record. As such, this appeal being without any merit is
dismissed.
