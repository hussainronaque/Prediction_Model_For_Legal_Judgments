asked her about deceased Hameedullah to which he

replied that he is busy in ablution, so she was asked to

hand over the cell phone to her brother which she

accordingly handed over to him and after short

conversation, her brother stated that he is going with

the accused and will return soon. He left the house on

the motorcycle and had left the mobile set at home, but

In cross-examination she admitted that the

Judicial Magistrate recorded her statement after 12

days of the occurrence, but she did not disclose any

reason for the delay in recording of her statement and

similarly, no motive has been disclosed but has

charged the accused due to the reason that he had

called her brother on the night of occurrence. No other

source of information has been divulged by her and no

eye witness has come forward.

PW-11 stated to have found dead body of some

unknown person on 05.3.2015, when he came to his

deceased and the accused are Ex.PW13/3 which

alleges to reveal the contacts between the accused and

occurrence. Ex.PW13/4 are the photographs of the

place of occurrence and Ex.PW13/5 is application for

producing the complainant and Mst. Shabana (PW-10)

before the Judicial Magistrate. Proceedings under

sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C are produced as

Ex.PW13/6 and Ex.PW13/7 while the report of FSL

about the blood stained earth and empties recovered

from the spot are Ex.PW13/8 and Ex.PW13/9. Accused

was arrested on 30.10.2015, who allegedly confessed

the guilt before him. The said investigation report is

Ex.PW13/11. The accused is stated to have produced

his mobile phone set Samsung. He has further affirmed

the contents of pointation memo and USB Ex.P.Z.

In cross-examination he stated that the accused

was arrested on 03.10.2015 while in examination-in-

chief he disclosed the date as 30.10.2015. The accused
-12-

allegedly confessed his guilt on 06.10.2015 before him

and his statement was not recorded before 06.10.2015.

He further added that the accused was charged by the

complainant and Mst. Shabana in their statements

under section 161 Cr.P.C recorded on 17.8.2015, but

again added that the statements were recorded on

06.8.2015 while the occurrence had taken place on

03.8.2015. He has supported the statement of PW-10

Mst. Shabana to the extent of handing over of mobile

phone by her to her deceased brother. He admitted that

the accused has not confessed his guilt before the

Court and it is an unseen occurrence. He denied to

have planted the recoveries in connivance with the

complainant and that the confessional statement of

accused is concocted and obtained by torture.

3. We have heard arguments of learned

counsel for the parties and perused the record.

4. Analysing the statements of complainant

PW-9 and PW-10, father and sister of deceased

Hameedullah are consistent on the point of lack of
-13-

motive or any previous ill will or enmity between the

parties. The source of information of murder is alleged

to be information of PW-10 as disclosed by

complainant. PW-10 has stated that the phone call of

accused Kashif was received on the mobile phone of

deceased because they were friends but no covert or

overt act is brought forth to suggest involvement of the

accused/respondent in the murder of deceased

Hameedullah. Receiving a phone call ipso facto is not

an incriminating act for conviction provided it is

coupled with other incriminating circumstances as

recovery of crime weapon and duly matching with the

empties recovered from the spot that are proved to be

fired from the crime weapon. Preparation of site plan

on the pointation of accused too is not proved through

any other independent and disinterested witnesses so

that it may be confidence inspiring and lend strong

support and corroborate the medical evidence. There

are substantial contradictions in the statements of

witnesses of prosecution that has rendered the case of
-14-

prosecution highly doubtful. The alleged call data

record (CDR) and USB Ex.P.Z consisting of alleged

recording of confession of guilt by the

accused/respondent being part of electronic devices

data requires stringent procedure to be proved as

incriminating evidence to connect the accused with the

commission of offence.

5. At the first instance the admissibility of

Ex.PW13/4 alleged interrogation report consisting of

confessional statement would be considered. Article 38

of Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 provides that no

confession made to a police officer shall be proved as

against the person accused of any offence, makes the

said statement inadmissible in evidence. Even

admissibility of a document would not absolve the

maker thereof to prove its contents. Prosecution has

tried to prove the same through Ex.P.Z which is a USB

allegedly having recording of confession by

accused/respondent, but production of a document and

proof thereof has to be proved in accordance with
-15-

Artilce 78 of Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order. Before a

conviction is to be recorded on a _ confessional

statement its true and voluntary character must be

satisfied besides some other independent piece of

direct, substantial and circumstantial evidence that

corroborates the recording of confession. No effort

whatsoever has been made to confront the accused

with the recording in USB by playing the same in

Court. It amounts to acquiescence on the part of

prosecution that is sufficient to discard the same.

6. The next evidence alleged to be

incriminating evidence is call data record (CDR) as

stated by PW-10 Mst. Shabana, sister of deceased that

when he was having ablution while preparing for Isha

prayers she received the call of accused Kashif and

then handed over the phone to her deceased brother

who attended the call and left the house to meet the

accused. CDR data is electronically prepared record

that can be proved through concerned expert official

that is legally authorized to record such data. No such
-16-

official has been produced in evidence in order to

conform to the requirements of Articles 46-A and 78-A

of Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order and in absence thereof it

may be a relevant fact but not an evidence.

7. Another important aspect is alleged

recovery of motorcycle owned by deceased but the

same is neither recovered from the accused, on the

pointation of accused or from the place proved to be

owned by the accused. PW-3 Muhammad Nawaz has

recovered the motorcycle vide Mud No.19 dated

07.8.2015 Ex.PA near Elementary College IDPs Camp

Bannu when he was on routine Gasht. The date of

occurrence is 05.8.2015 two days prior to the recovery.

No effort has been made to prove that accused had left

the same at the relevant place. If an accused person is

connected with the commission of any offence unseen

and un-witnessed he may face conviction and

statement of complainant might be used as

corroborative evidence as laid down by Hon’ble

Supreme Court in case reported as (2006 SCMR 1786)
-17-

and (2006 SCMR_ 1801) though sometimes

corroborative evidence further requires corroboration

through independent source. It is held that medical

evidence is not substitute of direct evidence rather is

only a source of corroboration in respect of nature of

injury, the kind of weapon used, the duration between

injury and death and may confirm the occular account

but would not establish the identity of accused or

connect him with the commission of offence, therefore,

in the absence of medical evidence may not be fatal if

the charge of murder is otherwise proved.

8. Interference with an order of acquittal

could not be ruled out if it is proved that material

evidence is disregarded, evidence is misread and such

evidence is received illegally. Obvious result of such

case would be that no reasonable person would

conveniently reach such conclusion. Having

considered all the evidence and judgment of acquittal

passed by learned trial Court, no illegality or material

irregularity or violation of settlement norms required
-18-
for appreciation of evidence has been pointed out so as
to arrive at a different conclusion other than acquittal.
Hence the instant appeal stands dismissed.
