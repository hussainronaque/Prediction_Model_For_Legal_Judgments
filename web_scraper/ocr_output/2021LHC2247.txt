JUDGMENT

Date of Hearing 22.06.2021

For Appellant Mr. Muhammad Ilyas Siddiqui Advocate

Complainant by | Malik Jawwad Khalid Advocate

For State Ms. Maimoona Ehsan-ul-Haq DDPP

SOHAIL NASIR, J. Aqil Zaman (appellant) had faced trial
in case FIR No. 254 (PH) recorded on 29.08.2015 under Sections

302/324/34 PPC at Police Station City Rawalpindi on the complaint
of Hayat Khan (Pw-7) for the allegations of commission of Qatal-e-
Amd of Sameen Jan (brother of complainant). On conclusion of
trial vide judgment dated 19.09.2020 passed by learned Additional
Sessions Judge, Rawalpindi he was convicted under Section 302(b)
PPC and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was ordered to pay
Rs.500000/- (five lacs) as compensation in terms of Section 544-A
Cr.P.C to the legal heirs of deceased. In default of payment fine he
was ordered to further undergo six months SI. Benefit of Section
382-B, Cr.P.C was also extended to him.

2. Feeling aggrieved from the judgment of learned Trial Court
appellant has challenged his conviction through this criminal appeal.
3. Facts of the case as evident from complaint (PM) are that
upon receipt of information of this occurrence Mukhtar Hussain SI
(Pw-14) arrived at DHQ Hospital, Rawalpindi, where he recorded
the statement of Hayat Khan (Pw-7). He maintained that he along
with his brother Sameen Jan (deceased) and Umar Farooq (Pw-12)
were running their business at National Market Bara Bazaar with the
title of “Hayat Traders’; on that day (29.08.2015) at about 05:00 pm
they were going to Mosque for offering the prayer and when they
reached near street No. 3, National Market, close to the shop of Raja

Hameed Arslan Traders there emerged Aqeel Zaman (subsequently
Criminal Appeal No.430 of 2020 2

his name was declared as Aaqil Zaman) armed with 30 bore pistol,
Adeel Zaman (his name was corrected later on as Abid Zaman)
armed with iron rod and Rohail Ameen (later on his name was said
as Rooh-ul-Ameen) armed with 30 bore pistol; Rooh-ul-Ameen
raised a lalkara not to spare them, whereupon Aqil Zaman
(appellant) fired a shot on him/Hayat Khan, which did not hit him;
appellant made another fire that hit on the left side of abdomen of
Sameen Jan, who being injured fell down on the ground; Adeel
Zaman announced that the assignment was complete and then all
three accused while making firing escaped from there. The motive
alleged was that on 27.08.2015, there was exchange of hot words
between Sameen Jan on one side and Aqil Zaman and Rooh-ul-
Ameen on the other side.

4. Mukhtar Hussain SI (Pw-14) made his endorsement on the
complaint and sent it to police station on the basis of which, FIR
was recorded by Tahir Mehmood SI (Pw-3).

5. On the same day Hayat Khan (complainant) made a
supplementary statement (DB) where he corrected the names of all
accused. In addition to the allegations leveled in FIR he through the
same supplementary statement added that a fire also made by Rooh-
ul-Ameen had hit on the left knee of Sameen Jan.

6. In, earlier round Abid Zaman and Rooh-ul-Ameen had faced
trial because appellant was absconder. They were acquitted vide
judgment dated 04.10.2017 passed by learned Additional Sessions
Judge Rawalpindi, who had disbelieved the supplementary
statement of Hayat Khan. Complainant filed criminal appeal (1040
of 2017) before this Court, which was dismissed vide a judgment
dated 21.10.2019.

7. In second round it was 07.10.2019 when appellant was
arrested and faced trial.

8. A charge under Sections 302/324/34 PPC was framed against
appellant on 03.12.2019 for which he pleaded not guilty and

demanded his trial.
Criminal Appeal No.430 of 2020 3

9. In support of its case prosecution had produced following
witnesses: -

Pw-1 Khurram Shahzad, prepared scaled
site plan.

Pw-2 Sajjad Ahmad/HC is a witness to the
execution of warrants and proclamation of
appellant.

Pw-3_ Tahir Mehmood SI is the author of
FIR.

Pw-4 Muhammad Zameer Constable is a
witness to recovery of iron rod at the instance
of Abid Zaman (since acquitted).
Pw-5_Sagheer Hussain HC being Moharrar
kept parcels in Malkhana and transmitted to
concerned office.

Pw-6 Zafar Igbal/HC is a witness to the
arrest of Rooh-ul-Ameen, his personal search
and recovery of pistol at his instance

Pw-7 Hayat Khan is the complainant and
eye-witness.

Pw-8 Doctor Ghulab Shah had conducted the
postmortem examination of deceased Sameen
Jan.

Pw-9 Sajid Ullah Constable escorted the
dead body for postmortem examination.
Pw-10 Abid Shah SI had arrested Abid

witness to recovery of pistol at the instance of

appellant.
Pw-14 Mukhtar Hussain SI is the first
investigation officer.
Pw-15 Shabbir Hussain SI is __ the
Investigating Officer, who arrested the
appellant and made subsequent investigation.
10. Qaim Din, Jahanzaib, Zaheer Khan, Shabbir Ahmad
Constable and Munir Ahmad Constable were given up being
unnecessary by learned ADPP, who after producing the reports of
expert (PAA and PBB) had closed prosecutions’ evidence.
11. Inhis examination made under Section 342 Cr.P.C, version of

appellant was that the case was based on malafide and false

implication and attempt to rope the innocent person in the case
Criminal Appeal No.430 of 2020 4

started from registration to FIR through supplementary statement
and medical evidence. He opted to produce defence evidence but did
not desire to appear in terms of Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. Later on, he
simply produced certain documents in his defence which were
pertaining to trial of his co-accused.

12. Learned counsel for appellant contends that prosecution case
is smashed by complainant himself when he made supplementary
statement by introducing another fire shot attributing to Rooh-ul-
Ameen on the knee of Sameen Jan and that was disbelieved not only
by the Trial Court but this Court also; if supplementary statement is
considered, prosecutions’ case shall remain doubtful and if
discarded, even then it is a case of contradiction between medical
and ocular account; keeping in view the allegation of firing against
Rooh-ul-Ameen, his acquittal has given a legitimate right to
appellant seeking his acquittal also because appellant is placed in
similar position. He finally maintains that as prosecution has badly
failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt against appellant,
therefore he deserves for acquittal.

13. On the other hand, learned DDPP and learned counsel for
complainant jointly contend that appellant was an absconder and his
said conduct is strong barrier in his way for demanding acquittal; no
doubt that two persons were acquitted earlier but the roles assigned
to them were different, hence appellant cannot take any benefit of
their clearance from this case; it is settled principle of law that
statement of a witness can be partially believed, therefore, the
learned Trial Court rightly convicted the appellant; medical
evidence is in corroboration to the ocular account, which is
supported from recovery of pistol and report of PFSA. They finally
contend that the learned Trial Court on the basis of well reasoned
judgment has rightly declared the appellant as guilty of the crime
and there is no occasion for this Court to interfere in the said
verdict.

14. HEARD
Criminal Appeal No.430 of 2020 5

15. This case is quite specific with regard to occurrence because
in complaint (PM) on the basis of which FIR (PC/1) was also
recorded, there are the allegations that appellant made a fire that hit
on the right side of abdomen of Sameen Jan whereas a fire made by
Rooh-ul-Ameen (since acquitted) on Hayat Khan did not hit him. It
is evident from the statement of Mukhtar Hussain SI (Pw-14) that
on the same day Hayat Khan made a supplementary statement
where he stated that another fire was made by Rooh-ul-Ameen that
hit on the knee of the deceased. In earlier trial Rooh-ul-Ameen and
Abid Zaman were acquitted vide judgment dated 04.10.2017 passed
by learned Additional Sessions Judge, who did not believe the
supplementary statement and was of the view that complainant was
responsible for improvements in his statement, while assigning the
second fire on deceased to Rooh-ul-Ameen. Said acquittal order was
not interfered by this Court in appeal filed by complainant and that
was dismissed vide judgment dated 21.10.2019. What is the effect
of acquittal of two accused that shall be discussed subsequently.

16. Ihave gone through the statement of Hayat Khan (Pw-7) and
astonished to see that during this trial he has negated any
supplementary statement and what case of him was that: -

“T stated before police two fires hit the
deceased but police recorded one fire”

17. In his examination-in-chief he never said that he made any
supplementary statement in this case, therefore, question before the
Court is that after a long time to say that there was an omission on
the part of Investigating Officer is a correct story or not? For this
purpose, I have gone through the statement of Mukhtar Hussain SI
(Pw-14) who arrived in hospital and recorded the statement (PM) of
complainant. In his examination-in-chief he categorically stated as
under: -

“I recorded supplementary statement of
complainant”
Criminal Appeal No.430 of 2020 6

18. The complaint which is well drafted and a detailed document
makes it clear that after it was recorded, the same was read over to
the complainant by the Investigating Officer, he/complainant
accepted the contents thereof as correct without any reservation and
then he signed the same.

19. The conduct of complainant is a strong barrier in his way, for
granting him a stamp of truth. If Court finds that he made a
supplementary statement, how it can be ignored that said portion of
allegation has already been disbelieved. If, I consider that there was
no supplementary statement at all and the complaint was correctly
recorded because it was read over to the complainant before he
signed it, then the question arises that how deceased received second
fire arm injury on his knee? In this situation, it will be a case of
serious contradiction in medical and ocular account beside
improvements made by complaint during trial to bring his testimony
in line with medical evidence and when it is so, on this ground alone
his statement is liable to be rejected. On the effect of material
improvements by a witness the honorable Supreme Court of
Pakistan in “Sardar Bibi & another vs. Munir Ahmad & others
2017 SCMR 344” was pleased to hold as under: -

“As doctor, while conducting postmortem
examination, declared that the deceased
persons received bullet injuries hence for
the first time during trial, Falak Sher and
Sikandar were shown to be armed with 30
bore pistol and Munir being armed with
7mm rifle. This willful and dishonest
improvement was made by both the
witnesses in order to bring the prosecution
case in line with the medical evidence. In
the FIR the complainant alleged that fire
shot of Falak Sher hit Zafar Iqbal
deceased on his chest and the fire shot of
Sultan Ahmed accused also hit on the
chest of deceased Zafar Iqbal. According
to doctor, there was only one fire-arm
entry wound on the chest of the deceased
Zafar Iqbal. In order to meet this
situation, witnesses for the first time,
during trial made omission and did not
allege that the fire shot of Sultan hit at the
Criminal Appeal No.430 of 2020 7

chest of Zafar Iqbal, deceased. So the
improvements and omissions were made
by the witnesses in order to bring the case
of prosecution in line with the medical
evidence. Such dishonest and deliberate
improvement and omission made them
unreliable and they are not trustworthy
witnesses. ”

20. In “Syed Saeed Muhammad Shah & another vs. The State

1993 SCMR 550” it was ruled that: -

“Secondly, statements of the witnesses in
the Court in which improvements are
made to strengthen the case of the
prosecution are not worthy of reliance. It
is held in the case of Amir Zaman v.
Mehboob and others (1985 SCMR 685)
that testimony of witnesses containing
material improvements are not believable.
Reference can also be made to the cases of
Haji Bakhsh v. The State (PLD 1963 Kar.
805), Qaim Din and others v. The State
(1971 P Cr. LJ 229) and Fazla and
another v. The State (PLD 1960 Lah.
373)”

21. Same view finds support from “Muhammad _ Arif vs. The
State 2019 SCMR 631”.

22. It is this case Rooh-ul-Amin was assigned the same role of
fire on deceased that is also attributed to appellant that he too made
a fire on deceased. Appellant is therefore placed in similar position
where Rooh-ul-Ameen was. When to his extent both the eye-
witnesses have already been disbelieved, how they can be believed
qua appellant. Having the similar role, it cannot be said that Rooh-
ul-Amin was acquitted on the principle of ‘sifting the grain from
chef’ which too is no more applicable in Courts of Pakistan on the
strength of PLD 2019 SC 527 where it was declared that “Rule

I

falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus” shall henceforth be an integral
part of our jurisprudence in criminal cases. The concluding

paragraph of the precedent is as under: -
Criminal Appeal No.430 of 2020 8

“We may observe in the end that a judicial
system which permits deliberate falsehood
is doomed to fail and a society which
tolerates it is destined to self-destruct.
Truth is the foundation of justice and
justice is the core and bedrock of a
civilized society and, thus, any
compromise on truth amounts to a
compromise on a society's future as a just,
fair and civilized society. Our judicial
system has suffered a lot as a consequence
of the above mentioned permissible
deviation from the truth and it is about
time that such a colossal wrong may be
rectified in all earnestness. Therefore, in
light of the discussion made above, we
declare that the rule falsus in uno, falsus
in omnibus shall henceforth be an
integral _part_of our jurisprudence _in
criminal cases and the same shall be
given effect to, followed and applied by all
the courts in the country in its letter and
spirit. It is also directed that a witness
found by a court to have resorted to a
deliberate falsehood on a material aspect
shall, without any latitude, invariably be
proceeded against for committing
perjury.” (Emphasized)

23. The postmortem was conducted by Dr. Ghulab Shah (Pw-8),
which is not required to be referred as a whole except that he
observed fire arm injury No. | on the left nipple and fire arm injury
No. 3 on the left knee joint. According to him, dead body was
brought before him at 05:00 pm in the hospital and he conducted the
postmortem examination. I have examined the postmortem report
(PQ) where the time of postmortem examination is recorded as
10:00 pm. If the dead body was in hospital at 05:00 pm why the
postmortem was conducted after five hours? There is no explanation
in this regard by the prosecution. In “Khalid alias Khalidi & 2
others vs. The State 2012 SCMR 327” the apex Court was pleased
to observe that:

“The incident in the instant case took
place at 2-00 a.m., F.I.R was recorded at
4/5 am, Dr. Muhammad Pervaiz medically
Criminal Appeal No.430 of 2020 9

examined the injured persons at 4-00 a.m.
but conducted the post mortem
examination of the deceased at 3-00 p.m.
ie. after about ten hours which fact
clearly shows that the F.LR. was not
lodged at the given time”

24. In “Irshad Ahmed vs. the State 2011 SCMR 1190 on delayed

postmortem it was again observed that: -

“We have further observed that the post-
mortem examination of the dead body of
Shehzad Ahmed deceased had _ been
conducted with a noticeable delay and
such delay is generally suggestive of a
real possibility that time had _ been
consumed by the police in procuring and
planting eye witnesses and in cooking up a
story for the prosecution before preparing
police papers necessary for getting a
postmortem examination of the dead body
conducted ”
25. This is wrong to say that it is a case of prompt FIR and there
are multiple reasons for holding so. FIR shows that it was registered
at 05:30 pm with regard to the occurrence, which took place at
05:00 pm. Statement of Sajid Ullah Constable (Pw-9) is very
important. He is the one who had taken the dead body for
postmortem examination. According to him he received dead body
along with papers at 10:00 pm. If it was so then how Doctor Ghulab
Shah could claim that he received the dead body at 05:00 pm. The
complaint (PM) indicates that it was completed at 05:30 pm and
before its completion Mukhtar Hussain SI (Pw-14) had prepared all
the documents those include injuries statement and inquest report
which he handed over to Sajid Ullah Constable for postmortem
examination. So this Court finds no difficulty to hold that complaint
was recorded not at 05:30 pm but much later to that, say near to
10:00 pm.
26. Appellant was arrested on 07.10.2019. It was 10.10.2019
when at his instance from his house a pistol 30 bore was recovered

and taken into possession vide a recovery memo (PE). Prosecution

could not prove exclusive passion of appellant or his exclusive
Sharif

Criminal Appeal No.430 of 2020 10

knowledge with regard to place of recovery that was a house. Pistol
was lying in crockery box. It was not the case of prosecution even
by imagination that either the house or room or the crockery box
was under key and lock. Even otherwise when ocular account has
been disbelieved, the recovery and the expert report however strong
may be cannot be a base for recording conviction.

27. The prosecution cannot deviate from the duty to prove its case
beyond shadow of doubt. The evidence produced in this case is
infirm, self contradictory, shaky, untrustworthy and of no reliance at
all. In “Abdul Majeed vs. the State 2011 SCMR 941” it was ruled
as under: -

“The basic principle of criminal law is
that it is the burden of the prosecution to
prove its case against the accused beyond
reasonable doubt. This burden remains
throughout and does not shift to the
accused, who is only burdened to prove a
defence plea, ifhe takes one”

28. In “Nasrullah alias Nasro vs. The State 2017 SCMR 724 the
apex Court was again pleased to hold that: -

“It has already been clarified by this
Court in the case of Abdul Majeed v. The
State (2011 SCMR 941) that the
prosecution is bound to prove its case
against an accused person beyond
reasonable doubt at all stages of a
criminal case”

29. Resultantly, this Criminal Appeal is allowed. Impugned
judgment dated 19.09.2020 is set_ aside. Appellant is acquitted from
the charge. He is in custody. He shall be released forthwith if not

required in any other case.
