Appellant:- (Gul Majid) by Muhammad Ikram Khan,

Advocate.

Respondent:- (Akhtar Mohammad & the State) b
Mr. Rahim Shah, Astt: Advocate General.

MOHAMMAD IBRAHIM KHAN, J.- Initially the
law of the land was run into motion when Assistant
Sub Inspector of Police Station Barawal on getting clue
that a dead body is lying in Barawal hospital proceeded
to the said hospital along with police other ‘Najri’.
When the complainant Akhtar Muhammad in the
company of corpse of his deceased brother Shafiullah
reported him the matter that today on 23.5.2015 at
16:30 hours the goats of Gul Majid
(accused/Appellant) had entered in their maize crops
situated at the vicinity of Luey Khwar Dogal and were
damaging it. When his brother Shafiullah tried to

restrain these goats from damaging maize crops upon

which an altercation took place between Shafiullah and
Gul Majid. All of the sudden, out of both accused
Gul Majid and Ihsanullah, accused Gul Majid started
firing upon his brother. Due to which he was hit on his
back and buttock, who later on succumbed to the
injuries on the way to hospital. In addition to the
complainant the occurrence was stated to be witnessed
by his brothers Shakirullah, Akhtar Munir and Wazir.
The motive was stated to be a dispute over damaging
of maize crops by goats of the accused-party. On the
basis of such asservations the 'Murasila' was drafted
followed by lodging of the First Information Report
registered against the accused/Appellant Gul Majid and
absconding co-accused Ihsanullah.

2. The charge framed by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zila Qazi Dir Upper on
19.8.2015 would divulge that on 23.5.2015 at 16:30
hours at a place known as Luey Khwar Dogal Shahikot
falling within the criminal jurisdiction of PS Shahikot

the accused/Appellant Gul Majid along with other

Nawab (D.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan

their common intention duly armed committed
Qatl-e-Amad of Shafiullah, brother of the complainant
by firing at him. Due to which he was hit and got
seriously injured, thereby later on succumbed to the
injury on the way to hospital. Hence, committed an
offence within the meaning of section 302/34 PPC.

35 When the accused/Appellant did not plead
his guilt, he claimed trial. Thus, in order to prove the
asservations against the accused facing trial, the
prosecution examined Ihman-ud-Din DFC as SW,
Gul Fazil Khan SHO as PW-1, Suliman Constable as
PW-2, Shahab-ud-Din as PW-3, Wahidullah Armorer
as PW-4, Dr. Rahatullah as PW-5 who has conducted
postmortem of the dead body of the deceased
Shafiullah, Naseer Khan Constable as PW-6, Wali
Muhammad Khan Senior Civil Judge Dir Bala as

Imtiaz Ahmad ASI as PW-9 and Bacha Khan Retired

SI as PW-10.

4. After the closure of prosecution evidence,
accused/Appellant was examined under section 342 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, he negated his
involvement in the present episode of murder of
deceased Shafiullah and posed innocence.

5. At the end, in Sessions Case No. 91/2 of
the year 2015, the learned Additional Sessions Judge-
I/Izafi Zila Qazi Dir Upper came up with its judgment
dated 14.11.2017, whereby this accused-Appellant Gul
Majid enmeshed in case FIR No. 55 dated 23.5.2015
charged under sections 302,34 PPC registered at Police
Station Shahikot was convicted and sentenced in the

following manner:-

U/S 302 (b) PPC to life imprisonment
and fine of Rs. 50,000/- or in default
thereof shall further suffer
imprisonment of six months. The
accused/Appellant shall also liable to
pay compensation of Rs. 100,000/-
payable to the Legal Heirs of the
deceased or in default thereof shall

further undergo 6 months. However,

Nawab (D.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz
-5-

benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C was

extended to him.

6. Here is this Criminal Appeal bearing No.
286-M/2017 preferred by the convict-Appellant
Gul Majid within the meaning of section 410 Cr.P.C
read with Para 10 (8) of NAR 2009 looking forward for
acceptance of prayer under the grounds enumerated in
the appeal and for his liberty with the following
prayer:-

“In circumstances mentioned above, it is,
therefore, most graciously prayed that on
acceptance of this appeal, order/judgment
of the learned trial Court dated
14.11.2017 may kindly be set aside and
appellant may please be acquitted of the

charge leveled against him.”

Te Having heard arguments of learned
counsel for the accused/Appellant and learned Astt:
Advocate General appearing on behalf of the State,
record with their valuable assistance gone through.
While as per report of the DFC PS Shahikot dated
27.01.2018 the complainant Akhtar Muhammad being

involved in case FIR No. 3 dated 26.01.2015 charged

Nawab (D.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz

under section 14 Foreign Act (F.A) had been deported
to the neighboring country Afghanistan being an
Afghan National in the light of order rendered by the
learned Senior Civil Judge Dir Bala.

8. It is an admitted fact surfacing on the
record that the so called eyewitnesses including the
complainant being Afghan Nationals have been
deported/migrated to Afghanistan, therefore, they were
abandoned by the prosecution, so, there is no ocular
version in field in respect of guilt of the
accused/Appellant Gul Majid. In such circumstances,
the only incriminating evidence in the account of
accused/Appellant is his retracted judicial confession
which was solely relied upon by the learned trial Court
while awarding major punishment of life imprisonment
to the accused/Appellant. In context of the present case,
the accused/Appellant was arrested on 24.5.2015
whereas his confessional statement was recorded on
27.5.2015 i.e. after 2 days of his arrest, meaning

thereby, that the accused/Appellant remained in police

Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz
oo

we

Tx

custody for 2 days, so, the possibility of obtaining of
confession through means of coercion, inducement or
torture cannot be ruled out.

In such like situation, it has been
observed in many Judicial Pronouncements of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan like 2017 SCMR

898 “Muhammad Ismail and others vs the State”,

wherein the relevant citation (b) speaks of:-

Reappraisal of evidence. Judicial
confession before Magistrate, retraction
of---Effect. Judicial confession allegedly
made by accused-persons/appellants
before a Magistrate under S. 164, Cr.P.C
had been retracted before the Trial Court
and in the absence of any independent
corroboration such retracted judicial
confession could not suffice all by itself
for recording or upholding the accused
persons' conviction. Convictions and
death sentences awarded to accused
persons were set aside in circumstances
and they were acquitted of the charge of

murder. Appeal was allowed accordingly.

Even otherwise, there is no cavil with this
legal proposition that while evaluating confessional
statement the main object of law is to ensure its

voluntariness and truthfulness. It would be a right place

Nawab (D.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz
-8-

to mention here that a greater duty/responsibility has

been casted upon the Magistrate recording confession

to be satisfied that such a confession is voluntarily

made and to that end he must make an inquiry before

recording the confession.

No doubt, conviction can be based on the

retracted confession alone but it is found voluntary,

true and confidence inspiring. It has been held by the

Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in case law

cited as “Bahadur Khan vs. The State” (PLD 1995 S

C 336) as under:-

por

esteem verdict of the Hon'ble Supreme Court

“Retracted confession has to be
accepted only if it is corroborated by
clear, cogent and _ independent
evidence. Court is called upon to act
upon a retracted confession to enquire
into all the material points and
surrounding circumstances and satisfy
itself fully that the confession cannot

but be true”.

In view of the wisdom contained in the

of

Pakistan reported as 2005 SCMR 515 “Asif Mahmood

vs the State”, wherein it has been opined:-

evidentiary value and it cannot be made sole reason for
conviction. Reliance has been placed on 2017 P Cr.L J

479 “Noor Muhammad & others vs the State &

In such scenario, when the
accused/Appellant admittedly remained in police
custody for 2 days, so, the confession might have been
procured from him by the police through coercion,
inducement or torture. Moreover, from bare perusal of
the questionnaire it transpires that the
accused/Appellant was given 30 minutes time to
inculcate over the matter before recording of
confession from 9:00 A.M to 9:30 A.M while later on
in the certificate it has been mentioned by the learned
Senior Civil Judge Dir Bala (PW-7) that upon sweet
will of the accused his confession was recorded on
9:25 A.M, meaning thereby, that even the mandatory
period of 30 minutes have not been given as whole to
the accused before recording of confession. Besides
during cross-examination PW-7 Wali Muhammad
Khan Senior Civil Judge Dir Bala admitted that at the
time of recording of confessional statement no
relatives of the accused were present with him and in

respect of question No. 11 which is with regard to

Nawab (D.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz
-ll-

consultation about recording of confession the accused
did not give any answer. He further admitted that in
questionnaire there is no mentioning of the accused
being consulted by his counsel. In order to inculcate
the true situation which arose at the relevant time of
recording of confession question No. 11 and its answer

asked from the accused are reproduced as under:-

web re Pl sJir-11

Just from bare answer of this question No.
11 it is abundantly clear that no relatives of the
accused were present with him, therefore, he deposed
in a very lucid words “that none is there to help him
and he is all alone”. Hence, such confession deserves
little consideration and is discarded accordingly.
9. Moreso, conviction of an accused cannot be

based solely on confessional statement, unless the

prosecution is able to substantiate its charge against

2. the accused through trustworthy and confidence

inspiring testimony of the witnesses, which standard

of evidence could not be seen here in this case. As the

Nawab (D.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz
= 12%

best piece of ocular evidence available with the
prosecution has been abandoned for variety of reasons,
therefore, in a sense, it is an unseen and un-witnessed

crime. Reliance can be placed on 2017 YLR 436

“Talib Hussain & another vs the State & another”:

(b) Criminal trial---

--—-Ocular testimony, disbelieved---Effect---
When ocular testimony was disbelieved
then recovery as well as medical evidence

were of no help to prosecution.
(c) Criminal trial--

---Onus of establishing case---Prosecution
had to establish its own case independently
instead of depending upon weaknesses of

defence.
(e) Penal Code (XLV of 1860)---

----S.302---Criminal Procedure Code (V of
1898), S§.342---Qatl-i-amd---Admission of
guilt by accused--Prosecution failing to
prove case---Effect---Where prosecution
had failed to prove its case against accused
beyond reasonable doubt, accused might be
acquitted even if he had taken plea and
admitted killing the deceased.

10. Whereas the factum of benefit of doubt is
very much lucid in its entirety that if there exist a

reasonable ground to believe that the

Nawab (D.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz
-13-

accused/Appellant has not participated in the
commission of alleged crime in the mode and manner
as advanced by the prosecution then there is no need of
numbers of circumstances to prove the innocence of
accused even a single circumstance creating reasonable
doubt is sufficient for the acquittal of the accused. In
this regard guidance is derived from the judgment cited
as 2015 P_Cr.LJ 554 (Peshawar) “ Sahibzada vs the
State and 2 others”.

11. In the above prevailing situation, we after
reappraisal of entire evidence are of the firm view that
the prosecution case against the accused/ Appellant has
not been proved beyond reasonable doubt and the
judgment of learned trial Court is based on wrong
appreciation of evidence and the law on the subject.
Hence, we accept this appeal and set-aside the
impugned judgment of conviction rendered by the
learned Trial Court. Ergo, the accused/Appellant is

acquitted of the charges leveled against him. He is

Nawab (D.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan

in custody and be set free if not required in any
other case.
12. These are the reasons of our short order

announced in open Court on even date.
