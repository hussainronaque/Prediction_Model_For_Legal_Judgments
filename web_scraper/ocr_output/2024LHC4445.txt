Section: 29 of Pakistan Penal Code defines “document” and same is hereby
produced:-

"Document". The word "document" denotes any matter expressed or
described upon any substance by means of letters, figures or marks, or by more
than one of those means, intended to be used, or which may be used, as evidence
of that matter.

Explanation 1. It is immaterial by what means or upon what substance
the letters, figures or marks are formed, or whether the evidence is intended for,
or may be used in, a Court of Justice, or not.
Crl. Appeal No. 51928/2024 -3:-

Illustrations

Awriting expressing the terms of a contract, which may be used as evidence of
the contract, is a document.

Acheque upon a banker is a document.

A Power-of-Attorney is a document.

Amap or plan which is intended to be used or which may be used as evidence,
is a document.

Awriting containing direction or instruction is a document.

Explanation 2. Whatever is expressed by means of letters, figures or marks as
explained by mercantile or other usage, shall be deemed to be expressed by such
letters, figures or marks within the meaning of this section, although the same may not
be actually expressed.

Illustration

A writes his name on back of a bill of exchange payable to his order. The
meaning of the endorsement, as explain mercantile usage, is that the bill is to be paid
to the holder. The endorsement is a document, and must be construed in the same
manner as if the words "pay to the holder” or words to that effect had been written
over the signature. ”

Similarly, Article: 2(1)(b) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 also defines

“document”, which is hereby reproduced:-

"Document" means any matter expressed or described upon any
substance by means of letters, figures or marks, or by more than one of
those means, intended to be used, or which may be used, for the
purpose of recording that matter; ”

Section: 3 (16) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 has also defined the “document”,

which is reproduced:-

"Document". “document" shall include any matter written, expressed
or described upon any substance by means of letters, figures or marks,
or by more than one of those means which is intended to be used, or
which may be used, for the purpose of recording that matter:”

Perusal of Section: 29 of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, Article 2(1)(b) of
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 and Section: 3 (16) of the General Clauses Act,
1897 reveals that U.S.B. can be safely termed as “document”.

Evidence has been defined by Article: 2(1)(c) of Qanun-e-Shahadat
Order, 1984, which is hereby reproduced:-

“evidence" includes--

(i) all statements which the Court permits or requires to be
made before it by witnesses, in relation to matters of fact
under inquiry; such statements are called oral evidence;
and

(ii) all documents produced for the inspection of the Court:
such documents are called documentary evidence; ”

Article 164 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 allows production of

the evidence which has become available through modern devices or techniques.
Crl. Appeal No. 51928/2024 ~4:

So, U.S.B is a document which can be produced for inspection of the court and is
documentary evidence as defined under Article: 2 (1)(c) of Qanun-e-Shahadat
Order, 1984.

After registration of the case, investigation is carried out and at
conclusion of the same, report under Section: 173 Cr.P.C. (also called as challan
report) is submitted in the court, it contains gist of case of prosecution after
investigation; evidence collected during investigation including statements of
witnesses as well as documents are also sent with challan report to the court.

Copy of challan report under Section: 173 Cr.P.C. along with
statements of witnesses and documents is to be provided to the accused for
enabling him to have an all round picture of the case against him for answering the
charge, preparing his defence as well as cross-examining the witnesses; intention
of legislature behind providing of aforementioned documents to accused is to
afford him the opportunity to defend himself and it has become much broadened
through Article: 10-A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.
Providing of copies of the documents/record in the criminal case to be tried by
Sessions Court is not only governed by Section: 265-C Cr.P.C. rather Section: 548
of Cr.P.C. and Article 87 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 are also relevant,
which all are hereby reproduced as under:-

Section: 265-C Cr.P.C.

“265-C. Supply of statements and documents to the accused.--
(1) In all cases instituted upon police report, copies of the following
documents shall be supplied free of cost to the accused not later than
seven days before the commencement of the trial, namely: --
(a) the first information report;
(b) __ the police report;
(c) the statements of all witnesses recorded under Sections 161 and
164; and
d) the inspection note recorded by an Investigating Officer on his
first visit to the place of occurrence and the note recorded by him
on recoveries made, if any:
Provided that, if any part of a statement recorded under
Section 161 or Section 164 is such that its disclosure to the
accused would be inexpedient in the public interest, such part of
the statement shall be excluded from the copy of the statement
furnished to the accused.
(2) Inall cases instituted upon a complaint in writing.--
a) the complainant shall:--
(i) state in the petition of complaint the substance of the
accusation, the names of his witnesses and the gist of
evidence which he is likely to adduce at the trial; and
Crl. Appeal No. 51928/2024 aSi-

(ii) within three days of the orders of the Court under Section
204 for issue of process to the accused, file in the Court
for supply to the accused, as many copies of the complaint
and any other document which he has filed with his
complaint as the number of the accused; and

(b) copies of the complaint and any other documents which the
complainant has filed therewith and the statements under Section 200 or
Section 202 shall be supplied free of cost to the accused not later than
seven days before the commencement of the trial.”

Section: 548 of Cr.P.C.

“548. Copies of proceeding.-- If any person affected by a Judgment
or order passed by a Criminal Court desires to have a copy of "[....] any order
or deposition or other part of the record he shall, on applying for such copy,
be furnished therewith:

Provided that he pays for the same, unless the Court, for some special
reason, thinks fit to furnish it free of cost.”

Article 87 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984

“87. Certified copies of public documents. (1) Every public officer having the
custody of a public document, which any person has a right to inspect, shall
give that person on demand a copy of it on payment of the legal fees therefore,
together with a certificate written at the foot of such copy that it is a true copy
of such document or part thereof, as the case may be, and such certificate shall
be dated and subscribed by such officer with his name and his official title, and
shall be sealed. whenever such officer is authorized by law to make use of a
seal, and such copies so certified shall be called certified copies.”

Perusal of Section: 265-C Cr.P.C. reveals that copies of first information report,
police report, statements of witnesses recorded under Section: 161 Cr.P.C. and
Section: 164 Cr.P.C., inspection note recorded by Investigating Officer on his first
visit to the place of occurrence and also the note recorded by him on recovery
made will be provided to the accused. It appears that object of Section: 265-C
Cr.P.C. is to fill/meet the vacuum created by the abolition of commitment
proceedings and to make all prosecution evidence available to the accused.
Section: 265-C Cr.P.C. is mandatory and inclusive as well as beneficial provision
for accused but not the conclusive because it is not mentioned therein that except
documents mentioned in said section, any other document which is also of more or
less of same kind/category/nature cannot be supplied/given to the accused, hence it
will not be narrowly interpreted rather when question of providing copy of
evidence including document to the accused facing trial will arise then liberal,
broad, wide and spacious interpretation will be made of Section: 265-C Cr.P.C. in
order to enable the accused for having full/complete knowledge of the evidence

which the prosecution possesses for the unfolding of its case before the court and
Crl. Appeal No. 51928/2024 -:6:-

even the copy of the evidence which has become available through modern
devices or techniques; furthermore, under Section: 265-C (1)(b), copy of the police
report is also supplied to the accused and while adopting liberal, wide and
beneficial interpretation of Section: 265-C (1)(b) Cr.P.C., particularly in the light
of spirit of Article: 10-A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973,
police report would also include documents mentioned in it as well as annexed
with the same. Because if case of prosecution mentioned in police report contains
some important fact around which entire charge would revolve, and detail of said
fact is mentioned in the document collected during investigation and the document
is appended with the police report but its (document’s) copy is not provided to the
accused then how he would come to know about exact picture of allegation ie.
case of prosecution against him, how he would prepare his defence for replying the
charge and negating the same through cross-examination during trial of the case
which would ultimately negate the constitutionally guaranteed right of provision of
fair trial to the accused. Under Section: 265-C (1)(d), the inspection note recorded
by an Investigating Officer on his first visit to the place of occurrence and the note
recorded by him on recoveries made shall also be supplied to the accused.
Meaning thereby that detail of occurrence at the time and place of occurrence will
be noted by the Investigating Officer during first visit at the place of occurrence
and copy of said notes will also be supplied to the accused in order to enable him
to know about the detail of occurrence alleged against him through police report,
for facing the trial. The U.S.B. in this case is statedly containing the video
recording of raid i.e. detail of occurrence as well as place of occurrence, therefore,
practically speaking, video recording of the occurrence as well as place of
occurrence is containing detail of the occurrence as well as spot of occurrence with
more exactness and accuracy as compared to inspection notes prepared by
Investigating Officer. Hence, liberal/wide and purposeful interpretation of Section:
265-C(1)(d) Cr.P.C. will include supply of copy of U.S.B. containing video
recording of the occurrence as well as place of occurrence also with the copy of
inspection notes as “a document qua occurrence and place of occurrence” in more
accurate form/shape of inspection notes of the place of occurrence.

It is relevant to mention here that in the case of “ZAHID

SARFARAZ GILL versus The STATE” (2024 SCMR 934), Supreme Court of
Crl. Appeal No. 51928/2024 aT

Pakistan, observed regarding use of mobile phone by the police and A.N F. for
recording and/or taking photographs of the search, seizure and arrest of accused in
narcotic cases as well as regarding Article: 164 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984,
which permits the use of any evidence that may have become available because of
modern devices or techniques and overriding effect of Article: 165 of Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984; relevant portions from said case law are hereby reproduced
as under:-

“However, we fail to understand why the police and members of the Anti-
Narcotics Force (‘ANF') do not record or photograph when search,
seizure and/or arrest is made. Article 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984
specifically permits the use of any evidence that may have become
available because of modern devices or techniques, and its Article 165
overrides all other laws.”

“In narcotic cases the prosecution witnesses usually are ANF personnel
or policemen who surely would have a cell phone with an in-built
camera.”

“Tf the police and ANF were to use their mobile phone cameras to record
and/or take photographs of the search, seizure and arrest, it would be
useful evidence to establish the presence of the accused at the crime
scene, the possession by the accused of the narcotic substances, the
search and its seizure. It may also prevent false allegations being levelled
against ANF/police that the narcotic substance was foisted upon them for
some ulterior motives.”

“The Prosecution services, paid out of the public exchequer, is also not
advising the ANF/police to be do this simple act of making a recording
and/or taking photographs as stated above.”

Besides, accused affected by the order of trial court qua taking
cognizance of the case in hand, can apply under Section: 548 Cr.P.C. (which is
mandatory provision) for furnishing copy of any part of the record of the case and
same will be furnished to him. Any person who has right to inspect the public
document can have copy of the same under Article: 87 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984. Accused has every right to inspect the police report and documents annexed.
with the same except police diaries prepared under Section: 172 Cr.P.C., therefore,
accused can obtain copy of the document mentioned in and appended with the
police report except police diary. Learned Deputy Prosecutor General clearly stated
that video of the occurrence has been preserved in U.S.B., which has been secured
during investigation vide recovery memo and it will be produced during trial for
proving the charge against the accused, therefore, in order to enable the accused to
exactly know the contents of said U.S.B. and prepare his defence for rebutting the

charge through cross-examination, supply of copy of U.S.B. to accused is
Crl. Appeal No. 51928/2024 -:8:-

necessary. However, trial court could not appreciate this legal aspect while passing
the impugned order, therefore, same is not sustainable in the eyes of law.
Resultantly, this appeal is allowed, impugned order is set-aside, application filed by
appellant for supply of copy of the U.S.B. is accepted and trial court is directed to
provide copy of the U.S.B. to the appellant.

Before parting with the judgment, it goes without saying that case in
which U.S.B. qua video recording of the raid conducted at the time of occurrence
will be submitted with police report by the prosecution in the court, copies of the
U.S.B. according to number of accused to face trial will also be submitted in the
court for providing to the accused. Learned Deputy Prosecutor General will
intimate in this regard to learned Prosecutor General, Punjab, who will ensure the
compliance through Inspector General of Police, Punjab and Director General,

Anti-Narcotics Force (A.N.F.), Lahore.
