“Faisal Qazafi Vs. Chairman, NAB etc”
JUDGMENT
Date of hearing 10.05.2018.

Petitioner(s) by:

Respondent(s) by:

IKRAMULLAH KHAN, J.- Through the instant

criminal appeal, filed under Section 13(c) of
the NAB Ordinance, 1999, the appellant
namely Faisal Qazafi has challenged the
validity and legality of impugned Judgment
dated 28.03.2016, rendered by the learned
Judge, Accountability Court-lll, Peshawar
whereby the Objection Petition, filed by the
appellant was dismissed.

02. In essence, during course of
investigation by the NAB authorities against
the accused Abdul Waheed Qureshi, his
property was freezed in view of Section 12(a)
of the NAB Ordinance. The same freezing
order was confirmed by the learned Judge,

Accountability Court, Peshawar on 28.07.2015.

03. The present appellant filed
Objection Petition against the order of the
learned Accountability Court, Peshawar dated
28.07.2015 under Section 13 of the NAB
Ordinance. However, after filing Objection
Petition, the appellant was also arrayed an
accused by filing supplementary reference
against the appellant but the appellant did
not appear before the Accountability Court,
even remained absent during course of
investigation before the NAB authorities. The
appellant was proceeded under Section 512
Cr.PC. and the Prosecution was allowed to
lead his evidence in absence of the appellant.
04. The appellant instead of filing the
Objection Petition through himself, in order to
appear at-least before the Court, being
declared as an accused by the NAB
authorities, he had filed Objection Petition
through attorney Bilal Mustafa and as such on
the sole ground his Objection Petition was
turned down by the learned Accountability
Court-lll, Peshawar, hence, the instant appeal.
05. The instant appeal has also been

filed by the appellant through Bilal Mustafa,
3

special attorney of the appellant, copy of
Power of Attorney is annexed herewith. The
memorandum has been vested with the power
by the appellant Faisal Qazafi, just to look-
after the property situated in Gulbahar,
Peshawar but no power has been conferred
upon the said attorney by the
appellant/accused, either to file Objection
Petition under Sectionl3 of the NAB
Ordinance or an appeal against the order of
the learned Accountability Court before this
Court.

06. Legal proposition is that whether
in criminal proceeding, an accused could be
represented by an attorney in order to
perform same acts on his behalf, has not
provided under the NAB Ordinance. The
Objection Petition under Section 13 could
only be filed by any person who feel himself
aggrieved by any order, passed under Section
12 of the NAB Ordinance while in view of
clause (c) of Section 13, the accused or any
other aggrieved party who claims or objection
against property has been dismissed by the

Court may within 10 days file an appeal
4
against the order of the Court before High
Court but in case in hand, the instant appeal
has been filed by an un-authorized person,
although holding special power of attorney in
respect of looking after the property of the
appellant. The person, who had filed instant
appeal on behalf of the appellant/accused
seem to be not maintainable, however, justice
demand that the Objection Petition be
decided on merit, therefore, the impugned
judgment is set aside and the appellant is
afforded last but absolute opportunity to
appear before the learned Accountability
Court in person, in order to place its insofar as
his objection over the confirmation freezing
order of the learned Accountability Court is
concerned and the learned Accountability
Court after affording an opportunity of
hearing to the appellant through his duly
nominated counsel, if he appears personally
may re-decide the objection petition of the
appellant in accordance with law keeping in
view the provisions of Section 13 of the NAB

Ordinance, 1999. With the above
observations, the case is remanded to the

learned Accountability Court concerned.

Announced.
