Respondent...

QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:-_ All the four
accused/petitioners, Farhat Naseem,
Muhammad Ibrahim, Hakim Khan and
Muhammad Sajid Khan, are seeking post
arrest bail in case vide FIR No.250 dated
25.04.2015 under Sections 302/148/149
PPC and 15 AA KPK, Police Station Sarai
Saleh, Haripur, which was lodged on the
report of Mughal Khan,
complainant/respondent No.2, who
reported to the SHO P.S Sarai Saleh on the

spot at 2230 hours on 25.04.2015 about
the Qatl-i-Amd of his nephew namely Adil
Khan by the accused/petitioners and other
two  absconding co-accused namely
Waseem and Mansoor by effectively firing
at the deceased with their fire arms at
9.15 P.M. The complainant showed his
presence on the spot while driving his
Double Cabin vehicle and his close relative
and eye witness Khurram Khan
accompanying him in the vehicle, while
deceased Adil Khan following him in his
own motorcar. According to the
complainant, he recognized the
accused/petitioners and the absconding
co-accused in the light of electric bulb and
also moon light, and cited old blood feud
as motive for the offence.

2. The Postmortem examination
of the deceased revealed three fire arm
entry wounds of 2 % and 2 cm with
corresponding exit wounds on the head

and chest of the deceased. During
investigation, the I.O inspected the spot,
and collected blood from the front seat of
vehicle of the deceased through cotton and
also recovered large number of crime
empties of both 12 bore SG and 7.62 MM
bore from the spot. The blood stained
cotton along with blood stained garments
of the deceased were sent to FSL, and the
chemical examiner reported that human
blood was detected on the said articles. A
total of 24 crime empties of 7.62 MM bore
along with one 7.62 MM bore SMG rifle,
allegedly, handed over to the I.O by the
accused/petitioner Muhammad = Ibrahim,
after his arrest, on 23.05.2015, were sent
to the fire arms expert, but the result
received there-from was in the negative.
Accused/petitioners Sajid, Farhat Naseem
and Muhammad Ibrahim were arrested on
04.05.2015, whereas accused/petitioner
Haji Hakim Khan was_ arrested’ on

22.05.2015. The I.O had also secured two
electric bulbs from the spot, but the load-
shedding schedule procured from the
Wapda Authorities showed load-shedding
of Industrial feeder from 2100 to 2200
hours in the report dated 14.05.2015.
Moreover, on the application of
accused/petitioner Sajid Khan the I.O also
obtained record showing tour programme
of department of Mathematics of Hazara
University, Havelian Campus, on the day
of occurrence; and affidavits of staff of the
department showing presence of the
accused/petitioner with them from 8.00
AM to 1015 P.M. After completion of
investigation, complete challan against the
accused/petitioners and challan under
Section 512 Cr.PC against the two
absconding co-accused has been
submitted on 05.07.2015.

3. Arguments of the _ learned
counsel for the  accused/petitioners,

learned Assistant Advocate General
assisted by learned counsel for the
complainant/respondent No.2 heard, and
record perused.

4. The learned counsel for the
accused/petitioners argued that six
persons of a family have been charged for
3 fire arms injuries on the deceased,
allegedly, caused at night time but the
accused, nevertheless, recognized by the
complainant and the so-called eye witness
namely Khurram Khan, a close relative of
the complainant and the deceased, in the
moon light and light of the electric bulb,
which, according to the learned counsel,
was a distant possibility as neither there
was full moon on the day of occurrence
nor the place where the electric bulb was
on at the time of occurrence has been
shown in the site plan, thus raising serious
doubts about identification of the accused
by the complainant and the so-called eye

witness, who were reportedly proceeding
ahead of the deceased in the vehicle. The
learned counsel contended that in such
darkness it was next to impossible for the
complainant to specify those parts of the
body of the deceased where he sustained
fire arms injuries. The learned counsel
further pointed out that statement under
section 161 Cr.PC of Khurram Khan was
recorded by the I.O twice on the same day
i.e. 26.04.2015; but in his first recorded
statement the said Khurram Khan said
nothing about his witnessing the
occurrence. The learned counsel further
pointed out that not only
accused/petitioner Sajid has _ furnished
proof regarding his plea of A/ibi but the
negative report of the fire arms expert
about the crime empties and the alleged
weapon of offence recovered’ from
accused/petitioner Muhammad = Ibrahim,
would also. make case of _ the

accused/petitioner that of further inquiry.
5. The learned Assistant AG
assisted by learned counsel for the
complainant/respondent No.2, on_ the
other hand, contended that the
accused/petitioners along with absconding
co-accused were charged by name for the
Qatl-i-Amd of deceased Adil Khan and
being co-villager of the complainant and
the eye witness, there could possibly be no
doubt about their identification in the
moon light and also in the light of
electricity bulbs which were taken into
possession by the I.0. The learned counsel
further contended that three fire arm entry
wounds on the body of the deceased
suggested commission of the offence by
more than one person, which receives
support from the strong motive of previous
enmity between the parties. The learned
counsel maintained that plea of a/ibi could

not be taken into consideration at the bail
stage, neither in depth discussion of merits
of the case was desirable at this stage.

6. Be that as it may, the fact
remains that six members of a family are
charged for only three fire arm entry
wounds on the deceased at night time,
without assigning specific role in the FIR to
any of the accused. No doubt, the load
shedding schedule and plea of alibi by
accused/petitioner Sajid are facts which
are not that relevant at the bail stage; but
once such grounds are taken by the
defence, the I.O must probe in to such
facts alleged during the _ investigation
either to confirm or contradict the same.
However, in the instant case, the I.O does
not seem to have embarked on such an
exercise, which was, indeed, essentially
required for completion of investigation;
thus leaving room for further inquiry. The
negative report of the fire arms expert,

non recovery of anything incriminatring
from the other co-accused and _ no
investigation to prove moon light on the
day of occurrence and light of electric bulb
(s) on the spot at the time of occurrence,
would further render case against the
accused/petitioners that of further inquiry.
7. Above all, the
accused/petitioners are behind the bars
since 04.05.2015 and 22.05.2015,
respectively, while investigation in the
case is complete as complete challan
against them has been submitted on
05.07.2015, implying thereby that they
are no longer required for the purpose of
investigation, thus making the
accused/petitioners — entitled to the
concession of bail, especially when bail
cannot be withheld as punishment.

8. Consequently, on the
acceptance of the application, the
accused/petitioners are admitted to bail

provided they furnish bail bonds in the
sum of Rs.100000/- each with two sureties
each in the like amount to the satisfaction

of Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate, Haripur.
