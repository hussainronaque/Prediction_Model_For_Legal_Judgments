Murder Reference No.35 of 2022
Criminal Appeal No.435 of 2022

Reference for confirmation of their death sentences or otherwise,
which are being decided through this single judgment.

3. Heard. Record perused.

4. Miran Baksh was done to death in the street on 15.08.2020
at 10:50 a.m., whereafter FIR was lodged on the same day i.e.
15.08.2020 at 12:40 p.m. on the statement of his maternal
nephew Muhammad Latif complainant?W-8 who while claiming
himself to be the eye-witness of the occurrence stated that on
15.08.2020 at 10:50 a.m., he was standing outside the clinic of
his son Muzammal Hussain (not pw) in his absence, Adeel Abbas
(Adeel Atif) and Nasir Abbas co-accused (since acquitted) were standing
in the street in front of house of Ch. Fida Hussain (not Pw),
appellants (Ghaffar Abbas alias Ghaffar Ahmed and Muhammad Suleman alias Mani)
were standing in front of the house of Ch. Doraiz (not pw),
meanwhile, Miran Baksh deceased was coming to his house from
the side of “Adda” when he (Miran Baksh deceased) after crossing Adeel
Abbas (Adeel Atif) and Nasir Abbas co-accused (since acquitted) reached
few paces from them, they [Adeel Abbas (Adeel Atif) and Nasir Abbas co-accused|
took out their pistols while raising “lalkara” that Miran Baksh
deceased should not be spared today, meanwhile, Ghaffar Abbas
alias Ghaffar Ahmed appellant made fire shot with his pistol
hitting on abdomen of Miran Baksh deceased who fell down,
second fire shot made by him (Ghaffar Abbas alias Ghaffar Ahmed, appellant)
hit on left side of neck of Miran Baksh deceased. Muhammad
Suleman alias Mani (appellant) also made fire shots hitting on left
arm, left leg and other parts of body of Miran Baksh deceased
who succumbed to the injuries at the spot.

5. The Inquest Report is prepared in duplicate by the carbon
copying agency under the provisions of Chapter 25, Rule 35 of
The Police Rules, 1934 when preliminary investigation has been
completed by the police officer after reaching the dead body and

is sent alongwith other requisite papers to the medical officer
Murder Reference No.35 of 2022
Criminal Appeal No.435 of 2022

with dead body for post-mortem examination which is endorsed
by the medical officer. The Inquest Report carries immense
significance which is considered an integral part of
method/system in every murder case to keep an eye on the
subsequent possible fabrication in record, it gives some reflection
of the witnesses in attendance, the weapon used in commission
of crime, the detail of injuries on the body of the deceased,
presence of crime empties etc. at the crime scene, if the dead
body is lying at the spot, the nature of weapon and summary of
the facts. Such information can easily be gathered from perusal
of its relevant columns. In present case, inquest report was
prepared by the investigating officer after reaching at the place of
occurrence where dead body was lying but till that time FIR was
not registered. According to inquest report, Muhammad Hafeez
son of Muhammad Hanif and Zamir Hussain son of Munir
Hussain (have not been produced before the trial Court) present there had
identified the dead body of Miran Baksh deceased who were sent
with the dead body for post-mortem examination under the

escort of Wasim Nazar HC. In the relevant column of inquest

Py

report “#2” it is simply mentioned as under:-

Names of Muhammad Latif complainantP™8 and his cousin
Muhammad ShanPW.9 who claim themselves to be the eye-
witnesses of the occurrence are not mentioned in it. Names of the
appellants are also not mentioned, rather nothing is mentioned in

column “Brief Summary of Facts” regarding facts of the case. No
Murder Reference No.35 of 2022
Criminal Appeal No.435 of 2022

reason for such lapses is available, so an inference can be drawn
that till then, names of the complainant, eye-witnesses and
accused were unknown and it was an unseen occurrence. In
these circumstances, possibility cannot be ruled out that FIR was
lodged after due consultation and deliberation by cooking up a
story, preparing eye-witnesses for involving the appellants. (2020
SCMR 505)“Mst. Yasmeen Vs. Javed and another”.

6. Rough and scaled site plans of place of occurrence do not
show the houses of these eye-witnesses (Muhammad Latif complainant?”*
and Muhammad Shan’”*) around the place of occurrence. They being
chance witnesses have failed to establish their presence at the
time and place of occurrence with their stated reasons. (2014
SCMR 1698) “Muhammad Rafique v. The State”? and (2017
SCMR 564)“Arshad Khan v. The State”.

7. Motive of the occurrence is previous enmity of murder
which cuts both the ways. (2017 SCMR 1672) “Tariq Vs. The
State”, (2011 SCMR 646) “Tahir Khan Vs. The State” and (2009
SCMR 916) “Ghulam Mustafa Vs. The State”.

8. Recovery of pistols on pointing out of the appellants in
presence of negative report is not only inconsequential rather
draws adverse inference.

9. In view of the above discussion, we entertain serious doubt
in our minds regarding participation of Ghaffar Abbas alias
Ghaffar Ahmed and Muhammad Suleman alias Mani (appellants) in
the present case. It is settled principle of law that for giving
benefit of doubt, it is not necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating doubt. If there is a circumstance which
creates reasonable doubt in the prudent mind about the guilt of
the accused, then they would be entitled to its benefit not as a
matter of grace or concession, but as of right.

10. For the foregoing reasons, this appeal is allowed,

convictions and sentences of Ghaffar Abbas alias Ghaffar Ahmed
Murder Reference No.35 of 2022
Criminal Appeal No.435 of 2022

and Muhammad Suleman alias Mani (appellants) awarded by the
trial Court through the impugned judgment are hereby set-aside.
They are acquitted of the charge and directed to be released
forthwith, if not required in any other case. Murder Reference is

answered in the NEGATIVE and death sentences of Ghaffar

Abbas alias Ghaffar Ahmed and Muhammad Suleman alias Mani

(appellants) are NOT CONFIRMED.
