(JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT)
Cr.A.No.1164 -P/2022

Saddam Vs. The State etc

JUDGMENT

Date of hearing ------ 18.04.2024.

Appellant by: Mr. Hussain Ali, Advocate
State by: Mr. Ayub Zaman, AAG

Complainant by: Mr. Batol Rafaqat, Advocate

SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J-. Through this

criminal appeal, appellant has questioned the
legality and validity of the judgment dated
03.11.2022, passed by learned Additional
Sessions Judge-X!, Peshawar, delivered in
case FIR No. 155, dated 24.02.2020, under
sections 302 / 324 /34/ 109 PPC, registered
at Police Station East Cantt:, Peshawar,
whereby the appellant has been convicted
and sentenced in the following manner:-

i. “U/s 302(b) PPC, the appellant
has been convicted and sentenced
to imprisonment for life as Tazir and
also to pay compensation amount of
Rs. 5,00,000/- in terms of Section
544-A Cr.PC. In case of default of
payment of compensation, the
convict-appellant shall be liable to
further undergo simple
imprisonment for one year.

ii. Benefit of Section 382-B
Cr.P.C has been extended to the
appellant.”

2. Facts, in brief, as per contents of the FIR
(Ex.PA) are that on 24.02.2020 at 11:30 hours
complainant Abid Ullah while present with the
dead body of his brother at trauma room of
Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar, reported the
matter to the police that on the day of incident
he alongwith his deceased brother Ibrar Ullah
Khan and Muhammad Raza Khan had gone to
the Courts for attending the Court proceedings
and on return when they reached to the place
of incident, all of a sudden accused Saddam,
duly armed with firearms came and opened
firing at them with murderous intention, as a
result whereof his brother Ibrar Khan got
injured critically, while they luckily escaped
unhurt. His injured brother was shifted to LRH,
Peshawar through Rescue 1122, but there he
succumbed to the injuries. Motive behind the
occurrence was previous blood feud between
the parties. The accused Saddam Ali has
committed the offence at the instigation of his
relatives Nasir Ali Khan and Zahid Ali. He
charged the accused for commission of the

offence, hence, the FIR ibid.

3. On arrest of the accused and on
conclusion of the investigation, challan was
submitted before the Court against accused
Saddam and co-accused Nasir Ali, Zahid Ali
and Amjad Ali. The appellant alongwith co-
accused was summoned and provided copies
of the relevant documents under section 265-C
Cr.PC, and thereafter, charge was framed
against them, to which they pleaded not guilty
and claimed trial. In order to prove its claim the
prosecution produced and examined as many
as 10 witnesses. Thereafter, statements of
accused-appellant and that of the co-accused
were recorded under section 342 Cr.PC
wherein, they professed innocence, however,
neither opted to produce defense evidence nor
wished to be examined on Oath under section
340(2) Cr.PC. After full-fledged trial, the
learned trial Court acquitted the accused Nasir
Ali, Amjad and Zahid Ali, whereas the appellant
Saddam was convicted and sentenced in the
earlier part of this judgment, hence, the instant

appeal.

4. The learned counsel for the parties were

heard at length alongwith learned Addl. AG
and with their valuable assistance the record

was scanned through.

5. In the unfortunate incident the deceased
after receiving firearm injuries died on the spot
and his dead body was shifted to the hospital
through rescue 1122. The matter was reported
to the local police by the complainant and after
the report injury sheet and inquest report were
prepared. The dead body was sent for
postmortem examination. The investigating
officer visited the spot and on pointation of the
witnesses prepared the site plan. During spot
inspection the investigating officer collected
blood from the place of the deceased and six
(06) empties of .30 bore from the spot. The
accused was arrested near from the spot and
from his possession a .30 bore pistol was
recovered. The pistol and the recovered
empties were sent to the firearms expert to
ascertain as to whether the same were fired
from the recovered pistol. A report was
received confirming the fact that the empties
were fired from the recovered pistol. The

accused faced the trial and conclusion of the
trial was convicted and sentenced vide the

impugned judgment.

6. The learned trial Court after full dressed
trial found the appellant guilty and as such was
convicted and sentenced. As in the instant
case not only single accused is charged, but
the appellant was also shown arrested from
the place of incident with a pistol in his
possession, so this Court deems it essential to
look into the matter by applying extra care and
to appreciate the approach of the learned trial
Court to the facts and circumstances of the
case. True that in case of single accused
substitution is a rare phenomenon, but equally
true that single accused by itself is not a
ground for holding him responsible, unless the
prosecution establishes the charges through
confidence inspiring and trustworthy evidence.
We are to see as to whether it was the spot
arrest of the appellant which helped the
learned trial Court in pronouncing him guilty or
that the learned trial Court did appreciate the
attending circumstances of the present case.
We are not hesitant in holding that the accused

is shown arrested near from the spot and from
his personal possession a .30 bore pistol was
recovered which wedded with the recovered
empties, but this is for the prosecution to tell
the manner in which he was arrested and to
convince the safe custody of the recovered
pistol and its safe transmission to the firearms
expert. As this case because of its peculiar
circumstances needs extra care, so for the
same the entire record was scanned through
and we want to reassess the already assessed
evidence, so that miscarriage of justice could

be avoided.

Z. The points for determination before this
Court are that; as to whether the incident
occurred in the mode, manner and at the
stated time; as to whether the witnesses were
present on the spot at the time of occurrence
and in the hospital at the time of report; as to
whether the accused/appellant was arrested
soon after the incident and that from his
personal possession a .30 bore pistol was
recovered; as to whether the recovery of the
weapon, its safe custody and its safe
transmission to the firearms expert is proved

on record; as to whether the same can be
taken into consideration for holding the
appellant responsible for the murder of the
deceased and as to whether the prosecution
succeeded in bringing home guilt against the

appellant.

8. The tragic incident claimed the life of
the deceased and that for the same the
appellant is charged, but to ascertain the
manner in which the incident occurred and the
manner in which the appellant was arrested, it
is essential that the statements of the
witnesses must be taken into consideration
and also the respective recoveries made either
from the spot or from the appellant, at the time
of his arrest. The complainant while reporting
the matter disclosed that on the day of incident
he alongwith the deceased and the eyewitness
had come to District Courts, Peshawar, in
connection of their pending cases; that after
doing the needful, they left the Courts and
reached to the place of incident; that the
accused attracted to the spot duly armed and
started firing at the deceased; The deceased
received firearm injuries, died on the spot; that

they were also fired at, but they luckily
escaped unhurt; that the dead body of the
deceased was shifted to the hospital and he
reported the matter. The witness was
examined on material aspects of the case with
the only intention to extract something
favourable to the appellant and to confirm his
presence on the spot. The eyewitness did not
appear before the Court and instead he
submitted a sworn affidavit regarding his.
absence and that of the complainant, at the
time of incident. As the eyewitness was not
supporting the case of the prosecution, so he
was not produced and was declared as won
over and as such the complainant is the sole
eyewitness. As one of the witness did not
support the case of the prosecution and as the
complainant is the real brother of the
deceased, so we are under obligation to take
extra care while determining the fate of the
appellant, that too, on the strength of a single
eyewitness. We are anxious to know the
purpose of his presence on the spot and we
are keen to discover that on the day of incident
the complainant, the eyewitness and the
deceased had come to the Courts to pursue

his case. We are to see as to whether the
a

complainant had a case in the Courts and that
what evidence is brought on record in that
respect. As the complainant is the resident of a
village lying away from the place of incident, so
it is for the complainant to convince that on the
day of incident he, the deceased and the
eyewitness visited Peshawar in connection of
his pending cases. We despite efforts could
not come across any evidence showing his
activities, in Courts, on the day of incident.
Neither the complainant nor the eyewitness
could provide the relevant documents to the
investigating officer and even the investigating
Officer failed to collect any evidence from the
concerned quarters. The complainant could not
disclose the nature of his case, the Court he
attended and the advocate whose services
were hired. When the most relevant evidence
was neither collected, nor brought on record
so, this Court is hesitant to accept his
presence and that of the eyewitness, at the
place of incident and at the time of incident,
rather this Court is to walk an extra mile to

appreciate their presence on the spot.
9. As the complainant and the eyewitness
are the residents of village Bakhshu Pull, lying
away from the place of incident, so his
presence at the spot is to be judged from his
presence in the hospital and from the manner
in which he reported the matter. It is pertinent
to mention that the dead body was collected
from the spot by rescue 1122 and that soon
thereafter the same was shifted to the hospital,
but the matter was reported at 1220 hours after
the delay of more than fifty (50) minutes. As
the hospital is situated at a little distance from
the place of occurrence and as the dead body
was collected from the spot by rescue 1122, so
the time spent in reporting the matter cannot
lightly be ignored. When the same is taken into
consideration, it further increases the anxiety
of this Court regarding the presence of the
complainant at the time of incident and at the
time of report. True that the matter was
reported by the complainant, but the dead
body was neither identified by the complainant,
nor the eyewitness, even at the time of report
and even at the time of its examination. The
identifiers were belonging to the village of the

complainant, so their arrival to the hospital at
11

the time of report is a circumstance which
indicates that they accompanied the
complainant to the hospital after receiving
information regarding the incident. The
circumstances do tell that the complainant after
receiving information regarding the incident
reached to the hospital alongwith the identifiers
and thereafter the report was made. As the
complainant failed to establish his presence
with the deceased and as the purpose to visit
Peshawar was not proved through the relevant
witnesses, so an impression can be gathered,
that first the injury sheet and inquest report
were prepared, and thereafter the report was
made. We cannot exclude the possibility of

preliminary investigation in the present case.

10. In the site plan the accused, the
deceased, the eyewitnesses and the police
Officials are shown at their respective places.
The deceased is shown at Point No.1, whereas
the appellant at Point No.2. The complainant
and the eyewitness are shown at Point No.3
and Point No.4 respectively. The distance
between Point No.1, 3 and 4 is shown 25

paces, as at the time of incident the deceased
was present on the Railway track. This is for
the witnesses to tell that when they came out
to the road to go to the village, then what for
the deceased went to the Railway track, as
complainant, the deceased and the eyewitness
were to arrange a vehicle from the main road.
It is surprising that the deceased was shown
25 paces ahead of the complainant and the
eyewitness, at a place where the deceased
had no purpose to visit. The site plan depicts
that to the extreme East of the Railway track
there is a boundary wall of the doctor colony,
and the Railway track being abandoned is
often used by the drug addicts and the defence
also suggested the same to the witnesses, but
no positive reply was given. When all the three
reached to the main road, then at what time
the deceased went so fast to cover the
distance of 25 paces and even the witnesses
could not explain that what for the deceased
went to the Railway track. The complainant
also disclosed that he and the eyewitness was
fired at, but they escaped unhurt. Had the
witnesses been present and had they been
fired at, then there was hardly an occasion for

them to escape unhurt, but the record
suggests that neither they were fired at, nor
they were present on the spot. Reliance is
placed on the judgment in case titled
“Muhammad Imran Vs The State” (2020

YLR 1139), wherein it is held that:-

“The alleged motive was against
the complainant, but it is noted
that the appellant did not cause
any injury to the complainant,
though he was present within the
range of firing, thus it supports the
contention of the learned counsel
of appellant that P.Ws. were not
present at the place of
occurrence."

41. The investigating officer was examined
as PW-6, who stated that after receiving copy
of the FIR he visited the spot and that on
pointation of the witnesses prepared the site
pian. It is pertinent to mention that regarding
arrest of the accused the investigating officer
explained that the appellant was arrested by
the security incharge, Central | Prison
Peshawar, and that it was he who recovered a
30 bore pistol from his possession.
Interestingly, the said police official was neither
examined in the trial Court, nor his statement
under section 161 Cr.P.C was recorded. The

investigating officer surprised us by telling that
the appellant was arrested alongwith three
other suspects, when the appellant was
arrested from the spot soon after the incident,
then what for other persons were taken into
custody on suspicion. The statement of the
investigating officer get support from the
statement of PW-2, who is also the marginal
witness of the recovery memo through which
the pistol was taken into possession. This
witness also disclosed that the appellant was
arrested alongwith three other suspects, when
so, then the arrest of the appellant is shrouded
in mystery, more particularly, when the very
person, who arrested him, was not produced.
In respect of arrest of the appellant the
prosecution came forward with different
explanation through different witnesses. PW-2
explained in his examination in chief that the
appellant was arrested by him with the help of
constable Bilal and he further explained that
after arrest of the appellant a sub-inspector
reached to the spot and recovered a .30 bore
pistol from the possession of the appellant, but
in his cross-examination he narrated the

incident in a different manner. The relevant
portion from his cross-examination reads as

follows:-

“The persons who made firing were not
visible to us. | do not know that whether
other persons armed with weapons were
arrested or not on the day of occurrence. |
do not remember that whether the three
other people who were arrested by us were
armed with weapons or not because
sufficient time has elapsed. My statement
was recorded by the investigating officer in
the police station. | do not remember that
after how much time of the arrest of the
accused he was handed over to the local
police.” Similarly, the investigating officer
claimed the arrest of the appellant and so the
relevant portion from his examination in chief is
reproduced, “On 24.02.2020 | was present on
special duty Assembly Corner Chowk,
when at about 1130 hours | heard fire shots
from High Court gate side. | rushed towards
the place of occurrence and saw that a
person having a pistol in his hand was
running towards Central Jail, Peshawar..../
arrested the accused in front of gate No.2
of Central Jail adjacent to Nishtar Hall. The
accused was holding a pistol in his hand
which I took into possession vide recovery
memo already exhibit Ex.PW2/1.” This
witness in his cross-examination explained the
arrest of appellant in a different manner, “It is
true that on the day and time of occurrence
total four persons who were armed were
shown arrested by the Jail security officials
and were handed over to the Police Station
East Cantt: including accused facing trial
Saddam. Witness volunteered that after the
incident so many suspects were arrested
by the Jail security.”

The investigating officer gave self
contradictory statements and when his
statements are read with that of the PW-2 i.e.
Haris, then the arrest of the appellant becomes
disputed. As on one hand PW-2 claimed to
have arrested the appellant with the help of
one Bilal, whereas the investigating officer in
his examination in chief claimed to have
arrested the appellant, but in his cross-
examination he denies the same and explains
the circumstances in a different manner. In his
cross-examination he confirmed that the
appellant was arrested by the security officials
of Central Jail, Peshawar, whereas in his
further statement he disclosed that the
appellant alongwith other suspects was
handed over to him in the police station.
Regarding the recovery of pistol PW-2 Haris
Stated that when the appellant was arrested by
him, an SI attracted to the spot and recovered

a pistol from his possession, but the
17

investigating officer in his cross-examination
disclosed that it was he who arrested the
appellant and recovered a pistol from his
possession. When the arrest of the appellant is
disputed and when the investigating officer as
well as PW-2 contradicted each other
regarding the arrest of the appellant, then the
recovery from possession of the appellant by
the investigating officer also does not appeal to
mind. The most crucial aspect of the case is
the cross-examination of PW Haris which
reads as, “My statement was recorded in
police station East Cantt: on the following day
of the occurrence. It is also correct that memo
Ex.PW2/1 was signed by me in police station
East Cantt: on the following day of
occurrence.” When admittedly, the recovery
memo was not signed by the marginal witness
on the day when the pistol was recovered and
when the witness admitted that he visited the
police station on the next day of the incident
and signed the recovery memo Ex.PW2/1,
then the recovery of pistol, from the appellant,
on the day of incident has lost its utility and the
Prosecution failed to convince that the

appellant was arrested soon after the incident
and that the pistol was recovered from his
possession. The arrest of the appellant and the
recovery of pistol from his possession could
not be proved and the witnesses remained
inconsistent on this particular aspect of the
case. Once the eyewitness fails to establish his
presence on the spot and once the arrest of
the appellant is disputed and also the recovery
of pistol from his possession, then the
prosecution is left with no evidence to connect
the appellant with the murder of the deceased.
True that the learned trial Court was influenced
from his arrest and from recovery from his
. personal possession, but equally true that the
learned trial Court fell into error while relying
upon the same. We are benefited from the
judgment of apex Court in case titled “State
through Advocate General, Sindh, Karachi
Vs Abdul Hameed and another” (1984 P.Cr.

LJ 1508), which reads as follows:-

“Story about arrest of accused
becoming doubtful by conflicting
version of eye-witness and
Investigating Officer on this point-—-
Prosecution failing to produce
evidence of satisfactory nature to
connect accused with commission of
offence and pieces of evidence
produced by prosecution all tainted
and prosecution failing to prove case
against accused beyond doubt.”
19

The complainant while reporting the matter
introduced one Muhammad Raza _ Khan
(maternal cousin) as the eyewitness, but he did
not support the prosecution case and sworn an
affidavit regarding his absence and that of the
complainant at the time of incident. True that
the affidavit alone would hardly be a
circumstance to exclude the presence of the
complainant, but equally true that the
eyewitness was related to the complainant and
he should have come forward to support his
case. The non-appearance of the eyewitness
and the submission of an affidavit, regarding
his presence on the spot can be taken into
consideration in favour of the appellant. Not
only the appellant, but two others were also
charged for abetment, with whom the
complainant had blood feud. As on one hand
the complainant could not convince that how
and through whom he came to know about the
consultation of the acquitted co-accused with
the appellant and that when he received the
said information. The circumstances do tell that
the complainant is not the eyewitness and that
the appellant and two others were charged

because of previous blood feud. As the most
20

relevant witness was not produced, so an
inference can be drawn that the witness was
not ready to support the false claim of the
complainant and had he been produced he
would have not supported the case of the
prosecution. On one hand the complainant
failed to establish his presence on the spot,
whereas on the other the most important
witness was abandoned as won over, so an
adverse inference can be drawn that the
witness was not ready to support the false
claim of the complainant. The -like situation is
covered by Article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984. In the like
circumstances wisdom is drawn under Article
129 (g) of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order 1984
and the present case is no exception, as is
held in case titled “Riaz Ahmed Vs. the State

(2010 SCMR 846), which reads as follows:-

“One of the eye-witnesses
Manzoor Hussain was available in
the Court on 29-7-2002 but the
prosecution did not examine him,
declaring him as unnecessary
witness without realizing the fact
that he was the most important,
only serving witness, being an
eye-witness of the occurrence.
Therefore, his evidence was the
best piece of the evidence, which
the prosecution could have relied
21

upon for proving the case but for
the reasons best known, his
evidence was withheld and he
was not examined. So a
presumption under Illustration (g)
of Article 129 of Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 can fairly
be drawn that had the eye-
witness Manzoor Hussain been
examined in the Court his
evidence would have been
unfavourable to the prosecution.”

12. The pistol was recovered on 24.02.2020
and so the empties, but the same were
received to the laboratory on 28.02.2020, i.e.
after four days of its recovery, but the
investigating officer could not explain the
delay. As on one hand the witnesses remained
inconsistent on the arrest and recovery of
pistol from possession of the appellant,
whereas on the other the recovery memo was
prepared on the next day and signed by the
marginal witness in the police station, so its
recovery from the appellant is shrouded in
mystery and the contradictory statements of
the witnesses questioned its authenticity. As
the recovery of the weapon is not in
accordance with law and as the same was sent
to the firearms expert after long four days of its

recovery so, it's safe custody and its safe
|

22

transmission to the firearms expert could not
be established, when so, then this Court lurks
no doubt in mind that this piece of evidence
has lost its utility and the same cannot be

taken into consideration. As is held in case titled

“Bakht Munir Vs the State” (2016 MLD 934),
it is held that:

“Besides, the crime pistol had
been allegedly recovered on the
same day of _ incident i.e.
14.01.2012, but has been sent to
the FSL with the crime empties on
21.01.2012 i.e. after a delay of
seven days, for which no
explanation, much less plausible
has been furnished by the
prosecution as to where and in
whose custody the pistol and
empties remained for this period
and whether these were in safe
hands. Muhammad Akbar Khan
S.1 (PW.7/Investigating Officer
deposed that he has not recorded
statement of any concerned
person regarding delay in sending
the articles to the FSL.”

13. The motive is given as previous blood
feud between the parties, but neither the
complainant, nor the investigating officer could
collect any evidence in that respect and even
no independent witness was examined to
confirm the involvement of the deceased in the
earlier episode, so we are confident in holding

that the prosecution failed to establish the
23

motive. True that absence or weakness of
motive would hardly be a circumstance to be
taken for the acquittal of an accused, but
equally true that once the eyewitness account
fails, then the absence of motive can be taken
into consideration even for the acquittal of an
accused and the present case is no exception.
Reliance is placed on case titled “Muhammad
Bux Vs Abdul Aziz and others” (2010 SCMR

1959), which reads as follows:-

In this case motive is an important
fact, which has not only been
alleged in the F.I.R. but .the
evidence has been led. The said
motive has not been relied upon
by the trial Court and the High
‘Court as the prosecution failed to
prove the same. In such a
situation, the Court should be very
careful in accepting prosecution
story and the evidence of such
witnesses who not only gave
evidence on motive and incident
should be accepted with great
caution. It has been held in the
case of Muhammad Sadiq v.
Muhammad Sarwar (1979 SCMR
214) that when motive is alleged
but not proved then the ocular
evidence required to be
scrutinized with great caution.”

14. The cumulative effect of what has been
Stated above leads this court to an irresistible
conclusion that the prosecution failed to bring

home guilt against the appellant and the
24

learned trial Court while handing down the
impugned judgment misdirected itself, both on
facts and in law, hence, the same calls for
interference. The instant criminal appeal is
allowed, the impugned judgment is set aside.
The appellant is acquitted of the charge. He
shall be released forthwith, from jail, if not
required to be detained in any other criminal

case.

Above are the detailed reasons for our

short order of even date.
