JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.-

Petitioners (1) Asadullah (2) Jehanzeb and

(3) Naseem Ullah, seek bail in case FIR No.176

dated 24.05.2015, registered under sections

302/148/149 PPC, in Police Station Shahbaz

Garhi, Mardan, wherein they alongwith

absconding co-accused Zia Ullah, and Sohail,

are charged for committing the murder of Majid

Ullah deceased son of â€” complainant

Mst. Haseena by firing at him, on a motive of a

land dispute.

2. Arguments heard and record gone
through.
3. True that all the petitioners have been

directly nominated in the FIR, but according to
autopsy report of the Majid Ullah deceased he
sustained single firearm entry wound which
resulted his death, which shot has been
specifically attributed to absconding co-accused
Zia Ullah. Though, petitioners have been shown
at crime venue with deadly weapons at the time
of incident, but there is no allegation of firing
against them. The only allegation against
petitioners is that of grappling with the deceased,
but autopsy report of the deceased does not
support the aforesaid version as neither any
scratch nor bruises has been observed on the
dead body of the deceased. In absence of any

overt act of the petitioners, question of their

common intention with the principal accused,

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

cannot be determined without recording

evidence, when they have not actively

participated in the occurrence. On tentative

assessment of the material available on record,

participation of the accused-petitioners in the

commission of crime requires further inquiry. It

is settled law that bail may not be refused merely

on the ground that accused is directly charged in

the F.I.R for a heinous offence, when otherwise,

he is found entitled to the concession of bail

because any mistaken relief of bail can be

repaired by convicting the accused, if proved

guilty at the trial, but no proper reparation can be

offered to him for his unjustified incarceration,

albeit, his acquittal in the long run.

4. In view of the above stated reasons, I am

inclined to exercise the discretion of bail in

favour of the petitioners. Resultantly, the petition

is allowed. Petitioners are admitted to bail,

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

provided each one of them furnishes bail bonds

in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two sureties

each in the like amount to the satisfaction of

learned [Illaqa Judicial Magistrate/MOD

concerned. The sureties must be local, reliable

and men of means.

Announced
27.08.2015.
