JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- Petitioner

Ahmadullah, seeks bail in case FiR No.1348 dated
29.09.2015, registered under section 489-B PPC, in police
Station Hayat Abad Peshawar.

2. Allegations against the petitioner are that on
29.09.2015 at 2100 hours, on Jamrod road near Karkhano
market, falls within the limits of Police Station Hayatabad
Peshawar, the local police recovered Pakistani currency
amounting to Rs.1600570/- and 6500 fake US dollars from
his motorcar alongwith other articles such as his driving
and arms licenses etc.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. It appears from the record that besides the
alleged fake U.S. dollars a huge quantity of Pakistani

currency has also been shown recovered from possession

of the petitioner, but the same is genuine. As per record
petitioner is a business man and is running his business in
Karkhano market, Peshawar. Section 489-B PPC deals
with using as genuine, forged or counterfeit currency-notes
or bank-notes. There is no allegation of using of the
alleged fake U.S. dollars by the petitioner. At the most, the
case of the petitioner would fall within preview of section
489-C PPC, according to which whoever has in his
possession any forged or counterfeit currency-note or
bank-note, knowing or having reason to believe the same
to be forged or counterfeit and intending to use the same as
genuine or that it may be used as genuine, shall be
punished with imprisonment of either description for a
term which may extent to seven years or with fine or with
both. It is settled that in case of two punishments provided
for an offence, the lesser one is to be taken into
consideration against the accused at bail stage. So in this
way, the lesser punishment would be fine only. Besides,
the pre-requisites to constitute the offence under section
489-C PPC, i.e. knowledge of the petitioner qua the
recovered currency to be forged and his intention to use the
same as genuine or his knowledge that it may be used as
genuine, are yet to be determined during trial, after

recording evidence. No Report of the Currency Expert qua

genuineness or otherwise of the recovered dollars is
available on file, so on this score too, the case of the
petitioner is arguable for the purpose of bail.

5. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he
furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two
local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD, concerned.

record to the quarter concerned within two days, positively.
