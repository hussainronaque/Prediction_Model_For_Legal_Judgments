FAZAL SUBHAN, J.--- Instant is a__ bail
application of petitioner Zeeshan son fo Nasib
Ullah, who is seeking his post-arrest bail in
connection with case FIR No.571 dated
22.10.2023 u/s 9 (D)/11 (B) of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotics and Substances
Act, 2019 of Police Station, Yaqoob Khan
Shaheed, Takht-e-Nasrati, District Karak.

2. The prosecution case is that on
22.10.2023, Abdus Salam ASI, during search and
strike operation of the area along with other police
party, mentioned in the FIR, was present on the
spot when saw a person having plastic bag in his

left hand, who on seeing the police party tried to
escape, however, he was chased and apprehended
and the plastic bag was taken into possession by
the complainant. On checking the same 2 packets
of charas were recovered. On weighment total
charas came out 2524 grams. On further checking
of the plastic bag a small plastic envelope
containing 115 grams Ice was recovered. 5/5
grams charas was separated from each packet for
FSL and sealed in separate parcels No.1 and 2
while the remaining charas was sealed in parcel
No.3. Similarly, 01 grams Ice was separated from
the whole stuff for FSL analysis and sealed in
parcel while the remaining 114 grams Ice was
sealed in parcel No.5. On cursory interrogation the
accused disclosed his name as Zeeshan son of
Naseeb Ullah. After necessary proceedings on the
spot, murasila was sent to the Police Station,
hence, the case in hand was registered against the
petitioner.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for
petitioner and that of learned AAG for the State

heard and record perused.
4. After hearing arguments and tentative
assessment of record, it is clear that though
petitioner is directly charged in the FIR and
considerable quantity of charas were allegedly
recovered from his direct/conscious possession,
however, learned counsel for petitioner produced
secondary school certificate of the petitioner which
shows his date of birth as 28.4.2007 and as per the
said certificate, at the time of alleged offence i.e.
on 22.10.2023, his age was 16 years, hence for all
practicable purposes he is a juvenile and, therefore,
under section 6 sub-section | of the Juvenile
Justice System Act, 2018, he deserve the
concession of bail. Record further shows that after
the alleged recovery no videography whatsoever
was carried out and, therefore, the judgment
passed by this court in Cr. MBA No.2729-P/2022
has not been complied. Moreso, the sample parcels
were sent to the FSL authorities after 5 days of
delay which also provides a_ ground for
consideration of this Court at bail stage.

5. For all the above reasons, the instant

petition is accepted and the petitioner is released
on bail provided he furnishes bail bonds of
Rs.2,00,000/-(Rupees Two Lac) with two local and
reliable sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of trial Court/ Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/ MOD concerned.

These are the detailed reasons of my
short order of even date.

Announced.
