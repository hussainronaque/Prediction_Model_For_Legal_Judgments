Riaz Ahmad Vs. The State & another

JUDGMENT

Date of hearing. | 12.10.2020.

Mr. Saleem Ullah Khan Balouch
Advocate.

Appellant by:

Mr. Waqas Anwar, Deputy Prosecutor

State by: General

Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan, J:- This appeal is directed

against judgment dated 30.11.2018, passed by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge, Pindi Bhattian, whereby, in case F.LR
No.135 dated 02.03.2017, registered at Police Station Jalalpur
Bhattian under section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances
Act, 1997, the learned trial Court convicted Riaz Ahmad, appellant

and sentenced him as under:

Under_ Section _9(c) of Control_of

Narcotic Substances Act 1997 to four
years RI with fine of Rs.8,000/- and in
default of payment thereof the appellant
was directed to further undergo S.I for
four months and fifteen days.

The benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C.
was also extended to the appellant.

2. Briefly, the accusation levelled in the FIR against the
appellant is that on 02.03.2017 at 3:50 P.M., Muhammad Yaqoob,
SI (complainant/PW-1), along with other police officials, on spy
information, conducted a raid and apprehended Riaz Ahmad
(appellant). During search of the appellant opium weighing 1110-

grams was recovered from the shopper bag caught by the
Crl. Appeal No.11595 of 2019 2

appellant in his right hand. The above mentioned recovered opium
was sealed into a separate parcel and the same was sent for
Chemical Analysis. The appellant was interrogated and challaned
to face the trial. The charge was framed against the appellant on
31.03.2017, to which he pleaded not guilty so the prosecution was
directed to produce its evidence. The prosecution produced six
witnesses to prove its case. The learned Additional Sessions
Judge, Pindi Bhattian, after recording the statement of the
appellant under section 342 Cr.P.C and hearing the arguments,
passed the impugned judgment, whereby, the appellant was

convicted and sentenced as mentioned and detailed above.

3. Feeling aggrieved of the impugned judgment, the instant

appeal has been preferred by the appellant.

4. Learned counsel for the appellant in support of this appeal
contends that full protocols were not mentioned by the office of
Punjab Forensic Science Agency while preparing the report
(Ex.PD); that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case
against the appellant beyond the shadow of doubt, therefore, the
appellant may be acquitted from the charge while setting aside the

impugned judgment.

5. On the other hand, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General
has supported the impugned judgment of the learned trial Court by
contending that the prosecution has proved its case against the
appellant beyond the shadow of any doubt, therefore, the appellant
was rightly convicted and sentenced by the learned trial Court;
that the appellant cannot be acquitted on the sole ground that full
protocols have not been mentioned in the report of Punjab
Forensic Science Agency; that there is no substance in the present

appeal, therefore, the same may be dismissed.

6. Arguments heard. Record perused.
Crl. Appeal No.11595 of 2019 3

7. It is by now well settled that since the provisions of The
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, provide stringent
punishments, therefore, their proof has to be construed strictly and
the benefit of any doubt in the prosecution case must be extended
to the accused. Reference in this respect may be made to the case

of “Muhammad Hashim V. The State”. (PLD 2004 Supreme

Court 856). Dealing with the same proposition, the Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan held in the case of “Ameer Zeb V. The
State”’ (PLD 2012 Supreme Court 380) that harder the sentence,

stricter the standard of proof. Seeking guidance from the above
mentioned judgments of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan,
we proceed to decide the instant case. We have observed that the
report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Ex.PE), tendered in
evidence by the prosecution in this case does not give the details
of the full protocols and the test applied at the time of analysis of
sample of narcotics allegedly recovered from the possession of the

appellant.

Relevant/operative part of the report of the Punjab Forensic
Science Agency tendered in evidence by the prosecution as

(Ex.PE), reads as under:-
Item No. Description of Evidence

Ol. One sealed parcel containing
approximately 1110 gram(s) of
suspected Opium.

Tests Performed on Received Item(s) of

Evidence
1. Top-Load Balance was used for weighing.

2. Chemical Spot Tests were used for Presumptive
Testing.

3. Gas Chromatograph-Mass spectrometry was used for
confirmation.

Results and Conclusion:-

Item # 01 1115.6 gram(s) of blackish brown resinous
material in sealed parcel contains Opium.
Crl. Appeal No.11595 of 2019 4

Undisputedly, it is settled by now that any report failing to
describe in it, the details of the full protocols and the tests applied
will be inconclusive, unreliable suspicious and untrustworthy and
will not meet the evidentiary presumption attached to a Report of
the Government Analyst under section 36(2) of the Act ibid. In the
report Ex.PE, it is simply mentioned that certain tests were
conducted and contraband material recovered in this case was
found to be Opium instead of mentioning the details of tests
applied on the samples and their protocols as required by law. The
evidentiary value of above said report has been evaluated by us in
the light of Control of Narcotic Substances (Government
Analysts) Rules, 2001. Rule 6 of the said Rules makes it
imperative on an analyst to mention result of material analyzed
with full protocols applied thereon along with other details in the

report issued for test/Analysis by the Laboratory.

8. | We also find that the report (Ex.PE), of the Punjab Forensic
Science Agency, Lahore is not in line with the principles
enunciated by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of
“The State through Regional Director ANF Vs. Imam Bakhsh and
others” (2018 SCMR 2039). The relevant portion of the said

judgment is reproduced as under:-

16. Non-compliance of Rule 6 can frustrate the
purpose and object of the Act, i.e., control of
production, processing and trafficking of
narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, as
conviction cannot be sustained on a Report that
is inconclusive or unreliable. The evidentiary
assumption attached to a Report of the
Government Analyst under section 36(2) of the
Act underlines the statutory significance of the
Report, therefore, details of the test and
analysis in the shape of the protocols applied
for the test become fundamental and go to the
root of the statutory scheme. Rule 6 is,
therefore, in the public interest and safeguards
the rights of the parties. Any report (Form-II)
failing to give details of the full protocols of the
test applied will be inconclusive, unreliable,
suspicious and untrustworthy and will not meet
the evidentiary assumption attached to a Report
of the Government Analyst under section 36(2).
Crl. Appeal No.11595 of 2019 5

Resultantly, it will hopelessly fail to support
conviction of the accused. This Court has
already emphasized the importance of protocols
in Ikramullah’s case (supra)”.

The above said view has been further fortified in the recent case

law titled as “Khair-ul-Bashar Vs. The STate” (2019 SCMR

930). We have also requisitioned the attested copy of FIR in case
of “Khair-ul-Basher” (supra) i.e., FIR No.18, dated 15.01.2016,
offence under section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances
Act, 1997, registered at Police Station Westridge, District
Rawalpindi, as well as, attested copy of the report of the Punjab
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore, exhibited as Ex.PH, in the said
case before the concerned trial Court. The report of the Punjab
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore, produced in evidence as
Ex.PH, in the case of “Khair-ul-Basher” (supra) is identical with
the report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore,
produced in the evidence of the present case before the learned
trial Court as Ex.PE. As identical report in the case of “Khair-ul-
Basher” (supra) has not been relied upon by the august Supreme
Court of Pakistan, therefore, report of the Punjab Forensic Science
Agency produced in evidence of this case by the prosecution as

Ex.PE, is also not worthy of reliance.

9. Learned Deputy Prosecutor General has argued that the
appellant cannot be acquitted on the above mentioned sole ground
of non-mentioning of protocols/full details of test applied, in the
report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore but we
have noted that the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case
of “Khair-ul-Bashar” (supra), acquitted the accused of the said
case on the abovementioned sole ground of non-mentioning of
protocols/full details of the tests applied in the report of the
Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore. Even otherwise, it is by
now well settled that a single circumstance creating reasonable
doubt would be sufficient to cast doubt about the veracity of

prosecution case and the benefit of said doubt has to be extended
Crl. Appeal No.11595 of 2019 6

in favour of the accused not as a matter of grace or concession but
as a matter of right. Reliance in this regard is placed upon the
cases of “Tariq Pervez Vs. The State” (1995 SCMR 1345),
“Akhtar Ali _and others Vs. The State” (2008 SCMR 06) and
“Muhammad Zaman Vs. The State and others” (2014 SCMR
749).

10. In the light of above discussion, the instant appeal (Cr.
Appeal No.11595 of 2019), is allowed, impugned judgment dated
30.11.2018, passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge,
Pindi Bhattian is hereby set aside and Riaz Ahmad (appellant) is
acquitted of the charge by extending him the benefit of doubt. The
appellant is in custody, he be released forthwith, if not required in

any other case.
