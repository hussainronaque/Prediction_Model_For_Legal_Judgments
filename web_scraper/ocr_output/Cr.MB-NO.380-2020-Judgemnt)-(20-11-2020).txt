SAHIBZADA_ASADULLAH, J.- Being booked in
case FIR No.198 dated 11.6.2020, registered under
Section 302/34 PPC at police station Daraban Kalan,
accused/petitioner Faheem son of Nizam ud Din has
approached this Court for his release on bail, as he was
declined bail by the Court of learned Additional Judge
Model Criminal Tria! Court, D.I.Khan vide order dated
18.9.2020.

2. Brief facts of the case as narrated in the
FIR, are that on 11.6.2020 at 13:30 hours, complainant
Habib Ullah, made report to the local police of police
station Daraban on the spot where dead body of his
brother Muhammad Wagar was lying, stating therein

that he was present in his house when received
-2-

information that on preceding night at about 02:00
hours, his brother Wagar had visited the house of
Mst. Uzma Bibi, sister of the accused/petitioner to meet
her, as he had friendly terms with said Uzma Bibi; that
co-accused Nizam ud Din alongwith the petitioner saw
the deceased with Mst. Uzma Bibi in her room and
apprehended him, tied his hands, took him to the fields
where they committed his murder. On the report of
complainant, instant case vide the captioned FIR was
registered against the accused. |

3. Arguments of Jearned counsel for the
petitioner and the learned State counsel assisted by
learned counsel for the complainant heard at length and
record perused with their valuable assistance.

4. On scanning the record, it transpires that
the occurrence took place on the night of 11.6.2020 at
02:00 hours, whereas the report was lodged on the said
date at 13:30 hours. There is inordinate and unexplained
delay in lodging the report and the complainant has not
disclosed the source of information regarding the
occurrence in his report. Undeniably, the occurrence has
not been witnessed by anyone. The learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the petitioner argued that there is
no evidence against the accused/petitioner which could
link him with the commission of offence. He stressed

that in view of contradiction inter se the statements of
-3-

Mst. Uzma Bibi, recorded under Section 161 and 164,
Cr.P.C, the case of accused/petitioner requires further
probe. I have carefully perused the statement of Mst.
Uzma Bibi, recorded by the investigating agency under
section 161, Cr.P.C. and the statement recorded before
Judicial Magistrate PHP/MOD, D.J.Khan and found that
in the statement before the police, she charged the
accused, whereas in the statement recorded before the
Judicial Magistrate, she resiled from her earlier stance
by exonerating the accused from the commission of the
offence, which makes the case of petitioner that of
further inquiry. Moreso, the call data which was
necessary evidence in the present has not been placed on
the file to show contact between the deceased and Mst.
Uzma Bibi, sister of the accused/petitioner, before the
occurrence.

5. No doubt, a 30 bore pistol was recovered
on pointation of the accused/petitioner which was sent to
the Forensic Science Laboratory alongwith the
recovered empties while were found to have been fired
from the recovered pistol. The learned counsel
representing the complainant submitted that the positive
report has left no doubt regarding the involvement of
petitioner in the episode. This Court is not in agreement
with what the learned counsel submitted, as admittedly

the recovered pistol is the ownership of the absconding
-4-

co-accused who happens to be the father of petitioner
and the evidentiary value of this piece of evidence can
better be determined in case of the co-accused, who is
still at-large and is its owner. Furthermore, the petitioner
is of tender age which too tilts the scale in his favour.

6. It is established principle of law that
benefit of doubt can even be extended at bail stage.
Reliance in this regard can be placed on the case law
teported as “Muhammad Faisal Vs. The State and
another” (2020 SCMR 971).

7. It is now well settled that an accused
cannot be kept in jail as punishment merely on the
ground that he is directly charged for an offence falling
under the prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C.,
because a mistaken relief of bail may be repaired by
convicting the accused, if proved guilty, but no proper
reparation can be offered for his unjustified
incarceration, albeit, his acquittal in the long run.
Reliance is placed on case titled “Zaigham Ashraf Vs

the State and others’ (22016 SCMR_18),wherein it is

held that:

“9, To curtail the liberty of a person is a
serious step in law, therefore, the Judges
shall apply judicial mind with deep
thought for reaching at a fair and proper
conclusion albeit tentatively however,
this exercise shall not to be carried out
in vacuum or in a flimsy and casual

”

manner.

8. Tentative assessment of the material
available on file suggests that the case of petitioner is
arguable for the purpose of bail. Resultantly, this
petition is allowed and the petitioner is directed to be
released on bail subject to furnishing bail bond in the
sum of Rs:2,00,000/- (rupees two lac) with two sureties,
each in the like amount, to the satisfaction of learned
Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate. Needless to mention that
the observations made above are purely tentative in
nature which shall not prejudice the mind of trial Court.

9. Above are detailed reasons of my short
order of even date.

Announced.
Dt: 20.11.2020.
