JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT
JUDGMENT SHEET

Cr. M_(Bail) No. 291-A/2020.

Date of hearing 20.04.2020.
Petitioner/s (Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah) by
Mr. Amjad Khan, Advocate.

Respondent/s (State & complainant) by
Sardar Muhammad Asif, Assistant AG.
AHMAD ALI. J. Through this petition,
accused/petitioner seeks his release on bail,
who is charged in case FIR No. 45 dated:
09.01.2020 under section 376, 419, 420, 466,
468, 471, 109/34 registered at Police Station,
Cantt, District, Abbottabad.

2. As two other co-accused namely
Muhammad Aslam and Muhammad Ashraf
have also moved their bail petition bearing
No. 295-A/2020 titled: Muhammad Aslam &
another Vs. State & another, therefore, same
shall also be decided through this single
order.

3. Brief but relevant facts as narrated in
the first information report are that

complainant Mst. Gul Bibi submitted an
application to the local police by stating that
she was in Dar-ul-Aman since two years. As
she wanted to marry with one Wafaq
Ahmed, so with the consent of her parents,
she asked the Incharge Dar-ul-Aman in this
respect. As the said Wafaq Ahmed was
nephew of Arif, who is the clerk of Social
Welfare Department. On 20 April 2020, she
was discharged from Dar-ul-Aman after
furnishing personal surety bond and then
went with the said clerk namely Arif to his
house, where Nikah was performed with
Wafaq Ahmed on 29" April, 2020. After
marriage her husband went to Rawalpindi
and never returned to home. That she was
residing in the house of said Arif in his
house in a village, where she came into
knowledge that the said Wafaq Ahmed was
not of sound mind, thus she decided to get
divorce and said Arif ensured her that he
would marry her somewhere else, therefore,
she obtained divorce from Wafaq Ahmed,
but said Arif did not fulfil his commitment
and also not sent her to Dar-ul-Aman and

then one day in the absence of his wife, he
raped her, due to which she got pregnant.
That the said Arif threatened her for dire
consequences, thereafter, she came to Dar-
ul-Aman, being safe there, she requested for
legal proceedings against the accused. In the
meanwhile, complainant had given birth a
child, she also stated that the said child be
handed over to his real father namely Arif.
Hence, the instant FIR.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for
parties as well as learned AG heard and
record available gone through with their
valuable assistance.

3s Meticulous sifting of record in the
light of arguments reflects that the present
accused/petitioners are not charged by the
complainant in the first information report.
In the whole story, the complainant never
uttered a single word regarding involvement
of the present accused/petitioners. The main
accused nominated in the present case is one
Arif.

6. | Onrecord there is copy of Nikahnama
showing therein the said Arif as bridegroom,

while the complainant has been shown as
bride. The accused/petitioner Syed Imtiaz
Hussain Shah Nikah Khwan is shown to be
Nikahkhawan of the said alleged Nikah,
while the other accused/petitioners namely
Muhammad Aslam and Muhammad Ashraf
are mentioned as witnesses of the said
Nikha, therefore, prima facie section 376
PPC is not applicable to the case of present
accused/petitioners, while the punishment
provided for remaining sections of law i.e
419, 420, 466, 471 PPC does not fall within
the prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.
P.C. The validity of said Nikahnama would
be seen at the time of trial as at the bail stage
only tentative assessment of record is
required and deeper appreciation is not

permissible.

7. In Zafar Iqbal’s case (2009 SCMR
1488), a larger Bench of the august Apex
Court has explicitly expressed the principles
for considering the grant of bail, where
offences do not fall within the prohibitory
clause of section 497 Cr.P.C. The said
principles have consistently been followed

by the Honourable Supreme Court, as it has
been held in Riaz Jafar Natiq’s case (2011

SCMR 1708) that:

“Thus keeping in view the law laid
down in the case of Zafar Iqbal v.
Muhammad Anwar and others
(2009 SCMR 1488) ordaining that
where a case falls within non-
prohibitory clause the concession
of granting bail must be
favourably considered and should
only be declined in exceptional
cases. We do not find this to be a
case where it should be refused as
an exception. Thus, this petition is
converted into an appeal and the
same is allowed and, resultantly,
the petitioner is admitted to bail
subject to furnishing bail bond in
the sum of Rs. 1,00,000 (Rupees
one hundred thousand only) with
two sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of the
learned trial Court.”

Similarly, the august Apex Court, in
unequivocal terms held in Muhammad

Tanveer’s case (PLD 2017 SC 733) that:

“Once this Court has held in
categorical terms that grant of bail
in offences not falling within the
prohibitory limb of section 497,
Cr.P.C. shall be a rule and refusal
shall be an exception then, the
Courts of the country should follow
this principle in its letter and spirit
because principles of law
enunciated by this Court are
constitutionally binding on all
Courts throughout the country
including the Special Tribunals
and Special Courts.

Although in some special laws there
are specific provisions, limiting the
scope of section 497, Cr.P.C.
however, this Court in many
reported cases has laid down
binding principles that the
provisions of section 497, CrP.
shall not be ignored even in those
cases and the guiding
provisions/principles given therein
shall always be kept in mind while
considering the grant or refusal of
bail.

In this regard the case of The State
v. Syed Qaim Ali Shah (1992 SCMR
2192) and the famous case of Khan
Asfandyar Wali and others vy.
Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2001
SC 607) are much relevant, where
principle of section 497, Cr.P.C. was
held to be applicable even to such
cases of course subject to slight
limitation.

We expect the Courts below to
adhere to these binding principles in
future and not to act mechanically
in the matter of granting or refusal
of bail because liberty of citizen is
involved in such matters, therefore,
same should not be decided in
vacuum and without proper judicial
approach.”

8. Moreover, it has been held time and
again by the august Supreme Court that bail
does not mean acquittal of accused but only
change of custody from Government
agencies to the sureties, who on furnishing
bonds take responsibility to produce the
accused whenever and wherever required to
be produced. Reliance could be placed on
case reported in 2008 SCMR_807 “Haji
Muhammad Nazir Vs. State”.

9. The observations made hereinabove
are tentative in nature for the disposal of bail
petition and not intended to influence the
mind of trial Court, which is free to appraise
the evidence strictly in accordance with law

and merits of the case. In this regard the
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in Shuaib

Mehmood Butt Vs. Iftikhar-ul-Hag (1996
SCMR 1845) has rendered clear guidance,
which is to the effect that:-

“However we would like to point out in
no certain terms that the observations
made by the High Court in the orders
granting bail and by us in this order are
confined to tentative assessment made
for the purpose of disposal of bail
applications and not intended to
influence the mind of the trial Court,
which is free to appraise the evidence
strictly according to its merits and the
law at the time of disposal of the case,
which of course, needless to say, is the
function of the trial Court”.

10. In view of the above stated facts and
circumstances the case, this Court reached to
the conclusion that the accused/petitioners
have made out their case arguable for the
purpose of bail, therefore, this and connected
bail petition are allowed. They be released
on bail, provided they furnish bail bonds in
the sum of Rs. 2,00,000/- (two lacs) with two
sureties, each (in respect of each accused) in
the like amount to the satisfaction to learned
Tlaqa Sudicial/Duty Magistrate, who shall
ensure that the sureties are local reliable and
men of means.
