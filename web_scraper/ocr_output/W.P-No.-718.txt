WIQAR AHMAD, J.- Our this order is directed to
dispose of W.P. No. 718-M of 2019 filed by the
petitioner against the respondents under Article
199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of
Pakistan, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as
“Constitution”) as well as connected Criminal
Revision No.105-M of 2019 filed by the
complainant/petitioner Mohammad Shoaib
against respondents under section 39 of the
Criminal Procedure Code 1898 (hereinafter

referred to as “Code”).

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
2. Muhammad Sohaib lodged a report
to Imran Khan SHO PS Talash, at emergency
ward of Shamshi Khan hospital Talash, alleging
therein that he along with his brothers namely
Muhammad Iqbal, Said Abdullah and Bahadar
Zaib and other nephews had been cutting wheat
crop. standing in their lands known as
“Khwar Patai”’, when the accused namely
Habib-ul-Hassan alias Malik and Said Hassan
both sons of Said Karam appeared duly armed
with firearms and started firing at them. Brother
of the complainant namely Bahadar Zaib was
stated to have received an injury as a result of the
firing made by Habib-ul-Hassan while rest of the
complainant-party escaped un-hurt. The accused
were stated to have escaped from the place of
occurrence. A dispute over some landed property
was stated to be the motive for the commission of
the alleged offence and both the accused were
accordingly charged by the complainant in his
first report. FIR No.47 dated 23.05.2019 was
registered under sections 302,324,34 PPC at

police station Talash District Lower Dir against

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
on'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
the two accused namely Habib-ul-Hassan and

Said Hassan sons of Said Karam.

3. Investigation in the case was in
progress that the complainant filed an application
under section 22-A of the Code before the learned
Sessions Judge in the capacity of Iustice of Peace
for issuance of direction to the Investigating
Officer for substituting the name of
“Said Hassan” with “Karim Hassan” in the
record of the criminal case. Comments of the
SHO concermed were called by the learned Justice
of Peace, which were accordingly submitted.
Vide order dated 01.06.2019 of the learned
Justice of Peace, the application of the
complainant was accepted and directions were
issued to the Investigating Officer for making the
necessary correction of names as prayed for by
the complainant in his application filed under
section 22-A of the Code. Feeling aggrieved from
the said order the petitioner has invoked the
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court, through
the instant petition, brought for the grant of the

following relief:

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
4

“ It is, therefore, prayed that on acceptance
of this petition, the impugned order dated
01.06.2019 be declared unlawful, void-ab-
initio, lack baking of law be set aside.”

Likewise, the complainant/petitioner
Mohammad Shoaib has filed ‘the connected
criminal revision against subsequent order of the
learned trial Court dated 12.10.2019, whereby the
learned Court framed charge against one of
accused namely Habib-ul-Hassan and left the
other accused Karim-ul-Hassan , due to existence
of an ad-interim injunctive of this Court. He has

prayed for following relief;

ci

It is therefore most humbly prayed
that on acceptance of the criminal revision
the impugned order dated 12.10.2019 may
kindly be set aside and trial. Court be
directed to proceed with case on merits by
Sraming charge against both the accused.

Any other remedy deemed appropriate
and just in circumstances of the case may
also be granted in favour of petitioner.

4. Learned counsel for. the petitioner
submitted during the course of his arguments that
Said Hassan and Karim Hassan were two
brothers. Said Hassan was stated to have been
living in Saudi Arabia at the time of occurrence,
who was wrongly alleged to have committed the
offence and the FIR was registered. The
complainant came to know about the said fact

subsequently and then contrived the device for

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
substitution of the accused by way of filing the
application under section 22-A of the Code for
correction of the name. He further added that the
learned Justice of Peace while allowing the
application could not realize that the application
had been filed with malafide intention and
substitution of the name of accused was sought in
order to save the case of the prosecution from

collapsing altogether.

5. Learned counsel for the complainant/
petitioner of the connected criminal revision
submitted in rebuttal that in-fact it was a result of
a clerical mistake that the word “Said” was used
instead of “Karim” in the FIR and that the
complainant had repeatedly requested the local
police for making the necessary correction but
same had not been accepted, therefore the
complainant felt compelled to avail the remedy
under section 22-A of the Code. He further added
that the order had been passed by the forum
below according to law and did not suffer from
any illegality. The learned Astt: A.G.. also
supported the private counsel for the complainant.

Nawab (D.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
6. We have heard arguments of learned

counsel for the parties and perused the record.

7. Perusal of record reveals that the
investigation in the case has been completed and
complete challan has also been submitted before
the trial Court. The trial Court has also taken
cognizance of the matter and the case was fixed
for framing of charge on 12.10.2019, when
charge could not be framed against one of the
accused namely Karim-ul-Hassan due to an
interim order passed in the instant proceedings
but charge was framed against the other
co-accused namely MHabib-ul-Hassan on
12.10.2019 by the Court of learned Sessions

Judge Dir Lower at Timergara.

8. The net effect of the filing of the
application under section 22-A of the Code and
order of the learned Justice of Peace, is no more
than the fact that the complainant has come up
with a second version which has been made part
of the record of the investigation and complete
challan has been submitted in the Court according
to the second version of the complainant. The

trial Court has taken cognizance of the matter and

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
7

the case is under trial. The burden of proof,
without any doubt, lies on the complainant and
the prosecution to prove not only the commission
of offence but the fact that it was a bonafide
mistake on their part to have named Said Hassan
instead of Karim Hassan in their first report, as
well as the other pieces of evidences gathered
during the process of investigation. It would have
much preferable option that the Investigating
Officer would have been directed to record
statement of the complainant and then proceeded
with the investigation accordingly, but it has not
been done. Complete challan has been submitted
and now the case has landed in the learned trial
Court and in the midst of the process of trial.
This Court, in such a situation is feeling

handicapped for the following reasons;

a. It cannot resolve at this stage the factual
controversy whether the accused Said
Hassan had been named in the first report
by the complainant due to an innocent
mistake on his part or substitution of name
was sought due to malafide intention of
bolstering the case of prosecution
unnaturally after finding that one of the
accused named by them had been living
abroad at the time of occurrence;

b. The setting aside of the order of the learned
Justice of Peace and issuance of fresh
instructions to the Investigating Agency

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
shall amount to interference in the process
of investigation, which has been held by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, in
successive judgments to be out of the
permissible exercise of powers vested in
this Court by Article 199 of the
Constitution.

Regarding the first issue, it has
already been settled by the Hon’ble Apex Court
that a High Court cannot resolve factual
controversies in exercise of powers under Article
199 of the Constitution. In the case of “Amir
Jamal_v/s_Malik_Zahoor-ul-Haq_and_others”
reported as “2011 SCMR_ 1023”, the Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan held that the scope of
Article 199 was dependent on the questions
which are devoid of factual controversy. In the
case of “Fida Hussain _and_another_v/s_Mst.
Saiga_and_ others” reported as “2011 SCMR
1990”, the Hon’ble Apex Court held that the
High Court was not to resolve the disputed
question of facts in exercise of constitutional
jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution.
This Court is partly avoiding to resolve the
factual controversy because of the settled
principle of law, as discussed above but mainly,

due to the vacuum which is existing at the

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
moment in the case in hand, in absence of
evidence before it. The learned trial Court would
therefore be in much better position to resolve the

said controversy after recording of evidence.

9. As far as second aspect of the case in
hand is concerned, any affirmative order from this
Court would require getting the investigation of
the case topsy-turvy. By doing that, this Court
would be intruding in the spare of investigation
which course is not appropriate for this Court.
The Hon’ble Apex Court has repeatedly held that
the High Court shall not exercise its writ
jurisdiction for causing interference in the police

investigation. In the case of “Shahnaz Begum v/s

The Hon’ble Judges of the High Court of Sind

and Baluchistan” reported as “PLD 1971
Supreme Court 677”, the Hon’ble Apex Court

held as follows;

“So far as the Constitution of 1962 is concerned
the powers of the High Courts are such as have
been described under the provisions of Article 98
of the Constitution. They are those which have
been conferred on them by the Constitution itself
or by any law and apart from them they have no
other powers, because, Article 130 of the same
Constitution provided that "no Court shall have
any jurisdiction that is not conferred on it by this
Constitution or by or under the law." Under this
Constitution, a High Court has been given the
power of judicial review of executive actions by
Article 98 in certain specified circumstances but

Nawab (D.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
10

even in such a case the High Court cannot move
suo motu for, it is specifically provided in each of
the sub clauses (a), (b) and (c) of clause (2) of
Article 98 that only "on the application of an
aggrieved party or of any person," the High
Court may make the orders or issue the directions
therein specified. It is clear, therefore, that under
Article 98, there is no scope for any suo motu
action by the High Court. The High Court has
also no power of supervision or control over
investigating agencies for the power of
superintendence which is given by Article 102 of
the Constitution is only in respect of "all other
Courts that are subordinate to it." This position,
as already, pointed out, is not also disputed by the
learned Advocate- General for the Province of
Sind.”

In the case of “Brig. (Retd.) Imtiaz
Ahmad v/s Govt: of Pakistan through Secretary

Interior Division & others” reported as “1994
SCMR 2142”, the Hon’ble Apex Court after an
extensive survey of the existing case law and
examination of relevant jurisprudential principles

held as follows;

“This Court held, therefore, "that the continued
control over the investigation exercised by the
Court as in this case was prejudicial to the
accused and detrimental to the fairness of the
procedure apart from being without jurisdiction".

18. The significance of the above-quoted
observations lies in the fact that one of the
declarations sought by the petitioner was to direct
the Government "to place all incriminating
material before the High Court to enable it to
exercise judicial review to ensure that the
criminal proceedings are not- being initiated for
reasons and proposes extraneous to statute". In
other words what the petitioner wanted the High
Court to do was to assume the role of
Investigator. This could obviously not be done,
for the authority to register and investigate a
criminal case in law vests in the police and not in
Court. We must hold, therefore, that the learned
judges in the High Court were eminently justified
is not assuming that role.”

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
11
In the case of “Ghulam Sarwar

Zardari v/s Piyar Ali alias Piyaro and another”

reported as “2010 SCMR 624”, the Hon’ble Apex
Court held that if investigation was not in bad
faith and out of personal motives either to hurt the
accused or to benefit oneself or in colourable
exercise of powers not authorized by law, under
which an action is taken then it comes within the
scope of malafide, and in such a case corrective
measures may be taken by the High Courts. In the
said case also the matter has not been left open
ended but the limits of exercise of powers by the
High Court in respect of investigation has been

defined clearly in the following terms;

Investigation can be corrected and necessary
orders can be passed, if aggrieved party alleges
and proves one or other of the following
conditions:---

(1) Investigation initiated beyond jurisdiction of
investigating agencies;

(2) Investigation initiated with mala fide
intention;

(i) in bad faith out of personal motives either to
hurt the person against whom action is taken or
to benefit oneself;

(ii) in colourable exercise of powers;

(iii) not authorized by law under which action is
taken;

(iv) action taken in fraud of law; and
(vy) abuse of process of law.

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Abmad
12

Where application against investigation does not
show any of the above mentioned facts alleged
and proved, then High Court under constitutional
jurisdiction has no jurisdiction to interfere with
investigation or pass any order.

The case in hand does not even fall in
any of the categories mentioned therein. The
complainant or the accused have not attributed any
malafide to the Investigating Agency, nor has any
such malafide visible in the case. It was the
complainant who had admittedly named the
accused Said Hassan which he wanted to be
replaced with the accused namely Karim Hassan.
The Investigating Agency has ‘nowhere been
attributed any malafide nor has: want of their
jurisdiction been pleaded or asserted by any of the
party at any stage. The effect of setting aside of the
order of learned Justice of Peace, at this stage,
would no doubt necessitate the ordering of
retracing the steps taken in the investigation of the
case, which according to the law settled by the
Hon’ble Apex Court, cannot be deemed appropriate

in the circumstances of the case in hand.

10. The strong factual controversy
mentioned above has been existing in the case in
hand and that also arises out of investigation of the
case, this Court, therefore do not -feel inclined to.

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad.
13

interfere in the said affair and leave it entirely to the
determination of the learned trial Court. The
learned trial Court will be in much better position
to resolve the instant controversy along with the
other matters involved in the case at the time of
giving its final verdict, as by then it will have the
benefit of the evidence recorded in the case, as well
as various pleas raised by the parties during the

course of trial.

j1. For what has been discussed above,
the constitutional petition No. 718-M of 2019 is

hereby dismissed.

12. Criminal Revision No. 105-M of 2019
is also disposed of in terms that since the interim
order due to which charge could not be framed
against the accused namely Karimi-ul-Hassan, has
vanished with the dismissal of the writ petition,
therefore the learned trial Court shall frame charge

against the accused and shall proceed according to

law.
