JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.- Petitioner

Abdullah Khan alias Amanat, seeks bail in case FIR No.375
dated 23.06.2015, registered under sections 324/427/34
PPC, in Police Station Prang, District Charsadda, wherein he
alongwith co-accused Faqir Hussain and Ihsan Ullah, is
charged for attempting at the lives of complainant Behram

Khan and PWs Sajjad Ahmad and Wagas by firing at them

ineffectively.
2. Arguments heard and record perused.
3. None has sustained any injury in the incident.

Co-accused Faqir Hussain has already been granted bail by
this Court vide order dated 27.08.2015 in Cr.Misc.BA
No.1368-P/2015. The case of the petitioner is not on
different footing from that of the petitioner Faqir Hussain,
therefore, on the rule of consistency he is also entitled to

concession of bail.

4. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioner is directed to be released on bail
provided he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/-
with two local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the
like amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD concerned.

5. Before parting with the judgment, I deem it
appropriate to mention here that co-accused Faqir Hussain,
whose role is identical to that of the petitioner, has been
granted bail by this Court. The ground of applicability of
rule of consistency to the case of the petitioner has
specifically been agitated by the petitioner in his bail
petition before the learned lower Court/ Additional Sessions
Judge-V, Charsadda, but I do not find any findings of the
learned lower court on the said ground, rather the learned
lower court by passing a routine cyclostyle order regarding
rejection of bail, rejected the bail application of the
petitioner, without caring and following the judgment of this
Court. According to the Constitution, the judgments of the
superior Courts are binding on the subordinate Courts and
are to be followed as precedents strictly in cases having
identical facts and circumstances, deviation wherefrom, on
one hand, would be against the very spirit of the

Constitution, while on the other hand, it would increase the

burden of cases on the racks of the superior Courts. If the
learned lower Court was satisfied to decline bail to the
petitioner, at least it should have differentiated his case from
that of co-accused, but no such findings have been given in
bail refusing order. Apart from the instant case, I have
observed this practices of the subordinate judiciary in so
many other cases, that the judgments of the superior Court
are not honoured as precedents in cases having identical
facts and circumstances as well as even in the same cases
where the role of the accused are one and the same.
Therefore, in the interest of justice and keeping in view
mandate of the Constitution of the Country, it is expected
that such illegal exercise shall not be repeated in the future.
6. The Additional Registrar (Judicial) of this
Court is directed to send copy of this judgment to
Miss Ambareen Navid, learned Additional Sessions
Judge-V, Charsadda as well as learned Sessions Judge,
Charsadda who shall circulate the same among the other
Additional Sessions Judges, of the District, for future
guidance.

7. For what has been discussed above, Suo motu
notice given to accused Shakir stands withdrawn. He is
admitted to bail on already existing bail bonds, on merits.
Since this court has already directed expeditious
conclusion of trial while dealing with the bail petition of
co-accused Farman, therefore, office is directed to send the
record to the quarter concerned within two days, positively.
