Benefit of Section: 382-B Cr.P.C. was also

3. Machinery of law was set into motion by Karamat Ali
(complainant/PW-5) by moving application (Ex.PD) to Muhammad Nawaz,
ASI/D.O.(PW-9) in Police Station: Wahando, District Gujranwala while
mentioning therein that he is resident of Shadi Khan Wala and is a cultivator
by profession; on 16.07.2011, petty quarrel of brother of complainant
namely Amanat Ali took place with Sajid, Asif alias Asad, residents of the
deh, who had extended threat that they will teach him a lesson due to
quarrel; on 17.07.2011 at about 7:30 a.m., complainant and his brother
Amanat Ali were proceeding to their fields for working, when they were at a
little distance from fields, accused persons namely Sajid armed with
A4-bore rifle, Asif alias Asad (both sons of Liaqat Ali) armed with
Kalashnikov, Asad Ali son of Basharat armed with Kalashnikov, Riaz son of
Mehar Din armed with .223 bore rifle, Irshad alias Mehar Din armed with
8mm rifle, Shaukat Ali son of Mehar Din armed with Kalashnikov, Javed
son of Ashiq armed with Kalashnikov, Jamshaid son of Mehar Sadiq armed
with Kalashnikov, who had already waylaid in furtherance of their common
object, started raising lalkaras to teach a lesson for quarrelling and said that
they should not be left alive; Sajid son of Liagat Ali made straight fire shot
with rifle at Amanat Ali, which landed at front of his neck, who fell on the
ground and died at the spot; the complainant saved his life while laying in
the watercourse (US); co-accused persons remained firing with their

respective weapons; occurrence was witnessed by Muhammad Azam,
Crl. Appeal No.245/2016 & 3
Crl. Appeal No 409/2016

Nawaz and Zulifqar Ali, who were working in nearby fields; occurrence was
committed at the abetment/conspiracy of Basharat Ali, Muhammad Arshad,
Muhammad Aslam, Nasir Mehmood and conspiracy hatched by them was
heard by Mustafa and Iftikhar Ahmad a few days before the occurrence.
Motive behind the occurrence was landed dispute.

4. After completion of investigation, report under Section: 173 Cr.P.C.
was submitted in the Court; appellants along with co-accused were formally
charge sheeted but they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial whereupon
prosecution evidence was summoned; prosecution during trial examined
twelve (12) witnesses, out of which, medical evidence was furnished by Dr.
Salman Kazmi, Medical Officer (PW-1), ocular account was furnished by
Karamat Ali (complainant/PW-5) and Zulifqar Ali (PW-6), Istikhar Ahmad
(PW-7) and Ghulam Mustafa (PW-8) are witnesses of abetment/conspiracy
whereas detail of investigation of the case was deposed by Ghulam Ali,
Inspector/Investigating Officer (PW-11); prosecution after giving up
Muhammad Azam, Basharat Ali and Muhammad Nawaz (PWs) as being
unnecessary and tendering report of Chemical Examiner (Ex.PN), report of
Serologist (Ex.PO) and report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Ex.PP)
closed its evidence; after recording of prosecution evidence, accused persons
(appellants) were examined under Section: 342 Cr.P.C. but they refuted the
allegations levelled against them; they neither opted to appear as their own
witnesses under Section: 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence in their
defence.

Trial Court after conclusion of trial has convicted and sentenced the
appellants as mentioned above through the impugned judgment dated:
30.01.2016.

5. Learned counsel for the appellants, while opening the arguments,
submit that conviction recorded against and sentence awarded to the
appellants through impugned judgment are against the ‘law and facts’ and
result of non-reading/misreading of evidence; further submit that
prosecution has failed to prove its case against the appellants through cogent
and reliable evidence. In such perspective, learned counsel finally prays for

acquittal of the appellants.
Crl. Appeal No.245/2016 & 4
Crl. Appeal No .409/2016

6. Conversely, learned Deputy Prosecutors General and learned counsel
for the complainant submit that prosecution has proved its case against the
appellants up to hilt, therefore, their appeals are liable to be dismissed.

7. Arguments advanced pro and contra have been heard and
available record perused.

8. As per own case of prosecution , Sajid (co-accused/still proclaimed
offender) fired shot and caused single/fatal firearm injury to Amanat Ali
(deceased of the case), however, present appellants neither caused any injury
to the deceased or anybody else in the case nor even attempted to do so
rather allegation of ineffective firing has been alleged against them. Section
148 PPC speaks regarding punishment for rioting armed with deadly weapon
and same is hereby reproduced:-

“148. Rioting armed with deadly weapon.- Whoever is guilty of rioting,
being armed with deadly weapon or with anything which, used as a
weapon of offence, is likely to cause death, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three
years, or with fine, or with both. ”

(emphasis added)
whereas “rioting” has been defined under Section: 146 PPC, which is also
reproduced for ready reference:-

“146. Rioting.- Whenever force or violence is used by an unlawful
assembly, or by any member thereof in prosecution of the common
object of such assembly, every member of such assembly is guilty of the
offence of rioting.”

(emphasis added)

and “unlawful assembly” has been defined under Section: 141 PPC, which
reads as follows:-

“141. Unlawful assembly.- An assembly of five or more persons is
designated an “unlawful assembly” if the common object of the persons
composing that assembly is;

First. To overawe by criminal force, or show of criminal force,
the Central or any Provincial Government or Legislature, or any public
servant in the exercise of the lawful power of such public servant; or

Second. To resist the execution of any law, or of any legal
process; or

Third. To commit any mischief or criminal trespass, or other
offence, or

Fourth. By means of criminal force, or show of criminal force to
any person to take or obtain possession of any property or to deprive
any person of the enjoyment of a right of way, of the use of water or
Crl. Appeal No.245/2016 & 5
Crl. Appeal No .409/2016

other incorporeal right of which he is in possession or enjoyment, or to
enforce any right or supposed right; or

Fifth. By means of criminal force, or show of criminal force, to
compel any person to do what he is not legally bound to do or to omit to
do what he is legally entitled to do.

Explanation. An assembly which was not unlawful when it assembled,
may subsequently become an unlawful assembly.”
(emphasis added)

Perusal of the aforementioned provisions of law makes it crystal clear that if
“rioting” is committed by the accused persons while armed with deadly
weapons then they are to be punished under Section: 148 PPC and as per
Section: 146 PPC, “rioting” is use of force or violence by an unlawful
assembly or by any member thereof in prosecution of the common object
of said assembly and it is equally important to mention here that as per
Section: 141 PPC, assembly is designated as “unlawful assembly” if same
has been constituted for achieving “common object” mentioned in five
clauses mentioned therein; Hence, “common object” is necessary ingredient
for invoking Section: 148 PPC; in this regard, case of “LIAQUAT versus
THE STATE” (PLD 1996 Supreme Court 219) can be advantageously
referred and its relevant portion from Page No. 222 is hereby reproduced: -

“A plain reading of these provisions will show that an accused
cannot be convicted under section 148, P.P.C. unless he is found to
be member of unlawful assembly using force or violence in
prosecution of the common object of such assembly.”

(emphasis added)
cases of “ABUL HUSSAIN AND OTHERS versus The STATE”

(1968 P Cr. J 300), “THE STATE through Advocate-General,

Balochistan, Quetta versus Jamadar MUHAMMAD KHAN _ and
another” (2005 P Cr. L J 1442), “NAZIR_ AHMED and others versus

THE STATE and_ others” (PLD 2005 Karachi 18) and “HABIB
AHMAD and _ others versus THE STATE” (2020 P Cr. L J 1185)
[Lahore] can also be safely referred on the subject.

In this case, it has been rightly held by trial court for the valid reasons
in paragraph No.17 of the judgment that prosecution could not establish

common object; relevant portion of said paragraph is hereby reproduced:-

“---yet it is an admitted fact that no fire made by the remaining accused
present in the court hit the deceased or complainant, hence prosecution
Crl. Appeal No.245/2016 & 6
Crl. Appeal No .409/2016

was required to prove that they acted in prosecution of their common
object. The entire evidence produced by the prosecution is scanned,
which could not establish that present accused gathered at the place of
occurrence for commission of murder. If they gathered for committing
murder then complainant and other PWs were also at their mercy and
they should not have been spared. It is also not proved that present
accused made straight firing upon deceased or complainant. Besides
above, deceased received only single fire shot, which prima facie

established that common object in this case is missing. ”
(emphasis added)

Therefore, conviction of the appellants under Section: 148 PPC raises eye

brows as well as is a question mark.

Apart from above, it is noteworthy here that as per own case of
prosecution, Asif alias Asad, Irshad, Muhammad Riaz, Shaukat Ali,
Jamshaid Ahmad, Asad Ali (since proclaimed offender) and Javed (since
acquitted) have been given one and the same/identical role of making
ineffective firing, however, Javed (mentioned above) has already been
acquitted and his acquittal has neither been challenged by the State nor by
the complainant as confirmed by learned Deputy Prosecutors General as
well as by learned counsel for the complainant. Therefore, now strong and
independent corroboration is required to uphold the conviction and sentence
awarded to the present appellants. It is relevant to mention here that for the
genuine reasons mentioned in paragraph No.15 of the impugned judgment,
trial court has held that prosecution remained fail to prove the motive against
present appellants; said paragraph is hereby reproduced:-

“15. As far as motive part of the occurrence is concerned, it is
admitted by the complainant that accused present in the court are
neither vendors not vendees of the land in dispute. It is also an admitted
fact that complainant did not produce any witness of prior occurrence,
which allegedly took place on 16.07.2011 between deceased and Sajid
etc. No overwhelming evidence regarding motive part has been brought

on record. Hence it is concluded that prosecution has not proved
motive part of the occurrence against present accused persons. ”

(emphasis added)

Though learned Deputy Prosecutors General as well as learned counsel for
the complainant emphasis that corroboration is available in the form of
recoveries effected from Irshad, Shaukat Ali and Jamshaid Ahmad
(appellants), however, it is worth mentioning here that Kalashnikov (P.4)

recovered from Shaukat Ali (appellant) and Kalashnikov (P.6) recovered
Crl. Appeal No.245/2016 & 7
Crl. Appeal No 409/2016

from Jamshaid Ahmad (appellant) were sent to Punjab Forensic Science
Agency, Lahore and as per report of said agency (Exh.PP), said both
weapons were though in working condition yet empties secured from the
place of occurrence and sent to Punjab Forensic Science Agency for
comparison, did not match with said weapons. In such perspective, report of
Punjab Forensic Science Agency regarding mere working capability of said
weapons cannot provide any corroboration to the case of prosecution against
both these appellants i.e. Shaukat Ali and Jamshaid Ahmad; in this regard,
cases of “MUHAMMAD MANSHA versus The STATE” (2018 SCMR
772) and “IMTIAZ alias TAJI and another versus The STATE and
others” (2020 SCMR 287) can be safely referred.

Now coming to the case of Irshad (appellant), as per application for
registration of case (Ex.PD) and FIR (Exh.PD/1), he was armed with .8mm
rifle which he allegedly used in the occurrence and same is the
position/stance in the statements of Karamat Ali (complainant/PW-5) and
Zulifqar Ali (eye witness/PW-6) recorded during trial of the case, however,
8mm rifle was not recovered from him rather as per case of prosecution,
.12-bore shotgun was recovered from him. So, at the maximum, it can be
said that firearm weapon .12-bore shotgun was recovered from Irsahd
(appellant) but since use of .12-bore shotgun was not claimed in the
application moved for registration of the case (Exh.PD) and in the FIR
(Exh.PD/1) as well as in the statements of complainant and eye witness
recorded during trial of the case, therefore, recovery of said gun is of no
avail to the prosecution for the purpose of having corroboration. Though
according to the report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Ex.PP), two out
of four empties of .12-bore shotgun cartridge cases sent to Punjab Forensic
Science Agency have matched with the aforesaid shotgun yet it is own case
of prosecution that Irshad (appellant) was arrested in this case on
21.07.2011; in this regard relevant portion of the statement of Ghulam Ali,
Inspector/Investigating Officer of the case (PW-11) is hereby reproduced:-

“On 21.07.11, I arrested Shaukat Ali, Irshad and Jamshaid...”’.
whereas empties were admittedly sent to Punjab Forensic Science Agency

on 30.07.2011 i.e. after arrest of Irshad (appellant) and in this regard
Crl. Appeal No.245/2016 & 8
Crl. Appeal No .409/2016

relevant portion of the statement of Nadeem Akhtar, ASI/Moharrar of the
Police Station (PW-12) is hereby reproduced:-

“On 30.07.11, I handed over the sealed parcel of crime empties to Abdul
Razzaq constable 2354-C in order to deposit the same in the office of
PFSA, Lahore intact.”

Statement of Abdul Razzaq 2354-C (PW-10) can also be referred in this
regard, which is reproduced as under:-

“On 30.07.2011, said Moharrar handed over me a sealed parcel said to
contain crime-empties for deposit in the office of FSL, Lahore. On the
same day I deposited the parcel in the said office intact. On the same day
1.0. recorded my statement U/S 161 Cr.P.C.”

Hence, when empties were sent to Punjab Forensic Science Agency after
arrest of Irshad (appellant), then report of said Agency regarding matching
of empties with allegedly recovered shotgun from Irshad (appellant) is
inconsequential and in this regard cases of “MUHAMMAD ILYAS versus
MUHAMMAD ABID alias BILLA and others” (2017 SCMR 54) and

“ee

Nawab SIRAJ ALI and others versus THE STATE through AG.
Singh” (2023 SCMR 16) can be safely referred. Therefore, aforementioned

recovery cannot provide any corroboration to the case of prosecution against

said appellant.

Undeniably no weapon of offence was recovered from Asif alias Asad
and Muhammad Riaz (appellants). In above scenario, it can be safely
concluded that when neither common object nor motive could be established.
by the prosecution against the present appellants and even recovery of the
weapons from Irshad, Shaukat Ali and Jamshaid Ahmed (appellants) is
inconsequential, then nothing is available on record to provide any
corroboration to the case of prosecution against the present appellants. By
now it is well settled that, if same/identical role has been alleged against
more than one accused and anyone out of them has been acquitted, then in
absence of the strong corroboration, other accused persons against whom
also similar allegation was levelled by the prosecution, cannot be convicted
and sentenced and in this regard cases of “Mst. SUGHRA BEGUM and

another_versus QAISER PERVEZ and _ others” (2015 SCMR 1142),
“IMTIAZ alias TAJ versus The STATE and others” (2018 SCMR 344),

“HAROON SHAFIQUE versus The STATE and others” (2018 SCMR
Crl. Appeal No.245/2016 & 9
Crl. Appeal No 409/2016

2118), “MUNIR_ AHMAD and another versus The STATE and others”
(2019 SCMR 79), “ALTAF HUSSAIN versus The STATE” (2019 SCMR
274), “LIAQAT ALI and others versus The STATE and others” (2021
SCMR 455), “MUHAMMAD IDREES and another versus The STATE
and_ others” (2021 SCMR 612) and “PERVAIZ KHAN and _ another
versus The STATE” (2022 SCMR 393) can be advantageously referred.

9. Nutshell of the above discussion is that prosecution has been failed to
prove its case against the appellants beyond shadow of reasonable doubt and

in such state of affairs, there is no need to discuss defence version.

10. In view of what has been discussed above, Crl. Appeal No. 245/2016,
filed by Asif alias Asad, Irshad, Muhammad Riaz and Shaukat Ali
(appellants) and Crl. Appeal No.409/2016 filed by Jamshaid Ahmad
(appellant) are allowed/accepted; conviction recorded and sentence awarded to
aforementioned appellants through impugned judgment dated: 30.01.2016
passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Gujranwala/trial Court, are
hereby set aside. Resultantly, Asif alias Asad, Irshad, Muhammad Riaz,
Shaukat Ali and Jamshaid Ahmad (appellants) are acquitted of the charge.
All the appellants are on bail, as during pendency of their appeals (mentioned
above), execution of their sentence was suspended vide order
dated: 18.10.2016 passed by this Court in Crl. Misc. No.1/2016 of their
respective appeals (mentioned above), therefore, their sureties stand

discharged from their all liabilities.
