2. Being aggrieved by the judgment of the learned trial
court, Shahbaz, appellant has assailed his conviction and sentence
through filing Crl. Appeal No.1010-J/2015 while learned trial court
forwarded Murder Reference No.190/2015 for confirmation or
other wise sentence of death inflicted upon convict in terms of Section
374, Cr.P.C. As both the matters are arising out of one and the same
judgment of the learned trial court, therefore, these are being

disposed off through consolidated judgment.

3. Prosecution story as portrayed in the FIR (Exh.PA/1)
lodged on the statement (Exh.PA) of Noor Muhammad son of Ali
Muhammad, caste Kumhar, (PW-2) is that the complainant is resident
of Ward No.3 Bhowana and earns his livelihood by labour. On
14.07.2011 at 4.30 PM, the complainant along with his daughter
Ghulam Bibi, Faheem son of Noor Muhammad and Abdullah son of
Ghulam Muhammad after having purchased the household articles,
were returning to their house on foot. When they reached in front of
shop of Mansha Bhutta, suddenly, accused (1) Shahbaz armed with
.30 bore pistol, (2) Nawaz armed with .30 bore pistol, (3) Jahangir
having bag of bullets (4) Muhammad Hayyat s/o Muhammad Khan
empty handed reached there. Muhammad Hayyat and Jahangir
Murder Reference No.190/2015 3
Crl. Appeal No.1010-J/2015

accused raised ‘lalkara’ that they will not spare them alive. Shehbaz
accused made successive fire shots upon Mst. Ghulam Bibi hitting her
on her left arm, left flank, in front of chest, belly and left buttock who
fell down. Nawaz accused made pistol fire shot hitting grand-
son/nawasa of the complainant namely Faheem on his left hip
whereas Jahangir and Muhammad Hayyat accused persons raised
‘lalkara’ that if any one stepped forward, would face the dire
consequences. Upon hue and cry raised by the complainant and his
companions, people from the nearby vicinity came out of their houses
and upon seeing them accused persons fled away from the spot by
brandishing their weapons towards grid station. The complainant and
PWs evacuated the injured PWs to the Civil Hospital Bhowana where

Mst. Ghulam Bibi succumbed to the injuries.

Motive behind the occurrence as disclosed in the crime report
was that grand-son of the complainant namely Mobashar contracted
love marriage with Mst. Tahira Bibi daughter of Hayyat accused. Due
to this grudge, accused persons committed murder of Mst. Ghulam

Bibi and also caused injuries to Faheem.

4. After the occurrence, Noor Muhammad,
complainant/PW-2) appeared before Muhammad Afzal, Inspector
(PW-10) was posted as Inspector/Incharge Investigation, Police
Station Bhowana, Chiniot and made his statement (Exh.PA), which
was reduced into writing and after endorsing police karvai the same
was transmitted to Police Station for registration of formal FIR
(Exh.PA/1). Thereafter Investigating Officer prepared injury
statement of injured Faheem (Exh.PK) and sent him under the escort
of Noor Asif 662/C (PW-9) at THQ Hospital, Bhowana for medical
examination. Investigating Officer prepared injury statement of
deceased (Exh.PD), drafted inquest report (Exh.PE) and dispatched
the dead body to mortuary under the escort of Haq Nawaz 143/C
Murder Reference No.190/2015 4
Crl. Appeal No.1010-J/2015

(PW-7). From the spot Investigating Officer secured blood stained
earth vide recovery memo Exh.PB and prepared rough site plan
(Exh.PO).) After postmortem examination last worn clothes of the
deceased blood-stained shalwar (P-1), blood-stained qameez (P-2)
and vest (P-3) were produced before the Investigating Officer, which
he took into possession vide recovery memo Exh.PG. He also took
into possession last worn clothes of the injured Faheem blood-stained
shalwar (P-5), which he took into possession vide recovery memo
Exh.PN. On the direction of Investigating Officer and pointing out of
the PWs, Riaz Ahmad, Draftsman (PW-5) on 20.08.2011 took rough
notes of the place of occurrence and thereafter prepared scaled site
plan (Exh.PF and Exh.PF/1), which was made part of the file.
Thereafter investigation was entrusted to Muhammad Iqbal, S.I (PW-
13), who on 25.07.2014 arrested Shahbaz appellant and obtained his
physical remand. During the course of interrogation in pursuance of
disclosure on 08.08.2014, Shahbaz, appellant led to the recovery .30
bore pistol (P-6), which Investigating Officer took into possession

vide recovery memo Exh.PR.

5. During the course of investigation having found the
appellant guilty, Investigating Officer prepared report under Section
173, Cr.P.C. while placing his name in column No.3, which was sent
to the court of Sessions en-routed through the Illaqa Magistrate as
provided under Section 190(2), Cr.P.C. The learned trial court vide
order dated 28.11.2014 formally charge sheeted the appellant to
which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Prosecution in order to
substantiate its case produced as many as thirteen (13) prosecution

witnesses.

6. Occular account in this case consists of the statements of
the Noor Muhammad complainant (PW-2) and Faheem Ahmad,
injured PW (PW-1). On receipt of complaint, Zafar Iqbal 484/HC

Ghulam Hussain Iqbal (PW-11) medically examined

person.

“7. Alacerated wound, grazing in nature, 5 cm x 1.5
cm into skin deep, left thigh upper most part with
partially inverted margins, common entry and exit
wound. Wound is on the outer aspect of left thigh.

Statements of rest of the prosecution witnesses are formal in nature.

7.

The appellant was examined under Section 342, Cr.P.C;

wherein he refuted the allegations levelled against him in the

prosecution version. He opted neither to appear as his own witness in

terms of Section 340(2), Cr.P.C. nor did he opt to adduce defence

evidence. While replying to the question why this case against him

and why the PWs deposed against him, appellant made the following

deposition: -

“All the PWs are related inter-se and inimical to me. On the
day of occurrence, I was present in the shop of Muhammad
Mansha Bhutta while Ghulam Bibi deceased alongwith an
unknown person came there and made a murderous assault
upon me. I took my defensive measures and I made fire in the
air which hit the roof of the shop of Muhammad Mansha
Bhutta. An unknown person snatched my pistol from me. I tried
to snatch my pistol from the unknown person. He fired on me
which hit Mst. Ghulam Bibi inadvertently. She fell down.
Unknown person fled away from the shop and many shop
keepers attracted on the crime scene. They escorted the injured
Murder Reference No.190/2015 7
Crl. Appeal No.1010-J/2015

Mst. Ghulam Bibi to the THQ Hospital, Bhowana for first aid
where she died. The complainant of the case registered the case
against me and all my male family members along with juvenile
in connivance with the police. Iam innocent.”

8. After hearing the arguments advanced by learned
counsel appearing on behalf of both the parties, the learned trial
court, while evaluating the evidence available on record found
version of the prosecution proved beyond shadow of reasonable
doubt, resulting into conviction of the appellant in the above stated

terms.

9. At the outset learned counsel for the appellant contended
that the impugned judgment has been recorded by the learned trial
court in a slipshod manner without adverting to real facts of the case
and material available on record. Further contended that story
advanced by the prosecution in the crime report does not appeal to
reason. It was vehemently argued that the complainant while
spreading wider-net involved all male members of the family. Learned
counsel contended that while appearing in the witness box, the
prosecution witnesses exaggerated the story. As far as medical
evidence is concerned, it was argued that the same does not
corroborate the prosecution version stricto sensu. Learned counsel
argued that as a matter of fact the appellant was present at the shop
of Mansha Bhutta where the deceased and Faheem injured made
assault upon him and in order to save his life, the appellant exercised
the right of self defence. It was argued that this was the first plea of
the appellant, which was found correct during the course of
investigation. Moreover, during the course of investigation bulk of
prosecution version was found false as except the appellant, rest of
the accused were found innocent. Furthermore they were acquitted of
the charge on the same set of evidence and no appeal against their

acquittal was filed. Learned counsel submitted that although pistol is
Murder Reference No.190/2015 8
Crl. Appeal No.1010-J/2015

stated to have been recovered from the appellant, however , in absence
of any matching report, the same is devoid of legal justification. It was
finally argued that keeping in view the facts and circumstances at the
most case against the appellant attracts the provisions of Section

302(c), PPC.

10. On the other hand, learned Deputy Prosecutor General
assisted by learned counsel for the complainant vehemently opposed
the contentions raised by learned counsel for the appellant with the
submissions that the appellant is duly named in the promptly lodged
FIR with his specific role of inflicting injuries on the person of
deceased, which proved fatal. Contended that both the prosecution
witnesses of occular account fully supported the prosecution case on
minute details. Further argued that Faheem (PW-1) had received
firearm injury during the occurrence, therefore, his presence at the
place of occurrence at the relevant time could not be doubted. It was
argued by the learned Law Officer that medical evidence fully
supports the prosecution version on minute details. Contended that
soon after the occurrence, the appellant became fugitive from law and
after his arrest, pistol was recovered on his pointing out, which
establishes his link with the occurrence. Learned counsel contended
that the appellant had committed the occurrence with strong motive.
Moreover, during the course of investigation the appellant was found
guilty as such his name was placed in column No.3 of the report
prepared under Section 173, Cr.P.C. It was lastly argued that in view
of overwhelming incriminating material available on record to saddle
the appellant with the liability, the learned trial court was rightly
justified in recording conviction against the appellant. Learned
counsel for the complainant when confronted that whether sentence
passed by the learned trial court commensurates with the facts and

circumstances of the case, he frankly concedes that from the material
Murder Reference No.190/2015 9
Crl. Appeal No.1010-J/2015

available on record provisions of Section 302(b), PPC, are not made

out.

11. We have heard the arguments advanced from both sides
and perused the record with the able assistance of learned counsel for
the appellant, learned counsel for the complainant, as well as, learned

Deputy Prosecutor General.

12. It is an established principle of law that each criminal
case has its own peculiar facts and circumstances and the same
seldom coincide with each other on salient features. In the case in
hand the occurrence is stated to have taken place on 14.07.2011 at
about 4:30 p.m. (after noon) in front of shop of one Mansha Bhutta
within the territorial jurisdiction of Police Station Bhowana while the
matter was reported to the police at 5:40 p.m. whereas; inter se
distance between the place of occurrence and the Police Station is
1/2-KMs. As far as the place of occurrence, time of occurrence and
presence of the appellant, as well as, deceased is concerned, that is
not denied by both sides. However the only question, which requires
determination by this Court, is mode and manner of occurrence as on

this aspect stance of both sides is contrary to each other.

13. Admittedly the place of occurrence is the shop of Mansha
Bhutta. The prosecution version as portrayed in the crime report is
that the complainant along with Faheem (PW-1) and Mst. Ghulam
Bibi (deceased) after purchasing articles from bazaar were heading
towards their house and when they reached near the shop of Mansha
Bhutta, the appellant along with other co-accused made assault upon
them and on the raising of lalkara by Muhammad Hayat and
Jahangir, the appellant, one after the other, made repeated fire shots
upon Ghulam Bibi landing on various parts of her body. Moreover,
Nawaz, co-accused (since acquitted) was assigned the role of

inflicting injury on the person of Faheem injured (PW-1). On the
Murder Reference No.190/2015 10
Crl. Appeal No.1010-J/2015

other hand, from day one the appellant has taken a specific plea that
one Mobushar maternal grandson of the complainant had abducted
sister of the appellant and contracted court marriage with her. Few
days prior to the occurrence an altercation took place in which the
appellant had slapped Noor Muhammad. On the day of occurrence
when the appellant was present in front of shop of Mansha Bhutta,
Ghulam Bibi deceased and Faheem by launching attack caught hold
of him and gave beatings for the insult of Noor Muhammad. The
respectables present over there tried to beseech, however, Mst.
Ghulam Bibi and Faheem did not leave the appellant. In this
backdrop having apprehension to his life, the appellant while
exercising right of self defence, made firing, which resulted into
injuries on the person of Mst. Ghulam Bibi and Faheem. As per
version of the appellant except him no other member of his family was
present over there. The Investigating Officer while appearing in the
witness-box admitted that in support of version of the appellant, 21
persons had joined into investigation before him. So much so large
number of persons had sworn affidavits in support of stance taken by
the appellant. However, not a single person had come forward to
rebut such plea from the complainant side. Relevant extract out of the

statement of Muhammad Iqbal, S.I. (PW-13) reads as under:-

“On 06.08.2014, 21 persons Irfan, Nazeer Ahmed etc.
appeared before me and all of them supported the first
version of accused Shahbaz. Complainant, the injured,
eye-witnesses or any other person from the complainant
side did not appear before me to support the
complainant’s version as mentioned in the FIR. None
from the complainant side appeared before me to negate
the above mentioned version of 21 persons who appeared.
in support of accused Shahbaz. On 06.08.2014 Allah
Ditta, Irfan, Nazeer, Zafar Iqbal, Nusrat Liagat and
Zulfiqar submitted their affidavits in support of version of
accused by maintaining that they were present at the
crime scene at the time of occurrence. They witnessed the
occurrence, Mst. Ghulam Bibi the deceased and Faheem
Murder Reference No.190/2015 11
Crl. Appeal No.1010-J/2015

the injured had launched attack on the accused Shahbaz
who reacted in order to save his life.

It is correct that none from the complainant side
appeared to negate the said affidavits.”

As far as admissibility of the first plea of the accused is concerned, the
same is relevant within the meaning of Article 27 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984. Wisdom is sought from the ratio decidendi of
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of SHABBIR HUSSAIN
alias SUKKU_ vs. THE STATE (PLD 2003 Supreme Court 368);

wherein following principle was laid down:-

“---Art. 19---Relevancy of facts forming part of same
transaction---Statements, utterances and declarations in
order to be admissible/relevant as “res gestae” should
be contemporaneous with the occurrence/incident in
issue...

In the Indian jurisdiction, in a landmark judgment in the case of C.N.
Peters vs. State reported as 1959 AIR (Allahabad) 483 and 1959 Cri

LJ 924) this question was dilated upon in the following terms: -

“The appellant have a spontaneous explanation right at
the moment when the crime was committed and,
therefore, his first explanation amounted to res gestae
within the meaning of Section 6 of the Indian Evidence
Act.”

In a reported judgment in the case of LIAQAT ALI and another vs.
THE STATE (1998 P.Cr.L.J 216); following guidelines were given:-

“Tt may also be added that the statement of an accused
person immediately after the occurrence is in a way very
relevant fact within the meaning of Article 27 of Qanun-
e-Shahadat and as such there can be no legal bar in
bringing it on record as an admissible for fact.”

Although it is the prosecution case that besides the appellant, Nawaz
armed with pistol, Jahangir (carrying bullet bag) and Muhammad

Hayat were present out of whom the appellant and Nawaz had made
Murder Reference No.190/2015 12
Crl. Appeal No.1010-J/2015

firing, however, during the course of investigation, the Investigating
Officer opined that except the appellant rest of the accused were not
linked with the occurrence. So much so they were acquitted of the
charge on the same set of evidence and no appeal against their
acquittal was filed meaning thereby that only presence of the
appellant was admitted by the learned trial court at the place of
occurrence. If the prosecution version, as well as, defence plea taken
by the appellant are juxtaposed with the independent facts and
circumstances and evaluated on judicial parlance it becomes crystal
clear that both sides have not advanced their case with clean hands.
Hence, while taking into consideration the material floating on the
record, we have persuaded to hold that keeping in view the facts of the
case, the evidence floating on record, as well as, other attending
circumstances, the learned court below while passing conviction had
failed to follow the guidelines given by the superior courts of the
country on the subject particularly when it had believed that except
the appellant none other accused including Nawaz, who was assigned
the role of inflicting injury on the person of Faheem, was present at
the place of occurrence. Moreover, during the course of arguments
learned counsel for the complainant when confronted frankly
conceded that facts and circumstances floating on the record do not
attract the provisions of Section 302(b), PPC. Therefore, keeping in
view the peculiar facts of the case we have been persuaded to hold
that to the extent of the appellant prosecution case only attracts the
ingredients of Section 302(c), PPC, therefore, the learned trial court
fell in error while convicting him under Section 302(b), PPC.
Respectful reliance in this regard is placed on Syed Ali Bepari vs.
Nibran Mollah and others (PLD 1962 SC 502); wherein, the august

Supreme Court of Pakistan has been pleased to observe as under: -

“Here we may observe that in a case of this type the
parties do not generally come out with the true story. It is
Murder Reference No.190/2015 13
Crl. Appeal No.1010-J/2015

a normal incident of an “adversary proceeding’’ to
minimize one’s own part in the incident. In such a case
the Court must not be deterred by the incompleteness of
the tale from drawing the inference that properly flow
from the evidence and circumstances....”

Moreover, in the case of ABDUL KARIM vs. THE STATE (2007
SCMR 1375), it was further held as under: -

“---Ss. 302(b) & 302(c)---Appraisal of evidence---
Accused had not acted in a preplanned or premeditated
manner to take the life of the deceased in order to saddle
him with the criminal liability arising under S.302(b),
P.P.C.---Accused in a sudden flare up and in the heat of
passion had acted in a manner, which could not be
totally justified to bring his case within the ambit of
S.302(b), P.P.C.---Injuries on the person of the accused
were concealed in the F.LR. as well as at the trial and
despite his arrest on the same day he was not got
medically examined---Non-explanation of the said facts
by the prosecution had diminished the liability of the
accused for the act committed by him---Conviction of
accused under S.302(b), P.P.C. was restored to S. 302(c),

Similarly, in the case of KHADIM HUSSAIN vs. THE STATE (PLD

2010 Supreme Court 669), the august Supreme Court of Pakistan had
observed that: -
“---§s. 302(c)---Qatl-e-amd---Appreciation of evidence--
-Grave and sudden provocation---Application and scope-
--Grave and sudden provocation had to be shown
distinctly not only that the act was done under the
influence of same feeling which had taken away from the

accused all control over his actions, but that feeling had
an adequate cause.”

14. Hence, while taking into consideration the material
available on record, we are of the considered view that as at the most
act of Shahbaz appellant, only attracts the provisions of Section
302(c), PPC, therefore, as an abundant caution it would be justified if

his sentence is altered accordingly.
Murder Reference No.190/2015 14
Crl. Appeal No.1010-J/2015

While going through the material available on record we have
observed that at the time of occurrence the appellant was quite young
being 20/21 years of age, hence he is liable to be afforded an
opportunity to amend his ways and spend his future life in a better
way particularly when there is nothing on record that the appellant
has any antecedents of his involvement in any criminal case.
Moreover, the occurrence had taken place more than seven years ago
and at that time the maximum punishment for the offence was
provided up-to 25 years imprisonment, therefore, keeping in view the
incarceration already faced by the appellant, it would be justified, if
he is sentenced to undergo RI. for fourteen years. However, the
amount of compensation as ordained in the impugned judgment and
the effect in non-payment thereof, shall remain intact. However,
conviction and sentence recorded under Section 324 and 337-F(i),
PPC, are maintained. All the sentences inflicted upon the appellant
are directed to run concurrently and benefit of Section 382-B, Cr.P.C
is also extended in his favour. Crl. Appeal No.1010-J/2015 filed by the

appellant is dismissed with above modification in his sentence.

15. Murder Reference No.190/2015 forwarded by the learned
trial court in terms of Section 374, Cr.P.C. for confirmation of death
sentence inflicted upon the convict is answered in NEGATIVE. Death

sentence is NOT CONFIRMED.
