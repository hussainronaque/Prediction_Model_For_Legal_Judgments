JUDGMENT
SYED _ARSHAD_ ALI, J.- This criminal
appeal is directed against the judgment dated
09.03.2017 rendered by the learned Sessions
Judge/Zila Qazi Buner at Dagger, in case
F.I.R No. 52 dated 05.03.2009 registered
under section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code
1860 (“PPC”) and section 13 of Arms Act
(“Act”) at Police Station Nawagai District

(one lac) under section 544-A of the Criminal

Procedure Code (“Cr.P.C”). The appellant
was further convicted under section 15 A.A.
and sentenced to 2 months _ rigorous
imprisonment along with fine of Rs. 3,000/-,
or in default thereof, he shall further suffer 10
days simple imprisonment. However, the
accused/appellant was extended the benefit of
section 382-B Cr.P.C.

2. The appellant was charged by the
complainant for the murder of his son. His
reported was incorporated in ‘Murasila’ Ex.
PA/1, which culminated into FIR ibid, Ex. PA
being registered against the accused/appellant
at PS concerned on 05.03.2009. Investigation
in the case was initially entrusted to Noor
Jamal Khan, Inspector, PW-11 who had
prepared the site plan Ex. PB and also
recovered blood stained earth Ex. P-3 and
blood stained shirt along with shalwar of the
deceased Ex. P-1 & Ex. P-2. The appellant
was proceeded under sections 204 & 87
Cr.P.C. Later, proceedings under section 512

Cr.P.C were also initiated against the

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr, Justice Syed Arshad Ali
appellant and upon conclusion of the same, he
was declared proclaimed offender.

3. On 19.05.2015 Muhammad Shah
Khan, SHO PS Nawagai, PW-4 had arrested
the appellant through card of arrest Ex. PW-
4/1 and on his pointation allegedly the crime
weapon i.e. pistol was recovered, thereby
section 15 A.A. was also inserted in the FIR
against the appellant.

4. After completion of investigation,
complete challan was submitted before the
Court. The charge was framed against the
appellant, to which he pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. The prosecution in support of its
case examined as many as eleven (11)
witnesses, whose statements were recorded
and placed on file. On closure of the
prosecution evidence, accused was examined
under section 342, Cr.P.C, wherein he denied
the charges, claimed innocence and stated to
have falsely been implicated in the case.

5. On conclusion of the trial, the

learned trial Court convicted the appellant

NAWAB- DB: Mr, Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
vide the judgment impugned herein. Hence,
the present appeal.
6. We have heard arguments of
learned counsel for the accused/appellant,
learned Astt: Advocate General appearing on
behalf of the State and gone through the
record with their able assistance. While the
complainant appeared in person, in support of
his case.
Ts It is evident from record that on
05.03.2009 at 2:15 P.M the dead body of
deceased Muhammad Sher son of Gul aged
about 25 years was medically examined by the
doctor Muhammad Farooq, PW-8 through
injury sheet/medical report Ex. PW-5/1 and
Ex. PW-8/1. According to the injury sheet, the
dead body of the deceased was brought by Mr.
Jamshed son of Azmat Khan, Mr. Habib Khan
son of Fateh Muhammad Khan and Mr. Gul
son of Yousaf Gul, the complainant, PW-9.
ra According to the medical report, Ex. PW-8/1
the deceased had sustained fire arm injuries

with multiple pellets. The cause of his death

NAWAB_ DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
ge

was due to fire arm injury to the abdomen
causing damage to internal blood vessels. On
the same day at 14:30 hours, the complainant
Gul, PW-9 who is father of the deceased had
reported the matter in the emergency ward to
the Noor Muhammad Khan ASI, In-charge
Casualty DHQ Hospital Dagger to the effect
that on the previous day i.e. 04.03.2009 in the
primary school there was a fight between his
children and the children of the
accused/appellant Gul Zada. Hence, on the
eventful day, his son deceased Muhammad
Sher was going towards the house of the
appellant Gul Zada for complaining against
the matter, however, when he reached at the
place of occurrence, Gul Zada, the appellant
met him and he started firing at his deceased
son through his pistol, which hit his deceased
son at his back and he died on the spot. He has
further stated that the matter was witnessed by
Khan Muhammad son of Gul Ahmad, PW-10
and Nizar Muhammad son of Niaz

Muhammad (abandoned witness).

NAWAB_ DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
8. The entire prosecution case rests
on statement of the complainant namely Gul,
PW-9, the two eye-witnesses of the
occurrence namely Khan Muhammad, PW-10
and Nizar Muhammad who was abandoned by
the prosecution and the recovery of the pistol,
Ex. PW-5/1 on the pointation of the
accused/appellant.

9. As stated above, the time of
occurrence in this case is 13:15 hours. The
deceased was medically examined at 2:15
P.M. and the report was made by the
complainant at 2:30 P.M, therefore, there is
prima facie a delay in registration of the case
and the complainant-party had ample
opportunity to make consultation before the
nomination of the present accused/appellant in
the matter. Such unexplained delay in lodging
of FIR creates serious doubt on the
authenticity of the prosecution version. In this
regard, reliance is placed on the judgment of
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan titled

“Muhammad _Akram_ys_the State (2009
SCMR_230)”, wherein it was held that:-

NAWAB_ DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
“Conduct of the father of the abductee, who
knew the accused, lodged the FIR after an
ordinate delay of six months of the abduction
and recovery of his son, had cast heavy
doubt on the veracity of the FIR.”

Thus, the evidence recorded by
the prosecution has to be examined with due
caution and care.

10. In the ‘Murasila’ Ex. PA/1, the
complainant has not stated that he is the
eye-witness to the occurrence, however, he
appeared before the Court with an improved
version of the case as PW-9. In his statement,
he has stated that he along with the deceased
were going towards the house of the appellant
for complaining against the fight between the
children and when they met the appellant at
the place of occurrence, he started firing on
his son, resultantly, he died at the spot. This
improvement in his statement prima facie
appears to be dishonest, therefore, this witness
does not appear to be a truthful witness and
his testimony regarding the fact that he had

seen the occurrence deserves to be excluded

NAWAB_ DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
from consideration. In this regard, reliance is
placed on the judgment of the august
Supreme Court of Pakistan _ titled
“Muhammad Rafiq vs The State reported as
2010 S CM R 385” wherein it was held that:-
“Improvement made by a witness in order to
strengthen the prosecution case, lose his
credibility and evidentiary value and when a
witness made contradictory statement or
improvement changing his version to in line
his testimony with the story of prosecution, if
found to be deliberate and dishonest, would
cast serious doubt on his veracity”.

The same view further reflects in
case titled “Muhammad Mansha_ys. The
State (2018 SCMR 772)”, wherein it was held
by the Hon’ble apex Court that:- “It is unsafe
to rely on the statement of such witnesses
who had made dishonest improvements in
their statements.”

11. Nizar Muhammad, who
according to the prosecution case had seen the
occurrence, was unnecessarily abandoned by

the prosecution despite being closely related

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
to the complainant. Thus, in the present
circumstances, we are constrained to draw
adverse inference under Article 129 (g) of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 by holding
that the purpose behind withholding of this
witness appears to be based on sinister
designs. We also infer from his non-
appearance before the Court that if the said
alleged eye-witness of the occurrence
produced in the Court he would have not
supported the prosecution case. Non-
examination of the important witness had
materially affected the prosecution case. In
this regard, reliance is placed on the judgment
of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan titled
“Lal Khan_v/s_ The State, reported _in
2006 SCMR 1846, wherein it was held:-
“Non-production of most natural and
material witness of the occurrence would
strongly lead to an inference of prosecutorial
misconduct, which would not only be
considered a source of undue advantage for
prosecution but also an act of suppression of

material facts causing prejudice to accused”.

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Os

12. Thus, the prosecution is left with
the other alleged eye-witness Khan
Muhammad, who appeared as PW-10. The
said witness is the brother-in-law of the
complainant. We are conscious of the fact that
mere relation of the complainant-party with a
witness is no ground to disbelieve his
testimony provided that he is a truthful
witness. This witness has also justified his
presence at the spot because the occurrence
had taken place at 1:15 P.M near the mosque
and in normal routine the people do go to the
mosque for offering their prayers. However,
his statement contradicts the initial version of
the complainant as advanced through
‘Murasila’, Ex, PA/1. As stated above, in the
‘Murasila’ the complainant did not say that he
was the eye-witness to the occurrence,
whereas this witness has stated in his
statement before the Court that the
complainant was also present at the spot.
Thus, this witness does not appear to be a
truthful witness. Not only this, but his

immediate conduct after the murder of the

NAWAB~ DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
= Tihs

deceased is unnatural. This witness had not
accompanied the deceased to the hospital as
evident from the injury sheet/medical report,
Ex. PW-5/1 & Ex. PW-8/1. According to
which, the dead body of the deceased was
accompanied by Mr. Jamshed son of Azmat
Khan, Mr. Habib Khan son of Fateh
Muhammad Khan and Mr. Gul son of Yousaf
Gul, the complainant, PW-9. Thus, being a
close relative his normal conduct was that he
should have accompanied the deceased to the
hospital and should have also supported the
statement of the complainant at the time of
recording of ‘Murasila’.

Thus, it unsafe to rely upon the
statement of this witness more particularly
when we have excluded from consideration
the statement of the complainant and the fact
that prosecution has abandoned the other
material witness to the incident.

13. Moving forward to the recovery
of the crime weapon i.e. pistol on the
pointation of the accused/appellant, Ex. PW-

5/1. The occurrence in this case had taken

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
«i Be

place on 05.03.2009 at 13:15 hours, whereas
the crime weapon was recovered through
recovery memo Ex. PW-5/2 from bushes on
12.05.2015. It is the case of prosecution that
the said crime weapon was hidden in the
bushes after commission of the offence by the
appellant, however, it does not appeal to a
prudent mind that the said pistol was lying
there for a good more than 6 years and even
then it was in the working condition. In this
regard, Bakhti Rawan, ASI,PW-6 in his cross-
examination has made the following

admissions:-

This is also unbelievable that
why the appellant would keep the pistol in the
said place 3/4 days prior to his arrest. Even
otherwise, this recovery was never supported
by any private witness. It is settled law that
when the ocular testimony fails to establish
the case of prosecution against the accused
then recovery of crime weapon being

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
ge

~ [3x

corroborative piece of evidence also losses its
evidentiary value. Reliance is placed on the

judgment of the august Supreme Court of

Pakistan titled "Imran Ashraf and 7 others vs
the State(2001 SCMR 424)” , wherein it was
held that:- "Recovery of incriminating articles
is used for the purpose of providing
corroboration to the ocular testimony. Ocular
evidence and recoveries, therefore, are to be
considered simultaneously in order to reach for
a just conclusion."

Likewise, if any other law is
needed on the same analogy, reference can
be placed on the judgment of the Hon’ble
Apex Court titled "Dr. Israr-ul-Haq vs
Muhammad_Fayyaz_and_ another 2007
SCMR 1427” wherein it was observed that:-
"Direct evidence having failed, corroborative
evidence was of no help. When ocular
evidence is disbelieved in a criminal case then
the recovery of an incriminating article in the
nature of weapon of offence does not by itself

prove the prosecution case.

14, In view of the above discussion,

we are of the absolute view that the

NAWAB_ DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-14-

prosecution has failed to prove its case against
the accused/appellant beyond any shadow of
doubt; therefore, his conviction cannot be
maintained, resultantly, we accept this appeal
by setting aside his conviction and sentence
recorded by the learned trial Court through the
impugned judgment dated 09.03.2017 and
acquit him of the charge levelled against him,
by extending him the benefit of doubt. He be
set free forthwith, if not required in any other
case.

15. These are the reasons of our short

order of even date.
