SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- At a trial held before
learned Sessions Judge, Lakki, in case FIR No.442 dated
30.12.2014, registered under Sections 302/324/34 PPC
at police station Tajori, District Lakki Marwat, the
accused/respondents were acquitted vide judgment dated
26.4.2018, which has been assailed by the State through
Advocate General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar,
through the instant appeal.

2. The prosecution story as disclosed in the
FIR Ex. CW 1/1, registered on the basis of murasila Ex.
PA/1, in brief, is that on 30.12.2014 at 1830 hours,

complainant Ajmal Khan brought the dead body of his

-2-
son Hayat Khan and made report in the emergency room
of civil hospital, Tajori to the effect that on the night of
occurrence, he alongwith his son Hayat Khan was
present in Mohibullah market situated in village Tajori,
meanwhile, at about 1800 hours, their co-villagers
accused Faizullah, Amin Khan, Amand Khan alias
Muno and Hafiz ur Rehman, duly armed with
Kalashnikovs came there and started indiscriminate
firing at them with the intention to commit their gati-i-
amd, as a result of firing of the accused, his son Hayat
Khan got hit and fell down, whereas he luckily escaped
unhurt. After commission of the offence, the accused
fled away from the spot. When he attended his son, by
then he had succumbed to his injuries. Besides the
complainant, the occurrence was stated to be witnessed
by the people present on the spot. Motive for the offence
is stated to be a dispute over women folk. On the report
of complainant, instant case vide the captioned FIR was
registered against the accused.

3. On completion of the investigation,

complete challan was submitted before the trial Court.
-3-

Accused were charged for the offence to which they
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order to prove its
case, the prosecution examined as many as six
witnesses, whereafter, the accused were examined under
Section 342, Cr.P.C, wherein they denied the allegations
and professed innocence, however, they did not opt to be
examined under Section 340(2), Cr.P.C. In defence, the
accused filed an application through their counsel for
requisitioning the record mentioned therein, hence Zahid
Niaz Incharge VRK and Rehman Ullah Khan No.16
were produced and examined as DW-1 and DW-2. The
learned trial Court, after hearing arguments from both
the sides, vide judgment dated 10.02.2017, convicted the
accused Hafizullah alias Hafiz ur Rahman under Section
302(b) PPC and sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment
for life with fine of Rs.2,00,000/-. He was also held
liable to pay compensation of Rs.8,00,000/- to the legal
heirs of the deceased in due shares as required under
section 544-A, Cr.P.C. or in default thereof to further
undergo six months simple imprisonment. Benefit of

Section 382-B, Cr.P.C. was extended to the convict,
-4-
however, co-accused Faizullah, Amin Khan and Amand
Khan alias Mano were acquitted. The convict Faizullah
assailed his conviction and sentence by filing Cr.A. No.
48-B/2017 before this Court. This Court vide judgment
dated 09.10.2017, accepted the appeal, set aside the
impugned judgment and remanded the case to learned
trial Court for rewriting the judgment on the basis of
evidence which the prosecution had already brought
against all the accused. On receipt of the record, the
learned trial Court heard arguments from both the sides
and vide impugned judgment dated 26.4.2018, acquitted
the accused/ respondents, hence this appeal.

4. Arguments heard and record perused.

5. It was on 30.12.2014 at 1800 hours when
the complainant alongwith his son Hayat Khan was
present in Mohibullah market situated in village Tajori,
meanwhile, their co-villagers accused Faizullah, Amin
Khan, Amand Khan alias Muno and Hafiz ur Rehman,
duly armed with Kalashnikovs came there and started
indiscriminate firing at them with the intention to

commit their gatl-i-amd, as a result of firing of the
~5-

accused, his son Hayat Khan got hit, fell down and
succumbed to his injuries, whereas the complainant
luckily escaped unhurt. It is in the report that besides the
complainant, the occurrence was witnessed by the
people present on the spot. The complainant is the only
eye-witness who was examined as PW-05, and the
prosecution case hinges upon the testimony of this
witness who is also father of the deceased. The relation
between the two is so close that the Courts must be on
guards while accepting the testimony of such a witness
especially in the cases where capital punishment could
be awarded. The complainant was examined as PW-05,
who stated that after performing prayer he came out of
the Masjid, and went to his house at 06.00 p.m where he
was asked for purchase of house hold articles and for the
purpose he came out from his house and reached to the
shop where his son was standing. If this version of the
complainant is accepted, then how it is believable that he
was present on the spot at 6:00 p.m, which is also the
time of occurrence. Similarly, complainant further stated

in his cross examination that when he reached to the

-6-
market, his son Hayat Khan was already standing there
and had not yet gone to the shop for purchase of any
article. This was never stated by him in his report. We
are also surprised to see that despite allegation of
indiscriminate firing by four accused with the
Kalashnikovs, how the complainant escaped unhurt, the
explanation given by him does not appeal to prudence.
The complainant further stated that when the
Investigating Officer came to the spot, he was present on
the road, on the other hand, Mamoor Khan ASI PW-6
stated that the complainant accompanied him from the
police station to the spot. Though the complainant stated
that after the occurrence they arranged a cot and datsun
for the deceased and took the dead body to the hospital,
however, he was unable to disclose the names of persons
who arranged the cot and the datsun. Admittedly, the
occurrence took place in a market and according to the
complainant people were present at the time of
occurrence, but none from them was cited as a witness,
despite the fact that the place of occurrence was near the

market, where at the time of incident the shops were
-7-
open but the Investigating Officer did not associate any
one of the shop keepers to confirm the incident.
Complainant admitted in his cross examination that at
the time of occurrence Amanullah and Ghulam
Muhammad were also present in the market and while
shifting the dead body, they accompanied them to the
hospital. These witnesses identified the deadbody before
the police at the time of preparation of the inquest report
and later on before the doctor when he was conducting
the post mortem examination. The presence of these
witnesses cannot be doubted on the spot at the time of
occurrence as they were the people who accompanied
the deadbody from the spot and their names were put in
the calendar of the witnesses but during trial they were
abandoned. The prosecution failed to explain that why
these witnesses were not produced as both the witnesses
who identified the deadbody were independent and
disinterested, had they been produced would have told
the truth, but their nonproduction gives an inference that
they were not ready to support the false charge of the

complainant against the respondent. The Article 129 (g)

-8-
of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order, 1984 caters for the

situation which reads as:

129, Court may presume
existence of certain facts. Court may presume
the existence of any fact which it thinks likely
to have happened, regard being had to the
common course of natural events, human
conduct and public and private business, in
their relation to the facts of the particular case.

Illustrations
The Court may presume--
(a)...
(b)...

(g) that evidence which could be and is
not produced would, if produced, be
unfavourable to the person who withholds it;

6. The prosecution came with an excuse that
these witnesses could not be produced being close
relatives of the accused and it feared that they would not
support the prosecution case, but this explanation does
not appeal to a prudent mind that had this been so then
these witnesses would have not accompanied the
deadbody to the hospital and would refrain to be
witnesses of identification rather they whole heartedly
rushed to the hospital but what can be gathered from is
that, the complainant has brought a false charge against

the respondents and the witnesses were not willing to

-9-
support the complainant. The law is settled that when
the best possible evidence is withheld then its
nonproduction will react against the prosecution with an
otherwise inference. In this respect, reliance can well be

placed on the case reported as Lal Khan Vs. The State

(2006 SCMR 1846).

7, It is axiomatic and universally recognized
principle of law that conviction must be founded on
unimpeachable evidence and certainty of guilt and hence
any doubt that arises in the prosecution case must be
resolved in favour of the accused. It is, therefore,
imperative for the Court to examine and consider all the
relevant events preceding and leading to the occurrence
so as to arrive at a correct conclusion. Where the
evidence produced by the prosecution is found
inherently unreliable, improbable and against natural
course of human conduct, then the conclusion must be
that the prosecution failed to prove guilt beyond
reasonable doubt. It would be unsafe to rely on the
ocular evidence which has been molded, changed and

improved step by step so as to fit in with the other

-10-
evidence on record. It is obvious that truth and falsity of
the prosecution case can only be judged when the entire
evidence and circumstances are scrutinized and
examined in its correct perspective. Reliance placed on
case reported as Muhammad Khan and another Vs.
The State (1999 SCMR 1220).

8. Yet another damaging aspect to the
prosecution case is non-recovery of even single empty
from the spot notwithstanding the allegation that four
persons made firing with Kalashnikovs. Even no
explanation was furnished by the prosecution that why
empties were not recovered from the spot. It is also an
element of surprise that during spot inspection, no bullet
marks were noted by the Investigating Officer in the
surroundings of the spot. It touches the very roots of the
case and cannot simply be brushed aside and that too for
sustaining conviction on a capital charge.

9. The record further transpires that
admittedly the deceased succumbed to his injuries on the
spot, but his dead body was shifted to the hospital

despite the fact that police station situates at a distance

-ll-
of 1’ furlong from the spot. PW-2 Saif ur Rahman ASI,
who scribed the report stated that the place of occurrence
is situated in between the police station and hospital, so
it is astonishing that why the report was not lodged in
the police station, rather the dead body was shifted to

hospital where report was lodged.

In case titled “Nazeer Ahmad and others

Vs The State and others (2019 SCMR 594), wherein it

is held that:

“The FIR in respect of the incident in
issue had not been lodged at the Police
Station giving rise to an inference that the
same had been lodged and registered after
deliberations and preliminary

investigation.”

10. While going through the judgment
impugned herein, we found that there are other
numerous infirmities in the prosecution case which have
been highlighted by learned trial Court while recording
acquittal of the accused/respondents. Besides, generally
the order of acquittal cannot be interfered with because
the presumption of innocence of the accused is further

strengthened by acquittal. The golden thread which runs

-12-

through the web of administration of justice in criminal
cases is, that, if two views are possible on the evidence
adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the
accused and the other to his innocence, the view which
is favourable to the accused should be adopted. The
paramount consideration of the Court is to ensure that
miscarriage of justice is prevented. A miscarriage of
justice which may arise from acquittal of the guilty is no
less than from the conviction of an innocent. In a case
where admissible evidence is ignored, a duty is casted
upon the appellate Court to re-appreciate the evidence in
a case where the accused has been acquitted, or the
purpose of ascertaining as to whether the accused
committed the offence or not. The principle to be
followed by this Court considering the appeal against the
judgment of acquittal is, to interfere only when there are
compelling and substantial reasons for doing so. If the
impugned judgment is clearly unreasonable, it is a

compelling reason for interference.
