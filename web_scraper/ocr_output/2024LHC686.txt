Crl. Appeal No.56380 of 2021
(Muhammad Bilal versus The State etc.)

Crl. Revision No.42144 of 2021

(Muhammad Saleem _ versus Muhammad Bilal, etc.)
JUDGMENT
Date of hearing: 20.02.2024.
Appellant by: Ch. Muhammad Imran Fazal Gill, Advocate.
State by: Rana Muhammad Imran Anjum, DPG.
Complainant by: In person.

Aalia Neelum, J: - Muhammad Bilal, son of Amanat Ali,

resident of Chak Kirpa Ram, Tehsil & District Pakpattan, the appellant was
involved in case F.L.R. No.724 of 2018, registered on 04.08.2018, under
Sections 302, 34 PPC, at Police Station, Township, District Lahore and was
tried by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore. The trial court seized
with the matter in terms of the judgment dated 16.06.2021, convicted the
appellant-Muhammad Bilal, under Section 302(b) PPC, and sentenced him
to rigorous imprisonment for life as Tazeer with the direction to pay
Rs.5,00,000/- as compensation to the legal heirs of the deceased and in case
of default in payment thereof, the appellant would further undergo simple
imprisonment for six months. The benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. was also

extended in favour of the appellant.

2. Feeling aggrieved by the trial court's judgment, Muhammad
Bilal, the appellant, has assailed his conviction through the instant criminal
appeal, i.e., Crl. Appeal No.56380 of 2021. The complainant, dissatisfied
with the impugned judgment dated 16.06.2021, preferred a Criminal

Revision No.42144 of 2021 for awarding death sentence to respondent
Crl. Appeal No.56380 of 2021
& Cri. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

No.1/appellant. As both matters arise from the same judgment, they are

being disposed of through a single judgment.

3. The prosecution story as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex.PH) lodged on
the statement (Ex.PA) of Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant is
that he deals in fruits. On 04.08.2018 at about 04:45 p.m., his brother
Nadeem was selling mangoes on his loader rickshaw while standing in front
of Al-Fazal Restaurant at Barkat Chowk, and the complainant (PW-1) was
also selling mangoes near his brother. Meanwhile, Muhammad Bilal (the
appellant), Rizwan (co-accused since acquitted), and one unknown accused
came in a Chingchi rickshaw. Muhammad Bilal (the appellant) raised his
voice not to let Nadeem live. After that, Rizwan (co-accused since acquitted)
and an unknown accused caught hold the arms of the brother of the
complainant and Muhammad Bilal (the appellant) took out “Churri” from
his “Dabb” and inflicted “Churri” blow on the right side of chest of the
brother of the complainant, who fell on the ground. The complainant (PW-1)
called 1122 and shifted the injured to Emergency of Jinnah Hospital, where
he succumbed to the injuries. The motive behind the occurrence was that the
accused persons used to sell mangoes after purchasing from the complainant
party. The accused persons purchased mangoes, which were found rotten,
and one day before the occurrence, the accused persons extended threats of
dire consequences to the complainant's brother. The occurrence was

witnessed by Allah Ditta (PW-2) and Muhammad Imran (given up PW).

4. Upon receiving the information of the occurrence at 15,
Muhammad Iqbal S.I (PW-9) reached Jinnah Hospital, Lahore, where the
complainant (PW-1) got recorded his statement (Ex. PA) before him (PW-
9), who, after completing police karawai sent the same to the Police Station
through Amin 5262/HC (not cited as a witness), after that formal FIR.
(Exh. PH) was chalked out by Muhammad Arshad, ASI (PW-5).

5. After registration of the case, the investigation of this case was
entrusted to Aurangzaib, S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer, who, having

found the accused/appellant guilty, prepared a challan and sent the same to
Crl. Appeal No.56380 of 2021

& Cri. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

the court of competent jurisdiction while placing the names of all accused
persons in Column No.3 of the challan. On 12.07.2019, the trial court
formally charge-sheeted the appellant, to which he pleaded not guilty and

claimed trial. In support of its version, the prosecution produced as many as

nine (09) witnesses.

6.

examination on the body of the deceased, Muhammad Nadeem, and found

The ocular account in this case consists of the statements of
Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant, and Allah Ditta (PW-2). Dr.
Abdul Sattar (PW-4) deposed that on 05.08.2018, he conducted postmortem

the following injuries on his person: -

INJURIES.

1 A spindle-shaped incised wound size 3 X 2
CM on the right lower part of the front of the
chest. It was running obliquely. It was 10
C.M infromedial to right nipple. It was 7
C.M. from the midline. On dissection, muscle
in the space between the 4th and 5th rib was
incised, and pericardium and __ heart
incised/cut. 2 liters of clotted and un-clotted
blood recovered from the thoracic cavity.

After conducting the postmortem examination, the doctor

rendered the following opinion: -

OPINION

“Injury stated above was ante-mortem and caused
by sharp edge weapon. The cause of death in this
case was injury to the vital organ, the heart,
leading to profuse hemorrhage shock and death.
The said injury was sufficient to cause death in the
ordinary course of nature. The time between
death and postmortem was 09 to 12 hours.”

Ex. PG is the correct carbon copy of the
postmortem report, whereas Ex.PG/l and
Ex.PG/2 are pictorial diagrams of injuries.

The statements of the remaining prosecution witnesses are formal.

7.

Imran being unnecessary, and closed the prosecution evidence on

The learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor gave up PW,
Crl. Appeal No.56380 of 2021
& Cri. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

20.05.2021 after tendering the reports of Punjab Forensic Science Agency,
Lahore (Ex. PU, Ex. PV and Ex. PW).

8. After the closure of the evidence, the appellant was examined
under Section 342 of Cr.P.C., wherein he neither opted to appear as his own
witness in terms of Section 340 (2) Cr.P.C nor produced any evidence in his
defence. While replying to the question of why this case was against him
and why the PWs deposed against him, the appellant made the following

deposition: -

“In fact Muhammad Nadeem was murdered by
the second husband of widow of Nadeem. Widow
of deceased Nadeem had affair with her second
husband before marriage and due to this affair
second husband of widow committed the murder
of Nadeem. Just after the death of Nadeem his
widow entered into second marriage and left her
daughter at the house of legal heirs of deceased.
I and Muhammad Rizwan were aware regarding
said affair due to which complainant implicated
me and co-accused falsely in order to save his
honor. Complainant, witnesses and deceased
were not residents of Lahore. I and Muhammad
Rizwan were residing at Lahore but we were not
willing to become witness of complainants case
due to said grudge complainant implicated me
and Rizwan falsely. After the occurrence
Pinchayat regarding compromise was also held.
I and Rizwan gave proof regarding our
innocence but complainant implicated us falsely.
PW Imran was not willing to support
complainants version due to which complainant
give up his evidence. Complainant demanded
money from me and co-accused Rizwan.
Witnesses gave false evidence with the
connivance of complainant and police. In fact I
was arrested by the police from the first day of
occurrence when I visited the police station with
complainant party.”

9. After recording evidence and evaluating the evidence available
on record in the light of the arguments advanced by both sides, the trial court
found the prosecution version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable

doubt, which resulted in the appellant's conviction in the afore-stated terms.
Crl. Appeal No.56380 of 2021
& Cri. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

10. I have heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for
the parties and Deputy Prosecutor General and have minutely perused the

record on the file.

11. The occurrence occurred on 04.08.2018 at 04.45 p.m. on the
roadside at Barkat Chowk in front of Al-Feezan Restaurant, situated within
the jurisdiction of Police Station Township, District Lahore, which is at a
distance of one (01) Kilometer only from the place of occurrence. As per the
prosecution case, Muhammad Nadeem, brother of the complainant (PW-1)
Muhammad Saleem, was stabbed with a knife by the appellant, Muhammad
Bilal, and Muhammad Nadeem (then injured) was shifted by rescue 1122
from the place of occurrence to Jinnah Hospital, Lahore, emergency, but
before reaching Hospital, Muhammad Nadeem the injured succumbed to the
injury. Upon receiving information about the fight, Muhammad Iqbal SI.
(PW-9) reached the place of the occurrence. When he reached there, he
found out that the injured had been taken by 1122 to the emergency of
Jinnah Hospital, Lahore, where Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant
got recorded Fard Bayyan (Ex.PA) to Muhammad Iqbal S.I. (PW-9) at 05:40
p.m. and signed (Ex. PA/1) by him. Muhammad Iqbal SI. (PW-9)
incorporated police proceedings (Ex. PA/3). The incident was not reported
to the police at the Police Station. F.I.R. (Exh.PH) was registered on the oral
statement (Exh.PA) of Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant, on
04.08.2018 at 06:00 p.m. It is clear from the Fard Bayan (Exh. PA) that the
statement of Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant, was recorded by
Muhammad Iqbal S.I. (PW-9) at the emergency of Jinnah Hospital, Lahore,
at 05:40 p.m. Contrary to the above, Muhammad Iqbal SI. (PW-9) deposed

during examination-in-chief that: -

“Stated that_on 04.08.2018 I was posted at
P.S. Township Lahore. After receiving the
information of occurrence I reached at the
place of occurrence from where I proceeded
for Jinnah __ Hospital, Lahore _ where
complainant Muhammad Saleem _met_me
and handed over to me his written statement

Ex.PA bearing signature and thumb
Crl. Appeal No.56380 of 2021
& Cri. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

impression of complainant. J drafted
complaint Ex.PA/3 and sent _it at_police
station through constable Amin for the
registration of case.”

Muhammad Iqbal S.I. (PW-9) deposed during cross-examination that he
reached the hospital at 05:00 p.m. The relevant portion of the cross-

examination reads as follows: -

“Dead body was shifted in emergency ward
by 1122. Death certificate was received by
me. I reached at hospital at about 05:00 PM.
Complainant gave to me _ his written
statement which had been written by him
before my arrival.”

According to Muhammad Iqbal S.I. (PW-9), when he reached
the hospital, he received the dead body of the deceased. According to him,
the deceased died at 05 in the evening, and Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the
complainant, made his statement before him for registration of the case, and
he reduced to writing the statement of Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the
complainant, same was read over to him, and he accepted as correct. The
scanned copy of the police proceedings incorporated (Ex. PA/3) is as

& Cri. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-

examination that: -

6

“On the day of occurrence I visited police
station after about two hours. Police visited
hospital. I filed application at police station
again said at hospital. 1 am under metric. I
did not write myself application for
registration of case. Application was written
by police. I narrated the occurrence to the
police and application was prepared on the
basis of said information. My statement was
recorded by Iqbal ASI. Police reached at
hospital after half hour. 2/3 other police
officials were also present with Iqbal ASI. I
cannot tell their names and designations.
Zahid Iqbal, Allah Ditta, Imran and 2/3
other relatives also reached at hospital. I
cannot tell the name of doctor and medical
staff who met us at hospital. Time was about
04:30/05:00 PM. We remained present_at
hospital for about half hour.”

Contrary to the deposition of Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant,
Allah Ditta (PW-2), the first cousin of the complainant and eye witness,

deposed during cross-examination that: -

“Iqbal ASI reached at hospital. We narrated
occurrence to the police. Application was
given to the police which was written by
Orangzaib. Orangzaib_is not_my relative.
Orangzaib_ is police officer. On the day of
occurrence I visited the police station at
about 06:30 PM. Police officials also left with
us when we proceeded for police station. We
were in police vehicle. We reached at police
station at about 07:00 PM. We did not stop
anywhere on the way to the police station.
We _filed application at __police station.
Application regarding occurrence was given
in police station. Muhammad Saleem
complainant gave said application. Faisal
ASI visited hospital. I cannot tell the time for
which we remained at police station. My
statement_was recorded by police at police
Crl. Appeal No.56380 of 2021
& Cri. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

station. My statement was recorded by
Orangzaib police officer. After leaving police
station we went to hospital. I cannot tell the
time _of reaching hospital. We remained
present _at_hospital till 04:00 AM. Police

again visited the hospital. Name of police
official is not remember to me. ---------- Lhave

good memory. After taking dead body we
went to our native Town.”

The matter can also be examined from another angle; in the inquest report
(Exh.PF) in column No.3, related to the time of information received about
the occurrence, it was mentioned at 05:25 p.m. on 04.08.2018. The contents

of column No.3 of inquest report (Exh.PF) are reproduced hereunder,

Nabdues 5:25 4/8/18 ei"

It is mentioned in column No.8 of the inquest report (Exh. PF)
that the mouth was open. The prosecution witnesses, i.e., Muhammad
Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant, and Allah Ditta (PW-2), deposed in their
court statements that they were with Muhammad Nadeem (then injured)
when he was shifted to the hospital and before reaching the hospital, he
succumbed to the injuries. If they attended to the deceased and he took his
last breath in the rescue 1122 ambulance, then there was no reason for the
mouth to be open. The medical staff always treat the body with dignity and
respect; position the body in a supine position with anatomical alignment
and close eyes and mouth if open. The second external check that is equally
important is sending a copy of the FIR along with the dead body for post-
mortem examination and its reference in the inquest report (Exh. PF). In the
column of the brief history of the inquest report (Exh. PF), Aurangzaib SI.
(PW-8)-the investigating officer, specifically mentioned that a case has been
registered and he is proceeding for investigation of the crime to the place of
occurrence and others along with other police officers. Even then, it was not
mentioned that FIR was also sent along with other documents with the dead
body for post-mortem examination. The absence of these details in the

inquest report may indicate that the FIR was not registered and was recorded
Crl. Appeal No.56380 of 2021
& Cri. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

after due deliberations and consultation. The scanned copy of the relevant
portion of the inquest report (Ex. PF) reads as follows: -

These facts create doubt in the prosecution case and the credibility and
truthfulness of the statements of prosecution witnesses, i.e., Muhammad
Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant, and Allah Ditta (PW-2). This also creates
doubt about the genuineness of the version given by prosecution witnesses,
i.e., Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant, and Allah Ditta (PW-2). I
further noticed that Doctor Abdul Sattar (PW-4) conducted the post-mortem
examination of the dead body of Muhammad Nadeem. Doctor Abdul Sattar

(PW-4) deposed during cross-examination that: -

“Dead body had arrived at hospital before
starting of my duty timing. Dead body was
received at 06:50 PM at dead house on
04.08.2018. —_—-------------- I conducted

postmortem at 03:00 AM on 05.08.2018. I
conducted postmortem _after_about seven
hours from the starting time of my duty. I
received police papers on 05.08.2018 at 02:45
AM. I received police papers after about
eight hours of receiving dead body in the
dead house. _-------------- I conducted
postmortem with the delay of eight hours
due _to_non availability of police papers.
Police handed over to me police papers with
delay. Injury mentioned in postmortem
report may not be caused by simple blade.
Volunteered stated that it may be caused by
sharp edge object having heavy blade.”
10
Crl. Appeal No.56380 of 2021

& Cri. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

I noticed that death had not taken place at the time given by the
prosecution witnesses, nor the witnesses were present at the spot, which also
got support from the inquest report (Exh. PF), wherein the names of
Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant, and Allah Ditta (PW-2) were
not mentioned. It indicated that the incident did not occur as stated by the
prosecution. However, Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant, and
Allah Ditta (PW-2) deposed that they remained with Aurangzaib S.I. (PW-
8)-the investigating officer in hospital after the death of Muhammad
Nadeem, the deceased. If he (PW-8) visited and prepared the inquest report
(Exh. PF) and had met with Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant,

and Allah Ditta (PW-2). In that case, there is no reason why the names of
the complainant and eyewitness are missing from the inquest report
(Exh. PF). The absence of those details indicates that the prosecution
story was still in the embryo and had not been given any shape. The FIR

was recorded after due deliberations and consultations, and the FIR was then
ante-timed. All these factual circumstances lead to the conclusion that
relying upon the FIR in the instant case is unsafe.

12. As per the prosecution version, “bloodstained Churri” (P-6) was
recovered on the disclosure of the appellant Bilal and produced by him, the
Deoxyribonucleic acid (abbreviated DNA) of Muhammad Nadeem, the
deceased was matched with the swab taken from the blade of Churri (P-6).
As per the report of Forensic DNA and Serology Analysis of the Punjab
Forensic Science Agency (Ex. PU), the swabs were taken from items # 5.1
and 5.2, the blade and handle of churri (P-6), and item # 5.1 was stained with
human blood. As per the report, Forensic DNA and Serology Analysis
(Supplementary-I) of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Ex. PW) reveals
that a swab taken from the blade of Churri item # 5.1 matches the DNA
profile of Muhammad Nadeem, the deceased. At the same time, the report,
Forensic DNA and Serology Analysis (Supplementary-I) of the Punjab
Forensic Science Agency (Ex. PW) reveals that a swab taken from the
handle of Churri item # 5.2 did not match the DNA profile of Muhammad
Rizwan (since acquitted) and Muhammad Bilal, the appellant. The relevant

part of the report (Ex. PW) reads as follows: -
11
Crl. Appeal No.56380_of 2021

& Cri. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

“The partial DNA profile obtained from item
# 5.2 is consistent with the DNA profile of
Muhammad Nadeem (item # 2). The
probability of finding an unrelated
individual at random in the population as
being a source of the DNA obtained from
item # 5.2 is approximately one in 71
quadrillion in Caucasians. The genetic loci
D21S11, CSFIPO_ and _D2S1338 were not
used for frequency calculations. Muhammad
Rizwan (item # $1) and Muhammad Bilal
(item # S2) are eliminated as being

contributors to the DNA obtained from item
#5.2.”

I have found from the evidence of Mudassar Shahzad 1939/C
(PW-6), Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer, that the accused
were arrested on 20.08.2018. Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating

officer, deposed during examination-in-chief that: -

“On 20.08.2018 I arrested _accused_ persons
Bilal and Rizwan. -------------------------- On
31.08.2018 at the disclosure and pointation of

accused Bilal, a crime weapon bloodstained
Churri P6 was recovered from his house. ----
— I repared its sealed and

stamped _ parcel and took it into possession
through recovery memo Ex.PQ attested b

Mudassar Shahzad H.C and Shakeel Ahmed
constable. I recorded the statements of said

witnesses. I further prepared site plan Ex.PT

regarding the place of said recovery.” He
(PW-8) deposed during cross-examination that,

“On 31.08.2018 when I took accused Bilal for
the purpose of recovery then door of his
rented house was already opened .--------------
-Churri P6 was of ordinary nature which
may be purchased from market. I did not
mention in case diary that where
complainant filed application for registration
of case. Volunteered stated that application
was filed _at_police station and said _fact_is
mentioned in the proceedings of Muhammad
Iqbal SL.”

Mudassar Shahzad 1939/C (PW-6), deposed during examination-in-chief
that: -

12
Crl. Appeal No.56380_of 2021

& Cri. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

“On 31.08.2018 at the disclosure and
pointation of accused Muhammad_ Bilal

crime weapon Churri P6 was recovered from
his rented house No.14-B-1 situated at

Township Market lying under the wooden
box _from_ residential room wrapped_in
plastic shopper and paper and it was blood
stained. I1.O. prepared its sealed and stamped
parcel _and_took into possession through
recovery memo Ex.PQ attested by me and
Shakeel Ahmad _ constable.” He (PW-6)
deposed during cross-examination that, “When

we visited the place of recovery then five / six
persons were present_in the house. Lady
constable was not present _with us.
Volunteered_stated_that_place of recovery
was not residence of family and said rooms
were got on rent by unmarried persons.”

From the deposition of Mudassar Shahzad 1939/C (PW-6),
Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer, it reveals that appellant
Bilal, along with his co-accused (since acquitted), was arrested on
20.08.2018; the appellant, Bilal, made disclosure and led to the recovery of
crime weapon and produced a crime weapon. i.e., blood-stained knife (P-6)
on 31.08.2018 by the appellant, Muhammad Bilal. As per the prosecution
case, appellant Bilal was arrested on 20.08.2018. Strangely, Aurangzeb SI.
(PW-8)-the investigating officer, received the accused persons and other
photographs from Shakeel Ahmad Constable on 10.08.2018. Aurangzeb SI.
(PW-8)-the investigating officer could not retrieve the crime weapon on
20.08.2018 when the arrest of the appellant Muhammad Bilal was shown,
and the same was recovered on 31.08.2018, 11 days after his arrest from the
accused’s house. Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer stated
during cross-examination, that photographs of the place of occurrence were
taken through a camera, and photographs of the accused persons were taken
through a mobile phone. Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer
prepared the photographs on 04.08.2018 and deposed during his

examination-in-chief that: -

eo

Crl. Appeal No.56380_of 2021
& Cri. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

The accused persons, i.e., Muhammad Bilal and Muhammad
Rizwan (since acquitted), were in the custody of the police on 04.08.2018 as
revealed from the deposition of Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating
officer Aurangzeb S.J. (PW-8)-the investigating officer and Mudassar
Shahzad 1939/C (PW-6). The appellant, Muhammad Bilal, had the
opportunity to conceal the weapon in his house. Mudassar Shahzad 1939/C
(PW-6) deposed during examination-in-chief that on 10.08.2018, the LO.
took into possession photographs, including photographs of the accused
persons. Mudassar Shahzad 1939/C (PW-6) deposed during examination-in-
chief that: -

“On 10.08.2018 I.O took into possession 09
photographs of place of occurrence, deceased
Muhammad Nadeem _and_accused_persons
P3/1-9_ through recovery memo _Ex.PN
attested by me and Shakeel Ahmed

constable.”

Mudassar Shahzad 1939/C (PW-6) deposed during cross-examination that: -

“I don’t know the date when photographs

P3/1-9 were got by the I.O via mobile phone
camera. Volunteered stated that I.O took it

into possession on 10.08.2018. In one
photographs accused Rizwan _is seen in

handcuff. Said photographs were got before
10.08.2018 due to which said were taken into

possession on 10.08.2018.”
Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer, admitted that he received
photographs from Shakeel Ahmad Constable and deposed during

examination-in-chief that: -

“Stated that on 04.08.2018, I was posted _as

--- I_also_got_ photographs of the place of
occurrence, -------- On 10.08.2018 I took into

possession photographs _P3/1-9 _ through

recovery memo Ex.PN_ attested _Mudassar
Shahzad and Shakeel Ahmed constables.”

Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-The investigating officer admitted that the
photographs were received on 10.08.2018, and the photographs of the place
14
Crl. Appeal No.56380 of 2021

& Cri. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

of occurrence and the accused persons were taken through cameras and

mobile phones. He (PW-8) deposed during cross-examination that: -

“T recorded the statement of Shakeel Ahmed

constable on 10.08.2018 regarding the
production of nine photographs by said
constable to me. Ex.P-3/1-9 are the
photographs which were produced __by
constable Shakeel _to me. Photographs
regarding the place of occurrence were taken
at the time of visit of place of occurrence and
photographs of accused persons were taken
after_their arrest. It is correct_that_in
photographs No.4 accused Rizwan is seen
while handcuffed. Again stated that I cannot
say_it surely that accused Rizwan_ is

handcuffed in said picture because no police

Photographs of place of occurrence were
taken through camera and photographs of
accused persons were taken through mobile
phone camera.”

Moreover, it is noticed that Shakeel Ahmad 21046/Constable,
who produced the photographs P-3/1-9 before Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the
investigating officer on 10.08.2018, was shown witness of the recovery
memo (Ex. PN). The scanned copy of the recovery memo of nine (9)

photographs (Ex. PN) is as follows for reference: -

I have noted that the said Shakeel Ahmad 21046/Constable was
not produced as a witness by the prosecution. Thus, it was established from
the recovery memo of possession of nine (9) photographs (Ex. PN) that
Shakeel Ahmad 21046/Constable produced the nine (9) photographs (Ex.
PN) on 10.08.2018 before Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer,
therefore, an adverse inference is to be drawn within the meaning of Article
129 (g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 that had Shakeel Ahmad
21046/Constable, been appeared as witness then his deposition would have
been unfavorable to the prosecution. Reliance is placed on the case reported
as “The State and others. v. Abdul Khalig and others” (PLD 2011 SC
554). The DNA test report, Forensic DNA and Serology Analysis
(Supplementary-I) of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Ex. PW) reveals
that sealed evidence of Buccal swab(s) of Muhammad Nadeem (the
deceased) was submitted by Aurangzeb SI. (PW-8)-the investigating officer
on 06.08.2018. Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer deposed

during examination-in-chief that: -

“PFSA team had also reached at the place of
occurrence and handed over parcels to me. I
took into possession said parcels through

recovery memo Ex.PJ attested by Mudassar
Shahzad and Shakeel Ahmed constables. I

recorded the statements of witnesses u/s 161

Whereas Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer deposed during

cross-examination that,

"Crime scene unit team had arrived at the
place_of occurrence before my arrival. I
perused documents given by crime scene
unit. Said documents are not the part of
police record/file."

Mudassar Shahzad 1939/C (PW-6) deposed during cross-examination that: -

“I don’t know the date when photographs
P3/1-9 were got by the I.O via mobile phone
16
Crl. Appeal No.56380 of 2021

& Cri. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

camera. Volunteered_ stated that I.O took it

into possession on 10.08.2018. In one
photographs accused Rizwan _is seen in

handcuff. Said photographs were got before
10.08.2018 due to which said were taken into

possession on 10.08.2018.”

The prosecution evidence remained silent about the names of
the members of the team of PFSA who handed over three parcels sealed
having insignia of PFSA to Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer
on 04.08.2018 and taken into possession through recovery memo (Ex. PJ) by
Aurangzeb SI. (PW-8)-the investigating officer and who prepared said
parcels. The prosecution failed to establish by convincing evidence when
and where the alleged parcel of Buccal swab(s) of Muhammad Nadeem (the
deceased) was secured. After securing a sealed parcel, the same was handed
over to Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer. The Crime scene
investigation report (Ex.PV) does not reveal where the team of PFSA
collected the nail swab(s) and buccal swab(s) of Muhammad Nadeem (the
deceased). As mentioned above, Mudassar Shahzad 1939/C (PW-6) and
Aurangzeb S I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer, deposed the PFSA team left
in their presence from the place of occurrence. The Crime scene
investigation report (Ex. PV) reveals that the dead body was not present at
the spot when the PFSA team arrived at the place of the occurrence at 07:00
p.m. on 04.08.2018. After that, the PFSA team visited the dead house of
Jinnah Hospital, Lahore, and the dead body of Muhammad Nadeem, the
deceased, was examined. The scanned copy of the relevant portion of the
crime scene investigation report (Ex. PV) reads as follows: -

| Scene Description:
| Crime scene unit (CSU) received a call on 04" of August, 2018 at 1900 HRS to process a homicide

scene at the above mentioned address. Upon arriving at the crime scene, the CSU team conducted initial

Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer on 04.08.2018 prepared un-

scaled site plan and he had deposed during his examination-in-chief that: -

“I prepared _un-scaled_site plan Ex. PR

egarding the place of occurrence. I also got

-- On 09.08.2018 draftsman prepared scaled
site plan in triplicate and handed over to me.
I_gave_red_ink notes. I recorded the

statement of draftsman in this regard.”
The oral testimony is contrary to the documentary evidence in
the shape of the un-scaled site plan (Exh.PR), revealing that at the bottom of

the un-scaled site plan (Exh. PR) date is mentioned 09.08.2018 and not
18

04.08.2018. Besides the un-scaled site plan (Exh. PR), scaled site plans (Ex.
PB and Ex. PB/1) revealed that the body buccal swab (s) and swab(s)
collected from both hand nails on 09.08.2018 at the point “A,” which is the
place of occurrence. The scanned copy of the un-scaled site plan (Exh. PR)

Although the site plan is not a substantive piece of evidence in terms of
Article 22 of the Qanune-e-Shahdat Order 1984 as held in the case of Mst.
Shamim Akhtar v. Fiaz Akhter and two others (PLD 1992 SC 211), but it
reflects the view of the crime scene, and the same can be used to contradict
or disbelieve eyewitnesses. All these circumstances create doubt about the
parcels prepared by the PFSA team and make the matching report of the
swab taken from the blade of Churri item # 5.1 matches the DNA profile of

Muhammad Nadeem, the deceased, doubtful.

13. Besides, a bare reading of Section 510 Cr.P.C., a report of an
expert is per se admissible without examination of the expert. It would be
appropriate to quote Section 510 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which

reads as follows: -

“510. Report of Chemical Examiner, Serologist, etc.
Any document purporting to be a report, under the hand

of any Chemical Examiner or Assistant Chemical
Examiner to Government [or of the Chief Chemist of
Pakistan Security Printing Corporation, Limited] or any
Serologist, fingerprint expert or fire-arm expert or the
Chemist or the Pharmacist or the Forensic Scientist or
Hand-writing expert appointed by Government upon
any matter or thing duly submitted to him for
examination or analysis and report in the course of any
proceeding under this Code, may without calling him as
a witness, be used as evidence in any inquiry, trial or
other proceeding under this Code: Provided that the
Court may [if it considers necessary in the interest of
20
Crl. Appeal No.56380 of 2021

& Cri. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

justice] summon and examine the person by whom such
report has been made. ].”

A bare reading of this Section makes it abundantly clear that the
reports of the Chemical Examiner or Assistant Chemical Examiner to the
Government [or of the Chief Chemist of Pakistan Security Printing
Corporation, Limited] or any Serologist, fingerprint expert, or fire-arm
expert or the Chemist or the Pharmacist or the Forensic Scientist or Hand-
writing expert are admissible per se without they being formally proved by
the person who has made the same. It is in prosecution evidence that a team
consisting of the members of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency inspected
the place of occurrence, collected evidence, prepared three parcels
separately, and handed them over to Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the
investigating officer. The members of the PFSA team are not officers
covered by Section 510 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and thus, the
positive report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Ex. PW) is not
conclusive and reliable in the absence of the officers above being examined.
in Court, who collected and prepared the parcels from the spot and prepared.
separate parcels to prove the fact that they collected evidence from the place
of the occurrence and after that, they prepared parcels which were handed
over to Aurangzaib, S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer. The report in
question is of no help to the prosecution as there is nothing on record to
prove that the three parcels alleged to have been made by the members of
the PFSA team on the spot. Thus, there can be no dispute that it was
incumbent upon the prosecution to produce members of the PFSA team who
collected the crime empties and prepared separate parcels to prove the chain
of safe custody. Without such proof, the PFSA report cannot corroborate the

prosecution's case.

14. The motive set up by the prosecution in the Fard Beyan (Exh.
PA) and F.LR. (Exh. PH), brought on the record through the deposition of
Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant and Allah Ditta (PW-2) is that
day before the occurrence the accused persons purchased mangoes from

Muhammad Nadeem, the deceased and some mangoes were found rotten
21
Crl. Appeal No.56380_of 2021

& Cri. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

due to the said reasons the accused persons gave threats of dire
consequences to the deceased. To substantiate the motive part of the case,
the prosecution produced Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant. In
the cross-examination of Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant

deposed as under: -

“I did not give any application regarding
motive part of the occurrence at police
station. In EX.PA I did not mention the time
of motive part fight. In my evidence in court
I did not give said time. In Ex.PA I did not
give the name of witnesses of motive part of
occurrence. in my statement in this court I
have not mentioned names of the witnesses

of motive part fight.”
The defence brought on the record contradictions and conflicts in the

evidence of Allah Ditta (PW-2); he deposed during cross-examination that: -

6

‘In my statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. I did not
submit that complainant was also used to sell
fruit at his wheelbherro beside me. I told the
police that deceased _was also used to sell

mangoes near by me on his loader Rikshaw.
Confronted with Ex.DA where it is not so

recorded. I told the I.O about the first aid
which was given to the injured at spot.
Confronted with Ex.DA where it is not so
recorded. I told police about the motive part
that accused persons committed the murder
of deceased due to the dispute of rotten
mangoes. Confronted with Exh.DA where
motive part is not so recorded. I did not tell
the I.O about the threats given by the
accused persons before one day of the
occurrence in my statement u/s 161 Cr.PC.
Time of quarrel, which took place before one
day of the occurrence, is not remember to
me. I did not give any application regarding
the quarrel which took place before one day
prior to the occurrence. Except me and
Saleem_no_other_witnesses_ regarding the
fight, which took place before one day of the
occurrence, appeared before police. It is
correct that on my CNIC residential address
is mentioned Hujra Shah Mugeem Tehsil
22
Crl. Appeal No.56380 of 2021

& Cri. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

Deepalpur District Okara. Police recorded
my statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. I gave same
address to the police while got recording my

statement. I repeated_same address in this
court.”

Therefore, the evidence led by the prosecution in connection
with the motive is not sufficient to place reliance on the testimonies of the
witnesses for committing the occurrence. Motive is a double-edged weapon
for the occurrence and also for false implication. Different motives always
operate in the person's mind when making false accusations. In the
circumstances, I cannot avoid the conclusion that the alleged motive was an

afterthought and has not been proved by any credible evidence.

15. As it is difficult to rely upon the testimonies of Muhammad.
Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant, Allah Ditta (PW-2), and Aurangzeb, S_I.
(PW-8)-the investigating officer and for other reasons enumerated
hereinbefore, I am persuaded to hold that the prosecution had not been able
to prove its case against the appellant, Muhammad Bilal, beyond shadow of
doubt as there were many dents in the prosecution story. The conviction and
sentence the learned trial court recorded cannot be sustained. Reliance has
been placed on the case reported as “Muhammad Akram v. The State”
(2009 SCMR 230), wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has held
that even a single circumstance creating reasonable doubts in a prudent mind
about the guilt of the accused makes him entitled to the benefit, not as a

matter of grace and concession but as a matter of right.

16. The upshot of the above discussion is that the prosecution had
severely failed to bring home a charge against the appellant, Muhammad
Bilal, beyond any reasonable doubt; therefore, in the interest of the safe
administration of Criminal Justice, Criminal Appeal No.56380 of 2021 filed
by Muhammad Bilal, the appellant is accepted in toto. The conviction and
sentence awarded by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore vide
judgment dated 16.06.2021 is set aside, and the appellant, Muhammad Bilal,
is ordered to be acquitted of the charge in case FIR No.724 of 2018 dated
04.08.2018 offence under sections 302, 34 PPC registered at Police Station
23
Crl. Appeal No.56380 of 2021

& Cri. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

Township, District Lahore and the appellant-Muhammad Bilal is directed to

be released forthwith, if not required in any other criminal case.

17. So far as Crl.Rev.No.42144 of 2021 seeking enhancement in
the sentence of respondent No.1 inflicted by the trial court is concerned, for
the afore-stated reasons, the same has no weight, which is accordingly

dismissed.

18. Prima facie, this Court does not find the Investigating Officer to
have performed his duties of conducting a fair investigation. The
investigation must be honest and transparent, as it is the minimum
requirement of the Rule of law. The investigating agency cannot investigate
in a tainted and biased manner. A copy of this Judgment shall be sent to the
CCPO, Lahore, to look into the conduct of the investigating officer and the

investigation conducted by him.
