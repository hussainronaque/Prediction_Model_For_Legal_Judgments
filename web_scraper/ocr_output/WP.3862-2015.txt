MUHAMMAD YOUNIS THAHEEM, _J.-

Through the instant constitutional petition, petitioner
has called in question the impugned order dated
05.11.2015 passed by learned Justice of the Peace/
Additional District Judge-II, Takhbhai whereby
application of the petitioner u/s 22-A Cr.PC was

dismissed.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on 28.10.2015

at 15:15 hours, accused Sheraz alongwith others duly
armed with deadly weapons stormed at the house of

petitioner and made firing upon petitioner, his brother

Jan Alam and one Babar with the intention to kill them

but they luckily escaped unhurt, however one accused

namely Sheraz got injured from the firing of his own

companions. To this effect petitioner went to the police

station for reporting the matter but there a case against

the petitioner, his brother Jan Alam and Babar has

already been registered by the local police on the basis

of malafide and arrested them. The petitioner requested

to local police for registration of case against the

accused Sheraz etc but in vain. The petitioner then

approached to the Court of learned Justice of Peace by

filing application u/s 22-A Cr.PC but the same was

turned down vide impugned order dated 05.11.2015,

hence this petition.

3. Preliminary arguments heard and _ record

perused.
4. It is evident from the record that the petitioner

filed an application u/s 22-A Cr.PC for registration of

case against the accused persons for attempt to commit

their Qatl-e-Amd but the respondents did not lodge the

report, as the accused persons have already registered a

case FIR No.398 against the petitioner and others u/s

324/34 PPC. It is also borne out from the record that

brother of the petitioner namely Riaz Alam Shah has

preferred an application for registration of the case

before DIG, Mardan alleging therein that he and his

brothers have dispute over landed property with Sheraz

etc and to settle the matter, Sheraz and others duly

armed came to their house made indiscriminate firing

upon them and they also made firing in self defence as

a result of which accused Sheraz got hit and sustained

injuries. So the stance tak en by the petitioner in the

petition filed before the learned Additional Sessions

Judge u/s 22-A Cr.PC and the allegations made in

application preferred to DIG by his brother Riaz Alam

Shah are conflict each other. Instead of application u/s
4

22-A Cr.PC they should file a criminal complainant by

adopting legal course if so he desires. Hence, the

learned Court below has rightly dismissed the

application of the petitioner u/s 22-A Cr.PC, and this

Court is not inclined to interfere with the impugned

order.
5. Thus the instant petition is dismissed in
limine.
Announced.
