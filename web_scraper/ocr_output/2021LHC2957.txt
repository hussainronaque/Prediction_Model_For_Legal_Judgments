the impugned judgment of the learned trial Court.)

However, vide the same impugned judgment, Khan Ameer
Khan, Amanullah Khan and Qudratullah Khan (co-accused), were
acquitted by the learned trial Court while extending them the benefit
of doubt.

3. Brief facts of the case as given by the complainant Tariq
Mehmood (PW-16) in his complaint Ex.PS on the basis of which, the
formal FIR Ex.PS/1 was chalked out, are that he (complainant) was
employee of Irrigation department. Asif Mehmood (deceased) was
his younger brother, who was driver of Shahzor “Dala” bearing
registration No.SGS-1333. On 05.10.2010, at about 4.00 p.m, Asif
Mehmood (deceased) told one Ghulam Abbas, who was also a driver
of “Dala” bearing registration No.SGP-2165, that he (Asif Mehmood
deceased) along with the companions of one Nazeer alias Jeera was
going to village Blot Sharif in order to get vegetables. Asif Mehmood
deceased did not return back to his house on that day. On 09.10.2010,
Cri. Appeal No.1036/2013 3
Cri. Revision No.724/2013

the complainant along with Raza Muhammad (PW-13) and Attaullah
(PW since given-up) went to village Blot Sharif in search of Asif
Mehmood (deceased) and in the way, they came to know that dead
body of an unknown person was present in Nala Umarwala near
Chasma Barrage. The complainant along with the PWs reached at the
abovementioned place and identified the dead body Asif Mehmood
deceased. They (PWs) shifted the dead body to the Civil Hosptial,
Mainwali on “Dala”. There was also a rope around the neck of the
deceased and no shirt was present on the dead body rather the same
was lying near the dead body. The complainant further alleged that
the unknown accused committed the murder of his brother while

strangulating his neck.

Initially the FIR was lodged against the unknown accused but
subsequently, on the basis of statements of the witnesses of last seen
evidence, namely, Muhammad Imran (PW-4), Muhammad Nawaz
(PW-5), Ghulam Hassan, 2265/C (PW.12), the appellant along with
Khan Ameer Khan, Amanullah Khan and Qudratullah Khan (co-
accused since acquitted) was implicated in this case. The prosecution
subsequently also introduced the evidence of eye-witnesses in this
case through Raza Muhammad (PW.13) and Dost Muhammad
(PW.14), as well as, evidence of identification of the appellant and
his co-accused during the identification parade through the above-

referred eye-witnesses.

4. The appellant was arrested in this case by the police on
21.10.2010 and after completion of investigation the challan was
prepared and submitted before the learned trial court. The learned
trial Court, after observing legal formalities, as provided under the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 framed charge against the
appellant to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order to
prove its case the prosecution produced twenty two witnesses.
Prosecution also produced documentary evidence in the shape of
Ex.PA to Ex.PZ. The statement of the appellant under section 342

Cr.P.C, was recorded, wherein he refuted the allegations levelled
Crl. Appeal No.1036/2013 4
Cri. Revision No.724/2013

against him and professed his innocence, however, no defence

evidence was produced by the appellant in this case.

5. The learned trial Court vide impugned judgment dated
26.06.2013, found the appellant guilty, convicted and sentenced him

as mentioned and detailed above.

6. It is contended by learned counsel for the appellant that
statements of Raza Muhammad (PW.13) and Dost Muhammad
(PW.14) who were subsequently introduced by the prosecution as
eye-witnesses of the occurrence, are not trustworthy because the said
witnesses remained mum for a period of eight days after the
occurrence and for a period of four days after attending funeral
ceremony of Asif Mehmood (deceased); that apart from the evidence
of above mentioned eye-witnesses, the prosecution case is based
upon very weak type of circumstantial evidence which is not worthy
of reliance; that the prosecution witnesses of last seen evidence also
made their statements before the police with considerable delay and
as such their evidence is highly doubtful; that the learned trial Court
has rightly disbelieved the statements of the alleged eye-witnesses of
the occurrence, as well as, witnesses of last seen evidence in
Paragraphs No.18 to 28 of the impugned judgment but the appellant
has been convicted and sentenced on the basis of evidence of
Ghulam Hassan, 2265/C (PW.12) who was also the witness of last
seen evidence; that the above mentioned witness did not state that he
saw the appellant in the company of Asif Mehmood (deceased) and
he only stated that he saw the appellant in the company of a driver of
“Dala” bearing registration No. SGS-1333 but he did not disclose the
name of the said driver; that even the above mentioned “Dala” (carry
van) was not recovered from the possession of the appellant or his
co-accused; that no motive could be proved against the appellant by
the prosecution witnesses and alleged recovery of Rs.21,500/- from
the possession of the appellant is inconsequential because there was
no allegation that any cash amount was snatched by the accused

persons from the deceased; that there is no evidence of extrajudicial
Crl. Appeal No.1036/2013 5
Cri. Revision No.724/2013

confession or evidence of “Wajtaker” against the appellant or his co-
accused; that the prosecution could not prove its case against the
appellant beyond the shadow of doubt, therefore, this appeal may be

accepted and the appellant may be acquitted from the charge.

7. On the other hand, it is argued by learned Additional
Prosecutor General for the State assisted by learned counsel for the
complainant that the prosecution has proved its case against the
appellant beyond the shadow of any doubt through reliable and
trustworthy circumstantial evidence, as well as, evidence of eye-
witnesses, namely, Raza Muhammad (PW.13) and Dost Muhammad
(PW.14), therefore, he was rightly convicted and sentenced by the
learned trial Court; that the appellant was also identified by Raza
Muhammad (PW.13) and Dost Muhammad (PW.14) during the
identification parade; that the prosecution case against the appellant
is further proved through the statements of prosecution witnesses of
last seen evidence, namely, Muhammad Imran (PW.4), Muhammad
Nawaz (PW.5) and Ghulam Hassan, 2265/C (PW.12); that the motive
of snatching of vehicle of the deceased by the appellant and his co-
accused and sale of the said vehicle to Khan Ameer Khan, co-
accused (since acquitted) was also proved through reliable evidence
of Pervaiz Iqbal (PW.17) and Nematullah (PW.22); that the
prosecution case against the appellant is also corroborated by the
recovery of Rs.21,500/- from the possession of the appellant which
was sale proceed of “Dala” snatched from the deceased; that the
appellant could not establish any mala-fide against the prosecution
witnesses for his false involvement in this case; that there is no
substance in the appeal of Waheed Khan (appellant), therefore, the
same may be dismissed. Insofar as Crl. Revision No.724 of 2013 is
concerned, learned counsel for the complainant has argued that there
was no mitigating circumstance in this case, therefore, normal

penalty of death may be awarded to the convict.

8. Arguments heard and record perused.
Cri. Appeal No.1036/2013 6
Cri. Revision No.724/2013

9. The detail of the prosecution case has already been given in
paragraph No.3 of this judgment, therefore, there is no need to repeat

the same.

10. The prosecution case is based upon the following two types of

evidence:

A) Direct evidence of eye-witnesses and identification of
the appellant and his co-accused during identification

parade through the eye-witnesses.

B) — Circumstantial Evidence.

First of all, I take up the evidence of eye-witnesses and
identification of the appellant by said witnesses in identification

parade.

A) Evidence of eye-witnesses and I.D. Parade

11. Insofar as the prosecution evidence of eye-witnesses of the
occurrence produced through Raza Muhammad (PW.13) and Dost
Muhammad (PW.14) is concerned, I have noted that both the above
mentioned prosecution witnesses stated that on 05.10.2010 at 8:30
P.M., they were coming back towards their village after paying
“salam” at the Shrine of Bolt Sharif and when they reached on the
eastern “Patri” of canal Umarwala, they saw three unknown accused
persons who were giving beating to a person and they (accused) had
also put a rope around his neck. The above mentioned prosecution
eye-witnesses further stated that within their view, the said three
unknown accused persons threw the body of the above mentioned
person in the canal and thereafter went away while boarding on a
Shahzor “Dala’”. They also stated that they did not intervene as they
were threatened by the above mentioned unknown accused persons.
They further stated that later on, they identified the appellant and his

co-accused during the identification parade held on 28.10.2010.

It is evident from the perusal of the statement made by Raza

Muhammad (PW.13) during his cross-examination that Asif
Crl. Appeal No.1036/2013 7
Cri. Revision No.724/2013

Mehmood (deceased) was ‘Bhanja’ as well as, ‘Damad’ of the said
witness. Relevant part of his statement in this respect reads as

under:-

“After offering Janaza prayer of Asif Mehmood
deceased when I was in graveyard I came to know
from the participants of Janaza prayer about the name
of the deceased. (This portion of the statement of
witness read over to witness, he stated that he did not
state so rather he stated that as deceased Asif
Mehmood was my Bhanja and Damad and he has

already knowledge of the name of deceased.”

Raza Muhammad (PW.13) claimed that he alongwith Dost
Muhammad (PW.14) had seen three unknown accused persons while
giving beating to a person on the night of occurrence i.e. on
05.10.2010 at 8:30 P.M. and also identified the said unknown
accused persons with the help of their features and ages in the light
of his motorcycle but surprisingly he could not identify his own
‘Damad’ and nephew, namely, Asif Mehmood (deceased) at that
time. He did not state that he also identified that it was Asif
Mehmood (deceased) who was being beaten by the unknown
accused persons and his dead body was thrown in the canal. He
simply stated that he saw the accused persons while beating a
person, and throwing his body in the canal. It is further noteworthy
that Raza Muhammad (PW.13) and Dost Muhammad (PW.14) saw
the occurrence of a heinous crime of murder on 05.10.2010 but they
made their statements before the police for the first time on
13.10.2010 i.e. with the delay of eight (08) days from the occurrence.
Both the above mentioned prosecution eye-witnesses stated that they
also attended funeral ceremony of Asif Mehmood (deceased) on
09.10.2010 but even then they remained mum till 13.10.2010 ie. for
a period of four days even after attending funeral ceremony of the
deceased and did not make the statements before the police. Relevant

parts of the statements of the above mentioned prosecution eye-
Crl. Appeal No.1036/2013 8
Cri. Revision No.724/2013

witnesses in this respect are reproduced hereunder for ready
reference:-
Raza Muhammad (PW_13)
“On 09.10.2010 we came to the funeral prayer of
Asif Mehmood deceased and we told Tariq
Mehmood that we had seen the Dala and killing of
Asif Mehmood on 05.10.2010 and we went to the
P.S. on 13.10.2010 where I made my statement
before Abdul Ghafoor SI.”

Dost Muhammad (PW.14)

“On 09.10.2010 we went to perform funeral
ceremony of Asif Mehmood deceased of this case
where we told Tariq Mehmood complainant about
what we had seen on 05.10.2010 at the Patri canal
Umarwala. I made my statement to the IO on

13.10.2010.”

It is evident from the perusal of the statements of the above
mentioned eye-witnesses that they remained mum for a period of
eight (08) days after the occurrence and even after attending funeral
ceremony of Asif Mehmood (deceased), they remained mum for a
period of four days. They did not give any plausible reason for
remaining silent during the above mentioned period. The said delay
in making statements before the police by the above mentioned
prosecution eye-witnesses has created serious doubt regarding the
truthfulness of their evidence. Reliance in this respect may be placed
upon the judgments reported as “Muhammad Safdar Bhatti Vs. The
State” (1987 SCMR 1215) and “Muhammad Sharifan Bibi_Vs.
Muhammad Yasin and others” (2012 SCMR 82).

It is true that both the above mentioned prosecution witnesses
claimed that they identified the appellant during the identification
parade but it is noteworthy that the appellant was nominated in this
case through the statements of witnesses of last seen evidence,
namely, Muhammad Imran (PW.4) and Muhammad Nawaz (PW°5)

on 12.10.2010, whereas the identification parade of the appellant was
Cri. Appeal No.1036/2013 9
Cri. Revision No.724/2013

held on 28.10.2010. Under the circumstances, identification of the
appellant through identification parade after his nomination in this
case is highly doubtful and unreliable. Reference in this context may
be made to the judgments reported as “Amanat Ali alias Amanti Vs.
The State” (2013 YLR 1959), “The State Vs. Mukhtar Ahmad and 5
others” (2015 M LD 1840) and “‘Naseeb Ullah Vs. The State” (2012
YLR 2570).

Moreover, it is not understandable that if direct evidence of
eye-witnesses was available with the prosecution then as to why the
circumstantial evidence was also produced in this case. It shows that
the prosecution itself was doubtful about the credibility of evidence
of above mentioned eye-witnesses, therefore, it also chose to
produce circumstantial evidence in this case. I have further noted
that the evidence of the above mentioned prosecution eye-witnesses,
namely, Raza Muhammad (PW.13) and Dost Muhammad (PW.14)
has also been disbelieved by the learned trial Court in paragraph
No.24 of the impugned judgment. I am, therefore, of the view that
the evidence of the above mentioned prosecution eye-witnesses and
evidence of identification of the appellant during the identification
parade held on 28.10.2010 through the above-referred eye-witnesses

are not worthy of reliance.

B) Circumstantial Evidence

12. Insofar as the circumstantial evidence produced in this case by
the prosecution is concerned, it is settled by now that in such like
cases every circumstance should be linked with each other and it
should form such a continuous chain that its one end touches the
dead body and other to the neck of the accused. But if any link in
the chain is missing then its benefit must go to the accused. In this
regard, guidance has been sought from the judgments of the Apex
Court of the country reported as ‘Ch. Barkat Ali vs. Major
KaramElahi Zia and antoher’ (1992 SCMR 1047), ‘Sarfraz Khan
Vs. The State’ (1996 SCMR 188) and ‘Asadullah_ and another vs.
The State’ (PLJ 1999 SC 1018). In the case of Ch. Barkat Ali

Crl. Appeal No.1036/2013 10
Cri. Revision No.724/2013

(supra), the august Supreme Court of Pakistan, at page 1055,

observed as under:-

“...Law relating to circumstantial evidence that proved
circumstances must be incompatible with any
reasonable hypothesis of the innocence of the accused.

See ‘Siraj vs. The Crown’ (PLD 1956 FC 123). Ina

case of circumstantial evidence, the rule is that no link
in the chain should be broken and that the
circumstances should be such as cannot be explained
away on any hypothesis other than the guilt of the

accused.’

In the case of Sarfraz Khan (supra), the august Supreme

Court of Pakistan, at page 192, held as under:-

7....It is well settled that circumstantial evidence should
be so inter-connected that it forms such a continuous
chain that its one end touches the dead body and other to
the neck of the accused thereby excluding all the

hypothesis of his innocence.’

Further reliance in this context is placed on the case of ‘Altaf
Hussain vs. Fakhar Hussain _and_another’(2008 SCMR_ 1103)

wherein, at page 1105 it was held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court as

under:-

7....Needless to emphasis that all the pieces of evidence
should be so linked that it should give the picture of a
complete chain, one corner of which should touch the
body of the deceased and other corner to the neck of the
accused. Failure of one link will destroy the entire

chain.’

Seeking guidance from the above-referred judgments of the Apex
Court of the Country, I proceed to discuss separately, every piece of
circumstantial evidence produced in this case by the prosecution. It is
noteworthy that the circumstantial evidence of the prosecution is

based upon the following pieces of evidence:-

1) Last seen evidence.
Crl. Appeal No.1036/2013 11
Cri. Revision No.724/2013

2) Motive & recovery of Rs.21,500/- from the
appellant.

3) Recovery of pistol.

4) Medical evidence.

Last seen evidence.

13. Last seen evidence of the prosecution has been produced
through Muhammad Imran (PW.4), Muhammad Nawaz (PW.5),
Ghulam Hassan, 2265/C (PW.12). I have noted that Muhammad
Imran (PW.4) and Muhammad Nawaz (PW.5) stated that on
05.10.2010 at 4:30 P.M. they saw Asif Mehmood (deceased) in the
company of appellant and his co-accused at Kundian Filling Station
situated at Chashma Barrage road. They further stated that on
10.10.2010, they came to know that Asif Mehmood (deceased) had
been murdered, whereupon they proceeded to Mianwali and reached
there on 11.10.2010 whereafter they informed the complainant. They
next stated that they made their statements before the police on
12.10.2010. Muhammad Imran (PW.4) during his examination-in-
chief stated that he alongwith other PW went to the house of the
complainant for giving information on 11.10.2010 at 11:00 P.M. but
during his cross-examination, he stated that they (PWs) reached the
house of the complainant on 11.10.2010 at 5:30 A.M. He further
stated during his cross-examination that police station was situated
only at a distance of 2/3 kilometers from the residence of the
complainant but even then they made their statements before the
police on 12.10.2010 i.e. on the next day. Both the above mentioned
prosecution witnesses also stated during their cross-examination that
they remained busy in conversation with each other regarding the
facts of occurrence after reaching the house of the complainant on
11.10.2010. The relevant parts of the statements of Muhammad
Imran (PW.4) and Muhammad Nawaz (PW.5) read as under:-

Muhammad Imran (PW.4) (examination in chief);
“On 10.10.2010 we came to know that Muhammad Asif

has died and his dead body was recovered. On receiving

this information we left our oil tanker at Mahmood Koat
Crl. Appeal No.1036/2013

Cri. Revision No.724/2013

and came back to Mianwali on a car and went to the house
of Tariq Mahmood complainant. we reached Mianwali on
11.10.2010 and informed complainant at 11:00 p.m. that
we saw Asif deceased in the company of Waheed, Qudrat
Ullah and Aman Ullah. I recorded my statement before the
police on 12.10.2010.”

made during his cross-examination, read as under:-

“We went to the house of complainant for giving

information on 11.10.2010 at 5:30 a.m.”

“P.S is at the distance of 2/3 kms from the residence of
complainant. I have not made statement before the police
on 11.10.2010. Before making statement before the police I
remained in the house of complainant for night. We
remained busy in conversation with each other regarding
the facts of the occurrence. I went to police for making

statement on 12.10.2010.”

Muhammad Nawaz (PW..5) (examination in chief)
“On 10.10.2010 we came to know that Asif has died. We

received this information when we were at Mahmood Koat.
Muhammad Imran handed over his oil tanker to driver and
I alongwith him left for Mianwali on a car and reached
Mianwali early in the morning on 11.10.2010. We
remained busy in Qul ceremony of the deceased and later
on we informed complainant this fact after performing Quill
Sharif. I recorded my statement before the police on

12.10.2010.”

made during his cross-examination, reads as under:-

“We reached the house of complainant on 11.10.2010 at
Fajr time. About 100 persons were present at the house of
complainant at that time. We talked about the occurrence

after Qull on that day. Qull ended at about 8:00 a.m. I made

12

Relevant parts of the statement of Muhammad Imran (PW.4)

Relevant part of the statement of Muhammad Nawaz (PW.5)
Cri. Appeal No.1036/2013 13
Cri. Revision No.724/2013

statement before the police on 12.10.2010. We remained
busy in talking with each in the house of complainant about

the facts of occurrence.”

It is, therefore, evident from the perusal of above mentioned
evidence that in-spite of reaching in the house of the complainant on
11.10.2010 at 5:30 A.M/Fajr time, both the above mentioned
prosecution witnesses did not inform the police that they had lastly
seen Asif Mehmood (deceased) in the company of the appellant and
his co-accused on 05.10.2010, rather both the above mentioned
witnesses and the complainant remained busy in talking with each
other about the occurrence in the house of the complainant and made
their statements before the police on 12.10.2010. The police station
was situated at the distance of only 2/3 K.Ms from the house of the
complainant. Under the circumstances, there was every possibility of
deliberations and concoctions and the evidence of the above
mentioned prosecution witnesses of last seen evidence is not free

from doubt.

The delay in making statements by the above mentioned
prosecution witnesses before the police without any valid reason has
created serious doubt regarding the truthfulness of their evidence. In
the light of above, the prosecution’s last seen evidence produced
through Muhammad Imran (PW.4) and Muhammad Nawaz (PW.5)
is untrustworthy and the same has rightly been disbelieved by the

trial Court in Paragraph Nos.18 to 20 of the impugned judgment.

It is however, noteworthy that the learned trial Court
convicted and sentenced the appellant on the basis of last seen
evidence of Ghulam Hassan 2265/C (PW.12). Insofar as the
evidence of last seen produced by the prosecution through Ghulam
Hassan, 2265/C (PW.12) is concerned, it is noteworthy that Ghulam
Hassan 2265/C (PW.12) stated that on 05.10.2010, he was on duty at
Check Post, Eastern Head Chashma when he stopped Shahzor
“Dala” bearing Registration No.SGS-1333 coming from Mianwali
side. He further stated that on presentation of I.D. Card by Waheed.
Crl. Appeal No.1036/2013 14
Cri. Revision No.724/2013

Khan, Constable/appellant, who was present in the above mentioned
Shahzor “Dala”, he permitted the appellant and his co-accused to
proceed ahead. He next stated that a driver was also present in the
above-referred Shahzor “Dala’’. The statement of Ghulam Hassan,
2265/C (PW.12) is of no avail to the prosecution because he did not
name the driver of the above mentioned vehicle. He did not state
during his entire statement that Asif Mehmood (deceased) was
driving the above-referred vehicle at the relevant time, therefore, it
cannot be held on the basis of mere guesswork that it was Asif
Mehmood (deceased) who was seen by the said witness in the
company of the appellant on the day of occurrence. It is further
noteworthy that Shahzor “Dala” bearing registration No.SGS-1333
has not been recovered from the possession of the appellant or his

co-accused during the investigation of this case.

Keeping in view all the above mentioned facts, the

prosecution’s last seen evidence is not worthy of reliance.

Motive & Recovery of Rs.21,500/-

14. Prosecution evidence qua motive and recovery of Rs.21,500/-
are interconnected, therefore, I proceed to discuss these pieces of
evidence together. The learned Additional Prosecutor General for the
State assisted by learned counsel for the complainant has argued that
during the investigation of this case, it transpired that the appellant
and his co-accused committed the murder of Asif Mehmood
(deceased) as they snatched Shahzor “Dala” bearing Registration
No.SGS-1333 from the deceased and sold the said vehicle to Khan
Ameer Khan, co-accused (since acquitted) but as mentioned earlier,
the above mentioned vehicle has not been recovered from the
possession of the appellant or his co-accused during the investigation
of this case. The prosecution has produced the evidence of alleged
motive through Pervaiz Iqbal (PW.17) and Nematullah (PW.22).
Both the above mentioned prosecution witnesses stated that on
05.10.2010, they both were taking tea at a hotel situated at Adda Blot

Sharif, where they saw that Khan Ameer Khan, co-accused (since
Crl. Appeal No.1036/2013 15
Cri. Revision No.724/2013

acquitted) gave Rs.85,000/- to Qudrat Ullah, co-accused (since
acquitted) whereupon Qudrat Ullah, co-accused (since acquitted)
delivered key of Shahzor “Dala” bearing registration No.SGS-1333
of the deceased to Khan Ameer Khan (co-accused since acquitted).
They further stated that Waheed Khan (appellant) was also present
alongwith his above mentioned co-accused at that time. Pervaiz Iqbal
(PW.17) stated in his cross-examination that information regarding
murder of Asif Mehmood (deceased) was received by him on
09.10.2010 and even his ‘Beithak’ was used for the funeral
ceremony of Asif Mehmood (deceased) but he made his statement
before the police on 14.10.2010. Relevant parts of the statement of
Pervaiz Iqbal (PW.17) read as under:-

“On 09.10.2010 information of murder of Asif
Mehmood, deceased was received to me. Information
was furnished to me by my family members. My family
members including women of my family and my
brothers might be attended funeral ceremonies of Asif
Mehmood deceased. It is correct that my Baithak was
being used in the funeral ceremony of Asif Mehmood

deceased.”

“On 14.10.2010 I and Naimatullah PW went to Tariq
Mehmood complainant and during talk we told the
complainant that on 05.10.2010 accused Waheed Khan
etc. were selling a Shahzor Dala No.SGS-1333 to Khan
Ameer Khan accused then the complainant told us that
Shahzor Dala SGS-1333 was sold to Khan Ameer Khan
by Waheed Khan, Qudratullah Khan and Amanullah
Khan accused and it was the same Dala on which my

deceased brother was a driver.”

The statement of Nematullah (PW.22) is also on the same lines
except that Nematullah (PW.22) stated that he received the
information regarding the murder of Asif Mehmood (deceased) on
14.10.2010. It is, therefore, evident from the perusal of the
statements of the above mentioned prosecution witnesses that

Pervaiz Iqbal (PW.17) received the information of the murder of
Cri. Appeal No.1036/2013 16
Cri. Revision No.724/2013

Asif Mehmood (deceased) on 09.10.2010 and even ‘Baithak’ of the
said witness was used for funeral ceremony of the deceased but he
did not make statement before the police till 14.10.2010 ie. for a
period of five days. Nematullah (PW.22) was a conductor at the
wagon of Pervaiz Iqbal (PW.17). It is not probable that if, Pervaiz
Iqbal (PW.17) had received the information regarding the murder of
Asif Mehmood (deceased) on 09.10.2010 and his ‘Baithak’ was also
used for the funeral ceremony of Asif Mehmood (deceased) then
Nematullah (PW.22) would not get the information regarding the
murder of Asif Mehmood (deceased) till 14.10.2010. The delay in
making statements before the police by the above mentioned
prosecution witnesses without any valid reason has also made their

statements highly doubtful and un-reliable.

15. Insofar as the recovery of Rs.21,500/- from the possession of
the appellant is concerned, it is noteworthy that according to the
prosecution case, the above mentioned amount was recovered from
the possession of the appellant as the same was sale proceed of the
vehicle of the deceased i.e. Shahzor “Dala” SGS-1333 which was
sold by the appellant and co-accused to Khan Ameer Khan, co-
accused (since acquitted). The evidence produced by the prosecution
in this respect through Pervaiz Iqbal (PW.17) and Nematullah
(PW.22) has already been held to be highly doubtful and unreliable
due to the reasons mentioned in Paragraph No.14 above. As
mentioned earlier, the above-referred vehicle has not been recovered
from the possession of the appellant or the above mentioned Khan
Ameer Khan, co-accused. No documentary proof regarding
sale/purchase of the vehicle in question by the appellant and his co-
accused to the above mentioned Khan Ameer Khan, co-accused has
been produced in evidence by the prosecution. It is not believable
that Khan Ameer Khan, co-accused (since acquitted) would purchase
vehicle from the appellant and his co-accused without any
documentation. None of the prosecution witnesses mentioned in their
statements recorded by the learned trial Court any specific

identification marks, denominations or the numbers of the currency
Crl. Appeal No.1036/2013 17
Cri. Revision No.724/2013

notes which were handed over by Khan Ameer Khan, co-accused to
Qudrat Ullah, co-accused. Moreover, as per prosecution evidence,
the amount of Rs.85,000/- was handed over by Khan Ameer Khan,
co-accused to Qudrat Ullah, co-accused and the said amount was not
handed over to the appellant. The appellant was merely present at the
relevant time. In the light of above discussion, the motive alleged by
the prosecution could not be proved in this case and alleged recovery
of Rs.21,500/- from the possession of the appellant is

inconsequential.

Recovery of Pistol
16. Insofar as the recovery of pistol (P-10) from the possession of

the appellant is concerned, it is an admitted fact that the said pistol
was not used during the occurrence because as per prosecution case
and medical evidence, the death of Asif Mehmood (deceased) was
caused by asphyxia due to strangulation. In the light of above, the
alleged recovery of pistol (P-10) from the possession of the appellant

is of no avail to the prosecution.

Medical evidence

17. Insofar as the medical evidence of the prosecution is
concerned, it is by now well settled that medical evidence is a type of
supporting evidence, which may confirm the prosecution version
with regard to receipt of injury, nature of the injury, kind of weapon
used in the occurrence but it would not identify the assailant.
Reference in this context may be made to the cases of “Muhammad
Tasaweer Vs. Hafiz Zulkarnain and 2 others” (PLD 2009 Supreme
Court 53), “Altaf Hussain Vs. Fakhar Hussain and another” (2008
SCMR 1103) and “Mursal Kazmi_alias Qamar Shah and another
Vs. The State” (2009 SCMR 1410).

18. Ihave considered all the aspects of this case and have come to
this irresistible conclusion that the prosecution could not prove its
case against the appellant (Waheed Khan) beyond the shadow of
doubt.
Crl. Appeal No.1036/2013 18
Cri. Revision No.724/2013

19. In the light of above discussion, I accept Criminal Appeal
No.1036 of 2013 filed by the appellant (Waheed Khan), set aside his
conviction and sentence recorded by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge, Mianwali vide impugned judgment dated 26.06.2013 and
acquit him of all the charges by extending him the benefit of doubt.
Waheed Khan (appellant) is in custody, he be released forthwith, if

not required in any other case.

20. Insofar as Criminal Revision No.724 of 2013 filed by the
complainant is concerned, I have already disbelieved the prosecution
evidence for the reasons recorded in paragraphs Nos.11 to 16 of this
judgment, consequently, the appellant has been acquitted from the
charge by giving him the benefit of doubt, therefore, the instant

criminal revision without any substance, is hereby dismissed.
