JUDGMENT

SHAHID KHAN, J. The subject judgment shall

dispose of the — criminal appeal of
convicts/appellants, Naik Awaz & Umer Zaman
coupled with the Criminal Revision No.212-P/202]
under section 439 Cr.P.C for enhancement of the
sentences of life imprisonment awarded to the
convicts/appellants, in respect of case vide FIR
No.72, dated 29.01.2013, under section
302/324/148/149 PPC registered in Police Station

Pabbi (Nowshera).

2. The case of the prosecution in a small
compass is that complainant reported the event to
Karim Dad Khan ASI, duty police officer at
casualty department, Civil Hospital, Pabbi
(Nowshera) to the effect that on the fateful date,
day & time, he with his relatives, namely, Masher

Khan, Haji Bahadur, Shah Nawaz were present near
the shop of Chaman Khan. Naik’ Awaz s/o Taj
Muhamad, Umer, Abdullah, Zakir' Khan sons of
Naik Awaz and Taj Muhammad s/o Aseem Khan
duly armed came there and started firing upon them
through their respective weapons with intention to
kill them. As a result of their firing, the
complainant Umer Daraz, Masher Khan & Haji
Bahadur were hit and injured seriously while Shah
Nawaz escaped unhurt. Mashar Khan succumbed to
his injuries and died in the hospital. Motive for the
occurrence was disclosed as altercation, on and a
day prior to the occurrence.

3. As accused neither surrendered nor
got arrested, whereas, their arrest was attempted
through their warrant of arrest u/s 204 Cr.P.C
followed by their proclamation notice u/s 87
Cr.P.C, as such, case against them was sent up for
trial within the meaning of section 512 Cr.P.C.

4. On arrest of the
accused/convicts/appellants Naik Awaz & Umer
Zaman, followed by completion of the
investigation, their supplementary challan was
drawn and sent up for trial to the Court of
competent jurisdiction.

5. The learned trial Court confronted the
accused/convicts/appellants with the set of
allegations against them through charge sheet to

which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
6. The prosecution in order to establish
guilt of the accused/convicts/appellants placed
reliance on the testimonies of Nig witnesses,
whereafter, statement : of the
accused/convicts/appellants were recorded,
wherein, they professed their innocence. The
learned Trial Court, after conclusion of trial, found
the appellants/accused guilty of the charges and,
while recording their conviction, sentenced them
u/s 302 (b) PPC read with section 149 PPC and
awarded with sentence of rigors imprisonment for
life on two counts, for the murder of both the
deceased namely Masher Khan and Haji Bahadur.
They were also sentenced to pay compensation
amounting to Rs:500,000/- (Five hundred thousand
rupees/Five lac) in respect of both the deceased to
their legal heirs u/s 544-A Cr.P.C and in case of
default in payment of compensation, the same shall
be recovered as arrears of land revenue from their
person and estate of accused facing trial.

7. Likewise, charge against the
accused/appellants in respect of section 324 PPC
r/w section 149 PPC was also found to have been
proved followed by conviction & sentence u/s 324
r/w 149 PPC, rigors imprisonment for ten (10)
years with fine in the sum of Rs: 100,000/- (one
hundred thousand/one lac), in default simple

imprisonment for three (03) months.
8. Similarly, case u/s 337-F (v) PPC r/w
149 PPC was also found to have been proved
against the accused/appellants, Ps such, the
accused/appellants were also convicted &
sentenced u/s 337-F (v) PPC r/w section 149 PPC,
for Daman with amount of Rs:100,000/- in lump
sum with three (03) years imprisonment.

9. Likewise, case against the
accused/appellants u/s 148 r/w section 149 PPC has
also been found to have been proved successfully,
followed by conviction & sentence for three (03)
years imprisonment. All the punishment were found
to shall run concurrently and benefit of section 382-
B Cr.P.C was extended accordingly.

10. Feeling aggrieved, the
appellants/convicts have called in question their
convictions & sentences through the instant appeal
before this Court.

11. Likewise, Umer Daraz (complainant)
also sought enhancement/modification of sentences
of the appellants-accused as death.

12. Arguments heard and record gone
through with the able assistance of learned counsel
for the parties.

13. In view of the submissions at the bar
and record made available, presence of the
complainant party on the scene of occurrence at

the fateful time is alleged to be on account of
routine gossip. Close perusal of the site plan
Exh.PB would transpire that the members of the
complainant party including the deceased have
been shown at a considerable distance from each
other, whereas, in case of informal conversation or
gossip, members of the subject company are
supposed to be close & well connected so that they
can communicate their respective chat easily. But
the in between distance of the victims so reflected
in the site plan Exh.PB, prima facie not so close to
mutually communicate the gossip. Other than it,
shops and residence of Asif & Chaman do figure
in the site plan Exh.PB but instead of the same the
complainant party opted for gossip on the main
road highlighted in the site plan. Likewise, the
investigation officer on his visit to the scene of
occurrence could not have highlighted in his
preliminarily investigation report/site plan either
the seating arrangement of the members of the
complainant party nor the seating articles as chairs
& cots have been highlighted in the site plan.
Strong presumption can no way be ruled out that
the same being have not been
highlighted/disclosed to the investigation officer,
therefore, it does not figure at all in the
investigation and the subject infirmity touch the

roots of the prosecution’s case.
HS

14. In the circumstances, where proper
and safe place as Hujra of Muhammad
Akbar/shops and residence of Asif/Chaman do
exist, presence of the victims and PWs in a
thoroughfare and that too for chatting & gossiping,
whereof, neither the seating arrangement is part of
the investigation nor the investigation officer has
highlighted in his investigation report/site plan the
seating articles as chairs & cots. It is hard to
believe the very presence of the complainant at the
fateful time as the reason of his presence is not
appealing to a prudent mind coupled with the
culture & tradition of locality on the ground that
the so called gossiping in the thoroughfare is
avoided in Patanic culture.

1S. The record speaks loud & clear
about the oral altercation between the parties did
occur a day prior to the fateful event followed by
get together of the complainant party almost in the
same vicinity for the same purpose is not
appealing to the prudent & sensible mind. Other
than it, age group of the complainant, deceased
and eyewitnesses being more than 45 to 62 years,
prima facie more than mature and in Patanic
culture gossiping in the thoroughfares of such an
aged group person is rear.

16. Site plan Exh.PB speak of the hujra

of Muhammad Akbar near the scene of
19

occurrence, therefore, there was no occasion at all
for the deceased and PWs to opt for chatting in the
thoroughfare when a hujra does exist quite close to
the scene of occurrence.

17. Complainant Umer Daraz, an injured
victim on his shifting to hospital has examined by
the Medical Officer followed by report/remarks on
his injury sheet as Exh.PW6/2. The subject report
speaks loud & clear about his injury as “firearm
injury on is left thigh’, however, it has been
categorically observed that the patient
(complainant), disoriented in time & place. It is
hard fact that as a result of the subject injury heavy
blood loss can occur for the reason of major blood
vessels located around, therefore, the observation
of the medical officer regarding the physical status
as disoriented in time & place is of paramount
consideration. Likewise, the duty police
officer/Incharge casualty Civil Hospital, Pabbi
(Nowshera) while drafting the report of the
complainant could not be able to procure proper
fitness certificate from the Medical Officer as due
endorsement on the Murasila at least in terms that
the complainant is well oriented in time & place
and fit to communicate his version safely. Not to
obtain the subject observation from the Medical
Officer either on a Murasila or through a proper

endorsement, left behind scope for the preposition

that the report in question may not be the version
of the complainant because of the severity of his
injury.

18. Other than the above, name of Shah
Nawaz does figure in the calendar of the witnesses
and his presence is reflected in site plan Exh.PB at
point No.4. Needless to highlight PW Shah Nawaz
is brother of the victims, deceased Haji Bahadur
and Mashar Khan, during the investigation he has
been associated and his account has been recorded
ws 161 Cr.P.C but for the reason best known to the
prosecution he has not been examined in support
of the case. Strong presumption can no way be
ruled out that the subject star witness of the
prosecution and brother/closely related to the
deceased Haji Bahadur and Mashar Khan being
not supporting the prosecution’s case, therefore,
his account has not been furnished at all. So, in the
situation, adverse inference under Article 129(g),
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 can be safely
drawn. Even otherwise, in the situation legal
inference could also be drawn that if the said
witness had entered into the witness box then he
would not have supported the prosecution case.

evidence---scope---If best possible evidence is

---S. 302 — (b)/34---Prosecution---Misconduct---
Withholding a_ material witness-~-Effect---Non-
production of most natural and material witness of

prosecutorial misconduct, which would not only be
considered a source of undue advantage for
prosecution but also an act of suppression of

material facts causing prejudice to accused.

---Art. 129 (g)---Criminal _ trial---Withholding

withholding of most natural and material witness
of occurrence would create an impression that had
such witness been brought into witness box, he
might not have supported the prosecution---
Prosecution, in such eventuality must not in a

position to avoid the consequences.

19. It is transparent from the record that
in the’ first information report Umer Daraz
(complainant) reported the event against five
persons Naik Awaz, Umer Zaman (convicted
accused), Abdullah, Zakir Khan and Taj
Muhammad (absconding accused) have been
nominated for the commission of offence to the
effect that as a result of fire shots of the aforesaid
accused Mashar Khan and Haji Bahadur, Umer

Daraz were hit and injured whereas the eyewitness
Wy

10

Shah Nawaz made his good escape. On this score,
the occurrence is attributed to five assailants
armed with lethal weapons but the number of
empties secured from the scene of occurrence are
eleven in number of 7.62 bore. The event being
alleged to be outcome of five persons but nothing
as such has been brought on record as to whose
shots proved fatal. Likewise, the crime empties
secured from the scene of occurrence have not
been sent to FSL so as to verify the factum as to
have been fired from a single or multiple weapons
of offence. To ignore the subject circumstantial
and supporting evidence, it is a matter of grave
concern.

20. The _assailants/convicts/appellants
and the complainant party are being co-villagers
and well known to each other, as such, the element
of misidentification can safely be excluded. The
respondent/complainant party alleged to be present
on the spot and as a result of altercation (second
time), the appellants/assailants with their co-
accomplices duly armed, after another oral
altercation at the fateful time followed by the
tragic incident. The complainant party to justify its
presence on the scene of occurrence has posed to
be busy in gossiping but the site plan falsifies the
subject stance as the in-between distance does not

support the subject version.
av

21. Similarly motive for ihe occurrence
so highlighted at the first instance followed by the
evidence during the trial as oral altercation
between the parties at the scene of occurrence is
not strong enough as to amount to brutal murder of
two persons. :

22. From perusal of the case evidence, we
conclude that the prosecution witnesses were not
telling the actual truth rather posing themselves to
the principle of ‘falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus’
meaning thereby “false in one thing, false in
everything. Believing such assailable evidence by
the Court of law would be definitely against the
administration of criminal justice resulting into
judicial death of an innocent accused.

23. The crux of afore-mentioned
discussion is that either the prosecution witnesses
were not present on the spot or they are not telling
the truth. Prosecution has miserably failed to build
any nexus of the accused-appellants with the
commission of the offence. We are forfeited by the
case law reported in PLJ 2019 SC (Criminal

Cases) 265.

24, The above discussion has led this
Court to believe that the learned trial court has
erred in appreciating the case evidence in its true
perspective. It has been held, time and again by the

superior courts, that a slightest doubt occurs in the
We

12 |

prosecution case is sufficient to grant acquittal to
an accused. For giving the benefit of doubt, it is
not necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating doubts. Single
circumstance creating reasonable doubt in the
prudent mind about the guilt of accused makes him
entitled to its benefit, not a matter of grace in
concession, but as a matter of right. Reliance
could be placed on 2009 SCMR_ 230, 2011
SCMR 664, 2011 SCMR 646, 1984 PLD SC 433,
2012, MLD__1358, 2007 SCMR_ 1825, 2008
P.Cr.L.J_376, 1994 PLD Peshawar 114, 2012
PLD Peshawar 01, 1999 P.Cr.L.J_1087, 1997
SCMR 449, 2011 SCMR 820 & 2006 P.Cr.L.J
SC_1002. The conclusions drawn by the learned
trial Court are not borne out of the case evidence,
therefore, the impugned judgment is not
sustainable.

25. For what has been discussed above
and while extending the benefit of doubt to the
appellants, the instant appeal is allowed, the
impugned judgment is set aside and the appellants
are acquitted of the charge levelled against them.
They be set at liberty forthwith, if not required to be
detained in any other case.

26. Consequent upon acceptance of the
Criminal Appeal No/J. Cr.A No.1147-P/2021 and

acquittal of appellants-convict namely Naik Zaman
13

& Umer Zaman, Criminal Revision No.212-P/2021

by petitioner Umer Daraz for enhancement of the

sentences is dismissed.

27. Above are the reasons! of short order

of even date.
