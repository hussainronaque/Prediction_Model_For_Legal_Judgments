QAISER RASHID KHAN, CJ:- Accused-petitioner
Jawad Khan alias Sohail seeks his release on bail in case FIR
No.81, dated 18.09.2015, under Sections
302/324/353/427/148/149/120-B PPC / 3/4 & 5 Explosive
Substances Act / 15-AA read with section 7 ATA of Police
Station CTD, District Peshawar with the allegations that he
along with his co-accused are involved in the attack at PAF
Camp Badhber, wherein, 29 persons including the officers and
solders of Pakistan Army and Pakistan Air Force embraced

Shahadat and 39 others sustained injuries.

2. Arguments heard and the available record perused.
3. As per the FIR, it was the complainant Flight
Lieutenant Hussain Muhammad, who reported about the
incident as to how nineteen / twenty terrorists forcibly entered
the PAF Camp Badhber, Peshawar on 18.09.2015 and caused
huge casualties and damage to the property. Initially, the FIR
was lodged against the unknown culprits. However, during the
investigation, when the co-accused Mst. Zari Zadgai was
arrested, she in turn recorded her statement under section 164
Cr.P.C. wherein, she gave a detailed account in respect of the
mode and manner of the occurrence including the active role /
participation of the accused-petitioner in the commission of the
offence.

4. The argument hard pressed by the learned counsel
for the accused-petitioner is that while the co-accused Mst. Zari
Zadgai has named one Sohail to have participated in the
commission of the offence along with his co-accused, the name
of the accused-petitioner is Jawad Khan and as such, he has got
no nexus with the occurrence. The common feature of such

like cases is that the report is always lodged against unknown

culprits. However, it is during the course of investigation when
they are identified through various sources as they have either
their real names or fake names and at times are known through
their aliases. They are thus charged in the FIRs through the
supplementary statement recorded by the complainant party. In
the instant case too, the accused-petitioner has been introduced
by the co-accused Mst. Zari Zadgai in her statement recorded
under section 164 Cr.P.C through his alias, i.e. Sohail.

5. Apart from above, the accused-petitioner instead

of surrendering himself preferred to stay in abscondance for

over four and a half years and surrendered only after the

acquittal of his co-accused Mst. Zari Zadgai. Thus, taking a

tentative assessment of the available record, the accused-

petitioner is prima facie connected with the commission of the

offence which is both serious and heinous and also falls within

the prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C. Accordingly, I

hold him disentitled to the concession of bail.

6. Accordingly, this bail petition is dismissed.

7. Needless to mention that the observations

recorded in this order are purely tentative in nature and shall

Altaf Hussain, CS. (SB) Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
not prejudice the proceedings before the learned trial court
where the case be decided on its own merits after recording
evidence.

Announced. t 1
Dated: 08.02.2021.
