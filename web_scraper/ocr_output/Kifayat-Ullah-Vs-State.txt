JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTL, J.- Questioned

herein is the order dated 27.09.2014, passed by learned
Judicial Magistrate-II, Peshawar whereby respondent-
accused Sana Ullah has been granted post arrest bail in case
FIR No.529 dated 18.07.2014, registered under sections
302/109/34 PPC read with S.15 AA at Police Station
Mathra, wherein respondent-accused has been charged for
committing the murder of his wife Mst. Kaukab.

2. Arguments heard and record perused.

3. Admittedly, none has come forward to furnish
the ocular account of the incident. Initial report has been
lodged by the petitioner, husband of deceased Mst. Kokab.

He too is not an eyewitness of the occurrence; rather, he on

receipt of information qua death of his wife, rushed to his
house from his office and found her dead. He while
reporting the incident alleged the incident to be a suicide
committed by his wife. Later on, Kifayat Ullah, father of
deceased in his statement under section 164 Cr.P.C.,
charged the petitioner/his son-in-law for Qatl-e-Amd of the
deceased, but he has not furnished the source of
information and his satisfaction on the basis of which he
came to know about complicity of the petitioner in
commission of the offence. At the moment, the only
evidence strongly relied upon by the learned counsel for the
petitioner, is autopsy report of the deceased. According to
the learned counsel no charring or blackening marks have
been observed on entrance wound over the skull of the
deceased by the Medical Officer while direction of the
entrance wound is from left side skull making its exit
towards right side of the skull, which squarely belies the
version of the respondent/accused (then complainant) and
strongly suggest that a homicide has been given the colour
of suicide by the accused, therefore, he being husband of
the deceased, in absence of any plausible explanation on his
part about the circumstances under which the deceased met

her death, is a strong aspect of the incident which prima

facie connect him with the commission of offence. He also
referred to positive FSL report qua crime empty and 30
bore pistol used as weapon of offence in the incident.

4. In response to the arguments of learned
counsel for the petitioner question as to whether in absence
of any direct evidence, only postmortem report of the
deceased negating the initial version of the
respondent/accused, coupled with positive FSL report about
30 bore pistol and crime empty, which too, has not been
recovered from direct possession of the accused nor on his
pointation, rather produced by one Shahid, would be
sufficient to connect the petitioner with the commission of
offence at this stage, is yet to be plausibly answered by the
prosecution during trial. Other material is the presumption
against accused because he allegedly was in his office when
received information about the incident. Had he been
present in the house at the time of incident, then definitely,
he had to explain the circumstances of death of his deceased
wife. It is a case squarely based on circumstantial evidence,
and it is yet to be determined during trial after recording
evidence as to whether the pieces of circumstantial
evidence makes an unbroken chain to touch its one end the

dead body of the deceased and other the neck of the

accused. At the moment, on tentative assessment of the
material available on record, in absence of direct evidence,
the case of the respondent requires further probe into his
guilt, on the basis whereof the learned lower court was
justified to extend him the concession of bail.

5. Admittedly, principles governing grant of bail
and cancellation of bail, stood substantially on different
footings. Once bail has been granted by a competent Court
of law, strong and exceptional grounds are required for
cancellation thereof and it has to be seen as to whether the
bail granting order is patently illegal, erroneous, and
factually incorrect and has resulted in miscarriage of
justice. Courts are always slow to cancel bail already
granted as the liberty of a person cannot be curtailed on
flimsy grounds because cancellation of bail is a harsh step
as it interfered with the liberty of an individual hence it
must not be resorted to lightly and power to take back the
accused in custody is to be exercised with care and
circumspection. Apart from this, section 497 (5) Cr.P.C.
did not command the Court to cancel the bail even when
the offence was punishable with death or imprisonment for
life and even where the grant of bail is prohibited under

Section 497 (1) Cr.P.C. No interference with bail granting

order is required unless the same lacked reasons or is
perfunctory in nature. To curtail the liberty of a person on
bail, the prosecution should make out a case for
cancellation by not making allegations alone but by giving
substantive proof of such allegations. Learned counsel for
the petitioner failed to point out any such ground to
convince this Court for interference in the impugned order.
6. Resultantly, this petition being without any force
is hereby dismissed.

Announced.
