SAHIBZADA_ASADULLAH, J.-- The convict/appellants
Muhammad Gulfam and Mst. Gul Mayo have called in
question the judgment dated 26.09.2019, passed by learned
Sessions Judge, Karak, in case F.1.R No. 306 dated 29.06.2016,
registered at Police Station Yaqoob Khan Shaheed, District
Karak, whereby appellant Muhammad Gulfam was convicted
under section 302(b) P.P.C. and sentenced to life imprisonment
with Rs.2,00,000/-, (two lac) as compensation to the legal heirs
of deceased under section 544-A Cr.P.C, or in default thereof,

to further undergo for six months SI. He was also convicted
under section 338-A (b) P.P.C and sentenced to imprisonment
for three years rigorous imprisonment, whereas the accused/
appellant Mst. Gul Mayo was convicted under section 201
P.P.C and sentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment with
fine Rs.5000/- (five thousand) or in default of thereof, to
undergo one month simple imprisonment. Benefit of section
382-Cr.P.C was extended to both the appellants, whereas

accused Muhammad Kaloo Khan earned acquittal.

2. The complainant Mst. Tabasam Shaheen being
aggrieved from the impugned judgment approached this Court
through Cr.R. No.60-B/2019, for enhancement of sentence
awarded to the appellants, whereas the acquittal of the co-
accused was questioned through Cr.A. No.316-B/2019. As all
the three are the outcome of one and the same judgment,
therefore, we intend to decide all the connected matters through

this common judgment.

3. Brief facts of the case, as divulged: from the First
Information Report are that on 29.06.2016, Mst. Gul Mayo
(accused/ appellant) wife of Kaloo Khan (acquitted co-accused)
brought the dead-body of her daughter-in-law Mst. Maria
Begum, wife of the appellant Muhammad Gulfam to the

Police Station Yaqoob Khan Shaheed, Karak, where’ she
reported the matter to the effect that she along with her children
were present in her room, while Mst. Maria Begum and her
husband were present in another room for the purpose of sleep;
that after sometime on hearing noise of fire shots, she ran
towards the room of her son and noticed Mst. Maria Begum,
lying dead in the pool of blood, whereas her son (husband of
the deceased) was not present in the room; that they were
having no enmity with anyone and charged unknown accused
for gatl-i-amd of Mst. Maria Begum. The report of complainant
was reduced in shape of F.I.R No. 306, whereas on the same
day i.e. 29.06.2016, Mst. Tabassum Shaheen (PW-9), mother
of deceased recorded her 161 Cr.P.C statement, wherein she
stated that she alongwith her sons had gone to the house of her
daughter Mst. Maria Begum for the purpose of giving her Eid
clothes, where accused Muhammad Gulfam came and asked
the deceased to prepare meal for the gests, but she refused to
prepare being the month of Ramazan, which infuriated the
accused, who talked his father accused Kaloo Khan on phone,
who was abroad at that time, who asked to thrash her for the
same, so he with consultation of her mother, beaten the
deceased, the deceased tried to escape but accused Muhammad.
Gulfam fired at her with the intent to commit her gatl-i-amd, as

a result of which she was hit and expired on the spot. After the
occurrence accused decamped from the spot alongwith the
Kalashnikov. Mst. Tabassum Shaheen further stated that the
occurrence was witnessed by her sons Muhammad Yasir and
Atif Nadeem. She after seeing the occurrence became
unconscious, so her sons took her to the hospital, where after
gaining senses she approached the Police Station and reported
the matter, whereas Mst. Gul Mayo, mother of the accused had
already lodged a false report in order to save the skin of her son.
Thereafter, Mst. Tabassum Shaheen recorded her statement
under section 164 Cr.P.C on 04.07.2016, before the learned
Judicial Magistrate; whereas her sons Muhammad Yasir and
Atif Nadim recorded their statements under section 164 Cr.P.C
on 13.07.2016, wherein they also charged the accused,
Muhammad Gulfam, Kaloo Khan and Mst. Gul Mayo for

commission of the offence.

4. After completion of investigation, complete
challan was submitted against the accused before the learned
trial Court, where at the commencement of trial the prosecution
produced and examined as many as twelve (12) witnesses,
whereafter, statements of accused were recorded under section
342 Cr.P.C, wherein they professed their innocence, however,
neither they opted to be examined on oath as provided under

section 340 (2) Cr.PC, nor produced defence evidence. On
10.11.2018, learned counsel for complainant drew attention of
the Court towards the charge and requested that inadvertently
charge under section 338-A P.P.C has not been framed, as the
deceased Mst. Maria begum was pregnant at the time of her
death, so the learned trial Court on the same date altered the
charge to this extent and put the parties to adduce evidence, but
the learned Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel for the ©
parties opted not to record further evidence, so additional
statement of accused under section 342 Cr.P.C was recorded.
Again on 23.02.2019, one Muhammad Asghar, uncle of the
deceased appeared before the learned trial Court and produced
five photographs with respect to the occurrence and the
complainant submitted application for placing the same on file,
which application was allowed vide order dated 25.02.2019,
and permission was granted to place the same on file, the Court
also recorded statement of said Muhammad Asghar as CW-01,
with respect to photographs Mark ‘A’ to ‘E’. Thereafter, again
additional statements of accused were recorded on 08.07.2019.
After hearing arguments of learned counsel for the parties, the
learned trial Court vide impugned judgment dated 26.09.2019
convicted the accused/appellants, while acquitted co-accused
Kaloo Khan. The convicts/ appellants have filed instant Cr. A

No.296-B/2019, whereas the complainant Mst. Tabasum
Shaheen filed Cr.R No. 60-B of 2019 for enhancement. of
sentence of appellants and Cr. A No.316-B of 2019 against

acquittal of co-accused. °

5. We have heard arguments of learned counsel for
the appellant and learned Addl: A.G representing the state
assisted by learned counsel for complainant and with their

valuable assistance the record was gone through.

6. The appellants after having been convicted by
the learned trial Court questioned the same through the instant
criminal appeal, the learned trial Court dealt with the matter
comprehensively and after application of judicial mind to the
fact, circumstances and the collected evidence on file,
convicted the appellants, as mentioned above. Though the
learned trial Court dealt with the matter comprehensively, by
highlighting material aspects of the case while convicting the
appellants, yet this being the Court of appeal is under
obligation to assess and re-assess the already assessed evidence,
so that miscarriage of justice could be avoided. This Court is to
see; as to whether the approach of the learned trial Court to the
material aspects of the case was correct and as to whether
reasons advanced for convicting the appellants get support

from the material available on file. It is a classic case, as on one
hand the deceased met her unnatural death in the house of her
husband and the matter was reported by Mst. Gul Mayo i.e. her
_ mother-in-law, whereas on the other Mst. Tabassum Shaheen
i.e. mother of the deceased, charged the appellants and the
absconding co-accused, after recording her statement under
section 161, Cr.P.C. This Court is to strike a balance between
the two and to assess as to which of the versions is nearer to the
truth and which not. Though in the like matters, when the
incident occurs, that too, in the house of a husband, the
responsibility shifts to a husband to a greater extent where on
one hand the prosecution is to prove its case, on the other, the
husband is equally burdened to prove his innocence. We are to
walk with a little bit different approach in the instant case as
the complainant and her sons claimed to have seen the incident
and in such eventuality, the primary duty rests upon the
prosecution to establish on record that the incident occurred in
the mode, manner and at the stated time. We are conscious of
the fact that in the instant episode, the accused/appellant has
been singularly charged for the death of the deceased, whereas
rest of the two, either for abetment or facilitation. If on one
hand in case of single accused substitution is held to be the
rarest phenomenon then on the other the Court deciding the

fate of the accused is under obligation to search for
independent corroboration and be vigilant while assessing the
inherent worth of the evidence produced. It is advisable that the
learned trial Court in case of a single accused must not be
swayed with the impulse that substitution is a rear phenomenon
and that it must not take it for granted that in case of single
accused, the prosecution is not under obligation to prove its
case and that once an accused is charged, he is outrightly be
declared guilty, if the trial Court travels with the impulse then
the criminal justice system will always and always be in peril
and in that eventuality one cannot think otherwise, but
miscarriage of justice will always occasion which approach is
neither permissible nor finds a room in the system, as Courts
are the custodian of the rights of the parties and in all
eventualities they will follow the guidelines provided and the
principles evolved. In the like situation, it is incumbent upon
both the trial as well as the appellate Court to appreciate the
evidence collected and thereafter after assessing the collected
material the lis is to be answered so that to avoid miscarriage of

justice.

7. The learned trial Court after appreciating the
evidence on record, convicted the appellants and through the
same judgment acquitted the co-accused Muhammad Kaloo.

Though the learned trial Court advanced reasons for conviction,
yet we are to see; as to whether the learned Court was justified
to pass the impugned judgment and as to whether the learned
trial Court was not swayed with emotions, as in the instant case

the deceased was the wife of the appellant.

8. The unfortunate incident occurred on 29.06.2016,
where the deceased was done to death leading to a charge
against the appellants and the acquitted co-accused. It is
pertinent to mention that the appellant Gulfam is the husband
of the deceased and that soon after receiving firearm injuries
the deceased died on the spot whose dead body was shifted to
the police station where the matter was reported by Mst. Gul
Mayo, mother of the appellant, who was later on implicated as
an accused in the instant case, when Mst. Tabassum Shaheen,
mother of the deceased recorded her statement to the
Investigating Officer under Section 161, of the Criminal

Procedure Code.

9. It is pertinent to mention that the Investigating
Officer recorded the statement of Mst. Tabasum Shaheen,
under section 161 Cr.P.C., followed by her statement under
section 164 Cr.P.C. before the Court of Judicial Magistrate,
where she stated that on 29.06.2016, she alongwith her sons

namely Muhammad Yasir and Atif Nadeem visited the house
10
of the deceased as they usually did on arrival of Eid and that on
the day of incident they too visited the house after purchasing
clothes for the deceased. They were present in the house, when
the accused/ appellant entered the house and asked his wife, the
deceased, to prepare meal, as he had guests with him, to which
the deceased did not accede which infuriated the appellant,
who consulted his father Muhammad Kaloo, stationed abroad,
on his mobile phone who directed his son to beat the deceased
which the appellant did and fired at the deceased with a
Kalashnikov in his possession which resulted into the death of
the deceased. She went on to say that after receiving firearm
injuries by her daughter, she being the mother could not
tolerate, went unconscious and was rushed to civil hospital
Takht-e-Nasrati for treatment, where she was administered
medicines and after regaining senses, she in the company of her
son Atif Nadeem visited the police station where she charged
the appellants alongwith the acquitted co-accused. It is
pertinent to mention that Atif Nadeem was examined as PW-8,
who stated that on the day of incident, he alongwith his brother
PW Muhammad Yasir and his mother left their house for the
house of the deceased to provide her with the clothes purchased
for the coming Eid, and while sitting in veranda of the house,

the appellant entered into the house, altercated with the
11
deceased and on instigation of the co-accused Muhammad
Kaloo Khan, first beaten the deceased and thereafter fired at
her which resulted into her death. He further stated that on
seeing the deceased lying in a pool of blood, his mother went
unconscious who was rushed to the hospital and after getting
comprehensive treatment from the doctors, she regained senses,
visited the local police station where her statement under
section 161, Cr.P.C. was recorded. The complainant charged
the appellants and the acquitted co-accused for the murder
of the deceased. This is surprising that despite the fact that PW
Atif Nadeem was available with the complainant when her
statement under section 161, Cr.P.C. was recorded but he did
not opt for recording his statement. The prosecution is to
answer that despite availability of the witnesses in the house at
the time of incident and thereafter, why their statements were
not recorded by the Investigating Officer on the day of incident.
The belated statement of PW-8 has put a question mark on his
veracity, had he been present in the hospital then his statement
would have also been recorded. This is surprising to note that
the statement of Atif Nadeem was recorded on 13.7.2016, after
a considerable delay to which he tendered abnormal
explanation. The prosecution is to tell that when the

complainant recorded her statement on the day of incident and
12
visited the spot in the company of the Investigating Officer,
then what precluded her to point out the place of incident and
that why no addition in the site plan was made on her
pointation. This is surprising to note that it was on 04.7.2016
when on pointation of the complainant addition of places was
made in the site plan, where PW-8 and his brother Muhammad
Yasir also put their signatures. PW-8 is to explain that why he
did not record his statement on 04.7.2016, when he allegedly
accompanied the Investigating Officer to the place of incident.
The witnesses are to establish their presence on the spot, but
the circumstances suggest that the incident did not occur in the
mode; and manner and that they were not present at the spot
house at the time of incident. Both the witnesses i.e, PW-8 and
PW-9 fully contradicted each other on material aspects of the
case. The witnesses admitted the cordial relation between the
spouses and even they admitted in unequivocal terms that the
appellant was stationed in Masqat who after meeting a road
accident got his hands and legs fractured, was shifted to the
country almost crippled. This is surprising to note that when
the appellant was having deformed physical condition, then
after killing the deceased how he escaped from the place of
incident and that why the witnesses including two real brothers

did not attempt to catch hold of him. The witnesses are to
13
explain that despite their availability in the house, why they did
not come forward to rescue their sister from the clutches of the

appellant.

10. The conduct displayed by the witnesses is not
only unnatural but abnormal as well, as the witnesses
constantly made conscious attempts to establish their presence
on the spot. This does not appeal to a prudent mind that after
the deceased received firearm injuries, her mother went
unconscious; and that the witnesses instead of attending their
real sister, who was lying in a pool of blood, took their mother
to the hospital for treatment. The record tells that when PW-8
recorded his 164 Cr.P.C. statement, he did not mention the
unconsciousness of his mother and even he did not mention the
presence of Muhammad Yasir, alongwith them, at the time of
incident. Both the witnesses did not support each other
regarding the manner in which their statements were recorded,
as PW-9 stated that the statement of PW-8 was recorded on the
day of incident, whereas PW-8 admitted that his statement was
recorded after 13/14 days of the incident. The circumstances do
tell that none of the statements were recorded on the day of
incident, had the statements of the witnesses been recorded on
29.6.2016, then in that eventuality the site plan would have

been prepared on their pointation. In order to establish the
14
physical condition of the complainant on the day of incident,
neither the doctor, who treated PW-9 in the hospital was
examined, nor the complainant produced the treatment chart of
the hospital, so much so the Investigating Officer did not take
pains to visit the hospital and collect evidence in that respect.
This lack of interest on part of witnesses on this particular
aspect of the case tells nothing, but that an attempt was made to
establish their presence on the spot and thereafter, but the
circumstances do not support the case of the prosecution on

this particular aspect.

11. The Investigating Officer visited the spot and on
pointation of the complainant Mst. Gul Mayo, prepared the site
plan. The record tells that during spot inspection, the
Investigating Officer collected 17 empties of 7.62 bore
alongwith blood-stained earth from the spot. The appellant was
arrested on 04.7.2016, in injured condition from the hospital
but the record is silent regarding his arrest, as no card of arrest
is available on file. It is pertinent to mention that allegedly, a
Kalashnikov alongwith 17 live rounds and a hand-grenade
were taken into possession by the Investigating Officer from
Malkhana of the concerned police station, though the same
were declared to have been recovered from possession of

accused/appellant at the time of his arrest, but surprisingly no
15
one was examined to tell that at what time and at what place
the appellant was arrested. The record tells that the accused
was arrested on 04.7.2016 and on the same day the weapon of
offence was taken into possession from Malkahana of the
concerned police station, but the Investigating Officer could
not produce any witness to depose in that respect. PW-12
Abdul Latif ASI appeared before the Court and stated that he
witnessed the recovery memo already exhibited as Ex: PW
10/1, vide which the Investigating Officer took into possession
one Kalashnikov recovered from the possession of accused
Gulfam, Ex: P-6 and seventeen empties of the same bore
exhibited as Ex:P-2. During cross examination, he came
forward with strange replies by stating that at the time of
preparation of recovery memo, the accused was not present in
the police station, rather he was admitted in civil hospital
Takht-e-Nasrati for his treatment. The circumstances do tell
that the appellant was not arrested in the mode and manner and
that nothing was recovered from his possession at the time of
his arrest. The Investigating Officer is to tell that when the
appellant was hospitalized, then why he was not arrested on the
day of the incident and that why his arrest was deferred till
04.7.2016. His belated arrest raises an eyebrow over conduct of

the witnesses and their presence at the time of incident in the
16
spot house. Right from the beginning till the end, the real facts
were not brought on record rather an attempt was made, both
by the Investigating Officer as well as the eyewitnesses to twist
the events to their favour. This conscious attempt on part of the

witnesses created numerous dents in the prosecution story.

12. It is pertinent to mention that the weapon was
allegedly recovered on 03.7.2016, whereas the same was sent
to the Firearms Expert after a considerable delay and was
received on 28.7.2016. The Investigating Officer did not
explain that where the recovered case property was lying in the
intervening period, and even no witness was examined on this
particular aspect of the case. The Investigating Officer admitted
that he did not record the statement of the witness who took the
same to the laboratory,even he did not record the statement of
Moharrir of the concerned police station, so much so, he
expressed his ignorance regarding the official who took the
same to the Firearms Expert. The lack of interest on part of the
Investigating Officer surprised us, when he admitted that
though he addressed an application to the Director General
Forensic Science Laboratory, but no date was put thereon. The
way the recoveries were effected and transmitted to the

Forensic Sciences Laboratory leads us nowhere but to hold that
17
the prosecution failed to establish this particular piece of

evidence, which cannot be taken into consideration.

13. After evaluating the available record from all
angles, this Court reaches to an inescapable conclusion that the
incident did not occur in the mode, manner and at the stated
time. This Court is to determine that despite the fact that the
deceased lost her life in the house of her husband and that the
incident was reported by mother of the appellant charging none,
whether in that eventuality, the responsibility of the appellant
increases and the burden would shift from the prosecution to
the accused charged. Had the complainant charged the
appellant for the murder of the deceased, even in absence of
eyewitness account it would have been the responsibility of the
appellant to discharge the burden being husband of the
deceased, as it was he who was to convince otherwise, but
when the complainant alongwith witnesses took the burden by
posing themselves to be the eyewitnesses of the incident, then
in that eventuality, the husband was to do less to establish his
innocence and the witnesses to do more to prove him guilty.
Though the learned counsel for the complainant placed reliance
on a celebrated judgment of the apex Court titled ‘Nazir

Ahmad Vs. The State’ (2018 S CM R 787), where the husband

was burdened with the responsibility in the like situation, and
18
that the conduct of the accused charged therein, was taken an
additional factor, but there too, the liability was never shifted,
as the prosecution was held responsible to discharge the burden.
True, that in the cited judgment, the apex Court was pleased to
put some of the responsibilities on the shoulders of the husband,
but never ever the prosecution was absolved of the liabilities to
prove its case, in the circumstances, we can quote with
convenience case titled ‘Asad Khan Vs. The State’ (PLD 2017
Supreme Court 681), where in the like situation, the
prosecution was burdened with the liability to establish the
guilt of the accused/appellant and to prove its case to the hilt,
by holding that under all circumstances, it is the prosecution to
prove its case and even if an accused takes a specific plea and
fails to establish the same, he cannot be burdened with the
liability to establish his innocence, rather the prosecution was
held responsible under all circumstances to bring home charges

against the accused charged.

14. The situation we are faced with, is altogether
different, as in case in hand, we have the prosecution witnesses
who claimed themselves have witnessed the incident and in
such eventuality, we lurk no hesitation in our mind to hold that
the whole burden shifts to the shoulders of the witnesses, who

claimed themselves to have seen the incident. We are left with
19
no option, but either to consider the report made by Mst, Gul
Mayo, who was later on substituted as an accused, where she
charged no one for the death of the deceased or to accept the
version put forward by PW-9 Mst. Tabassum Shaheen, If we
go with the story narrated in the FIR, then in that eventuality, it
turns hard to hold the appellant responsible for the death of the
deceased and the co-accused as facilitator. Even the
prosecution could not create a chain in shape of recoveries,
positive laboratory report and arrest of the appellant, to help us
in holding the appellants responsible for the death of the

deceased, even in absence of direct ocular account.

15. We would like to assess; as to whether the
witnesses succeeded in establishing their presence in the spot
house at the stated time and as to whether the incident occurred
in the mode and manner, as explained in earlier part of the
judgment that neither the witnesses established their presence
on the spot at the stated time, nor they came forward with the
whole truth, so in such eventuality the prosecution did not
succeed in bringing home guilt against the appellants. There is
no denial to the fact that the deceased lost her life on receiving
firearm injuries, but when the witnesses claimed themselves as
the eyewitness, then we have no other option but to assess the

veracity of their statements and to ascertain; as to whether they
20
were present at the time of incident as under the criminal
dispensation of justice little room is left for presumption, when
the Court reaches to a definite conclusion that.the witnesses
were telling a lie and even then convicts an accused on the sole
ground of being the husband, then the results would be drastic
and the approach so arrived to, will negate the real essence of
justice. In case titled ‘Nasrullah alias Nasro Vs. The State’

(2017 SCMR 724), it was held that:-

“Be that as it may holding by this Court
that some part of the onus lies on the
accused person in such a case does not
mean that the entire burden of proof
Shifts to the accused person in a case of
this nature. It has already been clarified
by this Court in the case of Abdul -
Majeed v. The State (2011 SCMR 941)
that the prosecution is bound to prove its
case against an accused person beyond
reasonable doubt at all stages of a
criminal case and in a case where the
prosecution asserts presence of some
eye-witnesses and such claim of the
prosecution is not established by it there
the accused person could not be
convicted merely on the basis of a
presumption that since the murder of his
wife had taken place in his house,
therefore, it must be he and none else

who would have committed that murder”.
21
Y 16. The cumulative effect of what has been stated
above, leads this Court to an inescapable conclusion that the
appellants have been succeeded in making out a case for
indulgence of this Court, the impugned judgment is devoid of
reasons, suffering from inherent defects and calls for
interference. Resultantly, the instant criminal appeal is allowed,
the impugned judgment is set aside, the appellants are acquitted
of the charges. The appellant Muhammad Gulfam shall be
released forthwith if not required to be detained in connection
with any other criminal case, whereas Mst. Gul Mayo is on bail,
her sureties are absolved from the liabilities of bail bonds. As
the impugned judgment has been set aside, so in such
eventuality, the connected Cr.R. No.60-B of 2019, © for
enhancement of the sentence and Cr.A. No. 316-B of 2019
against acquittal of the co-accused, have lost its utility, being

bereft of merit, are hereby dismissed.

Above are the reasons of our short order of the

even date.
