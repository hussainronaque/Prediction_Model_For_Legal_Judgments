JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD IJAZ KHAN, J.- Through the instant

petition, the petitioner seeks as under:

“On acceptance of instant criminal
revision petition, the orders of learned
ASJ-IV dated 27.10.2022 and judgment
dated 15.02.2020 to the extent of
confiscation of 9MM pistol alongwith
magazine containing five live rounds
V7 may graciously be set aside and the local
police i.e. respondent No.3 be directed to
hand over the pistol in question
alongwith magazine and five live rounds
to the petitioner with immediate effect.
Any other relief which this Honourable
Court deems fit and proper in the
circumstances of the case may also be
granted in favour of the petitioner.”

(Jamil) (SB) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
2s Precisely, the facts of the case are that
respondent No.2 namely Mushtaq lodged a report in
shape of Murasila which was lateron incorporated into
registration of case FIR No.328 dated 11.09.2016
under sections 302/324 PPC, police station KTS
Haripur. Lateron, challan was put in the court and the
trial commenced, however, during the trial, parties
patched up the matter and thus the petitioner being an
accused was acquitted of the charges levelled against
him on the ground of compromise vide order and
judgment dated 15.02.2020, however, through the same
order, a 9 MM pistol alongwith a magazine loaded with
5 live rounds were confiscated in favour of the State.

3. The petitioner thereafter approached to the
learned trial court for the return of the aforesaid case
property, however, the same was declined to him vide
order dated 27.10.2022 on the ground that since the
aforesaid case property has already been confiscated
vide order dated 15.02.2020, therefore, the same
cannot be returned by the trial court being functus
officio. Now the petitioner has challenged both the
aforesaid orders dated 15.02.2020 vide which the

aforesaid case property was confiscated and order

(Jamil) (SB) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Taz Khan.
dated 27.10.2022 vide which the petition of the
petitioner was dismissed.

4. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
petitioner as well as learned Assistant Advocate
General heard and record perused with their valuable
assistance.

5. At the very outset, learned counsel for the
petitioner states that the instant criminal revision
petition be treated as a petition under section 520 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, which request of the
petitioner seems appropriate as section 520 Cr.PC
empowers the court to interfere in any order passed
under section 517, 518 or 519 Cr.PC. It also empowers
the court to pass any appropriate order even if an
appeal is not pending before the superior court as it is a
special kind of jurisdiction and is not dependent upon
the appellate or revisional powers of the court and the
requirement of this statutory provision could be fully
invoked by a person who merely submits an
application to the court concerned complaining against
the order passed under section 517, 518 or 519 Cr.PC
by any court subordinate to such court as it is

supervisory nature of jurisdiction whereby superior

(Jamil) (SB) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
courts have been empowered to control order of
subordinate courts passed under section 517, 518 or
519 Cr.PC. The aforesaid wisdom is derived from
judgements delivered in cases titled “Sardara v. Boota”
reported as PLD 1950 [Lahore] 97, “Ghulam Akbar v.
(1)The State and (2)Ghulam Nabi” reported as PLD
1958 (W.P.) Lahore 212, “Jalal Khan alias Jalley Khan
v. The State and another” reported as PLD 1975
[Lahore] 45, “Ahmad Bakhsh v. The State and another”
reported as PLD 1966 (W.P.) Lahore 918 and “Ghulam
Ali v. The State” reported as 2021 PCr.LJ_ 438
[Balochistan]. In view of above, the request of the
petitioner is accordingly acceded and hence, this
petition be treated as a criminal revision petition read
with a petition under section 520 Cr.PC.

6. As far as the merit of the case is concerned, the
record would reveal that the petitioner has been
acquitted of the charges leveled against him, by the
learned trial court vide order and judgment dated
15.02.2020 on the ground of compromise and it is
settled law since long that all acquittals are honorable
acquittals whether it is recorded on the basis of

compromise or is based on merits and thus such

(Jamil) (SB) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
“Y

acquittal orders are followed by all the benefits, if any,
available to the acquitted accused. It is also settled that
in case of compromise in compoundable offences, the
same has the effect of removal, pardoning and erasing
of the offence. Since the present petitioner was charged
under section 302/324 PPC which are compoundable
offences, therefore, their acquittal on the basis of
compromise will have the effect of erasing the effect of
the offence. In the case titled “Attaullah Sheikh vs.
WAPDA and others” reported as 2001 SCMR 269, the
Apex Court has held that it is an admitted fact that the
appellant was acquitted by learned Special Judge
(Central), Multan from the charges which were levelled
against him. This Court, in the case of Dr. Muhammad
Islam has laid down a dictum that all acquittals are
"honourable" and there could be no acquittal which I
could be termed as "dishonourable". Similarly, in the
case titled “Dr.Muhammad Islam v. Government of

N.W.F.P. through Secretary, Food, Agriculture,

Livestock and Cooperative Department, Peshawar and

2__others” reported as 1998 SCMR_ 1993, the
Apex Court has held that all acquittals, even if these

are based on benefit of doubt are honourable for the

(Jamil) (SB) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
reason that the prosecution has not succeeded to prove
their cases against the accused on the strength of
evidence of unimpeachable character. It may be noted
that there are cases in which the judgments are
recorded on the basis of compromise between the
parties and the accused are acquitted in consequence
thereof. What shall be the nature of such acquittals. All
acquittals are certainly honourable. There can be no
acquittals, which may be said to be dishonourable. The
law has not drawn any distinction between these types
of acquittals.

7. It is also relevant to mention here that there is no
dispute that the present petitioner is owner of the said
9MM pistol and he is having a valid licence for the
same, the photocopy of the same is available on file
and original of the same was also produced to the court
which shows that the present petitioner is the owner of
the same. In view of the above when the petitioner has
been acquitted of the charges and when petitioner is
holding a valid licence of the case property then under
the law he is entitled for its return. In the case titled
“Manzoor Hussain Jatoi vs. The State” reported as 1997

PCr.LJ 500, the Honourable Federal Shariat Court has

(Jamil) (SB) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
laid down that section 520 Cr.PC gives jurisdiction to
superior Courts to interfere with an order passed by a
lower Court under Sections 517, 518 & 519, Cr.PC but
it does not restrict a lower Court from passing an order
consequent upon and in compliance with the order of a
superior Court. It was also laid down in the said

judgment that the order of the Honourable Supreme

Court that they "acquit him of the charge" logically

implies that he is entitled to all the reliefs consequent

to his acquittal, including the release of his property

seized under that charge. Unless the Appellate Court
exempts a particular relief in express terms, the order
of acquittal should entail all the consequential effects
thereof. A separate order for each and every
consequence of the acquittal is not necessary.
Therefore, the trial Court, acting on the basis of the
order of acquittal recorded by the Honourable Supreme
Court could have released the property. Likewise, in
the case titled “Mohibullah and another v. The State”
reported as 2018 PCr.LJ 954 [Balochistan], it has been
held that after winning acquittal, the applicant could
not be deprived of logical consequences of his acquittal

order. Admittedly, neither the motorcycle in question

(Jamil) (SB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
was used in the commission of the alleged offence nor
the same was stolen property. Motorcycle was taken
into custody by the police from the possession of the

applicant. Acquittal of accused of the charge, entitled

him to all reliefs including the release of his properties

seized _at the time. Application was allowed in
circumstances.

8. Accordingly, this petition is allowed and
consequently, the impugned order of the learned trial
court dated 15.02.202 to the extent of confiscation of
the case property is set aside. Similarly, impugned
order dated 27.10.2022 vide which the petition of the
petitioner was dismissed is also set aside and the SHO
of police station concerned is directed to return 9 MM
pistol alongwith magazine and 5 live rounds to the

petitioner, accordingly.
