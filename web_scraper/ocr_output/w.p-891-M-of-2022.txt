the impugned FIR No.140 of Police
Station Timergara dated: 14.06.2022

discriminatory,  ex-facie malicious,
dishonest, unconditional, void ab-initio,
null and void, hence to be quashed.

2. In essence, the petitioner was charged in

a criminal case vide FIR No.140 dated 14.06.2022 by
Bakht Jamal Khan, Inspector/SHO of Police Station
Timergara, District Dir Lower, registered under
section 295-A & 506, PPC at the Police Station
Timergara. Later on, section 398-C, PPC & section 3

3. It obliged the petitioner to approach this

We have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the petitioner as well as learned A.A.G
for the State and gone through the record with their

valuable assistance.

5. The moot point raised herein before this
Court is that the subject FIR was registered against
the petitioner in violation of section 196 of the Cr.P.C
and the same is liable to be quashed or otherwise. For
this purpose, it would be appropriate to reproduced
section 196 of the Cr.P.C as follows:

“196. Prosecution for offences against

the State. No Court shall take
cognizance of any offence punishable
under Chapter VI or IX-A of the
Pakistan Penal Code (except section
127), or punishable under ‘section
108-A, or section I53-A, or section
294-A, or section 295-A or section 505
of the same Code, unless upon
complaint ‘made by order of, or under
authority from, the Central Government,
or the Provincial Government concemed,
or some officer empowered in this behalf
by either of the two Governments.”

6, The Court examined the case law
referred to by the learned counsel for the petitioner
and also searched out case law on the point. In most
of the case law, it was held that case against an
accused having been registered without the authority
of Central or Provincial Governments or of some

officer empowered in this behalf, is in violation of

Bakht Sher AlvSteno* (D.B.) Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan

section 196 of the Cr.P.C and the FIR was quashed.

As in the case of “Malik Shaukat Ali Dogar and 12

others _v. Ghulam Qasim Khan _Khakwani_and

others”, reported as PLD 1994 Supreme Court 281,

the Apex Court has observed as follows:

7.

“6. So far as the question of registration
of the case without prior sanction of the
competent authority is concerned, in the
case of Emperor v, Khawaja Nazir
Ahmad (AIR 1955 Privy Council 18)
the law laid down was that the
prohibition contained in section 197,
CzP,C against a prosecution without the
necessary sanction is against the action
of taking of cognizance by the Court. It
does not prevent, preclude or otherwise
interfere with the power of the police in
the matter of registration of the case and
the investigation thereof. The sanction
required under section 197, Cr.P.C is
even otherwise not required in view of
decision of the case of Zafar Awan PLD
1992 SC 72.”

In the case of Atta Muhammad Deshani

v. District Police Officer, Haripur_and 2 others,

reported as 2019 PCr.LJ 275 (Peshawar High

Court Abbottabad Bench), this Court has held as

follows:

“9, On examining the case law and
section 196, Cr.P.C, it follows that the
police have to perform the functions
specifically assigned to them without any
outside interference under Chapter XIV,
Part V of the Criminal Procedure Code.
The functions of the Court would
commence only when a complete
Challan is sent to it for trial of the
accused. In the imstance case, as we
gathered from section 196, Cr.P.C, it is
only after submission of Challan that the

Bakht Sher Ali/Steno*

(D.B,) Hon’ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan

ey

Court takes cognizance of the case and

thus, the proceedings taken prior to this,

cannot be held to be violative of section

196, CxP.C. We when examined the

record, find that in the instant case the

SHO concerned has submitted Challan

under section 173 Cr.P.C. In routine

without submitting it in the shape of

complaint or seeking sanction of the

Central Government, Provincial

Government or any officer authorized by

it thus, the proceedings to that extent are

quashed and the trial Court cannot take

cognizance on such defective Challan.”
8. In the subject case, the Inspector/SHO
concerned has directly took cognizance of the matter
and lodged the abovementioned FIR against the
petition in violation of section 196 of the Cr.P.C.,
whereas, he was to simply file a complaint against the
petitioner before the Court of competent jurisdiction

after ensuring compliance of section 196, Cr-P.C.

9. The Court would now advert to the law
relating to quashment. Although there is a dominant
judicial view that the High Court would normally
restrain from quashing a criminal case exercising its
powers w/s. 561-A, Cr.P.C read with Art. 199 of the
Constitution, however, where no other adequate
remedy is available to an aggrieved person, it may
exercise such powers. Reliance is placed on the case
Dr. Sher Afgan Khan Niazi_y. Ali_S. Habib and
others, (2011 SCMR 1813) [Supreme Court of

Pakistan], in which, the order of quashment passed

Bakht Sher Ali/Steno* {D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan

by the High Court was set aside, certain guidelines

were laid down which are as follows:

“High Court will have to consider in each
case the following test to be applied to
determine the adequacy of the relief

(i) I€ the relief available through the
altemative remedy in its nature or
extent is not what is necessary to give
the requisite relief, the alternate remedy
is not an ‘other adequate remedy’
within the meaning of Article 199,

(ii) If the relief available through the
alternate remedy, im its nature and
extent, is what is necessary to give the
requisite relief, the "adequacy" of the
alternate remedy must further be
judged with reference to a comparison
of the speed, expense or convenience of
obtaining that relief through the
alternate remedy with the speed,
expense or convenience of obtaining it
under Article 199, But in making this
comparison, those factors must not be
taken into account which would
themselves alter if the remedy under
Article 199 were used as a substicute

ay for the other remedy.
(iii) In practice the following steps may be
taken:

(a) Formulate the grievance in the
given case as a generalized
category;

(b) Formulate the relief that is
necessary to redress that category
of grievance;

(c) See if the law has prescribed any
remedy that can redress that
category of grievance in that way
and to the required extent;

(d) If such a remedy is prescribed, the

law contemplates that resort must
be have to that remedy;

(e) If it appears that the machinery
established for the purpose of that
remedy is not functioning properly,
the correct step to take will be a

Bakbt Sher AlvSteno* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar
How’ ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan

ow

gyi”?

step that is calculated to ensure, as
far as lies in the power of the court
that that machinery begins to
function as it should, It would
not be correct to take over the
function of that machinery. If the
function of another organ is taken
over, that other organ will atrophy
and the organ that takes over will
break down under the strain;

(£) If there is no other remedy that
can redress that category of
grievance in that way and to the
required extent or if there is such a
remedy but conditions are attached
to itwhich for a particular category
of cases would neutralize or defeat
it so as to deprive it of its
substance, the court should give the
requisite relief under Article 199,

(g) If there is such other remedy, but
there is something so special in the
circumstances of a given case that
the other remedy which generally
adequate, to the relief required for
that category of grievance is not
adequate to the relief that is
essential in the very special
category to which that belongs, the
court should give the required
relief under Article 199.

10. In view of the above stated position,
the subject petition is allowed and the FIR No.140,
dated 14.06.2022 u/ss. 295-A/506/398-C, PPC, and
section 3 of Loud Speaker Ordinance, 1965,
registered at Police Station Timergara, District Dir

Lower, stands quashed.
