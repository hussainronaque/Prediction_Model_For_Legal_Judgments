***
SAHIBZADA_ASADULLAH, J.- Impugned herein is the
judgment dated 18.10.2018 rendered by learned Sessions Judge,
Bannu, whereby the appellant Azmat Ullah, involved in case FIR
No.56 dated 28.02.2014, under section 302 PPC of police station
Basia Khel, was convicted and sentenced to death with
compensation of Rs:1,00,000/- payable to the legal heirs of the
deceased or in default thereof, to undergo further six months
simple imprisonment. The learned trial Court has also sent
Murder Reference No.10-B/2018 for its confirmation.
2. The tragic incident of the instant criminal appeal, as
reflected by and unfolded in the FIR Ex.PW-5/1 registered at the
instance of Balqiaz Khan, the complainant shifted the dead body
of his deceased wife to the police station and reported the event

in terms that at the fateful time, at about 13:00 hours, he and
-2-

other family members were present in their house when in the
meanwhile, his son Azmat Ullah the accused, duly armed with
pistol, got hypered, and fired at his wife (mother of accused)
namely Mst. Mir Daro Bibi, as result of it, she was injured and
succumbed to her injuries. The accused after commission of the
offence fled away from the spot. Motive for the offence was
stated to be a domestic dispute.

3. Investigation was started in the case by the local
police of police station Basia Khel and on conclusion of the
same, complete challan was submitted against the appellant to
the Court of learned Sessions Judge, Bannu, where at the
commencement of the trial the prosecution produced as many as
eight witnesses whose statements were recorded and placed on
file. On close of the prosecution evidence, accused was
examined under section 342, Cr.P.C. Describing himself as
scapegoat, he denied the charges, professed innocence and stated
to have falsely been implicated in the case. He, however, wished
to produce no defence, nor to examine himself on oath as
required under section 340(2), Cr.P.C. The learned Sessions
Judge, Bannu on conclusion of the trial, convicted and sentenced
the appellant vide judgment impugned herein.

4. We have considered submissions of the learned
counsel for the parties and gone through the record of the case
with their valuable assistance.

5. It was one of the most unfortunate day, when the

deceased Mst. Mir Daaru lost her life by receiving firearm
-3-

injuries for which the unfortunate son i.e. the accused was
charged. It was at 1415 hours, when the complainant husband of
the deceased alongwith co-villagers brought the dead-body of his
wife to the local police station and reported the matter and
charged the accused/appellant his son. . After reporting the
matter the dead body was taken to the hospital the postmortem
was conducted and the doctor found two firearm entry wounds
with its exit and a graze wound. The learned counsel for the
accused/appellant mainly attacked the delay in reporting the
matter to the police and that the complainant was a procured
witness and was not present on spot and that the Investigating
Officer could not collect anything against the accused/ appellant.
We heard learned counsels passionately, but the present case is
resting on a different premise as a mother was killed and a son
was charged where the complainant was no one else but a father,
so it needs a different approach. The objections so raised by the
learned counsel for the defence in respect of the delay caused in
reporting the matter to the local police, as to him, the occurrence
took place at 01:00 p.m. whereas, the report was made at 2:15
p.m., which to him, was abnormal and none could explain and he
stressed that this delay leads nowhere, but to hold that the
complainant was not present in the house at the time of
occurrence. We do not find ourselves in agreement with the
learned defence counsel, as we are to see the people involved in
the episode and their inter se relations with one another, it was

the father who lost his wife on the one hand, and on the other
-4-

hand, he was to put to gallows no one else but his son, so being a
father and a husband, he was in a fix and at last decided to
charge the culprit. The question regarding the availability of
complainant in the house holds no ground, as it was a joint
house and when the complainant was examined, he stated that at
the time of occurrence he, his daughter-in-law and her children
were present in the house but at the time of firing his daughter-
in-law was inside the room even otherwise, if we presume for
the sake of arguments, that the daughter-in-law was not ready to
support the charge against the appellant, at the same time, we
cannot doubt the veracity of a father charging his real son. An
abortive attempt was made to convince this Court that the charge
was brought against the appellant with mala fide intentions, but
the defence, despite searching cross-examination, could bring
nothing favourable from the mouth of the complainant and even
the defence could not substantiate the plea that the accused was
substituted for the actual culprit. We will say that an unfortunate
attempt was made by the defence to suggest that the woman was
of easy virtue, but the defence ignored the age of the deceased,
as her age was the age of respect. Nothing could be brought on
record that the relations between father and son were too strained
that a father would bring a false charge and even the defence
could not convince us.

6. It was a brutal murder, as the deceased was
mercilessly killed, what a son it was, who entered the bullets in

her mother’s chest and what the mother would have thought at
-5-

the last moment of her life, what! a merciless killing this was?.
Non-recording of statements of the inmates of the house will not
disturb the prosecution case, as the father was a natural witness
and his presence in the house at the time of occurrence could not
be doubted. The complainant came forward and was examined as
PW- 6, who gave the natural sequence of events and his
testimony was nothing but the emotions gushing out. One of the
arguments of the defence was that the main gate was located just
behind the complainant and that as to why the complainant did
not try to catch hold of the accused while he was decamping
from the house, the answer is easy, it was an old father whose
son in his presence committed the murder of his wife and it was
the emotional attachment of the husband with his wife who
rushed towards her ignoring the appellant while running from the
spot.
In case titled Fayyaz alias Niazi Vs. State (2017

SCMR 2024), it was held that:-

S. 302(b)---Qatl-i-amd---Reappraisal of

evidence---case of a single accused, who had

been nominated with the specific allegation of

causing firearm injury to the deceased---

Occurrence took place in a grocery shop, and

ocular account was furnished by brother of the

deceased and owner of the shop---Ocular

account was fully supported by medical

evidence furnished by the doctor, who

conducted autopsy on the dead body of

deceased---

Prosecution case stood proved against the

accused beyond any shadow of doubt and his

conviction under S.302(b), P.P.C. recorded by

the Trial Court and maintained by the High

Court was fully  justified---Appeal was
dismissed to the extent of conviction of accused.

In case titled Shamshad Ali Vs. The State (2011
SCMR 1394), it was held that:-

“The place of occurrence admittedly was the
house of the complainant and the appellant,
therefore the complainant was a_ natural
witness. After her examination-in-chief, she
was subjected to lengthy cross examination
but nothing in favour of the appellant came
out in the same. The complainant had no
motive to falsely implicate the appellant in the
present case. Her statement is confidence
inspiring and solitary statement coming out of
the mouth of a natural witness, even if it is not
corroborated by any independent piece of
evidence, is sufficient to bring home the guilt
of the accused. However, in the present case,
the medical evidence also supported the
ocular account. All the injuries were found to
have been caused with sharp edged weapon.
The appellant was the only accused alleged to
have caused the said injuries, therefore the
conflict in regard to the number of injuries
caused by him, is not material”.

7. The Investigating Officer recovered blood-stained
earth and two empties of .30 bore from the spot and prepared the
site plan on pointation of the complainant. The venue of
occurrence is proved and there is nothing on record to disprove
it, as it was the house where both complainant and the accused
were living and so the deceased. Gul Rauf D.S.P. arrested the
appellant and from his possession a .30 bore pistol with 13 live
rounds were recovered and the pistol recovered was sent to the
Forensic Sciences Laboratory, which was received on 09.3.2014
which after comparison gave birth as positive, the F.S.L report is
lying on file. The defence tried its utmost that the empties and
pistol were dispatched after sufficient long time and that no one

was examined as to where and in whose custody the case
-7-

property was lying in the intervening period and that who took
the pistol and empties to the F.S.L. The submissions of the
learned counsel for the defence in this respect finds no weight as
the incident occurred on 28.02.2014 the accused was arrested on
03.3.2014 and the pistol alongwith empties was received to the
Laboratory on 09.3.2014, which cannot be taken as an abnormal
delay which could spoil the prosecution case. Even otherwise,
the prosecution has proved its case against the accused to the hilt
and we cannot doubt the veracity and truthfulness of the
complainant.
In case titled Nizamuddin Vs. The State (2010

SCMR 1752), it was held that:-

“6. Coming to the question of delay in sending

crime weapon and crime empties, admittedly,

the crime empties were recovered on the day of

incident and the crime weapon was recovered

on 17-7-1996. It appears that the same were,

however, sent to Chemical Examiner on 24-7-

1996 with considerable delay but such delay

shall not, in the facts and circumstances of this

case, overweigh the ocular evidence found in

line with and supported by the medical

evidence”.
8. The learned counsel for defence tried his best to
make out his case for acquittal and at the same time he focused
on the quantum of sentence being his alternate prayer. We are
conscious of the fact that the complainant was examined as PW-
6, though he was thoroughly cross-examined on material aspects
of the case, but nothing could be brought out from his mouth to

favour the accused, so in all respects the prosecution case is

proved against the accused. There is one thing which tilts us
-8-

towards the submission of the learned counsel in respect of the
quantum of sentence and when with the help of learned counsels
for the parties, the statement of the complainant was read
thoroughly, we stuck there where the complainant stated that
since morning till the time of occurrence the atmosphere was
peaceful and that it was at 01:00 p.m, when the accused got
ignited and all at once started firing on the deceased and that
even the complainant could not say that what prompted the
accused to kill his mother and even no motive was given and no
attempt was made by the prosecution especially the Investigating
Officer to dig out the cause for commission of the offence. The
weakness and absence of motive react on the quantum of
sentence and here too the prosecution could not bring anything in
black and white which could be the definite cause of the murder.

In case titled Ghulam Sabir Vs.State (2017 SCMR
807), it was held that:-

9. While assessing from all angels, this Court reaches
to an inescapable conclusion that it was no one else, but the
appellant, who committed the murder but keeping in view the

circumstances in which the murder was committed, this Court
Kae

-9-

finds no other option but to reduce the sentence from death to
imprisonment for life, as till date the cause could not be known.
Resultantly, this criminal appeal is partially allowed and the
sentence of death awarded to the appellant is reduced to

imprisonment for life and the murder reference is answered in

negative.

10. Above are the reasons of our short order of the even

date.
