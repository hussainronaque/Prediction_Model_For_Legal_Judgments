ROOH-UL- AMIN KHAN, J:- Through this — single
order this court proposes to decide this and the connected
Cr.Misc. BA No. 939-P/2021 and Cr.Misc. BA No. 1019-
P/2021 as these are the outcome of a single FIR No.
15/2021 dated 03.03.2021 under section 9-C /15 Control
of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 registered at Police
Station ANF Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar.

2. According to the prosecution case, on 03.03.2021
on receipt of secret information about transportation of
huge quantity of addictive tablets to Afghanistan via
Torkham Boarder, the ANF police started checking
passenger’s vehicle and in the meanwhile, the accused-

petitioners holding yellow shopping bags in their hands,
who disclosed their names as Muhammad Tahir Bakhtani,
Noor Bahadar, Haroon Mohmand, Nasrat Ullah and
Khalid. On search of the shopping bags, addictive tablets
i.e. clomfranil, Nervin, Rivotril 2mg, vauom 10 mg,
Arinac 400 and 40 mg were recovered hence, the present
FIR.

3. Having heard the arguments of learned counsel
for the parties, perusal of record would reveal that though
certain medicines have been shown recovered from the
personal possession of each petitioners but none of the
recovered items are listed in any schedule under Rule 2(1)
of the Drugs of Abuses, Controlled Chemicals,
Equipment and Materials) Rules, 2001. According to
chemical analysis, benzodiazepine drug was detected in
some of the parcels/samples, which is not a prohibited
substance as enumerated in schedule under Rule 2(1). Not
only the same is not listed in any schedule but also neither
fall in the definition of “control chemical” nor of “high
risk” drugs. So far as the positive report of
pseudoephedrine in some medicines is concerned, no
doubt, it is a control chemical under schedule —V but the
same is one of content and ingredients of some of
medicines, which are frequently available in open market,

on all medical stores. It cannot be denied that the
medicines allegedly recovered from the possession of the
petitioners are manufactured from re-known companies
like Sun and Abbot Pharmaceuticals and according to its
introductory literature, these medicines are mostly used
for obsessive compulsive disorder with muscular
weakness associated with repeated attacks of sleepiness,
to maintain a consistent level of medicine in the body. It
is yet to be determined by the learned trial court after
recording of prosecution evidence that the recovered
tablets were having narcotics and prohibited substance or
otherwise, however at this stage makes the case of
accused-petitioners one of further inquiry entitling them
to the concession of bail.

4. Resultantly, this and the connected Cr.Misc. BA
No. 939-P/2021 and Cr.Mis. BA No. 1019-P/2021 are
allowed. The accused-petitioners are ordered to be
released on bail provided they furnish bail bonds to the
tune of Rs. 80,000/- (rupees eighty thousand) with two
local, reliable, resourceful and men of means sureties each
in the like amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD.
