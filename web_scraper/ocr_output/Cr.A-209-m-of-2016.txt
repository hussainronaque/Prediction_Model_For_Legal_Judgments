6. On the death of the deceased then
injured, prosecution inserted Section 302 P.P.C in
the case and submitted fresh challan in Court on
03.05.2015. The appellant was formally indicted for
the murder of deceased to which he pleaded not
guilty and opted to face the trial. Prosecution
examined 16 witnesses in all whereafter statement of
the appellant under Section 342, Cr.P.C was
recorded on 04.08.2016 wherein he pleaded
innocence and denied the allegations of prosecution.
At last stage of the trial, the arguments were heard
and finally the appellant was convicted and
sentenced vide judgment dated 06.10.2016, the
detail has already been given earlier, hence, this

appeal.

Z. Learned counsel for the appellant, inter
alia, contended that the trial Court has mainly relied
upon the alleged confession of the appellant
recorded on oath which is inadmissible under the
law. He further argued that the appellant has
retracted from his confession during his examination
under Section 342, Cr.P.C and such confession

cannot be used against him most particularly when

there is no convincing corroborative evidence

available on record. Learned counsel added that the
alleged occurrence took place at 19:20 hours in the
month of February when there was pitch dark but no
source of light has been shown by prosecution which
fact has made the identification of the accused
doubtful. He argued that the alleged eye witnesses
are interested being related to the deceased and their
testimony cannot be relied upon for conviction of
the appellant. Learned counsel was of the view that
death of the deceased was not the result of the
injuries sustained by him in the alleged occurrence
as reports of the doctors do not support that version
of the prosecution with clarity besides, the statement
of deceased then injured in shape of his report
cannot be considered as dying declaration in view of
the remoteness of death from the date of occurrence.
He submitted that the impugned judgment being
against the law and evidence on record, be set at
naught and the appellant be acquitted of the charge

on accepting this appeal.

8. Learned counsel appearing for State and.
learned counsel for the complainant submitted that
there is not only judicial confession of the appellant

but also the statement of the deceased then injured

Tajamuyest|

DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Iorahim Khan
Mr, Justice Ishtfag Ibrahim

{(Cr.A No. 209-M of 2016 Fazal Zada Vs. The State and others}

supported by circumstantial evidence on the record
which duly proves the guilt of appellant beyond
reasonable shadow of doubt. They were of the view
that recording judicial confession of the appellant
was mere a procedural irregularity not capable of
rendering the confession inadmissible as the
statement of appellant contains true narrations of
facts and it cannot be discarded merely on the
ground that a prohibited procedure was adopted by
Magistrate while recording his confession. They
maintained that when there is nothing on the record
showing that the appellant was misled and injustice
was caused to him by adopting such procedure for
recording his confession, the evidentiary value
thereof is still intact. They further submitted that
conviction of the appellant is the result of
overwhelming evidence brought by prosecution
against him which has properly been appreciated by
learned trial Court, therefore, this appeal be
dismissed and capital punishment be awarded to the

appellant by allowing the criminal revision.

9. We have gone through the record in

light of the valuable assistance of learned counsel

{Cr.A No. 209-M of 2016 Fazal Zada Vs. The State ond others)

for the parties and learned counsel appearing on

behalf of State.

10. The report in this case has been lodged
by deceased then injured soon after the occurrence
in Casualty Saidu Sharif wherein he directly charged
the appellant for causing him stab injuries. The
narrations in the initial report are natural and
straightforward duly supported by ocular account
and circumstantial evidence. We agree with the
submission of learned counsel for the appellant that
statement of the deceased then injured was not a
dying declaration as he died after 19/20 days of
lodging the report without bringing on record cause
of death with clarity but the report could not be
brushed aside at all rather it should be considered in
association with the remaining prosecution evidence
for safe administration of justice. Contents of the
initial report recorded vide Madd No. 35 dated
08.02.2015 suggest that the injured had narrated the
incident in a simple and straightforward manner who
was not sure at that moment that he would remain
alive. The report is fully corroborated by medical
evidence, surrounding circumstances and confidence

inspiring ocular account. The record is mute that the

report was the result of consultation or tutoring,
which had been made by the deceased voluntarily
without any probability of promptitude as to the
cause of his death and the same had been reduced
into writing by police officer, an independent
witness. Prosecution has also examined son of the
deceased namely Parwaish Khan as PW-6;
according to his statement, he was inside his house
when informed by children regarding the
occurrence; thereafter he came to the spot where he
found his father in injured condition who told him at
that time that he (deceased) was stabbed by
appellant. The deceased has lodged the report in
presence of his son PW-6 who has duly signed the
same as seconder. Had the deceased any mala fide
against the appellant for dragging him in a false case
he would have cited the name of his son as eye
witness of the occurrence. Though PW-6 was at a
short distance from the spot where his father was
subjected to stabs by the appellant but he made no
endeavor for supporting his father’s version in a
dishonest manner rather he recorded his statement in
a natural and usual way. He denied the suggestion of

defence counsel by stating that:

The mode in which the injured and his
son described the event; presence of the PW inside
his house at the time of occurrence and thereafter his
arrival to the spot are the circumstances making a
series of events brought on the record in a forthright
and undoubted manner which can duly be
considered under the rule of res gestae for reaching
at a just conclusion in this case. Essence of the said
rule is that a fact which, though not in issue, is so
connected with the fact in issue as to form part of
the same transaction becomes relevant by itself
under Article 19 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order,
1984. When we look into the statement of the
deceased then injured, the same appears to be
spontaneous and free of any exaggeration.
Admittedly the occurrence took place before Isha
prayers; this fact emerges not only from the report
lodged at 19:20 hours but also from the cross-
examination of PW-6 who stated that:

Leaving of the houses by the deceased
then injured as well as the eye witnesses at the
relevant time is not unusual as it was Isha vela and
people normally go outside their houses for
performing the Isha prayers; similar is the arrival of
PW-6 to the spot soon after the occurrence and
shifting of the injured to the hospital. All the above
events being the facts, circumstances and
declarations growing out of the main fact ie the
occurrence and they are closely connected with each

other excluding all doubts of fabrication.

il. Prosecution has examined PW-7
Muhammad Iqbal and PW-8 Amir Zeb as eye
witnesses of the occurrence. Although PW-7 is
resident of Katlang, a far off area, but his presence
stands established in view of cross-examination of
PW-6 who stated that:

However, to be on safe side, we do not
consider his statement for resolving the present
controversy. Next is the statement of PW-8 Amir
Zeb who has also recorded statements confirming all

the important aspects of the case mentioned by the

deceased then injured in his report. Admittedly, he is
the resident of the said vicinity and lives close to the
house of complainant which fact is clear from his
cross-examination by stating that:

BS. SA BING SF

In view of the facts that houses of the
complainant and this PW are closely situated and he
also came out of his house for performing the Isha
prayers, his presence on the spot at the relevant time
could not be termed as fabricated or procured by
prosecution. The detail of timings and events
appearing in his cross-examination is truthful and
there is nothing convincing in the remaining direct
and circumstantial evidence in the light of which his
testimony could be disbelieved. We would not
subscribe to the contention of learned counsel for the
appellant that he has not been named in the F.LR. It
would be against the norms of justice most
particularly in view of the attending circumstances of
this case, to disbelieve the testimony of a witness
solely on the ground that his name was not cited in

the F.I.R. There is no universal rule that evidence of

Tojamut/Pse|

DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad ibrehim Khan
Mr. Justice ishtiag Ibrahirn

{CA No. 209-M of 2016 Fazal Zada Vs. The State and others}
-15-

a witness not named in the F.LR will be disbelieved
in all circumstances because each and every case is to
be adjudged in light of its own facts in the light
whereof the credibility of a witness is to be
determined. In this regard we would seek guidance

from the judgment in the case titled “Siraj Din Vs.

Kala _and another” (PLD 1964 Supreme Court 26)

wherein it has been held that:

“The F. I. R. given by Siraj Din at the Police
Post could however have been used only to
contradict its maker, if he gave evidence at the
trial. It could not be used as substantive
evidence to belie the claim of the other PWs,
to be eye-witnesses, by the mere fact of the
omission of any reference to them therein.
Siraj Din may have had his own reasons for
not naming the shopkeepers or Aslam P. W.
as witnesses of the crime. This was a case of a
blood feud and he may have entertained the
notion that businessmen of the locality would
be chary of involving themselves in this
quarrel between two families and may not be
willing to depose as witnesses in this case. The
suspicion may well be entertained as seems to
have been done in the High Court that Gulzar
Hasan and Ghulam Mohyuddin had been
named by Siraj Din in the F.ILR. as
eye-witnesses, on the strength of his
confidence that they would be willing to
support the prosecution story on account of
intimate relations with him. The story put

forward that they were not known to Siraj

Din previously, appears to be open to grave
doubt. But even in the first report it was
clearly specified that the incident had
happened in front of Bashir green-grocer's
shop. It was, therefore, natural for the
shopkeepers round about the spot to have
seen what happened before their very eyes”.

12. No doubt, the occurrence took place at
the time when dark had prevailed but PW-8 Amir
Zeb has mentioned the source of light in his
statement. Moreover it is a case of stabbing which
can only be caused from a close distance, therefore,
identification of the appellant by the deceased and
eye witness in the circumstances was not so
improbable to make the prosecution version
doubtful. Although slight contradictions do occur in
statements of eye witness but the same are negligible
by giving cumulative effect to their statements. It is
well settled that each and every variation in the
evidence could not affect or impair the intrinsic
value of the evidence and all those variations which
did not have any substantial bearing on the salient
features of the prosecution case could be safely
ignored as they would not affect the credibility of
the witnesses. Another contention of learned counsel

for the appellant that the eye witness is interested

Tajamutes+|

Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

{Cr_A No. 209-4 of 2016 Fazal Zado Vs. The State ond others)
-17-

being related to the deceased, has no force in view of
the attending circumstances of the occurrence. It is
well settled that evidence of an interested witness
can be relied upon for conviction of an accused
provided his statement is corroborated by
independent evidence. In the present case the
statements of the mentioned eye witness is in line
with the version mentioned in the F.I.R which was
registered at the behest of deceased then injured.
Similarly, there are statements of the remaining PWs
coupled with circumstantial evidence, especially the
recovery of crime weapon on pointation of the
appellant, collected during the course of
investigation which duly corroborates the ocular
account. Thus, in the considered view of this Court,
statement of the eye witness could not be discarded
merely on the ground that is relative of the deceased
when otherwise he is honest and frank in his

deposition.

13. Reverting to judicial confession of the
appellant, no doubt his statement shows that it was
recorded on oath; however, it was a procedural
irregularity which has caused no prejudice to the

appellant. Record shows that no question was put to

Judicial Magistrate (PW-12) whether he actually
administered oath to appellant or it was mentioned
as routine in the beginning of his statement that he
was recording statement on oath. In absence of any
such question, it cannot be gathered with absolute
certainty from the words "US oli" that oath was
actually administered to appellant before recording
his judicial confession, thus, the mentioned words
would not vitiate the confession in view of the
provisions of Section 533, Cr.P.C. Recording
confession of an accused in a manner which is
prohibited under the law may be an illegality but
when the confessional statement contains true
description of facts, it may not lose the status of
evidence merely because of adopting of a procedure
prohibited under the law, unless it is shown that
accused was misled or injustice was caused to him
by adopting such procedure. Such procedural
illegality would assume the character of irregularity
which may not render the confession inadmissible.
Reliance in this regard is placed on the judgment in
the case titled “Nazeer alias Wazeer Vs. The State”

(LD 2007 Supreme Court 202).

Far more important aspect of the
judicial confession is that it is not the sole evidence
which is available on record against the appellant
but there is also the statement of the deceased’s son
and above all the statement of the eye witness PW-8
coupled with circumstantial evidence on record. By
giving cumulative effect to all the above mentioned
pieces of evidence, it appears that prosecution has
established the case against the appellant to the
extent that he caused stab blows to the complainant

then and there as mentioned in the initial report.

14. The most important aspect of this case
which invites our consideration and is needed to be
dealt with care and caution is the quantum of
sentence awarded to the appellant by learned trial
Court convicting him under Section 302 (b) P.P.C.
The occurrence took place on 11.02.2015 while the
deceased then injured died in his house on
02.03.2015 i.e after 19/20 days of the occurrence.
Post-mortem on the dead body was conducted by
(PW-3) Dr. Ghulam Rehmani. His observations

regarding the stab wounds are as under:-

1) 21 stitch wound on midline abdomen from
pelvic region to xiphisternum. (healed from
previous surgery).

2) 1 cm healed wound on left side of the
abdomen.

3) Healed wound 2 x 1 em on left costal
margin. These already mentioned before
on page-1.

4) Normal peritoneum, no free fluid. Pus,
blood and faecal matter in peritoneum

5) Serosal stitch at proximal jejunum below
duodenum distal to duodena jejunum
junction (healed).

The cause of death mentioned by this
PW in his report is “most likely chronic pulmonary
embolism resulting in respiratory failure, a common
and most likely “post-operative complication”. He
based his finding on the reports of Department of
Forensic and Toxicology KMC, Punjab Forensic
Science Agency and final conclusion of PW-4 Dr.
Mir Alam Afridi, head of the Forensic Department,
Saidu Medical College, Swat which has already
been reproduced herein above. The term most likely
used in the medical evidence is of utmost
importance and needs discussion. The word ‘likely’
according to Cambridge Dictionary means that if
something is likely, it will probably happen or
expected and the word “most” increases the degree
of the probability of that happening. In our view
probability after all is probability whether less or
more which cannot be considered as equivalent to

certainty, an antonym of that term. In view of the

‘Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim

{Cr.A No. 205-M of 2016 Fazal Zada Vs. The State and others}

above definition of the word “most likely” the cause
of death according to medical evidence appears to be
“most probably chronic pulmonary embolism”
which means a blockage of an artery in the lungs by
a substance that has moved from elsewhere in the
body through the bloodstream (embolism) which is
commonly caused due to blood clot in the veins.
Admittedly, the doctors in their reports have not
mentioned the stab wounds as the direct result of
death but described the cause thereof as “most likely
chronic pulmonary embolism” but the doctors who
were examined as PWs in this case have not
specifically stated that the pulmonary embolism
occurred to the injured due to stab injuries though
they mentioned the cause as_ post-operative
complications but once again the word ‘most likely’
has been used. In other words no connexion between
the stab injuries and pulmonary embolism has been
established by prosecution meaning thereby that
there was novus _actus_interveniens (new act
intervening). In light of the principle embodied in
the maxim it can be concluded that there was not
such a direct relationship between the death and the

injuries that the one could be treated as flowing

directly from the other. In the case of “Talib Ali

alias Talib Hussain Vs. State” (P.L.J_ 1974 Cr.C
(B.J) 434) a similar issue was discussed which is

reproduced herein below:

“It is, thus, clear that some operation was
conducted upon Ghulam Qadir on the day
when he was admitted in the hospital for
removal of some pellets. Despite the fact that
the said operation was performed, there is no
clear evidence that any anti-tetanus serum
was given to him. It has already been
observed that the injuries received by Ghulam
Qadir were not sufficient in themselves in the
ordinary course of nature to cause death.
Thus, the tetanus, which developed during the
stay of the deceased in the hospital and which
was the direct cause of his death, appears to
have developed on account of careless medical
treatment. In these circumstances, it is not
possible to hold that the injuries received by
the deceased were the direct cause of his
death. In Said Amin Vs. The State” (PLD
1959 Lah.451) it has been laid down as

follows.

“The language of S. 299 Penal Code indicates
that the offence of culpable homicide can be
committed only if death is caused by the doing
of an act with the requisite intention or
knowledge. If death is not caused by such an
act, but something else intervenes between the
doing of the act and the death of the person
concerned, the offender would not be guilty of
the offence of culpable homicide but he might
be guilty of some other offence. Such case, for

its decision, depends upon its own facts. If

death of a person is the direct result of an act
committed by another person, with the requisite
intention or knowledge or if as a result of that
act some thin else intervenes such as gangrene,
tetanus, peritonitis etc, which is the direct result
of that injury, the offender would be guilty of
the offence of culpable homicide. If, however,
something intervenes and the death of the
injured man is not the direct result of the
injury, it cannot be said that death had resulted
Srom the doing of the act which caused the
injury and, therefore, S.299 of the Pakistan
Penal Code will have no application”.

In this case, the death of the injured
man was not the direct result of the injures
but on account of the careless and unskillful
treatment of the medical authorities who
operated upon him for extracting the pellets
and appear to have failed to administer the
ant-tetanus serum and to observe the other
necessary precautions and, in _ these
circumstances, it cannot be said that the death
of Ghulam Qadir was the direct result of the
injury caused by Talib Ali. Hence, the
appellant cannot be held guilty of having
committed the offence of culpable homicide
and convicted under S. 302 P.P.C.”

15. The doctors have been cross-examined
by defence counsel. PW-3 Dr. Ghulam Rehmani
stated in his cross-examination that all the wounds
were healed and he found his lungs normal at the

time of his post-mortem examination:-

The above abstracts from statements of
the doctors clearly show that the deceased then
injured was discharged from hospital after his
recovery from the injuries. The medical evidence
also transpires that no defect in the lungs of the
deceased was detected at the time when he was
examined soon after the occurrence. The medical
term embolism has been defined in Dorland’s
Pocket Medical Dictionary (28" Edition) as “the
sudden blocking of an artery by a clot or foreign

material which has been brought to its sight of

lodgment by the blood current” while pulmonary
embolism has been defined as “obstruction of the
pulmonary artery or one of its branches by an
embolus, the term next defined in the dictionary
according to which it is a mass of clotted blood or
other material brought by the blood from one vessel
and forced into a smaller one, obstructing the
circulation”. Another term air embolism has also
been defined in the said dictionary according to
which it is caused “due to air bubbles entering the
veins from trauma, surgical procedures, or severe
decompression sickness”. On comparison of both
the definitions given for the terms ‘pulmonary
embolism’ and ‘air embolism’ reproduced herein
above, there appears a difference of the words
“surgical procedure” which have not been used
while explaining the medical term ‘pulmonary
embolism’ from which it can be inferred that surgery
may cause ‘air embolism’ but not the ‘pulmonary
embolism’ which is the point under consideration in
the present case. From the statements of doctors
(PW-3 & PW-4) and the above mentioned dictionary
meanings of ‘pulmonary embolism’ we reach to the

conclusion that may be the death have occurred due

to chronic pulmonary embolism but there is nothing
on the record from which it could finally be
concluded that the ‘pulmonary embolism’ was
caused either by the injuries sustained by deceased
or due to his surgery soon after the occurrence. The
reports of the doctors who were examined as PWs in
this case, clearly show that they are not certain in
their conclusion that the cause of death was
pulmonary embolism even they are not sure that the
deceased was suffering from the said disorder. In
such situation, how can we consider the ambiguous
opinion of doctors for awarding capital punishment
to the appellant. Keeping in view the age and
physique of the deceased and his death after 19/20
days of the occurrence on his recovery from the
previous injuries, it will be highly unsafe to hold that
death of the deceased was the result of stab injuries
he sustained in the occurrence, as such, Section 302
P.P.C cannot be attracted in this case rather it would
be fairer and safer to convict the appellant under
Sections 324/337-D, P.P.C keeping in view the
prevailing circumstances of the case. Wisdom is

derived from the judgment in the case titled

“Muhammad Rahim Vs. Kajeerullah and another”

969 PCr.LJ 18 Supreme Court) wherein it has
been held that:-

“In this state of evidence it could not be safely
found that peritonitis was caused by the
abdominal injury inflicted on the deceased by
the respondent. The learned Judges in the
High Court were, therefore, justified in
altering the conviction of the respondent to
section 326, P.P.C and no valid ground is
made to appear for interference by this Court.

The appeal is dismissed”.

16. As a backdrop of the above discussion,
this appeal is partially allowed, conviction of the
appellant is maintained, however, the sentence is
altered from 302 (b) P.P.C to 324 P.P.C and
sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment. He is
also convicted under Section 337-D P.P.C and
sentenced to 5 years rigorous imprisonment with
payment of arsh i.e one-third of diyat payable to the
legal heirs of complainant or in default he is to be
kept in prison as a person undergoing simple
imprisonment or he may approach the trial Court as
provided under Section 337-x P.P.C. The
substantive sentences shall run concurrently with
each other. Benefit of 382-B, has already been
