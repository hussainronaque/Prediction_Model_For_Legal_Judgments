Courts below have concurrently
refused return of the vehicle in
question to the petitioner, hence,

this petition.
3. Learned counsel for the
petitioners, inter alia, contended that that both
the learned Courts below have wrongly
dismissed applications of the petitioners for
return of their respective vehicles because
they were bona fide purchasers of the vehicles
in question and there was no evidence on
record which could have been shown that
either the vehicles were stolen property or
ever used in any crime. They also argued that
the respective petitioners had no role
whatsoever in tampering, welding, re-
refitting, re-stamping of chassis plates thereof,

hence, they could not be refused the custody

Sabz Ali” (8.B) BLE VICE,
-15-

of their vehicles. They also contended that the
vehicles were parked in the respective police
stations without any protection, shed etc and
were therefore exposed to damage and decay.
They further contended that there were
apprehensions of misuse of the vehicles in
question while in custody of the police. They
maintained that prima facie mens rea of the
petitioners regarding the alleged tampering etc
of the chassis numbers of the vehicles in
question were not available on the record,
therefore, they could not be deprived of their
validly purchased property. They also added
that the F.S.L reports could not be relied upon
particularly in the circumstances when none
of the petitioners has been associated with, or
even issued a notice of the date & time of
chemical examination of the vehicles. They
further submitted that the impugned orders
may be quashed and the vehicles in questions

be returned to the petitioners on superdari.

4. On the other hand, learned A.A.G ©
representing the State contended that chassis
plates of all the vehicles in question were
tampered, these have therefore been rightly
seized by the police. He further contended that
such like tampered vehicles were being
frequently used in terrorist activities and other
heinous crimes. He added that it was a normal
practice in this country that on a single
superdari order of the Court qua one
tampered vehicle, several vehicles were
plying on the roads without ‘any proper
checking, which practice may only be curbed
by discouraging superdari of tampered
vehicles. He also contended that as all
petitioners have been pleading innocence and
ignorance in purchase of the vehicles from
other persons. So, they could knock the doors
of the civil Courts against the vendors for
committing fraud, by selling them tampered
vehicles. in consideration of handsome

amounts. The ground of their bona fide

Sabz Al’ (S.B} HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE JSHTIAO JBRABIAL
-17-

purchase of vehicles would not however
entitle them to return of the tampered
vehicles. Plying of these illegal vehicles on
the road were not justified and its leaving to
ply on the roads would amount to issue them a
license for landing illegal vehicles on the
roads. He also argued that chassis numbers of
most of the vehicles in questions have been
matching with other registered vehicles, thus,
the factum of tampering the chassis numbers
of the vehicles in question cannot be ruled
out. He accordingly requested for dismissal of

these petitions.

5. Arguments heard and record gone
through.
6. Be that as it may, all the

petitioners may be owners of their respective
vehicles on the basis of bona fide purchases
through agreements/bargain receipts and ‘at
the most there would be no rival claimant of
the vehicles in question, however, all the

vehicles were allegedly seized by the police

Sabz Ali (S.B) HONBLE MR, JUSTICE ISHTIAO LORAUIM
-18-

under sections 523/550 Cr.P.C and during
inquiry u/s 156 (3) Cr.P.C. The chassis plates
of all the vehicles in question were found
tampered, welded, refitted or re-stamped, not
decipherable for the reasons of rubbing off its
chassis plates etc according to the respective
reports of the F.S.L. At this juncture,
presumption of truth is attached to the F.S.L
reports. Besides, certain other vehicles are
also plying on road having same chassis
numbers in most of the cases. Thus, the
question arises whether such vehicles which
are having tampered, re-stamped, welded or
refitted chassis plates can be allowed to ply on
the roads?. The answer is obviously ‘no’,
since the law on the subject does not permit
the same, therefore, in firm view of this Court;
the arguments advanced by learned A.A.G in
this regard were carrying substantial weight.
Reliance may also be placed here on the case
of ‘Ch. Magbool Ahmed Vs. Customs, Federal

Excise and Sales Tax, Appellate Tribunal and

Sabz Ali = (S.B) HON’ BLE M u Ht
-19-

3 others’ (2009 SCMR 226), wherein it has

been held that:

Smuggled vehicle with proved
tampered chassis frame and not a
smuggled vehicle with non-
tampered chassis frame---Held,
outright confiscation of the vehicle
through order-in-original under
CL(89) of S.156(1) of the Customs
Act, 1969 read with S.R.O.
No.574(1)/2005 dated 6-6-2005 was
lawfully passed and did not suffer
from any illegality---Petition for
leave to appeal against judgment of
the High Court upholding said order
was dismissed.”

Similar view has also been

adopted by this Court in the case of ‘Ali

Bahadar Vs. Toyota Indus Motor Company

LTD. through Chief _Executive/Managin
Director and 03 others’ (2019 YLR 622,

Peshawar), wherein it has been held that:

“5. With regard to entitlement
of petitioner for custody of the
vehicle, suffice to say that though
according to Registration
Authority, registration number of
the vehicle in question is genuine,
however, as per FSL report, its
‘chassis number has been found
deciphered. In this view of the
matter, we, are not inclined to
hand over custody of the vehicle
in question to the petitioner, as it
will amount to issuance of a
license by the Court for plying a
tampered and  un-authorized
vehicle on road.”

It would be relevant to mention

here that some of the vehicles in question

though are registered with different Excise &

Taxation Offices, however, after the alleged

purchase by the petitioners, most of them have

not so far been transferred in the names of the
petitioners. Section 23 of the Motor Vehicle

Ordinance, 1965 restricts use of the vehicle

which is either not registered/transferred by

the owner in a specified period of time from

the date of its purchase. For ready reference

section 23 ibid is reproduced as under:

Sabz Alu*

(8.8)

“23. (1) No person shall drive any
motor vehicle and no owner of a
motor vehicle shall cause or permit
the vehicle to be driven in any place
unless the vehicle is registered in
accordance with this Chapter and
the vehicle carries a registration
mark displayed in the prescribed
manner.

Explanation: A motor vehicle shall
not be deemed to be registered in
accordance with this chapter. if the
certificate of registration has been
suspended or cancelled.

(2) Nothing in this section shail
apply to a motor vehicle while being
driven within the limits of
jurisdiction of a registering authority
to or from the appropriate place of
registration for the purpose of being
registered under sections 24, 26, 40
or 41 or to a motor vehicle
exempted from the provisions of this

SALE M U i if
-21-

Chapter while in the possession of a
dealer in motor vehicles.

Section 32 of the ibid Ordinance

is reproduced as under:

“32. (1) Within thirty days of the
transfer of ownership of any motor
vehicle registered under _ this
Chapter, the transferee shall report
the transfer to the registering
authority within whose jurisdiction
he ordinarily resides and shall
forward the certificate of
registration of the vehicle to that
registering authority together with
the prescribed fee in order that
particulars of the transfer of
ownership may be entered therein.”

(2) A registering authority other
than the original registering
authority making any such entry
shall communicate the transfer of
ownership to the original registering
authority.”

In light of the above referred law,
every owner is bound to transfer the vehicle
within 30 days of its purchase. However, in
none of these cases pertaining to registered
vehicles, the law has been followed. It has
also been observed that this provision of law
is not normally followed by a lot of people in
the country. Even the concerned authorities
are also not taking care of the same, which
subsequently creates troublesome issues for

the owners of the vehicles as well as the

Sabz Ali = (S.B) IN BLE. W TN
-22-

concerned authorities. Thus, the concerned
authorities in order to minimize the problems
of majority of people are also directed to
strictly adhere to the aforesaid provisions of
law in accordance with prescribed manner.
Moreover, according to section 33 of the ibid
Ordinance, any alteration effected in the
vehicle is required to be reported within 14
days to the authority in whose jurisdiction the
owner resided and the authority is required to
issue a certificate of registration of the altered
vehicle to the concerned authority where such
altercation has to be entered into, however, no
such question would be under consideration in

any of these petitions.

8. This Court is also conscious of
the fact that certain vehicles amongst the
vehicles in question are Non-Custom-Paid
(NCP). Indeed, any vehicle, which is imported
into Pakistan, inter alia, is identified through
its chassis and engine numbers besides colour
and model and thus is accordingly registered

on the basis of the import documents.

Sabz AW" (S.B) Ra CE ISH M
7 23-

9. It would not be out of place to
mention here that plying of Non-Custom Paid
(NCP) vehicles in this part of the province due
to certain exemptions, is not illegal, however,
superdari of the NCP vehicle having
tampered, welded, refitted or re-stamped
chassis plate would be considered on the same
touchstone as that of the custom
paid/registered vehicles in light of the
observations recorded herein above in this

order.

10. So far as the contention of
learned counsels for the’ petitioners that the
petitioners are bona fide purchasers of the
vehicles is concerned, suffice it to note that on
the basis of terms and conditions in their
agreements with the sellers of the vehicles in
question, the petitioners would be at liberty to
approach the proper forum for redressal of
their legal rights against the persons from
whom they had purchased the vehicles, if so

advised. The request of custody of vehicle

having welded and refitted chassis frame has

recently been declined by the apex Court in

case of ‘Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
through Secretary Excise and Taxation

Department Civil Secretariat, Peshawar_and
others Vs. Sarfraz Khan and another’ (2020

SCMR 1410) by holding that:

“Welded and refitted chassis frame---
Excise and taxation department seized
the subject vehicle as on forensic
examination it was found to have a
welded and refitted chassis frame---
High Court set-aside the seizure order
and directed the department to hand
over the vehicle to the respondent
(owner)---Held, that S. 33 of the
Provincial Motor Vehicles Ordinance,
1965 did not distinguish alteration in
the motor vehicles in any manner
whatsoever---Any alteration effected in
the vehicle was required to be reported
within 14 days to the authority in
whose jurisdiction the owner resided
and the authority was required to issue
a certificate of registration of the
subject vehicle to the concerned
authority where such alteration had to
be entered into---No such exercise was
undertaken in the present case---
Respondent conceded that such
alteration was not carried out by him
but by the person from whom he had
purchased the vehicle---Liability and
responsibility vested on the person
making such alteration in any manner
whatsoever---If the respondent had-
purchased the vehicle without taking
due care and complying with the
requirements of law, he could not claim
to be a bona fide purchaser---
Respondent could claim damages from
the person from whom he purchased the
subject vehicle---Petition for leave to
appeal was converted into appeal and
allowed and impugned order of High
Court was set aside.”

11. It is necessary to note here that
upon completion of inquiry/investigation in
the matter and examination of the vehicle
through F.S.L, the police complete its job.
Meaning to say that police is not required to
find out that who has tampered the vehicle
because it is not the act of an ordinary person
and the purchaser is required to take due care

at the time of purchase of the vehicle.

12. In view of the above, the
impugned orders are based on correct and
legal observations of the learned Courts
below, to which no exception can be taken.
Resultantly, all these petitions are meritless,
which are accordingly dismissed. If any
vehicle (s) amongst aforesaid questioned
vehicles is/are already returned to any person
(s) on any order (s) of the learned lower
Courts, the same shall be forthwith seized by
the police/concerned authorities. All the
vehicles in question shall be parked in the

State warehouse against proper receipt and

shall not be used by anyone. If any
Government official or any other
unauthorized person is found in using of any
such like seized vehicle, he (the official)
would be liable for departmental proceedings
as well as under the relevant provisions of the
Pakistan Penal Code and Anti-Corruption

Laws.

13. In these cases, certain objections
raised by the learned counsels for the
petitioners (though may not be having any leg
to stand on), however, in order to remove any
flaw in process of inquiry and for satisfaction
of the owner/possessor of the vehicle, it is
ordered that henceforth at the time of seizing
of a vehicle by the police/concerned
authorities, a photograph of vehicle and its
chassis plate shall invariably be taken and
same shall be annexed with the recovery
memo/inventory memo. Any recovery memo
whereby vehicle is seized being not

accompanied with such a photograph, the

concemed Judicial Magistrate may not permit
inquiry into the matter u/s 156 (3) Cr.P.C. The
office is directed to communicate a copy of
this order to all the District & Sessions Judges
of Malakand Division for circulation amongst

the Judicial Magistrates.
