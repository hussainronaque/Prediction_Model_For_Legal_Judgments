Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, through development of

the provisions of section 260 to 265 (both
inclusive) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure,1898 (V of 1898), but the limit of
punishment mentioned in sub-section (2) of
section 262 thereof shall not be applicable.
(6) Unless any specific provision is provided
in this Act, the provision of Criminal
Procedure Code, 1898 (V of 1898) shall
apply to all the proceedings under this Act.

6. In the instant case, the FIR registered against the
petitioner has been questioned on the ground that it was not
reported by the Licensing Authority or an officer authorized by
it in this behalf, as such, we endeavor to further elaborate this
matter. Section 154 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898
deal with registration of FIR, it is reproduced for convenience
of reference:

“154. Information in cognizable cases. Every

information relating to the commission of a

cognizable offence if given orally to an officer

in charge of a police station, shall be reduced

to writing by him or under his direction, and
be read over to the informant ; and every
-6-

such information, whether given in writing or
reduced to writing as aforesaid, shall be
signed by the person giving it, and the
substance thereof shall be entered in a book
to be kept by such officer in such form as the
1[Provincial Government] may prescribe in
this behalf

Provided that if the information is given by
the woman against whom an offence under
section 336B, section 354, section 354A,
section 376 or section 509 of the Pakistan
Penal Code, 1860 (Act XLV of 1860)is alleged
to have been committed or attempted, than
such information shall be recorded by an
investigating officer in presence of a female
police officer or a female family member or
any other person with consent of the
complainant, as the case may be

Provided further that if the information, given
by the woman against whom an offence
under section 336B, section354, section
354A, section 376 or section 509 of the
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (Act XLV of 1860)
is alleged to have been committed or
attempted, is distressed such information
shall be recorded by an investigating officer at
residence of the complainant or at a
convenient place of the complainant's choice
in presence of a police officer or family
member or any other person with consent of
the complainant, as the case may be.”

7. F.I.R. under section 154 Cr.P.C can be registered
by an informant about any occurrence and necessarily he may
not be an aggrieved person while section 86 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Mines and Mineral Act, 2017 provides that the
offence relating to violation of its provisions shall be reported
to the respective police station by the Licensing Authority or
an officer authorized by it in this behalf. In this case, the
Mineral Guard of the relevant office of the respondent-

department has reported for registration of F.I.R., allegedly
-7-

complaining about violation of sections 56 and 86 of the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mines and Mineral Act, 2017.

8. Two principles of law are applicable to the case in
hand, one is that where law required an act to be done ina
particular manner it has to be done in that manner alone and
such dictate of law could not be termed as mere technicality.
Reference can be made to the case of ‘Muhammad Anwar
and others Vs. Mst. Ilyas Begum and others’ (PLD 2013
SC 255) and the other principle that is the foremost is that
where there is conflict of procedural law on the same subject,
special law has to be applied. Reference can be made to the
case of ‘Tanveer Hussain Vs. Divisional Superintendent,
Pakistan Railways and two others’ (PLD 2006 SC 249),
PLD 2019 Islamabad 1, 2019 P.Cr.L.J 504, PLD 2019
SINDH 209 and PLD 2019 Lahore 429.

9. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mines and Mineral Act,
2017 being a special law wherein section 86 authorizes only
the Licensing Authority or an officer authorized by it in this
behalf to report violation of the provisions of the Act ibid,
however from the record we have not found any authorization
from the Licensing Authority, thus, the registration of F.I.R by
an unauthorized person in the instant case cannot be
considered as a legal F.I.R. The august Supreme Court of
Pakistan in case of ‘Syed Mushahid Shah and others Vs.
Federal Investment Agency and others’ (2017 SCMR 1218)

held that where there is conflict between a special law and
-8-

general law, the former will prevail over the latter, as such, it is
held that section 154 Cr.P.C shall be read with section 86 of
the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mines and Mineral Act, 2017and the
word informant mentioned in section 154 Cr.P.C shall be
considered as substituted with the word ‘Licensing Authority or
the officer authorized by it in this behalf for the purpose of
registration of F.I.R.

10. For what has been discussed hereinabove, this writ
petition is allowed. The F.I.R impugned having been

registered in violation of law is struck down.
