3. Heard. Record perused.

Imtiaz Hussain?¥10/complainant sustained injuries during the
occurrence took place in the street on 28.05.2016 at 09:40

11:10 p.m. on the statement of Imtiaz Hussain’¥?°, who
and his son Kaflain Mehmood Shah’?! while claiming

stated in their statements before the trial Court that on

Murder Reference. No.130 of 2021 &
Criminal Appeal No.60592 of 2021

5. Appellant is Damaad (son-in-law) of the complainant,

having this close relationship there is no question of his

misidentity despite the fact that occurrence took place at

night as complainant cannot take risk to falsely involve his

“Ww in the murder case of his son to ruin the matrimonial life

of his daughter, especially when in the same occurrence he

(complainant) himself sustained firearm injuries, leaving actual

culprit scot free. In these circumstances, in such like cases,

substitution of an accused is a rare phenomenon.

6. Both these eye-witnesses (Imtiaz Hussain’Y-10 and Kaflain
Mehmood Shah?w-1) were cross-examined at length but their
evidence could not be shaken during the process of cross-
examination. They have corroborated each other on all
material aspects of the case. They have also established
their presence at the time of occurrence at the place of
occurrence with their stated reasons. Their evidence is
straightforward, trustworthy and confidence inspiring.

7. The discrepancies in the statements of the PWs
pointed out by learned counsel for the appellant, are
minors and general in nature, occur in every case when
witnesses (who are human-beings) are cross-examined after a
long time of the occurrence as in present case, are not
fatal to the prosecution case.

8. Dr. Saad Abdullah’”1* during medical examination
observed firearm entry wound on left thigh of Khurram
Awais (deceased, the then injured) and firearm grazing wounds
on the fingers of right hand of Imtiaz
Hussain/injured/complainant?w-10 attributed to the
appellant. On death of Khurram Awais (deceased), Dr.
Muhammad Abdul Maalik’¥® during post-mortem
examination also observed firearm injuries on his (Khurram

Awais/deceased) dead body which were ante-mortem in
Murder Reference. No.130 of 2021 &
Criminal Appeal No.60592 of 2021

nature and were sufficient to cause death in ordinary
course of nature, therefore, the medical evidence has fully
supported the ocular account discussed above.

9. Motive of occurrence was that daughter (Mehwish) of
the complainant being wife of the appellant was not ready
to reside with him (appetant) as he was the man of bad
character but she has not been produced in support of
this motive which is not believable.

10. Recovery of pistol .30-bore on pointing out of the
appellant in presence of negative report of Punjab Forensic
Science Agency qua matching of the crime empties is
inconsequential but does not fatal to the prosecution case.

(2021 SCMR 104) “Akbar Ali and others Vs. The State and

11. Appellant has denied his involvement in this case in
his statement recorded u/s 342 Cr.P.C. and stated that he
is innocent and has falsely been involved in this case. He
has neither opted to appear as witness u/s 340 (2) Cr.P.C.
nor produced any defence evidence (except production of copies
of certain documents as Exh.DA to Exh.DF) in support of his defence
plea which has rightly been discarded by the trial Court
through the impugned judgment with sufficient reasons.
12. In view of above, if evidence of motive and recovery is
excluded from consideration, even then prosecution has
proved its case beyond shadow of doubt against the
appellant through the evidence discussed above.

13. Coming to the quantum of sentence, we have noted
some mitigating circumstances i.e. firstly, recovery of
pistol .30-bore on pointing out of the appellant in presence
of negative report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency qua
matching of the crime empties is inconsequential,
secondly, single fire shot has been attributed to the

appellant on the person of deceased, there is no allegation
Murder Reference. No.130 of 2021 &
Criminal Appeal No.60592 of 2021

of repetition and thirdly, motive has been disbelieved by
us with the reasons mentioned in para 9 of this judgment.
It is not determinable in this case as to what was the real
cause of occurrence and as to what had actually
happened immediately before the occurrence which
resulted into present unfortunate incident. (2014 SCMR
1227) “Zafar Igbal and others Vs. The State”.

14. In these circumstances, while maintaining the
conviction of the appellant (Imtiaz ulah) in offence under

Section 302(b) PPC, his sentence is altered from death to

imprisonment for life. The compensation and sentence in
default whereof awarded by the trial Court are
maintained. Convictions and sentences of the appellant
on other heads are also maintained. All the sentences of
the appellant shall run concurrently with benefit of
Section 382-B Cr.P.C.

15. Consequently, with the above said modification in
the impugned judgment, instant Criminal Appeal filed by
the appellant (Imtiaz utah) is hereby dismissed. Murder
Reference is answered in NEGATIVE and death
sentence of Imtiaz Ullah (appetiant) is NOT CONFIRMED.
