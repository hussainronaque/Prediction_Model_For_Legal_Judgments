JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT
JUDGMENT SHEET

Cr. A No. 21-A/2019.

Date of hearing 24.02.2020.

Petitioner/s (Muhammad Jaffar Khan)
by Nadeem Khan, Advocate.

Respondent/s (The State) by Mr.

Tougeer ur Rehman, Assistant Attorney
General.

AHMAD ALI. J. This criminal appeal
under section 23-A of Foreign Exchange
Regulation Act, 1947 is directed against
the judgment dated: 25.10.2018 passed by
learned Sessions Judge/Special Judge,
Abbottabad, whereby, appellant/accused
was acquitted but case property ie
Foreigh currency was ordered to be
confiscated in favor of the State.

2. Learned Assistant Attorney
General was present in the Court some
other cases, who accepted notice of the
instant appeal.

3. Arguments heard and_ record

available gone through.
4. Brief but relevant facts as
incorporated in the first information
report are that there was secret
information, that one Jaffar in his shop
situated at Chattar Plain, District,
Mansehra deals with illegal currency
business of foreign exchange, upon such
information raid was conducted at the
spot, wherein a _ person namely
Muhammad Jaffar Mahmood was found
present. Search of shop was conducted
which resulted in recovery of Pakistani
Rs. 49,000/-, Foreign currency i.e 2868
Saudi Riyals, which were taken into
possession through recovery memo dated:
14.03.2017. The above person failed to
produce any valid license or permit,
therefore, he was arrested and booked into
the above case FIR.

5. Investigation was conducted and
thereafter, complete  challan was
submitted before the Court, wherein the
accused was summoned, wherein accused
did not plead his guilt and claimed trial.

Prosecution in supports of its case,
produced as many as four PWs and then
after recording statement of accused
under section 342 Cr.P.C acquitted the
accused/appellant vide impugned
judgment. The learned trial Court vide
impugned judgment returned the
Pakistani currency to the appellant, while
the foreign currency was confiscated in
favor of the State, therefore, the instant
appeal for return of foreign currency.

6. Heard.

7. This appeal is only to the extent of
return of foreign currency, which was
recovered from the shop of appellant
alongwith Pakistani currency. Here there
is only question, whether currency can be
confiscated in favor of State when the
accused is acquitted from the charges
levelled against him after completion of
trial. In this respect in an identical case
titled: Asfandyar Khan Vs. The State etc
(Criminal Petition No. 1255), the apex
Court has discussed the issued thoroughly
and ordered for return of foreign currency

to the petitioner/appellant from whose
custody it had been recovered, the
relevant partition of the same is

reproduced, which is as under:-

We have heard the learned counsel for
the petitioner and the learned Deputy
Attorney General for Pakistan appearing
for the State or Courtâ€™s call and have
straightaway noticed that an identical
issue was resolved by this Court rhough
its order dated: 06.11.2018 passed in
Criminal petition No. 1245 of 2017
which was converted into an appeal and
the order of confiscation of foreign
currency was set-aside. It was held by
this Court in the said order as
follows:-

3. According to the learned
counsel for the petitioner once
the petitioner had _ been
acquitted of the charge under
section 4 of the Foreign
Exchange Regulation Act,
1947 no order regarding
confiscation of the recovered
foreign currency could have
been passed and the learned
Deputy Attorney-General for
Pakistan has confirmed that
acquittal of the petitioner from
the said charge had not been
assailed by the State before
this Court through any
petition or appeal. It has,
however, been maintained by
the learned Deputy Attorney-
General that confiscation of
the recovered foreign currency
was legally possible under
section 23 of the Foreign
Exchange Regulation Act,
1947. We have gone through
the provisions of section 23 of
the Foreign Exchange
Regulation Act, 1947 and have
noticed in that context that it
is only after recording a
conviction and sentence of an
accused person for
contravention of the said Act
that an additional order can
be passed by a trial Court that
the recovered foreign currency
may be confiscated.
Admittedly the conviction and
sentence of the petitioner for
the relevant offence had been
set aside by the High Court
and there was no conviction
and sentence of the petitioner
left in the field for passage or
an order regarding
confiscation of the recovered
foreign currency as an
additional order. In this view
of the matter we have not been
able to take any legitimate
exception to the contention of
the learned counsel for the
petitioner that the order
regarding confiscation of the
recovered foreign currency
passed by the trial Court and
upheld by the High Court
were against the law. This
petition is, therefore,
converted into an appeal and
the same is allowed and
consequently the order passed
by the trial Court regarding
confiscation of the recovered
foreign currency, which order
had subsequently been upheld
by the High Court, is set-aside
and it is ordered that the
recovered foreign currency
shall be returned to the
persons from whose custody it
had been recovered.
The issue involved in the present petition

is not different from the issue involved in
the above mentioned order passed by
this Court and, thus the fate of the
present petition is not to be different
from that of the earlier one.

3. This, petition is, therefore, converted
into an appeal and the same is allowed
and consequently the order passed by
the trial Court regarding confiscation of
the recovered foreign currency, which

order had subsequently been upheld by
the High Court, is set-aside and it is
ordered that the recovered foreign
currency shall be returned to the
petitioner/appellant from whose custody
it had been recovered. This petition
converted into appeal and is disposed of
in these terms.

8. In view of the above, it has been
cleared that in this case too, the appellant
has been acquitted from all the charges
levelled against him and his Pakistani
currency has also been ordered to be
disposed of. As for as the foreign
currency is concerned, though appellant
in his statement recorded under section
342 Cr.P.C denied the recovery of same,
however, we have to see the record and
according to recovery memo the foreign
currency has rightly been shown
recovered from the shop of the appellant
also in presence of marginal witnesses of
recovery, which authenticates the version
of appellant.

9. Apart from the above, there is
nothing on record which could suggest
that against the acquittal of the appellant,

the State has filed an appeal.
10. So, in view of the above detailed
discussion, this appeal is allowed and
order/judgment of learned trial Court to
the extent of confiscation of foreign
currency in favor of State is modified
with direction to return the same to the
appellant from whose shop/custody, it had
been recovered.

Announced.
24.02.2020.
