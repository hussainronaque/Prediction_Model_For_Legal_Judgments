SHAKEEL AHMAD, J: The petitioners by way of

instant petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution
of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, have made the
following prayer:

“It is, therefore, humbly prayed that on
acceptance of the instant Writ Petition, the
impugned office letter dated 19.03.2019
issued by the additional DG (HR) PESCO,
Peshawar may kindly be set aside and the
petitioners may graciously be allowed the
payment of suspension grant for whole
Suspension period from 10.11.2016 to
08.11.2017 treating it as duty on full pay
alongwith all the consequential benefits
accruing therefrom. Any other relief this
Hon’ble Court deems fit and proper may
also be granted.”

2. Precisely the facts relevant and necessary
for the adjudication of instant petition are that the

petitioners were appointed in the respondent company

as Junior Engineers (BPS-17) on contract for a period of

Page |2

one year vide appointment letters No.3129-
32/HR/PESCO Rec-2015 dated 01.02.2016, etc; that in
the light of restructuring policy introduced by Federal
Government, the Cabinet Committee on privatization
duly acknowledged by ECC and Council of Common
Interest, created an incorporated entity named PEPCO in
2007 and vested with responsibilities of generation,
transmission, distribution and billing through corporatized
nine distribution Companies termed as DISCOs, four
Generation companies GENCOs_~ and_ National
Transmission Dispatch Company NTDC and PESCO
were duly incorporated as a public limited company
under the Companies Ordinance, 1984 as one of the
nine companies, which are administratively autonomous
and leading to financial autonomy; that as per terms and
conditions of employment, services of the petitioners are
regulated by the rules and regulations in vogue in
WAPDA as no service rules or regulations are framed by
PESCO and WAPDA services rules and regulations are
adopted by the respondent-company, therefore, as per
rule 5 of the Pakistan WAPDA Employees (Efficiency
and Discipline) Rules, 1978, the petitioners were
suspended on account of poor photo billing accuracy,
amounting to misconduct, vide office orders of
suspension dated 10.11.2016, which was_ further
extended twice vide office orders dated 02.02.2017 and
07.06.2017; that in office order of suspension dated

10.11.2016, the petitioners were allowed to draw

Page |3

suspension grant equal to last pay received by them
under the rules, which attained finality; that the profile of
respondent-company reveals that the Federal
Government is the dominant / principal share holder and
overall incharge and controlling authority of PESCO,
Chief Executive of the Company is its nominee and had
been delegated with such powers by Board of Directors,
as such, the respondent-company can be regarded as
‘person’ performing functions in connection with the
affairs of the Federation within the contemplation of
Article 199 (5) of the Constitution and is amenable to the
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court; that the petitioners
assailed the suspension orders alongwith subsequent
explanation letter, charge sheets under Rule 6 of the
Disciplinary Rules, 1978 before this Court by filing WP
NO.1201-A of 2016, which was disposed of on
07.03.2017 thereby directing the respondents to deal the
petitioners in accordance with the letter and spirit of law/
rules; that the respondent No.2 constituted inquiry
committee and after proper inquiry, the petitioners were
reinstated and the show cause notices and charge
sheets were withdrawn; that thereafter the contract
period of the petitioners was further extended for a
period of one year and the intervening period was treated
as leave without pay; that afterwards, the petitioners
were regularized from their initial appointment in the light
of letter dated 22.04.2020 on the recommendations of

the PESCO Regularization Board; that the petitioners

Page |4

also filed departmental appeal for allowing suspension
grant to them, however, the said appeal was turned
down vide impugned letter dated 10.03.2019. Hence,
this petition.

3. When we confronted the learned counsel
from the petitioners as to whether the petitioners could
invoke the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court for
redressal of their grievances in the absence of violation
of law or any statutory rules, he replied that through
office order dated 11.01.2008 Rules and Orders in force
in WAPDA i.e. The Pakistan WAPDA Employees
(Efficiency and Disciplines) Rules, 1978 has been
adopted by PESCO which are statutory in nature and
went on to say that in such a situation writ jurisdiction
can be invoked to seek relief from this Court.

4. Arguments heard and record perused.

5. It is an admitted fact that PESCO is a limited
company incorporated under the Companies Ordinance,
1984, it has not framed any statutory rules governing
terms and conditions of the service of their employees.
No doubt, rules making powers and adoption were
bestowed upon the Board of Directors of the Company.
It is by now established that the regulations/rules
whether framed by itself or adopted by reference has no
statutory basis in law. In this context, reference may be
made to the cases reported as ‘Ch. Abdul Rashid V.
Capital Development Authority, Islamabad and

another (PLD 1979 Lahore 803) and ‘The Principal,

Page |5

Cadet College, Kohat and another V. Muhammad
Shoaib Qureshi? (PLD 1984 SC 170). The adoption of
the rules of the Government or their application by
reference will not lend a statutory cover or content to
these rules as held in the case reported as ‘Lahore
Central Co-operative Bank Limited V. Pir Saif Ullah
Shah (PLD 1959 SC (Pak.) 210) and unreported
judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan titled
‘Chairman Pakistan Council of Scientific and
Industrial Research, Islamabad and 3 others V. Dr.
Mrs. Khalida Raz? (Civil Appeal No.2070 of 1993).

6. It is well settled law that an employee of a
corporation of company in the absence of violation of law
or statutory rule could not press into service the
constitutional jurisdiction for seeking relief relating to the
terms and conditions of his service. His remedy lay
elsewhere. In this context, we are fortified by the dictum
laid down in the following judgments.

(1) Mrs. M. N. Arshad and others V. Miss Naeema
Khan and others (PLD 1990 SC 612)

(2) Messrs Malik & Haq and another V. Muhammad
Shams ul Islam Chowdhury and 2 others (PLD
1961 SC 531)

(3) | Zain-ul-Abideen V. Multan Central Co-operative
Bank Limited, Multan (PLD 1966 SC 445)

(4) Abdul Salam Mehta V. Chairman, Water &
Power Development Authority and another
(1970 SCMR 40)

(5) Lt. Col. Shuja-ud-Din Ahmad V. Oil & Gas
Development Corporation (1971 SCMR 566)

(6) The Principal Cadet College Kohat and another
V. Muhamamd Shoaib Qureshi (PLD 1984 SC
170)

by the petitioners.
