2. On 21.4.2018 at 14:00 hours, the
complainant namely Sagib Ahmad (PW-4) at the
Police Station Ashriat, District Chitral in the
company of his minor daughter namely Kulsoom
Hussain aged about 11/12 years (PW-5) reported the
matter that his daughter namely Kulscom Hussain is
the student of 5" Class and on the eventful day, she
was coming back from School, when reached the
spot, the appellant by putting dupatta in her mouth,
took her to nearby jungle and committed rape on
her. Other companions of the minor victim ran and
informed the complainant about the incident, who
immediately rushed to the spot where the appellant
while seeing the complainant fled away by leaving
his clothes. The occurrence was also witnessed by

Rehmat Azam and Mehnaz Begum (PW-6). .

3. The report of the complainant (PW-4) was
reduced into formal FIR (Ex.PW4/1). The victim

was medically examined by Lady Doctor Saeed

Rabbani (PW-16) and her opinion as per medico-

“legal report is .Ex.PW14/3. On 22.4.2018, the - ~~

appellant was arrested vide his card of Ex.PW8/3 by
Abdul Muzaffar SHO (PW-8). The case was
investigated by Mubarak Ahmad Inspector (PW-14).
On 23.4.2018, the appellant was also medically
examined by Dr. Samad Khan (PW-12) vide his
report Ex.PW12/2, During the course of
investigation, site plan Ex.PW14/S was drafted at the
instance of complainant/victim: Statements of the
witnesses were also recorded u/s 164 Cr.P.C. On
28.4.2018, the appellant recorded his judicial
confession before the learned Judicial Magistrate

- (PW-17).

4. After completion of investigation, challan
was put before the Special Court established under
the Juvenile Justice System Act against the appellant
being juvenile. He was formally charge-sheeted for
the offence, however, he did not plead guilty to the
charge and opted to face the trial. In support of its
allegation against the appellant, the prosecution
produced as many as seventeen witnesses and closed
.the evidence. After examination of the appellant u/s
342, Cr.P.C, the learned trial Court vide judgment

dated 21.09.2020 convicted and sentenced the -

Sabz Ali/* $8: HON’BLE MR, JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM
-4-
appellant in the manner already detailed in the

earlier part of this judgment, hence, this appeal.

5. | Arguments heard and record of the case was
perused with the valuable assistance of learned
counsel for the parties and learned A.A.G

representing the State.

6 It is the case of prosecution against the present
appellant that he took minor victim Mst. Kulsoom
Hussain to a nearby jungle while she was coming
back from school and raped her. The victim, who
was a minor girl of about 11/12 years of age,
appeared before the Court as PW-5 and narrated the
entire episode in a straightforward manner in her
examination-in-chief. She also remained consistent
during her cross examination despite putting intense
questions to her. Similarly, minor Mehnaz Begum
(PW-6) who was aged about 10/11 years and
accompanying the victim at the time when she was
forcibly taken by the appellant to the nearby jungle
was also examined as PW-6. Her testimony too
strengthens the prosecution case. The complainant
was also examined as PW-4, who narrated the same
story as in the F.I.R. Khairul Azam who at the

relevant time accompanied the complainant to the

Sabz atys| $8: HON’BLE MR, JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM

-5-

“spot and witnessed all the events like the ----

complainant on the spot was also examined as PW-
7, His statement is fully in line with the statement of
the complainant (PW-4) as well as the prosecution
version. All the above prosecution witnesses were ;
subjected to a lengthy cross examination but nothing
was extracted from their mouth in favour of the
appellant. Moreso, no clue of malafide or grudge for
false implication of the appellant in the instant case
could be noticed in the entire prosecution evidence.
In the peculiar circumstances, no question of

misidentification of the appellant would arise. There

_ iS no material contradiction in testimonies of all the

“above PWs, therefore, the presence of all the PWs

on the spot at.the relevant time can confidently be

termed as natural.

7. In addition to the above, the appellant/accused
has also confessed his guilt before the learned
Judicial Magistrate. The prosecution has also
produced and examined Mr. Hassan Ali Khan, the
learned Judicial Magistrate as PW-17 who has
recorded confessional statement of the accused/
appellant. The confessional statement of the accused

is Ex.PW-17/2. The learned Judicial Magistrate was

Sabz ay SB: HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM
‘subjected to taxing cross examination but there -
would be nothing in his statement to suggest that the
confessional statement recorded by the appellant
was either involuntary or same was the result of any
pressure or undue influence rather in light of the
‘evidence, the confession of the accused appears ‘to
be voluntary and therefore can certainly be used
against him as an important piece of evidence.
Needless to say that the appellant in his confessional
statement has confirmed all the events relating to
commission of offence as narrated by the above

PWs in their respective statements.

8 The testimonies of the above prime
prosecution witnesses particularly of the victim
(PW-5), are also fully corroborated by: medical
evidence brought by the prosecution through Lady
Dr. Saeed Rabbani (PW-16) and Dr. Samad Khan
(PW-12). PW-12 has medically examined the
appellant and according to his report Ex.PW12/2, he
with expertise reasons has opined that the appellant
was capable of committing sexual intercourse,
whereas the lady doctor (PW-16) has conducted
medical examination of the minor victim Mst.

Kulsoom Bibi. In her report Ex.PW14/3, the lady

Sabz aiy*| $8: ” HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM
-7-

doctor (PW-16), has opined that hymen of the victim
was intact, however, she has noted certain signs of
violence on different parts of her body, which
establishes the attempt of rape on-the victim as
alleged by the victim in her statement and confirmed
by the appellant in his judicial confession. Both the
above doctors were sufficiently cross-examined but
nothing could be brought on the record during their
cross-examination to doubt the genuineness of the
medico-legal reports they had prepared after
examining the victim and the appellant. In short, the
prosecution has brought sufficient trustworthy,
reliable and confidence inspiring evidence on the
record, which connects the appellant with the

commission of offence.

9. Keeping in view the evidence on record, the
learned trial Court. has committed no illegality by
recording conviction of the appellant u/s 376 read
with section 511 P.P.C. However, the quantum of
sentence awarded to the appellant by learned trial
Court under the said sections of law needs
extenuation keeping in view the fact that the
appellant was a juvenile offender and was chased for

rape upon the victim. Record is also mute regarding

Sabz ay] $B: HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM
-8-
his involvement in such like offence in the past.
Thus, all the above reasons would be considered for

mitigation of the sentence of the appellant.

10. As regards conviction of the appellant u/s 53
of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and
Welfare Act, 2010 as well as u/s 364 (A) PPC in the
circumstances of the case, legal questions cropped
up before this Court, hence, to answer these
questions, learned counsel for the parties and learned

A.A.G were heard in detail.

1l. First, this Court would take up the question
with regard to conviction of the appellant u/s section
53 of the Act. Section 53 of the Act caters

punishment for sexual abuse which reads:

§3. Sexual abuse. Whoever commits an offence
of sexual abuse shall be punished with
imprisonment for a term which may extend to
fourteen years and shall not be less than seven
years and shall also be liable to fine which shall
not be less than ten hundred thousand rupees.

The above referred penal provision prescribes
the punishment for the offence of sexual abuse
which has been defined in clause (y) of sub-section

(1) of Section 2 of the Act, which is as follows.

(y) “Sexual abuse” means employing, using,
forcing, persuading, inducing, enticing, or
coercing any child to engage in, or assisting
any other person to engage in fondling,
stroking, caressing, exhibitionism, voyeurism

Sabz ap} $8: HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM
-9-

or any obscene or sexually explicit conduct or
stimulation of such conduct _ either
independently or in conjunction with other
acts, with or without his consent.

The offence of rape is punishable ws 376 of
the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860. For ready reference,

section 376 PPC is reproduced as under;

376. Punishment for rape. Whoever commits
rape shall be punished with death or
imprisonment of either description for a term
which shall not be less than ten years or more
than twenty-five years and shall also be liable to
fine.

(1A) Whoever commits an offence punishable
under sub-section (1) of sub-section (2) of this
section 377 or 377-B and in the course of such
commission causes any hurt punishable an
offence under section 333, section 335, clauses
(iv), (v) and (vi) of subsection (3) of section
337, section 337, section 337C clauses (v) and
(vi) of section 337-F, shall be punished with
death or imprisonment for life and fine.

(2) When rape is committed by two or more
persons in furtherance of common intention of
all, each of such persons shall be punished with
death or imprisonment for life.

(3) Whoever being a public servant including a
police officer, medical officer or jailor, taking
advantage of his official position, commits rape
shall be punished with death or imprisonment
for life and fine.

Rape is an offence under the Pakistan Penal
Code, a Federal statute whereas the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection Act, 2010 is a
Provincial law, which was promulgated in the

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with the aim and object to

provide for the care, protection, maintenance,

Sabz aiy| SB: HON’BLE MR, JUSTICE ISHTLAQ IBRAHIM
-10-
welfare, training, education, rehabilitation and

reintegration of children at risk in the Province.

Actually, rape and sexual abuse are two
distinct offences because of. their different
constituent ingredients. The offence of sexual abuse,
which is punishable u/s 53 of the Act, was also
introduced in the Pakistan Penal Code u/s 377A
through Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Act,

2016, which is replicated below for ready reference.

377A. Sexual abuse.—Whoever employs,
uses, forces, persuades, induces, entices, or
coerces any person to engage in, or assist any
other person to engage in fondling, stroking,
caressing, exhibitionism, voyeurism or any
obscene or sexually explicit conduct or
stimulation of such conduct _ either.
independently or in conjunction with other
acts, with or without consent where age of
person is less than eighteen years, is said to
commit the offence of sexual abuse.

The offence of sexual abuse has been defined
almost in the same words u/s 377A, PPC as well as
in clause (y) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the
Act with slight variation of the word ‘child’ used in
the definition in the Act whereas the word ‘person’
occurs instead of the word ‘child’ in $.377A PPC
which has been clarified by adding the words ‘where
age of person is less than eighteen years’. Thus,
sexual abuse is an offence under the Federal as well

as Provincial statutes, however, the punishments

Sabz any | SB: HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM
-ll-
provided under both the laws for the said offence are
different. Section 377B provides the punishment for
the said offence upto seven years imprisonment with
fine of not less than five hundred thousand whereas
u/s 53 of the Act, the said offence is punishable upto
fourteen years but shal] not be less than seven years
with fine which shall also be not less than ten
hundred thousand. Thus, there is conflict between
the federal and provincial laws with regard to the
quantum of sentence for commission of the same
offence i.e. sexual abuse and as such the matter
attracts the principle of ‘Occupied Field’. The
doctrine of ‘Occupied Field’ or ‘Doctrine of
Eclipse’ as visualized in Article 143 of the
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,

1973, which reads as under:

143. Inconsistency between Federal and
Provincial laws. If any provision of an Act of
a Provincial Assembly is repugnant to any
provision of an Act of Majlis-e-Shoora
(Parliament) which Majlis-e-Shoora
(Parliament) is competent to enact, then the
Act of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament), whether
passed before or after the Act of Provincial
Assembly, shall prevail and the Act of the
Provincial Assembly shall, to the extent of the

repugnancy, be void.
Bare reading of the afore-referred Article
shows that Federal law shall prevail over the

Provincial law on the same subject matter when the

Sabz aul SB: *  HON‘BLE MR, JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM
-12-

Provincial Jaw is repugnant to Federal statute
notwithstanding the fact that the Federal law was
enacted before or after the Provincial law. The
doctrine of ‘Occupied Field’, as observed by
Karachi High Court in the case of Messrs Quetta
Textile Mills Limited through Chief Executive Vs.
Province Of Sindh through Secretary Excise and

Taxation, Karachi_and another (P L D 2005

Karachi 55), may be defined as under:

“If a competent legislature expressly or
impliedly evinces its intention to cover the
whole field, that is conclusive test of
inconsistency where another legislature
assumes to enter to any extent upon the same
field”.

In this regard, I would refer the judgment of
Supreme Court of India in the case of Zaverbhai

Amaidas Vs. The State of Bombay (AIR 1954 S.C.

752), wherein it was held that:

"if a later statute again describes an offence
created by a previous one, and imposes a
different punishment, or varies the procedure,
the earlier statute is repealed by the later
statute”.

With reference to the case of Michell
yv.Brown it was further observed in the same

judgment that:

"It is true, as already pointed out, that on a
question under article 254(1) whether arAct
of Parliament prevails against a law of the

Sabz atys| SB: HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM
-13-

State, no question of repeal arises; but the
principle on which the rule of implied repeal
rests, namely, that if the subject-matter of the
later legislation is identical with that of the
earlier, so that they cannot both stand together,
then the earlier is repealed by the later
enactment, will be equally applicable to a
question under article 254(2) whether the
further legislation by Parliament is in respect
of the same matter as that of the State law”.

There is conflict between the Federal and
Provincial Laws on the same subject-matter i.e the
offence of sexual abuse with regard to the quantum
of sentence and in such situation the settled principle
is that the Provincial statute shall give way to the
Federal law. Wisdom is also sought from the

judgment of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in

the case of Pakistan Telecommunication Company

Lts. Vs. Member NIRC and others (2014 SCMR

$35) wherein it was observed that:

13. Even otherwise under the provision of
Article 143 of the Constitution of Pakistan,
1973, laws enacted by the Parliament have
been given. overriding and superimposing
effects over the laws enacted by a Provincial
Assembly of any of the Provinces and in case
of any clash or repugnancy between the two,
the laws enacted by the Parliament shail
prevail. Thus, on the touchstone of the
provision of Article 143 of the Constitution,
the Act of Parliament has been placed on the
high pedestal and any Provincial Law enacted
by the Provincial Assembly shall give way to
the Federal Law, enacted by the Parliament, if
the former is inconsistent or repugnant to the
latter.

Upshot of the above discussion is that since

alternate of section 53 of the Act is available in

Sabz aiye| $8: HON’BLE MR, JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM
-14-
shape of séction 377A PPC which has overriding
effect being a Federal statue and the Act ibid is in
conflict therewith qua the quantum of sentence,
therefore, the appellant cannot be prosecuted u/s 53
of the Act when there is section 377A PPC in the
field having the prevailing effect under the doctrine
of ‘Occupied Field’ or ‘Doctrine of Eclipse’ as
well as on the. ground of lack of evidence qua the
charge of appellant for sexual abuse. Thus,
conviction and sentence of the appellant under
Section 53 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child
Protection and Welfare Act, 2010 needs conversion

to section 377-B PPC.

So far as the quantum of sentence of the
appellant u/s 377-B PPC is concerned, it is pertinent
to mention here at the relevant time section 377-B
PPC was entailing punishment of ‘either description
for a terms which may extend to seven years and
liable to fine which shall not be less than five
hundred thousand rupees or with both’. Though on
24" May, 2018 through Criminal Laws
(Amendment) Act, 2018, punishment of section
377B PPC was substituted that ‘imprisonment of
either description for a terms which shall not be less

than fourteen years and may extend upto twenty

Sabz aty-| SB: HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM
-15-
years and with fine which shall not be less than one
million rupees.’, however, the instant occurrence has
taken place on 21.4.2018 before the ibid amendment
in the Pakistan Penal Code and it is settled law that
the penal provision touching a right in exercise at the
time of passing legislation would not operate
retrospectively, therefore, in the circumstances, the
law which was prevailing at the relevant time shall
be applied. In this regard, reliance is placed.on the
case of ‘Adnan Afzal Vs: Capt. Sher Afzal’ (PLD
1969 Supreme Court 187), wherein the apex Court

has held that;

“Interpretation of statues-Retrospectively of
legislation-----Matter retrospective if it is
merely procedural in nature.---Such matter,
however, would not operate retrospectively if
it touches a right in existence at time of
passing of legislation- Matter of procedure,
what are.”

It would not be out of place to clarify here
that in the case of ‘Usama Vs. The State and
another’ (Cr.A 162-M/2020) decided by this Court
on 25,.].2021], wherein the date of occurrence was
13.4.2019 ie. after the above amendment in PPC,
however, at that time neither the aforesaid
amendment in the P.P.C was brought into the notice
of the Court nor the Court was properly assisted on

the legal point.

Sabz auy| SB: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM.
-16-
12. Adverting to 2" question with regard to
conviction of the appellant for the offence u/s 364-A
P.P.C. To resolve this question, it is to be seen that
whether the facts & circumstances of ‘the present
case also constitute offence u/s section 364A P.P.C
or otherwise?. The prosecution allegation regarding
abduction of the minor victim against the appellant is
that the minor victim while coming back from
School was abducted by the appellant to a nearby
jungle, where he raped her. According to the site
plan Ex.PW14/5, the point/place wherefrom the
victim was taken/dragged by the appellant to the spot
(jungle) is about 104 feet for the purpose of
satisfaction of his lust and there is nothing in the
evidence that the appellant was having any other
intention, thus, the peculiar circumstances of the
case would not constitute offence of abduction of the
victim and as such the matter would not attract
section 364A PPC. In this regard, reliance is placed
on an authoritative judgment of the august Supreme
Court of Pakistan (Shariat Bench) rendered in the
* case of ‘Shams Saeed Ahmad Khan Vs. Shafaullah
and_another’ (1985 SCMR 1822), wherein it has

been observed that;

Saber Ali* SB: HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM
-17-

“Existence of intention or reasonable
knowledge of accused. Accused charged
with offence under 8.377 PPC and
kidnapping. Abduction neither intended nor
object of crime but to commit sodomy
alone. Merely because victim was moved a -
few paces in terrorem or shoved along to a
suitable place, not to make additional
offence under 8.12 of Ordinance, (VII of
1979). -

Similar view was taken by the august —
Supreme Court of Pakistan in another case of

‘Muhammad Akhtar Vs. Muhammad Shafique and

another’ (1986 SCMR 533), by holding that;

“Kidnapping for unnatural tust—Removal
of child only a few paces with object and
purpose to commit sodomy and not at all to
remove or take away child from lawful
guardianship, will not make an additional
offence under §.12 of Ordinance. Acquittal
on charge under S.12 upheld by Supreme
Court.

In the present case, the appellant was
also a minor of about 17 years at the relevant time
and except the intention of commission of rape with
victim, there would be hardly noticed anything in the
prosecution evidence which could suggest that he
was also having the intention to take away the victim
from her lawful guardianship with mens rea of her
abduction. Thus, the conviction and sentence of the
appellant u/s 364A PPC by the appellant through the
impugned judgment is not’ sustainable in the

circumstances.

13. In view of the above, this appeal is
partially allowed, the impugned judgment of the
learned trial Court is modified by maintaining
conviction of the appellant u/s 376/511 P.P.C but his
sentence is reduced from ten (10) years RJ to five
(05) years §.I keeping in view his tender age i.e. 17
years at the time of occurrence whereas his sentence
u/s 53 of the Act is converted into section 377B PPC
and same is also reduced from seven years R.I to
five (05) years S.I. The amount of compensation
under section 376 PPC is reduced from Rs.50,000/-
to Rs.25,000/- or in default he shall undergo one
month §.I. Similarly, the amount of fine u/s 377B
PPC is also reduced from Rs.1,000,000/- to
Rs.500,000/- or in default he shall undergo further
03 months S.J. All the sentences shall run
concurrently with -benefit of 382-B, Cr.P.C.
However, the appellant is acquitted of the charge u/s

364A PPC.
