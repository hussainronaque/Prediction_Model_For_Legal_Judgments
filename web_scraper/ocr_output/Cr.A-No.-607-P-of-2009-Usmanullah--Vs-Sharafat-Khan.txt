HAIDER ALI KHAN, J- Through this single

judgment we intend to dispose of the instant

criminal appeal as well as the connected appeals

bearing Cr.A No. 608-P/2009, Cr.A No. 09-P/2010

and Cr.A No. 67-P/2010 because all the matters

arise from the judgments dated 22.10.2009 of the

learned Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi,

Chitral, delivered in case F.I.R No. 57 dated

17.09.2008 under sections 302/34 PPC registered at

Police Station Torkoh, District Chitral.

Tajamui/Ps* Crominal Appeal No: 607-P of 2009 titled “Usmanullaly ..Vs.. SharafatKhawé others”
2. Precise and relevant facts of the case

as per contents of the FIR lodged at the instance of

the complainant Usman Ullah are that on 28.07.2008

at 05:00 hours the complainant present in his house

was informed by his cousin Niaz-ur-Rahman that

their cousin Sharaf Zarin has committed suicide in

his house by firing through a gun. On this

information, the complainant went to the house of

his brother-in-law Muhammad Amin and informed

him of the occurrence where it was transpired that

Sharafat Khan etc had spent the night of occurrence

in the house of deceased. As there was a land

dispute between the deceased and Sharafat Khan,

therefore, the complainant showed the apprehension

that the deceased might have been killed by Sharafat

Khan etc, however, he did not charge any one

directly in his report. Inquiry was initiated on the

report of complainant, wherein statements of

Mst. Abida Bibi widow, Mst. Chastana Bibi sister of

Tajamud/Ps* Cruminal appeal No. 607-P of 2009 titled “Usmanullaly ..Vy. SharafatKhawé others”
deceased, Sharafat Khan, Niaz-ur-Rahman and

Igrar-u-Din were recorded under section 164, Cr.PC

who narrated the story of suicide committed by the

deceased.

On 05.08.2008, Mst. Ikhlas Bibi etc

sisters of the deceased submitted an application

(Ex:PW-8/6) for inquiry by stating that the case was

that of murder and that their brother had not

committed suicide. In light of the inquiry, on

12.09.2008 the above mentioned F.I.R (Ex:PW-8/7)

was registered against the accused/ respondents for

the murder of the deceased and they were arrested in

the case. Some of the accused/ respondents namely

Ijaz Ahmad, Niaz-ur-Rahman and Mst. Abida Bibi

recorded their confessional statements (Ex:PW-22/7

to PW22/15) before the learned Judicial Magistrate,

Buni, District Chitral.

3. On completion of the investigation, the

case was put in Court which was entrusted to the

Tajamud/Ps* Cruminal appeal No. 607-P of 2009 titled “Usmanullaly ..Vy. SharafatKhawé others”
Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi

Zila Qazi, Chitral, for disposal. It is noteworthy that

the respondent/accused namely Niaz-ur-Rehman

was a juvenile, therefore, separate challan under the

Juvenile Justice System Ordinance was submitted in

Court for his trial. Formal charge was framed

against the accused/respondents by the trial Court to

which they pleaded not guilty and opted to face the

trials. The prosecution produced and examined as

many as twenty five witnesses in support of its case,

whereafter statements of the accused/respondents

under section 342, Cr.P.C were recorded wherein

they professed innocence and denied the allegations

levelled by the prosecution, however, they felt no

need to produce any evidence in their defence and

similarly they did not opt to be examined on oath

according to section 340 (2), Cr.P.C. On conclusion

of the trial, the accused/respondents were acquitted

from the charges leveled against them by the learned

Tajamud/Ps* Cruminal appeal No. 607-P of 2009 titled “Usmanullaly ..Vy. SharafatKhawé others”
trail Court vide impugned judgments dated

22.10.2009. Being aggrieved, the  appellant/

complainant Usmanullah preferred the instant appeal

as well as the connected appeal bearing Cr.A

No. 608-P/2009 whereas the State filed the

connected appeals bearing Cr.A No. 09-P/2010 and

No.67-P/2010 which are being disposed of through

this single judgment.

4, Learned counsel for the

appellant/complainant contended that the

prosecution has produced convincing evidence in

support of its case but the trial Court has failed to

appreciated the same in its true perspective. He

further contended that from the material available on

the record it is clear that the occurrence was that of

homicide and not a suicide. It was also argued that

exhumation of the dead body has been conducted by

Medical Board headed by Dr. Zahid Hussain Khalil

(PW-24) and his report in this regard fully supports

Tajamud/Ps* Cruminal appeal No. 607-P of 2009 titled “Usmanullaly ..Vy. SharafatKhawé others”
the prosecution version besides, the

respondents/accused Ijaz Ahmad, Mst. Abida Bibi

and the juvenile accused Niaz-ur-Rehman have

recorded their confessional statements before the

competent Court but the learned trial Court did not

consider the same and recorded acquittal of the

respondents/accused which is not legally

sustainable.

5. On the contrary, learned counsel for the

respondents/accused contended that the prosecution

has deviated from its former standpoint of suicide

and later on charged the respondent/accused for the

murder of Sharaf Zarin. He also referred to 164,

Cr.P.C statements of Mst. Chastana Bibi and

contended that the witness has adopted two different

versions in her statements. It was further argued that

the alleged confessional statements of the

respondents/accused were not recorded in

accordance with law besides the same are retracted

Tajamud/Ps* Cruminal appeal No. 607-P of 2009 titled “Usmanullaly ..Vy. SharafatKhawé others”
confessions, therefore, the respondents/accused

cannot be legally convicted on the basis thereof. The

learned counsel concluded that the prosecution

evidence is suffering from glaring contradictions,

hence, the same is not worth reliance, hence, the

impugned judgment needs no interference by this

Court.

6. The learned A.A.G. appearing on behalf

of the State adopted the arguments of learned

counsel for the appellant and prayed for setting aside

the impugned judgment and conviction of the

respondents/accused in accordance with law.

7. We have heard learned counsel for the

parties and have gone through the record in light of

their valuable assistance.

8. Perusal of the record would reveal that

initially the occurrence was reported by the

complainant as suicide and in this regard 164,

Cr.P.C statements of the respondents/accused as

Tajamud/Ps* Cruminal appeal No. 607-P of 2009 titled “Usmanullaly ..Vy. SharafatKhawé others”
well as of Mst. Chustana Bibi, sister of the deceased,

were recorded wherein they stated that the deceased

Sharaf Zarin had committed suicide. However, later

on sisters of the deceased moved an application to

the high ups of the Police Department on which

inquiry under 174, Cr.P.C was conducted by the

DSP concerned and the case was registered against

the respondents/accused. Record shows _ that

exhumation of the dead body was also conducted on

07.11.2008 by the Medical Board constituted in this

regard. Although, the report of concerned doctors in

this regard shows that death of the deceased was

caused due to firearm injury and no signs of

asphyxiation have been shown in the report besides

the post-mortem report also reveals that the nature of

death was most probably suicide. But there are some

other pieces of evidence on the record which

exclude the possibility of suicide in the given

circumstances. In this regard, there is recovery of

Tajamud/Ps* Cruminal appeal No. 607-P of 2009 titled “Usmanullaly ..Vy. SharafatKhawé others”
two empty shells one from the spot of occurrence

and the second from inside the shotgun in loaded

positition. In the ordinary course of nature the

person who commits suicide can fire only one shot

and gets no further chance for the second fire. Some

of the prosecution witnesses and even the accused

are unanimous in their statements that they have

heard thuds of two gun shots on the night of

occurrence. There is also report of DSP Operation,

Chitral who conducted inquiry in the case under

section 174, Cr.P.C. According to this report, the

Inquiry Officer recorded statements of Khosh Khan

and Mir Baiz Khan who gave post-death bath to the

deceased and according to their statements there

were two wounds on the body of the deceased i.e

one on his stomach and the other beneath the armpit.

Admittedly, the deceased received injuries as a

result of firing with an SBBL shotgun and two

empty shells have been recovered from the spot,

Tajamud/Ps* Cruminal appeal No. 607-P of 2009 titled “Usmanullaly ..Vy. SharafatKhawé others”
-10-

these facts and circumstances show that the

occurrence was not of a suicide at least because it is

most improbable that a person who received one

shot and could load the gun again in injured

condition for the second fire. Thus, it is held that the

deceased had not committed suicide rather he was

done to death by someone else.

9. The second piece of most important

evidence is that of the confessional statements

recorded by respondents/accused Ijaz Ahmad,

Mst. Abida Bibi and Niaz-ur-Rehman. The learned

trial Court has held that the respondents/accused

have not recorded their confessional statements

voluntarily rather the same were the result of duress

and violence as the respondents/accused remained in

police custody for sufficient time. Record shows that

pre and post police custody examinations of the

respondents/ accused have been conducted by the

Medical Officer concerned and as per his reports no

Tajamud/Ps* Cruminal appeal No. 607-P of 2009 titled “Usmanullaly ..Vy. SharafatKhawé others”
-ll-

signs of violence or torture were found on their

bodies. Moreover, the Judicial Magistrate concerned

has recorded the statements of the respondents/

accused according to the procedure laid down in the

Code of Criminal Procedure and no procedural

irregularities could be found therein, therefore, this

Court is not in agreement with the above mentioned

findings of the learned trial Court that the

respondents/accused gave confessions as a result of

police torture. Learned counsel for _ the

respondents/accused also contended that the

respondents/accused have retracted from their

confessions, hence, they cannot be legally convicted

on the basis of the confessions which have already

been retracted by the respondents/accused. It is true

that the respondents/accused have retracted from

their confessions, however, conviction on the basis

of even retracted confession can be awarded to an

accused if the Court is satisfied that the confessional

Tajamud/Ps* Cruminal appeal No. 607-P of 2009 titled “Usmanullaly ..Vy. SharafatKhawé others”
-12-

statements were true and were made voluntarily.

Guidance in this regard is sought from the judgment

reported as “Manjeet Singh Versus. The State”

(PLD 2006 Supreme Court 30), wherein the august

Supreme Court observed that:-

“This is settled law that a retracted
confession either judicial or extra-
judicial, if is found truthful and
confidence inspiring and also qualifies
the test of voluntariness, can be used
for conviction without looking for any
other sort of corroboration. The
petitioner, an Indian citizen and being
an illegal immigrant while was working
as an agent of RAW (an Indian
Intelligence Agency) in Pakistan was
arrested as suspect and during the
interrogation, disclosed that he was
deputed to commit terrorist activities in
Pakistan and was involved in the bomb
blast cases referred hereinbefore. The
petitioner having disclosed his mission
in Pakistan, showed his willingness to
make a_ confessional statement,
therefore, he was produced before a
Magistrate, who after satisfying himself
about the willingness and voluntariness
of the petitioner to make the

confessional statement, recorded his

Tajamud/Ps* Cruminal appeal No. 607-P of 2009 titled “Usmanullaly ..Vy. SharafatKhawé others”
-13-

statement wherein he disclosed the
manner in which he caused the

explosion at Lahore and Faisalabad.”

As observed’ earlier that the

confessional statements have been recorded in

accordance with law and the relevant procedure and

there is nothing on the record to show that the same

statements were not recorded voluntarily, therefore,

the retracted confessions cannot be discarded at all

mere on the ground of being inconsistent inter se.

However, it is observed in light of the confessional

statements that the main role played in the

occurrence is that of respondent/accused Sharafat

Khan because all the co-accused are unanimous in

their statements that accused Sharafat Khan first

subjected the deceased to asphyxiation and later on

when the deceased was breathing his last, he fired at

him with the shotgun. Moreover, the motive behind

the occurrence as depicted by the prosecution also

strengthens the belief that the main role in

Tajamud/Ps* Cruminal appeal No. 607-P of 2009 titled “Usmanullaly ..Vy. SharafatKhawé others”
-14-

committing the murder of the deceased had been

played by accused Sharafat Khan. It is also noticed

that the accused Sharafat Khan had a dominant

position over the other co-accused especially on the

night of occurrence. Furthermore, the motive behind

the occurrence i.e the land dispute between the

deceased and accused Sharafat Khan also affirms the

apprehension of the complainant he disclosed in his

initial report regarding the murder of the deceased

by accused Sharafat Khan. The statements of some

of the prosecution witnesses also indicate to the fact

that the deceased himself had disclosed before them

his apprehension of life threat from accused Sharafat

Khan and wife Mst. Abida Bibi. The relevant

statements of the prosecution witnesses in this

regard are worth consideration and there is no reason

for disbelieving the same.

10. The learned trial Court in its judgment

impugned herein has also referred to the statement

Tajamud/Ps* Cruminal appeal No. 607-P of 2009 titled “Usmanullaly ..Vy. SharafatKhawé others”
-15-

of minor witness namely Hafeez-ur-Rehman

(PW-11) who is the sole eye-witness to the

occurrence, however, his statement was not given

credence by the trial for the reason that the same is

inconsistent with the statements of other prosecution

witnesses. No doubt, there is no eye witness to the

occurrence except the child witness Hafeez-ur-

Rehman and the prosecution has produced him as

the sole eye witness to the occurrence whose

presence on the spot has been established as well. It

is noticed that the child alone had sympathy and

natural love with his father i.e the deceased whereas

his mother Mst. Abida had also joined hands with

the accused, therefore, in such like situation the

statement of the natural and sole eye witness should

have been considered by the trial Court. It is also a

fact that PW-11 was nine years of age at the time of

recording his statement and being a child witness his

statement should not be compared with the

Tajamud/Ps* Cruminal appeal No. 607-P of 2009 titled “Usmanullaly ..Vy. SharafatKhawé others”
-16-

statements of other major witnesses as much

accuracy and complete consistency of his statement

with that of the remaining witnesses cannot be

expected keeping in view his minor age and other

circumstances of the case. However, the statement

of PW-11 (the child witness) is consistent with the

confessional statements of the respondents/accused

regarding the facts that his father had been subjected

to asphyxiation at the night of occurrence and that

he was removed from the scene by the juvenile

accused Niaz-ur-Rehman.

So far statement of Mst. Chustana is

concerned, it is true that she had recorded her

statement under section 164, Cr.P.C twice wherein

she told two different stories and her statement does

not match with that of the minor witness, however, it

is observed that the accused had tried to bury the

matter by showing the occurrence as of suicide and

later on it became known that the occurrence was

Tajamud/Ps* Cruminal appeal No. 607-P of 2009 titled “Usmanullaly ..Vy. SharafatKhawé others”
-17-

that of homicide when inquiry was conducted in the

case after recording the initial report. Moreso,

Mst. Chustana (PW-17) has averred in her

examination-in-chief that she was deaf and this fact

has been reconfirmed by the defence counsel at the

very beginning of the cross-examination besides, the

same fact has not been rebutted later on during her

cross-examination. The defence counsel has tried to

bring on the record that she answered the questions

asked by him in low tone from the witness (PW-15)

but the Court has no such source to ascertain the

above stance of the defence counsel. Hence, the

stance of the PW-15 that she did not hear the noise

or the sound of the firing on the night of occurrence

and came to know about the death of her brother at

morning, is not against the ordinary course of nature

especially in the case of her established deafness.

11. So far question of asphyxiation is

concerned, record shows that exhumation of the

dead body was conducted after more than three

Tajamud/Ps* Cruminal appeal No. 607-P of 2009 titled “Usmanullaly ..Vy. SharafatKhawé others”
-18-

months of the occurrence and presence of signs of

strangulation on the neck of the deceased cannot be

expected after such long period especially in the

situation that the dead body had nearly decayed as

per exhumation report Ex.PW-24/5. Although, PW-8

(SHO concerned) who conducted the _ initial

investigation in the case, has stated in his cross-

examination that he had carefully examined the neck

of the deceased but could not found any signs of

strangulation or violence thereon, however, his

opinion cannot be relied upon being not an expert in

this regard and the concerned doctor (PW-1) who

conducted the post-mortem, has not been asked any

question in this regard. However, the witnesses are

unanimous on this point that prior to firing the

deceased was overpowered and asphyxiated.

12. To sum up, this Court is of the

considered view that the prosecution has proved its

case against the accused Sharafat Khan and the

learned trial Court has not properly appreciated the

Tajamud/Ps* Cruminal appeal No. 607-P of 2009 titled “Usmanullaly ..Vy. SharafatKhawé others”
-19-

evidence to his extent, hence, the same is not
sustainable. Moreover, the role of the co-accused in
committing the murder of the deceased cannot be
established with certainity. It is also evident that one
of the co-accused was a juvenile at the time of the
occurrence and one is female and from their
confessional statements it is clear that the main role
was played by accused/respondent Sharafat Khan in
furtherance of a motive, therefore, in our view the
accused/respondents except Sharafat Khan are
entitled to be acquitted from the charge.

13. In view of what has been discussed
above, we partially allow this appeal, set aside the
impugned judgment dated 22.10.2009 of the learned
Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zila Qazi, Chitral,
to the extent of acquittal of the accused/respondent
Sharafat Khan and resultantly, convict him under
section 302(b) PPC and sentence to imprisonment
for life with fine of Rs.5,00,000/- (rupees five

hundred thousand) as compensation payable to the

Tajamud/Ps* Cruminal appeal No. 607-P of 2009 titled “Usmanullaly ..Vy. SharafatKhawé others”
-20-

legal heirs of the deceased or in default thereof the

same shall be recovered as arrears of land revenue.

However, benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C is

extended to convict/respondent, whereas, this appeal

to the extent of rest of the respondents/accused is

dismissed and the impugned judgment to their extent

is maintained. The respondent-convict Sharafat

Khan present in Court is directed to be taken into

custody and be dealt with in accordance with law.

The connected appeal bearing Cr.A No. 608-P/2009,

being devoid of merits, is dismissed. Similarly, the

appeals bearing Cr.A No. 09-P/2010 and Cr.A

No. 67-P/2010 preferred by the State are also

dismissed for having become infructuous.

Above are the reasons for our short

order of the even date announced in the open Court.

Announced.
Dt: 12.11.2015.

JUDGE

Tajamud/Ps* Cruminal appeal No. 607-P of 2009 titled “Usmanullaly ..Vy. SharafatKhawé others”
