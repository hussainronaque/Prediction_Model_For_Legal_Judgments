SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.--- This criminal appeal
No. 280-B of 2017, is filed by convict/ appellant Mst. Shazia
Bibi alias Sharjika Bibi against the judgment of conviction
dated 14.12.2017 rendered by learned Additional Sessions
Judge-II, Bannu, where as Cr. R No. 70-B of 2017, filed by
the complainant Ijaz Khan for enhancement of sentence of

the accused/ appellant in case F.ILR No. 169 dated

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah,
02.06.2014 under sections 302/201/120-B/34 P.P.C, Police

Station Domel, District, Bannu.

2. Since, the appeal and criminal revision are the
outcome of one and the same occurrence/ F.I.R, therefore,

these are being disposed of by way of this single judgment.

3. It was on 05.03.2014, when complainant Ijaz
Khan reported the matter to the local police, which was
initially entered through Nagalmad No.11, to the effect that
on the tragic night, he, his brother Umer Khitab alongwith
other family members were sleeping in their respective
rooms, at about 03.00 a.m he heard the voice of fire shot
from the room of Umer Khitab, upon which he and other
family members rushed towards and saw Umer Khitab was
lying in a pool of blood with having a .30 bore pistol in his
right hand and his wife, Mst. Shazia Bibi alias Sharjika Bibi
was weepin and crying. Umer Khitab succumbed to the
injuries at the spot. No one was charged for the offence,
however, the complainant produced “Ladawa Nama” and

Panchaiyat Nama to the police. Thereafter on 02.06.2014,

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr, Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
the complainant submitted an application before the SHO of
the Police Station concerned, alleging there in that wife of
deceased Mst. Sharjika Bibi told him and his other brothers
that she had committed the murder of her husband/ deceased
Umer Khitab in collusion with her paramour Hamidullah.
Both the accused were booked for the offence and F.ILR
Ex:PW7/1 was registered. On completion of investigation
complete challan was submitted against the accused/
’ appellant, while under section 512 Cr.P.C against the accused
Hamidullah. On commencement of trial, after providing
relevant copies in compliance with provision under section
265-C Cr.P.C, formal charge was framed against her, to
which she pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The
prosecution in order to prove guilt of accused/appellant
produced and examined as many as eleven (11) PWs. On
conclusion of trial, statement of accused/ appellant was
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein she professed
innocence and false implication. She neither wished to

produce defence evidence nor opted to be examined on oath

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramuilah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
as provided under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. Learned trial Court
after hearing arguments of learned counsel for the parties
vide impugned judgment dated 14.12.2017, convicted and
sentenced the accused/ appellant. The convict/ appellant
being aggrieved from the judgment of conviction of learned
trial Court moved instant criminal appeal No. 280-B/2017,
while the complainant moved Cr.R No. 70-B/2017 for

enhancement of sentence of the appellant.

4. We have heard arguments of learned counsel for
the parties and have carefully gone through the evidence on

record.

5. It was the tragic night falling between 4/5-03-
2014 when the deceased lost his life due to firearm injuries.
The complainant soon in the morning at 07.00 a.m reported
the matter to the local police of Police Station Domel, Bannu,
which was initially taken down vide station diary No.11
dated 05.03.2014. The heart breaking story was narrated by
PW 10, Ijaz, the complainant of the case and brother of the

deceased, that he while fast in sleep in his room heard a fire

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadutlah,
shot from the room of the deceased, he with rest of his family
members ran towards, saw the accused weeping and the
deceased then injured lying on bed waiting his fate with a .30
bore pistol in his hand, it was within few minutes that his
soul left his body, the appellant stated that the deceased

committed suicide.

6. Initially the complainant’s report was taken as
information in respect of suicide and no one was suspected
and also to solace all interested a “Jadawa nama” was written
duly signed by brothers and elders of the village with all
assurance of suicide and the matter was hushed up and so
silence prevailed, appellant was still living in the house as a
widow with all respect, and privileges, but the silence was
broken when on 20" of the May, 2014,Syed Imtiaz-ud-Din
Mansoor District Public Prosecutor, Bannu wrote to District
Police Officer, Bannu to reinvestigate the already buried
matter and to fix the responsibilities, the letter finds itself as
Ex:PW 11/7 on file. The concluding Para of the letter was a

warning to all connected with the investigation and to the

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sakibzada Asadullah,
inmates of the house of the deceased. This disturbed all
concerned so much that non care for non and all out efforts

were made to shift the responsibility from one to the other.

7. This was on 02.06.2014 that the complainant
wrote an application to the SHO concerned for registration of
case against the appellant, the proceedings were so
mechanical that on the same day application was submitted,
arrest was made, pointation and spot verification was carried
out, 161 Cr.P.C statement of the appellant was recorded and
even at 11.45 a.m the appellant was dragged to the Court of

Judicial Magistrate where her confession was recorded.

8. The learned Trial Court while awarding
sentence was highly influenced to hold that the confession so
recorded was voluntary and true, but the Court failed to
appreciate and search that how within the shortest span of
three hours all become possible especially, when the accused
charged was a female. Few questions are haunting and

despite efforts the prosecution failed to answer.

record transpires that after the initial

investigation the matter was laid to rest, as on one side the

local elders and brothers of the deceased put their satisfaction

in writing and on the other Abdul Rashid ASI who was

examined as PW-05 and who submitted final report in the

first round, declared the case as one of suicide and the reason

given was the partition of landed property among the

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asaduliah.
brothers and the mounted tension therefrom. But the law
enforcing agency i.e. the police department still in hot pursuit
and to our mind it was the directions from the District Public
Prosecutor Ex: PW 11/7, with its warning note that infused
worries in the officials who were connected with the previous
investigation and who in turn pressurized the family of the
deceased with negative consequences if, they failed to charge.
The mounted pressure left the family with no choice but to
charge the accused/ appellant in order to save themselves
from the wrath of the law enforcing agency, rather both the
sides chose to survive at the cost of the appellant. The
prosecution wanted us to believe that the appellant was
arrested after the F.I.R was chalked out but a prudent mind
will not accept because, an investigating officer who
otherwise takes hours to inspect the spot and thereafter to
prepare the site plan, how he made it possible within the
shortest span of time i.e. they travelled a distance of 40
kilometers in total, investigated the lady, recorded her

statement and took her before the Judicial Magistrate for

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
recording her confession. In order to reduce our curiosity, we
took the pains to read the zimnis dated 02.06.2014, where we
were shocked to see that her 161 Cr.P.C was recorded prior
to registration of F.I.R i.e. early in the morning, we further
searched out that the spot pointation and confirmation was
made in the late afternoon which too was recorded in the
relevant Zimnis whereas, according to the statement of
judicial Magistrate, she after recording her confession was
sent to the judicial lockup. The witnesses spoke but with
mala fide, that too at the cost of the honour of a young widow,

who lost her husband and honour.

10. We find it necessary to mention that the
deceased had five brothers in all, why only Ijaz chose to
register the case. In the initial final report one Abdul Rashid
ASI had mentioned that there was a dispute among the
brothers on the day over partition of the property. So we
cannot exclude the possibility that may be, out of the brothers
some chose to do away with their brother as right from the

beginning the seat of injuries had excluded the possibility of

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah,
10

suicide, and we exclude that possibility even today. But the
question is still unanswered that who killed the deceased?
The appellant allegedly confessed her guilt before the Court
of Judicial Magistrate, where she introduced one Hameed the
co-accused, with negative relations but to say “yes” the
prosecution will have to establish on record that it was non
else but the appellant. The prosecution lost its honour, when
it concealed the truth regarding her arrest and investigation
before registration of case and after her confinement in the
judicial lock up. In case titled, “Sadi Ahmad and another Vs

the State”, (2019 SCMR 1226), wherein it is held that:

“Prosecution has not been able to drive
home the charge beyond reasonable
doubt, therefore, in the absence of
reliable evidence appellants' conviction
on moral satisfaction alone cannot
sustain; they are extended the benefit of
the doubt.”

11. The prosecution claimed its success merely on the

strength of confessional statement of the appellant and this is

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadultah.
Il

what the trial Court happily acceded to, without taking pains

to assess, as to whether the Judicial Magistrate followed the

guide lines laid down by the High court Rules and that by the

Superior Courts from time to time? In case titled

“Muhammad Azhar Hussain and another Vs the State and

another” (PLD 2019 SC 595), wherein it is held that:

“We have also not felt comfortable with
the printed form, purportedly used to
administer warnings to the accused
before recording of their statements. A
confession may entail formidable
consequences for an accused facing
indictment and thus it is incumbent
upon the Magistrate to ensure that the
maker consciously comprehends the
consequences of his choice and thus it
is most important that the Magistrate
himself, face to face, faithfully
communicates to the accused all the
relevant warnings, as contemplated by
Section 364 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898, a surer way to
establish that the confession is free
from all taints, thus we would not
approve convenience procuring
accused's signature on a_ printed

format.”

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.

12. After reading the confessional statement and
going through the statement of the concerned Magistrate who
was examined as PW-03, we were shocked to see that it was
recorded in utter disregard of law and principles laid down
and even PW-03 fell a prey to willful errors, which cannot be
condoned. While reading the confessional statement the
questionnaire was a printed proforma with “Yes’& “No”
replies neither the necessary questions were asked nor the
magistrate could explain in the way he was supposed to, so
much so he did not identify to her, himself. The lady was
rushed to him in unholy haste and the time provided for
thinking was only five minutes, what in a hurry the
Magistrate was, that left him unrealized that the accused
before him was a house wife of tender age. He could not
explain that the accused was made to understand in Pushto
being uneducated , no opportunity was provided to consult
some one of her trust, rather she was examined in an
atmosphere of tension and uncertainty, not only she was

confused but the judicial Magistrate was also confused ,who

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
13

in his examination in chief constantly stated “He’ Instead of
“She” which later on was corrected and even this finds
mention in the certificate Ex:P W 3/3, when this is the state of
affairs, what sanctity can be attached to the Magistrate and to
the confession he recorded, the judicial Magistrate has
mentioned that the accused after recording her confession
was handed over to the Naib Court who lodged her in the
judicial lockup but PW-8 haji Sher Ahmad stated in the
following words “From district Courts the accused was taken
to the central Jail, Bannu and from there we proceeded to the
house of absconding co-accused for house search”, so the
Magistrate too went on telling lie and his this conduct has
seriously questioned the integrity of his office and status and
his this conduct can neither be ignored nor condoned. In case

titled “Azeem Khan and another Vs Mujahid Khan and

others” (2016 SCMR 274), wherein it is held that:

“15. Keeping in view the High Court Rules,
laying down a binding procedure for taking
required precautions and observing the

requirements of the provision of section 364

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadutlah.
14

read with section 164, Cr.P.C. by now it has
become a trite law that before recording
confession and that too in crimes entailing
capital punishment, the Recording Magistrate
has to essentially observe all these mandatory
precautions. The fundamental logic behind
the same is that, all signs of fear inculcated
by the Investigating Agency in the mind of
the accused are to be shedded out and he is to
be provided full assurance that in case he is
not guilty or is not making a confession
voluntarily then in that case, he would not be
handed over back to the police. Thereafter,
sufficient time for reflection is to be given
after the first warning is administered. At the
expiry of that time, Recording Magistrate has
to administer the second warning and the
accused shall be assured that now he was in
the safe hands. All police officials whether in
uniform or otherwise, including Naib Court
attached to the Court must be kept outside the
Court and beyond the view of the accused.
After observing all these legal requirements if
the accused person is willing to confess, then
all required questions formulated by the High
Court Rules should be put to him and the
answers given, be recorded in the words
spoken by him. The statement of accused be
recorded by the Magistrate with his own hand
and in case there is a genuine compelling
reason then, a special note is to be given that

the same was dictated to a responsible official

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
15

of the Court like Stenographer or Reader and
oath shall also be administered to such
Official that he would correctly type or write
the true and correct version, the accused
stated and dictated by the Magistrate. In case,
the accused is illiterate, the confession he
makes, if recorded in another language i.e.
Urdu or English then, after its completion,
the same be read-over and explained to him
in the language, the accused fully understand
and thereafter a certificate, as required under
section 364, Cr.P.C. with regard to these
proceedings be given by the Magistrate under
his seal and signatures and the accused shall
be sent to jail on judicial remand and during
this process at no occasion he shall be
handed over to any police official/officer
whether he is Naib Court wearing police
uniform, or any other police officialV/officer,
because such careless dispensation would
considerably diminish the voluntary nature of

the confession, made by the accused.”

13. The prosecution went with a set of interested
witnesses to ravish the life of a young lady and even badly
failed to collect evidence against the co-accused, who was
already acquitted by the trial Court. The complainant
admitted that she was a house wife, he further admitted that

no mobile was found in her possession and even the

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah,
16

prosecution could not collect the cell data record to link her
with the co-accused. We are further surprised that why rest of

the inmates did not charge her but only the interested one.

14. The complainant stated that when he arrived the
room the deceased was lying in serious condition with a .30
bore pistol in his hand, so it further disturbs that how the
pistol came in his hand. The mode and manner of killing is
still a mystery. The investigating officer stated that he
collected blood stained earth from beneath the “cot” but why
the mattress and charpaye were not stained with blood. The
prosecution failed in all respects to tell that who killed the
deceased and this burden was never shifted to the accused

that too when confession was later on retracted. In case titled

“Muhammad Azhar Hussain and another Vs the State and
another” (PLD 2019 SC 595), wherein it is held that:

“On an overall analysis of the
prosecution case, confessional statement
cannot be relied upon without potential
risk of error. In the absence of
evidentiary certainty, it would be unsafe

to maintain the convictions on moral

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
©

17

satisfaction that certainly cannot equate

with legal proof.”
15. One important factor of the case is that the co-
accused Hamidullah was acquitted by the trial Court and the
appeal filed therefrom has also been dismissed by this Court,
as the evidence led by the prosecution was found
unsatisfactory, the appellant allegedly confessed her guilt
before the Court of Judicial Magistrate, where the cause of
the death was given as love affairs with Hamidullah and as
such Hamidullah was the source of inspiration for her to kill
and marry, but once the involvement of Hamidullah has been
disbelieved by this Court then singularly the accused/
appellant cannot be held responsible for commission of the
offence as no cause was there for her to commit the murder.
Admittedly, the complainant stated that she was a house wife
and initially no mobile was there in her possession to contact
the co-accused and also the prosecution did not collect the
Call Data Record to substantiate the affair between the two,
even otherwise the mode and manner of the occurrence is

shrouded in mystery and till end it could not be ascertained

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah,
“A

18

as to how and who was the actual culprit and as such the
entire case is the outcome of hypothesis without any legal
proof and when this is the situation then the benefit of doubt

if any must be extended to the accused.

16. After reading the prosecution case in depth this
Court has reached to an inescapable conclusion that the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove the case against the
appellant. Resultantly, this criminal appeal is allowed and the
appellant is acquitted of the charges levelled against and she
is to be released forthwith if not required to be detained in
connection of any other criminal case. The connected Cr. R

No.70-B of 2017, is dismissed.

Above are the reasons of our short order of the even

date.
