ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- At a trial held by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-III, Swabi, accused Adil Bacha
and Sahid, having been found guilty of committing murder
of Amjad Ali Shah deceased, have been convicted under
section 302 (b) PPC and sentenced to undergo
imprisonment for life each and to pay Rs.1,00,000/- each,
as compensation to legal heirs of the deceased in terms of
section 544-A Cr.P.C. and in default thereof to undergo 06
months simple imprisonment vide judgment dated
23.09.2017, in case FIR No.552 dated 05.08.2014,
registered under sections 302/34 PPC at Police Station
Swabi. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. has been extended

to them.
2. Against their conviction, convict Adil Bacha has
filed the instant appeal and convict Sahid, has filed
connected Cr.A. No.578-P/2017, whereas, complainant
Babar Ali Shahh has filed Cr.R. No.131-P/2017, seeking
enhancement of sentence of the convicts from life
imprisonment to normal penalty of death as provided for
the offence.

3. Since, the appeals and the revision are arising out
from one and the same judgment dated 23.09.2017 of the
learned trial Court, therefore, are being decided through
this common judgment.

4. The prosecution case, as unfolded in First
Information Report/FIR (Exh.PA) is that on 05.08.2014 at
2225 hours, complainant Babar Ali Shah (PW.12) with the
help of his co-villagers brought the dead body of his father
Amjad Ali Shah deceased to Bacha Khan Medical
Complex (BMC), Shah Mansoor, and reported to Fazal
Miraj SI (PW.4) to the effect that on the night of
occurrence he along with his mother, namely,
Mst. Shaheen Akhtar and the deceased, was present in their
house, situated in village Panj Pir when at 2110 hours,
someone knock at the door of their house. The deceased
went outside to see the knocker and he followed him. The
moment the deceased came out from the house, Adil Bacha
and Sahid (appellants) as well as their co-accused Jabir Ali

Shah, emerged. Out of them, appellant Sahid opened fire at
the deceased with his pistol, as a result, he got hit and died
at the spot. After commission of the offence, the accused
decamped from the spot. Motive behind the occurrence is
that the deceased was annoyed on the friendly relationship
of his son/accused Jabir Ali Shah with co-accused Sahid
and Adil Bacha. Report of the complainant was reduced
into writing in the shape of Murasila Exh.PA/1 by Fazal
Miraj SI (PW.4), who also prepared injury sheet and
inquest report of the deceased Exh.PW.4/1 and
Exh.PW.4/2, respectively, and shifted his dead body to the
mortuary for postmortem examination.

5. Dr. Syed Muhammad Kashif (PW.9) conducted
autopsy on the dead body of the deceased on 05.08.2014 at

09.50 p.m. and found the following injuries on his person:-

1. Firearm entry wound below neck (midline of
back).
2. Firearm exit wound on left axilla (bullet extracted

and handed over to police).

Firearm entry wound on right cheek (mid).
Firearm exit wound behind the right ear.
Two firearm entry wound on right cheek.
Firearm exit wound near the second bullet.

Firearm entry wound on top of skull.

onan Fs

Firearm exit wound on back of skull (occipital
region).

9. Firearm entry wound on left eyebrow.

10. Firearm exit wound near right mandible below

cheek.
According to his opinion, firearm injuries
sustained by the deceased on his head, led to his unnatural
death. Probable time between injury and death has been
opined by him as 2 to 5 minutes whereas between death
and postmortem as % hours.

6. Ghani Said Khan Inspector (PW.13), conducted
investigation in the case, who proceeded to the spot and
prepared site plan Exh.PB at the pointation of the
complainant. During spot inspection, he took into
possession bloodstained pebbles from the place of the
deceased vide recovery memo Exh.PW.6/1 and two
empties of .30 bore lying in scattered position vide
recovery memo Exh.PW.6/2. Vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.6/3, he took into possession the last worn
bloodstained garments of the deceased and a spent bullet
extracted from the body of the deceased by the medical
officer vide recovery memo Exh.Pw.3/1. He sent the
bloodstained articles to the FSL, report whereof is Exh.PK.
Similarly, he sent the empties to the FSL for safe custody
vide application Exh.PW.13/2. Accused Jabir Ali and Adil
Bacha, arrested by SHO Sher Afsar, were handed over to
him, who obtained their two days police custody, recorded
their statements under section 161 Cr.P.C. and produced
them before the learned Illaqa Judicial Magistrate vide
application Exh.PW.10/1, where, both of them recorded

their confessional statements. He initiated proceedings
under section 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. against accused Sahid.
On 01.01.2015, accused Sahid was arrested. He
interrogated him and recorded his statement under section
161 Cr.P.C. On completion of investigation he handed over
case file to the SHO for submission of challan against the
accused.

7. Since, accused Jabir Ali Shah was a juvenile,
therefore, separate challan under the Juvenile Justice
System Ordinance was submitted against him, whereas,
complete challan was submitted against accused/appellants
Adil Bacha and Sahid before the learned trial Court, where
both were charge sheeted to which they pleaded not guilty
and claimed trial. In order to prove its case, the prosecution
examined as many as thirteen witnesses. After closure of
the prosecution evidence, statements of the appellants were
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C. wherein they denied
the prosecution allegations and professed their innocence.
They, however, declined to be examined on oath under
section 340(2) Cr.P.C. or to produce evidence in defence.
On conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court, after hearing
both the parties, convicted and sentenced the appellants as
mentioned vide judgment impugned herein.

8. We have heard the exhaustive arguments of
learned counsel for the parties and perused the record with

their valuable assistance.
9. To prove the guilt of appellants, the prosecution
has relied upon the ocular account of the alleged
eyewitness/complainant Babar Ali Shah (PW.12), the
confessional statements of accused Adil Bacha and Jabir
Ali Shah as well as medical evidence and recoveries from
the spot. The learned trial Court while believing the
aforesaid evidence has recorded conviction of the
appellants. To concur or disagree with the view of the
learned trial Court, we will reappraise the evidence relied
upon by the prosecution.

10. According to FIR, the occurrence has taken place
in the month of August at 2110 hours i.e. (09.10 p.m) and
by such time the dark completely prevails. Complainant
Babar Ali Shah (PW.12), neither in his report/FIR nor in
court statement has uttered a single word about the source
of light in which he identified the accused and this fact has
also been admitted by the Ghani Said Khan Inspector
(PW.13)/Investigating Officer. In the site plan Exh.PB, the
deceased is shown at point No.1 and complainant at point
No.2 and distance between these two points is given as
6 feet. Similarly, appellant Sahid, to whom the specific role
of firing has been attributed, is shown at point No.3, which
is at a distance of 16 feet from point No.2 i.e. the place of
complainant. Accused Jabir and Adil Bacha, have been
shown at points No.4 and 5, respectively, which are at a

distance of 21 and 26 feet, respectively, from the place of
complainant at point No.2. AS discussed above, about
darkness of night, the site plan Exh.PB is also silent about
availability of any source of light at the spot as no light or
lamp was taken into possession by Ghani Said Khan
Inspector (PW.13), rather, he in his statement has admitted
that no source of light was disclosed to him by the
complainant. In the foot notes of the site plan Exh.PB it has
been categorically mentioned by the I.O. that the spot was
inspected and site plan was prepared with the help of
headlights of vehicle and torch. In absence of any tangible
and concrete evidence to prove the availability of light on
the spot at the time of occurrence, we are firm in our view
to hold that identification of the assailants from the
distances of 16, 21 and 26 feet, was next to impossible,
what to speak of identifying firing of a particular person
hitting the deceased. This sole ground is sufficient for
discarding the testimony of complainant that he is not a
truthful witness. However, for safe administration of
justice we would like to scrutinize his testimony.
Complainant poses himself to be the eyewitness of
the occurrence. It is in the prosecution evidence that
appellant Jabir Ali Shah is the step brother of complainant.
In cross-examination, complainant disclosed that he has
five paternal Aunts, namely, Mst. Bas Nama, Mst. Gul
Hamida, Mst. Irshada, Mst. Asia and Mst. Bakht Safa, who

all have grown up sons and that his above named aunts
have never demanded their shares in the property of the
deceased. By taking summersault in the next breath he
admitted that his above named paternal aunts has instituted
a civil suit in respect of their share in the property of the
deceased wherein he had submitted cognovit in their
favour. He further disclosed that the said suit is still
pending in the civil Court Swabi wherein accused Jabir Ali
Shah along with his brothers Hasan, Jehangir and their
mother Mst. Shaheen are also defendants and they have
denied the claim of his paternal Aunts. He further disclosed
that, after second marriage of his deceased father with Mst.
Shaheen Akhtar, his mother Mst. Raveda (first wife of the
deceased) was expelled by the deceased along with her
daughter Mst. Marwa, therefore, they were residing in the
house of his maternal grandfather, however, he was
residing with his deceased father. Blowing hot and cold in
the next breath he deposed that “I lived in the house of
my maternal grandfather for three years till the death
of my deceased father”. He further deposed that after the
occurrence they were shifted to a nearby house situated
near the house of the deceased on account of Jirga
decision. He admitted that during the days of occurrence
Mst. Shaheen Akhtar (second wife of the deceased) along
with her sons Jehangir and Hassan was residing with the
deceased. He deposed that the distance between the house

of his maternal grandfather and the deceased can be
covered within 2/3 minutes. Both the houses are situated in
different streets. He admitted it correct that a mosque is
situated near the house of his maternal grandfather wherein
he used to teach Islamic education to children after
Maghrib prayers. The circumstances disclosed by the
complainant clearly prove that after second marriage by the
deceased with Mst. Shaheen Akhtar, the complainant along
with his mother and sister was expelled from the house by
the deceased, therefore, they were residing in the house of
his maternal grandfather. Besides, the complainant used to
teach Islamic education to the children in a Mosque
situated near the house of his grandfather. In this view of
the matter, presence of the complainant in the house of the
deceased is beyond the understanding of a prudent mind
because if the relation of the deceased were so strained
with mother of the complainant that she along with
children was expelled from the house then living of the
complainant in the house of his father does not appeal to a
prudent mind. In this view of the matter, the complainant
falls within the category of chance witness. The hon’ble
Supreme Court in case titled, “Mst. Rukhsana Begum
and others vs Sajjad and others” (2017 SCMR 596), has
explained the meaning of a “chance witness”, in the
following words:-
“Chance witness” was one who, in the normal

course was not supposed to be present on the
10

crime spot unless he offered cogent,

convincing and_ believable explanation

justifying his presence there”.
No explanation, much less plausible has been furnished by
the complainant so as to justify his presence in the house
of the deceased. Rather sufficient circumstances have been
disclosed by the complainant in his statement on the basis
of which his presence in the house of the deceased cannot
be admitted by any stretch of imagination.
11. Adverting to the confessional statements of
appellant Adil Bacha, the same is exculpatory. He has
shown complete ignorance about his involvement in the
murder of the deceased. He disclosed that on the night of
occurrence he was informed by appellant Sahid through a
text message to reach the house of appellant Adil Bacha for
chit chat. After sometime, he reached his house and they
both left for the house of accused Jabir Ali Shah on a
motorbike, where the motorbike was parked at some
distance from the house of accused Jabir Ali Shah and he
was told by appellant Sahid to guard the motorcycle and
wait for him. Appellant Sahid went towards the house of
the deceased and after sometime he (Adil Bacha) heard the
report of fire shots and noticed appellant Sahid along with
accused Jabir Ali Shah running towards him. He inquired
from them as to whether someone has fired at them or they

have fired at someone. In response he was told by them not
11

to talk and they all proceeded to Darra Petrol Pump on the
same motorbike, where accused Jabir Ali Shah was
informed by someone about murder of his father on mobile
call. In the confessional statement he has shown his
ignorance about the occurrence and similarly he has also
not disclosed about the role of co-accused.

As regards confessional statement of accused Jabir
Ali Shah, he has stated therein that he had friendly/love
relationship with appellant Sahid on which his deceased
father was annoyed and used to beat him. Having
embarrassed from the attitude of his father, he along with
appellant Sahid made a plan for committing the murder of
the deceased and on the night of occurrence he told
appellant Sahid on phone call to visit his house along with
pistol, who accordingly reached there along with appellant
Adil Bacha. According to the scheme, appellant Adil
Bacha was directed to stand near the motorcycle and wait
for them, whereas, he and appellant Sahid went towards the
door of the house of deceased. He knocked at the door on
which the deceased came out and appellant Sahid opened
fire at him, as a result, he got hit. They both rushed towards
the motorcycle and decamped from the spot.
12. Thorough perusal of the confessional statements of
both the accused reveals that both are contradictory with
each other on material fact. According to the statement of

accused Adil Bacha when he along with accused Sahid
12

reached the spot and he was directed to stand near the
motorbike and wait for him. He has not uttered a single
word about arrival of accused Jabir Ali Shah there i.e. the
place of parking of motorcycle, whereas, according to
accused Jabir Ali Shah when appellants Sahid and Adil
Bacha reached the spot, he meet them, prepared plan and
directed appellant Adil Bacha to wait for them near the
motorcycle and he along with Sahid went towards the
house of the deceased. Again according to statement of
accused Jabir Ali Shah he told accused Sahid on phone to
bring pistol, whereas, accused Adil Bacha who
accompanied accused Sahid to the spot has not uttered a
single word about availability of any pistol with appellant
Sahid. Besides, confessional statement of accused Jabir Ali
Shah is not corroborated by any other strong evidence. The
I.O. has not brought on file, record of text message
allegedly sent by appellant Sahid to appellant Adil Bacha.
Similarly, he has also not procured record of the alleged
call of appellant Sahid made to appellant Adil Bacha on the
night of occurrence in respect of their visit to the house of
Jabir Ali Shah for chit chat. Similar is the case of the call
of accused Jabir Ali Shah allegedly made to appellant
Sahid regarding reaching the spot along with pistol. The
motorcycle used in the commission of offence has also not
been recovered. Appellant Sahid who had been given

specific role of firing at the deceased has not recorded any
13

confessional statement. For the sake of arguments if the
confessional statement of accused Jabir Ali Shah is taken
into consideration, the same can only be used as a
circumstance against appellant Sahid but subject to strong
corroboration from other independent pieces of evidence
and its proof during trial, which is missing in the instant
case. No crime weapon has been shown recovered from
appellant Sahid. The two crime empties of .30 bore
recovered from the spot, though have been sent to the FSL,
but only for the purpose of safe custody. There is no FSL
report as to whether these have been fired from one or
more than one weapon.

13. Yet there is another aspect of the case which
further damages the prosecution case. The confessional
statements of the accused have been recorded by Ijaz ur
Rehman Judicial Magistate (PW.10), who in cross-
examination disclosed that accused Jabir Ali and Adil
Bacha were produced before him on 11.08.2012 and on
that very day they did not volunteer to record their
confessional statements. Two days physical custody of the
accused was granted and on 13.08.2014 i.e. expiry of
custody both the accused were produced before him at
12.30 pm through a single application. He admitted it
correct that he has not mentioned that at the time of
recording statement of accused Jabir Ali Shah, appellant

Adil Bacha was made to sit outside the court and similar is
14

the position when the statement of Adil Bacha was being
recorded by him. He admitted it correct that in the
respective certificates attached with the confessional
statements of the accused Adil Bacha and Jabir Ali Shah,
he has not specifically mentioned that he read over to
them their confessional statement in Pashto or so
explained. Ghani Said Khan Inspector (PW.13), who
produced the accused before the learned Judicial
Magistrate for recording their confessional statements
admitted it correct that on the first day of their production
the accused were not ready to confess their guilt, therefore,
their two days physical remand was obtained. According to
the I.O. he produced both accused for recording their
confessional statements at 11.00 am and both remained
inside the court room till 3.00 p.m. Statement of the I.O is
contradictory with the statement of Ijaz ur Rehman Judicial
Magistrate (PW.10). According to him the accused were
produced before him by the I.O. at 12.30 p.m. and he
recorded the statements at 1.45 p.m. Confessional
statements of the accused recorded by the Magistrate, in
light of the peculiar facts and circumstances discussed
above being involuntary and result of torture as well as
suffering from mandatory procedural irregularities is the
most suspicious piece of evidence in the whole case,
besides having been retracted. It might be right that

retracted confession, if corroborated by independent
15

evidence of reliable nature, can be made basis for
conviction on a capital charge, but it must be subject to
thorough judicial scrutiny. It is trite law that for accepting a
confession, two essential requirements must be fulfilled i.e.
the confession was made voluntarily, it was based on true
account of facts, leading to the crime and the same was
proved at the trial. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in case
titled, “Azeem Khan and another Vs Mujahid Khan and
others” (2016 SCMR 274) has given strict guidelines for
the Magistrate, recording confession, to be followed
without any exception, which for the sake of convenience

and ready reference are reproduced below:-

“Before recording confession and that too in crime
entailing capital punishment, the recording
Magistrate had to essentially observe all the
mandatory precautions (laid down in the High Court
Rules and Orders). Fundamental logic behind the
same was that, all signs of fear inculcated by the
investigating agency in the mind of the accused
were to be shed out and he was to be provided full
assurance that in case he was not guilty or was not
making a confessional voluntarily then in that case
he would not be handed over back to the police.
Thereafter, sufficient time for reflection was to be
given after the first warning was administered. At
the expiry of such time, recording Magistrate had to
administer the second warning and the accused shall
be assured that now he was in the safe hands. All
police officials whether in uniform or otherwise,
including Naib Court attached to the Court must be
kept outside the court and beyond the view of the
accused. After observing all these legal

requirements if the accused person was willing to
16

confess then, all required questions as formulated
by the High court Rules and Orders should be put to
him and the answers given, be recorded in the
words spoken by him. Statement of accused should
be recorded by the Magistrate with his own hand
and in case there was a genuine compelling reason
then, a special note was to be given that the same
was dictated to a responsible official of the Court
like stenographer or reader and oath shall also be
administered to such official that he would correctly
type or writ the true and correct version. In case, the
accused was illiterate, and made a confession,
which was recorded in another language i.e. Urdu or
English, then the same should be read-over and
explained to him in the language he fully
understood, and thereafter a certificate, as required
under section 364 Cr.P.C. with regard to these
proceedings should be given by the Magistrate
under his seal and signatures and the accused shall
be sent to jail on judicial remand and during this
process at no occasion he shall be handed over to
any police official/officer whether he was Naib
Court wearing police uniform or any other police
official/officer, because such careless dispensation
would considerably diminish the voluntary nature of

the confession, made by the accused.”

14. The above mentioned strict guidelines of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court have not been followed by the
learned Judicial Magistrate at the time of recording the
confessional statements of the accused. In this view of the
matter, the confessional statements which on one hand are
exculpatory and on the other hand, not corroborated and
proved during trial, are of no legal worth, therefore, is
excluded from consideration in light of the ratio of

judgment (supra) of the Honble Supreme Court.
17

15. Recovery of blood from the spot, the last worn
bloodstained argument of the deceased, positive Serologist
in respect thereof coupled with postmortem of the
deceased, though confirm the unnatural death of the
deceased with firearm at the spot as alleged by the
prosecution, but never tell the names of the culprit (s).
Such pieces of supporting and corroborative evidence are
always taken into consideration along with direct evidence
and not in isolation. In support, reliance can be placed in
on the judgments rendered by the Hon’ble apex court in
Ijaz Ahmed’s case (1997 SCMR 1279 and Asadullah’s
case (PLD 1971 SC 541) and case titled, “Saifullah vs
the State” (1985 SCMR 410)

16. For what has been discussed above, we have no
hesitation to hold that the prosecution has miserably failed
to prove the guilt of the appellants through cogent and
confidence inspiring direct or circumstantial evidence. The
prosecution case is pregnant with doubts benefit of which
should have been extended to the appellants but the learned
trial Court by not appreciating the evidence in its true
perspective arrived at a wrong conclusion by holding the
appellants guilty of the offence. As per golden principle of
benefit of doubt one substantial doubt would be enough for
acquittal of the accused. Under principle enunciated by the
august apex court of the country through different

pronouncements, by now it is settled law that conviction
18

must be based on unimpeachable evidence and certainty of
guilt and any doubt arising in prosecution case must be
resolved in favour of the accused.

17. Resultantly, this and the connected Cr.A. No.578-

P/2017, titled, “Sahid Vs State etc” are allowed, conviction
and sentences of the appellants recorded by the learned
trial court vide impugned judgment are hereby set aside
and they are acquitted from the charges leveled against
them. They be set at liberty forthwith, if not confined in
any other case.
18. On acquittal of the appellants, connected Cr.R.
No.131-P/2017, titled, “Babar Ali Shah vs the State and
others” has become infructuous which is hereby dismissed.
19. These are the reasons of our short order of even
date, which is reproduced below:-

For reasons to be recorded later through a

common judgment, this and the connected

Cr.A. No.578-P/2017, filed by appellants Adil

Bacha and Sahid, respectively, are allowed,

resultantly, their conviction and sentences

recorded by the learned Additional Sessions

Judge-III, Swabi under section 302(b) PPC

vide judgment dated 23.09.2017, in case FIR

No.552 dated 05.08.2014, under sections

302/34 PPC, Police Station Swabi, are hereby

set-aside. The appellants are acquitted from
19

the charge in the cited case. They be set at

liberty forthwith, if not confined in any other
