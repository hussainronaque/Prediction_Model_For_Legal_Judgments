PWI/I. Statement of complainant recorded as PW-S,
while the statement of real brother of deceased namely

Jchanzeb Khan recorded as PW-6.

6. learned counsel for the appellant vehemently

argued that the impugned judgment of the tial Court is

the result of misreading, and hon-reading of evidence: that
the testimony of PW-5 is full of contradictions and
discrepancies while ocular account is belied by medical
evidence as well as circumstantial evidence and the site
plan; that the learned trial Court has not taken the legal
aspect of the case that PW-5 is the husband of deceased
and interested witness and accused cannot be convicted
upon the sole evidence of this single witness. Moreover,
motive and previous enmity not proved so the learned trial
Court has erved in law while convicting the appellant by
awarding life imprisonment, hence, the impugned

Judgment is liable to reversal and accused be acquitted.

Bani Named

Ie On the other hand, learned A.A.G assisted by

learned counsel for complainant have strongly opposed
the arguments, advanced by the learned counsel for the
appellant by submitting that the appellant Med away from
the spot alongwith absconding, co-accused who are
directly charged in promptly lodged FIR for murder of
deceased lady. The occurrence is a broad day fight ane
question oF misidentification did not arise accused having,
common intention which has been proved through cogent,
coherent’ and confidence inspiring ocular evidence
supported by circumstantial evidence in the shape of
various recoveries from the crime venue as well as
through medical evidence, thus, he has rightly been
convicted by the learned trial Court. They further argued
that FSL report of blood stained earth recovered emply P-
! from the place of deceased are in line with the
proseculion case. Moreover, there is no legal impediment
that conviction could not be judged upon the evidence of
single witness and same single witness is natural,
trustworthy and of lull credence could be relied upon,

hence, the cnse

eainst the accused/appellunt is fully

established. ln support of criminal revision, learned

counsel contended that prosecution has proved the guiltol

-6-

the appellant upto the hilt and in the circumstances, the

punishment of accused may be enhanced by awarding him

death penalty for such a brutal murder.

8. We have heard and considered the

submis

ions of learned counsel for the parties and the

leaned A.A.G for the State and gone through the record.

9: From the perusal of record it reveals that the
crime reported was committed inside the residential house
of private respondents. Appellant, co-accused and
complainant are real brother inter se while deceased lady
Mst. Akhtar Bano was the wife of complainant. Both the
accused decaniped trom the spot but accused Shamim
Khan was arrested on 15.9.2011 while accused
Wahidullah afier occurrence absconded and was
proceeded under section 512 Cr.P.C on 29.11.2011. All
the witnesses referred above were subjected to a taxing
cross-examination but defence failed for bringing on
record some incansistency in the statement of prosecution

witnesses about the main story. We have found nothing in

their lestimony to create any suspicion the benefit of

which could be extended to appellant.

ATYFOSTED
EXAMINE:

Posteawar High Coun
Ranou Kench

10. PW-5 is complainant in| whose presence
incidence occurred. His credibility could net brushed

aside only on the ground that deceased was his wile and

had [falsely implicated the two accused who are his real
brothers, hence was put to severe cross-examination at
length but defence failed to shatter his veracily. Moreover,
trom the other circumstantial and corroborating, evidence
on record his presence at the place of occurrence but the
incident as narrated in the FIR had been proved. There is
no need of'so many witnesses but single witness is enough
if upon deep exarnining his evidence is found believable
and confidence inspiring that can be relied upon. So in

this 4

irc arguments of learned counsel for appellant

have no foree that complainant evidence is not believable.

Le The learned trial Judpe, while giving the
judgment impugned herein, has attended each and every
piece of evidence with judicial care and caution and afier

Ploper appreciation of the same evidence on record had

ched to the conclusion that prosecution has succeeded
to bring guilt at home to the accused/appellant: beyond
reasonable doubt but the only mitigating circumstance that
occurrence took place all of sudden within the house as

eo-aceused Wahichdlah upon altercation with his deceased

“bhabe at the spur of moment commanded his brother

Shamim Khan to kill her who by acting upon the said
command had killed her, escaped the proper judicial
indulgence by the learned trial Court.

12
eyewitness and findings of — trial Court below, it
clearly showed that there was no background of ill-will or
bitterness between the accused/appellant and deceased
lady or her husband/complainant, the incident crupted all
of sudden without any premeditation as it was alright
before occurrence and complainant while deposed he
stited nothing, about previous ill-will of slightest nature
among his brothers, bis wile and him, so the present case
was one of sudden provocation and altercation which

resulted into unfortinite incident,

13. For the dispensation of criminal justice

specially cases involving capital punishment high degree

of care and caution is required while analyzing and

examining, the evidence of witnesses about oral account of

the incident as well as material collected and brought on

record as evidence.

2. From the perusal of FIR; statement of

lA. It is competence and quality of evidence
whieh has to be taken into consideration and its reliability
upon Ue touchstone of principles enunciated by the
ltonourable Supreme Coiiit of Pakistan, The evidence of
husband of deceased lady against his real brothers in a
—! lodged FIR supported by other circumstantial

t of Forensic Science

evidence like medical report, re:
Luboratory cannot be discarded only on the ground that

complainant was husband of deecased lady so to treat him

an, interested witness. In this regard wisdom is derived

from the judgment of Honourable Supreme Court in case
ited “Muhammad Mansha Vs ‘Phe State” cited us
Z00T SCMAR 199 the relevant portion of judiment about
conipetence and about single witness laid down is as

under:-

“tmnerested witness is one who has a motive
10 falsely implicate an accused or has some
previous ennity to involve a_ person
matefidely, No role of law thet statement of
cu interested witness cannot be taken into
consideration without corroboration anal
uncorrobarated version can be relied in
coment with other circumstances of a

In the same judyment conviction can be awarded on the
basis of sole witness is also reproduced for guidance as

below:-

“A bare perusal world reveal that the
language as employed in the ‘said Article
17(1)(b) is free from any ambiguity and no
scholarly interpretation is required. The
provisions as reproduced hereinabove of the
said Article would make it abundant clear
that particular rumber of witnesses shall not
be required for the proof of any fact
meaning thereby that a fact can be proved
only by a single witness "it is not seldom
that a crime has been committed in the
presence of only one witness, leaving aside
those cases which are not of uncommon
vecurrence, where determination of guilt
depends entirely on circunstantial evidence,
Yoothe Legislature were ta ins
plurality witnesses, case where the lextimony
of a single witness only could be available in
proal of the crime, would vo mupinished. It
is here thet the diserction of the Mresidiny:
Jude comes inte play. The matter thus must
depend upon the circumstances of each case
«andl the quality of the evidence of the single
witness whose testimony has to be either
pled or rejected. If such a testimony is

houpor

found by the Court to be entirely reliable,

there ix no legal impediment to the
conviction of the accused person on such
prook kv oay the gilt of an accused
person nity be proved by the testimony of a
siagle witneys, the innocence of an accused
person may be established on the testimony
of a_ single witness, even though
considerable number of witnesses may be
fortheaining to testify to the truth of the
case, for the prosecution. The Court is
concerned with the quality and not with the

quemtity af the evidence neces. for
proving or disproving a facts". (Principles

and Digest af the Law of Evidence by M.
Mouir, page 1458),”

wilt 3

15. So after careful examination of the evidence
on record and the solitary statement of PW-5 and other
corroborating evidence in shape of site plan, postorten
report, cenults af FSI

ate fhe prook that the evidence of

sole witness ol the occurrence is worth credence,
dependable and consistent and the learned trial Court has
correctly appreciated the evidence by convicting the

accused/appellant.

lo. Now the other question for determination
before this Court is as to whether the unfortunate murder
of deveased lady was preplanned and premeditated uct of
offence or same thing happened which resulted into
sudden quarrel of and the said incident. So from the
perusal of FIR and entire record, we are of the considered

view that the occurrence took pl:

at the spur of moment
due to seme sudden altercation and provocation which
could be treated as a mitigating circumstance in the case

Jor reduction of the sentence, awarded to the appellant.

17 Thus, we hold that the case against
appellant/accused fell within the purview of provisions of
section 302 (c) PPC and not under section 302 (b) PPC,

hence, sentence is converted from section 302 (b) PPC to

« ee

section 302 (c) PPC, Consequently, the conviction of
accused/appellant awarded by learned trial Court upheld,
however, the sentence is reduced from rigorous life
imprisonment to 1S years rigorous imprisonment while
the other part ol'sentence as lo compensation to be paid to
the loyal heirs amounting, to Rs. t,00,000/- (ane tae) aod in
dell to futher underpe six months simple
jiprisonment and benclit ol section 382-0) Orc is
maintained. In this regard wisdom is derived from the
judgment of Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in

case tilled as “Azmatullah Vs The State” reported in

ZOE SCMR ELT.

Is. So in the light of above discussion, this
criminal jait appeal is partially allowed and the impugned
judgment is modified in the above terms while criminal

revision petition No.22-B/2013 is hereby dismissed.
