JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- This criminal
appeal is directed against the judgment dated 20.05.2015
passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Lahor (District
Swabi), whereby Afsar Ali, the appellant, involved in case
FIR No. 497 dated 14.04.2011 under sections 302/324/34
PPC of Police Station, Lahor (District Swabi), was convicted

and sentenced as under: -

1. Under section 302(b) r/w 34 PPC to undergo life

with fine of Rs. 20,000/- each or in default thereof

to undergo further three months SI with benefit of
section 382-B Cr.P.C. All the sentences were

ordered to run concurrently.
2. The case of prosecution, as spelt out from the record,
is that on 14.04.2011, complainant Majid Khan lodged a
report in the company of his relatives by stating that they had
a dispute with Afsar Ali and Amir Muhammad over a
demolition of bridge and on the day of occurrence, he
along with his brother Sajid, uncle Mukamil Khan and cousin
Niaz Muhammad were on the way to their field when they, at
07.00 hours, reached near the field known as “Wand Urmar
Land”, in the meantime, Afsar Ali and Amir Muhammad
emerged duly armed and started firing at them, due to which
his brother Sajid was hit and died at the spot, while he, his
uncle and cousin narrowly escaped from their firing. Both the
accused, after commission of the offence, fled away from the
spot. On the report of complainant, the present case FIR
Exh.PA was registered against both the accused.

3. Bakht Afzal Khan SI (PW-6) after recording report of
the complainant, preparing injury sheet and inquest report of
the deceased, referred the corpus to the DHQ hospital, Swabi,
where Dr. Asghar Ali Shah (PW-09) conducted autopsy and
found the following on his person.

Wound:

1. Firearm entrance wound on the left side temporal area on skull
size abut x 4 cm.

2. Firearm exit wound on right side temporal area damaging the
right ear size about 2 x 2 cm in length.

Scalp, skull, membranes and brain injured.
Abdomen.
All the abdominal organs found health with empty
stomach.
Muscles, bones and joints.

Scalp muscles were injured.

organs like brain, leading to hemorrhage, shock and death.
Probable time between injury and death.....instantaneous
Between death and postmortem within about 2- % hours.
The postmortem papers are Exh.PM/1 and Ex.PM/2.

4. Tariq Saeed Khan ASI (PW-4) was entrusted with
investigation of the case. He visited the spot and prepared the
site plan, Ex.PB. During spot inspection, he took into
possession blood stained earth from the place of deceased,
vide memo Ex.PW 4/1. He also collected two empties of
8 MM from the place of accused Afsar Ali and eight empties
from the place of accused Amir Muhammad, vide memos
Exh. PW 4/2 & Ex.PW 4/3, while blood stained garments of
the deceased were taken vide memo Ex PW 4/4. He also sent
blood stained garments of the deceased, eight empties of 7.62
bore and two empties of 8 MM to the FSL. He arrested
accused Amir Muhammad in the case. Since accused Afsar
Khan, the appellant, was avoiding his lawful arrest, therefore,
he applied for issuance of warrant under section 204 and
proclamation under section 87 Cr.P.C which were
accordingly issued. After submission of challan before the
court, accused Amir Muhammad was tried by the court of
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Lahor, and after
conclusion of trial, he was convicted and sentenced vide
judgment dated 26.11.2011, which judgment was upheld till
the apex Court, vide judgment dated 27.04.2017.

5. Since the present appellant, namely, Afsar Ali, was
absconding and on his arrest on 11.03.2012, supplementary

challan against him was submitted before the Court. Learned
trial Court after framing of charge, recording statements of
prosecution witnesses and that of accused under section 342
Cr.P.C and hearing arguments, convicted and sentenced the
appellant-convict, as stated above, hence, the instant appeal.
6. Learned counsel for the accused-appellant argued that
the prosecution has failed to bring home the charge against
the convict by producing trustworthy, reliable and convincing
evidence. He further argued that the eye-account furnished by
the complainant Majid Khan (PW-2) and PW Mukamil Khan
(PW-3) are not in line to each other, therefore, the same could
not be believed for maintaining the conviction and sentences.
He next submitted that presence of PW-2 and PW-3 has not
been established and they have falsely deposed against the
appellant due to his close relationship with the deceased.
According to him, recovery of two empties of 8 MM from the
place of appellant is planted one and while concluding his
arguments, he submitted that the trial Court has not examined
the evidence of prosecution witnesses in accordance with
recognized principles of appreciation of evidence available on
record, therefore, the impugned judgment of conviction is
against the law and without any cogent evidence, as such, the
same is liable to be set aside and the appellant be acquitted of
the charge.

7. As against that, learned AAG and counsel for the
complainant argued that not only presence of the PWs has
been proved from the evidence available on record but their

presence was also established in the previous trial which
judgment has attained finality as it was maintained up to the
apex Court. According to them, the incident took place in
broad day light and the parties were also engaged in enmity,
therefore, being known to each other, identification of the
appellant is out of question. They submitted that not only the
testimony furnished by the complainant and the eyewitness is
straightforward, honest and reliable, but same has also been
supported by the testimony of Investigating officer, medical
evidence, recovery of blood-stained earth and crime empties
from the spot as well as blood stained garments of the
deceased coupled with motive and FSL report. They argued
that the prosecution proved its case against the convict-
appellant beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt and
supported the impugned judgment.

8. We have heard learned counsel of the parties and gone
through the record with their valuable assistance.

9. It appears from the record the report was lodged by
complainant Majid Khan (PW-2), the brother of deceased Sajid,
wherein he charged the present appellant Afsar Ali and the
convicted accused Amir Muhammad for the killing of his brother
and ineffective firing at him as well as PW Mukamil Khan. He
reported the matter at 8.10 a.m while the occurrence was taken
place at 07.00 a.m, i.e., after one hour of the occurrence, whereas
the place of occurrence was situated at a distance of 6/7 k.m from
the Police Station, thus, the report has promptly been lodged. In
his report, the complainant has assigned role of indiscriminate

firing to the present appellant as well as to the convicted accused.
In the previous trial, co-accused Amir Khan was convicted and
sentenced to life imprisonment. His appeal against conviction
was dismissed by this court and his conviction and sentences
were also maintained by the apex Court, vide judgment dated
27.04.2017. During the trial of present appellant, both
complainant and PW Mukamil Shah appeared as PW-2 and
PW-3 respectively. Their testimony is consistent on material
points. The presence of complainant and PW Mukamil Khan was
established on the spot. They deposed the ocular testimony and
supported the prosecution version. Despite that they were
subjected to very lengthy cross examinations but nothing
material could be brought out nor any dent could be created in
their evidence. They stood firm and their veracity could not be
shaken. Both the eyewitnesses, no doubt, are related to the
deceased but mere relationship is no ground to discard their
straightforward and confidence inspiring evidence especially
when their presence on the spot has been established. The apex
Court in number of cases has been held that statement of a
witness cannot be disbelieved solely on the plea that he is related
to the deceased. An interested witness is a person who has a
motive to falsely implicate a person. Reliance: Sharafat Ali v.
The State, 1999 SCMR 329, Muhammad Afzal and 3 others
vs. The State,1999 S C M R 1991 and Abdur Rauf vs. The
State, 2003. S C M R 522. Viewing the testimony of the
witnesses in the light of aforesaid criteria, we do not find their
testimony as tainted or they had any motive to falsely implicate

the appellant. No plausible reason has been established by the
defence to indicate why the complainant would substitute the
appellant by leaving real culprits. The testimony of complainant
and Mukamil Khan are convincing one, hence, in our view, the
evidence produced by the prosecution was rightly believed by the
trial Court.

10. The unnatural death of Sajid deceased has also been
proved rather not disputed as the perusal of Postmortem
papers reveals that the injury on the person of the deceased
was of firearm, therefore, medical evidence also supports the
ocular account. Not only the occurrence is of day light but the
parties were already known to each other, therefore, question

of mis-identification does not arise. Again, the prosecution
case has further been supported by the recovery two 8 mm
empties from the place of appellant, blood stained earth and
garments of the deceased. Apart from the above, the appellant
just after the occurrence went into hiding with no plausible
explanation. Abscondence per se is not sufficient to prove the
guilt, but when it goes for a long time for which no
reasonable explanation is given by an accused person coupled
with other evidence on record would be the criteria to
determine his guilt or innocence and, thus, is a corroborative
piece of evidence, therefore, his conduct after the occurrence

is indicative of his guilt when considered in juxtaposition
with the other evidence produced by the prosecution.

11. Yes there is a single entry wound on the person of the
deceased for which two persons, the present appellant and the

convicted accused, are charged and there is no definite
opinion as to whose shot proved fatal but this doubt is not
sufficient for acquittal of the appellant because the bare
reading of section 34 PPC, which introduces the concept of
vicarious or joint Criminal liability under the Penal System of
our country, reveals that when a criminal act is done by
several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all,
each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner
as if it were done by him alone. Hon’able the apex court in
Sh. Muhammad Abid’s case (2011 SCMR_ 1148), has
observed that:

“Once it is found that the accused persons had common
intention to commit the crime, it is immaterial as to
what part was played by whom as law as to vicarious
liability is that those who stand together, must fall
together. The question what injuries were inflicted by a
particular accused in cases to which section 34, P.P.C.
applies is immaterial, the principle underlying the
section being that where two or more persons acted
with a common intention each is liable for the act

committed as if it had been done by him alone.”

Section 34 PPC, is neither a punitive nor does enact a
rule of evidence but mainly relates to the concept of joint
liability, it simply means that if two or more persons
intentionally commit an offence jointly which amounts to as
if each of them had committed it individually. Thus, for
applicability of section 34 PPC, necessary ingredients of
common intention are the prior meeting of minds of accused
to form a pre-arranged plan and some evidence to prove that
accused in pursuance of pre-arranged plan has committed the

criminal act. The real concept of the section 34 of PPC is that
if two or more persons intentionally do an act jointly, the
position in law is just the same as if each of them has done it
individually by himself. One should not forget that section 34
does not speak “the common intentions of all” nor does it
speak ‘an intention common to all”. Under the provisions of
Section 34 the essence of the liability is to found in the
existence of a common intention animating the accused
leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such
intention. To prove the charge of common intention, the
prosecution has to establish by evidence, whether direct or
circumstantial, that there was plan or meeting of minds of all
the accused persons to commit the offence for which they are
charged with the aid of Section 34, be its pre-arranged or on
the spur of the moment; but it must necessarily be before the
commission of the crime. In the present case, it is established
from the record that the appellant had arrived to the scene of
occurrence with deadly weapon along with convicted
co-accused and made firing at the deceased which fact has
also been supported by the recovery of two empties of 8 mm
from his point as shown in the site plan, thus, the actus reus

“guilty act," and mens rea, "a guilty mind." which are the
prerequisite for the constitution of criminal behavior, are
proved against him.

12. Considering the case from all angles, we are fully
convinced that the prosecution has been successful in proving

its case against the appellant beyond any shadow of doubt,
10

therefore, this appeal is dismissed and conviction and
sentence recorded by the trial court is maintained.
