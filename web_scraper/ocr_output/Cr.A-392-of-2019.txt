Benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C was
extended to the appellant and both the substantial
sentences were ordered to run concurrently.

2. Complainant Sultan Zarin, who ‘was
present with the dead body of his daughter Mst.
Halima Bibi aged about 24/25 years, has lodged the
report on 25.06.2018 at 18:30 hours stating that his
daughter named above was married to Niazbar Said
son of Said Rehman resident of village Ranzra some
5/6 years ago; since the days of her marriage her
husband and other in-laws were at daggers drawn
with her and they used to beat her, in this regard he
himself had convened several Jirgas with Niazbar
Said and other inmates of his house. The
complainant further stated in his report that on the
same day at 16:30 hours, brother-in-law of her
daughter namely Anwar Badshah (the present
appellant) telephonically informed -him to make
arrangements for carrying the dead body of his
daughter as she had died due to falling near her
house. On receipt of such information, he rushed to
the place of occurrence and found his daughter Mst.
Halima Bibi laying there dead. He examined the
injuries on the body of deceased as well as the place

of occurrence but could not find any such place from

os: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ishtiag [brahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
TajamuyPs*

-3-

which a person could sustain the same injuries due
to falling. He expressed his satisfaction and belief
before police that his daughter has been murdered
cold bloodedly by the present appellant and his

father Said Rehman, the acquitted co-accused.

3. Sherin Zada SI (PW-7), who had
visited the spot on receipt of information regarding
the occurrence, recorded the above report of the
complainant in shape of Murasila which was sent to
police station where formal FIR was registered
against the appellant and his acquitted co-accused on
the basis of Murasila. PW-7 also prepared injury
sheet and inquest report of the deceased and sent the
dead body to civil hospital Bebiawar for postmortem
which was conducted by Dr. Saima Naurin Nazir

(PW-16). The relevant findings she incorporated in

the postmortem report are as under:

4. The appellant and his father/co-accused
were arrested on 27.06.2018. During investigation,
they made pointation of the place of occurrence and
a blood-stained axe as crime weapon was also
recovered on pointation of the present appellant. On
09.07.2018, police also produced minor daughter of
the deceased namely Habiba before the Judicial
Magistrate concerned and recorded her statement
ws 164, Cr.P.C wherein she charged the present
appellant for committing murder of the deceased
through blow of axe on her head. Similarly, blood-

stained earth was also collected from the spot

Tolamuyese|

oe: Hon'ble Mr, Justice tshtlag [brahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiger Ahmad
TajamuyPs*

besides blood-stained garments of the deceased
were taken into possession. The matching FSL
report regarding blood on the afore-mentioned

articles is Ex.PK/1.

5. After completion of investigation,
complete  challan was put in Court. On
commencement of trial they were formally charge
sheeted for the offence, however, they did not plead
guilty and opted to face the trial. In order to further
substantiate its case against the accused, prosecution
produced and examined as many as sixteen out of
twenty-six PWs listed in the calendar of witnesses
whereas the remaining were abandoned. On closure
of prosecution evidence, the accused were examined
ws 342, Cr.P.C, but they once again denied the
allegations of prosecution and stated to have been
charged in a false case, however, they neither
recorded their own statements on oath nor recorded
any evidence in their defence. On conclusion of trial,
the learned trial Court vide impugned judgment
acquitted co-accused Said Rehman while convicted
and sentenced the present appellant in the manner
already stated above, hence, this appeal.

6. We have heard the arguments of learned
counsels for the parties including the learned
Assistant A.G. for State and perused the record with

their able assistance.

Z As per contents of the FIR, the
prosecution version is that the present appellant
committed murder of his sister-in-law Mst. Halima
Bibi through violence in jungle/thoroughfare
situated in the area of village Ranzra, District Dir
Upper. Although complainant had also charged co-
accused Said Rehman, father of the present
appellant, for commission of the offence, however,
the learned trial Court has acquitted the said co-
accused through the impugned judgment and no
appeal has been filed against his acquittal, therefore,
we would confine our discussion only to the

allegation of murder against the present appellant.

Prosecution has examined minor
daughter of the deceased namely Habiba (PW-10)
aged 06 years as the sole eye witness of the
occutrence. The learned trial Court, while convicting
the present appellant,.has mainly relied upon the
testimony of this witness coupled with other

circumstantial evidence on record. However, she

DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice ishtiag Ibrahim
being a child witness and examined belatedly in the
case, her testimony needs to be scrutinized with

great care and caution.

3. The first question which pricks our
mind regarding reliability of the said child witness is
with regard to her introduction as eye witness in the
case at a belated stage. As per record, the occurrence
took place on 25.06.2018 at unknown time whereas
the minor witness was examined u/s 164, Cr.P.C
before the concerned Judicial Magistrate on
09.07.2018, after 14 days of the occurrence.
According to her admission in cross-examination,
she had told the entire story to her maternal
grandfather (complainant) at evening time, which
was most probably the evening on the day of
occurrence but despite this she was not associated
with the process of investigation from the very
inception. Prosecution has never explained with
reasons non-association of the child witness with
investigation from the initial stage nor her
examination u/s 164, Cr.P.C at a belated stage has
been justified with reasons. We have no doubt
regarding innocence of the child witness but on the

other hand we cannot ignore the possibility that she

oa: Hon'ble Mr, tustice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr Justice Wioar Ahmed
Tajamul/Ps*

was associated with the case by complainant and
police as a false eye witness of the occurrence and
this possibility is substantiated by her emergence in
the case after 14 days of the occurrence. It is by now
well settled that belated examination of a witness
without plausible explanation annuls his credibility,
therefore, testimony of the minor PW in this case in
view of her belated introduction as eye witness of
the occurrence cannot be considered as genuine.

Reliance in this regard is placed on’ the judgment in

the case titled Abdul Khaliq Vs. The State (1996

SCMR 1553) wherein the august Supreme Court has

observed that:

Nazar Hussain P.W.7, who investigated the
case as Naib-Tehsildar, deposed that he
recorded the F.I.R. on 1-7-1991 while
statements of Mir Qalam and Abdul Qahir
were recorded on 21-7-1991. In his cross-
examination Nazar Hussain stated that
statements of Abdul Jabbar and Muhammad
Shah were recorded on 4-8-1991 when they
were brought by the complainant. He
admitted that all the eye-witnesses were
examined at the instance of the complainant.
There is no explanation furnished by the
_ prosecution for examination of Mir Qalam
after 20 days of the incident and for
examination of Abdul Jabbar and
Muhammad Shah after one month and three
days of the incident. It is a settled position of
law that late recording of 161, Cr.P.C.
statement of a prosecution witness reduces its

0B: Hon’bte Mr. tustice ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon‘bie Mr, fustiee Wigar Ahmad
value to nil unless there is plausible
explanation for such delay.

In the case of Muhammad Asif Vs. The
State (2017 SCMR 486), the Hon’ble apex Court
has held that unexplained delay of even one or two
days in recording the statement of eye witnesses
would be fatal and testimony of such witnesses

could not be safely relied upon.

9. Since the edifice of the prosecution case

mainly rests on the testimony of the child eye

' witness, as such, her legal status as a witness and

Tajamul/Ps*

thereafter the evidentiary value of her testimony on
the factual aspects of the occurrence need

determination by this Court.

The criteria for competency of a person
to testify has been laid down in Article 3 of the

Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 which reads:

3. Who may testify: A persons shall be
competent to testify unless the Court considers
that they are prevented from understanding the
questions put to them, or from giving rational
answers to those questions, by tender years,
extreme old age, disease, whether of body or
mind or-any other cause of the same kind:

Provided that a person shall not be
competent to testify if he has been convicted by
a Court for perjury or giving false evidence:

. Provided further that the provisions of
the first proviso shall not apply to a person
about whom the Court is satisfied that he has
repented thereafter and mended his ways:

OB: Hon'ble Mr. tustice Ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon'bte Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamul/Ps* |

-10-

Provided further that the Court shall
determine the competence of a witness in
accordance with the qualifications prescribed by
the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the
Holy Qur'an and Sunnah for a witness, and.
where such witness is not forthcoming the Court
may take the evidence of a witness who may be
available. Explanation: A lunatic is not
incompetent to testify unless he is prevented by
his lunacy from understanding the questions put
to him and giving rational answers to them.

From bare reading of the above
provision, it can easily be gathered that evidence of
a witness cannot be rejected because of his age
factor rather the test of competency of a witness is
his capacity to understand the questions and to give
rational answers. However, the superior Courts have
always laid more stress to remain on guard while
convicting an accused on the sole testimony of a
child witness. The reason behind such precaution is
that children, as observed by Lahore High Court in
the case of Amir Khan and others Vs. The State
(PLD 1985 Lahore 18), are the most untrustworthy
class of witnesses because in view of their tender
age they often mistake dreams for reality, repeat
glibly as of their own knowledge what they have
heard from others, and are greatly influenced by fear
of punishment, by hope of reward and by desire of

notoriety. When the issue before the Court is to

8: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’bie Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamut/Ps*

-ll-

determine guilt or innocericé of an accused on the
basis of sole testimony of a child witness then more
care and caution is required to be taken and the same
evidence should not be considered unless
corroborated by circumstantial evidence on record.
Reliance in this regard is placed on State through

Advocate-General, Sindh, Karachi_Vs._Farman

Hussain and others reported as PLD 1995 S.C 1,
wherein the august Supreme Court, while making
reference to Farman Ali’s case supra, observed that:

Evidence of child witness is a delicate matter
and normally it is not safe to rely upon it
unless corroborated as rule of prudence. Great
care is to be taken that in the evidence of child
element of coaching is not involved. Evidence
of child came up for examination before
Division Bench of the High Court in the case of
Amir Khan and others v. The State PLD 1985
Lah. 18 in which after consideration of the
relevant case-law on the subject, Abdul
Shakurul Salam, J. (as he then was) as author
of the judgment observed that ‘children are a
most untrustworthy class of witnesses, for,
when of tender age, as our common experience
teaches us, they often mistake dreams for
reality, repeat glibly as of their own knowledge
what they have heard from others and are
greatly influenced by fear of punishment, by
hope of reward and the desire of notoriety". In
any case the rule of prudence requires that the
testimony of child witness should not be relied
upon unless it is corroborated by some
evidence on the record.

0B: Hon’bte Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrahien
Honbte Mr, Justice Wiosr Ahmad
-12-

: Although no hard and fast rule could be
laid down to determine as to whether a child is a
competent “witness or not and ascertaining the
intelligence of a child witness depends upon the
facts and circumstances of each case, however, we
cannot shut | our eyes from the precautions so
highlighted by the superior Courts before
considering the evidence of the child witness in the
present case. What the law requires before taking
into account the testimony of a child witness is to
confirm that the child understands the questions and
on the basis of his/her intellectual capacity and
understanding he/she is able to give a rational
account of the matter regarding which such witness

steps into the witness box.

10. By analyzing the testimony of the child
witness in the present case on the touchstone of
' Article 3 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 as
well as the afore-referred dicta, it can safely be held
that her testimony gets no corroboration from the
circumstantial evidence on record. As per statement
of the child witness, the appellant had hit her mother
inside the room of her residential house which is not

the case of prosecution at all because after

OB: Hon'ble Mr. tustice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’bte Mr ustice Wigar Ahmad
Talamul/Ps* |

-13-

examination of the witness u/s 161/164, CrP, the
1.0 neither prepared site plan of the house in view of
the new development in the case in light of the
child’s statement nor collected any incriminating
evidence from the said house except recovery of axe
as the alleged crime weapon the evidentiary status
whereof is also doubtful which will be discussed
later on at proper stage of this judgment. According
to initial version of prosecution, the appellant and
his co-accused committed murder of the deceased at
Point-1 of the site plan through violence and
thereafter threw and dragged her downward to Point
A] shown near the public thoroughfare. After arrest
of the accused, the I.0 made addition in the site plan
with red ink in light of pointation of the accused and
they were shown at Points 4 & 6 respectively
whereas minor son of the deceased namely Wisal,
who was in her lap at the time of occurrence, was
given Point 5 in the site plan. According to
prosecution in light of pointation so made by
accused, the present appellant hit the deceased with
axe from Point 4 as result whereof the kid fell from
her lap on Point 5 whereas she herself fell downward

for 18/19 feet and died on the spot. Prosecution has

DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice tshtlag (brahim.
-14-

_remained persistent on this version till the last and it

Tetamut/Ps*|

appears that in light of the version of accused
emerging from the FIR, police were in doubt
regarding death of the deceased due to falling from
height, as such, the mode and manner of the
occurrence as mentioned in the site plan was
believed as sufficient circumstantial evidence
against the accused and no further investigation was
conducted in the case in light of examination of the
child witness u/s 161/164, Cr.P.C. Perusal of the
record further transpires that formal charge against
the accused has been framed in light of the said
version of prosecution wherein the place of
occurrence was shown the thoroughfare mentioned
in the site plan and no reference was made to the
allegation of hitting of the deceased by the present
appellant inside the room of his house. Even during
examination of the appellant u/s 342, Cr.P.C, he was
not confronted with the mode and manner of the
occurrence as narrated by the child eye witness
during trial. But contrary to the above stated basic
version of the prosecution and despite the fact that
the actual place of occurrence had become

controversial rather doubtful in view of the glaring

op: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ishtiag (brahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wicer Ahmad
-15-

inconsistency between the site plan and statement of
the child witness, the learned trial Court has
straightaway relied upon her statement without
seeking independent corroboration of her testimony.
The learned trial Court is of the view, as emerging

from the last portion of Para-16 of the impugned

‘ judgment, that the present appellant committed

Topmuyes*|

murder of the deceased through axe blows inside the
house of her in-laws and thereafter dragged her to
the nearby jungle, however, at the cost of repetition,
no corroborative evidence of convincing nature is
available on record in support of the above findings
of learned trial Court. The I.0 has not shown the
house in the site plan wherein the murder was
committed as per version of the child eye witness.
Similarly, blood was only recovered from point 1A
from where the dead body was recovered whereas a
piece of human skin was recovered from point 1B.
Both the mentioned points have been shown in the
jungle. The astonishing fact is that police raided the
house of appellant on the second day of the
occurrence ie 26.06.2018 and a shotgun was
allegedly recovered from his residential room but

neither any blood was recovered from the house nor

0B: Hon'ble Mr. Justice tshtiag Ibrahim
Hon‘ble Mr Justice Wicar Ahmad
-16-

police has reported any disturbance inside the house.
Even the said house was raided for the second time
on 27.06.2018. This time the accused were arrested
besides a bundle/pack hanging with the wall,
containing CNISs of the deceased and appellant, was
taken into possession but even then nothing
favourable to prosecution in light of the child’s
statement was recovered from the said house. We
cannot expect the police that they will not have
searched the room of deceased at the time of raiding
the house on two consecutive days. It is also

noteworthy that floor of the house in photograph

_Ex.PW-12/11 appears to be made of mud. Removal

Tajarnul/PS* |

of blood from such like floors through washing is
not so easy as in the case of cemented one. It is a
matter of general observation that blood from a mud
floor cannot be completely removed and signs of
disturbance on such floor are always left behind
wheriever any endeavor is made for removal of
blood from mud floor through washing, rubbing or
digging but the entire record is mute regarding any
such signs inside the, room of the deceased to
support the statement of the child witness.

Prosecution has placed on file a copy of daily

DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag brahim
Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
-17-

attendance of students of the school where the child
witness was studying. According to the said
photocopy Ex.PW-12/16, the child witness was

present in school on 25.06.2016 and she had spent

the time there from 07:30 a.m to 12:35 p.m as per

Tajemuyse|

certificate Ex.PW-12/18 issued by Head Teacher of
the said school regarding the school hours in
summer. When no corroborative evidence of.
convincing nature is available on record in support
of the child eye witness, her narrations that the
appellant had given her Rs.10 after hitting her
mother with axe and she then left for school, appears
to be a cooked up story for bringing her statement in
conformity with school record. It can safely be held
from the above mentioned scenario of the case that
not only whatever the child eye witness has stated
before the Court was put into her mouth but her
statement is also not corroborated by circumstantial
evidence on record, therefore, her testimony is not
worth consideration. We are conscious of the fact
that cause of death of the- deceased as per
postmortem report was due to injury to the brain
with heavy cutting weapon but this report by itself is

not sufficient to prove the mode and manner of the

OB: Hon'ble Mr, Justice tshtlag Ibrahim
Tojamulrse|

-18-

occurrence as mentioned by the child eye witness in
her statement, hence, her testimony does not get the
required corroboration from the medical evidence on
record. Further reliance is placed on Ulfat Hussain
Vs. The State (2010 SCMR_247). The august
Supreme Court has observed in the said judgment

that:

12. We would like to observe that though in
principle conviction can be based upon the
testimony of an intelligent and understanding
child witness yet the Courts have generally
preferred to adopt the settled principle of
prudence and the rule of care attached to the
sole testimony of a child witness despite child's
intelligent disposition. We may however,
reiterate that the measure of prudence or the
level of care would depend upon facts of each
case,
il. Another aspect of the case creating a
doubt regarding the statement of the eye witness is
that her minor brother Wisal also sustained multiple
abrasions and scratches on his both cheeks, forehead
and buttock in the same occurrence as is evident
from medical report Ex.PW15/1, prepared by Dr.
Ata-ul-Haq (PW-15) after examining the said kid
after three days of the occurrence. According to the

contents of site plan, the kid fell from the lap of

deceased on Point 5 when she was hit by appellant

DB: Hon'ble Mr. tustice Ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Wioae Ahmad
-19-

in the uneven land of the jungle. Sustaining bruises
and scratches by the kid in the mentioned place
being uneven and slope stands to reason but on the
other hand prosecution, in light of the statement of
the child witness, has . changed the place of

occurrence from jungle to residential room of the

deceased where though falling of the kid from the

lap of her mother was certain but coming of multiple
abrasions and scratches on his both cheeks, forehead
and buttock in a room is repellent to reason. After
analyzing the entire evidence on record, we have
reached to the conclusion that prosecution itself is
not sure regarding the actual place of occurrence,
hence, the mode and manner of the occurrence is
highly doubtful. In such situation we do not find
ourselves in agreement with the findings of learned
trial Court on the basis whereof the appellant has

been convicted.

12. Regarding the recovery of blood-stained
axe on pointation of the appellant, we have already
observed in the preceding paras that police had
searched the house of appellant twice on 26.06.2018
and 27.06.2018 but no axe was recovered during the

two raids on the mentioned dates. According to

Tajarnul/Ps* |

08: Hon'ble Mr. fustice Ishtlag Ibrahim =~
Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Winer Ahmed
@)

Tofamuyese|

-20-

prosecution version, police recovered the blood-
Stained axe on pointation of the present appellant on
30.06.2018 from veranda of his ‘house. Close perusal
of the sketch of recovery Ex.PW-12/10 and
photograph Ex.PW-12/ i shows that the alleged
recovery has been effected from point A which is the
end point of veranda and the axe has been shown at
corner of the wall meaning thereby that the axe was
placed openly in the veranda. How was it possible
for police to lose sight of such an important thing
placed openly in the veranda more particularly when
they were so cautious and vigilant that they did not
leave even a baggage unattended which was hanging
with a wall. Similarly, the stance of prosecution that
the appellant had placed the axe stained with blood
at the mentioned place after committing the murder,
also does not appeal to prudent mind and it cannot
be expected from a person of ordinary prudence to
leave a sign of his involvement in a crime so
conspicuously in his house. Thus, the recovery of
axe from the house of appellant on his pointation is
highly doubtful, hence, cannot be considered as a
convincing evidence in corroboration of the

statement recorded by the child eye witness.

13. The prosecution case is suffering from
glaring inconsistencies and infirmities creating
serious doubts regarding the mode and manner of
the occurrence as well as involvement of the present

appellant in commission of the offence. The learned

’ trial Court, while convicting the appellant, has not

Oe

appreciated the evidence in its true perspective,
therefore, the impugned judgment cannot be
maintained. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed, the
impugned judgment is set aside and appellant is
acquitted of the charge so leveled against him in this
case. He be released forthwith from jail if not

required in any other case.

14. Above are the reasons of our short order

of the even date.
