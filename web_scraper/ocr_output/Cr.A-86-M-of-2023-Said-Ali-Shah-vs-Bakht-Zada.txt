or in default of payment of fine, he shall further

of Rs. 300,000/-, payable to the respondent/

{S.B.) Hon’ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
4;

complainant, U/S 544-A, Cr.P.C. and he was also
extended the benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. The
local police/Administration were directed to restore
possession of the disputed property to the
respondent/complainant. The co-accused, Mian Said
Tahir alias Taghir was declared proclaimed offender
and proceedings U/S, 512 Cr.P.C were initiated
against him.

2. In short compass, the case of
respondent/complainant is that he filed a complaint
U/S 3 of Act 2005 to the effect he is owner by
purchase of the disputed property vide mutation
dated 05.05.2005, which was purchased by him from
wife of co-accused Mian Said Tahir i.e. Mst.
Mastoria and since then he is in possession of the
same. It was further alleged that the accused-party
comprising of the present appellant, Said Ali Shah
and one Mian Said Tahir alias Tagir were influential
people of the locality, whereas, the
respondent/complainant at present is settled in Saudi
Arabia, therefore, the accused are taking advantage

of his absence and have illegally occupied the

{S.8.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
4)

disputed property, as such, the matter was reported
to the local police, but to no avail.

3. When the instant complaint was filed,
accused were summoned, challan was drawn and was
sent up for trial to the learned trial Court. Accused
was confronted with the statement of allegations
through formal charge-sheet to which he pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial.

4, To substantiate the guilt of the accused,
the prosecution furnished its account consist of the
statements of five (05) witnesses. The accused was
confronted to the evidence so furnished through
statements of accused within the meaning of section
342 Cr.P.C.

5. On conclusion of the trial, in view of the
evidence so recorded and the assistance so rendered by
the learned counsel for the accused and learned
counsel for the complainant/learned Public Prosecutor,
the learned trial Court arrived at the conclusion that in
view of the evidence so recorded and assistance so
provided, allegations against the accused are doubtful
and case against the accused/respondents is tinted with

doubts, as such, by extending the benefit of doubt, the

{S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
acquittal of the respondents/accused was recorded

accordingly.

6. It obliged the appellant/complainant to
approach this Court through criminal appeal No. 277-
M/2021, which was allowed by this Court vide
order/judgment dated 01.11.2022 and the case was
remanded back to the learned trial Court with the

following directions; -

“Accordingly, with the concurrence of both the learned
counsels for the parties, this appeal is allowed and
“2? oO consequently the impugned order and judgment of the
learned trial Court dated 05.10.2021 is set aside and the

ie case is remanded back to the learned trial Court who after

hearing both the parties shall re-write the judgment keeping
in view the evidence recorded by the parties and as per the
mandate of the provisions of The Illegal Dispossession Act,
2005. Order accordingly.

7. After remand, the learned trial
Court/Additional Sessions Judge, Matta, Swat, vide
the impugned order/judgment dated, 07.03.2023
convicted & sentenced the accused/appellant, Said Ali
Shah, as highlighted in the opening Para of this

judgment.

8. It obliged the appellant/accused to
approach this Court through the subject criminal

appeal.

9, Arguments of learned counsel for the

parties as well as learned Astt: A.G for the State have

(S.8.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
been heard and the record gone through with their

valuable assistance.

N

10. Surely, under the theme & scheme of

Act of 2005, the trial Court who is seized of a

complaint U/S 8 (1) of the ibid Act can restore

possession to a complainant without awarding the
punishment of imprisonment and after taking

cognizance U/S 4, Act of 2005 and after preliminary
investigation as required U/S 5, the trial Court if

o considered can attach the property U/S 6 of the Act.
Se Similarly, the trial Court as an interim arrangement
can also evict a trespasser or an illegal occupier from

the disputed property and hand it over to a
complainant U/S 7, Act of 2005. Likewise, after

conclusion of the trial, the learned trial Court under

the theme of Illegal Dispossession Act can punish

the nominated accused for a period of ten years U/S

8 (1) of Act 2005 if the Court found that an owner or

occupier of the property was illegally dispossessed

then he can issue direction to the nominated accused

to restore the possession of the property to an owner

or occupier. Sections 6,7 & 8 of the aforesaid Act

{8.8.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
being relevant for the present controversy, which are

reproduced below:-

6. Power to attach property.- (1) If the

Court is satisfied that none of the persons
are in possession immediately before the
commission of the offence, the Court may
attach the property until final decision of
the case.

(2) In case of attachment, the methods of
its management, safeguard against natural
decay or deterioration shall be determined
by the Court.

7. Eviction_and_mode of recovery _as an
interim relief.- (1) If during trial the Court

is satisfied that a person is found prima
facie to be not in lawful possession, the
Court shall, as an interim relief direct him
to put the owner or occupier, as the case
may be, in possession.

(2) Where the person against whom any
such order is passed under subsection (1)
fails to comply with the same, the Court
Shall, notwithstanding any other law for
the time being in force, take such steps and
pass such order as may be necessary to put
the owner or occupier in possession.

(3) The Court may authorize any official
or officer to take possession for securing
compliance with its orders under
subsection (1). The person so authorized
may use or cause to be used such force as
may be necessary.

(4) If any person, authorized by the Court,
under subsection (3), requires police
assistance in the exercise of his power
under this Act, he may send a requisition
to the officer-in-charge of a police station
who shall on such requisition render such
assistance as may be required.

(5) The failure of the officer-in-charge of
police station to render assistance under
subsection (4) shall amount to misconduct
for which the Court may direct
departmental action against him.

8. Delivery of possession of property to

owner, etc.- (1) On conclusion of trial, if
the Court finds that an owner or occupier
of the property was illegally dispossessed
or property was grabbed in contravention
of section 3, the Court may, at the time of

(S.8.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
passing order under subsection (2) of that
section, direct the accused or any person
claiming through him for restoration of
the possession of the property to the owner
or, as the case may be, the occupier, if not
already restored to him under section 7.
(2) For the purpose of subsection (1), the
Court may, where it is required, direct the
officer-in-charge of the police station for
such assistance as may be required for
restoration of the possession of the
property to the owner or, as the case may
be, the occupier.

The aforesaid provisions of law would
unmistakably show that proceedings under the
aforesaid Act are quasi-criminal & quasi-civil. The
provisions of the Act are distinguishable from a
Court who is seized of other criminal cases like
murder, hurt and theft etc as the trial Court who is
seized of a complaint U/S 3 of the Act can attach the
property, it can as an interim arrangement evict an
accused/person from the disputed property and hand
it over to a complainant and even on the conclusion
of the trial it can restore possession to the
complainant, however, such powers are not available
to the trial Court who are conducting proceedings of
other kinds of criminal cases like murder, hurt and
theft etc, therefore, the proceedings under the Act
could not be stricto-senso said to be that of exclusive

criminal proceedings as compared to other kind of

(8.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
criminal cases where an attorney could not act as a
complainant or as a witness on behalf of his

principal.

11. In view of the aforesaid yardstick, it is

case of respondent/complainant, Bakht Zada, as

highlighted in his complaint, that he has been illegally

& forcibly dispossessed by the accused, Said Ali Shah,

(the appellant herein) and absconding co-accused Mian

Said Tahir from the disputed property bearing khasra

e No. 3503, measuring 02 kanals & 10 marlas. It was
ae further alleged by respondent/complainant that the
disputed property was purchased by him from wife of

co-accused, Mian Said Tahir i.e. Mst. Mastoria vide

mutation deed dated 05.05.2005.

12. As against this, the appellant/accused not
only in his statement recorded U/S 342 Cr.P.C
vehemently denied the allegations of the respondent/
complainant but he also opted to produce evidence in
his own defence within the meaning of section 340 (2)
Cr.P.C and examined Ibrahim Shah as DW-1, Mati
Ullah as DW-2 & Sher-ul-Haq as DW-3, who have

fully supported the case of appellant/accused coupled

(S.B.} Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
with his claim with respect of the ownership &

possession of the disputed property.

13. A bare look of the contents of complaint
would transpire that the respondent/complainant has
not complained of any specific occurrence in terms
of time and date as well as mode & manner of the
occurrence regarding the  dispossession or
interference in his lawful possession. The non-
mentioning of the date & time of the alleged
dispossession gained much more significance, when
PW-3, Ikram Ullah Khan has stated in his cross-
examination as under; -

“It is correct that the landed property was never in
possession and use of the complainant”

Same was the case of PW-2, Sherin
Zada, who has made alike statement in the following
words; -

“That it is correct that respondent No. 2 (the appellant
herein) had constructed walls & DPC over the property”

The respondent/complainant when
appeared in the Court as PW-1, he has also admitted
in his cross-examination the existence of walls &
DPC over the disputed property, from the last 16

years, therefore, the alleged plea of respondent/

(S.8.) Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
5

-10-

complainant with respect to his lawful possession is
prima facie not above the aboard. In the case of

“Ghulam Ali _v/;_Abu Bakar” reported as 2019

MLD 1163, the Sindh High Court has held that;-

That in order to maintain conviction under S.3 of Hlegal
Dispossession Act, 2005, complainant must establish either
illegal dispossession by means of unauthorized entry into or
upon disputed property or by proving forcible or wrongful
possession and any failure or a reasonable dent in such
proof would be sufficient for acquittal by extending benefit
of doubt.

Similarly, the in the case of “Khadim

Ali_v/s Hakim Ali & another” reported as 202]

YLR_1556, the Sindh High Court has also observed
that;-

The descriptions and boundaries of the said areas from the
survey numbers allegedly purchased by the complainant
were nowhere mentioned either in the complaint or even in
the evidence led by the prosecution and thus, the identity of
the subject land could not be made.

14, Other than the above, prima facie the
lawful ownership and possession of the respondent/
complainant qua the disputed property is standing in
vacuum, as it was his case that he purchased the
disputed property from the wife of the co-accused,
Mst. Mastoria through mutation dated 05.05.2005,
however, it is also part of the record that the said
Mst. Mastoria filed a civil suit before the competent
Court of law challenging therein the aforesaid sale

mutation.

(S.B.} Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan

15. In view of the above lacunas existed in
the evidence so furnished by the respondent/
complainant, benefit of the same has to be extended
to the appellant/accused at least in terms of his
conviction under the aforesaid Act of 2005. Even
otherwise, the issue of handing over possession of
the disputed property to the respondent/complainant
has already been settled through the impugned
order/judgment, whereby it was specifically directed
to local Administration/S.H.O to restore possession
of the disputed property to the respondent/
complainant within a period of one month.

16. In view of the above, the instant
criminal appeal is disposed of in terms that the
conviction and sentence awarded to the appellant,
Said Ali Shah is maintained, however, his sentence
is reduced to the period already undergone by him in
the Jail. Findings in the judgment of learned trial
Court in respect of payment of fine & compensation
is set aside. The impugned judgment of learned trial
Court dated 07.03.2023 is modified to the above

extent.

(S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
17. The appellant has already been released
on bail by this Court, U/S 426 Cr.P.C on 21.03.2023,
therefore, his sureties are discharged from liability of

the bail bonds.
