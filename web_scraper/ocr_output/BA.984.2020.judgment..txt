IKRAMULLAH KHAN, _J:- Through the instant bail

petition, petitioner Bawar Khan seeks his release on bail in
case FIR No. 1318 dated 10.12.2018, registered under Sections
302/148/149/427/109 PPC, at Police Station Jabbar, District
Mardan, on fresh ground of medical and infirmity till final
decision of the case.

2. As per prosecution case, petitioner alongwith co-
accused Kishwar, Jamshed and Ali Bahadar were charged by
complainant Akhtar Hameed for effective firing at his father
Noor Hameed and brother Khalid Hameed, who were on
motorcycle ahead of complainant and PW. Tariq Hameed,

coming to their village, as a result of which they were hit and
died on the spot. Consequently, on the report of complainant
present case was registered against all the accused.

3. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and
gone through the available record.

4, Perusal of record reveals that the prayer of
petitioner for bail on merit has already been dismissed up to
this Court who has now approached this Court on fresh ground
of medical and infirmity for his release on bail.

5. So far as the ground of infirmity taken by learned
defence counsel is concerned, admittedly this ground was
taken by petitioner in his previous bail petition (Cr.MBA
No.1491-P/2019) before this Court, which was dismissed by
this Court vide order dated 24.6.2019, so the petitioner cannot
take this plea again which has already been refused by this
Court.

6. Now coming to the other ground (medical) on
which the petitioner has prayed for his release on bail, as per
record, on the application of petitioner submitted before the
learned trial Court, he was referred to the Standing Medical
Board, who after examination of the petitioner, opined that the
treatment of petitioner can be carried out in the jail premises,

so when there is no threat to his life in jail and proper

treatment is available to him in jail premises, then he cannot be
granted bail on medical ground. Moreover, the petitioner has
availed all the grounds including merit, medical and infirmity,
which were declined upto this Court therefore, no good fresh
ground is available to the petitioner which could be made a
ground for his release on bail. Besides, trial of petitioner has
commenced and numerous witnesses have been examined
while a few witnesses are yet to be examined but the case is
lingering on due to numerous bail applications submitted by
petitioner and co-accused in different Courts on one pretext or
other, which caused delay in conclusion of trial. Consequently,
this bail petition on the plea of infirmity and medical ground is
dismissed. However, the learned trial Court is directed to
conclude the trial expeditiously by treating it as a target case
on day to day basis and no unnecessary adjournment should be
granted. The prosecution/ complainant is directed to produce
its remaining witnesses and petitioner is also directed to
ensure attendance of his counsel before the learned trial Court
for cross examination of the witnesses so that the trial could be
concluded expeditiously.

Announced: a
06.05.2020.
