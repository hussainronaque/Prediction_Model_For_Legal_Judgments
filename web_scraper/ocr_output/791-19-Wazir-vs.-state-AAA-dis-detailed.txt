JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- Mst. Sakina Bibi,

who was wife of the complainant Sanab Gul, and a
stranger, namely, Rauf Shah, were done to death on the
night of the 12% October, 2017, for which he
(complainant) lodged a report in a emergency room of
Civil Hospital, Hangu. He stated in his report that on the
eventful night, he along with his wife Mst. Sakina Bibi
was sleeping in the veranda of his house, when at 03.10
hours, Rauf Shah son of Khial Wazir entered into his
house with evil intention. He woke up on hue and cry and
in the meantime his nephews, namely, Jabir and Dilber
came, who overpowered Rauf Shah and locked him in the
room, thereafter, Jabir took out his pistol and made firing
at his wife and Rauf Shah with which they both sustained
injuries. The occurrence was stated to be witnessed by

inmates of the house. The report of the complainant was
reduced into writing in shape of murasilla, Exh. PA, and
on the basis of which case FIR No. 1007 was registered
against both the accused under section 324/34 PPC at
Police Station, City Hangu, on 12.10.2017. Later on, both
the injured succumbed to their injuries and, accordingly, a
case under section 302 PPC was registered against them.
2. After registration of the case, investigation was
entrusted to Ali Ahmad Khan Inspector (PW-12), who
visited the spot and prepared the site plan, Exh.PB, at the
instance of complainant. During spot inspection, he
collected blood through cotton and three empties of .30
mm bore from the spot and took the same vide recovery
memo Exh.PW 8/1. He also took into possession blood
stained garments of both the deceased, vide memo
Exh. PW 7/2. On the arrest of both the accused, they were
produced before learned Judicial Magistrate, where they
recorded their confessional statements. He also sent the
pistol, recovered from personal possession of accused
Dilber Jan, and empties to the FSL and its report is
Exh.PZ/1.

3. After completion of investigation, the accused-
respondents were sent to the court of learned Additional
Sessions Judge-I, Hangu, for trial, who, on its conclusion,
vide judgment dated 30.05.2019, recorded their acquittal,

hence, the instant appeal.
4. Learned counsel for the appellant contended that
sufficient evidence against the accused-respondents in
shape of their direct nomination in the FIR, promptly
lodged by their uncle/complainant, retracted judicial
confessions, medical evidence, recovery of weapon of
offence, three empties from the spot and its matching
report coupled with venue of occurrence, which
exclusively ruled out the hypothesis of their innocence but
the learned trial court due to misreading and non-reading
of evidence acquitted them, while, on the other hand,
learned counsel for the accused-respondents contended
that it was a blind and unseen occurrence, took place in
the pitch dark and odd hours of the night, entirely hinges
on circumstantial evidence, thus, not forming a chain to
connect the accused-respondents and findings of the
learned trial court being in line with the principles laid
down by the superior courts for appraisal of evidence in
criminal cases, thus, not open to any exception.

5. We have considered arguments of learned counsel
for the parties and gone through record of the case.

6. From the record the homicidal death of both the
deceased, Mst. Sakina Bibi and Rauf Shah, has been
established from the statements of lady Dr. Naeelab
(PW-2) and Dr. Mubarak Khan (PW-6) rather this fact
was not disputed by the defence counsel and the question

before the Court is as to whether it was the respondents-
accused, who committed murder of the deceased or
otherwise. Perusal of the record would reveal that the
accused-respondents, no doubt, have been charged by the
complainant in his first report but when he appeared
before the Court as PW-4, he entirely deviated from the
story as narrated by him in his report. He stated in his
examination in chief that on the eventful night, he was
sleeping in his house and had taken tranquilizer and on
hearing the fire shots, he got up, found man and a woman
lying in injured condition and, thereafter, the police came
to his house, who took the injured along with him to the
hospital where the female succumbed to the injuries while
the male injured succumbed to his injury at Peshawar. He
stated that one Shah Ayaz Councilor, the relative of male
deceased Rauf Shah was also present and on his direction
he lodged the report. He was declared as hostile and,
accordingly, he was cross examined by the prosecution. In
cross examination, he stated that he did not know as to
who made fire because at the time of firing he was
sleeping. He further stated that his wife was done to death
inside the room while the male deceased in the door of the
room. He admitted that he had signed the white blank
paper inside the ambulance and his identity card etc was
taken from him in the presence of Shah Ayaz Councilor.
He stated that he did not know as to what the local police

had written in the report. He further stated that site plan
was not prepared at his instance. During cross
examination, nothing was extracted from his mouth to
connect the present respondents-accused with commission
of the offence. It was held by the apex Court in a case
titled Muhammad Sadiq vs. Muhammad Sarwar etc
(1979 SCMR 214) that “now, there can be no dispute
about the proposition that as a rule of prudence, the
evidence of a hostile witness in a criminal case requires
corroboration, but the primary question in a case is not
whether the witness is a hostile witness or a disinterested
witness, but whether he is an honest witness or a dishonest
witness. Sometimes, even a hostile witness may speak the
truth, whilst a totally disinterested witness may be bribed
or pressurized into giving false evidence, therefore, if he
may be permitted to say so, the test of enmity is a rule of
thumb method for ascertaining the veracity of a witness,
and the question will always be of the veracity of the
witness, and therefore, in addition to the question whether
a witness is interested or hostile or disinterested, the
Courts should also examine the question whether the
evidence is inherently probable and whether it is
consistent with the circumstantial evidence. It is by now
established that statement of hostile witness cannot be
discarded in toto and has to be considered like the
evidence of any other witness, but with a caution.

Reliance is placed on the case titled Zahid Khan v. Gul
Sher and another (1972 SCMR 597) and Muhammad
Sadiq v. Muhammad Sarwar (1979 SCMR 214). Since
the statement of the complainant is not worthy of
credence, therefore, no reliance can be placed on his
testimony, particularly, in a case entailing capital
punishment.

7. The next piece of evidence against the accused-
respondents is their retracted judicial confessions.
Retracted judicial Confession may be treated to be
sufficient to sustain a conviction if found voluntary and
true, but as a rule of prudence, the same should not be
acted upon unless corroborated by some other reliable
evidence. For acceptance of judicial confession, two
essentials are the sine qua none, which must be fulfilled,
first that the confession was made voluntarily and was
based on true account of facts leading to the crime and,
second, the same was proved at the trial. Rel: (2017
SCMR 986). Section 164 Cr.P.C deals with the recording
of statements and confessions at any stage before the
commencement of an enquiry or trial while section 364
Cr.p.C provides the mode in which the examination of an
accused person is recorded. According to the said
provisions, the questions put to the accused and the
answers given by him should be clearly and accurately
recorded as the evidential value of a confession depends

upon its voluntary character and the accuracy with which
it is, reproduced and, hence, the section provides
safeguards to secure this end, which is of great importance
and rationale behind it is that the same are often retracted
at a later stage and it becomes necessary for the Court to
determine whether the alleged confession was actually and
voluntary made but here in the case in hand the
provisions of section 364 Cr.P.C have blatantly been
violated. The perusal of confessional statements would
reveal that in both the cases questionnaires and answers
are in printed forms, thus, all the relevant warning
allegedly communicated before recording of their
statements have been made recklessly and hastily and
without due care which aspect of the case is also evident
from the record that the accused-respondents were
arrested on 12.10.2017 while their confessional
statements were recorded on 16.10.2017, after four days
of their arrest but in both the cases in reply to question
No.3, i.e., how long have you been in police custody,
the answers are available in the printed form as “they
did not remain in custody”. Again, we have placed both
the confessional statements in juxtaposition with the
contents of FIR and found that the statements are
contradictory to the story as narrated by the prosecution.
Thus, the confessions of the respondents-accused are
neither true nor voluntary. Wisdom is derived from the

case titled Muhammad Azhar Hussain and another vs.
The State and another (PLD 2019 SC 595

Muhammad Ismail vs. the State (2017 SCMR 317), &
Azeem khan vs Mujahid Khan (2016 SCMR 274). It

has also been held by the Hon’able apex Court in the case
titled “The State vs. Minhun 1964 SCMR 813, Nadir
Hussain vs. The Crown 1969 SCMR 442 and the State
vs. Wagar Ahmad 1992 SCMR 950, that confession
whether retracted or not, as a rule of caution must be
supported by some connecting evidence, which element in
the instant case is also missing.

8. Another piece of incriminating evidence in the
account of accused-respondents is three crime empties
allegedly recovered from the spot and FSL report,
according to which the recovered empties were fired from
30 bore pistol recovered from accused-respondent Dilber,
but the same too is of no avail to the prosecution as the
complainant has stated in his cross examination that the
site plan was not prepared at his instance. The apex Court
in the case reported as 2001 SCMR 424 that site plan
loses its evidentiary value if not prepared on the pointation
of witnesses. Even otherwise, the opinion of the Expert
has a corroborative value only and is useful for
ascertaining whether the direct evidence is true or not.
Reliance is placed on case of Noor Muhammad vs. The
State 2010 SCMR 97, wherein it has been held that the

recovery of crime empty, rifle with matching report of
FSL is a corroborated piece of evidence which by itself is
not sufficient to convict the accused in the absence of
substantive evidence. Reliance is also placed on case titled
Zeeshan vs. The State 2012 SCMR 428 and Nasir
Javaid and another vs. the State 2016 SCMR 1144.

9. The last piece of evidence against the accused is
P.M reports of the deceased, which may confirm the
ocular evidence with regards to receipt of injuries, nature
of the injuries, kinds of weapon used in the commission of
offence but it would not connect the accused with the
commission of the offence. In the case titled Sajjan
Solangi vs. The State (2019 SCMR_ 872) it has been
observed by Hon’able the apex Court that medical
evidence at the most could be supporting evidence to the
ocular account but it could not identify the assailant by
itself.

10. It is established from the record that the
occurrence took place in the house of accused-
respondents, who happened to be the nephews of the
complainant. Deceased Mst. Sakina Bibi was better half of
the complainant while deceased Rauf Shah was a stranger.
Learned counsel for the appellant stressed hard that it was
the accused-respondents who committed murder of both
the deceased but on the record there is no credible
evidence which could be made basis for the conviction of

the accused-respondents. Principally, a criminal case is to
10

be decided on the basis of evidence adduced by the
prosecution and suspicion, howsoever, grave or strong
could never be a proper substitute for the standard of
proof required in a criminal case, i.e., beyond reasonable
doubt. Hon’able the apex Court of the country in a case
titled Muhammad Pervaiz vs. the State and other (PLD
2019 S C 592) observed that:-

Suspicions are after all suspicions and cannot
substitute the legal proof nor can a suspect be
condemned on the basis of moral satisfaction in
the absence of evidentiary certainty.

11. It is the bounded duty of prosecution to produce a
strong evidence even if of circumstantial nature which is
not so in the case in hand to convict a person entailing
capital punishment. Now, it is established principle of
administration of criminal justice that for the accused the
right of benefit of the doubt to be afforded and it is not
necessary that there should be many circumstances
creating uncertainty and if a single circumstance creating
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of an
accused then he shall be entitled to such benefit not as a
matter of grace and concession but as a right. We have
perused the impugned judgment and evidence available on
file and found that the learned trial court has attended to
the relevant evidence on record on its true perspective and
its findings find support from the material available on the

file.
11

12. Apart from the above, it is by now well settled that
acquittal carries double presumption of innocence and
judgment of acquittal cannot be set aside unless is
perverse, ridiculous, artificial and _ resulting into
miscarriage of justice but here in the instant case, no such
element has been pointed out on behalf of learned counsel
for the appellant. Reliance is placed on the case titled
2014 SCMR 479, 2019 SCMR 1045 and 2019 SCMR
1315. Thus, in view of above of above discussion, we hold
that the view taken by learned trial Court as to existence
of doubt in the prosecution case being possible view and
the same cannot be portrayed as perverse or shocking,
therefore, the acquittal recorded by the learned trial court,
vide the impugned judgment, is maintained and the

appeal, being without any substance, is hereby dismissed.
