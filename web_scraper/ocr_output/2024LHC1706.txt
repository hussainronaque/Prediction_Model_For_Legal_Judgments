JUDGMENT
Date of hearing: 31.1.2024
For the Appellant: Mr. Zafar Iqbal Cheema, Advocate.
Mr. Tahir Mehmood Mufti, Deputy Attorney
For the State: General and Ch. Asghar Ali Gill, Deputy
Prosecutor General.
For the Complainant: Nemo.

Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. — This appeal is directed against
the judgment dated 15.9.2023 handed down by the Additional Sessions
Judge, Chishtian, in case FIR No.271/2021 dated 10.8.2021 registered at
Police Station Shaher Fareed, District Bahawalnagar, for an offence under

section 377 of the Pakistan Penal Code 1860 (PPC).

2. On 10.8.2021, Parveen Bibi (PW-1) appeared before Fazal
Abbas/TSI (referred to as PW-7) at Police Station Shaher Fareed,
Bahawalnagar, and submitted an application (Exh. PA). She stated that on
8.8.2021, around 4:00 p.m., her 10-year-old son, M.F., was standing
outside his house when Muhammad Saleem and Muhammad Muneeb
approached him. They persuaded him to accompany them on a
motorcycle under the pretext of purchasing milk. After driving
approximately 10 to 12 acres, they stopped the bike at Kacha Road and
forcibly took M.F. to a sugarcane field belonging to Ch. Atif where
Saleem committed sodomy with him, while Muhammad Muneeb stood
guard. M.F.’s hue and cry attracted PWs Muhammad Afzal and Khadim

Hussain to the spot. The accused fled on seeing them. Parveen Bibi
Crl. Appeal No.422/2023 -2-

prayed that legal action be initiated against them. Based on the
aforementioned application, Fazal Abbas/SI (PW-7) registered FIR
No.271/2021 dated 10.8.2021 (Exh. PE).

3. The investigation of the case was conducted by a joint
investigation team (JIT) comprising Farooq Ahmad Anwar/SI (PW-8),
Arshad Latif/DSP (PW-10), and Muhammad Zafar Rafiq/SI (PW-5) under
the Anti-Rape (Trial and Investigation) Ordinance, 2020. The JIT
inspected the crime scene, prepared a rough site plan (Exh. PD), and
recorded statements of the victim and witnesses under section 161 Cr.P.C.
On 11.8.2021, it arrested Saleem and obtained his physical remand. The
same day, it received M.F.’s MLC No.183/21, his clothes, and one sealed
envelope containing his swab. The sealed package was entrusted to
Moharrar Saifullah 1096/HC (PW-6) for safekeeping. Saifullah
subsequently handed over the same to Zafar Rafiq/SI (PW-5) for its
delivery at the office of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore
(PFSA). On 12.8.2021, Zafar Rafiq/SI produced M.F. and Saleem in the
office of the PFSA for DNA profiling and also deposited the sealed
parcel. On 18.8.2021, Saleem was sent to judicial lockup. On 26.8.2021,
Muneeb joined the investigation and was found not involved in the matter.
After the completion of the investigation, a report under Section 173
Cr.P.C. was submitted to the court against Muhammad Saleem (the

“Appellant’’).

4. On 16.10.2021, the Magistrate Section-30 indicted the
Appellant. He denied the charge and opted for trial. Following the
enactment of the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act 2021, the
Additional Sessions Judge, Chishtian, proceeded with the case. The
prosecution examined ten witnesses to prove its case. Among them,
Complainant Parveen Bibi (PW-1), Victim M.F. (PW-2), and Khadim
Hussain (PW-3) furnished the ocular account. Dr. Intsar Ali Jatala (PW-4)
provided medical evidence. Muhammad Saifullah 1096/HC (PW-6)
testified about receiving the victim’s clothing and a sealed envelope
containing his swab from Zafar Rafiq/SI (PW-5) for safekeeping in
Malkhana and then giving back the envelope to him for onward
transmission to PFSA. Farooq Ahmad Anwar/SI (PW-8), Arshad
Latif/DSP (PW-10), and Muhammad Zafar Rafiq/SI (PW-5) gave details
Crl. Appeal No.422/2023 -3-

of the investigation and the evidence that the JIT collected in this case.
The remaining witnesses were formal. The Deputy District Public
Prosecutor gave up PW Muhammad Afzal, deeming him unnecessary, and
closed the prosecution evidence after tendering the Forensic DNA and

Serology Report Exh. PG/1-2.

5. After the prosecution was through with its evidence, the
Additional Sessions Judge recorded the Appellant’s statement under
section 342 Cr.P.C. He confronted him with the incriminating material
presented against him during the trial, which he refuted while maintaining
his innocence. When questioned about his purported involvement in the

case, the Appellant asserted:

“There was a simple quarrel with the children of the complainant
because she is our neighbour. The complainant had suspicion that my
elder brother had illicit relations with the complainant’s sister; for that
reason, the complainant booked me in this false case. I am innocent.”

The Appellant neither got his statement recorded on oath

under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor examined any witness in his defence.

6. On the conclusion of the trial, vide judgment dated
15.9.2023, the Additional Sessions Judge convicted the Appellant under
section 377 read with section 511 PPC and sentenced him to simple
imprisonment for two years with a fine of Rs.10,000/- and, in default
thereof, to undergo simple imprisonment for further ten days. The Judge

extended him the benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. Hence, this appeal.

7. In support of this appeal, Mr. Zafar Iqbal Cheema, Advocate,
contended that the FIR was lodged with an inordinate delay. Since there
was no explanation for the said delay, it reflected on the veracity of the
prosecution’s version. He next contended that the trial court had failed to
appreciate the evidence correctly, which had caused a grave miscarriage
of justice. Mr. Cheema argued that M.F. was the prosecution’s key
witness but was very young. His testimony could not be relied upon
without corroboration. The prosecution produced Parveen Bibi (PW-1)
and Khadim Hussain (PW-3) for that purpose, but they could not be relied
upon because they were closely related to M.F. Additionally, there were
material contradictions in their statements. Mr. Cheema further contended

that M.F.’s DNA report, Exh. PG/1-2, falsified the prosecution’s case in
Crl. Appeal No.422/2023 -4-

its entirety because no seminal material, much less the Appellant’s semen,
was found on his body or clothes. Even his medical report, Exh. PB, was
not suggestive of sodomy. Mr. Cheema maintained that the Complainant
had falsely implicated the Appellant in this case due to suspicions
regarding his brother’s relationship with her sister. The counsel prayed
that Crl. Appeal No. 422/2023 be accepted, and the Appellant be acquitted
of the charge.

8. Ch. Asghar Ali Gill, Deputy Prosecutor General, submitted
that Parliament had inserted Sections 377-A and 377-B into the Pakistan
Penal Code through the Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Act X of
2016. Section 377-A describes the offence of sexual abuse, and section
377-B provides for its punishment. According to him, Sections 377-A/
377-B override section 377 PPC to the extent that it applied to sodomy,
and the Additional Sessions Judge had erred in indicting the Appellant
under section 377 PPC. The case should, therefore, be remanded for a de

novo trial.

9. On the merits of the prosecution’s case, the Deputy
Prosecutor General argued that the complainant party lacked any motive
to implicate the Appellant falsely. He asserted that the prosecution’s
evidence was both credible and consistent. M.F. and PWs Parveen Bibi
and Khadim Hussain stood the test of cross-examination and were
corroborated by medical evidence. He conceded that the forensic report
Exh PG/1-2 did not favour the prosecution but stated that it would not

outweigh compelling ocular and medical evidence.
10. Arguments heard. Record perused.

11. Sexual violence is a grave violation of human rights, with
profound and lasting consequences for survivors. In many societies, it
remains a pervasive issue perpetuated by systemic failures in addressing
and preventing such crimes. Robust legal frameworks are indispensable to

combat this scourge and ensure justice for survivors.

12. The Pakistan Penal Code contains comprehensive provisions
in Chapter XVI-A under the headings “Of Rape” and “Of Unnatural
Offences” to check sexual violence and prosecute perpetrators. Parliament

has amended these provisions several times over the years to address the
Crl. Appeal No.422/2023 -5-

complexities of sexual offences and fulfil its commitment to ensuring
justice for survivors of sexual violence and safeguarding vulnerable
populations. For our present purposes, sections 375, 376, 377, 377A and
377B PPC are relevant.

13. Section 375 PPC defines rape. It elaborates on various
circumstances and scenarios in which rape can occur, identifying four
primary criteria: penetration with the penis, insertion of objects or body
parts other than the penis, manipulation of the victim’s body for
penetration, and oral-genital contact. Additionally, it specifies seven
descriptions under which such acts can be considered rape, including
instances involving lack of consent, coercion, deception, incapacity to
consent, underage victims, and inability to communicate consent. The
section also provides crucial explanations to aid in interpretation.
Explanation | broadens the definition of “vagina” to include the labia
majora for legal purposes. Explanation 2 clarifies the concept of consent
as an unequivocal voluntary agreement communicated verbally or non-
verbally, emphasizing that lack of physical resistance does not imply
consent. Explanation 3 extends the definition of “person” to include male,
female, and transgender persons and adds that “rape” encompasses “gang
rape”. Lastly, Explanation 4 exempts bona fide medical procedures from

being considered as rape.

14. Section 376 outlines the punishments for committing rape,
ranging from imprisonment to the death penalty, reflecting the gravity
with which society views such offences. Furthermore, it includes
provisions for enhanced penalties in cases where additional harm is
inflicted during the commission of the offence, targeting specific
categories of victims, such as minors or individuals with disabilities, and

addressing instances of abuse of authority by public servants.

15. Moving on, section 377 criminalizes voluntary carnal
intercourse that deviates from the “natural” order of sexual intercourse.
The term “carnal intercourse” refers to sexual penetration, and “against
the order of nature” is interpreted broadly to include any sexual acts other
than heterosexual vaginal intercourse for procreation. This includes acts

such as homosexual intercourse, bestiality, and certain types of
Crl. Appeal No.422/2023 -6-

heterosexual intercourse, like anal sex. Notably, the law does not
distinguish between consensual and non-consensual acts, making both
parties involved liable to prosecution. The explanation provided in the
section clarifies that mere penetration is sufficient to constitute the
offence, underscoring penetration as the pivotal factor in determining

whether an offence under section 377 has been committed.

16. Sections 377A and 377B, enacted through the Criminal Law
(Second Amendment) Act 2016, have introduced the offence of sexual
abuse. Section 377A defines sexual abuse as any act or series of acts that
involve employing, using, forcing, persuading, inducing, enticing, or
coercing any person to engage in certain sexually explicit conduct where
the age of the victim is less than eighteen years. These acts include
fondling, stroking, caressing, exhibitionism, voyeurism, or any other
obscene or sexually explicit behaviour or simulation thereof. Importantly,
this provision specifies that such conduct can occur independently or in
conjunction with other acts, and it applies regardless of the victim’s
consent. Section 377B delineates the punishment for individuals found

guilty of committing sexual abuse under section 377A.

17. The phrase “such conduct either independently or in
conjunction with other acts” in section 377A is legally significant as it
expands the definition of sexual abuse. It implies that sexual abuse can
arise from either a single act or a series of acts, whether they occur alone
or in combination with other behaviours. For instance, if an individual
coerces a minor into engaging in fondling or exhibitionism, whether
solely through coercion or in conjunction with other actions like
persuasion or inducement, it would still constitute sexual abuse under
section 377A. Similarly, if an offender engages in stroking or caressing a
victim, whether independently or in conjunction with other forms of
sexual conduct, such as voyeurism or coercion, it would also fall under
the purview of sexual abuse as per this provision. Essentially, this phrase
ensures that perpetrators cannot evade accountability, whether they

commit sexual abuse through one or multiple prohibited acts.

18. Sections 377A and 377B PPC play a pivotal role in aligning

Pakistan’s legal framework with international human rights principles and
Crl. Appeal No.422/2023 -7-

conventions, particularly concerning the protection of children from
sexual abuse and exploitation. The United Nations Convention on the
Rights of the Child (UNCRC) emphasizes the right of every child to
protection from exploitation and abuse, including sexual abuse. This
treaty obligates the signatory States to take appropriate measures to
prevent and address all forms of violence and exploitation against

children, as outlined in Article 19 of the UNCRC.

19. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) aims to eradicate
discrimination against women and ensure their equal rights across various
aspects of life. Pakistan is a signatory to it. While CEDAW does not
explicitly address sexual abuse or specific criminal offences, its
fundamental principles of gender equality and non-discrimination are
highly relevant. Sections 377A and 377B resonate with CEDAW’s

mandate in the following ways:

(a) CEDAW recognizes gender-based violence, including
sexual abuse, as a form of discrimination against
women. By addressing sexual abuse, sections 377A
and 377B contribute to Pakistan’s adherence to
CEDAW’s mandate to combat gender-based violence
and discrimination.

(b) CEDAW underscores the importance of facilitating
access to justice and providing effective remedies for
victims of gender-based violence, including sexual
abuse. Sections 377A and 377B provide legal avenues
for prosecuting offenders and securing redress for
victims, thus aligning with Pakistan’s commitments
under CEDAW.

(c) CEDAW mandates States to take necessary measures
to safeguard women and girls from all forms of
violence and exploitation, including sexual abuse.
Sections 377A and 377B aim to protect individuals,
particularly minors, from exploitation and harm in
sexual contexts, thereby resonating with Pakistan’s
obligations under CEDAW.

20. It is important to note that while sections 375,377, and 377A
all pertain to sexual misconduct, they differ significantly in their focus,
scope, and application. Section 375 is centred on non-consensual sexual
acts, defining the parameters of rape, whereas section 377 targets

voluntary intercourse against the natural order, regardless of consent. It
Crl. Appeal No.422/2023 -8-

aims to prohibit socially or morally unacceptable behaviours and imposes
penalties such as imprisonment or fines for transgressions. Section 377A
introduces the offence of sexual abuse, particularly concerning minors,
broadening the spectrum to encompass behaviours like fondling, stroking,
exhibitionism, or any sexually explicit conduct involving individuals
under eighteen years of age. It targets acts that may not necessarily
involve penetration but still constitute forms of exploitation and harm,
aiming to protect vulnerable individuals from sexual abuse and
exploitation. While section 377A broadens the scope of sexual offences to
include additional behaviours, it does not override or replace sections 375
and 377. Instead, it complements them by addressing specific aspects of
sexual abuse, particularly concerning minors. Each section serves a
distinct purpose within the legal framework, ensuring clarity, precision,
and effectiveness in addressing various forms of sexual violence and

exploitation while upholding principles of justice and human rights.

21. In certain cases, there may be overlaps or connections
between offences under sections 375, 377, and 377A, especially
concerning the sequence of events leading to the alleged offences. In such
instances, the prosecution bears the burden of meticulously establishing
the elements of each offence beyond a reasonable doubt, including both
the actus reus
(the wrongful act) and the mens rea (the guilty mind) required for
criminal liability. The court’s resolution must be thorough, delving into
the facts of the case and examining witness testimonies, forensic
evidence, and documents to fully understand the circumstances
surrounding the alleged offences. Moreover, the court must analyze the
elements of each offence in light of the established legal principles and
case law to determine the scope and applicability of each offence in the

specific factual context of the case.

22. For completeness, we may also refer to section 511 PPC,
which delineates the legal consequences for individuals attempting to
commit the offences specified in the Code. It stipulates that attempting
such offences, if no express provision exists for punishment, can lead to
imprisonment or fines. Consequently, if someone tries to commit crimes

under sections 375, 377, or 377A but fails, they may face liability under
Crl. Appeal No.422/2023 -9-

section 511 PPC. For example, attempting rape, unnatural acts, or sexual
abuse, even unsuccessfully, could result in prosecution and punishment
under Section 511 PPC. This provision ensures accountability for those
attempting sexual offences, bolstering deterrence and prevention efforts

against such crimes.

23. In the present case, in her application marked as Exh. PA and
in FIR No. 271/2021 marked as Exh. PE, Complainant Parveen Bibi
recounted that on 8.8.2021 at about 4:00 p.m., MF. was standing outside
his residence in Mauza Taloka when the Appellant, accompanied by
co-accused Muhammad Muneeb, arrived on a motorcycle and deceitfully
lured M.F. to a nearby sugarcane field. There, the Appellant allegedly
committed sodomy with M.F. As we shall see later, the prosecution led
evidence on the same lines during the trial. It never alleged that the
Appellant sexually abused M.F. within the meaning of section 377-A PPC
at any point in time. Therefore, we hold that the Appellant was rightly
indicted under section 377 PPC. The objection raised by the Deputy

Prosecutor General in this regard is rejected.

24. The prosecution produced Complainant Parveen Bibi (PW-
1), victim M.F. (PW-2), and Khadim Hussain (PW-3) for the ocular
account. We begin with M.F.’s testimony. During his examination-in-
chief, he reaffirmed the allegations outlined in the application Exh. PA
and FIR Exh. PE. The Appellant extensively cross-examined him but he
confidently answered each question. His testimony is highly credible and

inspires confidence.

25. Mr. Cheema wants us to discard M.F.’s testimony because of
his tender age. We must not do so. In Pakistan, the competency of a
witness is determined under Articles 3 and 17 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat,
1984 (QSO), while the credibility of a witness is a question of fact which
the court decides following the principles settled for the appraisal of
evidence. Article 3 of the QSO does not explicitly specify any particular

age qualification for a witness. Under Article 3 of the QSO, a child can be
Crl. Appeal No.422/2023 -10-

a witness if he possesses the capacity and intelligence to understand and

ool

respond rationally to questions — a criterion known as the “voir dire test.

26. The court’s satisfaction in terms of Article 3 of the QSO is
not merely a procedural formality but a legal obligation that must be
discharged with utmost care and caution. In Raja Khurram Ali Khan and
others v. Tayyaba Bibi and another (PLD 2020 SC 146), the Supreme
Court of Pakistan ruled that the “rationality test”, initially applied by the
Presiding Judge at the commencement of a child witness’s examination-
in-chief, should continue to be implemented throughout their testimony.
If, at any point, the Judge observes any difficulty or reluctance in the child
witness’s narration of events, he should stop the proceedings and take
appropriate measures to alleviate their stress and anxiety. If necessary, the
case may be adjourned to a later date. If a child witness is still unable to
narrate their testimony with ease, then the Presiding Judge ought to record
their findings on the demeanour of the child witness, conclude their

evidence, and relieve them as a witness.

27. We have noted that before allowing MF. to testify in the
present case, the Additional Sessions Judge did conduct the voir dire test.
M.F. responded to his questions intelligently. Furthermore, while he

remained on the witness stand, M.F. answered each question rationally.

28. M.F.’s testimony is vital because he is the victim in this case.
In Raja Khurram Ali Khan’s case, while highlighting the significance of
the testimony of a child witness who is himself the victim of a crime, the

Supreme Court stated:

“We also find that the trial court failed to appreciate the distinction
between a child witness, who is a witness of the crime, with one who is
herself a victim of the crime. This lack of distinction led the trial court
to wrongly apply the principle of appreciating evidence of an ordinary
witness of a crime, and not applying the standard of proof required for
appreciating the testimony of a child witness, who is herself a victim of
the said crime. Even otherwise, this Court found that the prosecution
had produced sufficient evidence against the accused-convicts to safely
discharge its ‘legal’ burden to prove the guilt of the accused, which was
not rebutted by the accused-convicts by producing any evidence
creating any doubt in the prosecution’s case.”

' Under this test the court puts certain preliminary questions before the child which have no connection
with the case, in order to know the competency of the child witness.
Crl. Appeal No.422/2023 -1ll-

A similar view was expressed in Zahid v. The State

(2022 SCMR 50).

29. The Supreme Court’s observations in Atif Zareef and others
v. The State (PLD 2021 SC 550), though made in the context of a rape
case involving a woman, are relevant to the present discourse.
Recognizing the inherent difficulty in securing direct evidence for sexual
crimes due to their private nature, the Supreme Court emphasized that the
courts should not insist on additional direct evidence to corroborate the
victim’s testimony if it is found credible within the specific facts and
circumstances of a case. In such instances, the victim’s testimony should
alone suffice for the conviction of the accused. The Supreme Court stated
that a rape victim stood on a higher pedestal than an injured witness
because the latter only suffered physical harm, while the former endured

psychological and emotional distress.

30. In the present case, PWs Parveen Bibi and Khadim Hussain
strongly supported MF.’s testimony. They consistently corroborated his
account on crucial details such as the date, time, location, and manner in
which the incident occurred. Despite thorough cross-examination, the
Appellant failed to undermine their credibility. Mr. Cheema’s contention
that the witnesses’ close relationship with the victim renders their
testimony unreliable is unfounded. It is a well-established legal principle
that mere friendship or association is insufficient to discredit a witness
unless there is evidence of hostility towards the accused. Reliance is
placed on Igbal alias Bhala and others v. The State (1994 SCMR 1) and
Wahid Bukhsh and others v. The State (1997 SCMR 1424). There is
nothing in the record to suggest that the aforementioned witnesses

harboured animosity towards the Appellant.

31. Mr. Cheema contended that the two-day delay in lodging the
FIR by Parveen Bibi (PW-1) raised doubts about the prosecution’s case.
The courts in our country generally do not consider the delay in making a
report to the police material unless circumstances are such that they
warrant an adverse view. Several factors can contribute to a delay in
reporting child sexual abuse, including fear, shame, threats from the

perpetrator, or a lack of awareness. The legal system aims to balance the
Crl. Appeal No.422/2023 -12-

need to protect children from abuse with the principles of fairness and due
process. In the present case, Mr. Cheema has not referred us to any
circumstance that may require us to take an adverse view against the

prosecution because of the delay.

32. Dr. Intsar Ali Jatala (PW-4) conducted M.F.’s medical
examination at the Rural Health Centre Shaher Fareed, Chishtian, on
9.8.2021. He testified that he was dressed in a green Shalwar Qameez
when the police brought him. His Qameez had two broken buttons and
was stained with blood and mud. While the Shalwar also bore mud stains,
Dr. Jatala did not detect any semen stains. During M.F.’s general physical
examination, Dr. Jatala noted multiple abrasions on both his buttocks, a
one cm linear abrasion near the left forearm’s wrist joint, a similar
abrasion with redness surrounding the right knee joint, and a pink bruise
two cm below the left knee joint. Upon anal examination, Dr. Jatala
observed no lubricating material around it, and there were no signs of
oedema, redness, or abrasion in the anal region. Internally, the tone of the
anal sphincter appeared normal, with intact superficial anal reflexes and
no tears. He collected swabs from both external and internal anal areas for
forensic analysis, sealed them, and handed them over to the police along
with M.F.’s clothing for safekeeping. He issued MLR No. 183/21 Exh.
PB. During cross-examination, Dr. Jatala deposed that while scratches
could result from falling, the presence of bruises alongside scratches was

not possible by a fall.

33. Dr. Jatala also testified that he conducted the Appellant’s
potency test on 13.8.2021, found him potent, and issued MLR No. 190/21
Exh. PC.

34. According to the DNA and serology analysis report dated
249.2021 Exh. PG/1-2, no seminal material was detected on M-F.’s anal
swabs or stained clothing sections. Consequently, further DNA analysis,
specifically Short Tandem Repeat profiling, was not conducted on these
items. The report contains a disclaimer that the absence of seminal
material does not necessarily rule out the possibility of condom usage,
non-ejaculation, delayed medico-legal examination, improper

preservation, packaging, self-cleaning, or bathing. On 20.12.2022, Dr.
Crl. Appeal No.422/2023 -13-

Jatala reviewed the report, marked as Exh. PG/1-2, and provided his final

opinion, marked as Exh. PB/1, which stated:

“So, based on the initial examination of the victim and the report of
PFSA S.No.0000795612, it can be concluded that an act of sodomy has
not occurred; however, chances of a failed attempt cannot be ruled
out.”

35. M.F.’s blood and mud-stained clothes, along with his body
abrasions and bruises, including multiple scratch marks on both buttocks,
support the eyewitness account that the Appellant sexually assaulted him.
However, the medical evidence suggests that the act of sodomy was not

completed; it was rather a failed attempt.

36. Mr. Cheema attempted to leverage the negative DNA report
(Exh. PG/1-2), contending that it undermines the prosecution’s case.
However, this argument is flawed. It is well settled that the strength and
credibility of the evidence presented by the prosecution, including
eyewitness testimonies and medical findings, hold substantial weight in
establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Courts have historically
recognized that DNA evidence can be highly persuasive, but its absence
or negativity does not automatically invalidate the prosecution’s case if
other evidence provides robust corroboration. In past cases, courts have
upheld convictions based on compelling non-DNA evidence, highlighting
the importance of considering the overall strength and credibility of the
prosecution’s case. In Abdul Ghani v. The State and another

(2022 SCMR 544), the Supreme Court held:

“Negative reports do not reflect upon the veracity of prosecution case
for reasons more than one. D.N.A. profile generation, though a most
meticulous method with unfailing accuracy, nonetheless, requires an
elaborate arrangement for storage and transportation of samples, a
facility seldom available. Even the slightest interference with the
integrity of samples may alter the results of an analysis. Thus, the fate
of the prosecution case cannot be pinned down on the forensic findings
alone; otherwise, merely presenting corroborative support is hardly
needed in the face of the overwhelming evidence presented by the
prosecution through sources most unimpeachable.”

37. In his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C., the Appellant

stated that Complainant Parveen Bibi had falsely implicated him in this

case for two reasons: firstly, he claimed that there was a quarrel with her

> Further reference may be made to Zahid and another v. The State (2020 SCMR 590), _Wishal Masih
v. The State and others (2017 YLR 2031), and Khadim Hussain v. The State (2011 PCr.LJ 1443).
Crl. Appeal No.422/2023 -14-

children. Secondly, she suspected that his elder brother had illicit relations
with her sister. However, he failed to provide evidence to substantiate

either of these claims.

38. To conclude, the prosecution has established that the
Appellant attempted to commit an unnatural offence against the order of
nature with M.-F. Therefore, the Additional Sessions Judge has rightly
convicted him under section 377 read with section 511 PPC. As
adumbrated, the prosecution neither alleged nor led evidence to prove that
the Appellant had committed the offence of sexual abuse described in
section 377-A PPC. Hence, the question of conviction under that

provision does not arise.

39. Admittedly, the Appellant was a juvenile, being 14 years old,
when he committed the offence. Therefore, the Additional Sessions Judge

rightly took a lenient view in sentencing him.

40. This appeal is dismissed. The Appellant’s conviction and

sentence are upheld.
