Khan Muhammad ASI, PW-14 at emergency

ward of Timergara hospital to the effect that

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
ot

on the day of occurrence, he (complainant)
alongwith his father Bismilllah Khan
(deceased), Bakht Zamin, PW-4 and Zerullah,
PW-5 were on their way to Hazrat Hotel
Balambat road Timergara for selling of their
milk. When they reached at the place of
occurrence, near Hazrat Hotel, the accused
Zameen, Kameen and Shah Zamin were
already present there who had attacked the
complainant-party with stick/dhanda blows.
Whereas the accused Zamin with some sharp
object injured his father Bismillah Khan on his
head. While from stick blows of the accused
Kameen and sharp object blows of said
accused Bakht Zamin had received injuries on
his head and finger of left hand, whereas
Zerullah sustained injuries on left side of his
skull, right hand and shoulder from the blows
of accused Shah Zamin. The motive behind
the offence was disclosed to be a dispute over
irrigation of water. In addition to the
complainant Mata Khan, PW-3 the occurrence

was stated to have been witnessed by

NAWAB OB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syod Arshad All
Tazamin, Lal Zada and Asil Zada, all these
three eye-witnesses were abandoned by the
prosecution. The report of the complainant
was incorporated in Mad No. 13 dated
23.09.2014, Ex. PA. The said report was
seconded by Wazir Zada. Thereafter, on
26.09.2014 at 04:55 A.M. the injured
Bismillah Khan succumbed to the injury at
Peshawar, hence, the FIR ibid was registered
against the accused/appellants at PS concerned
on the same date.

3. Investigation in the case was
entrusted to Abdul Hameed Khan, Sub
Inspector, PW-11 who visited the spot and
prepared the site plan Ex. PB on the pointation
of the complainant and other eye-witnesses.
He had recovered weapons of offence Ex. P-1
& Ex. P-2 from houses of the accused Kameen
and Shah Zameen vide recovery memo Ex.
PW-6/1 and prepared recovery sketch of the
said memo Ex. PB/l. He has taken into
possession blood stained clothes of the deceased

vide recovery memo Ex. PW-11/1. He had also

NAWAB OB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr, Justics Syed Arshad All
taken into possession an axe vide recovery
memo Ex. PW-11/2 being handed over to him
by one Lal Zada who stated that the same was
snatched by him from the accused Zameen
during the quarrel. He has also prepared the
pointation memo Ex. PW-7/l (already
exhibited). Vide application Ex. PW-11/7 he
had obtained warrant u/s 204 Cr.P.C (Ex. PW-
11/8) and likewise vide application Ex. PW-
11/9 he had obtained proclamation notice Ex.
PW-11/10 from the Court concerned. On
receipt of the medical report of the injured
Bakht Zamin, the Investigation Officer had
issued addition memo Ex. PW-11/12_ for
insertion of section 337-F (v) PPC against the
accused. He has also arrested the accused
Zameen on 30.10.2014 vide card of arrest Ex.
PW-11/13, On receipt of the FSL report Ex.
PZ the same was placed on file. Similarly, he
has also placed on file the record of criminal
cases/FIRs in respect of the motive as
Ex. PW-I1/16 to Ex.PW-11/17. Upon

completion of the investigation, complete

NAWAB OB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazantar Khan
Mr, Justice Syed Arshad Ali
challan was forwarded to the SHO concerned
for onward submission.

4, . During the course of trial, the
prosecution examined as many as 15
witnesses whose statements were recorded and
placed on file. On closure of the prosecution
evidence, accused were examined under
section 342, Cr.P.C, wherein they denied the
charges, posed innocence and stated to have
falsely been implicated in the case.

5. On conclusion of the trial, the
learned Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zila
Qazi Dir Lower convicted and sentenced the
accused/appellants vide the judgment
impugned herein. Hence, these connected
matters.

6. Arguments of the learned
counsels for the parties including learned Astt:
Advocate General representing the State were
heard at length and record of the case was
perused with their able assistance.

7. According to the Mad report, Ex.

PA dated 23.09.2014 the occurrence has taken

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
place at 6:55 A.M, whereas according to the
medical report the deccased Bismillah Khan
had reached the hospital at 7:45 A.M and the
injured Bakht Zamin reached at hospital on
7:45 A.M, whereas the third injured Zerullah
was taken to the hospital at unknown time as
evident from his injury sheet Ex. PW-14/3.
Whereas the matter was reported through Mad
Ex. PA at 9:10 A.M. The place of occurrence
is at a distance of half kilometer from the
police station and the hospital where the
injured were brought also falls within the
same proximity. Thus, there is a delay of 2
hours and 15 minutes in lodging of the first
report.

8. Although, the FIR was registered
on 26.09.2014, however, the same appears to
be for the reason that the prosecution had
waited for the medical opinion of the doctor
which resulted in delay in the registration of
the FIR. Since this delay in registration of
Nagal Mad, Ex. PA has provided ample

Opportunity to the complainant-party to

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justico Munammad Ghozantar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
.

deliberate and consult in the matter. Therefore,
not only the mode and manner of the
occurrence has to be thoroughly examined but
the ocular testimony requires a very careful
probe albeit being supported/ corroborated by
unimpeachable circumstantial evidence.

9. According to the prosecution
case, the complainant Mala Khan, PW-3 who
is the son of the deceased Bismillah Khan was
present on the spot, the injured Bakht Zamin,
PW-4 and the other injured Zerullah, PW-5
had received injuries, for which specific role
was assigned to Zamecn, Kameen sons of
Barkat Khan and Shah Zamin son of Momin
Khan to have attacked at them through sticks
and further specific role was assigned to the
appellant Zameen who has inflicted a blow on
the deceased Bismillah Khan with some sharp
edged weapon on his head. Similarly, specific
role was also assigned to Kameen that he had
inflicted stick blows as well as through a sharp
edged weapon on the head of Bakht Zamin

as well as on his finger. Whereas the accused

NAWAB DB: Mr, Justico Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr, Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Shah Zamin was given a role that he had
inflicted injuries on the body of PW-5
Zerullah on his head, right shoulder and hand.

10. Apart from the complainant and
the two other injured/witnesses, Tazamin son
of Munasib Gul, Lal Zada son of Shahzullah
and Asil Zada son of Amir Zada are stated to
be the eye-witnesses of the occurrence.

11. Mata Khan, the complainant
appeared as PW-3. The addition/improvement
in his court statement was that Zameen was
having axe whereas Kameen and Shah Zamin
were having sticks. Zameen had inflicted axe
blow at Bismillah Khan which injured him on
his head. He has further stated in his statement
that at the time of said fight Lat Zada had
snatched axe from the possession of Zameen
which was later provided to the Investigation
Officer. In his cross-examination, he has
admitted that the said Lal Zada who was not
produced before the Court was his cousin who
is the resident of another village. The other

witnesses and the injured were also related to

NAWAB OB: Me. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr, Justlee Syed Arshad Ali
-10-

him. He has also made the following
admissions in his cross-examination:-

e That the place of occurrence is situated
in Bazar and number of people attracted
to the spot.

e He took his father to the hospital at 7:12
A.M, whereas the Bakht Zamin was
taken to the hospital at 7:15 in his
Suzuki. When they reached at the
hospital the police officials were
available on the main gate. He had
narrated the entire story to the police
officials, who in turn told him that the
complainant should look after his father
and they would call the other police
officials. At 9: 10 A.M their report was
registered, whereas his father was
referred to Peshawar through
ambulance at 9:15 A.M.

e He sustained no injury during the
scuffle.

12. Bakht Zamin, the injured/witness

was examined as PW-4. He has stated in his

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr, Jusilee Syed Arshed Ali
-I1-

cross-examination that the police had recoded
their statements in a room and when they
reached at the hospital the police were present,
however, they have stated that the other police
officials will come and record their
statements.

13. The 3" injured/witness Zerullah
appeared as PW-5. He has admitted the
presence of his other relatives Lal Zada, Asil
Zada and Tazamin at the spot, however, they
did not participate in the quarrel. He has
further stated in his cross-examination that
when they reached at the hospital they had
informed the police about the incident.
However, he did not know as to whether his
statement was recorded or not. He has
also stated that when they reached at the
hospital on 7:15 A.M, at that time the
doctor was not available and he was examined
by the doctor at 8:15 A.M, who had first
examined the injured Bismillah. During the
said examination, the police were present

alongwith them, however, the other police

NAWAB DB: Mr, Justice Muhammad Ghazantar Khan
Mr, Justice Syed Arshad All
(from police station) did not reach there and
he did not remember as to whether their
statements were recorded in the said ward or
not.

14. Indeed, the entire prosecution
case stays on the ocular testimony of the
aforesaid witnesses and the other alleged
witnesses who have seen the occurrence
including Lal Zada, who has _ allegedly
snatched the axe from the appellant/convict
Zameen was not produced before the Court.
15. According to record, the age of
the complainant is 24/25 years, the age of his
father Bismillah Khan was 48 years
approximately, the age of the injured Bakht
Zamin is 30/31 years and the age of injured
Zerullah was 26/27 years. Whereas, the age of
their other relatives, the alleged eye-witnesses
i.e. Lal Zada, Asil Zada and Tazamin is not
available on the record. Against that, the age
of the appellant Zameen, who was given
effective role at the relevant time was 54/55

years, the age of appellant Shah Zamin was

NAWAB OB: Mr, Justleo Muhammad Ghazantar Khan
Mr, Justice Syed Arshad Ati
ras

-13-

33/34 years, whereas the age of other accused
Kameen Khan was 45/46 years.

16. The close perusal of the
statements of the aforesaid PWs in juxta
position with the site plan suggest that all of
them were standing very close to each other
and the complainant Mata Khan who is a
young boy of 24/25 years had ample
Opportunity to have got hold of the
appellan/convict Zameen who at the relevant
time was 54/55 years old to protect from his
blow his father. Interestingly, in the entire
scuffle, he (complainant) did not receive any
injury. Therefore, it is very unusual conduct
on his part that someone would be hitting his
father and he will make no effort to save his
father. It is also further evident from his
statement that their another relative Lal Zada
was also present at the spot, who was able to
snatch the said axe from the appellant/convict
Zameen, however, neither they could catch-
hold of the accused who were less in numbers

nor they had made any effort to hit them with

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhsmmad Ghazanfor Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-14-

the axe which they had snatched from him.
His further unusual conduct is evident from
his initial report wherein he says that the
appellant Zameen had hit his deceased father
Bismillah Khan with some sharp edged
weapon, however, he does not specifically
mention the axe despite the fact that the report
was lodged at 9:10 A.M. whereas the
occurrence had taken place 6:55 A.M and at
the same time he knew that the said axe was
taken by Lal Zada from the appellant Zameen
but even then he did not mention all these
material facts in his initial report, which
makes his presence at the spot very doubtful.
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan had
disbelieved the statement of an alleged
eye-witness whose conduct remained unusual

in a case law titled “ Muhammad Khan and

another v/s The State reported _as 1999

SCMR 1220’, wherein it was held that:- “ir és

axiomatic and universally recognized principle of
flaw that conviction must be founded on
unimpeachable evidence and certainty of guilt and
hence any doubt that arises in the prosecution case

NAWAB OB: Mr, Justico Muhammad Ghazanfas Khan
Mr, Justice Syed Arshod Ali
-15-

must be resolved in favour of the accused. It is,
therefore, imperative for the Court to examine and
consider all the relevant events preceding and
leading to the occurrence so as to arrive at a correct
conclusion, Where the evidence examined by the
prosecution is found inherently unreliable,
improbable and against natural course of human
conduct, then the conclusion must be that the
prosecution failed to prove guilt beyond reasonable
doubt. It would be unsafe to rely on the ocular
evidence which has been moulded, changed and
improved step by step so as to fit in with the other
evidence on record. It is obvious that truth and
falsity of the prosecution case can only be judged
when the entire evidence and circumstances are

scrutinized and examined in its correct perspective.

17. Moving on ; further to the
testimony of the two other alleged
injured/witnesses namely Bakht Zamin, PW-4
and Zerullah, PW-5. True that from the
injuries on their bodies it appears that they
were present at the spot and also received
injuries. However, despite the fact that they
have admitted in their testimony that their
statements were recorded on the same day, but

according to the record their statements under

NAWAB OB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-16-

section 16] Cr.P.C were recorded on
27.09.2014. This delayed recording of
statement is not fatal to the prosecution case
because at that time no FIR was registered and
the FIR was subsequently registered on
26.9.2014, which led to delay in recording of
their statements, however, the question mark
on their credibility is that aespite the fact that
according to their testimony they reached at
the hospital on 7:15 A.M and the police were
also present in the said hospital but their
version was not recorded by the police. Even
in the first Mad report which was recorded at
9:10 A.M the use of axe has not been
mentioned, which shows that they had
concealed the material facts.

No doubt that the presence of the
injured witnesses cannot be doubted at the
place of incident, however, it is equally settled
law that if the said witnesses are otherwise
untruthful then their testimony is to be
excluded from consideration. In this regard,

we are fortified with the law laid down by the

NAWAB DG: Mr, Justico Muhammad Ghazanfas Khan
Mr, Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-17-

august Supreme Court of Pakistan in “Amin
Ali_ and another v/s the State (2011 SCMR
323), wherein it was observed:- “ Certainly,
the presence of the injured witnesses cannot
be doubted at the place of incident, but the
question is as to whether they are truthful
witnesses or otherwise, because merely the
injuries on the persons of PWs would not
stamp them truthful witnesses.”

18. Another damaging factor to the
prosecution case is that in the Mad report the
complainant-party have stated that Bismillah
Khan and other injured/ PW Bakht Zameen
received injuries from sharp edged weapon,
however, their this testimony is belied by the
medical evidence, according to which, the
injured and the deceased had received injuries
from a blunt weapon. In order to bring their
version in line with the medical evidence they
have stated in their Court statements that the
accused had inflicted axe blows by using the
blunt side of the axe and not the sharp one.

This improvement in our humble view is not

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-18-

appealable to a prudent mind being purely
based on dishonesty.

19. Moving on further to the
circumstantial evidence. In the present case,
the site plan Ex. PB was prepared on
27.09.2014, however, no incriminating
material was collected from the spot. The only
incriminating material as circumstance was
the recovery of axe, Ex. PW-11/2, the said axe
was allegedly handed over to the Investigation
Officer by Lal Zada afier 3 days of the
occurrence and the said Lal Zada never
appeared before the Court in support of the
same. Therefore, the recovery of the said axe
not only appears to be doubtful but the same is
an afterthought attempt to strengthen the
prosecution case. Hence, evidentiary value of
such circumstantial evidence in shape of
doubtful recovery is of no help to the
prosecution case.

20. Although, the motive for the
offence has been established as the

prosecution has placed on record copies of the

NAWAB DB: Mr, Justice Muhammad Ghazentar Khan
Mz, Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-19-

previous FIRs as Ex. PW-11/16 to Ex. PW-
11/17, wherein the complainant-party were
accused. However, motive is a double edged
weapon which cuts both sides, therefore, when
the ocular and circumstantial evidence being
led by prosecution is not confidence inspiring
then motive alone is inconsequential in respect
of guilt of the accused/appellants.

21, We are conscious of the fact that
in the alleged incident the father of the
complainant namely Bismillah Khan was
deprived of his precious life at the age of
47/48 years. However, instead of bringing on
record the true mode and manner of the
incident, the entire prosecution case is based
on concoction and concealment.

22. Thus, the prosecution case is
pregnant with serious doubts and it is settled
law that in case of even a single doubt the
benefit of the same is to be drawn in favour of
the accused not as a matter of favour or grace

but as his/their right.

NAWAS = DB: Mr, Justice Muhammad Ghazantfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
23. Similarly, when we have
disbelieved the testimony of the
injured/witnesses against the appellant
Zameen for injury caused on the body of the
deceased Bismillah Khan then the same set of
evidence is also to be disbelieved against the
appellanis Kameen Khan and Shah Zamin
who are charged for injuring the injured/eye-
witnesses Bakht Zamin and Zerullah.

24, In the above backdrop and after
reappraisal of the entire evidence, this Court is
of the firm view that the prosecution case
against the accused/appellants has not been
proved beyond any reasonable doubt and the
judgment of learned trial Court dated
27.09.2017 is based on wrong appreciation of
evidence. Hence, we accept this appeal and
set-aside the impugned judgment rendered by
the learned trial Court. Therefore, the
accused/appellants are acquitted of the charges
leveled against them. They be released

forthwith if not required in any other case.

NAWAS OB: Mr. Justico Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syod Arshad All
-2]-

25. Regarding the appeal against
acquittal and criminal revision petition for
enhancement preferred by the complainant-
party, we have noted that the acquittal of
accused/respondents No. 2 to 4 under sections
302 (b) and 324 PPC is in accordance with
law, therefore, the impugned judgment to the
extent of their acquittal is reasonable on all
counts, which requires no interference.
Resultantly, both the appeal and criminal
revision are also dismissed being devoid of
merits.

26. These are the reasons of our short

order of even date.
