Cr.Misc (BA) No. 1763-P/2020

Petitioner by: Mr. Ashfaq Ahmad Daudzai,
Advocate.

The State by: Ms Sofia Noreen, Standing
Counsel, along with Noor
Muhammad ASI.

Date of hearing: 06.07.2020

ORDER

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- This petition has

been filed by Abdul Wahab son Zahid Ali, resident of
Khazana Sugar milla, Charsadda Road, Peshawar, for
the grant of post arrest transit bail in a case registered
against him, vide FIR No. 820/2020,dated 31.05.2020,
under sections 381-A/420 PPC at Police Station,
Shah Dara Town, Lahore.

2. Relevant facts, as reflected from the record, are
that the present petitioner was arrested by the local
police of Police Station, Agha Mir Jani (Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa), on 08.06.2020 in a case registered
against him, vide FIR No. 626 dated 07.06.2020,
under sections 419/ 420/ 468/ 471/411/171 PPC in
which he was granted bail by the learned Judicial
Magistrate, vide order dated 11.06.2020, however, he
could not be released from Jail as he was also
involved in another criminal case registered against
him under sections 381-A/420 PPC, vide FIR No.

820/20, at Police Station, Shah Dara Town, Lahore,

Cr.Misc (BA) No. 1763/2020
on 01.06.2020. Since there was no warrant against the
petitioner in the above referred case, therefore, a
complainant under section 54 Cr.P.C was drafted
against him and in pursuance thereof, he was
produced before Judicial Magistrate, who, vide order
dated 09.06.2020, remanded him to Judicial Lock Up
with the direction to intimate the concerned Police
Station. Since no arrangement for his shifting to the
Province of Punjab was made, therefore, the petitioner
filed an application before learned Sessions Judge,
Peshawar, under section 86 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure with a prayer to grant him post arrest transit
bail in the above referred case but it was refused to
him, hence, the instant petition.

4. Mr. Ashfaq Ahmad Daudzai, Advocate,
appearing on behalf of learned counsel for the
petitioner argued that the petitioner is neither charged
in the above referred FIR bearing No. 820/20,
registered at Police Station, Shah Dara Town Lahore,
nor any process have been issued against him as
envisaged under Chapter-VI (processes to compel
appearance) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898,
nor any correspondence have been made regarding his
shifting to the Province of Punjab, therefore,

confinement of the petitioner in absence of any

Cr.Misc (BA) No. 1763/2020
warrant by the competent court having jurisdiction
amounts to abuse of process of law, therefore, he may
be granted transit bail enabling him to appear before
the Sessions Judge concerned. Ms. Sofia Noreen,
appearing on behalf of the State, half heartedly
opposed the petition. To clarify the position, on the
previous date of hearing, SHO concerned was directed
to appear before the Court and, today, Noor
Muhammad ASI is present before the court, who
categorically stated that no correspondence,
whatsoever, have been made with the Punjab Police
regarding shifting of the petitioner, however, he stated
that the local police of the concerned Police Station
has been informed telephonically.

5. I have perused the order of learned Sessions
Judge, Peshawar, dated 15.06.2020, and found it to
have been passed in a slipshod manner because in
paragraph third of the order, it has been observed that:
“Record of the local police and comments of
Superintendent Central Prison, Peshawar perused. The
local police of Police Station, Shahdara Town Lahore
have initiated the process of shifting the accused in
custody to Lahore required to them in case FIR referred

above,” but the record of the case and comments of

the Superintendent Central Jail speaks otherwise.

Cr.Misc (BA) No. 1763/2020
6. Chapter VI of the Code of Criminal Procedure
provides the mechanism for issuance of process to
compel appearance of an accused person or anybody
else through issuance of summonses and warrants and
procedure by Magistrate before whom person arrested
is brought. The relevant section 86 of the Code, ibid,

for ready reference, is reproduced as under:-

86. Procedure by Magistrate before whom person
arrested is brought: (1) Such Magistrate or District
Superintendent shall, if the person arrested appears
to be the person intended by the Court which issued
the warrant, direct his removal in custody to such
Court.

Provided that, if the offence is bailable, and such
person is ready and willing to give bail to the
satisfaction of such Magistrate, or District
Superintendent or a direction has been endorsed
under Section76 on the warrant and such person is
ready and willing to give the security required by
such direction, the Magistrate, or District
Superintendent shall take such bail or security as the
case may be, and forward the bond to the Court
which issued the warrant:

Provided further that, if the offence is not bailable
or no direction has been endorsed under Section 76
on the warrant, the Sessions Judge of the sessions
division in which the person is arrested may, subject
to the provisions of Section 497 and for sufficient
reasons, release, the person on an interim bail on
such bond or security, as the Sessions Judge thinks
fit and direct the person to appear by a specified
date before the Court which issued the warrant and
forward the bond to that Court.

Nothing in this section shall be deemed to
prevent a police-officer from taking security under

Section 76.”

Cr.Misc (BA) No. 1763/2020
A perusal of the above provisions of law shows
that when any persons is arrested in execution of
warrant issued under Chapter-VI, the Judicial
Magistrate before whom person arrested is brought,
shall, at the first instance, under clause (1) of section
86, issue direction for his removal of custody to the
relevant Court, if such direction is not issued, under
first proviso, if the offence is bailable or direction has
been made under section 76 of the Warrant, shall take
bail bonds from him by forwarding the same to the
court which issued the warrant and if the offence is
not bailable or no direction has been endorsed under
section 76 of the warrant, in that case, under second
proviso, the Sessions Judge concerned, subject to the
provisions of section 497 Cr.P.C and for sufficient
reasons, release the person on an interim bail on such
bond or security as thinks fit and direct the person to
appear by a specified date before the Court which
issued the warrant and forward the bond to that Court.
6. In the instant case, neither the petitioner, as
per contents of the FIR No. 820/20, referred to above,
is nominated as an accused, nor warrant has been
issued against him under sections 75/87 Cr.P.C and he
has been arrested under section 54 Cr.P.C, therefore

he was to be dealt with under the provisions of section

Cr.Misc (BA) No. 1763/2020
60 Cr.P.C, according to which a police officer making
an arrest without warrant shall, without unnecessary
delay and subject to the provisions herein contained as
to bail, take or send the person arrested before a
Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case. When the
petitioner has been arrested by the local police under
section 54 Cr.P.C and is behind the bars since
08.06.2020 but neither any warrant has been issued
against him nor there is correspondence in black and
white have been made regarding shifting of the
petitioner-accused to Punjab, as depicted from the
comments submitted by the Superintendent, Central
Prison, Peshawar, therefore, in the present scenario,
the petitioner-accused cannot be kept in Jail and that
too for indefinite period.

6. In view of the facts and circumstances of the
case and while driving guidance from the case law,
1993 P.Cr. L.J 738 Peshawar, the petition is allowed,
resultantly, the petitioner-accused is directed to be
released on interim bail on furnishing bail bonds in
the sum of Rs. 2,00,000/- with two sureties each in the
like amount to the satisfaction of Additional Registrar
(Judicial) of this Court, who shall forward the bonds
to the Court concerned for further proceedings at that

end in accordance with law. Accused-petitioner is

Cr.Misc (BA) No. 1763/2020
directed to appear before the proper forum (Court
concermed) at Lahore on or before 20.07.2020, failing
which the law shall take its own course.

Above are the reasons of short order of even

date.

Announced.
