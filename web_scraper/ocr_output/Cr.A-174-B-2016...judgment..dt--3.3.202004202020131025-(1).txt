2. Facts of the case, as reflected from the FIR
Ex. PA, registered on the basis of murasila Ex. PA/1, are
that on 17.8.2015 at 1050 hours, complainant Muhammad
Naeem Khan (PW-5), in injured condition, made report in
Civil Hospital, Bannu, to the effect that on the day of
occurrence he alongwith Farid Khan (PW-6) was riding on
a motorbike from New Sabzi Mandi for depositing cash
amount of Rs.26,00,000/- in Unite Bank Limited, Bannu;
the motorbike was driven by him, whereas Farid Khan
PW-6 was occupying the pillion with cash amount wrapped
in a Chadar; when they reached at Kotka Imam Shah
Mulagan situated on Bannu-D.I.Khan Road opposite to

Bannu Woolen Mills at about 1020 hours, meanwhile, three
-3-

unknown persons with muffled faces riding on a
motorcycle Honda 125, black colour struck their motorbike
from behind and started firing with their pistols which
resulted into injuries on their person. One of the accused
snatched cash amount from PW-6. The accused decamped
from the spot after commission of the offence. Besides the
complainant, the occurrence is stated to be witnessed by
Farid Khan PW-6. Subsequently, the complainant and
PW-6 recorded their supplementary statements, wherein
they mentioned full descriptions and features of all the three
accused and stated that the amount was arranged by PW
Muhammad Ilyas and after counting was handed over to the
complainant in his motorcar, whereafter, while on their way
to United Bank Limited three unknown accused riding a
motorcycle struck their motorbike from behind, started
firing with their pistols which resulted into injuries on their
person and one of the accused came ahead to snatch the
amount and the complainant grappled with the accused and
in that eventuality, his face was exposed who was duly seen
by the complainant and the injured PW Farid Khan.
Subsequently, Sir Syed Ali Shah was arrested and from his
possession a Honda motorcycle 125, 30 bore pistol and
cash amount of Rs.9,21,500/- were recovered. The
appellant Afshan was arrested on 22.9.2015, whereas
Salim Gul on 05.10.2015 and on their pointation, their

shares in the snatched amount were recovered by the local
-4-

police from their houses. The complainant and PW Farid
Khan identified the convicts/appellants on different dates
before Amir Ali Afridi Judicial Magistrate (PW-14). The
snatched money was also identified by PW Ilyas Khan in
presence of Judicial Magistrate in police station Saddar.

3. On completion of investigation, complete
challan was submitted against the accused before the
learned Trial Court. Charge was framed where the accused
did not plead guilty and claimed trial. In order to bring
home guilt of the accused, the prosecution produced and
examined as many as sixteen witnesses, whereafter,
accused were examined under section 342, Cr.P.C., wherein
they denied the allegations, professed innocence and stated
to have falsely been implicated in the present case,
however, neither they opted to be examined under section
340(2), Cr.P.C., nor wished to produce evidence in their
defence. The learned trial Court, on conclusion of the trial,
convicted the appellants vide impugned judgment dated
24.3.2016, and sentenced them as mentioned above, which
has been assailed through the instant appeals.

4. Arguments heard and record perused.

5. The complainant reported that on 17.8.2015,
he alongwith injured Farid Khan visited New Sabzi Mandi,
Bannu and collected an amount of Rs.26 Lacs, while on
their way to United Bank Limited, their motorcycle was

struck from behind, they saw three persons riding a
-5-

motorcycle with muffled faces who pulled out their pistols
and started firing at them which resulted into injuries, one
of the accused snatched the amount from PW Farid, which
was wrapped in a Chadder, whereafter, the injured were
shifted to the hospital where the complainant Muhammad
Naeem reported the matter. The record further transpires
that after the injured were examined by the doctor, the SHO
of the concerned police station, namely Iftekhar Ali
alongwith the Investigating Officer Inayatullah Khan
reached to the hospital, where after some time the injured
got recorded their supplementary statements. The
complainant while recording his supplementary statement,
stated that the accused when reached near them, started
firing and one of the accused came forward, snatched the
amount. The parties started grappling with each other as a
result face of the accused got exposed and was identified.
The supplementary statements tell that the amount was
provided by one Ilyas to the complainant and after counting
the same in his motorcar, it was wrapped in a Chadder. As
the supplementary statement has created a haze so prudence
demands great care to unearth the hidden truth and to assess
the veracity of the prosecution witnesses. The report is
silent that wherefrom the amount was collected and that
what for the collected amount was to be deposited in the
Bank. There is nothing on record to suggest that the

complainant was having his business in the vegetable
-6-

market and that it was from there that the amount was
collected. The complainant stated in his supplementary
statement that the amount was handed over by PW
Muhammad Ilyas after counting in his motorcar, who was
examined as PW-9, who stated that it was in the morning
that the complainant asked the amount, he arranged the
same and handed over. The prosecution failed that why in
the initial report, such important facts were ignored and
what need was felt for recording a supplementary statement
despite the fact that at the time of report both the witnesses
were conscious and oriented in time and space. The
prosecution could not explain that how Muhammad Ilyas,
on such a short notice arranged the amount and handed over
to the complainant. If the relations between the two i.e. the
complainant and PW Ilyas were so cordial, then why PW
Ilyas soon after the occurrence on getting information, did
not visit the hospital and that why he did not record his
statement in this respect. This is astonishing that when Ilyas
was examined as PW-9, he stated that after handing over
amount to the complainant he went to Sarai Naurang for
personal errand and that he asked his brother to go to the
hospital and inquire about the health of the complainant.
This witness further stated that he visited the hospital after
2/3 days of the incident. We are surprised that what
prevented the complainant to visit the hospital despite the

fact that the hospital is located in the same city. If the
-7-

statement of PW Ilyas is taken to be correct then what for
the amount was to be deposited in the Bank as it was
urgently needed, even the complainant failed to explain the
urgency. The complainant did not come with the whole
truth, rather he concealed the material facts with the sole
purpose to bring his story in line to what the police
demanded. The complainant never remained consistent and
went on changing his stance at one point of time and he
stated that in the vegetable market, one Tawab handed over
an amount of Rs:3,16,600/-, which was lying in his pocket
at the time of incident, but while recording his
supplementary statement he did not mention that before the
incident he entered into the vegetable market. If we
concede to what he stated, then why the said Tawab was
not examined who could have been the best witness, but
this suggests that the complainant did not come with the
whole truth. The supplementary statement was an attempt
to create a breakthrough so that the subsequent involvement
and arrest could be justified, it was this attempt that jolted
the very foundation of the case.

6. The report tells that the accused while firing
were muffled faces. The complainant never claimed that he
could identify if the accused were brought before him and
even in the FIR, no descriptions/features of the accused

were mentioned. The supplementary statement has given a
-8-

new twist to the story where dishonest improvements were
made which has shaken the very structure.

In case titled Muhammad Mansha Vs. The

State (2018 SCMR 772), it was held that:-

“Once the Court comes to the
conclusion that the eye-witnesses had
made dishonest improvements in their
statements then it is not safe to place
reliance on their statements. It is also
settled by this Court that whenever a
witness made dishonest improvement in
his version in order to bring his case in
line with the medical evidence or in
order to strengthen the prosecution
case then his testimony is not worthy of
credence. The witnesses in this case
have also made dishonest improvement
in order to bring the case in line with
the medical evidence (as observed by
the learned High Court), in that
eventuality conviction was not
sustainable on the testimony of the said
witnesses”.

7. Iftekhar Ali (SHO) was examined as PW-7,
who stated that after recording supplementary statements of
the witnesses, he received information that one of the
accused was Sir Syed, who had gone to the house of one
Ayub Ali Shah of Kotka Imam Shah and so they chased in
haste and reached there, Ayub Ali Shah was brought out
from his house who stated that the accused with two others
have left on motorcycle to Koti Sadat and when they
reached Koti Sadat, they came across 3/4 villagers, who
told that the accused went to the house of one Amanullah
in village Adami. We are surprised that how the SHO was

informed regarding the involvement of accused Sir Syed in
-9-

the episode and that how the informer could know his such
involvement. It is yet an element of surprise that even the
complainant did not disclose the name of accused Sir Syed,
either to the Investigating Officer or to the SHO (PW-7). If
the stance taken by PW-7 to be correct, then why they did
not record the statement of Ayub Ali Shah to whose house
the accused after the occurrence had gone and that why this
fact was not brought on record that it was Ayub Ali Shah
who told that the accused Sir Syed with two others went
towards Koti Sadat. The conduct of this witness is not
above board as it was soon after the occurrence that he
followed the accused on information, then wherefrom two
others came to the house of Ayub Ali Shah, when the
informer had seen only accused/appellant Sir Syed while
entering into the house. PW-7 further stated that when he
reached to Koti Sadat, the passer-bys told that all the three
ie. Sir Syed and his companions went to Adami to the
house of one Amanullah. This is surprising that how the
villagers came to know that the persons leaving for Adami,
were Sir Syed and his friends and that how they came to
know that the accused had gone to the house of one
Amanullah. If we accede to what PW-7 stated, then why the
statements of the villagers, who tendered the information,
were not recorded. The Investigating Officer stated that he
went in the company of the SHO and others to the house of

Amanullah and when entered into the Baithak, accused Sir
-10-

Syed and two others were sitting there, where the accused
Sir Syed introduced himself, who was holding an envelope
in his hand and so the accused was arrested and an amount
of Rs.9,21,500/- alongwith a 30 bore pistol were recovered
and taken into possession. If we say yes to what the
witnesses stated, then the prosecution will have to satisfy
that why rest of the two who were present at the time of
arrest of accused/appellant Sir Syed, were let off without
asking their names and without confirming their status from
convict/appellant Sir Syed. The prosecution is yet to
explain that how it decided that the other two persons with
the convict/appellant were not the nominated accused. The
arrest was allegedly made from the Baithak of one
Amanullah, but the prosecution did not feel the need to
record his statement in this respect. The convict Sir Syed
was arrested, thoroughly investigated and thereafter was
deposited in the judicial lockup. It was after sometime that
the prosecution inserted Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism
Act to the file which led to the constitution of a Joint
Investigation Team headed by one Latif Ullah Khan
Inspector. Latif Ullah Khan Inspector was examined as
PW-13, who stated that after insertion of Section 7 ATA, an
application for further custody of the accused was
submitted pursuant thereto five days custody was granted
and on expiry two more days were granted, but noting to

favour the prosecution could be extracted. The record is
-ilil-

silent that wherefrom the co-accused i.e. Salimullah and
Afshan crept in when it has nowhere been mentioned by the
Investigating Officer and Incharge Joint Investigation Team
that it was the convict/appellant Sir Syed, who disclosed the
identity of the co-accused. Though the Investigating Officer
arrested the co-accused on different dates where on
pointation of accused Afshan, Rs.8,30,000/- from a ditch
inside the house was recovered and on pointation of
accused Salim, an amount of Rs.8,27,000/- has been shown
recovered. The Investigating Officer, after recovery of the
amount requested for identification of the currency through
PW Ilyas, in which respect an application was submitted
before the Court which was allowed and one Aamir Ali
Afridi, Judicial Magistrate was deputed for the purpose and
identification parade of the currency was conducted. We are
anxious to know that when the FIR was silent regarding the
numbers and denominations of the snatched amount and
when the amount was arranged within a short span of time
by PW Ilyas for the complainant, then how the amount
could validly be identified. The prosecution failed to
establish the factum of identification of the amount and
even the statement of PW Ilyas cannot be taken against the
convicts/appellants as his name nowhere figures in the
report. This is on record that at the time of recovery the
amount was not sealed into parcels and when so, it cannot

be determined that in fact the amount recovered was the
-12-

amount snatched. This is alarming that the recovered
amount was put to identification after a sufficient long time
despite the fact that PW Ilyas was very much present in the
village and this conduct of the witnesses tells otherwise, so
we feel no hesitation to hold that the amount was planted to
strengthen the case of the prosecution.

8. The Investigating Officer went to the spot,
recovered three empties of 30 bore and prepared the site
plan on his personal observation as the witnesses were in
the hospital. PW Farid Khan was taken to the spot on
28.8.2015 and on his pointation addition was made to the
site plan in respect of the place occupied by the unknown
accused at the time of incident. This was on 20.10.2015 that
on pointation of the complainant Muhammad Naeem, the
unknown accused were named and the points added on
pointation of PW Farid Khan were confirmed. The
prosecution could not explain that wherefrom the
complainant gathered the names of the accused when the
appellant/convict Sir Syed had not disclosed the same and
when the record was silent in that respect.

9. It was stressed by the learned counsel for the
complainant that the convict/appellant was arrested and a
30 bore pistol was recovered from his possession which
was dispatched to the laboratory for comparison wherefrom
a positive report was received and to him, this alone is

sufficient to hold the convict/appellant responsible. We
-13-

cannot accede to the submission so made, as the pistol and
empties were recovered on 17.8.2015, whereas these were
received to the laboratory on 25.8.2015, after a considerable
delay. The prosecution did not bring anything on record
that in whose custody the incriminating articles were lying
and that who took it to the Forensic Sciences Laboratory for
comparison Neither the Moharrir of the concerned police
station was examined nor the official who took it to the
laboratory. We afraid, that the laboratory report in this
respect cannot advance the case of the prosecution and this
piece of evidence cannot be relied upon.

In case titled: Hayat Ullah Vs. The State

(2018 SCMR 2092), it was held that:-

Much reliance was placed on the
recovery of pistol from the appellant
and empty from the place of occurrence,
we observe that the empty was
recovered on 11.02.2006 and pistol was
recovered on 22.02.2006 and till the
recovery of the pistol the empty was not
sent to the firearm expert and the empty
and the pistol both remained together in
the Malkhana and ___ thereafter
transmitted to the office of the Forensic
Science Laboratory. So the recovery is
inconsequential. Even otherwise
recovery alone is not sufficient for
conviction and it is always termed as a
corroborative piece of evidence. It is
settled law that one tainted piece of
evidence can't corroborate another
tainted piece of evidence.

10. The prosecution mainly relied upon the
identification of the accused and so did the trial Court, but

it is yet to be tested as to whether the convicts/appellants
-14-

were seen at the time of occurrence and as to whether any
description was given in the FIR. The question as to
whether the witnesses could identify the convicts/appellants
at the time of occurrence can better be answered if both the
FIR and supplementary statement of witnesses are placed
together and on doing so, this Court reaches to the
conclusion that the convicts/appellants were not identified
by the witnesses at the time of the occurrence and the
supplementary statement was in fact a dishonest
improvement to create a link between the occurrence and
the appellants. The glaring contradictions between the two
documents exposed the honesty of the witnesses and the
conscious attempt by the police to persuade the
complainant to change his earlier stance. The
convict/appellant Sir Syed was arrested on 17.8.2015,
whereas his identification parade was conducted on
04.9.2015. the convict Sir Syed was repeatedly taken to
custody and was in the police lockup for long time so there
is every possibility of his having been shown to the
witnesses and that was the reason that at the time of
identification, he raised objection that while in lockup he
was shown to the witnesses and even the Judicial
Magistrate in whose supervision the identification parade

was conducted admitted the same.
-15-

In case titled Muhammad Afzal alias

Abdullah and others Vs. The State and another (2009
SCMR 436), it was held that:-

“It is also explicit on record that prior
to holding of the identification test
accused persons had complained to
P.W.7, the Magistrate, who had
supervised the identification test that
they were shown to the identifying
witnesses and the Magistrate in the
course of his statement, at the trial, has
in unequivocal terms admitted that he
had received such complaint. Another
fact which impairs evidentiary value to
the identification test is that accused
persons were produced before P.W.7
initially on 3-11-2000 but the test was
put off and was conducted on 7-11-
2000 as a result of freshly made
application dated 6-11-2000 and no
reason whatsoever for the delay was
shown. In the circumstances the
possibility that the test was delayed
purposely in order to show the accused
persons to the identifying witnesses,
could not have been ruled out. The
evidence of identification, in the
circumstances, was of no help to the
prosecution”.

Convict Salim Gul and Afshan were arrested
on different dates and after a long time their identification
was conducted but the record is still silent as to how, who
and when they were introduced by names in the case and
yet again no statement in this respect was recorded. Though
the identification parade was conducted through the
witnesses, but none of the witness gave specific role to any
of the appellant at the time of occurrence and even they did
not specify that who out of the accused snatched. the

amount and that what was the accused whose face got
-16-

exposed at the time of grappling. The witnesses frankly
conceded in their Court statements that they did not
remember the kind of clothes the convicts/appellants were
wearing at the time of identification. They further stated
that the dummies arranged for the purpose were of different
heights and body structure and they even admitted that
some of the dummies were having beards and some not,
when this was the situation then how this Court will rely
upon the identification parade where no rule and procedure
was followed.

In the case titled Ghulam Rasul and others

Vs. The State (1988 SCMR 557), it was held that:-

“Role. of accused at the time of
commission of the offence was not
described by the witnesses, it has held
that evidence of witnesses identifying
accused in such identification parade
had lost its efficacy and therefore
could not have been relied upon. In a
number of cases it has been laid down
by this Court that identification test in
the absence of description of the
accused in the F.LR. is of no value.
Reference in this regard may usefully
be made to the cases report as (i)
Ghulam Qadir v. The State 2008
SCMR 1221, (ii) State/Government of
Sindh v. Sobharo 1993 SCMR 585 and
(iii) Ismail and another v. The State
1974 SCMR 175”.

11. The prosecution witnesses remained
inconsistent throughout and nothing was brought on record
which could connect the convicts/appellants with
commission of the offence. Judged from all angles and

considered from all aspects after fair appraisal of evidence,
-17-

we are of the firm and considered view that the prosecution
has miserably failed to establish its case against the
appellants. Resultantly, these appeals are allowed and the
convicts/appellants are acquitted of the charges and they are
to be released forthwith if not required to be detained in
connection with any other criminal case. The connected
criminal appeal, bearing Cr.A. No.299-B/2016, filed by the
State, stands dismissed as the appeals of the convicts/

appellants have been allowed.
