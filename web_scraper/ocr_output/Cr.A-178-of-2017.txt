8. It is evident from record that on
31.08.2015 at about 21:00 hours the
complainant Saeed-ur-Rehman, PW-7 reported
the matter to Mohtashim Mian, IHC,
PW-10 at emergency ward of Dargai
hospital to the effect that after Isha prayer
when his son left the mosque at about 20:30
hours, he heard a sound of firing. When
he reached near the house of Umar Rehman,
he found his son injured and soaked in blood.
With the help of the locals, the injured was
put in a Suzuki Pick up and was brought to the
hospital. In the hospital, his son succumbed to
the injuries. The complainant in this report did

not charge anyone for the murder of his son.

9. On the following day of the
occurrence i.e. 01.09.2015 the complainant
had recorded his statement under section 164
Cr.P.C wherein the present appellant was

charged for the murder of the deceased.

10. The prosecution case mainly rests
on the statements of the eye-witnesses Nosher

Ali, PW-6, Ali Rehman, PW-8, the

NAWAB~ DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
sa

complainant Saeed-ur-Rehman, PW-7 and the
judicial confession recorded by the appellant
before the Judicial Magistrate Dargai, PW-4
allegedly on the following day of his arrest i.e.
on 03.09.2015.

11. Since the most important
evidence against the present appellant is his
confession before the Judicial Magistrate,
which was allegedly recorded on _ the
following day of his arrest i.e. on 03.09.2015,
therefore, first we take the same for our
discourse. We have carefully perused the
memorandum of questionnaire, the contents of
confession and the certificate appended with
the said confession. In the memorandum of

questioner Ex. PW-4/1 in reply to a question

answer was “vu: ..>”. Similarly, in response
to a question regarding his period of custody,
he has stated that he remained in the police
custody for 2 days. The certificate, Ex. PW-
4/3 along with the confessional statement, Ex.

PW-4/2 shows that he was produced on 12:00

NAWAB_ DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
P.M before the Judicial Magistrate and his
confession was recorded at 12:15 P.M. Thus,
only 15 minutes were given to him for
wondering/thinking. The Investigation Officer,
PW-10 in his  cross-examination has
confirmed/admitted that he was never asked by
the Judicial Magistrate for the medical
examination of the accused/appellant and after
recording his confessional statement the
accused was handed over to him at 01:00 o
clock.

12. Although, according to card of
arrest, Ex. PW-10/6 the appellant was shown to
have been arrested on 02.09.2015 and was
produced before the Judicial Magistrate on
03.09.2015, however, not only in the
memorandum of questioner the appellant has
stated that he remained in police custody for the
last 2 days but the alleged eye-witness Ali
Rehman, PW-8 before the Court has
stated/confirmed that when they had charged
the present appellant for commission of offence,
the present appellant was already arrested by
the police. It is evident from record that the

statement of the said eye-witness PW-8 was

NAWAB_ DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
EN

recorded on the following day of the occurrence
i.e. on 01.09.2015. Thus, there is serious doubt
on the date of arrest of the present appellant.
We have no doubt in our mind that a promptly
recorded confession by accused even if it is
retracted in later stage of the proceedings is a
sufficient ground for conviction of the accused
provided the conscience of the Court is satisfied
that the said confession was voluntary and true
and corroborating by other evidence.

13. The learned Judicial Magistrate
has recorded the confession of the
accused/appellant in a very casual manner.
When in response to a question regarding the
voluntariness of his confession, the answer of
the appellant was in negative then it was
incumbent upon the learned Judicial Magistrate
to have attended the appellant very seriously.
He should have provided him a very conducive
atmosphere thereby removing all kind of fear
from his mind and should have further inquired

about the nature of undue influence and

NAWAB DB: Mr, Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Re)

temptation, which he had complained in his
reply. However, to the contrary, the learned
Judicial Magistrate had provided only 15
minutes to the appellant for thinking over the
matter and only after just 15 minutes his
confessional statement was recorded. Not only
his confessional statement was recorded in a
very casual manner but the custody of the
accused as evident from the statement of the
Investigation Officer, PW-10 was given to the
police official after recording the confessional
statement, which is another serious irregularity
raising a serious question on the voluntariness
of the appellant to confess his guilt. Thus, this
kind of confession was never accepted by the
superior Courts. In this regard, reliance is placed
on the judgment of Honourable Supreme Court of
Pakistan titled “Asif Mahmood vs the State
(2005 SCMR 515)”, wherein it was held that:-

Confessional statement for being relied upon should

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-10-

not only be true, voluntary and believable but should

be without fear, favour or any inducement.

In respect of return of accused to
police custody after recording his confession,
wisdom is derived from the judgment of august
Supreme Court of Pakistan titled “Muhammad
Pervez_and others v/s The State and others”
(2007 SCMR_ 670)”, wherein it was observed
that:- Accused, after recording of confessional
statement were handed back to police, such
type of confession was irrelevant. Accused
remained in police custody before and after
recording confession for 24 hours and
Magistrate had taken only one hour to record
confession of the accused, such type of
confession would not fall in the category of
voluntary confession.”

Thus, the confession of the

accused does not appear to be voluntary.

NAWAB DB: Mr, Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan

14. The evidentiary value of this
confession can be viewed yet from other angle.
Since the said confession was retracted,
therefore, the same would require further
corroboration from the record qualifying to be a
valid ground for conviction. In this regard,
reliance is placed on the judgment of the
Hon’ble Apex Court titled “Nadir Hussain v/s
The Crown (1969 SCMR_ 442), wherein it was
held that:- “Retracted confession should not be
acted upon unless corroborated in material
particulars,”

This view was also affirmed by the

august Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled

“The State through A.G. then the N.W.F.P

now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa v/s Waqar Ahmad
1992 SCMR_ 950”, wherein it was observed

that:- “Though it was not a rule of law that
confession whether retracted or not could not
be the sole basis for conviction but principle of

procedure and rule of caution required that a

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
=i

retracted confession must be supported by
some other connecting evidence.”

It was further held in case titled

“

‘Bahadur Khan vs. The State” reported as
PLD 1995 S.C. _336 __ that:-“Retracted

confession has to be accepted only if it is
corroborated by clear, cogent and independent

evidence.

15. In order to trace the other
corroborative piece of evidence, we move
forward to the ocular testimony of the two
witnesses, Nosher Ali, PW-6 and Ali Rehman,
PW-8. Since the statements of these alleged
eye-witnesses of the occurrence were recorded
on the following day of the occurrence,
therefore, the same are to be considered with
due caution and care and to be thoroughly
scrutinized and it is to be seen as to whether
their testimony in the circumstances of the case
is reasonable, probable or plausible and could
be relied upon in respect of guilt of the present
appellant. In this regard, wisdom can be drawn
from the judgments of august Supreme Court
of Pakistan, wherein it was held that

credibility of a witness becomes highly

NAWAB_ DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
ie

-13-

suspicious if his statement is recorded with
delay without offering any plausible
explanation, reliance can be placed on the
case law cited as “Muhammad Sadiq vs the

State” (PLD 1960 Supreme Court 223

“Tarig Gul vs Ziarat Gul (1976 SCMR 236),
“Muhammad _Igqbal_vs_the State” (1984

SCMR_ 930), “Haroon alias Harooni vs the

State and another” (1995 SCMR_ 1627) and

“Muhammad _Khan’s case _vs_ _ Maula
Bakhshah” (1998 SCMR 570).

16. Ali Rehman, PW-8 is the driver of
the Suzuki Pick up, in which the deceased and
his father the complainant were taken to the
hospital. This Ali Rehman is the cousin of the
deceased. In his statement, he has stated that he
is plying a Suzuki vehicle for earning his
livelihood. At about 8:30 P.M he was coming
back to his house and when reached at the spot,
he heard the sound of firing and thus parked his
vehicle, in the headlights of his Suzuki vehicle
he saw the appellant running towards the
graveyard along with the pistol. Hence, he put
the deceased with the help of other people in his

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
af

=f4.-

Suzuki and took him to the hospital. Thus,
despite the fact that the deceased was his cousin
and the complainant was his uncle in the way he
did not disclose the said incident so that the
present appellant could be charged immediately
for the murder of deceased. His this conduct is
unusual and as such his delayed statement is not
confidence inspiring and it will be highly unsafe
to rely on his statement for awarding
punishment to the appellant.

17. Similarly, the other alleged eye-
witness Nosher Ali, while appearing as PW-6
has stated that on 31.08.2015 at about 8:30
hours he along with Manzoor Alam and the
appellant Umar Hayat were sitting in his
shop/Cabin. In the meanwhile, when the
deceased Qari Ubaid-ur-Rehman came to his
Cabin, the appellant started firing at him and
thereafter he decamped towards the graveyard.
However, he did not accompany the deceased to
the hospital. In his cross-examination, he has
admitted that he had also recorded statement
before the Magistrate and in the said statement
he has stated that he did not know the accused

and he was told about the incident by Manzoor

NAWAB_ DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
215%

Alam. Thus, this glaring contradiction/improvement
in his statement also makes him an untruthful
witness.
18. The close perusal of the aforesaid
statements not only shows their unnatural
conduct but their statements appear to be
unreasonable, improbable and not plausible.
Thus, it would be very dangerous to rely on the
testimony of such witnesses. In this regard,
reliance is placed on the judgment of august
Supreme Court of Pakistan titled “Saifullah v/s
The State (1985 SCMR 410), wherein it was
held that:- “Both eye-witnesses real brothers
inter se and uncles of the deceased. One
showing extraordinary strange conduct as
close relative after having been nephew
murdered and other tried his best to suppress
facts which he had mentioned in his earlier
statement thus proving that it was an un-
witnessed occurrence. Accused acquitted in
circumstances”.

The same ratio further reflects in
case titled “Haroon alias Harooni_v/s The

State (1995 SCMR_1627), wherein it was

observed by the Hon’ble Apex Court that:-

NAWAB_ DB: Mr, Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-16-

“Statement of a_ witness must be in
consonance with probabilities fitting in the
circumstances of the case and also inspire
confidence in the mind of a reasonable
prudent man. If these elements are present,
then the statement of the worst enemy of an
accused may be accepted and relied upon
without corroboration, but if these elements
are missing, then statement of a pious man
may be rejected without second thought.”
19. In view of the above it appears that
the occurrence was un-witnessed and thus the
only piece of evidence with the prosecution
against the present appellant is the confessional
statement of the accused/appellant and the
recovery of fire arm weapon i.e. 30 bore pistol
through recovery memo Ex. PW-9/1 on
pointation of the appellant. As far as the
confessional statement of the appellant is
concerned, we have already discarded the same
from consideration in the preceding Paras.
Regarding the recovery of fire arm
weapon suffice it to mention that the very date
of arrest of the appellant is shrouded in serious

doubts then how can the said recovery be relied

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-17-

upon. Even otherwise, it is settled law that the
recovery of crime weapon etc. are always
considered to be a corroborative piece of
evidence and such kind of evidence by itself is
not sufficient to bring home the charges against
the accused especially when the other
material/evidence  put-forward by the
prosecution in respect of guilt of the
accused/appellant has already been disbelieved.
In this regard, reliance is placed on the

judgment of the august Supreme Court of

Pakistan titled Imran Ashraf and 7 others vs
the State" (2001 SCMR 424 ), wherein it was
held that:- "Recovery of incriminating articles
is used for the purpose of providing
corroboration to the ocular testimony. Ocular
evidence and recoveries, therefore, are to be
considered simultaneously in order to reach for
a just conclusion."

Likewise, if any other law is
needed on the same analogy, reference can be

placed on the judgment of the Hon’ble Apex

Court titled "Dr. Israr-ul-Haq vs Muhammad

Fayyaz_and_another" (2007 SCMR_ 1427)

wherein it was observed that:-''Direct evidence

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
ome

o4

"

|e

-18-

having failed, corroborative evidence was of
no help. When ocular evidence is disbelieved
in a criminal case then the recovery of an
incriminating article in the nature of weapon
of offence does not by itself prove the
prosecution case.

20. In view of the above discussion,
we are of the absolute view that the prosecution
has failed to prove its case against the
accused/appellant beyond any shadow of doubt;
therefore, his conviction cannot be maintained,
resultantly, we accept this appeal by setting
aside his conviction and sentence recorded by
the learned trial Court through the impugned
judgment dated 27.07.2017 and acquit him of
the charges levelled against him, by extending
him the benefit of doubt. He be set free
forthwith, if not required in any other case.

21. These are the reasons of our short
order of even date.
