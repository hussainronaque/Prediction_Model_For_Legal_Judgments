WIQAR_ AHMAD, J.- According to prosecution

story, as narrated in FIR (Ex.PA), it was on
15.05.2016 at 09:30 hours when complainant of
the case namely Mst. Shehnaz Bibi (PW-09)
while reporting the crime to Munir Ahmad (PW-
06) at Emergency Ward of DHQ_ Hospital
Abbottabad alleged that on the fateful day at
09:00 hours her deceased son (Muhammad
Qasim) had been going to market and when he
reached near house of Muhammad Nazir (PW-
10), there Muhammad Nazir had been altercating
with Muhammad Iqbal (appellant). The latter had
made firing upon Muhammad Nazir (PW-10) and
her son Muhammad Qasim (deceased than
alive), as a result of which, her son had received

injury on his head. As per crime report, when the
injured was being shifted to hospital, he had
succumbed to the injuries and died on the way.
The occurrence was stated to have also been
witnessed by Muhammad Awais (PW-11) and
Muhammad Nazir (PW-10) beside other people
present at the spot. On report of the complainant,
Murasila (Ex.PB) was drafted by Munir Ahmad, S!
(PW-06) which was sent to Police Station,
whereupon the ibid FIR (Ex.PA) was registered.

2. After completion of investigation, challan
was submitted before learned trial court.
Appellant was put to trial before the court of
learned Additional Sessions Judge-lV / Judge CP/
JC Abbottabad in case FIR No. 235 dated
15.05.2016 registered under Section 302 PPC at
Police Station City Abbottabad. Formal charge
was framed against appellant, to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order to
prove its case, prosecution produced twelve (12)
witnesses, whereafter accused was examined
under Section 342 Cr.P.C. He denied the
allegations and professed innocence, however,
he neither opted to be examined on oath nor
produced evidence in his defence. After having

been found guilty for committing murder of
oe)

deceased Qasim Khan, at the conclusion of trial,
he was convicted under Section 302 (b) PPC and
sentenced to life imprisonment besides being
burdened with compensation amounting — to
Rs.5,00,000/-, payable to legal heirs of deceased
under Section 544-A Cr.P.C or in default of suffer
further six (06) months S.l, vide impugned
judgment dated 29.11.2021. He has also been
convicted under Section 324 PPC for attempting
at the life of Nazir Knan and sentenced to ten (10)
years R.| with a fine of Rs.1,00,000/- or in default
to suffer three (03) months S.1. All the sentences
were ordered to run concurrently with benefit of
Section 382-B Cr.P.C. Since the complainant has
also filed Criminal Revision No.15-A/2022 for
enhancement of sentence of the appellant,
therefore, we propose to decide both these
matters together through this single judgment.

3. We have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the parties as well as learned
Assistant Advocate General and gone through the
record.

4. Perusal of record reveals that prosecution
has been relying upon eyewitness account of the

occurrence offered by Muhammad Nazir (PV-10)
and Muhammad Awais (PW-11). The
corroboratory evidence included recovery of
weapon of offence on pointation of the appellant
and its matching report with the empties
recovered from the spot.

5. Complainant of the case was not an
eyewitness. She was mother of the deceased,
who was examined as PW-O9. In her first report
as well as in examination-in-chief she has stated
that her son had left his house for the market on
15.05.2016 at 09:00 hours and when he had
reached near house of one Muhammad Iqbal,
there Muhammad Nazir (PVV-10) and appellant
(Muhammad Iqbal) had been altercating with
each other. Appellant was further alleged to have
made firing as a result of which her son Qasim
Khan (deceased) got hit on his head. The
occurrence was also stated to have been
witnessed by Muhammad Awais (PW-11), beside
Muhammad Nazir (PW-10). She was_ briefly
cross-examined but nothing could be brought
from her mouth, showing existence of any
malafide or previous enmity with the appellant.
Muhammad Nazir was examined as PW-10. He

has stated in his examination-in-chief that
an

appellant had beaten wife and children of the
witness, a day before the occurrence i.e. on
14.05.2016 regarding which he had _ also
submitted an application in the police station, a
copy of which was exhibited as Ex.PW-10/1. He
has statedly left his house on 15.05.2016 at 09:00
hours and while going towards his under
construction house, he had met Muhammad Iqbal
(appellant) who had felt enraged and threatened
him due to lodging of report against him.
Appellant was also alleged to have started firing
at the witness, one of which had hit the deceased
on his head, resulting into his death. He has also
stated that mother of the deceased reached at the
place of occurrence thereafter she had been
informed about the occurrence and she had also
subsequently lodged report at DHQ Hospital, after
shifting of the deceased to hospital. In the cross-
examination, main focus of the cross-examiner
had been on the fact that this witness had not
stated in his 161 Cr.P.C statement that appellant
had threatened him and that he had _ not
mentioned in his 164 Cr.P.C statement that the
other PW Muhammad Awais had also witnessed

the occurrence. Except suggestions and_ its
6

denial, nothing beneficial to the case of appellant
could be solicited from his mouth by the cross-
examiner. So far as not naming other eyewitness
in 161 Cr.P.C statement is concerned, it is
important to be noted that presence of said PW
had been mentioned by complainant while
lodging first report of the occurrence. The inquest
report also indicated his presence at the time of
handing over dead body of the deceased at the
hospital. In the site plan, Investigating Officer of
the case has also marked his presence at point
No.3. The site plan had also been prepared on
joint pointation of both the eyewitnesses.
Statement of one of the eyewitness namely
Muhammad Nazir (PW-10) had been recorded
under Section 161 Cr.P.C on the first day of
occurrence while statement of Muhammad Awais
(PW-11) had been recorded by the Investigating
Officer on second day of occurrence. In such
circumstances, mere omission to name the other
PW in 161 Cr.P.C statement of Muhammad Nazir
(PW-10) would not make much _ difference.
Statement of other eyewitness namely,
Muhammad Awais has also remained fully

consistent and confidence inspiring. Presence of
both the PWs stood well established. Their
testimonies have also remained consistent inter
se regarding the mode and manner of
occurrence. Same is also corroborated by arrest
of the accused on the day of occurrence
alongwith a licensed 30-bore pistol recovered
vide recovery memo Ex.PW-4/1. Two empties of
30-bore, recovered vide recovery memo Ex.PW-
6/2 from the spot, had also been sent to FSL on
15.05.2016 for the purpose of comparison, report
received therefrom was in. affirmative and
providing sufficient corroboration to case of
prosecution.

6. Medico-legal report was also supporting
case of prosecution. Dr. Syed Imtiaz Shah while
deposing as PW-05 has stated that deceased had
been brought before him on 15.05.2016 at 10:30
hours by Constable Zubair No. 05 and that on his
examination he had found the following injuries

on his person;

Injuries.

1. An entry wound of 1 x % inches with
fractured of under lying bond in
present over the left forehead. 3 x %
inches above the left eye brow with

oozing of fresh blood with inverted
margins. Under lying bony crepitus is

felt

2. An exit wound of % x ¥% inches is
present over the scalp in occipital
region just to the right of mid line of
occipital region. Everted margins with
brain matter coming out of the exit
would. Oozing of fresh blood on exit

wound

Peri orbital blackening around both

eyes and swelling. ”
7. It was a case of single accused to whom
complainant had not been inimical earlier. No
reason existed why should he be substituted for
the real culprit. Substitution in such like cases is a
rare phenomena. Reliance may here be placed
on judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court of
Pakistan delivered in the case of “Muhammad
Sadiq Vs. The State” reported as 2022 SCMR
690. Evidence of prosecution has remained fully
consistent against the appellant, establishing his
culpability beyond reasonable doubt. Case of the
prosecution was supported by medico-legal
evidence and also corroborated by evidence of
recovery of weapon of offence and its matching
FSL report. The learned trial court has rightly

found him guilty for commission of the offence
and accordingly convicted him under Section 302
(b) PPC.

8. There remains no doubt about the criminal
liability ensued by the appellant for committing
Qatl-e-Amd. As per story of prosecution, he was
not having any motive for killing the deceased
and had in fact been aiming his pistol on
Muhammad Nazir (PW-10) for killing him but due
to fate or missing of fire the deceased had been
done to death. He had in fact intended to kill
Muhammad Nazir but had killed deceased Qasim
in the affair. It was a case of transferred malice
for which legislature has already put in place
Section 301 PPC. Said provision of law being
relevant here is reproduced for ready reference;

“301. Causing death of person
other than the person whose death
was intended:

Where a person, by doing anything
which he intends or knows to be
likely to cause death, causes death
of any person whose death he
neither intends nor knows himself to
be likely to cause, such an act
committed by the offender shall be
liable for Qatl-e-Amd.”

9. Law has left no room for doubt that if a

person intends killing of one person but kills
another as the result of firing so made, he shall
be treated to have committed Qatl-e-Amd of the
deceased. “Where a defendant intends to kill or
cause serious injury to one victim, VI” as held by
Supreme Court of United Kingdom in the case of
R Vs. Gnango reported as 2012 SCMR 1442 “but
accidentally kills another, V2, he will be guilty of
the murder of V2. The basis of this liability is
customarily described as "transferred malice",
although a better description might be
“transferred mens rea". The doctrine applies to
secondary parties as it does to principal
offenders. Thus if D2 attempts to aid, abet,
counsel or procure D1 to murder V1 but D1,
intending to kill V1, accidentally kills V2 instead,
D2 will be guilty of the murder of V2.”

10 Similarly, Hon'ble Supreme Court of
Pakistan while delivering its verdict in the case of
“Abdullah Khan Vs. Sahib Dad Khan & others”
reported as 1977 SCMR 186 has also held;

“Sahib Dad fired thrice and this showed
that he was determined to kill PW
Abdullah. Rafiullah, however, intervened
and he was hit and killed. The facts of
the case, therefore, fall squarely within
the terms of Section 301 of the Code,

and Sahib Dad must be held guilty of
murder unde Section 302 of the Code
although he never intended to_ kill
Rafiullah.”

Further reliance in this respect may also be
placed on the judgment rendered by Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India in the case of “Jagpal
Singh & others Vs. The State of Punjab” reported
as AIR 1991 SC 982 as well as in the case of
“Shankarla Kachrabhai & others Vs. State of
Guyarat” reported as AIR 1965 SC 1260.

11. In light of what has been discussed above,
the sentence awarded to appellant under Section
302 (b) PPC by learned trial court was also found
in accordance with law and resultantly, this
appeal being without any substance is hereby
dismissed.

12. So far as criminal revision bearing No. 15-
A/2022 is concerned, it is important to be noted
that appellant was not having a motive for
commission of the offence. He had just made two
(02) fires and that also at an occasion where PW.
Muhammad Nazir had been altercating with him.
We have no record regarding the sort of
altercation they were having at the relevant time
In such circumstances, award of alternate

punishment of life imprisonment was found
justified and the revision petition, mentioned
above, was found divested of any force which is
also dismissed.
