JUDGMENT

LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- Through this
judgment, we shall also decide the
connected writ petition bearing No.3163-P
of 2022 titled “Muhammad Jalal-ud-Din Vs.
Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa etc” as
common question of law is involved in both
the petitions wherein the petitioners, who
are practicing lawyers of this court, have
called in question the legality of Notification
No. SO(Cabinet) /AD/Cabit/Misc/M.Fr/2022
dated 19.08.2022 (the Notification)
whereunder in exercise of powers conferred
by Section 196 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898 and in pursuance of
Cabinet's decision dated 18.08.2022, the
Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has

empowered Mr.Munir Ahmad, Additional
Assistant Commissioner, D.I.Khan to
receive written complaint(s) from
Mr.Ali Amin Gandapur (MNA) or any other
interested party and require the local police
to lodge FIR(s) under Sections 108A, 153A
and 505 PPC read with any other enabling
provision of law and to sanction and pursue
such cases within his respective jurisdiction
w.e.f. 18.08.2002.

2. Petitioner Mr.Shabbir Hussain
Gigyani, advocate himself argued his case
while petitioner Jalal-ud-Din Khan, advocate
was represented by Mr.Naveed Akhtar,
advocate who submitted before the court
that the Notification has been issued by the
Provincial Government of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa with mala fide intention only to
register criminal cases against its political
opponents for which it has not been
authorized under the law. They submitted
that while issuing the Notification, the true
intent, purpose and the spirit of law has not
been taken into account by the respondents
and on the intervention of a Member of
National Assembly, the government
machinery has been set into motion and that

too on the wrong side. While summing up
their cases, they submitted that the
Notification be set aside for its being illegal
and unconstitutional and be declared as of
no legal effect.

3. As against the above, the learned
Advocate General submitted at the bar that
the petitioners have no locus standi to
impugn the Notification through their writ
petitions as they are not aggrieved persons
within the meaning of Article 199 (1) (a) of
the Constitution. The learned AG further
submitted at the bar that the Notification has
legally been issued by the Government of
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa quite in line with the
provisions of Section 196 of Cr.P.C. The
learned Advocate General also argued that
the Notification has been acted upon as
pursuant to the authorization of Mr.Munir
Ahmad, Additional Assistant Commissioner,
D.I.Khan, many FIRs have been chalked out
against many persons under various
sections of law who have not impugned their
such nominations and that the petitioners
cannot plead their case. In support of his
arguments, the learned AG placed reliance

on the following case laws:-
“2019 P.Cr.L.J. 275, PLD 2017
Islamabad 64, 2016 P.Cr.L.J. 502,
2012 P.Cr.L.J. 396, 2012 P.Cr.L.J.
923, 2011 P.Cr.L.J. 1631, 2010
YLR 987, 2010 P.Cr.L.J. 1809,
2008 YLR 387, 2007 P.Cr.L.J.
342, PLD 2005 Lahore 631, 2003
YLR 3137, 1997 P.Cr.L.J. 836,
1992 P.Cr.L.J. 2346, 1993 SCMR
71, 1990 P.Cr.L.J. 1708, 1976
P.Cr.L.J. 184 and PLD 1960
Lahore 434.”
4. We have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the parties and also gone
through the Notification.
5. First of all, we would meet the
objection of the learned Advocate General
that the petitioners have no locus standi to
impugn the Notification through their writ
petitions as they are not aggrieved persons.
No doubt, any personal or financial interest
of the petitioners has been affected by the
Notification so as to give them the status of
an aggrieved party within the meaning of
Article (1) (a) of the Constitution of Pakistan,
1973 but when a government functionary
opts to act in derogation to what it has been
mandated for and such transgression prima

facie seems to be a mockery of law of the
land then in such a situation strict and
narrow interpretation of Article 199 (1) (a) of
the Constitution, as argued by the learned
Advocate General, is to be avoided in order
to preserve the law of the land and a citizen
cannot be restrained from approaching a
High Court for declaring the transgression of
law as unconstitutional and without any
lawful authority as law of the land is always
supreme and it is the duty of every citizen to
protect and defend it irrespective of the fact
that the transgression and departure from
law has not directly violated his personal
tights guaranteed to him under the
Constitution or any other law, therefore, we
turn down the objection of the learned
Advocate General over the locus standi of
the petitioners and hold that the petitions
have competently been filed.

6. Moving on to merit of the case, we
noted that the Notification was issued after a
decision of the Provincial Cabinet taken in a
meeting held on 17" August, 2022 which
decision is reproduced herein below:-

“Cabinet hereby unanimously
authorizes Mr.Munir Ahmad, the
Additional Assistant Commissioner
{s

D.I.Khan under Section 196 Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and
other enabling provisions to receive
written complaint(s) from Mr.Ali
Ameen Gandapur or any other
interested party and require local
police to lodge FIR(s) under
Section 108A, 153A read with
Section 505 Pakistan Penal Code,
1860 together with any other
enabling provisions of law against
aforementioned accused persons
and to sanction and pursue their
case under the relevant faw.”

7. It is pertinent to mention that in the
referred meeting of the Provincial Cabinet,

Mr.Ali__Ameen__Gandapur, __an__§ MNA
(underlining supplied) also participated on
special invitation who, per decision of
meeting, copy of which was provided to the
court at the time of hearing, informed the
cabinet members as under:-

“Mr.Ali Amin Gandapur, who
attended on special invitation, while
fully seconding the Chair, informed
the House that it is really
unfortunate that although it has
been a known narrative of PDM
leadership to malign Armed Forces
publicly, the media cells of PDM
parties and federal government are
trying hard to create an impression
that PTI is against the Armed
forces. He lighted that PTI
Government before imported regime
change had most cordial working
relationship with Armed Forces. It
was their strength but unfortunately
now a negative impression has
successfully been created.”
8. Record shows that pursuant to the
decision of the Cabinet mentioned above
and in light of the Notification, many FIRs
were then registered on the complaint of
Mr.Munir Ahmad, Additional Assistant
Commissioner, D.I.Khan against stanch
political opponents of the Provincial
Government and that too for the acts
allegedly done or committed beyond the
territorial jurisdiction of the complainant,
copies of which FIRs were provided to the
court at the time of hearing by learned
counsel for petitioner Mr.Jalal-ud-Din,
advocate which are placed on file.
9. For better understanding of the issue,
we deem it appropriate to reproduce
Section 196 of Cr.P.C. here-in-below:-

“196. Prosecution for offences
against the State. No Court shall
taken cognizance of any offence
punishable under Chapter VI or IXA
of the Pakistan Penal Code (except
section 127), or punishable under
section 108A, or section 153A, or
section 284A, or section 295A or
section 505 of the same Code,
unless upon complaint made by
order of, or under authority from,
the Central Government, or the
Provincial Government concerned,
or some officer empowered in this
behalf by either of the two
Governments.”
10. The ibid section of law envisages that
no court shall take cognizance of any
offence mentioned therein unless upon the
complaint made by order of or under the
authority from, the Federal Government or
Provincial Government concerned or some
officer empowered in this behalf by either of
the two Governments. Not only Section 196
Cr.P.C. is meant for prosecution of the
offence against the State by an officer
authorized by either of the two Governments
but nowhere it is stated in the section that
recourse to it can be made by an officer on
the complaints presented to it by a private
person, who in the instant case is
Mr.Ali Ameen Gandapur. So the Notification

smacks mala fide on the part of the
respondents as through it they intend to
come very hard on their political opponents
by using the State machinery as is evident
from para 8 and 11 of the minutes wherein
names of the political opponents have been
mentioned against whom FIRs were
registered subsequently.

11. The decision made in the Cabinet
meeting and issuance of the Notification is
nothing but colourable exercise of the
administrative powers and authority
conferred on the Provincial Cabinet under
the law which deviation on no count could
be countenanced by this court in the
exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction as
same appears to be a sheer mockery of law
and misuse of official powers.

12. For what has been discussed above,
we admit and allow both the petitions and
declare the Notification as __ illegal,
unconstitutional and of no legal effect and,

thus, set aside the same.
