JUDGMENT
WIQAR AHMAD, J.- My this order is directed to
dispose of Criminal Appeal bearing No. 15-M of 2019
. filed by the appellant/convict namely Anwar Syed as
well as the connected Cr.R No. 4-M/2019 filed by the

complainant.

2. The appellant is aggrieved of his
conviction and sentence recorded vide judgment dated |
04.01.2019 of the Court of leamed Additional Sessions
Judge, Dir Lower ‘at Samarbagh, whereby he was
convicted and sentenced as follows;
i, Under section 334 PPC to undergo 4 years
simple imprisonment and to pay Arsh

within the meaning of section 33 7-X PPC
amounting to Rs, 10,27,968/- half of the

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad

C

existing Diyat amount which shall be paid
to the injured/complainant in lump sum.
i. The appellant was also extended the benefit

of Section 382-B Cr. PC.
3. Report of the occurrence was lodged by
the injured/complainant namely Imran Khan at Munda
Hospital, District Dir Lower on 19.05.2017 at 20:15
hours. The complainant stated in his initial report that
he left his house for his fields on the day of occurrence
at evening time. Their neighbor Anwar Syed son of
Hakim Syed (appellant/convict) appeared in the
meanwhile and came close to the complainant at the
place of occurrence. He started verbal altercation with
the complainant and was further alleged to have caught
his left ear, cut it with a knife and fled away along with
severed ear of the complainant. The occurrence was
stated to have been witnessed by father and brother of
the complainant namely Asadullah beside other people
present on the spot. The momentous verbal altercation
was stated to have been motive behind the occurrence
and the accused/appellant was charged for the
commission of the offence. After receiving opinion of
the Doctor Zeeshan (Medical Officer, Munda Hospital
PW-9), FIR bearing No. 306 was registered on
19.05.2017 under section 334 of the Pakistan Penal
Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as ‘PPC’) at Police

Station Munda, District Dir Lower.

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
4. Investigation in the case was kicked off.

The knife used in the occurrence was produced by
father of the victim/complainant before the police,
which was taken into possession vide recovery memo
Ex PW 6/1. Same was also sent for report of forensic
‘experts, which report was received in affirmative and
was produced in evidence as Ex PW 10/4. The accused
was arrested and after conducting other necessary
proceedings, investigation was completed and
complete challan was put in Court. On submission of
complete challan in the Court, charge was framed
against the appellant/convict on 11.07.2017. The case
was then posted for evidence of the prosecution. The
prosecution recorded statements of eleven (11)
witnesses. Statement of Wahidullah Constable (PW-3)
was recorded for the second time also. On conclusion
of ‘prosecution evidence, statement of accused was
recorded under section 342 Cr. PC. At conclusion of
proceedings in the case, the learned trial Court
convicted the accused/appellant and awarded him

punishment as per the sentence reproduced above.

5. Learned counsel for the accused/appellant
submitted during the course of his arguments that
statements of the eye-witnesses were contradictory to
each other, which have caused substantial dents in the

case of prosecution and therefore the accused/appellant

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
4
was entitled to acquittal. Learned counsel laid stress on

the fact that PW-4 had not stated in his statement that
how was his ear taken back from the accused/
appellant, which makes the case doubtful. Learned
counsel added that PW-4 as well as PW-5 had stated in
their statements that they had been working in their
fields at the relevant time but same has not been
mentioned in the site plan and therefore, both the eye-
witnesses were not believable. Learned counsel further
stated that father of the victim/complainant namely
Shah Wazir Khan was not produced and therefore, this
witness was withheld, which would carry an adverse
inference under Article 129 of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat
Order, 1984, Learned counsel also drew attention of
this Court towards statement of the Doctor recorded as
PW-9 and stated that the whole organ of hearing had
not been chopped off, therefore an offence of Itlaf-i-
udw under section 334 PPC was not made out of the
record and conviction of the accused/appellant under

the said provision was not justified.

6. Learned counsel for complainant
submitted in rebuttal that the prosecution has been able
to prove the case against the accused/appellant beyond
any shadow of doubt. He further added that both the
eye-witnesses have stood the test of cross-examination

and no discrepancy could be found in their statements.

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
5
He further submitted that the prosecution has not only

proved the case against the accused/appellant but
would also pray for enhancement of the sentence for
the reason that the crime had been committed in a cruel
and gruesome manner. The learned , Asst:A.G
appearing on behalf of the State also supported the

arguments of the private counsel for complainant.

7. I have heard arguments of learned counsel
for the parties as well as the learned Asst:A.G for the

State and perused the record.

8. Perusal of record reveals that the injured/
complainant was examined as PW-4 in support of the
case of prosecution, wherein he has narrated the
episode of the occurrence in his examination-in-chief.
He was extensively cross-examined but nothing
substantial could be extracted from his mouth during
the course of cross-examination. Same was the case
with the other eye-witness examined as PW-5, who has
also stood the test of cross-examination successfully.
Both the witnesses have also stood consistent and no
contradiction could be pointed out in the two
statements on the material aspects of the case. The
assertion of learned counsel for the accused/appellant
that PWs 4 & 5 had not been shown in the site plan to

be working in the fields, is concerned; it is important to

Abdut Sabooh/* {S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
6
be noted that presence of the PWs have duly been

shown in the site plan. Every detail of the activities of
PWs was not supposed to have been recorded in the
site plan. This is sufficient that their presence at the
time and place gets support from the site plan. The
complainant has only stated that he had been present in
the fields, but had not stated anything about his work
in the fields. In such a situation, the object of the

learned counsel is not found well placed.

a It is true that it had not been brought in
evidence as to how was the severed ear retrieved from
the convict/appellant. The learned trial Court has
observed in its judgment that the said fact had been
mentioned in the statements of PWs Ahmadistan and
Bakht Rawan recorded under section 161 Cr. PC but
they had been abandoned, therefore the said fact could
not be brought in evidence. Doctor namely Nadar
Khan (ENT Specialist) was examined as PW-11, who
has given the detail of injuries caused to the
victim/complainant. The statement of Doctor fully
supported the version of complainant viz-a-viz cutting
of the left ear of the victim/complainant. The
description of the surgical procedure given in Ex PW
11/1 however makes mention of an effort for
implanting the ear, which could not succeed. The

discharge slip Ex PW 11/2 also contains mention of

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
7
some surgical procedure in the said respect. Retrieval

of the ear and its patching up was though a relevant
fact but not that much material so as to dislodge the
otherwise proved case of the prosecution. It was an act
after the commission of the offence and the same
would not therefore adversely effect the case of
. prosecution. The offence was complete with cutting of
the ear which stands proved from the statements of
eye-witnesses as well as Doctor and _ other

corroboratory pieces of evidence.

10. Learned counsel for the accused/appellant
had referred to the statement of Doctor Nadar Khan
(PW-11), wherein he had given details of the parts of
ear canal. Part of the said statement of Doctor given in
cross-examination is reproduced hereunder for ready

reference;

The contention of learned counsel for the

accused/appellant that the entire hearing system had

Abdul Sabooh/* {S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
not been amputated, therefore the same does not
amount to an offence under section 334 PPC, is
difficult to be agreed with. There is no doubt that the
outer part of the organ of ear is a component of the
entire system of hearing gifted to humankind by
Almighty Allah, but for constitution of an offence of
Itlaf-i-udw under section 334 PPC, it is not required
that the entire system of hearing, is rooted out. The
“offence of Itlaf-i-udw has been defined under section
333 PPC. The said definition is relevant for the present
discourse, it is therefore, reproduced hereunder for
ready reference;

“333, Itlaf-i-udw:

Whoever  dismembers, amputates,
severs any limb or organ of the body of
another person is said to cause Itlaf-i-
udw”.

In the said definition, the legislature has
cautiously used the words dismembers, amputates and
severs (any limb or organ of the body), ‘The three
connotations are of void amplitude and cover all cases
of dismembering of an organ or amputation of an
organ of human body. The word ‘dismembers’
indicates that an organ is not completely chopped off
but is disfigured materially and part of it may then
remain on the body. This shows that for constitution of
Itlaf-i-udw, it is not essential that it has to be

established that the entire system of hearing is

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
9
destroyed. The word any limb or organ of the body is

also significant in this respect, which would no doubt
include an ear. The definition does not require that an
entire faculty is made ineffective or all the components
forming the system are rooted-out. The connotations
“any limb or organ of the body” have been used in
normal english meaning and cannot be given Scientific
definition of an entire system of a human body
performing a particular function. An ear as it is taken
in common parlance and as it exists in its visible form
has always been taken to be an independent limb or
organ by its dictionary meaning. In Al-Munjid (ai)
Arabic Dictionary, meaning of Udw (»#<) has been

given as follows;
"Uf 6S Werle otis tguaatlg gaiaall"

Similarly, the word ‘limb’ used in
section 333 PPC carries the following meaning,
according to Webster’s New World Dictionary (Fourth
Edition); |

“a part that extends from the trunk of a
body, as an arm, leg, or wing”

The word ‘organ’ has been defined in the

same dictionary as follows;

“In animals and plants, a part
composed of specialized tissues and
adapted to. the performance of a
Specific function or functions.”

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-10
The wordings of section 333 PPC is thus
of void amplitude and would no doubt cover the
cutting of an ear which would also mean the outer and
visible part of the system of hearing. The word ‘ear’
shall also be taken in this case in its normal
etymological meaning and cannot be given its medical

or scientific meaning.

11. In the case of Saifullah vs the State
reported as 2003 SCMR 496, nose of the victim had
been chopped off and mutilated with the knife by the
appellant in the case, and the sentence of conviction
under section 334 PPC was maintained by the Hon’ble
Apex Court. Reliance in this respect is also placed on

the case of Abdul Wahab and others vs The State

and others reported as 2019 SCMR 516.

12. Motive could not be established by the
prosecution in the case. The complainant has stated in
his first report as well as his testimony in the Court that
motive for the occurrence was momentous verbal
altercation. It has also been stated by him that the
accused/appellant had brought the knife with him
before coming to the spot, and thus whatever motive
had been existing, it was prior to the occurrence and
was not developed at the time of occurrence. The said

motive remained hidden but non-existence and non-

Abdul Sabooh/* . (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Abmad
11
disclosure of the motive has been held by the august

Supreme Court of Pakistan to be digestible and not
fatal to the case of prosecution. The Hon’ble Apex

Court in the case of Nawaz Ali and another vs The

State reported as 2001 SCMR 726, held as follows;

“8. It has been held time and again by
this Court that in case of lack of motive
altogether or if the prosecution is
unable to prove motive for murder, it
does not affect the imposition of
normal penalty of death in murder
case, if the prosecution otherwise has
been able to prove its case against the
accused beyond reasonable doubt.
- Reference. may be made to Ahmad
Nisar v. The State (1977 SCMR 175)
wherein this Court observed as
follows:

"Generally speaking motive, more or
less, is a guess on the part of the
prosecution witnesses. What truly
motivates an accused person to commit
a crime is best known to him and not to
others, Absence of motive or failure on
the part of the prosecution to prove it
does not, therefore, adversely affect the
testimony of the eye-witnesses if they be
otherwise reliable.”

_ Reliance in this respect is also placed on

the case of Talib Hussain and others vs The State

reported as 1995 SCMR 1776 and the case of

Muhammad Akbar and another vs The State

reported as PLD 2004 Supreme Court 44 as well as

the case of Khurram Malik and others vs The State

and others reported as PLD 2006 Supreme Court 354.

13. The prosecution has been able to prove
the case against the accused/appellant through reliable

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B,) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
12
and confidence inspiring evidence. The two eye-

witnesses of the occurrence i.e. PW-4 and PW-5 were
found believable. The statement of Doctor recorded as
PW-11 also fully supported the version of the
prosecution. The corroboratory pieces of evidences
also lend an additional support to the case of
prosecution. The prosecution was not under an
obligation to produce all of its witnesses as held by the

Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of Khushi

Muhammad vs The State reported as 1983 SCMR

697. The learned trial Court has therefore rightly found
the accused/appellant guilty of the commission of
offence and has rightly convicted him under section
334 PPC, but the sentence awarded to him requires
reconsideration. The accused/appellant was given a
sentence of four (04) years imprisonment as Ta’zir
along with payment of amount of Arsh as
Rs. 10,27,968/-, half of the existing Diyat amount of

Rs. 20,55,936/-.

14. Sub section 2 of section 337-N PPC
provides for the cases, where the sentence of
imprisonment may be awarded in addition to payment
of Arsh. The said provision being relevant is

reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

337-N._Cases in which qisas for hurt
shall not be enforced:

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
(2)Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Chapter, in all cases of hurt, the
Court may, having regard to the
kind of hurt caused by him,
in addition to payment of arsh,
award ta'zir to an offender who is a
previous convict, habitual or hardened,
desperate or dangerous criminal or the
offence has been committed by him in
the name or on the pretext of honour;

Provided that the Ta’zir shall not be
less than one third of the maximum
imprisonment provided for the hurt
caused if the offender is a previous
convict, habitual, hardened, desperate
or dangerous criminal or if the offence
has been committed by him in the
name or on the pretext of honour.

15. The non obstante clause contained in
subsection 2 of section 337-N PPC gives the said
provision an overriding effect over all the other
provisions dealing with the offences of hurt contained
in Chapter XVI of the PPC. The wordings of the
reproduced provision of law is itself clear and lays
down in express words that in all cases of hurt, the
normal punishment to be awarded to an offender is
payment of Arsh or Daman and a sentence of
imprisonment can only be awarded in the case, where
an offender is found to be a previous convict, habitual
or hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal or an
offence has been committed by him in the name or on
the pretext of honor. In quite a similar case of Abdul

Wahab and others vs The State and others reported

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
14
as 2019 SCMR 516, the Hon’be Apex Court held as

follows;

“It was alleged that Abdul Wahab

appellant had then cut the right ear of
Ahmed Ali (PW2) with the use of a

knife and there was some doubt

available on the record as to whether

the ear was cut off through the use of a

knife or it was bitten off by the said

appellant, Be that as it may, there was

no serious motive on the part of the

appellants and the asserted motive had

never been proved through any

independent evidence. Admittedly the

appellants were not previous convicts

and there was no evidence of previous -
involvement of the appellants in any

criminal case. It is not denied that no

issue of honour was involved in

commission of the relevant offence by

the appellants. In this view of the

matter in terms of section 337-N (2) the

appellants could not have been

punished with imprisonment by way of
Ta'zir.”

In this respect, reliance is also placed on
the case of Haii Maa Din and another vs The State
and_ another reported as 1998 SCMR 1528 and the

case of Mazhar Hussain vs The State and another

reported as 2012. SCMR 887. The prosecution has
failed to bring on record any previous involvement of
the accused/appellant in any offence whatsoever. He is
a man of 60 years old. Real motive has not been
disclosed by the prosecution as well. In such
circumstances, the accused/appellant cannot be alleged
as habitual or hardened, desperate or dangerous

offender. The sentence of imprisonment of four (04)

Abdul Sabooh/* . (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
15
years awarded to him by the learned trial Court is

therefore not found justified. Whereas, criminal
revision bearing No. 4-M of 2019 filed by the
complainant for enhancement of conviction is also

found meritless and accordingly dismissed.

16. In light of what has been discussed above,
the appeal in hand is partially allowed to the effect that
the accused/appellant is found liable to payment of half
of the amount of diyat as Arsh amounting to
Rs. 10,27,968/-. The sentence of imprisonment of four
(04) years awarded to him by the learned trial Court is

set aside.

17. These are the reasons for my short order

of even date, which read as follows;

“For reasons to be recorded later, vide
my detailed judgment of today, the
appeal in hand is partially allowed to
the extent of modifying the sentence to
the effect that the accused/appellant is
found liable to payment of half of the
amount of Diyat as Arsh amounting
to Rs. 10,27,968/-. The sentence
of imprisonment of four (04) years
awarded to him by the learned
trial Court is set aside. The accused/
appellant, who had been released on
bail and is present in Court is ordered
to be taken in custody and be kept in
jail till the realization of the amount of
Arsh, which is equal to half of the
Diyat.” :
