SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J:- Through this
judgment we shall also decide the connected
Criminal Revision bearing No.93-P/2020 titled
“Dost Muhammad etc Vs. Asar Khan etc.” as
both the matters have arisen out from one and
the same judgment, dated, 15.08.2020, of the
learned Additional District and Sessions Judge,
Charsadda at Tangi, delivered in case FIR
No.466 dated 22.08.2016 registered under
sections 302/324/34 PPC at police station,
Tangi, whereby, the appellants have been
convicted under section 302 (b) PPC and
sentenced to imprisonment for life as Tazir and
to pay Rs.1,000,000/- as compensation to the
legal heirs of each deceased, within the

meaning of Section 544-A Cr.P.C. They have
also been convicted under section 324 P.P.C
and sentenced to undergo rigorous
imprisonment for a period of five years. Both
the sentences were directed to run
concurrently, while benefit of section 382-B
Cr.P.C. was extended to the convicts.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on
22.08.2016, complainant Nazeer reported the
matter to the local police in the Casualty of
Tangi Hospital to the effect, that he received
information about cutting of poplar trees by
Asar Khan and Sartaj (accused-appellants) in
his fields. On such information, he along with
Inayat-ur-Rehman, Gul Rahman, Jawad and
Fawad rushed to the spot and tried to restrain
them from cutting the poplar trees, upon which
the accused-appellants got annoyed, took their
weapons lying there and started firing at them
with the intention to kill them. Resultantly, he
sustained injuries on his chest, while Inayat-ur-
Rehman and Gul Rahman got hit and died on
the spot. On report of the complainant, present
case was registered against the accused.

3. On arrest of the appellant, and

completion of investigation, complete challan
was submitted before the court of competent
jurisdiction. The accused were charge sheeted
to which they did not plead guilty and claimed
trial. As such the learned trial court was
pleased to direct the prosecution to produce its
evidence. In order to prove its case,
prosecution produced and examined as many
as 13 witnesses, whereafter statements of the
accused were recorded wherein they professed
their innocence but did not opt to record their
statements under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. On
conclusion of trial, the learned trial court held
them guilty and as such they were convicted
and sentenced, whereagainst they have filed
the instant appeal.

4. The learned counsel for parties as well
as the worthy Additional Advocate General,
were heard at length and with their able
assistance the record was scanned through.

5. The tragic incident claimed the lives of
three innocent souls and that the matter was
reported by one of the deceased (then injured).
The deceased after receiving firearm injuries
were shifted to Tehsil Headquarter Hospital,

Tangi, where one of the deceased (then
injured) reported the matter to the local police
and the relevant police officer drafted the
murasila on report of the complainant, and,
thereafter the injury sheets and inquest reports
of the deceased were prepared. The dead
bodies of the deceased and the _ injured
complainant were referred to the doctor where
the complainant was examined and his medico
legal certificate was prepared. Keeping in view
the nature of injuries, the injured complainant
was referred to Lady Reading Hospital,
Peshawar for further treatment and
management, whereas autopsy on the dead
bodies of the deceased was conducted. The
investigating officer, after receiving copy of the
FIR visited the spot and on pointation of the
eyewitnesses prepared the site plan. During
spot inspection the _ investigating officer
collected blood-stained earth from the places of
the deceased and also took into possession the
cut poplar trees. It is pertinent to mention that
during spot inspection, the investigating officer
collected 06 empties of 9-MM pistol and 03
empties of .30 bore pistol from the respective

places of the accused. The collected empties
were sent to the Fire Arms Expert and a report
was received telling that six empties of 9 MM
bore were fired from one and the same weapon
and 03 empties of .30 bore were created from
one and the same _ pistol. The _ injured
complainant could not survive and at last died
on 24.08.2016 and in that respect the relevant
entries were made. The accused were arrested
and at the time of arrest, from their respective
possessions, pistols were recovered and in that
respect 02 different FIRs were registered under
section 15 of The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Arms
Act, 2013. The trial commenced and on
conclusion of the trial, the accused were
convicted vide the impugned judgment.

6. As in the instant case 03 parsons lost
their lives and that the matter was reported by
one of the deceased (then injured), so this
court is to see as to whether the approach of
the learned trial court was correct and as to
whether the learned trial court fully appreciated
the evidence on file. As in the instant case
apart from the report of the deceased (then
injured), the prosecution has two witnesses,

who also witnessed the incident and who
accompanied the dead bodies to the hospital,
so in the attending circumstances of the
present case, we deem it essential to scan
through the record of the case in order to
ascertain; as to whether the learned trial court
was justified in convicting the appellants and as
to whether the evidence on file has properly
been appreciated. As in the instant case the
prosecution has two eyewitnesses and the
statement of a dying man, so extra care is
needed to appreciate the available evidence,
more particularly the statements of the
witnesses, so that guilty could be punished and
the innocent could be rescued.

7. The points for determination before this
court are; as to whether the incident occurred
in the mode, manner and at the stated time; as
to whether the eyewitnesses witnessed the
incident and that who shifted the dead bodies
of the deceased and the injured complainant to
the hospital; as to whether the _ incident
occurred because of cutting of the poplar trees
and that the same were taken into possession
by the investigating officer; as to whether the

deceased (then injured) was capable to talk
and that his report inspires confidence. There is
no denial of the fact that both, the accused and
the complainant party are closely related,
having joint property in the vicinity, duly
cultivated by them and was in their possession.
The record further tells that poplar trees were
planted on the ridges ( 5 ) of the fields and
that it was because of storm that some of the
trees had fallen and the fallen trees were
claimed by the parties and to settle the dispute
several attempts were made, but to no avail.
The investigating officer when visited the spot
took the same into possession and he also
confirmed the same when his statement was
recorded before the learned trial court. The
investigating officer further confirmed that being
perishable item the same were returned on
superdari to the lawful owners. In order to
ascertain as to whether the incident occurred in
the mode, manner and at the stated time, we
deem it essential to go through the statement
of the eyewitness and to read his statement in
juxtaposition with the report made by the
deceased (then injured). The eyewitness was

examined as (P.W-11), who stated that on the
day of incident he along with deceased left his
house and reached to the spot/fields to restrain
the accused from cutting trees; that on
reaching to the spot, the deceased (then
injured) asked the accused to stop cutting
trees, as the matter is still to be resolved, which
infuriated the accused who picked up their
pistols and started firing at the complainant, the
deceased and the eyewitnesses as well; that
the complainant after receiving firearm injuries
fell to the ground and so the deceased,
whereas the eyewitnesses escaped unhurt
luckily; that the deceased (then injured) was
picked up from the spot, with the help of co-
villagers, shifted to the hospital, and thereafter
the dead bodies were brought to the hospital;
that the deceased (then injured) reported the
matter to which he verified and that he also
identified the dead bodies of the deceased
before the police at the time of report and
before the doctor at the time of post mortem
examination. This witness was cross-examined
on different aspects of the case but nothing
detrimental could be extracted from his mouth.

The witness remained consistent regarding the
manner in which the information was received
and regarding the manner in which he along
with others reached to the spot and entered
into altercation with the accused. As in the
instant case, on one hand we have the dying
declaration, whereas on the other the
statement of an eyewitness who witnessed the
incident, so we in order to ascertain as to which
one is nearer to the truth and which not, went
minutely through the report made by the
complainant and the statement of the
eyewitness, but we failed to notice substantial
contradictions, which would convince this court
that either the complainant was telling a lie or
that the eyewitness was not present on the
spot. The prosecution case gets support from
the fact that on one hand the deceased
received firearm injuries and also. the
complainant, whereas on the other the
investigating officer noted bullet marks on the
poplar trees. The recovery of blood-stained
earth from the spot and the collection of
empties near from the places of the accused,
are the circumstances which support the

prosecution case, more particularly, the place
10

where the incident occurred as is held in case
titled “Agil Vs. The State (2023 SCMR 831)”
which reads as:-

“During the course of proceedings,
the learned counsel contended
that there are material
discrepancies and contradictions
in the statements of the eye-
witnesses but on our _ specific
query he could not point out any
major contradiction, which could
shatter the case of the
prosecution. We may point out that
‘discrepancy’ has to be
distinguished from ‘contradiction’.
Contradiction in the statement of
the witness is fatal for the
prosecution case whereas minor
discrepancy oor _ variance’ in
evidence will not make the
prosecution case doubtful. It is
normal course of the human
conduct that while narrating a
particular incident there may occur
minor discrepancies. Parrot-like
statements are always discredited
by the courts. In order to ascertain
as to whether the discrepancy
pointed out was minor or not or
the same amounts to
contradiction, regard is required to

be made to the circumstances of
11

the case by keeping in view the
social status of the witnesses and
environment in which — such
witnesses were making _ the
statement. There are always
normal discrepancies, howsoever,
honest and truthful a witness may
be. Such discrepancies are due to
normal errors’ of observation,
memory due to lapse of time and
mental disposition such as shock
and horror at the time’ of
occurrence. Material discrepancies
are those which are not normal
and not expected of a normal

person.”

8. True that the matter was reported by the
deceased (then injured) and equally true that
despite the availability of an eyewitness the
eyewitness did not report, but this fact cannot
be counted to the benefit of the accused, rather
it helps the case of the prosecution, as non-
reporting of the matter by the eyewitness
confirms bona fide of the complainant and all
concerned. We are not ready to accept the
non-presence of the eyewitness on the spot, at
the time of incident and in the hospital when
the matter was reported. The record tells that

the eyewitness was very much present in the
12

hospital and that it was he who identified the
dead bodies of the deceased before the police
at the time of report and before the doctor at
the time of postmortem examination coupled
with the fact that he verified the report of the
complainant. It was voiced by the defence that
the complainant at the time of report was all
alone and that the attendance of the
eyewitness was procured at a belated stage. In
this respect the attention of this court was
invited to the murasila where the names of the
eyewitnesses were noted down in a different
fashion. It was submitted that keeping in view
the spaces at the tail end of murasila no
ambiguity is left that the latter portion was
written belatedly, that too, by the time when the
availability of the witness was procured. We are
not impressed with what was agitated before
this court, if we admit to what the learned
counsel submitted as correct then instead of
the injured complainant P.W Muhammad
Jawad would have reported, but besides his
availability he did not report and this conduct of
the witness by itself is sufficient to hold that it

was the injured complainant who reported the
13

matter. Not only the report, but the relevant
columns of the inquest reports and the post
mortem reports do confirm the availability of the
eyewitness in the hospital at the time of report.

9. We are conscious of the fact that in the
inquest reports of both the deceased neither
the FIR number, nor the sections of law, has
been mentioned so much so, the column
pertaining to the time of death has also been
left blank, but that by itself is not sufficient to
hold that preliminary investigation was
conducted and thereafter on arrival of the
eyewitness the report was made. In order to
resolve the controversy, we deem it essential to
go to the inquest report of the deceased (then
injured), where too the FIR number and
sections of law have not been mentioned, and
the same confirms that non-mentioning of
same in all the inquest reports was either the
incompetency of the relevant police officer or
that it went unnoticed. If the case had been
preliminary investigated then in the inquest
report of the deceased (then injured) the FIR
number and the sections of law must find

mention as the FIR had already been
14

registered and this by itself is a sufficient proof
that neither preliminary investigation was
conducted nor the attendance of the
eyewitness was procured at a belated stage.
The defence could not convince that either the
incident did not occur in the mode, manner and
at the stated time or the report was not made
soon after the dead bodies were shifted to the
hospital. In order to resolve this controversy
and to answer the eagerness of the defence,
we deem it essential to go through the
statement of the concerned police official to
whom the report was made, and also that of
the doctor who examined the deceased (then
injured). The scribe was examined as (P.W-5)
who stated that while on Gasht he received
information regarding the incident; that soon
after receiving information he reached to THQ
Hospital Tangi, where the deceased (then
injured) reported the matter; that after the
report was made, he prepared the _ injury
sheets, inquest reports. The _ injured
complainant was referred to the doctor for his
medical examination and the dead bodies of

the deceased for postmortem examination; that
15

after the report was made the same was
explained to the complainant, who thumb
impressed the same and the eyewitness
verified the report. This witness was put to the
test of searching cross-examination in respect
of the arrival of the dead bodies to the hospital,
the place where he received information and
the time he arrived to the hospital and the
matter was reported by the complainant, but
the defence failed to extract anything from his
mouth, detrimental to the case of the
prosecution. The doctor confirmed to what the
scribe disclosed. The doctor was examined as
(P.W-8) who stated that the deceased (then
injured) was produced to him by the police; that
he examined the injured and prepared his
medico legal certificate. The doctor was
questioned regarding the exact time of arrival
and examination of the injured, who disclosed
that the injured was brought at 09:05 AM and
this time gets its confirmation from the medico
legal certificate. When the statements of the
witnesses i.e. the scribe and the doctor are
read in juxtaposition, no ambiguity is left that

the matter was reported at the stated time and
16

that the injured was examined by the doctor,
soon after his arrival. An attempt was made to
convince this court that preliminary
investigation was conducted, and that the
matter was never reported by the deceased
(then injured), but by the eyewitness when his
attendance was procured, but this limb of the
argument failed to convince, as the quick
succession of events has left no ambiguity that
the matter was promptly reported and that the
eyewitnesses were present at the time of
incident and in the hospital when the report
was made.

10. The lack of previous blood feud between
the parties is a circumstance which excludes
the possibility of substitution. As the motive
was an altercation on the fallen trees, so there
was hardly an occasion for the complainant to
substitute innocent for the actual culprits. We
are not convinced that either the complainant
or the eyewitness would make substitution, that
too, when his real father and real brother are
killed. In the like circumstances, substitution is

the rarest phenomenon, as is held in case titled
17

“Aqil Vs The State” (2023 SCMR 831) which
reads as:-

“A witness who is a natural one
and is the only possible eye-
witness in the circumstances of a
case cannot be said to be
"interested". In the present case,
the eye-witnesses, one of whom
was an injured eye-witness have
spoken consistently and cogently
in’ describing the manner of
commission of the crime in detail.
The testimony of an injured eye-
witness carries more evidentiary
value. The Court is not persuaded
that their evidence is to be
discarded merely because they
happen to be related witnesses.
Learned counsel for the petitioner
could not point out any plausible
reason as to why the complainant
has falsely involved the petitioner
in the present case and let off the
real culprit, who has committed
murder of her mother and sister.
Substitution in such like cases is a
rare phenomenon. The medical
evidence available on the record
further corroborates the ocular
account so far as the nature, time,
locale and impact of the injuries on
the person of the deceased and

injured is concerned. Even
18

otherwise, it is settled law that
where ocular evidence is found
trustworthy and confidence
inspiring, the same _ is_ given
preference over medical evidence
and the same alone is sufficient to

sustain conviction of an accused.”

11. Our attention was brought to one of the
eyewitness who despite of his availability was
not produced, and as such the defence tried its
best to reap the harvest, by inviting the
attention of this to Article 129 (g) of the
Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, for drawing a
negative inference, but we are not impressed,
as a real son would in all circumstances
support the case of the prosecution, that too,
when his real father was killed in the incident.
In such eventuality, this court is not in a happy
mood to draw an adverse inference and Article
129 (g) would not apply in the circumstances of
the present case.

12. The report of the complainant is of prime
importance as it was he who reported the
matter in injured condition and on his death
now that has gained the status of a dying
declaration. This court is to see as to whether

the same inspires confidence and is in
19

harmony with the eyewitness account and the
physical circumstances of the present case, as
it is essential that all the three must make an
organic whole. We are conscious of the fact
that in the early ages much respect was paid to
the statement of a dying man with the sole
reason that a dying man will not tell a lie, but
with each passing day the behavior changed
and so the moral values, so the need was felt
that in order to award conviction there must be
corroboration and as such in present era the
dying declaration is considered and declared a
weak kind of evidence, which needs
independent corroboration and it by itself is not
sufficient to convict. As in the instant case the
determining factor is the dying declaration, so
this court is constrained to reconsider and re-
evaluate its worth in light of the collected
evidence. The most. crucial point for
determination before this court is, as to whether
the deceased (then injured) was capable to talk
and as to whether it was the deceased (then
injured) who reported the matter. The scribe left
no ambiguity when he appeared before the

learned trial court. He was questioned
20

regarding the consciousness of the deceased
(then injured) and also regarding his capability
to talk who confirmed that before making the
report the injured complainant was conscious
and was oriented in time and space. This
witness further confirmed that he put some
rational questions to the complainant who
replied rationally, and so after getting satisfied
regarding the capacity of the complainant, he
drafted the murasila. The scribe at the time of
report succeeded in getting a certificate from
the doctor and the doctor also endorsed the
murasila, where the factum of _ the
understanding and capability to talk, of the
deceased (then injured) was confirmed. In
order to resolve this controversy we went
through the statement of the doctor who
examined the injured. The doctor was
examined as (P.W-8) who confirmed that at the
time of examination the injured was conscious
and capable to talk and that the same has been
mentioned in the medico legal certificate,
prepared by him. We cannot forget that the
incident occurred on 22.08.2016, the deceased

(then injured) remained hospitalized till his
21

death on 24.08.2016. The survival of the
deceased (then injured) for long two days is
another circumstance that confirms, that at the
time of report the complainant was capable to
talk. The doctors were cross-examined
regarding the seat of injuries, the organs which
got injured in the incident and thereafter the
capability of the deceased (then injured) to talk
who remained consistent regarding the
consciousness and_ orientation of the
complainant. The dying declaration gets further
support from the statement of the eyewitness,
and when both are read in juxtaposition it
confirms our belief that the prosecution
succeeded in establishing its case against the
appellants to the hilt. Had this been the sole
statement of the complainant then both the
courts i.e. the learned trial court and this court
would take extra care but when the eyewitness
account could not be shattered then little was
left for both i.e. the learned trial court and as
well this court to take a different view, as is
held in case titled “Hasnat Ahmad Vs. The
State_and_ another” (2023 YLR 585) which

reads as follows:-
22

“Dying declaration can be made
the basis for awarding conviction
provided it is free from the menace
of prompting and tutoring and is
proved to have been made by none
other than the deceased himself.
The paramount reason for
attaching importance and
credibility to such a statement is
the presumption that a _ dying

person seldom lies.”

13. The medical evidence is in harmony with
the ocular account, as the seat of injuries on
the bodies of the deceased find support from
the site plan. The seat of injuries on the body of
the deceased confirms that they were fired
from the places assigned to the appellants and
that the same supports the case of the
prosecution. The medical evidence and ocular
account is in harmony and we could not see
any conflict between the two. We cannot forget
that medical evidence is confirmatory in nature
and the same is only and only pressed into
service when the ocular account fails, which is
not the case in hand.

14. The motive was alleged as a dispute
over the fallen trees and that the witnesses

succeeded in proving the motive and even the
23

investigating officer took into possession the
fallen trees which were later on returned to its
lawful owners by the court of competent
jurisdiction. We are fully convinced that the
prosecution succeeded in proving the motive
and that the same is a factor which can be
taken in support of the prosecution. There is no
cavil with the proposition that absence or
weakness of motive would hardly be a ground
for dislodging the prosecution case provided it
succeeds in bringing home guilt against the
accused charged.
15. The cumulative effect of what has been
stated above leads this court nowhere, but to
hold that the prosecution has succeeded in
bringing home guilt against the appellant and
that the impugned judgment is suffering from
no irregularity or inherent defects which could
call for interference. The impugned judgment is
well reasoned and the learned trial court fully
appreciated the evidence on file, which call for
no interference. The instant criminal appeal,
being bereft of any merit, is hereby dismissed.
Now diverting to Cr.R.No.93-P/2020,

suffice it to say that as the tragedy occurred
24

because of timely altercation between the
parties and it cannot be held with certainty that
the sole purpose was to kill, so in such
eventuality the approach of the learned trial
court is correct and that it properly appreciated
this particular aspect of the case. We are
confident in holding that the awarded sentence
is in accordance with law and in accordance
with the attending circumstances of the present
case, which hardly calls for interference. The
instant criminal revision failed to succeed, is

dismissed as such.
