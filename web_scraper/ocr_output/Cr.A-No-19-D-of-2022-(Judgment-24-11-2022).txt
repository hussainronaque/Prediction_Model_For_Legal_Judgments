SHAHID KHAN, J.- The appellant namely,
Hazrat Wali was booked in case FIR No.01, dated
07.01.2021, under Section 9(d) of K.P CNSA, 2019
& 11-N of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, of Police
Station C.T.D, D.I.Khan. He faced trial and on
conclusion of it, vide judgment, dated, 31.5.2022,
of learned Additional Sessions Judge-II/Judge
Special Court, D.I-Khan, convicted him under
Section 9(d) of K.P CNSA, 2019, and sentenced to
rigorous imprisonment for life with a fine of
Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees ten hundred thousand) or
in default thereof to further undergo S.J for six
months. However, benefit of Section 382-B Cr.PC

was extended to him. Thus, through the subject
-2-
criminal appeal, the appellant has assailed the

judgment of conviction, dated, 31.5.2022.

2. The prosecution’s case, as set forth in
the crime report, is that the local police received a
spy information, to the effect that international
smugglers, financed the terrorist organizations,
based on trafficking of narcotics and the funds so
generated is shared with the terrorists. Such an
organization intended a bid from Zhob to the
province of Punjab. To encash the same,
complainant Noor Aslam Khan ASHO alongwith
his team, on the fateful date, day & time
(07.01.2021 at 1600 hours), installed an improvise
barricade at Zhob-Dera Highway Road. In the
meanwhile, a single cabin Datsun pick-up bearing
registration No.C-6483/Bannu arrived at the spot. It
was intercepted on the pointation of informer. The
driver disclosed his name as Muhammad Iqbal and
the front seaters introduced themselves as
Muhammad Khan and Hazrat Wali (appellant).
Due search of the vehicle led to the recovery of
narcotics as charas, consists of 75 packets, and on
weighment, it was found as 90,000 grams. On
cursory interrogation, the appellant disclosed that

the narcotics belongs to one Sardar son of Nawab

-3-

Khan who financially support the terrorists and
recovered narcotics as charas was being smuggled
to district Khoshab. The event was reduced into
writing in the shape of murasila followed by formal
arrest of the accused and transmitted to the police
station for the registration of the event through

FIR.

3. It is highlighted that on completion of
investigation, challan was submitted against the
appellant and his co-accomplices Muhammad Iqbal
& Muhammad Khan in the Anti-Terrorism Court,
D.I.Khan. However, Sections 11-N & 7 ATA were
deleted and the case was transferred to the learned
Sessions Judge, D.1.Khan. It was entrusted to the
Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge-II/
Judge Special Court, D.I-Khan for disposal. The
appellant being juvenile, his case was separated
from the co-accused Muhammad Iqbal &
Muhammad Khan and challan under Juvenile
Justice System Act, 2018 was submitted against

him.

4, On commencement of trial, copies of
the evidence (oral and documentary) were

delivered to the appellant within the meaning of
-4-
Section 265-C Cr.PC, followed by, confronted with
the set of allegations through a formal charge. The
appellant denied the subject allegations, pleaded

not guilty and claimed trial.

5. The prosecution, to bring home charge
against the appellant, produced ten (10) witnesses
to substantiate its version. At the closure of the
prosecution’s account, the appellant was
confronted with the evidence so furnished through
formal questionnaires within the meaning of
Section 342 Cr.PC, to which he professed
innocence and claimed to have been falsely
implicated in the case. However, neither he wished
to be examined on Oath as required under Section
340(2) Cr.PC nor intended to produce evidence in
the defence. On conclusion of trial, scanning of
record with due assistance of learned defence
counsel and learned prosecutor, the learned trial
Court, vide judgment, dated 31.5.2022, convicted
and sentenced the appellant as mentioned above,

hence, he filed this appeal.

6. Arguments heard and record perused.

7. Close perusal of the impugned

judgment of the learned trial Court coupled with
-5-
the analysis of the evidence so recorded would
transpire that after the exercise of the seizure and
arrest of the appellant, exercise of required
documentation was carried, on the spot and the
murasila was transmitted to the police station for
the registration of the event. The alleged
occurrence of recovery of narcotics as charas,
intended to be transmitted to the desired
destination, took place on 07.01.2021. The record
speaks loud and clear that the bid in question was
intended in a single cabin Datsun pick-up bearing
registration No.C-6483/ Bannu (red in colour) and
on its arrival to the barricade, it was signalled to
stop, the driver introduced himself as Muhammad
Iqbal, whereas, the front seaters were Muhammad
Khan and Hazrat Wali. Search of the subject
vehicle led to the recovery of 75 packets of
narcotics as charas, kept in three plastic sacks
(gattu) and concealed in the quilts/blankets. Each
sack (gattu) contained 25 packets. On weighment
each packet was found to be 1200 grams, net

weighing 90,000 grams.

8. The IO (PW-4) disclosed that he
separated 5/5 grams charas from each packet as

samples of 5/5 for chemical analysis, prepared
-6-
docket for the chemical analysis of the parcels and
on completion of proceedings on the spot, returned
to the police station and handed over the case
property in shape of parcels to the Moharrir of the
police station for safe custody. It is transparent
from the account of the 1.0 (PW-4) the non
availability of Malkhana in the police station as he
conceded in his examination-in-cross that there is
no separate Malkhana of police station C.T.D. and
volunteered that recovered articles are used to be
kept in District Malkhana as a routine. He further
stated that he did not make his departure entry in
the daily diary of the P.S. He also stated that he
drafted application for sending the samples to the
FSL and admitted that in routine, a copy of
application for dispatching the parcels to the FSL,
is placed on judicial file, however, the same is not
available on the file at all. He further admitted that
Umar Khitab Moharrir of P.S C.T.D was not
examined by him till 14.01.2021. He admitted that
samples were received to the FSL on 21.01.2021
with the delay of 14 days. Umar Khitab S.I (PW-9)
stated that the I.O handed over to him the case
property which he entered in the relevant register

and on the same day the relevant parcels No.1 to 75
-7-
were handed over to the Constable Muhammad
Asghar No.1299 for chemical analysis. However,
stated in his examination-in-cross that there is
Maikhana of P.S. C.T.D. the parcels No.1 to 75
were not handed over to the Constable Muhammad
Asghar No.1299 on the same date. Samples were
handed over to Muhammad Asghar on 21.01.2021.
He further stated that Muhammad Asghar had
handed over the route certificate on 21.01.2021.
Muhammad Asghar FC No.1299 stated in his
statement that on 21.01.2021 he was handed over
parcel No.1 to 75 by the Moharrir of P.S. C.T.D,
D.L.Khan, which he took to FSL Peshawar for
analysis. The FSL report reveals that the samples
of narcotics as charas were received therein on
21.01.2021 i.e. after the delay of 14 days delay. In
depth perusal of the record would transpire that a
plausible excuse is neither part and parcel of the
investigation nor trial as none of the prosecution
witness either the seizure officer or the
Investigation Officer could justify the subject
delay. Irrespective of the fact that the samples and
the stuff might be in the safe hands and question of
replacement or otherwise may not strike the

prudent mind but it shall not skip the attention of
-8-
the Court that the subject irregularity and illegality
is not curable at all and it touches the very roots of
the prosecution’s case for the simple reason that
replacement, substitution or otherwise could no

way be ruled out.

9. The record is silent regarding the
protocols of drawl of samples followed by its safe
custody and in time transmission to the FSL for
analysis, the very inception of the case of the
prosecution is tainted with doubts. It is indeed
settled that the prosecution is under obligation to
establish the safe custody of the samples strictly in
accordance with law. The august Apex Court in

case titled, “Mst. Sakina Ramzan Vs. The State”

reported in (2021 SCMR 451), held that:-

“The chain of custody or safe
custody and safe transmission of
narcotic drug begins with seizure
of the narcotic drug by the law
enforcement officer, followed by
separation of the representative
samples of the seized narcotic
drug, storage of the representative
samples and the narcotic drug with
the law enforcement agency and
then dispatch of the representative
samples of the narcotic drugs to
the office of the chemical examiner
for examination and testing. This
chain of custody must be safe and
secure. This is because, the Report
of the Chemical Examiner enjoys
critical importance under CNSA
and the chain of custody ensures
im

-9-

that correct representative samples
reach the office of the Chemical
Examiner. Any break or gap in the
chain of custody i.e., in the safe
custody or safe transmission of the
narcotic drug or its representative
samples makes the Report of the
Chemical Examiner unsafe and
unreliable for justifying conviction
of the accused. The prosecution,
therefore, has to establish that the
chain of custody has _ been
unbroken and is safe, secure and
indisputable in order to be able to
place reliance on the Report of the
Chemical Examiner.”

Reliance is also placed on the
judgment of august Apex Court titled “Ishaq Vs.
The State” (2022 SCMR 1422), wherein it is held
that:-

(b) Control of Narcotic
Substances Act (XXV of 1997)---
---§.9--- Possession of narcotics---
Prosecution failing to establish safe
custody and safe transmission of
samples from the police to the
Forensic Science Laboratory---In a
case containing the said defect on
the part of the prosecution it cannot
be held with any degree of certainty
the prosecution had succeeded in
establishing its case against an
accused person beyond any
reasonable doubt.”

10. It was alleged by the prosecution that
the appellant was a front seater and on cursory
interrogation, he disclosed that the narcotics
belongs to one Sardar son of Nawab Khan, he

financially support the terrorists and recovered
-10-
narcotics as charas was being smuggled to district
Khoshab. But during the investigation an iota of
evidence has not been collected in respect of the
subject proposition. Likewise, none of the
prosecution’s witness on his turn could be able to
speak in this regard. Nothing as such had been said
by any of the prosecution witness about the
appellant having the knowledge about availability
of narcotic substance in the vehicle. As a matter of
fact no evidence worth its name had been brought
on the record to establish that the appellant had
conscious about availability of narcotic substance
in the vehicle in which he was travelling along with
its driver. The law is settled by now that if the
prosecution fails to establish conscious possession
or knowledge of the accused, in that regard then the
person cannot be convicted solely on the basis of

his availability inside a vehicle at the relevant time.

11. In view of the above, it can be safely
held that the prosecution could not discharge the
burden of proof and unable to establish the guilt of
the appellant and the learned trial Court has not
taken into consideration the above facts and

circumstances of the case in its letter & spirit,
-ll-
therefore, by convicting the appellant has fallen
into error.

12. It is cardinal principle of Criminal
Justice that every individual is presumed to be
innocent, unless proved guilty through strong,
cogent & worth reliable evidence. It is the bounden
duty of the prosecution to prove its case beyond
any shadow of doubt and if any reasonable dent or
doubt is found in prosecution case, the benefit of
the same is to be extended to the accused, not as a
matter of grace or concession but as a matter of
right. The cardinal principle of criminal
administration of justice is based on the concept of
justice in Islam which is to be observed more
consciously and carefully. Benefit of doubt of
features appearing in the case invariably, are
required to be given full effect while deciding the
ancillary matters in a criminal case. Benefit of
doubt, if any favourable to the accused cannot be

withheld in the exercise of discretion of the Court.

13. The prosecution is duty bound to
prove its case beyond any reasonable doubt and if
any single or slightest doubt is created, benefit of
the same must be extended to the accused and it

would be sufficient to discredit the prosecution
-12-
story. It is well embedded principle of criminal
justice that there is no need of multiple doubts in
the prosecution’s case, rather a single but
reasonable doubt arising out of the prosecution’s
evidence, pricking the judicial mind is sufficient
enough for acquittal of the accused. Reliance is
placed on a case law “Tariq Parvez Vs. The State”
(1995 S C M R 1345). The same principle has
been reiterated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

case of “Muhammad Akram Vs. The State” (2009

S CMR 230).

14. There is no second opinion about the
fact that the cardinal principle of justice always laid
emphasis on the quality of evidence which must be
of first degree and sufficient enough to dispel the
apprehension of the Court with regard to the
implication of the innocent persons alongwith
guilty one by the prosecution, otherwise, the
golden principle of justice would come into play
that even a single doubt, if, found reasonable would
be sufficient to record acquittal of the accused,
giving him/them benefit of doubt because bundle
of doubts are not required at all to extend the legal
benefit to the accused. In this regard, reliance is

placed on a view held by the Hon'ble Supreme
26/72

-13-
Court in the case of "Riaz Masih alias Mithoo Vs.

State (NLR 1995 Cr.SC 694).

15. For the afore-stated reasons, the
subject appeal is accepted, the impugned judgment
& conviction, dated, 31.5.2022, of learned trial
Court is set aside and the appellant Hazrat Wali is
acquitted of the charges levelled against him by
extending the benefit of doubt. He be set free

forthwith, if not required , in any other case.

16. By our short order of even date, we
had accepted the appeal of the appellant Hazrat Ali
and acquitted him of the charges levelled against

him. Hereinabove are reasons for the same.
