QAISER RASHID KHAN, J:- Accused-petitioner

Yaqoob Khan seeks his release on bail in case FIR No.57,
dated 28.09.2019, under Sections 302/148/149 PPC of
Police Station Bara, District Khyber, with the allegations
that he along with his absconding co-accused Fazal
Rehman had caught hold of Ijaz, brother of the
complainant, whereafter co-accused Zarwal, Zahoor and
Daud fired at him with which he was seriously injured and
later on succumbed to the injuries while being taken to the

hospital.

2. Arguments heard and the available record
perused.
3. Could the accused-petitioner run the risk to his

life by catching hold of the brother of the complainant
namely Ijaz when he was simultaneously fired at by three
persons with their respective firearms from a very close
proximity is indeed a question which certainly qualifies
the present case to one of further probe qua his guilt in the
commission of the offence. Thus taking a tentative
assessment of the available record, I hold the accused-
petitioner entitled to the concession of bail.

4. Accordingly, this petition is allowed and the
petitioner is admitted to bail provided he furnishes bail
bonds in the sum of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One lac), with
two sureties, each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
the Illaqa/Judicial Magistrate who shall ensure that the
sureties are local, reliable and men of means.

5. Needless to mention that the observations
recorded in this order are purely tentative in nature and

shall not prejudice the proceedings before the learned trial
