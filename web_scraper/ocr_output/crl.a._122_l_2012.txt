JUDGMENT

MAZHAR ALAM KHAN MIANKHEL, JUDGE-. The appellant
namely Muhammad Shoban Son of Niaz Ahmed Caste Rajput resident of
Chak No.75-C/TDA, Tehsil Karor, District Layyah alongwith Shafaqat Ali alias
Mithu and Muhammad Iqbal was booked in case FIR No.310 dated 1.10.2004
registered under Sections 302,324,34 PPC at Police Station, Fatehpur, Tehsil
Karor, District Layyah. on the report of Ghulam Abbas/complainant (PW-8)
son of Khursheed. On the day of occurrence at 8.00 am when the
complainant alongwith his brother Muhammad Ilyas (deceased) was going to
Addah Chak No.217/TDA, the appellant Muhammad Shoban, armed with

pistol, Shafaqat Ali @ Mithu, also armed with pistol, and Muhammad Iqbal
Crl.A.122-1/2012 a 2

empty handed intercepted them near a vacant plot of Mst. Mehr Jehan Sial.

Shafagat Ali @ Mithu raised an alarm of alert that they will teach lesson to

them for admonishing them in the evening a day before the occurrence,

whereupon the appellant Muhammad Shoban fired two shots on the person
of Muhammad Ilyas (deceased) which hit him on the front of his chest and
near left elbow joint. He fell down after receiving said bullet injuries.
Shafagat Ali co-accused then tried to fire upon the complainant but he
TAUenE hold of him. The appellant then fired at the complainant on the
direction of Muhammad Iqbal co-accused which hit him on the left leg
whereas the second fire was missed and instead of hitting the complainant
one Zahid Umar a passerby was hit. On hearing the fire shots, their father
Khursheed Ahmed and Muhammad Ramzan (PW-9) alongwith others were
attracted and on seeing them the accused decamped from the spot. Motive
for the offence was that a day before the occurrence Muhammad Ilyas
(deceased) had reprimanded the appellant and Shafaqat Ali @ Mithu as to
why they were wandering around his house. It was also alleged in the FIR
that the appellant had illicit relations with Mst. Nasreen Bibi sister-in-law

(Saali) of Muhammad Ilyas (deceased).

2: The appellant after registration of the case faced trial in the
Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Karor, District Layyah who after a
regular trial convicted the appellant under Sections 302 (b) PPC and
sentenced him to death with compensation under Section 544-A Cr.P.C. of
Rs.i1,00,000/- (one lac) to be paid to the legal heirs of the deceased and in
default of payment of the same the appellant to further undergo S.I. for six
months. The appellant was further convicted under Section 337-F (iii) PPC,

‘and was sentenced for two years R.I. with payment of Rs.25,000/- as

Crl.A.122-1/2012 (SF (0 4

Daman to each of the injured person in default of which the appellant was

ordered to be kept in jail till the payment is made.

3. The above conviction and sentences of the appellant were confirmed
by the High Court while dismissing his appeal vide impugned judgment dated

9.6.2010, hence the present appeal with leave of the court dated 23.5.2012.

We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant and Mr.
Ahmad Raza Gillani, learned Additional Prosecutor General, Punjab, Lahore.

4. Learned counsel for the appellant firstly tried to make out a case
for acquittal of the appellant on merits but when confronted with leave
granting order wherein learned counsel for the appellant at the very out set
had asked for reduction of sentence from death to imprisonment for life
instead of pressing his petition on merits, the learned counsel for the
appellant had no words to say much less its rebuttal. Perusal of the ocular
account furnished by the eye witnesses would also confirm the culpability of
the appellant for the commission of the offence for which he has been
charged. The medical evidence is also in full support of ocular account
besides the corroborative piece of evidence in the shape of recovery of four
empties and pistol and a positive report of Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL)
in this regard. The appellant even has not denied his presence at the spot at
the time of occurrence and took a plea of defence by firing at the deceased
after snatching a pistol from him but that plea of self-defence was not
established on the record and was rightly held by the trial court to be an
afterthought. By keeping in view the above, we can understand that the

appellant at the time of grant of leave to file appeal had in his mind the

above referred material so far that matter he straight away opted to ask for

reduction of his sentence.

Crl.A.122-L/2012 : \\ 4

Yes! The only aspect of the case which goes in favour of the appellant
is the motive part of the case. The motive alleged by the prosecution is of illicit
relations of the appellant with the sister-in-law (Saali) of the deceased and the
alleged words of reprimand by the deceased to the appellant and Shafagat Ali @
Mithu his co-accused in the evening of a day before the occurrence. The burden to
prove the motive part of the occurrence was upon the prosecution but record of the
case would reveal that the same though alleged in the FIR but has not been proved.
So mere alleging a motive would not be sufficient to accept and rely upon the
same. The law of the land in this regard is much settled by now that absence of
motive or absence of proof of the same would be a sufficient mitigating
circumstance to determine the quantum of sentence. We can lay hands on some of

the latest judgments of this court for a matter of reference i.e. Mst. Nazia Anwar v.

The State (2018 SCMR 911), Nadeem Ramzan vs. The State (2018 SCMR 149), Haq

WNadgeein Kailizedt) Vo

Nawaz vs. The State (2018 SCMR 21), Ghulam Muhammad vs. State (2017 SCMR

Ghulam Munaliiiiie!-—<

2048), Saif Ullah vs. State (2017 SCMR 2041), Waris Ali vs. The State (2017 SCMR

1572). So keeping in view the above discussion, we are of the considered view that
the prosecution has utterly failed to prove the motive so alleged in the FIR, benefit
of which for the purpose of quantum of sentence in this case will have to go to the
appellant and the appellant in the given circumstances, cannot be awarded major

penalty of death.

5, This appeal, in the circumstances, by maintaining the conviction
of the appellant under Section 302 (b) PPC, is partly allowed and sentence of
death is converted into life imprisonment. Benefit of Section 382(B) Cr.P.C is
also extended to the appellant. Remaining sentences of payment of Daman,

compensation etc. are also maintained.

6. The above are the reasons for our short order of even date which

reads as under:-
Crl.A.122-L/2012

p We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant. For

ae

reasons to be recorded later, this Criminal Appeal is partly allowed in
terms that conviction of the appellant is maintained, however, his

sentence of death is converted into life imprisonment with benefit of

section 382-B Cr.P.C. The remaining sentences of fine etc. shall remain

intact.”
