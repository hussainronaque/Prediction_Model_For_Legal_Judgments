eK

SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.-— Zain-ud-Din appellant has
assailed the judgment, rendered by learned Additional Sessions
Judge/Judge Model Criminal Trial Court, Tank, in Sessions Case
No.106/II of 2018 whereby the accused/respondents have been
acquitted of the charge in case FIR No.104 dated 17.3.2017,

registered under section 302/34 PPC of police station Mulazai,

District Tank.

Qs The prosecution story as disclosed in the FIR Ex.PA,
is that on 17.3.2017 at 13:30 hours, complainant Zain-ud-Din (PW-
8), with the help of co-villagers, brought dead body of his father
Behram Khan to police station Mulazai in a Datsun pickup where

he reported the matter to Kifayat Ullah ASI (PW-3), to the effect

®”

that on 17.3.2017, he and his father, while riding on motorcycle
and cycle, respectively, left for village Amma Khel to perform
Jumma prayer, at about 12:30 hours, when they reached at Tank
Road near the house of Abdul Qadeer in village Amma Khel, the
accused/respondents, duly armed with pistols, were standing there
and as soon his father reached near them, both the accused started
firing at him, as a result whereof, his father was hit, fell down from
the cycle and died on the spot. The accused fled away from the spot
after commission of the offence. Besides the complainant, the
occurrence is stated to be witnessed by his uncle Akbar Ali (PW-
9). Motive for the offence is stated to be previous blood-feud
between the parties. He charged the accused for the commission of
offence. PW-3 also prepared injury sheet Ex. PW 3/1 and inquest
report Ex. PW 3/2 of the deceased and sent the dead body to civil
hospital, Tank under the escort of constable Azam, for post-mortem

examination.

3. Initially, the accused absconded, therefore, challan
under Section 512, Cr.P.C. was submitted before the trial Court.
After arrest of the accused and completion of investigation,
complete challan was submitted against them before the trial Court,
where at the commencement of trial, prosecution produced and
examined as many as eleven witnesses, whereafter, statement of
accused was recoded under Section 342, Cr.P.C. wherein he
professed innocence and false implication, however, neither he

opted to be examined on oath in terms of section 340(2), Cr.P.C.

®

YY

nor produced evidence in their defence. The learned trial Court,
after hearing arguments, acquitted the accused/respondents vide

judgment impugned herein, hence the instant appeal.

4. The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that
the approach of the learned trial Court to the matter in hand is not
only cursory but is without application of judicial mind to the
evidence on file; and that the impugned judgment was passed in an
unholy haste which has occasioned a great miscarriage of justice.
He continued to say that the learned trial Court was swayed by
impulsiveness and his preoccupation with imaginations resulted
into the impugned judgment and as such the learned trial Court fell
in error. It was voiced that the learned trial Court did not advance
reasons to justify his decision and that the direct and trust worthy
ocular account was ignored, by substituting its own observations. It
was reiterated that the report was promptly made which in itself is
sufficient to establish the presence of the complainant on the spot at
the time of incident. He concluded that to presume an accused
innocent unless proven guilty does not absolve the Courts of law of
their liability to assess and reassess the evidence on file, which the

trial Court failed to do.
5. Heard. Record perused.

6. There is no denial to the fact that once an accused is
acquitted of the charges, he gets double presumption of innocence

to his credit and to upset the same extra ordinary circumstances are

@)

needed. While dealing with an appeal against acquittal the
appellate Court is to see as to what illegality the trial Court has
committed while acquitting the accused and that the judgment
impugned is arbitrary, mechanical and perverse. The appellate
Court is under the bounden duty to reappraise the evidence and
after application of its judicial mind decide the fate of an appeal
pending before, so that miscarriage of justice could be avoided. To
upset the findings reached to, by a trial Court, extra care is needed
especially, in an appeal against acquittal. Needless to emphasize
that when an accused is acquitted from the charge by a Court of
competent jurisdiction then, double presumption of innocence is
attached to its order, with which the superior Courts do not
interfere unless the impugned order is arbitrary, capricious, fanciful
and against the record as the law relating to reappraisal of evidence
in appeals against acquittal is stringent in that the presumption of
innocence is doubled and multiplied after a findings of not guilty
recorded by a competent Court of law. Such findings cannot be
reversed until and unless extra ordinary circumstances are pointed
out. Law requires that a judgment of acquittal shall not be disturbed

even though second opinion may be reasonably possible.

te It was 12.30 hours when the deceased was done to
death while en-route to a local mosque, for performing Jumma
prayer on his bicycle, situated in village Amma Khel. The report
tells that the deceased left the house at 12.00 hours, followed by the

complainant at 12.30 hours on his motorcycle, on reaching to the

@)

place of incident the accused/respondents, who were present duly
armed fired at the deceased, who after receiving firearm injuries

fell to the ground and died on the spot.

8. The accused were acquitted of the charges, as to the
learned trial Court both the complainant and eye witness could not
establish their presence on the spot at the time of incident and that
the witnesses were inimical and interested. This Court is to see as
to whether the learned trial Court took the pains to assess and
reassess the evidence on file and as to whether it was after
application of judicial mind to the facts and circumstances of the
case that the impugned judgment was passed. We are yet to see as
to whether the witnesses could prove their presence on the spot
when the deceased was done to death. This is yet to be seen as to
whether the incident occurred in the mode, manner and at the stated

time.

9. The complainant was examined as PW-8, who stated
that he with his deceased father was residing in a joint house and
that it was at 12.00 hours when the deceased took his bicycle and
started for the mosque. He further stated that it was after 30
minutes of his father left, he started for the mosque on his
motorcycle to perform his Jumma prayer. This is admitted on
record that both, father and the son were residing in one and the
same house and that on the day of incident they were present in the

house when the deceased left for the mosque on his bicycle. We are

®

anxious to know that why the deceased did not wait and
accompany the complainant to the mosque as he had a motorcycle
to go by. This is astonishing that despite the fact that the
complainant was in the knowledge that his father was leaving for
the mosque which was situated at a distance of 05/06 KM, but he
did not ask his father to wait, so that both could go together. The
place of occurrence is situated at a éomsiderils distance from the
house of the deceased, but surprisingly all the three ie. the
deceased, complainant and PW Akbar Ali reached there at one and
the same time. The complainant stated that when the deceased
reached to the spot the appellants were already present duly armed
and that they started firing at the deceased with their pistols, which
resulted into his death. The complainant has been shown at a
distance of 70 paces from the deceased and so the eye witness. The
complainant could not explain that why he used a parallel path to
travel and so the eye witness, as it was a metallic road which
connects their village to village Amma Khel. It is intriguing that
the complainant has been shown at point No.4 in the site plan
which is situated in the middle of shrubs locally known as (parasa).
Though the complainant pointed his presence at point No.4 in front
of the shops, but he failed to convince the purpose of his presence
as he was supposed to go to the mosque. PW Akbar Ali has been
shown at point No.5 which is situated on a footpath, when he
appeared before the trial Court he stated that he was also going to

the mosque on his motorcycle, but he too failed to convince that
SS

why he did not use the metal road instead of using the unpaved
footpath, which is often used by the pedestrians. The conduct of the
witnesses is unnatural on this particular aspect of the case. The eye
witness who was examined as PW-9, stated that when he reached
to point No.5, he stopped his motorcycle in order to inquire from
one Saif-ur-Rehman regarding Jumma prayer, but the record is
silent regarding the presence of one Saif ur Rehman and even no
specific point was attributed to him in the site plan. So much so the

Investigating officer did not record his statement.

10. The complainant stated that soon after receiving fire
shots the deceased fell to the ground and died on the spot. He
further stated that the accused/appellants were at a distance of one
pace from the deceased and that they were facing the deceased at
the time of incident. The doctor who conducted autopsy on the
dead body of the deceased, opined that the deceased received 06
entry wounds on his back, whereas one on his front. When his
statement is placed in juxtaposition with what the eye witness
stated then both the ocular account and medical evidence are in
conflict with one another, as it was the complainant who stated that
at the time of firing the deceased was facing the accused/appellants,
had it been so then all the bullets should have landed on his chest
with its exits on the back. We cannot ignore that the site plan was
prepared at the instance of the complainant, where the inter-se
distance between the three i.e. the assailants and the deceased was

given as one pace each, but when he appeared before the Court he
stated that the accused and deceased were at a distance of 06/08
paces from one another. This was a dishonest improvement on part
of the complainant as he wanted to toe the lines with the medical
evidence, as no charring marks were mentioned in the post mortem
report. If we admit it correct that the site plan was prepared at the
instance of the complainant then the inter-se distance between the
accused and the deceased leaves no room to doubt the presence of
charring marks. True that when a .30 bore pistol is fired from a
distance of 09 inches, charring marks occur, but equally true that
while using a .30 bore pistol to fire one has to extend his hand and
in that eventuality the barrel of the pistol comes within the range.
This conflict between the medical evidence and ocular account has
crept deep into the roots of the prosecution case. True that the
medical evidence is confirmatory in nature and when direct ocular
account is available on file, then in that eventuality it is the ocular
account which is to be preferred and taken into consideration,
provided it is confidence inspiring, but in case in hand the presence
of the witnesses at the time and at the place of incident is shrouded
in mystery, so the conflict between the two cannot be ignored and it

is for the prosecution to prove otherwise.

In case titled “Akhter Saleem and another Vs the

State and another” (2019 MLD 1107), it is held that:

“12.The above factors, material
contradictions between ocular and

medical evidence create serious doubts

in the happening of alleged occurrence
and it is well settled law that even a
single doubt, if found reasonable,
would entitle the accused person to
acquittal and not a combination of

several doubts.”

11. Record tells that PW Akbar Ali was serving in the
police department as a constable during the days of occurrence, but
he could not explain that why he did not join his duty on the day of
occurrence, even he failed to bring on record his absence from his
duties. The witnesses introduced one Qadeer, who approached the
deceased soon after the incident and it was he who arranged the
Cot and helped the witnesses in shifting the dead body of the
deceased from the ground, but to our utmost surprise the
investigating officer did not record his statement. The witnesses
stated that they participated in shifting the dead body from ground
to the Cot but their hands and clothes were not besmeared with
blood, which is an unnatural phenomenon. Had the witnesses been
present at the place of incident and participated in shifting the dead
body from the ground then their hands and clothes would have
been besmeared with blood and this particular aspect of the case

puts a question mark to the veracity of the witnesses.

12. The investigating officer visited the spot and during
spot inspection recovered 06 empties of .30 bore alongwith two
spent bullets, a bicycle and blood stained earth from the place of

deceased. The empties were sent to the Forensic Science

10

Laboratory to ascertain as to whether these were fired from one or
more weapons. The report was received with an opinion that these
empties were fired from one weapon. The laboratory report

confirms that it was the doing of one person.

In case titled “The State through A.G Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Vs Subhan Ali and another” (2020 MLD 1901),

wherein it is held that:

“12, The Investigating Officer
recovered three empties of 7.62 bore
from the spot, which were sent to the
office of chemical examiner with a
request to tender its opinion, as to
whether these were fired from one or
different weapons, the report has been
exhibited as Ex: PW10/6, where these
empties were shown fired from one and
the same weapon. The deceased has
three inlet wounds and three empties
were recovered from the spot with
opinion from the Forensic Sciences
Laboratory as having been fired from
one and the same weapon belies the
stance of the complainant regarding the
involvement of two accused in

commission of the offence.

13. Both the motorcycles allegedly left on the spot were

not taken into possession by the investigating officer, so much so

e

11

he did not take pains to record the statement of one Saif-ur-
Rehman, in respect of his conversation with the eye witness. It is
pertinent to mention that the investigating officer did not associate
one Qadeer, who allegedly reached to the place of incident soon
after the deceased was fired at. Had he been associated with the
investigation he would have disclosed the presence or absence of
the witnesses on the spot. The lack of interest on part of the
prosecution to associate these two important witnesses with
investigation tells nothing, but that they were not supporting the
prosecution case. Article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,

1984 caters for the situation, as is held in case titled Tahir Khan

Vs. The State (2011 SCMR 646), wherein it is held that:

“13. In the present case as observed above,
the clouds over the veracity of the
prosecution version began hovering with the
substitution of the initially nominated
persons in the FR. and also that
complainant did not appear as a witness. It
assumes relevance as he (Ghulam Hussain),
Sultan Mehmood and Ghulam Abbas were
given up by the prosecution and not
produced. The only possible conclusion is
that the prosecution sensed the risk of
producing them that they might not support
the said version. Their production thus was
withheld leaving doubts spreading all

around”,
12

14. The motive was stated to be the previous blood feud
but the investigating officer failed to collect any evidence and even
no statement was recorded in that respect. The motive advanced
was stated to be the previous blood feud, but the Investigating
Officer did not bring on record copies of the criminal cases
between the parties and even the witnesses did not produce the
same. If we admit that it was the blood feud between the parties
which led to the death of the deceased, in that eventuality the
complainant would have been the prime target if he was present on
the spot. There is no cavil to the proposition that once the
prosecution alleges a motive then it is under the bounden duty to
prove the same, failing which it is the prosecution to suffer and the

present case is no exception, as is held in case titled "Muhammad

Ashraf alias Acchu Vs The State" (2019 SCMR 652 Para-7),

"7, The motive is always a double-
edged weapon. The complainant
Sultan Ahmad (PW9) has admitted
murder enmity between the parties and
has also given details of the same in
his statement recorded before the trial
court. No doubt, previous enmity can
be a reason for the appellant to
commit the alleged crime, but it can
equally be a _ reason for the
complainant side to falsely implicate
the appellant in this case for previous

grouse."

15. The learned counsel stressed hard and hard that the
accused/respondents remained absconder for sufficient long time;
and that they could not explain their willful absence and that this
factor alone is sufficient to prove their guilt. True that the accused
did not surrender for nearly six months, but it is equally true that
they applied for bail before arrest to the Court of competent
jurisdiction which was confirmed, but later on recalled by the apex
Court. The conduct displayed by the respondents show that they
were willing to surrender. There is no cavil to the proposition that
abscondence by itself is not sufficient to prove guilty an accused
rather it is a circumstance which can aid to favor the prosecution
provided the prosecution succeeds in proving its case through

confidence inspiring evidence, which is not the case in hand.

In case titled “Muhammad Sadiq Vs. State (2017
SCMR 144), it is held that:

“The fact that the appellant
absconded and was not traceable for
considerably long period of time could also
not be made sole basis for his conviction
when the other evidence of the prosecution
is doubtful as it is riddled with

contradictions.”

16. For what has been discussed above this Court reaches
to an inescapable conclusion that the prosecution did not succeed in
proving its case against the respondents and the learned trial Court

has competently dealt with the issue in hand. The impugned

Vi

14

judgment is well reasoned, which calls for no interference. This

criminal appeal is bereft of merit stands dismissed.
