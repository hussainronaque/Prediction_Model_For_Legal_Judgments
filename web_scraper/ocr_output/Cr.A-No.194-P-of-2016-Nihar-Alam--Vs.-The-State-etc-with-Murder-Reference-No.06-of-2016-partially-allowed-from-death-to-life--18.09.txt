QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- Complainant-

turned -accused, Nihar Alam son of Niaz Ali
reported in Police Station Mandani, Charsadda,
after having brought dead body of his

deceased wife Mst. Pashmina daughter of
Suliman and also in the presence of other co-
villagers, to the effect that his marriage was
solemnized with deceased Mst. Pashmina about
11/12 years back, and out of the wedlock, three
sons were born, who were still alive. According
to the complainant/accused, he saw _ his
deceased wife with Sartaj son of Khanzad Gul in
compromising position some 9/10 months
back, whereupon, he tried to stop them from
such immoral activities, but the said Sartaj
continued to visit his house and indulge in
immoral relations with his wife, Mst. Pashmina;
therefore, after informing his brother Sardar
Alam, about illicit relations of his wife with the
said Sartaj, they started keeping vigil on Sartaj,
who was found in objectionable condition with
deceased Mst. Pashmina in one bed; therefore,
he and his brother, Sardar Alam, opened fire at
them with their weapons, causing their death,
and that he also hit Sartaj with Axe blows.
According to the FIR, Mst. Pashmina was

brought by him to the P.S,_ while
Sartaj was taken by his relatives to Charsadda
Hospital. The FIR was signed by the
complainant/accused and also verified by Sher
Zaman Khan son of Naeem Ullah Khan and
Fazal Rabi son of Itbar Shah. The occurrence,
which reportedly took place at 1930 hours on
21.01.2014, was reported in P.S Mandani,
Charsadda, at 2045 hours, vide FIR No.18 dated
21.01.2014; and case was registered against
both the complainant/accused and his brother,
Sardar Alam, under Sections 302/34 PPC

2. The Postmortem examination of
deceased Mst. Pashmina at 7.30 AM on the
following day of the occurrence i.e. 22.01.2014
revealed four firearm entry wounds of the same
size and dimension i.e. %x % cm. Likewise, the
postmortem examination of the other deceased,
Sartaj, indicated 8 firearm entry wounds, with
corresponding exit wounds, of the same size of
1 x 1 cm, but with the exception of fire arm
entry wound No.3 which was found 1.5 x 1.5 cm

in size, with charring marks, suggesting fire from
close range; and also 3 incised wounds of
almost the same size of 2 inch x 2 inch, with
slight variation in the size of injury No.10,
showing the same as 1 % inch x 2 inch. The
Medical Officer, in the case of deceased Sartaj,
also reported sharp injury besides firearm
injuries as cause of death of the deceased.

3. During spot (House of the
complainant/accused) inspection the I.0
secured blood from the pillow on the bed in the
room where deceased Mst. Pashmina was
reportedly present and fired at by the
complainant/accused and his brother and co-
accused, Sardar Alam. Likewise, blood was
secured from the place assigned in the site plan
to deceased Sartaj, wherefrom four spent
bullets were also recovered by the LI.O.
Similarly, while showing places of both the
complainant/accused and his brother and co-
accused, Sardar Alam, in the site plan, the I.0
recovered empty shells of 30 bore lying in the

room in scattered condition and also 7 empties
of 7.62 bore, giving smell of fresh discharge;
besides recovering a small size axe from the
room, and also pistol 30 bore loaded with five
rounds of 30 bore. The site plan was prepared
on the pointation of the complainant/accused,
and photographs of the scene of occurrence
were also taken, and placed on file. The I.0 also
placed on file statements of legal heirs of
deceased Sartaj, showing their intention not to
charge the complainant/accused for the offence.
Their statements bear their thumb
impressions/signatures; wherein, they,
nevertheless, verified report of the
complainant/accused. The blood stained cotton
and earth and garments of both the deceased
were sent to the FSL, Peshawar, wherefrom the
opinion of chemical examiner was received in
the affirmative. The eleven 30 bore and seven
7.62 MM crime empties were also sent to the
firearms expert, who furnished his report to the
effect that eleven 30 bore crime empties were fired

from two 30 bore weapons and that seven 7.62 MM

bore crime empties were fired from one and the
same 7.62 MM bore weapon. After collection of
evidence, recording statements of PWs under
Section 161 Cr.PC and completion of
investigation, complete challan was submitted
in the case, leading to commencement of trial in
the learned trial Court/Additional Sessions
Judge, Charsadda at Tangi.
4. Since co-accused Sardar Alam, was
absconding, he was proceeded against under
Section 512 Cr.PC on the basis of statement of
Hussain Shah DFC No.1014 (SW.1); and formal
charge was initially framed under Sections
302/34 PPC on 02.04.2015, followed by formal
charge on 19.11.2015 under Sections 302/338-
C/34 PPC, with addition of ‘Asqat-i-janin of
fetus’; and thereafter an-other formal charge
under Sections 302/338-C/34 PPC and Section
13 AO was framed on 26.01.2016. During trial,
the prosecution examined the following seven
Pws.

e Dr. Adil, DHQ Hospital, Charsadda

(PW1), conducted autopsy of deceased
Sartaj and furnished his report;
e Madni-Ullah No. 349 (PW1-A-PW2),
marginal witness to the recovery
memos;

e Dr, Afsha, RHC, Jamal Abad (PW.1-A-
PW.3 conducted autopsy of deceased
Mst. Pashimina;

e Qaiser Khan IHC (PW4), registered FIR
on the report of the
complainant/accused;

e Muhammad Ayaz SI (PW5), the
investigating officer;

e Muhammad Zaman Inspector (PW.6)
prepared injury sheet and _ inquest
report of deceased Sartaj; and

e Rashid Khan SI (PW.7) submitted

complete challan against the accused
facing trial.

5. After prosecution closed its evidence,
statement of the accused was recorded three
times, firstly, on 26.10.2015, then, on
12.01.2016 and, finally, his additional statement
on 22.02.2016. The complainant, though, denied
allegations of the prosecution against him, but
neither produced defence evidence nor
recorded his statement on oath. The learned
trial Court/Additional Sessions Judge,

Charsadda at Tangi, then, heard arguments of
learned APP for the State and learned defence
counsel; and rendered the impugned judgment
dated 10.03.2016, whereby, the
complainant/accused, Nihar Alam, was
convicted under Section 302 (b) PPC and
sentenced to death on two counts as tazir with
compensation of Rs.500000/- which, when
recovered, was to be paid to the legal heirs of
deceased as compensation under Section 544-A
Cr.PC. The complainant/accused was also
convicted under Section 338-C PPC and
sentenced to seven years R.I as Tazir. He was
further convicted under Section 13 A.O and
sentenced to one year R.I with fine of Rs.5000/-
or in default of payment of fine to one month
SI. The benefit of Section 382-B Cr.PC was
extended to him. Simultaneously, the learned
trial Court declared co-accused, Sardar Alam, as
a proclaimed offender; and perpetual non-
bailable warrant of arrest was issued against

him; hence the instant appeal against the
conviction and sentences awarded to the
convict/appellant.

6. Arguments of learned counsel for the
appellant and learned AAG, also on behalf of
legal heirs of the deceased, as they expressed
their inability to engage counsel, heard; and
record perused.

7. In this case, not only complainant
himself brought the dead body of his wife, Mst.
Pashmina, to the Police Station and lodged
report there about her murder as well as qatl-i-
amd of her paramour, Sartaj, by him and his
brother and absconding co-accused, Sardar
Alam; while disclosing motive for the offence as
illicit relations of deceased Sartaj with his
deceased wife, Mst. Pashimina, which was in
his knowledge for the past 9/10 months, and
was shared by him with his brother, Sardar
Alam. The FIR was signed by the complainant
and thumb impressed by Sher Zaman Khan son
of Naeem Ullah Khan and also signed by Fazal

Rabi son of Itbar Shah as token of its
correctness. The report was lodged in Police
Station Mandani, Charsadda, at a distance of
5/6 kilometers from the house of the
complainant/accused, where the occurrence
took place. The occurrence reportedly took
place at 1930 hours, and the report was lodged
on the same day i.e.21.01.2014 at 2045 hours
i.e. within one hour and 15 minutes of the
occurrence.

8. The postmortem reports of both the
deceased confirmed the FIR by showing not
only multiple firearm injuries on the bodies of
both the deceased but also sharp edged wounds
on Sartaj, in total conformity with statement of
the complainant/accused in the FIR to the effect
that first he and his brother and absconding co-
accused, Sardar Alam, fired at both the deceased
with their firearms and then he caused axe
blows to deceased Sartaj. The recovery of a
small size axe from the scene of occurrence i.e.
residential room of the complainant/accused

and a loaded 30 bore pistol with five rounds of
30 bore from the same place, notwithstanding
absence of blood stains etc on the axe and
absence of smell of fresh discharge from the 30
bore pistols, which would lose significance as
we proceed to further examine evidence
available on the case file, would substantiate case
of the prosecution initiated on the basis of FIR
promptly lodged in the P.S by the appellant
himself.

9. During spot inspection, which is admittedly
residential room in the house of _ the
complainant/accused, not only blood was secured
from the pillow where dead body of deceased Mst.
Pashmina was lying but also blood stained earth
and four spent bullets were recovered from the
place where dead body of deceased Sartaj was
found; and the I.0 also recovered 11 crime empties
of 30 bore and 7 crime empties of 7.62 bore lying in
the room in scattered condition. The firearms
expert found eleven 30 bore crime empties having
been fired from two different 30 bore weapons,
and seven 7.62 MM bore crime empties fired from
one and the same 7.62 MM bore weapon. The 30

bore pistol was not sent to the firearms expert as,
according to the I.0, the same was not giving
smell of fresh discharge, indicating that no fire
was made from the said recovered pistol.
Likewise, the small size axe recovered from the
spot was not sent to FSL for chemical analysis
due to the fact that the same was not having any
blood stains. Anyhow, the chemical analysis of
blood stained cotton, blood stained earth and
blood stained garments of both the deceased
confirmed the scene of occurrence as
residential room in the house _ of
complainant/accused, who also never denied
the same to be the place of occurrence; but
nowhere explained the presence of dead body
of his wife and a stranger in his living room
having been murdered with firearm by the
assailants. The belated denial of the
complainant/accused, without disputing his
signature on the FIR and without furnishing any
explanation for the presence of dead bodies of
both his deceased wife and a stranger deceased,

Sartaj, in his living room, would not absolve him
of the charge of qatl-i-amd of his wife and her
paramour at late night time i.e 1930 hours on
21.01.2014. The two Pws namely Sher Zaman
Khan and Fazal Rabi, who verified FIR lodged by
complainant/accused, and thumb
impressed/signed the same as_ token of _ its
correctness were, though, abandoned by the
prosecution for having been won over by the
defence, yet none of the legal heirs of both the
deceased have, so far, exonerated the
complainant/accused of the charge of qatl-i-
amd of the deceased, and even legal heirs of
deceased Sartaj, who expressed their intention
not to pursue case against the
complainant/accused, nevertheless, verified the
FIR. Needless to say that the defence,
nevertheless, had the opportunity to produce
the abandoned PWs as defence witnesses; but
it did not avail this valuable opportunity,
neither seriously challenged the report/FIR
lodged and also_ signed’ by the

appellant/accused himself, and further
substantiated by the circumstantial evidence
brought on record by the prosecution.

10. The learned counsel for the appellant,
during his arguments, focused on that part of
statement of Qaiser Khan IHC (PW.4) whereby
he deposed that he confined the accused in the
lockup and that he was not taken by any person
away from the lockup; whereas, according to
the learned counsel, the I.0 (PW.5) stated that
site plan was prepared by him at the instance
and pointation of the appellant, who, according
to the PW, was brought out of the lockup and
accompanied the I.0 to the spot for pointation.
Apart from the fact that PW.4 never explained
that ‘any person’ mentioned during his cross
examination also included the I.0. the apparent

inconsistency in the testimony of both the PWs

on this single point, would not be
sufficient to dislodge the otherwise
overwhelming circumstantial evidence,

receiving unqualified support from the
promptly lodged report of the
complainant/accused about the so-called
honour killing by him and his absconding
brother, Sardar Alam. Besides, the charge of
Askat-i-Janin of Fetus under Section 338-C PPC
also stands proved through the un-rebutted
deposition of Dr. Afsha (PW.1-A/PW3); together
with the charge under Section 13 A.O. owing to
recovery of 30 bore pistol loaded with 5 rounds
of 30 bore. As such, there is nothing on record
to warrant setting aside conviction of the
appellant/accused on two counts under Section
302 (b) PPC with compensation payable to the
legal heirs of the deceased under Section 544-A
Cr.PC, and his conviction under Section 338-C
PPC and also his conviction under Section 13
A.O. Therefore, the appeal against the
conviction stands dismissed.

11. However, keeping in view the fact that
the three minor sons have already lost their
mother and, if death sentence is maintained,

they would also be losing their father, the
penalty of death is commuted and converted
into that of imprisonment for life on two counts,
with reduced compensation of
Rs.100000/100000/- for legal heirs of each of
the two deceased under Section 544-A Cr.PC.
The rest of sentences under Section 338-C PPC
for seven years R.I as Tazir and under Section
13 A.O to one year R.I with fine of Rs.5000/- or
in default of payment of fine to further one
month S.J, with benefit of Section 382-B Cr.PC
are hereby upheld. The sentences of
imprisonment shall run concurrently.

12 Murder reference No.06-P/2016 sent by
the learned trial Court for confirmation of the
sentence is answered in the negative.
Announced.
