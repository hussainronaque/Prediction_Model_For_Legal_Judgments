Court in our view resorted to firing, which hit
right side of my son below shoulder on front.
Again said one fire shot hit shoulder and second
shot hit little bit above shoulder of my son. My
son fell down after sustaining injuries. I, Sajida
Parveen, Ghulam Raza and Muhammad Ubaid
witnessed the occurrence. We lifted my son and
were shifting him to the hospital. We reached
BBH hospital, Rawalpindi. After some _ time
police came to the hospital and recorded my

I signed and thumb marked Ex-PF/1 on the
same in token of its correctness. Kashif accused
a year ago picked up fight with me after entering
my house. Due to this reason Kashif accused

After hearing learned counsel for the parties as well

as learned DDPP, and on perusal of record with their able

assistance, it is observed as under:-

I.

IV.

Facts of the case have been given in preceding para
of this judgment, therefore, there is no need to
repeat the same to avoid duplication and repetition.
Hassan Ali was done to death at “pulli” near his
house on 10.03.2022 at 09:59 p.m. whereafter FIR
was lodged on the same night at 12:00 a.m.
(11.03.2022) on the statement of her mother Abida
Parveen/complainant?™® who and her husband
Ghulam Raza Khan’? claim themselves to be the
eyewitnesses of the occurrence.

Abida Parveen/complaiannt?’™® has contracted

PW-7 who is

second marriage with Ghulam Raza Khan
stepfather of Hassan Ali (deceased).

According to the FIR, occurrence took place on
10.03.2022 at 09:59 p.m. whereafter FIR was lodged
at 12:00 a.m. (11.03.2022) with an unexplained delay
of two hours. Post-mortem report (Exh.pB) shows that
the dead body was received in the dead house on
11.03.2022 at 12:30 a.m. whereafter police papers
were received by the Medical Officer (pr. Muhammad

Junaidbw2) at 05:00 a.m. then post-mortem

examination was conducted at 05:10 a.m. (11.03.2022)
Criminal Appeal No.865 of 2022

with an unexplained delay of more than seven
hours from the time of occurrence (09:59 p.m. on
10.03.2022). Such delay is generally suggestive of a
real possibility that time had been consumed by the
police in procuring/planting eye-witnesses,
involving the appellant and in cooking up a story for
the prosecution before preparing police papers
necessary for getting a post-mortem examination of
the dead body conducted. (2011 SCMR 1190)
“Irshad Ahmad Vs. The State”.

V. Both the eyewitnesses (Abida Parveen/complainant?™® &
Ghulam Raza Khan?“-7) have stated in their examination-
in-chief before the trial Court that Hassan Ali
(deceased) had gone out of the house (not returned home
till 09:59 p.m. on the night of 10.03.2022), they came out of
their house after hearing fire shots, Kashif Jamal
(appellant) also came out from the house of Raheel
Khalid (not pw), Hassan Ali (deceased) had reached the
“pulli”, in their view, appellant caused firearm
injuries on his (deceased) person. Points No.3 & 4 of
rough and scaled site plans of the place of
occurrence show the presence of Abida
Parveen /complainant’** and Ghulam Raza Khan’?
which are at a distance of 60 paces/90 feet and 59
paces/88 feet from points i.e. No.1 (where Hassan Ali,
deceased was present) and No.2 (where appellant statedly was
present at “pulli”), aS per prosecution story deceased
was coming to his house. According to the site
plans of the place of occurrence he (Hassan Ali, deceased)
was facing toward the direction of his house
whereas, appellant was going towards south of the
“pulli” opposite direction of the house of the
deceased facing toward south whose back was
toward the house of the deceased and _ the

eyewitnesses. Abida Parveen/complainant’”® stated
Criminal Appeal No.865 of 2022

VI.

in her cross-examination that source of light is not
mentioned in her statement (Exh.PF, upon which FIR was
lodged) before the police. She further stated in her
cross-examination that her examination-in-chief
was recorded on 23.06.2022 but she has not
mentioned the source of light therein. She has also
not stated in her examination-in-chief that she told
the police about the source of light in her statement
before police and police had not recorded. Ghulam
Raza Khan?’ has also not disclosed the source of
light at relevant time even in his examination-in-
chief. Aziz Sultan SI?“?° admitted in his cross-
examination that according to the statement of
Waqas Khalid JFS?’¥?, no source of light was
available at the spot and during the inspection he
had not collected any source of light at the spot. In
these circumstances, identity of the appellant in
dark hours of the night at_a distance of 88/90 feet
when he was heading opposite to the direction of

the eyewitnesses discussed above is not free from

doubt. Mere recovery of electric bulb, later on, does

not prove that same was litting at or near the place

of occurrence at the time of occurrence unless

eyewitness(s) discloses the source of light in the FIR

as _well as in his examination-in-chief before the
trial Court.

Abida Parveen/complainant’”® stated in her cross-
examination before the trial Court that occurrence
took place at 09:15 p.m. Contrary to this, Aziz
Sultan SI?¥1° stated in his cross-examination that
as per version of Abida Parveen/complainantPw-é
occurrence took place at 09:59 p.m. whereas as per

version of Rohail Khalid (complainant in case FIR
No.272/2022, P.S. Civil Lines, Rawalpindi, the story of this FIR has

also been disbelieved by this Court) occurrence took place at
Criminal Appeal No.865 of 2022

VII.

09:30 p.m. This contradiction between time of
occurrence is also not ignorable, rather negates the
presence of eyewitnesses.

It is mentioned in the complaint (Exh.PF, upon which FIR
was lodged) that appellant made fire shot which hit
on front of right shoulder of Hassan Ali (deceased).
Abida Parveen/complainant’”® also stated in her
cross-examination that in her statement (Exh.PF)
before police, police has mentioned one fire shot,
stated in volunteer portion that two fire shots were
made upon her son (Hassan Ali, deceased), She further
stated in her cross-examination that she had stated
in her statement (Exh.pF) before the police that one
fire shot hit on the shoulder and second fire shot
also hit little bit above shoulder of her son (Hassan Ali,
deceased), who was confronted with her statement
(exh.pF) where second fire shot is not mentioned.
Initially, complainant (Abida Parveen’™*) got mentioned
in the FIR that appellant made single fire shot.
Contrary to this, Medical Officer during postmortem
examination on the dead body of the deceased
(Hassan Ali) Observed two firearm entry wounds
whereafter, complainant (abida Parveen’w--) in order to
bring the case in line with the medical officer stated
with dishonest improvement that appellant made
two fire shots on the person of deceased (Hassan Ali).
Likewise, Ghulam Raza Khan?“ stated in his cross-
examination that he had stated before police that
appellant made two fire shots which hit on the right
shoulder of Hassan Ali (deceased), who was also
confronted with his statement (Exh.pa) before police
where seat of injury is not mentioned. He (Ghulam Raza
Khan?“-7) stated in his cross-examination that he had
stated in his statement before police that Kashif

Jamal (appellant) armed with .30-bore pistol came out
Criminal Appeal No.865 of 2022

VIII.

IX.

of his (Raheel Khalid) house, who was confronted with
his statement (Exh.pa) wherein words ‘came out’ are
not mentioned. He (Ghulam Raza Khan?’w7) also stated in
his cross-examination that he had stated before
police that they took the deceased to BBH Hospital,
who was confronted with his statement (Exh.pa)
before police where it was not so recorded. Above
discussed dishonest improvements of both the
eyewitnesses not only shatter their credibility,
rather negate their presence at relevant time. (2008

SCMR 06) “Akhtar Ali and others Vs. The State”.

Motive (disbelieved by the trial Court) of the occurrence as
stated by the complainant before the trial Court is
that about one year prior to the present occurrence
appellant had a quarrel with her after entering into
her house. This motive shows that appellant had
grudge against the complainant but despite her
(Abida Parveen/complainant?’*) Claimed presence at the
time of occurrence at the place of occurrence, she
did not receive even a single scratch on her body
which negates her presence at the relevant time.
Had she been present at the time of occurrence she
would have been prime target of the appellant with
above said motive, blessing her with unbelievable
courtesy and mercy shown to her by the accused
leaving her unhurt knowing well that she would
ultimately depose against him is an unbelievable
story of the prosecution. (2017 SCMR 596) “Mst.

Rukhsana Begum and others Vs. Sajjad and others”.

Ghulam Raza Khan?” being second husband of the
complainant (Abida Parveen’w-s) and stepfather of
Hassan Ali (deceased) while appearing before the trial
Court has provided his residential address i.e.
Gulshan Jhawara Bakra Mandi Street No.1 which is
far away from Dhok Chirag Din where the
Criminal Appeal No.865 of 2022

occurrence took place. In these circumstances,
presence of this witness at the time of occurrence at
the place of occurrence is not only doubtful, rather
whole story of the prosecution is neither plausible
nor believable.

X. Recovery of pistol .30-bore on pointing out of the
appellant in presence of negative report of Punjab
Forensic Science Agency is not only inconsequential
rather draws adverse inference.

4. In view of the above discussed circumstances, I
entertain serious doubt in my mind _ regarding
participation of the appellant in the present case. It is
settled principle of law that for giving benefit of doubt, it
is not necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating doubt. If there is a circumstance
which creates reasonable doubt in the prudent mind
about the guilt of the accused, then he would be entitled
to its benefit not as a matter of grace or concession but
as of right.

5. For the foregoing reasons, instant criminal appeal

filed by the appellant (Kashif Jamal) is accepted, his

conviction and sentences awarded by the trial Court
through the impugned judgment are hereby set-aside. He
is acquitted of the charges and directed to be released

forthwith, if not required in any other case.
