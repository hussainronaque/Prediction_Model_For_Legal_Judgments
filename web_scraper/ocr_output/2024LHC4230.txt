Appellant by: Ms. Rida Noor, Advocate.
Mr. Sohail Majeed Khan, Advocate (Defence
counsel).

State by: Rai_Akhtar_ Hussain, Additional Prosecutor

Complainant by: Mr.Mumtaz Ahmad Mangat, Advocate.

AALIA NEELUM, C.J:- The appellant-Qaisar Abbas, son of
Riaz Ahmad, Caste Jatt Warraich, resident of Saroki, Tehsil and District
Gujrat, has assailed his conviction and sentence recorded by the learned
Addl. Sessions Judge, Gujrat vide judgment dated 14.11.2018, in a State
case F.I.R No.593/2015, dated 26.08.2015, offence under Section 302 PPC,
registered at the police station, Kunjah, District Gujrat, whereby the learned
trial court convicted the appellant-Qaisar Abbas, under Section 302 (b) PPC
and sentenced to death with the direction to pay Rs.5,00,000/- as
compensation to the legal heirs of the deceased under Section 544-A of
Cr.P.C, and in case of default in payment thereof, he would further undergo

06-months SI.

2. Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the learned trial court, the
appellant-Qaisar Abbas, has assailed his conviction and sentence by filing an
appeal bearing Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018. The learned trial court also
referred M.R. No.371 of 2018 (The State. Vs. Qaisar Abbas) to confirm
M.R No.371 of 2018, 2
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

the death sentence awarded to the appellant-Qaisar Abbas, as both the
matters arising from the same judgment of the learned trial court are being

disposed of through this consolidated judgment.

3. Briefly, the prosecution story as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex. PA)
lodged on the statement (Ex.PP) of Khurram Shahzad, deceased
(complainant) is that Khurram Shahzad, deceased (complainant), along with
his brother, Naveed had come to the house of their sister namely, Mst. Salma
Bibi, the wife of Ansar Ali, Caste Jatt Warraich, and a resident of village
Sarokey, wanted to see their sister. On the night of 25/26.08.2015, at about
11:00 p.m., the complainant (since dead) was talking with his friend, Qaisar
Abbas, the accused, and hot words were exchanged between them; after that,
the accused, Qaisar Abbas, took away a pistol from his “dab” and stated to
the complainant (since dead) that he would not let him alive. On hue and cry
of the complainant (since dead), his brother, namely Naveed, and his sister,
Salma, reached there. Qaisar Abbas, the accused fired straight at the
complainant, hitting him on the right side of his chest, and the complainant
(since dead) fell, and after that, the accused fled away. After that, the
complainant (since dead) was brought to A.B.S hospital, Gujrat, in an
injured condition; then he was shifted to Mayo Hospital, Lahore, where he
(the complainant, since dead) succumbed to the injury and offence under

Section 324 PPC, was substituted with an offence under Section 302 PPC.

4. After recording the statement (Ex. PP) of the complainant
(since dead), a formal FIR (Ex. PA) was chalked out by Muhammad Qasim,
T/ASI (PW-1). After the registration of the case, the investigation of this
case was first entrusted to Faique Abbags, S.I (PW-5). After that, the
investigation of this case was entrusted to Faiz Ahmad, S.I. (PW-12), who
found the accused/appellant guilty, prepared a report under Section 173,
Cr.P.C. while placing the names of the accused in column No.3 of the
Challan and sent the same to the court of competent jurisdiction. The learned
trial court formally charge-sheeted the appellant on 04.02.2016, to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In support of its version, the

prosecution produced as many as twelve (12) witnesses. The appellant was
M.R No.371 of 2018, 3
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

also examined in terms of Section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein he neither opted to
appear as his own witness in terms of Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced
any defence evidence. In response to a particular question of why this case
was against him and why the PWs deposed against him, the appellant made

the following deposition: -

“The story of prosecution is totally false and fabricated
one. It was a night occurrence, in fact, deceased of instant
case was drunk when he left the house of his sister Salma
Bibi and was armed with pistol. He entered in the house of
a neighbourer at late night for his nefarious and ferocious
designs, due to which, he received injury by any unknown
person when he was all alone. This fact is further
supported from Medicolegal certificate of then
injured/deceased, Khurram Shahzad. Doctor recorded the
statement of Salma Bibi which fortified the above
mentioned fact regarding leaving the house in drunk and
receiving firearm injury. The PWs are closely related with
the deceased. I have been falsely implicated just to usurp
my landed property. FIR was delayed one which was
registered with premeditation and pre consultation with
the connivance of the doctor and police. Then injured was
not fit for statement but with malafide intention and
connivance of Faiq Abbas, S.I and doctor his statement
was posed to be recorded by then injured which is totally
wrong just to strengthen the false version of the
prosecution;. No person of locality ie. village of
occurrence endorsed the false version of prosecution. So
much so, the brother of deceased Rana Muhammad Saeed
and mother Zohra Bibi have not endorsed the version of
Salma Bibi and others. I am innocent. I have been falsely
implicated and have no concerned with the occurrence.”

5. After recording evidence and evaluating the evidence available
on record, considering arguments advanced from both sides, the learned trial
court found the prosecution version proved beyond any shadow of
reasonable doubt, which resulted in the appellant’s conviction as well as

awarding of sentence to him in the afore-stated terms.

6. We have heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsel

for the parties and have minutely perused the record on the file.

7. The occurrence occurred on the intervening night of 25.08.2015

and 26.08.2015 at 11:00 p.m. in Saroki, situated within the jurisdiction of
M.R No.371 of 2018, 4
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

Police Station Kunjah, District Gujrat, which is 3-1/2 kilometers only from
the place of occurrence. Whereas FI.R. (Ex. PA) was registered on
26.08.2015 at 04:30 a.m., on the verbal statement-Fard bayan of Khurram
Shahzad, then injured, at ABS Hospital, Gujrat, on which F.I.R. (Ex. PA)
was registered under section 324 PPC. After that, Khurram Shahzad
succumbed to the injuries at Mayo Hospital, Lahore, on 27.08.2015 at 06:05
a.m., and an offence under Section 302 PPC was substituted. It was argued
by learned D.P.G. that the F.I.R. of the incident was lodged under section
324 P.P.C. on the intervening night of 25.08.2015 and 26.08.2015 at 4:30
a.m. The deceased, Khurram Shahzad, soon after the incident, was taken to
ABS Hospital, Gujrat, where he was given medical treatment by Dr. Iqbal
Hussain (PW-6) on 26-08-2015 in the night. His dying declaration was also
recorded by Faique Abbas S.J. (PW-5), and the signature of Dr. Iqbal
Hussain (PW-6) has been marked as (Ex.P.E/2) in which he categorically
stated that accused Qaiser Abbas had shot him with pistol 30 bore and his
sister Salma Bibi (PW-7) and brother Naveed (PW-11) brought him to the
hospital. Faique Abbas SI. (PW-5) deposed during the examination-in-chief
that: -

*---On 26.08.2015, I was posted_as ASI of police station
Kunjah. On receiving information that_one person has
sustained a firearm injury and has been removed to ABS
Hospital Gujrat, I promptly reached in hospital, made an
application Ex.P.E to medical officer for recording
statement of injured Khuram Shahzad s/o Abdul Khaliq.
My signatures over Ex.P.E is Ex.P.E/1, prepared injury
statement Ex.P.F which bears my signatures Ex.P.F/I---
On_ 26.08.2015, I recorded the statement of Khuram
Shahzad (deceased) at ABS Hospital, Gujrat, which is
Exh.P.P which bears signatures and thumb impression of
Khuram Shahzad. I identified the signatures and thumb
impression of Khuram Shahzad. His signatures and
thumb impression is Exh.P.P/1 abd Exh,.P.P/2”

Faique Abbas S.I. (PW-5) deposed during the cross-examination that: -

“---I_ do not conversant with Khuram Shahzad prior to
allegedly recording his statement. I have not seen any I.D
card of Khuram Shahzad. I have not _got_attested_the
alleged statement of Khuram Shahzad by any doctor. I

have also not annexed any video clip along with the alleged
statement of Khuram Shahzad---”
M.R No.371 of 2018, 5
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

Dr. Iqbal Hussain (PW-6) deposed during the examination-in-chief that: -

“---Faique Abbas ASI also moved an application Ex.P.E
for recording the statement of the injured. I examined
the patient. Patient is well oriented and fit for statement.
Application for recording statement of injured bears my
signatures _Ex.P.E/2. After __ conducting _ medical
examination I issued MLC _Ex.PJ. which bears my
signatures Ex.P.1/1”.

The testimony of Faique Abbas S.I. (PW-5), Dr. Iqbal Hussain (PW-6), and
Naveed (PW-11) was belied by medical as well as documentary evidence.
On perusing the medical examination certificate (Ex. PI/1), we found that
Khurram Shahzad (then injured) was brought to the hospital by Javeed Iqbal
4007/C (PW-4) at 1:40 a.m., and immediately, medical treatment was
provided. The column “General Physical Examination/Symptoms” mentions
that “Semi-conscious BP 90/60 Plus 97/min,” and medical treatment was
provided against police docket No. 38. Dr. Iqbal Hussain (PW-6) deposed

during the cross-examination that: -

“---It is correct that whenever any injured is brought to
hospital and if he is in his senses, we record his statement
in_brief history otherwise statement of any person
accompanied _ by said injured is recorded. It is correct

that in MLR of the injured Khuram Shahzad statement
of his sister Mst. Salma Bibi has been recorded----It is

correct that I recorded the statement of the sister of

injured Khuram_ Shahzad_because_of_the fact that
injured was not in a fit condition to give his statement”

In the column concerning “brief history,” it was noted that the statement of
Salma Bibi (PW-7), the sister of Khurram Shahzad, was recorded, which is
reproduced as under: -

Javed Iqbal 4007/C (PW-4) has not deposed that he accompanied the injured
for medical examination to ABS Hospital, Gujrat; rather, he stated that after
the medical examination, he produced MLC (Ex. PI/1) of the injured
Khurram Shahzad before the investigating officer. Faique Abbas S.I. (PW-5)

deposed during the cross-examination that: -

“---The information of the alleged occurrence was received
at_Kunjah on the mid night of 26/27.05, again stated og®
M.R No.371 of 2018, 6

month of 2015 at about 11/12’0 clock through mobile
phone---I_ did not _enter_in the relevant about the person
through whom I received the information—The person who
gave telephonic information did not mention the name of
any accused and manner of occurrence. I did not mention
about the receipt_of alleged occurrence in the relevant
register---On injury statement, the factum of being injured
was told by some person, again stated that it was told by the
concerned _injured---Rupt_No.38 dated _26.08.015 is not
attached with the record---It is correct that the FIR of

alleged occurrence was registered with the delay of about

five to six hours---”

On perusal of the injury statement (Ex. PF) (available on page No. 125-A of
the paper book), it reveals that the same was prepared at police station
Kunjah, District Gujrat, and the injured was referred to hospital through
Javeed Iqbal 4007/C (PW-4). The scanned copy of the injury statement is

reproduced as follows: -

Faique Abbas, S.I (PW-5)-the investigating officer deposed during cross-

examination that: -

“---It is correct that as per column No.1 of inquest report
Ex.P.L, the dead body of deceased Khuram Shahzad was
recovered from village Sarookey---”

The dying declaration (Ex-PP) contains the signatures of Dr. Iqbal Hussain
(PW-6), but this witness admitted during the cross-examination that
Khurram Shahzad was in a Semi-conscious condition and not fit to make a
statement. Dr. Iqbal's admission is very material and creates doubt about the
truthfulness of the dying declaration. These circumstances show that there
was no occasion to record the dying declaration, which demolishes the
whole story of the dying declaration. The time of the dying declaration and
the medico-legal examination are relevant facts. Under Article 46 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, the sanctity of a dying declaration must be
evaluated with great care and caution, and the evidence of a dying
declaration must be appreciated with due diligence. A dying declaration is a
question of fact that has to be determined by the facts of each case. A case
must be considered in all its physical environment and circumstances to
discover the truth or falsity of a dying declaration. The courts below have to
be extremely careful when they deal with a dying declaration, as the maker
is not available for cross-examination, which poses great difficulty to the
accused person. A mechanical approach of relying upon a dying declaration
just because it is there is extremely dangerous. The courts insist that the
dying declaration should be of such nature as to inspire the full confidence
of the court in its truthfulness and correctness. The court, however, has
always to be on guard to see that the statement of the deceased was not a
result of either tutoring or prompting or a product of imagination. The court
also must further decide that the deceased was in a fit state of mind and had
the opportunity to observe and identify the assailant. Usually, therefore, the
court looks up to the medical opinion to satisfy whether the deceased was in
a fit mental condition to make the dying declaration. Dr. Iqbal Hussain (PW-
6) mentioned in MLC (Ex. PI/1) that the time of the medico-legal
examination is 1:40 a.m. on 26.08.2015, after two hours and forty minutes

and Faique Abbas S.I. (PW-5) recorded verbal statement-Fard bayan (Ex.
M.R No.371 of 2018, 8
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

PP) of Khurram Shahzad, then injured, at ABS Hospital, Gujrat, at 04:30
a.m. on 26.08.2015. As soon as the injured is brought, the doctor takes
automatic steps for first aid, and since the doctor sent Khurram Shahzad,
who was then injured, for a chest x-ray, the radiologist and surgeon's
opinion. Dr. Iqbal Hussain (PW-6) deposed during the cross-examination

that: -

“---It_is correct that I advised for x-ray and opinion of
radiologist_and surgeon. It_is correct_that_opinion of
Surgeon and radiologist is not part of MLR”

Dr. Muhammad Ali (PW-10), who conducted a postmortem on the dead
body of Khurram Shahzad, observed that the drain tube incision and stitch
wound on the right iliac fossa oblique measuring 5x1 cm marks were
present. It suggests that Khurram Shahzad went through the surgical process.
When the doctor referred the injured (Khurram Shahzad) for a surgeon’s
opinion, and provided medical treatment, it can not be said that he was in a
condition to give a statement. In the inquest report (Ex.PL), in the column of
brief history, it is mentioned that the injured Khurram Shahzad was referred
to Mayo Hospital from ABS Hospital. Saqib Nazir 378/C (PW-3) deposed
during his examination-in-chief that he escorted the dead body of Khurram
Shahzad to A.B.S. Hospital, Gujrat. Still, he had not deposed wherefrom he
escorted the dead body of Khurram Shahzad to A.B.S. Hospital, Gujrat. In
the column of brief history of inquest report (Ex. PL), it was mentioned as

Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

Immediately after providing first aid, Dr. Iqbal Hussain (PW-6) must have
conducted a medico-legal examination, first. The time is 1:40 a.m. on
26.08.2015, written on the MLC (Ex. PI/1). After that, the injured was sent
for surgery, and the prosecution did not produce the surgical unit/department
record. The prosecution failed to establish where Khurram Shahzad took his
last breath. So, the time of writing the dying declaration is wrong. It appears
that the dying declaration was recorded much later, and the doctor concerned
unmindfully mentioned that the injured was fit to make a statement on the
application for recording the statement of the injured (Ex. PD). Why he
(PW-5) has not written said fact on the dying declaration, is surprising and
raising eyebrows. The dying declaration and injury report were recorded at
the same time. Due to the nature of the injury and abnormal pulse rate, a

semi-conscious injured person is not expected to be able to depose the
dying declaration. Thus, the dying declaration appears to be highly

doubtful. However, during cross-examination, he admitted that the sister's
statement of the injured Khurram Shahzad was recorded because the injured
Khurram Shahzad was not in a fit condition to give his statement. Thus, the
conduct of the medical officer concerned is highly questionable. The
prosecution witnesses have not deposed that Khurram Shehzad was shifted
to Mayo Hospital Lahore for medical treatment, when and who took/shifted
him to Mayo Hospital Lahore. Dr. Iqbal Hussain (PW-6) also did not depose
in his examination-in-chief that he referred Khurram Shehzad to Mayo
Hospital Lahore for medical treatment. It is also not mentioned in the MLC
(Ex. PI/1) that Khuram Shehzad was referred injured to Mayo Hospital
Lahore for medical management. Salma BiBi (PW-7) and Naveed (PW-11),
sister and brother of Khurram Shahzad, also did not depose in their
examination-in-chief that they shifted the injured to Mayo Hospital Lahore
for medical treatment where he lost his life. During cross-examination,
Salma BiBi (PW-7) deposed that she remained for about two and a half
hours in the hospital, the time so becomes about 1:40 a.m. on 26.08.2015.
What happened from 1:40 a.m. on 26.08.2015 till 06:05 a.m., on 27.08.2015
i.e. the time when Khurram Shahzad expired, which is the time and date

mentioned by Dr. Muhammad Ali (PW-10), on the post-mortem
M.R No.371 of 2018, 10
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

examination report, the prosecution story is silent. A similar statement is
given by Naveed (PW-11); apart from this, the prosecution story is silent as
to when Khurram Shahzad breathed his last and who brought his dead body
to ABS Hospital Gujarat. Faique Abbas, S.I./I.O. (PW-5) does not depose in
his statement that he brought the dead body of Khurram Shahzad to ABS
Hospital Gujarat from Mayo Hospital, Lahore, while Faiz Ahmed S.1//1.0.
(PW-12) mentioned in the column of the brief history of inquest report (Ex.
PL) that Faique Abbas, S.I/I.0. (PW-5) brought the dead body of Khurram
Shahzad from Mayo Hospital Lahore to A.B.S. Hospital, Gujrat.

8. In the FIR (Ex. PA), there is a mention that on the hue and cry
of the complainant, Khurram Shahzad (since dead), his brother, namely
Naveed, and his sister, Salma Bibi, reached the place of occurrence. Qaisar
Abbas fired straight at the complainant, hitting him on the right side of his
chest. The names of the witnesses were mentioned in the FIR (Ex. PA).

Salma Bibi (PW-7) deposed during the cross-examination that: -

“---It_is correct that I got recorded in my statement
before the police that I was sitting inside the house
whereas accused Qaiser_ Abbas and deceased Khuram
Shahzad were sitting outside the house. I got recorded in
my statement before police that after hearing noise I
went out the house---I did not get record in my statement
before the police that any altercation was happened in
between_my _ brother Khuram Shahzad_and_accused
Qaiser Abbas within the area of Sarokey. I got recorded
in my statement in the court that deceased Khuram
Shahzad and accused Qaiser_ Abbas were sitting in the
haveli---it is correct that there is small path and a “Nala”
in front of our house. Door of our house opens in the
street. It is correct that no witness from the surrounding
houses is in this case. My brother Naveed PW arrived in
the village one day prior to the occurrence---I do not
know that normally there is tradition in the villages that
people sleep after offering Esha prayer. I do not know
that whether deceased Khuram Shahzad and accused

Qaiser Abbas were sitting on the ground, or on the cots
or_on the chairs. I do not know how much time it will
take of the journey from our village to the hospital. I do
not know the distance in between police station Kunjah
and our village---”

Naveed (PW-11) deposed during the cross-examination that: -
M.R No.371 of 2018, 11
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

“_T and Khuram Shahzad came from Lahore _ to

Sarookey on the same day i.e. on 25.08.2015. Occurrence
was happened on 26.08 .2015---The injured was shifted to
Hospital by “1122”. I off and on visit the house of my
sister Salma Bibi---I do not know that whether accusing
Qaiser Abbas and deceased were sitting on the ground,

on cots or on the chairs---”

The dying declaration (Ex. PP) of Khurram Shahzad reveals that he went to
the Haveli of Qaiser Abbas, the accused, where the incident took place. In
the dying declaration (Ex. PP) of Khurram Shahzad, it was mentioned as
under: -

The presence of the witnesses at the Haveli at about 11:00 P.M. and near the
place of occurrence is highly improbable. Faique Abbas S.I. (PW-5) deposed

during the cross-examination that: -

“---It__is correct that information about alleged
occurrence was not given by Salma Bibi and Naveed
PWs of the instant case. It is correct that any figure of
concerned locality did not support the version of
prosecution’s case. The information of the alleged
occurrence was received at Kunjah on the mid night of
26/27.05, again stated 08" month of 2015at about 11/12’0
clock through mobile phone---I did not enter_in the
relevant about the person through whom I received the
information---The person who gave ___ telephonic
information did not mention the name of any accused
and manner of occurrence. I did not mention about the
receipt of alleged occurrence in the relevant register. On
injury statement, the factum of being injured was told by
some person, again stated that it was told by the
concerned injured---It is correct that I went through the
medical certificate of then injured and perused the same
M.R No.371 of 2018

MR No.3 /1 of 2016, 12

Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

kept in the case file. It is correct that as per Exh.P I, as
per statement of sister of injured, injured had drunk and
he came out of his taking pistol with him, entered into
the house of neighbour, quarrel took place and fire hit. It
is correct that as per Exh.PJ, the medical certificate of
then injured, sister_of injured did not nominate accused
Qaiser_ Abbas present _in the court. When I prepared
sketch of injuries Exh.P.G, no person was present. It is
correct that on Exh.P.G the name of any accused could
not mention. Rupt No.38 dated 26.08.2015 is not attached
with the record---It is correct that medical of injured was
conducted through police. As per Exh.P.G, according to

the sister_of then injured Salma Bibi has not deposed
that she herself witnessed the occurrence nor Naveed

PW_witnessed the occurrence. It is correct that when I
saw the then injured, he was wearing only “pent”. No
mobile, perse or any other articles of the then injured
was not taken into possession by me. It is correct that
besides the house of accused Qaiser, no Haveli of said
accused was situated there. It is correct _that_as per
statements of Salma PW and Naveed PW _ dated
26.08.2015, the alleged occurrence took place in the
Haveli of Qaiser_accused. It is correct that in the house of
Qaiser_accused_ shown in site plan Exh.P.F, the alleged
occurrence or the collection of bloodstained was not
found proved. It is correct that whatever was pointed by
the PWs, I prepared the site plan, Exh.P.F, accordingly.
It is correct that I did not show the residence of sister of

the then injured or PWs near or around the haveli of
Muhammad Aslam s/o Nazar Muhammad or the house
of Qaiser accused in Exh.P.F. The house of complainant
party was situated with the gape of three to four houses
from the house of Qaiser_ accused shown in Exh.P.F---It
is_correct_that_ the FIR of alleged occurrence was
registered with the delay of about five to six hours---”

Faiz Ahmad S.I/1.0. (PW-12)-investigating officer deposed during cross-

examination that:

“---It is correct that when the investigation of the instant
case_was entrusted to me I went through whole of the
record. As per statement of PW Salma Bibi mentioned
on_Exh.P.I, Khuram Shahzad, the then injured _was
drunk when he went out from his house while taking
pistol with him and he went to the house of neighbourer

and where fight took place and fire was hit. It is correct
that in said statement of PW-7 Salma Bibi there is no

mentioned of accused who made fire shot. It is correct

that_as per column No.1 of inquest report Ex.P.L, the
dead body of deceased Khuram Shahzad was recovered
M.R No.371 of 2018, 13
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

from village Sarookey. It is correct_that_on 27.08.2015
one Rana Muhammad Usman joined investigation. Said
Rana Muhammad Usman was the relative of deceased

Khurram Shahzad_as well as PWs Salma Bibi and
Naveed. It_is correct that said PW Rana Muhammad

Usman did not support the statements of PWs Naveed
and Salma Bibi. PW Naveed is the real brother of
deceased Khuram Shahzad---”

It is the prosecution's case that the incident took place in the house of Qaiser
Abbas, the accused, and on the pointing of Salma Bibi (PW-7) and Naveed
(PW-11), the unscaled site plan (Ex. PN) was prepared by Faiz Ahmad
S.I/LO. (PW-12)-investigating officer. Faiz Ahmad S.I/I.0. (PW-12)-
investigating officer deposed during examination-in-chief that: -

“_--On 29.08.2015, I summoned the brother of the

complainant Naveed and Muhammad _ Asif Akhtar
Nagash draftsman and took rough notes from the place
of occurrence. Draftsman prepared scaled site plan and
handed over to me three leaves Exh.P.B/1-3. I made red

notes upon Exh.P.B. My red_ notes are Exh.P.B/4-6. I
recorded the statement of draftsman u/s 161 Cr .P.C---”

Faiz Ahmad S.I/1.0. (PW-12)-investigating officer deposed during cross-

examination that: -

“It is correct that J got prepared site plan Exh.P.B on
the pointation of PWs Salma Bibi and Naveed which I
signed _on 03.09.2015. It is correct that_as per site plan
Exh.P.B, the occurrence took place in the Havaili of
Muhammad Aslam s/o Nazar Muhammad. It is correct
that as per my investigation occurrence took place in the
house of above said Muhammad Aslam. It is correct that
during my investigation, occurrence did not take place in
the house/Havaili of Qaiser Abbas accused. It is correct
that_on the pointation of PWs Salma and Naveed, site
plan Exh.P.B was prepared and the place of occurrence
was found the house of above said Muhammad Aslam. It
is correct that aforementioned Muhammad Aslam did
not join investigation in support of the version of the

complainant party. It is correct that said Muhammad
Aslam is not the witness of said case---It is correct that

the aforementioned Haveli/house, was consisted_on four
boundaries, having an iron gate. It is correct that I did
not show the house of PWs Salma Bibi and Naveed
situated_around the place of occurrence---it is correct
that_accused_Qaiser_had independent house in village
Sarokey. Nothing was recovered from the house_of
accused Qaiser---”.

M.R No.371 of 2018, 14
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

Salma Bibi (PW-7) deposed during the cross-examination that: -

“---It is correct that there is small path and a “Nala” in
front of our house. Door of our house opens in the street.
It is correct that no witness from the surrounding houses
is in this case. My brother Naveed PW _ arrived in the
village one day prior to the occurrence---I do not know
that normally there is tradition in the villages that people
sleep_after_offering Esha prayer. I do not know that
whether deceased Khuram Shahzad and accused Qaiser
Abbas were sitting on the ground, or on the cots or on
the chairs. I do not know how much time it will take of
the journey from our village to the hospital. I do not
know the distance in between police station Kunjah and
our village---”

Naveed (PW-11) deposed during the cross-examination that: -

“---It_is correct that adjacent to the house of my sister
Salma Bibi there is a path and a “Nala” (drainage) in

front of her house. The door of the house of Salma Bibi
opens towards passage. There are two doors of the house
of my sister Salma Bibi and both doors open on the side
of said path---We pointed the place of occurrence to 1.O
as well as the point where we were sitting---”

The prosecution also has not proved the place of occurrence. Faiz Ahmad
S.1/1.0. (PW-12)-investigating officer deposed during cross-examination

that: -

“---It is correct that I got prepared site plan Exh.P.B on
the pointation of PWs Salma Bibi and Naveed which I
signed on 03.09.2015. It is correct that as per site plan
Exh.P.B, the occurrence took place in the Havaili of
Muhammad Aslam s/o Nazar Muhammad---It is correct
that during my investigation, occurrence did not take
place in the house/hevaili of Qaiser Abbas accused---”

The actual place of occurrence has not been duly proved. As regards the

place of occurrence, Faiz Ahmad S.1/1.0. (PW-12)-the investigating officer,
has stated that the place of occurrence is not the Haveli of Qaiser Abbas, and
the same is the Haveli of Muhammad Aslam, son of Nazar Muhammad.
Besides being highly interested, all the prosecution witnesses have also
made irreconcilable contradictions on material points, rendering their
evidence incredible. With this background, the presence of the alleged eye-
witnesses on the spot seems doubtful. This is a very serious infirmity that

destroys the credibility of the witnesses' evidence. If the evidence of these
M.R No.371 of 2018, 15
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

witnesses is rejected as untrustworthy, nothing survives the prosecution case,

and it would not be safe to rely upon such evidence.

9. The motive set up by the prosecution in the Fard Bayyan (Ex.
PP) and FIR. (Ex.PA) and deposed about it by Salma Bibi (PW-7) and
Naveed (PW-11) have been found by us to have remained un-proved. The
prosecution case in this regard was vague and could hardly inspire

confidence. Salma Bibi (PW-7) deposed during cross-examination that: -

“---I did not get record in my statement before the police
that_any altercation was happened _in between _my
brother Khuram Shahzad and accused Qaiser_ Abbas
within the area of Sarokey---”

10. Therefore, the evidence led by the prosecution in connection
with motive is not sufficient for placing reliance on the testimonies of the
witnesses for committing the occurrence. Motive is a double-edged weapon
for the occurrence and for false implications. There are always different
motives that operate in the mind of the person in making false accusation. In
the circumstances, we cannot avoid the conclusion that the motive, as
alleged, was an afterthought and has not been proved by any credible

evidence.

11. We have noticed that no doubt 30-bore pistol (P-4) along with
two live bullets (P-4/1-2) was allegedly recovered on the pointing of Qaiser
Abbas, appellant-accused and there is no report of the Forensic Science
Laboratory, Lahore, that the weapon had matched with the crime empties.
As no crime was empty was recovered from the place of occurrence which
could be matched with the weapon recovered. Contrary to it, the report of
Forensic Science Laboratory (Ex. PS) reflects that the allegedly recovered
weapon was in working condition, therefore, there is no incriminating
recovery in this case available on record to connect the appellant with the

commission of offence.

12. In view of the above circumstances, the conclusion we arrived
at is that there is no credible evidence to establish that Salma Bibi (PW-7)
and Naveed (PW-11), eyewitnesses, have brought true facts before the court.

The prosecution had badly failed to lead incriminating,
M.R No.371 of 2018, 16
Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018

corroborative/independent evidence to bring home guilt of the accused. In
this background, the benefit of doubt is to be extended in favour of the
accused. In the case of Muhammad Akram v. The State (2009 SCMR

230), wherein it has been held as under:-

“----Benefit of doubt---Principles---For given the benefit
of doubt it is not necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating doubts---Single circumstance
creating reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the
guilt of accused makes him entitled to its benefit, not as a
matter of grace and concession, but as a matter of right.”

13. The upshot of the above discussion is that the prosecution has
badly failed to bring home charge against the appellant beyond any
reasonable doubt, therefore, in the interest of safe administration of criminal
justice, Crl. Appeal No.250896 of 2018, filed by the appellant, Qaisar
Abbas is accepted _in toto. The conviction and sentence awarded by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Gujrat vide judgment dated 14.11.2018,
is set_aside and the appellant, is acquitted of the charge in a case F.ILR
No.593/2015, dated 26.08.2015, offence under Section 302 PPC, registered
at the police station, Kunjah, District Gujrat. The appellant, Qaisar Abbas
son of Riaz Ahmad, who is in custody, is ordered to be released forthwith, if

not required in any other case.

14. Murder Reference No.371 of 2018, forwarded by the learned
trial court for confirmation of sentence of death inflicted upon the convict

fails, which is answered in NEGNATIVE.
