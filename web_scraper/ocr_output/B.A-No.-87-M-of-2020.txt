JUDGMENT SHEET

PESHAWAR HIGH COURT, MINGORA
BENCH (DAR-UL-QAZA), SWAT
(Judicial Department)

B.A. No, 87-M/2020

ORDER
Date of hearing: 13.03.2020

Petitioners: - (Rooh-ul-Amin & another) by
Muhammad Razig, Advocate.

Respondents: - (The State & another) by Mr.
Sohail Sultan, Astt: Advocate General and Mr.

Hazrat Rehman, Advocate. —
WIQAR AHMAD, J.- This order is directed to

dispose of bail application of the petitioners namely
Rooh-ul-Amin and Muhammad Zahid, who have
been arrested and are behind bars in case F.I.R No.
219 dated 09.11.20 19 registered under sections 302, 324,

337 F (iii), 34 PPC at Police Station Timergara District

Dir Lower.

2. FIR in the case in hand was registered on
the basis of ‘Murasila’ sent by Shahid Khan, IHC of
police station Timergara Dir Lower. Report of the
occurrence was lodged by one Gohar Ayub in ‘the
emergency ward of DHQ hospital Timergara, wherein he
stated that they had joint ancestral property (geal! 0 5} 53)’
situated at village Kotko Shah. The accused namely
Rooh-ul-Amin, Zahid sons of Abdur Rehman
(petitioners) and Zahir Shah son of Shah Rawan

(co-accused) had cultivated seeds of wheat in their

property after ploughing it with a tractor, a day before.
Brothers of the complainant namely Shah Khalid, Ayub
Nawaz and his nephew namely Usama were altercating
with the accused-party over their acts of ploughing their
land at the time of occurrence. The altercation turned into
a scuffle and then the petitioners commanded their co-
accused Zahir Shah, who was having a Kalashnikov, to
kill the complainant-party, whereupon he started firing on
them, causing numerous injuries to Shah Khalid resulting
into his death, and causing firearm injuries to his brother
Ayub Nawaz as well as his nephew Usama, while the
complainant escaped un-hurt. The occurrence was stated .
to have been witnessed by Alla-ud-Din and Rasool
Muhammad. Land dispute was disclosed to be a motive
behind the occurrence and all three accused were charged
for commission of the offence in furtherance of their

common intention.

3. Learned counsel for petitioners stated
during the course of his arguments that the
accused/petitioners have been assigned the role of raising
a proverbial /alkara and as such case against the
accused/petitioners was that of further inquiry. The
learned counsel in this respect placed reliaance upon the

judgments reported as 2012 SCMR 265 and 2011 MLD

210.

4 Learned counsel for complainant submitted
in rebuttal that role of accused/petitioners was very

crucial in giving aid and support to the main accused and

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
had they been not present on the spot, then the principal
accused namely Zahir Shah could not have committed the
offence with such an ease. The learned counsel also added
that challan has been put in Court and trial has
commenced, which fact also requires dismissal of the
instant application. The learned counsel relied upon the
judgments reported as 1980 P Cr. LJ 21, 1987 MLD

3174 and 2001 P Cr. LJ 295. The learned Astt: A.G

appearing on behalf of the State adopted arguments of

learned counsel for complainant.

5. I have heard arguments of learned counsel
for the parties, learned Astt: A.G for the State and perused

the record.

6. Perusal of record reveals that the
accused/petitioners have been attributed no overt act in
the commission of the offence except making a verbal
command to the main accused namely Zahir Shah for
opening firing on the complainant-party. The weapon of
offence i.e. rifle of 7.62 mm bore, normally known as
Kalashnikov has also been recovered on pointation of the
principal accused. FSL report reveals that all empties
recovered from the spot have been fired from the
Kalashnikov recovered at the instance of main accused.
Question of their joining common intention with the
principal accused or abetting the commission of the main
offence, shall best be determined by the learned trial
Court after recording of evidence, but case of the

accused/petitioners is found to be that of further probe, at

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad

the moment. The Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of

“Talib Jan v/s The State and another” reported as “2012

SCMR 265” had extended bail to the accused in similar

tole. Relevant part of the judgment is reproduced

hereunder for ready reference;

“5. Two person are charged in the F.I.R. Petitioner is
charged for commanding his son while the latter, who has
gone into hiding, has been charged for firing effective shot
at the deceased. Whether the role assigned to the petitioner
is a result of exaggeration which, more often than not, is
resorted to in this part of the country to rope in even elder
of the family so that he may not be at large to pursue the
litigation; whether stay of the petitioner in the village
despite being named in the F.I.R could be held to be more
consistent with his innocence rather than guilt when his
son charged for the effective shot has gone into hiding ,

after the occurrence and whether the role of commanding

attributed to a person who himself is armed with a

Kalashnikov could be held to be ornamental or at par with
abetment, as is contended by the learned counsel for the
State, are the questions calling for further inquiry and
thus tilt the scales of justice in favour of bail rather than

jai ”

Further reliance in this respect may be
placed on the judgments in the case of Wazir Muhammad

Ws The State reported as_1978 SCMR 448, the case of

Sher Khan v/s The. State reported as_1980 SCMR 448,

the case of Muhammad Haroon v/s The State reported as

Nawab (S.B,) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
5

1994 SCMR 216] and the case of Mumtaz Hussain v/s

The State reported as 1996 SCMR 1125.

7. Challah has no doubt been put in court and
the case is under trial. In such a case, superior Courts
have normally been exercising some restraint in granting
bail, because of the reason that findings in such cases may
affect the outcome of trial. But it does not mean that bail
should invariably be refused even if case of an
accused/petitioner is found to be that of further inquiry.
The reasons recorded for allowing of the instant
application are not of such a nature which will affect
outcome of the trial in any manner. A five members
Bench of the Hon’ble Apex Court, in the case of
“Muhammad _Ismail_v/s_Muhammad_Rafique and
another” reported as PLD 1989 Supreme Court 585 has

held in this respect;

“The first point is not much in context. It is well-known
_practice of the superior Courts of Pakistan that when a
murder case is fixed for hearing ordinarily, the bail
applications are not decided on merits and the matter is

often left to the discretion of the trial Judge.”

Further ahead in the said judgment the

matter was concluded in the following words;

“It is apparent that when the Court finds that the two
essential conditions contained in section 497(2) Cr.P.C.
are satisfied the accused shall become entitled as of right

to bail. In the impugned order the learned Judge, it seems,

Nawab (S.B.) Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
without saying so in so many words, felt that the two
conditions existed in this case- (a), that "there are not
reasonable grounds for believing that the accused has
committed (a) non-bailable offence)";(b), that there are
sufficient grounds for further inquiry into his guilt."
Accordingly the accused had become entitled to be

released on bail.

The question then arises; “whether, subsection (2) of
section 497 Cr.P.C. would have operation notwithstanding
the aforestated practice of this Court. Much discussion is
not necessary in this behalf. When an accused person
becomes entitled as of right to bail under subsection (2) of
Section 497 Cr.P.C. the same cannot be withheld on the
ground of practice; because, the latter is relatable to
exercise of discretion while the former is relatable to the

exercise and grant of right,”

Further reliance in support of the said
principle can be placed on the judgments reported as

“2013 SCMR 49, 2014 SCMR 49 and 2012 YLR 896.

8. In light of what has been discussed above,
case against the accused/petitioners is found to be that of
further inquiry and they are therefore admitted to bail.
These are the reasons for my short order of even date,

which read as follows;

“For reasons to be recorded later, this application for bail
is allowed and accused/petitioners Rooh-ul-Amin and
Muhammad Zahid involved in case FIR No. 219 dated
09.11.2019 registered under sections 302, 324, 337 F (iii),
34 PPC at Police Station Timergara District Dir Lower
are directed to be released on bail provided each on of
them furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs. 400,000/-

(fourt hundred thousand) with two sureties each in the
like amount to the satisfaction of learned trial Court, who
Shall ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men

of means.” .
