Criminal Revision
No. 194-2018 and
P.S.L.A No.39-2018

SARDAR AHMED NAEEM, J.- Appellants, namely, Zahid

Rasool and Gulfam Hussain along-with their co-accused Muhammad
Afzal (since acquitted) faced trial in a private complaint under
section 302,34 PPC filed by the complainant due to defective
investigation of case FIR No.243-2016 dated 30.6.2016 under
section 302,34 PPC registered at Police Station Shah Kot,
Chichawatni. At the conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court vide
judgment dated 30.11.2017, acquitted Muhammad _ Afzal _ co-
accused, whereas, held guilty, convicted and sentenced the
appellants as under:

Under section 302, 34 PPC and sentenced to
imprisonment for life each as ‘tazir’ with the direction
to pay a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- each as envisaged under
section 544-A, Cr.P.C, in default thereof, to further
undergo, six months SI.

Benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. was also extended

to them.

2. Feeling aggrieved from the above said judgment, the
appellants have filed instant appeal and the complainant / petitioner

has also filed Criminal_Revision _No.194_ of 2018 against

respondents No.2 and 3 to award the major penalty of death and
P.S.L.A No.39 of 2018 against acquittal of respondent No.2. I

propose to decide all these matters through this single judgment.

3. The epitome of story as contained in private complaint was
that on 30.6.2016 at about 6:30 a.m Imran Hussain went to his
fields for ploughing and when he did not return after sufficient time,
the complainant, Sabir Hussain and Mohsin Hayat (PWs) started
his search and reached near the poultry farm of Nazeer Ahmad,
where on raising lalkara by Muhammad Afzal (acquitted co-
accused), Gulfam Hussain (appellant) armed with repeater 12 bore
made three fire shots at Imran Hussain (deceased) which hit on his
right shin, left leg and right foot. Zahid Rasool made four fire shots
with his pistol 30 bore at Imran Hussain (deceased) hitting on his left
arm, below his belly and went through and through from the back
side of deceased and hit on left knee and back of his right leg.
Imran Hussain (deceased) fell down and besmeared in blood. The
witnesses could not come forward to rescue the deceased due to the
threats extended by the appellants-accused and then they fled
away from the crime scene while brandishing their respective
firearm weapons towards Chak No.51/12-L.

The motive behind the occurrence was that cattles of the
accused persons quite often entered in the complainant’s field and
destroyed their standing crops which often resulted into fight.

4. Initially, the FIR No.243-2016 was registered under section
302,34 PPC. Later on, due to defective investigation and on account
of declaration of innocence of Muhammad Afzal (acquitted co-
accused) and Gulfam Hussain(appellant), the complainant filed the
private complaint.

5. After cursory statements of complainant and his witnesses,

receiving the documentary evidence and hearing the complainant,
Criminal Appeal No.1133 of 2017 3
Criminal Revision No.194 of 2018
P.S.L.A No.39 of 2018

the appellants along-with Muhammad Afzal (acquitted co-accused)
were summoned to face trial. ,
6. The charges were framed against the accused persons. They
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
7. The complainant Abdul Jabbar himself appeared as (PW.1)
and produced Mohsin Hayat (PW.2), gave up Sabir Hussain (PW)
being unnecessary and on his application, PWs of state case were
summoned as CWs including Syed Azhar Naqvi MO (THQ) Hospital
(CW.1), Amjad Ali 1182-C (CW.2), Saeed Akhtar draftsman (CW.3),
Nisar Ahmad 885-C (CW.4), Muhammad Imtiaz (CW.5) Muhammad
Riaz 986-HC (CW.6), Ghulam Nabi (CW.7), Muhammad Asif Sarwar
SHO (CW.8) and Abid Sagheer Inspector/investigating officer (CW. 9).
Learned prosecutor gave up Muhammad Aslam 1299-C Haji
Ghafar, Haji Munawar and Muhammad Akram Asif SI CWs.
8. Learned counsel for the complainant closed his evidence.
Whereas, learned DDPP closed the prosecution case’ after
tendering into the reports of PFSA Exh.PF & Exh.PG.
9. Statements of the appellants under section 342, Cr.P.C. were
recorded. They repudiated the allegations levelled against them and

professed innocence. To a question “Why this case against him and

why the PWs have deposed against him” _ Zahid Rasool (appellant)

deposed as under:

“It is false case, basically proceedings regarding this
occurrence basically proceedings regarding this occurrence
were carried out on the basis of Exh.CW.08/A wherein
different story and different roles were attributed but later
on, in order to fill the lacunae of the complainant has filed
this private criminal complaint with considerable and
unexplained delay of 09 months with due deliberation and
consultation. All the PWs are close relatives inter se and
inimical towards me and my co-accused. In fact, Imran
deceased was a womanizer having so many enemies in the
area. It was un seen and un witnessed occurrence which took
place in the dark hours of the night. FIR was lodged against
me and my _ co-accused after the autopsy with due
deliberation and consultation. The dead body was recovered
in the area of Chak No.51/12-L. I am involved in this case
due to enmity, party faction, political rivalry and for the
purpose of blackmailing.”
Criminal Appeal No.1133 of 2017 4
Criminal Revision No.194 of 2018
P.S.L.A No.39 of 2018

Responding to same question, Gulfam Hussain (appellant) also

took the same plea in his statement under section 342, Cr.P.C.
Neither the appellants appeared as their own witnesses under

section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced evidence in defence.
10. Learned counsel for the appellants, inter-alia, contended that
the prosecution miserably failed to prove its case against the
appellants beyond reasonable shadow of doubt; that the occurrence
took place on a thorough fare but no independent witness was cited
by the prosecution; that the witnesses failed to account for their
presence at the time and place of occurrence; that the ocular account
is contradicted by the medical evidence; that the eye witnesses
made deliberate improvements to bring the case of prosecution in
line with the medical evidence; that the motive in this case was not
proved; that the place of occurrence was not established; that the
Investigating Officer concluded that one Waqas was responsible for
this occurrence and challaned him as an accused; that certain
material facts were suppressed by the prosecution; that one of the
appellant, namely, Gulfam Hussain along-with his acquitted co-
accused Muhammad Afzal was found innocent by the Investigating
agency; that the prosecution story does not fit in the probabilities;
that the case of prosecution was replete with doubts and every
doubt even slightest is always resolved in favour of the accused,
thus, the appellants are entitled to acquittal.
11. Learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor assisted by the
counsel for the complainant opposed this appeal with vehemence
and submitted that it was a daylight occurrence and there was no
question of mistaken identity; that the eye witnesses have furnished
the ocular account in a straightforward manner; that both the
appellants have been ascribed specific roles of causing repeated
firearm injuries to the deceased, supported by medical evidence
available on record; that the motive was proved; that the
discrepancies referred to by the learned counsel for the appellants

were negligible; that the learned trial Court acquitted co-accused of
Criminal Appeal No.1133 of 2017 5
Criminal Revision No.194 of 2018
P.S.L.A No.39 of 2018

the appellants contrary to law; that as the case against the
appellants was proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable
shadow of doubt, thus, the sentence awarded to them may suitably
be enhanced.

12. I have considered the points raised at the bar and have
perused the record with able assistance of the learned counsel for
the parties.

13. During this occurrence, Imran Hussain (the deceased) lost his
life on 30.6.2016 at 6:30 a.m within Square No.5 of Chak
No.52/12-L Chichawatni, Sahiwal. He had gone to his fields early
in the morning for ploughing. He did not come back and_ being
worried, the complainant, namely, Abdul Jabbar along-with Sabir
Hussain and Mohsin Hayat (PWs) went after him and when they
reached near poultry farm of Nazir Jat, they saw that Muhammad
Afzal co-accused of the appellants while standing in square No.6
raised a lalkara to eliminate the deceased and then the appellants
with their respective weapons fired at the deceased.

14. The motive behind the occurrence was that the cattles of the
accused party used to destroy. the standing crops of the
complainant party and earlier the deceased was beaten/injured by
the accused party. On 02.11.2015, he was medically examined
through MLR No.113-AN/15 Tehsil Head Quarter Hospital,
Chachiwatni and rapat No.14 was also recorded at Police Station
on 02.11.2015. The accused after enacting the episode fled away
from the crime scene. The matter was reported to police and FIR
No.243 under section 302,34 PPC was registered at Police Station
Shah Kot Chachiwatni. During the investigation, a co-accused,
namely, Muhammad Afzal and the appellant, namely, Gulfam
Hussain were found innocent, thus, being dissatisfied with the
investigation, the complainant filed the private complaint, wherein
the accused were summoned to face trial, held guilty, convicted

and sentenced as detailed above.
Criminal Appeal No.1133 of 2017 6
Criminal Revision No.194 of 2018
P.S.L.A No.39 of 2018

15. The complainant was real brother of the deceased. Whereas,
Mohsin Hayat (PW.2) was nephew and Sabir Hussain (given up PW)
was their Chachazad. It was in the evidence that people were
attracted to the spot at the time of occurrence but no independent
witness was cited by the prosecution. The incident was reported by
the complainant to police at Chak No.86/12-L at 8:00 a.m on
30.6.2016 through a_ written application. Thereafter, the
investigating officer inspected the spot, took into possession two
crime empties, blood stained earth and dispatched the dead body
for postmortem examination, conducted by Dr. Syed Azhar Naqvi
(CW. 1) on 30.6.2016 at 2:47 p.m. He observed twelve injuries on the
person of the deceased. The injuries Nos.1,3,5,7,9 and 10 were
entry wounds, however, the dimensions and width of all entry
wounds were different. The time between the injuries and death
was instantaneous and between the death and postmortem was 7
to 8 hours. He has admitted during the cross-examination that he
observed no corresponding hole on ‘Qamiz’ and ‘Shalwar’ of the
deceased and that the postmortem was conducted immediately
after the receipt of death body i.e. at 2:47 p.m. He further admitted
that probable time between death and postmortem was calculated
from the available police papers and possibility could not be ruled
out that probable period between death and postmortem was
about 12 to 16 hours as in this case rigor mortis was fully
developed and the postmortem staining was present. Though the
witnesses claimed to have seen the occurrence and ascribed specific
role of causing repeated firearm injuries to the appellants but this
fact is not supported by the available evidence.

16. The occurrence took place on 30.6.2016 at 6:30 a.m and the
autopsy was held on the same day at 2:47 p.m. As mentioned
above, rigor mortis in this case was fully developed. The rigor mortis
is a postmortem change which leads to stiffening of the body,
muscles because of chemical changes in the myofibrils. It helps in

estimating the time since death as well as to recognize if the body
Criminal Appeal No.1133 of 2017 7
Criminal Revision No.194 of 2018
P.S.L.A No.39 of 2018

was moved after death. The position of the body plays a major
role in case of rigor mortis as it is indicative of the position of the
body at the time of death, unless the position is disturbed by
external forces or putrefaction. The primary reason for the
development of rigor mortis is the loss of adenosine or triphosphate
from the anoxic tissue. It starts to develop 2 to 4 hours after death
and gradually dissipates until approximately 72 hours after death.
Classically, rigor mortis is said to develop sequentially beginning
from eyelids, jaw and neck followed by the limbs. The joints of the
body become fixed when the rigor is fully developed, and the state
of flexion of these joints depends upon the position of the trunk and
limbs at the time of death. It is due to chemical changes affecting
the proteins of muscles fibers. This is sign of the end of cellular life
of the muscles. Rigor mortis is one of the important factors in
determining time since death. It passes away in the same order as
it comes on. Time of onset varies greatly in different cases. But on
an average it may be said to commence 2-4 hours after death. It’s
only a temporary condition depended upon the body temperature
and other conditions. The phenomenon is caused by the skeletal
muscles partially contracting as was unable to relax, so the joints
become fixed place. Maximum stiffness is reached around 12-24
hours. As mentioned above in this case rigor mortis was fully
developed and the medical officer had not ruled out the possibility
regarding time of death in between 12 to 24 hours which is not
inconsonance with the time of occurrence as described by the eye-
witnesses. Algor mortis, Rigor mortis and Livor mortis has been the
basis for ascertaining the time since death collectively.. Till date, it is
still the important and most fascinating criteria to ascertain the
time since death. This assessment covers the importance of the time
since death from rigor mortis in forensic science.

17. Next comes postmortem staining which is called livor mortis
but it is finally changed in classical triad. The postmortem staining

is an intravascular phenomenon and there is no extravasation of
Criminal Appeal No.1133 of 2017 8
Criminal Revision No.194 of 2018
P.S.L.A No.39 of 2018

blood in the area. As the postmortem staining occurs externally on
the dependent parts of the body, it also occurs at the dependent
parts of all the internal organs, the blood of these organs settle at
their dependent parts. It is said that man is the most cunning of all
animals. Chameleon changes its color during lifetime but the man
changes his color even after his death. It is self evident that
longer the interval of time between death and the examination of
the body, the wider will be the limits of probability. Various methods
have been tried to find out the time of death. These include study of
physical, chemical, biochemical, histological and enzymatic changes
which occur progressively in a dead body. Postmortem lividity is
one of the physical changes useful for estimating time of death to a
certain degree of accuracy. Postmortem lividity is one of the
important signs of death. It is also called the “darkening of death”
because shortly after death, in from 20 minutes to 2 hours usually
purple red blotches begin to appear in the skin. Within first 3-4
hours after death these livid blotches may be blanched out by
pressure of the finger against the skin only to return when the finger
is removed. The forensic significance of this change in the stability
of the lividity is that if the position of the dead body has been
changed after death but before lividity is fixed the findings of two
different areas of distribution of lividity, such as in front and behind
may serve as mute evidence that the body has been moved since
death.

18. Postmortem lividity is a bluish or reddish purple discoloration
due to capillo-venous distension with blood, at the undersurface of
the skin of the dependent parts of the body, due to settling of blood
in those areas due to pull of the gravity, when circulation to keep the
blood in motion ceases.

19. Lividity will not develop in that region which is in actual
contact with the surface on which the body is lying due to occlusion
of the toneless capillaries by the pressure of the body. These areas

are known as contact pallor. Similarly it is not seen on those parts,
Criminal Appeal No.1133 of 2017 9
Criminal Revision No.194 of 2018
P.S.L.A No.39 of 2018

which have been compressed by tight clothing or tight rapping of a
sheet, but occurs as a strip of bands called vibices.

20. Fixation of postmortem lividity occurs mainly due to certain
physical factors. Firstly, after the formation of the postmortem
lividity blood cannot easily pass through the capillaries. Secondly,
by the time there has been total settling of the blood, rigor mortis is
well established all around the body. This change in the muscle
obliterates the big vessels passing through them. Hence after this
period, the blood cannot pass through these vessels to settle in the
small venules and capillaries in the new areas.. Thirdly, after full
establishment of rigor mortis, the venules lie almost empty and
compressed in the rigid muscles at that time and cannot be easily
distended by the resettling blood.

21. Reverting to the facts, the place of occurrence was square No.5
at Chak No.52/12-L, Chachiwatni. The deceased had gone by a
tractor for ploughing the fields. No tractor was taken into possession
or shown in the un-scaled or scaled site plan. After sustaining the
firearm injuries, the deceased fell down and was lifted by both the
eye witnesses, who claimed that their clothes got blood stains but
neither those clothes were taken into possession during the
investigation nor produced by the PWs. The complainant being
dissatisfied with the investigation filed the private complaint with
his own story but has not appended any scaled site plan with the
private complaint nor cited any other draftsman in the calendar of
witnesses appended with Exh.PC

22. The scaled site plan in this case was prepared by Saeed
Akhtar CW.3. He was not cross-examined by the complainant
despite the fact that he was afforded an opportunity. However,
during the cross-examination by the defence, CW.3 admitted that
he took rough notes at the pointing out of the eye witnesses and on
instructions of police. He further admitted that he has not mentioned
any square number in the scaled site plan. He gone on to add that

the occurrence took place within the boundaries of Chak No.51/12-
Criminal Appeal No.1133 of 2017 10
Criminal Revision No.194 of 2018
P.S.L.A No.39 of 2018

L. The Investigating Officer appeared as CW.8 and also admitted
during the cross-examination that the occurrence took place in Chak
No.51/12-L, thus, despite the fact that being dissatisfied with the
investigation, the complainant filed private complaint but even then
has mentioned the place of occurrence as square No.5 in Chak
No.52-L, Chichawatni, therefore, the prosecution failed to prove the
place of occurrence.

23. So far as, the presence of the eye witnesses at the place and
time of occurrence is concerned, that is also doubtful as their names
did not find mention in the inquest report either in column No.4 or
column No.24 and despite their acclaimed presence, the dead body
was escorted to mortuary by CW.4. The statement of the medical
officer further suggested that the dead body was shifted to
mortuary from Police Station, which belied the stand of the eye
witnesses that the dead body was shifted to mortuary from the
place of occurrence.

24, Another aspect of the matter cannot be lost sight of as the
Investigating Officer disclosed in the cross-examination that Abdul
Ghaffar a motorcycle rickshaw driver was the first person who
made a phone call to 1122, which is also evident from Exh.DA and
the statement of the Investigating Officer further revealed that he
had no friendship with anyone from the parties as the parties were
Jat’ by caste and Abdul Ghaffar was ‘Rajpoot’ by caste. He also
admitted during the cross-examination that as per his investigation,
the complainant and PWs Mohsin Hayat and Haji Sabir Hussain
(given up PWs) were not present at the place and time of
occurrence. He further admitted that he did not confirm the
participation of Muhammad Afzal (acquitted co-accused) and
Gulfam Hussain (appellant) in this occurrence and as such declared
them innocent.

25. Regarding motive, suffice it to observe that the motive is nota
component of murder as certain crimes are motive-less and it lies

deep in the mind of the perpetrator of the crime. It is also settled
Criminal Appeal No.1133 of 2017 11
Criminal Revision No.194 of 2018
P.S.L.A No.39 of 2018

that the prosecution is not bound to introduce the motive but once a
motive is set up and then not proved, it adversely effects the case of
prosecution. Though the witnesses claimed the destruction of their
crops by the cattle of the accused party and allegedly, Imran
Hussain (the deceased) was beaten by the accused party three
days prior to the occurrence but no such documentary proof was
produced during the investigation as admitted by the Investigating
Officer during the cross-examination, thus, the motive in this case
was not proved.

26. As mentioned above, the appellant Gulfam Hussain was
declared innocent by the investigating agency and no recovery was
effected from him. Whereas, Zahid Rasool (appellant) was arrested
in this case on 14.8.2016 and got recovered pistol (CW.2/1), from
his house not in his exclusive possession. Even otherwise, the
weapon allegedly recovered from the appellant was found in
working condition, thus, recovery was also inconsequential.

27. Learned counsel for the complainant argued that the
occurrence in this case took place on 30.6.2016 and the appellant
Gulfam Hussain was arrested on 09.11.2016 after about five
months of the occurrence and remained absconder for considerable
period but this fact was not asked from the appellant in his
statement recorded under section 342, Cr.P.C., thus, no benefit of
the absconsion of the appellant can be availed by the prosecution.
28. Taking from whatever angle, the story described by the eye
witnesses does not fit in the probabilities as they offered no
resistance to any of the assailant when their near and dear was
fired at by the accused-appellants in their presence. They claimed to
have lifted and dispatched the deceased to hospital but did not
produce their blood stained clothes during the investigation. The
inquest report was silent about their names and the dead body was
escorted by a police constable to mortuary. The rigor mortis was
fully developed and the postmortem staining was present and that

medical officer had not ruled out the possibility regarding time
Criminal Appeal No.1133 of 2017 12
Criminal Revision No.194 of 2018
P.S.L.A No.39 of 2018

between the death and postmortem between 12 to 24 hours.
Assuming for the sake of arguments that the eye witnesses were
present at the crime scene and had witnessed the occurrence but
their presence is belied by host of circumstances. A similar question
came up _ for consideration before apex Court in “Muhammad

Saleem _V. The State” (2010 SCMR 374) at page 377, the apex

Court was pleased to observe as under:

vescees General rule is that statement of a witness must be in-
consonance with the probabilities fitting in the circumstances of
the case and also inspires confidence in the mind of a reasonable
and prudent mind. If these elements are present, then’ the
statement of a worst enemy of the accused, can be accepted and
relied upon without corroboration but if these elements are missing
then the statement of a pious man can be rejected without second
thought. Reference is invited to Haroon alias Harooni V. The State
and another 1995 SCMR 1627. The acid test of veracity of a
witness is the inherent merit of his own statement. It is not
necessary that an impartial and independent witness, who is
neither related to the complainant nor inimical towards the
accused would stamp his testimony necessarily to be true. The
statement itself has to be scrutinized thoroughly and it is to be
seen as to whether in the circumstances of the case the statement
is reasonable, probable or plausible and could be relied upon. The
principle, that a disinterested witness is always to be relied upon
even his statement is unreasonable, improbable and not plausible
or not fitting in the circumstances of the case then it would lead to
a very dangerous consequences. Reference is invited to Muhammad
Rafique V. State 1977 SCMR 454 and Haroon V. The State 1995
SCMR 1627”

29. It is an axiomatic principle of law that in case of doubt, the
benefit thereof must resolve in favour of the accused. It was
observed by the Hon’ble apex Court in Tariq Pervaiz v. The State:
(1995 SCMR 1345) that for giving benefit of doubt it was not

necessary that there may be many circumstances creating doubts
and if there is circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a
prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then accused would be
entitled to the benefit of doubt. In this context case of Muhammad
Akram v. the State (2009 SCMR 230) can also be referred to.

30. It is settled principle of law that benefit of doubt even slightest
must be resolved in favour of the accused and without any
reservations. Reliance is placed upon case reported in ARIF
HUSSAIN and others V. THE STATE through Advocate-General and
another (2005 YLR 2279). It is well settled principle of law that to

Criminal Appeal No.1133 of 2017 13
Criminal Revision No.194 of 2018
P.S.L.A No.39 of 2018

give benefit of doubt to an accused is much more than a mere rule of
law. It is the rule of prudence which no man ought to and no judge
acting in accordance with provisions of Qanoon-e-Shahdat, can
ignore and this rule was vigorously enforced by Islam.

31. At this stage, it may be mentioned that the role ascribed to the
appellants in the crime report was different than that of private
complaint as in the FIR, two fires were attributed to Gulfam Hussain
(appellant) hitting right shin and left thigh of the deceased and two
fires were also attributed to Zahid Rasool (appellant) hitting left
wrist and abdomen of the deceased but in the private complaint,
attribution was somewhat different as three fires were attributed to
Gulfam Hussain (appellant), whereas, four fire shots were assigned
to Zahid Rasool (appellant) may be for the reason that the
complainant/ prosecution improved his version to bring that in line
with the medical evidence keeping in view the number of injuries
observed by the medical officer during the postmortem examination,
thus, the prosecution neither established the place of occurrence nor
presence of the eye witnesses is suggested from the available
material. The motive was also not proved. The recovery was
inconsequential. The independent witness, namely, Abdul Ghaffar
was not adduced during trial. The information received by 1122
was also concealed/suppressed. The medical officer observed
twelve injuries on the body of the deceased but heinousness of crime
is not ground for conviction if the prosecution case is not proved to
the hilt. The occurrence might have taken place wherein the
deceased lost his life but not in the mode and manner as described
by the eye witnesses. It appeared that they have not described the
complete and accurate tale by withholding the material facts and,
thus, prosecution failed to prove its case against the appellants
beyond reasonable shadow of doubt.

32. Ina recent case, titled Najaf Ali Shah Versus The State (2021
SCMR 736), the apex Court observed as under:

«9, Mere heinousness of the offence if not proved to the hilt is
not a ground to avail the majesty of the Court to do complete

‘irfan

Criminal Appeal No.1133 of 2017 14
Criminal Revision No.194 of 2018
P.S.L.A No.39 of 2018

justice. This is an established principle of law and equity that it is
better that 100 guilty persons should let off but one innocent person
should not suffer. As the preeminent English jurist William
Blackstone wrote, “Better that then guilty persons escape, than that
one innocent suffer.”. Benjamin Franklin, who was one of the
leading figures of early American history, went further arguing “it
is better a hundred guilty persons should escape than one innocent
person should suffer. All the contradictions noted by the learned
High Court are’ sufficient to cast a shadow of doubt on the
prosecution’s case, which entitles the petitioner to the right of
benefit of the doubt. It is a well settled principle of law that for the
accused to be afforded this right of the benefit of the doubt it is not
necessary that there should be many circumstances creating
uncertainty and if there is only one doubt, the benefit of the same
must go to the petitioner. This Court in the case of Mst. Asia Bibi v.
The State (PLD 2019 SC 64) while relying on the earlier judgments
of this Court has categorically held that “if a single circumstance
creates reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the apprehension
of guilt of an accused, then he/she shall be entitled to such benefit
not as a matter of grace and concession, but as_of right. Reference
in this regard may be made to the cases of Tariq Pervaiz v. The
State _(1998 SCMR 1345) and Ayub Masih v. The Stat (PLD 2002 SC
1048).” The same view was reiterated in Abdul Jabbar v. State
(2010 SCMR_ 129), when this Court observed that_once a_single
loophole is observed in a case presented by the prosecution, such in
the _ocular_account_and_ medical evidence _or presence of eye-
witnesses being doubtful, the benefit of such loophole/lacuna in
the prosecution’s case automatically goes in favour of an accused.”

33. Seeking guidance from the observations of their lordships and
respectfully following the same, I accept this appeal and set aside
the impugned judgment. The appellants are acquitted of the charge.
They are in jail and be released forthwith if not required in any
