2. THC Siraj Muhammad (PW-9) went
to the emergency ward of civil hospital Thana
along with other police ‘Nafri’ on receipt of
_information of the occurrence and found a young
boy on the hospital bed, who was not in his
senses. Muhammad Bilal Khan companion of the
injured reported the matter to the police officer
that he closed his shop and went to the shop of
fish seller Khalil-ur-Rehman. along with his
injured companion namely Manzoor son of Shah
Rome, that night. They were gossiping and’
laughing with each other while.sitting in the said
shop. The convict namely Ibrahim who was
servant in the said shop came towards them and
asked them as to why they had been laughing and
started quarreling with the complainant and his
companion Manzoor. The complainant further
alleged that he got injuries on his lips and face
with the blows which he received during the
scuffle. The convict was stated to have taken out
a pistol from the trouser-fold of his Shalwar and

fired at Manzoor, who received the fire shot on

his face and got injured, while the complainant
escaped un-hurt miraculously. Other people
present there were stated to have witnessed the
occurrence. The complainant charged the convict
Ibrahim for ‘firing at him and his companion
namely Manzoor. Later on, the said Manzoor
died in the hospital and FIR was registered
against the convict on the basis of the. above
stated information under sections 302,324,337 A
6) PPC at Levy Post Thana District Swat.
3. Investigation started in the case, the
accused could not be arrested and challan was
submitted against him under section 512 Cr.P.C
in the Court of learned Sessions Judge/Zila Qazi
Batkhela on 10.08.2015. The statements of the
prosecution witnesses were recorded and the
accused was declared proclaimed offender on
08.10.2015. Later on the accused was arrested on
10.02.2016 after six (6) months and 18 days of
the occurrence. Supplementary challan was
submitted against the accused on 17.02.2016.
Evidence of the rest of the prosecution witnesses
was recorded while statement of PW Muhammad

Bilal, which had been recorded in the

NAWAB DS Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
proceedings under section 512 Cr.P.C was
transposed to the record of the trial by the learned
trial Court. On conclusion ‘of evidence of
prosecution, statement of the appellant was
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C. Arguments
were heard and the accused/appellant was later
on convicted and sentenced to the punishment
given in the opening Para of this judgment.

4, The learned counsel for the
appellant invited the attention of this Court
towards the statement of the DFC recorded on
04.05.2017 and stated that the subsequent
proceedings of transposition of the statement of
Muhammad Bilal PW to the record of the instant
case was with malafide intention preventing the
counsel for the accused in the trial from
conducting cross-examination of the said witness.
He further added that a single statement of the
DFC was made the basis for transposing the
statement of the PW Muhammad Bilal and the
trial Court did not make any further efforts for
ascertaining the fact stated in the statement of the
DFC or procuring the attendance of the PW
Muhammad Bilal. He placed reliance on the

NAWAB OB Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
. "Mr. Justice Wiqar Anmad
judgment in the case of “Mrs. Shagufta Shaheen
w/s The State” reported as reported “2019
SCMR 1106” and submitted that the accused had
not been given a fair trial and was thus materially
prejudiced in the defence of his case.

5. The learned Astt: Advocate
General appearing on behalf of the State
defended the mode and manner in which the trial
was conducted before the learned trial Court
as well as the conviction and awarding of the
punishment to the accused and stated that since
the Court could not procure the attendance of PW
Muhammad Bilal, therefore. it was justified in
transposing his statement to the record of the
instant case.

6. We have heard arguments of
learned counsel for the appellant and learned
Astt: A.G for the State and perused the record.
Father of the deceased namely Shah Rome had
appeared before the Additional Registrar of this
Court on 31.12.2018 and had stated that he did
not want to engage a private counsel in the case

in hand. His thumb impression, has also been

7. Perusal of record reveals that
Muhammad Bilal was the sole eye-witness
available with the prosecution. Statement of the
DFC was recorded on 04.05.2017 as SW-1 and
on that very day the statement of the PW
Muhammad Bilal which had earlier been
recorded in the proceedings under section 512
Cr.P.C was transported to the record of the
instant case. The learned trial Court had not made
any further efforts for procuring the attendance of
the said PW. The statement of the DFC that the
said PW had gone to Saudi Arabia for earning his
livelihood, was considered as sufficient evidence
of the fact itself. No further evidence of the fact
that he had in-fact left the country for Saudi
Arabia could be called by the learned trial Court
so as to satisfy itself that the accused had in-fact
left the country. In quite similar situation the

Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of

“Fazal Muhammad and another v/s The State”

reported as “7970 P Cr. LJ 858” dealt the matter

in the following manner;

NAWAB DB Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali *
Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
“Mr. A.K Brohi contended that no sufficient evidence

was led to prove the non-availability of the doctor or
that his attendance could not be procured without an
amount of unreasonable delay or expense. On this
point, all that the prosecution managed to establish
from the evidence of Muhammad Habib was that Dr.
Azhar had left the country since the year 1966, but
on cross-examination, he said that he had left
Rawalpindi from Zafarwal on transfer and he did not
know where he went afterwards. The post-mortem
reports prepared by Dr. Muhammad Azhar could be
admitted into evidence under section 32 (2) of the
Evidence Act, being statements which he had
prepared in the discharge of his professional duty,
provided it was shown that the witness could not be
found or his attendance could not be procured
without unreasonable delay or expense. This
requirement of law was not adequately satisfied in
this case.”

In the case of “Ali Haider v/s The

State” reported as “PLD 1958 Supreme Court

(Pak) 392”, the Hon’ble Court expressed the
following view;

The point was raised before them that the
Statements of Muhammad Husain (P. W. 1), Noor
Hussain (P. W. 2) and Kala Khan, foot constable (P.
W. 3), as recorded by the Committing Magistrate,
were illegally transferred to the Sessions record. The
learned trial Judge had ordered those statements to
be read as evidence at the trial on the ground that
their depositions were of a formal nature, Apparently
the witnesses in question were not summoned at the
trial, at the suggestion of the Public Prosecutor, in
order "to avoid unnecessary expenses" to the State.
The learned Judges considered that the objection
raised had no merit. The procedure adopted by the
trial Judge was held to be not illegal and it was
observed that if it could, "by any stretch of
imagination be said to be irregular", the defect was
curable under S. 537, Criminal Procedure 'Code,:
because no prejudice had been caused to the accused.

We are constrained to observe that there was a
flagrant dis regard of the provisions of S. 33 of the
Evidence Act in transferring the statements of the
three witnesses in question to the Sessions record,
without laying the foundation for that course, by
adducing strict proof that the witnesses were
incapable of giving evidence or that their presence
could not be secured without an amount of delay or

NAWAB OB Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
expense which under the circumstances ol the case,
the Court could justifiably regard as unreasonable.
The procedure adopted was clearly not warranted by
the reasons mentioned by the learned trial Judge.
Reference in this connection may be made to
Chanchal Singh v. Emperor (AIR 1946 P C 1) and
Aminul Haq v. Crown (P L D 1952 F C 63). The
order of the learned Judge in this respect appears to
have been acquiesced in by the learned counsel for
the accused, but it is clear that in a criminal case the
provisions of S. 33 of the Evidence Act could not
have been waived. As a result, the statements of these
three witnesses must be kept out of consideration as
they cannot be said legally to form part of the
evidence in the case.

In the case of “Allah Ditta v/s The
State” reported as “PLD 1958 Supreme Court
(Pak) 290”, the statement had been transported
on the basis of statement of the Investigating
Officer. The Hon’ble Apex Court did not approve
the practice and observed as follows;

The Public Prosecutor requested that Lala's evidence

in the committing Court should be transferred to the
record of the trial under section 33 of the Evidence
Act. Counsel appearing for the accused persons
stated that he had no objection if the request was
granted, and thereupon the trial Judge made an
order admitting the evidence in which he declared
that Lala's evidence could not be procured "without
delay and unnecessary adjournment" and he noted
particularly that the defence counsel had no
objection to the course which he was asked by the
Public Prosecutor to take, Accordingly the evidence
was read in the case as evidence against the accused.
It is con-, tended with great force that the trial Court
misapplied section 33 of the Evidence Act and on this
point reference was made to the observations of the
Judicial Committee in the case of Chainchall Singh
(L R (72) 1 A 270). The action of the trial Judge was
not supported before us by the Advocate-General of
West Pakistan, and we consider that it was clearly not
within the provisions of section 33 aforesaid. On this
point, it will be sufficient to cite the observations
made by the Privy Council in the case mentioned
above, with which we are in full agreement. These
are as follows :-

NAWAB DB Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
"Where it is desired to have recourse to section
33 of the Evidence Act on the ground that a witness
is incapable of giving evidence that fact must be
proved, and proved strictly. It is an elementary right
of an accused person, ... that a witness who is to
testify against him should give his evidence before
the Court trying the case, which then has the
opportunity of seeing the witness and observing his
demeanour and can thus form a far better opinion as
to his reliability than is possible from reading a
statement or deposition. It is necessary that provision
Should be made for exceptional cases where it is
impossible for the witness to be before the Court, and
it is only by a statutory provision that this can be
achieved. But the Court must be careful to see that
the conditions on which the statute permits previous
evidence given by the witness to be read are strictly
proved".

The case before their Lordships of the Judicial
Committee was one where a Police-officer had
testified with regard to the absent witness that he
found him ill and unable to move from his house, as
he was suffering from tuberculosis. Their Lordships
held that the officer (presumably a constable) was not
a@ proper person to prove from what disease the
witness was. suffering and could only speak from
hearsay on the point. Moreover, as to the witness's
incapacity he could only speak of illness on a date 13
days before the date for which the witness was
summoned to give evidence. On these facts it was
held that there was no evidence before the Court that
the witness was incapable of giving evidence on the
later date.”

In the case in hand also the mere
statement of DFC was made the basis for
transporting the statement of the prosecution
witness recorded under section 512 Cr.P.C,
which was not a safer course and cannot be
allowed in the circumstances of the case. It was a
serious issue as the accused had been facing trial
under the charge of commission of an offence
carrying a capital punishment. The importance of
the witness both for the prosecution as well as the

NAWAB DB Mr. Justice Syed Afahad All
Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad ‘
S

defence also required that the learned trial Court
should have exercised due diligence in the matter.
Being the sole eye-witness of the occurrence as
well as complainant in the case he was not only
important for the prosecution but for the defence
as well (for the purpose’ of his cross-
examination). His cross-examination would have
also been beneficial for the trial Court as well as
this Court for achieving its due satisfaction for
the purpose of safe administration of justice.

8. By now the right to a fair trial has
been included in the fundamental rights of a
citizen by insertion of Article 10 (A) in the
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan,
1973. Safeguards earlier taken by the Hon’ble
Courts in our jurisdiction were mostly anchored
in criminal procedural laws, beside those
developed in judge made laws in pursuance to the
intrinsic desire of the Hon’ble Courts for
ensuring right of fair trial to the accused. But
now the situation requires added care and caution
as the nature of right to fair trial has been
converted from a _ legal right to a
fundamental right by way of the Constitution

(Eighteenth Amendment) Act 2010. Right to
cross-examination is the most cherished part of
the right of an accused during the trial. The said
right may or may not prove beneficial to the
accused in a particular case but same has always
been beneficial to the Courts in deciphering the
hidden facts, in discovering the real issues, in
uncovering the buried realities and thus reaching
at the right and just conclusions. It is due to the
efficacy of this practice of cross-examination
that Courts of law are able to unearth the reality
and discover the facts even from mouths of
untruthful witnesses. Section 512 Cr.P.C is not
the normal course but an exception to the
normal practice of conducting a criminal trial.
As held by the Hon’ble Apex Court in the case
of “Arbab Tasleem v/s The State” reported as
“PLD 2010 Supreme Court 642” the general
rule of evidence is that only such statement is
legal and admissible which is given during the
course of judicial proceedings on oath and is
taken by a person authorized under the law to

take down the evidence and it is made in the

presence of the adverse party giving him right
to cross-examine the deponent. It further
provided that there were two exceptions to the
general rule one being an exception provided
by Article 46 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984 which is commonly known as dying
declaration and the other being a statement of a
witness recorded under section 512 CrP.c. A
statement under section 512 Cr.P.C being an
exception to the general rule can only be
resorted to when the conditions precedent for
adopting such a practice are adhered to. The
said conditions require great degree of care and
caution at the following two stages;

a). When the Court proceeds against’
an accused and allows the prosecution to
produce evidence under section 512
Cr.P.C, it must satisfy itself that the
accused had knowledge of the proceedings
and had gone into absconsion;

b). When such a_ statement is
transposed to the trial of an accused after
his arrest. The latter being a situation
which may have serious consequences for
the accused, requires more care in
adopting it.

As held earlier we could not find the
learned trial Court to have taken the required care

and caution, in the case in hand.

9. In view of what has been discussed
above, on partial acceptance of the instant appeal,
the conviction and sentence awarded to the
appellant by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge Malakand at Batkhela vide his judgment
dated 08.07.2017, impugned herein is set aside
and the case is remanded back to the learned trial
Court with the direction to make all-out efforts to
procure the attendance of PW Muhammad Bilal
for recording his testimony in the Court, before
resorting to the measure of transposition of the
statement recorded under section 512 Cr.P.C.
