SHAKEEL AHMAD:-J: — The appellant Bilal was adjudged

- Juvenile Court, Nowshera, under section 302(b) PPC, and was
convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for life on two counts
with the direction to pay a sum of Rs.1,00,0000/- to the legal
heirs of the deceased according to their shari shares, in default
of payment of compensation to suffer six months S.J. The
sentences were ordered to run consecutively, with the facility
provided under the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000.
Benefit of section 382-B, Cr.PC, was extended vide judgment
dated 21.2.2015.

2. The prosecution story, as set forth in the murasila

(Ex. PA/1), are that Naheed Hussain ASI (PW-11), on receipt.
of information on 31.5.2010, rushed to the Civil Hospital,
Pabbi, and found dead body of Sikandar, aged about 26/27
years and Gohar Zaman, aged about 34/35 years, sons of
Muhammad Zaman, where Muhammad Zaman son of Shadi
Khan caste Khattak, aged about 65/66 years, reported the matter
to the police stating that he along with his wife Mst. Jan Bibi,
aged about 60/62 years, Akbar Zaman son of Shah Zaman,
(PW-6) and his son, namely Sikandar Zaman and Gohar
Zaman, were proceeding from their house to Peshawar. As
soon as they reached the place of occurrence, the accused
namely, Saeed, Bilal sons of Ghulam Haider and Ghulam
Haider son of Haider Khan, who are his co-villagers, were
already present there and started indiscriminate firing at
Sikandar and Gohar Zaman, from their respective firearms, due
to which his sons were hit and expired on the spot, the
complainant could’ do nothing being empty handed. The
occurrence was reported to have been witnessed by the
complainant, his wife Mst. Jan Bibi and grandson Akbar Zaman
son of Shah Zaman. The motive, as alleged in. the FIR, is

dispute over women folk. After commission of offence, the
accused decamped from the spot. The report of the complainant
was reduced into writing by drafting the ibid Murasila, which
was thumb impressed by his wife Mst. Jan Bibi, subsequently,
Murasila was incorporated into FIR (Ex PA). Since the
accused had gone into hiding, therefore, challan under section-
512 Cr.PC, was submitted against them. After recording
statements of the PWs, they were declared as proclaimed
offenders and perpetual warrants of arrest were issued against
them vide order dated 22.2.2011. Meanwhile, the appellant
Bilal was arrested on 26.3.2012, by (PW-7), whereafter,
supplementary challan was submitted against him to be tried
under Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000. After
compliance of provisions of section 265-C Cr.PC, formal
charge was framed against him, to which he pleaded not guilty
and claimed trial.

3. In order to prove its case, the prosecution produced
as many as 17 witnesses. The medical evidence was furnished
by Dr. Ijaz Akbar (PW-1), who on 31.5.2010 conducted the
Post Mortem on the dead body of the deceased Sikandar.

Anwar Ali Khan SI (PW-2) submitted challan under section
512 Cr.PC against the accused. Muhammad Ashraf SI (PW-3)
incorporated the contents of Murasila into FIR (Ex PA).
Shakeel Ahmad Inspector (PW-4), submitted challan against
appellant under Juvenile Justice System Ordinance. The ocular
account of the incident in question was furnished by
Muhammad Zaman (PW-5) and Akbar Zaman (PW-6). Jehan
Akbar (PW-7) arrested the appellant and also recovered
Kalashnikov (Ex P-1) along with 25 rounds (Ex P-2) vide
recovery memo (Ex PW 7/1) and issued card of arrest (Ex PW
7/2). Zia ur Rehman (PW-8) is the marginal witness to the
recovery memo (Ex PW 7/1). Hazrat Ali SI (PW-9) produced
the appellant before the trial court for obtaining his physical
custody and obtained two days physical custody of the accused,
stated about the various steps taken by him during this period.
Jehan Ali (PW-10) is the marginal witness to the recovery
memo (EX PW 9/5). Naheed Hussain (PW-11) recorded the
Murasila (EX PA/1) prepared inquest report (EX PW 11/1) and
injury sheet (Ex PW 11/2) of the deceased Sikandar and inquest
report (EX PW 11/3) and injury sheet (Ex PW 11/4) of the

deceased Gohar Zaman. Fazal Akbar (PW-12) is marginal
witness to the recovery memo (Ex PW 12/1) vide which the LO
took into his possession the blood stained earth from the spot
and recovery memo (Ex PW 12/2) vide which the I.O took into
possession 17 empties of 7.62 bore and one empty of 30 bore
from the spot. He is also marginal witness to the recovery
memo (Ex PW 12/3) and (Ex PW 12/4) vide which the I.0 took
into possession the bloodstained garments of the deceased.
Musharaf Shah (PW-13) is identifier of the dead body of the
deceased Sikandar Zaman. Haji Akbar (PW-14) is the identifier
of the dead body of deceased Gohar Zaman. Muhib Gul SI
(PW-15) is the I.O stated about the various steps taken by him
during the investigation of this case. Jehangir Khan (PW-16)
was entrusted with warrants under section 204 Cr.PC (Ex PW
16/1), whereon his report is (Ex PW 16/2), he also took notices
under section 87 Cr.PC (Ex PW 16/3), whereafter he submitted
his report (Ex PW 16/4). Dr. Muhammad Nazir (PW-17)
conducted post mortem on the dead body of the deceased Gohar
Zaman. After closure of prosecution evidence, the accused was
- examined under section 342 Cr.PC, wherein he professed

innocence, however, he wished to be examined on Oath and
6

also opted to produce defence, but subsequently, brother of the
appellant submitted affidavit that DW has been threatened by
the complainant party and police as well, therefore, they are
reluctant to appear before the Court, under these circumstances
he backed out from his earlier plea and refused to produce
defence witness and denied to be examined on Oath. At the
conclusion of trial, the accused was convicted and sentenced as
stated above, hence, this appeal.

4. It has been argued by the learned counsel for the
appellant that it is an un-witnessed crime; that (PWs-5 & 6) are
not only related inter-se with the deceased but they are inimical
towards the appellant; that presence of (PWs-5 & 6) was highly
doubtful, as purpose was not shown for coming out from the
house and proceeding to Peshawar; that witnesses deposed that
indiscriminate firing was made by the accused, the eye-
witnesses were also in their range of firing as is reflected from
the site plan, and it does not appeal to the common sense that
they were left alive to become witnesses against the appellant;
that the investigating officer carried out dishonest investigation

in the instant case at the behest of one Fazal Akbar SHO of
District Nowshera, whose sister was married to deceased
Sikandar; that 17 empties of 7.62 bore were recovered from the
spot, but these empties were not sent to FSL to ascertain as to
whether these were fired from one, and the same weapon or
from different weapons, therefore, it speaks volumes on the part
of the investigating officer; that post mortem report, site plan
and version of the eye-witnesses, if placed, in a juxtaposition
are contradictory inter-alia; that abscondence of the accused has
no value, when the oral evidence is not believable; that motive
is a double edged weapon, has got both ends; that the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case against the
appellant beyond a ray of doubt.

5. Conversely, the learned counsel representing the
complainant and the learned A.A.G appearing on behalf of the
State supported the impugned judgment by jointly arguing that
(PWs-5 & 6) are the natural witnesses; that the incident took
place at a short distance from the house of the complainant; that
the evidence of the witnesses is corroborated by medical

evidence coupled with abscondence of the appellant; that the
8

prosecution has proved its case against appellant beyond a ray
of doubt and prayed for dismissal of the appeal.

6. We have heard arguments of learned counsel for
the parties at length and have carefully gone through the record
of the case.

7. The incident in the present case according to the
prosecution had taken place at 8.45 AM on 31.5.2010 on the
thoroughfare of village Jarooba near the house of one Gulab
Khan, as is reflected from site plan (Ex PB), the distance
between place of occurrence and police station was not
recorded, the matter was reported by Muhammad Zaman (PW-
5) father of deceased at the Civil Hospital, Pabbi, through
Murasila (Ex PA/1) recorded by Naheed Hussain ASI (PW-11)
on 31.5.2010 at 9.50 AM under section 302/34 PPC,
subsequently it was incorporated into FIR (Ex PA) by (PW-3).
8. It is cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence
that ocular account in such cases plays a decisive and vital role
and once its intrinsic worth is accepted and believed then the
rest of the evidence, both circumstantial and corroboratory in

nature, would be required as a matter of caution. To the
contrary, once the ocular account is disbelieved then no other
evidence, even of a high degree and value, would be sufficient
for recording conviction on a capital charge, therefore, we have
to see the probative value of the ocular account in the light of
the facts and circumstances of the case.

9. Scanning of the record discloses that in the FIR
address of the complainant (PW-5) is shown village Jarooba,
however, when his statement was recorded before the trial
Court, his residential address was recorded Madina Colony
Phase-I], Nowshera. Similarly, residential address of Akbar
Zaman eyewitness (PW-6) is written as Ashoor Abad,
Nowshera. His residential address is neither mentioned in the
FIR nor his signature was taken on the initial report recorded in
the shape of Murasila (EX PA/I) rather it was thumb
impressed by the wife of the complainant namely Jan Bibi. The
residential addresses recorded in the statement of both the Pws
are far away from the scene of crime. Neither the I.O has taken
the pain to verify the place of their residence nor the witnesses
provided anything in black and white to show that in fact they

were residing in village Jarooba during the days of occurrence
10
and that after occurrence they had abandoned their residence
from village Jarooba; admittedly, both the PWs are residing in
different places at District Nowshera, as is reflected from their
residential addresses recorded in their statements. Both these
witnesses deposed that on the eventful day and time they were
going to Peshawar, but they did not give any reason for going to
Peshawar, they were bound to give reasonable explanation for
going to Peshawar along with the deceased and Mst. Jan Bibi,
but they failed to give the reasons for going to Peshawar. (PW-
5) has admitted in the cross examination that he had a shop at
Peshawar during the days of occurrence. This PW (PW-S5) in his
cross examination stated that Akbar Zaman (PW-6) was
studying at Peshawar and resided at Sadar Ahmad Khan
Colony. Muhammad Naheed (PW-11), who recorded the initial
report in the shape of Murasila (Ex. PA/1) admitted in his cross
examination that no specific reason for going to Peshawar was
given by the complainant. This fact is also admitted by the 1.0
(PW-15) in his cross examination. The prosecution has failed to

bring anything on record to show that for what purpose (PWs-5
11

& 6) had come to the village and accompanied the deceased and
Mst. Jan Bibi for Peshawar on the day of incident.

10. In the absence of such proof the eye-witnesses i.e.
complainant and Pw Akbar Zaman could be held to be chance
witnesses, as on the day of incident, the complainant was
running business in a shop at Peshawar, and (PW-6) Akbar
Zaman was studying at Peshawar and residing there. Peshawar
is several miles away from the scene of crime.

11. Chance witness, in legal parlance, is one who
claims that he was present on the crime spot at the fateful time,
albeit his presence there was a sheer chance as in the ordinary
course of business, place of residence in normal course of
events, he was not supposed to be present on the spot, but at the
place where he resides, carries on business and runs day to day
life affairs. It is in this context that the testimony of chance
witness ordinarily, is not accepted unless justiciable reasons are
shown to establish his presence at the crime scene at the
relevant time. In normal course, the presumption under the law
would operate about his absence from the crime spot. True that

in rare cases, the testimony of chance witness may be relied
12
upon, provided some convincing explanation appealing to
prudent mind for his presence on the crime spot are put forth,
when the occurrence took place otherwise, his testimony would
fall within the category of suspected evidence and cannot be
accepted without a pinch of salt. In this respect reliance can
well be placed on the case reported as Khalid Javed and
another vs. The State (2003 SCMR 1419), wherein it was
observed that evidence of chance witness would be acceptable
subject to establishing his presence at the place of incident and
in the absence of corroborative evidence to support the version
of a chance witness the same had to be excluded from
consideration. In this behalf reliance can also be placed on the
cases reported as Javed Ahmad alias Jaida vs. The State
(1978 SCMR 114), Muhammad Ahmad & another vs. The
State & others (1997 SCMR 89), Imran Ashraf & others vs.
The State (2001 SCMR 424) and Zafar Hayat vs. The State
(1998 SCMR 896). In the case of Aah Ditta vs. The State
(1999 YLR_ 1478), the Hon’ble Lahore High Court held that
chance witnesses cannot safely be relied upon on a capital

charge in the absence of satisfactory explanation regarding their
13

presence near the place of occurrence where they were
ordinarily expected to be present. In the case of Muhammad
Akram vs. The State (2008 P.Cr.L.J_ 993), it was observed
that chance witness cannot be believed safely if he fails to offer
cause of his presence at the spot at a given time.

12. The matter does not end here, in the initial report
recorded in the shape of Murasila (Ex PA/1), the nature and
description of weapon was not given by the complainant, this
fact was also admitted by Muhammad Naheed (PW-11) as well
as Investigating Officer (PW-15) in their statements. However,
when the 1.0 visited the spot and made recovery of 17 empties
of 7.62 bore and one empty of-30 bore pistol, the nature and
description of weapon of offence was recorded in the site plan
(Ex PB). The accused Saeed and Bilal were given the role of
firing from Kalashnikov and Ghulam Haider was attributed the
role of firing from pistol. The Investigating Officer did not
bother to send 17 empties of 7.62 bore (recovered from the
scene of crime) to FSL to ascertain as to whether these empties
were fired from one weapon or more. However, when the

appellant was arrested and a Kalashnikov was allegedly
14
recovered from his possession, anda separate FIR No.207 dated
26.3.2017 under section 13 A.O was registered against him at
Police Station Pabbi, these empties of 7.62 bore along with
Kalashnikov were sent to FSL to ascertain as to whether these
empties were fired from the Kalashnikov allegedly recovered
from possession of the accused or not. However, its report was
received in negative, therefore, it is of no help to the
prosecution, as it has not been proved that this Kalashnikov was
used in the commission of offence.

13. Another interesting feature of the case is that none
of the PWs i.e complainant (PW-5) and Akbar Zaman (PW-6)
were cited as identifier of the dead bodies in the inquest report
and post mortem report of the deceased. The inquest report
prepared by Muhammad Naheed (PW-11), Haji Jehan Akbar
was shown as the identifying witness of the dead body of Gohar
Zaman, while that of deceased Sikandar Zaman Musharaf Shah
and Maroof Shah. It was urged by the learned defence counsel
that the dead bodies were brought to the hospital in the absence
of complainant and Akbar Zaman (PW6), therefore, they were

not shown as identifier of the dead bodies. This glaring
15

omission casts serious doubt about the presence of the two self
claimed eyewitnesses at the spot.

14. There is another glaring aspect of the case that the
complainant (PW5), eyewitness Akbar Zaman (PW6) and Mst.
Jan Bibi, all of them were in the firing range of the accused, as
is evident from the site plan (Ex PB) but the accused did not
fire at them and spared them to become eyewitnesses against
them, having same degree of motive against them as alleged by
the prosecution, this too supports contention of the learned
counsel for the appellant that the eyewitnesses were not present
on the spot. Complainant (PW-5) admitted in his cross
examination that his son namely Qamar Zaman was charged for
committing murder of Zarin Akbar son of Said Akbar, about
1/2 years prior to the instant occurrence, meaning thereby, that
the complainant party had blood-feud enmity with the other
person.

15. Next we have to see the evidentiary value of the
“motive” as given in the FIR for the commission of offence.
The same to our mind, has not been proved during the trial by

producing cogent evidence. The same has not been disclosed
16.

with full details. Besides, it is vague, it is hazy. Strangely, even
in the statement recorded before the Court, neither the
complainant (PW-S5), nor Akbar Zaman (PW-6) unfolded the
details of motive. This fact alone. injects an element of
falsehood regarding the alleged motive as setup in the FIR. No
doubt, the prosecution is not required to disclose/setup a
motive, but once it chooses to do so, then it becomes its
obligation to prove it by cogent evidence. Failure to do so shall
not only damage the credibility of the prosecution case beyond
repair, but it would also be fatal for the prosecution case.

16. We have also noticed that the sister of (PW-12)
Fazal Akbar, was married to deceased Sikandar Zaman, he was
SHO at District Nowshera during the days of occurrence. It was
urged by the learned counsel for the appellant that the entire
investigation was carried out at his behest. This PW has
admitted in the cross examination that his sister was married to
deceased Sikandar Zaman. This fact was also admitted by the
complainant (PW-S5) in his cross examination. He also admitted

that during the days of occurrence, the said Fazal Akbar was
17

posted as SHO at District Nowshera. Therefore, the defence
plea carries weight.

17. Adverting next to the abscondence of the
appellant, no doubt it is a relevant fact and it can be used as
corroborative piece of evidence, which cannot be read in
isolation, but it has to be read along with substantive piece of
evidence. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case
of Asad-Ullah ys, Muhammad Ali_ (PLD 1971 SC 541), held
that corroborative and ocular evidence are to be read together
and not in isolation. As regards abscondence the Hon’ble Apex
Court in the case of Rasool Muhammad..vs..Asal
Muhammad 1995 SCMR 1373 observed that abscondence is
only a suspicious circumstance. In the case of Muhammad
Sadig Vs. Najeeb Ali (1995 SCMR 1632), the august Supreme
Court of Pakistan held that abscondence itself has no value in
the absence of any other evidence. It was also held in the case

of Muhammad Khan Vs. The State (1999 SCMR 1220), that

abscondence of the accused can never remedy the defects in the

prosecution case. In the case of Gul Khan..vs...State (1999

SCMR_ 3004) it was observed that abscondence per se is not
18

sufficient to prove guilt of the accused, but can be taken as a
corroborative piece of evidence. In the cases of Muhammad
Arshad Vs. Qasim Ali (1992 SCMR 814), Pir Badshah Vs.
State_(1985 SCMR_ 2070) & Amir Gul Vs. State, (1981
SCMR_182), it was held by the Hon’ble Apex Court that
conviction on abscondence alone cannot be sustained. In the
present case, substantive piece of evidence in the shape of
ocular account has been disbelieved by us, therefore, no
conviction can be based on abscondence alone.

18. Lastly, coming to refusal of the accused to produce
defence witness or to be examined on oath, once opted for the
same, it does not go against him, the brother of the appellant
submitted an affidavit before the learned trial Court, that the
DW has been threatened by the complainant party, therefore, he
is reluctant to depose before the. Court and also explained the
reason for refusing to be examined on oath. This does not go
against the accused. The principle that legal burden of proof
always rests upon the prosecution, is the most fundamental

principle of criminal jurisprudence.
19

19. Viewed and discussed from all angles, we are of
the firm opinion, that it is an un-witnessed crime, the motive
has not been established, non-sending of empties of
Kalashnikov to FSL to ascertain as to whether these empties
were fired from one and the same weapon or different weapons,
therefore, it could not be proved that firing from Kalashnikov
was made by more than one assailant, the eyewitness can
convincingly be held to be a chance witness and when they are
interested in the prosecution of the appellant because their
testimony is not corroborated by a single shred of evidence.

20. In view of the opinion formed by us, it is difficult
to subscribe to the view taken by the learned trial Court, we are
therefore, of the considered view that the impugned judgment
whereby the appellant was convicted cannot be sustained in
law.

21. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed and the
impugned judgment of the learned trial Court is set aside. The
appellant stands acquitted of the charge, he shall be set-at-

liberty forthwith, if not required in any other case.
20

Above are the reasons of our short order of even

date.
