QAISER RASHID KHAN, J:- Accused-petitioner

Abu Bakar Siddique seeks his release on bail in case FIR
No.380, dated 9.6.2020, under Sections 377 PPC read
with section 53 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child
Protection and Welfare Act, 2010 of Police Station
Katlang, District Mardan, with the allegations that he had
committed unnatural offence with the minor son of the
complainant.

2. All that the learned counsel for the accused-
petitioner vehemently contends is that the accused-

petitioner has been falsely charged in a delayed FIR by

Altaf Hussain, PS Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
the complainant; that the FSL report is not available on
the file to show that the accused-petitioner has in fact
committed sodomy with the minor son of the
complainant; that the accused-petitioner is a juvenile and
lastly, that the complainant does not want to contest the
bail petition and has got no objection over the release of
the accused-petition on bail.

3. The learned AAG on his turn resists such
contentions of the learned counsel for the accused-
petitioner on the ground that the accused-petitioner has
been directly charged by the complainant for the
commission of the offence and the medical report also

confirms the contents of the F.I.R.

4, Arguments heard and the available record
perused.
5. As per the FIR, it was the complainant who

reported about the incident as to how his minor son
namely Maaz, aged about 8 years was taken by the
accused-petitioner to a nearby garden and committed

unnatural offence with him and the delay occurred

Altaf Hussain, PS Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
because of the intervention of the elders of the locality
compelling him for compromise.
6. In the case in hand, it is the medical report
of the victim, which is of significance, wherein the doctor
has given the following details:-

“There are perineal bruise. Superficial
and mucosal tear at 12 O'clock
position in knee elbow position. Child
is aged about 7-8 years. Two swabs
taken and sent for analysis with clothes
of victim. In my opinion child is victim
of sodomy / rape.”

The same per se shows that the minor son of the
complainant, aged about 7/8 years has been subjected to
an unnatureal offence. As such, the mere non-availability
of the FSL report in the case is of a little consequence, at
the bail stage.

7. So far as the argument of the learned
counsel in respect of the age of the accused-petitioner is
concerned, I believe that juvenility by itself does not

confer a license upon a person to commit such heinous

Altaf Hussain, PS Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
offence. Of late, such offences have attained alarming
proportions and in such cases, the accused are mostly
found to be juveniles. As such, if the mere tender age of
the accused is taken into consideration for the grant of
bail in like manner cases, it would lead to a licentious
behaviour on the part of such individuals.

Since the offence is not compoundable,
therefore, the mere statement of the complainant to have
compromised the matter cannot be taken into account.
Thus taking a tentative assessment of the available
record, the accused-petitioner is prima facie connected
with the commission of the offence which is both serious
and heinous and also falls within the prohibitory clause
of Section 497 Cr.P.C. Accordingly, I hold him

disentitled to the concession of bail.

8. Resultantly, this bail petition stands
dismissed.
9. Needless to mention that the observations

recorded in this order are purely tentative in nature and
shall not prejudice the proceedings before the learned

Altaf Hussain, PS Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
trial court where the case be decided on its own merits

after recording evidence.
