ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- This criminal appeal has
been filed by Sohail Nasir, the appellant, against the
judgment dated 07.12.2017, passed by learned Sessions
Judge/Judge on Special Task, Peshawar, whereby the
appellant having been found guilty of committing murder
of Aman Ullah deceased has been convicted under section
302 (b) PPC and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for
life as well as to pay Rs.3,00,000/-, as compensation to
legal heirs of the deceased in terms of section 544-A
Cr.P.C., and in default thereof to undergo 06 months S.I.
He has been further convicted under section 201 PPC, and
sentenced to undergo imprisonment for three years and pay

a fine of Rs.30,000/- or in default of payment thereof to
undergo 06 months S.I. in case FIR No.1050 dated
30.09.2015, registered under sections 302/201/34 PPC, at
Police Station Agha Mir Jani Shah, Peshawar.

2. Mst. Hakima Bibi, mother of Aman Ullah
deceased, has filed connected Cr.R. No.03-P/2018,
seeking enhancement of sentence of convict/respondent
from life imprisonment to normal penalty of death, as
provided for the offence.

3. Since, both the matters arise out from one and the
same judgment of the learned trial Court dated 07.01.2017,
therefore, we propose to decide the same through this
single judgment.

4. As per contents of FIR, the prosecution case is that
on 30.09.2015 on receipt of information regarding a
beheaded dead body of an unknown person lying in the
vacant plot owned by Afridi Khan, situated in Dir Colony
Chowk Ring road, Peshawar, Mr. Ishaq Khan ASI (PW.9)
along with other police officials, reached the spot and saw
a dead body whose head had been cut with a sharp weapon
and taken away by some unknown culprit(s). Nobody
identified the dead body, therefore, PW.9 prepared injury
sheet and inquest reports Exh.PW.9/1 and Exh.PW.9/2,
respectively and dispatched the beheaded dead body to the
mortuary at KMC under the escort of Constable Said Azam
No.1582 (PW.1), for post mortem examination. He also

drafted Murasila and sent the same to Police Station on the
basis of which FIR Exh.PA was registered against
unknown culprit(s).

5. Shaukat S.I. (PW.5) was entrusted with the task of
investigation, who proceeded to the spot, summoned Ishaq
Khan ASI (PW.9) and on his pointation prepared site plan
Exh.PB. During spot inspection, he secured bloodstained
earth from the place where the dead body was lying/thrown
vide recovery memo Exh.PC. He also recovered
bloodstained earth at some distance from the aforesaid
place vide recovery memo Exh.PC/1l as well as from
outside gate of a godown vide recovery memo Exh.PC/2. A
30 bore crime empty was found inside the godown which
was recovered vide memo Exh.PC/3. Vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.1/1 he took into possession the last worn
bloodstained garments of the deceased. In the meantime,
the appellant was arrested by Sabz Ali Khan DSP, the then
SHO police Station Agha Mir Jani Shah (PW.11) at Shoba
Chowk vide arrest card Exh.PW.11/1, and on his pointation
the chopped head of the deceased was recovered from
grass in front of Lasani Kanta Ring road. He (PW.11) sent
the same to Khyber Medical College (KMC) for stitching it
with headless dead body already dispatched for Post
mortem examination. The appellant was then brought to
scrap godown by PW.11 where Shaukat SI (PW.5) and
Muhammad Ishaq ASI (PW.9) (author of Murasila) were

already present and had effected the recovery of
bloodstained earth and 30 bore crime empty. The appellant
allegedly pointed out the crime spot to PW.11 i.e. a room
in scarp’s godown (Kabar khana) and on his pointation, he
recovered a 30 bore pistol, without number along with
spare charger and bandolier containing 02 live rounds and
a dagger/Churri from a drawer of table Exh.P.5 to P.9 vide
recovery memo Exh.PW.9/3. The appellant was then
handed over to the Shaukat SI (PW.5)/Investigating Officer
at the spot. During interrogation the appellant disclosed
before the I.O. about his residential room, situated in
Usman hostel, opposite Government College Peshawar.
The I.0. took the appellant to the said hostel and on his
pointation recovered a mobile set allegedly owned by the
deceased vide recovery memo Exh.PC/4. On return to
Police Station, father of deceased Jalat Khan charged the
appellant in his statement under section 161 Cr.P.C.
followed by his statement under section 164 Cr.P.C. before
the Judicial Magistrate. The I.O, produced the appellant for
his physical remand before the learned Judicial Magistrate
and also obtained permission for his medical examination
vide application Exh.PC/11. The appellant was medically
examined by Dr. Muhammad Arshad Hussain. The I.O,
recorded statement of one Tariq who allegedly had handed
over keys of the aforesaid godown to one Sartaj uncle of
the appellant. The I.O. also draw snapshots of the places of

occurrence and the dead body of the deceased available on
file as Exh.PC/13 (11 photographs). He sent the
bloodstained earths, clothes of the deceased, and
bloodstained dagger/chorri, bloodstained grass and
bloodstained pieces of carpet, as well as the 30 bore pistol
and crime empty of the same bore to the FSL. On his
transfer, the Remaining investigation was carried out by
Humayoun Khan SI (PW.12), who placed on file PM
documents of the deceased, FSL report Exh PZ, qua the
bloodstained articles and Exh.PZ/1, about the crime pistol
and empty. During interrogation the appellant disclosed the
name of one Farhad to be his co-accused in the crime,
therefore, he initiated proceedings under sections 204 and
87 Cr.P.C. against him. On completion of investigation
challan was submitted against the appellant before the
learned trial court.

6. On receipt of challan by the learned trial Court, the
appellant was charge sheeted to which he pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial. To prove its case, the prosecution
examined as many as twelve witnesses. After closure of the
prosecution evidence, statement of the appellant was
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C. wherein he denied the
prosecution allegations and professed his innocence. He,
however, declined to be examined on oath under section
340 (2) Cr.P.C. or to produce evidence in defence. On

conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court, after hearing
both the sides convicted and sentenced the appellant, as
mentioned above.

7. We have heard the extensive arguments of learned
counsel for the parties and perused the record with their
valuable assistance.

8. It is manifest from record that it is a case of no
eyewitness. Though, Jalat Khan, father of Aman ullah
deceased has nominated the appellant for murder of his son
in his statement recorded under section 164 Cr.P.C. on
01.10.2015, but after the arrest of appellant on the ground
that as the appellant has been arrested by the police during
investigation, therefore, he is satisfied that the appellant
has committed murder of his son. He has not uttered a
single word about the motive behind the crime. In the
circumstances, the prosecution case is squarely based on
circumstantial evidence in the shape of recovery of
bloodstained earths secured from three places, mentioned
above and a 30 bore crime empty Exh.P.4 recovered from
inside Kabar godown by Muhammad Ishaq Khan ASI
(PW.9), (the author of Murasila) and recovery of head of
the deceased, a 30 bore crime pistol, bloodstained
dagger/churri, iron rod and a mobile set of the deceased, on
the pointation of the appellant by Sabaz Ali Khan DSP the
then SHO (PW.11), coupled with positive Serologist report
Exh.PZ qua the bloodstained articles and positive FSL

report Exh.PZ/1 about the crime pistol and crime empty.
The circumstantial evidence referred above, has been relied
upon by the prosecution and the learned trial Court while
believing it has recorded conviction of the appellant.

9. At the very outset it needs to be mentioned here
that undisputedly on 30.09.2015 or at night between 29"
and 30" September, someone committed brutal murder of
Aman Ullah alias Manay deceased, whose beheaded body
was found inside a vacant bounded plot owned by one
Afridi Khan, situated at Dir Colony Chowk, ring road
Peshawar, whereas, on the same day his head was
recovered lying in grass on berm of the road. There is
ample evidence on record which proves homicide of the
deceased through firearm on his head and _ thereafter
chopping of head from his dead body. The only point for
consideration is that whether it was the appellant who
committed homicide of the deceased.

10. What inclines the Court to believe the
circumstantial evidence is the maxim that men may lie but
circumstances do not. We do not nor can we doubt and
dispute the century’s old well tested wisdom rather we use
it as a touchstone for assessing and evaluating the
evidentiary worth of the circumstantial evidence.
Circumstantial evidence can form basis of conviction if it
is incompatible with the innocence of the accused and
incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable

hypothesis than that of his guilt. This case thus has to be
analyzed and adjudged on the touch stone of the above
principle.

11. As per FIR, the occurrence has taken place on
30.09.2015 at unknown time. The scriber of Murasila,
namely, Muhammad Ishaq ASI (PW.9) reached the spot
(the place where the dead body was lying/thrown), where
he drafted Murasila at 14.00 hours. Besides, he also
prepared injury sheet and inquest report of the deceased,
however, he has not shown recovery of blood etc from the
spot. If there was any blood and other incriminating
material he ought to have shown the same in column
No.12 and 13 of the inquest report of deceased. Shaukat
Khan SI (PW.5), the Investigating Officer deposed that
when he reached the spot i.e (the place where the dead
body of the deceased was thrown/lying), he summoned
Muhammad Ishaq ASI, the author of the Murasila (PW.9)
and in his presence secured bloodstained earth from the
place where the dead body was thrown/lying, blood stained
earth lying at some distance from the aforesaid place and
bloodstained earth from outside gate of godown as well as
a 30 bore crime empty from inside the godown. The
appellant has been shown arrested by Sabz Ali Khan DSP
(PW.11) on the same day of occurrence from Shoba
Chowk Peshawar, vide arrest card Exh.PW.11/1, wherein
the time and place of arrest of the appellant has not been

shown. In cross-examination (PW.11) admitted that he has
not mentioned the time and place of arrest of the appellant
in the arrest card. He deposed that on receipt of spy
information at 2.00 p.m. through an informer he along
with other police officials rushed to Shoba Chowk and
arrested the appellant at 05.00 pm. He further deposed that
name of appellant, his father name and residence were
disclosed to him by the informer, however, this PW has not
uttered a single word that at the time of arrest of the
appellant the alleged informer was accompanying
him/police party. The appellant was not already known to
PW.11, therefore, his arrest from overcrowded place,
namely, Shoba Chowk from amongst numerous persons,
present and roaming in the said bazaar in routine, is
nothing but a cook and bull story. As per prosecution case
the headless body of the deceased was recovered at 14.00
hours, by (PW.9), who there and then drafted Murasila,
while weirdly, the PW.11 (Sabz Ali Khan DSP) got
information at 14.00 hours about purposeless presence of
the appellant in Shoba square, who purportedly was
present upto 17.00 hours and got busted there. Needless to
mentioned that the appellant has not been showed arrested
from any hotel, building or shop etc. Record is silent about
any stains or dots of blood etc on the sleeves or clothes of
the appellant. For the sake of discussion if we presume that
the appellant might had changed his clothes in which he

allegedly committed the crime, then no such clothes has
10

been shown recovered on the pointation of the appellant,
through, the Investigation Officer has searched the room of
appellant in the hostel. The dramatic arrest of the appellant
from Shoba square,, who by then was the student of F.Sc
(Pre-engineering), settled in a room of hostel in front of
Government College Peshawar cast serious doubt on
prosecution case. During arguments learned counsel for the
appellant drew our attention to a newspaper “Daily Aaj”,
(placed on judicial file), wherein news along with a photo
has splashed, according to which the local police on
pointation of three accused discovered the head of
deceased Aman Ullah as well as pistol and dagger. In the
photographs, the appellant amongst three other persons has
been shown standing in handcuffs with the police. Who
were the other three persons and why they were released
has remained a mystery, however, in cross-examination
PW.11 has deposed that on the pointation of the appellant,
he recovered head of the deceased from the fields of Dir
Colony, situated on ring road in front of Lasani Kanta. The
place of recovery of head of the deceased is also situated in
congested area of Peshawar, but no private witness has
been associated with the alleged pointation proceedings,
while on the other hand, it negates the briefing report of
police high-ups to the media personnel being flashed in
“daily Aaj” wherein the head of the deceased has been

shown recovered on the disclosure of three persons
11

including the appellant. Owner of the plot, namely, Afridi
Khan has not been examined despite the fact that his house
is situated adjacent to Plot. Besides, in the photographs of
the place, wherefrom head of the deceased has been shown
recovered on the pointation of the appellant, one can see
only the appellant in handcuffs and grass but no head of
dead body is visible, hence, this piece of evidence is highly
doubtful.

12. As regards recovery of 30 bore pistol without
number along with spare charger and a_ bandolier
containing two live rounds and bloodstained Churri on the
pointation of the appellant from inside a small room of
godown, suffice it to say that Sabz Ali Khan DSP (PW.11),
who allegedly arrested the appellant deposed that on the
pointation of the appellant he effected the aforesaid
recoveries from drawer of table from a room inside
godown vide memo Exh.PW.9/3. In cross-examination he
deposed that after arrest of the appellant and recovery of
head on his pointation when he reached the crime
spot/godownnt, Shaukat SI (PW.5) and Muhammad Ishaq
Khan ASI (PW.9), the author of Murasila, were already
present and in their presence on the pointation of the
appellant he recovered the crime pistol along with
bandolier, dagger/Churri ete from drawer of table inside a
room in the godown. On the other hand, PW.5 deposed that

after registration of the case he proceeded to the spot and
12

summoned Ishaq Khan ASI (PW.9), and on whose
pointation prepared the site plan. In view of the statement
of PW.5, the Investigation Officer along with complainant
was present inside the premises of godown (place of
occurrence) and was busy in collecting evidence from the
spot but could not recover the alleged crime weapons from
a small room where only one table has been shown lying in
the photographs. Had the appellant not been arrested, the
Investigation Officer would have not recovered the crime
weapons. Likewise, PW Sabz Ali Khan has disclosed the
arrest of the appellant at 1700 hours in Shoba Bazaar,
situated at a considerable distance from place of
occurrence, who was immediately brought to the spot and
on his disclosure the weapons of offence were allegedly
recovered from the place where the Investigation Officer
along with complainant was already present and searching
the spot for the last three hours. The statement of Sabz Ali
Khan does not appeal to a prudent mind because if the
author of Murasila and the I.O. were already present inside
godown, they could have easily recovered the alleged
crime pistol, dagger, bandolier and iron rod etc. In this
view of the matter, recovery of the alleged crime weapons
on the pointation of the appellant being highly doubtful,
seems to have been planted against the appellant by the
police just to show their efficiency, hence, this piece of

circumstantial evidence has wrongly been believed by the
13

learned trial Court. No doubt, FSL report about the crime
weapons is in positive, however, not only its recovery is
highly doubtful, but the empty and pistol have been sent
together to the FSL on 05.10.2015 which were received in
the Laboratory on 08.10.2015. Whereabouts of the alleged
crime pistol and empty in the interregnum period has not
been explained by the prosecution. No independent witness
has been examined in support of the aforesaid recoveries.
Neither owner nor watchman of the godown has been
examined in support of the aforesaid recoveries or nexus of
the appellant with the godown. One Tariq who in his
statement under section 161 Cr.P.C. had stated about
handing over of key of godown to one Sartaj uncle of the
appellant has been abandoned as his whereabouts were
unknown. The aforesaid Sartaj has not been cited as an
accused in the case nor has been examined by the ILO. An
iota of evidence has not been brought on record by the
prosecution to prove the nexus of the appellant with the
aforesaid godown. The purpose of visit of deceased to a
bounded area has also remained a mystery. No relative of
the deceased has came forward to furnish evidence to the
effect that the deceased had friendship with the deceased or
that he used to visit the crime spot (godown). Similarly, an
iota of evidence has not been collected by the prosecution
to prove nexus of the appellant with the deceased or his

visit to the godown before the occurrence.
14

13. A mobile set of the deceased also has been shown
recovered on the pointation of the appellant from his room
in a hostel situated in front of Government Degree College,
Peshawar, but no identification parde of the said mobile
has been conducted through LRs of the deceased.
Similarly, an iota of evidence is not available on file to
prove the said mobile to be the ownership of the deceased.
14. For what has been discussed above, the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove the guilt of the
appellant through the circumstantial evidence. It is settled
by now that in such like cases every chain should be linked
with each other and it should form such a continuous chain
that its one end touches the dead body and other end should
touch the neck of the accused. But if chain is missing then
its benefit must go to the accused. In this regard, guidance
has been sought from the judgments of the Apex Court of
the country reported in "Ch. Barkat Ali vs. Major Karam
Elahi Zia and another" (1992 SCMR 1047), "Sarfraz
Khan vs. The State" (1996 SCMR 188) and "Asadullah
and another vs. State" (PLJ 1999 SC 1018).

15. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed. Conviction
and sentence of the appellant recorded by the learned trial
Court vide judgment dated is hereby set aside and he is
acquitted of the charge leveled against him. He be set at
liberty forthwith, if not confined in any other case. On

acquittal of the convict, connected Cr.R. No.03-P/2018,
15

titled, “Mst. Hakima Bibi Vs Sohail Nasir’ has become
infructuous, which is hereby dismissed.

16. These are the reasons of our short order of even
date which is reproduced below:-

“For reasons to be recorded later, we allow
this appeal, set-aside the conviction and
sentence of appellant Sohail Nasir son of
Nasir, recorded by the learned Sessions
Judge/Judge on Special Task, Peshawar
under section 302(b) and 201 PPC, in case
FIR No.1050 dated 30.09.2015, under
sections 302/201/34 PPC, Police Station
Agha Mir Jani Shah, Peshawar and hereby
acquit him of the charge in the cited case. He
be set at liberty forthwith, if not confined in
any other case”.
