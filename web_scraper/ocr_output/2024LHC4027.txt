filed by complainant Abdul Razzaq for enhancement of sentence
awarded to Muhammad Irfan @ Fani and Qamar Hussain @
Qamri, respondents, originating from the judgment dated
26.5.2017, passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge,
Dunyapur District Lodhran, arising out of case FIR No. 100/2013
dated 08.03.2013 registered under sections 302, 324, 337-A (ii), 337-
F(i), 427, 148 and 149 P.P.C. at Police Station Dunyapur District

and Abdul Islam alias Puno, proceeded to convict and sentence
Criminal Appeal No. 685-] of 2017, 2
Criminal Appeal No. 679-J of 2017, &
Criminal Revision No. 311 of 2017.

both the appellants in the following terms:-

1. Muhammad Irfan @ Fani (appellant in Criminal Appeal
No. 685-J of 2017.

Under Section 302 (b) read with Section 149 PPC to undergo
imprisonment for life as well as to pay Rs. 1,00,000/- as compensation
to the legal heirs of deceased Ayaz Shah as required under section
544-A, Cr.P.C. and in default whereof to further undergo six months
S.I.

Under Section 324 PPC to undergo imprisonment for five years
alongwith fine of Rs. 50,000/- and in case of non-payment of fine to
further undergo three months S.I.

2. Qamar Hussain alias Qamri (appellant in Criminal
Appeal No. 679-J of 2017.

Under Section 302 (b) read with Section 149 PPC to undergo
imprisonment for life as well as to pay Rs. 1,00,000/- as compensation
to the legal heirs of deceased Ayaz Shah as required under section
544-A, Cr.P.C. and in default whereof to further undergo six months
S.I.

All the sentences awarded to both the convicts Muhammad Irfan @
Fani and Qamar Hussain @ Qamri were directed to run concurrently.
Benefit of Section 382-B, Cr.P.C. was also extended to both of them.

2. Briefly the charge against the appellants is that on 8.3.2013 at
about 9.15 am. in the area of Chak No. 342/W.B. within the
precincts of Police Station City Dunyapur, the appellants namely,
Qamar Hussain alias Qamri and Muhammad Irfan alias Fani,
alongwith their co-accused, Muhammad Nouman alias Nomi,
Adnan Moba, Suleman, Zeeshan, Sikandar Wadali, Punno, Gulzar
and two unknown accused persons while armed with firearm
weapons had allegedly committed the murder of Ayaz Shah
(deceased) by causing firearm injuries on his person besides causing
injuries on the persons of Muhammad Nadeem and Akbar Shah
injured PWs in the backdrop of a motive according to which the
accused were belonging to a Qabza group. One day prior to the
occurrence, they had come to possess over the complainant’s plot
when an altercation took place between the accused and the sons of
the complainant. Due to the said grudge, the accused persons
committed the murder of Ayaz Shah and caused injuries on the

persons of Muhammad Nadeem and Akbar Shah.
Criminal Appeal No. 685-] of 2017, 3
Criminal Appeal No. 679-J of 2017, &
Criminal Revision No. 311 of 2017.

3, After usual investigation report under section 173, Cr.P.C. was
submitted in the Court. After codal formalities, under the relevant
provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, learned trial court
framed the charge against the appellants to which they pleaded not
guilty and claimed a trial. Thereafter, the prosecution in order to
prove the guilt of the appellants ventured to produce as many as
twenty one PWs in support of its case while the learned trial Court

examined 4 CWs in order to reach just conclusion of the trial.

4. In their statements recorded under section 342, C r.P.C., the
appellants had denied and controverted all the allegations of fact
levelled against them by the prosecution and they also professed
their innocence. However, they had not opted to make statements on
oath under section 340 (2), Cr.P.C., whereas, Qamar Hussain alias
Qamri appellant produced his defence evidence as Ex. DQ and
attested copy of judgment dated 3.4.2017 passed by learned
Additional Sessions Judge, Lodhran in case FIR No. 209/13, Police
Station City Dunyapur.

5) Upon conclusion of the trial, the learned trial court after
finding the prosecution’s case against the appellants to have been
proved beyond reasonable doubt while acquitting co-accused
namely Zeeshan and Abdul Islam alias Puno, proceeded to convict
and sentence both the appellants as mentioned and detailed above.

Hence, all these matters before this Court.
6. Arguments heard. Record perused.

7. It divulges from the record that the occurrence which formed
basis of the instant case took place on 08.03.2013 at about 9.15 a.m. in
a vicinity known as Chak No. 342/W.B. situated five miles towards
West from Police Station City Dunyapur District Lodhran. During
this incident, after receipt of firearm injuries, Muhammad Nadeem
(PW2) and Akbar Shah (PW3) got injured, whereas Ayaz Shah lost
his life. The accusation of committing the crime in question was

pointed towards nine nominated accused persons including both the
Criminal Appeal No. 685-] of 2017, 4
Criminal Appeal No. 679-J of 2017, &
Criminal Revision No. 311 of 2017.

appellants Qamar Hussain @ Qamri and Muhammad Irfan @ Fani
and two unknown accused persons. A bird’s eye view of the record
reveals that the detail of the occurrence was conveyed to police
through the complaint (Ex. PA) made by Abdul Razzaq complainant
(PW1) on 8.3.2013 at 9.45 am. at THQ Hospital Dunyapur which
was transcribed into FIR by Muzaffar Hussain, S.I. (PW21) on the
same day at 9.55 a.m. From above, apparently it follows that the
matter was promptly reported to the police. No doubt the prompt
reporting of the crime to the police provides strength to the case of
the prosecution as generally it excludes the possibility of fabrication
of facts and false implication of innocent persons. However, since
the menace of padding through the stoppage of station diary
(Rozenamcha) etc. has penetrated deep into police working, hence,
the Courts have to be vigilant while giving a finding regarding the
time of the registration of crime report. Reliance is placed upon “Ata

Muhammad and another vs. The State” (1995 SCMR 599), wherein,

the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has visualized the tendency
on the part of the police in showing that the FIR was got recorded

with promptitude. The relevant extract is reproduced as under:

“We know by our experience that time of recording of F.I.R. is not
always genuine. The police, after learning about the commission of the
crime keeps the space in the daily diary (Roznamcha) and a page in the
F.LR. Register blank for incorporating therein the gist of the
information, the factum of registration of the case and the detailed
report subsequently, in the light of preliminary investigation made by it.

Therefore, instead of blindly following the time of the report of the
matter to the police as mentioned in the first information report, the
Courts have to evaluate other attending circumstances as well in this

regard.

8. It is doubtful that the FIR was got registered with such
promptitude as claimed by the prosecution as the mode and manner
of registering the FIR at the time given in the FIR is negated by the
other facts and circumstances of the case which are evident from the

statements of the prosecution witnesses and the documents adduced
Criminal Appeal No. 685-] of 2017, 5
Criminal Appeal No. 679-J of 2017, &
Criminal Revision No. 311 of 2017.

during the trial in this regard. In the instant case the time qua
reporting the matter to the Investigating Officer (PW21) as
suggested in the complaint (Ex. PA) as well as in the bottom of FIR,
ie. 9.45 a.m. has been contradicted by Muzaffar Hussain, S.I.
(PW21), who during the cross-examination in this regard has

deposed as under:-

“I sent the written complaint for the registration of FIR at Police
Station at 9.15 a.m. I had prepared the injury statement of Ayaz Shah at
about 9.20 a.m. and inquest report was prepared by me at 9.30 a.m.

Apart from the above contradiction in the time of reporting the
matter, Muhammad Javaid 606/C, who had taken the application
(Ex. PA) to the Police Station for registration of case was not
produced in order to prove the factum of taking the complaint (Ex.
PA) at the time as has been mentioned in (Ex. PA) and at the bottom
of the FIR, thus, an adverse inference under illustration (g) to Article
129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 could easily be drawn that
in case he was produced he would not have supported the
prosecution version to this extent. Reliance is placed on
“Muhammad Rafique and others Vs. The State and others” (2010
SCMR 385), wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has

observed as under:-

“It is well-settled that if any party withholds the best piece of evidence
then it can fairly be presumed that the party had some sinister motive
behind it. The presumption under Article 129 (g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat
Order can fairly be drawn that if P.W. Amir Ali would have been
examined, his evidence would have been unfavourable to the
prosecution.”

Even otherwise, FIR was not exhibited in evidence during the trial,
and it is well settled law that document which has not been
exhibited, cannot be taken into consideration. Reliance is placed on
“Mazhar Iqbal vs. The State and another” (2022 MLD _ 752)
[Islamabad], & “Muhammad Asif and others vs. The State and
others” (2016 P.Cr.L.J. 1758). Hence, the FIR cannot be taken into

consideration as a corroborative piece of evidence to the ocular

account and the prosecution evidence has to be seen with utmost
Criminal Appeal No. 685-] of 2017, 6
Criminal Appeal No. 679-J of 2017, &
Criminal Revision No. 311 of 2017.

care and caution.

9. Another intriguing aspect of the matter is that although the
deceased had died at 9.50 a.m. and dead body of Muhammad Ayaz
deceased was received in the dead house at 10.30 a.m. but autopsy
on the dead body of the deceased was conducted with the delay of
about 03 hours and 25 minutes at 1.15 p.m. and the reason is
apparent from the report itself that the documents from the police
were received at 12.30 p.m. and such delay is generally suggestive of
a real possibility that time had been consumed by the police in
procuring and planting eye-witnesses and in cooking up a story for
the prosecution before preparing police papers necessary for getting
a post-mortem examination of the dead body conducted. The delay
in conducting post-mortem examination also indicates about the
non-availability of so-called eye-witnesses at the scene of occurrence
at the relevant time as has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court
of Pakistan in the cases of “Irshad Ahmed vs. The State” (2011
SCMR 1190) and “Nazeer Ahmed vs. The State” (2016 SCMRT 1628).

10. The medical evidence was furnished by Dr. Muhammad
Saeed, S.M.O. THQ Hospital, Dunyapur who on 8.3.2013 conducted
the postmortem examination on the dead body of Ayaz Shah

deceased and found the following injuries on his person:-

(i) A lacerated, circular wound 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm on front lateral aspect of

entry. On dissection, upper and of right humerous was fractured, track

Bullet ran out across the wound.

As per his opinion the death of the deceased had occurred due to
injury No. 3 which was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary
course of life and is ante-mortem in nature and was caused by

firearm. All other injuries were contributory to injury No. 3.

11. As per prosecution allegation, Qamar Hussain @ Qamri
appellant made two fire shots on the person of Ayaz Shah deceased.
The first fire shot made by him had hit on the left side of chest of
Ayaz Shah deceased while the second fire shot made by him with
his pistol 30-bore had hit on the left shoulder of deceased. As per
injuries noted by Dr. Muhammad Saeed (PW11), injuries No. 1,2 and
3 were attributed to appellant Qamar Hussain @ Qamri. Injury No. 1
on the dead body of Ayaz Shah deceased was on front lateral aspect
of left shoulder joint, red in colour while injury No. 2 was on left
side of neck of the deceased. Likewise, injury No. 3 in front of left
chest of the deceased was an entry wound of firearm whereas injury

No. 2 was an exit wound. Similarly, Muhammad Irfan @ Fani
Criminal Appeal No. 685-] of 2017, 8
Criminal Appeal No. 679-J of 2017, &
Criminal Revision No. 311 of 2017.

appellant was alleged fire shots on the person of deceased Ayaz
Shah as well as on the person of injured Nadeem Shah. Injury No. 5
on the person of the deceased has been attributed to him while
injury No. 1 as embodied in MLC (Ex. PP) on the person of injured
Nadeem Shah was also attributed to him.

12. In the backdrop of causing of above said injuries, it has been
observed that although Qamar Hussain alias Qamri appellant was
attributed injuries No. 1, 2 and 3 and according to the doctor who
during the cross-examination has categorically admitted as correct
that injury No. 1 cannot be caused from the front side of the
deceased and the same was caused from the angular side, whereas,
injuries No. 3, 4, & 5 were caused from the front side nor from the
angular side. All the injuries were sustained by the deceased from
the same distance. Even otherwise, Dr. Muhammad Saeed, (PW11)
could not describe the direction of injury No. 5, as to whether it was
from upward to downward, front to back or back to front or right to
left or left to right. Even otherwise, on the clothes of the deceased
burning was found by the doctor which is caused from the range
upto six inches. Similarly, injury No. 1 on the person of Muhammad
Nadeem Shah was an angular, whereas, the injury No. 5, on the
person of Ayaz Shah deceased was caused from front side and
burning was found on the clothes of Nadeem Shah deceased.
According to site plan (Ex. PM) point No. 1 is the place where the
deceased was fired at and points No. 4 & 5 are the places from
where the appellant Qamar Hussain alias Qamri made firing at
Ayaz Shah deceased. Similarly, point No. 7 is the place from where
Muhammad Irfan @ Fani made firing at the deceased Ayaz Shah.
But surprisingly, the inter se distance between the said places has
not been mentioned in the site plan (Ex. PM). Thus, it can safely be
inferred that the fire was not made from the long distance and the
same was made from the close range. The inference so drawn is

substantiated by the medical jurisprudence, according to which the
Criminal Appeal No. 685-] of 2017, 9
Criminal Appeal No. 679-J of 2017, &
Criminal Revision No. 311 of 2017.

blackening occurs when a shot is fired from a distance of 6 to 12
inches and vanishes if the distance is more than three feet. In
support of such opinion, reference can be made to “A Text Book of
Forensic Medicine and Toxicology” authored by Dr. S. Siddiq

Hussain, wherein he opined as under:-

“(2) Discharge at 6-12”. Effect of hot gases is lost. So there is no tearing
of skin, wound is round and of the size of bullet, edges, inverted and
surrounded by a zone of varying blackening and tattooing, there little
burning only a grease ring due to oil and graphite is likely to be found.
Clothing my show blast damage.

(3) At 2-3 feet. No burning and tattooing becomes more discreet.

(4) Beyond 3 feet. No blackening, burning or tattooing.”

Even “Jaising P. Modi in his book Medical Jurisprudence and
Toxicology 24th Edition” is found to be in consensus with above-
mentioned view of Dr. S. Siddique Hussain. Last but not the least,
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has also expressed almost
similar view in the case of “Amin Ali and another v. The State”

(2011 SCMR 323.).

13. Muzaffar Hussain, S.J. (PW21) has deposed during his
examination-in-chief that on receiving the information of the
occurrence he reached at THQ Hospital Dunyapur where he handed
over the dead body of Ayaz Shah deceased to Manzoor Ahmad No.
364/C for autopsy. Regarding the preparation of injury statement
and inquest Report of Ayaz Shah, Muzaffar Hussain, S.I. (PW21)

during the cross-examination has stated as under:-

“xxxxx I had prepared the injury statement of Ayaz Shah at about 09.20
a.m. and inquest report was prepared by me at 09.30 a.m.”

On the other hand, during the cross-examination Manzoor Ahmad
No. 364/C while appearing in the witness box as (PW19) has taken a
different stance and he has unequivocally stated that the dead body
of the deceased was handed over to him at Chak No. 342/WB at
about 08.30/09.00 a.m. and he had taken the dead body of the
deceased from Chak No. 342/WB to Hospital on official vehicle.

Likewise, in column No. 3 of the Inquest Report (Ex. PM), the time
Criminal Appeal No. 685-] of 2017, 10
Criminal Appeal No. 679-J of 2017, &
Criminal Revision No. 311 of 2017.

of occurrence known to the police has been mentioned as 9.50 a.m.
on 8.3.2013. Thus, the prosecution witnesses have been found in
contradiction qua the place of handing over and escorting the dead

body of the deceased.

14. No effort was made by the complainant to inform the police in
spite of the fact that place of occurrence was at a distance of five
miles towards West from Police Station City Dunyapur as per
column No. 4 of the FIR. Even otherwise, the complaint (Ex. PA)
about the alleged incident had been lodged at THQ Hospital
Dunyapur, whereat the local police had arrived on its own after
having statedly been informed of the occurrence by someone else
whose name was neither disclosed nor was he produced before the
learned trial Court. During the cross-examination Abdul Razzaq
complainant (PW1) stated that 60/70 fire shots were made by the
accused at the time of occurrence. But surprisingly, no injury was
received by the complainant during the whole occurrence despite
his acclaimed presence. Furthermore, during the spot inspection
only seven empties were recovered from the spot by Muzaffar
Hussain, S.J. (PW21) which also contradicts the stance taken by the
complainant qua the making of indiscriminate firing. Similarly, in
the inquest report (Ex. PM) in the relevant column No. 23 it has not
been shown that any empty was found at the spot near the dead
body of the deceased. It is also noticeable that despite their claimed
presence at the scene of the crime at the relevant time the conduct of
the said eyewitnesses was found irrational as they had not tried to
save the life of the deceased who was seriously injured and
according to Dr. Muhammad Saeed, S.M.O. THQ Hospital
Dunyapur (PW11), the probable time that elapsed between injury
and death was within half an hour. Had the eyewitnesses been
present there they would have taken the deceased injured condition
to any near hospital for providing him medical treatment to save his

life. It has also been noticed that in column No. 8 of the inquest
Criminal Appeal No. 685-] of 2017, 11
Criminal Appeal No. 679-J of 2017, &
Criminal Revision No. 311 of 2017.

report (Ex. PM), the eyes of the deceased were found open, thus, if
the eye-witnesses were actually present then, at least after the death
as is a consistent practice of such close relatives, they would have
closed eyes of the deceased on his expiry. This fact by itself indicates
that none was present with the deceased till his death, otherwise,
why the eyes of the deceased remained open and were not set right

by any one of them. Reliance is placed on “Muhammad Asif Vs. The

State” (2017 SCMR 486). In view of above, ocular account furnished
by the prosecution is neither confidence inspiring nor truthful,

hence, is hereby discarded.

15. Insofar as the alleged recovery of pistols 30 bore (P.14) &
(P.15) at the instance of Qamar Hussain @ Qamri and Muhammad
Irfan @ Fani, respectively is concerned, the same is inconsequential
for the simple reason that as per reports of PFSA (Ex. PW) and (Ex.
PY), the empties did not match with the pistols as such the recovery
of pistols on the pointing out of the appellants has been rightly

disbelieved by the learned trial court.

16. So far as the motive is concerned, according to the prosecution
the accused were belonging to a Qabza group. One day prior to the
occurrence, they had come to possess over the complainant's plot
when an altercation took place between the accused and the
complainant's sons. Due to the said grudge, the accused persons
committed the murder of Ayaz Shah and caused injuries on the
persons of Nadeem Shah and Akbar Shah. PW-1 Abdul Razzaq
complainant during the course of investigation has categorically
stated that the plot whereupon the accused were intending to
possess over was in the ownership of his son Ejaz Shah, whereas,
Muhammad Nadeem, (PW2) deposed during the cross-examination
that he did not know the number of plot whereupon the accused
persons had come to possess and the said plot is in the name of his
father. Akbar Shah (PW3) on this point has stated that he does not

know who was allotted the plot whereupon the accused had come to
Criminal Appeal No. 685-] of 2017, 12
Criminal Appeal No. 679-J of 2017, &
Criminal Revision No. 311 of 2017.

possess over. Motive in this case is jointly attributed to all the
accused persons and not specifically to the appellants to be
considered against them as piece of evidence. Admittedly, on the
same set of evidence the learned trial court has already acquitted the
co-accused, so the same set of evidence cannot be believed to the
extent of the appellants. Even otherwise, the matter of quarrel was
not reported to the police. Neither any panchayat was convened to
resolve the issue. In such circumstances, the motive part of the
occurrence, being words of mouth, could not get corroboration from
any other independent source of the evidence, which remains

unproved and a shrouded mystery as well.

17. Furthermore, disappearance of a person named as a
murderer/culprit after the occurrence, is but natural, whether
named rightly or wrongly. Abscondence per se is not a proof of the
guilt of an accused person. It may, however, create suspicions
against him but suspicions after all are suspicions. The fact that the
appellants absconded and were not traceable for considerably long
period of time could also not be made sole basis for their conviction
when the other evidence of the prosecution is doubtful as it is
riddled with contradictions. Reliance is placed on “Muhammad

Sadig Vs. The State” (2017 SCMR 144). Even otherwise, the warrants

of arrest, proclamation and reports of the process server thereon
were not put to them in their statement recorded under section 342,
Code of Criminal Procedure, therefore, the evidence of abscondance
cannot give any support to the prosecution case. Reliance is placed

on “Zafar alias The State and others” (2018 SCMR 326).

18. In the light of what has been discussed above, Criminal
Appeals Nos. 685-J/2017 and 679-J/2017 filed by Muhammad Irfan
@ Fani and Qamar Hussain @ Qamri, respectively are allowed and
they are acquitted of the charge while giving them benefit of doubt

and in consequence whereof, set aside their conviction and sentence.
