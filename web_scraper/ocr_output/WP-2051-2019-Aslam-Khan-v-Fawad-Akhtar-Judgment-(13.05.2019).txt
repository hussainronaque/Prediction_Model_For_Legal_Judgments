QOAISER RASHID KHAN, J:-. The petitioner-
tenant has called in question the judgment and order
dated 20.03.2019 of the learned appellate court (ADJ-
XV), Peshawar whereby his appeal was dismissed and
the judgment and order dated 25.09.2018 of the learned
Rent Controller-I], Peshawar whereby the eviction
petition of the respondent-landlord has been allowed on

the ground of expiry of the rent agreement was upheld.

2. The epitome of the petition is that the
respondent-landlord filed a petition against the
petitioner-tenant for his eviction from shop No. 1,
Fawad Market Gulshan Bazar, Illaqa Gari Khana,
Peshawar City mainly on the ground that although the

rent agreement was for one year with effect from
01.08.2011 to 31.07.2012 for a monthly rent of Rs.
4400/- but the latter is not ready to execute fresh rent
deed and has continued paying rent at the rate of
Rs.6500/- per month till January, 2016 and thereafter

defaulted in payment of rent.

3. On being put to notice, the  respondent-
tenant appeared before the learned trial court and
contested the petition by filing his written reply wherein
he denied the claim of the petitioner-landlord and in
view of the divergent pleadings of the parties, the
learned Rent Controller, Peshawar framed as many as

three issues including the relief.

4. Both the parties produced their respective
evidence and after hearing the learned counsel for the
parties, the learned Rent Controller-II, Peshawar vide
judgment and order dated 25.09.2018 allowed the
petition on the ground of expiry of rent agreement and
directed the petitioner-tenant to vacate the demised
premises within a month. The said judgment and order
was in turn assailed before the learned appellate court in
appeal where too, the petitioner could not succeed and
his appeal was dismissed by the learned ADJ-XV,
Peshawar vide judgment and order dated 20.03.2019

and hence the present petition.
5. The learned counsel for the petitioner
contends that the petitioner is regularly paying the rent
and willing to execute fresh rent agreement and that the
original rent agreement remained in the field with the
consent of both the parties. He further contends that the
petitioner has deposited the entire rent amount and has

never defaulted in payment of rent.

The learned counsel for the respondent-
landlord opposes such contentions of the learned
counsel for the petitioner-tenant and defends the
impugned judgments and orders of both the learned

courts below on almost the same grounds as detailed

therein.
6. Arguments heard and the available record
perused.
7. The relationship of tenant and landlord is

not denied by the petitioner-tenant and the latter has
been occupying the demised premises on the strength of
an agreement (Ex.PW-1/4). The said agreement was for
one year commencing from 01.08.2011 to 31.07.2012
and thereafter as per own stance of the respondent-
landlord, the petitioner-tenant used to pay monthly rent
at the enhanced rate of Rs. 6500/-till January, 2016. The
same for all purposes shows that the petitioner-tenant

after the expiry of rent agreement had continuously paid
the monthly rent without any objection from the
respondent-landlord and thus, that the latter was
impliedly satisfied from the rent so paid to him. In these
circumstances, the doctrine of “acceptance by silence”
would certainly appear to be applicable in case in hand
as the respondent-landlord accepted the increase in rent
by his silence and continued performance of the rent
agreement. Reliance placed on PLD 1975 Supreme

Court 193.

8. It was on 21.10.2017, when the respondent-
landlord instituted an eviction petition on the grounds of
expiry of rent agreement, default in the payment of rent
with effect from February 2016 as well as the recovery
of arrears. However, he has not produced any
convincing and confidence inspiring evidence to
substantiate that in fact the petitioner-tenant has
defaulted in the payment of rent. The respondent-
landlord had for all intents and purposes accepted the
increased rent from the petitioner-tenant for almost 4
long years and as such could not retract from such
position. In view of the implied and tacit approval of the
respondent-landlord to accept the increased rent from
the petitioner-tenant for a period of about four years and
that too, in the absence of any written rent deed confers
the status of a statutory tenant upon the petitioner-tenant

during the intervening period. Accordingly, it does not
lie in the mouth of the respondent-landlord to term the
stay of the petitioner-tenant in the rented premises to be
without any statutory backing. Reliance placed on 2011

CLC 1498.

9. For the foregoing reasons, this court is of
the view that both the learned courts below have not
properly appreciated the material available on the record
and the respective evidence of the parties while passing
the impugned judgments and orders and are thus not

sustainable in the eye of law.

10. Accordingly, this petition is admitted and
allowed, the impugned findings of both the learned
courts below are set aside and resultantly the eviction
petition of the respondent-landlord stands dismissed
with no order as to costs.

Announced.
