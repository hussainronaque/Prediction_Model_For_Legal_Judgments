(Judicial Department)
W.P No.351-B of 2019.
Gul Sher Abat Khan
Vs
Mumtaz Ali Khan & others.
JUDGMENT
Date of hearing 22.4.2019

Appellant-Petitioner: By Mr. Sawal Nazir Khan, Advocate.

Respondent(s):

MUHAMMAD NASIR MAHFOOZ, J.--- The petitioner through
instant writ petition has invoked the constitutional jurisdiction of

this Court, praying that:-

“i) To set aside the impugned judgment,
order and decree dated 08.03.2019, passed by
learned Additional District Judge-IT, Bannu,
in rent appeal No.01/Nim of 2019, to the
extent of the petitioner; and to upheld and
maintain the judgment, order and decree
dated 02.9.2010, passed by learned Civil
Judge-VIH/Rent Controller, Bannu

ii) As well as to set aside the impugned
order dated 08.3.2019, to the extent of
rejecting the application of the petitioner, to
make registry Wasiqa No.189 and 190, dated
28.02.2019, as part and parcel of record.”
2. Brief facts of the case are that respondents Mumtaz Ali
Khan and 02 others have filed ejectment petition against the
petitioner and proforma respondent No.2 under section 13 of the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rent Restriction Ordinance, 1959 for the
eviction of the respondents from the shop bearing survey No.121/6
situated at Chowk Bazar Bannu and for the recovery of rent since
November, 2001 till April 2004 @ of Rs.7000/- per month. The
respondents have claimed that respondent No.1 has committed
default in payment of monthly rent and they require the suit shop

for their personal need.

3. This case was twice remanded by this Court firstly on
24.7.2017 and secondly on 10.01.2019, when the judgment of
learned appellate Court was set aside for non-compliance of Order
41 Rule 31 CPC and the case was remanded back to it for decision
afresh. Thereafter, the learned appellate Court in compliance of
above order of this Court, accepted the appeal with direction to
petitioner to vacate the premises within the span of 03 months and
also to make payment from November, 2011 till date of eviction @
Rs.4000/- per month with annual increase of 10%. Hence, the

instant writ petition.

4. I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the

parties and perused the record.
5. Landlords/' respondents instituted ejectment

petition on 20.4.2004 under section 13 of the Khyber

Pakhtunkhwa Rent Restriction Ordinance, 1959, on the ground

of default in rent and personal use. It is immaterial for decision

of ejectment petition to refer to dispute of any ownership and

once relationship of landlord and tenant exits, rent controller

can proceed with the trial. Learned counsel for petitioner, inter

alia, stressed that petitioner has purchased part of suit property

on the basis of registered deed No.190 dated 28.02.2019 which

is in fact a withdrawal of any encumbrance relating to some

part of suit property in possession of petitioner/tenant. In para

No.4 of his written statement petitioner/tenant has asserted his

possession as mortgagee for an amount of Rs.782000/- from

respondent No.2 in panel of proforma respondents. No other

ground is urged therein.

6. Learned counsel for the petitioner was asked to

show any receipt of rent last deposited by petitioner, he could

not refer to any receipt but admitted that he has denied

relationship of landlord and tenant. Twice the subject matter of

this case reached this Court, first in Writ Petition No.93-B of
2011 decided on 24.7.2017 when the order of remand passed

by learned appellate Court was set aside and remanded to him

to decide the same himself. Second time in Writ Petition

No.998-B of 2017 decided on 10.01.2019 when the judgment

of learned appellate Court was set aside for non-compliance of

Order 41 rule 31 CPC, hence the impugned order was passed

now assailed in the instant writ petition. The proceedings of

ejectment petition has kept the respondents at loggerheads

from the last fifteen years on trivial grounds, and

notwithstanding, the ground for personal need, petitioner has

never cared to deposit monthly rent at any stage, whatsoever.

7. Under section 13(6) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa

Rent Restriction Ordinance, 1959, after receiving written reply

rent controller shall pass an order for deposit of tentative rent

by the tenant but if the tenant makes default in the compliance

of such order his defence shall be struck off and the landlord

shall be put into possession without further proceedings. No

record relating to such order for deposit of rent has been

annexed with the instant writ petition, perhaps, to avoid any

consequences. Respondent No.1 appeared as RW-4 as special
attorney and admitted in examination-in-chief that respondent

No.1/landlord offered him to have the suit shop on tenancy of

Rs. 5 lac security so he paid Rs. 60,000/- to proforma

respondent. In cross-examination he deposed to the effect of

payment of rent through receipt Ex.RW4/l and one

Muhammad Anwar Khan stood as surety in between the

parties. From all the assertions made in his statement, a

conclusion can be easily drawn that relationship of landlord

and tenant exists between the parties and petitioner has

dragged the respondents/landlords in unnecessary litigation on

the oral pretext of being co-sharer.

8. It also requires to be mentioned that the case of

petitioner falls within the purview of Article 115 of Qanun-e-

Shahadat Order that estops a tenant from denying title of a

landlord once he enters into possession as such.

9. Learned counsel for the petitioner wanted to take

utmost benefit of judgment reported as PLD-2009-SC-71 but

this case has got distinguishing features. Petitioner has availed

complete opportunity of defence and exhausted all the

available remedies to keep the matter lingering on. Upshot of
my above findings are that, the instant writ petition is
dismissed in LIMINE.

Announced.
