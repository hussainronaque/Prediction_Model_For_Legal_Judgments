ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:-Petitioner Hashmat, seeks
post arrest bail in case FIR No.1055 dated 02.10.2017,
registered under sections 302/148/149/427 PPC, at Police
Station Pushtakhara.

2. According to FIR/report of complainant Haji Toor
Khan on the fateful day he along with his brother Gohar
Ali and nephew Muhammad Shoaib went to Bara road on a
motorbike bearing registration No.9394-Peshawar KPK for
the purpose of purchasing grocery. He and his nephew
were busing in purchasing articles whereas Gohar Ali was
waiting on the motorbike, when in the meantime, accused
Farman Ali, Rehman Ali, Fareed Ullah, Khalid Khan,
Sahib Ullah, Zeeshan along with Hashmat petitioner came

on motorcycles and opened fire at Gohar Ali, as a result, he
got hit and died at the spot. In addition to complainant the
occurrence is stated to have been witnessed by PW
Muhammad Shoaib and people present at the spot, hence,
this case.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record perused.

4. It appears from the FIR that petitioner along with
co-accused is directly charged with specific role of firing at
the deceased in a promptly lodged report by the
complainant, eliminating the possibility of consultation and
deliberation in making report. Being a broad day light
occurrence and parties well known to each other prior to
the occurrence, question of mistaken identity also does not
arise. Version of complainant is substantiated by
eyewitness Muhammad Shoaib in his statement recorded
under section 161 Cr.P.C. Recovery of blood from the spot
from the place of the deceased, his last wrong bloodstained
garments coupled with positive Serologist report in respect
thereof also corroborates the prosecution versions.
Similarly, recovery of 17 crime empties of 30 bore and 4
crime empties of 09 MM bore from the places attributed to
the accused in the site plan, which according to the FSL
report have been fired from different weapons coupled with
multiple firearm injuries sustained by the deceased
resulting into his unnatural death as well as noticeable

abscondence of the petitioner for more than two years
further corroborate the ocular version of the prosecution.
No doubt, co-accused Farman Ali and Shahid Ullah, after
facing trial have been acquitted by the trial Court vide
judgment dated 11.09.2020, however, according to learned
counsel for the complainant, the complainant has filed
appeal against their acquittal before this court in which
notice has been issued to the acquitted co-accused. Even
otherwise, acquittal of co-accused alone cannot be made a
ground for release of petitioner on bail as evidence which
is to be led against the petitioner is to be appreciated and
looked into independently. On tentative assessment of the
material on record, reasonable grounds exist which prima
facie connects the petitioner with the commission of
offence which entails capital punishment and falls within
the Prohibitory Clause of section 497 Cr.P.C., hence, I am
not inclined to exercise the discretion of bail in favour of

the petitioner.

5. Accordingly, this petition being meritless is hereby
dismissed.
