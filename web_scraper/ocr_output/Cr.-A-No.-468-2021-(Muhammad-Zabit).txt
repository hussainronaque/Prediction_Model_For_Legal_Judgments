MUSARRAT HILALL, J- This criminal appeal is directed
against the judgment dated 03.03.3021 of the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-VI / Child Protection Court,
Kohat, passed in case FIR No. 144 dated 03.02.2020
under Section 9-C CNSA 3/4 P.O, registered at Police
Station, Cantt. Kohat, whereby the appellant has been
convicted and sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment
for four years with fine of Rs.60,000/- or in default
whereof to suffer further imprisonment for three months

S.1 with benefit u/s 382-B Cr. P.C.
2. Allegations against the accused-appellant
are that on 03.02.2020 at 16.00 hours near Chakarkot
Graveyard, the local police of police station Cantt. Kohat
recovered a blue plastic shopper containing 360 grams
chars from side pocket of appellant. Accordingly, he was

arrested and the ibid case FIR was registered.

3. The learned trial Court, on the basis of plead
guilty by the appellant, convicted and sentenced him, as

referred to above. Hence, the instant appeal.

Arguments heard and record perused.

4. Under Section 412 Cr.P.C, when an accused
person has pleaded guilty and has been convicted, there
shall be no appeal except as to the extent and legality of
the sentence. In the instant case, as per the contents of the
FIR, 360 grams chars was allegedly recovered from the
possession of the accused-appellant. The accused-
appellant was arrested, whereafter on 14.02.2020, he was
allowed bail by the learned Additional Sessions Judge,

Kohat. On 03.03.2020, the accused-appellant submitted
(1

an application before the learned trial Court wherein by
waiving the right of trial and right of appeal, he pleaded
guilty and left himself at the mercy of the learned Court.
On the same day, charge was framed and on his own
plea, the accused was convicted and sentenced to
rigorous imprisonment for four years with fine of
Rs.60,000/- and in-default of payment of fine he was to
suffer three months imprisonment. The accused-appellant
has challenged his sentence on the ground that he
submitted the application expecting the Court to award
him the lesser possible sentence, however, to his utter
surprise and shock, the sentence awarded was harsh and

vulnerable.

5. The procedure in cases where the accused
“plead guilty” is different from the procedure adopted in
the cases where the accused “plead not guilty”. \n cases
where the accused pleads guilty, no further proceedings
in respect of the offence is conducted and after looking

into the nature of the offence by taking a lenient view the
minimum sentence (if prescribed by the Statute) is

awarded.

6. In cases where the Court intends to award
maximum punishment, the accused shall be forewarned
about the implication of the charge and the effect of
plead guilty. The Court shall disclose its mind to the
accused that even if he pleads guilty, the Court is not
going to take lenient view and if the accused still stands
by his position then the Court shall decide the case
according to the nature of the charge. In the instant case,
the accused was not found guilty rather he pleaded guilty
only to come out from the rigors of the prolong trial.
Looking into the merits of the instant case, it appears that
if the accused had not pleaded guilty and claimed trial, he
would have been acquitted. On perusal of the entire
record of the instant case, it is found that there is nothing
on the record showing that the learned Court before
awarding the impugned sentence, satisfied itself that the

plea of guilt was made by the accused after the charge
had fully been explained to him and that the accused
understood the charge and its implication and that the

same was voluntary.

As has been mentioned in the preceding para that
there is a bar of appeal under Section 412 Cr.P.C on the
matters decided on plead guilty, therefore, without
touching the conviction, it is held that the sentence
awarded to the accused-appellant is harsh, thus the same
is modified in terms that the sentence of four years is
reduced to the period which he has already spent in

custody. The fine imposed upon him is also set aside.
