WAQAR AHMAD SETH, CJ: - Accused-petitioner,
Asif son of Fazal Subhan, charged in case vide FIR No.428
dated 11.05.2020, under section 9-D CNSA, registered at
Police Station, Urmar, Peshawar, has approached this Court
for release on bail, on the ground of non completion of trial.

2. Since on merits, bail plea of the petitioner has been
declined by this Court via Cr. M BA No. 1509-P/2020,
therefore, neither facts nor discussion thereon is warranted.

3. I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner,
learned Addl. AG for the State and available record gone

pf through.

SCANNED
4. This Court in earlier round of litigation while
refusing the petition had directed to prosecution to submit
complete challan within seven days before the trial, whereas
today learned counsel for the petitioner is seeking bail that
despite direction and laps of sufficient time, challan has not
been submitted before the competent Court of law. On the
previous date, learned Addl. AG was directed to call learned
Public Prosecutor, Peshawar, who later on appeared and
informed the Court qua receipt of challan, today.
Subsequently Moharrir Investigation of the Police Station
concerned also appeared and produced Dak Bhai by stating
that vide receipt No. 377/21 dated 25.6.2020, they have
given the challan to the reader of Deputy Public Prosecutor,
Peshawar. Today one Mr. Rafi Ullah, Senior Public
Prosecutor, Peshawar, appeared before the Court and
produce receipt register, which suggests that challan was

Â£ received in the office of Public Prosecutor on 20.7.2020 and

on 21.7.2020, it was submitted before the Court, whereas the
Dak Bhai, quoted above, suggests otherwise.

5. This is a fit case for digging out the actual culprits,
but the ultimate sufferer would be the petitioner, as in the
proceedings record of the case will have to be requisitioned /
asked for conducting proceedings, hence, without going into
inquiry proceedings, the SSP investigation is directed to
strictly comply the law regarding submission challan before
the Court, in future. Each and every case / complete challan,
signed by the SHO within 24 hours, shall be forwarded to
the next hierarchy in order, and would not be delayed at any
pretext on one table beyond 24 hours, so as to avoid late
submission of challan. Office is directed to circulate copy of
the order amongst concemed for compliance.

6. The bail petition being meritless is hereby
dismissed, with the direction to the learned trial Court to

decide it as per National Judicial Police.
