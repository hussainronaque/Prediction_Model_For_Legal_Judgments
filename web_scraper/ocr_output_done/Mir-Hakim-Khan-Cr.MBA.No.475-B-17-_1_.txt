JUDGMENT

Date of hearing: 15.02.2018.
Appellant-petitioner _ By Pir Liaqat Ali Shah Advocate.
Respondent : State by Shahid Hameed Qureshi, Addl: AG.

Other By Faroog Khan Sokari Advocate.

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.-_ Through this single judgment I
intend to decide the instant Cr. MBA.No.475-B/2017 and
Cr.MBA.No.24-B/2018, as both the petitions have not
only sprung out of one and the same FIR, but common
question of law and facts are also involved therein.

2. Petitioners Mir Hakeem son of Muzaffar
Khan, Hazratullah son of Mir Hakeem Khan and Mir
Ghafoor son of Muzaffar, who are detained in crime
No.116 dated 23.9.2009 registered under Sections 302/
324/427/34 PPC at Police Station Mirian, applied for post
arrest bail in the Court of the learned Additional Sessions

Judge-IV, Bannu, mainly on the ground of statutory

delay, but their prayer was declined by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Bannu vide separate
orders dated 14.11.2017 and as per his opinion their case
is not covered under 3™ proviso of sub-section (1) of
Section 497 Cr.PC.

3. The allegations as set forth in the crime report
are that on 23.9.2009 at 1035 a.m. complainant Gulap
Khan, brought the dead body of his brother Irfanullah to
Police Station Mirian, Bannu and made a report that on
the eventful day, he, his brother Irfanullah and Tahir
Khan were proceeding towards Bannu City in a motorcar
bearing registration No.53/GAC, which was being driven
by Zaheerullah, when they reached near the home of one
Muhammad Khan, accused Mir Ghafoor Khan, Mir
Hakeem Khan sons of Muzaffar Khan, Mir Moliyaz son
Mir Ghafoor Khan and Hazratullah son of Mir Hakeem
Khan duly armed with Kalashnikovs were already
present there. On seeing the complainant party, the
accused started firing at them, as a result of which,
brother of the complainant Irfanullah, Tahir Khan and
Zaheerullah, driver of the vehicle, were hit. Irfanullah
succumbed to his injuries in the motorcar, while injured
Tahir and Zaheer were shifted to hospital. Later on

Zaheerullah also embraced death. Motive as alleged in

Imran/* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
-3-

the FIR is previous blood feud enmity between the
parties. Resultantly, the accused were booked in the FIR.
4. It is, inter alia, argued by the learned counsel
for the petitioners that accused Hazratullah and Mir
Hakeem were arrested on 28.10.2009, whereafter, they
were put to trial and finally, convicted and sentenced to
imprisonment for life on two counts vide judgment dated
20.4.2011, passed by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-II, Bannu; that accused Mir Ghafoor was arrested
on 11.11.2014, he was also convicted and sentenced to
life imprisonment vide judgment dated 11.5.2016 by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-IIIJ, Bannu
whereagainst, they filed appeal; that vide judgment dated
09.10.2017, the Honourable High Court accepted the
appeal filed by the petitioners and set aside the impugned
judgments of the learned trial Courts and remanded back
the case for denovo trial; that on 15.4.2012, the
miscreants launched attacked on Central Jail Bannu,
broke it, forcibly took away all the prisoners including
Hazratullah, Mir Hakeem and Moliyaz, they were kept in
private captivity, Moliyaz was murdered on 26.12.2015;
that again accused Mir Hakeem and Hazratullah were
arrested on 06.8.2015 and 25.12.2015, respectively, and

since then they are in continuous detention; that accused

Imran/* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
-4-

Mir Hakeem has spent three years, nine months and 03
days, while Hazratullah spent four years, four months
and 14 days in jail, and Mir Ghafoor is in continuous
detention since last more than three years; that delay in
concluding the trial is not attributed to the petitioners;
that petitioners are neither hardened nor desperate nor
previously convicted, therefore, they are entitled to be
released on bail under 3" proviso of sub-section (1) of
Section 497 Cr.PC.

5. As against that, learned counsel for the
complainant and the learned A.A.G. representing the
State jointly argued that period spent in jail after
conviction cannot be counted while deciding the petition
under 3" proviso of sub-section (1) of Section 497 Cr.PC
and if this period is deducted from total period of
detention in jail, it comes to less than two years; that
delay in concluding the trial is not attributed to the
prosecution; that the accused are hardened, desperate and
dangerous criminals, therefore, they are not entitled for
bail.

6. I have given my anxious consideration to the
arguments of the learned counsel for the parties and

scanned the record with their able assistance.

Imran/* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
-5-

7. The question emerging for consideration is as
to whether the period spent in the Jail after conviction of
the petitioners would be countable while deciding the
pettion under proviso 3™ of sub-section (1) of Section
497 Cr.PC or not. In order to answer this question, it
appears necessary to make cursory survey of the
provisions of Section 426 and 497 Cr.PC.

8. Section 426 Cr.PC empowers the appellate
Court to suspend sentence in pending appeal and release
the convict on bail. Condition under Section 426(1)
Cr.PC is analogous to the one contained in Section
497(1) Cr.PC, in both the cases the sentence or detention
is to be suspended and convict or the detenue is to be
released on bail with only difference that in the former
case the person is a convict who has already been found
guilty while in the latter case he has been charged only to
face trial and is still to be proved guilty. In the absence of
any guideline, it would be appropriate to follow the one
provided under Section 497 Cr.PC, on the principle that
where a statute lays down certain principles for doing
same acts they may be taken as a guideline for doing
something of the same nature which is in the discretion

of the Court.

Imran/* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
-6-

9. In order to decide the question of entitlement
of the petitioners to be released on bail on account of
statutory delay, it would be appropriate to trace out its
legislative history. 3" proviso was added in Section 497
Cr.PC through Ordinance No.LXXI of 1979, which reads
as under:-

“Provided further that the Court shall,
except where it is of opinion that the
delay in the trial of the accused has
been occasioned by an act or omission
of the accused or any other person
acting on his behalf, direct that any
person shall be released on bail.

(a) Who, being accused of an offence
not punishable with death, has been
detained for such offence for a
continuous period exceeding one year
and whose trial for such offence has not
concluded; or

(b) Who, being accused of an offence
punishable with death, has been
detained for such offence for a
continuous period exceeding two years
and whose trial for such offence has not

concluded.”

Then again in the year 1983, change was

brought in Section 497 Cr.PC through Ordinance

Imran/* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
-7-

No.XXXII of 1983, and 4" proviso was added, which is
reproduced herein below:-

“Provided further that the provisions of

the third proviso to this sub-section

shall not apply to a_ previously

convicted offender or to a person who,

in the opinion of the Court, is a

hardened, desperate or dangerous

criminal.”
10. Before 1979, no enabling provision was in
existence in Criminal Procedure Code, whereby a person
could be released on bail on account of delay in
conclusion of trial. Even then, prior to the insertion of 3“
proviso, the delay was already considered as a ground for
the grant of bail. However, at that time the Courts were
of the view that the delay must be inordinate or
scandalous in nature. In this respect reference may be
made to the judgment of the Honourable Lahore High
Court reported as “Ghulam Jillani Vs. SHO Gulberg”

(PLD 1975 Lahore 210), wherein it was observed that:-

“Similarly, on the question of bail after
arrest, after some amount of
uncertainty, the law is now well settled
that inordinate delay is a good ground
for bail even in those cases which
otherwise fall within the prohibition

contained in sub-section (1) of Section

Imran/* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
-8-

497, Cr.PC. Thus, the ground of delay
can be taken as another relevant
analogy for the present discussion. It
has been held that inordinate delay
amounting to abuse of process of law

furnishes good ground for bail.”

The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in
Ahrar Muhammad’s case PLD 1974 Supreme Court
224, held as under:-

“Tt is true that the view of the Supreme
Court has consistently been that mere
delay by itself is not a sufficient ground
for the granting of bail; but, at the same
time it cannot be said that inordinate or
unjustified delay in the prosecution of a
case amounting to an abuse of process
of law can never be taken into account
as relevant ground for the granting of
bail. If the delay is so inordinate or so
scandalous or so shocking as to amount
clearly to an abuse of the process of law
there can be no reason either in
principle of law as to why it cannot be
treated as a sufficient ground for the
granting of bail. If such delay can be
sufficient for quashing a_ criminal
proceeding then it can also be an
equally good ground for the granting of
bail.”

Imran/* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
-9.

It was noted with great concern that in the
past, the provision of 3" proviso of Section 497 Cr.PC
was misused. The Honourable Supreme Court of
Pakistan in Sh. Liaquat Hussain’s case PLD 1999 SC
504, observed that:-

“45. Before concluding the above
discussion it will not be out of context to
point out that the third proviso to
Section 497 the Criminal Procedure
Code is also substantially contributing
towards the delay in the disposal of
criminal cases as it entitles an accused
person accused of an offence not
punishable with death to obtain bail on
the expiry of one year from the date of
his arrest, and in case of an offence
punishable with death on the expiry of
two years period from the date of his
arrest. Some of the accused persons by
their design ensure that the trials of
their cases are delayed, so that they may
come out of jails on the expiry of the
above statutory period. In my humble
view, the above provision has been
misused and the same needs to be
deleted. I may also observe that even
before the incorporation of the above
proviso, it was open to a Court to grant
bail in a fit case on the ground of

inordinate delay in the trial of a case,

Imran/* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
-10-

but no accused person was entitled to
claim bail as a matter of right on the

expiry of certain period.”

Consequently, the 3" and 4" proviso were
omitted from Section 497 Cr.PC through Ordinance LIV
of 2001. However, again 3™ and 4" proviso of sub-
section (1) of Section 497 Cr.PC has been inserted by Act
VIII of 2011 w.e.f. 18.4.2011, which reads as under:-

“Provided further that the Court shall,
except where it is of the opinion that the
delay in the trial of the accused has
been occasioned by an act or omission
of the accused or any other person
acting on his behalf, direct that any
person shall be released on bail.

(a) Who, being accused of any offence
not punishable with death, has been
detained for such offence for a
continuous period exceeding one
year or in case of a woman
exceeding six months and whose
trial for such offence has not
concluded; or

(b) Who, being accused of an offence
punishable with death, has been
detained for such offence for a
continuous period exceeding two
years and in case of a woman
exceeding one year and whose trial

for such offence has not concluded.

Imran/* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
-ll-

Provided, further that the
provisions of the foregoing proviso
shall not apply to a_ previously
convicted offender for an_ offence
punishable with death or imprisonment
for life or to a person who, in the
opinion of the Court, is a hardened,
desperate or dangerous criminal or is
accused of an act of terrorism

punishable with death or imprisonment

for life.”
11. The gist of the aforementioned discussion is
that right of the accused to be enlarged on bail under the
3" proviso to Section 497(1) Cr.PC is a statutory right
which could not be denied under the discretionary power
of the Court to grant bail. However, bail under the 3“
proviso to Section 497 Cr.PC could be refused to an
accused only on the ground that the delay in the
conclusion of trial had been occasioned on account of
any act or omission of the accused or any other person
acting on his behalf. Bail under 3" proviso to Section 497
(1) Cr.PC could also be refused to an accused by the
Court, if case of the accused fell under the 4" proviso to
Section 497(1) Cr.PC, but in all other case the Court

must grant bail.

Imran/* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
12.

inherent right of every accused, and inordinate delay in
imparting justice was likely to cause erosion of public
confidence on one hand, and on the other, it was bound to
create sense of helplessness, despair and feelings of
frustration apart from adding to the woes of the public. In
this respect reliance can well be placed on the case

“Wazir Ali Vs. The State” (PLD 2005 K 201), wherein it

It is now settled that an early trial is an

was held as under:-

Imran/*

“I have given due consideration to the
arguments of the learned counsel for
the applicant and _ learned State
counsel. I have also gone through the
material placed on record and_ the
case-law cited at the bar. Indeed, a
direction to the trial Court to conclude
the trial within specified time if not
complied with, cannot be deemed to be
fresh ground as held in the case of
Muhammad Nawaz v. The State 2003
MLD 79, nevertheless, the delay in
conclusion of a trial when it appears to
be shocking and scandalous or when it
appears that complainant and_ his
witnesses have played a part in
delaying the conclusion of the trial by
remaining absent despite having been
served in order to see that accused

should remain incarcerated for as

(S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
-13-

much time as possible can be taken into
consideration for grant of bail. The
complainant and the P.Ws who are
related inter se and two of the witnesses
are real brothers of the complainant,
have failed to appear despite issuance
and service of P.Ws. against them, this
fact speaks for itself; Indeed, Provisos
(iii) and (iv) to section 497, Cr.P.C.
stand duly omitted during the pendency
of this case but even before introducing
the said provisos (iii) and (iv) to section
497(1), Cr.P.C. bail was being granted
in cases of delay in conclusion of the
trial which appeared to be scandalous
and shocking. Hardship is also being
considered as ground for bail in
appropriate cases by the superior

Courts of the country.”

Reliance is also placed on the case of “Sher
Ali_alias_ Sheri Vs. The State” (1998 SCMR 190),
wherein it was held that:-

“---§. 497(1), third & fourth provisos---
Bail on the ground of statutory delay---
Right of accused for bail under the
third proviso to S. 497(1), Cr.P.C.
cannot be defeated on any other ground
except the delay mentioned in the
relevant clause and the grounds

provided in the fourth proviso thereof.”

Imran/* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
-14-

13. I am also fortified by unreported judgment of
the apex Court in Criminal Petition No.1232 of 2016
titled, “Adnan Prince Vs. The State through P.G.,
Punjab and another” decided on 01.02.2017, wherein it
was held that if a case on statutory delay in the
conclusion of trial is made out then, ordinarily bail
should not be refused on hyper technical ground. It was
also held that “The Primary object behind this view is
that in case any accused person under detention is
acquitted at the end of the trial then, in no manner the
wrong, caused to him due to long incarceration in prison
pending trial, he cannot be compensated in any manner
while on the other hand, in case, if he is convicted then,
he has to be rearrested and put behind the bars to
undergo his sentence and in that case no prejudice would
be caused to the prosecution/complainant.”’

Reference in this behalf may be made from the
judgment of this Court reported as “Shahzad Khan Vs.
The State” (2018 P Cr.LJ 104), wherein it was observed
as under:-

“S.497---Bail statutory delay---Scope--
-Bail could not be refused on hyper
technical grounds if case on statutory
delay in conclusion of trial was made

”

out.

Imran/* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
-15-

In this respect reference may also be made
from the judgment reported as “Behram VS. The State”
(2003 P Cr.LJ 73), wherein it was held that “fair and
expeditious trial is fundamental right of the accused
person which cannot be denied to him.”

14. In my view it is a fit case for grant of bail, as
the accused are to face the agonies of protracted trial,
once again, after remand of their case, they cannot be
kept in jail for indefinite period, therefore, I hold that the
whole period spent in Jail is countable while deciding the
bail petition on statutory delay. It is immaterial whether
those period spent as convict or under trial prisoner.

15. For what has been discussed above, I am of
the view that since the petitioners are in continuous
detention and have spent more than three years in Jail,
therefore, they are entitled to the grant of bail as a matter
of right and not as a matter of grace, accordingly, the
Cr.MBA. No.475-B/2017 and connected Cr. MBA.No.24-
B/2018 are accepted and the accused are directed to be
released on bail subject to furnishing bail bonds in the
sum of Rs.3,00,000/- (Rupees three lac) each, with two
sureties each, in the like amount to the satisfaction of

Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate.
