SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.--- Through this appeal

under section 410 Cr.P.C, appellant has called in question
the judgment dated 31.01.2022 passed by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-VI / Judge Juvenile Court,
Bannu in case FIR No.310 dated 13.06.2019 under
section 302 PPC registered at Police Station Ghoriwala,
Bannu, whereby, he was convicted under section 302(b)
PPC and sentenced to imprisonment for life alongwith
fine of Rs.1,00,000/- or in default thereof, to undergo
three months simple imprisonment. Benefit under section

382-B Cr.P.C was extended to the appellant.
i

2. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant has questioned the
legality of the impugned judgment and the awarded
sentence through instant appeal.

3. Brief facts of the case as divulged in the first
information report are that on 13.06.2019 at 18:00 hours,
complainant Usman in injured condition at emergency
ward of Civil Hospital, Bannu lodged a report to the
effect that on that day, he was present in the fields of
Farid Khan within the area of Abid Khel, when at 12:00
hours, accused Issa Khan armed w:th 12 bore rifle came
there and the moment started firing at him, due to which,
he got hit and injured; the accused decamped from the
spot after the commission of offence, whereas, he was
brought to the hospital by people of the locality. Motive
is alleged to be dispute over money.:Hence, the ibid FIR.
4. After completion of investigation and arrest of the
accused, prosecution submitted complete challan, where
at the commencement of trial, the prosecution produced
and examined as many as 17 witnesses. On close of
prosecution evidence, statement of appellant / accused
was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he
professed innocence and false implication, however,
neither he opted to be examined on oath as provided
under section 340(2) Cr.P.C, nor wished to produce

j
i

defence evidence. After hearing arguments, the learned
trial Court vide the impugned judgment, convicted and
sentenced the appellant as mentioned above. Hence, the
instant appeal against the judgment of conviction.

5. It is pertinent to mention that Nadir Khan, son of
the deceased, had put appearance before the office stating
that being poor, he could not engage private counsel,
hence, opted to rely upon the arguments to be made by
the learned A.A.G vide office note dated 19.04.2022. The
same was his stance even today. So, learned counsel for
the appellant and learned Assistant Advocate General
were heard at length and with their valuable assistance,
the record was gone through.

6. The unfortunate incident occurred on 13.06.2019 at
about 12:00 hours, when the deceased then injured
namely Usman present in the fields of one Farid Khan,
within the area of Abid Khel was fired at by the appellant
Issa Khan through 12 bore rifle. Soon after receiving
firearm injury, the deceased then injured was shifted to
the THQ Hospital, Naurang, wherefrom he was referred
to DHQ Hospital, Bannu for further treatment, where he
reported the occurrence. The deceased then injured while
reporting the matter, charged the convict / appellant for

the effective fire shot. The injured was referred for
specialized treatment, but unfortunately, he could not
survive and lost his battle between life and death. The
investigating officer after collecting copy of the FIR,
visited the spot and prepared the site plan on his personal
observations and also collected bloodstained earth from
the place of the deceased. Though, the learned trial Court
was pleased to convict the appellant, yet this being the
court of appeal, is under the bounden duty to reassess the
available record and to scan through the collected
material to know as to whether it was the convict /
appellant who killed the deceased and as to whether the
deceased then injured was capable to talk.

7. The duty of a judge is to find out the truth in
respect of a particular disposition process as part of
justice delivery mechanism. So, the facts have to be
scrutinized and evidence has to be adduced in order to
substantiate the story so narrated. Dying declaration
being statement of a person, who is no more to assist the
judge in order to ascertain the facts which constituted the
crime of which he has been the victim. The law
recognizes the statement made by a dying person. Article
46 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 explores the
concept of dying declaration, which deals with cases

related to that person who is dead or who cannot be
found. A dying declaration is admissible in evidence even
though. it has not been made on oath and the person
making it cannot be cross examined. Admissibility of a
dying declaration as a relevant piece of evidence is
guided by the principle of necessity and religious belief
of the olden days. The necessity being, that in cases,
where victim is the only eyewitness to crime, the
exclusion of his statement might defeat the ends of
justice. A person who makes a dying declaration must,
however, be competent to make the statement at the time
he makes it, otherwise it would be inadmissible.
Recording of dying declaration being an important task,
so utmost care is required to be taken while recording
such declaration. If a dying declaration is recorded
carefully, keeping in mind its essential ingredients, such
declaration retains its full value. Though, in the earlier
days, the statement of a dying man was looked into with
honour and there was a concept behind the statement so
recorded that a dying man will not tell a lie. This was
because of the fact that ‘a dying man seldom lies’ or
‘truth sits upon the lips of a dying man’. By the time, no
need was felt for its corroboration, but with passage of
time, the values changed and morality degraded to a

greater extent, so need was felt to look for independent
corroboration and this was so, that the Apex Court of the
country went with repeated change in respect of the
statement recorded by a dying man, though at times, the
Apex Court was of the opinion that it needs no
corroboration, but with the passage of time, when the
amplitude changed with drastic change in moral and
social values, so ultimately, the same was declared as a
weak kind of evidence. Therefore, it is not safe to convict
an accused person merely on the evidence of a dying
declaration without corroboration, because such a
statement is not made on oath and is not subject to cross
examination and because the maker of it might be
mentally or physically in a state of compassion and might
be drawing upon his imagination while he was making
the declaration. Hence, as a safeguard, a stress has been
laid on corroboration of the dying declaration before it is
being acted upon.

8. The Court is to see that dying declaration inspires
confidence or otherwise, as the maker of the dying
declaration is not available for cross examination. The
court should be satisfied that there :was no possibility of
tutoring or prompting and evidence to the effect that the
dying declarant was in a fit state of mind must be

brought. As dying declaration requires close scrutiny and
corroboration and the court must satisfy itself about its
genuineness and truthfulness, so it has to be seen that
whether at the time of its making, the declarant was in
full senses, conscious, alert to the surroundings and fully
oriented in time and space, beside being able to make a
coherent statement. The dying declaration must ring true
and the doctor present shall give a fitness certificate about
the condition of the dying person. It is noteworthy that
the declarant is in a fit condition of mind to give the
statement when recording was started and remained in fit
condition of mind, until the recording of dying
declaration is completed. The fact of fit condition of mind
of declarant can be best certified by the doctor, yet in
case where it was not possible to take fitness certificate
from the doctor, dying declaration still retains its sanctity,
if there are other witnesses to testify that the declarant
was in fit condition of the mind. However, the dying
statement should not be under the influence of anybody
or prepared by prompting, tutoring or imagination. When
interested witness has attended the deceased when he was
making a dying declaration and because of the injuries,
the deceased is neither physically or mentally fit, no
reliance can be placed on such dying declaration, in the

absence of evidence to show that the deceased was
physically and mentally capable of making the dying
declaration and was not the victim of any tutoring. The
matter to believe or disbelieve a dying declaration is,
however, left to the ordinary human judgment, but the
courts always insist upon strong, independent and reliable
corroboration for safe administration of justice, as relying
blindly without scrutiny of such statement would be a
dangerous approach. So, we are to see as to whether at
the time of making the dying declaration, the deceased
then injured was fully oriented in time and _ space,
conscious, alert to the surroundings and in full senses; as
to whether the doctor has furnished fitness certificate to
that effect; as to whether the deceased was attended by
his relatives, if so, whether he was tutored or prompted to
implicate the accused charged in view of the attending
facts & circumstances of the present case and as to
whether the dying declaration has been corroborated by
other independent evidence or otherwise.

9. _ Diverting to the facts of the case, the prime
question which is to be determined at first instance is
whether at the time of making the dying declaration, the
complainant was conscious and capable to talk or
otherwise. In order to determine this question, we are to

examine the statements made by the scribe and the doctor
i
who examined the deceased then injured. It may be noted
that the occurrence has taken place at 12:00 hours,
whereas, the report has been lodged at 16:50 hours. The
deceased then injured had received nine firearm entry
wounds on lower back in the middle with two exit
wounds in pelvic area in the middle and it has been
claimed after receiving the injuries, that he remained on
the spot for sufficient time and when people of the
locality came there, he was shifted to the hospital. It is an
admitted position that the deceased then injured was
initially shifted to THQ Hospital, Naurang and therefrom
he was referred to DHQ Hospital, Bannu where he
reported the occurrence. The scribe was examined as PW-
04 whose statement is completely silent as regards
making of application for obtaining opinion of the doctor
regarding consciousness, alertness and capability of the
deceased then injured as to talk. The doctor who
examined the complainant in DHQ Hospital, Bannu was
produced as PW-05, but neither he has furnished a
certificate nor endorsed the injury sheet to the effect that
the deceased was conscious, well oriented in time and
space and fully capable to make the statement. Similarly,
the medico legal certificate furnished by the doctor is also

silent regarding capability of the complainant to talk.
-10-

There is no denial to the fact that in order to believe a
dying declaration, it is, inter alia, one of the essential
ingredients that the prosecution must establish through
reliable evidence that the dying person was in full senses,
conscious and alert to the surroundings, beside being
fully oriented in time and space and was able to make a
coherent statement and to this effect, the doctor present at
the occasion, must furnish a fitness certificate about the
condition of a dying person, but that is not the case before
us. When the doctor was examined as PW-05, he
admitted that no application regarding the capability of
the injured was moved by the police. He admitted that the
timing i.e. 04:50 hours is the time of arrival of injured to
emergency and his examination by him. When such is the
position, then the claim of the scribe that he scribed the
murasila report at 04:50 hours, prepared the injury sheet
of the injured and sent him to the doctor for medical
examination becomes falsified. It hes not been claimed by
the scribe that he used to pen down report of the
complainant while he was being under examination of the
doctor due to his serious condition. The doctor further
admitted it correct that due to severe pain, the injured was

unable to talk. Though, due to this:admission, an attempt

was made by the prosecution to declare the said witness
-ll-

hostile, but it could not be, however, the learned trial
court in exercise of its jurisdiction under section 540
Cr.P.C, summoned the doctor reexamined him on this
particular aspect of the case, where he claimed that by the
sentence “due to severe pain, the injured was unable to
talk”, he meant that as the injured was suffering from
severe pain, so he was avoiding to talk. In cross
examination, the witness admitted that soon after the
injured was brought to the hospital, he was medically
administered and after passing through required surgery,
he was returning into normal state of health. It was
further admitted that when the injured was brought to the
hospital, he, due to severe pain, was making hue & cry
and was avoiding to talk. If the admissions made by the
doctor are juxtaposed with the surrounding facts of the
present case, where neither the scribe moved an
application for obtaining opinion from the doctor
regarding capability of the complainant as to talk nor the
doctor of his own opined in unequivocal terms that the
deceased was conscious, oriented in time and space and
fully capable to talk nor the medico legal report confirms
such aspect, so it can be concluded that the deceased then
injured was not capable to talk at the time of making the

report. We are surprised that when the doctor in
-12-

unequivocal terms admitted that the injured was unable to
talk, then what ambiguity was left for the trial Court to
re-examine him for explanation. If the medico legal
report is seen, it has nowhere been mentioned that the
deceased was in full senses and that he was capable to
talk. Similarly, no certificate regarding consciousness and
capability of the deceased as to talk was tendered. As the
cross examination is the greatest engine ever invented for
the discovery of truth, so when it was categorically
admitted by the doctor that the deceased was unable to
speak, then such admission ¢an be taken into
consideration against the prosecution, particularly when
the surrounding circumstances of the case speaks against
the prosecution version. The explanation tendered by the
doctor during his re-examination seems to be an
afterthought.

10. It is surprising to note that prior to his shifting to
DHQ Hospital, Bannu, the deceased was given first aid at
THQ Hospital, Naurang, but neither his medical
documents were brought on record to confirm his
capability regarding making a stateraent nor his statement
was penned down in the said hospital. Even, the
prosecution has not been able to advance explanation,

much less plausible, for this omission. It is also a mystery
-13-

as to who took and brought the complainant from the spot
to the THQ Hospital, Naurang. Interestingly, Nadir Khan,
son of the deceased, was produced as PW-17 who
deposed that his father was murdered by the appellant and
that he relies upon the statement of his father who has
charged the appellant for the offence. When this witness
was cross examined, he admitted that he is not eye
witness of the occurrence and that he was present with his
father at DHQ Hospital, Bannu at the time of making the
report by his father. He also claimed that he had
accompanied his father to THQ Hospital, Naurang, but it
is strange to note that neither report was made in the said
hospital nor medical documents pertaining to
examination of the deceased were brought on record. The
physical circumstances of the present case in particular
reference to the lapses on part of the scribe and the doctor
coupled with the conduct of the prosecution in not
bringing medical documents of the deceased pertaining to
his first examination at THQ Hospital, Naurang do
suggest that the deceased then injured was unconscious
and so uncomfortable, that he could neither be able to
make a statement nor was in senses, that’s why no report
was made in THQ Hospital, Naurang and it was only

after the procurement of his son namely Nadir Khan
-14-

(PW-17), that the accused was charged on his instance at
DHQ Hospital, Bannu. It has been alleged that the dying
declaration was made by the complainant in presence of
his son (PW-17) and it was recorded by a police official.
When dying declaration is recorded by a police official,
that too, in presence of a person having blood relation
with the declarant is considered suspect and less worthy
of credence. Though, mere presence of relative who
brought the deceased in injured condition to the hospital
would not, by itself, impair the evidentiary value of
statement made by the deceased while in critical
condition, but as the instant case has its own peculiar
facts & circumstances, where the consciousness, alertness
and capability of the deceased as to talk has not been
proved and that the deceased was given first aid at THQ
Hospital, Naurang where neither his report was penned
down nor his medical documents were brought on record
to substantiate the capability of the deceased as to talk, so
the presence of complainant with the deceased at the time
of making the report at DHQ Hospiial, Bannu has reacted
against the prosecution version. In this regard, wisdom
can also be derived from the judgment rendered by the
Apex Court in case titled “Nazim Khan and 02 others Vs

The State” (1984 SCMR 1092) wherein it was held that:
-15-

"As this Court has held in

Ghulam Farid v. The State a

dying declaration recorded at a

police station, when the relatives

who have brought the injured

there are present is always

suspect and certainly less worthy

of credence than one recorded

by a Magistrate after excluding

the relatives."
11. As the deceased then injured was lying in the fields
after he was being fired at, that too, for a considerable
time, wherefrom he was shifted to the hospital, so the
persons who attended him at first hand and shifted him to
the hospital were most relevant, as there is every
likelihood that had he been in a position to make
statement, he would have narrated before them the actual
story, but none of them was produced to support the
prosecution case. It was also noticed that while recording
the dying declaration, provisions of Rule 25-21 of the
Police Rules, 1934 pertaining to recording of dying
declaration were negated, which further created flaws in

the present case. The said rule reads as under:
-16-

25-21. Dying declaration: (1) A
dying declaration shall, whenever

possible, be recorded by a Magistrate.

(2) The person making the
declaration shall, if, possible be
examined by a medical officer with a
view to ascertaining that he is
sufficiently in possession of his

reason to make a lucid statement.

(3) If no magistrate can obtained, the
obtained, the declaraticn shall, when a
gazetted police officer is not present,
be recorded in the presence of two or
more reliable witnesses unconnected
with the police department and with

the parties concerned in the case.

(4) If no such witnesses can be
obtained without risk of the injured
person dying before his statement can
be recorded, it shall be recorded in the
presence of two or more police

officers.

(5) A dying declaration made to a
police officer should, under section
162, Code Criminal Procedure, be

signed by the person making it.

12. The story narrated in the FIR is yet another factor

which pricks our mind. It depicted that on one hand, there

f
-17-

was a dispute over money between the appellant and the
deceased, whereas, on the other, it has been claimed by
the deceased that the weapon used in the commission of
offence was owned by him and that,the same was given to
the appellant at his request made earlier on the day of
incident. If there was serious dispute between the
appellant and the deceased, then the deceased was not
supposed to have given his weapon to the appellant.
Contrarily, if the dispute was not so serious that the
deceased gave his weapon to the appellant, then the
appellant was not supposed to have committed his
murder. Besides, the rule of prudence does not accept that
a person will give his own weapon to his opponent, that
too, when there existed a dispute of such a degree which
later results in his death through the said weapon. The
conduct of the deceased on this particular aspect of the
case is not above board and the behaviour he adopted goes
against the human psychology.

13. As stated above, the deceased then injured was
firstly brought to the THQ Hospital, Naurang, but none of
the persons who brought him there was examined
regarding the episode and his capability as to talk nor his
medical documents confirming his capability as to talk

were produced. It has not been plausibly explained as to
-18-

why statement of the declarant was not penned down in
the said hospital. As regards the dying statement made in
the DHQ Hospital, Bannu, neither the doctor has
furnished fitness certificate regarding capability of the
deceased then injured as to talk nor has this aspect been
specifically mentioned in the medico legal report. The
admissions made by the doctor in his court statement
regarding the condition of the deceased has further
damaged the claim of the frosecution regarding
consciousness, alertness and capability of the deceased
then injured as to talk. Presence Nadir Khan (PW-17) with
his deceased father at the time of making the statement
has further clouded the episode with doubts and in view of
the aforesaid circumstances of the present case, possibility
of tutoring or prompting of the deceased by his son to
name the appellant for the crime, if it is presumed that the
injured was able to make the report, cannot be ruled out.
At the same time, as the very consciousness, alertness and
capability as to talk of the deceased is doubtful, so
possibility that the story would have been narrated by his
son to the scribe can also not be ruled out in entirety.

14. The investigating officer while appearing as PW-11
claimed that he visited the hospital, where he recorded

statement of the deceased then injured at 23:00 hours, but
-19-

it is strange that when the deceased was stable and
remained alive for six days, then why such statement was
not recorded in presence of Magistrate. The record is
silent regarding permission having’ been obtained by the
investigating officer from the Medical Officer for
recording statement of the deceased as to his fitness to
make statement. Question that when the deceased was
stable then why he was referred to Peshawar is still
unanswered. It has been claimed by PW-15 that after his
arrest, the appellant confessed his guilt before him, but the
law is well settled that such statement can neither be
termed as confession in its legal parlance nor any
credence could be extended to the same. In this regard,
reliance can be placed on the judgment rendered by the
Apex Court in case titled “Gul Muhammad and another
Vs_ The State through Prosecutor _General_Punjab”
(2021 SCMR 381) in which it was held that:

“It is strange enough that the extra

judicial confession recorded in the

presence of police personnel when

they were under arrest and at the

time of making statement they ware

also in handcuffs. This practice of

recording extra judicial confession
-20-

by the police officials in presence of

police officers is nullity in the eye of

law and no credence can be extended

to this piece of evidence. ”
15. The cumulative effect of what has been stated
above is that the prosecution has failed to establish
consciousness, alertness and capability of the deceased
then injured as to talk. It has also not been proved that the
complainant was in full senses while making the report.
The story set-forth in the FIR is dubious and does not
appeal to a prudent mind. The essential ingredients
required for acting upon dying declaration have neither
been fulfilled nor established on record. The dying
declaration has, therefore, become not worthy of
credence.
16. The next important piece of evidence collected
during investigation is the recovery of weapon of offence
at the instance and pointation of the appellant. The
weapon of offence was neither sent to forensic science
laboratory to confirm that the same was in working
condition nor any independent evidence regarding its
recovery at the instance of the appellant has been brought
on record. It has not been proved that it was the same

weapon which was used in the commission of offence.
-21-

The dying declaration has not been corroborated by any
independent sort of evidence inspiring confidence. As
crime empties were not recovered in the instant case and
forensic science laboratory’s report has also not been
brought on record, so the mere recovery of alleged
weapon of offence becomes useless.

17. The motive for the occurrence is not convincing
either and even, the prosecution has failed to prove the
same. Though, absence or weakness of motive, by itself,
is not sufficient to dislodge the prosecution case, but when
the same is set up, it has to be proved by the prosecution
and the same is to be scrutinized and adjudged by the
court in order to arrive to a just conclusion. It is trite law
that failing to prove motive will react against the
prosecution and not the defence. As the prosecution could
not produce an iota of evidence in support of the motive,
so it will be the prosecution to suffer the consequence.

18. In corollary to the above :discussion, we have
reached to an inescapable conclusion to hold the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove the charges
against the appellant beyond clouds of doubt. The
prosecution case is suffering from legal defects and
inherent flaws which have cut its roots. The learned trial

judge has failed to appreciate the evidence brought before
-22-

d¢ and the worth of the dying declaration in its legal
parlance. The instant case is left with no legs to stand
upon. The impugned judgment passed by the learned trial
court cannot, therefore, be maintained. We, therefore,
accept the instant criminal appeal and set the impugned
judgment aside. Consequently, the appellant is acquitted
of the charges; he shall be released forthwith, provided his
detention is not required in connection with any other
criminal case.

19. The above are the detailed reasons for our short
order of even date.
