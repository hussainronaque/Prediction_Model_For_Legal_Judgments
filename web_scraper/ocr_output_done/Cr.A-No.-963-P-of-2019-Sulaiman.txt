ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- This single judgment shall
dispose off the present Criminal Appeal No. 963-P/2019 filed by
appellant Sulaiman son of Saadat Khan against his conviction and
sentence, and Criminal Revision No.182-P/2019 filed by Riaz Khan
complainant-petitioner for enhancement of sentence awarded to
accused-respondent Sulaiman (Appellant in Cr.Appeal No.963-
P/2019), as both are arising from one and the same impugned
judgment dated 20.07.2019 rendered by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge/Judge Model Criminal Trial Court, Mardan, in case
FIR No.235 dated 31.05.2014 under sections-302/34 PPC,
registered at Police Station Saddar, District Mardan, whereby the

appellant Suleman was convicted and sentenced as under;
i. Under Section-316 PPC to suffer rigorous
imprisonment for 14 years as Tazir and to pay
Diyat at the prevailing rate to the legal heirs of
deceased in lump sum and shall remain in prison
till payment of Diyat amount.

ii. Benefit of section-382-B Cr.PC was extended to the
appellant.

2. Facts of the prosecution case are that on 31.05.2014 Riaz Khan son
of Zainullah and his relatives brought the dead body of his son Abu Bakar
to Casualty Hospital, Mardan, in Rescue-1122 Ambulance; that at 15.20
hours Riaz Khan reported the matter to Ali Zar Shah Khan SI posted at
Casualty DHQ, Mardan, to the effect that on the day of occurrence he
alongwith his son Abu Bakar and Saeed Khan son of Mir Hassan were
present near the chicken shop of his deceased son; that at 14.15 hours
Sulaiman and Kamran sons of Saadat came to the shop of his deceased
son and sought to purchase chicken on credit/loan basis and on refusal of
his son, upon which both the accused became furious, grappled with the
deceased and gave kicks and fists blows to the deceased on his head, heart
and other parts of the body due to which his son became unconscious; that
the persons present on the spot called Ambulance-1122 and while on way
to the hospital, his son expired; that besides him the occurrence was also
witnessed by Saeed Khan. The dispute was reported to be over purchase
of chicken on loan basis. The complainant charged both the accused for

the murder of his son. The report of the complainant was reduced into
writing in the shape of murasila and sent to police station for registration
of case FIR against the accused through constable Sohail No.3035. The
injury sheet and inquest report of the deceased were prepared and the dead
body of the deceased was referred to the doctor for conducting autopsy
under the escort of constable Ijaz No.2794. Both the accused were
arrested on 05.05.2015, vide card of arrest (EX PW 4/1) wherein the age
of accused Kamran has been mentioned as 16-17 years, therefore, he was
declared Juvenile, and separate challan under the Juvenile Justice System
Ordinance, 2000, was submitted against him.

3. After completion of investigation, supplementary challan against
the accused Sulaiman was submitted and provisions of section-265-C
Cr.PC were complied with. Formal charge against him was framed, to
which he did not plead guilty and claimed trial.

4. The prosecution in order to prove its case, examined as many as
eight (08) witnesses. The important prosecution witnesses are, Dr.
Zafrullah (PW-1) deposed that on 31.05.2014 at 3:45 PM, he conducted
postmortem examination on the dead body of the deceased Abu Bakar son

of Riaz brought by his relatives and found the following:

“The deceased was brought on 31.5.2014 at 3.20 P.M.

External appearance:
Condition of subject _stout_body. No rigormortis, wearing blue
clothes showing no blood stains. No visible injury or marks of
violence on his body.

Remarks. In my opinion death was caused due to cardio respiratory arrest.

Probable time between injury and death..Instantaneous.

Probable time between death and PM, Within two hours.”
Ali Zar Shah Khan SI (PW-02) reiterated the same facts, which he has
recorded in murasila. Riaz Khan complainant (PW-6) reiterated the
same story, which he has reported in his initial report and that the 1.0
prepared the site plan at his instance. Saeed Khan (PW-7) also supported
the version of the complainant. Taj Muhammad Khan SI (PW-8), who
conducted investigation of the case, prepared site plan (EX PB) at the
instance of complainant and Saeed Khan eyewitness and took into
possession the clothes of the deceased vide recovery memo (EX PW 8/1)
on the spot. He also recorded statements of the PWs under section-161
Cr.PC.

5. After closure of prosecution evidence, the accused was examined
under Section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he discarded the allegations leveled
against him by the prosecution and claimed innocence. He neither wished
to be examined on Oath under Section 340 (2) Cr.P.C nor opted to
produce defence evidence. After hearing the learned counsel for the
parties, the learned trial Court vide impugned judgment dated 20.07.2019
convicted and sentenced the appellant.

6. We have heard arguments of the learned counsel for the parties and
gone through the evidence with their valuable assistance.

7. Initially charge was framed under section-302/34 PPC, but

subsequently the learned trial Court convicted the appellant under section-
316 PPC for Qatl Shibh-i-amd of the deceased. Five types of Qatals have
been defined and their respective punishments have been provided by
Chapter-XVI of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, which are;

i. Qatl-i-amd. (302 PPC)

ii. —_ Qatl shibh-i-amd, (316 PPC)

iii, Qatl-i-khata, (319 PPC)

iv. _Qatl-i-khata by rash or negligent driving, (320 PPC)
y  Qatl-bis-sabab, (322 PPC)

Only for Qatl-i-amd, the intention and mens-rea is required while for the
rest of the categories of Qatal provided under this chapter, there is no need
of mens-rea for the Qatal of the victim, even the mens rea, is for not
committing the Qatal and during that course, the offence is committed
under Chapter-XVI of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, the offender is
liable for the offence not withstanding his intention provided his case
comes within the definitions of different types of Qatal mentioned above.
8. Now before adverting to the merits of the case, first we have to see
the definition of Qatl-i-Shibh-i-amd as provided under section-315 of the
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, which reads;

“Whoever, with intent to cause harm to the body or mind
of any person, causes the death of that or of any other
person by means of a weapon or an act which in the ordinary
course of nature is not likely to cause death is said to commit
Qatl Shibh-i-amd.”

(emphasis provided)

In case of “Federation of Pakistan..vs..Gul Hassan Khan”, (PLD 1989

SC 663), the provisions of Chapter-XVI right from Sections-299 till 338

were held to be repugnant to the injunctions of Islam mainly on the
ground that the same do not provide for Qisas in cases of Qatl-i-Amd and
it was also held by the Apex Court that in cases of Qatl-e-Shibh-i.amd,
Qatl-i-Khata, no provisions for payment of Diyat and Arsh are in
existence and more so, the offence being compoundable under the Islamic
Law were not compoundable under the old dispensation of justice
provided by Chapter-XVI of PPC with regard to the offences against
human body.

The definition of Qatl-i-Shibh-i-amd as to our comprehension lays
down two categories for the commission of Qatl-i-Shibh-i-amd;

(3) With intent to cause harm to the body or
(ii) | Mind of any person causes the death of that person or any other
person.

The act which in the ordinary course of nature is not likely to cause death
is said to commit Qatl Shibh-i-amd. The first part regarding harm to the
body can be further clarified from the illustration to Section-315 of the
PPC, which reads as follows;

“A in order to cause hurt strikes Z with a stick or stone

which in the ordinary course of nature is not likely to

cause death. Z dies as a result of such hurt. A shail be

guilty of Qatl Shibh-i-amd.”
The main distinguishing feature between “Qatl-i-Amd and Qatl-i-Shibh-i-
Amd” is that in case of Qatl-i-amd the intention of assailant is must to

cause death or such bodily injury which in the ordinary course of nature

was ‘likely to cause death’; whereas in case of Qatl-i-Shibh-i-amd, the
intention should be to cause such harm to the body or mind of the person
which in ordinary course of nature was ‘not likely to cause death’. In case
of ‘Qatl-i-shibh-i-amd’, intention to cause death or cause such bodily
injury is not sine qua non for the proof of the charge.

9. The core point of difference between “Qatl-bis-sabab” and “Qatl
Shibh-i-amd” is that in the former case there is no intention to cause death
or cause harm to the victim, whereas in the latter case the offender
possesses intention to cause harm to the body or mind of the victim but
not his death. Here question crop up how to ascertain intention of the
offender to cause harm to the body or mind of the victim, which has
caused death. The determining factor would be the nature of the weapon,
instrument, force with which it is used or the nature of the act and its
consequential effect/result.

10. Section-338-F of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, by use of the word
shall make it mandatory for the Courts that in the interpretation of
provisions of Chapter-XVI guidance shall be derived from the injunction
of Islam as laid down in the Holy Quran and Sunnah. For convenience
section-338-F PPC is reproduced below;

“338-F. Interpretation: In the interpretation and
application of the provisions of this Chapter, and in
respect of matter ancillary or akin thereto, the Court shall
be guided by the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the
Holy Quran and Sunnah.”
8
At times, different Islamic Jurists have interpreted and explained Qatl-
Shibh-i-amd in its true perspective and with most particular reference to
the harm to the body and have almost consensus on the preposition which
is clarified in the illustration of section-315 PPC. In this regard, the view

of different scholars/Islamic jurists is as follows;

11. From the above interpretation of religious scholars, we are of the
firm view that the first category of Qatl-Shibh-i-Amd i.e with regard to
harm to the body, the religious scholars are of the same view and they are
almost unanimous that if the harm intended to be caused is not of such a
gravity, which in ordinary course would cause the Qatal of a person then
the offender would be liable for Qatl-Shibh-i-Amd, of course that would
be subject to legal proof and evidence is to be led in this regard.

12. Now coming to the second category of Qatl-i-amd with regard to
the causing of harm to the mind, it is manifest from the language of the
section that the second category of Qatl Shibh-i-amd, relates to causing of
harm to the mind of the victim or any other person whose death is not
intended. The law makers while using the word harm to mind has not
specifically mentioned hurt to mind for the reason that harm to mind is
something psychological relating to the intellect of a particular individual
by putting him in such a position to cause psychological stress in order to
cause harm to his mind, causes the death of that particular person without
intention of the same is liable for the punishment provided for Qatl Shibh-
i-amd under section-316 PPC. According to Legal Terms and Phrases
authored by M.Ilyas Khan, published by B.M. Publishers, that the word
harm has not been specifically defined in the Penal Code. In its ordinary

dictionary meaning, it denotes hurt, injury, damage, impairment, moral
13
wrong or evil. The expression has been used in Pakistan Penal Code, in
sections-81, 87, 88, 89, 91, 92, 100, 104, and 106. In section-93, it is used
in a sense of mental reaction while another it is the physical injury.

Black’s Law Dictionary (9" Edition), provides the meaning of word harm
injury, Joss, damage, material or tangible detriment. According to the
Mitra’s Legal and Commercial Dictionary (sixth Edition) harm means
the existence of loss or detriment in fact of any kind to a person resulting
from any cause; injury, loss , or detriment.

13. From the above dictionary’s meaning of the word harm, it is
abundantly clear that there must be some act to the detriment of the other
side, which results in causes harm to the mind of the person whose death
has not been intended, but it results into the Qatal of that victim or any
other person, would squarely comes within the definition of Qatl-i-Shibh
Amd as defined in section-315 of the PPC and for the proof of charge for
causing harm to the mind, prosecution is duty bound to bring on record
tangible and lucid evidence.

14. While appraising the merits of the present case in light of the above
discussion, the murasila reveals that the complainant and his relatives
brought the dead body of his deceased son to Casualty DHQ Hospital,
Mardan in Rescue-1122 Ambulance, and at 15.20 hours lodged report.

The complainant in his cross examination stated that he and only PW
14
Saeed had accompanied the deceased in Rescue-1122 Ambulance to DHQ
Hospital, that firstly he lodged the report and then the deceased was
examined by the doctor while in the postmortem examination report (EX
PW 1/1) the doctor has mentioned that the dead body of the deceased was
brought by relatives at 3.20 PM. The complainant in his initial report
stated that while on way to the Hospital, his son expired. The complainant
in his cross examination stated that after the occurrence 15-20 people
attracted to the spot and the Rescue-1122 came to the spot after 15-20
minutes of the occurrence, however, as per postmortem examination
report probable time that elapsed between injury and death was
instantaneous. The occurrence is stated to have taken place at 14.15 hours
and the Rescue-1122 Ambulance came to the spot after 15-20 minutes of
the occurrence, while Saeed Khan (PW-7) the eyewitness contradicted the
complainant by stating that on the spot they remained till 02.15 P.M. The
complainant and eyewitness both have stated that both the accused gave
kicks and fists blows to the deceased on his head, heart and other parts of
the body and the deceased fell to the ground and became unconscious.
The dead body of the deceased was examined by the doctor and no visible
injury or marks of violence was found on the dead body of the deceased
and according to his opinion the death was caused due to cardio

respiratory arrest and in his cross examination he further stated that
15

unnatural causes of death might be due to firearm injury, due to accident,
due to stabbed sharp weapon, poisoning, by hitting of heavy object,
strangulation, and according to the history of the present case no such
causes are the result of the death of the deceased.

15. The complainant is running the business of wood cutting and
selling and residing in village Baja Killi while the crime shop is situated
in village Zakir Abad and the inter-se distance is about one furlong. Saeed
Khan (PW-7) the eyewitness of occurrence is a school teacher and
performing his duty as a teacher in Fagir Banr Baghdada, the distance
between his village and the said school is 5-6 kilometers while the
distance between the house of complainant and PW Saeed Khan is 120
paces as per complainant. Saeed Khan (PW-7) the eyewitness in his cross
examination stated that;

“I left the school at 12.35 PM. In the said school there are
about 16 teachers. On reaching to my home I took launch
and then went for Zuhar prayer at about 01.30 PM and
attended congregational prayer. After performing the prayer
I came back to the home at about 02.00 PM. The house of
complainant is at a distance of 30/40 paces from my house.
..«. J met the complainant at about 02.05 PM.”

16. The occurrence took place on 31.5.2014 at 14.15 hours and
admittedly in a summer season. The complainant is admittedly running
the business of wood cutting and selling while eyewitness Saeed Khan is a
school teacher. It is not believable to a prudent mind that being a summer

season and at 02.15 P.M they met each other near the place of occurrence
16
per chance. The complainant being father of the deceased while
eyewitness Saeed Khan being maternal uncle of the deceased have shown
their presence near the spot which is repellent to common course of
action, because both of them did not offer any plausible and confidence
inspiring reason of their visit/presence at the spot and as such both the
witnesses i.e complainant and eyewitnesses are to be considered as chance

witnesses. In this regard, reliance is placed upon the judgment of Hon’ble

Supreme Court rendered in Usman alias Kaloo’s case (20177 SCMR-622),

wherein it was held that;

“The occurrence in this case had taken place in the dead of a night, Le. at
11.30 p.m. on 05.03.2005 and the investigating officer had stated before the
trial court in black and white that no electric light was available at the spot.
The occurrence in issue had taken place outside the house of the deceased
and in the absence of any source of light at the spot the question regarding
identification of the assailant had assumed pivotal importance but the
prosecution had paid no heed to the same. The FIR about the alleged
incident had been lodged at the spot whereat the local police had arrived
on its own after having statedly been informed of the occurrence by one
Afzal who had not been produced before the trial court, The ocular
account of the incident had been furnished by Zahoor Ahmad complainant
(PW-3), Ghulam Farid (PW6) and Manzoer Ahmed (PW7) who were ail
residents of some other houses and they were not inmates of the house
wherein the occurrence had taken place. The said eye-witnesses were, thus,

chance witnesses.”
Furthermore, the complainant in his cross examination stated that near to
the shop of his son there are other shops intervened by a house which are
being run by different people, again said that there is only one shop, and
admitted it correct that there is a shop of one Gul Muhammad and Abuzar

grocery shop, and that he was standing at a distance of 78/80 feet from the
17

shop of his son, but none of the shopkeepers was examined by the
Investigating Officer. On the application of the complainant, the
prosecution abandoned PWs Haji Shaukat son of Hazrat Gul and
Muhammad Ihtiraz Khan son of Zainullah being won over for reasons
best known to him. It is also pertinent to mention here that when father
and maternal uncle of the deceased were present at the spot and the
accused gave him kicks and fists blows, but both of them simply stated
that when the accused saw them, they fled away from the spot.

17. The nutshell of the whole discussion is that the prosecution case is
not free from doubt. It is settled principle of law that in case of doubt, the
benefit thereof must accrue in favour of the accused as matter of right and
not of grace. Reliance is placed upon the judgment rendered in Tariq
Pervez’s case (1995 SCMR 1345), wherein it was held that for giving the
benefit of doubt, it was not necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating doubts. If there is circumstance which created
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then the
accused would be entitled to the benefit of doubt not as a matter of grace
and concession but as a matter of right.

18. As a sequel to what has been discussed above, we accept this
appeal, set aside the impugned conviction recorded and sentence imposed

by the learned Additional Sessions Judge/Judge Model Criminal Trial
18
Court, Mardan, dated 20.07.2019 and the appellant is acquitted of the
charge leveled against him. He is directed to be released forthwith, if not
required in any other cause.

As the Criminal Appeal No.963-P/2019 filed by appellant Suleman,
against his conviction and sentence, has been allowed, therefore, Criminal
Revision No.182-P/2019 filed by Riaz Khan for enhancement of sentence
awarded to the appellant has become infructuous, stands dismissed.

Above are the detailed reasons of our short order of even date.
