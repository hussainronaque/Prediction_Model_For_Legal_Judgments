3. The extracts of the First Information
Report of an occurrence dated 21.4.2016 on the

lodged would reveal that the Applicant Akbar

Officer of PS Matta in respect of custody of

Ihsan-ul-Hagq, Petitioner herein, hence, FIR ibid

lodged against him.

4. Having heard arguments of learned
counsel for the parties and learned A.A.G. for
the State, record gone through with their

valuable assistance.

relied on the judgment of this Hon'ble Bench in
Cr.M_Q.P. No. _57-M/2015 titled as "Ayaz
Mohammad _yvs_the State/Pir Mohammad
Khan", 2007 MLD __1096_(Lahore)""_Ali

Nawab

6. At present complete challan under
section 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code has
been duly prepared by the Station House Officer
of PS Matta, but yet it is to be submitted before
the competent Court for the trial. The said
challan without further loss of time preferably
within 10 days from receipt of this Court order
shall be submitted to the Court having
jurisdiction in the matter so as to hold definite

outcome of the trial of this case.

7. At the moment after hearing learned
counsel for the parties, both the parties defend
the ownership on the basis of the documentary
evidence which pertains to certain agreements
and receipts of the Bargain Centers. Parties may
lead their evidence on the basis of these
documents till then it is extremely difficult to
believe either documents to be genuine and

authentic.

8. If at all the judgments of learned
Courts below remained in field, obviously the

controversy regarding the ownership, either
Nawab

party will not get a fair chance for a decisive
ownership of the vehicle in question. The
impugned judgments may also when it is feared
to bring home the charges against the accused
who has ultimately been charged for the offence
within the meaning of section 406 PPC i.e.
criminal breach of trust, which provides
punishment of either description for a term
which may extent to 7 years or with fine or

both.

9. In the meanwhile it is more
advisable as to set aside the impugned findings
in the orders which are said to be quashed. The
Flying Coach NCP Chassis No. TRH112-
0004706, Engine No. ITR-0013973, Model
2003, White Colour be parked in the premises
of the learned trial Court. The Station House
Officer of PS Matta is directed to seize this
vehicle for parking the same in the above-
referred Court premises. Copy of this judgment
be also sent to the learned Judicial

Magistrate/Illaqga Qazi Matta Swat to
honor-bound the findings contained in this

judgment.
