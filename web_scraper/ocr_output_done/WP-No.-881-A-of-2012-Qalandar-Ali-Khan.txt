QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- Faridoon and

Gulab Riaz, petitioners, have filed this writ
petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, for
declaration to the effect that order dated
20.11.2012 of the  Ex-officio Justice of
Peace/ASJ-III, Abbottabad, (respondent No.3)
is against law, facts and evidence on record,
without jurisdiction and without — lawful
authority, whereby section 302 PPC has been

3. The main grievance of the petitioners
is that the case against them was registered
under Sections 319/34 PPC vide FIR No.1045
dated 04.11.2012 in Police Station Cantt:
Abbottabad, and they had also secured Ad-
interim pre-arrest bail from the Court, but on
the application of complainant/respondent No.2,
Muhammad Parvez, the Ex-Officio Justice of
Peace directed the SHO Police Station Cantt:
to include Section 302 PPC in the FIR, which
was beyond the scope of Section 22-A Cr.PC,
thus falling outside the jurisdiction of Ex-Officio
Justice of Peace.

4. The record would show _ that
complainant/respondent, reported to the police
that his daughter, Mst Shangi, married to Gul
Riaz, petitioner No.2, about two years ago, was
driven out from his house by the latter after
subjecting her to beating and snatching away
four months old son, Faizan, from her and that
the petitioners had also forcibly taken her to
Sheikh Dhari from hospital where she was

ified to be True Copy

her health, he found her lying in semi
conscious condition with her left hand burnt,
probably, due to Physical violence by her
husband Gul Riaz (petitioner No.2), and father
in law, Faridoon (petitioner No.1). Mst Shangi
died in the hospital 0n22.10.2012, leading to
registration of the case under Section 319/234
PPC vide FIR No.1045 dated 04.11.2012, in
Police Station Cantt: Abbottabad.

5. At the very outset, the learned
Additional Advocate General submitted copies of
two charge sheets framed in the Case, one by
learned Additional Sessions Judge-IIl,
Abbottabad, on 06.04.2013, under Section 319
PPC against accused Arshad, apparently
named subsequently in the case; and the other
by learned Additional Sessions Judge-VII,
Abbottabad, on 04.06.2013, under Section
302/34 PPC against the petitioners.

6. There can be no cavil about this
Proposition that once charge is framed by the
trial Court, keeping in view facts of the case

and relevant provisions relating to framing of

Cte ww Be ren charge under Chapter No.XIX of the Criminal

Geneiviow trons Serer i mre HAS

Procedure Code 1898,the sections of law
applied in the case by the police /prosecution
at the time of registration of FIR, during
investigation and at the time of submission: of
challan , become irrelevant and of no
significance, as the trial Court enjoys discretion,
of course, within the parameters of law, to
frame charge in the light of facts and evidence
available on record, regardless of the sections
of law applied in the FIR or complete challan
« by the police/prosecution. In other words, the
uestion of application of sections of law is
rendered only academic after completion of
investigation and submission: of challan to the
Court.
7. Moreover, even the sections of law
under which an accused is charged by the trial
Court dwesubject to alteration/variation “at any
time” before judgment is pronounced, under
Section 227 Cr.PC. In any case, there would be
no justification to invoke the constitutional!

detriment of a person, bringing him within the
definition of ‘an aggrieved’ person and thus
accruing a cause of action in his favour under
Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, 1973.

8. While reiterating strict adherence to
the provisions of section 22-A Cr.PC in its letter
and spirit by the learned Justices of Peace, the
writ petition is dismissed, being not
maintainable for the forgoing reasons.
