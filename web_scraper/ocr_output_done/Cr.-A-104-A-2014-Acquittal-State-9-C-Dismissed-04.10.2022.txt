Cr. A No. 104-A/2014.

Date of hearing 04.10.2022.
Appellant/s (The State) by Sardar Ali

Raza, AAG.
Respondent absent.

FAZAL SUBHAN, J. Appellant (The State)
has filed the instant appeal under section 417
Cr. P. C against judgment and order dated:
17.03.2014 passed by learned Sessions
Judge, Haripur, in case FIR No. 13 dated:
17.01.2013 registered under section 9-C of
Control of Narcotics Substances Act, Police
Station, Kot Najibullah, District, Haripur,
whereby, accused/respondent was acquitted
from the charges levelled against him.

2. On spy information regarding
presence of proclaimed offender namely
Zamurad Khan, complainant/SHO on
07.01.2013 at 21:00 hours barricaded at
Koklian Sako. In the meanwhile, a person
having a plastic bag came from Bhedian side
on foot, who on seeing the police party tried

to decamp from the spot, but was
overpowered. Search of sack was conducted,
which resulted into recovery of six packets
of charras (total six kilogram) as well as four
packets of opium (total four kilogram). 5/5
gram samples were separated from recovered
charras and opium for sending them to FSL
for chemical analysis, while the remaining
case property was sealed into another parcel.
Murasila was prepared at the spot and sent to
the police station for registration of case.
Hence, the instant FIR.

3. After completion of investigation,
complete challan was put in Court. Provision
of section 265 (c) Cr. P.C were complied
with, thereafter, charge was framed against
the accused. In order prove its case against
respondent, prosecution examined as many
as five witnesses. After recording of
prosecution evidence, statement of accused
was recorded under section 342 Cr. P.C.
Learned trial Court after hearing of
arguments vide impugned judgment dated:
17.03.2014 acquitted the accused/respondent
from the charges levelled against him.

Appellant/The State being aggrieved from
the acquittal of accused, approached this
Court by filing instant appeal.

4. Learned Additional Advocate
General heard and record perused.

5. Prosecution in order to prove its
case examined five witnesses, who were
required to be consistent and coherent on
material aspects of the case, however, on
thorough appraisal of evidence, we found
major discrepancies in the evidence. The
alleged recovery of 6 kg charras and 4 kg
opium was made on 07.01.2013 at 21:00
hours but FIR was registered at 22:50
hours. PW-1 Shafaqat Khan ASI, in his
cross examination admitted the receipt of
murasila at 11:00 PM and chalking of FIR
within 10 minutes but surprisingly time of
registration is 22:45 hours, which does
not coincide with the time mentioned in
the FIR.

6. PW-2 constable Wali-ur-Rehman
took the sample parcels to FSL and in his
cross examination he replied that all the

parcels were containing 5/5 grams
charras. Though prosecution produced
this witness as carrier of the sample
parcels to FSL but statements of PW-4
Abdul Waheed SI/OII and PW-5 Habib
Ullah clearly show that parcels were
handed over to Muhammad Wali and not
to Wali-ur-Rehman, hence, there is
serious ambiguity as to who took the
sample parcels to the laboratory.

7. PW-3 Jehangir Khan SHO and
PW-5 Habib Ullah ASI beign the eye
witnesses of the occurrence, were
supposed to be consistent in respect of
material aspects of the case. PW jehangir
Khan in cross examination answered that
at the time of patrolling he was
accompanied by PW Habib Ullah and
other police officials but in cross
examination he admitted that he do not
remember their names. He further replied
that after recovery of narcotics he used
only one batt of 1 kg for weighment. PW
Habib Ullah on the other hand replied in

cross examination that he was not
accompanying the SHO for patrolling at
that time, and at 8:15 PM he only called
him and that they made nakabandi to
overpower the accused. That the SHO
used batts of 5 grams, 500 grams and | kg
for weighment of contraband charras and
opium. Thus, from these statements, it is
doubtful, whether at the relevant PW
Habib Ullah was present with the
SHO/complainant Jehangir Khan and
witnessed the whole occurrence coupled
with preparation of parcels and recovery
memo. The mentioning of different kinds
of batts by PW Habib Ullah fully
established that he was not present at the
time of alleged recovery and hence, was
not supporting the statement of PW
Jehangir Khan about the proceedings on
the spot.

9. Another aspect of the case is that
though PW Jehangir Khan mentioned the
recovery of 6 packets charras and 4
packets opium, each weighing | kg, but

on the request of defence counsel, the
case property was opened, and it was
observed by the trial Court that no sample
of 5 grams were separated from charras
and on weighment the charras were found
945 or 950 grams and opium 650, 995,
860 and 870 grams. Moreover, opium was
a mixture of Jaggery (05). Thus, neither
the quantity of each packet was according
to the reported quantity nor the opium
was proved to be narcotic substance. At
the same time, it is noticed that no sample
was separated from the charras as all the
alleged packets were intact, hence, strong
presumption arises that a fake and
fabricated case was foisted against the
accused.

9. Besides, the above anomalies and
contradictions, it is also noticeable that
the FSL authorities received sample
parcels after unexplained delay of 5 days,
the name of FC who took the sample
parcels to FSL is not mentioned and no
receipt was issued regarding receipt of

sample parcels. At the same time,
signature of the chemical examiner is
missing from the report, which gives the
impression of a dubious report and
rendered the same totally unreliable.

10. For all these reasons, it is held that
the learned trial Court after correctly
appreciating record has rightly discarded
the prosecution story and acquitted the
accused, which findings are
unexceptionable, hence, this appeal, being
meritless is dismissed.

Announced.
