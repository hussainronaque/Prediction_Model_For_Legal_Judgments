2. The facts of the prosecution case, in brief,
are that on 24.4.2011 at 1230 hours, complainant
Ayub Khan (PW-4) made report on the spot to
Dawaye Khan S.I (now dead) to the effect that he was
present in his house and got information that dead body
of his murdered son was lying on the spot. On this
information, the complainant rushed to the spot where he
came to know that his son Imran was selling vegetables
on the spot, the appellant came there and committed
gatl-e-amd of his son by firing at him with firearm.
Motive for the occurrence is stated to be a money
dispute between the complainant and the accused. He
charged the accused for the commission of offence. On
this report, the afore-named S.] drafted murasila and sent
the same to police station for registration of the case,
where FIR was registered by Iftikhar Khan S.1.
(PW-12). Injury sheet Ex. PM/1 and inquest report Ex.
PM/2 were also prepared by Dawaye Khan S.I.

3. After arrest of the accused and completion
of investigation, challan was submitted in Court, which
indicted the accused for commission of the offence to
which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

4. In order to prove its case, the prosecution
produced and examined twelve witnesses in all,
whereafter, accused was examined under Section 342,

Cr.P.C, wherein, he denied the allegations and professed
-3-

innocence, however, he neither opted to be examined on
oath, nor produced evidence in his defence. The learned
trial Court, after conclusion of the trial, vide impugned
judgment dated 31.01.2017, found the accused guilty of
the charge and upon conviction under Section 302(b)
PPC, sentenced him as mentioned above, which is under
challenge in the instant appeal.

5. We have heard the learned counsel for the
parties and have gone through the file from cover to
cover.

6. It is the case of prosecution that the
complainant was present in his house and received
information regarding murder of his son, whereafter he
went to the spot and came to know that his son who had
left in the moming for selling vegetables was killed by
the appellant with firearm. Firstly, we would like to refer
statement of the complainant for the reason that his
testimony touches the very roots of the case.
Complainant, while appearing as PW-4, stated before the
Court that on the day of occurrence he was present in his
house situated at Pirano Palosi, where he was informed
by his son Shoaib about the murder of his son Imran by
the appellant; he came out of his house and saw the dead
body of his deceased son brought by elders of the
locality; meanwhile, the police came to the place of

occurrence to whom he reported the matter. This
-4.

improvement, in our considered view, is unbelievable
for the reasons that had Shoaib PW-6 been present with
the deceased, why the complainant did not mention so
while lodging the report. Needless to say that
complainant did not disclose the source of information
in his report, rather he subsequently introduced that he
was informed by his son PW-6 about the occurrence,
which appears to be an embroidery work of the
complainant just to cover an unseen occurrence. The
Honourable Supreme Court, in the case of Rashid
Ahmed Vs. Muhammad Nawaz_and_others (2006
SCMR_1152), held that testimony of a witness not
mentioned in the F.I.R. but introduced subsequently has
no evidentiary value. Similarly, during cross-
examination, complainant PW-4 stated that besides his
son PW-6, one Gul Agha also informed him. If, for the
sake of arguments, this deposition is believed, then why
PW-6 or for that matter said Gul Agha did not report the
matter to the police or signed/thumb impressed the
report as rider of the same. The august Supreme Court of
Pakistan in Akhtar Ali's case (2008 SCMR-6), held that
when a witness improves his version to strengthen the
prosecution case, his improved statement subsequently
made cannot be relied upon as the witness has improved
his statement dishonestly, therefore, his credibility

becomes doubtful on the well-known principle of
-5-

criminal jurisprudence that improvements once found
deliberate and dishonest cast serious doubt on the
veracity of such witness. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in
case Farman Ahmad Vs. Muhammad Inayat_ and
others (2007 SCMR_ 1825), has laid down the dictum
about validity of statement of a witness improving his
version subsequently to strengthen the prosecution case.
The same view has been re-enforced by the apex Court

in Muhammad Saleem's case (2011 SCMR 474). Ret:

Muhammad _ Rafique_and_ others Vs. The State and
others (2010 SCMR 385), Sardar Bibi and another Vs.
Munir__Ahmed_and_others_(2017_SCMR_ 344),
Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State (2018 SCMR 772).

7. The prosecution has mainly relied upon the
testimony of Shoaib (PW-6). It is a rule of prudence that
evidence of a child witness is a delicate matter and
normally it is not safe to rely upon it unless
corroborated. Great care is to be taken that in the
evidence of a child element of coaching is not involved
for the reason that children are most untrustworthy class
of witnesses being of tender age. We have carefully
perused the statement of the alleged eyewitness Shoaib,
PW-6, who mentioned details of the occurrence. Again,
it is reiterated that had he been present on the spot, why
he did not report the matter or for that matter

signed/thumb impressed the report as rider of the same.
-6-

In cross-examination, he stated that “we used to sell the
vegetable in Palosi Adda’, if this deposition is accepted,
then what prevented the complainant to disclose that his
son Shoaib PW-6 alongwith his deceased brother Imran
used to sell vegetables in Palosi Adda and on the day of
occurrence he had accompanied his deceased brother
and had informed the complainant about the occurrence.
PW-6 further stated that as the accused armed with pistol
was after the life of their father so they followed to
prevent the danger. This witnesses further stated that he
and his deceased brother were about 20 paces away from
the accused at the time of following him, while his
brother was ahead of him (PW-6), but the postmortem
report negates the said version for the reason that the
doctor (PW-9) mentioned the entry wound on the left
side back of the chest and exit wound on the right side
(front of the chest, which was not possible as according
Y to PW-6, he and his deceased brother were following
the convict at the time of occurrence. Furthermore,
PW-9 in his cross-examination, negated the version of
PW-6, by stating that the bullet hit from medium range
which means that the same was fired from 1 to 5 feet.
While as per site plan Ex. PB, the distance between the
appellant and the deceased was 10 feet, whereas the
PW-6 stated that he and his deceased brother were about

20 paces away from the accused while following him. It
-7-

creates doubt in a prudent mind regarding the mode and
manner in which the occurrence had taken place.

8. This surprised us that till the date of
recording of evidence, none could clarify that point No.3
in the site plan was attributed to whom, as there is
nothing on the record to confirm that in-fact the un-
named witness at point No.3 was Shoaib. Our anxiety
was further increased that on whose pointation the site
plan was prepared. The later improved story ensued
from the vegetable cart in the bazaar but the place where
the cart was standing at the place where the deceased
was selling vegetable, nowhere find mention. It was a
busy bazaar and no one was examined to confirm that in
fact the occurrence took place at the time, place and in
the manner so presented. The reply to our worries is an
‘ emphatic “No”.

9. The prosecution came forward with a
motive which, in no way, attracted our attention. PW-4
put forward that few days back the accused demanded an
outstanding amount of Rs.14000/-, but he refused to pay
being penniless. In cross-examination, his explanation
took us aback where he divulged that the debt amount
was not of the accused rather owned by a person namely
Wahid, but later Wahid expired and it was his brother
who arranged the accused for the purpose. We, while

sitting in appeal, are under heavy obligation to assess by
-8-

thinking and rethinking, lest an innocent person falls a
prey to our ignorance of facts and ignorance of law. The
Court must not close its eyes to human conducts and
behaviours while deciding criminal cases, failing which
the results will be drastic and impacts will be far from
repair. In case in hand, the accused had nothing to do
with amount alleged, that too in a situation when the
person whose debt was outstanding, had already died
and this is far from believing that for such meager
amount the accused will eliminate the deceased.

10. There is no two opinion about the fact that
the cardinal principle of justice always laid emphasis on
the quality of evidence which must be of first degree and
sufficient enough to dispel the apprehension of the Court
with regard to the implication of innocent persons
alongwith guilty one by the prosecution, otherwise, the
golden principle of justice would come into play that
even a single doubt if found reasonable would be
sufficient to acquit the accused, giving him/them benefit
of doubt because bundle of doubts are not required to
extend the legal benefit to the accused. In this regard,
reliance is placed on a view held by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Riaz Masih alias Mithoo
Vs. State (NER_1995 Cr.SC_ 694) and Sardar Ali Vs.
Hameedullah and others (2019 P.Cr.L.J. 186).
-9-

11. Keeping in view the infirmities in the
prosecution case, as highlighted above, motive as
alleged, was of no avail to the prosecution.

12. For the foregoing reasons and discussion,
the conviction and sentence awarded to the appellant is
not sustainable in the eye of law, therefore, the
impugned judgment of conviction dated 31.01.2017 is
set aside and the appellant is acquitted of the charge by

extending the benefit of doubt to him.

13. Above are the reasons of our short order
