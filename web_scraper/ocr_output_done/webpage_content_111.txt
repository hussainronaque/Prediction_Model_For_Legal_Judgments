          The
learned counsel for applicants/accused contended that two challans have been submitted,
one is this for offence U/S 7, 8  and 20 of PECO of 2007 before learned
Sessions Judge, Karachi-South, and other for offence U/S 409, 420, 468, 471 PPC
before Banking Court, there is unexplained delay of about eleven months in
lodging the FIR, neither specific role has been assigned to the
applicants/accused and nor they are beneficiary. He further contended that the
alleged offence is punishable with seven years or fine or with both, hence does
not come within the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) Cr.P.C., the case has
been challaned hence the applicants/accused are no more required for further
investigation. He lastly contended that all witnesses are from Saudi Arabia hence the trial of the case will take time. In support of his arguments he relied
upon (1) 2001 P.Cr.L.J. 157, (2) 1985 2048, (3) 1996 SCMR 1132 and (4) PLD 1995
SC 34.
 
          The
learned Standing Counsel appearing for the State opposed the grant of bail and
contended that the applicant/accused have cheated the complainant and they have
failed to show enmity with the complainant for their false involvement in this
case.
 
          The
complainant also opposed the grant of bail, but he further stated that if the
bail is granted then surety amount may be fixed equal to the amount cheated by
the applicants/accused as they may not abscond after grant of bail.
 
          I have
heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the records and
case law cited by learned counsel for the applicants/accused.
 
          Admittedly,
the two challans have been submitted for two different statutes and the
punishment provided for offence U/S 7, 8 and 20 PECO of 2007 is seven years or
fine or with both which does not come within the prohibitory clause of Section
497(1) Cr.P.C. The FIR of this case has been lodged with unexplained delay of
eight months on application of complainant, received by FIA on 23.1.2009,
furthermore, the case depends upon documentary evidence which is in possession
of prosecution and there is no possibility of tampering with the same even if
the applicants/accused are granted bail. The case has been challaned and the
applicants/accused are no more required for further investigation by the
police. The points raised for grant of bail by learned counsel for the
applicants/accused are supported by case law, therefore I am in agreement with
the views taken in the above decision. The bail application is allowed and the
applicants/accused are granted bail subject to their furnishing solvent surety
in the sum of Rs.5,00,000 (Rupees five lac) each with P.R. bond in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned trial Court.
