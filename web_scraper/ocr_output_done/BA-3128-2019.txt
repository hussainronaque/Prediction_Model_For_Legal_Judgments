ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- Petitioner Manzi Gul son

of Said Nabi, seeks post arrest bail in case FIR No.49 dated

12.09.2019, registered under section 9 (c ) Control of

Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, at Police Station Jamrud,
District Khyber.

2. According to First Information Report (FIR) on

12.09.2019 at 1700 hours, Gula Jan SHO along with other

police officials named in the FIR, intercepted an Alto

~ Motorcar bearing Registration No.RIA. 486, near Attock

( Petrol Pump Takhta Baig Jamrud road. Its driver was

f deboarded who on query disclosed his name as Manzi Gul

(the petitioner). On search of the motorcar, the complainant

SHO recovered some 21 packets heroin, each weighing one
Kilogram, making the total of 21 Kilograms, from beneath
its seats and secret cavities made in its doors. From each
packet, he separated 5 grams heroin and sealed the same in
parcels as samples for chemical analysis by the FSL,

hence, this case.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record perused.
4, Before adverting to merits of the case, I deem it

appropriate to mention here that on 29.11.2019, this case
came up for hearing before a Bench graced by his
lordship Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah. During the
course of arguments, it transpired that no FSL report qua
the samples separated from the alleged recovered heroin
is available on record. After sometime, the worthy AAG
produced photocopy of the FSL report, perusal of which
revealed that the same was about “Chars” whereas in
the FIR, twenty one Kilograms heroin has been shown
recovered. In this view of the matter, the worthy AAG
was directed to ensure production of original FSL report
on the next date of hearing. In compliance with the
aforesaid order, on 09.12.2019, original FSL report was
placed on record, according to which the 21 samples
were opined to be “heroin”, however, erasure was
noticed on the FSL report whereby word “heroin” was
subsequently added by erasing the word “Chars”, but

the mischief persisted and continued to exist in the
/

.

column of “Physical examination” overleaf the said
report, wherein words “brown solid” have been
mentioned. In view of the above, the worthy Advocate
General, was put on notice to personally appear before
the Court for today. Similarly, the Director Forensic
Science Laboratory (FSL) Police Investigation Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar, was also directed to attend the
Court today.

5. The moment the case was taken up for hearing
Mr. Abbas Majeed Marwat came to the rostrum and
submitted that on his posting as Director FSL, a lot
number of pending FSL reports including the one in the
instant case, were signed by him in hurry. The FSL
report of the instant case was subsequently rectified by
him by erasing the word “Chars” and adding “heroin”.
Mr. Bilal Khan Government Analyst FSL, disagreeing
with the statement of the Director FSL, stuck to his
earlier report according to which all the 21 samples have
been opined to be “Chars”. He added that the police
official had dispatched the samples of chars for analysis,

which were subjected to chemical test and were opined

/
f as “chars”. While shifting responsibility on the police, he

denied the erasure and rectification in the FSL report.
6. The worthy Advocate General present in the
court when confronted with the contradictory stances of

the above officials/Officers of the FSL and tampered
FSL report, he submitted that an inquiry has already
been initiated in the matter which is yet to be finalized.

7. Be that as it may, it appears from record that
petitioner has been arrested red handed at the spot and
huge quantity of heroin weighing 21 Kilograms has been
shown recovered from the vehicle which was in his
exclusive possession and control. Factum of recovery of
heroin find mention in the Murasila, FIR and recovery
memo. Similarly, the version of the Seizing Officer is
corroborated by witnesses of the recovery proceedings in
their statements recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C.
Thus, in presence of the ocular account of the Seizing
Officer and witnesses to the recovery memo, mere
contradictory FSL report which definitely seems to have
been intentionally manipulated for some extraneous
consideration and inquiry in this regard is in progress,
would not be sufficient to entitle the petitioner for bail at
this stage.

8. Resultantly, this petition being meritless is
hereby dismissed.

9. Before parting with the order, I would add that
this Court has taken serious notice of the detestable
game played by the concerned/responsible officials of
the Police and the FSL, Peshawar in the case of a huge
quantity of 21 Kilograms heroin, which smells and

indicates towards the intentional extra ordinary
concession extended to the accused/narcotic dealer,
probably in lieu of monetary gain, but till date no
punitive action has been taken against the delinquent
official(s) by the competent authority of the concerned
departments, which is highly deplorable and speaks
about their irresponsibility. As per statement of the
worthy Advocate General made at the bar, an inquiry in
the matter is in progress, but on one hand, the said
inquiry has been initiated when the negligence was
pinpointed by this Court, while on the other hand, not a
single official either from the Police Department or from
the FSL has been suspended till date what to speak of
their dismissal. If such purpose and _ intentional
negligence/acts are not dealt with an iron hand, the
traffickers of the narcotics would easily succeed in their
acquittal and the menace of narcotics will shatter the
entire fabric of society. This is not the first time, rather,
on different occasions this Court has informed High-ups
of the Police Department with regard to the poor and
deplorable conduct of the Seizing and Investigating

; / Officers in narcotic cases, but at that end yet no heed has
been paid. In this case, it is expected that the officials
involved in the case shall be taken to the task by settling
an example in the Police Department.

10. Copy of this order along with copy of FSL

report be sent to the worthy Inspector General Police
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar, for taking necessary
action under the relevant law as well as the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Government Servants (Efficiency and
Discipline) Rules, against the delinquents under
intimation to this Court through the Additional Registrar
(Judicial).

11. Needless to mention that this order is only for
disposal of the instant bail application which shall not

prejudice the mind of the learned trial Court during trial.
