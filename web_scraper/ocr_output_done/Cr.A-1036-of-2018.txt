AHMAD ALI, J. Through this appeal
under section 417 (2-A), the appellant
has impugned the judgment dated
19.09.2018, whereby the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-II,
Nowshera, has acquitted the respondent
(Said Nawab) from the charges levelled
against him under section 302 PPC, in
case FIR No.58 dated 02.03.2017,
registered at Police Station Akbar Pura

(District Nowshera).

2. Brief facts of the case, as per
prosecution, are that the complainant
Jabir Ullah, has reported the matter to
the local police in terms that his
daughter Mst. Saleem Akhtar wife of

Said Nawab (respondent herein)

resident of Bajawar presently Mohallah
Saidan Akbar Pura, was residing in his
house, who was abducted by accused-
respondent for marriage some one year
ago but the report was not lodged as
compromise between the parties was
effected and the accused-respondent
and deceased Mst. Saleem Akhtar were
residing in his house. The appellant
was working in Abid Flour Mills, when
reached the house, the room adjacent
when opened, there he found the dead
body of her daughter Mst. Saleem
Akhtar lying on bed and upon her
body, no injury was found. Cause of
death was also not known to the
complainant/present appellant. Hence,
the FIR ibid was registered by the
prosecution.

3. On completion of investigation,
challan was submitted in Court, which
indicted the present respondent for the
crime to which he pleaded not guilty

and claimed trial. Prosecution in order

to prove its case, examined 07 witnesses
in all, whereafter statement of the accused
was recorded, wherein, he professed his
innocence. The learned Trial Court,
after conclusion of trial, acquitted the
respondent-accused of the charge
levelled against him vide judgment
impugned herein whereagainst the
appellant has filed the instant appeal.

4. We have given our anxious
consideration to the submissions made
by the learned counsel for the appellant
and perused the record with his able

assistance.

5. It is an unseen occurrence and
the complainant/PW1 while charging
the present accused-respondent in the
instant case stated that he is a
watchman at the flour mill. He left the
house after taking a meal for the duty,
and saw his son-in-law, proceeding
inside the room. On the next morning
when he returned, observed that the

door of the said room is still closed. He

entered the room of his daughter and
found her dead, whereas the accused
was missing. In cross-examination, the
complainant stated that after taking
dinner he left at 06:00 pm, and when he
returned at 8:00 am next morning
found the outer door locked. Inmates of
the house heard hue and cry last night
from daughter’s room. The
complainant has allegedly himself
opened the door, deceased was on his
bed, when quilt was removed, she was
found dead. Astonishingly, no lady
from the inmates of the house entered
the room for query. The complainant
stated that as the accused-respondent
disappeared after the occurrence, so he
guessed that the respondent
administered poison to his daughter.
The complainant is not an eye witness
to the occurrence nor he has noticed the
accused-respondent while administering
any poisonous substance to his

daughter.

6. PW-2 who is witness to the
recovery memo for blood-stained
garments and samples from _ the
deceased, negating the stance of
complainant, who earlier stated that
there was no injury on the body of
deceased. PW2 is also not an eye

witness to the occurrence.

7. Postmortem report of deceased
show the time of death and
examination as 06-12 hours. If the time
in between is considered as 12 hours it
favour the accused-respondent, as the
same goes to 09 pm and if the poison is
administered may have taken 01 to 03
hours, 6 pm approximately, the time
when the complainant left the house.
Question is why the  accused-
respondent did not left the house at that
very time after administering poison to
the deceased and why inmates of the
house did not notice the same. Silence
of the inmates of the house also creates

doubts and suggests that the occurrence

has not taken place in the mode and
manner as alleged by the complainant.
PW-3 arrested the accused-respondent,
however, he has neither recovered any
incriminating articles from him nor
anything on his pointation was ever
recovered. PW-4 is the 2™ wife of
complainant, who in her cross-
examination stated that the deceased is
her real daughter and that she is not an
eye witness to the occurrence.
According to her, the complainant went
to the room of the deceased for
awaking her. It is not appealable to a
prudent mind that in the presence of
children and other inmates of the
house, a father proceeds to awake her
married daughter. She further deposed
that the door was not locked. It was
PW-6 who informed the complainant
after gaining knowledge from FSL
report that the deceased was
administered poison and then the

complainant charged the present

accused-respondent for the murder of

deceased Mst. Saleem Akhtar.

8. Scrupulous perusal of record
reveals that the ocular evidence in the
instant case is based on the statements
of complainant/PW1 and PW-4 his
wife, who were examined in the case,
respectively, but their testimonies were
not consistent, trustworthy and
confidence-inspiring. Moreover, there
are glaring contradictions in their
statements, which proves that
occurrence has not taken place in the
mood, manner, time and place as

alleged by the prosecution.

9. In view of non-recovery of any
incriminating substance from the place
of occurrence as well as from the
accused, proves that the occurrence had
not taken place in the mood and
manner as alleged by the prosecution.

10. As stated above the witnesses
produced by the prosecution were

either not telling the truth or trying to

suppress the actual truth before the
court, therefore, the testimony cannot
be relied upon. A witness who lied
about any material fact must be
disbelieved as to all facts. ‘Falsus in
uno, falsus in omnibus’ is a Latin
phrase meaning “false in one thing,
false in everything”. The rule held that
a witness who lied about any material
fact must be disbelieved as to all facts
because of the reason that the
“presumption that the witness will
declare the truth ceases as soon as it
manifestly appears that he is capable of
perjury” and that “Faith in a witness’s
testimony cannot be partial or factional.
Guidance could be placed on “PLJ
2019 SC (Criminal Cases) 265”.

11. This view stems from the notion
that once a witness is found to have lied
about a material aspect of a case, it
cannot then be safely assumed that said
witness will declare the truth about any

other aspect of the case. Maxim has not

been accepted by superior Courts in
Pakistan. It has been held by the august
Supreme Court of Pakistan that job of a
judge is to discover truth. A Court of
law cannot permit something which law
expressly forbids with all due respect,
we feel that such an approach, which
involves extraneous and __ practical
considerations, is arbitrary besides,
being subjective and same can have
drastic consequences for rule of law
and dispensation of justice in criminal
matters. When a witness has been
found false with regard to the
implication of one accused about whose
participation he had deposed on oath
credibility of such witness regarding
involvement of other accused in the
same occurrence would be irretrievably
shaken. Afore-discussed main rule shall
suffer serious change if an when it is
examined in light of Islamic Principles.
The Holy Qur’an deals with matter and

it can be seen that giving testimony its

due importance and weight is an
obligatory duty and those who stand
firm in their testimonies are among
people of righteousness and faith.
According to the corpus of traditions of
Holy Prophet (PBUH), false testimony
is one of greatest sins, offence of Qazf,
which has been defined. It can be seen
that Holy Qur’an puts a great emphasis
upon need to meet requisite standard of
evidence, so much so, that for a person
levelling allegation but not meeting
given standard, it not only provides for
a penal punishment, but also for
withdrawal of such a person’s civic
right to give evidence in all matters of
his life. A court of law cannot grant a
license to a witness to tell lies or to mix
truth with falsehood and then take it
upon itself to sift grain from chaff when
law of land makes perjury are testifying
falsely a culpable offence.

12. So in the light of above-

mentioned judgment of the Apex

Court, the testimony of complainant
could not be relied upon and uncalled-
for.

13. The learned Trial Court has fully
appreciated the case evidence both,
ocular and circumstantial, in its true
perspective and, while keeping in view,
contradictions in the statements of the
PWs on certain material points
including place of occurrence has
rightly concluded qua acquittal of the
respondents from the charge levelled
against them. On re-appraisal of case
evidence, there is no room _ for
interference by this Court in the

impugned judgment.

14. In addition, before us is an
appeal against acquittal where standard
for appreciation of evidence is different
than the one in appeal against
conviction, as once an accused is
acquitted, then he earns double
presumption of his innocence, which

cannot be taken away from him unless

it is shown that the judgment of
acquittal is based on surmises or
presumptions, which is not the case

here.

15. In view of the above discussion,
this appeal, being bereft of any merit, is
hereby dismissed in limine.
