under section 12 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Consumer

Protection Act, 1997, on the grounds that the entire deal
op)

was struck and amount was paid at Gujraanwala, where the

application by filing reply thereto. ‘Vhe learned Consumer
Court, Haripur after hearing the partics, returned the
complaint for lack of territorial jurisdiction vide order
dated 09.04.2018.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties
heard and record perused.

5. In view of admitted factual background, it
has to be seen whether Consumer Court, at Haripur has the
jurisdiction to entertain the complaint of the appellant
against. the respondents or otherwise. The governing
provisions relating to jurisdiction of Consumer Court to
entertain complaint has been provided under Section 12 of
the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Consumer Protection Act, 1997,
which is reproduced below for ready reference and

convenience:-

12. Jurisdiction of the [Court].---[Subject to
the provisions of this Act, the Court shall have
jurisdiction to entertain complaints within the
local limits of whose jurisdiction,---|

(a) the opposite party or each of the opposite
parties, where there are more than one, at the
time of the institution of the complaint,
actually and voluntarily resides or carries on
business or personally works for gain; or

(b) any of the opposite partics, where there
are more than one, at the time of the
institution of the compliant, actually and
voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or
personally works for gain provided that in
such ease cither the permission of the |Court}

is given, or the opposite partics who do not
reside, or carry on business, or personally
work for gain, as the case may be, acquiesce in
such institution; and

(c)the cause of action wholly or in_ part
arises."

6. The appellant has three options under the said
provisions to sue; where the respondents or cach of the
respondents actually and voluntarily resides, carries on
business or personally works for gain (clause a); or, in case
there are more than one respondents, at the time of the
institution of complaint actually or voluntarily, carries on
business or personally works for gain (clause ‘b’); or, at
the place where the cause of action, wholly or in part,
arises (clause ‘c’). If the situation in a particular case is not
covered by clauses (a) and (b), the suit can be ination’ by
virtue of clause (c), at the place where cause of action
wholly or in part, arises.

7. This Court finds that the deal had taken
place between the parties through representative of the
respondents at Haripur and payment of the amount was
also made over there and the sced was also sowed at
Haripur and the Seed Certification Officer also conducted
inspection of the crops at Haripur and submitted his report
regarding the seed provided by the respondents. ‘Thus, in

view of the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present
an

case, the cause of action arose to the appellant under clause
‘© of the Act ibid, at Haripur. Therefore, it is very much
obvious that the learned consumer Court has the territorial
jurisdiction to entertain complaint of the appellant against
the respondents and the impugned order of the learned
Consumer Court being without legal substance is liable to
be reversed.
8. Accordingly, for the reasons stated hereinabove,
this appeal is allowed and the impugned order of the
learned Consumer Court, Haripur dated 09.04.2018 is set
aside and the case is remanded back to the learned
Consumer Court to proceed with the complaint filed by the
appellant, strictly in accordance with law.
