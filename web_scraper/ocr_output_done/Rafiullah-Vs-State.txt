JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- At a trial

held by learned Trial Court/ Sessions Judge, Hangu,
appellant Rafiullah, having been found guilty of offence to
commit qatl-i-amd of Mst. Imraj Bibi, has been convicted
under section 324 PPC and sentenced to undergo
imprisonment for five years and to pay a fine of
Rs.1,00,000/- or in default thereof to undergo 06 months
S.I. further, vide judgment dated 23.07.2015. Benefit of
S.382-B Cr.P.C. has been extended to him.

2. Through the instant appeal, the appellant has
questioned has conviction and sentence while injured
Mst. Imraj Bibi, through connected Cr.R. No.101-P/2015,
seeks enhancement of sentence of the convict/ respondent
as provided under the law. Since, both the matters are the
outcome of one and the same judgment of the learned Trial

Court, therefore, this single judgment shall govern both.

3. The prosecution case is that on 26.03.2014 at
1820 hours, appellant-convict alongwith co-accused, duly
armed with firearms entered the house of complainant
Mst. Dilbar Jana, forced her daughter Mst. Imraj Bibi to go
with them and on her refusal, opened fire at her with the
intention to commit her murder, as a result, she got hit and
injured. In addition to complainant and injured, the
incident is stated to have been witnessed by Mst. Rafeeda
Bibi. Refusal of the hand of Mst. Imraj Bibi in marriage for
the appellant-convict has been advanced as motive behind
the incident.

4. At the very outset, while going through the
impugned judgment, it seems very strange that the learned
Trial Court despite holding the appellant guilty of the
offence under section 324 PPC and convicting him
thereunder, did not inflict any punishment upon him for the
injuries caused by injured Mst. Imraj Bibi, so much so that
the appellant has not been confronted with specific charge
of the injuries caused to injured. The language of S.324
PPC is clear and unambiguous which not only provides
punishment for the act of attempt to commit qatl-i-amd but
also held liable the offender to the punishment provided for

the hurt caused in addition to the punishment for attempt to

commit murder. For convenience Section 324 PPC is

reproduce below:-
“Attempt to commit qatl-i-amd:- Whoever
does any act with such intention or
knowledge, and under such circumstances,
that, if he by that act caused qatl, he would
be guilty of qatl-i-amd, shall be punished
with imprisonment of either description for a
term which may extend to ten years [but shall
not be less than five years, if the offence has
been committed in the name or on the pretext

of honour], and shall also be liable to fine,

and, if hurt is caused to any person by such
act, the offender shall [in addition to the

imprisonment _and_fine_as_ aforesaid] be

liable_to_the punishment provided for _the

hurt caused”.
5. The words “the offender shall in addition
to the imprisonment and fine as aforesaid be liable to
the punishment provided for the hurt caused” make the
punishment for the hurt caused as mandatory. When
confronted with the above situation, learned counsel for
the parties and learned AAG fairly and frankly conceded

that the case be remanded to the learned Trial Court for

trial de novo after correction formulation of charge.
However, learned counsel for the appellant/convict
stressed for release of the appellant-convict on bail on the
ground he is behind the bars from the last two years.
Learned counsel for the complainant and learned AAG
opposed release of the appellant on bail, however,
requested for issuance of direction to the learned Trial
Court for expeditious conclusion of the trial.

6. In view of the above, the impugned
judgment dated 23.07.2015, is set aside and the case is
remanded to the learned Trial Court for trial denovo, right
from the stage of framing of charge. The learned Trial
Court shall conclude the trial as early as possible, but not
later than two months from the date of receipt of the record
and shall proceed with the case on day to day basis. In case
of adjournment on cogent and reasonable ground, its
period shall not exceed three days. Office is directed to
send the record to the learned Trial Court within two days,
without fail. On setting aside the impugned judgment,
connected Cr.R. No.101-P/2015, titled, “Mst. Imraj Bibi
Vs Rafi Ullah etc” has become infructuous, which stands
dismissed as such.
