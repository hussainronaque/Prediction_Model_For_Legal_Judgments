ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- This single judgment shall

dispose of Criminal Appeal No. 216-M/2018 filed by

appellant Abdul Qayum son of Amir Khan against his

conviction and sentence and Criminal Revision No.50-

M/2018 filed by petitioner Mst. Rabia Bibi against Abdul

Qayum (accused-respondent) for enhancement of his

sentence, as both are the offshoots of the same impugned

judgment dated 05.09.2018 rendered by the learned

Additional Sessions Judge/IZQ, Dir (Upper) at Wari, in

case FIR No.293 dated 11.07.2017 under sections-
354/376/511 PPC registered at Police Station Wari,

District Dir (Upper), whereby the appellant was convicted

under section-511 PPC and sentenced to ten years rigorous

imprisonment with a fine of Rs.200,000/- or in default of

payment of fine, he shall suffer further six months S.I. The

appellant was also convicted under section-354 PPC and

was sentenced to two years Rigorous Imprisonment. Both

the substantive sentences were ordered to run concurrently.

Benefit of section-382-B Cr.PC was extended to the

appellant.

2. Precise facts of the prosecution case are that on

03.07.2017 Mst. Rabia Bibi (complainant) submitted a

written application/complaint to DSP Circle Wari against

Qayum Khan son of Amir Khan (her real father), wherein

the complainant averred that her father has made several

attempts to commit rape upon her; that on 11.06.2017 at

12.00 hours her father had attempted again to rape her but

due to her resistance the string of her shalwar/trouser was

torn and got half nacked; that due to her hue and cries, her

mother and other neighbors came to the place of

occurrence and the accused decamped from the scene. The
DSP referred the complaint to the SHO for necessary

action, who further referred the matter to Muhammad

Afzal HC for conducting proper inquiry and proceedings in

accordance with law. After conducting inquiry, the inquiry

report was submitted and the present case FIR was

registered against the convict-appellant, who was arrested

in the case and after conducting investigation, he was sent

to Judicial Lockup.

3. After completion of investigation, complete challan

was put in Court. Formal charge was framed against the

accused to which he did not plead guilty and claimed trial.

4. In order to prove its case, the prosecution examined

as many as six (06) PWs. Rahim Baig SHO (PW-1)

registered case FIR against the accused and after

completion of investigation submitted complete challan in

the case. Mst. Rabia, the complainant (PW-2) reiterated

the same facts mentioned in the complaint. Mst. Bibi

Nishta, (the mother of complainant and wife of

accused), appeared before the Court and her statement was

recorded as (PW-3), and supported the version of the

complainant. Riaz Khan SI (PW-4) deposed that after
registration of case FIR, the investigation was entrusted to

him. He raided the house of the accused, but he was not

present in the house, prepared the house search memo (EX

PW 4/1), vide applications (EX PW 4/2 & EX PW 4/3)

obtained warrant under section 204 Cr.PC and

proclamation notices u/s 87 Cr.PC respectively and

entrusted the same to the DFC for execution. On

20.07.2017 the accused was arrested by Wazir Muhammad

ASI and he vide application (EX PW 4/4) produced the

accused before the Court and obtained his police custody

for three days, he interrogated the accused, recorded

statements of the PWs as well as accused u/s-161 Cr.PC

and after completion of investigation, handed over the case

file to the SHO for onward submission. Afzal Khan IHC

(PW-5) deposed that he prepared the site plan (EX PW

5/1) at the instance of complainant and eye witnesses,

recorded statement of the complainant and eye witnesses

under section-161 Cr.PC. On 11.07.2017 he vide

application (EX PW 5/2) produced the complainant and

Mst. Bibi Nishta before the Court of Judicial Magistrate

Wari, for recording their statements under section-164
Cr.PC and as such their statements were recorded. He vide

application (EX PW 5/3) obtained the opinion of the APP.

Shah Faisal Khan SI (PW-6) deposed that in light of the

opinion of the learned APP (EX PW 5/3) drafted murasila

(EX PW 6/1) and sent to police station for registration of

case FIR against the accused.

5. After closure of prosecution evidence, statement of

accused was recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C wherein

he negated the prosecution story. He professed innocence

and alleged false involvement in the present case.

However, he neither wished to be examined on Oath

within the meaning of Section 340(2) Cr.P.C nor desired to

produce evidence in his defence.

6. On completion of trial, after hearing the arguments

of the learned counsel for the parties and appraising of

evidence on the file, the learned Additional Sessions

Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi, Dir (Upper) at Wari, vide impugned

judgment dated 05.09.2018, convicted the appellant Abdul

Qayyum and sentenced him as mentioned herein above.

Feeling aggrieved from his conviction and sentence, the
appellant has approached this Court by filing the instant

appeal.

7. Valuable arguments of learned counsel for the

parties heard and available record gone through.

8. Before adverting to the merits of the case, the issue

before this Court is to see as to whether the charges of

attempt to rape and outraging modesty of a women has

been brought home by the prosecution and the appellant

has been rightly convicted and sentenced for the offences

under sections-354 PPC as well as 376/511 PPC.

9. The question whether a certain act is merely a

preparation or is committed in the course of attempt is a

question of fact and that is to be seen in light of the

evidence produced by the prosecution. No hard and fast

rule can be laid down to define attempt. More so, the word

attempt has not been defined in the Pakistan Penal Code.

Attempt is the direct movement towards the commission

after the preparation has been made and it must be

something more than mere preparation. It is sufficient that

if there is present an intent with some overt act in

execution thereof for the purpose of criminal liability, if
the attempt had gone so far that the crime would have been

completed but for extraneous intention, which frustrated its

consummation. In case of Abdul Majid..vs..The State

(1973 SCMR-108), wherein it was held that;

“i. The intent to commit the crime.

ii. Performance of some act towards the
commission of the crime, and

iii. Failure to consummate its commission on
account of the circumstances beyond the
control of the offender.”

10. Facts of the present case are that complainant Mst.

Bibi Rabia (PW-2) is the real daughter of the appellant.

She has categorically charged her real father for attempt to

commit rape upon her and in this respect she has also

stated in her Court statement that her trouser was also

removed by the appellant, after raising hue and cries, and

upon the arrival of Mst. Bibi Nishta (mother of

complainant) (PW-3) the appellant made his escape good

from the scene of occurrence. The statements of the

complainant (PW-2) and her mother (PW-4) are

unanimous on all material points and nothing has been

brought on record to tarnish their credibility. They have
been extensively cross examined but nothing was elicited

from them which could benefit the appellant.

11. The contention of the learned for the appellant that

there is inordinate delay in reporting the matter, is

inconsequential in the circumstances of the case and the

nature of offence, where charge is being brought by the

daughter against her real father. More so in cases of alike

nature delay by itself alone would not be sufficient to

discard the case of prosecution. From the above mentioned

discussion it is eminently clear that the charge has been

brought home by the prosecution against the appellant and

he has been rightly held guilty by the learned trial Court,

however the question of quantum of sentence needs

interference by this Court for the reasons being discussed

in the subsequent paragraph.

12. The complainant has also filed Criminal Revision

No.50-M/2018 for enhancement of sentence and prayed for

revisiting the sentence and enhancing the same to half of

the maximum sentence (imprisonment for life) i.e 12 years

and 06 months. The learned trial court has already awarded
ten years sentence to the appellant. For convenience, the
contents of section-376(1) PPC is reproduced as under;

“376 PPC Punishment for rape.
(1) Whoever commits rape shall be punished

with death or imprisonment for either

description for_a term which shall not be less

than _ten years or more than twenty five years

and shall also be liable to fine.”
(emphasis provided)
Section-376(1) PPC provides for three alternate
punishment i.e death, imprisonment for life and also ten
years. This Court will not subscribe to the contention of
the learned counsel for the complainant/petitioner in
Criminal Revision that the punishment shall not be less
than half of 25 years as prayed in the Revision that the
sentence be enhanced to twelve years and six months for
the reason that section-511 PPC provides imprisonment of
any description for the offence for a term which may
extend to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment.
For convenience, the provision of section-511 PPC is

reproduced as under;

“S11 PPC. Punishment for attempting to commit
offences punishable_with imprisonment for life or_a

shorter terms.

Whoever attempts to commit an offence punishable by
this Code with imprisonment for life or imprisonment,
10

or to cause such an offence to be committed, and in
such attempt does any act towards the commission of
the offence, shall, where no express provision is made
by this Code for the punishment of such attempt, be
punished with imprisonment of any description

provided for the offence, for_a term which MAY

extend to one-half of the longest _term

imprisonment provided for that offence, or with such
fine (daman) as is provided for the offence, or with.

(Emphasis provided)

13. The plain reading of Section-511 PPC provides

maximum sentence, which may extend to one-half of the

longest term of imprisonment. The word may clearly
manifest the intention of legislature that this is for the
Court to award appropriate punishment which may extend
to one half of the imprisonment provided. In other words
the maximum thrash hold has been laid down in section-
511 PPC, but the minimum limit has not been prescribed
rather the same has been left to the discretion of the Court
by considering the facts and circumstances of the case.

14. Record reveals that there are some negligible and
minor inconsistencies, which would not be sufficient
enough to discard the entire prosecution case, but the same
can be considered as mitigating circumstances while
deciding the quantum of sentence. More so, litigation is

also pending adjudication before the Family Court between
11
the appellant, Mst. Bibi Nishta (wife) and complainant
Mst. Bibi Rabia, (daughter) of appellant. Reliance is
placed on the judgments rendered by the Apex Court in
Ansar Ahmad Khan Barki’s case (1993 SCMR 1660) and
Falak Sher’s case (NLR 2000 Criminal 188), wherein it
was held that;

“Inconsistencies of a minor dimension in
prosecution evidence throw up doubts about
prosecution version but do not qualify for
acquittal. They present merely a mitigating
circumstance capable of affecting no more
than quantum of _ sentence. Such
inconsistencies may create dilution of
prosecution version but not its complete
negation.”

15. In view of the above, this Criminal Appeal is partly
allowed, the conviction of the appellant under section-354
PPC is maintained while his conviction under section-511
PPC is reduced from ten years to five years, would meet
the ends of justice in circumstances of the case. The
amount of fine of Rs.200,000/- is also reduced to
Rs.50,000/- or in default to suffer three months S.I. All the
substantive sentences shall run concurrently. Benefit under
section-382-B Cr.PC has already been extended by the trial

Court.
12

16. As the Criminal Appeal filed by the convict-
appellant has partly been allowed and the sentence
awarded to him under section-511 PPC has been reduced
to five years, therefore, the Criminal Revision No.50-
M/2018 filed by Mst. Rabia Bibi for enhancement of
sentence has become infructuous, stands dismissed. The
office is directed to remit the present appeal alongwith the
record to Mingora Bench, at the earliest.
