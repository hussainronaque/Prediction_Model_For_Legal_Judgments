2. The prosecution story as disclosed in the
FIR, registered on the basis of murasila, in brief, is
that on 21.8.2017 at 15:05 hours, Muhammad Farhan
Tariq (the appellant), while accompanying the dead
body of Alamzeb son of Aurangzeb, reported the
matter to the local police at emergency room of civil
hospital, D.I-Khan, to the effect that on the fateful
day, he alongwith said Aurangzeb, while riding on a
motorbike were coming from “Bandh” of Indus River
and at about 2:25 PM, when they reached to a
thoroughfare situated within limits of Chah Piyare

Wala, meanwhile, two persons riding on a motorcycle
-3-
CG-125 came behind and started firing, as a result
whereof, he sustained injury on his left arm, while his
companion Alamzeb died on the spot. He stated that if
brought before him, he could identify the assailants,
however, no motive was disclosed in the report.
Besides him, the occurrence was stated to be
witnessed by other people present on the spot. He
charged unknown accused for the commission of
offence.

3. It is pertinent to mention that on
23.8.2017, father of the deceased recorded his
statement under Section 164, Cr.P.C. before the Court
of Judicial Magistrate, Paharpur/MOD, where he
charged the appellant for commission of the offence
and introduced one Munir Ahmad son of Bashir
Ahmad, Caste Awan, resident of Thoya Siyal to have
witnessed the occurrence. In view of the above
statement, the appellant was arrayed as an accused.
On 19.9.2017, statement of afore-named Munir
Ahmad was recorded under Section 164, Cr.P.C.
where he narrated quite different story of the incident
contrary to the story mentioned by the accused in the

initial report.
-4-
4. On completion of the investigation,
complete challan against the accused was submitted
before the learned trial Court where at the
commencement of trial, the prosecution produced and
examined as many as sixteen (16) witnesses,
whereafter, statement of the accused under section
342 Cr.P.C, was recorded wherein he professed
innocence and false implication, however, he did not
wish to be examined under section 340(2) Cr.P.C, but
opted to produce ward record, record of the hospital as
well as the discharge slip issued by the surgical ward,
which the accused had placed on file alongwith his
application for summoning the clerk of DHQ
Hospital, D.J.Khan, in which respect Samiullah MLC
Clerk was examined as DW-1, who produced relevant
record as Ex. DW 1/1 and Ex.D-1. On conclusion of
trial, the learned trial after hearing arguments,
convicted the appellant and sentenced him, as
mentioned in the earlier part of the judgment, which
has been assailed by the appellant through the instant
criminal appeal, whereas the connected criminal

revision has been filed for enhancement of sentence.
-5-
4. We have heard the learned counsel
representing the appellant, the learned State Counsel
assisted by learned private counsel at length and with
their valuable assistance, the record was gone through.
5. In the present case, two stories in respect
of the incident have been introduced. Firstly, the
matter was reported by the accused/appellant
himself by stating that on the eventful day, he
alongwith the deceased, while riding on a motorbike
were coming from “Bandh” of Indus River and at
about 2:25 PM, when they reached on a thoroughfare
situated within limits of Chah Piyare Wala,
meanwhile, two persons riding on a motorcycle CG-
125 came behind and started firing, as a result
whereof, he sustained injury on his left arm, while his
companion Alamzeb died on the spot. Second story of
the incident was introduced by father of the deceased
(PW-4), who on 23.8.2017, recorded his statement
under Section 164, Cr.P.C. before the Court of
Judicial Magistrate, Paharpur/MOD, where he charged
the appellant for the commission of offence and stated
that one Munir Ahmad (PW-7) had seen the

occurrence. While going through the record and
-6-
evidence on file, we did not come across any
independent evidence of unimpeachable nature in
support of the story narrated by the accused, however,
in view of second version of the incident, we would
like to refer the statements of Aurangzeb, father of the
deceased, and Munir Ahmad (maternal uncle of the
deceased), who were examined as PW-4 & PW-7,
respectively. Deceased was son of PW-4 and on
21.8.2017, PW-4 was at his job station, when he
received information that his son was taken to the
hospital, upon which he reached there and found his
son lying dead. PW-4 stated that in the next morning,
PW-7 informed him that he had seen the accused
while killing his son by firing, so he alongwith PW-7
visited police station Cantt: where he charged the
accused. He was produced by the local police before
the Court of Judicial Magistrate, where his statement
under section 164, Cr.P.C. was recorded. PW-4
further stated that the Investigating Officer had visited
his house where statements of his wife and daughters
were recorded. During course of investigation, PW-4
presented to the Investigating Officer letters from the

accused to the deceased and his wife containing
-7-
threatening material alongwith one live round of .30
bore. However, in cross-examination, he admitted that
he was not the eyewitness of the occurrence. He stated
that PW Munir Ahmad was his relative. Munir Ahmad
was examined as PW-7, who stated that he was
motorcycle mechanic by profession and was running
his shop at Fuwara Chowk D.I.Khan; that his daughter
Hadia Tabasum was studying in Education Zoom
Academy and he used to pick and drop her on his
motorbike from his house to the academy; that on the
day of occurrence at about 2:15 hours, he left his shop
to pick up his daughter from his house; that at about
2:20 PM, when he was passing through the marginal
Band in front of street leading to Chah Piyara Wala,
he noticed that accused Farhan Tariq was holding his
pistol aimed at the deceased, while the motorcycle
belonging to the deceased was parked nearby. He
stated that as he was attempting to stop there, he saw
that accused fired at the deceased with his pistol
which hit the deceased who after receiving the injury
fell to the ground, he shouted at the accused ‘Yeh Kia
Kya’ upon which the accused aimed his pistol at him

and due to fear he moved his motorcycle ahead to
-8-
save himself, and then heard another shot considering
it to have been fired at him, he accelerated speed of
his motorcycle and instead of going to his house, he
went to the house of his friend namely Muhammad
Hafeez, situated in Mohallah Khakwani, D.I.Khan
City. He further stated that due to anxiety and fear, he
remained at the house of his friend until late at night,
whereafter, he returned to his house and slept under
great stress; that in the next morning, he went to the
house of father of the deceased and narrated the
incident, upon which father of the deceased contacted
police on phone who was directed to visit police
station alongwith him; that he narrated the above facts
to the police officer who recorded his statement.
During spot inspection, PW-7 pointed out the spot to
the Investigating Officer. During cross examination,
he admitted that the deceased was his sister’s son and
his house is situated in village Thoya Siyal close to
the road of Marginal Band. He admitted that while
going to his house a road leads from Shobra Chowk
through Met Office commonly known as Mosmiat
Office, however, he self stated that another road

through Kachi Paind Khan and Marginal Band also
-9-
leads to his house. He voluntarily stated that on the
day of occurrence he had taken the Marginal Band
Road. He also admitted it correct that on the way from
Marginal Band to the house of his friend Hafeez, there
are number of check posts where police remained
present. He admitted that there is also a police post at
the entrance of Muslim Bazaar, however, he did not
stop nor disclose anything to police official of said
post. He stated that he did not return to his workshop.
He did not disclose the fact of having seen the
occurrence to anyone until next morning. He also did
not even disclose the same to anybody in the house of
Hafeez Khakwani, self stated, that he was under
severe fear, therefore, did not talk to anyone about the
occurrence until next morning. He also did not inform
anybody on telephone or mobile about the occurrence.
In view of statement of PW-7, Muhammad Hafeez
Khakwani was the best evidence to corroborate his
testimony, but he was not cited as witness in the
calendar of witnesses, as admitted by the Investigating
Officer (PW-10) in his cross examination. Needless to
mention that story of the incident was allegedly told to

PW-4 by PW-7 and in order to corroborate his
-10-
testimony, Muhammad Hafeez Khakwani was never
associated with the investigation nor was examined
before the Court to ascertain the fact that after the
occurrence, he spent a night at the house of his friend
Muhammad Hafeez Khakwani.

7. In addition to the above, the case was
investigated by Inamullah Khan Inspector, who was
examined as PW-10. During the spot inspection he
prepared site plan Ex. PB at his own observation. He
secured blood through cotton from the place of the
deceased. He took into possession two freshly
discharged empty shells of .30 bore lying in the street
at the crime scene. He also took into possession a
motorcycle belonging to the deceased, one J-5
Samsung mobile set belonging to the accused. He also
detected a .30 bore pistol alongwith fit magazine
having two live rounds, lying at a garbage heap in a
vacant plot belonging to one Qadir, which on
checking was suspected to be the weapon of offence.
He took finger prints of the accused then injured,
admitted in civil hospital, through Head Proficient
Naveed Babar. He stated to have secured blood and

gun powder residue from right hand of the accused.
-ll-
He took into possession medico legal documents
alongwith blood stained shirt belonging to the accused
sent by the doctor through constable Seeratullah,
having a bullet cut mark and its left arm portion was
cut by the doctor. On 22.8.2017, father of the
deceased appeared before this witness and produced
certain letters of threats with live round of .30 bore,
allegedly sent by the accused to the deceased and his
family. He stated that on the same date, PW Muneer
Ahmad pointed out the place of occurrence to him
vide his note on the site plan. He stated that during
course of investigation, he came to know that the
accused had purchased the recovered pistol from the
Muhammad Farhan Nawaz, who was working as
Munshi at Marwat Arms Dealer, Mehsood Market
D.J.Khan, therefore, he summoned said Muhammad
Farhan Nawaz to the police station and took into
possession a licence copy of .30 bore pistol in his
name of Muhammad Farhan Nawaz, and the same
alongwith attested copy of page from sale Register of
Marwat Arm dealer was exhibited as Ex.P-12. He
stated that PW Muhammad Farhan Nawaz disclosed

that he had earlier sold his 30 bore pistol bearing
-12-
No.853 alongwith five live rounds of same bore to
the convict/appellant at Rs.6000/-. His statement
was also recorded by the Investigating Officer.
PW-10 prepared list of legal heirs of the deceased
and recorded statements of PWs under section 161,
Cr.P.C. He produced father of the deceased before
the Judicial Magistrate for recording his statement
under section 164, Cr.P.C. He arrested the accused
and issued card of arrest. He also took into
possession AIOU exam copy of PTC course
belonging to the accused for the purpose of
comparison of hand writing of the letters written by
the accused with the deceased and his mother. He
placed on file the FSL report in respect of matching
of latent print of the recovered pistol. He also placed
on file photographs taken during investigation
including those taken during spot inspection and
pointation of place of occurrence by the accused. He
stated that a joint investigation team was constituted
for investigation of the instant case. He applied for
physical custody of the accused and three days
physical custody in respect of the accused was

granted. He recorded statement of the accused u/s
-13-
161, Cr.P.C. wherein the accused confessed his
guilt. He made additions to the site plan on
pointation of the accused and prepared pointation
memo. He also placed on file the FSL report Ex.
PK/1 in respect of .30 bore pistol, two empties of
same bore and the gun powder residue secured from
the hand of the accused. He also issued information
memo in respect of addition of offence under
section 15 Arms Act. He also placed on file the FSL
report Ex. PK/2 in respect of parcels No.1 and 9. He
produced PWs Muneer Ahmad and Farhan Nawaz
for recording their statements u/s 164, Cr.P.C.
before the Judicial Magistrate, D.I-Khan and placed
their statements on file. He placed on file the report
of Finger Prints Expert Ex. PK/3. He placed on file
attested copies of daily diary regarding his departure
and return to the police station in respect of
pointation of place of occurrence by the accused. He
placed on file Figer Print Card of accused and
photocopies of letters sent by the accused. He stated
that during the course of investigation, Bashir
Hussain SI received extraction report from FSL

Computer Lab Peshawar pertaining to messages
-14-
sent/received through mobile sets. After completion
of investigation, he handed over the case file to the
then SHO for submission of challan against the
accused. This witness was cross-examined where he
stated that in this case Muneer Ahmad was the sole
eyewitness of the occurrence, who went to the house
of Hafeez Khakwani after the occurrence, but he did
not record statement of said Hafeez Khakwani or
any other family member of his family to confirm
the factum of coming and presence of said Muneer
Ahmad PW to their house. In view of the above, the
second story as portrayed by the prosecution ends
here, being disbelieved, for the reason that the
ocular account so narrated could not be relied upon
being too fictional and uncorroborated.

8. Now the prosecution is left with recovery
of .30 bore pistol assigned to the appellant to have
allegedly used the same in the commission of
offence. In this respect, Muhammad Farhan Nawaz
Munshi at Marwat Arms Dealer shop was examined
as PW-14, where he stated that during those days,
he was working as Munshi at shop of Marwat Arms

Dealer; that accused/appellant was well known to
-15-
him being his friend, who was asking from him
since six months prior to the occurrence to give him
some pistol; that few days prior to the occurrence,
the appellant came to his shop and he gave him .30
bore pistol No.853 alongwith five live cartridges
against Rs.6000/-, as the accused claimed to have
valid licence, so on 20.8.2017, the pistol was sold
by him to the accused, who was directed to remove
licence number of PW-14 and to print his licence
number on the pistol. He stated that the accused
demanded for the pistol urgently for his safety. PW-
14 further stated that he did not know as to what for
the accused was purchasing pistol from him. He
stated that during investigation, his statement was
recorded by the police as well as before the
Magistrate. During cross examination, a question
was put to him regarding identification parade of the
pistol in question to which he replied that the police
did not conduct any identification parade and never
asked him to pick up his pistol in any such
identification parade. He also admitted that .30 bore
pistols are openly available in the market and these

can be easily purchased by someone in the open
-16-
market. In view of the above, it was necessary to put
the recovered pistol to identification parade to
ascertain that it was the same pistol which the
convict/appellant had purchased from PW-14, more
particularly when the number of said pistol was
deciphered. In the circumstances, recovery of pistol
could not be used against the appellant for
sustaining conviction on a capital charge. Hence, we
have been left with no option but to discard the
matching report of FSL from consideration.

9. Yet there is another aspect of the case i.e.
securing of blood and gun powder from right hand of
the accused/appellant, in that respect Naveed HC was
examined as PW-3. He was also associated with the
investigation and in his presence the Investigating
Officer took into possession .30 bore pistol with two
bullets in its magazine duly fitted and one bullet
loaded in its chamber. He was asked by the
Investigating Officer to secure said pistol which he
did accordingly and packed the same into a box and
delivered to the Investigating Officer, however, during
cross-examination, he stated that the Investigating

Officer had indicated it by pointing out the same in a
-17-
plot and asked him to preserve it which he did
accordingly. He stated to have obtained the finger
prints as well as the blood and gun powder at the
hands of the appellant while he was admitted in the
hospital, however, he did not ask any doctor or ward
attendant to be the witness of said proceedings, which
fact is also admitted by Chan Shah S.I PW-6, during
cross examination. In such eventuality, when none
from the ward staff was examined to support the
testimony of PW-3, therefore, securing of gun powder
from the accused could not be believed, what to talk
of the positive FSL report in that regard.
10. In addition to the above, on 21.8.2017 at
2:40 PM, the appellant was medically examined by
Dr. Naseem Ullah PW-9. On said date at about 3:15
PM, this witness conducted autopsy on the dead body
of the deceased. He observed an entry wound of
firearm on left cheek, size 1/5x1/5 inch with its exit on
right side of occiput, size 1/2x1/2. Scalp, skull,
membranes of brain spinal cord were injured. During
cross examination, he stated that in case of both the
deceased as well as injured, there was no blackening

and charring marks etc. We are conscious of the fact
-18 -
that according to medical jurisprudence, charring
marks, with pistol’s fire can be caused from a distance
of six inches. In the present case, no charring marks
or blackening was observed by the doctor PW-9,
which belies the stance of prosecution. As per
prosecution version, if the accused had fired from a
close distance at the deceased as well as inflicted
injury to himself, then in that eventuality, PW-9 must
have noticed blackening and charring marks, which is
not the case here.

11. Besides the above, Samiullah MLC Clerk
was examined as DW-1, who produced ward record
pertaining to the appellant. During cross examination,
this witness was confronted with the injuries sustained
by the appellant. According to record produced by this
witness there was one entry wound on post surface of
left arm and the other exit wound on anterior surface
of left arm with fracture of left humorous. According
to Ex. DW 1/1, only one firearm injury at left arm
with radial nerve injury has been shown. This witness
admitted that no facility is available at DHQ Teaching

Hospital for safe keeping of articles mentioned in
-19-
Ex.D-1, which are merely lying unsecured in a
cupboard of the office.

13. The learned trial Court has not appreciated
the evidence in its true perspective and thereby fell in
error by convicting the appellant. We have minutely
perused the judgment under challenge through all
angles, which cannot face the test of judicious scrutiny
and the same invites attention of this Court for
interference.

14, Accumulative effect of the whole aspects
taken into consideration, leads us to only conclusion
that the prosecution has miserably failed to establish
the case against the appellant, otherwise to extend
benefit of doubt so many circumstances are not
required to be brought forth. The instant criminal
appeal is, therefore, allowed, the impugned judgment
is set aside, resultantly, the appellant is acquitted of
the charges levelled against him. He shall be released
forthwith, if not required to be detained in connection
with any other case. Since we have set aside the
conviction and sentence awarded to the appellant,

therefore, the connected criminal revision for
-20-

enhancement of sentence has become infructuous

which stands dismissed accordingly.

14,

Above are the detailed reasons of our short

order announced on 02.3.2022, which is reproduced

herein below:-

detailed judgment, this appeal is allowed,
