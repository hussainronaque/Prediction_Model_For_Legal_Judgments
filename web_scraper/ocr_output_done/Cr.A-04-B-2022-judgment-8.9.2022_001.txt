SHAHID KHAN, J.- The subject single judgment shall
dispose of the instant criminal appeal coupled with Cr.R. No.
05-B/2022 (Mst. Mal Shahzada Vs Mustafa Ali Shah & 02
others) as both the same find their origin in Sessions trial
No.304/SC of 2019, in respect of the trial, outcome of one and
the same incident, registered vide F.I.R No. 930 dated
15.11.2018 u/s 302/34 P.P.C, Police Station, City, Bannu.

2. Appellants namely, Mustafa Ali Shah and Ishaque
Ali Shah, being aggrieved by judgment dated 23.12.2021 of the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-III, Bannu in Sessions trial

No. 304/SC of 2019, by which the accused/appellants have
been convicted U/S.302(b)/34 PPC, and sentenced to suffer
rigorous imprisonment for life with direction to pay of
Rs.10,00,000/-(ten Lacs) each, to the legal heirs of deceased u/s
544-A Cr.P.C and in default whereof they shall further undergo
six months simple imprisonment. Benefit of Section-382-B
Cr.PC was extended in favour of accused in the case Hence, the
appellants preferred this appeal against their conviction and
sentence.

3. Complainant Nasib Nawaz Khan, deceased then
injured, on 15.11.2018 at 12:45 hours in the emergency room of
Civil Hospital Bannu reported the matter to police to the effect
that on the day of incident, he was proceeding to Tehsil Office,
Bannu in his personal vehicle in connection with entry of
mutation, he parked his vehicle on railway road Bannu city and
went towards Tehsil building on foot, he while on his way in
Bagh Gali near the jewellery shop of Mustafa Ali Shah at about
12:00 hours, both the accused duly armed with pistols came out
from their shop and fired at him with intention to kill,

resultantly, from the fire of accused Mustafa Ali Shah, he got
hit and injured. Previous blood feud enmity was described as
motive for the offence. Both the accused after commission of
offence fled away from the crime venue, thus, the ibid FIR.

4. After completion of investigation, challan against
the accused was put in court and procuring attendance of
accused, the learned trial court confronted both the accused
with the allegations against them through charge sheet,
whereof, the accused/appellants denied the allegations against
them and pleaded not guilty.

5. The learned trial court after recording the
prosecution’s evidence consists of the statements of ten
witnesses, confronted the accused under section 342 Cr.P.C
with the set of allegations and the evidence so recorded against
them, wherein the accused denied the allegations and professed
innocence, however, neither they wished to be examined on
oath as provided under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C, nor intended to
produce evidence in his defense.

6. The learned trial court after hearing arguments of

the learned counsel for the parties and learned prosecutor
nV)

coupled with scanning of evidence with their due assistance,
arrived at the conclusion that the accused/appellants were
guilty, as such vide impugned judgment dated 23.12.2021
convicted and sentenced both the appellants u/s 302(b)/34
P.P.C in the above manner, hence, the instant appeal against the
impugned judgment of the trial court as well as connected Cr.R
No.05-B/2022 for enhancement of the sentence.

7. Learned counsel for the appellants contends that
the impugned judgment of the learned trial court is against law
and facts, thus, not tenable in the eye of law and liable to be set-
aside; that evidence of prosecution is full of doubts, dishonest
improvements and shaky but still the learned trial court has
recorded the conviction of appellants; that the prosecution story
is neither supported by medical evidence nor by the recovery of
the alleged crime weapon; that a cross case vide F.I.R No. 931
of the even date was registered by the appellant No.1 and as per
evidence, it was the deceased who attacked the jeweler shop of
accused party with pre-mediation; that the benefit of doubts

which should have been extended in favour of appellants has
4;

wrongly been extended to the prosecution; that the cause of
death of deceased was highly doubtful and there is no
prohibitory evidence regarding the death; that occurrence has
not taken place in the mode and manner so claimed and
presented by the prosecution. The learned trial court has not
appreciated the prosecution’s evidence in its letter and spirit
and failed to high light the contradictions in the ocular account,
circumstantial evidence and medical evidence. Concluded, the
role attributed to the convict/accused Ishaq Ali Shah is only to
the extent of firing without causing any injury at all and strong
presumption can no way be ruled out that accused Ishaq Ali
Shah was not present at all at the fateful time, other-wise, he
was supposed to facilitate the alleged co-accomplice in the
commission of offence. Likewise, mensrea on part of the
convict/appellant Ishaq Ali Shah has not been substantiated for
the reason that neither repeat of attempt is alleged against him
nor the same has been alleged by the deceased then injured in

his report.

8. In rebuttal, learned counsel for complainant
assisted by learned AAG, while supporting the impugned
judgment, contended that the accused/appellants are directly
charged for the murder of deceased by firing at him; that all the
PWs are consistent and coherent in their deposition made by
them in their court statements in respect of the occurrence; that
no major or minor contradiction could be extracted from their
mouths; that the prosecution has proved its case beyond
reasonable doubts; Learned counsel said that the witnesses fully
supported the prosecution case, he was of the view that the
learned trial court after analyzing the evidence on record and
statements of the witnesses, found it to be credible, cogent and
trust worthy and this being the position there is no scope for
interference by this court in the well founded judgment
rendered by the learned trial court.

9. Arguments heard and record perused.

10. The record tells that the complainant deceased then
injured reported the matter to the Farid Khan ASI (PW-5) who

reduced the same into writing vide murasila Ex.PW-5/2,
aor

however, before writing the report he obtained the opinion of
doctor regarding consciousness of the complainant vide
application Ex.PW-5/1. The very averments of the murasila
divulges that at the time of reporting the matter the deceased
then injured was fully conscious while this fact could also be
ascertained from the medicolegal report Ex.PW-1/1 that the
injured was well oriented in time and space. Though the
defense side subjected the said PW-5 to lengthy cross
examination but astonishingly he was not asked a question
regarding consciousness of the complainant at the time of
report. The deceased then injured was examined by Dr.
Irfanullah (PW-1) who opined vide application moved by PW-5
that the injured was well oriented in time and space. This PW
was also cross examined at length but nothing favourable for
the defense to the extent of accused Mustafa Ali Shah could be
brought out of his mouth, as such it could be safely concluded
that the deceased then injured at the time of reporting the matter
was conscious in time and place. Keeping in view the locail of

injury on the right upper abdomen normally did not disturb the
sense of understanding and speech; as such the murasila report
in shape of dying declaration of complainant could not be
shattered at all. Reliance in this respect well be placed on case
titled “Farmanullah Vs Qadeem Khan & other” (2001 SCMR
1474), the relevant portion is reproduced hereunder:-

"---§. 302---Qanun-e-Shahadat (10 of 1984),
Art.46---Appreciation of evidence---Dying
declaration---Dying declaration made soon after the
incident, or at a time when the deceased expected
death, or at a time by which the deceased could not
have consulted others, or received hints from others,
will ordinarily be deserving great weight---If the
contents of the dying declaration appear to be true,
having been made without any exaggeration and
without making an attempt to rope in false persons,
dying declaration will be worth reliance. "

11. The record also tells that on the day of incident,
accused/appellant Mustafa Ali Shah also lodged report against
deceased then injured and his nephew Habib Nawaz to the
effect that on the command of deceased then injured, his
nephew Habib Nawaz attempted at the lives of
accused/appellants as a result of which accused Mustafa Ali
Shah got hit and injured on his right hand and finger but co-
accused Ishaq Ali Shah escaped unhurt. Regarding the above
incident F..R No. 931 u/s 324/34 was registered against the

deceased then injured and his nephew. Perusal of both the FIRs
reveals that the date, time, venue of crime and motive in both
the cases were the same, thus, question as to who was aggressor
arises. The whole evidence on record is silent regarding the fact
that which party assaulted first and which reacted in response.
Both the parties concealed the injuries of opposite party.
However, it could safely be held the deceased then injured was
not aggressor as no crime weapon was recovered from the place
of occurrence nor from possession of the deceased then injured.
For the sake of arguments, if it is presumed that deceased then
injured was aggressor then in that eventuality the report of
Musftafa Ali Shah was silent regarding injury of the deceased
then injured and why he has not taken the plea of self defense in
the investigation or in his statement recorded U/S 342 Cr.P.C.
The incident had taken place at 12:00 hours but he reported the
matter on the spot at 14:00 hours, so why he did not reported
the matter in time rather delayed the same till the time of his
arrest, therefore, in the circumstances of the case, it could not
be concluded the aggression was made by the deceased then

injured and the accused/appellants reacted in self defense.
-10-

12. Next is the role of accused Ishaq Ali Shah in the
commission of offence. It is transparent from the record that the
deceased then injured attributed the role of ineffective firing in
the commission of offence to him and during the investigation
the I.O did procure positive report of the pistol so recovered
from the accused with its matching result of the crime empties
secured from the scene of occurrence. It is hard fact that the
deceased then injured has attributed role of only firing to
accused/appellant Ishaq Ali Shah.

13. There is no denial at all that the deceased then
injured complainant in his initial report specifically charged the
accused/appellant Mustafa Ali Shah for effective firing while
accused Ishaq Ali Shah for ineffective firing in his dying
declaration, as such co-accused Ishaq Ali Shah was exonerated
by the deceased then injured from the charge of effective firing,
thus, he was in no way sharing common intention with the
principal accused and he could not be held liable for vicarious
liability, as the record transpired that no material,

whatsoever, had been brought on record to show that co-

bay,

-ll-

accused Ishaq Ali Shah had committed the murder in
connivance with main accused, as such the question of
vicarious liability or sharing common intention with co-accused
did not arise in circumstances and prosecution remained unable
to establish intention of accused to kill the deceased. Reliance
can be placed on a case titled “Mashooque Ali & another Vs
The State” (2022 P.Cr.L.J Note 62) the relevant portion is

reproduced hereunder:-

"(a) Penal Code (XLV of 1860)---

----Ss. 302 & 34---Qatl-i-amd, common intention-
--Appreciation of evidence---Prosecution case
was that the accused along with his co-accused
persons committed murder of the complainant's
sister---Allegation of causing murder of deceased
was mainly against the accused who along with
co-accused had committed murder---Charge
against the accused was different from that of the
co-accused persons---Allegation of causing
hatchet blows against the accused were stated by
real brother of deceased, who was not alleged to
have any motive to falsely implicate the accused--
-In absence of such plea, the presumption of truth
was normally attached to such words particularly
if the same remained un-shattered despite lengthy
cross-examination as well find corroboration from
other independent evidence---Evidence of
Investigating Officer reflected that after
completing all legal formalities of the
investigation, he arrested the accused, secured
hatchet from him, produced him before the
Magistrate where he confessed his guilt---
Witnesses were subjected to lengthy cross-
examination, but they had stood by their version
on all material points---Recovery of hatchet from
accused together with his confessional statement
before Magistrate could not be lost of sight under
any pretext---Record transpired that __no
material, whatsoever, had been brought on
s

-12-

record to show that co-accused persons had
committed the murder in connivance with

main accused---Prima facie, it appeared that they
had no relation with the deceased, therefore, their
intention to kill the lady was not proved by the
prosecution---Only allegation against the said two
co-accused was of sharing common intention
with main accused, which was never proved by
prosecution---Case against accused was proved
beyond any shadow of doubt, hence his appeal
against conviction was dismissed---Prosecution
had failed to prove their case against co-accused
beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, hence
their appeal against conviction was allowed, in

circumstances."

Reliance can also be placed on another case titled
“Muhammad Yousaf Vs the State & others” (2018 MLD 289
{Lahore}) the relevant portion of which is reproduced as
under:-

"Record transpired that accused had ample
opportunity to do away with the deceased by firing
but admittedly he had not caused any- fire-arm
injury to the deceased---Question of vicarious
liability or sharing common intention with co-
accused did not arise in circumstances and
prosecution remained unable to establish intention

of accused to kill the deceased."

14. The cumulative effect of what has been stated
above, leads this Court nowhere but to hold that the appellant
Mustafa Ali Shah could not succeed to invite the attention of
this Court to set-aside the impugned conviction order/judgment,
as such in view of the above discussion, this Court is of the

considered view that case against accused Mustafa Ali Shah is
-13-

proved beyond any shadow of doubt hence the instant Criminal
Appeal to his extent is hereby dismissed.

15. So far as the appeal to the extent of
accused/appellant Ishaq Ali Shah is concerned, the prosecution
has failed to prove their case for sharing common against him
beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt hence this appeal is
partially allowed and impugned judgment dated 23.12.2021 to
his extent is set aside and he is acquitted of the charges leveled
against him. He be set free forthwith, if not required in any
other case, whereas, to the extent of appellant Mustafa Ali Shah
the same is dismissed. The connected Cr.R No. 05-B/2022 also
stands dismissed. These are the detailed reasons of the short
order of the even date.
