3, Since all the matters are the outcome of one and the same
judgment dated 31.07.2019, passed by the learned Trial Court,
therefore, we propose to decide and answer the same through this
common judgment.

4, The prosecution’s case as per FIR (Exh.PA) is that on
25.08.2017 at 2310 hours, Muhammad Jameel complainant (PW.8),
in company of dead body of his son, namely, Waleed Ahmad,
reported to Akram Khan ASI (PW.12), in casualty of DHQ hospital
Swabi, to the effect that on 25.08.2017, he along with his deceased
son and brother, namely, Sher Azam Khan (PW.9), was present in
his grocery shop “Karyana Dukan”, situated in Mohallah Orya
Khel Pabini Swabi when at 2145 hours, appellant Umar Ali, duly
armed with firearm, entered the shop and opened fire at them with
the intention to do them away, as a result, Waleed Ahmad deceased
got hit and died at the spot, whereas, he and PW Sher Azam,
narrowly escaped unhurt. He identified the appellant in light of
electric bulbs installed and lit outside and inside the shop. A dispute
over women folk was advanced by him as a motive behind the
occurrence. His report was reduced into writing in the shape of
Murasila Exh.PA/I by Akram Khan ASI (PW.12), who also
prepared injury sheet Exh.PW.1/1 and inquest report Exh.PW.1/2 of
the deceased and shifted his dead body to the mortuary for
postmortem examination. On the basis of Murasila Exh.PA/1 FIR
Exh.PA was registered against the appellant.

5. On 25.08.2017 at 2310 hours, Dr. Aamir Naseem Khan

(PW.6), conducted autopsy on the dead body of Waleed Khan
deceased and noticed the following injuries on his person vide
autopsy report Exh.PM:-

1. Large size multiple wounds on left upper arm
with multiple fractures of left humors.
2. Two wounds on face 10x 10 cm and 5 x 5

cm on right upper arm due to slipping of the

side of the chest just below and lateral to the

Larynx and trachea found intact while other
inner parts were found injured.

deceased has caused due to multiple fire arm
injuries to the lungs, diaphragm and heart causing
cardio respiratory compromise and immediate death.
Probable time between injury and death:
Immediate.
Time between death and postmortem: one
hour and 25 minutes.
6. Tariq Saeed Khan SI (PW.10), conducted investigation in

the case, who on receipt of copy of FIR and Murasila, proceeded to
the crime spot and prepared site plan Exh.PB on the pointation of
eyewitnesses. During spot inspection, he secured blood through
© cotton from the place of the deceased vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.3/1. Similarly, through recovery memo Exh.PW.3/2 he
took into possession 04 empties of 222 bore from the place of the
appellant at the spot. He also took into possession the last worn

bloodstained clothes of the deceased and two energy saver bulbs
w/

Exh.P.2, one installed inside and another outside the shop of
complainant vide recovery memo Exh.PW.3/3 in presence of
marginal witnesses to the recovery memos. He sent the
bloodstained articles to the FSL and Serologist report in this regard
is Exh.PK. The recovered empties were also sent by him to the FSL
for safe custody vide application Exh.PW.10/2. Since
accused/appellant was avoiding his lawful arrest, therefore, he
initiated proceedings under Sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. against
him and after completion of investigation handed over case file to
Munsif Ali SI/SHO, who submitted challan under section 512
Cr.P.C. against the appellant.

1. Accused/appellant was arrested by Zahid Khan SI and
handed over to Ghani Said Khan Inspector (PW.11) on 04.03.2018.
On completion of necessary investigation, complete challan was
submitted against him before the learned Trial Court where he was
formally charge sheeted under sections 302 and 324 PPC to which
he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To prove its case, the
prosecution examined as many as twelve witnesses. After closure of
the prosecution’s evidence, statement of the appellant was recorded
under section 342 Cr.P.C. wherein he denied the prosecution’s
allegation and professed his innocence. He, however, opted to be
examined on oath under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. and produce
evidence in defence.

8. After recording statement of the appellant under section
340(2) Cr.P.C. and examining Majid ur Rehman as DW.1, the

learned trial court after hearing both the sides, convicted and
sentenced the appellant as mentioned in Para No.1 of the judgment,
however, the appellant was acquitted under section 324 PPC.
Needless to say that the complainant has not filed an appeal against
acquittal of the appellant under section 324 PPC.
9. We have heard the exhaustive submissions of learned
counsel for the parties advanced at the bar and perused the record as
well as evidence with their able assistance.
10. It appears from the FIR that occurrence, in this case, has
taken place on 25.08.2017 at 2145 hours inside the grocery shop
(Karyana store) of complainant Muhammad Jameel, situated in
Mohallah Orya Khel Swabi, which has been reported by the
complainant in Casualty hospital Swabi to Akram Khan ASI
(PW.12). While furnishing ocular account, Muhammad Jameel
complainant and PW Sher Azam Khan have directly and singularly
charged the appellant for murder of Waleed Ahmad deceased and
murder attempt at their lives. The ocular account of the case has
furnished by the complainant (PW.8) and eyewitness, namely, Sher
Azam Khan (PW.9). The former while appearing as PW.8 in the
witness box deposed as under:-

“Deceased Waleed Ahmad was my son. PW Sher Azam Khan

is my brother. Accused facing trial Umar Ali is my
co-villager. On the eventful night, I along with my deceased
“ son Waleed Ahmad and brother Sher Azam Khan was present
in our grocery shop, situated in Mohallah Orya Khel, village
Pabani. It was about 21.45 hours when the accused facing trial
Umar Ali came duly armed to the shop and opened firing at

us. With the firing of the accused my son Waleed Ahmad got
6

hit and died at the spot. I and my brother PW Sher Azam
escaped unhurt. At the relevant time, light of bulbs was
available inside and outside the shop. We being empty handed
could do nothing. Motive behind the occurrence was women
dispute. We took the dead body of the deceased to the casualty
of DHQ Hospital Swabi where I made report which was
recorded in the shape of Murasila Exh.PA/1 which duly bears
my thumb impression. I have pointed out the spot to the
Investigating Officer (1.0). I charge the accused for murder of
my son Waleed Ahmad and ineffective attempt at my life as
well as attempt on the life of my brother PW Sher Azam
Khan”.
ll. Sher Azam Khan, eyewitness of the incident was
examined as PW.9, who narrated the story of events occurred on the

fateful evening of 25" August, 2017 in the following words:-

“Complainant Muhammad Jameel is my brother while
deceased Waleed Ahmad was my paternal nephew and son of
complainant Muhammad Jameel. On the eventful night I
along with my brother Muhammad Jameel and Waleed
Ahmad was present in our grocery shop, situated in Mohallah
Orya Khel village Pabani. It was about 2145 hours, when
Umar Ali accused came at the shop duly armed with firearm
and opened firing at us. With the firing of the accused my
nephew Waleed Ahmad deceased got hit and died on the spot
or u/ while I and my brother Muhammad Jameel escaped unhurt.

The occurrence was witnessed by me. Motive behind the
occurrence was women dispute. I have pointed out the spot

the LO. who also recorded my statement. I charge the accused
for murder of the deceased and ineffective attempt on my life
as well as on the life of my brother Muhammad Jameel.”
12, The eyewitnesses named above have been subjected to
lengthy and taxing cross-examination but nothing of the sort to
discredit their testimony could be extracted from their mouths. No
reason and circumstance has been brought from their mouths, by
the defence, to remotely suggest substitution and false implication
of the appellant. It also does not appeal to a prudent mind that a
father and uncle of the deceased will spare the real culprit(s) and
charge an innocent person for murder of the deceased. Even
otherwise, substitution of real culprit charged directly and
singularly is a rare phenomenon in the system of criminal justice.
Reference in this regard can be made to case titled, “Allah Ditta Vs
the State” (PLD 2002 Supreme Court 52) and case titled,
“Muhammad Iqbal Vs the State” (PLD 2001 Supreme Court
222. The eyewitnesses have corroborated each other on all material
aspects of the occurrence such as the day, date, time and place of
occurrence and the mode and manner in which the appellant arrived
at the spot and committed the offence. Appellant is the co-villager
of the eyewitnesses and was already known to them. Besides,
recovery of the energy saver bulbs by the 1.0. from inside and
outside the shop and its exhibition in his statement before the court,
is another strong circumstance, eliminating the possibility of
yp we mistaken identity of the appellant on the part of the eyewitnesses.
Even otherwise, the defence, by putting certain questions to the

eyewitnesses has itself established their presence at the spot at the
time of occurrence. Both the eyewitnesses in cross-examination in
very accurate manner have disclosed about the points of their
presence, presence of the deceased and the appellant at the time of
occurrence as well as locations of the surrounding of the crime spot.
The defence itself has brought from the mouths of the eyewitnesses
in cross-examination that they along with the deceased are doing
business in the said shop and their houses are adjacent to the spot.
Replying to the questions of defence complainant Muhammad
Jameel stated that he goes to the shop at morning at about 7/8 AM
daily and his house is situated adjacent to his shop at a distance of
two furlongs. PW Sher Azan is also residing with him in the same
house. The said shop is rented to him by his maternal cousin which
was being jointly run by him and his brother Sher Azam Khan.
Similarly, in cross-examination Sher Azam eyewitness (PW.9) has
fully corroborated the testimony of complainant by stating that he
and his brother complainant Jameel run the shop jointly whereas
Waleed Khan deceased used to bring different commodities from
Swabi and Topi etc to the shop. The deceased besides brining
different commodities to the shop was also doing business in the
said shop with them. In view of the above circumstances, presence
of the eyewitnesses at the spot at the time of incident cannot be
doubted. No doubt, they are father and uncle of the deceased, but
et in absence of any hostility, animosity or any other motive to depose
4 falsely against the accused, their straightforward and confidence
inspiring evidence corroborated by strong circumstantial evidence

cannot be cast away.
eo

13. The testimony of the eyewitnesses is corroborated by
strong circumstantial evidence in the shape of recovery of blood of
the deceased from the spot and his last worn bloodstained garments
in respect whereof the Serologist report Exh.PK is in the positive.
Similarly, the unnatural death of the deceased due to firearm
injuries as opined by Dr. Aamir Naseem Khan (PW.6), who has
conducted autopsy of the deceased, further support the ocular
account of the eyewitnesses. Recovery of energy saver bulbs
Exh,P.2 from the spot by the 1.0. and thereafter its production
during trial also corroborates the ocular account of the
prosecution’s case and eliminate the possibility of mistaken identity
of the appellant. The testimony of the eyewitnesses is also in line
with the testimony of Investigating Officer, namely Saeed Khan SI
(PW.10) in respect of the proceedings conducted by him at the spot.
The testimony of the Investigating Officer and marginal witness to
recovery memos vide which different recoveries have been effected
have also not been shattered by the defence in their cross-
examination. No doubt, eyewitnesses are close relatives of the
deceased but they have remained firm and straightforward in their
testimony, therefore, on the sole ground of their close association
with the deceased, their testimony cannot be discarded. In case
titled, “Noor Muhammad vs the State and another”, (PLJ 2006
SC 177), the august supreme court has ruled that:-
“Mere relationship or close association of

prosecution witnesses with the deceased, in absence

of hostility, animosity or any other motive to depose
or?

10

falsely would not be sufficient to hold them as

interested witnesses and their testimony would not

be discarded on such ground.”
14. The argument of learned counsel for the appellant that as
the eyewitnesses have not sustained any injury in the occurrence,
therefore, their presence at the spot at the time of occurrence is
doubtful is not tenable for the reason that motive behind the crime
was directly against the deceased. In the FIR as well as in the
testimony furnished by the eyewitnesses, a dispute over women
folk has been advanced as a motive behind the crime. The appellant
while producing defence evidence has not denied the motive
outrightly. DW.1 while replying to a question of the prosecution
has only shown his ignorance about the cause of committing
murder of the deceased by the appellant. In response to a question
put to him by the prosecution in cross-examination he stated that he
does not know that one Mst. Kulsoom was engaged to accused %
years prior to the occurrence and her engagement was broken and
thereafter she was married to the deceased. From the above it is
manifest that the appellant had direct motive with the deceased, it is
therefore, he was the main target of the appellant. Even otherwise,
the Hobn’ble Supreme Court in its judgment rendered in case titled,
“Noor Muhammad vs the State and another”, (PLJ 2006 SC
177), has held that:-

“There could not be a presumption or rule that

all the persons under attack from fire-arms

ought to have received injuries and the fact that
11

some of them had not received injuries would

not make their presence at the place and time of

incident doubtful.”
15. On reappraisal of the prosecution’s evidence we are firm
in our view to hold that the prosecution has proved the commission
of intentional murder of Waleed Ahmad deceased by the appellant,
through cogent and confidence inspiring ocular evidence
corroborated by strong circumstantial evidence and supported by
medical evidence. The defence could not point out any major and
glaring contradictions in the testimony of the prosecution’s
witnesses. During arguments no discrepancy, divergence or
contradictions was pointed out by the defence in the testimony of
the PWs. Nevertheless, it is settled law that mere minor
discrepancies in the statements of the PWs would not be sufficient
for acquittal of the accused facing murder charge as with the
passage of time it is very natural that the witnesses might have not
been unanimous on minor narrations. Human behavior varies from
person to person. Different people not only behave and react
differently in different situation but their behavior also depends
upon facts of each case as to how a person reacts and behaves ina
particular situation, can never be predicted. Every person who
witnesses a serious crime reacts in his own way In case titled,
“Aijaz, Nawaz alias Baba Vs the State” (2019 P Cr L J 1775) , the
Divisional Bench of the august Sindh High Court, while
elaborating and dilating upon the conduct and behavour of

eyewitnesses has observed that in such a situation some persons
yor’

12

turn stunned, some become speechless whereas some would see
the incident whereas some would flee from the spot. No fixed rules
of natural conduct are available. Similar is the situation of memory
of different people. By and large people cannot accurately recall
the sequences of events which take place in a short span. People
can only remember the main purport of the incident.

16. No doubt it is well entrenched principle of law that
accused is treated as a favorable child of the courts and law and
benefit of even a single doubt is extended to him, but the doubt
must be reasonably entertained by a person of common prudence
on justifiable grounds. Said benefit could not be stretched to the
extent of self-created, imaginary and hypothetical doubts in favour
of accused at the cost of the family of the deceased who were the
victim of the brutal acts of accused, they too, deserve equal
treatment of the court of justice. Balance is to be maintained
between accused and the complainant party in dispensation of
justice before the court of law.

17. Adverting to the plea of alibi of the appellant taken by
him in his statement under section 340(2) Cr.P.C.. The occurrence
has taken place on 25.08.2017 whereas statement of the appellant
on oath has been recorded on 20.07.2019. He deposed that at the
time of occurrence he was present in village Palodhand and on his
way to home on a motorcycle he was informed by his brother-in-
law, namely, Majid about the occurrence and his nomination as
accused for committing murder of the deceased. The said

information was conveyed to him by Majid from Rawalpindi on
oe

13

his cell phone. In cross-examination the appellant clarified that
after 6/7 months of the occurrence he surrendered before the
police. He has not disclosed this fact either himself or through any
person to police or has tried to make any application to high ups of
the police regarding his innocence. Even after arrest he has not
submitted any application to the police regarding his innocence. He
admitted it correct that when he was brought to the court for trial
even then he did not make any application regarding his plea of
alibi. He further admitted it correct that the occurrence has taken
place about two years back and after two years he is taking the plea
of alibi by making the statement before the court under section
340(2) Cr.P.C.

18. Majid ur Rehman, brother-in-law of the appellant,while
appearing as DW.1 deposed that on the day of occurrence he was
present in Rawalpindi, wherefrom he informed the appellant about
murder of the deceased and his (appellant) nomination for
commission of the same. He also contacted his father-in-law who
told him that son of Jameel Kaka has been done to death and his
dead body has been shifted to the hospital. In cross-examination
DW.1 admitted that he has not brought any record in respect of the
alleged telephonic calls made by him to the appellant or the calls
on which he was informed about the incident in Rawalpindi from
his house. He admitted correct that factum of non-submitting any
application to High ups of the police regarding innocence of the
appellant. Neither DW.1 has disclosed the source through which he

learnt about the occurrence nor at any stage of investigation, he has
1 /

14

appeared before the Investigating Officer or high ups of the police
to give statement regarding innocence of the appellant. He has also
shown ignorance about earlier engagement of Mst. Kalsoom with
the appellant and after breaking of the said engagement, her
marriage with the deceased despite the fact that he is brother-in-
law of the appellant.

19. It is settled law that the plea of alibi shall be taken at the
earliest time/ stage i.e. soon after arrest of the accused. In this case,
since his arrest till recording of statement of the appellant under
section 340(2) Cr.P.C. i.e. a long period of two years, no such plea
has ever been taken by the appellant. He has also not furnished any
explanation, much less, plausible with regard to his delayed plea of
alibi. No independent witness has been produced by the appellant
in support and proof of his plea of alibi. The defence version of the
appellant is neither supported by any ocular account nor by
documentary evidence. In this view of the matter, the plea of alibi
taken after unexplained delay is after thought and has rightly been
disbelieved by the learned trial Court.

20. The learned trial court while appreciating the available
evidence on record, in its true perspective, has arrived at a just and
proper conclusion by holding the appellant guilty of committing
murder of Waleed Ahmad deceased to which no exception can be
taken. We could not note any mitigating circumstance warranting
reduction in the sentence of the appellant. Accordingly, the
conviction and sentence of the appellant recorded by the learned

trial Court under section 302(b) PPC vide judgment dated
15

31.07.2019, are maintained and his death sentence is confirmed.
Accordingly, the appeal of appellant/convict is hereby dismissed.
21. On confirmation of death sentence of the convict, the
Murder Reference No.28-P of 2019, sent by the learned trial Court
is answered in the affirmative.

22. As regards Cr.R. No.217-P of 2019, filed by
petitioner/complainant Muhammad Jameel Khan, seeking
compensation under section 544-A Cr.P.C. for legal heirs of the
deceased, we have gone through the judgment of the learned trial
court and noticed that neither any compensation for the legal heirs
of the deceased has been awarded under section 544-A Cr.P.C., nor
the learned trial court has furnished any reason for not doing so,
which is against the mandate of section 544-A Cr.P.C. For the sake
of convenience and ready reference we deem it appropriate and
advantageous to reproduce section 544-A Cr.P.C.

“544-A. Compensation of the heirs to the person
killed, etc.: (1) Whenever a person is convicted of
an offence in the commission whereof the death of,
or hurt, injury or mental anguish or psychological
damage, to any person is caused, or damage to or
loss or destruction of any property is caused,_the
Court shall, when convicting such person, unless
for reasons to be recorded in writing, it otherwise
directs, order the person, convicted to pay to the
V heirs of the person whose death has been caused, or

to the person hurt or injured, or to the person to

whom mental anguish or psychological damage has

been caused, or to the owner of the property
pr?

16

damaged, lost or destroyed, as the case may be, such
compensation as the Court may determine, having
regard to the circumstances of the case. And

(2) The compensation payable under subjection (1)
shall be recoverable as an arrears of land revenue
and the Court may further order that, in default of
payment or of recovery as; aforesaid the person
ordered to pay such compensation shall suffer
imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months,
or if it be a Court of the Magistrate of the Third
Class, for a period not exceeding thirty days.

(3) The compensation payable under sub-section
(1) shall be in addition to any sentence with the
Court may impose for the offence of which the
person directed to pay compensation has been
convicted.

(4) The provisions of sub-sections (2-B), (2-C),
(3) and (4) of Section 250 shall as far as may be,
apply to payment of compensation under this

section.

(5) An order under this section may also be
made by an Appellate Court or by a Court when
exercising its powers of revision.
23. By use of words “the Court shall” in section 544-A

Cr.P.C., the learned trial court was under obligation to award
compensation to the heirs of the deceased in addition to the
sentence awarded to the appellant or record reasons in writing, if
he was not convinced for doing so. Since under sub-section (5) of
section 544-A Cr.P.C., this court has the power to make an order

under section 544-A Cr.P.C. while exercising its powers of
17

revision, therefore, we will not remand the case to the learned trial
court for compliance of the mandatory provisions of section 544-A
Cr.P.C., rather would meet this omission itself.

24, For the reasons stated above, the connected Cr.R,
No.217-P_of 2019, is allowed. The convict in addition to his
sentence under section 302(b) PPC, shall also pay rupees five lacs
as compensation to legal heirs of the deceased in terms of section
544-A Cr.P.C. recoverable as arrears of land revenue and default
thereof shall undergo six months simple imprisonment.
