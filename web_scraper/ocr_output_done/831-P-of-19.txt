JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD _ NAEEM ANWAR, _J.- Appellant

through this criminal appeal has questioned the
judgment dated 04.9.2015 of Assistant Political
Agent/ADM, Lower Orakzai, whereby he was
convicted and sentenced under Section 3/4/ 5 of the
Explosive Act, 1908 along with section 11 of the
Frontier Crimes Regulation, 1901 for seven (07)
years rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs.
2,00000/- or in default of which he was directed to
further undergo RI for two years, however, the
benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C was extended to
him.

2. Substantial facts of the case are that on
25.11.2014, it was reported to the Assistant
Political Agent, Lower Orakzai, Kalaya, that some
unknown offenders planted explosive material in

Garo Mani khel area, which was exploded on the
same day i.e., 25.11.2014, at about 1100 hours,
whereby Shahid Hussain son of Itan Hussain, Bar
Muhammad Khel r/o Tarangi, Karim Ali son of
Nigab Ali, Bar Muhammad Khel, r/o Kurez, Amin
Ali son of Shabir Hussain, Bar Muhammad Khel
and Muhammad Janan son of Satar khan of Mani
khel were injured. The aforementioned injured were
shifted to kohat Hospital for further treatment. The
said information was reduced into writing at serial
No. 1045 on 25.11.2014. Process of investigation
started and elders of the Mani Khel were
summoned for 27.11.2014.

3. In response to process of investigation,
the Grand Jirga was held on 03.12.2014 with the
elders of Mani khel for determination of the
following issues:-

1. Explosion in Garo Mani Khel area occurred
on 25.11.2014,
2. Murder of Yaqub Ali resident of Shalozan,

Kurram Agency.

The elders were directed to hand over the
actual accused within three days. On the basis of
aforementioned direction, Habib Hassan son of Mir
Hassan, Mani Khel Mastali Khel was arrested and

was put behind the bars in Kalaya Head Quarters,
however, his father Mir Hassan was released on
04.12.2014. Likewise, in continuation of
investigation, on 09.12.2014, the following persons

being accused were arrested:-

1. Nisar Ali son of Sarwar Hussain, Mani
khel mastali khel,
2. Mir Hassan son of Mir Baz,

3. Ghafar Ali son of Shaz Ali,

4. Muhammad Nawaz son of Muhammad
Baz,
5. Gul Sarwar son of Ali Sarwar,

6. Awan Ali son of Ahmed Ali,

7. Muhammad Hassan son of Khial
Hassan all resident of Mani Khel,
Sabzi khel,

8. Ikhtiar Ali son of Sultan Ali, Mani
Khel, Zakria khel,

9. Noorjaf Ali son of Sardar Ali,

10. Mugadas Khan son of Amre Mehdi,
Mani khel, Ahmed Khel

4. The arrest of above named accused
resulted in convening of Jirga, wherein an
agreement was scribed to the effect that the matter
shall be resolved till 16.12.2014. The said
agreement was signed by elders of Mani Khel tribe,
however, they requested that Malik Noor, Ikhtiar,
Mugadas Khan and Awan Ai may be released and
as against them Nowsher Ali son of Sardar Ali,

Qaim Ali son of Ikhtiar Ali, Nawaz Ali son of
Mugadas Khan and Askhat Ali son of Asad Ali
were arrested. Later on, the above ten accused were
released on bail and it was handed down that till
16.12.2014, the hidden truth shall be brought on
surface. The elders of Mani Khel as per their
commitment have given in writing on 06.12.2014
that real culprit of incident of 25.11.2014 was
Habib Hussain, as such, he was handed over to
Orakzai scouts for investigation on 11.01.2015.

5. It appears from record that statement
of accused was recorded wherein he has
categorically denied the allegations levelled against
him. However, Malik Ikhtiar, Malik Nisar Ali and
Malik Nawaz were appointed as elders/members of
the council of elders by the accused, besides Malik
Saifoor Khan and Malik Mugadas khan were
appointed by Assistant Political Agent as members
of the council of elders. The aforementioned
council of elders have given their opinion and
found the accused involved in the commission of
offence, resultantly, the Assistant Political Agent
through its judgment dated 04.9..2015 convicted
and sentenced him as mentioned above. The
attested copy of the judgment was given to the

appellant on 3.1.2019 and this appeal was filed on
29.1.2019, which was admitted for hearing on

29.7.2019 by this Court and record was

requisitioned.
6. Arguments heard and record perused.
7. It transpires from the record that on

9.12.2014 Assistant Political Agent had arrested ten
persons namely, Nisar Ali, Mir Hassan, Ghafar Ali,
Muhammad Nawaz, Gul Sarwar, Awan Ali,
Muhammad Hassan, Ikhtiar Ali and Muqadas Khan
as accused besides appellant. However, it was very
strange that on 10.12.2014, four of the above were
substituted as such, Malik Noor was substituted by
Nowsher Ali, Ikhtiar Ali was substituted by Qaim
Ali (brother), Muqdas Khan was substituted by
Nawaz Ali (brother), Awan Ali was substituted by
Askhat Ali and then on the following day all the
above ten accused were released on bail.

8. Intriguingly enough, the accused
named above, who were substituted along with
co-accused being released on 11.12.2014, had
become Judges against accused/appellant and had
given a verdict against the appellant. Over and
above, three of them, namely, Malik Ikhtiar Ali,
Malik Nisar Ali and Malik Muhammad Nawaz

were appointed/nominated as members of the
council of elders , however, all were accused along
with appellant a day ago and now they were the
Judges against appellant and they have given their
verdict against appellant/convicts as under:-

9. Obviously, apart from the above,
nothing was available on record to connect the
accused with the commission of the offence.
Admittedly, it was an unseen occurrence, however,
when four persons were injured, who could be

examined either as witness of the explosion
(occurrence) or for the purpose of determining as to
whether anyone was in fact injured or not but none
of them was examined by the council of elders.
Secondly, the members of council of elders were
accused but were made Judges not only against the
appellant/convict but in fact they have become
Judges for themselves which was against the basic
principle of natural justice that no person can judge
a case in which he has an interest, i.e, Nemo judex
in causa sua. Guidance was also drawn from the

judgment of apex Court in case titled Govt of

NWEP vs Hassan Ahmad Haroon (2003 SCMR
104).

“In dealing with cases of bias attributed to
members constituting Tribunals, it is
-necessary to make a distinction between
pecuniary interest and prejudice so attributed.
It is obvious that pecuniary interest, however,
small, it may be in a subject-matter of the
proceedings, would wholly disqualify a
member from acting as a Judge. But where
pecuniary, interest is not attributed but instead
a bias is suggested, it often becomes necessary
to consider whether there is a reasonable
ground for assuming the possibility of a bias
and whether it is likely to produce in the minds
of the litigant or the public at large a
reasonable doubt about the fairness of the
administration of justice. It would. always be a
question of fact to be decided in each case. The

principle, says Halsbury, nemo debt esse judex
in causa propria sua precludes a justice who is
interested in the subject-matter of a dispute,

from acting as a justice therein."
Similarly, in suo moto case No. 04 of 2010-
P/2012_ P L D 2012 Supreme Court 553 the apex

Court has held that:-

“25.The principle of right to 'fair trial' has
been acknowledged and recognized by our
Courts since long and is by now well
entrenched in our jurisprudence. The right to a
‘fair trial' undoubtedly means a right to a
proper hearing by an unbiased competent
forum. The latter component of a 'fair trial' is
based on the age-old maxim "Nemo debet esse
judex in propria sua causa" that "no man can
be a judge in his own cause". This principle
has been further expounded to mean that a
Judge must not hear a case in which he has
personal interest, whether or not his decision is
influenced by his interest, for "justice should
not only be done but be seen to have been
done".

10. Though at the time of conviction of
appellant the Frontier Crime Regulation was
applicable and the case was tried thereunder but
even then the common law should have been
considered by the Assistant Political Agent, while
considering the opinion of council of elders, which
was not only against the Islamic law but also the
law of the land. Even in FCR it was not permissible
for Assistant political Agent to have awarded the
conviction on such like opinion of council of elders

constituted under section 10 of the FCR.
9. In view of the above discussion, I have
no doubt in my mind that in the present case, the
prosecution has not been able to prove its case
against the convict/appellant beyond reasonable
doubt and, therefore, the appeal is allowed,
resultantly, the conviction and sentences recorded
by the learned trial court is set aside and as a
consequent thereof appellant is acquitted of the
charge levelled against him. He be set at liberty
forthwith if not required in any other case.

Above are the reasons of short order of even
date.
