JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:-Through this common order, I
propose to decide the instant Cr.Misc.QP No.106-P/2021 and
connected Cr.Misc.QP No.103-P of 2021, and Cr.Misc.QP
No.110-P of 2021, all filed by Muhammad Ikram, the petitioner,
as all are arising out from one and the same order dated
20.10.2021 (wrongly mentioned as 26.10.2021 in the heading of
the petitions), passed by learned ASJ/Judge Special Court,
Peshawar, whereby, application of the petitioner for sending
samples from parcel No.20 to the FSL, has been turned down,
whereas, applications of the prosecution for summoning PW
Bakhtiar No.715 and summoning of Moharrir Shahab and
Constable Amjad No.469 and Inspector Hafeez ur Rehman, for
re-examination have been allowed.

2. Facts in brief forming the background of the instant

petitions are that Muhammad Ikram petitioner is an under trial
accused in case FIR No.208 dated 30.01.2020, registered under
section 9 (d) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 2019. After denial of the charge by the
petitioner, the prosecution evidence was invited. Some of the
prosecution evidence was recorded. During cross-examination of
Amjad No.469, on the request of learned counsel for the
petitioner the case property was de-sealed and as per contention
of learned counsel for the petitioner five packets of chars were
resembling like opium, therefore, the petitioner filed an
application for sending samples to the FSL from the said five
packets for re-examination, but his application was turned down
vide order dated 20.10.2021, whereas, through the same order,
applications of the prosecution for examination of PW Bakhtiar
No.715 and re-examination of PWs Shahab Moharrir/MASI,
constable Amjad No.469 and Hafeez ur Rehman SHO

(abandoned), were allowed, hence, these petitions.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner heard and record
perused.
4. It appears from record that samples sent to the FSL for

chemical analysis by the prosecution have already examined and
in this regard FSL report Exh.PZ is available on file. In this view
of the matter, the request of learned counsel for the petitioner qua
sending of samples from some five packets which according to
his observation resembles with opium, is not tenable at this
belated stage on the ground that on one hand, the learned counsel

for the petitioner is not an Expert, while on the other hand, such
exercise may prejudice the case of either side. In this view of the
matter, the learned trial court has rightly turned down the request
of the petitioner.

5. As regard grievance of the petitioner against the order of
the trial Court whereby some PWs have been summoned for
re-examination and an abandoned PW for examination, suffice it
to say that under section 540 Cr.P.C., the learned trial court has
ample power to summon any person as a witness or examine any
person in attendance though not summoned as a witness or recall
and re-examine any person already examined if his evidence
appears to it essential to the just decision of the case.
Conspicuous reading of section ibid shows that widest powers
have been invested with the court, when it comes to the question
of summoning a witness or to re-examine any witness. Need not
to be interpreted rather it is essence of the section ibid that if
evidence of any witness appears to the court to be essential to the
just decision of the case, it is the duty of the court to summon and
examine such witness, irrespective of the fact that name of such
witness is included in the calendar of witnesses or not. Learned
counsel for the petitioner led a lot of emphasis that examination
of an abandoned witness or summoning of a witness whose
statement has not recorded during investigation will not only
cause prejudice to the defence but will also amount to filling in
lacuna in prosecution’s case. The argument of learned counsel for
the petitioner is unpersuasive for the reasons that remedy

provided by section 540 Cr.P.C. is not only meant for
7

prosecution, but it can equally be agitated by defence also. As
observed above that the object of section ibid is to find the truth
through obtaining proper proof of such facts which lead the court
to arrive at a just and proper decision of the case, which exercise
cannot be dubbed as filling in lacuna in the prosecution’s case,
unless the fact and circumstances of the case make it apparent
that the exercise of power by the court would result in causing
serious prejudice to the accused.

6. The scheme of section 265-F Cr.P.C. at trial stage further
provides a mechanism for examination of witnesses. At this
juncture, I would also like to refer to $.265-F Cr.P.C, particularly,
its subsection (2), which is very much relevant, which for the
sake of convenience and ready reference is reproduced below:-

“§,265-F Evidence for prosecution:- (1) If the accused
does not plead guilty or the Court in its discretion does not
convict him on his plea, the Court shall proceed to hear the
complainant (if any) and take all such evidence as may be
produced in support of the prosecution. Provided that the
Court shall not be bound to hear any person as
complainant in any case in which the complaint has been
made by a Court.

(2) The Court shall ascertain from the public prosecutor or
as the case may be, from the complainant, the names of
any persons likely to be acquainted with the facts of the
case and to be able to give evidence for the prosecution,

and shall summon such persons to give evidence before it.
(7) If the accused or any one or several accused, after
entering on his defence, applies to the Court to issue any
process for compelling the attendance of any witness for
examination or the production of any document or other
thing, the Court shall issue such process unless it considers
that the application is made for the purpose of vexation or
delay or defeating the ends of justice such ground shall be
recorded by the Court in writing”.

§.265-F Cr.P.C. referred to above is quite comprehensive. This
section has been added in the Code notwithstanding the already
existing S.540 Cr.P.C. in order to ensure the concept of a fair trial
and in order to achieve this purpose, equal opportunity has been
provided to both, the accused and the prosecution for summoning
the evidence. Subsection (7) of 8.265-F Cr.P.C. grants even a
right to accused to apply for summoning any witness and
production of documents; therefore, balance has to be struck
between the parties. Section 265-F Cr.P.C. caters for such
situation where the Court may ascertain from the complainant the
name of any person likely to be acquainted with the facts of the
case and to be able to give evidence for prosecution. This section
does not provide specifically that only those witnesses can be
examined whose statements have been recorded under section
161 Cr.P.C. or their names have been mentioned in the challan in
column of witnesses. The intent of the legislature is very much
clear from the language of the entire section that the Court can
examine any person who is acquainted with the facts of the case,

therefore, the Court is not bound to record the statements of only
those witnesses who are listed in the calendar of witnesses only,
but in order to arrive at a just conclusion, the Court can call any
person likely to be acquainted with the facts of the case after
ascertaining it from the public prosecutor or the complainant
subject to the general provisions that summoning of any such
witness does not cause delay or defeat the ends of justice. It
would be the second option of the Court as to what extent it
consider or rely on the statement of such witness. Similarly,
under section 540 Cr.P.C. the Court can summon a material
witness even if his name does not appear in the column of
witnesses of the challan, provided his evidence is deemed
essential by the Trial Court for the right decision of the case.
Powers under section 540 Cr.P.C. to be exercised by the Court,
are divided into two parts. The first part is discretionary in nature,
whereas the second is mandatory. According to the first part, it is
discretionary with the Court to summon any person as a witness
suo motu or on an application of party, whereas according to the
second part, powers to summon, examine, recall or re-examine
any person as a witness, are to be exercised with due dare and
great caution. There should be some convincing evidence/
material available on record from which it is to be inferred that
the examination of a particular person as a witness is essential for
the just decision of the case. Power under section 540 Cr.P.C. can
be exercised if the Trial Court feels that the evidence of such a

person is essential for the just decision of the case.
7. The prosecution has filed application for summoning PW
Constable Bakhtiar on the ground that he had taken samples to
the FSL from the Police Station. His statement has been recorded
under section 161 Cr.P.C., but inadvertently, his name was not
mentioned in the column of Challan. Similar is the case of PWs
Moharrir Shahab ASI, and Inspector/SHO Hafeez ur Rehman,
who have registered FIR and submitted challan but inadvertently,
their names have not been mentioned in the Challan as witnesses.
PW Amjd No.469 has been examined, but the prosecution is
seeking his re-examination to the extent that he had taken
Murasila to the Police Station and to this extent he has not been
examined. The reasons furnished by the prosecution are plausible
and convincing, therefore, the learned trial court was justified to
allow the applications of the prosecution.

8. The impugned order being well reasoned and based on
proper application of law on the subject are not open to any
interference by this court. Accordingly, this and the connected
Cr.Mise.QP No.103-P and Cr.Misc.QP No.110-P of 2011, are
hereby dismissed.
