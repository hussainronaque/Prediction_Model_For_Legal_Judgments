ORDER

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- Petitioner

Ahmad Ullah, seeks bail in case FIR NO.1218 dated
30.12.2015, registered under section 15 and 17 Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013 and S.7 Anti Terrorism Act,
1997, in Police Station Badh Ber, Peshawar, wherein a
recovery of 100 pistols of different bores, have been shown
recovered from secret cavities of his flying Coach bearing
registration No.C.1801 Bannu, by the local police on
30.12.2015 at 12.20 hours, which he allegedly was
trafficking for the purpose of terrorism.

2. Arguments heard and record perused.

3. No doubt a huge lot pistols have been shown
recovered from the vehicle of the petitioner, but no shred
of evidence has been collected by the Investigating Officer
to depict involvement of the petitioner in cases of terrorism

or his nexus with any terrorists group or organization or

that he was trafficking the alleged recovered arms and to
facilitate any act of terrorism, therefore, mere allegation of
terrorism without any cogent and tangible evidence at the
moment would not be sufficient to attract $.7 of the Anti
Terrorism Act. At the most the case of the petitioner falls
within the meaning of section 15 and 17 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013, punishment of which does
not fall within the Restrictive limb of $.497 Cr.P.C. and in
such like cases bail is a rule and refusal thereof an
exception. On the face of record, I see no exceptional
circumstance to clog the way of bail to the petitioner.

4. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he
furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two
local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD concerned.
