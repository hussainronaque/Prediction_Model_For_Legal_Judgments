3. Facts of the case are that on 15.03.2016 while
appearing in Police Station, Furqan/complainant submitted
an application (PA), where he maintained that on 15.03.2016
at about 05:15 pm, Nasir Ali (deceased) while standing in
front of his house situated at Lakkar Mandi Khanewal, was
busy in conversation on his mobile; he/complainant along
with Ghulam Farid (Pw-8) and Musharraf Ali (Pw-7) were
also present there and busy in discussion; all of a sudden
there emerged Muhammad Yasin alias Cheehma,
Muhammad Nawaz alias Nazi (appellants), Raees alias Billa
(PO)5 and two unknown persons; all assailants were armed
with 30-bore pistols; Muhammad Yasin alias Cheehma
made a fire which hit on the left arm of Nasir Ali and went
through and through; he fired second shot that hit on the left
side of chest of Nasir and he fell down on the ground;
thereafter, Muhammad Nawaz alias Nazi pressed the trigger
and fire hit on the right hand of Nasir Ali that too went
through and through; fourth fire in series came out from the
pistol of Muhammad Nawaz and hit on the fingers of right
hand of Nasir Ali; next fire from the weapon of Muhammad
Nawaz alias Nazi caused an injury in between the chest of
Nasir Ali; subsequent thereto, two bullets from the firearm
of Raees alias Billa (PO) resulted into injuries on the right
side of chest and testicles of Nasir Ali; final action was by
Muhammad Yasin alias Cheehma (appellant) who fired a
shot on the head of Nasir Ali which went through and
through; Nasir Ali died at the spot; unknown persons while
standing had been extending threats to kill any one if came
forward; all the assailants were succeeded to escape from
crime scene; occurrence was also witnessed by Sabira Bibi

(not produced) and residents of locality; motive was that

Criminal Appeal No.1577 of 2019
Muhammad Nawaz alias Nazi & another Versus The State

assailants were drug peddlers and Muhammad Yasin alias
Cheehma got registered a case for the murder of his brother
Haq Nawaz against Nasir Ali (deceased), Sultan and Irfan.

4. On the basis of above application FIR (PA/1) was
recorded by Muhammad Ajmal HC (Pw-1).

5. During investigation all accused including appellants
were declared as Proclaimed Offenders. However, on
27.12.2016, Muhammad Yasin alias Cheehma and on
18.12.2018 Muhammad Nawaz alias Nazi was arrested in
this case.

6. Primarily a report under Section 173 Cr.P.C (Challan)
was submitted to the extent of Muhammad Yasin alias
Cheehma and remaining accused were declared as
Proclaimed Offenders. A charge was framed against him on
20.02.2017 for which he pleaded not guilty and demanded
his trial. After certain witnesses were examined,
Muhammad Nawaz alias Nazi (appellant) was also arrested
therefore, a supplementary report under Section 173 Cr.P.C
was also submitted against him. He too was charged on
30.01.2019 under Sections 302/148/149 PPC and pleaded
not guilty.

7. It appears that earlier proceedings with regard to
recording of statements of certain witnesses were impliedly
declared as de novo® and fresh evidence was started.

8. In order to prove its’ case prosecution had produced
Muhammad Ajmal Head Constable/author of FIR (Pw-1),
Abdul Majeed Constable  (Pw-2), Sajid Ali
Constable/witness to arrest of Muhammad Yasin (Pw-3),
Dr. Ghulam Abbas (Pw-4), Raja Muhammad Iqbal
Janjua/draftsman (Pw-5), Abid Mehmood HC/Moharrar
(Pw-6), Musharraf Ali/eyewitness (Pw-7), Ghulam Farid/

eyewitness (Pw-8), Muhammad Azhar Sub
Inspector/Investigating Officer (Pw-9), Malik Husnain SI/IO
(Pw-10), Sajid Ali SIMO (Pw-11) and Muhammad Sajid
(Pw-12).

9. Sabira Bibi, Azhar Abbas and Muhammad Asif were
given up being unnecessary. After producing the expert
reports (PV and PW), prosecution’s evidence was closed by
the learned DDPP”.

10. In their examinations made under Section 342 Cr.P.C
versions of both the appellants were as under: -

Muhammad Yasin alias Cheema

“This case is false and fabricated, PWs are interse
related and interested witnesses and are inimical
towards me and my co-accused, they have deposed
falsely. The PWs are not natural witnesses, they
are not residents of near the place of occurrence
nor they witnessed the occurrence. The deceased
and his family had inimical towards many other
persons who were criminal persons and many
other criminal cases registered against the
deceased and his brothers and their father
complainant namely Furqan. Some unknown
persons murdered the deceased Nasir and the
complainant party after consultation and due
deliberation after spot inspection lodged this false
FIR against me and my co-accused because on
06.07.2015 the deceased Nasir Ali and _ his
brothers Sultan alias Tani, Irfan alias Fana since
P.O and father complainant namely Furqan since
died and other accused committed the murder of
my real brother Haq Nawaz and I lodged the case
FIR No.211/15 u/s 302/449/148/149 PPC Police
Station Kohna Khanewal against them and due to
that grudge the complainant party lodged this
false case against me and my co-accused Nawaz
as he was also witness of the abovesaid case. The
police did not investigate the matter fairly and due
to influence of complainant party they falsely
challan me and my co-accused. Nothing was
recovered from me and if something is shown fake
and planted one”

Muhammad Nawaz alias Nazxi

“This case is false and fabricated, PWs are interse

The police did not investigate the matter fairly and

investigation of this case and got recorded my first
version to Muhammad Azhar S.I/1.O that I was
working in Sadiq Poultry Private Ltd. in
Rawalpindi as a welder with Muhammad
Mukhtiar contractor and on the day of occurrence
I was present in the Rawalpindi in above said
factory. Muhammad Mukhtiar also submitted his
affidavit during investigation to 1.O in which he
fully supported my version. Muhammad Mukhtiar
also produced my attendance certificate in factory
on the day of occurrence but the I.O with malafide
intention did not make the same part of file and
falsely challaned me in this case on the asking of
complainant party. Nothing was recovered from
me and if something is shown fake and planted
one”

11. Appellants in their defence evidence produced copies of

FIR and other proceedings (DA to DD) however they did not opt

to appear in terms of Section 340(2) Cr.P.C.
Criminal Appeal No.1577 of 2019
Muhammad Nawaz alias Nazi & another Versus The State

12. Learned counsel for appellants contended that the
charge against Muhammad Yasin alias Cheehma framed by
the learned trial court was defective where Section 302 PPC
was not recorded; after the arrest of Muhammad Nawaz
alias Nazi and submission of supplementary report under
Section 173 Cr.P.C, it was the duty of learned trial court to
charge both the appellants jointly which was an illegality;
under all circumstances, it is the duty of prosecution to
prove its’ case beyond reasonable doubt and if said
assignment is not discharged, the consequences shall be in
favour of accused and none else; complainant Furqan did
not appear in witness box which is fatal to prosecution;
Sabira Bibi daughter of complainant was also stated to be
present at crime scene, but she was given up being
unnecessary and as she could be the best witness therefore
not to bring her in witness box has invited many challenges
for prosecution which remained unanswered; statements of
two eye witnesses are suffering from contradictions and
infirmities hence they cannot be relied upon; information to
police even if it was without delay, cannot be considered a
good reason to record the conviction and to sustain thereof;
the medical evidence does not support ocular account;
Muhammad Nawaz (appellant) had taken the plea of alibi
which was not investigated deliberately by the Investigating
Officers hence it is a case of defective investigation; on
behalf of Muhammad Nawaz (appellant) a certificate was
produced showing that on the relevant day he was present
on his duty at Rawalpindi, therefore, he could not be
convicted; enmity between the parties is not under dispute
so without any corroboration statements of eyewitnesses
cannot be given stamp of truth; absconding of both the

appellants cannot stand in their way if it is found that
Criminal Appeal No.1577 of 2019
Muhammad Nawaz alias Nazi & another Versus The State

prosecution could not establish its’ case against them.
Learned counsel finally argued that no good reason has
been assigned by the learned trial court while convicting the
appellants.

13. Appeal has been opposed by learned DDPP.

14. HEARD.

15. It is a matter of record that primarily he was
Muhammad Yasin alias Cheehma (appellant) against whom
on 20.02.2017 a charge under two heads was framed by the
learned trial court and that was as under: -

“That on 15.3.2016 at 5:15 pm in
the area of Lakkar Mandi Basti Chan Shah
P.S, Kohna you while armed with firearm
weapon along with your co-accused (since
P.O) formed an unlawful assembly in
furtherance of your common object with the
intention to commit Qatl-i-Amd of Nasir Ali
s/o. complainant Furqan, thus you
committed an offence punishable u/s 149
PPC which is within the cognizance of this
court.

That on the above said date, time
and place you while armed with pistol 30
bore alongwith your co accused caused
injuries on the person of Nasir Ali, as a
result of which he succumbed to the
injuries, thus you committed his Qatl-i-Amd
which is within the cognizance of this
court”

16. Undoubtedly there is no mention of Section 302 PPC
in the above charge so the question before this Court is that
whether such mistake on the part of learned trial court can
be a reason to vitiate the trial?

17. Accharge has been defined under Section 4 (C) Cr.PC
which says as under: -

“Charge includes any head of the charge,
when the charge contains more than one”
Criminal Appeal No.1577 of 2019
Muhammad Nawaz alias Nazi & another Versus The State

18. Accharge under the settled principles of law is precise
information of specific accusation and its purpose is to tell
an accused as precisely and concisely what the prosecution
intends to prove against him during trial. Purpose of
framing of charge is also to offer an opportunity to accused
to focus and concentrate his attention on the allegations he
has to face.

19. Chapter XIX (Ss 221 to 240) deals with ‘Form of
Charge’ ‘Alteration of Charge’ ‘Joinder of Offences’ and
‘Joinder of Accused’. Under Sections 221 to 223 Cr. PC,
the components of a charge are as under: -

i. Name, parentage, caste, age and
address of accused.

ii. The offence.

iii. If offence is named specifically by
law, which creates offence, the
offence may be described in the
charge by that name only.

iv. The Law and Section of Law.

v. Incase of previous conviction of the
accused for affecting the sentence,
the fact and date, place of the
previous conviction are to be stated.

vi. Particulars to the time, place and
the offence and the person against
whom or thing in respect of which it
is committed.

vii. In case of criminal breach of trust or
dishonest misappropriation of
money, it is sufficient to specify the
gross sum in respect of which the
offence is committed and the dates
between which it is committed
provided the time between first and
last date does not exceed one year.

viii. When the particulars mentioned in
Sections 221 and 222 of Cr.PC are
insufficient to notify the accused
with the matter, which he is charged,
the charge should also contain such
particulars and the manners in
which alleged offence was
committed ”
Criminal Appeal No.1577 of 2019
Muhammad Nawaz alias Nazi & another Versus The State

20. In the above said charge the date (15.03.2016), time
(05:15 pm), place of occurrence (Lakkar Mandi Basti Chan Shah),
offences (forming of an unlawful assembly and firing), name of
offence (Qatl-e-Amd) and law (PPC) were notified to
Muhammad Yasin. Only one component that is Section of
Law (302 PPC) could not be recorded therein. To come out
from the effect of this wrong, the provision of Section 225
Cr. PC is quite relevant and reproduced as under: -

“No error in stating either the offence or
the particulars required to be stated in the
charge, and no omission to state the
offence or those particulars, shall be
regarded at any stage of the case as
material, unless the accused was in fact
misled by such error or omission, and it has
occasioned a _ failure of justice”
(Emphasized applied)

21. The significant words used in the above provision are
‘error’ or ‘omission’. These two words have not been
defined under relevant Chapter (ibid) or under any of the
provisions of Cr.PC. The ordinary dictionary meanings of
‘error’ and ‘omission’ are as under: -

“ERROR “dn act involving an
unintentional deviation from accuracy; an
act that through ignorance, deficiency or
accident departs from or fails to achieve or

should be done?”
OMISSION “Something neglected or left
undone; a failure to do something9”

22. Inthe referred charge against Muhammad Yasin alias
Cheehma it was an omission on the part of learned trial
court which can be fatal to prosecution only if the appellants
are succeeded to show that because of such omission in fact
they were misled and it had occasioned a failure of justice.

Under Section 232 Cr. PC, this Court, in the given

* https://www.dictionary.com/browse/error
° https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/omission
Criminal Appeal No.1577 of 2019
Muhammad Nawaz alias Nazi & another Versus The State

circumstances, as a Court of appeal or revision can interfere
only if it is found that by such error or omission appellants
were misled in their defence. The said provision for better
understanding is as under: -

‘232. Effect of material error: (1) If any Appellate
Court, or the High Court [or the Court of Session]
in the exercise of its powers of revision or of its
powers under Chapter XXVII is of opinion that any
person convicted of an offence was misled in his
defence by the absence of a charge or by an error
in the charge, it shall direct a new trial to be had
upon a charge framed in whatever manner it
thinks fit.

(2) If the Court is of opinion that the facts of the
case are such that no valid charge could be
preferred against the accused in respect of the
facts proved, it shall quash the, conviction”

23. Learned counsel for appellants is unable to convince
this Court that because of omission made by the learned
trial court, what prejudice has been caused to appellants or
how his clients were misled in their defence or how there
was a failure of justice? Therefore, no benefit can be
extended to appellants because of said omission in the
charge.

24. After the submission of supplementary report under
Section of 173 Cr.P.C (Challan), no doubt that a joint charge
was required to be framed against both the appellants in
terms of Section 239 Cr.PC but as it was a procedural
irregularity causing no injustice to appellants so cannot be a
reason to reverse the proceedings conducted by the learned
trial court.

25. Coming to the merits of the case, I have gone through
the record of learned trial court with the valuable assistance
of both the sides. Occurrence had taken place at 05:15 pm.
Police Station was at a short distance where Furqan

immediately appeared and submitted an application and
Criminal Appeal No.1577 of 2019
Muhammad Nawaz alias Nazi & another Versus The State

within next 15 minutes that was at 05:30 pm, the FIR was
chalked out. In this document (PA) complete details and
manners of occurrence are recorded which includes names
of appellants and their co-accused, weapons they were
carrying, names of complainant and witnesses and the role
assigned to every accused. The defence during cross-
examination to the witnesses was completely failed to
shatter the genuineness of this document. Even by
imaginations there is nothing to hold that FIR was not
recorded at the given date and time or in the manners as
prosecution claimed. In these circumstances, the most
promptly lodged FIR has ruled out the question of false
involvement of the appellants in this case.

26. Furqan, the complainant of the case, before could
attend the witness box had taken his last breath therefore
appellants cannot take any benefit of the act of GOD in
particular when two eyewitnesses Musharraf Ali (Pw-7) and
Ghulam Farid (Pw-8) are still in the credit of prosecution.
27. These are the recognized principles of law that
prosecution is not bound to produce each and every witness
of the case’? and that it is the quality and not the quantity
that has to prevail for the purpose of arriving at a just
decision of the case’’. If Sabira Bibi, the daughter of
complainant, was not produced, that by no means can be
stated as a damaging factor for the prosecution.

28. No doubt that prior to the occurrence there was an
enmity in existence between the parties but the
eyewitnesses Musharraf Ali and Ghulam Farid produced by
the prosecution in this case were proved to be independent

having no relations with complainant or enmity with

' Muhammad Shafgat vs. The State 1970 SCMR 713
" Farman Ali and another vs. The State & another 2020 SCMR 597 and Niaz-ud-Din & another vs. the State and another PLJ 2011 SC 381
Criminal Appeal No.1577 of 2019
Muhammad Nawaz alias Nazi & another Versus The State

appellants. Musharraf Ali was although residing at a
distance of about half kilometer but in the same vicinity
where both the parties were living. He categorically stated
that he came there to see one Kamran who was the owner of
the shop where he/Musharraf Ali used to work. Similarly
Ghulam Farid (Pw-8) was residing quite close to the house
of complainant which fact too could not be disputed by
defence. Keeping in view the time of occurrence 05:15 pm
in the month of March, presence of both the witness has
also been proved to be natural.

29. The cross-examination conducted on both the
eyewitnesses makes it clear that defence was unable to
smash or destroy their reliability. Even by presumptions or
imaginations there is nothing to suggest that they had any
reason or grudge or motive to depose falsely against
appellants while appearing in court.

30. As mentioned earlier FIR was recorded at 05:30 pm.
It was thereafter when Sajid Ali S.I (Pw-11) arrived at crime
scene where he prepared injuries statement (PE) and inquest
report (PF) and send the dead body for postmortem
examination under the escort of Abdul Majeed/Constable
(Pw-2). The dead body was ultimately in hospital at 06:30
pm as admitted by Doctor Ghulam Abbas (Pw-4) who, then,
conducted the postmortem examination at midnight that
was 12:05 am. In these circumstances it is not only a case
of prompt information to police but prompt postmortem
examination of the body of Nasir Ali.

31. Learned counsel for appellants although claimed
contradictions and infirmities in the statements of witnesses
but during course of arguments he could not refer any
portion of cross-examination to substantiate such

contention. It is needless to observe that eyewitnesses came
Criminal Appeal No.1577 of 2019
Muhammad Nawaz alias Nazi & another Versus The State

in witness box after about three years and four months of
the occurrence because appellants were absconders so the
minor lapses, if any, in the statements of witnesses were
quite natural and cannot be a reason for acquittal on the
strength of golden principle that doubt arising out from the
statements of witnesses must be genuine and not artificial.
32. Reverting to medical evidence, he was Doctor
Ghulam Abbas who, on 16.03.2016 at about 12:05 am
(midnight) conducted the postmortem examination of Nasir
Ali and observed as under: -

Injury No.1. Firearm entry wound 1x1 cm
left side of skull 4cm above left ear. No
blackening and burning present. Fire arm
exit wound 3X3 cm right side of skull 7 cm
above right ear. Brain matter out.

Injury No.2. Firearm entry wound 1x1 cm
at back of chest. 2 cm lateral to vertebral
column 4cm away from medial border of
right scapula. No blackening, no burning
present. Fire arm exit wound 2x2 cm right
side of anterior of chest 2 cm below right
clavicle and 8 cm above right nipple.
Injury No.3. A firearm entry wound 1x1 cm
lateral to vertebral column 5 cm away from
medial border of right scapulae. No
burning, no blackening present. Firearm
exit wound 2x2 cm right side of anterior of
chest 2 cm lateral to sternum, 6 cm away
from right nipple.

Injury No.4. Fire arm entry wound 1x1 cm
of left nipple areola of left side anterior
chest. No blackening, no burning present.
One bullet removed from chest.

Injury No.5. Firearm entry 1x1 cm right
side anterior lower abdomen, right iliac
fossa, 7 cm away from right anterior
superior iliac supine. No blackening, no
burning present. Fire arm exit wound 2x2
cm at back of trunk 3 cm away from
vertebral column of right side.

Injury No.6. A fire arm entry wound 1x1
cm on left forearm posterior medially 2 cm
above ulna head. No blackening, no
burning present. Exit wound 2x2 anterior of
Criminal Appeal No.1577 of 2019
Muhammad Nawaz alias Nazi & another Versus The State

forearm 2 cm above lower border of ulna.
Entry exit wound inter distance of 3 cm.
Injury No.7. Firearm entry wound 1x1 cm
of palm of right hand anteriorly at third
metatarsal bone. No _ burning, no
blackening present. Exit wound 2x2 cm at
back of right hand at third metatarsal bone.
Injury No.8. Firearm entry wound 1x1 cm
right hand ring finger anteriorly at second
phalangeal bone. No blackening, no
burning present. Exit wound 1xl cm
posteriorly ring finger of right hand at
second phalangeal bone.”

33. According to Doctor all the injuries were fatal and
ante mortem in nature and caused by firearm weapons.

34. It was contended that the medical evidence does not
support the direct evidence, but learned counsel for
appellants has been completely failed to refer any such
contradiction between two sets of witnesses. Therefore
medical evidence of this case is a strong corroboration to
the ocular account.

35. The report of PFSA (PV) with regard to matching of
empties with the pistols recovered at the instances of
appellants is inconsequential, therefore, it requires no
discussion. However, the negative report shall have no
adverse impact on the testimony of two eyewitnesses for
the reason that at the most it is a corroborative and not
conclusive piece of evidence.

36. It is the prosecution case that after the occurrence,
appellants and their co-accused had disappeared and was
declared as Proclaimed Offenders. Muhammad Yasin alias
Cheehma was arrested on 27.12.2016 whereas, Muhammad
Nawaz alias Nazi was apprehended on 18.12.2018. Raees
alias Billa who is their real brother is still wanted. Even if it
is presumed that the absconding of appellants has not been

proved in accordance with law, even then their long
Criminal Appeal No.1577 of 2019
Muhammad Nawaz alias Nazi & another Versus The State

disappearance and avoidance from process of justice is a
hurdle in their way and can be used as corroboration to the
ocular account. Both appellants could not explain their long
disappearance after the occurrence and they also could not
dispute their dates of arrest as stated by the investigating
officers.

37. Muhammad Nawaz (appellant) had taken the plea of
alibi?” but after two years and nine months of the
occurrence when he was arrested. It is settled principle of
law that the plea of alibi being special plea must be taken at
first available opportunity and being a distinct plea is
required to be substantiated by adducing cogent and
concrete evidence. Muhammad Nawaz, before he was
arrested by the police, never agitated anywhere even by
moving any application to any authority that he was not
present at crime scene. Although in cross-examination he
suggested to the Investigating Officer about such plea and
the person with whom he was present but that person was
not produced by him in his defence. He submitted a
photocopy of letter dated 19.04.2016 (Mark-A) issued by a
Private Department that was ‘Sadiq Poultry (Pvt.) Ltd.’
where it was maintained that Muhammad Nawaz had been
working at the said poultry farm, from 02.01.2016 to
21.03.2016. This document which could not be marked by
the learned trial court is having no evidentiary value. Even
if it’s original was brought on record that could not be
exhibited without appearance of the person who had issued
the same. Therefore, plea of alibi raised by Muhammad
Nawaz is of no worth at all.

38. Learned trial court while taking into consideration

the evidence from all possible angles rightly proceeded to

” The plea of having been at the time of the commission of an act elsewhere than at the place of crime
Criminal Appeal No.1577 of 2019
Muhammad Nawaz alias Nazi & another Versus The State

convict the appellants hence this Court finds no justification
to interfere in the well-reasoned impugned judgment.
39. Summing up the deliberations made above this

appeal has no merit hence it is dismissed.
