JUDGMENT

ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- At a trial held by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-III, Swabi (“Trial Court”),
in case FIR No.298 dated 09.04.2019, registered under
sections 302 & 324 PPC at Police Station Kalu Khan
District Swabi, Shahid Ali, accused having been found
guilty of committing Qatl-e-Amd of his father Hazir
Muhammad deceased and his brother-in-law (brother
of his wife), namely, Sabir Khan deceased, has been
convicted under section 302 (b) PPC and sentenced to
death on two counts as well as to pay Rs.5,00,000/-, as.
compensation in terms of section 544-A Cr-P.C. to

legal heirs of each deceased and in default thereof to
further undergo six months simple imprisonment under
each count. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. has been
extended to him.

2. Convict Shahid Ali has filed the instant Jail
Criminal Appeal against his conviction and sentences
whereas the learned trial Court has sent Murder
Reference _No.31-P/2022, for confirmation of death
sentences of the convict. As both the matters are
arising out from one and the same judgment of the
learned trial Court, therefore, we propose to decide and
answer the same through this common judgment.

3. The prosecution’s case as unfolded in First
Information Report (“FIR”) Exh.PA/1 is that on
09.04.2019 at 1505 hours, complainant Mst. Ayesha
(PW.11), in company of dead body of her husband,
namely, Sabir Khan deceased and injured namely,
Hazir Muhammad (unconscious), in casualty of Kalu
Khan hospital reported to Gul Nabi Khan ASI (PW.7)
to the effect that on the fateful day ie. 09.04.2019 she
along with her deceased husband and other inmates of
her house had come to village Managi Swabi from
Peshawar for participation in “Khatamul Quran”
ceremony; that after attending the said ceremony at
1430 hours when they entered the house of her relative
Hazir Muhammad, appellant Shahid duly armed with

pistol came out from his room and opened fire at her
husband Sabir Khan and Hazir Muhammad, as a result,
both got hit. The former died at the spot whereas the
latter was shifted to hospital. Besides her, the incident
is stated to have been witnessed by Mst. Gul Taj
PW.11 (wife of the appellant). A dispute over women
folk was a motive behind the occurrence. Report of the
complainant was reduced into writing in the shape of
Murasila Exh.PA by Gul Nabi Khan ASI(PW.7), who
prepared injury sheet and inquest report of Sabir Khan
deceased and shifted his dead body for post mortem
examination. He also prepared injury sheet of injured
Hazair Muhammad and referred him for medical
examination.

4. On 09.04.2019 at 03.15 PM, Dr. Akif
Durrani (PW.5), examined injured Hazir Muhammad
and found a firearm entry wound on his abdomen
anterior (ventral) aspect with corresponding exit
wound over back posterior (dorsal aspect). The medico
legal report furnished by him is Exh.PM. On the same
day he also conducted autopsy on the dead body of
Sabir Khan deceased and found the following injuries
on his person:-

1. Firearm entry wound of 0.5 x 0.5
cm right arm lateral aspect.
2. Firearm exit wound of 1x1 cm

right arm medial aspect.
3. Firearm entry wound of 0.5 x 0.5
cm over lateral side of chest
(thorax right side).

4. Firearm exit wound of 1xl* cm

over lateral side of chest (thorax)
left side.
Qpinion: According to his opinion the
deceased died due to damage to his heart,
lungs and major vessel due to firearm.

5. On 01.05.2019 injured Hazir Muhammad
succumbed to injuries. Dr. Muhammad Wagas (PW.9)
conducted autopsy on his dead body and observed the
following injuries on his body:

1. Entry wound of 1x1 cm in
abdomen interior — (ventral)
aspect.

2. Exit wound of 2x2 cm over back
(dorsal).

Qpinion: According to his

opinion death of the deceased

occurred due to firearm injury to

his vital organs i.e. liver and

intestine.

Probable time between injury and

death: 22 days.
6. The task of investigation was entrusted to
Mehmood Khan SI (PW.13), who after registration of
FIR, proceeded to the spot and prepared site plan
Exh.PB on the pointation of eyewitnesses. During spot
inspection, he secured blood through cotton from the

place of Sabir khan deceased vide recovery memo

Exh.PW.2/1. He also recovered one empty of 30 bore
vide recovery memo Exh.PW.2/2 and vide recovery
memo Exh.PW.2/3 he took into possession the last
worn bloodstained garments of the deceased Sabir
Khan. As the accused was absconding, therefore, he
applied for proceedings under section 204 and 87
Cr.P.C. against him, sent the bloodstained articles to
the FSL, placed on file medical treatment record of
Hazir Muhammad deceased then injured Exh.PW.13/6.
On 01.05.2019, the injured succumbed to injury, in this
regard he placed on file extract of daily diary No.10
dated 01.05.2019 Exh.PW.13/6, placed on file FSL
report regarding the bloodstained articles which is
Exh.PL. On 19.04.2019, he recorded statement of
deceased then injured Hazir Muhammad under section
161 Cr.P.C. and on completion of investigation handed
over case file to SHO who submitted challan under
section 512 Cr.P.C. against the appellant.

7. On 12.11.2019 the appellant was arrested
vide arrest card Exh.PW.8/1. Syed Jamil Khan
Inspector (PW.10), obtained his physical remand,
interrogated him and recorded his statement under
section 161 Cr.P.C. On pointation of the appellant, he
recovered a 30 bore pistol having fixed magazine
containing 3 live rounds from a cloth box lying in his
residential room, who disclosed the same to be the

crime weapon. He took into possession the pistol
through recovery memo Exh.PW.4/1 and prepared
sketch of the place of recovery Exh.PB/1. He sent the
pistol along with crime empty to the FSL, report
whereof is Exh.PL. After completion of investigation
he handed over case file to SHO, who submitted
supplementary challan against the appellant before the
learned trial court.

8. On receipt of challan by the learned trial
court, the appellant was summoned and formally
charge sheeted to which he pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. To prove its case, the prosecution
examined fifteen witnesses. After closure of the
prosecution’s evidence statement of the appellant was
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein he denied
the prosecution’s allegation and professed his
innocence. He, however, neither wished to be
examined on oath under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor
opted to produce evidence in defence. On conclusion
of trial, the leamed trial court, after hearing both the
sides convicted and sentenced the appellant as
mentioned in the initial paragraph of the judgment,
hence, this appeal and murder reference.

9. We have heard the exhaustive submission of
learned counsel for the parties advanced at the bar and
perused the evidence and record with their valuable

assistance.
10. In this case the ocular account of the
incident has furnished by Mst. Gul Taj PW.12 (who is
the widow of appellant and sister of Sabir Khan
deceased) and Mst. Ayesha PW.11 (who is the
complainant and widow of Sabir Khan deceased),
Besides Sabir Khan deceased, the appellant is also
charged for committing murder of his real father,
namely, Hazir Muhammad deceased. Apart from the
ocular account, the prosecution has also relied upon
the statement of deceased then injured Hazir
Muhammad recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C. as a
dying declaration.

11. First we are taking for discussion the ocular
account of the prosecution’s case. Record depicts that
occurrence in this case has taken place inside the house
of appellant situated in village Managi Swabi on
09.04.2019 at 1430 hours, which has been reported
with promptitude at 1505 hours i.e. within 35 minutes
by Mst. Ayesha widow of Sabir Khan deceased in
casualty of Kalu Khan Hospital. In her report
Exh.PA/1, the complainant has categorically
mentioned that besides her the incident is witnessed by
Mst. Gul Taj. The complainant while appearing as
PW.11 has furnished ocular account of the incident in

the following words:-
“Deceased Sabir Khan was my husband. PW
Mst. Gul Taj is wife of accused facing trial
Shahid while sister of Sabir Khan deceased.
Mst. Sahibzadgai (now dead) was mother of
Sabir Khan deceased. Hazir Muhammad was
father of accused facing trial Shahid.

On the day of occurrence I along with my
deceased husband Sabir Khan and other family
members came to village Managi for
participating in “Khatmul Quran”. After
completion of the said function, we went to the
residence of our relative Hazir Muhammad
deceased. We reached the residence of the said
person at 2.30 PM. When we entered into the
house, accused facing trial came out from his
room armed with pistol and started firing at my
husband Sabir Khan and Hazir Muhammad, as a
result, my husband got hit and died on the spot,
while father of accused Hazir Muhammad
sustained injuries. I charge accused for the
offence. Motive behind the occurrence was a
dispute over women folk. Besides me, Mst. Gul
Taj, wife of the accused facing trial, and
Mst. Sahibzadgai (now dead) are the eyewitness
of the occurrence. 1 had lodged the report at
Kalu Khan hospital which is signed by me and
also verified by one Nasir Iqbal. Today I have
seen my signature on the Murasila already

exhibited as Exh.PA which is correct. Later on,
the 1.0, had also prepared the site plan at my

instance.”
12. Another eyewitness, namely, Mst. Gul Taj,
wife of the appellant, when appeared in the witness
box as PW.12 deposed as under:-

“Accused facing trial Shahid is my husband.
Deceased Sabir Khan was my brother and
deceased Hazir Muhammad was my father-in-
law. PW Mst. Ayesha is widow of deceased
Sabir Khan.

My marriage was solemnized with

accused facing trial_10 years prior to the
occurrence and from this wedlock I have two
daughters and one son. After attending the
function of Khatamul Quran in the house of one
Salim Khan, I proceeded to my house. After
some time of my arrival, my brother Sabir Khan
deceased along with his wife Mst. Ayesha and
mother Sahibzadgai also came to my house. As
soon they reached our house in the meantime
my husband Shahid came out from his room
duly armed with pistol and started firing upon
Sabir Khan deceased and Hazir Muhammad, as
a result of which both got hit, amongst whom
Sabir Khan died on the spot while Hazir
Muhammad sustained injuries. Motive behind
the occurrence was that Aunt of accused Shahid,
namely, Mst. Samina was demanding hands of
my sister Mst. Musarrat for her son Aziz. The

accused facing trial was also in favour of the
10

same, however, my parents were not agree. Iam
eyewitness of the occurrence. My statement was
recorded by the I.O. on the spot. I also pointed
out the spot to the IO. I charge the accused
facing trial Shahid my husband for commission

of the offence.”
13. Both the above named eyewitnesses have
been subjected to lengthy and taxing cross-
examination by a skillful hand but nothing favourable
to defence or adverse to the prosecution could be
extracted from their mouths. They have furnished
straightforward and truthful account of the occurrence.
They have also established their presence at the spot at
the time of occurrence. The occurrence has taken place
at 1430 hours inside the house of the appellant where
he along with her wife Mst. Gul Taj (PW.12) and his
father Hazir Muhammad deceased were residing.
Mst. Gul Taj (PW.12) is the sister of Sabir Khan
deceased. In this view of the matter, visit of deceased
Sabir Khan along with his wife Mst. Ayesha (PW.11)
on the day of occurrence to the house of the appellant,
is appealable to a prudent mind as such close relatives
as a routine do visit the house of each other on the
occasions of marriage, engagement and Khatamul
Quran ceremony etc. Being a broad daylight
occurrence and PW Mst.Gul Taj being his wife,

question of mistaken identity of the appellant does not
11

arise. Eyewitness Mst. Gul Taj (PW.12), in her
statement has stated that her marriage with the
appellant had taken place some 10 years back and from
the wedlock she has a son and two daughters. She was
still residing with the appellant in his house, meaning
thereby, that relation between appellant and Mst. Gul
Taj (PW.12) was cordial, therefore, question of his
false implication and substitution of the appellant for
the real culprit by her wife seems next to impossible.
Even otherwise, it does not appeal to a prudent mind
that Mst. Gul Taj will charge her husband falsely so as
to destitute her three minor children from the shadow
and shelter of their father.

14. The ocular account furnished , by
Mst. Ayesha (PW.11) and Mst. Gul Taj (PW.12) is
corroborated by recovery of blood from the spot, the
last worn bloodstained garments of the deceased and
positive Serologist report Exh.PK in respect thereof.
Similarly, medical evidence furnished by Dr. Akif
Durrani (PW.5) and Dr. Muhammad Wagas (PW.9),
also supports their testimony. The firearm entrance
wounds on the persons of both the deceased being that
of one and the same dimension are sufficient to prove
the occurrence to be the job of single person.

15. The prosecution has also proved motive

behind the occurrence through the testimony of
12

eyewitnesses Mst. Ayesha (PW.11) and Mst. Gul Taj
(PW.12). Both are unanimous in their statement that
motive behind the occurrence was that Mst. Samina
(Aunt of the appellant) was demanding hand of
Mst. Musarrat (sister of Mst. Gul Taj) for her son Aziz
and appellant was also in favour of the said Rishta,
however, parents of Mst. Musarrat were not willing to
accept the said demand. Admittedly, deceased Sabir
Khan was the brother of the said Musarrat.

16. Yet there is another strong circumstantial
piece of evidence which also corroborates the ocular
account of the prosecution’s case. Undeniably, Hazir
Muhammad deceased was real father of the appellant.
The occurrence has taken place on 09.04.2019,
whereas the appellant after the occurrence went into
hiding and was arrested on 12.11.2019. He has neither
bothered to lodge any report about the occurrence nor
visited to see his injured father in the hospital nor
opted to give shoulder to the casket of his deceased
father. No explanation, much less, plausible has been
furnished by him so as to justify his absence in the
above events. The unexplained abscondence of the
appellant indicates towards his guilty mind and
corroborates the ocular account.

17. So far as FSL report Exh.PK qua the crime

30 bore empty and pistol shown recovered on the
13

pointation of the appellant is concerned, no doubt, the
same is in the negative, but mere this single piece of
corroborative evidence would not be sufficient for
discarding the overwhelming ocular account of the
prosecution’s case which is reliable, truthful and
confidence inspiring evidence. In this case, the ocular
account furmished by the eyewitnesses being
trustworthy and confidence inspiring is believable,
therefore, in such eventuality there would be hardly
need of any corroboratory pieces of evidence which
are always taken into consideration as a matter of
caution. In this regard we would rely on the judgment

of the Hon’ble apex court in case titled, “Amal Sherin

and another Vs the State 22 through A.G. NWFP”
PLD 2003 Supreme Court 371), wherein it has been
held that:-

“Conviction in a criminal case can be
recorded even on the statements of
eyewitnesses alone without there being
any corroboration provided _ their
evidence inspires confidence”.

Similar is the view of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
case titled, “Mst. Sughara Begum and another Vs
Qaisar Pervez and others” (2015 SCMR 1142) in the

following words:-

“Qcular_ account _in case of ‘Qatl-e-
Amd’ plays a decisive and vital role
14

and once its intrinsic worth is accepted
and _believed_then the _rest_of the

evidence, both circumstantial

corroboratory in nature, is required as
@ matter of caution, but to the contrary,
once the ocular account is disbelieved,
then no other evidence, even of a high
degree and value, would be sufficient
for recording conviction on a capital
charge, therefore, probative value of the
ocular account is to be seen in light of

the facts and circumstances of each

7

case”.

18. Yet there is another aspect of the
prosecution’s case. Admittedly, Hazir Muhammad
deceased, on receipt of injuries became unconscious,
therefore, the incident was reported by complainant
Mst. Ayesha. He was examined by Dr. Akif Durrani
who noticed a firearm entry wound on his abdomen
anterior (ventral) aspect with corresponding exit
wound over his back. The injured remained
hospitalized for 22 days. During the period of said 22
days when he came into senses, on 19.04.2019, his
statement was recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C. by
Sultan Mehmood Khan (PW.13), whereafter on
01.05.2019, he succumbed to injuries. The said
statement of deceased then injured has been brought on

record by Sultan Mehmood Khan (PW.13) in his
15

statement, who is its scriber. The deceased then injured
in his statement while reiterating the same story of
incident as stated by the eyewitnesses has singularly
and directly charged his real son Shahid Ali, the
appellant, for commission of the offence and has
advanced the same motive behind the occurrence that
his sister Mst. Samina (Aunt of the appellant) was
demanding the hand of Musarrat, sister of Sabir Khan
deceased, for her son Aziz. The appellant was also in
favour of the said offer, but Sabir Khan deceased and
his parents were not willing, which resulted into the
present occurrence. Statement of deceased then injured
under section 161 Cr.P.C. has been objected by the
defence at the time of its production on the ground that
it being a statement under section 161 Cr.P.C. is part
of investigation, hence, cannot be transferred or read as
evidence against the accused. We are not convinced to
subscribe to the objection of the learned defence
counsel in light of ratio of judgment of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in case titled, “Mst. Shamim Akhtar vs
Fiaz_ Akhtar and two_ others” (PLD 1992 Supreme
Court 211), wherein while dealing with identical
situation, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in paragraphs
No.25 and 26 of the judgment has held that:-

“25, The law does not prescribe any special
mode of recording the dying declaration, The
16

statement of an injured recorded by _ the
police under section 161 Cr.P.C. during the
course of investigation is not hit by section

162 Cr.P.C. As such the dying declaration is a
good piece of evidence and it can be relied
upon by the prosecution. It is not necessary for
the admissibility of dying declaration that the
deceased at the time of making it should have

been under expectancy of death. A statement

under section 161 Cr.P.C. of an injured is
an_admissible_evidence even though the
injured _had_ died much later. The dying

declaration is to be adjudged on its own
merits. In this case the learned High Court
erred in law in discarding the statement of
Mst. Nasim Akhtar. Her statement is a
substantive piece of evidence and can easily
be used against the accused and there is
nothing to suggest that the deceased had
substituted an innocent person in place of real
culprit. Statement by a dying person about the
circumstances of his death is admissible under
section 32(1) of the Evidence Act. It becomes
substantive pieces of evidence if it is
trustworthy. In the present case, there is
harmony between the dying declaration and
other pieces of evidence. There is no room for
doubt that it is not false. Due weight has to be
attached to the truth of declaration made by

the deceased.
17

26. In Wazir Gul vs the State (1976
SCMR 471) it has been observed that “the
dying declaration need not be made under
immediate apprehension of death”. Law does
not insist that for the purpose of being treated
a dying declaration the statement should have
been made under immediate apprehension of
death. We cannot import into statutory
provision any such extraneous limitation. In
the absence of statutory requirement in this
regard the last incriminating statement made
by the deceased could be legitimately treated
as dying declaration. Similar view was taken
in Muhammad Aslam vs the State (PLD 1978
SC 298), Niamat Ali vs the State (1981 SCMR
61) and Noor Muhammad vs the State (1988
SCMR 1640).”

19. In this case, the testimony of Sultan
Mehmood Khan (PW.13), scriber of statement under
section 161 Cr.P.C. of the deceased then injured, has
remained unchallenged and un-shattered to the effect
that the deceased then injured was not in a position to
make a statement. Keeping in view the ocular account
of two eyewitnesses out of whom one is the wife of the
appellant coupled with the status of deceased then
injured, who was none else but real father of the
appellant, in these peculiar circumstances, the learned

trial court has rightly taken into account the statement
18

of deceased then injured under section 161 Cr.P.C. as a
dying declaration, in addition to the ocular account for
the purpose of conviction of the appellant.

20. On reappraisal of the evidence, we have
reached to an irresistible conclusion that the
prosecution has proved murder of Sabir Khan deceased
and Hazir Muhammad deceased with firearm by the
appellant through cogent, reliable and confidence
inspiring ocular account and dying declaration of the
deceased then injured, corroborated by strong
circumstantial pieces of evidence and supported by
medical evidence. We see no mitigating circumstance
to warrant reduction in the sentences of the appellant.
21. Accordingly, this appeal stands dismissed.
Conviction and sentences of the appellant recorded by
the learned trial court vide judgment dated 06.12.2022
are upheld and maintained.

22. Murder Reference No.31-P of 2022, sent by
the learned Trial Court for confirmation of death sentences

of the appellant is answered in the Affirmative.
