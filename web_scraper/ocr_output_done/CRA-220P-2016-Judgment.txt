WIQAR AHMAD, J.- Through this single judgment,
we intend to decide this criminal appeal bearing No.
220-P/2016 as well as connected criminal revisions
bearing No. 42-P and 83-P of 2016, as all these
matters emanate from one and the same judgment

Sessions Judge IV Kohat, in case F.I.R No. 48 dated
25.02.2012 registered under section 302 of the

2. As per prosecution story, on 25.02.2012
at 13:05 hours Nisar Islam, IHC along with other
police ‘Nafri’ were on routine patrolling of the area,
when they received information about presence of a
dead body at KDA hospital Kohat. When they.
reached KDA hospital, uncle of the deceased Siraj
who was present with the dead body, lodged the
report to the effect that he along with his nephew
Farman were riding on a motorcycle, whereas
Naimat Jamal (deceased) was riding another
motorcycle and were going towards sector 1 of
KDA. Naimat Jamal was a few paces ahead of them
and when the complainant-party reached near gate
No. 1 of KDA, the accused/appellant Zahid Hameed
who was already present there, drew out his pistdl
and started firing upon Naimat Jamal. Due to firing
of the accused, the deceased fell down from his
motorcycle and died at the spot. The complainant
also advanced a specific motive which was stated to
be a dispute over woman-folk. The ‘Murasila’ was
drafted in the hospital and was sent to the police
station for registration of FIR and accordingly the

subject FIR was registered against the accused at the

Nawab (0.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
police station concerned. .

3. Investigation was started in the case by
the local police of police station KDA Kohat and on
conclusion of the same, complete challan was put in
Court. During trial, the prosecution produced as
many as twelve (12) witnesses whose statements
were recorded and placed on file. On close of the
prosecution evidence, accused/appellant was
examined under section 342, Cr.P.C, who denied the
charges in general terms and took the defence of
insanity of mind. He opted to produce evidence in
his defence under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C and
requested for summoning of Lt. Col. Dr. Sohail Ali,
who was stated to have treated the acoused at CMH
Kohat earlier. By then he had got transferred fr
CMH Kohat and his attendance could not be
procured, however one Maj. Syed Shah Khalid
appeared and stated before the learned trial Court
that as per their policy five years old record is
destroyed, therefore, no record of treatment of
appellant was found in the CMH, he, however, has

produced a certificate which was placed on file.

Nawab (0.8.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
4, On conclusion of the trial, the learned
Additional Sessions Judge Kohat, convicted and
sentenced the accused/appellant for life
imprisonment and fine, as stated above, vide the
judgment impugned herein.

5. The learned counsel for the
accused/appellant restricted his arguments to the
defence of unsoundness of mind of the accused and
submitted in alternative that the accused/appellant is
also entitled to the benefit of section 302 (c) PPC. In
support of the aforementioned stance, he argued that
when the accused was examined by the medical
board on 25.04.2013 he was not found capable of
facing trial because of his mental illness.
Subsequently, on 13.03.2014 the accused wa

re-examined through another medical board, who
opined that the accused was capable of facing trial,
wherafter, trial of the accused was resumed. The
learned counsel also drew our attention towards the
answers given to questions No. 13,14 and 15 by the
accused in his statement recorded under section 342
Cr.P.C and submitted that the accused had taken the

defence of unsoundness of mind as he had been

Nawab {D.B.} Hon'ble Mr. Justice [kramullah Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
suffering from Schizophrenia at the relevant time.
The learned counsel also placed reliance on the
statement of Dr. Muhammad Tariq recorded as CW-
1 and a certificate of treatment produced from CMH
Kohat as weil as the documents produced by the
accused in his statement recorded under section 342
Cr.P.C and contended that all the evidence
establishes the fact that the accused had committed
the offence under a delusionary state of mind
produced by his disease of Schizophrenia, which
stood proved on the record.
6. The learned counsel for the complaifant
vehemently opposed the learned counsel for the
accused/appellant and submitted that the
circumstances in which the offence had been
committed coupled with the existence of a motive on
part of the accused shows that the accused had
committed the offence with a definite intention and
making of mind which would never have been
possible, had the accused suffered from
Schizophrenia. He did not, however, lay much stress
on his revision for enhancement of the sentence of

the accused in the circumstances of the case. Same

Nawab {0.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice {kramullah Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad

was the case with the learned Additional Advocate
General, who adopted the arguments of the learned
counsel for complainant and added that the accused
had committed the offence in a planned manner and
thus he had rightly been convicted by the learned
trial Court. He did not lay much stress also on the
revision petition filed by the State for enhancement
of the sentence.

7. We have heard arguments of the learned
counsel for the accused/appellant, learned counsel
for the complainant, learned A.A.G appearing on
behalf of the State and gone through the record of 7
the case with their able assistance.

8. Perusal of the record reveals that the
accused/appellant has been directly named by the
complainant in a promptly lodged FIR for the
commission of the offence. The version of
prosecution is also supported by ocular testimony of
the eye-witness Siraj, who is complainant of the
present case and testified as PW-9. While the other
eye-witness of the occurrence namely Farman was
abandoned by the prosecution. Soon after the occurrence,

when the accused was on the run he was arrested

Nawab = (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
and weapon of offence was also recovered from him.
The weapon of offence was sent to the FSL along
with the 4 empties recovered from the spot and one
crime bullet. The Forensic Science Laboratory vide
its two separate reports Ex. PW- 2/1 and Ex. PW-2/2
confirmed that the crime bullet recovered from the
body of the deceased as well as 4 empties recovered
from the spot had been fired from the 9 mm pistol
recovered from the accused soon after the
occurrence. The arrest and recovery of weapon of
offence stood proved on record. The accused had
also confessed his guilt before the Court of learned
Judicial Magistrate Kohat. Mr. Ikramullah, Judicial
Magistrate-V Kohat also testified in support of the
confessional statement of the accused as PW-8.
Nothing favouable to the accused could be extracte;
from his mouth during the course of crdss-
examination. In circumstances of the case given
above, the prosecution have been successful to prove
guilt of the accused beyond any shadow of doubt
through direct as well as corroborative evidence.

9, While analyzing the evidence relating to

the defence of unsoundness of mind, it is important

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ikramuliah Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Anmad

to note that the accused was shown to have been
suffering from a mental disease namely

Schizophrenia. “F.C. Redlich & Daniel xX.

Freedman _in “The theory and Practice _of

Psychiatry” (1966 Edition)” describes the varying
degree of intensity of illness and its nature in the
following words;

Some schizophrenic reactions, which we call
psychoses, may be relatively mild and
transient; others may not interfere too
seriously with many aspects of everyday living

Calcutta High Court in the case’ of

“Smt. Rita Roy v/s _Sitesh Chandra __AIR_1982

(Calcutta) 138” held that each case of
Schizophrenia has to be considered on its own
merits. The doctor while appearing as CW-1 has also
explained the nature of the illness of the accused i.e.
Schizophrenia, during the cross-examination
conducted by the learned counsel for the
accused/appellant in the following words;

“It is correct that as per medical
literature Schizophrenia is chronic
service brain disorder in which the
patient hears voices believe the media
and broadcast the. words that someone is
trying to harm him. Self-stated that all
these symptoms are not necessarily
present in every Schizophrenia patient. It
is correct that there are chances that
Schizophrenia patient may not

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-10-

differentiate between reality and
imagination. It is correct that at time
Schizophrenia patient loses touch with
reality. It is correct that Schizophrenia is
not completely curable however it is a
treatable disorder though it is not 100%
curable, It is correct that Schizophrenia
patient can face relapse at any time and
he can lose his touch with reality.”

When the doctor was cross-examined
by the learned counsel for the complainant, the said
witness further elaborated the disease of
Schizophrenia as follows;

“It is correct that at the time of my latest
examination, I have found the accused
mentally stable and capable of facing
trial. It is correct that medical board has
assured that accused was mentally fit.
There are two hormonal changes during
Schizophrenia. Schizophrenia can be
episodic as well as chronic. It is correct
that the interval between disorder cannot
be determined by doctor. It may be long
or short. It is correct that the disorder
like post-traumatic stress disorder, stress
induced psychosis, can occur after some
horrifying accident. There is possibility
that the accused is suffered from menta
disorder due to the occurrence, he h
been charged for.”

It is clear that the nature of disease from
which the accused/appellant was suffering was not
permanent in nature. It has sufficiently been
explained in the medical literature as well as dictums
of the Hon’ble superior courts that the disease of
Schizophrenia is occasional and comes in durations

Nawab (0.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-11-

and intervals. In this regard, reliance is placed on the

case of “Mst. Safia Bano_v/s Home Department
Govt: of Punjab and others” reported as “PLD 2017
Supreme Court 18”, wherein the Hon’ble Court

formed the following view;

Thus, schizophrenia is not a permanent
mental disorder, rather imbalance, increasing
or decreasing, depending the level of stress. In
recent years, the prognosis has been improved
with drugs, by vigorous psychological and
social managements, and rehabilitation. It is,
therefore, a recoverable disease, which, in all
the cases, does not fall within the definition of
"mental disorder" as defined in the Mental
Health Ordinance, 2001,

10. From the evidence particularly’ the
statement of CW-I including cross-examinations
conducted by the accused and complainant side, it is
proved rather an admitted position that the accused
in the instant case had been living a normal life with
the aid of psychiatric treatment and medications.
There has to be intervals in his life when he was not
in control of his senses while on the other occasion
he happened to be a normal individual. In such a
situation, the burden of proof lay on the accused to
establish that he had been suffering from lunacy at
the crucial time of commission of the offence and

that he had lost control of his senses at the relevant

Nawab {D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad

-12-

time. Unsoundness of mind, has been brought in
general exceptions from acquiring criminal liability
by section 84 PPC. The burden of proof for
establishing the fact that a case falls under the
general exceptions lies on the persons taking the
defennce thereof. Reliance in this respect is placed on
the case of “Iftikhar Ahmad_v/s The State” reported
as “2005 SCMR 272”

11. Now we have to see that whether’ the
accused/appellant has been successful in proving that
he had been suffering from insanity at the time of
commission of the offence or not. In this respect,
he has once been examined by a medical board
pursuant to the application submitted by the learned
counsel appearing on his behalf in the trial Court. The
said examination was carried on 25.04.2013, the report
of which was produced before the trial Court as
CW-1/1. The said report is reproduced as under for
ready reference;

“The Standing Medical Board is of the
opinion that the accused suffers from
chronic Schizophrenia. He is still thought
disorder, deluded, He needs treatment in a
secure place prison. At the moment, he
does not understands the nature of crime, it
consequences, proceedings of the Court
and is unfit to plead in the Court of law. He
will be reviewed by the board after six

Nawab (0.8.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice tkramullah Khan
Hon’‘ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-13-

months. Due to potential risk of
dangerness, he possess to the family and
public, he needs to be secure unit like
prison.”

Later on, on 13.03.2014 the accused was

re-examined and found fit for facing trial by the
competent medical board, report of which was placed
on file as Ex. CW-1/4. Opinion of the said medical
board is reproduced hereunder as follows;

“Standing medical board is of the opinion
that accused suffers from chronic
Schizophrenia illness which a major
mental disease. The accused has been on
anti-psychotic medication for the last one
year. The accused has responded to
medication. At the moment, the accused is
in remission. He understands the nature of
his crime, its consequences and court
proceedings. Therefore, he is fit to plead in
the Court of law. However, Schizophrenia
illness is chronic and relapsing illness. The
accused needs to be on anti-psychotic
medication for foreseeable future. The
Hon’ble Court may dispose of his case
under relevant act.”

It was in-fact after report of the seyond
medical board on 13.03.2014 when the trial of the
accused was conducted, during which, no further
objection was ever raised regarding mental condition of
the accused/appellant till conclusion of the trial and even
thereafter.

12. The accused/appellant in order to prove the
fact of lunacy relied upon the statement of CW-1, a

certificate produced by one Maj. Syed Shah Khalid

Nawab = (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice tkramullah Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-14-

before the learned trial Court and available on page No.
90 of the paper book of appeal and the record of medical

treatment exhibited as D-1 (consisting of 16 sheets) by

* the accused in his statement recorded under section 342

Cr.P.C. From none of the evidence mentioned above, it
could be ascertained that at the time of commission of
offence the accused had been suffering from insanity or
unsoundness of mind so as to enable him to bring his |
case under the ambit of general exceptions as provided
by section 84 of the PPC. CW-1 in his examination-in-
chief has narrated stories of the constitution and

proceedings of the two medical boards constituted in the

case in hand. From his cross-examinations, as stated
earlier, one fact is evident that the accused was sufferi ig
from Schizophrenia, which produced delusional state of
mind at times with substantial intervals. When the
accused was not suffering from the said state of mind
then he used to be a normal person. He also stated in the
cross-examination conducted by the learned counsel for
the complainant that at the time of the last examination
of the accused he had been found mentally stable and
capable of facing trial. From the statement of CW-1 it
could nowhere be gathered that at the time of
commission of the offence the accused had been
suffering from insanity. The record of medical treatment

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-15-

exhibited by the accused as D-I coupled with a certificate
produced by Maj. Syed Shah Khalid establishes the
. fact only that the accused had been suffering from
chronic Schizophrenia and it did not establish the fact
that the accused had been suffering from phenomena
of unsoundness of mind at the time of commission of
the offence. The burden of proof that lied on the
accused/appellant for acquiring the benefit of section
84 PPC could not be discharged by him. The
circumstances of the case also show that the offence
was committed in a well thought out manner and with
a definite intention of mind. The accused had armed
himself with a 9 mm pistol, traveled a considerable
distance from the place of his residence to a place
where the presence of the complainant and deceased
was expected, positioned himself, aimed at his target
and achieved his objectives. Motive was also existing
on his part. He has given a complete and correct
narration of the occurrence, motive and
developments taking place at that time and after the
occurrence, in his confessional statement, Ex. PW-8/ 1.
He has also replied the questions put to him by the
Magistrate and recorded in the memorandum of

inquiry Ex. PW-8/2. All the attending circumstances

Nawab (0.B.) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ikramullah Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-16-

and the evidence thereof produced in the case in hand
shows that the accused had not been suffering from the
lunatic interval at the time of the commission of the
offence.

13. Regarding the stance for extending the
benefit of section 302 (c) PPC to the accused, it is
important to mention that the accused was found to
have committed the offence in a well thought out
manner and with a definite motive and intention at the
time when he had not been suffering from a delusional
state of mind. The fact that the accused had been
suffering from mental disease generally has been taken
into account by the learned trial Court and considered
it as a mitigating circumstance in fixing the sentence of 4
the accused. He has not been awarded the normal /
penalty of death and his sentence was chosen to be life
imprisonment by the learned trial Court due to the only
reason that the accused had been suffering from mental
illness generally. In the circumstances of the case, we
do not find any reason to treat the case of the
accused/appellant under section 302 (c) PPC.

14. For the reasons mentioned above, the
sentence of life imprisonment has rightly been

awarded to the appellant/accused by the learned trial

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-17-

Court, no justification exists for enhancing the
sentence either. Resultantly, the appeal in hand as well
as criminal revisions bearing No. 42-P and 83-P of

2016 are also dismissed.
