SYED MUHAMAMD ATTIQUE SHAH, J:- This

appeal is directed under section 410 Cr.P.C against
the judgment dated 28/04/2018 passed by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-I Mansehra, whereby, the
appeal filed by the appellant against his conviction
and sentence awarded to him by the learned Judicial
Magistrate vide judgment dated 23.04.2018 in case
FIR No. 176 dated 22/04/2018 under Articles 3/4 of
Prohibition (linforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979,
Police Station Saddar, District Mansehra.

Qe Facts leading to the instant appeal are that on
22/04/2018 at about 18:55 hours, complainant
Muhammad Naseem Khan, SHO Police Station
Saddar, Manschra, was on ‘gusht’ alongwith police

officials on Balakot Road, when he received spy
information about selling of narcotics by a person in
“Sanday Sar Ziarat’; that he reached the spot and
found a person sitting there in suspicious condition,
who was overpowered by the police officials; that as a
result of search, he was found in possession of 720
grams ‘charas’ kept in a shopping bag lying in his
lap, who subsequently, disclosed his name as
Muhammad Khursheed son of Muhammad Aslam.
The complainant separated sample of five grams from
the recovered contraband for chemical analysis and
arrested the accused in the case.

3. After completion of investigation, challan was
submitted in the court of learned Judicial Magistrate
for trial. However, the appellant submitted an
application, wherein, he has waived off his rights
under Section 241-A Cr.P.C. Accordingly, charge
was framed to which the appellant pleaded guilty and
did not claim trial, followed by Show Cause Notice as
provided under section 243 Cr.P.C, however, the
appellant placed himself at the mercy of the Court.
Consequently, the appellant was convicted and
sentenced to one month under Article 4 P.O, while,

two months imprisonment and to pay a fine of
Rs.2,000/- or in default thereof, he was sentenced to
undergo simple imprisonment for 10 days, under
Article 3 P.O., vide impugned judgment dated
23/04/2018. The said conviction was challenged by
the appellant before learned Additional Sessions
Judge-I, Mansehra, which was dismissed vide
judgment dated 28.04.2018, hence, the instant appeal.

4, Arguments of the learned counsel for the
parties heard and perused the record with their
valuable assistance.

5. In this case, the appellant had admitted his
guilt qua selling and possessing ‘charas’ and declined
to produce any evidence. It is a common practice that
once a person who is involved in a criminal case
wants to plead guilty to the charge leveled against him
and placed himself at the mercy of the Court and in
that eventuality he become a friend of the Court and
the Court always takes lenient view in respect of his
sentence. Since the appellant, in the instant case, had
straight away placed himself at the mercy of the trial
Court and pleaded guilty, therefore, the trial Court has
rightly taken a lenient view in respect of his sentence.

Furthermore, once the appellant pleads guilty under
section 265-E, Cr.P.C, then he is barred under section
412, Cr.P.C. to challenge his conviction and sentence
by filing appeal. He could only challenge the extent or
legality of the sentence. There is no reason how, after
submission of complete challan and appearance in the
trial Court, the appellant could remain unaware that if
he made statement in the Court in the proceedings it
could result in his conviction and sentence on his own
plea of guilty.

6. Now the matter which is to be considered by
this Court is only the extent and legality of the
sentence awarded to the appellant by the learned trial
Court. While going through the memo of appeal filed
by the appellant before the learned Appellate Court,
this Court notes that the appellant has challenged the
extent and legality of the sentence but in an implied
manner. ‘Thus, this Court considers that in peculiar
facts and circumstances of the present case,
especially, when the appellant is first offender, not
previously convicted and the only bread carner of his
family, moderate reduction in the quantum of

sentence would certainly meets the interest of justice.
7. It may be mentioned that though under section
412 Cr.P.C, appeal does not lie in case of plead guilty,
except as to the extent or legality of the sentence.
However, the appellant has filed appeal before the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, Mansehra, which
was dismissed but again the appellant has filed second
appeal before this Court, which is not maintainable.
However, in the interest of justice, this appeal is
converted into revision petition under section 439
Cr.P.C.

8. Accordingly, for the reasons _ stated
hereinabove, this Court while exercising powers under
section 439 read with section 423 Cr.P.C, partially
allows the present revision petition in the manner that
the conviction of the appellant is maintained,
however, the sentence awarded to him in the present
case is modified to the extent that the same is reduced

to the period he has already undergone.
