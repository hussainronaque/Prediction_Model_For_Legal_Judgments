ISHTIAQ_ IBRAHIM, J:-This single judgment in
the instant criminal appeal by convict/appellant, Shah
Hussain, is also directed to dispose of Criminal
Revision No.86-P/2021 under section 439 Cr.P.C for
enhancement of the sentence of life imprisonment
awarded to the convict/appellant and Criminal
Appeal No.505-P/2021 filed by  appellant/
complainant Muhammad Farooq against acquittal of
co-accused Jehangir as both the criminal appeals and

criminal revision pertain to the same case vide F.I.R
No.540 dated 16.11.2017 under sections 302/324/34
PPC registered in Police Station Mathani, Peshawar.

2. Brief facts of the prosecution case are that
complainant Muhammad Farooq son of Muhammad
Hanif aged about 24/25 years brought the dead body
of his brother namely Muhammad Irfan Ullah aged
about 20/21 years in a private Suzuki to the Police
Station Mattani and reported that on the day of
occurrence he alongwith his deceased brother
Muhammad Irfan Ullah had left their house and were
going towards Passani Bazar on motorbike (United
company and applied for registration) which was
being driven by the deceased, when they reached to
the spot, at 12:15 hours, accused, namely, Jehangir
son of Muhammad Noor alias Hawaldar, Saeed Ullah
son of Jalat Khan and Shah Hussain, their co-
villagers who were already present there duly armed
with firearms, on seeing them started firing with the
intention to commit their gatl-i-amd, as a result
whereof he/complainant escaped unhurt while his
brother deceased Muhammad Irfan Ullah was hit and
died on the spot with the firing of Jehangir. The

complainant could do nothing being empty handed.
Motive behind the occurrence was stated to be
dispute over womenfolk. The complainant charged
all the three accused for the murder of his brother
deceased Muhammad Irfan Ullah and for ineffective
firing at his life. The report of the complainant was
reduced into the shape of FIR Ex.PW3/1.

3. After registration of the case, initially challan
u/s 512 Cr.P.C was submitted against all the accused
after compliance of formalities u/s 204 and 87
Cr.P.C. After arrest of accused Saeed Ullah and Shah
Hussain, supplementary challan against them was
submitted by the prosecution. Accused Saeed Ullah
and Shah Hussain were summoned who appeared
before the Court on bail and the provisions of section
265-C Cr.P.C were complied while proceedings u/s
512 Cr.P.C was initiated against accused Jehangir as
he was absconding. Thereafter, accused Saeed Ullah
has died due to his natural death and proceedings
against him was abated vide order dated 02.04.2019.
Subsequently, accused Jehangir was arrested in the
case and supplementary challan against him was
submitted. Accused Jehangir was summoned who

was produced before the Court in custody and the
Ss

provision of section 265-C Cr.P.C was complied
with. Formal charge against accused Jehangir and
Shah Hussain was framed to which they pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution was
directed to produce its evidence. In support of its
case, the prosecution produced and examined eleven
(11) witnesses.

4. After prosecution closed its evidence,
statements of the accused were recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein, they refuted allegations
of the prosecution and claimed their innocence. After
hearing of arguments of learned Dy.P.P assisted by
learned counsel for the complainant and learned
counsel for accused, the learned trial
Court/Additional Sessions Judge/Model Criminal
Trial Court, Peshawar, rendered the impugned
judgment dated 24.05.2021, whereby, appellant Shah
Hussain was convicted u/s 302 (b) PPC for
committing murder of Muhammad Irfan Ullah
(deceased) and sentenced to undergo imprisonment
for life. He shall also be liable to pay compensation
under section 544-A Cr.P.C to the tune of

Rs.500,000/-(rupees five lacs) to the legal heirs of
the deceased or in default to further undergo for
simple imprisonment for three (03) years. Benefit of
section 382 (B) Cr.P.C was also extended to
appellant-convict Shah Hussain, hence criminal
appeal for his acquittal by appellant-convict, and
criminal revision for enhancement of the sentence by
the petitioner/complainant. The learned trial Court
acquitted co-accused Jehangir, hence criminal appeal
No.505-P/2021 was filed by appellant/complainant
Muhammad Farooq for setting aside the impugned
judgment and to convict the acquitted co-accused
Jehangir.

5. Arguments of learned counsel for the
appellant and learned AAG assisted by learned
counsel for the complainant heard; and record gone
through with their valuable assistance.

6. The core question for determination before us
is that as to whether the prosecution has been able to
establish the presence of complainant Muhammad
Farooq at the spot with the deceased at the time of
occurrence beyond shadow of reasonable doubt. In
this case, as per F.I.R the deceased was riding the

motorbike and the complainant was pillion with him.
As per version of the complainant, they were
proceeding from their house to Passani Bazar and on
the way they were fired at by accused i.e. appellant
Shah Hussain, Jehangir (acquitted co-accused) and
Saeed Ullah (dead co-accused) who were already
present on the spot duly armed with firearms.
Admittedly, complainant/PW-6 is the sole eye-
witness of the occurrence and there is no denial that
conviction can be based on the testimony of a
solitary eye-witness, as a rule of prudence, Court do
not base a conviction on the evidence of a solitary
eye-witness, unless that eye-witness is absolutely
reliable or his evidence is corroborated by reliable .
evidence. If we look at the medical evidence i.e. the
statement of the doctor and post mortem report
Ex.PM the deceased has sustained 07 group entry
wounds are on left back and right back of chest of the
deceased while their corresponding exit wounds on
the left front and right front of the chest. It is in the
evidence of complainant/PW-6 that he spotted the
accused while proceeding to Passani Bazar and the
accused started firing at them. In the site plan

prepared at the instance of the complainant, acquitted
&

co-accused Jehangir and appellant Shah Hussain has
been shown at point No.3 and 5 and i.e. in the front
of the deceased and the complainant. If it is
interpreted other way around and for the time being it
is assumed that the firing was made from the back
even in that situation the survival of the complainant
was also impossible. In other words whether firing is
made from the front or back at the deceased, survival
of the complainant with the deceased on the
motorbike is beyond our comprehension and his
presence cannot be believed in either situation.
Though, in his cross examination complainant/PW-6
has stated that when the accused started firing he
rushed to take refuge and remained at the place of
occurrence. In our view this is an attempt on the part
of the complainant/PW-6 at such belated stage to
justify his presence which is not supported by the
record of the case i.e. the murasila, site plan and
even the statement of Investigation Officer (PW-7).
The prosecution failed to prove the presence of the
complainant/PW-6 on the spot at the relevant time
beyond shadow of doubt, therefore, his statement is

not worth consideration for basing the conviction of
the appellant-convict Shah Hussain and the
accused/respondent Jehangir notwithstanding their
respective roles. Therefore, we hold no hesitation in
holding that the prosecution has miserably failed to
prove the presence of the PWs. Reliance is also
placed on “MUHAMMAD _IRSHAD and

another..Vs..THE STATE” (1999 SCMR 1030),

wherein it is held that;

“It is evident from these circumstances that
the complainant party was inimically disposed
towards the appellant. The eye-witness
examined by the prosecution are closely
related to one and other and rule of prudence
required that there should have been some
independent corroboration available for
placing implicit reliance on their testimony
but the same is lacking and it would be highly
unsafe to act upon the uncorroborated
testimony of eye-witness examined by the
prosecution, particularly when it is full of
material contradictions”

7. The above statement shows that the occurrence
had not taken place in the mode and manner as put
forth by the prosecution. The statement of the
complainant is not confidence inspiring and trust
worthy. The prosecution has been miserably failed to
establish the presence of complainant (PW-6) with
the deceased at the place of occurrence. It seems that

the occurrence is un-witness one. Reliance is placed
on 1999 SCMR 1220, titled “Muhammad Khan &

other..vs.. The State”, wherein it is held that;

“It is axiomatic and universally recognized
principle of law that conviction must be founded
on unimpeachable evidence and certainty of guilt
and hence any doubt that arises in the
prosecution case must be resolved in favour of the
accused. It is, therefore, imperative for the Court
to examine and consider all the relevant events
preceding and leading to the occurrence so as to
arrive at a correct conclusion. Where the
evidence examined by the prosecution is found
inherently unreliable, improbable and against
natural course of human conduct, then the
conclusion must be that the prosecution failed to
prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It would be
unsafe to rely on the ocular evidence which has
been moulded, changed and improved step by step
so as to fit in with the other evidence on record. It
is obvious that truth and falsity of the prosecution
case can only be judged when the entire evidence
and circumstances are scrutinized and examined
in its correct perspective. It is unfortunate that
neither the trial Court nor the High Court
thoroughly studied the record so as to reach
correct conclusion, rather they dealt with the
matter in a very cursory manner which naturally
resulted in miscarriage of justice. As noted above,
the eye-witness account in this case is so
unreasonable and inherently improbable that no

amount of corroboration can rehabilitate it”
10

Further reliance is placed on “Mst. SUGHRA

BEGUM and _another..Vs..QAISER PERVEZ and
others” (2015 SCMR 1142).

8. The learned AAG and learned counsel for the
complainant referred to certain portion of the cross
examination and contended that same are admissions.
We will not subscribe to this contention of the
learned AAG and learned counsel for the
complainant for the reason that the prosecution has to
stand on his own legs and charge is to be brought
home from the evidence led by them during the
course of trial. Any short coming, laxity or at times
carelessness of the defence would not mean that the
burden has been switched to the defence. The so-
called admissions by the defence counsel during trial
cannot be looked into and the same cannot be
considered to be detriment of the accused as held by
the Apex Court in the case of “ABDUL KHALIO V.
THE STATE” (1996 SCMR 1553), wherein it is

held that;

“In his cross-examination P.W. Abdul Jabbar
said that he saw from distance of 10/15 paces
deceased Abdul Wahab being chased by Abdul
Khaliq. That Khudaidad (acquitted accused)

was simply standing there, armed with a pistol.
11

Abdul Jabbar admitted to the defence
suggestion that he was informed by deceased
Abdul Wahab that he was fired at by Abdul
Khaliq and Khudaidad. This statement was
sought to be used by learned Additional
Advocate-General against the appellant, as his
admission to the effect that he had fired at the
deceased. Even if putting of such question in
cross-examination by the defence counsel,
amounts to an admission, the same cannot
bind the appellant. In a criminal case an
accused is not bound by the admissions made
by his counsel. Reference can be made to the
case of Sh. Abdul Hamid and another y. The
State (1973 PCr.LJ 858)”

9. The Investigation Officer (PW-7), during
spot inspection recovered and took into possession
06 empties of 7.62 bore from near the place of
accused which were sent to the Forensic Science
Laboratory (FSL) and the report whereof Ex.PA/1
is that the same were fired from one and the same
7.62 MM bore. The occurrence had taken place on
16.11.2017 and the Investigation Officer (PW-7)
recovered 06 empties from the spot on the same
day and the same were again sent to FSL on
02.07.2019 alongwith the Kalashnikovs recovered
from accused Shah Hussain and Jehangir with a

delay of about one year and eight months and
12

report whereof Ex.PZ/2 is that the same were fired
from 7.62 bore SMG rifle No.1975 UN 7504 which
was recovered from accused/appellant Shah
Hussain. We find no difficulty to hold that the FSL
report of the Forensic Science Laboratory, marked
as Ex.PZ/2 cannot be given any weight for the
reason that the empties were sent to the FSL and
then again were sent to the Forensic Science
Laboratory till the crime weapon were recovered
and then Kalashnikovs and empties both were lying
in the police station and, later on, were sent
together and that too, after the delay of about one
year and eight months of the occurrence. No
explanation was offered as to where the same were
lying during this period; therefore, no reliance can
be placed on the FSL report as the possibility of
substitution of the empties cannot be ruled out.
Delay of one year and eight months in sending the
empties and weapon of offence to FSL definitely
destroyed the evidentiary value of the recoveries.

In case of “Ali Sher and others y. State”, reported

in (2008 SCMR 707), it was held by the apex court

that:-
qT

13

“Crime empties allegedly found at the place of

occurrence were sent to Forensic Science

Laboratory along with the crime weapon 12

days after the recovery of alleged weapons.

Delay had destroyed the evidential value of

such piece of evidence and the recoveries could

not be offering any corroboration to the ocular

testimony”
10. So far as the recovery of crime weapon i.e.
Kalashnikov from the possession of appellant Shah
Hussain is concerned, appellant-convict Shah
Hussain was charged for ineffective firing at the
deceased and complainant. Moreover, appellant-
convict Shah Hussain has allegedly pleaded his guilt
in case F.I.R No.973 dated 11.12.2018 under section
15-AA of Police Station Mathani but that
Order/judgment of the case u/s 15-AA wherein the
appellant had pleaded guilty was not brought on the
file of instant case through any prosecution witness.
It is a well settled principle of law that while
deciding criminal case evidence recorded in another
case cannot be taken into consideration and the case

should be decided on the evidence available on its

own record.
14

11. Coming to Criminal Appeal No.505-P/2021
filed by appellant/complainant Muhammad Farooq
against acquittal of co-accused Jehangir. The
accused/respondent Jehangir was acquitted by the
learned trial Court vide impugned judgment dated
24.05.2021. The prosecution has failed to prove the
presence of the complainant with the deceased at the
time of occurrence. We have disbelieved the presence
of the complainant on the spot at the relevant time and
the mode and manner of the occurrence, therefore,
respondent/accused Jehangir has rightly been

acquitted by the learned trial Court.

12. In views of above and considering overall
circumstances of the case, criminal appeal No.479-
P/2021 filed by appellant-convict, namely, Shah
Hussain is accepted; and the impugned judgment
dated 24.05.2021 of the learned trial Court, together
with conviction of the appellant-convict and sentence
awarded to him, is set aside; and appellant-convict
Shah Hussain is acquitted of the charges. He be set
free, forthwith, if not required in any other case.

13. Consequent upon acceptance of the criminal

appeal (Cr.A .No.479-P/2021) and acquittal of
appellant-convict, namely, Shah Hussain, Criminal
Revision No.86-P/2021 by petitioner/complainant for
enhancement of the sentence and Criminal Appeal
No.505-P/2021 filed by appellant/complainant
Muhammad Farooq against acquittal of
respondent/accused Jehangir are dismissed.
