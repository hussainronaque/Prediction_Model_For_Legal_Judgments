JUDGEMENT/ORDER.

Date of hearing 26.10.2023

Petitioner(s) by: | Mr. Qaid Ullah Khan Khattak,
Advocate.

For State: Mr. Habib Ullah Khan, AAG.

Respondent (s) by: Mr. Masood Iqbal Khattak,
Advocate.

FAZAL SUBHAN, J.--- The Instant revision petition under
section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Cod read with 561-A
Cr.P.C is filed by the petitioner against the order dated
19.9.2023, passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge,
Banda Daud Shah vide which application of the respondent was
allowed and PW Saad Ullah Khan was re-summoned under
section 540 Cr.P.C.

2. Relevant facts of the case are that case FIR No.114
dated 07.6.2022 under sections 302/324/449/34 PPC of police
station Teri District Karak was registered by the respondent
Zafar Ali Khan in respect of the murder of deceased Mst. Bibi
Sakina, wife and Mst. Sadaf, daughter of Muhammad Yousaf,

against Zeeshan and Farooq sons of Mumtaz Khan, residents of
Kot Banda. After necessary investigation in the case challan
was submitted and after observing legal formalities trial in the
case commenced. On 05.9.2023 statement of PW-11 Saad Ullah
was recorded, who was identifier of the dead bodies of the 2
deceased. After recording his statement in respect of the
identification of both the dead bodies before the police as well
as before the doctor at THQ Hospital Banda Daud Shah, his
cross-examination was conducted and the prosecution
abandoned the other witness Muhammad Naeem and closed its
evidence. On the same date the complainant filed an application
for declaring PW Saad Ullah as hostile witness on the ground
that he has deposed against the facts of the case during cross-
examination and has extended concession to the respondent
Umer Farooq, hence the said witness may be declared hostile
and complainant be allowed to cross-examine him. The learned
trial Court after hearing arguments through impugned order
dated 19.9.2023, declared PW Saad Ullah as hostile witness and
issued summon to him for cross-examination by the
prosecution. Aggrieved from the said order the petitioner has
challenged the same before this Court.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for petitioner and
that of learned counsel for respondent assisted by leaned AAG

for the State heard and record gone through.
4. From the record it is clear that PW Saad Ullah was
only identifier of the dead bodies of the 2 deceased named
above and his examination-in-chief reveals that he has
supported the prosecution case and deposed the same facts of
identification of the dead bodies in his examination-in-chief.
After completion of the examination-in-chief the defence had
all the rights to put any question to the witness and in that way
the witness is bound to answer the question put to him. Article
150 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (Order) relates to the
matter pertaining to the putting of question by a party to his
own witness but the right to cross-examine a witness by the
party who called the said witness for evidence would only
apply when the witness deposed inconsistently in his statement/
examination-in-chief, however, when the witness has not stated
against the prosecution version and his cross-examination is
completed then the only right available to the prosecution was
to re-examine the witness under Article 132(3) of the said
order, however, in the instant case the prosecution seems to be
satisfied with the statement as well as cross-examination and
has not availed the opportunity of re-examining the witness and
even closed its evidence by abandoning the last witness namely
Muhammad Naeem. Though under section 540 Cr.P.C the
Court has the ample powers to summon any person as a

witness, examine any person in attendance though not
summoned as a witness or recall and re-examine any person
already examined, if his evidence appears to be essential for
just decision of the case, however, in the instant case PW Saad
Ullah has not deposed against the interest of the prosecution in
his statement and after recording his cross-examination and
closing of evidence by the prosecution a valid and legal right
has accrued to the petitioner which cannot be taken. away on the
mere assertion that the witness has given certain answers during
cross-examination or extended concessions to the accused. PW-
11 Saad Ullah is not a material witness of the case and has only
identified the dead bodies of the deceased and, therefore, his
statement has no direct bearing on the final result of the case. In
fact the respondent has also not shown any cogent or
convincing reason for recalling the witness on the ground of
being hostile to his stance/version and hence in the absence of
any solid reason prosecution cannot be allowed to impeach his
credibility by declaring as hostile witness. In the case of
Chairman, NAB-Vs-Muhammad Usman and others reported
in PLD 2018 Supreme Court 28, the august Court has held
that:-

“The discretion so vested in the Trial Court

ordinarily cannot be questioned and that too in

extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction unless it

is shown and established that exercise of such

powers by the Trial Court or by not exercising

the same, has resulted into a grave miscarriage

of justice, therefore, calling the witness of the
other party as its own witness, even in criminal
trials, already examined, is not acknowledged by
the law on the subject, therefore, it is neither
desirable nor such a practice can be approved. In
exceptional cases, where material witness has
been dropped by the prosecution in the
circumstances discussed above, the Court may
exercise powers with due care and caution.
However, in that case too, the prosecution
witness/witnesses cannot be examined as
defence witnesses but court witness/witnesses
and for that, a written request is made to the
Court showing cogent and convincing reasons
for calling and examining any witness of the
prosecution, not examined or has already been
examined to be re-examined as court witness.”

Similarly, this Court in the case of Faisal Khan-Vs-the State,

reported in 2022 YLR 1341 [Peshawar] in para 9 held that:-

“Therefore, the law is very clear and
straightforward on the subject that a witness of
prosecution can be declared hostile only when
he in examination-in-chief does not support
the prosecution case and record a statement
contrary to his earlier statement recorded
before the police under section 161, Cr.P.C.
which is not a case in hand. In the present
case, the statement of Muhammad Shareef was
recorded on 02.10.2021 and the application to
the Court was filed on 27.11.2021 after 33
days when he has left the dock as well as the
Court. Thus, the request of the prosecution for
declaring him a hostile witness was contrary to
the established law on the subject which has
been referred above. Hence, the Trial Court
has erred by allowing the said request through
the impugned order.”

Reliance in this respect can also be placed on the case law

reported in 2021] P.Cr.LJ Lahroe 1026, 2022 P.Cr.LJ

Peshawar 1472 and PLD 2023 Peshawar 133.
5. Thus in the light of the facts and circumstances of
the present case and while relying on the aforesaid judgments, it
is held that once a witness has recorded his examination-in-
chief and no objection on the said statement is raised by the
prosecution nor any request for declaring the witness as hostile
to his interest was made and the defence thereafter completed
its cross-examination on the witness and has succeeded in
impeaching his credibility then the said witness cannot be
declared hostile. In this view of the matter it is held that the
impugned order is not legally correct, hence is not sustainable
in the eyes of law. Resultantly this criminal revision is accepted
and the impugned order dated 19.9.2023 is hereby set aside.

Announced.
