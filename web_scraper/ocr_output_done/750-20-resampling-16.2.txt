JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- Hamid Ullah, the

appellant, is accused in a case registered vide FIR No. 73, dated
06.05.2018, under section 9 (c) CNSA of Police Station, ANF,
Peshawar, on the charges that he along with co-accused on
06.05.2018 was smuggling twelve kilograms’ heroin in a
motorcar bearing registration No. UE-133/Islamabad, driven by
him. After completion of investigation, he was forwarded to the
Judge, Special Court (CNS) Peshawar for trial, where, during
pendency of the trial, the State through Special Public
Prosecutor submitted an application for resampling of the
narcotic lying in sealed condition in the ‘“Malkhana” of the
Police Station, which was allowed on_ 17.06.2020,
consequently, SI Shamim Raza with the assistance of Naib
Court, after de-sealing of the case property in the court, had

drawn fresh 12 samples on 30.06.2020. Feeling aggrieved from
the process of the resampling of the narcotics, the appellant has
filed the instant appeal on the ground that the trial court has not
only accepted the request of the prosecution without issuing
notice to him but such process, as held by the apex court,

amounts to grant a premium to the prosecution to fill the lacuna

in its case.
2. Arguments heard and record perused.
3. Perusal of the record reveals that during investigation

of the case samples were separated from the recovered illegal
stuff for chemical analysis on 06.05.2018, which were received
by the concerned Lab on 07.05.2018 and result thereof was also
submitted. The record further transpires that after
commencement of the trial, four prosecution witnesses,
including statement of Inspector Jawad Altaf Raja, the
complainant, were recorded wherein the report of FSL was
exhibited as Exh.PW 4/17 and, thereafter, the subject
application for resampling of the narcotics was submitted by
the State as, according to the prosecution, the report of FSL
already received and exhibited sans the requisite protocols,
therefore, does not meet the requirements as directed by the
august Supreme court.

4. No doubt, Hon’ble the apex Court in the case titled
“The State vs. Imam Bakhsh (2018 SCMR_ 2039) has
observed that the report of the Government Analyst, prepared
in consequence of Rule 6, must provide for (i) tests and

analysis of the alleged drug (ii) the results of test (s) carried out
and (iii) the test protocols applied to carry out these tests and
non-compliance of rule 6 and absence of any of these
mandatory elements frustrates the purpose and object of the Act
thereby diminishing the reliability and evidentiary value of the
report but it does not mean that during trial, if any flaw arises in
the prosecution case, which gives benefit to the accused in
shape of deficient report, as in the instant case, the prosecution
should be given a chance to rectify the same. Relevant Para 6
of the judgment is reproduced herein below: -

6.  Re-testing of the drug, as argued by the DPG, in case
of a deficient report would amount to giving a premium to
the prosecution for its mistakes and lapses. In any case any
flaw in the case of the prosecution must only benefit the
accused. Sending the alleged drugs for re-testing would be
giving another chance to the prosecution to build its case,
which is not the role or business of the court. Besides there
is a likelihood that the chain of custody of the alleged drug
is compromised with the passage of time. Regarding the
objection that Imam Bakhsh may overturn hundreds of
convictions, it is pointed out that the sole purpose of this
Court is to dispense justice in accordance with law and it
matters less if one or many convictions are overturned
because of the correct interpretation and application of the
law. Imam Bakhsh purposively interprets the Act and finds
Rule 6 to be a mandatory provision regarding information
to be reflected in the Report of the Analysts. Hence, the
argument that Imam Bakhsh is per incuriam, is hopelessly
misconceived and rejected. For completion of record it is
pointed out that review filed in Imam Bakhsh was also
dismissed vide an earlier order dated 06.02.2019.

Similarly, in the case of Muhammad Naeem and

another vs. the State and others (PLD 2019 SC 669), the
august supreme court has observed that: -

5. An important dimension of this case is the role of a
criminal court, in an adversarial system of justice. "The
adversarial system is a two-sided structure under which
criminal trial courts operate that pits the prosecution
against the defence. Justice is done when the most
effective and rightful adversary is able to convince the
judge or jury that his or her perspective on the case is the
correct one." The fundamental construct of our criminal
courts is modeled on an adversarial system of justice
which decides on the strength of the evidence of the
parties. However, in exceptional cases our criminal courts
also. exercise inquisitorial powers under certain
provisions’? of Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 (Cr. P.C)
to secure the ends of justice, however, these provisions are
not attracted in the facts of the present case. The court
being a neutral arbiter has to dispassionately appreciate,
appraise, examine and weigh the evidence placed before:
it, rather than by ignoring the evidence and embarking on a
probing journey guided by emotions, sentiments arid sense
of self-styled justice pegged on the lofty notion of societal
reform. In an adversarial system the role of the judge is
that of a neutral umpire, unruffled by emotions, a judge is
to ensure fair trial between the prosecution and the defence
on the basis of the evidence before it. The judge should not
enter the arena so as to appear that he is taking sides. The
court cannot allow one of the parties to fill lacunas in their
evidence or extend a second chance to a party to improve
their case or the quality of the evidence tendered by them.
Any such step would tarnish the objectivity and
impartiality of the court which is its hallmark. Such
favoured intervention, no matter how well-meaning strikes
at the very foundations of fair trial, which is now
recognized as a fundamental right under Article 10-A of
our Constitution.

6. In the present case the direction of the High Court for
obtaining fresh samples of the alleged intoxicating
substance and preparing a fresh report of the Chemical
Examiner amounts to granting the prosecution a premium
on its failure to put up a proper case in the first instance.
Such judicial intervention is opposed to the adversary
principle and offensive to the fundamental right of fair
trial and due process guaranteed under the Constitution.
See Dildar v. State; Painda Gul v. State and State v. Amjad
Ali. The High Court has travelled beyond its lawful powers
under section 423(1)(a) Cr. P.C. and has in fact directed to
conduct re-investigation or further investigation of the
case, which is not permissible under the law. Even
otherwise, calling for fresh examination of the intoxicating
substance at the appellate stage after all these years may
frustrate the settled law as to safe custody and safe
transmission of the recovered substance making the report
of the chemical examiner suspect and unreliable.

5. Recently, in a case titled Qaiser Javed Khan vs. The
State through Prosecutor General Punjab, Lahore and

another (PLD 2020 SC 57), Hon’ble the Supreme Court of

Pakistan has settled and clear the uncertainty relating to the
issue of resampling and retesting by holding that the trial Court

while examining the Report has the power to summon the
Government Analyst in case there is any ambiguity in the
said Report and seek clarification thereof and _ this
clarification can only be based on the existing record of the
Government Analyst and does not mean to allow the
Government Analyst to conduct a fresh test or prepare
another Report, for that would amount to giving the
prosecution a chance of filling the gaps and lacunas in the
Report. Relevant Para 7 of the judgment, for convenience, is
reproduced below: -

“7. Once the above three requirements under Rule 6 are
contained in the Report of the Government Analyst, any
ambiguity therein may be resolved by the Trial Court by
exercising its power under Proviso to section 510, Cr. P.C.
The said provision states that the Court may, if it considers
necessary in the interest of justice, summon and examine
the person by whom such report has been made. Therefore,
the Trial Court while examining the said Report has the
power to summon the Government Analyst in case there is
any ambiguity in the said Report and seek clarification
thereof. This clarification can only be based on the existing
record of the Government Analyst and does not mean to
allow the Government Analyst to conduct a fresh test or
prepare another Report, for that would amount to giving
the prosecution a chance of filling the gaps and lacunas in
the Report. The Trial Court must also be mindful of the
legal position that the per se admissibility of the Report
i.e., without examining the Analyst (expert) does not
vouch for its evidentiary value, as observed in Khair-ul-
Bashar. The Courts are free to examine the contents of the
Report and to assess its evidentiary value (weight), a
matter distinct from its admissibility.”

6. Thus, in view of the above discussion, and while
driving guidance from the case law, supra, the order of learned
trial court for retesting of the narcotics is not in accordance
with law and, thus, liable to be set side. Hence, the appeal is

allowed, resultantly, the impugned order of learned trial court
for resampling and retesting of the narcotics is set aside with
the observation that the evidentiary value of the report of FSL
already received and exhibited is to be seen by the trial court in
view of the principle enunciated by the Hon’ble Supreme Court
in Shazia Bibi’s case (2020 SCMR 460) & Asmat Ali’s case
(2020 SCMR 1000) and Para 7 of the judgment of the Hon’ble

Supreme Court in the case of Qaiser Javed Khan, supra.
