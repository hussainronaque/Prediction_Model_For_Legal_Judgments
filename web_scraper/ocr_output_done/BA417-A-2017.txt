SYED MUHAMMAD ATTIQUE SHAH, J.- Mst.

Robina Bibi, accused-petitioner, seeks post arrest
bail on statutory grounds in case FIR No.237
dated 15.03.2016, under sections 337A(v)/337-
L()/34 PPC, registered at Police Station City,
Haripur.

2. The allegation against the accused-
petitioner, as reveals from F.I.R, is that she
alongwith her husband, Ijaz has assaulted and

caused injuries to Mst. Sameena Kosar.
3. Valuable arguments of the learned
counsel for the parties heard and the record
perused with their able assistance.

4. Learned counsel for the
accused/petitioner stressed that despite lapse of
more than a year, the trial has not yet been
concluded without any fault on the part of the
accused/petitioner, thus, he prayed for release of
the accused/petitioner on statutory delay.

5. On the other hand, learned AAG
assisted by learned counsel for the complainant
controverted the plea of the accused/petitioner by
contending that trial is almost complete in the
present case, as material evidence of the
prosecution has already been recorded. He
submitted that delay, if any, is occurred due to
fault of the defence. They submitted that the
prosecution will conclude the trial within a period
of four months.

6. Perusal of record reveals that charge
against the accused/petitioner was framed on
03.02.2017. Thereafter, the case was adjourned

due to absence of defence counsel on 09.03.2017,
22.03.2017, 05.04.2017, 10.05.2017 = and
17.05.2017. In other words, defence counsel
remained absent therefore evidence of the
prosecution could not be recorded. In similar
situation and circumstances, the Hon’ble Supreme
Court of Pakistan in case titled ‘Babar Hussain
Vs. the State and others’ (2016 SCMR 1538),

has observed that:

“We are of the considered view that
even after lapse of two years, the
conduct of an accused seeking
adjournments can be taken note of
and bail can be denied by a Court
even on statutory ground. We have
noticed that adjournments were
sought and even’ the _ cross-
examination of the eye-witnesses was
not conducted by the petitioner’s
counsel, for which no plausible
explanation has been offered. In
these specific circumstances, we do
not find the petitioner to be entitled to
the concession of bail on statutory
ground as a matter of right.

This petition being
misconceived is dismissed
accordingly. Leave refused.”

This Court considers that in such like cases, where
bail is sought on statutory ground of delay in
conclusion of trial, mere mathematical calculation
alone is not sufficient for grant of bail rather the
Court has to look into the overall conduct of the

accused during the course of trial and to take into
consideration the factors which caused delay in
the trial on the part of the defence. In case titled
‘Khalid Vs. The State’ (2014 P,Cr.L.J 437), it

has been held by Hon’ble High Court that:

“The honourable Supreme Court in
the case of Abdul Rasheed v. The
State, report in 1998 SCMR 897 has
already observed that where for any
reason accused or his authorized
agent which necessarily includes the
Advocate engaged for defence causes
delay, protection contained in third
proviso to section 497(1) Cr.P.C.
cannot be invoked. As I have
observed that at some occasions the
Presiding Officer or the prosecution
witnesses remained absent, however,
while ascertaining cumulative effect
of the delay in disposal of the case it
would not be merely a mathematical
calculation of excluding — the
adjournments obtained by the
accused or his counsel. Mechanism
of delay in the trial do not work on
the basis of mathematical and
mechanical inclusion and exclusion
of days. This is so because one
adjournment by accused whether
necessary or unnecessary deliberate
or non-deliberate’ may frustrate
further dates of hearing as it take
hectic efforts to accumulate land
motivate all prosecution witnesses,
complainant etc for trial/evidence and
one such desire of adjournment on
the part of the accused may unsettle
mind of prosecution witnesses for the
next few dates at least if not more. ”

7. While considering the present case
with the above mentioned yardstick, one can
easily determine that the delay, if any, caused in

conclusion of trial cannot be necessarily
attributable to the prosecution. The adjournments
were being sought due to absence of defence
counsel, therefore, while taking into consideration
this conduct on the part of the defence, this Court
hold that accused/petitioner is not entitled to be
released on bail on statutory ground. Accordingly,
this bail petition is dismissed.

8. Before parting with this judgment, this
Court considers that material evidence of the
prosecution has already been recorded and few
witnesses formal in nature are yet to be examined.
Therefore, while disposing of instant application, in
view of the request made by the learned AAG, the
prosecution is directed to produce the remaining
witnesses on next date of hearing and the learned trial
Court is directed to conclude the trial expeditiously,
but not beyond a period of two months. Office is
directed to send the record of the case immediately to

the trial Court.
