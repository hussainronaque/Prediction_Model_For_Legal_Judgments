MUHAMMAD AMJAD RAFIQ, J. Two brothers Ihsan Ullah

alias Munshi and Saleem alias Seemu/appellants were finally before the
Court after 13/14 years of the occurrence to face the charge of murder of
Arshad deceased and injuries to Zaheer in case FIR bearing No.352
dated 29.11.2000 registered under sections 302/324/148/149 PPC at
Police Station Satrah, District Sialkot. On conclusion of trial, co-accused
Muhammad Saleem son of Ahmad Din stood acquitted while appellants
were convicted vide judgment dated 29.06.2019 passed by learned

Additional Sessions Judge, Daska as follows;
“Under section 302(b)/34 PPC and sentenced to imprisonment for life each
and to pay Rs.5,00,000/- each as compensation u/s 544-A Cr.P.C., to legal
heirs of deceased Muhammad Arshad.”
02. November 29, 2000 early in the morning complainant Zulfiqar Ali
along with his brother Shaukat Ali and Cousin Sikandar Hayat was
going to Court in order to attend the murder Case of his brother Tariq
Mahmood; he stopped the car at Adda Kassowala at 7:40 a.m. where his
nephew Zaheer Abass son of Shaukat Ali and cousin (Phophizad)

namely Arshad (brother of Sikandar Hayat) were standing in wait for a
Crl.A.No.53656/2019 “Ihsan Ullah alias Munshi, etc. v. The State. 2
Cr. Revision No.58451/2019 “Sikandar Hayat v. Saleem alias Seemu. etc.

Public Bus in order to proceed Daska; in the meantime Azeem alias
Jimmy (dead), Ihsan Ullah alias Munshi, Muhammad Saleem
(appellants) sons of Rehmat Ali, Muhammad Saleem and Muhammad
Nawaz sons of Ahmad Din armed with Kalashnikovs alighted from a car
and Rehmat Ali already present there raised lalkara to teach a lesson to
Arshad and others for pursuing the above murder case and refusing to
honour the compromise. Azeem, Ihsan Ullah, Saleem sons of Rehmat
Ali and Muhammad Saleem son of Ahmad Din targeted Arshad (since
deceased) and Muhammad Nawaz to injured Zaheer. Fire made by
Azeem hit Arshad on right side of his neck, cheek and right thigh; Ihsan
Ullah’s fire hit on the left side of neck, arm and leg; fire of Saleem son
of Rehmat Ali landed on right thigh and on the back. Fire of Muhammad
Saleem son of Ahmad Din positioned at the mouth, and Muhammad
Nawaz targeted Zaheer Abass with a fire on his left shin. On
intervention by witnesses, accused went away while firing at the site.
Seeing the Arshad dead at the spot and Zaheer as injured, complainant
went to report the crime when police met him at Adda Mand where
Muhammad Amjad ASI PW-15 recorded his statement Ex.PN and

reached at the place of occurrence.

03. Deceased and injured were attended by the police when arrived at
the place of occurrence, and completed all formalities like preparation of
injury statement of injured, inquest report, application for postmortem of
deceased, collection of 40 bullet casings, blood-stained earth, dispatch of
dead body and injured to mortuary and hospital respectively, recording
of statements under section 161 Cr. P.C. and all other allied functions
due in investigation, later issuance of warrants and proclamations, arrest
and recovery of weapons from the accused persons as detailed in
judgment of trial Court. Muhammad Amjad ASI (PW-15), Razzaq
Ahmad SI (PW-16) Akram Shahbaz SI (PW-08), Amanat Ali ASI (PW-
09), Muhammad Afzal SI (PW-07) time to time had conducted
investigation of this case and ultimately report under section 173 of
Cr.P.C. was submitted before the Court. When charge sheeted the
accused pleaded innocence and claimed trial, whereupon, apart from

above Investigating Officers, the prosecution produced, Zaheer Abbas
Crl.A.No.53656/2019 “Ihsan Ullah alias Munshi, etc. v. The State. 3
Cr. Revision No.58451/2019 “Sikandar Hayat v. Saleem alias Seemu. etc.

PW-01, Muhammad Iqbal PW-02 and Sikandar Hayat PW-03 who
furnished the ocular account of the occurrence. Dr. Mukhtar Ahmad
PW-10 conducted postmortem examination on the dead body of Arshad
deceased whereas Dr. Muhammad Munim Javed PW-17 had medically
examined Zaheer Abbas injured while rest of the witnesses are all formal
in nature and they made statements in respect to their functions
performed during the course of investigation. The prosecution tendered
some relevant reports and closed its case; where-after, the accused
persons when examined under section 342 Cr.P.C. refuted the
prosecution evidence, however, the present appellants produced certain
documents in defence but not opted to appear in the witness box as
required under section 340(2) Cr.P.C and ultimately the trial ended in

result as detailed above.

04. Through Criminal Appeal No.53656/2019 Ihsan Ullah alias
Munshi and Saleem alias Seemu accused/appellants have challenged
their above conviction, whereas, through Criminal Revision
No.5845 1/2019 Sikandar Hayat witness/brother of deceased has sought
enhancement of sentence against the appellants. Both these matters are

being decided through this single judgment.

05. Learned Counsel for the appellants submits that prosecution has
set up an exaggerated false case involving two set of accused; one
consists of three brothers and a father Rehmat Ali and other set with two
brothers, sons of Ahmad Din; he had an argument that both sets have no
relation inter se for communion of minds for one objective, therefore,
it’s a wider net scheme by the complainant party to book all their
enemies in one case. While commenting on the deficiency of evidence
he has pointed out that record of Court was not produced to show
fixation of murder case of Tariq. Arrangement of witnesses was also
under fire that three witnesses Zaheer (PW-1), Muhammad Iqbal (PW-2)
and Jamal Din (not produced) were present at Adda Kassowala whereas
Zulfiqar complainant (since dead), Shaukat Ali and Sikandar Hayat
(PW-3) were sitting in the car at a distance of 50 feet from the place
where Arshad and Zaheer received fires. He submitted that Sikandar

Hayat (PW-3) was brother of Arshad deceased, neither he volunteered to
Crl.A.No.53656/2019 “Ihsan Ullah alias Munshi, etc. v. The State. 4
Cr. Revision No.58451/2019 “Sikandar Hayat v. Saleem alias Seemu. etc.

become the complainant of case nor did appear as a witness in earlier
trial of Muhammad Nawaz (acquitted accused). It was also an argument
that Arshad deceased was neither complainant nor witness or in any
capacity was part of investigation of murder case of Tariq, therefore,
targeting him by the appellant did not provide any justification. Further
stated that witnesses were not present at the spot and in an earlier trial
statement of Zaheer injured was disbelieved and he had improved his
statement in the present trial; weapon recovered from the appellants did
not match the crime empties. In an earlier trial Muhammad Nawaz son
of Ahmad Din, and in the present trial Muhammad Saleem son of
Ahmad Din stood acquitted on the same set of evidence. Lastly prayed
for acquittal of appellants while justifying their abscondence that

warrants and proclamation were not served upon them as per law.

06. Learned Deputy Prosecutor General on the other hand stated that
it was a daylight occurrence, ocular account is supported by medical
evidence and abscondence of accused for 13/14 years is a corroborative
fact which verifies their criminal liability and non-matching of weapon
with crime empties cannot be considered a ground for acquittal. He
placed reliance on cases reported as “OASIM SHAHZAD and another
versus The STATE and_others” (2023 SCMR 117); “MUHAMMAD
BASHIR and another versus The STATE and others” (2023 SCMR 190);
“NASIR AHMED _ versus The STATE” (2023 SCMR _ 478);
“AMANULLAH versus The STATE and another” (2023 SCMR 527);
“ALI ASGHAR alias AKSAR versus The STATE” (2023 SCMR 596).

Learned Counsel for the complainant stated that in earlier trial Zulfigar
was produced from the set of witnesses who were sitting in the Car and
after his murder, Sikander Hayat was produced as PW-3 which makes
no difference or in any manner diminishes the value of prosecution
evidence. Further states that Muhammad Ashraf (father of deceased
Arshad and Sikandar PW-3) was the witness in murder case of Tariq,
and Zaheer injured was the nephew of said Tariq; therefore, they can be
the target by the appellants to force the complainant party for
compromise. He further submitted that injuries attributed to Muhammad

Nawaz (acquitted accused of earlier trial) and Muhammad Saleem
Crl.A.No.53656/2019 “Ihsan Ullah alias Munshi, etc. v. The State. 5
Cr. Revision No.58451/2019 “Sikandar Hayat v. Saleem alias Seemu. etc.

(acquitted accused of present trial) were observed by the doctor as exit
wounds and if in earlier trial evidence of Zaheer injured was not
properly appreciated by the trial court, it in no way affects the statement
made by him in the present trial because every criminal case is to be
decided independently on the basis of evidence recorded therein.
Continued on his submissions that fires attributed to the appellants were
found on the body of deceased by the doctor exactly at the same locale
as stated by the PWs which were also the cause of death; after the
present occurrence, appellants have repeated the crime and committed
murder of Zulfiqar, complainant of present case for which an FIR is
available in the evidence as Ex.DQ. Car used in the occurrence stood
recovered and due to long abscondence, weapon recovered on the lead
of the appellant could not be matched with crime empties which does

not affect the prosecution case.

07. Before the evidence of prosecution is discussed, it is essential to
know the inter se relation of witnesses and that of accused persons
present at crime scene. Zulfiqar, and Shaukat Ali are brothers, Sikandar
Hayat (PW-3) and his brother Arshad deceased are their Phophizad,
Zaheer injured is son of Shaukat Ali and nephew of Zulfiqar Ali. As per
prosecution case, Zulfiqar, Shaukat and Sikandar while in a car were
proceeding to Court for attending the murder case of Tariq (brother of
Zulfiqar & Shaukat and paternal uncle of Zaheer Injured and Phophizad
of Arshad deceased & Sikandar PW-3). They saw Zaheer Ahmad son of
Shaukat Ali, and Arshad brother of Sikandar were standing at Adda
Kassowala. Zaheer was going to school being student of Class-10 and
Arshad being milkman was present for the purpose of supply of milk to
Daska. Rehmat Ali and his three sons Azeem, Ihsan Ullah, Saleem,
while Muhammad Nawaz and Muhammad Saleem sons of Ahmad Din,
their cousins were also the accused party of murder of said Tariq, who
were pressing hard the complainant party to compromise the murder of
Tariq; therefore, targeted Arshad and Zaheer in this case. Important to
note Muhammad Ashraf father of Arshad deceased was also a witness of
murder case of said Tariq. With this information let’s see what the

witnesses deposed in this case.
Crl.A.No.53656/2019 “Ihsan Ullah alias Munshi, etc. v. The State. 6
Cr. Revision No.58451/2019 “Sikandar Hayat v. Saleem alias Seemu. etc.

08. Three witnesses were chosen to depose ocular account of
prosecution case; Zaheer Abass injured witness as PW-1, Muhammad
Iqbal PW-2 and Sikandar Hayat PW-3. First in the row was Zaheer who
took the driving seat of prosecution case because Zulfigar complainant
who appeared as witness in earlier trial now had been murdered.
Occurrence was of year 2000 when he was student of Class-10, after
about 17 years he appeared as witness in the present trial and deposed
that he was present at Adda Kassowala for going to school where
deceased Arshad, Phophizad of his father was also present when
occurrence took place at 7:45 AM. He stated perfectly the role of both
the appellants and other accused persons. He was confronted with his
statement under section 161 Cr.P.C. but nothing favourable to defence
could be elicited from his mouth. He responded correctly about passing
of information to police by his uncle Zulfigar, complainant while he
along with deadbody of Arshad remained at the place of occurrence till
the arrival of police in whose company he was shifted to the hospital in
an injured condition where he was examined just after half an hour. He
further deposed that his statement was recorded by the police not only at
the place of occurrence but also interrogated him in the hospital. He
denied the suggestion that it was a blind murder. He was suggested that
after acquittal of Muhammad Nawaz in earlier trial, he has dishonestly
improved his statement, he categorically denied and stated as under;

I do not remember that I got recorded in my statement
recorded in the court on 21.04.2004, that Saleem s/o
Ahmad Din is Phuphizad of co-accused Muhammad
Azeem, Ihsan Ullah and Muhammad Saleem sons of
Rehmat Ali. I can collect my memory after going through
the said earlier statement. It is correct that in my earlier
statement it is recorded that accused Saleem s/o Ahmad
Din is Phuphizad of Muhammad Azeem, Ihsan Ullah and
Muhammad Saleem. I had not recorded in my statement
recorded on 21.04.2004, that fire shot made by accused
Nawaz hit to the deceased, however, I recorded that burst
fired by accused Nawaz hit on left leg. Confronted with
Ex.DB, wherein it is written that accused Nawaz made a
burst landing on the deceased as well as on left leg and
backside of calf of Zaheer Abass PW.
Crl.A.No.53656/2019 “Ihsan Ullah alias Munshi, etc. v. The State. 7
Cr. Revision No.58451/2019 “Sikandar Hayat v. Saleem alias Seemu. etc.

This part of his statement in earlier trial that fire hit the deceased as well
as on his person was considered by the court in earlier trial as a major
contradiction to extend benefit of doubt to Muhammad Nawaz accused.
Was that statement an exaggeration or based on truth cannot be focused
in this trial because no such contradiction is found by the Court in his
present statement which rings true and every criminal case is to be
decided on the basis of evidence recorded in the trial of that case only.
Even subsequent hostility of a witness is no ground to reject his
testimony in the present trial. Case reported as “NOORULLAH versus
THE STATE” (2012 YLR 168) is referred. However, it is trite that its

intrinsic value is diminished if it is not corroborated with any other
evidence, whereas in the present case it is very much available in the
form of statement of two more witnesses of ocular account. As a legal
question whether a witness once disbelieved in a trial can be relied upon

in subsequent trial has also been dealt in para-16 of this judgment.

09. An independent witness PW-2 Muhammad Iqbal was also present
at the place where Arshad and Zaheer sustained injuries. He deposed
about presence of Rehmat Ali and his location in front of National Bank
when complainant’s car reached at the place of occurrence and
immediately thereafter accused persons arrived there. About the arrival
of Zulfiqar complainant and others on car, he deposed like as under;

“Sikandar, Zulfigar and Shaukat came together on a car
at Adda Kassowala. They reached about 1/2 minutes
prior to happening of occurrence and they were still in
the car when the occurrence took place. I had no
knowledge that where they were proceeding. Car of said
PWs was at a distance of 35/40 feet from the place of
occurrence”.
He deposed correctly the role of accused persons including the
appellants. Though most of the question asked from this witness was
responded by him as ‘I do not remember” yet defence put into his mouth
a conceding fact which he responded that “it is correct that as the
Zaheer PW stated to be present at the Adda to go to school, likewise
other students were also present at the Adda to go to school”. It

supports the version of Zaheer PW-1 that he was present at the place of

occurrence for going to school. This witness was Chairman of Union
Crl.A.No.53656/2019 “Ihsan Ullah alias Munshi, etc. v. The State. 8
Cr. Revision No.58451/2019 “Sikandar Hayat v. Saleem alias Seemu. etc.

Council and was not the relative of any party; therefore, did not
exaggerate the occurrence, rather responded only those questions which
were in his knowledge and did not try to improve his statement in any
manner nor shown desperation to fix the offenders at every cost which
shows his impartiality and is expected from man of such status. While
denying the fact of his support to complainant party he deposed as
under;

“Tt is incorrect that I was supporting the complainant
party; volunteered that I was not in a position to support
the complainant party”.

He also deposed that he shifted the Injured to the hospital; what he
actually deposed is as under;
“T and father of Injured PW Zaheer brought Zaheer to
Civil Hospital, Daska, on car.”

And

“We shifted the injured PW to Civil Hospital, Daska,
after arrival of police. Zulfiqar complainant had
informed the local police about the occurrence”.

He deposed about his presence at the place of occurrence that he was
going to purchase the diesel and was on motorcycle of his friend Mohsin
Iqbal who was also present at the place of occurrence. Thus, being
independent witness his presence at the spot cannot be doubted in any

manner.

10. Third in the row was Sikandar Hayat PW-3 being brother of
deceased claimed his presence in a car with complainant Zulfiqar (now
dead) and Shaukat Ali, (brother of complainant and father of Zaheer
Injured). He was got confronted with his previous statement recorded
under section 161 Cr.P.C. with respect to presence of witnesses, nearby
surroundings, role of accused persons and injuries sustained by the
deceased and injured. This witness has deposed his family profession as
milk man which was being run by four brothers including deceased
Arshad. Duty of Arshad deceased was to supply milk early in the
morning. When asked about means of bringing milk at Adda Kassowala,

he responded in following words;
Crl.A.No.53656/2019 “Ihsan Ullah alias Munshi, etc. v. The State. 9
Cr. Revision No.58451/2019 “Sikandar Hayat v. Saleem alias Seemu. etc.

On the day of occurrence, Arshad deceased brought 2 or 2-'4
mands of milk for suppling to shopkeepers due to month of
Ramazan, however, in other months, he used to supply 5/6
mands of milk to shopkeeper at Daska. we used to bring milk
to Adda Kassowala on horse cart and there from on bus to
Daska. On the day of occurrence, deceased Arshad brought
the milk on cycle from village to Adda Kassowala. No
specific bus was used to bring milk from Kassowala to Daska.
whichever bus was available, the milk was brought thereon
from Kassowala to Daska.

He further deposed that his village is at a distance of one kilometer from
Adda Kassowala. It took %4 minutes on motorcycle, 6/7 minutes on
bicycle and 12/14 minutes by foot for reaching Adda Kassowala. He
further deposed that they proceeded to Daska, perhaps to attend court
proceedings or some other work at Katcharay from village on the day of
occurrence. This natural narration clearly reflects his presence at the spot
and reason for availability of deceased at Adda kassowala. He denied the
suggestion that accused/appellants had no enmity with them rather
volunteered that his father was witness in case FIR No. 78/2000 (Murder
case of Tariq). Deposition of all three witnesses of ocular account
despite being recorded after 17 years of the occurrence had a touch of
truth and minor contradiction due to efflux of time are natural; therefore,
have not affected the prosecution case in any manner. Reliance is on
cases reported as “MUHAMMAD BASHIR and another versus The
STATE and others” (2023 SCMR 190); “NASIR AHMED versus The
STATE” (2023 SCMR 478); “ALI ASGHAR alias AKSAR versus The
STATE” (2023 SCMR 596).

11. Corresponding to role of firing by the appellants, Dr. Mukhtar
Ahmad PW-10 observed as many as 20 firearm injuries including entry
and exit wounds on the person of Arshad deceased. Though a
photographic narration of injuries by the witnesses in such a situation of
indiscriminate firing by five accused at the site is not expected yet being
daylight occurrence fact of firing by the appellants cannot be
oversighted. Reading it by narration of witnesses, the role assigned to
Thsan Ullah appellant for hitting of his fires on the left side of neck, arm
and leg were counted by the doctor as injuries No. 5, 11, 12 & 19 and of

Saleem appellant on right thigh and on the back of deceased as injuries
Crl.A.No.53656/2019 “Ihsan Ullah alias Munshi, etc. v. The State. 10
Cr. Revision No.58451/2019 “Sikandar Hayat v. Saleem alias Seemu. etc.

No. 16 & 17. Learned counsel for the appellants stated that injury was
also attributed to Saleem son of Ahmad Din accused but he stood
acquitted from the charge. It has been observed that injury attributed to
said Saleem was on the mouth of deceased which was observed by the
doctor as exit wound reflected as injury No. 4 and no recovery of
weapon was effected from him, therefore, his case was distinguished
from the present appellants. Thus, medical evidence stands in
conformity to ocular account providing a support to the prosecution

case.

12. Abscondence of accused/appellants for about 13/14 years is
another factor which runs against the appellants. Abscondence of
accused after the occurrence is a relevant fact as per Article 21 of the

Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984; relevant illustration is as under;

(i) A is accused of a crime.

The fact that, after the commission of the alleged crime he
absconded, or was in possession of property or the proceeds of
property acquired by the crime, or attempted to conceal things
which were or might have been used in committing it, are
relevant.

The above illustration not only makes his abscondence as relevant fact
but also fact of concealing things with which offence was committed as
relevant and, in this case, concealing the weapons of offence is also a
relevant fact. It is trite that abscondence is always considered as
corroborative evidence, though not a sole reason to convict the accused.
Reliance is on cases reported as “ROHTAS KHAN Versus THE STATE”
(2010 SCMR 566); “ABDUL KHALIO Versus THE STATE” (2006 SCMR
1886); “HAROON RASHEED and 6 others Versus THE STATE” (2005
SCMR 1568).

13. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that though warrants
of arrest and proclamations were tendered in the evidence and also put to
the appellants for their response in statement under section 342 Cr.P.C.
yet process server/PW did not appear in the dock in support of such
evidence, therefore, abscondence of the appellants could not be proved

as per law, benefit of which must be given to the appellants that they
Crl.A.No.53656/2019 “Thsan Ullah alias Munshi, etc. v. The State. 11
Cr. Revision No.58451/2019 “Sikandar Hayat v. Saleem alias Seemu. etc.

were not aware of such occurrence nor they had any hand in it. Contrary
to above fact, Zahid Hussain 234/C appeared as PW-19 and deposed that
on 06.02.2001, warrants of arrest against Azeem, Ihsan Ullah and
Saleem accused were handed over to him for execution and similarly the
proclamations on 27.02.2001; he submitted his reports in this respect as
Ex.PW/1-5/A & Ex.PX/1-5/A. Thus, prosecution has succeeded to prove
the observance of legal process and resultantly the willful abscondence

of the appellants.

14. Recovery of weapons of offence Kalashnikovs from Ihsan Ullah
and Saleem appellants is another factor which lends support to
prosecution case. Though no report of matching of such weapons with
24 bullet casings of Kalashnikov collected from the spot is available, yet
by recovery of weapon after such a long period, availability of matching
report is hardly expected. This inconsequential effect of recovery in no
case affects the prosecution case. Reliance is on “QASIM SHAHZAD
and_another_versus The STATE and_others” (2023 SCMR 117);
“AMANULLAH versus The STATE and another” (2023 SCMR 527).

15. Both the appellants were also found involved in commission of
alleged offence as per investigation which has not been challenged
anywhere throughout; even after committing this occurrence said
appellants were also nominated in another FIR bearing No. 35/2003 P/S
Civil Line Gujranwala Ex. DQ, relating to murder of Zulfigar,
complainant of present case and one Sajid accused was executed,
because present appellant were also absconders in that case. Even before
this occurrence present appellants were also accused of murder of Tariq
brother of complainant of present case. Therefore, enmity between the

parties as a motive of present case is also proved.

16. Coming to the hunch of learned counsel for the appellants that in an
earlier trial against Muhammad Nawaz accused, the statement of injured
Zaheer was disbelieved whom said accused caused a firearm injury;
therefore, his statement being confronted in present trial cannot be
believed in any manner. Record of earlier trial was perused, said Zaheer

has exaggerated the prosecution version with the touch that fire of
Crl.A.No.53656/2019 “Thsan Ullah alias Munshi, etc. v. The State. 12
Cr. Revision No.58451/2019 “Sikandar Hayat v. Saleem alias Seemu. etc.

Muhammad Nawaz hit Arshad deceased and then to him as well. This
exaggeration was resulted in disbelieving him in that trial, but in this
trial, he has not stated any like in an earlier trial. A witness if missed or
exaggerated a fact in an earlier trial cannot be termed as untruthful in
subsequent trial if his testimony is straight forward and natural. If this be
permitted then once some witnesses are disbelieved in an earlier trial
their testimony cannot be relied upon in subsequent trial, then the
accused later tried would receive a clean chit on the basis of statement
earlier made by the said witnesses. Competency of a witness is regulated
under Article 3 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 which runs as under;

3. Who may testify: All persons shall be competent to
testify unless the Court considers that they are prevented
from understanding the questions put to them, or from
giving rational answers to those questions, by tender
years, extreme old age, disease, whether of body or mind
or any other cause of the same kind:

Provided that a person shall not be competent to testify if
he has been convicted by a Court for perjury or giving
false evidence:

Provided further that the provisions of the first proviso
shall not apply to a person about whom the Court is
satisfied that he has repented thereafter and mended his
ways:

Provided further that the Court shall determine the
competence of a witness in accordance with the
qualifications prescribed by the injunctions of Islam as
laid down in the Holy Qur'an and Sunnah for a witness,
and. where such witness is not forthcoming the Court may
take the evidence of a witness who may be available.

Explanation: A lunatic is not incompetent to testify unless

he is prevented by his lunacy from understanding the

questions put to him and giving rational answers to them.
The first proviso to above Article clearly speaks that only that person
shall be prevented to be testified if he is convicted of perjury or giving
false evidence. As per 2™ proviso to above Article, even such witness
can also be permitted if court is satisfied on his repentance. It has been
held in case reported as “Syed ALI NAWAZ SHAH GARDEZI versus Lt. Col.
MUHAMMAD YOUSAF KHAN, COMMISSIONER, QUETTA DIVISION”
(PLD 1962 (W. P.) Lahore 558) as under;

Crl.A.No.53656/2019 “Ihsan Ullah alias Munshi, etc. v. The State. 13
Cr. Revision No.58451/2019 “Sikandar Hayat v. Saleem alias Seemu. etc.

“The fact that a person has been disbelieved in another case
cannot in law be conclusive of saying that he is
untrustworthy witness, but it can hardly be denied that a
finding of a Court of competent jurisdiction that a person had
perjured himself cannot but have some effect on the Court
which has to deal with his evidence.”

It has also been held in a Case reported from Indian Jurisdiction as
“Bolisetti__ Venkatarathanamma___(Died) __By......vs_ __ Nadakuduti
Vekateswara Rao And Ors.” (1999 (1) ALD 422) (1999 ATHC 1912) as

under;

“Tt should be noticed that a witness should be believed or
disbelieved with reference to the evidence that was brought on
record and not with reference to the evidence in another case.
It is held in Chandreshwar Prasad Narain Sutgh v.
Bishweslnvar Pratap Narain Singli, AIR 1927 Patna 61, that
the opinion of the Court upon the character of a person is not
admissible in evidence for the reason that there is no material
for judging whether he was rightly disbelieved or wrongly
disbelieved. The question whether a witness is entitled to credit
or not, must be decided by the Court thought of the witness in
another case.”

In cases reported as “MUHAMMAD ILYAS versus THE STATE” (1997
SCMR 25) and “DEEDAR ALI versus THE STATE” (PLD 1994 Karachi

309), evidence of witnesses was rejected only because they were

convicted of perjury. As referred above “NOORULLAH versus THE

STATE” (2012 YLR 168), even subsequent hostility of a witness cannot

be considered as ground to acquit the accused of earlier trial.

17. Learned counsel for the appellants urged that on the same set of
evidence Muhammad Nawaz in an earlier trial and Muhammad Saleem
in present trial stood acquitted, therefore, under the principle of falsus in
uno falsus in omnibus, present appellants cannot the convicted. It has
been observed that injuries attributed to Muhammad Nawaz (acquitted
accused of earlier trial) and Muhammad Saleem (acquitted accused of
present trial) were observed by the doctor as exit wounds and no
recovery was effected from Muhammad Saleem; thus, their case is
distinguished and under the principle of abundant caution, present
accused/appellants can be singled out; reliance is on cases reported as
“MUHAMMAD SHARIF and others versus The STATE and others” (2019 SCMR

Crl.A.No.53656/2019 “Thsan Ullah alias Munshi, etc. v. The State. 14
Cr. Revision No.58451/2019 “Sikandar Hayat v. Saleem alias Seemu. etc.

1368), “SALEEM ZADA and others versus The STATE and others” (2019 SCMR
1309) and “MUHAMMAD BILAL versus The STATE and others” (2019 SCMR

1362).

18. Therefore, in the given circumstances, the learned trial court has
rightly convicted both the appellants and sentenced them to
imprisonment for life under section 302 (b) PPC because both have joint
role of firing which is always considered as mitigation; reliance is on
case reported as “MUHAMMAD YAQOOB versus THE STATE” (2009
SCMR 1273). In view of above, titled appeal is DISMISSED, the

conviction and sentence of the appellants is upheld. Benefit of section
382-B Cr.P.C. already extended by the trial Court shall hold the field.
The case property, if any, be disposed of in accordance with law and the

record of the learned trial court be sent back immediately.

19. For the reasons recorded above, the sentence imposed upon the
appellants fully commensurate with the charge and the evidence on
record, therefore, criminal revision seeking enhancement being without

any merit is also DISMISSED.
