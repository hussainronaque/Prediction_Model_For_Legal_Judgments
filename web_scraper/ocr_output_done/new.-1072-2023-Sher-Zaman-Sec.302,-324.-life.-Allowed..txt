SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J:- This criminal
appeal is directed against the judgment dated
14.06.2023 of the learned Additional Session
Judge-l, Peshawar delivered in case FIR No.101
dated 26.01.2021 under sections 302/324 PPC of
Police Station Chamkani, Peshawar, whereby the
appellant has been convicted under section 302
(b) PPC and sentenced to imprisonment for life
and to pay Rs.100,000/- as compensation to legal
heirs of the deceased within the meaning of
Section 544-A Cr.P.C recoverable as arrears of
land revenue or in default whereof to undergo
simple imprisonment for six months. He has also
been convicted under section 324 PPC and

sentenced to undergo seven years RI with fine of
Rs.10,000/- or in default whereof to suffer 01
month SI. Both the sentences were directed to
run concurrently, while benefit of section 382-B

Cr.P.C was extended to the convict.

2. Case of the prosecution, as per Murasila
(Ex.PW.4/1) followed by FIR, is that on
26.01.2021 Sajjad Khan, ASI (P.W.4) during
Gasht, after receiving information regarding the
occurrence, rushed to the’ spot, where
complainant (Noor Rehman) reported the matter
to him to the effect that on the eventful day, he
and his father Gul Rahman were going to their
fields; that when they reached to the place of
occurrence, Sher Zaman s/o Khan Rahman
(accused/appellant) came from opposite side,
took out the pistol from his trouser-fold (U/sLé ai )
and suddenly started firing at them with the
intention to kill, as a result of which his father got
hit and died on the spot, while the complainant
escaped unhurt. Motive for the occurrence was
stated to be an altercation between the deceased
and the accused/ appellant. Consequently, on the
report of complainant, a case vide FIR No.101

was registered against the appellant.
3. On arrest of the appellant and completion
of investigation, initially challan was submitted
before the court of competent jurisdiction, charge
was framed to which he did not plead guilty and
wished for trial. As such the learned trial court
was pleased to direct the prosecution to produce
its evidence. In order to prove its case,
prosecution produced and examined as many as
10 witnesses, whereafter statement of the
accused was recorded, where the accused
professed his innocence, but did not opt to record
his statement under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. After
conclusion of trial, the learned trial court found the
appellant guilty of the charge and whilst recording
his conviction, sentenced him as mentioned
above, whereagainst he has filed the instant
appeal.

4. The learned counsel for parties as well as
the worthy Additional Advocate General were
heard at length and with their valuable assistance
the record was scanned through.

5. The tragic incident claimed life of the
deceased and the matter was reported by the

complainant to the local police after their arrival to
the spot. The injury sheet and inquest report were
prepared and the dead body was shifted to the
hospital for post mortem examination. The
investigating officer visited the spot and on the
pointation of the complainant prepared the site
plan. During spot inspection, the investigating
officer collected blood-stained earth from the
place of the deceased and he also took into
possession an empty of .30 bore near from the
place given to the accused. The accused
volunteered his arrest on the day of incident and
as such he was arrested. The trial commenced
and on conclusion of the trial, the appellant was
convicted and sentenced vide the impugned
judgment.

6. The learned trial court appreciated the
evidence on file and it also took into consideration
the status of the accused, as_ the
accused/appellant was singularly charged. The
learned trial court applied its judicial mind to the
evidence on file and it was after appreciating the
evidence that the appellant was held responsible
for the murder of the deceased. True that in case

of single accused, substitution is a rare
phenomenon, but equally true that it by itself
should not be the determining factor, rather the
courts of law must take into consideration the
collected evidence and statements of the
witnesses, while determining the guilt or
innocence of the accused. Single accused by
itself would not guarantee that under all
circumstances the accused is to be held
responsible, rather in case of single accused
extra care is needed and the prosecution is under
the bounden duty to collect trustworthy
confidence inspiring evidence, so that miscarriage
of justice could be avoided.

7. The points for determination before this
court are, as to whether the incident occurred in
the mode, manner and at the stated time; as to
whether the complainant was present on the spot
at the time of report and in the hospital at the time
of post mortem examination; as to whether the
medical evidence supports the case of the
prosecution and as to whether the prosecution
succeeded in bringing home guilt against the

appellant.
8. There is no denial to this fact that the
unfortunate deceased lost his life and for the
same the appellant is singularly charged, but
there is no denial to this fact that the complainant
is under the obligation to establish his presence
on the spot, and that he must convince that the
incident occurred at the stated time and in the
stated manner. In order to ascertain the manner
in which the incident occurred and to assess the
presence of the complainant, we deem it
essential to go through the statements of the
witnesses. The complainant was examined as
P.W.06, who stated that on the day of incident he
along with the deceased was going towards their
fields; that it was at 04:00 PM that from the
opposite side the accused facing trial, Sher
Zaman, came and took out his pistol from “Badh
Shalwar’; that he started firing at them as a result
of firing his father i.e. the deceased got hit and he
escaped unhurt; that his father died on the spot;
the police attracted to the spot and he reported
the matter. As apart from the complainant there is
no eyewitness, so we deem it essential to go

through the statements of the one to whom the
report was made, the doctor who conducted the
post mortem examination and the investigating
officer who investigated the case, along with the
witness who escorted the dead body from spot to
Khyber Medical College. The complainant was
put to the test of searching cross-examination
with an attempt to extract something favourable to
the appellant, from his mouth. The complainant is
to tell that, when he and the deceased left their
house and that for what purpose. As the record is
silent regarding the availability of the fields of the
complainant at the place of incident and even the
investigating officer could not collect any
evidence in that respect, so we are to see that for
what purpose the complainant and the deceased
went to the spot. It is pertinent to mention that
while reporting the matter the complainant stated
that he and the deceased were on their way to
the fields that in the meanwhile the accused/
appellant appeared from the opposite side, pulled
out his pistol from the fold of his trouser and
started firing at them. When the statement of the
complainant is juxtaposed with the site plan,

prepared on his pointation, the two contradict
each other. If the statement of the complainant is
taken to be correct then the dead body should
have been recovered from the thoroughfare, but
interestingly, the dead body of the deceased was
found in the field having crop three feet in height.
Even the blood was recovered from inside the
field and so the empty. It is pertinent to mention
that the complainant never stated that the
deceased was busy in the field, rather the
complainant disclosed that they were on their way
to the fields. When the dead body of the
deceased was found inside the field, then it is for
the complainant to convince that what the
deceased was doing in the field, as the
complainant did not mention the purpose of their
going to the field and even the record did not
show the availability of their property near or at
the place of incident. Another intriguing aspect of
the case, which must be taken into consideration,
is that the dead body was never shifted to the
hospital at the earliest, rather the report was
made to the local police when they arrived to the
spot. The complainant in his cross-examination

disclosed that the dead body remained on the
spot for 10 to 15 minutes and that he informed his
first cousins who in turn informed the police and
reached to the spot along with the police. The
complainant is to explain that how he informed his
relatives, and his relatives are to tell, that how
they informed the local police.

9. The scribe was examined as P.W.04 who
did not mention the names of the persons who
informed him, regarding the tragic incident and he
did not tell that who accompanied him to the spot.
It does not inspire confidence that the witness
instead of coming to the spot waited for police
and when found, they were accompanied to the
spot. Had they been informed regarding the
incident, the witness would rush to the spot
without waiting for police, to accompany. We are
not convinced from what the complainant
disclosed, as by doing so the complainant
displayed an un-natural conduct. Being closely
related, the witnesses would prefer to reach the
spot instead, of waiting for bringing the police to
the spot. The scribe was questioned regarding
the time at which he received information and

regarding the manner in which he reached to the
10

spot, but he did not disclose that he was informed
by P.W Noor Zaman and P.W Shah Zaman and
that they accompanied him to the spot. The scribe
further disclosed that on reaching to the spot he
found the dead body of the deceased inside the
field. When admittedly, the police found the dead
body inside the field and when admittedly, the
scribe did not mention the presence of witnesses,
then presumption can be drawn that the police
after receiving information came to the spot of
and recovered the dead body from the fields.

10. The complainant while reporting the matter
claimed that the unfortunate incident occurred in
his presence, but interestingly, the complainant
did not make efforts to inform the local police, he
did not attempt to remove the dead body of the
deceased from the fields and he did not make
arrangements for a vehicle for the shifting of the
dead body of the deceased. It is interesting to
note that the real son of the deceased did not
bother to touch the dead body of his father, he did
not bother to shift the dead body of the deceased
to the hospital at the earliest, so an unnatural

conduct was displayed by the complainant. The
11

presence of the complainant is not free from
doubt, as the scribe explained that after the injury
sheet and inquest report were prepared,
ambulance was arranged by him and he shifted
the dead body to the hospital, where one
Muhammad Ullah, P.W.3, escorted the dead
body. Had the complainant been present, then he
would have accompanied the dead body to the
hospital, but he admitted that he did not
accompany the dead body to the hospital, rather
P.\Ws Noor Zaman and Shah = Zaman
accompanied the dead body. P.W.3 i.e. the
constable who escorted the dead body from the
spot to the Khyber Medical College, explained
that the ambulance was called by Sajid Khan,
ASI, and he with the help of other police officials
put the dead body from spot in the ambulance.
The lack of interest of the complainant in helping
the local police in removing the dead body from
spot to the ambulance and thereafter to Khyber
Medical College, is a circumstance which cannot
lightly be ignored. If the complainant was present
on the spot along with his relatives, then they

would have shifted the dead body from spot to the
12

ambulance and through ambulance to Khyber
Medical College, but he did not, which suggests
his absence from the spot at the stated time. The
scribe prepared the inquest report, we went
through the same, and found that tampering was
made in the time of death, but the scribe could
not explain that what for the alteration was made.
If, the dead body was hurriedly shifted to the
hospital from the spot and if the matter was
reported soon after arrival of the police to the
spot, then in the relevant column of inquest report

the word clotted ( +4=4« ) should have not been

used, as the report was made promptly, and the
blood must have been collected in liquid form. We
cannot forget that the complainant while reporting
the matter disclosed that the accused/ appellant
fired at them, but the investigating officer
collected one empty of .30 bore from inside the
field and no other empty was found on the spot.
The complainant in his court statement further
explained that the appellant made 3/4 fire shots,
if, we take his statement as correct, then instead
of one empty, the investigating officer would have

recovered may more empties, from the spot. The
13

attending circumstances of the present case do
tell that the incident went un-witnessed and that
the complainant and the local police after
receiving information reached to the spot. On one
hand, the purpose of presence has not been
explained, whereas on the other nothing was
taken into possession which could tell that at the
time of incident the unfortunate deceased was
busy in working in the field. The investigating
officer was asked as to whether he took into
possession agricultural instruments, but he
denied and stated that nothing was taken into
possession, nor produced by the complainant.
The record is silent as for what purpose the
deceased and the complainant went to the spot
and the investigating officer failed to collect any
independent evidence in that regard. Even the
investigating officer did not take pain to place on
file the revenue record explaining the ownership
and possession of the property. When a single
empty was collected from the spot, when the
dead body was removed from inside the field and
when the complainant did not accompany the

dead body of the deceased from spot to the
14

hospital, then we are left with no other option, but
to hold that preliminary investigation was
conducted in the present case. The matter was
reported to the local police on the spot and that
no efforts were made to shift the dead body to the
police station, which in fact indicates that the
complainant was not present on the spot and he
accompanied the police to the spot after receiving
information regarding the tragic incident. Reliance
is placed on case titled Sardar Bibi and another
Vs Munir Ahmad _and_others” (2017 SCMR
344), which reads as follows:-

“Although occurrence took place at
2:00 a.m. and police station was at a
distance of 9 kilometer but report had
been lodged not at the police station
rather at the spot at about 6:00 a.m.
which gave inference that FIR had been
lodged after deliberation and
consultation. The complainant also
admitted during cross-examination that
police recorded his statement after the
spot inspection. He further deposed
that police remained at the spot till 9:30
a.m. and after their departure, he went
to police station and told the name of
accused again in the police station and
his thumb impression was obtained on
his statement in the police station,

whereas according to, prosecution the
15

complaint/fard bayan was prepared at
the spot. Subsequent statement of
complainant in the police station after
9:30 a.m. further confirms _ the
deliberation and consultation on the

part of complainant and the police.

11. The complainant in his Court statement
explained that his cousins i.e. Noor Zaman and
Shah Zaman, brought police to the spot, but
interestingly, these witnesses were not examined.
These witnesses also identified the dead body of
the deceased before the police at the time of
report and before the doctor at the time of
postmortem examination, but they were not
produced. We cannot ignore the status of these
witnesses, as according to the complainant, he
informed these witnesses and in turn they
accompanied the police to the spot. When the
report was made on the spot and when the
complainant did not visit the police station, then
the witnesses should have been produced, as
they could disclose the manner in which the
complainant informed them and the manner in
which they went after the police and the police
accompanied them to the spot. As the most

important witnesses were not produced, so an
16

inference can be drawn that they were not ready
to support the false claim of the complainant, so
an adverse inference can be drawn. As the
complainant and his cousins were hailing from the
same village, so arrival of the witnesses soon
after the incident, that too, in the company of the
local police can be interpreted in no other
manner, but that the complainant also
accompanied them from his village to the spot,
after receiving information of the tragic death of
the deceased. The time between injury and death
is given as immediate, between death and
postmortem as to two to six hours, whereas the
postmortem was conducted at 07:00 p.m. The
delayed postmortem examination has increased
the anxiety of this Court and this Court can
presume that the incident did not occur at the
stated time.

12. The complainant is the sole eyewitness,
and while relying upon the statement of single
eyewitness, much care is needed. As on one
hand the complainant is the son of the deceased,
whereas on the other the report was made on the

spot, so this Court is under the obligation to
17

search for independent corroboration. True that it
is the quality of evidence and not the quantity that
would determine the guilt an accused and equally
true that it is for the prosecution to decide that
which witness should be produced, but at the
same time it must convince that the witness was
trustworthy and confidence inspiring. We are
conscious of the fact that if a single eyewitness
inspires confidence, then the same alone is
sufficient for holding an accused guilty, but the
Courts of law must be careful while relying upon
the same and the prosecution must collect
independent evidence for its corroboration. We
are benefited from the judgment of the apex Court
reported as “Ibrar Hussain and another Vs. The
State” (2020 SCMR 1850), which reads as

follows:-

“With prosecution's multiple failures
on motive, consequential recoveries,
aggravated by a suspect source of
light and delayed postmortem, solitary
statement of a chance witness, may
not be relied without potential risk of
error as the circumstances
cumulatively suggest a scenario other
than what meets the eye. It would be

unsafe to maintain the convictions
18

13. As admittedly the matter was reported on
the spot and as admittedly the dead body was not
shifted to the hospital till arrival of the local police,
so the same has seriously questioned the
presence of the complainant on the spot at the
stated time. The complainant did not receive a
single firearm injury, despite the fact that he was
also fired at. Had the appellant the intention to kill,
then he would have easily killed the complainant,
but the circumstances suggest the absence of the
complainant from the spot at the time of

occurrence.

14. The medical evidence is in conflict with the
ocular account, as the deceased received a
firearm injury on front of his neck, in the mid line,
7 cm above the sternal notch, 7 cm below the
chin, whereas its exit was found as 1.5 x 1.5 cm
left side back of shoulder, 12 cm from midline, 8
cm below the top of shoulder. As admittedly, the
bullet travelled from up to downward, so if the
statement of the complainant is taken to be
correct, then the deceased should have received
an injury with a parallel exit, but the case is

otherwise. The conflict between the medical
19

evidence and ocular account has damaged the
prosecution case beyond repair. True that
medical evidence is confirmatory in nature, but
equally true that when the eyewitness account
lacks confidence and when the prosecution case
is based on the statement of a single eyewitness,
then the conflict between the two would benefit
the accused. As is held in case titled Najaf Ali
shah Vs The State (2021 SCMR 736), wherein it
is held that:-
“The same view was reiterated in
Abdul Jabbar v. State (2010 SCMR
129) when this court observed that
once a single loophole is observed in
a case presented by the prosecution,
such as conflict in the ocular account
and medical evidence or presence of
eye-witnesses being doubtful, the
benefit of such loophole/lacuna in the

prosecution's case automatically goes

in favour of an accused.”
15. The motive was stated to be an altercation
between the appellant and deceased few days
before, but neither the complainant could explain
the cause of altercation, nor he could explain that
where and at what time the altercation took place.

Even the investigating officer failed to collect any
20

evidence in that respect. True that weakness or
absence of motive would hardly be a
circumstance for the acquittal of an accused, but
equally true that when motive is the sole cause of
killing and when the prosecution fails to establish
the same, then it can lead to the acquittal of the
accused. As admittedly, the prosecution failed to
prove the motive, so its failure has created dents
in the prosecution case. As is held in the case of

“Muhammad Ilyas Vs Ishfaq_ alias Munshi_and
others (2022 YLR 1620), it was held that:

“It is well settled that once a motive is
set up it is imperative for _ the
prosecution to prove the same. On
failure whereof adverse inference can be
dawn against the prosecution. Reference
is made to the cases of Muhammad
Khan v. Zakir Hussain PLD 1995 SC 590
and Hakim Ali v .The State 1971 SCMR
432.”

16. It is interesting to note that after few hours
of the incident the appellant surrendered to the
local police. The timely surrender of the appellant
to the local police speaks of his bonafide. Had he
been guilty, then instead of approaching the local
police the appellant would have gone into hiding,

but his volunteered arrest cannot be overlooked,
21

that too, when the complainant could not
convince his presence on the spot.

17. The cumulative effect of what has been
stated above, leads this court to an irresistible
conclusion that the prosecution failed to bring
home guilt against the appellant and that the
learned trial court while handing down the
impugned judgment misdirected itself, both in law
and on facts, hence, the same calls for
interference. The instant criminal appeal is
allowed and the appellant is acquitted of the
charge leveled against him. He be released
forthwith, if not required to be detained in any

other criminal case.
