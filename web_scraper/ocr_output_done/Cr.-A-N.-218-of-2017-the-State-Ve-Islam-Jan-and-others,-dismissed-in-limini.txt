SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.---- The State through
Advocate General Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has filed
under section 417 Cr.PC, this appeal against the
judgment dated 28.04.2017 of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-II, Lakki Marwat, whereby, with
reference to crime report No. 254 dated 11.06.2015 of
Police Station Ghazni Khel, he had acquitted Islam
Jan s/o Sakhi Jan and Sultan Jan s/o Akhya Jan
residents of Tor Lawang Khel, district Lakki Marwat
of the charges under section 302/34 P.P.C.

2. The prosecution case as set forth in the
Murasila Ex:PA is that on 11.05.2015 at 13.00 hours
Mst. Akhtar Bibi (PW-07) aged about 45/46 years
reported the matter to the police that on the eventful

day, she alongwith her son namely Waliullah were on

*Azam Khan/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor & Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad

-2-

their way back to their home from village Lawang

Khel. At about 12.00 hours, when they reached at the

place of occurrence, her son was ahead of her at few

paces, whereas he was followed by her. In the

meanwhile, from the back side Islam Jan son of Sakhi

Jan and Sultan Jan son of Akhya Jan r/o Tor Lawang,

duly armed with Kalashnikovs, riding on a motorcycle

came and stopped their motorcycle near her son. Both

of them came down from their motorcycle. Her son

Waliullah on seeing them tried to run away, but they

opened fire at him with their respective weapons.

Form their firing her son got hit and fell down on the

ground. After commission of offence the accused

decamped from the spot on the same motorcycle.

Motive as alleged in the crime report is previous

blood feud. She charged the accused for commission

of offence.

3. The accused Sultan Jan on _ getting

knowledge of his nomination as an accused, obtained

Transit bail Before Arrest from the Court of District

*Azam Khan/P.S*

(D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor & Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad

-3-

and Sessions Judge, Kohat, on 13.06.2015,

surrendered to the process of law with his specific

plea of alibi. To establish his absence from the spot at

the time of commission of offence, he on 16.06.2015

submitted an application to superintendent of Police

investigation Lakki Marwat for impartial

investigation. After completion of usual investigation,

challan was submitted against the accused Sultan Jan,

while his co-accused Islam Jan was proceeded under

section 512 Cr.PC. The accused Sultan Jan being in

custody, was produced from jail. After compliance of

provision of section 265-C Cr.PC, charge was framed

against him, to which he pleaded not guilty and

claimed trial, whereafter, the prosecution was directed

to produce its evidence.

4. During trial co-accused Islam Jan was

arrested on 18.02.2016, whereafter supplementary

challan was submitted against him on 02.03.2016. The

accused were again charge sheeted, wherein they

denied the allegations and claimed trial. Again the

*Azam Khan/P.S*

(D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor & Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad

-4-

prosecution was directed to produce its evidence. In

order to prove guilt of the accused, the prosecution

produced as many as nine (9) witnesses. Rest of the

prosecution witnesses were abandoned and thus the

prosecution evidence was closed being completed.

Thereafter, the accused were examined under section

342 Cr.PC, wherein they refuted the allegations of

prosecution and professed innocence, however, the

accused Sultan Jan wished to be examined on oath

under section 340(2) Cr.PC and also opted to produce

defence witnesses in support of his plea of alibi. In

support of his contention he appeared as DW-1, and

also produced DW2 to DW4, the learned counsel for

the complainant was given opportunity to cross-

examine the DWs, where-after, the learned defence

counsel also closed his evidence. At the conclusion of

trial the accused were acquitted of the charges vide

judgment dated 28.04.2017, hence, this appeal.

5. It was argued by learned A.A.G

representing the state that the accused have

*Azam Khan/P.S*

(D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor & Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad

-5-

specifically been nominated in the crime report for

committing murder of Wali Ullah; that the version of

complainant, site plan and medico-legal report, if

placed in a juxtaposition, are consistent, inter alia; that

the occurrence has taken place in a broad day light,

therefore, there is no chance of misidentification; that

plea of alibi taken by the accused Sultan Jan could not

be proved; that the prosecution witnesses are

consistent on all the material points, they were cross-

examined at length, but no dent could be caused in

their statements; that the prosecution has proved its

case against the accused beyond a shadow of doubt;

that the impugned judgment is the result of

misreading and non-reading of the evidence on

record, therefore, warrants interference.

6. We have heard the arguments of learned

A.A.G appearing on behalf of the State and have

scanned the record with his eminent assistance.

7. Perusal of the record reflects that the

prosecution case hinges upon the statement of

*Azam Khan/P.S*

(D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor & Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad

-6-

complainant PW-7, solitary eye witness, recovery of

six empties through recovery memo Ex:PW 7/1;

injury sheet Ex:Pw 4/1, inquest report Ex:PW 4/2;

Statement of Ahmad Noor PMO, who conducted the

Post Mortem of the dead-body, PM report Ex:PM,

blood stained garments of deceased produced by

PW3; Statement of I.O Haider Ali the S.H.O PW-4;

Statement of PW-8, who recovered blood stained

earth from the spot, recovered crime empties during

spot inspection and partially investigated the case, and

PW-9, who identified the deadbody of the deceased.

8. The prosecution case begins from the

Murasila, Ex:PA recorded on the statement of the

complainant Mst Akhtar Bibi (PW-7). In order to

justify her journey with her deceased son, she stated

that on the eventful day she had gone to the house of

her parents, but, she failed to produce supportive

evidence in support of her contention, during

investigation or trial. Admittedly, as per site plan

Ex:PB, the place of occurrence is redundant site,

*Azam Khan/P.S*

(D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor & Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad

-7-

surrounded by graveyard and self grown thick

forestry/ trees.

9. Perusal of the record reflects that the

occurrence has not taken place in the manner and

mode as narrated by the complainant (PW-7).

According to this PW-7, there is blood feud between

the parties. It does not appeal to prudent mind that

after committing murder of the son of the complainant

the accused spared her to become a witness against

them, particularly, when she was totally at the mercy

of the accused and nothing precluded them to commit

her murder.

10. Another notable point of the case is that at

the time of occurrence the complainant was in

possession of her personal mobile phone, but strange

enough, she did not inform any of her relative about

the incident and waited there till arrival of police. This

speaks of unnatural conduct of the complainant and

negates her presence on the spot. According to

statement of PW-9 (brother of the complainant), he

*Azam Khan/P.S*

(D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor & Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad

-8-

received information regarding the occurrence at

12.00 noon from one Imran s/o Asmatullah his cousin.

11. Above all, it is written in the Murasila

Ex:PA that the deceased was managed by the

complainant on the spot, but astonishingly neither her

hands nor clothes or at least veil besmeared with

blood, which too falsifies her presence on the spot.

More so, the complainant was neither shown as

identifier of the deadbody on the inquest report ExPW

4/2, rather her two brothers were cited as identifiers.

12. Next we advert to the recovery of six (06)

crime empties of 7.62 bore from the venue of crime,

these empties were sent to the F.S.L, where it was

opined that these empties were fired from one and the

same weapon, which is reflected from F.S.L report

Ex:PD/1, which too falsifies the assertion of

complainant, that, the numbers of assailants were two,

rather it clearly suggest that it was the act of a single

man, resultantly, it also falsify presence of the

complainant Pw-7, on the spot. The above discussion

*Azam Khan/P.S*

(D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor & Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad

-9-

led us to the conclusion that it is an unseen

occurrence.

13. Admittedly, as per statement of the

complainant, after scribing Murasila, he prepared

injury sheet Ex:PW 4/1 & inquest report Ex:PW 4/2.

Perusal of the contents of Murasila clearly shows that

the weapon of offence was specifically mentioned as

“Kalashnikov” whereas in the Ex:PW4/1 and

Ex:PW4/2 the column of weapon of offence has been

filled as Asleha Aatisheen, despite the fact that the

PW-4, deposed that the accused were armed with

Kalashnikovs at the time of lodging the report, 9

empties of 7.62 bore were lying there, which leads to

the conclusion that the above referred documents were

prepared first & thereafter report of the complainant

was recorded in shape of Murasila Ex:PA.

13. Coming to the post mortem report Ex:PM,

admittedly, the PM examination was conducted by

PW-1, Dr. Ahmad Noor in the hospital at 03.00 PM.

According to statement of PW-4, who dispatched the

*Azam Khan/P.S*

(D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor & Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad

-10-

deadbody of the deceased from the spot at 12:30 or

13:30 PM for postmortem examination, but according

to PW-3, he took the deadbody for PM examination of

deadbody at 01:00 PM. This late examination of

deadbody, in view of development of rigor mortis &

time elapsed between death and Post mortem i.e. 2 %

to 4 % hours also creates serious doubt on the

prosecution case concerning time of occurrence as

alleged by the complainant.

14. It is the bounden duty of the prosecution

to prove its case against the deceased beyond a

shadow of doubt, but in the instant case, the

prosecution has miserably failed to substantiate its

case against the accused. So under the circumstances,

there is no need of the accused to discharge the

burden of his plea, but, even then the accused Sultan

Jan in view of his own statement recorded on oath,

wherein he stated that he is serving in PTCL

Department, and during the days of occurrence, he

was posted at Kohat, and that on the eventful day he

*Azam Khan/P.S*

(D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor & Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad

-ll-

was busy in cable work from 0900/0930 Am to 0500

P.M and in support of his stance he produced his

official colleagues as DW-2 to DW-4 respectively.

They were cross-examined by the learned counsel for

the complainant at length but no dent could be caused

in their statements. All of them remained consistent

on the day, and time of work as narrated by accused

sultan Jan in his statement on oath. So the accused has

successfully proved his plea of alibi through natural,

trustworthy and confidence inspiring evidence. On the

eventful day and time he established his presence at

jindi Station at Kohat, there is long distance between

the place of occurrence and place of duty of the

accused & it is humanly not possible for a person to

be present on one and the same time at two different

places with such a long distance. This too belies the

narration of the complainant and her presence on the

spot and makes the testimony of eye-witness PW-7

against him doubtful.

15. We have minutely examined the record,

*Azam Khan/P.S*

(D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor & Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad

-12-

which led us to the definite conclusion that the learned

trial Judge considered each and every aspect of the

case in its true perspective and found that the

statement of complainant (PW-7) not confidence

inspiring and disbelieved her presence on the spot. In

the above mentioned circumstances we agree with the

findings of the learned trial Court. It is now settled

that before the order of acquittal is reversed, it must

be shown that the judgment of learned lower court

was not reasonable or wrong or the result of

misreading or non-reading of the evidence on record.

In this respect we are fortified by the judgment of the

august Supreme Court of Pakistan, reported as

“Ghulam Sikandar Vs Mamraz Khan (PLD 1985 SC

11), wherein it was held as under:

"However, notwithstanding the diversity
of facts and circumstances of each case,
amongst others, some of the important and
consistently followed principles can be clearly
visualised from the cited and other cases-law on
the question of setting aside an acquittal by this

Court. They are as follows:

(1) In an appeal against acquittal the Supreme

Court would not on principle ordinarily

*Azam Khan/P.S*

(D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor & Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad

-13-

interfere and instead would give clue weight
and consideration to the findings of Court
acquitting the accused. This approach is
slightly different than that in an appeal against
conviction when leave is granted only for the re
appraisement of evidence which then is
undertaken so as to see that benefit of every
reasonable doubt should be extended to the
accused. This difference of approach is mainly
conditioned by the fact that the acquittal carries
with it the two well-accepted presumptions: One
initial, till found guilty, the accused is
innocent: and two that again after the trial a
Court below confirmed the assumption of

innocence.

(2) The acquittal will not carry the second
assumption and will also thus lose the first one
if on points having conclusive effect on the end
result the Court below (a) disregarded material
evidence (b) misread such evidence; (c)

received such evidence illegally.

(3) In either case the well-known principle of
re-appraisement of evidence will have to be kept
in view when examining the strength of the views
expressed by the Court below. They will not be
brushed aside lightly on mere assumptions
keeping always in view that a departure from the
normal principle must be necessitated by
obligatory observances of some higher principle

as noted above and for no other reason.

(4) The Court would not interfere with acquittal
merely because on re-appraisal of the evidence it
comes to conclusion different from that of the
Court acquitting the accused provided both the
conclusions are reasonably possible. If, however,
the conclusion reached by that Court was such

that no reasonable person would conceivably

*Azam Khan/P.S*

(D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor & Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad

-14-

reach the same and was impossible then this
Court would interfere in exceptional cases on
overwhelming proof resulting in conclusion and
irresistible conclusion; and that too with a view
only to avoid grave miscarriage of justice and for
no other purpose. The important test visualised in
these cases in this behalf was that the finding
sought to be interfered with after scrutiny under
the foregoing searching light should be found

wholly as artificial, shocking and ridiculous."

16. Similar view was expressed in

Muhammad Iqbal’s case (PLD 1997 SC 569). In this

respect reliance can also be placed on case reported

as “The State Vs Anwar Saifullah Khan” (PLD 2016

Supreme Court 276), wherein it was observed as

follows:

Art. 185--- Appeal against acquittal---Principles
and scope---reversal of finding of acquittal of an
accused was resorted exceptionally by an
appellate Court---such an order was passed
where the finding of the acquitting Court was

found to be perverse, shocking or impossible.”

In this behalf reliance can also be placed

on the cases reported as Ahmad v. Crown (P L D 1951 F

C 107) Fateh Muhammad v. Bagoo (P L D 1960 S C 286)

Abdul Majid v. Superintendent and Remembrancer of

Legal Affairs, Government of East Pakistan (P L D 1964

*Azam Khan/P.S*

(D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor & Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad

-15-

S C 422) Feroz Khan v. Capt. Ghulam Nabi (P L D 1966
S C 424) Usman Khan v. The State (P L D 1969 S C 293)
Noora and another v. The State (P L D 1973 S C 469)
Abdul Rashid v. Umid Ali and another (P L D 1975 SC
227) Taj Muhammad v. Muhammad Yousaf and another
(P L D 1976 S C 234) Farid v. Aslam (P L D 19778 C4)
and Fazalur Rehman v. Abdul Ghani (P L D 1977 S C
529).

17. The whole discussion led us to the
conclusion that solitary statement of complainant
Akhtar Bibi PW-7 is neither trustworthy nor
confidence inspiring hence, not worthy of credence.
The findings recorded by the learned trial Judge,
while acquitting the accused/ respondents were
neither perverse nor arbitrary. Hence, the impugned
judgment dated 28.04.2017 is upheld and the acquittal
of the respondents Islam Jan and Sultan Jan is
maintained.
