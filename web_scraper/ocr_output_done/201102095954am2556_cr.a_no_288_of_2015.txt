JUDGMENT

Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, J.: Without going into the details
and the background of this case and restraining ourselves from
commenting upon the merits of the case we may straightaway
observe that the High Court had remanded the case of respondent
No. 2 to the trial court for holding a de novo trial because the trial
of the said respondent could not be said to be a fair trial as he had
been facing difficulties in his representation before the trial court.
We have gone through the order-sheet of the trial court and have
found that respondent No. 2 did face some difficulties in his
representation before the trial court prior to 06.08.2011 but on the

Criminal Appeal No. 288 of 2015 2

said date Mr. Muhammad Waqas, Advocate filed his Power-of-
Attorney on behalf of the respondent and then till conclusion of the
grial the said learned counsel kept on representing the respondent.
During such representation the said learned counsel had cross-

examined all the proseuction witnesses and at no stage of the trial

any objection had been raised by respondent No. 2 regarding lack
of proper representation on the part of the said learned counsel.
There is nothing available on the record to show that
representation of respondent No. 2 by the said learned counsel had
caused any prejudice to the said respondent or to his case. In
these circumstances the very premise on which the High Court had
remanded the case of respondent No. 2 to the trial court for
holding a de novo trial has been found by us to be misconceived
and against the record. In this view of the matter this appeal is
allowed and the impugned judgment passed by the Peshawar High
Court, Peshawar in Criminal Appeal No. 123-P of 2012 on
09.04.2015 is set aside. It is ordered that the said Criminal Appeal
shall be deemed to be pending before the Peshawar High Court,

Peshawar and the same shall now be decided by the High Court on
