MUHAMMAD NASIR MAHFOOZ, J:-. Through this
writ petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioner has

prayed for the following relief:-

It is, therefore, most humbly prayed that on
acceptance of the instant petition, the
administrative order/proceeding of the respondents
by submission of final report for cancellation of the
FIR and conclusion of the case FIR No.533 dated
02.9.2015 u/s 302 PPC of P.S. Urmar in the form of
un-trace/non-existence of case, may be declared
illegal, unlawful, with malafide intention, contrary
to the established principle of law, contrary to the
evidence on record, without lawful authority and
without jurisdiction and respondents may be
directed to act and investigate the case according to

law.

2. Respondent No.10 allegedly raided the

house of petitioner at 5.45 hours on 02.9.2015 and
opened indiscriminate firing on his son, namely Aslam
Nawaz sleeping in the room who sustained multiple
injuries on the body and died on the spot. The occurrence
was registered vide FIR No.533 dated 02.9.2015,
wherein, respondent No.10 was directly charged
alongwith other police officials. It is further alleged that
on the 4th day of the occurrence a false, concocted and
counterblast FIR No.532 dated 02.9.2015 was registered
under sections 302/353/324/472/148/149/7 ATA against
the present petitioner. Since respondents police officials
were not conducting proper investigation, therefore,
petitioner requested the high up of police officials for
impartial investigation and after his release from bail he
got knowledge that FIR No.533 has been terminated on
the report of police officials, whereby, respondent No.10
was discharged from the commission of the alleged

offence, hence the instant writ petition.

3. Respondents were summoned who
submitted their comments and denied the allegations as

levelled in the instant writ petition.

4. We have heard learned counsel for the
parties and learned AAG and have gone through the

record.
5. The documents annexed with the writ
petition are replete with written request of petitioner
submitted to high up of the police department as well the
officials of administration for redressal of his grievance
as prayed in the instant writ petition. The said request
was also agitated in this court in W.P.No.3636-P/2015
which was dismissed on 18.11.2015 on the ground that it
is pre-mature, however, the prosecution was directed to
investigate the matter in both the cases strictly in
accordance with law and ensure the completion of
investigation expeditiously. Through Cr.Misc (BA)
No.2276-P/2015 filed on 11.3.2016 petitioner was
released on bail by this court. After perusal of report
concluded u/s 173 of the Cr.P.C. the same contents have
been rewritten but finally it has been observed that the
FIR is based on political victimization and hence the
accused be discharged, this report is dated 30.10.2015 in

case FIR No.533 dated 02.9.2015.

6. We have perused the original record and
have arrived at the conclusion that once FIR in a
cognizable offence and that too u/s 302 PPC read with
section 7 ATA and other ancillary sections of law is
registered, it could not be simple quashed by the police

officials specifically when the police officials are accused
of such a serious offence. It appears that the discharge of
accused/respondents has been moulded to circumvent the
process of law which has defeated the ends of justice.
This is not the first petition that the petitioner has moved
in this court but his second petition which prima facie
shows that the police officials are failing to perform their
duties in accordance with law and the grievance of the

petitioner is not being redressed.

7. Under section 173 Cr.P.C. every
investigation shall be completed without unnecessary
delay and where the investigation is not completed within
the period of 14 days from the date of recording of FIR
and interim report shall be forwarded to the court by the
Public Prosecutor. In the instant case, applicability of
section 169 for discharge of the accused is ruled out of
consideration as in cross FIR No.532, petitioner is also
accused for similar offence. In case, the accused/
respondent No.10 has been discharged as per report then
the petitioner also deserves to be treated in a similar
manner, however, in the instant writ petition the subject
matter relates to the wrongful discharge of accused/
respondent No.10 and it is deplorable that despite lapse
of three years from the date of lodging of FIR challan has

not been put in court.
8. Without dilating upon the contents as
mentioned in both the FIRs, we would allow the instant
writ petition and quash the observations made in the
report impugned herein, with the observation that
respondents shall submit challan before the court within a
period of 14 days and initiate trial in both the FIRs. There
shall be no order as to costs.
