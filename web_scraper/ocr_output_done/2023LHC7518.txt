Crl. Appeal No.151 of 2016
Crl. Revision No. 107 of 2016

2. The appellant has filed the titled appeal against his conviction and
sentence, whereas, a criminal revision has been preferred by petitioner
Mst. Bachal Mai (PW.10) for enhancement of sentence of appellant. Since
common questions of law and facts are involved, therefore, both these
matters are being disposed of by means of this single judgment.

3. The prosecution story as given in the judgment of the learned Trial

Court reads as under:-

“ce

. The prosecution case as per complaint Exh.PE is
that on 29.5.2013 deadbody of an unknown woman
was found within the limits of Chak No. 305/TDA near
Dashu minor and PWs Muhammad Anwar as well as
Asghar Ali were present there. The deadbody was sent
to mortuary for postmortem whereas as per police
record photograph of the deadbody, blood stained
earth, moulds of shoe of unknown accused person and
tyre of motorcycle were procured.

It is in the prosecution story that on 06.6.2013
victim was identified by her mother Bachal Mai
PW-10 from her photograph at the proclamation who
further nominated present accused persons Nadim and
Yasir and thereby alleged that Nadim has committed
the murder of her daughter with the help of his co-
accused.

Allegedly deceased Momna Bibi had contracted
marriage with accused Nadim against the will of her
parents but their relations got strained when accused
Nadim forbade her from going to D.G. Khan to see her
mother but she was adamant to go there and she inspite
of restraining by accused Nadim, went to D.G. Khan a
few days before occurrence which annoyed the
accused. Upon this case/FIR 207/13 was registered at
P.S.Fatehpur u/s 302 PPC....”

4. After completion of investigation, a report under section 173
Cr.P.C. was prepared and submitted before the learned trial court. The
learned trial court after observing all codal formalities, as provided under
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 framed charge against the appellant
along with his acquitted co-accused Yasir Ali to which they pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial.

In order to prove its case, the prosecution produced as many as 16
witnesses during the trial. Muhammad Nasrullah, ASI (PW.1) being

moharrar kept one parcel of six moulds of feet and handkerchief of black
Crl. Appeal No.151 of 2016
Crl. Revision No. 107 of 2016

colour, parcel of blood stained earth, parcel of last worn clothes of
deceased, two envelopes and four phials (sealed), one clip, one “Challa”,
one finger ring of green colour, which he kept in the malkhana of the
police station and subsequently handed over to Ghulam Qadir, SI/I,O
(PW.15). Muhammad Younis 578/C (PW.2) was the recovery witness of
moulds of appellant Muhammad Nadeem as well as tyres of motorcycle
prepared by Muhammad Iqbal, foot tracker (PW.11) on the instruction of
the Investigating Officer, which were taken into possession vide recovery
memo (Exh.PA). Mansab Ali Patwari (PW.3) prepared scaled site plans
(Exh.PB and Exh.PB/1) of the place of occurrence. Rashid Imran (PW.8)
and Tahir Saleem alias Tariq Saleem (PW.9) have furnished the evidence
of extrajudicial confession of the appellant. Mst. Bachal Mai mother of
Momna Bibi alias Saba appeared as PW.10 and supported the prosecution
story. Muhammad Iqbal appeared as PW.11 who furnished the feet
tracking evidence. Muhammad Anwar (PW.12) was the witness of
recovery memo of six moulds of footprints and handkerchief as well as
seizure memo of parcel of blood stained earth taken from place of
occurrence (Exh.PK) and (Exh.PL). Muhammad Numan (PW.14) and
Sana Ullah (PW.16) have furnished evidence relating to throwing of a
baby by the accused persons into the canal. Zafar Iqbal, SI (PW.13) and
Ghulam Qadir, SI (PW.15) being Investigating Officers stated about the
various steps taken by them during investigation of the case. The medical
evidence was furnished by Doctor Kausar Parveen, WMO (PW.7) and
issued PMR of Momna Bibi alias Saba as Exh.PF.

Rest of the prosecution witnesses are formal in nature. The
prosecution gave up Ghulam Mustafa, Shahzad Hussain, Haji Allah
Bakhsh , Asghar Ali and Muhammad Akhtar, SI, PWs being unnecessary.
The prosecution also produced documentary evidence in the shape of
Ex.PA to Ex.PV.

5. After completion of prosecution evidence, learned trial court
recorded the statements of the appellant alongwith his acquitted co-
accused Yasir Ali as required under section 342 Cr.P.C. wherein they

controverted the allegations leveled by the prosecution against them and
Crl. Appeal No.151 of 2016
Crl. Revision No. 107 of 2016

professed their innocence. The appellant did not opt to make statement
under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. to disprove the allegations leveled against
him, however, he produced certain documents i.e. Exh.DD and Exh.DE in
his defence evidence.

6. The learned trial court vide judgment dated 22-01-2016 found
Muhammad Nadeem, appellant guilty, convicted and sentenced him as
mentioned above, however, acquitted his co-accused Yasir Ali of the
charge through the same judgment by giving him the benefit of doubt,
hence, the appeal.

7. Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the impugned
judgment is against the law and facts of this case, which resulted into
grave miscarriage of justice; that the prosecution story is nothing but a
cock and bull story which has been engineered by mother of Momna Bibi
alias Saba, deceased; that the appellant has been falsely roped in this case
due to erratic guesswork and malicious intention of alleged witnesses of
extrajudicial confession evidence; that not a single iota of tangible
evidence is available against the appellant to connect him with the
commission of crime, even no direct evidence is available against him and
the prosecution case is entirely based on circumstantial evidence which is
admittedly the weakest type of evidence; that the evidence of
extrajudicial confession as well as last seen were maneuvered and the
witnesses so produced are not reliable; more so evidence of extrajudicial
confession is also very weak type of evidence and cannot be relied upon
and the same could not have been used against him; that the prosecution
has produced Sana Ullah (PW.16) only to fill up the lacuna of the
prosecution evidence and his evidence is not confidence inspiring; that
co-accused of the appellant namely Yasir Ali has been acquitted by the
learned trial court by giving him the benefit of doubt through the same
judgment, which renders the prosecution story highly doubtful; that
medical evidence is merely a supportive circumstance, which cannot take
the place of substantive evidence; that the recoveries at the instance of the
appellant and the report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency are hardly

of any consequence being the embroidery of main allegation, which could
Crl. Appeal No.151 of 2016
Crl. Revision No. 107 of 2016

not be proved by the prosecution through some concrete evidence; that
even the motive subsequently introduced by the prosecution was not
successfully proved. Further submits that the prosecution has badly failed
to bring home the guilt of the appellant beyond any shadow of doubt but
learned trial court ignored all the fallacies of the prosecution case with
surprising ease; that the impugned judgment has been passed by the
learned trial court without application of judicious mind, which is
unsustainable from all corners, hence, prays that the instant appeal may be
accepted and the appellant may be acquitted of the charge leveled against
him.

8. Conversely learned Deputy Prosecutor General assisted by learned
counsel for the complainant vehemently opposes the contentions raised by
learned counsel for the appellant and inter alia maintains that though no
direct evidence is available against the appellant yet the prosecution has
proved its case through circumstantial evidence, the chain of which is
complete in all respects and has well-connected the appellant with the
commission of brutal and ruthless murder of an innocent lady; that the
prosecution witnesses had no ill-will, enmity, malice or mala fide against
the appellant to falsely implicate him in a case involving capital
punishment; that the prosecution version is corroborated by the medical
evidence, recoveries at the instance of the appellant and positive report of
the Punjab Forensic Science Agency. Lasly, submits that the prosecution
has proved its case against the appellant beyond any shadow of doubt,
hence, his appeal may be dismissed.

9. I have anxiously considered the arguments put forth by learned
counsel for the appellant as well as learned Deputy Prosecutor General
assisted by the learned counsel for the complainant and gone through the
record minutely.

10. The facts and circumstances highlighted in FIR (Exh.PE/1) as well
as other evidence led by the prosecution clearly depict that the alleged
occurrence had not been witnessed by anyone and in order to prove its
case, the prosecution has heavily relied upon circumstantial evidence,

which is normally considered as a weak type of evidence. It is well settled
Crl. Appeal No.151 of 2016
Crl. Revision No. 107 of 2016

by now that in such like cases, prosecution is required to link each
circumstance to the other in a manner that it must form a complete,
continuous and unbroken chain of circumstances, firmly connecting the
accused with the alleged offence and if any link is missing then obviously
benefit is to be given to the accused. Reliance is placed upon the esteemed
judgments of the Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as “Hashim Qasim
and another v. The State’ (2017 SCMR 986), “Fayyaz Ahmad v. The
State”’ (2017 SCMR 2026) and “Sadi Ahmad and another v. The State”
(2019 SCMR 1220).

11. In an attempt to prove the accusation against the appellant and to
form a complete chain of circumstances, the prosecution has relied upon
the evidence of extrajudicial confession allegedly made by the appellant
before Rashid Imran (PW.8) and Tahir Saleem alias Tariq Saleem (PW.9),
feet tracking evidence furnished by Muhammad Iqbal (PW.11) coupled

with recoveries, medical evidence and the motive.

12. As far as the first significant piece of evidence in this case i.e.
evidence of extra judicial confession allegedly made by appellant before
Rashid Imran (PW.8) and Tahir Saleem alias Tariq Saleem (PW.9) is
concerned , according to them, on 17-06-2013, they along with Ghulam
Mustafa (given up PW) were present in the drawing room of Rashid Imran
(PW.8) and at about 08:00 p.m. the appellant came there on motorcycle in
perplexed condition and stated before them that due to the immoral
activities of Momna Bibi alias Saba, he (appellant) along with his co-
accused Yasir Ali (since acquitted) murdered her. He (appellant)
requested to get pardon from Sheraz Gul as they were having good

relations with him.

Admittedly, both the supra mentioned PWs are not relatives of
above-said Sheraz Gul. who had no authority or any status in the vicinity
to get pardon from him in favour of the appellant. Rashid Imran (PW.8)
has stated in his cross-examination as under:-

“....Nadim accused did not visit to me _ before
confession on 17.6.2013. When Nadim accused came
Crl. Appeal No.151 of 2016
Crl. Revision No. 107 of 2016

to me Yasir accused was not accompanying him. I did
not attend the funeral ceremony of deceased Mamona
alias Saba. On the confession of accused Nadim before
me, I did not inform the concerned police station.-------
wanna nnn nnn nnn nnn nnn nnn nn nnn nnn nena nnn nnn nnn My statement
u/s 161 Cr.P.C. was recorded in this case at P.S.
Chowk-Azam. I did not make any statement at P.S.
Fatehpur regarding this case. -------------------------------
Accused narrated the story of extra judicial confession
within span of one hour.-------------------------------------
I was also having mobile phone. PW Tariq Saleem was
my driver on my wagon whereas Mustafa was
conductor of the wagon No. 6355. When accused came
to us he was not having any kind of weapon with him.
The time 8.00 p.m. was exactly told by me to the
police in my statement. -------------------------------------

Police Station is at the distance of two K.M. from my
residence.

Similarly, Tahir Saleem alias Tariq Saleem (PW.9) has also

stated in his cross-examination as infra:-

“'..Nadim accused did not visit to me before
confession on 17.6.2023.------------------------------------
Accused was not known to me prior to 17.06.2013,
however, I had seen the accused many time while
passing thereby near to the Baithak of Rashid Imran.
Rashid PW told me the name of the accused. I narrated
the exact narration of the accused to the police relating
to extrajudicial confession. Police station is at a
distance of 2 2 % K.M. from Baithak of Rashid Imran.

The I.O got our statement at P.S. Chowk-azam and
after recording our statements he allowed us to go.
That I.O was related to P.S.Chowk-azam and not
related to any other police station. Accused remained
in Baithak for one hour. During extrajudicial
confession no question was put to the accused by us.
Crl. Appeal No.151 of 2016
Crl. Revision No. 107 of 2016

Neither I nor Rashid Imran remained member of any
committee or contested election of local bodies....”

In view of the statements of the supra-mentioned PWs, the
appellant was empty handed, remained present in the drawing room of
Rashid Imran (PW.8) for about one hour whereas the police station was
located at a distance of two kilometers and one of the PW having a cell
phone, even then they had not tried to apprehend the appellant or even
informed the concerned police, thus, the story narrated by supra-
mentioned prosecution witnesses regarding extrajudicial confession is
highly improbable and does not appeal to common sense. In this
backdrop, the appellant had no necessity to involve himself in an untraced
occurrence involving capital punishment. The aforementioned facts
certainly raise serious doubt about the veracity of witnesses and their
testimonies are not upto the mark to place any reliance upon it. In such
circumstances, I have no option except to hold that the evidence of
extrajudicial confession made by the appellant regarding the incident was
fabricated in order to create some circumstantial evidence in this
unwitnessed tragedy. In the given circumstances, the evidence of
extrajudicial confession does not bear any credibility and that cannot be
permitted to render any sort of help to the case of the prosecution. Even
otherwise, the evidentiary value of extrajudicial confession has been
declared a weak type of evidence by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in

plethora of judgments including in cases titled as “Mst. Asia Bibi v. The

State and others” (PLD 2019 Supreme Court 64) and “Wajeeh-Ul-
Hassan v. The State” (2019 SCMR 1994).

13. Insofar as the evidence of foot tracker Muhammad Iqbal (PW.11)
as well as the report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore
(Exh.PU) are concerned, I have noted that according to him, he was
foot tracker by profession and on 29-05-2013, he was summoned by the
police of Police Station Fatehpur, upon which, he reached in the area of
Chak No. 305/TDA, Tehsil Karor, where dead body of unknown woman
was lying. He prepared four moulds of visible footprints of accused from

near the dead body and two moulds of visible impression of tyres of
Crl. Appeal No.151 of 2016
Crl. Revision No. 107 of 2016

motorcycle. He could identify the accused in a “Foot identification
parade” in the light of moulds of footprints collected from the spot. Police
took into possession aforesaid moulds through recovery memo and his
statement was recorded in this regard. Thereafter, on 16-07-2013, he was
again summoned by the police where foot identification parade was
conducted in presence of the Investigating Officer and he picked up
footprints of appellant in said “foot identification parade” and two moulds
of footprints of Muhammad Nadeem, appellant with shoes i.e. left and
right foot were prepared by him and handed over to the police for their

comparison with the footprints collected from the spot on 29-05-2013.

During cross examination, he (PW.11) stated that he did not tell the
police that moulds were related to open shoes, casual shoes or formal
shoes, boots, Khairri etc. He had not told the police that whether the
moulds relate to the child or adult. He further stated that he had not told
the police that whether footprints were of a female or male. He also stated
that when he reached there 30 to 40 persons were present at the place of
occurrence. Moreover, he further disclosed in his evidence that on
29-05-2013 police did not obtain his signature or impression on his

statement but thereafter police got his thumb impression.

In addition to the above, the prosecution has also examined
Muhammad Anwar (PW.12), the recovery witness of the supra mentioned
moulds of a male and tyres of motorcycle from the spot, who during his
cross examination also stated that before their arrival a few persons were
present at some distance of the dead body. He further stated that it was
7:30/8:00 a.m. in the morning.

I have further noted that there is haunting silence with regard to the
fact that when the above-mentioned PWs reached at the place of
occurrence whether the moulds of the shoes as well as tyres were covered
or not at that time, therefore, it is not probable that the footprints of the

accused would have remained intact during that period.
Crl. Appeal No.151 of 2016
Crl. Revision No. 107 of 2016

There is yet another aspect of the case that the prosecution has also
failed to prove safe custody of abovesaid moulds as statement of Ghulam
Qadir, SI (PW.15) is silent about the fact that on which date and time, he

had handed over the moulds to the moharrar of the police station.

According to the postmortem report (Exh.PF) and statement of
Doctor Kousar Parveen (PW.7) postmortem of the deceased was
conducted on 28-05-2013 whereas according to the statement of
Muhammad Iqbal, foot tracker (PW.11), he prepared moulds of footprints
and impression of tyre of motorcycle on 29-05-2013 from nearby place
where dead body of an unknown woman was lying. When the dead body
was not present at the place of occurrence on 29-05-2013 then whole

evidence of above-mentioned PW had lost its sanctity.

I have also observed that the prosecution desired that the evidence
of Muhammad Iqbal, foot tracker, (PW.11) be treated as expert’s
evidence within the meaning of Article 59 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984, which deals with the “opinion of expert”. It is true that in rural areas
some villagers by constant practice develop a knack to identify the human
footprints and the Courts of this country also with lot of reservations,
consider it as a piece of evidence. Identification of human footprints has
not developed as a definite science so far as we have sciences of
identification of handwriting and fingerprints, therefore, evidence of foot
track described is always treated to be weak type of evidence. Number of
instructions for procuring evidence of footprints found at the scene of
occurrence are laid down in Rule 26 of Chapter XXV of The Punjab
Police Rules, 1934. To better decide the controversy in issue, it is
expedient to have a glance over Rule 26 of Chapter XXV of Punjab
Police Rules, 1934, which reads as under:-

“...25.25. Track law. Provision of law regarding tracking are

contained in Sections 41 and 42 of Act IV of 1872 (Punjab Laws
Act).

25.26 Importance of footprints and track evidence.-
(1) Footprints are of the first importance in the investigation of
crime. For this reason all officers in charge of police stations shall
Crl. Appeal No.151 of 2016
Crl. Revision No. 107 of 2016

instruct their subordinates as well as all lambardars and chukidars
that, when any crime occurs all footprints and other marks existing
on the scene of the crime should be carefully preserved and a watch
set to see that as few persons as possible are permitted to visit the
scene of the crime.

(2) When it is desired to produce of the identity of tracks
found at the scene of or in connection with a crime, the procedure
for securing the record of such evidence shall be similar to that
prescribed in rule 26.32 for the identification of suspects. The
attendance of a magistrate of the highest available status shall be
secured, or, if that is impossible, independent witnesses of reliable
character shall be summoned. In the presence of the magistrate or
other witnesses, and in conformity with any reasonable directions
which they may give, ground shall be prepared for the tests. On this
ground the suspect or suspects, and not less than five other persons
shall be required to walk. The magistrate, or in his absence the
police officer conducting the test, shall record the names of all these
persons and the order in which they enter the test ground. While
these preparations are proceeding the tracker or other witness who
is to be asked to identify the tracks shall be prevented from
approaching the place or seeing any of the persons concerned in the
test. When all preparations are complete the witness shall be called
up and required to examine both the original tracks and those on the
test ground, and thereafter to make his statement. The magistrate or,
in his absence, the police officer conducting the test, shall record
the statement of the witness as to the grounds of his claim to
identify the tracks, and shall put such other questions as he may
deem proper to test his bona fides. The Officer investigating the
case and his assistants shall be allowed no share in the conduct of
the test.

Tracks found, which it is desired to test by comparison as
above, shall be protected immediately on discovery, and their
nature, measurements and peculiarities shall be pretended at the
time in the case diary of the investigating officer.

The details of the preparation of the test ground and the
actions required of the suspect and those with whom his tracts are
mixed must vary according to the circumstances of the case. The
officer conducting the test, in consultation with the magistrate or
independent witnesses, shall so arrange that the identifying witness
may be given a fair chance, but under the strictest safeguards, of
comparing with the original tracks other tracks made on similar
ground and in similar conditions.

(3) The evidence of tracker or other expert described in the
foregoing rule can be substantiated by the preparation of moulds of
other footprints of the criminal or criminals found at the scene of
the crime. The method of making moulds of footprints by means of
plaster of Paris or a composition of two parts of resin to one part of
Crl. Appeal No.151 of 2016
Crl. Revision No. 107 of 2016

wax or paraffin is taught to all students at the '[Police Training
College] but requires practice before an officer can become
proficient. The only advantage in the first method (plaster of Paris)
is the quickness with which the material sets. Resin and wax are
cheap and can be used more than once.

In making moulds for production as evidence the following
precautions should be observed:-

(a) The footprints found on the scene of the crime must be
pointed out to reliable witnesses at the time and these same
witnesses must be present during the preparation of the
moulds. preparing

(b) The latter must also be signed or marked by the witnesses
and the officer them while still setting.

(c) After the procedure described in sub-rule (2) above has
been completed a mould should be prepared in the presence
of the magistrate or witnesses of one of the footprints of the
suspect made in their presence. This mould should be signed
by the magistrate or witnesses when still setting.

(d) Both moulds should be carefully preserved for production
in court for identification by witnesses and comparison by the
court.

Methods of recording footprints-(1) by tracing through
glass-foot-prints found on the ground or other surface, and
(2) by taking impressions of feet direct on to paper, as in the
case of finger impressions, are taught at the [Police Training
College). Such records shall be utilized in the case of
notorious criminals for comparison with footprints found at
the scene of offence. They may also be used to check the
reliability of local tracker.”

I have observed that Rule 26 says that foot tracker should prepare
the mould of footprints of an accused for which he based his opinion in
the presence of Magistrate or witnesses of the footprints of the suspect
made in their presence. It further says that mould of the footprints found
on the scene of crime and the moulds of the footprints identified in the
identification process should be preserved and then produced at the time
of trial for comparison by the Court, but the supra mentioned requirements
of Rule 26 of Chapter XXV of The Punjab Police Rules, 1934 have not

been fulfilled in this case.
Crl. Appeal No.151 of 2016
Crl. Revision No. 107 of 2016

Although, according to the report (Exh.PU) of the Punjab Forensic
Science Agency, Lahore regarding comparison of item 1.4 (questioned
mould of a left shoe impression), with item 2.4, (the suspect “Bata” brand
left shoe) and with item 2.6 (mould of the suspect of left shoe), revealed
similar class and characteristics but as per the said report comparison of
item 1.2, (mould of a tyre track of a zigzag design), with item 2.1, (the
suspect motorcycle tyre of a zigzag design), did not reveal similar class
characteristics. Moreover, according to the supra mentioned report,
comparison of item 1.3, (questioned mould of a right shoe impression),
with item 2.3, (the suspect “Bata” brand right shoe) and with item 2.5,
(mould of the suspect right shoe), did not reveal similar characteristics.
Insufficient detail was observed in item 1.5, (questioned mould of a shoe
impression), and in item 1.6, (questioned mould of a shoe impression),
therefore, no comparison was performed. In this way, the above-said fact
demolishes this evidence completely. The tracker evidence produced by
the prosecution is also found worthless. Even otherwise, it is by now well-
settled law that the evidence of footprints tracker is a weak type of
evidence. Of all kinds of evidence, admitted in a court this may be
regarded as evidence of the least satisfactory character, thus, there is
considerable force in the contention that it will be very unsafe to rely on
footprint tracker’s evidence. At the most, it may be said that the evidence
led against the appellant disclosed grave suspicion of guilt but it did not
raise that high degree of probability on which a conviction should be
based.

14. I have also observed that according to the statement of lady Doctor
Kausar Parveen (PW7) on 28-05-2023, she was posted at WMO, THQ,
Hospital Karor and on the same day dead body of an unknown woman
aged about 35 years was brought for postmortem examination at RHC,
Fatehpur but due to non-availability of WMO matter was referred to THQ,

Hospital Karor and she conducted the postmortem on her body.
Crl. Appeal No.151 of 2016
Crl. Revision No. 107 of 2016

Contrary to above, Mst. Bachal Mai (PW.10) during her cross
examination described the age of her daughter as 17/18 years. Relevant
line of his statement reads as under:-

“'...Momina Bibi was aged about 17/18
years...”

I am of the view that this fact also raises suspicion upon the story of

the prosecution.

15. Now come to the statements of Muhammad Numan (PW.14)
and Sana Ullah (PW.16). According to Sana Ullah (PW.16) on
27-05-2013, he along with Muhammad Numan (PW.14) were going to
meet Sanwal Saeed one of his friend at Bhakkar on motorcar. At about
09:30 p.m. when they reached at metalled road passing parallel to Munda
Canal Bridge on its eastern side near Chak No. 335/TDA, they saw two
persons namely Muhammad Nadeem, appellant and Yasir Ali (since
acquitted) in the light of motorcar, who were previously known to him.
Yasir Ali, accused was holding a baby and in their view he threw the
baby in the canal, then they both while riding on motorcycle ran way.
They both proceeded to Bhakkar to see his friend. On the next day, they
returned to his home at Dera Ghazi Khan. They did not inform anybody at
Layyah. On14-06-2013 in daily newspaper Khabrain, he read a news that
father-in-law of Nadeem Akbar, his cousin as well as his sons
Muhammad Hassan and Ghazanfar had been murdered by the appellant.
Nadeem Akbar, in order to verify said news came at Chowk Azam and
after his return from Chowk Azam to Dera Ghazi Khan, Nadim Akbar
told him that baby which was thrown in the canal by Nadeem and Yasir
Ali, was his son, who was from the wedlock of his former wife namely
Momna Bibi alias Saba (deceased). On 02-07-2013, he came at police
station alongwith Muhammad Numan (PW.14) and got recorded his

statement. Same was the statement of Muhammad Numan (PW. 14).

I have observed that the story narrated by the surpa mentioned PWs
is not acceptable to a prudent mind as they failed to justify their presence

at the canal where the baby was allegedly thrown by the accused persons.
Crl. Appeal No.151 of 2016
Crl. Revision No. 107 of 2016

Moreover, the conduct of the supra mentioned PWs is highly unnatural
because the complainant party was closely related to them and they did
not timely inform the episode of throwing baby in the canal to the police
and remained silent for a long time. I have further noted that Sana Ullah
(PW.16) has also made dishonest improvements to his earlier statement.

Relevant portion of his statement reads as under:-

“1... stated before the I.O. in my statement Exh.DC
that on 27.5.13 I alongwith Numan PW were going to
meet Sanwal Saeed at Bhakkar by motor Car
(confronted with Eh .DC where it is not so recorded). I
stated in my statement before the I.O. that at about
9.30 p.m. we reached at mattle road passing to
parallal to Tail Munda canal on its eastern side near
Chak No.335/TDA (confronted with Exh.DC where it is
not so recorded). I stated in my statement u/s 161
Cr.P.C. we did not inform any at Layyah but we have
seen on 276.5.2013 (confronted with Exh.DC wherein
not so recorded). I stated inmy statement u/s 161
Cr.P.C. that Nadim Akbar was my "Khalazad"
(confronted with Exh.DC wherein not so recorded). I
stated in my statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. that Nadim
Akbar in order to verified the said news at Chowk-
Azam and after his returned from Chowk-Azam to D.G.
Khan Nadim Akbar told me that Baby which was
thrown in the canal (confronted with Exh.DC where it
is not so recorded). It is incorrect to suggest that I
malafidely made dishonest improvement in my
statement just to give undue benefit to the prosecution
case...

In light of above discussion, I have observed that Muhammad
Numan (PW.14) and Sana Ullah (PW.16) have failed to justify their
presence at the relevant time rather they are interested witnesses and their

evidence is not confidence inspiring, which is accordingly discarded.

16. Though, the medical evidence which is in the shape of statement of
lady Doctor Kausar Parveen, WMO (PW.7), who conducted autopsy on
the dead body of Momna Bibi alias Saba, deceased and issued PMR
(Exh.PF), is available but no other trustworthy direct or indirect evidence
is available against the appellant, which could be supportive of the

medical evidence. It is well settled by now that medical evidence is a type
Crl. Appeal No.151 of 2016
Crl. Revision No. 107 of 2016

of supporting evidence, which may confirm the prosecution version with
regard to receipt of injury, nature of the injury, kind of weapon used in the
occurrence but it would not identify the assailant. Reference in this
context may be made to the case of “Muhammad Mansha Vs. the State”

(2018 SCMR 772).

17. I have further noted that co-accused of the appellant Yasir Ali
has been acquitted of the charge through the impugned judgment to whom
effective role was ascribed by the prosecution in the occurrence. Learned
Law Officer assisted by learned counsel for the complainant has candidly
conceded that no appeal against acquittal has been filed either by the State
or the complainant, meaning thereby, Mst. Bachal Mai (PW.10) was
satisfied with his acquittal. It is a trite principle of law and justice that
once prosecution witnesses are disbelieved with respect to a co-accused
then, they cannot be relied upon with regard to the other co-accused
unless they are supported by corroboratory evidence coming from any
independent source and shall be unimpeachable in nature but that is not
available in the present case. Reliance is placed upon the cases titled as
“Shahbaz Vs. The State” (2016 SCMR 1763), and “Pervaiz Khan and
another Vs. The State” (2022 SCMR 393).

18. So far as recovery of Churri (P.8) at the instance of the appellant,
vide recovery memo (Exh.PJ) concealed under the bushes of berry tree is
concerned, the same is not helpful to the prosecution because the report of
Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore is in the negative as human
blood was not identified on item No.1 i.e. Swabs taken from Churri.

19. With regard to the recovery of motorcycle at the pointation of
appellant from his residential house, vide seizure memo (Exh.PR), I have
observed that no registration number, colour, company name has been
described by the prosecution witnesses. In this way, recovery of
motorcycle at the pointation of appellant is inconsequential and not
helpful to the prosecution case. I fortify my view from the dictum laid
down in the case titled as “Naveed Asghar Vs. The State and another”’
(PLD 2021 SC 600).

Crl. Appeal No.151 of 2016
Crl. Revision No. 107 of 2016

20. The only last piece of evidence which still remains in the box of
prosecution is the motive, as per version of Mst. Bachal Mai (PW.10),
Momna Bibi alias Saba (deceased) contracted her second marriage with
the appellant but without their consent. Thereafter, the relations between
the spouses became strained on the issue that Momna Bibi alias Saba was
adamant to visit Dera Ghazi Khan, whereas the appellant restrained her
from going there and due to that grudge, the appellant along with his co-
accused Yasir Ali (since acquitted) committed murder of her daughter. I
have observed that it was merely an oral assertion of Mst. Bachal Mai
(PW.10) and no substantial piece of evidence has been led by the
prosecution to prove the motive part of the occurrence. Furthermore,
according to the testimony of Ghulam Qadir SI/I.O (PW.15), Mst. Bachal
Mai (PW.10) orally stated that Momna Bibi alias Saba (deceased) had
contracted marriage with the appellant against their wishes but she could
not produce any document of Nikkah or the witnesses of Nikkah. In this
way, the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the motive part of the
occurrence. Although, the prosecution is not under obligation to establish
the motive in every murder case but it is also well settled principle of
criminal jurisprudence that if prosecution sets up a motive but fails to

prove it, then, it is the prosecution who has to suffer and not the accused.

Reliance is placed upon the cases titled as “Tajamal Hussain Shah Vs. The
State and another” (2022 SCMR 1567) and “Sarfraz and another Vs. The
State” (2023 SCMR 670).

21. After analyzing the prosecution case from every angle, I have
concluded that the case against the appellant is replete with doubts and his
conviction and sentence cannot be upheld on the basis of such shaky and
untrustworthy evidence. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has time and again
held that in the event of a doubt, its benefit must be given to the accused
not as a matter of grace, but as a matter of right. Reliance is placed upon the
esteemed judgments of the Supreme Court of Pakistan passed in cases titled
as Sajjad Hussain vs. The State and others” (2022 SCMR 1540), “Saghir
Ahmad vs. The State and others” (2023 SCMR 241), “Atta ul Mustafa vs.

Crl. Appeal No.151 of 2016
Crl. Revision No. 107 of 2016

The State and another” (2023 SCMR 1698) and “Barkhurdar vs. The State
and another” (2023 SCMR 1791).
22. For the foregoing reasons, titled appeal is accepted and Muhammad

Nadeem, appellant is acquitted of the charge by extending the benefit of
doubt to him. He is in jail; he be released forthwith if not required in any
other case.

23. As a natural corollary, finding no merit criminal revision filed by
Mst. Bachal Mai (PW.10) for enhancement of sentence of appellant is

dismissed,
