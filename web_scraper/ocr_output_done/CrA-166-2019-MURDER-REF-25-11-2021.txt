JUDGMENT

LAL JAN KHATTAK, _J.- Appellant

Muhammad Aqil has appealed to this court
against the judgment dated 22.02.2019
delivered by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-XIll, Peshawar in case FIR No.352
dated 17.05.2014 under section 302 PPC
registered against him at Police Station
Daudzai, Peshawar, whereby upon
conviction under section 302 (b) PPC, he
has been sentenced to death as Tazir with
compensation of Rs.5,00,000/- payable to
legal heirs of the deceased in terms of
section 544-A Cr.P.C. There is also a
Murder Reference before this court sent by
the learned trial court under section 374

Cr.P.C.
2. Brief facts of the case are that on
17.05.2014, deceased Gul Wali, the then
injured, himself reported to ASI Shah Wali
(PW-3) in the casualty of Lady Reading
Hospital, Peshawar to the effect that on the
day of occurrence he and his brother
Shan Wali (PW-5) were proceeding towards
mosque for offering prayer and when they
reached on crime spot there his brother-in-
law i.e. appellant Muhammad Aqgil was
present who, on seeing him, fired at him with
Aslaha Atisheen as a result of which he was
hit on the right side and back of his
abdomen. Motive for the offence, as given in
the FIR (Ex.PW3/1), was annoyance of the
appellant on the desertion of his wife,
namely, Mst.Zeenat Bibi, who was staying in
the house of the deceased. It is worth to
mention that the complainant later on
succumbed to his injuries on 29.05.2014
and consequently the section of law was
changed from 324 PPC to 302 PPC by the
Investigation Officer.

3. After completion of investigation, the
case was put in court for trial, which indicted
the appellant for commission of the offence

to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed
trial. Prosecution in order to substantiate its
case produced and examined 15 witnesses
in all whereafter statement of the accused
was recorded wherein he professed his
innocence. The learned trial court, after
conclusion of the trial, found the appellant
guilty of the charge and while recording his
conviction sentenced him as mentioned
above which he has assailed through the
instant appeal whereas the learned trial
court has sent Murder Reference for
confirmation or otherwise of the sentence.

4. Arguments heard and record gone
through.

5. Prosecution evidence in the case
consists of ocular account furnished by
PW-5, statement made by the deceased in
the shape of FIR (Ex.PW3/1), recovery of
bloodstained earth from the place of
occurrence through Ex.PC, recovery of
pistol from the appellant (Ex.PW7/2), site
plan (Ex.PB) and motive to the occurrence.
6. The ocular account regarding the
main occurrence was furnished by PW-5,
namely, Shah Wali, brother of the deceased,
who while deposing before the court stated

that on the day of occurrence he and his
deceased brother were proceeding towards
the mosque for offering their maghrib prayer.
The deceased was going ahead of him and
when they reached near the clinic of Dr.Atif,
there the appellant was found present who
started firing at his brother as a result of
which he was hit and seriously injured
whereafter he was taken to the hospital by
him with the help of co-villagers where he
i.e. the then injured reported the matter to
the police. Motive for the occurrence given
by PW-5 was that the appellant was
annoyed over the desertion of his wife who
at the relevant time was put in his house
being his sister.

7. PW-5 is sole eyewitness to the
occurrence and also brother of the
deceased. No doubt, conviction of an
accused can be recorded on the basis of a
solitary eye version account furnished by a
closely related eyewitness but before such
account is relied upon, the court must see
whether the evidence given in the court by
the closely related witness is corroborated
by the circumstantial evidence of the case
and by the conduct shown by the

eyewitness stated to be present on the spot
at the time of occurrence. If seen in the
context of the above, in our considered
opinion, the testimony given by PW-5 gets
no independent corroboration from the
circumstantial aspects of the case.

8. First of all, we doubt the very
presence of PW-5 on the spot at the time of
firing at the deceased. It reflects from the
record that the motive to commit the crime
by the appellant was common towards the
deceased and PW-5 as well and when
motive of an assailant is common towards
the targeted person and the eyewitness and
both of them are found together by the
accused then for selecting the one and
sparing the other, the lucky person i.e. the
one who escaped unhurt or spared must
give some account that what led for his not
being targeted by the common enemy.
Though in his court statement, PW-5 has
stated that at the time of firing the deceased
was proceeding ahead of him and in the site
plan (Ex.PB) too, the witness has been
shown behind the victim but worth noticing
aspect of the case is that in the case
murasila (Ex.PW3/1) the then injured has

not stated that while going to the mosque he
was ahead of his brother. No doubt, it is not
necessary that each and every detail is to be
provided in the FIR but when the
prosecution evidence consists of sole
eyewitness, who is also closely related to
the victim, then, in such circumstance, the
necessary detail becomes necessary so that
it could corroborate presence of the sole
eyewitness on the spot at the time of
occurrence. Assuming that the deceased
was ahead of the eyewitness but even then
the distance between the appellant and the
eyewitness, as per the site plan, is 22 feet
which was not a long distance for the
appellant to spare the eyewitness. True that
it is not necessary for the assailant to have
achieved all his targets he has in his mind
but when he comes fully prepared on the
spot to accomplish his mission then for
doing half of it the spared one must explain
that why he was let off which is not the case
in hand. Remaining unhurt of PW-5 would
show that at the time of firing at his brother
he was not present on the spot, therefore,
his evidence cannot be relied upon for the

safe administration of justice.
9. After discarding presence of PW-5 on
the spot at the time of occurrence, we now
move to have a look at the report which was
lodged by the deceased when he was
brought in injured condition to the hospital.
Though as per the murasila (Ex.PW3/1), the
deceased has mentioned therein. presence
of PW-5 with him on the spot at the time of
occurrence and nominated the appellant for
his firing at him but there is no endorsement
on it by the doctor, who had_ initially
examined him, that at the time of making
report its maker was oriented in time and
space. Unless some opinion is given by the
doctor present in casualty ward of the
hospital qua fitness of the critically injured
person to lodge the report, no legal worth is
to be given to the bare contents of the report
that the complainant was conscious well to
report the matter to police. We also cannot
lose sight of the fact that on the extreme left
corner of the murasila there appears one
cell phone number as 0344-9097115 and
the name of one Hussain Ahmad and
according to PW-3, said Hussain Ahmad
was neither eyewitness to the occurrence

nor there is any material on the case file to
show that he was relative of the deceased.
Non-presence of PW-5 on the spot at the
time of occurrence, as held above, writing of
cell phone No.0344-9097115 and name of
Hussain Ahmad on the case murasila has
led us to believe that the deceased was
taken from the spot by people of the area
and brought to the hospital for treatment.

10. Another pronounced aspect of the
case is that Mst.Zeenat Bibi (PW-6) had
provided her written statement to the
Investigation Officer which he treated as her
161 Cr.P.C. statement and produced the
same before the court as Ex.PW11/4. It is
worth to mention that in her referred
statement PW-6 Mst.Zeenat Bibi has stated
that on 17.05.2014, appellant Muhammad
Aqil had come to their house, started
abusing and also fired at her brother
Gul Wali i.e. the deceased with which he
was critically injured and in unconscious
condition was taken to the hospital. Ibid
aspect of the case also caused cracks in the
prosecution case as to its accuracy. Though
PW-6 has denied any such statement given
to Investigation Officer of the case but as

giving of such statement has been admitted
”

by PW-11 in his court statement, therefore,
denial of PW-6 qua her above 161 Cr.P.C.
statement is of no help to her and the
prosecution as well. Further important
aspect of the case is that the marginal
witnesses to the site plan (Ex.PB) have not
been produced by the prosecution and as
such venue of the spot too is not proved to
corroborate what has been alleged in the
FIR and deposed before the court by PW-5.
11. | True that on the night of occurrence,
the appellant was arrested by PW-7
alongwith a pistol of .30 bore and the
appellant has pleaded his guilt in the case
under section 15 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013 but pleading
of guilt and his such conviction on no count
could be made a ground to record his
conviction in the instant case as it is well
settled that each and every criminal case is
to be decided on its own facts and further as
no empties were recovered from the spot
(Ex.PB), therefore, on this score too the
recovery of pistol and conviction of the
appellant in the referred situation is of little

help to the prosecution.

12. Thorough and careful examination of
the case record would show that the learned
trial court has not appreciated the case
evidence in its true perspective. The
deductions and conclusions drawn by the
learned trial court for recording the
appellant's conviction are not borne out from
the case evidence for which the impugned
judgment cannot be sustained.

13. | For what has been discussed above,
this appeal is allowed, conviction and
sentence recorded by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-XIll, Peshawar vide
impugned judgment dated 22.02.2019 are
set aside and consequently the appellant is
acquitted of the charge levelled against him.
He be released forthwith if not required or
wanted to be detained in any other case.

14. The Murder Reference sent by the
learned trial court for its confirmation is

answered in the negative.

Announced on.
