Officer furnished Postmortem report, which
was placed on the record as EX.PM.
3. Following registration of the FIR, the
same late S.I, who had recorded report of the
complainant in the murasila (EX.PA/1),
himself started investigation, and proceeded
to the scene of occurrence for spot inspection,
where, during spot inspection, he secured
blood from the place assigned in the site plan
X.PB), to the deceased, and also noticed
bullet marks on the scene of occurrence. He
prepared the site plan on the day of
occurrence i.e. 12.03.2000; but made addition
of two points i.e. B and C, the former showing
recovery of five empties of 7.62 bore and the
latter showing presence of injured Taj
Mohallah, later, on 02.06.2000. After arrest of
the appellant-accused, the pointation memo
(EX.PW5/4) of the scene of occurrence was
prepared, but without any recovery oF

discovery as a result of the alleged pointation
of the place of occurrence by the
appellant/accused. The blood stained earth
secured from the spot by the I|.O and the
blood stained garments of the deceased were
sent to FSL for chemical analysis, and report
of the chemical examiner was received in the
affirmative, showing the same as human
blood and of the same group. Likewise, report
of the firearms expert with regard to five
empty shells of 7.62 bore was to the effect
that the same were fired from one and the
ame 7.62 bore rifle. Injured, Taj Mohallah,
was also examined by the Medical Officer,
Lady Doctor Sajida Begum, (PW-8), who
found firearm entrance wound 2 cm x 2 cm on
her left knee joint with corresponding outlet 4
cm x 4 cm adjacent skin grazed wound 2 cm x
2 cm, left femur fractured, and deformed
bone. After recording statements of PWs
under section 161 Cr.P.C and completion of
investigation, supplementary challan in the
case was submitted by the SHO, Police

Station Sheikh Maltoon, Town, leading to
commencement of trial in the trial Court
/Additional Sessions Judge-lV, Mardan.

4. After complying with the mandatory
provision of section 265-C Cr.P.C, the learned
trial Court framed formal charge against the
accused/appellant under sections 302 and
324 PPC, to which he pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. During trial, the prosecution
produced the following nine PWs:-

e Fida Muhammad, Deputy DHO, Swabi
(PW-1), conducted Postmortem
examination of deceased Inamullah and
furnished P.M report (EX.PM);

e Fazal Ahad No.400 (PW-2), executed

appellant/accused;

e Pervez Khan Inspector/SHO, Police
Station, Sheikh Maltoon (PW-3),

e Farooq Hussain ASI (PW-5), conducted

e Lady Doctor Sajida Begum (PW-8),
conducted medical examination of
injured Mst: Taj Mohallah wife of
Firdoos; and

e Madad Khan Inspector (PW-9), deposed
about investigation conducted by late

Hassandali Khan S.1;

5. After prosecution closed its evidence,

statement of the accused-appellant was
10

recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein,
he, besides refuting allegations of the
prosecution, also produced statement of
injured PW Mst: Taj Mohallah in proceedings
under section 512 Cr.P.C against the
accused/appellant on 11.11.2003 in the Court
of the then ASJ-l, Mardan, as EX.DA; but
declined to be examined on Oath. Thereafter,
the learned trial Court/Additional Sessions
Judge-IV, Mardan, heard arguments of
learned SPP for the State assisted by learned
counsel for the complainant and learned
counsel for the accused/appellant; and
rendered the impugned judgment dated
03.11.2016, whereby, the appellant/accused
was convicted and sentenced as mentioned
hereinabove; hence the instant appeal against
the impugned judgment and conviction and
sentence of the appellant/accused.

6. Arguments of learned counsel for the
appellant and learned AAG assisted by
learned counsel for the complainant, heard;

and record perused.
7. In the ‘murasila (EX.PA/1), drafted by
late Hassandali ASI, on the report of
complainant, Zairullah, at 1900 hours on
42.03.2000, about the occurrence, which,
allegedly, took place earlier at 18:30 hours,
the appellant/accused was charged for firing
at the brother of the complainant, Inamullah,
with his Kalashnikov and causing his death in
the presence of the complainant, his son
Shakirullah and son of the deceased, namely,
Hashim Khan; while citing suspicion of the
appellantfaccused about their role in the
murder of his brother, namely, Saleem.
During investigation, this fact also came to
surface that another lady, namely, Taj
Mohallah wife of Firdos resident of Toru, also
sustained firearm injury during the occurrence
and her medical examination was also
conducted by lady Doctor Sajida Begum (PW-
8); but neither this fact was mentioned in the
FIR lodged by the complainant to the police
officer at the spot, nor she could appear in the

Court as a PW = during trial of the
appellant/accused, and abandoned by the
prosecution “being dead”. However, she had
appeared as PW-6 in proceedings under
section 512 Cr.P.C against the
appellant/accused; but had _ categorically
stated in her statement before the Court that
she had neither seen any person firing at her
nor had charged any accused earlier and that
she did not want to charge anyone now (at the
time of recording her statement).

8. In the FIR, only two eyewitnesses have
been mentioned i.e. son of the complainant,
namely, Shakirullah, and son of the deceased
Inamullah, namely, Hashim Khan; thus the
prosecution case comprising of the
complainant, being brother of the deceased,
Shakirullah son of the complainant and
Hashim Khan son of the deceased, without
showing them as witnesses in the inquest
report or the Postmortem report to have
identified the dead body before the police and
the Medical Officer; as two other persons,

namely, Alamgir Khan son of Fida Muhammad
13

and Muhammad Ishaq son of Mir Ahmed were
shown the persons who identified the dead
body before the police as well as before the
Medical Officer; but the former was
abandoned by’ the prosecution as
‘unnecessary and the latter abandoned ‘being
abroad. The non citing of the eyewitnesses
mentioned in the FIR as identifiers of the dead
body before the police and the Medical
Officer; and non production of both the
identifiers of the dead body by the prosecution
tend to create doubt about presence of the
eyewitnesses at the spot at the time of
occurrence, besides raising question about
with-holding of testimony of those persons
who could have narrated actual facts, being
present at the spot at the relevant time.

9. Admittedly, the complainant, the
deceased and both the PWs, Shakirullah and
Hasham Khan, were residing separately from
each other, and in the absence of the purpose
for their joint visit to the fields, nowhere visible

near the scene of occurrence in the site plan,
their assemblage at the spot at the time of
occurrence becomes a distant possibility, thus
creating doubt about their presence on the
spot at the relevant time, especially when
neither the complainant nor the so-called eye
witnesses received any injury so as to lend
credence to their presence on the spot at the
time of occurrence, which is already
shrouded with doubts in the absence of
evidence showing either their hands or clothes
having blood stains despite their claim that
their hands and clothes were smeared with

lood. It is also something beyond imagination
that while motive for the commission of the
offence on the part of the appellant/accused
was imputed not only against the deceased
but also against the complainant and the eye
witnesses as well; but the appellant/accused
would make only deceased a target for his
firing while sparing the complainant and the
eye witnesses to become complainant and
eye witnesses in a case of murder and

attempt to murder against him.
Notwithstanding compromise between the
parties in the murder case of brother of the
appellant/faccused, the deliberate or
unintentional omission on the part of the
prosecution to ask question about motive,
being an incriminating piece of evidence, from
the appellant/accused during recording his
statement under Section 342 Cr.P.C. would
also render case of the prosecution weak on
this account. Their close relationship with the
deceased would become an added factor, in
the circumstances, to bring their presence on
the spot on the eventful date and time under
cloud of doubt, particularly when the only
other independent/injured PW, Mst.Taj
Mahala, showed her complete ignorance
about the assailants in her statement before
the Court during proceedings under Section
512 Cr.P.C against the appellant/accused.

10. The occurrence was reported by the
complainant to late Hassand Ali Khan ASI,
who, without waiting even for registration of

the FIR and entrustment of investigation of the
16

case to him by Incharge of the Police Station
under Section 156 Cr.P.C, himself started
investigation and proceeded to the spot for
spot inspection, and during spot inspection on
12.03.2000 i.e. on the day of occurrence, he
could only notice bullet marks on the wall of
house of Zahoor-ul-Haq i.e. Point-A; but
showed recovery of five empties of 7.62 bore
from added Point-B and also presence of Mst.
Taj Mahala at a distance of three paces from
the deceased and. 8 paces from the
appellant/faccused at added Point-C on
02.06.2000. Apart from the complainant and
the eye witnesses shown closely following the
deceased at varying distances from 8 to 14
paces, they escaped unhurt while Mst.Taj
Mahala received firearm injury from an equal
distance of 8 paces from the
appellant/accused, it is also an admitted fact
that the deceased, the complainant and the
so-called eye witnesses were moving from
South towards North, while the

appellant/accused at Point No.5 in the site
.

17

plan has been shown on their right side; but
not all the entry wounds are from the right
side, as not only fire arm entry wounds No.3
and 4 were on left upper arm lateral side but
two more firearm entry wounds No.7 and 8
were on the left lateral side of chest; and,
likewise, firearm entry wound No.11 was on
the right fore-arm medial aspect, firearm exit
wound No.12 on the right fore-arm lateral
side, fire arm exit wound No.14 was on the
front of right lumber region, besides the entry

ounds having different sizes and
dimensions, like firearm entry wounds No.1 of
the size of % x % cm, entry wounds No.3 and
4 each of 1 x 2 cm, entry wounds No.7 and 8
of 1 x 1.cm, entry wounds No.11, 13 and 15 of
% x % cm, indicating use of different weapons;
but report of the firearms expert showed all
the five 7.62 MM bore crime empties,
recovered from the spot by the 1.0; having
been fired from one and the same 7.62 MM
rifle. It may be added here that complainant,

Zahirullah (PW6) admitted in his statement
before the Court that when the police officer
came tothe spot, he inspected the same and
then he lodged his report to him which was
written, thus suggesting preliminary inquiry
preceding lodging of the report. Besides,
Hasham Khan (PW.7) also stated that scribe
of the report first saw the deceased and also
inspected the spot before recording their
statements and starting investigation.
11. It is by now well established that
abscondence, alone, would not be a substitute
"for substantive evidence, and can be used
only as a corroborative piece of evidence. In
this case, too, abscondence of the
appellant/faccused for considerable period
would not strengthen the otherwise weak case
of the prosecution. Even otherwise, the
prosecution has not been able to prove that
either the appellant/accused had knowledge
of the criminal proceedings against him or the
warrant under Section 204 and proclamation
under Section 87 Cr.P.C were properly

executed; because Fazal Ahad No.400
Nef

(PW.2), who was DFC at the relevant time,
admitted in his statement that he had neither
written CNIC numbers of the attesting
witnesses nor boundaries of house of the
appellant/accused were given and, similarly,
sketch of his house was also not prepared.
12. All the above stated facts would go a
long way to hold that the prosecution was
unable to bring home charge against the
appellant/accused; therefore, there was no
incriminating material before the learned trial
ourt to award the sentence of death to the
appellant/faccused, who deserved to be
extended benefit of doubt, rather doubts and
discrepancies, in the case of the prosecution,
which was wrongfully denied to him, thus
rendering the impugned judgment, conviction
of the appellant/faccused and award of
sentence of death to him liable to be set
aside.
13 Consequently, the appeal is accepted,
and the impugned judgment, together with

conviction and sentence awarded to the
«

20

appellant, are set aside. The appellant is
acquitted of the chargesleveled against him
and be set free forthwith, if not required in any
other case.

14. Murder Reference No.17-P/2016 sent
by the learned trial Court for confirmation of

the sentence is answered in the negative.
