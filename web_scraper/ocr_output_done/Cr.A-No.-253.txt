present appeal.

NAWAB  (0.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
6. Arguments heard and record
perused.
7. It is the case of prosecution,

reported by the injured/complainant Shehzad,
PW-6 on 19.03.2014 at 19:30 P.M, which was
initially incorporated in daily diary No. 53,
Ex. PW-2/1 that at 17:00 P.M on the same
day near to their house in a thoroughfare
where they were cutting fuel wood. In the
meanwhile, Azmatullah, Fayaz sons of
Malang, Malang son of Kashmali and
Thsanullah son of Shah Zafar residents of
Gumbatay came on the path of their house and
we (complainant-party) forbade them from
passing through the said thoroughfare, they
(accused-party) started pelting stones on them,
which injured him on his head and other parts
of the body, whereas Shah Zamin son of Mir

Zaman sustained injury on his right hand,

NAWAB __ (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
Fahad son of Shah Zamin sustained injuries
on his head as well as on other parts of his
body, Mst. Shaista Bibi daughter of Shah
Zamin sustained injuries on her left knee and
other parts of the body, Mehraj-ud-Din son of
Muhammad Khan received injuries on his left
hand and other parts of the body and
Muhammad Khan son of Mir Zaman
sustained injuries on his head, right ear and
rest of the body. It was further stated that the
matter in addition to the complainant-party
was witnessed by Nasir-ud-Din, Mobeen
Khan sons of Muhammad Umar and
Wahidullah son of Rehmat Khan. The
injured/complainant also advanced specific
motive, which was stated to be a dispute over
the using of thoroughfare. It is important to
note, that in the present case not only the

complainant but all the injured/victims have

NAWAB (D.8.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-10-

thumb impressed/put signatures on the FIR in
support of the version of the complainant.

8. It is also evident from record that
counter-version of the accused-party was also
reported at 20:00 P.M. on the same day ie.
19.03.2014, wherein the present appellant
Azmatullah aged about 22/23 years has
reported the matter to the local police, which
was incorporated in daily diary No. 54, Ex.
PW-11/1 to the effect that there is.a common
thoroughfare at Gumbatay, which passes
through the land of Shehzad, the complainant.
On the eventful day, Miraj son of Muhammad
Khan, Rafiullah son of Shah Wazir, Fahad son

of Shah Zamin and the said Shehzad son of

Shahadat Khan had hindered the passage by

putting wood/trunk of the tree in the
thoroughfare and he (Azmattullah) alongwith

Hameedullah, Ihsanullah sons of Shah Zafar

while going through the said way towards
their house, at the relevant time the aforesaid
persons emerged and started beating them
with axe and sticks. As a result thereof, he
(Azmatullah) received injuries on his little
finger and other parts of the body, whereas
Hameedullah received injury on his head and
Ihsanullah sustained injuries on his right foot
and other parts of the body. The occurrence in
addition to the complainant-party was stated
to be witnessed by Saleemullah son of Alam
Khan and Hashmat Khan son of Bakht Zada
residents of Gumbatay. It is stated in the said
Mad report, that the injury sheets of the
complainant and other injured were prepared
by the police and then they were referred to
Dr. Jamil for medical examination, however,
on record their medical examination reports

are not available.

9. In the present case, the
Investigation Officer on 20.03.2014 has
visited the spot and prepared the site plan, Ex.
PW-13/2. The visible fact in the site plan is

the location of Muhammad Khan deceased

and the observations of the Investigation

Officer. The said Investigation Officer has
observed that on the thoroughfare at places
marked as “A’’ and ‘’B’’, the deceased
Muhammad Khan had put a huge trunk of tree
in order to block the said road/thoroughfare
for the passers, however, the said trunk was
later removed which was present at the spot
and from point ‘°C’’ stones 4 in number and
lathy/stick were recovered. At point “1” in the
site plan, the deceased Muhammad Khan has
been shown to have fallen from the
thoroughfare in the fields, which is 12 feet

deep and at the relevant he was unconscious

NAWAB  (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr, Justice Syed Arshad All
-13-

who was hit by the appellant on his head.
From the said place, blood stained earth was
also collected, which was sealed for forensic
test.

The site plan was referred not for
the reason that it a solid piece of evidence but
its utility cannot be ignored being the first
reflection of the spot as indicated or pointed-
out by the eye-witnesses furnished a
panoramic view of the occurrence to
scrutinize the evidence tendered at the trial by
prosecution witnesses. Reliance is placed on
the case law cited as “Iqbal Shah vs the State
(1998 P Cr. LJ 1177)”.

10. Reverting to the ocular evidence,
the ocular-version has been put-forward by
Shehzad, the. injured/complainant, who
appeared as PW-6. In his examination-in-

chief, he has narrated the entire incident as

NAWAB  (D.8.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
we

-14-

stated above. The close perusal of his
examination-in-chief would suggest that no
specific role was given to any of the accused
and there was general allegation of inflicting
injuries from PELTING STONES at them
and there is no allegation of stick blow.
However, during cross-examination through a
question by defence counsel, it came from his
mouth that Muhammad Khan was injured by
Azmatullah. Apart from that, the said witness
has not uttered a single word about the role of
each accused.

It is by now settled that the
accused is not bound by admission made his
counsel. Reliance is place on “Abdul Khalig
vs_the State 1996 SCMR_ 1553”. Hence,
regarding attributing of specific role to the
accused, the prosecution has produced

Mobeen Khan, the said witness according to

NAWAB = (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr, Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-15-

the FIR is the eyewitness of the occurrence,
who was examined as PW-7 and Fahad Khan
son of Shah Zamin, who was one of the
injured who appeared as PW-8. Mobeen,
while appearing in the witness-box has
extended specific role to each accused and
regarding the present convict/appellant, he has
stated that Azmatullah had inflicted stick blow
on the head of Muhammad Khan deceased

and as such he fell in the fields beside the

. thoroughfare, which according to the site plan

is 12 feet deep, as a result thereof, the blood
started oozing from his mouth and ear. The
statement of the said witness was not only
recorded at belated stage i.e. on 20.12.2014
but the story narrated by him in his court
statement is also not in line with the contents
of the FIR and the subsequent statement of the

complainant recorded as PW-6. The FIR was

NAWA8 —(D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Git

-16-

thumb impressed/signed by all the injured/
victims including Muhammad Khan deceased,
who according to the cross-examination of the
doctor Jamil Khan, PW-1 was conscious and
able to record his statement, however, in the
FIR neither any specific role was given to any
of the accused nor the fact that any person has
given stick blow to the deceased Muhammad
Khan, rather it is the case of prosecution that
all the injured including the deceased had
sustained injuries by pelting stones at
them by the accused. Although, the
recording of statements by the prosecution
witnesses at belated stage is no ground to
disbelieve their testimony provided that
the delay in recording the statement is
explained in confidence inspiring manner,
however, without such explanation the

statement of a witness whose statement

NAWAB  (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
cd

-17-

recorded at belated stage is to be ruled out of
consideration. Reliance is placed on case law
cited as ”’Muhammad Sadiq vs the State
PLD 1960 SC 223° Sikander _vs the State,
PLD 1963 SC 17’’, Siraj-ud-Din vs Kala &
others PLD 1964 SC 26 and Muhammad
Akram vs the State & 3 others 1994 SCMR
55Q’’. The said witness in his statement has
not explained that despite his availability why
his statement was not recorded on the same
day and furthermore he has made considerable
dishonest improvements in his statement. It
has now been settled that improvement made
by eye-witness in order to strengthen the
prosecution case, lose his credibility and
evidentiary value and when a witness made
contradictory statement or improvement
changing his version to in line his testimony

with the story of prosecution, if found to be

NAWAB — (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
eth

-18-

deliberate and dishonest, would cast serious

. doubt on his veracity. Reliance is placed on

“Muhammad Rafig vs the State 2010S CM

R385.

11. Now moving on to the statement
of the other injured witness Fahad Khan, the
said Fahad has signed/thumb impressed the
FIR as an injured/eyewitness, however, as
stated above, in the said FIR no specific role
was assigned to any of the accused, therefore,
in subsequent statement which was recorded
by him on 22.03.2014 before police he had
given a specific role to the present appellant
that he has inflicted a stick blow on the head .
of the deceased Muhammad Khan, as a result
of which, he fell down in the fields. While
appearing in the Court, he has also re-affirmed
the said statement, therefore, there is a glaring

contradiction between the first statement

NAWAB_ (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-19-

recorded in the FIR, the statement of the
complainant Shehzad recorded in the Court
and the subsequent statement of this PW
before the Court, hence, he does not appear to
be a truthful witness. In case of “Ghulam
Sarwar_ys the State reported as PLD 1983
Peshawar_152”, a Division Bench of this
Court has observed:- ‘’witnesses bearing
injuries on his person, held, by itself does not
indicate that he has stated the truth’’. Even
during his cross-examination, this witness has
admitted that he does not know the person
who injured him, therefore, if a person does
not make a statement in respect of his own
injury then it is difficult to believe his
testimony regarding the injuries caused to the
other persons.

12. In the present case, despite the

fact that five (5) persons got injured excluding

NAWAB (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Poe

-20-

the deceased, however, all the injured/persons
were not produced before the Court by the
prosecution in support of its case except the
complainant and other injured/eye-witness
Fahad Khan. In the case of “Saeed Ahmad ys

Zamarood Hussain _1981 SCMR_ 795” the

august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held:-
“Fact of eye-witness being ‘injured and
injuries being not self-suffered. Not by itself
indicative of witness having told truth.
Witnesses closely related to deceased while
other persons mentioned in the FIR not
examined. Such fact shows injured eye-
witnesses being desired to withhold material
aspects of case from Court and prosecution
being apprehensive that in case of
independent witnesses being examined their

deposition might support plea of accused.

NAWAB  (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-21-

Acquittal, held, rightly not interfered with by
High Court.”

13. Besides, the above ocular
testimony of the injured and other
corroborative evidence, in the present case,
the then injured now deceased Muhammad
Khan was examined by Dr. Jamil Khan,
Medical Officer, RHC Maidan, PW-1, who
after providing emergency treatment to the
injured found the following injuries on his
body:-

RHC Lal Qila District Dir Lower

Dated:- 19.03.2014

Time of examination: 7:30 PM

Name:- Mohd. Khan s/o Mir Zaman Khan
Village: Gumbatai Maidan Dir Lower
Age:- 60 years male.

HY/O Fight.

Unconscious comatosed (coma) with
bleeding from right ear, wounds on right
side of skull and right jaw with vomiting,
bruises on right side of the face bleeding
from nose and throat.

Referred to DHQ Hospital.

Nature of wounds:- Dangerous

Kind of weapon:- Blunt.

The said injured was initially

referred to DHQ Hospital Timergara and

NAWAB (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-22-

afterwards to LRH Peshawar for further
treatment, but on the way he succumbed to the
injuries and died, therefore, the postmortem of
the deceased was also conducted by the said
doctor Jamil Khan (PW-1), his postmortem
report revealed the following observations:-

“That on surface examination of his body
some dangerous wounds on right ear
with bleeding from right skull wounds
and bruises on right face were found.
Cause of death:- Head injury
Nature of wound:- Dangerous

Kind of weapon:- Blunt.

14. The overall impression of the
entire evidence and the Mad No. 54, Ex. PW-
11/1, if viewed in juxfa position with the site
plan, Ex. PW-13/2, it appears that there was a
free fight between the two parties, however, it
is uncertain that who had inflicted injuries to
the deceased Muhammad Khan. It is also in
the evidence of prosecution that the deceased

had fallen from the path in the fields, which is

NAWAB _(D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
®

-23-

12 feet deep and the doctor in his cross-
examination has also confirmed the
suggestion that injuries on the body of the
deceased Muhammad Khan could be due to
fall from a higher place. In this regard,
reliance is placed on “Farid alias Kala and
others vs The State _and 4 others” (1989
SCMR 939)” wherein it was held by the
august Supreme Court of Pakistan:- “ None of
the witnesses had said anything as to how
injury to accused was caused and at whose
hands. Injuries on the person of accused and
other people were conveniently suppressed by
the eye-witnesses against accused thus was
not free from doubt. Accused acquitted in
circumstances”

Therefore, the rule of safe
administration of justice would be that the

benefit of this doubt must be extended to the

NAWAB = (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr, Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-24-

appellant/accused not as a matter of grace but
as of right.

15. The gist of the whole discussion
is that the prosecution case against the
accused/appellant is pregnant with doubts and
it is settled principle of law that in case of
doubt, the benefit thereof must accrue in
favour of the accused as a matter of right and
not of grace. In this regard, reliance is placed
on the case law cited as “Daniel boyd
(Muslim _name_Saifullah) vs the State”
1992 SCMR_196” , wherein it has been held:-

Nobody is to be punished unless
proved guilty on the basis of reliable
or true evidence---Benefit of every
reasonable doubt is to go to the
accused.

This view is also reflects in the

judgment of the Hon’ble apex Court titled as

“Ghulam Qadir and 2 others vs the State"

NAWAB (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-25-

(2008 SCMR 1221), wherein it was

observed:-

"Benefit of doubt. Principle of
applicability. For the purpose of
benefit of doubt to an, accused,
more than one infirmity is not
required. Single infirmity creates
reasonable doubt in the mind ofa
reasonable and prudent person
regarding the truth of charge,

makes the whole case doubtful. "

In support of the same ratio,
reliance is further placed on the case of the
august Supreme Court of Pakistan cited as

“Muhammad Zaman vs. the State 2014

SCMR 749”, wherein it has been held:-

Even a single doubt if found
reasonable, was enough to warrant
acquittal of the accused.
16. In view of the above discussion,
we are of the absolute view that the
prosecution has failed to prove its case

NAWAB (D.8.) Mr, Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan

Pat

against the accused/appellant beyond any
shadow of doubt; therefore, his conviction
cannot be maintained, resultantly, while
extending him the benefit of doubt, we
accept this appeal by setting aside his
conviction and sentence recorded by the
learned trial Court through the impugned
judgment and acquit him of the charge
levelled against him. He be set free

forthwith, if not required in any other case.

17. These are the reasons of our short

order of even date.
