QAISER RASHID KHAN, J. The — accused/petitioner
Niaz Ali, seeks bail in case FIR No. 42 dated
19.01.2018, under section 9 (c), CNSA, registered at
police station East Cantt, Peshawar , with the allegations
of having been found in possession of 4 Kgs charas.

2. All that the learned counsel for the petitioner
urges is that neither any recovery of the contraband
charas was made from the possession of the petitioner
nor his presence is established at the spot as at that point
of time he was present at Karkhano Market. He further
contends that the registration number of the Mazda
vehicle from which he was allegedly deboarded has not
been mentioned in the FIR and more over, there are
obvious contradictions in the contents of the FIR where
‘charas garda’ is alleged to have been recovered from his

possession while in the FSL report the recovered item has
been shown as ‘brown solid’. He further submits that in
a situation where the personnel of the Excise Narcotics
Squad were present on the spot and the petitioner still
kept the bag in his hand wherefrom the recovery has been
effected does not appeal to a prudent mind and the
circumstances lead the case of the petitioner to one of
further inquiry entitling him to the concession of bail. He
lastly submitted that an application has been submitted to
the concerned authority for holding a fair and impartial
inquiry into the matter.

The learned AAG on his turn resisted the
submissions of the learned counsel for the petitioners and
contends that huge quantity of charas has been recovered

from the immediate possession of the accused/petitioner.

3. Arguments heard and the available record
perused.
4. In a _ situation where there was_ prior

information regarding the smuggling of narcotics by a
passenger to Punjab and where the accused-petitioner
was deboarded by Excise Narcotics Squad from the
vehicle on the pointation of the spy carrying a bag
wherefrom 4 Kgs charas were recovered, then his prima
facie linkage with the commission of the offence cannot
be ruled out at the moment which squarely falls within
the ambit of prohibitory clause section 497 (1) Cr.P.C.

5. So far as the argument of the learned

counsel for the petitioner regarding mentioning of charas
garda in the FIR and ‘brown solid’ in the FSL report is
concerned, such aspect has been dealt with elaborately in
a judgment of this court dated 30.09.2015 in Cr.A No.
466-P of 2014. Lately, an impression has been imparted
regarding the charas garda to be in particle or granular
form which, I am afraid, is indeed not the case. For all
practical purposes, charas garda means the charas in a
raw form and after undergoing some baking process it
turns into charas pukhta. The colour of both charas garda
and charas pukhta is brown, brownish/ dark brown
depending upon the visual evaluation and of course
description by an individual. In this case too, the
contraband charas has been mentioned as brown solid in
the FSL report which is in the affirmative.

6. Accordingly, the petitioner is held
disentitled to the concession of bail and the bail petition
stands dismissed.

7. Needless to mention that the observations
recorded in this order are tentative in nature and shall not
prejudice the proceedings before the learned trial court
where the case be decided on its own merits after

recording evidence.
