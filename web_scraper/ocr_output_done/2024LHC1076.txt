Report under Section: 173 Cr.P.C. (Challan) in the case was prepared
on 10.04.2021 and received in the court on 19.05.2021. Section: 7 of the
Explosive Substances Act, 1908 is hereby reproduced below: -

“7. Restriction on trial of offences. No Court shall
proceed to the trial of any person for an offence against this Act
except with the consent of the Provincial Government [or an officer
authorized in this behalf by the Provincial Government] 2[to which
intimation shall be sent within two days of the registration of the
case] 7[:]]

4[Provided that if the consent is neither received nor refused
within sixty days of the registration of case by the Government such
consent shall be deemed to have been duly given.]

5Punjab Amendment: In Section 7, for the full stop at the end, a
colon shall be substituted and thereafter the following Proviso shall
be added:

"Provided that the consent to proceed to the trial of an
offence under Section 3 or Section 4 of the Act, shall be deemed to
have been given if the Provincial Government does not convey its
decision to the Court within sixty days of the report forwarded to it
under Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (V of
1898).”

Similarly, Section: 19 (8b) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, being relevant, is

also reproduced as under: -
Cri. Appeal No.10214/2022 & 6
Crl. Appeal No.12109/2022.

“(8b) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 7 of the
Explosive Substances Act, 1908 (VI of 1908), or any other law for
the time being in force, if the consent or sanction of the appropriate
authority, where required, is not received within thirty days of the
submission of challan in the Court, the same shall be deemed to have
been given or accorded and the Court shall proceed with the trial of
the case.]”

Therefore, non-production of sanction/consent of Government for trial is not
fatal and same i.e. sanction/consent would be deemed as has been given/
accorded. Hence, afore-mentioned contention of learned counsel in this regard is

without any force thus repelled.

It has been noticed that as per case of prosecution, mentioned in
aforementioned written statement/st: 24 (Ex.PB/1), on spy information, a
raiding team was constituted, raid was conducted, present appellants were
apprehended red handed from the spot and from the possession of Mohib Ullah
(appellant in Crl. Appeal No.12109/2022), a black coloured bag, white coloured
Shalwar Kameez, an I.E.D. made in a plastic bottle, a pistol 30 bore, cash
Rs,1700/-, his original C.N.I.C. and a match box were recovered whereas from
the possession of Muhammad Hanif Tayyab (appellant in Crl. Appeal
No.10214/2022), a black coloured bag, white coloured Shalwar Kameez, a hand
grenade, cash Rs.1400/- and his C.N.I.C. were recovered. Undeniably,
aforementioned articles were recovered from the appellants on 04.04.2021 at
about 05.30 p.m. (evening) within the area of Vacant Plot, Printing Corporation
Pakistan Press, Band Road, Lahore, I.E.D. and hand grenade were kept at a safe
distance under the supervision of Hafiz Muhammad Arsalan 507/CP and staff of
Bomb Disposal Squad was informed, upon which, Riaz Ahmad, Bomb Disposal
Technician (PW-1) reached at the place of occurrence, defused hand grenade and
LE.D., separated two grams explosive from I.E.D., one inch from safety fuse
wire and one inch from prima-cord, sealed the same into parcel and handed over
the same to Inshallah 517/CPL (complainant/PW-4), who took all
aforementioned samples along with articles vide recovery memo Ex.PD and
Ex.PE, respectively; then he drafted the complaint (Ex.PB/1) at 06:50 p.m. on
04.04.2021 and sent the same for chalking out the F.I.R. through Muhammad
Aleem/CP and in the light of the same, First Information Report (F.I.R./Ex.PB)
was recorded on 04.04.2021 at 07:45 p.m. (evening) at Police Station: C.T.D.,
Lahore, which is at a distance of 33/34 kilometers from the place of occurrence

as per Column No4 of the FIR.; hence, in the “peculiar facts and

circumstances” (mentioned above), case has been got registered without

unnecessary/unexplained delay.

It has been straightaway observed by us that Muhammad Khalid,
Inspector (Investigating Officer/PW-6) reached at the place of occurrence, where
complainant handed over all above case properties, police papers and accused
persons to him; in this regard, relevant portion of statement of complainant (PW-
4) is reproduced as under: -

“At about 09:00 P.M. Investigating Officer reached at the place of
occurrence I handed over all the above case properties, police
papers and accused persons to him and Investigating Officer
inspected the place occurrence in my presence.”

Similarly, Muhammad Khalid, Inspector (Investigating Officer) while appearing
before the Court as PW-6 stated about handing over case property to Moharir
(PW-2) as under: -

“I handed over case property to Moharrar and recorded his
statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. and locked the accused to police lock up.”

Likewise, Muhammad Irshad, A.S.I. (Moharir/PW-2) deposed before the court
that Investigating Officer of the case handed over to him four parcels pertaining to
accused Muhammad Hanif Tayyab which were sealed through evidence tape and
eight parcels pertaining to accused Mohib Ullah which were also sealed through
evidence tape, for keeping the same in safe custody and their onward transmission
to the offices of Bomb Disposal Squad and Punjab Forensic Science Agency
respectively; in this regard, relevant portion of statement of the Moharir (PW-2)
is hereby reproduced as under: -

“On the same day, Khalid Inspector, the Investigating Officer of the
case handed over to me four parcels pertaining to accused
Muhammad Hanif Tayyab which were sealed through evidence tape
and eight parcels pertaining to accused Mohib Ullah which were
also sealed through evidence tape, for keeping the same in safe
custody and their onward transmission to the offices of Bomb
Disposal Squad and Punjab Forensic Science Agency respectively. ”

Muhammad Irshad, A.S.I. (Moharir/PW-2) also deposed that on 06.04.2021, he

handed over two parcels consisting upon defused hand grenade and detonating

assembly which were allegedly recovered from accused Muhammad Hanif
Tayyab to Majid Hamayon 471/CPL (PW-3) for their dispatch to the office of
Bomb Disposal Squad; in this regard, relevant portions of his statement are
reproduced below: -

“On 6.4.2021 I handed over two parcels consisting upon defused
hand grenade and detonating assembly which were allegedly
Cri. Appeal No.10214/2022 & 8
Crl. Appeal No.12109/2022.

recovered from accused Hanif Tayyab to Majid Hamayon/CPL for
their dispatch to the office of Bomb Disposal Squad. ”

“Majid Humayon/CPL maintained that due to lapse of time the
parcel which were entrusted to him were not deposited in the office
of Bomb Disposal Squad and he returned the above said parcels to
me on the same day and I kept the same intact.

On 07.4.2021 I again handed over two parcels consisting
upon hand grenade and detonating assembly to Majid
Humayon/CPL for their onward transmission to the office of Bomb
Disposal Squad. So long parcels remained in my custody I did not
tamper the same.”

whereas Majid Humayon 471/CPL (PW-3) while appearing before the court
categorically deposed that on 06.04.2021, he was posted at Police Station: CTD,
Lahore; on the same day, Muhammad Irshad Moharrar Police Station: CTD

handed over to him two parcels said to contain defused _hand grenade_and

detonating assembly for their onward transmission to the office of Bomb Disposal
Squad; further stated that said parcels could not be deposited in the concerned
office because of lapse of time; further deposed that he returned back above said
two parcels intact to the Moharir and on 07.04.2021, Moharir again handed over
to him above said two parcels for their onward transmission to the office of Bomb
Disposal Squad which he deposited in above said office, intact on the same day.
In this regard, relevant portion of statement of Majid Humayon 471/CPL (PW-3)
is reproduced as under: -

“On 06.04.2021 I was posted at Police Station: CTD, Lahore. On the
same day, Muhammad Irshad Moharrar Police Station CTD handed over
to him two parcels said to contain defused hand grenade and detonating
assembly for their onward transmission to the office of Bomb Disposal
Squad. Said parcels could not be deposited in the concerned office
because lapse of time. I returned back above said two parcels intact to the
Moharir. On 07.04.2021, Muhammad Irshad Moharrar, ASI again
handed over to me above said two parcels for their onward transmission
to the office of Bomb Disposal Squad which he deposited in above said
office, intact on the same day.”
(emphasis added)

whereas Riaz Ahmad, Bomb Disposal Technician while appearing before the
Court as PW-1 clearly stated that said two sealed parcels brought by Majid
Humayon Corporal were received on 06.04.2021 along with a letter dated:
04.04.2021 issued by Regional Officer, CTD, Lahore; in this regard, relevant
portions of his statement are reproduced as under: -

“A letter, dated 4.4.2021 issued by Regional Officer CTD, Lahore
received on 6.4.2021 along with two sealed parcels brought by
Majid Humayon Corporal. One sealed parcel said to contain
defused grenade and one sealed parcel said to contain detonating
assembly of hand grenade. I examined both said sealed parcels
Cri. Appeal No.10214/2022 & 9
Crl. Appeal No.12109/2022.

and issued report EX.PA which bears my signature.”

(emphasis added)

“I have not received any parcel relating to instant case

except 64.2021.”
(emphasis added)

Relevant portion of the report (Ex.PA) is scanned below: -

Received two (02) sealed parcel on 06-04-2021 from Corpora! Majid
Hamayuan No. 471/ CPL CTD, Lahore for analysis vide letter under reference.
Tne detail is as under:- .

1. A Parcel having one hand grenade (diffused).

2. A. Parcel having one detonating assembly of hand grenade
Now it is crystal clear that two parcels said to contain defused hand grenade and
detonating assembly were deposited by Majid Humayon 471/CPL (PW-3)
on 07.04.2021 but Riaz Ahmad (PW-1) issued report Ex.PA qua parcels which
were deposited on 06.04.2021 and not on 07.04.2021. Therefore, safe custody as
well as transmission of two parcels said to contain defused grenade and
detonating assembly from police station to the office of Bomb Disposal Squad,
has not been proved in this case. Now law is well settled on the point that
unbroken chain of “safe custody of allegedly recovered case property and parcel
of sample” is to be proved otherwise, conviction is not possible and it is rightly
so because recovery of explosive substance is not a mere corroboratory piece of
evidence rather it constitutes the offence itself and entails punishment. Guidance
in this regard has been sought from the case of “The State through Regional
Director ANF versus Imam Bakhsh” (2018 SCMR 2039); relevant portion

whereof is being reproduced below: -

“

Chain of Custody — Safe custody and safe transmission
9. We have noted above that in Criminal Appeals Nos.523 to

525/2017 and No.22/2018, safe custody and safe transmission of the
alleged drug from the spot of recovery till its receipt by the Narcotics
Testing Laboratory are not satisfactorily established. The chain of
custody begins with the recovery of the seized drug by the Police and
includes the separation of the representative sample(s) of the seized
drug and their dispatch to the Narcotics Testing Laboratory. This
chain of custody, is pivotal, as the entire construct of the Act and the
Rules rests on the Report of the Government Analyst, which in turn
rests on the process of sampling and its safe and secure custody and
transmission to the laboratory. The prosecution must establish that
the chain of custody was unbroken, unsuspicious, indubitable, safe
and secure. Any break in the chain of custody or lapse in the control
of possession of the sample, will cast doubts on the safe custody and
safe transmission of the sample(s) and will impair and vitiate the
conclusiveness_and_ reliability of the Report of the Government
Analyst, thus, rendering it incapable of sustaining conviction. This
Court has already held in Amjad Ali v. State (2012 SCMR 577) and
Crl. Appeal No.10214/2022 & 10
Crl. Appeal No.12109/2022.

Ikramullah v. State (2015 SCMR_ 1002) that where safe custody or

safe transmission of the alleged drug is not established, the Report of

the Government Analyst becomes doubtful and unreliable.

wanna nnn nnn nnn nnn nnn nnn nnn nnn nnn nnn nnn nnn eens The representative samples
of the alleged drug must be in safe custody and undergo safe
transmission from the stage of recovery till it is received_at the

Narcotics Testing Laboratory”
(emphasis added)

In this regard, guidance has also been sought from the case of “Abdul Ghani
and others versus The State and others” (2019 SCMR 608); relevant portion
whereof is being reproduced:-

“There is hardly any occasion for discussing the merits of the case
against the appellants because the record of the case shows that safe
custody of the recovered substance as well as safe transmission of
samples of the recovered substance to the office of the Chemical
Examiner had not been established by the prosecution in this case.
Nisar Ahmed, S.I/SHO complainant (PW1) had stated before the
trial court that he had deposited the recovered substance at the
Malkhana of the local Police Station but admittedly the Moharrir of
the said Police Station had not been produced before the trial court
to depose about safe custody of the recovered substance. It is also
not denied that Ali Sher, H.C. who had delivered the samples of the
recovered substance at the office of the Chemical Examiner had also
not been produced during the trial so as to confirm safe transmission
of the samples of the recovered substance. It has already been
clarified by this Court in the cases of The State through Regional
Director ANF v. Imam Bakhsh and others (2018 SCMR 2039),
Ikramullah and others v. The State (2015 SCMR 1002 and Amjad Ali
vy. The State (2012 SCMR 577) that in a case where safe custody of
the recovered substance or safe transmission of samples of the
recovered substance is not proved by the prosecution through
independent evidence there it cannot be concluded that the
prosecution had succeeded in establishing its case against the
appellants beyond reasonable doubt. The case in hand suffers from
the same legal defects. This appeal is, therefore, allowed, the
convictions and sentences of the appellants recorded and upheld by
the courts below are set aside and they are acquitted of the charge
by extending the benefit of doubt to them. They shall be released
from the jail forthwith if not required to be detained in connection
with any other case.”

(emphasis added)
Further guidance has also been sought from the cases of “Qaiser Khan versus
The State through Advocate-General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar”
(2021 SC M R 363), “Gulzar versus The State” (2021 S C M R 380), “Mst.
Sakina Ramzan versus The State” (2021 SC M R 451), “Zubair Khan versus
The State” (2021 SC M R 492), “Muhammad Shoaib and another versus
Cr. Appeal No.10214/2022 & inl
Cri. Appeal No.12109/2022.

The State” (2022 SCMR 1006) and “Subhanullah versus the State”
(2022 SCMR 1052).

Since safe custody of two parcels of samples said to contain defused
hand grenade and detonating assembly (allegedly recovered from the possession
of Muhammad Hanif Tayyab) has not been proved, therefore, conclusiveness and
reliability of the report of Bomb Disposal Technician (Ex.PA) has been vitiated
and said report is not capable of sustaining conviction to the extent of Muhammad
Hanif Tayyab (appellant in Crl. Appeal No.10214/2022); hence, now there is no
need to discuss other merits of the case to his extent. Resultantly, prosecution has
been failed to prove its case against Muhammad Hanif Tayyab (appellant) beyond
shadow of doubt, thus, there is no need to discuss his defence version. Therefore,
Crl. Appeal No.10214/2022 filed by Muhammad Hanif Tayyab is
allowed/accepted, convictions recorded and sentences awarded to him through
impugned judgment dated: 08.02.2022 passed in case arising out of FIR.
No.07/2021 dated: 04.04.2021 registered under Sections: 4, 5 of the Explosive
Substances Act, 1908, Section: 13-2 (a) of the Arms Ordinance, 1965 and Section: 7
of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 at Police Station: C.T.D., District: Lahore, are
hereby set aside; he is acquitted of the charge and will be released from jail

forthwith if not required in any other case.

8. Now coming to the case of Mohib Ullah (appellant in Crl. Appeal
No.12109/2022, hereinafter to be referred as “appellant”), in order to prove
aforementioned recovery of ILE.D. (P-3) and pistol .30 bore (P-4), taken into
possession vide recovery memo (Ex.PD), prosecution produced Inshallah
Kahloon 517/CP (complainant/PW-4) and Syed Asif Shah 493/CP (PW-3), who
categorically deposed and supported case of the prosecution against the appellant
through their statements recorded during trial of the case, their testimony remained
un-shattered in spite of searching cross-examination and its credibility could not be
shaken; any enmity or animosity of said witnesses against the appellant also could
not come on record. Needless to observe that police officials are as good witnesses
unless it has been proved that they are having ill will or animosity against the
accused/convict; in this regard, reliance is placed upon the case of “NASEER
AHMAD versus The STATE” (2004 SCMR 1361), “TARIQ MEHMOOD
versus The STATE through DEPUTY ATTORNEY-GENERAL,
Peshawar” (PLD 2009 Supreme Court 39) and “AJAB KHAN versus The
STATE” (2022 SCMR 317). Therefore, recovery of aforementioned articles

from possession of the appellant has been proved by the prosecution.

Cri. Appeal No.12109/2022.

Admittedly, Bomb Disposal Squad is meant to defuse explosive
substances like grenade, bomb, detonators, suicide jacket, I.E.D. etc. and make
the recovered explosive substance “safe”; on 04.04.2021, on call of Inshallah
517/CP (complainant/PW-4), Riaz Ahmad, Bomb Disposal Technician (PW-1)
reached at the place of occurrence, defused one grenade, one LE.D. and after
defusing both said articles as well as separating the sample and sealing, handed
over the same to the complainant (PW-4), who took the same along with other
articles into possession vide recovery memo (Ex.PD) and when the Investigating
Officer i.e. Muhammad Khalid, Inspector (PW-6) came at the spot, he handed
over all above case properties along with police papers and accused persons to
him; thereafter, Investigating Officer (PW-6) handed over parcels pertaining to
Mohib Ullah (appellant) for keeping the same in safe custody to Muhammad
Irshad, A.S.I. (Moharir/PW-2); subsequently, four parcels consisting of pistol .30
bore along with six live bullets, sample of explosive, safety fuse and prima-cord
were handed by the Moharir (PW-2) to Syed Asif Shah 493/CP (PW-5), who
deposited three parcels in the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore
whereas returned fourth parcel pertaining to pistol to the Moharir after analysis
by said laboratory; in this regard, relevant portion of statement of PW-2 is
reproduced below: -

“Four parcels consisting upon pistol 30 bore alongwith six live
bullets, sample of explosive, safety fuse and prima cord were
handed over to Asif Shah/CPL for their dispatch to the office of
Punjab Forensic Science Agency. Asif Shah deposited three
parcels in the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency and 4%
parcel qua pistol was returned to me after analysis. So long said
parcels remained in my custody I did not tamper the same.”

Similarly, Syed Asif Shah 493/CP (PW-5) also deposed about receiving of four
parcels from the Moharir on 06.04.2021 and thereafter depositing the same in
the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore; in this regard, relevant
portion of his statement is reproduced as under: -

“On 06.4.2021, Muhammad Irshad Moharrar handed over to me
four sealed parcels, one sealed parcel said to contain samples two
grams explosive, one sealed parcel said to contain sample of one
inch prima cord, one sealed parcel said to contain sample one inch
safety fuse and one sealed parcel said to contain pistol 30-bore
alongwith magazine and six live bullets for its onward transmission
to the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency. I deposited the
same in the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency. One parcel
containing pistol 30-bore and bullets were returned by the Punjab
Forensic Science Agency after its examination. I returned the same
to Muhammad Irshad A.S.I.”

Cri. Appeal No.12109/2022.

For proving safe custody of aforementioned explosive i.e. LE.D. (P-3), samples
and pistol .30 bore (P-4) as well as safe transmission of samples and pistol to the
office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore, aforementioned prosecution
witnesses i.e. Inshallah Kahloon 517/CP (complainant/PW-4), Syed Asif Shah
493/CP (PW-5), Muhammad Khalid, Inspector (Investigating Officer/PW-6);
Muhammad Irshad, A.S.I. (Moharir/PW-2) and Muhammad Fayyaz, Junior
Forensic Scientist (PW-7) categorically deposed about aforesaid facts in their
testimony in the court and their evidence remained un-shattered as discussed
above; therefore, safe custody of aforementioned explosive and pistol .30 bore as
well as safe transmission of samples and pistol to the office of Punjab Forensic

Science Agency, Lahore, intact has been proved beyond shadow of doubt.

As per report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Ex.PG),
Dynamite was identified in 02-grams explosive taken out from I.E.D. i.e. Item 1,
which is an explosive, Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate (PETN) was identified in
Prima-Cord i.e. Item 2, which is also an explosive whereas Black Powder
(mixture of Potassium Nitrate, Sulfur and Carbon) was identified in Safety Fuse
i.e. Item 3, which is also an explosive; for ready reference, relevant portion from

Results and Conclusion of said report is scanned below: -

Resuii a Conciusion: fois

1. Dynamite was identified in item 1. Dynamite is an explosive. ; i

E “Pentacrythritol Tetranitrate (PETN) was identified in item 2. Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate (PETN) is an
explosive. . . i

B- Black Powder (mixture of Potassium Nitrate, Sulfur and Carbon) was identified in item 3. Black
Daurder (mivinre of Potassinm Nitrate. Sulfur and Carbon is an explosive. ,, H

So far as contention of learned counsel for the appellant that Potassium Nitrate,
Sulfur and Carbon are not themselves explosive is concerned, it is relevant to

mention here that first of all we have to define element, mixture and compound.

(i) | Element is the simplest substance that cannot be broken down
by any chemical method.

(ii) Mixture is made from two or more substances physically
combined together.
Cr. Appeal No.10214/2022 & 14
Cri. Appeal No.12109/2022.

(iii) Compound is made of two or more elements chemically
combined together.!

Dynamite is explosive; similarly, Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate (PETN) is also
explosive; Black Powder is a mixture of Potassium Nitrate, Sulfur and Carbon,
which is also an explosive because Potassium Nitrate (KNO3), Sulfur and
Carbon reacting together form Nitrogen and Carbon Dioxide gases, heat energy,
and Potassium Sulfide. The heat causes the gases to expand rapidly producing an
explosive force, providing the propelling action.’. It goes without saying that
element as alone has certain properties but after combining with other elements
in mixture or compound, can have different properties e.g. Hydrogen is
flammable but when it combines with oxygen then result is Water (H20) which
consists of two elements i.e. hydrogen and oxygen but water has entirely
different properties. Hence, this contention of learned counsel for the appellant

is not holding the water.

Prosecution has proved that aforementioned I.E.D (P-3) containing
explosive was found from the possession of the appellant, who (appellant) is
resident of Kohat, came to Lahore having said explosive in possession which
clearly reflects that it was for endangering the life or causing serious injury to
property; hence, recovery of aforementioned explosive substance as defined
under Explosive Substances Act, 1908 from the appellant has been proved.

Similarly, having possession of “explosive substance” without any
lawful justification as mentioned under Section: 6 (ee) of the Anti-Terrorism Act,
1997 and punishable under Section: 7 (ff) of the Act (ibid) has also been proved
against the appellant.

Recovery of pistol (P-4) with magazine and 6-bullets (P-5/1-6)

from the appellant (Mohib Ullah) has also been proved and as per report of
Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Ex.PH), said pistol was found in
mechanical operating condition.
9. Now adverting to the defence version, during statement recorded
under Section: 342 Cr.P.C. in reply to Question No.6 that “Why this case is
registered against you and why the PWs have deposed against you?”, appellant
stated as under: -

MOHIB ULLAH

“On 21.5.2018 I alongwith my real brother Aman Ullah was going
towards Islamabad Airport and when at about 4.30 A.M. we reached
near Railway Crossing Fateh Jang, Rawalpindi Road, two Vigo
Dalas/vehicles stopped us and some persons in plain as well as in
black dresses came out from those vehicles and apprehended me and
took away in their vehicles. My brother got registered a rapt No.5,
dated 26.6.2018 at police post Fateh Jang, District Attock. I was

interrogated traditionally by different agencies but nothing was
found against him. I and my family is patriot as any other citizens of
Pakistan. I was never involved in any anti-state or anti-social
activities. I was interrogated and investigated thoroughly and then
involved in the present case falsely. There is no evidence with the
prosecution to have any connection with my co-accused. My co-
accused was also apprehended much prior to the registration of
instant case. I can give oath on Holy Quran that nothing was taken
into possession from my custody by CTD Authorities.”

Defence version is mere a bald denial; it is relevant to mention here that when
the appellant took plea that a rapt bearing No.5 dated: 25.06.2018 (Ex.DE) was
got registered by his brother namely Aman Ullah at Police Post: City Fateh Jang,
District: Attock regarding his (appellant’s) taking away by some persons wearing
plain black dresses in their vehicle and furthermore that he has been falsely
implicated in this case, then he was himself the best witness to depose entire
detail that who took him, where he was kept in illegal detention for such long
period of 2-years and 10-months (approximately) as said rapt was got recorded
in the year 2018 whereas this F.I.R. was registered in 2021 and of course law
provided a chance to him in this regard through Section: 340(2) Cr.P.C. while
appearing as his own witness in support of his version but he neither opt so nor
any material was produced to show that whether aforementioned rapt was
converted into separate F.I.R., whether it was investigated and what was its final
result/fate. Although, non-appearance of accused under Section: 340(2) Cr.P.C.
for disproving allegation levelled against him, does not create any inference
against him yet when he has taken plea of false implication and his abduction as
well as detention for a long period, then regarding the same, he is the best witness
to prove his said version by appearing so and his non-appearance amounts to
withhold the best evidence. Though Ghulam Dastagir 215/HC while appearing
before the court as DW-3 produced aforementioned rapt (Ex.DE) yet it is
relevant to mention here that he is not scribe of said rapt rather Aman Ullah
(brother of the appellant) got recorded the same through application and Akhlaq
Ahmad A.S.I/Duty Officer of Police Post: City Fateh Jang was scribe of said
rapt but neither Aman Ullah (mentioned above) nor scribe of said rapt
i.e. Akhlaq Ahmad A.S.I. was produced to prove contents of said rapt; merely
producing/getting exhibited document in the court and proving the same are not
one and the same thing rather different phenomena; therefore, same cannot be
relied upon; in this regard, guidance has been sought from the case of “SOMAID
and another vs. ALI GOHAR alias GOHAR ZAMAN and others” (2019

SCMR 1008); relevant portion of said case law is reproduced as under: -
Cr. Appeal No.10214/2022 & 16
Cri. Appeal No.12109/2022.

“the person who records dying declaration is therefore a most important
witness to verify veracity thereof. He is conspicuously missing in the array
of witnesses and thus declaration, Exhibit PA, cannot be relied upon
without potential risk of error.”

Bank account statement (Ex. DH/1-7) as well as evidence of Muhammad Sabir,
Officer Grade-2, United Bank, Lahore (DW-5) produced by the appellant in his
defence is not a proof to show that the appellant was in custody during said
period. Therefore, aforementioned version of the appellant i.e. bald denial has
neither been proved nor caused any dent in the case of prosecution and same is

even otherwise of no avail.

10. Now, when case of the prosecution has been kept in juxta position
with aforementioned defence version/plea taken by Mohib Ullah (appellant),
then it is crystal clear that defence version neither could be proved nor could
create any dent in the case of the prosecution rather prosecution has proved its
case against Mohib Ullah (appellant) beyond shadow of doubts. Therefore, the
appellant has been rightly convicted Under Section: 4 of the Explosive Substances
Act, 1908, under Section: 7-1 (ff) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and Under
Section: 13 of the Arms Ordinance, 1965; hence, all aforementioned convictions
recorded against the appellant under aforementioned offences are maintained, his
whole property stands forfeited under Section: 5-A of the Explosive Substances
Act, 1908 to the government; however the sentence awarded to the appellant
under Section: 4 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 is “reduced to 7-years”
whereas under Section: 7-1 (ff) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 is “reduced from

Life Imprisonment to 14-years” however sentence to the extent of offence under

Section: 13-2(a) of the Arms Ordinance, 1965, amount of fine imposed upon the
appellant by the trial court as well as sentence in default thereof will remain
intact. Benefit of Section: 382-B Cr.P.C. will be extended to the appellant. All
the sentences of imprisonment shall run concurrently. Resultantly, Crl. Appeal
No.12109/2022 filed by Mohib Ullah (appellant) is hereby dismissed with

aforementioned modification in the quantum of sentences.
