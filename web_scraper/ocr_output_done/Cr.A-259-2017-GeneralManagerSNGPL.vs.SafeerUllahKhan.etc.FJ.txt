ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J:- This is an appeal under section
Thirteen (13) of the Gas (Theft Control & Recovery)
Act, 2016 by the appellants against the order/judgment
dated 12.4.2017 passed by learned Additional District &
Sessions Judge/Gas Utility Court, Peshawar whereby the
complaint filed by the appellants against the respondents

was disposed of.

2. A complaint was filed by the present

appellants under section Five (5) the Gas (Theft
Control & Recovery) Act, 2016 before the Additional
District & Sessions Judge/ Gas Utility Court stating that
they conducted a raid on the chips factory of respondents
situated in Gulshan Abad, Kohat Road, Peshawar, made
digging near the. respondent/consumer’s Hujra door and
discovered another underground gas connection which
was disconnected, the meter No.CU00049026 was
removed/disconnected from the premises. It was prayed
in the complaint that necessary action may be taken as
per law against the accused and recovery be made as per
Gas (Theft Control & Recovery) Act, 2016. The initial
arguments were heard by the learned Additional District
Judge-I/Gas Utility Court, Peshawar and disposed of the
same holding that the appropriate way for the company
would be to lodge report/complaint to the police of P.S
concerned against the present respondents. Feeling
aggrieved with the above order, the appellants have filed

the instant Criminal Appeal before this Court.

3. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
parties heard and record perused with their valuable

assistance.
4. Learned counsel for the appellant
submitted that its special law which has prevalence over
common law. That the Gas (Theft Control & Recovery)
Act, 2016, being special law provides procedure for the
controversy in question according to which a complaint
will be filed to Judge, Gas Utility Court under section 5
sub section 2 of the Gas Theft, Control & Recovery
Act, 2016. He further argued that the proceedings before
the Gas Utility Court shall be deemed to be judicial
proceedings, therefore the ground given in the impugned
judgement is not according to the law. That the learned
court below has failed to properly appreciate
complainant’s arguments/evidence and material available
on record in its true and correct legal perspective,

therefore, liable to be set aside.

5. While repelling the arguments of
appellant’s counsel, respondent’s counsel contended that
the order of the learned lower court is well reasoned. He
also produced bill wherein the respondents have been
shown a domestic consumer. He further argued that the
findings of the learned lower court is based on correct
appreciation of law on the subject and material available

on record, thus the complaint was rightly dismissed.
6. Record reveals that the present appellants
filed a complaint before the learned Additional District
Judge-I/Gas Utility Court, Peshawar against the
respondents for taking action against them on the
allegations that they had taken illegal gas supply
connection for running their chips factory. The learned
Gas Utility Court disposed the complaint vide order

dated 12.4.2017 with the following observations:

“However, in view of the above the
court observes that the appropriate
way for the company would be to
lodge report/complaint to the police
of the P.S concerned where the
police shall, after recording report of
the complainant, proceed further as
it usually proceeds in other Sessions
cases by lodging FIR, arresting the
accused, if necessary, investigating
the matter as other cases are
investigated and submit challan
through the Illaqa/Magistrate, who
Shall forward that u/s 190 (2) of the
Cr.P.C, if he deems apt, to this court
for taking cognizance under the Gas
(Theft Control & Recovery) Act,
2016 and try to the offence in
accordance with the procedure
provided in the Cr.P.C.”

7. To deal with such like matters as the one
before this court, a mechanism has been laid down in the
Gas (Theft Control & Recovery) Act, 2016. The mode
of proceedings to be conducted against a person who
committed an offence under this Act is provided in

section 5 (2) of the Act which is referred as under:

“Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Act, a
Gas Utility Court shall not take
cognizance of any offence
punishable under this Act except
upon a complaint made in writing
by a person authorized in this behalf
by a Gas Utility Company in respect
of which the offence was

committed.”
8. Similarly Section 6 (1) of the Act ibid
further clarifies the mode of procedure in the following
wordings:

“6. Procedure for complaints and
suits for default before Gas Utility

Courts. (1). Where a person is
involved in an offence under this

Act or where there are sums due or
9.
would clarify that appellants herein being Gas Utility
Company were required to file complaint before the Gas
Utility Court against the present respondents who had
allegedly taken illegal gas supply for their chips factory.

Complaint as defined under section 4 (h) Criminal

recoverable from any person, or
where a consumer has a dispute
regarding billing or metering
against a Gas Utility Company, a
consumer or Gas Utility Company,
as the case may be, may file a
complaint or suit, as the case may
be, before a Gas Utility Court as
prescribed by the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 (Act V of 1908) or
the Code of Criminal Procedure
1898 (Act V of 1898).

Reading of the above quoted sections

Procedure Code, 1898 reads as under:-

“Complaint. “Complaint” means
the allegation made orally or in
writing to a Magistrate, with a view
to this taking action under this
Code, that some person whether
known or unknown, has committed
an offence, but it does not include

the reports of a police-officer”
It is clearly embedded in section 4 (h) that
there shall be allegation orally or in writing but shall not
include a police report. The order of learned trial court
that the appellants should have filed complaint to the
local police and thereafter F.I-R should have been
registered is against the provisions of Cr.P.C which has

been made applicable by section 6 of the ibid Act.

10. Section Six (6) further lays down a
mechanism for submission of complaint before the Gas
Utility Court. Last three lines of section Six (6) of ibid
Act are replicated as follow “may file a complaint or
suit, as the case may be, before a Gas Utility Court as
prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act V
of 1908) or the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1998 (
Act V of 1898)” while section 200 and 201 Cr.P.C caters
only with complaints which are to be filed before a

Magistrate.

Section 200 and 201 of the Criminal
Procedure Code read as under:

“200. Examination of complaint. A
Magistrate taking cognizance of an
offence on complaint shall at once

examine the complaint upon oath,
and the substance of the examination
Shall be reduced to writing and shall
be signed by the complainant, and
also by Magistrate.

“201. Procedure by Magistrate not
competent to take cognizance of the
case (1) if the complaint has been
made in writing to a Magistrate who
is not competent to take cognizance
of the case, he shall return the
complaint for presentation to the
proper Court with an endorsement to
that effect.

(2). If the complaint has not been
made in writing such Magistrate
Shall direct the complainant to the

proper Court.”
11. The provisions of section 190 (3) Cr.P.C
would operate only when the complaint is submitted
under the general law and not under the special law as
that of the present case, in the present case the special
court has been constituted under section Three (3) (1) of
the Act. The text of section 3 (1) is reproduced below:

“The Federal Government may, in
consultation with Chief Justice of
the High Court concerned, and by
notification in the official gazette,

establish as many Gas Utility Courts
in a district as it may deem
necessary for the purpose of this Act
and appoint a Judge for each of
such Courts from amongst the
District and Sessions Judges in that

district.”

Similarly section 4 deals with jurisdiction
of the Gas Utility Court which is reproduced as under:-

“Exclusive Jurisdiction of Gas
Utility Court. (1). A Gas Utility
Court shall have — exclusive
jurisdiction with respect to all
matters covered by this Act.”

(2) The Court having jurisdiction
under this Act shall be a Gas Utility
Court having jurisdiction in the
place in which the Gas Utility
Company, consumer, gas producer
or offender, as the case may be, is

situated.”

12. Under the Interpretation of Statutes
“Special Law” shall have prevalence over the general
law whenever there is conflict in between the two.
Special Court is not required under the mandate of law to
comply with the provisions of section 190 (3) Cr.P.C.

Moreover, under the [Illegal Dispossession Act, courts
directly take cognizance, without complying with the
provisions of section 190 Cr.P.C. The Sessions Court was
competent to entertain and try complaint, the Court could
take cognizance itself as mentioned in Section 4 of said
Act or entrust the same to Additional Sessions Judge and
to generally follow procedure provided in Illegal
Dispossession Act, 2005, however, provisions of Cr.P.C
would be applicable during proceedings, but subject to
provisions of the said Act and such complaint was not
required to be routed through Magistrate under section
190 (2) and 193 Cr.P.C Reliance in this respect is placed
on 2006 YLR-2686 “Sardar Sajjad Haidar Khan and
others vs Habibullah Aamir and others”. The said
view was also reiterated in the following judgments of
the different Courts.

1. 2012 P.CrL.J 1817 “Anjum Mubashar
Mughal vs Additional District & Sessions
Judge, Islamabad and others”

2. PLD 2007 Lahore-104 Muhammad
Nawaz vs The State and 3 others” and

3. 2007 P.Cr.L.J 1881 “Zahoor Ahmad vs
Abdul Aziz and 8 others”

13. The learned Additional District Judge

being empowered under section 3 of the Act ibid to act
as Gas Utility Court was required to take cognizance of
the offence punishable under this Act and to entertain the
complaint filed before it by the present appellants. So the
learned Additional Sessions Judge, while
deciding/disposing the complaint filed before it in a

slipshod manner has landed into the field of error.

14. In view of the above, the instant appeal is
accepted, the order of learned Additional Sessions Judge
Judge-I/Gas Utility Court, Peshawar dated 12.4.2017 is
set aside. The complaint filed before the said learned
court is deemed to be pending with the direction to the
learned ASJ-I/Gas Utility Court to decide the same
strictly in accordance with the law on the subject. Parties

are directed to appear before the learned ASJ-I/Gas

Utility Court, Peshawar on 22.08.2017.
