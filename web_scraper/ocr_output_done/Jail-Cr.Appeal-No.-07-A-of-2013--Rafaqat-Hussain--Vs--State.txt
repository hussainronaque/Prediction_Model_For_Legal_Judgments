ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- This criminal appeal is directed

against the judgment dated 21.12.2012 of the learned

Additional Sessions Judge-II, Haripur delivered in case

FIR No. 36/10 dated 06.06.2010 under sections 302 / 109

PPC registered at Railway Police Station Havelian District

Abbottabad whereby the appellant has been convicted

under Section 302 (b) PPC and sentenced to death with a

compensation amount of Rs.2,00,000/- payable to the

legal heirs of the deceased under Section 544-A Cr.P.C or

in default to suffer further imprisonment for six months.

2. Since the learned trial Judge has also sent Murder

Reference bearing No. 01-A/2013 against the appellant for

confirmation of his death sentence, therefore, both these
matters, being the outcome of one and same trial, are to be

disposed of by way of this single judgment.

3. According to the initial report made by Mushtaq Ali

Shah (PW-8) to Javed Iqbal, SHO PS Railway Havelian

(PW-11), it was on 05.06.2010 at 23:40 hours when

Sadaqat Hussain, his adopted brother, informed him about

the death of his deceased son namely, Ahsan Ali Shah,

who was murdered by someone with firearm, thus he

rushed to the place of occurrence and found the

information correct, however, he did not charge anybody

in the FIR for commission of the offence and requested for

investigation. Later on the police, during the course of

investigation and after collecting information from mobile

data, the complainant recorded his supplementary

statement on 07.06.2010 wherein he has charged not only

the present appellant but his father Sadaqat Hussain as

well. The former was arrested on 30.06.2010 while the

latter was arrested on 01.07.2010.
4. After completion of the investigation, challan was

submitted against the appellant and his co-accused

(Sadaqat Hussain) before the learned trial Judge, who were

formally charge sheeted, to which they pleaded not guilty

and claimed trial. However, in order to prove its case at the

trial, the prosecution examined as many as eleven (11)

witnesses in all.

5. After close of prosecution evidence, statements of

appellant (Rafaqat Hussain) and his co-accused (Sadaqat

Hussain) were recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein

they denied the allegations leveled against them. However,

they neither opted to be examined on oath under section

340 (2) Cr.P.C nor wished to produced defence evidence,

thus, the trial culminated into acquittal of the co-accused

(Sadaqat Hussain) and conviction of the present appellant,

who was sentenced as above, hence, the present appeal.

6. The learned counsel for the appellant argued that

the impugned judgment is against law which is the result

of misreading and nonreading of evidence as it is a blind

murder and initially nobody was charged in the FIR, but
later on the complainant got recorded his supplementary

statement and charged the appellant and his co-accused

(father and son) for commission of the offence and that the

recoveries were planted against the appellant and

dubiously procured, besides the fact that there is no

obvious motive which could connect the appellant with the

commission of offence except circumstantial evidence

which too is neither consistent nor confidence inspiring.

He further contended that neither the confessional

statement is true nor voluntary being retracted before

commencement of the trial and prays for the acquittal of

the appellant.

7. On the other hand, the learned counsel assisted by

the learned AAG argued that although the occurrence is

unwitnessed and no one was charged in the FIR but soon

after the occurrence the police on the basis of mobile data

collected including supplementary statement of the

complainant charged the appellant for commission of the

offence. They further argued that not only the crime

weapon was recovered on the pointation of the appellant
but the empties, recovered from the spot, when sent to the

firearm expert for analysis report of the same was received

in affirmative. They lastly contended that the appellant

himself and without any duress or pressure embraced the

guilt by recording his confessional statement, wherein he

confessed that the deceased was keeping evil eye on his

sister namely, Mst. Rukhsana, that’s why he killed the

deceased, thus, the judgment of the learned trial court is

not open to any exception.

8. We have heard the arguments of learned counsel for

the parties as well as the learned AAG and gone through

the record with their valuable assistance.

9. It transpires from the record that father of the

appellant (Sadagat Hussain) informed the complainant

(PW08) qua the incident on the night of occurrence and

when the latter reached the spot, there the police

contingent were already present, to whom he reported the

matter which was incorporated into murasila Ex.PA/1 and

later on FIR was lodged on the next day of the occurrence.

After conducting investigation, the police arrived at the
conclusion that it was the appellant and his father, who

immediately before commission of the offence had called

the deceased but the complainant too while recording his

supplementary statement stated that when the deceased

came to his house, he was called upon by the appellant

(Rafaqat Hussain) and soon after taking meal, the deceased

left the house whereafter he did not turn up and lastly the

co-accused (Sadaqat Hussain) came to his house and

informed him about the tragedy that the dead body of his

son was lying on the railway track. It is also discernible

from the record that while in custody the appellant led the

police party to his house on 30.06.2010 and on his

pointation discovered mobile phone of the deceased from

beneath of sofa but again on 02.07.2010 he again led the

police party and on his pointation the crime weapon was

also recovered from bushes near the place of occurrence

for which a separate FIR No. 41/10 was registered on

02.07.2010 against him.

10. On 03.07.2010 the appellant when produced before

the learned Judicial Magistrate (PW-9) confessed his guilt
by mentioning in detail the reason of murder of the
deceased as below:

However, the appellant retracted from his confession.
11. In this case the only substantive piece of evidence
with the prosecution is confessional statement of the
appellant. From perusal of the same it transpires that the

same is voluntary and according to the narration of the
occurrence because the appellant had disclosed such facts

which otherwise were neither known to the complainant

nor to the investigating officer that the deceased was

keeping evil eyes on his sister, thus, the confessional

statement in view of the appellant’s disclosure regarding

the family honour has rightly been believed by the learned

trial court, duly corroborated by the recovery of pistol at

the pointation of the appellant vide recovery memo Ex.

PW-1/4 and positive report of the forearm expert.

12. The contention of learned counsel for the appellant

is that the confessional statement was retraced soon before

commencement of the trial. This court is of the view that

even conviction can be based on retracted judicial

confession provided it is true and voluntary and

corroborated by some strong piece of independent

evidence. In this case the confession of the accused was

recorded not only in accordance with Sections 164 / 364

Cr.P.C but also in accordance with the provisions of High

Court Rules and Orders.
13. It is well embedded principle of the criminal justice

that when there is no other evidence then the confession or

for that matter the statement of the accused is to be taken

in totality. The court is not left with any choice but to take

into consideration the same in toto. Of course, if there is

other convincing evidence with the prosecution then the

exculpatory part of the confessional statement can be

discarded but in the present case no evidence has been led

by the prosecution which contradicts the exculpatory part

of the confession, so this court would take the entire

confessional statement into consideration inclusive of both

exculpatory and inculpatory. In this regard for

advantageous purpose reliance can be placed on the case

law reported as PLD 1978 SC 200 titled “Najib Raza

Rehmani Vs. The State” where the following view was

taken by the Apex Court: -

“Another illegality in the judgments under
appeal is that the conviction of the
appellant by both the Courts is really
based, as I explained, on this so-called

confession only. But as this so-called
10

confession was a repudiation of liability,
what the Courts did was that they accepted
those passages in the statement Exh. P. Z.
which appeared in their opinion to support
the case of the prosecution and they
rejected the exculpatory part of the
statement. Mr. Ismail submitted that it was
open to a Court to base a conviction solely
on the confession or on the statement of an
accused, but in that event the Court, could
not reject that part of the statement or
confession which went against the

prosecution case.”

14. Besides the above, in the case titled “Faiz and

another Vs. The State” reported as 1983 SCMR 76 the

Hon’ble Apex Court has held as under: -

“The judgment of the High Court makes it
abundantly clear that the ocular evidence
was totally discarded and the only material
utilized by the Court for determining the
guilt of the appellants was the "defence
version". There were no proved or
established facts to test the defence version.
This distinguishes the decision in
Imamudain's case which had proved or
established facts. In Balmakund case a
reference to Full Bench of the High Court
became necessary because the Judges

hearing the case found the exculpatory
11

part of the statement of the accused to be so
unworthy of belief that no Court could act

upon them.”

15. The above view has further been strengthened by

the Hon’ble Apex Court in the case titled “Sultan Khan Vs.

Sher Khan and others” reported as PLD 1991 SC 520

where it has been held as under: -

“After excluding the entire prosecution
evidence against the accused, the question
calls for determination is whether the
statement of the accused is to be accepted
as a whole or exculpatory part of the
statement could be excluded from
consideration and. his conviction can be
based on the inculpatory statement. There
is no doubt that the statement of an
accused recorded under §.342, Cr.P.C. may
be taken into consideration but the Court
cannot select out of the statement the
passage which goes against the accused.
Such statement must be accepted or
rejected as a whole. The Federal Court in
Rahim Bakhsh vy. Crown P L D 1952 F.C. 1
has observed that "if the conviction of the
petitioner is to be based solely on his
statement in Court it is obvious that this
statement should be _ taken into
consideration in its entirety". The

statement of an accused should be taken
12

into consideration in its entirety and not
merely the inculpatory part of it to the
exclusion of the exculpatory part unless
there is other reliable evidence which
supplements the prosecution case. In such
a condition, the exculpatory part if proved
to be false may be _ excluded. See
Balmakund v. Emperor A I R 1931 All. 1;
Sher Gul v. Emperor A I R 1935 Lah. 671,
Muzaffar Khan v. The State P L D 1956
(W.P.) Lah. 1045, Mohan Lal v. Ajeet
Singh AIR 1978 SC 1183 and Ghulam
Muhammad v. The State P L D 1961
(W.P.) Lah. 146.”

16. Now adverting to the quantum of sentence that

whether the learned trial court was justified by awarding

death sentence to the appellant on the strength of the

evidence led by the prosecution in the present case. In our

view the learned trial Judge has rightly found guilty the

appellant but has erred in law while awarding him death

sentence because the appellant was empty handed and the

deceased was having pistol which he took out and aimed at

the appellant, which was snatched from him by the

appellant and thereafter he fired at the deceased with his
13

own pistol, so it is lack of pre-meditation on the part of the

appellant and it is a case of self defence but, in our view,

the appellant has exceeded the same by firing two shots

upon the deceased.

17. After the promulgation of “Qisas and Diyat

Ordinance” all the matters which were initially dealt with

by Section 304 PPC (repealed) are now to be considered

under Section 302 (c) PPC and this question has been

settled by the Apex Court in the case titled “The State Vs.

Muhammad Hanif & 05 others” 1992 SCMR 2047 where

the following view has been taken: -

"Muhammad Hanif has taken the plea of
grave and sudden provocation which is not
available to him now as section 300, P.P.C.
has been substituted by a new section 300,
P.P.C. and the exceptions contained in the old
section have been deleted. The definition of
Qatle-i-Amd has been given in the new section
300, P.P.C. Any how it serves as a mitigating
circumstance in favour of Muhammad Hanif.
Another fact that he has taken revenge of the
murder of his brother Khurshid is also an
extenuating circumstance which goes in his
favour. I find Muhammad Hanif guilty under
section 302(c), P.P.C. and award him ten
14

years’ rigorous imprisonment. Muhammad
Hanif accused is also directed to pay.
Rs.25,000 as Arsh to the heirs of the deceased,
in default of the payment of the said amount,
he shall further undergo __ rigorous

imprisonment for two years."

18. The above view has further been elaborately
discussed by emphasizing the Quranic Verse by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case titled “Ali Muhammad

Vs. Ali Muhammad & others” PLD 1996 SC 274.

19. It is well entrenched principle of law that even if an
accused does not take the plea of self defence and it is
discernible from the prosecution evidence then, benefit of
the same is to be given to the accused and the same cannot
be taken into consideration. In this regard, reliance may be
placed on the case law reported as 1993 SCMR 417 titled
“Ashiq Hussain Vs. The State” as well as 1993 SCMR

1628 titled “Zaheer Din Vs. The State”.

20. In this case, the deceased first pulled out his pistol
upon the appellant and during scuffle the appellant

snatched it from him and whereafter the incident
15

occurrence, so in our view a case for self defence is made

out, however, the appellant has exceeded the same by

firing at the deceased two fire shots, thus, in the

circumstances, this appeal is partially allowed. Conviction

of the appellant is altered from Section 302 (b) PPC to

Section 302 (c) PPC and as such his sentence is modified

from death to fourteen (14) years R.I while the sentence of

payment of compensation amount of Rs.2,00,000/-,

payable to the legal heirs of the deceased under Section

544-A Cr.P.C shall remain intact, recoverable as arrears of

land revenue and in default thereof he shall also suffer

further imprisonment for six months. Benefit of Section

382-B Cr.P.C is also extended to the appellant.

The Murder Reference is answered in the negative.
