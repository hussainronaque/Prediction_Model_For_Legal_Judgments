SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J:-- The State through learned

Addl. A.G has called in question the judgment dated 20.05.2015 of
learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Lakki Marwat, whereby
accused/ respondent Arif Momin was acquitted in case F.I.R No.345
dated 12.10.2013 registered under sections 302/324 PPC at Police

station Ghazni Khel, district Lakki Marwat.

2. The concise facts as disclosed through the First

Information Report are that on 12.10.2013 at 08.45 hours,

-2-

complainant Haji Muhammad Yaqoob Khan (PW-8) brought the
dead body of his maternal uncle namely Ajmal Khan with the help
of co villagers to the police station Ghazni Khel and lodged a report
to the effect that on the eventful day at 08.10 hours, he alongwith his
maternal uncle Ajmal Khan, his cousin Asifullah, their co-villagers
were coming to the market of cattle fair, situated at Adda Ghazni
Khel and when they reached to the metal road situated at village
Titter Khel and were waiting there for conveyance, in the meanwhile
respondent/accused Arif Momin son of Momin Khan resident of
Titter Khel, duly armed with Kalashnikov emerged on the scene and
immediately started firing upon them with the intention to commit
their Qatl-i-Amd, resultantly, his maternal uncle Ajmal Khan got hit,
and fell to the ground, while they escaped unhurt luckily; that after
the occurrence, respondent/accused fled away from the spot; that
thereafter they immediately arranged a vehicle for his uncle to take
him to Police station for lodging the report but on the way, he
succumbed to the injuries. Motive for the offence was stated to be

previous blood feud between the parties.

3. The report of the complainant Haji Yaqoob Khan was
reduced into writing in shape of F.I.R (ibid) (Ex.PA) by Abdul Hai
ASI (PW-4), prepared injury sheet Ex.PW 4/1 and inquest report
Ex.PW-4/2 of the deceased and sent the dead body to the mortuary
at RHC Titter Khel for post mortem examination under the escort of
constable Islam-ud-Din No.763, while F.I.R was handed over to

Abdur Rahim SI for investigation, who after completion of
-3-

investigation handed over the case file to the SI Mufiz Khan (PW-6),
who submitted complete challan under section 512 Cr.P.C before
the learned trial court and after arrest of accuse by Syed Azam SHO
(PW-1), he submitted supplementary challan on 10-06-2014. On
commencement of trial, accused/respondent was summoned; he was
produced before the court in custody. The learned trial court after
complying with codal formalities u/s 265-C framed the charge
against him, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
Prosecution in order to prove guilt of accused produced and
examined as many nine (9) PWs and closed its evidence. Statement
of respondent/accused was recorded U/S 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he
neither wished to be examined on oath nor withed to produce

evidence in his defence.

4, On conclusion of trial, and hearing arguments of
learned counsel for the parties, the learned trial court acquitted the
respondent/accused Arif Momin vide judgment dated 20.05.2015,

impugned herein through the instant Criminal appeal.

5. We have heard arguments of learned Asst. A.G
appearing on behalf of the State, learned counsel for the
respondent/accused and have scanned the available record with his

eminent assistance.

6. It was on 13.10.2013, while waiting for transport at
bus stop Tetar Khel, the deceased was fired at, who lost his life and
charge was brought against the respondent. The story was unfolded

by Yaqoob Khan that, while waiting for transport at but stop Tatar
-4-

Khel alongwith the deceased and one Arifullah, the respondent
emerged duly armed, started firing at them to commit their murder,
which proved effective for the deceased, who got hit whereas they
escaped unhurt, while on their way to hospital the deceased breathed
his last and so the matter was reported at Police Station, Ghazni

Khel.

7. Both the complainant and eye-witness are cousins
inter-se, whereas the deceased was their maternal uncle. The
deceased and eye-witness Arifullah were stated to be living in a
common house to west of the spot, whereas the complainant was
dwelling towards east. It was the complainant, who disclosed the
cause as blood feud by referring two incidents where he too was the

victim of assault.

8. The learned Asstt. A.G while representing the state
criticized the impugned judgment as being arbitrary and without
application of judicial mind to the evidence available on file, both
oral and documentary. It was submitted that single accused was
charged and that substitution is a rear phenomenon. It was further
submitted that the prosecution has proved its case to the hilt through
trustworthy and confidence inspiring witnesses. True, that singe
accused is charged and equally true that substitution in case of single
accused is a rear phenomenon, but it never relaxes the courts to take
it for granted and award convictions that too on capital charge. It is
the bounden duty of the Courts of law to assess and reassess the

material on file, so to avoid injustice having been committed.

-5-
In case titled, Ghulam Rabbani Vs Muhammad
Younis and another (2016 P Cr. LJ Note-6) it is held that.

“8. True that accused is singularly
charged for murder of deceased Ghulam
Muhammad and no doubt the Hon ble
Supreme Court in plethora of judgments
has held that substitution of single
accused in a murder charge is a rare
Phenomenon, but still to put the rope
around the neck of an accused charged
singularly, there must be ocular account
of unimpeachable character, trustworthy
and confidence inspiring, corroborated
by other material circumstantial

evidence.”

9. The prosecution is to prove that witnesses were present
on the spot and that the incident occurred in the mode and manner
and that the report was promptly lodged without consultation and
deliberations. The report tells that all the three were on their way to
cattle fair, but it has not been brought on record that when and where
they planed and left as the houses of the complainant and the
deceased were lying west and east of the spot. Their reaching to the
spot is nothing but a coincidence, as the purpose was not shared
earlier. The complainant was examined as PW-08, who stated that
when they reached to the spot the respondent emerged and started
firing at them, which resulted into injuries on person of the deceased.
He further stated that they escaped unhurt as they laid down and they

got up when the respondent left the spot. We are not ready to accept

-6-

the explanation so tendered as the complainant stated that the
deceased had no ill will, with the acquitted respondent and this is on
record that in fact the blood feud did exist between the complainant
and the respondent. It is astonishing that why the deceased was
chosen as the target, when the complainant being the prime target
was present on the spot. The complainant, eye-witness and the
deceased were maintaining a distance of two paces, where as the
respondent has been shown at a distance of 9 paces, with no
hindrance in between, so while lying on the ground the complainant
if present would have been the easiest target. The complainant could
not maintain consistency in his own statement as initially he stated
that the accused emerged and fired at them, but later on, he divulged
that after firing three shots on the deceased they were fired at. The
veracity of the witness lost its worth when he stated that at the time
of incident he was armed with a Kalashnikov, but surprisingly, when
the respondent was leaving the spot was not fired at, had he been
present on the spot, duly armed, the result would have been
otherwise. The prosecution failed to say that why the deceased was

targeted, when the complainant had the blood feud.

10. This was argued that the matter was reported within
the shortest span of time; and that the charge was not the result of
consultation and deliberations, but mere promptness of report is not
a guarantee to success and it alone cannot certify the witness as
truthful, rather the Court is to see the accumulative effect of what the

prosecution has collected. The prosecution is still struggling to
-7-

answer that who accompanied the deceased then injured to the
hospital. The complainant displayed an unnatural conduct when he
stated that the co-villagers accompanied dead-body to the hospital
and he came to the spot from Police Station, surprisingly both the
witnesses did not identify the deceased at the time when the inquest
report was prepared and even at the time of post mortem
examination. The prosecution could not establish presence of the
complainant on the spot and it was none else but the complainant
who placed himself to open doubt by making dishonest
improvements. Though, the matter was reported in the Police
Station, but when the complainant was asked that why no efforts
were made to shift the deceased in injured condition to hospital to
save his life, his reply stunned all, that the injured was initially
shifted to the hospital, while on reaching they found the hospital
deserted, so they went to Police Station to report, conversely, the
Investigating Officer stated that there were numerous hospitals in the
area and that all the hospitals are well equipped with doctors and

equipments.

11. The report was made in Police Station Ghazni Khel,
which was penned down by one Abdul Hai, Asstt: Sub Inspector,
who was examined as PW-04, who stated that he also prepared the
inquest report and injury sheet, he submitted that neither F.I.R No.
nor section of law has been mentioned on the inquest report but what
surprised us that the name of the deceased has not been mentioned

therein and the prosecution is still to answer that whose inquest that
-8-

was, as its identity still requests an answer. What we gather from is
that in fact the nearby people rushed the deceased to the Police
Station where preliminary investigation was carried out and it was

then when the complainant was procured and the report was made.

In case titled, “Muhammad Rafiq alias Feega Vs The
State (2019 SCMR 1068), wherein it is held that:

“In such circumstances, the most
natural inference would be that the
delay so caused was for preliminary
investigation and prior consultation to
nominate the accused and plant eye-
witnesses of the crime. In similar
circumstances, this Court, in the case of
Irshad Ahmad v. The State (2011 SCMR
1190), observed that the noticeable delay
in post mortem examination of the dead
body is generally suggestive of a real
possibility that time had been consumed
by the police in procuring and planting
eye-witnesses before preparing police

papers necessary for the same.”

12. The Investigating Officer visited the spot, where blood
from the place of deceased was recovered and also three empties of
7.62 bore. The empties were sent to the Forensic Sciences
Laboratory which were received on 22.10.2013, where it was opined
that all the three empties were fired from one and the same weapon.
Though learned counsel stressed that the report favours the

prosecution and is a circumstance that asks for conviction, but he
-9-

ignored that to credit the prosecution with its benefits the
prosecution is under the bounden duty to show that these were lying
in safe custody in the intervening period; and that it was dispatched
after observing the legal formalities. The Investigating Officer did
not take pains to record the statements of Moharrir of the concerned
Police Station and also that of the official who took empties to the
laboratory, so much so no abstract from register No. 19, in that
respect was collected and placed on file. The incident occurred on
12.10.2013, and on the same day empties were collected from the
spot, but were received in the laboratory after 10-days of its
collection, and the delay caused left unexplained. The prosecution
miserably failed to make us believe, that the report with all the
inherent defects could be taken against the respondent, when so the
report has lost its efficacy to be considered as a valuable piece of
evidence to facilitate in awarding conviction, that too in offences

entailing capital punishment, thus we regret to honour the same.

In case titled “Bakht Munir Vs the State” (2016 PLD

634), wherein it is held that:

“Besides, the crime pistol had been
allegedly recovered on the same day of
incident i.e. 14.01.2012, but has been
sent to the FSL with the crime empties
on 21.01.2012 i.e. after a delay of seven
days, for which no explanation, much
less plausible has been furnished by the
prosecution as to where and in whose
custody the pistol and empties remained
for this period and whether these were in
safe hands. Muhammad Akbar Khan S.I
(PW.7/Anvestigating Officer deposed that
he has not recorded statement of any
-10-

concerned person regarding delay in
sending the articles to the FSL. In the
circumstances, two interpretations of this
piece of evidence are possible, one that
the alleged empties and pistol have not
been tampered, and the other, that these
were not in safe hand and have been
tampered. It is settled law that when two
interpretations of evidence are possible,
the one favouring the accused shall be
taken into consideration. In this view of
the matter, the positive FSL report qua
the crime empties and pistol being
delayed without any __ plausible
explanation, would not advance the
prosecution case, therefore, has wrongly
been relied upon by the learned trial
Court.”

13. The report contains motive as blood feud, but the
prosecution could not establish the same, while reading the record
we found that two F.LRs were placed on file, but to none of them the
deceased was shown involved, rather it was admitted both, by the
complainant and the Investigating Officer that the deceased had no
involvement in the previous episodes. The complainant admitted in
his Court statement that the deceased had no ill will with the
accused, rather it was the complainant who was at the daggers
drawn. We have no other option but to hold that it was the
complainant who wanted to grind his axe by charging the
respondent. The Investigating Officer could not collect anything on
record in support of the motive and there is no cavil with the
proposition that motive is double edged weapon, which cuts either
way. True, that absence and weakness of motive will not have a

casting vote against the prosecution, but equally true that once the
-ll-

motive was alleged and was not proved then it was none else but the

prosecution to suffer.

In case titled "Muhammad Ashraf alias Acchu Vs
The State" (2019 SCMR 652 Para-7), wherein it has been held: -

"7, The motive is always a double-edged
weapon. The complainant Sultan Ahmad
(PW9) has admitted murder enmity between
the parties and has also given details of the
same in his statement recorded before the
trial court. No doubt, previous enmity can
be a reason for the appellant to commit the
alleged crime, but it can equally be a reason
for the complainant side to falsely implicate
the appellant in this case for previous

grouse."

14. It was argued for the appellant that the respondents
soon after the occurrence went into hiding and proceedings under the
relevant sections of law were carried out, but neither the respondent
turned up nor could be arrested, so was declared as proclaimed
offender. It was stressed that his long abscondence added to his guilt
and that the findings of the learned trial Court in that respect are
devoid of reasons. True that abscondence of accused is a relevant
factor, but alone it cannot be considered a conclusive proof of a
crime as the prosecution has to independently prove the charge on
the basis of strong and cogent evidence to lead us there where to

hold that the accused has committed the crime.
we

-12-

In case titled, “Muhammad Sadiq Vs the State”

(2017 SCMR 144), wherein it is held that:

“The fact that the appellant absconded
and was not traceable for considerably
long period of time could also not be
made sole basis for his conviction when
the other evidence of the prosecution is
doubtful as it is riddled with

contradictions.”

15. Besides the above, generally the order of acquittal
cannot be interfered with because the presumption of innocence of
accused is further strengthened by acquittal. The golden thread
which runs through the web of administration of justice in criminal
cases is, that, if two views are possible on the evidence adduced in
the case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other his
innocence, the view which is favourable to the accused should be
adopted. The paramount consideration of the Court is to ensure that
miscarriage of justice is prevented. A miscarriage of justice which
may arise from acquittal of the guilty is no less than from the
conviction of an innocent. In case where admissible evidence is
ignored, a duty is casted upon the appellant Court to re-appreciate
the evidence in a case where the accused has been acquitted, or the
purpose of ascertaining as to whether the accused committed the
offence or not. The principle to be followed by this Court
considering the appeal against the judgment of acquittal is, to

interfere only when there are compelling and substantial reasons for

-13-

doing so. If the impugned judgment is clearly unreasonable, it is a
compelling reason for interference. In case in hand, the prosecution
miserably failed to establish the charges against the respondent
through cogent, coherent and confidence inspiring evidence, so this
Court has reached to an inescapable conclusion that the impugned
judgment is well reasoned and based on proper appreciation of
evidence available on file, resultantly, this criminal appeal is bereft

of merit stands dismissed.
