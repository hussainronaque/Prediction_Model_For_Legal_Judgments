ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:-Petitioner Syed Maqbool
Shah, whose plea for post arrest bail on merit has been
turned down by this court vide order dated 19.07.2019,
passed in Cr.Misc.BA No.1514-P/2019, through this
application, seeks his release on bail in case FIR No.763
dated 27.08.2012, registered under sections
302/324/148/149 PPC at Police Station Badhber,
Peshawar, on the ground of non-conclusion of his trial
within a period of three months as stipulated by this court
vide order dated 17.07.2020, operative part of which is
reproduced below for the sake of convenience and ready
reference:-

“Afier hearing arguments at some _ length,
learned counsel for the petitioner states that he

would not press this bail petition at the moment,
if direction is given to the learned Trial Court to
conclude the trial within three months. The
learned Standing counsel on behalf of the State
and learned counsel for complainant have no
objection in conclusion of trial within such
stipulated period. This is therefore, directed that
the learned trial Court shall conclude the trial
within three months, positively. If the trial is not
concluded within the given time, the
accused/petitioner may apply afresh for his
release on bail. Furthermore, if the delay in
conclusion of trial is caused on the part of the
accused/petitioner, then such extra time shall be
given to the learned trial Court for the
conclusion of trial.

With the above observations, this bail

petition is disposed of accordingly.”

2. Despite service, no body turned up on behalf of the
complainant. Being bail application cannot be kept
pending for an indefinite period for the sole reason to
procure attendance of the complainant, who otherwise, has
been duly served. In this view of the matter, after hearing
learned counsel for the petitioner and learned State counsel
this application is being decided on the available record.

3. It appears from record that occurrence of this case
has been reported vide FIR No.763 dated 27.08.2012,
whereas after a considerable abscondence the petitioner
was arrested on 09.03.2019, followed by submission of
supplementary challan and framing of charge against him
on 17.10.2019. During trial of the petitioner, co-accused

Musa Khan was arrested and fresh charge was framed on
17.10.2020, consequently, on his denial to the charge, the
prosecution evidence was invited by the learned trial court
for 31.10.2020. Since, 31.10.2020 till date not a single PW
has been examined by the prosecution. As stated above,
the petitioner has been arrested on 09.03.2019 and he
along with co-accused is charged for murder of Noor-ul-
Islam deceased under section 302 PPC, which entails
capital punishment i.e. death or imprisonment for life.
Proviso third to section 497 Cr.P.C. provides that:-

“Provided further that the court shall, except
where it is of the opinion that the delay in the trial
of the accused has been occasioned by an act or
omission of the accused or any other person
acting on his behalf, direct that any person shall
be released on bail:-

(a) Who, being accused of any offence not punishable
with death, has been detained for such offence for
a continuous period exceeding one year or in case
of a woman exceeding six months and whose trial
for such offence has not concluded; or

(b) Who, being accused of an_ offence punishable
with death has been detained for such offence
for_a continuous period exceeding two years and
in case of a woman exceeding one year and whose
trial for such offence has not been concluded.”
(emphasis supplied).

4. In view of clause (b) of third Proviso to section
497 Cr.P.C., the statutory period for the offence with
which the petitioner is charged is two years, which is to be
completed on 09.03.2021, therefore, the instant application
is premature. Contention of learned counsel for the

petitioner that non-conclusion of trial within a period of
three months as stipulated by this Court, would be a
sufficient ground to entitle the petitioner for bail, is
misconceived, because such directions are alien to section
497 Cr.P.C., which is the mother provision governing the
grant or refusal of bail to accused charged under various
offences. In this view of the matter, this petition being
premature is hereby dismissed.

5. Before parting with the judgment, I deem it
appropriate to mention here that this court has taken
serious notice in so many cases about the irresponsible
attitude of the prosecution witnesses, who are deliberately
not appearing before the learned trial Courts and lack of
interest of the Public Prosecutors who are entrusted with
the task of pursuing/prosecuting cases on behalf of the
State/Prosecution. Before pointing towards the duties and
responsibilities of the Public Prosecutors, I would like to
refer to section 173 Cr.P.C., which provides that every
investigation shall be completed without unnecessary delay
and as soon as it is completed, the Officer Incharge of the
Police Station shall through the Public Prosecutor
forward to a Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of
the offence on a police report, a report, in the form
prescribed by the Provincial Government, setting forth the
names of the parties, the nature of the information and the
names of the persons who appear to be acquainted with the

circumstances of the case and stating whether the accused
(if arrested) has been forwarded in custody or has been
released on his bond, and if so, whether with or without
sureties. Under 1* proviso to section 173 Cr.P.C., where
investigation is not completed within a period of fourteen
days from the date of recording of the first information
report under section 154 Cr.P.C., the officer incharge of
the Police Station shall within three days of the expiration
of such period, forward to the Magistrate through the
Public Prosecutor, an interim report in the form
prescribed by the Provincial Government, stating therein
the result of the investigation made until then and the court
shall commence the trial on the basis of such interim
report, unless, for reasons to be recorded, the court decides
that the trial should not so commence. Similarly, section
175(5) Cr.P.C., provides that where the Officer incharge of
a Police Station forwards a report under sub-section (1) he
shall along with the report produce the witnesses in the
case, except the public servants, and the Magistrate shall
bind such witnesses for appearance before him or some
other Court on the date fixed for trial.

6. In the instant case, despite directions of this Court
and hectic efforts of the learned trial Court in the shape of
issuance of summons, notices and warrants, attendance of
the PWs could not be procured almost within a span of 18
months, what to speak of compliance of the provisions of

section 173 Cr.P.C. in true spirit. The non serious conduct
of public prosecutor in the matter of producing and
examining prosecution witnesses is a major factor in swift
conclusion of criminal trial. The Prosecutor plays a pivotal
role in the administration of criminal justice. Normally, the
role of the public prosecutor commences on the completion
of investigation by investigation agency and presenting the
case to district public prosecutor and putting the challan in
the Court. Foremost objective of the Public Prosecutor is to
ensure a fair trial of the accused by assisting trial courts in
the disposal of cases with an aims to deliver a prompt,
efficient and speedy service to the litigants for achieving
the ends of justice, ensuring judiciousness and speedy legal
remedies. Apart from conducting cases before the trial
court the Public Prosecutors are also vested with the
powers to evaluate the evidence in each case and make
their recommendations for filing revision petitions or
appeals against impugned orders and judgments in the
High Court. The Public Prosecutor has the power to
withdraw prosecution if reasonable ground exists under
section 494 of the Cr.P.C. Consent will be given by the
Public Prosecutor only if public justice in the larger sense
is promoted rather than subverted by such withdrawal. It is
undeniable fact that due to many reasons including the
incompetence of the Investigating Officers the deadline of
14 days for the submission of the Challan (final report) u/s

173 Cr.P.C. is missed as a matter of routine, which
definitely is the main source of causing undue delay in
processing of the case, but thereafter the idol sitting of
Public Prosecutor(s) attached with trial Court(s) gave
another support to delay the conclusion of trial. Though, a
proper Prosecution Department has been established by the
Government under the Home department, headed by the
Director General with Regional Director as his fleet
member for supervision purpose but there is no endeavor
or check from that end to make prosecution reliable and
credible. I have noted with great concern that in almost all
the criminal cases, the prosecution witnesses, despite
repeated non-bailable warrants, avoids appearance in the
courts for recording their testimony. The Public
Prosecutors never like to adhere to their duties in swift
disposal of criminal cases which not only amount to waste
the precious time of the courts, but also multiply the cost
of litigations on public exchequer. It is the fundamental
duty of the Prosecution to ensure that justice is delivered
and in pursuance of this, they should lay before the court
all relevant evidence and assure production of all the
prosecution witnesses in support of the above said
evidence.

7. During arguments the Director General, Regional
Prosecutor and Public Prosecutor, present in court were
confronted as whether a single instance is available to

show that any legal or disciplinary action has been
proposed by any Public Prosecutor to the high ups against
any official witness in any criminal case who was
deliberately not appearing before the Court or by the
Director General Prosecution Khyber Pakhtunkhwa against
the delinquent Public Prosecutors, their reply was in the
negative. Dispensation of justice and enforcement of rights
are the two chief objectives, a civilized community is
supposed to accomplish. Timely disposal of dispute and
redressal of grievance are two sure signs of effective
administration of justice. The criminal justice system
requires that a person accused of a crime is brought to
justice as speedily as possible, so if he is found guilty, he is
punished and if he is found to be innocent, he is discharged
or acquitted. The maxim that justice delayed is justice
denied comes true when a criminal trial remains pending
indefinitely for no reason whatsoever.

8. Coming to the powers, functions and
responsibilities of the Public Prosecutors, I would refer to
section 492 Cr.P.C., under which the Provincial
Government appoint the Public Prosecutors who are law
Officers to conduct criminal proceedings on behalf of the
State. A Prosecutor is a legal representative of the
prosecution, responsible for presenting the case in a
criminal trial against accused. The main role of the Public
Prosecutor is to serve the ends of justice in the best interest

of the public. A Public Prosecutor is an officer of the court
and his primary duty is to assist the court in arriving at the
truth by putting forth all the relevant material on behalf of
the prosecution. While discharging his duties, the Public
Prosecutor must act in a manner that is fair to the court, to
the investigating agencies as well as to the accused.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Prosecution Service (Constitution,
Functions and Powers) Act, 2005, (“the Act of 2005”),
was promulgated on 29" January, 2005, to reorganize and
establish a “Prosecution Institution” for achieving speedy
justice and matters ancillary or incidental thereto,
Chapter-II whereof pertains to establishment of
Prosecution Institution and Chapter-III enunciates a
workable mechanism to improve investigation system as a
whole as well as investigation of individual cases at district
level. Section 4 of the Act of 2005, enumerates the powers
and functions of the Public Prosecutors, according to
which a District Public Prosecutor or Public Prosecutor, as
the case may be, shall be in-charge of the Prosecution in
the District concerned and in discharge of his lawful duties
with respect to a case the prosecution whereof is lawfully
assigned to him, shall perform the functions enumerated in
the Act in relation to conducting prosecution of offences
before courts of competent jurisdiction, i.e. to safeguard
the interest of the public in prosecution of cases before the
courts of competent jurisdiction, to submit challan before

competent court of trial or to withhold the same for want
10

of proper evidence and return it to the Investigation Officer
with written direction to resubmit the report after removal
of the deficiencies so identified by him; in respect of
compoundable offences, other than those which are
punishable with death or life imprisonment, the Director
General Prosecution, and in respect of compoundable
offences punishable with imprisonment for seven years or
less, the District Public Prosecutor, is vested with powers
to withhold prosecution if reasonable grounds exist to
believe that the offence is compoundable; provided that if
the offence is not compounded within a period of one
month, a report shall be lodged in the court of competent
jurisdiction for prosecution and trial; or apply, for reasons
to be recorded in writing, to the court of competent
jurisdiction for the discharge of the case, if its institution
has been found to be malafide, wrongful or weak from
evidentiary point of view. In respect of any case instituted
by a Public Prosecutor before a competent court, any
private person representing the complainant shall act under
the directions of the Public Prosecutor

9. Similarly, sections 5 and 6 of the Act of 2005,
speak about the conduct of prosecution in criminal
offences and liaison of the Director General Prosecution
with the Advocate General. The investigation Officer shall
send the case together with the evidence to the concerned

Public Prosecutor, whereas the prosecution shall not take
11

effect against persons other than those charged as accused,
on the basis of available evidence, by the Public
Prosecutor. The Public Prosecutor shall have the right of
audience before any court in respect of any case assigned
to him and a Public Prosecutor may within his jurisdiction,
issue general guidelines to police officers regarding state
of their investigation and other matters necessary for the
fulfillment of the purpose of effective prosecution.
Likewise, a District Public Prosecutor may ask the Head of
Investigation in a District to take disciplinary action
against investigation Officer, where sufficient reasons exist
to believe that Investigation Officer has colluded or has not
exercised due diligence or honesty in conducting
investigation or misrepresented the facts of the case or
prepared the report inefficiently; and the Director General
Prosecution or the District Public Prosecutor may when he
deems necessary in cases where police officers fail to
follow any suggestions or instructions of Public
Prosecutor under this Act, call for disciplinary action
against the Investigation Officer through the competent
authority. According to section 6 of the Act (ibid), the
Director General Prosecution shall keep liaison with the
Advocate General to ascertain the progress of criminal
appeals and revisions and other legal proceedings pending
before the Supreme Court, Federal Shariat Court and High

Court or any other court established under the law. The
12

Director General Prosecution shall provide Prosecutors to
all the criminal courts in the Province. Section 7 of the Act
of 2005, further enumerates the additional powers of
District Public Prosecutor/Public Prosecutor that a Public
Prosecutor, in discharge of his lawful duties and in respect
of a case lawfully assigned to him, may also exercise the
following powers, in addition to the powers conferred by
section 4 of this Act, namely:-

(a) Upon expiry of time period mentioned in

the Code for submission of final report or after

submission of final report, if necessary for

proper and thorough investigation of an offence,

a Public Prosecutor may request the court to

issue warrants for search, seizure or inspection

of evidence for compliance by the Investigation

Officer;

(b) A Public Prosecutor may call for record

or any other document from any law

Enforcement Agency upon expiry of time

period mentioned in the Code for submission

of final report;

(c) A District Public Prosecutor in case of
offences carrying seven years or less
imprisonment and the Director General

Prosecution for all other offences may
13

withdraw prosecution subject to prior

approval of Court:

Provided that prosecution of an
offence falling under the Anti-Terrorism Act,
1997 (XXVII of 1997), shall not be
withdrawn without prior permission in writing
of the Secretary to Government, Home and

Tribal Affairs Department; and

(d) The Public Prosecutor on completion of
investigation shall scrutinize the case file and
refer the shortcomings or faults in
investigation to the Head of Investigation for
removing or improving the same, which shall
be complied with by the Head of Investigation
within seven days, and on fulfillment thereof,
it shall be sent to the Public Prosecutor

putting it in the court”.

10. Apart from above, under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Prosecution Service Constitution Function and Powers
Rules, 2012, the Public Prosecutor shall prosecute, watch
or direct the prosecution of the cases in the courts of the
District. In this connection it shall be realized that his duty
embraces not only to prosecute the prosecution case but
ensuring the observance of conditions and instruction

imposed by the law. The Prosecutor must be impartial, fair
14

and truthful, not only as a public executive but also
because the prosecutor belongs to the honorable profession
of law, the ethics of which demand these qualities. The
Public Prosecution is to supervise and distribute the work
of Prosecuting Officers subordinate to him and the police
personnel attached to his office or to the courts; and see
that the results of cases in courts are promptly
communicated to the police concerned according to the
Act and especially to bring it into the notice of the
superintendent investigation, together with an abstract or
copy of the judgment if necessary, orders of acquittal or
discharge or other orders of courts, which either reflect in
any way on the conduct of the police or indicate that the
theory on which the case was prosecuted has broken down.
11. The Additional Registrar (Judicial) of this Court
shall sent copy of this order to the Director General
Prosecution, who shall onward circulate the same amongst
the Public Prosecutors under his supervisions in the
Province for guidance, reminding their official powers,

functions and responsibilities as well as strict compliance.
