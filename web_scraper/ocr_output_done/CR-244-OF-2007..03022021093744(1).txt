SHAKEEL AHMAD, J:- This revision petition is

directed against the judgment and decree dated
13.03.2007, passed by the learned Additional District
Judge-ll, Haripur, whereby, Civil Appeal No.97/13 of
2006 filed by the petitioners against the judgment and
decree dated 27.02.2003 passed by Civil Judge-V,
Haripur, in suit No.168/1 of 1995, was dismissed.

2. The facts of the case, in brief, are that
petitioner/plaintiff instituted a suit against the
respondents/defendants for declaration to the effect that
petitioner/plaintiff was owner in possession of property
bearing ‘khasra’ No.300/115, 121, 119, ‘Khata’

No.55/78/79 measuring 8 ‘Kanals’ 18 ‘Marlas’, ‘Khasra’
No.114 measuring 5 ‘Kanals’ 8 ‘Marlas’ ‘Khata’
No.54/77, ‘Khasra’ No.120 measuring 7 ‘Marlas’ ‘Khata’
No.69/94 to the extent of 1/2 share, ‘Khasra’ No.275
measuring 6 ‘Kanals’ 19 ‘Marlas’ ‘Khata’ No.65/90 to the
extent of 1/8 share, and ‘Khasra’ No.111 measuring 1
Kanal 11 Marlas’ ‘Khata’ No.64/89 to the extent of 1/4
share alongwith share in ‘Shamilat’ situated in ‘Mauza’
Qazi Maira Tehsil and District Haripur, on the basis of
registered deed No.3170 attested on 27.09.1995 and
gift mutation No.378 attested on 17.09.1995 in respect
of the same land by defendant No.5 in favour of
defendants No.1 to 4 was fraudulent, forged, fictitious,
without consideration, and based on fraud was
ineffective upon the rights of the plaintiff and liable to be
cancelled, and entries in the name of defendants No.1
to 4 in the revenue record on the basis of said mutation
were also liable to be cancelled and the name of the
plaintiff was required to be entered therein on the basis of
registered deed No.3170 dated 27.09.1995. The
plaintiff/petitioner sought permanent injunction praying to
restrain the respondents/defendants No.1 to 4 from making
interference, or making construction or improvements, or
alienating the disputed property on the basis of wrong
entries in the revenue record. The _ plaintiff, in

alternative, also sought possession of the suit property.
After service of summons, the respondents/defendants

put their appearance before the learned trial Court,

contested the suit by way of filing their written

statement. From divergent pleadings of the parties,

following issues were framed and parties were directed

to produce evidence.

Relief.
3. In order to prove his claim, petitioner/
plaintiff produced seven witnesses including plaintiff
himself, while the respondents/defendants examined
three witnesses including defendant No.1 in support of
their case. After a full dressed trial, the suit of the
petitioner/plaintiff was dismissed by the learned Civil
Judge-V, Haripur vide judgment and decree dated
27.02.2003. Not contented with the same, the petitioner
approached the learned appeal Court by filing Civil
Appeal No.97/13 of 2006, which was dismissed being
meritless while the judgment and decree passed by the
learned trial Court was maintained vide judgment and
decree dated 13.03.2007. Hence, this revision petition.

4. The learned counsel representing the
petitioner argued that findings of both the Courts below
are based on misreading and non-reading of evidence
and that their conclusion are not supported by the
evidence on record. He next argued that the impugned
mutation through which the suit property was
transferred in the name of the respondents No.1 to 4 is
forged and fictitious. He further argued that requirement
of gift of immovable property under the Muhammadan
Law are declaration by donor, acceptance by the done
and delivery of possession by the donor to the donee,

which is lacking in the instant case, therefore, the gift
mutation is liable to be set aside. He added that the
respondents No.1 to 4 are not related to the respondent
No.5, and went on to say that a gift without
consideration is void. He lastly argued that neither the
marginal witnesses of the mutation in question were
produced nor it was attested in the concerned village,
therefore, the same is not sustainable in the eye of law.

5. As against that learned counsel
representing the respondents No.1 to 4 contended that
the mutation in question attested in favour of the
respondents No.1 to 4, is prior in time. He next argued
that Muhammadan Law does not prohibit an adult sane
Muslim from alienating the property by way of gift even
to a stranger. He further contended that petitioner being
a stranger cannot challenge the validity of gift mutation.
He added that donor has unlimited power to gift away
his property even without consideration. The learned
counsel for the respondents by summing up his
arguments contended that the entries got recorded in
revenue record effected by the donor (now deceased) is
sufficient proof of delivery of possession. He lastly
contended that attestation of mutation in the village is
not a mandatory requirement under the Land Revenue
Act and concluded his arguments by contending that a

Muslim may alienate the whole of his property by gift
even in favour of a stranger, to entire exclusion of his
heirs and only restraint is the rule which invalidates a
gift, is death bed gift and prayed for dismissal of the
revision petition.

6. | have carefully considered the submissions
of the learned counsel for the parties and perused the
record with their valuable assistance.

7. It transpired from the record that the suit
land measuring 13% Kanal at Mauza Qazi Maira, Tehsil
& District Haripur originally belonged to Faqeer
Muhammad/respondent No.5. It was pleaded by the
petitioner that through the registered deed No.3170
attested on 29.09.1995 Ex.PW 2/1, the respondent No.5
has sold out his said landed property to him. He thus
claimed right, title, interest etc in respect of the suit land.
He was aggrieved of the gift mutation No.378 attested
on 17.09.1995 in favour of the respondents No.1 to 4 by
the respondent No.5 through which the suit land was
mutated in the names of the respondents No.1 to 4.
The respondent No.5 denied the claim of the petitioner
and supported the stance of the respondents No.1 to 4
by way of filing his written statement through his
counsel. The learned trial Court on the basis of findings
recorded on issues No.7, 8 and 9 found that plea of gift,

taken up by the respondents No.1 to 4 was established
and held that the petitioner failed to establish
genuineness of registered sale deed in his favour and
proceeded to decide issues No.7, 9 and 10 against the
petitioner and issue No.8 in favour of the respondents
No.1 to 4. Having arrived at this finding, the suit was
dismissed. There was an appeal bearing No.97/13 of
2006 before the learned Additional District Judge,
Haripur. Having considered the submissions of the
learned counsel for the parties, the learned appeal
Court agreed with the findings recorded by the learned
trial Court and dismissed the appeal on 13.07.2007.

8. | found that the petitioner claimed his
ownership over the suit property on the basis of
registered sale deed Ex.PW 2/1. On the other hand, the
respondents No.1 to 4 assert that the suit property was
gifted to them through suit mutation executed by the
respondent No.5. These two documents, are supposed
to be proved by both the parties through cogent, reliable
and confidence inspiring evidence as required under the
law. No doubt presumption of truth is attached to the
registered sale deed, so the respondents were under
obligation not only to shatter genuineness of the said
deed but also to prove genuineness of gift mutation

attested in their favour.
9. The record disclosed that the respondent
No.5 contested the suit by way of filing his written
statement through his counsel, wherein he denied
execution of registered sale deed and contended that it
was a forged and fictitious document and admitted the
genuineness of gift mutation attested in favour of the
respondents No.1 to 4 by him. He stated in his written
statement that he throughout lived with the respondents
No.1 to 4 and was looked after by them. He
categorically admitted claim of the respondents No.1 to
4 and denied claim of the petitioner. It is pertinent to
mention here that the petitioner also placed reliance on
the affidavit Ex.PW 4/2 allegedly executed by the
respondent No.5 in his favour, admitting therein
execution of registered sale deed, however, this
document could not be proved as he failed to produce
the executant of Ex.PW 4/2 even he was not cited as a
witness in his list of witnesses, though it was borne from
the record that at the time of recording evidence he was
alive. Another interesting aspect of the case is that the
petitioner while appearing as PW-5 deposed that he
entered into oral sale agreement at Hazara Colony at
Rawalpindi in presence of one Aurangzeb and his
brother namely Mumtaz but neither the said Aurangzeb

nor Mumtaz were produced as witnesses in support of
his contention. The stamp paper was purchased on
05.09.1995 while the deed was scribed on 27.09.1995,
It was admitted by him that before the execution of
registered deed, no sale consideration was paid. He
also stated that at the time of purchase of stamp paper,
neither he nor his witnesses were present and the
respondent No.5 had come from Rawalpindi. He further
admitted that all the three dates i.e. purchase of stamp
paper, scribing of sale deed and execution/attestation of
sale deed, were fixed due to on and off visit of the
respondent No.5 from Rawalpindi. The relevant portion

of his cross-examination is reproduced as under:-
mod SAO LOE a ae

It was also admitted by him that the registered deed
was written at 9.00 am. and at that time his both
witnesses Chanzeb (PW-6) and Muhammad Ayub (PW-
7) were present. Whereas Muhammad Ayub (PW-7)
deposed that the bargain was stuck before him and he
for the first time appeared before the registrar. It clearly
suggests that the entire transaction was completed on
27.09.1995, however, the record reveals that the stamp
paper was purchased on 05.09.1995 as per statement
of stamp vendor PW-2 and it was scribed on

10.09.1995, its entry in the relevant register can easily
be maneuvered in the back date. It is not appealable to
a prudent mind that the respondent No.5 came from
Rawalpindi and purchased stamp paper on 05.09.1995
and the petitioner was not available to him to scribe and
execute the deed, particularly, for want of payment of
sale consideration. It is an admitted fact that the gift
mutation executed in favour of the respondents No.1 to
4 by the respondent No.5 is prior in time and the second
transaction, if any, made by the respondent No.5 as
alleged, was illegal and void as he was no more owner
of the suit property after alienating it in favour of the
respondents No.1 to 4. Thus, it was rightly held by the
Courts below that the petitioner failed to prove
genuineness of registered sale deed.

10. Before adverting to the genuineness of the
gift mutation attested in favour of the respondents No.1
to 4 by the respondent No.5 and submissions of the
learned counsel for the petitioner, it would be
appropriate to resort to the definition of gift provided by
Section 138 of Muhammadan Law written by D.F.
Mullah, which reads as under:

“A hiba or gift is a transfer of property
made immediately, and without any
exchange, by one person to another
accepted by or on behalf of the later.”
Pre-requisites of a valid gift under Muhammadan Law
as pointed out by Mullah are declaration, offer by owner,
acceptance of gift by donee and delivery of possession.
It is reflected from the record that the suit mutation was
sanctioned in the presence of tehsildar in a public
meeting and on inquiry by the tehsildar, respondent
No.5 accepted that he was making gift with his own free
will. Moreover, when he submitted his written statement,
he admitted that possession of the suit land was
delivered to the respondents No.1 to 4. Hence, the
basic three ingredients of a valid gift, were fulfilled. In
this behalf reference may be made to the case reported
as ‘Mst. Jabeda Khatoon V. Moheed Ali? (AIR 1973
Gauhati 105), wherein it was held that when the donee
has been possessing the land and got his name
mutated in the revenue record in respect of the land, it
is implied that there is acceptance on behalf of the
donee and coupled with possession of the property
which was delivered to the donee by the donor. In this
context reference may also be made to the case
reported as ‘Mst. Nagina Begum V Mst. Tahzim
Akhtar and others’ (2009 SCMR 632). It is also an
admitted fact that during life time the above named
donor never objected to the mutation in question rather

he admitted its execution as stated above. No doubt, a
12

gift mutation executed by a sick person dependant at
the mercy of his attendants under compelling
circumstances, is illegal and is not binding, but it is
equally true that in the present case nothing exists on
the file to indicate that respondent No.5 was sick and
infirm at the time of execution of the gift mutation and
the same had been obtained by the respondents No.1
to 4 through fraud, coercion or undue pressure or undue
influence was exercised on him to constitute the said
gift. Mere assertion of the petitioner that a fraud has
been practiced upon the respondent No.5 to get the gift
mutation attested without a positive attempt on his part
to substantiate the same, is of no consequence.
Needless to mention that it is very easy to assert fraud
but it is difficult to prove the same. In this respect, | am
fortified in my view from the dictum laid down in the
case reported as ‘Ghulam Ghaus V. Muhammad
Yasin and another (2009 SCMR 70). A Muslim donor
enjoys vast unfettered power to alienate his property by
way of gift during his lifetime, subject to one condition
(as discussed above) that he should be in proper state
of health and gift is made of his own without any
coercion or inducement.

11. Last but not least, merely non-existent of

blood relation, as argued by the learned counsel for the
13

petitioner, would not be sufficient to declare a gift
invalid. In this context reliance can be placed on the
judgment reported as ‘Tahir Pervez V. Muhammad
Sadiq and others’ (2005 CLC 346).

12. The points urged before me by the learned
counsel for the petitioner in my opinion, are not
substantial reasons or material enough to earn
interference in the concurrent findings of fact rendered
by the learned lower fora on the basis of due and proper
evaluation and appreciation of evidence. The learned
Courts below thoroughly discussed, dealt with and
analyzed the evidence of the parties and then formed
their well-reasoned opinion on the litigated questions of
fact against the petitioner. The well-reasoned
conclusions of the learned subordinate Courts cannot
be superceded by this Court even if another view was
deducible from evidence on a third opinion of fact was
inferable from the record. The oral as well as
documentary evidence was logically and consistently
deciphered and reasoned out for the impugned
opinions. There exists no ground for interference in the
conclusion drawn from cumulative and comprehensive
consideration of the case evidence by the learned

Courts below.
14

13. No illegality, irregularity or jurisdictional
defect in the concurrent findings of the learned Courts
below, which resulted into impugned judgments and
decrees could either be pointed out or observed. This
being the position, there is no merit in this revision
petition and the same is dismissed. However, | leave
the parties to bear their own costs.
