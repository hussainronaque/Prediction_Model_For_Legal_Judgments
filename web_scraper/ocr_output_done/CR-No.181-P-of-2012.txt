MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- This single judgment shall

also decide Civil Revision No.224-P/2012 titled “Anwar_Khan
versus Sherzada and 07 others” as both the petitions against the
same judgment and decree of learned additional District Judge-lV,
Mardan dated 30/01/2012, by which the respondents’ appeal was
allowed and suit filed by them was decreed.

02. | Compendious details of the matter in hand are that Mst.
Hussan Bibi , predecessor in interest of respondents brought the
lis before civil Court challenging the entries of revenue papers of
property bearing Khasra No. 1178/2, 1181, 1166/2, 1167, 1166/1,
1172, 1173, 1174, 1184, 1169, 1170, 1168, 1171 of the estate of
Khazana Dheri of Tehsil & District Mardan, which was
incorporated on the strength of mutation No. 207 in favour of
petitioner No. 01, mutation No. 209, in favour of petitioner No.02
of this petition and mutation No. 222 in favour of petitioner of CR
NO. 224, all were attested on 24/2/1998, being the wrong, against

the law, without consideration, fraudulent, collusive, unjust and
2

without her consent, thus inoperative upon her rights, with added
prayer for restraining them from further alienation. Suit was
resisted by petitioners through their separate written statements
on different legal as well as factual objections. Learned trail court
after framing of issues, recording of evidence and hearing the
parties dismissed her suit. Being aggrieved, she preferred an
appeal which was allowed and her suit was decreed by the
learned appellate court on 30.01.2012, hence these petitions.

03. Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that on
24/02/1998 not only the disputed mutations i.e. 207,209 and 222
but also mutation No. 208, 203 & 223 were attested, which were
not challenged and this fact was admitted by the respondents, so
not only the plaintiff was estopped to sue but her suit was also
barred by time, being instituted on 24/04/2007, much latter than
the period prescribed for seeking declaration. He vociferated that
despite being alive, she opted not to appear in person which cast
doubt that had she appeared would have admitted the sale in
petitioners’ favour. The other sisters of respondent appeared and
have admitted not only alienation of property in petitioners’ favour
but also the receipt of sale consideration. He went on to say that
witnesses produced by petitioners have categorically deposed that
plaintiff had acknowledged the receipt of sale consideration and
transfer of property in favour of vendees in their presence. While
referring to the statement of petitioners, he argued that the

petitioners have requested to the learned court for sending the
3

disputed mutations to FSL for forensic examination of vendor's
thumb impression with admitted thumb impression but neither the
prayer was acceded nor rejected, thus, the administration of
justice requires that on acceptance of these revisions, the matter
may be remanded for expert opinion through FSL of disputed
mutations. To substantiate his conventions, he relied on the case
law reported as PLD 2007 SC 433, 2006 YLR 1513, 1995 CLC
695, PLD 1979 SC 890, PLD 1992 SC 811, 1979 SCMR 625,
2012 MLD 1545 and 2008 SCMR 1425.

04. —Contrarily, learned counsel for respondents contended that
only the disputed mutations were purportedly attested on the
instance of plaintiff in favour of petitioners and the other mutations
referred to by the learned counsel for petitioners, the plaintiff was
not the vendor so she was neither aggrieved of those mutations
nor was supposed to challenge them. He went on to say that only
in one mutation No.209, Mst. Hussan Pari, the sister of plaintiff is
the vendor whereas other alleged mutations only Mst. Hussan Bibi
is the vendor. However, when Mst. Hussan Bibi is a Parda
Nasheen illiterate and rustic villager and when her son and
husband were alive but none of them was made witness and the
one who happened to be the witness did not know the plaintiff who
deposed that in his presence neither the mutation was thumb
impressed nor the sale consideration changed hands, then how
come the veracity of witness be authenticated. He added that

entire commission proceedings were manipulated, fabricated just
4

to deprive the plaintiff from her valuable property and that too for
no sale consideration. Insofar as the expert opinion for thumb
impression or FSL, he added that not only the petitioners’
application was dismissed but appeal and revision were also
dismissed, and those orders being not assailed have attained
finality. He supported the impugned judgment and decree by
submitting that the same was the result of correct appreciation of
evidence.

05. Arguments heard and record perused.

06. —‘It appears from record that all three sale mutations were
challenged by an illiterate and Parda Nasheen Lady by contending
that those were without consideration, without her consent and
that she never appeared before any revenue officer / official; that
in accordance with the law of the land, the beneficiaries were
required to prove firstly, the independently the factum of sale,
secondly, the payment of sale consideration, thirdly, the presence
of vendor before local commission and putting of her thumb
impression and fourthly, her due identification so that the vendor
may not be misidentified, thus her near and dear i.e. husband and
son were alive, were not the identifier of vendor, and the one who
identified her did not know her rather has never met her ever.
Payment of sale consideration was not proved, none of witness
deposed that in his presence sale consideration was paid. Column

No.13 of mutations reveal that these were attested for Rs.
50,000/-, 70,000/- + 7000/-, thus the petitioners had to prove the
payment of sale consideration.
The Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled “Sardar Ali

versus Wazir Khan” (2005 SCMR 1583) has held: -

“It is true that P.W.3 is scribe of the document but he had
failed _to furnish trustworthy evidence to establish that the
‘transaction in respect of sale of land took place between the
parties in pursuance whereof the petitioner_paid Rs.
1,00,000 out_of total sale consideration of Rs.1,25,000.
Since the document (Exh.P.1) has not been proved on
record according to law, therefore, no exception can be
taken to the impugned judgment which is based on correct
appreciation of evidence available on record”.

Similarly, the Apex Court in case titled “Ghulam Mustafa versus

Muhammad Yahya” (2013 SCMR 684) has held that: -

“this is an admitted fact that only one marginal witness
to the agreement to sell was produced and he also did
not support the claim of the appellant regarding payment
of sale consideration in his presence as was mentioned
in the agreement therefore, the assertion of the
respondent that her signature on the agreement were
obtained deceitfully would be sufficiently supported by
the evidence on the record. The genuineness of the
agreement and the transaction of sale was not proved
as per requirement of Article 17 read with Article 15 of
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, .1984 and this is settled law
that relief of specific performance cannot be granted
unless the execution of sale agreement as per
requirement of law and payment of sale consideration in
part or full is proved”.

07. Before discussing the legal aspect of sale mutations, a
look of basic definition of sale as provided in Section 54 of the
Transfer of Property Act 1882, which is reproduced as under.

"54. Sale defined. 'Sale' is a transfer of ownership in
exchange for a price paid or promised or part paid
and part promised. Sale how made. Such transfer, in
the case of tangible immovable property of the value
of one hundred rupees and upwards, or in the case of
a reversion or other intangible thing, can be made
only by a registered instrument. In the case of
tangible immovable property, of a value less than one
hundred rupees, such transfer may be made either
by a registered instrument or by delivery of the
property. Delivery of tangible immovable property
takes place when the seller places the buyer, or such
person as he directs in possession of the property.
Contract for sale-A contract for the sale of immovable
property is a contract that a sale of such property
shall take place on terms settled between the parties.
It does not, of itself, create any interest in or charge
on such property”

08. The above quoted section of law in explicit term defined
that it is a contract, so it was petitioners to prove that when, where
and under what circumstance the contract of sale was entered
between the parties. Apart from above, mutation No.222
(Ex.DW1/1) mutation No.207 (Ex.DW1/6) and mutation No.209
were entered through Roznamcha Wagiyati but copies of the
same were not placed on file. Sub-Section (1) and (2) to (8) of
Section 42 of the Land Revenue Act, 1967, are reproduced as
under: -

“42. Making of that part of periodical records which
relates to land-owners. - (1) [Subject to other
provisions of this Chapter, a person acquiring by
inheritance, purchase, mortgage, gift, or otherwise, any
right in an estate as a land-owner, or a tenant for a fixed
term exceeding one year, shall, within three months from
the date of such acquisition, report his acquisition of
right to the Patwari of the estate, who shall.

(a) record such report in the Roznamcha to be
maintained in the prescribed manner;

(b) furnish a copy of the report so recorded, free of
cost to the person making the report; and

(c) send a copy of the report, within a week of its
receipt by him, to the [respective Local Council]
within which the estate is situated.
If the person acquiring the right is a minor or is
otherwise unable to report, his guardian or other
person having charge of his property shall make
the report to the Patwari.

The Patwari shall enter in his register of
mutations every report made to him under sub-
section (1) or sub section (2) and shall also
make an entry in the Roznamcha and in the
register of mutations respecting the acquisition
of any such right as aforesaid which he has
reason to believe to have taken place and of
which report should have been made to him
under either of those sub-sections and has not
been so made.

The report made to the Patwari under sub-
section (1) or sub-section (2) or recorded by him
under sub-section (3) shall be displayed in such
manner as may be prescribed.

If the Patwari fails to record or to display a
report made to him under sub-section(I) or sub-
section (2), the person making the report may
make the report, in writing, to the Revenue
Officer concerned and ‘[the Nazim of the
Village Council or Nazim of the Neighborhood
Council as a case may belin which the estate is
situated by registered post acknowledgement
due and the Revenue Officer shall there-upon
cause such report to be entered in the register
of mutations.

A Revenue Officer shall, from time to time,
inquire into the correctness of all entries in the
register of mutations and into all such
acquisitions as aforesaid coming to his
knowledge of which, under the foregoing sub-
section report should have been made to the
Patwari and entries made in that register, and
shall in each case make such order as he thinks
fit with respect to any entry in the periodical
record of the right acquired.

Except in cases of inheritance or where the
acquisition of the right is by registered deed or
by or under an order or decree of a Court, the
Revenue Officer shall make the order under
sub-section (6) in the presence of the person
whose right has been acquired, after such
person has been identified by two respectable
persons, preferably from Lambardars or
members of the Union Committee, Town
Committee or Union Council concerned whose
signatures or thumb-impressions shall be
obtained by the Revenue Officer on the register
of mutations.

(8) An inquiry or an order under sub-section (6)
shall be made in the common assembly in the
estate to which the mutation, which is the
subject matter of the inquiry, relates”.
09. Statement of Patwari Halqa was recorded as PW-1, who
was cross examined at length, then statement of ADK was
recorded as PW-2 but from them no such record was placed on
file in order to determine that in whose instance Roznamcha was
entered. More importantly one of the marginal witness was
examined as CW-1, who demonstrated the true picture, by
deposing that vendor Mst. Hussan Bibi is his first cousin, neither in
his presence sale consideration was paid nor his statement was
recorded, similarly he deposed that in his presence no mutation
was thumb impressed by vendor. Petitioners have not cross
examined the same, as such by not cross examining, examination
in chief and cross examination on behalf of plaintiff, would be
considered as an admission of petitioners. Beneficiary of mutation
is required to prove it as held by the apex Court in case titled
“Aurangzeb through L.Rs and others vs. Muhammad Jaffar and

another’ (2007 SCMR 236) that: -

“It is a settled law qua the transaction of sale or gift,
that it is the duty of the beneficiary and a heavy onus
lay on the beneficiary to prove by convincing
evidence j satisfying the judicial conscience of the
Court that the transaction shown to be a gift was
executed by the donor in favour of the donee”
10. In case titled “Mst. Hafiza Bibi vs. Ali Hussain and others”
(1994 SCMR 1194), it was held that: -

“4. It has come in evidence that the appellant is a
married woman. She had come to the house of her
brothers, though step, at the time of ‘Chehlum' of
their father and stayed there for about two months
and was treated very nicely. At the time of alleged
alienation, her husband was not there. The alienate
stood in fiduciary relationship. In the absence of
independent advice, in view of the long established
law from Mst. Farid-un-Nisa v. Munshi Mukhtar
Ahmed and another, (1925 PC 204), and lastly
declared by this Court in Ghulam Ali and others v.
Mst. Ghulam Sarwar Naqvi (PLD 1990 SC 1) the
transaction cannot be substained. Therefore, the
appeal is allowed, and the judgment and the decree
of the learned trial Court restored. In the
circumstances the parties are left to bear their own
costs”.

11. Furthermore, before trial court, petitioners have submitted
application for summoning of DOR, Rehmat Ullah Wazir Revenue
Officer, Shamsher Patwari, Girdawar Circle but their application
was turned down by the learned trial court, against which their
appeal was failed. They have also filed an application for expert
opinion regarding the thumb impression of Mst. Hussan Bibi that
too was dismissed. That have also submitted an application for
amendment in written statement, which was dismissed against
which they came up to this court and their civil revision was also

dismissed vide judgment rendered in CR No. 364 of 2011 dated

25/03/2011. Second Civil Revision for producing of witnesses and
re-summoning of witnesses through CR No. 540 of 2011 was
dismissed by this Court on 07/10/2011. Therefore, there is no

force in the arguments of the learned counsel that on the request
10

of petitioners, the expert opinion was not sought by the lower
court. Even otherwise the evidence of expert opinion is only to
corroborate the stance of party and such evidence itself does not
entitled a party for relief, if not supported by primary evidence
which is lacking in this case.

12. Therefore, for all that has been discussed above, these
petitions are dismissed being without substance with cost.

ANNOUNCED.
