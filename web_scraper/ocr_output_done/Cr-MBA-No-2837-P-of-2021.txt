ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN_ KHAN, _J:-Through this common order, I
propose to decide the instant bail application, filed by Mst. Nadia and
connected Cr.Misc.BA No.2860-P/2021, filed by Mst. Najam, the
petitioners respectively, as both pertain to one and the same FIR
No.900 dated 18.07.2021, registered under section 9 (d ) KP Control
of Narcotic Substances Act, 2019, in Police Station Chamkani,
Peshawar. The petitioners are behind the bars in the cited case and
through their respective application they are seeking post arrest bail.

2. According to FIR, on 18.07.2021 at 1245 hours, Javed Khan
ASI along with other police officials intercepted a motorcar bearing
registration No.MJ.309-Islamabad on motorway. On query, its driver
disclosed his name as Muhammad Iftikhar, the person sitting in front
seat as Paravez and two ladies sitting in the rear seat as Mst. Nadia and
Mst. Najma (petitioners). On search 18 packet containing chars, each
weighing 1200 grams and five packet containing opium, each

weighing 1200 grams, were recovered from secret cavities made
beneath the rear seat. He separated 05 grams from each packet as
samples for chemical analysis by the FSL. The petitioner along with
male accused were arrested there and then, hence, this case.

3. Having heard the argument of learned counsel for the parties,
it appears from the record that no contraband narcotic has been shown
recovered from personal/direct possession of the petitioners. The
recovery of narcotics has been shown from secret cavities of the
motorcar. The only circumstance against the petitioners is that they
were travelling in the aforesaid motorcar driven by driver co-accused
Muhammad Iftikhar. In absence of any clear evidence/material on
record to prima facie establish conscious knowledge of the petitioner
qua the concealed narcotics or their nexus with the driver co-accused,
their participation in the commission of offence requires further probe,
hence, they entitled to the concession of bail in light of ratio of
judgments of the Hon’ble apex Court, rendered in cases titled, “Javed
Vs the State” (2017 SCMR 531), Cr.Petition No.1114 of 2017,
titled, “Farhad Khan Vs the State through AG, KPK” dated
21.12.2017, Cr.Mise.BA No.1573-P/2017, “Sad Khan Vs _ the
State/ANF” decided on 25.09.2017, Cr,Misc.BA No.1480-P/2017
decided on 25.07.2017 and Cr.Misc.BA No.2283-P/2017 decided on
27.10.2017, wherein bail has been granted to accused person(s) in
cases of recovery of narcotics, whose role was that of front-seater(s).
4. Besides, according to record petitioner Mst. Nadia is pregnant
of 21 weeks, whereas, petitioner Mst. Najma is having a suckling baby
of 2 years. In the famous case of Ghamidiyya, our Holy Prophet
Muhammad (S.A.W) had suspended the sentence of pregnant woman,
not only till delivery of her child but also posted it till suckling period

i.e. two years, obviously for the welfare of her kid, which indicate
towards the paramount importance and significance of the right of a
suckling child in Islam and the unprecedented care taken of, and the
protection given to a child born or expected to be born, by the Holy
Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W). It has been held by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in case titled “Mst. Nusrat Vs the State” (1996
SCMR 973), that the aforesaid golden principle of administration of
justice enunciated by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), must be
strictly observed and followed in the country and the august apex
Court, respectfully following the same golden principle, allowed bail
to petitioner in the cited case. The Apex Court in the last Paragraph of
the judgment added that the principles of justice enunciated by the
Muslim Jurists/Imams/Qazis are more illuminating and full of wisdom
than principles enunciated by the Western Jurists and scholars..

5. Accordingly, this and the connected Cr.Misc.BA no.2860-
P/2021 are allowed. Accused/petitioners are admitted to bail provided
each one of them furnishes bail bonds in the sum of rupees two lacs
with two local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial Magistrate/ MOD
concerned.
