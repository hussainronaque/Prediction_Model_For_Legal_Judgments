Criminal Appeal No.669 of 2023
Ahmad Muneel VERSUS _ The State etc.

JUDGMENT
26.06.2023

Syed Musa Raza Shah, Advocate.

Mr. Zawar Hussain Qureshi, Assistant Attorney General.

SAFDAR SALEEM SHAHID, J— The instant appeal has
assailed order dated 17.06.2023, whereby the learned Additional

District Judge, Multan has convicted the appellant under Section
228, P.P.C. and sentenced him to 07 days.

2. Brief facts necessary for decision of the instant appeal are
that the appellant Ahmad Muneel S.I/F.1.A. was summoned as a
witness, being a raiding officer in a case titled “The State vs.
Muhammad Nasir”, registered under Sections 3 and 4 of the Money
Laundering Act, 2010, but since he was avoiding to appear on the
pretext that he was busy before the High Court without pointing out
any specific case, the learned trial Court issued him a show cause
notice under Section 228, P.P.C. for deliberately causing hindrance
in the judicial proceedings as well as show cause notice under
Section 155-C, Police Order, 2002. However, on the next date
neither the appellant appeared before the Court nor filed reply to
the show cause notice, therefore, the learned trial Court convicted

and sentenced him in the above terms.
3. Arguments heard. Record perused.

4. Record reveals that in the afore-referred case the appellant
was present before the trial Court as PW on 14.06.2023, but his
statement could not be recorded. However, the appellant did not
appear on next two consecutive dates i.e. 15.06.2023 & 16.06.2023.
It was informed by the SHO concerned on 16.06.2023 that the

appellant was avoiding to appear on the pretext that he was busy
Crl. Appeal No.669/2023 2

before the High Court and the learned trial Court keeping in view
the said statement issued him show cause notice for deliberately
avoiding appearance before the Court and causing hindrance in the
judicial proceedings. However, when the appellant again did not
appear on the date fixed or submit reply to the show cause notice,
the learned trial Court convicted and sentenced him under Section
228, P.P.C. with the observation that he was deliberately and
intentionally disobeying the direction of Court and creating

hindrance in the judicial proceedings.

5. In order to properly appreciate the contentions of the parties
it would be appropriate to go through the provisions of Section 228,
P.P.C. as also the definitions of ‘contempt of Court’, ‘violation’ and

‘disobedience’. Section 228, P.P.C. reads as under:--

"§.228.---Intentional insult or interruption to public servant
sitting in judicial proceedings. Whoever intentionally offers
any insult, or causes any interruption to any public servant,
while such public servant is sitting in any stage of a judicial
proceeding, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a
term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may
extend to three thousand rupees, or with both."

The Contempt of Court has been defined in section 3 of the

Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003, which reads as under:--

"S.3.---Whoever disobeys or disregards any order, direction
or process of a Court, which he is legally bound to obey or
commits a willful breach of a valid undertaking given to a
Court or does anything which is intended to or tends to bring
the authority of a Court or the administration of law into
disrespect or to disrepute, or to interfere with or obstruct or
interrupt or prejudice the process of law or the due course of
any judicial proceedings, or to lower the authority of a Court
or scandalize a Judge in relation to his office or to disturb the
order or decorum of a Court, is said to commit "Contempt of
Court."

Violation means an act of irreverence or desecration, whereas

disobedience means refusal or failure to obey rules, laws, etc.

6. It is apparent from the plain reading of Section 228, P.P.C.,
reproduced above, that mens rea/intention to offer any insult or to
cause any interruption are necessary ingredients for constituting an

offence under Section 228, P.P.C. As such the only point to be
Crl. Appeal No.669/2023 3

determined would be ‘whether act of the appellant amounted to
intentional insult and/or interruption to public servant while such

public servant was sitting in any stage of a judicial proceeding’.

7. It is settled that a man is responsible, not for his acts in
themselves, but for his acts coupled with the mens rea or guilty
mind with which he did those acts. Before penalizing a person the
Court must be satisfied that an act has been done which, by reason
of its harmful tendencies or results, is fit to be repressed by way of
penal discourse and that the mental attitude of the doer towards his
deed was such as to render punishment effective as a deterrent for
the future. Criminal liability may require the wrongful act to be
done intentionally or with some further wrongful purpose in mind,
or it may suffice that it was done recklessly and in each case the
mental attitude of the doer is such as to make punishment effective.
Similarly, an intention is the purpose or design with which an act is
done. This may consist of an intention to perform some further act,
an intention to bring about certain consequences or perhaps merely

an intention to do the act itself.

8. It is also well-settled that in order to hold and determine that
accused/contemner actually contravened the law of contempt of
Court, all the circumstances relating to the act of contempt will
have to be scanned and scrutinized. The contempt has been
classified by the American Encyclopedia of Law and Procedure, in

four categories i.e. direct, constructive, criminal and civil:

a. A direct contempt is open insult in the presence of the
Court to the person of the presiding judge, or defiance in
his presence to his powers or authority.

b.A constructive contempt is an act done in the presence of
the Court but at a distance which tends to be little, to
degrade or to obstruct, interrupt, prevent, or embarrass the
administration of justice.

c. A criminal contempt is conduct that is directed against the
dignity and authority of the Court. Acts punishable as
criminal contempt are in the nature of crimes, in that they
involve the idea of punishment as a penalty for the
commission of the unauthorized act.
Crl. Appeal No.669/2023 4

d.A civil contempt consists in failing to do something
ordered to be done by a Court in a criminal action for the
benefit of the opposing party therein.

Admittedly, the trial Court has powers to punish for committing the
Contempt of the Court under section 228, P.P.C., but it was to be
seen that the act of contempt by disobeying/violating the order was
committed on the face of the Court. However, in the instant case
the appellant was not present before the Court and there was a
request for adjournment on the ground that he was busy before the
High Court, when the trial Court issued notice under Section 228,
P.P.C. observing that he was deliberately and intentionally avoiding
to appear before the Court, without having conducted any inquiry
with regard to his presence before the High Court on that date. The
appellant was also not present before the Court when he was held
guilty of contempt of Court as against the afore-referred categories
of contempt of Court, as in the first two categories, the words used
are ‘in presence of the Court’, whereas the third category relates to
criminal contempt are in the nature of crimes and fourth category
consists in failing to do something ordered to be done by a Court in
a criminal action for the benefit of the opposing party therein.
Admittedly, neither the appellant acted in violation/disobedience of
any order in presence of the Court, as required in first two
categories, nor his acts were in the nature of crimes punishable
under third category, or for benefit of other party as required by

fourth category.

9. So far as the acts of ‘violation’ and ‘disobedience’ allegedly
committed by the appellant, punishments for the same have been
provided in the Code of Criminal Procedure, as such the trial Court
erred in law in holding the appellant guilty of contempt of Court for
the said acts. Even otherwise, procedure has been provided in the
Criminal Procedure Code in certain cases of contempt. Section 480
Cr.P.C. emerges that when any such offence as is described in
Section 175, Section 178, Section 179, Section 180, or Section 228

of the P.P.C. is committed in the view or presence of any Civil,
Crl. Appeal No.669/2023 5

Criminal or Revenue Court, the Court may cause the offender to be
detained in custody and at any time before the rising of the Court
on the same day may, if it thinks fit, take cognizance of the offence
and sentence the offender to fine not exceeding two hundred
rupees; and, in default of payment to simple imprisonment for a
term which may extend to one month, unless such fine be sooner
paid. Section 481, Cr.P.C. further emerges that (1) in every such
case the Court shall record the facts constituting the offence, with
the statement (if any) made by the offender, as well as the finding
and sentence and (2) if the offence is under Section 228, P.P.C., the
record shall show the nature and stage of the judicial proceedings in
which the Court interrupted or insulted was sitting and the nature of
the interruption or insult. Section 482, Cr.P.C. further provides that
(1) if the Court in any case considers that a person accused of any
of the offences referred to in Section 480, Cr.P.C. and committed in
its view or presence should be imprisoned otherwise than in default
of payment of fine, or that a fine exceeding two hundred rupees
should be imposed upon him or such Court is for any other reasons
of opinion that the case should not be disposed of under Section
480, Cr.P.C., such Court, after recording the facts constituting the
offence and the statement of the accused as hereinbefore provided,
may forward the case to a Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the
same and may require security to be given for the appearance of
such accused person before such Magistrate, or if sufficient security
is not given shall forward such person in custody to such Magistrate
and (2) the Magistrate, to whom any case is forwarded under this
section, shall proceed to hear the complaint against the accused

person in the manner hereinbefore provided.

10. From the plain reading of the provisions of the above
mentioned sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it reveals
that a specific procedure has been provided in law for punishing a
contemnor under section 228, P.P.C. He can be punished under
section 480 of the Code of Criminal Procedure till the rising of the

Court and to pay a fine not exceeding two hundred and in default of
Saleh

Crl. Appeal No.669/2023 6

the payment to simple imprisonment for a term which may extend
to one month. The procedure provided in Section 480, Cr.P.C. is
attracted to the cases where the Court in whose view or presence
the contempt has been committed or the Court, which has been

insulted or the proceedings have been interrupted by the offender.

11. Section 480 Cr.P.C. deals with what is known as direct
Contempt of Court and in such an exigency, the Court has an
option to proceed either under section 480, Cr.P.C. or under section
476, Cr.P.C. The alleged acts of ‘violation’ or ‘disobedience’ would
not be taken as interference or interruption in the Court's work.
Although the trial Court had jurisdiction to convict any person for
committing contempt of the Court, but only in the circumstances
mentioned in Section 228, P.P.C. The law has provided the
procedure for proceeding against a contemnor who committed
contempt of Court or insulted the Court on its face. In such-like
cases, the Court is bound to follow the procedure provided in
Sections 480 and 476, Cr.P.C. and where the Courts have not
followed the procedure provided in section 480, Cr.P.C. the
conviction and sentence are not maintainable. In this context,
reference can be made to the cases of Haji Khawar Saleem vs. The
State (2000 SCMR 1856), Muhammad Mushtaq vs. State (PLJ
2003 SC 450), Agha Siraj Khan Durrani vs. The State (2000
P.Cr.L.J. 1329) and Muhammad Afzal vs. State (PLJ 2015
Cr.C (Lahore) 433).

12. For the foregoing reasons and following the dictum laid
down in the precedents (supra), the instant appeal is accepted, the
impugned order dated 17.06.2023 awarding conviction & sentence

to the appellant is set aside and he is acquitted of the charge.
