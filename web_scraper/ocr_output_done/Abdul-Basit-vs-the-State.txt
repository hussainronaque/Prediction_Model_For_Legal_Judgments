ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, J:- At a trial held by learned
Additional Sessions Judge, Karak at Takht-e-Nasrati,
accused Abdul Basit, having been found guilty of
committing murder of Abdul Jawad deceased, has been
convicted under section 302 (b) PPC and sentenced to
death as well as to pay Rs.2,00,000/-, as compensation to
legal heirs of the deceased in terms of section 544-A
Cr.P.C. and in default thereof to undergo 06 months simple
imprisonment, vide judgment dated 19.012.2014, in case
FIR No.157 dated 13.05.2011, registered under sections
302/324/34 PPC, at Police Station Yaqook Khan Shaheed
Takht-e-Nasrati, District Karak.

2. The appellant-convict has filed instant appeal

against his conviction and _ sentences, whereas,
complainant/petitioner Lal Marjan has filed Cr.R.
No.01-B/2015, for enhancement of compensation amount
and Cr.A. No.11-B/2015, against acquittal of the accused
Abdul Basit under section 324 PPC.

3. Since all the matters are arising out from one and
the same judgment of the learned trial Court, therefore, we
propose to decide the same through this single judgment.

4. The prosecution case as unfolded in First
Information Report (FIR) is that on 13.05.2011 at 18.45
hours, complainant Lal Marjan (PW.1), in company of
dead body of his son Abdul Jawad deceased, reported to
Haji Rehman SHO (PW.5) to the effect that on the eventful
day he along with sons Abdul Samad (PW.2) and the
deceased arrived from Karachi to their house, situated in
village Damgari Siraj Khel. At about 18.15 hours, they left
home to see his daughter Mst. Abdia Rehman (PW.3),
(wife of appellant Abdul Basit). The moment, they came
out from the house, appellant along with co-accused
Nawab Khan (acquitted on the basis of compromise), duly
armed with pistols present there opened fire at them. Due
to firing of appellant; Abdul Jawad deceased got hit and
died at the spot, whereas, he and PW Abdul Samad luckily
remained unscathed from the firing of the acquitted
co-accused. Motive for the occurrence is that appellant
Abdul Basit used to tease his wife Mst. Abida Rehman

(PW.3). Report of the complainant was recorded into
writing in the shape of Murasila Exh.PW.1/1 by Haji
Rehman SOH (PW.5), on the basis of which FIR
Exh.PW.6/1, was registered against the accused. He also
prepared injury sheet Exh.PW.5/1 and inquest report
Exh.PW.5/2 of the deceased and sent his dead body to the
mortuary for autopsy. Dr. Gul Sanat Shah SMO (PW.8)
conducted postmortem examination on the dead body of
the deceased on 13.05.2011 at 07.30 p.m. and found a
firearm entry wound on front of his chest at 4" left
intercostals space measuring % inch x % inch, with
corresponding exit wound on right lower side chest.
According to him, direction of the injury was from upside
to downward and slightly from left to right side. He opined
the probable time between injury and death as 20 to 25
minutes and between death and postmortem as | % hours.
He further opined that firearm injury to vital organs i.e.
heart, lungs and blood vessels resulted into the death of the
deceased.

5. Mir Shah Jehan SI (PW.11) was entrusted with the
task of investigation. He proceeded to the spot and
prepared site plan Exh.PB at the pointation of
eyewitnesses. During spot inspection, he secured
bloodstained earth Exh.P.2 from the place of the deceased
vide recovery memo Exh.PW.4/2 and 2 empties of 30 bore
giving fresh smell of discharge vide recovery memo

Exh.PW.4/2. Similarly, vide recovery memo Exh.PW.10/1,
he took into possession the last worn bloodstained
garments of the deceased; recorded statements of the PWs
under section 161 Cr.P.C.; sent the bloodstained articles
and the empties to the FSL, reports whereof are Exh.PZ
and Exh.PZ/1, respectively. As the appellant was avoiding
his lawful arrest therefore, he initiated proceedings under
section 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. against him. After completion
of investigation he handed over case file to the SHO who
submitted challan u/s 512 Cr.P.C. against the appellant.

6. The appellant was settled at Karachi, hence,
Muhammad Nazeer SI (PW.9), proceeded there and
arrested him in the instant case vide arrest card
Exh.PW.9/1. He shifted the appellant to District Karak and
after expiry of his physical remand on 28.07.2013, he was
sent to judicial lockup.

7. On completion of investigation, supplementary
challan was submitted against the appellant before the
learned trial Court, where he was charge sheeted to which
he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To prove its case,
the prosecution examined as many as twelve witnesses.
After closure of the prosecution evidence, statement of the
appellant was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein
he denied the prosecution allegations and professed his
innocence. He, however, neither wished to be examined on
oath nor opted to produce evidence in defence. On

conclusion of trial, the learned trial court after hearing both
the sides convicted and sentenced the appellant as
mentioned above.

8. We have heard the exhaustive arguments of
learned counsel for the parties and perused the record with
their able assistance.

9. Ocular account of the occurrence has been
furnished by complainant Lal Marjan (PW.1), Abdul
Samad (PW.3) and Mst. Abida Rehman (PW.3). The
former is father and the latter two are the brother and sister
of the deceased. Needless to mention that PW Mst. Abida
Rehman is not cited as eyewitness in the FIR, whereas,
Abdul Samad (PW.2) did not accompany his father and the
deceased brother to the hospital. No doubt, conviction can
be recorded on the basis of evidence of close relatives
provided their testimony is trustworthy, confidence
inspiring and corroborated by strong independent
circumstances of the case.

Complainant Lal Marjan appearing as PW.1 while
reiterating the same version as set forth by him in the initial
report Exh.PW.1/1, introduced a lot of innovations about
mode of occurrence, citing Mst. Abida Rehman as
eyewitness, arrangement of vehicle for shifting the
deceased to the hospital coupled with addition of
attributing two fire shots to each accused. In the initial
report, he has categorically and in unequivocal words

mentioned that after receiving fire shot, the deceased
succumbed to injury and died there and then at the spot,
whereas, according to Dr. Gul Sanat Shah (PW.8),
probable time elapsed between injury and death is 20 to 25
minutes. In this backdrop, complainant (PW.1), in order to
bring his testimony in line with the medical evidence by
making dishonest improvement in his court statement
deposed that Abdul Jawad after receiving injury, was
picked up by Abdul Samad (PW.2), in injured condition
and he arranged a datsun in which the injured was shifted
to the hospital. Abdul Samad while appearing as PW.2
deposed that after receiving injury Abdul Jawad expired at
the spot. The version of the complainant in the initial report
about death of the deceased at the spot and that of PW
Abdul Samad is belied by the medical evidence, while
addition by complainant in his examination-in-chief, qua
death of the deceased is nothing but a dishonest
improvement so as to bring his testimony in line with
medical evidence. In cross-examination, he was confronted
with his initial report wherein he admitted it correct that he
has not given details and number of fire shots fired by each
accused as well as the total fire shots in the initial report.
He further deposed that he did not notice any blood oozing
from the wound of the deceased rather saw that Abdul
Samad who had taken Abdul Jawad in his lap. Abdul
Samad (PW.2) in cross-examination deposed that wound of

the deceased did not bleed on the ground and a very small
quantity of blood besmeared shirt of the deceased. He
further deposed that he had not noticed any blood fallen on
the ground from the wound of the deceased. The aforesaid
versions of PW.1 and PW.2, is not only contradicting and
negating the site plan Exh.PB and the testimony of Mir
Shah Jehan (PW.11)/I.O., who during spot inspection has
secured allegedly bloodstained earth Exh.P.2 from the
place of the deceased which was sent to the FSL along with
last worn bloodstained clothes of the deceased, report
whereof Exh.PZ is secured in positive, but is also making
the alleged place of occurrence highly doubtful and
controversial. Abdul Samad PW.2 is not rider of the report
of complainant. Complainant deposed that while shifting
the deceased to the hospital he did not accompany him and
that he shifted the deceased all alone. Similar is the stance
of PW Abdul Samad, who deposed that he did not
accompany the deceased to the hospital, rather went home.
The conduct of PW Abdul Samad is extremely against the
natural human conduct and beyond the comprehension of a
prudent mind as he being real brother of the deceased put
his corpse in the vehicle and let his aged father to shift it to
the hospital. In such like situation a brother cannot be
expected to leave the dead body of his deceased brother at
the mercy of his old father and opt to go an abandoned
house. Neither complainant nor PW Abdul Samad is

verifier of dead body of the deceased, rather one Khair
Zaman and Fazal ur Rehman, uncle of the deceased, have
been mentioned as verifiers of the dead body in the inquest
report. Complainant in cross-examination has disclosed
that house of the accused is situated in front of their house
and that when they reached in front of the accused’s house,
the accused started firing at them. He also disclosed that
place of the deceased is at a distance of 20 to 22 paces
from the house of the accused. Contrary, in the initial
report complainant has mentioned that no sooner they came
out from the house the accused fired at them. He while
contradicting his earlier version deposed that deceased was
ahead of them whereas he and PW Abdul Samad were
following him. Similar is the stance of PW Abdul Samad.
The complainant and PW Abdul Samad deposed that the
accused did not fire simultaneously rather accused Abdul
Basit made firing first. He made first fire on all of them
and thereafter fired second shot at Abdul Jawad deceased.
The above mentioned details do not find mention in the
initial report or in the statement of PW Abdul Samad.
Besides, the above mentioned improvements, direction of
the firearm injury on the person of the deceased from
upward to downward, as opined by the doctor, is yet
another disturbing aspect of the case, as the appellant has
not been shown on some high level than the deceased in
the site plan or in the initial report of the complainant. How

the deceased received injury from upward to downward has
not been explained by the prosecution witnesses. The
above discussed contradictions in the testimony of the two
alleged eyewitnesses coupled with deliberate dishonest
improvements create serious doubts in the prosecution
case, particularly, about presence of the alleged
eyewitnesses. In this view of the matter, we are firm in our
view to hold that both, the complainant (PW.1) and Abdul
Samad (PW.2), were not present at the spot at the time of
occurrence. The peculiar facts and circumstances of the
cases strongly suggest that the dead body of the deceased
was shifted to the hospital by his uncle Fazal ur Rehman
and one Khair Zaman, identifiers, whereafter presence of
the complaint was procured in the hospital and there he
lodged the report. Similarly, PWs Abdul Samad and
Mst. Abida Rehman are also procured witnesses that’s why
their testimony is suffering from material contradictions,
discrepancies and deliberate dishonest improvements. It
has been held by Hon’ble the Supreme Court in the case of
Amir Zaman Vs. Mahboob and others (1985 SCMR
685) that testimony of witnesses containing material
improvements are not believable and trustworthy. Likewise
in Akhtar Ali’s case (2008 SCMR 6) it was held that
when a witness made improvement dishonestly to
strengthen the prosecution’s case then his credibility
becomes doubtful on the well-known principle of criminal

jurisprudence that improvement once found deliberate and
10

dishonest, cast serious doubt on the veracity of such
witness. In Khalid Javed’s case (2003 SCMR 149) such
witness who improved his version during the trial was
found wholly unreliable. Reliance in this respect may also
be placed on the cases of Mohammad Shafique Ahmad
Vs. The State (PLD 1981 SC 472), Syed Saeed
Mohammad Shah and another Vs. The State (1993
SCMR 550), and Mohammad Saleem Vs. Mohammad
Azam (2011 SCMR 474).

11. So far as testimony of Mst. Abida Rehman is
concermed, admittedly, during the day of occurrence she
was having cordial relation with appellant Abdul Basit,
however, after the occurrence she left his abode and shifted
to Karachi with her parents where dissolution of her
marriage with the appellant took place through Khula. She
is not named in the FIR as an eyewitness. In examination-
in-chief she narrated the story set forth by complainant in
the initial report but in cross-examination she disclosed
that the accused did not fire at her father and brothers in
the first instance, rather when they covered 20/22 paces,
the accused fired at them. She stated that her presence at
the spot was noticed by her father (complainant) and PW
Abdul Samad. She admitted that she is observing
“Pardha”. She deposed that she was present in her house
i.e house of the accused when she saw both the accused

whispering with each other having pistols in their hands, so
11

she sensed some danger therefore, she followed them, but
she was feeling that accused will not harm her father and
brothers. Such an assertion of Mst. Abida Rehman cannot
be woven into prosecution story, as according to
complainant on the day of occurrence, on arrival from
Karachi to their house, he along with his sons left house to
see his daughter Mst. Abida Rehman wife of the appellant.
The moment, they came out of their home, the accused
started firing at them. How the appellant or his wife Mst.
Abida Rehman came to know about arrival of the
complainant along with his sons from Karachi is a fact
which remained shrouded in mystery and has never been
explained by any witness, including Mst. Abida Rehman
(PW.3). We have found that testimony of PW.3 is also not
in line with the testimony of other purported eyewitnesses.
If her presence was noticed by her father/complainant and
PW Abdul Samad, she would have been named as
eyewitness in the FIR. If she was present at the spot, she
would have not lifted her deceased brother along with her
father and definitely accompanied them to the hospital. In
this view of the matter, she is also a procured witness,
therefore, her testimony has wrongly been believed and
relied upon by the learned trial Court. In case titled,
“Rashid Ahmed Vs Muhammad Nawaz and others”
(2006 SCMR 1152), it has been held by the Hon’ble

Supreme Court that testimony of the prosecution witness
12

not mentioned in the FIR, but introduced subsequently, had
no evidentiary value.

12. So far as motive part of the prosecution case is
concermed, suffice it to say that search of the record would
suggest that appellant and his wife Mst. Abida Rehman
(PW.3), were living prosperous life. So much so, the
appellant in connection of his job was settled with his
uncle (complainant) at Karachi and returned to his native
village just a day before the occurrence. From the
testimony of Mst. Abida Rehman it is apparent that on the
day and time of occurrence she was living in the house of
her husband appellant Abdul Basit, meaning thereby that
her relation with him were cordial and this fact goes
against the version of the complainant. Cordial relation
between the spouses has also been admitted by PW Abdul
Samad by deposing that after her Rukhsati, Mst. Abida
Rehman had never left house of her husband/appellant
before the occurrence. She was happy in the house of her
husband/appellant. No evidence either oral or documentary
has been brought on record by the prosecution to prove the
motive as alleged by the complainant. If, for the sake of
arguments, relations between Mst. Abida Rehman and the
appellant are considered to be strained then she should
have been the first target of the appellant and not the
deceased. Evidence available on record is not sufficient to

prove the motive.
13

13. As regards recovery of two crime empties of 30
bore and FSL report Exh.PZ/1 in respect thereof that these
have been fired from one and the same 30 bore pistol, on
one hand, no crime pistol has been shown recovered from
the appellant, therefore, mere recovery of empties would
not advance the prosecution case while on the other hand,
when we have disbelieved the direct/ocular account of the
occurrence then mere this piece of circumstantial evidence
which is always taken along with direct evidence, would
not be sufficient to sustain conviction of the appellant. In
this regard reliance can be placed in on the judgments
rendered by the Hon’ble apex court in Ijaz Ahmed’s case
(1997 SCMR 1279 and Asadullah’s case (PLD 1971 SC
541). Besides, in case titled, “Saifullah vs the State”
(1985 SCMR 410), it has been ruled by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court that:-

“When there is no eyewitness to be relied

upon, then there is nothing, which can be

corroborated by the recovery”.
14. As regards abscondence of the appellant, it is
settled law that mere abscondence of accused, cannot be a
substitute of real evidence. Abscondence by itself would be
of no avail to the prosecution in absence of any other
evidence against the absconding accused. Mere
abscondence of accused would not be enough to sustain

convict. Guidance in this regard can be derived from the
14

judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled,
“Muhammad Vs Pasham Khan” (1986 SCMR 823).

15. For what has been discussed above, we are firm in
our view to hold that prosecution has miserably failed to
prove the guilt of the appellant through cogent and
confidence inspiring direct or circumstantial evidence. The
prosecution evidence is pregnant with doubts and dishonest
improvements benefit of which should have been extended
to the appellant but the learned trial Court by not
appreciating the evidence in its true perspective landed into
the field of error by holding the appellant guilty of the
offence. As per golden principle of benefit of doubt one
substantial doubt would be enough for acquittal of the
accused. Under principle enunciated by the august apex
court of the country through different pronouncements, by
now it is settled law that conviction must be based on
unimpeachable evidence and certainty of guilt and any
doubt arising in prosecution case must be resolved in
favour of the accused. Indeed, this rule is based on the
maxim that “Jt is better that ten guilty persons be acquitted
rather than one innocent person be convicted”, which
occupied a pivotal place in the Islamic Law and is enforced
strictly in view of the saying of Holy Prophet (PBUH) that
“Mistake of Qazi (judge) in releasing a criminal is better
than his mistake in punishing an innocence person”.

Guidance derived from case titled, “Muhammad Khan
15

and another vs the State” (1999 SCMR 1220) and
“Muhammad Ikram vs the State” (2009 SCMR 230).

16. There is a legal aspect of the case i.e. the learned
trial Court has framed charge against the appellant under
section 324 PPC, however, has not given any findings qua
his guilt or innocence under the said offence. The learned
trial Court has also not mentioned in the impugned
judgment as to whether the appellant has been convicted or
acquitted under section 324 PPC, however, during the
course of arguments learned counsel for the appellant did
not stress on said legal point, rather argued that since
charge framed under section 324 PPC has been framed
against the appellant, therefore, passing of no order with
regard to his conviction or sentence under the said offence
by the learned trial Court, shall amount to acquittal of the
appellant under section 324 PPC, as such no prejudice
would be caused to the appellant if the case is decided on
merits. Record divulges that the occurrence pertains to the
year 2011 and appellant is behind the bars since 2013.
Admittedly, appeal is the continuation of trial. Had the
prosecution made out a case of conviction then remand of
the case to the trial Court for re-writing of judgment would
have been inevitable, but where the conviction and
sentence awarded to the appellant is sustainable and the
legal flaw is not causing any prejudice to the appellant then

remanding the case for to the learned trial Court for
16

re-writing judgment will not only be a futile effort, but will
further increase agonies of the parties.

17. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed, conviction and
sentence of the appellant recorded by the learned trial
Court vide impugned judgment are hereby set-aside and the
appellant is acquitted from the charge leveled against him.
He be set at liberty forthwith, if not confined in any other
case. On acquittal of the appellant connected Cr.A.
No.11-B of 2015 and Cr.R. No.01-B/2015, have become
infructuous, which are hereby dismissed.

18. Murder Reference No.11-B/2018 is hereby
answered in the Negative.

19. These are the reasons of our short order of even
date, which is reproduced below:-

For reasons to be recorded later, we allow this
appeal, set-aside the conviction and sentences of
the appellant-convict Abdul Basit, under section
302(b) PPC, recorded by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge, Karak at Takht-e-Nasrati vide
judgment dated 19.12.2014, in case FIR No.157
dated 13.05.2011, under sections 302/324/34
PPC, Police Station Yaqub Khan Shaheed,
District Karak. The appellant is acquitted from
the charge in the cited case. He be set at liberty
forthwith, if not confined in any other case.

On acquittal of the appellant, Murder

Reference No.11-B/2018, sent by the learned
17

trial Court, is answered in the Negative. Cr.R.

No.01-B/2015 having become infructuous is also

dismissed.
