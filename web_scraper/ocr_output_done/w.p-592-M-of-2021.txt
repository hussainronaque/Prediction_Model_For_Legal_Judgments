JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR,_J.-Through this single
judgement in the instant petition, we intend to decide this as well as

connected W.P_No.593-M/2021 titled “Akbar Zaman _and others

Vs._Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Finance at
Islamabad and others” and W.P_No.594-M/2021 titled “Zeeshan

Ahmad and others Vs. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary

Finance at Islamabad and others” as a common question of law

and facts is involved in all these petitions.

02. Relevant facts are that the petitioners of all these petitions
have earlier approached to this Court through Writ Petitions
No.1149-M.2018, No.788-M/2018 . and = No.98-M.2019 for
regularization of their services being based upon the judgments of
this Court dated 21.11.2019, 04.03.2020 & 22.09.2020, with
contention that they deserve similar treatment like their other
colleagues. Their writ petitions were resisted by the respondents,

however, same were allowed by this Court on 29.09.2020 through

SAB?. ALI (D.B) HON’ BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’ BLE MR, JUSTICE SHAHID) KELAN

consolidated judgment in W.P No.1 149-M/2018, wherein it was held

that “in light of what has been discussed above, all these connected
petitions are allowed to the effect that petitioners shall be treated_as

regular employees of the Bank for all intents and purposes”. For

implementation of the judgement of this Court, some of the
petitioners filed C.O.Cs No.76, 77 & 78-M/2020, during pendency
of which, on 24.02.2021, provisional appointment orders of the
petitioners were submitted before the Court pertaining to
regularization of the services of the petitioners, as such, on
24.02.2021 the applications submitted for contempt of Court
proceedings were disposed of, leaving the petitioners at liberty to
avail all other remedies, permissible under the law. The services of
the petitioners were regularized by the respondents in compliance
with the judgments/ orders of this Court dated 29.09.2020 in W.P
No.1149-M/2018 etc. and dated 24.02.2021 in C.0.C No.76-M/2021
etc. but from the date of judgment in writ petitions dated 29.09.2020.
The petitioners, being aggrieved from the date of their
regularization, have once again approached to this Court through
these petitions, with the prayer that their services may be regularized
from the date of their initial appointments.

03. Respondents were directed to submit their parawise
comments wherein it was contended that since the Civil Petition for
Leave to Appeal (CPLA) has been filed against the judgment of this
Court, which is still pending adjudication before the apex Court, as

such, though the petitioners were regularized but from the date of

SABZ ALI+ (D.B) LION’ BLE MR, JUSTICE MUNAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
ION’BLE MR, JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN

judgement and that too shall be subject to the decision of the apex
Court in the pending CPLA.

04. Arguments heard and record perused.

05. ‘It appears from the record that at the time of the decision of
Writ Petitions of the petitioners bearing No. 788-M/2018 etc.
through consolidated judgment in W.P No.1149-M/2018 dated
29.09.2020, this Court was apprised that the colleagues of the
petitioners have approached to this Court and this Court has allowed
their writ petitions on 21.11.2019, 04.03.2020 & 22.09.2020,
whereby the respondents were directed to regularize their services
from the date of their initial appointrhent and judgment of this Court
was assailed before the apex court through Civil Appeals No. 1340
to 1342 of 2014 but same were dismissed, against which, a review
petition was also filed and the same was dismissed by the apex
Court. This fact has not been denied by the respondents. It has also
not been disputed by them that other colleagues of the petitioners,
whose writ petitions were allowed by this Court, have been
regularized from the date of their initial appointments within the
purview of the judgments of this Court. It has also not been refuted
by the respondents that case of the petitioners is at par with those of
the petitioners whose writ petitions were allowed by this Court for
regularization of their services from the date of their initial
appointment. This Court after hearing the parties has held that the
petitions are allowed to the effect that the petitioners shall be treated
as regular employees of the Bank for all intents and purposes. The

operative part of the judgement of this court is self-speaking, clear,

SABZ ALI* (D.B) HON’ BLE MIR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAEID KHAN

lucid, open only to one interpretation and free from any ambiguity
that the petitions were allowed keeping in view the decision of this
Court in earlier round on the ground that similarly placed persons
should be treated alike.

06. The contention of learned counsel for the respondent/Bank is
that since their CPLA is still pending adjudication before the apex
Court against the judgment of this Court, therefore services of the
petitioners were regularized from the date of the judgment dated
29.09.2020. No doubt, that CPLA is pending adjudication before the
apex Court and the judgement passed by this Court in the earlier
round of litigation is subject to the decision of the apex Court,
whatever it may be, but the petitioners, who were sailing in the
same boat along with others colleagues whose services were
regularized from the date of their initial appointments and this Court
in its judgment has held that their petitions are allowed for all intents
and purposes, which refers that on the ground of similar treatment
in juxtaposition with Article 4 & 25 of the Constitution of Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 the writ petitions were allowed by this
Court. Last submission of the leamed counsel for the respondent/
bank was that this Court has never directed the respondents to
regularize the services of the petitioners from the date of initial
recruitment, suffice is to say that the term for all intent and purposes
is defined in Concise Oxford Dictionary Twelfth Edition as

attentively occupied with, showing carnest_and eager intention, for

all important respects. According to Collins Dictionary, a situation is

. 1 ‘
not exactly as you describe it; but the effect is the same as if it were.
SABZ ALI* (D.B) HON’ RLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR

It was defined as in almost every resp ect; practically: virtually. For
all practical purposes/to all inteiits and purposes. Osborn defined as
to say that one thing has the same effect or result as something else.
In the case of “Messrs Rajby Industries Karachi and others Versus

Federation of Pakistan and others” (2023 SCMR 1407), it was

observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that “this turn of phrase,
for all intents and purposes invests powers in the legislature to set
down any provision which may have an overriding effect on any
other legal provision under the same law or any other laws, being a
legislative apparatus and method of conferring overriding effect

over the law or provisions that qualifies such clause or section of

law.” In the case of “Rai Muhammad Riaz (decd) through L.Rs.

H 7

and others Versus Ejaz Ahmed and others” (PLD 2021 SC 761), it

was held by the apex Court that “strictly speaking and on the basis
of principles of law laid down by this Court in Muhammad Arshad &
Co v. Zila Council (2006 SCMR 1450), it is settled law that where
revival of the suit is based upon a conditional order and such
condition is not fulfilled by the Applicant, for all intents and
purposes the suit does not get restored”. Thus, the term for intents
and purposes is used in the meaning for all practicable purposes, as
already settled and held by the Court for implementation. Reliance
may be placed on the cases of Dr. Iqrar Ahmad Khan Versus Dr.
Muhammad Ashraf and others (2021 SCMR 1509) & Mudasir

Nazar_and_ 35 others Versus Bank of Khyber through M.D.
\ Peshawar and 3 others (2022 PLC(CS) 668).

07. +The respondents have not been able to distinguish the case of

petitioners, from those colleaguics of the petitioners whose petitions

were allowed by this Court and their services were regularized from

the date of their initial appointinents, therefore, the present

petitioners also deserve similar treatment.

08. Thus, for the reasons disctissed above, these petitions are

allowed as prayed for, with no order as to cost.
