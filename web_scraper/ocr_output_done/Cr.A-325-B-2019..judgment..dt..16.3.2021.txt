SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- This judgment shall
dispose of Cr.A.No.325-B of 2019 titled ‘Abdur Rahim
Vs. The State etc’ and the connected criminal revision
bearing No.66-B/2019, as both are the outcome of one and
same judgment, dated 15.10.2019, rendered by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-III/MCTC, Lakki Marwat, in
case FIR No.134 dated 27.4.2016, under sections
302/506/34 PPC of police station Ghazni Khel, District
Lakki Marwat, whereby the appellant was convicted under
Section 302(b) PPC and sentenced to life imprisonment
alongwith compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- (one million)
to be paid to the legal heirs of each of the deceased in

terms of section 544-A, Cr.P.C. or in default thereof to

-2-
suffer six months simple imprisonment, which shall be
recoverable as arrears of land revenue. He was further
convicted under Section 506 PPC and sentenced to
imprisonment for two years, with further conviction under
section 15 of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013, and
sentenced to imprisonment for one year. All the sentences
were ordered to run concurrently. Benefit of Section 382-
B, Cr.P.C. was extended to the convict.

2. The prosecution story, as disclosed in the FIR
Ex.PA, registered on the basis of murasila Ex. PW 3/1, is
that on 27.4.2016 at 17:30 hours, complainant Asmatullah
(PW-5), while present with the dead body of his uncle
Rehmatullah, made report on the spot to Haider Ali Shah
SHO (PW-3) to the effect that there was a land dispute
between Abdur Rahim and Haji Shah Nawaz and to
resolve the same, his uncle Rehmatullah was appointed as
arbitrator; that on the same day, he alongwith his uncle
Rehmatullah and cousin Kiramat Ullah (PW-6) had gone
for arbitration/medication between the parties; that the
first party was comprised of Abdur Rahim and Ahmad
Khan, while the second party consisted of Shah Nawaz
and Abdullah; that no sooner the arbitration started, Abdur
Rahim etc got annoyed and asked Rehmat Ullah that why

he came for arbitration as they would not give the

-3-
property to opposite party at any cost; that at about 17:15
hours, some altercation took place, upon which Abdur
Rahim and his son Ahmad Khan rushed to their house and
came back; that Abdur Rahim duly armed with DB 12
bore shotgun while his son Ahmad Khan armed with 303
bore rifle started firing at his uncle Rehmatullah with the
intention to commit his qatl-i-amd, as a result whereof, he
got hit and fell to the ground; that both the accused
criminally intimidated the complainant party by aiming
their respective weapons at them directing them not to
attend the injured; that accused Ahmad Khan escaped
from the spot, whereafter, the SHO of police station
Ghazni Khel alongwith police Nafri reached to the spot
and arrested accused Abdur Rahim alongwith weapon of
offence; that when they attended the injured, by then he
had succumbed to his injuries. Motvie for the offence was
stated to be some altercation during arbitration between
the parties. Besides the complainant, the occurrence was
stated to be witnessed by PWs Kiramat Ullah, Abdullah
and Haji Shah Nawaz. On the report of complainant, PW-
3 drafted murasila Ex. PW 3/1, prepared injury sheet Ex.
PW 3/2 and inquest report Ex. PW 3/3 of the deceased and
on arrival of the Investigating Officer to the spot, handed

over the accused alongwith card of arrest, the recovered

-4-
DB shotgun 12 bore alongwith the bandolier containing
12 rounds.

3. After completion of investigation, complete
challan was submitted by him to the trial Court, where on
the commencement of trial, the prosecution produced and
examined as many as eight witnesses, whereafter, accused
was examined under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he
denied the allegations and professed innocence, however,
neither he opted to be examined on oath in terms of
Section 340(2), Cr.P.C., nor produced evidence in his
defence. The learned trial Court after hearing arguments
of learned counsel for the parties vide judgment impugned
herein, convicted the accused and sentenced him, as
mentioned in earlier part of the judgment. The
convicts/appellant has assailed his conviction and
sentence through the instant appeal, while the complainant
has moved the connected criminal revision for
enhancement of sentence awarded to the appellant, which
are being decided through this common judgment.

4. We have heard learned counsel representing
the appellant, Additional Advocate-General assisted by
learned private counsel at length and with their valuable

assistance, the record was gone through.

-5-

5. The incident occurred on 27.4.2016 at 17:15
hours, where the deceased lost his life in front of the
house of the appellant. The motive was stated to be an
altercation between the deceased and the appellant. The
matter was reported to one Haider Ali Shah, SHO, who on
receiving information reached to the spot. It is pertinent to
mention that the appellant Abdur Rahim was arrested on
the spot, whereas co-accused Ahmad Khan could not be
arrested, as he allegedly decamped from the spot soon
after the incident.

6. At the time of arrest, the appellant was
allegedly armed with a DB shotgun, which was recovered
from his possession by Haider Ali Shah S.H.O (PW-3),
and on arrival of the Investigating Officer the same was
handed over to him, who inspected the same and extracted
an empty and a live cartridge from its barrels. Record tells
that on pointation of PW-3, the Investigating Officer
(PW-8) collected a Kalakov 222 bore lying by the side of
deceased alongwith an empty of the same bore. The
Investigating Officer also recovered an empty of 303 bore
from the place of incident lying near the place which was
assigned to the absconding co-accused.

7. The appellant at the time of his arrest informed

the scribe, that he was beaten by the deceased along with

-6-
PW Haji Shah Nawaz and Abdullah, who had come to the
spot to dispossess him of his property and that a scuffle
took place between the parties, at the time of scuffle PW
Abdullah was armed with a repeater 12 bore, which went
off, resulted into injury on person of the deceased who
later on died on the spot. In this respect the version of the
appellant was taken vide a Naqal Mad and an inquiry was
conducted u/s 156(3) Cr.P.C, but feeling dissatisfied the
appellant approached the Ex-Officio Justice of Peace
under section 22-A (6) Cr.P.C. asking direction for
registration of F.I.R, which was answered in positive,
resulting into registration of F.IL.R No. 354, under section
324/34 P.P.C, against the accused who at the end were
acquitted of the charges.

8. The learned trial Court, after a full-dressed
trial, passed a guilty verdict against the appellant vide
judgment under challenge. True, that the matter was
comprehensively dealt with; and that the prosecution
produced three of the eyewitnesses, who were allegedly
present at the time of incident; and that the appellant was
arrested from the spot duly armed, but this alone will not
serve the purpose, rather the prosecution is under the
bounden duty to establish its case against the accused

through confidence inspiring and trustworthy witnesses.

-7-
Admitted, that the convict/appellant was arrested from the
spot soon after the incident alongwith the weapon of
offence, but that alone will not serve the purpose rather
the prosecution is to travel a long way to prove the
appellant guilty. Right from the beginning both the
prosecution and defence came forward with their
respective versions before the Investigating Officer and
later before the trial Court, but towards the end it was the
version put forth by the prosecution, that prevailed with
the learned trial Court, whereas, the defence failed to
persuade.

9. This Court is to see as to whether the approach
of the learned trial Court is reasonable and as to whether
the conclusion drawn calls for interference or otherwise.
This Court is to determine as to whether the prosecution
succeeded in proving the charges against the appellant, or
that the counter claim had a substance, however, the duty
of the learned trial Court does not end here, rather it is to
unearth the real facts by placing both the versions in
juxtaposition, and it was for the trial Court to determine
that in case of suppression of facts which side is to be
burdened and with what liability.

10. The impugned judgment tells that the

trial Court was influenced from spot arrest of the appellant

-8-
along with the positive Laboratory report in respect of the
recovered weapon. The place of incident was an additional
factor which swayed the learned trial Court to convict the
appellant for the murder of the deceased. This Court is
still to resolve, as to whether the approach of the learned
trial Court was correct or that the learned trial Court was
still to labour, to unearth the twisted and concealed facts.
11. After scanning the record, it surfaced that on
the unfortunate day the deceased left for the spot along
with one Haji Shah Nawaz, the complainant, PW
Abdullah and son of the deceased, namely, Kiramatullah,
from the baithak of Haji Shah Nawaz situated at village
Gul Baz Dehkan, in order to resolve the differences in
respect of the disputed property and that it was during
negotiation that the temper rose high, which resulted into
the death of the deceased. The complainant was examined
as PW-05, who stated that on the day of incident he along
with the deceased and others visited the spot, while sitting
with the appellant and the absconding co-accused, they
Started negotiation in respect of the disputed property and
it was during negotiation that the appellant got infuriated,
rushed to his house along with his son, the absconding
accused, came duly armed and started firing at the

deceased. It was the fire shot of the appellant which

9

proved effective and the deceased after getting injured fell
to the ground and died on the spot. It was further stated
that all present wanted to attend the deceased then injured,
but the appellant prevented them by aiming his gun; and
that it was after some time that the deceased succumbed to
the injuries; on arrival of local police to the spot the matter
was reported. There is no denial to the fact that the matter
was reported on the spot, but we are anxious to know that
who informed the police, regarding the incident, as the
witnesses categorically stated that they did not inform the
police regarding the incident. The scribe was examined as
PW-01, who stated that while on gusht at village Gul
Baz Dehkan, he received information on his mobile
phone, but till the end he failed to explain that who
conveyed the information. The presence of the
complainant and PW Kiramatullah, does not appeal to a
prudent mind, despite their hectic efforts they failed to
establish their presence on the spot. Both these witnesses
appeared before the trial Court, but they failed to connect
themselves with the purpose. It was stated that they
accompanied the deceased to the spot to help in
mediation, but both of them contradicted each other on
this particular aspect of the case. They failed to convince

that who asked their help in mediation and even nothing

-10-

was brought on record regarding the constitution of a
Jirga. The witnesses admitted that in case of arbitration
both sides are asked the people of their choice to represent
them and when a consensus is built up the parties are
bound down by depositing security, but the record is silent
that who were nominated as arbitrators and that when the
security was deposited, rather both these witnesses
admitted that the deceased was the sole arbitrator, which
is unusual. Though the witnesses struggled hard to
convince, but they could not get the desired results.

12. The prosecution witnesses failed to reconcile
each other in respect of the recoveries effected from the
spot. The complainant stated that when Haider Ali Shah
S.H.O reached to the place of incident he arrested the
accused/ appellant and from his personal possession the
weapon of offence was recovered. He further stated that
the Investigating Officer in their presence recovered a
Kalakov 222 bore, lying near the deceased along with an
empty lying on the spot, but PW-06 contradicted his
stance and stated that no empty of 222 bore was recovered
from the spot; and that he could not say as to whether the
Investigating Officer took in to possession a Kalakov
lying near the deceased. The matter does not end here,

rather PW Abdullah introduced another story, when he

-ll-
was examined as PW-07. He stated that after the deceased
was fired at, the appellant took into possession the
Kalakov of the deceased and started firing at the walls of
his house, which created bullet marks and that when the
Investigating Officer reached to the spot, he extracted the
spent bullets therefrom. This explanation in no way
favours the prosecution, rather it has damaged the
prosecution case beyond repair.

13. The doctor who conducted autopsy on the dead
body of the deceased was examined as PW-1, who
confirmed that the deceased survived for long thirty
minutes after receiving firearm injuries. If the witnesses
were present on the spot, why they did not shift the
deceased then injured to the hospital, as the motorcar was
available on the spot. Had the witnesses including son of
the deceased, were present on the spot, they would not let
the deceased die, rather their first priority would have
been to save his life. An abortive attempt was made to
cover the situation, when the witnesses stated that the
appellant was not allowing them to attend till the deceased
lost his life, but it is hard for a prudent mind to accept.
The conscious effort on part of the witnesses takes us
nowhere, but to hold that they were not present on the

spot; and that it was after receiving information regarding

-12-

the death of the deceased their presence was procured and
the matter was reported on the spot. Though the presence
of PW-07, has been admitted by the appellant when he
was charged in case F.I.R No.354 under section 324/34
P.P.C, but PW Abdullah came forward with twisted and
concealed facts.

14. On arrival of the Investigating Officer to the
spot, the weapon recovered from possession of the
appellant was handed over. The Investigating Officer also
recovered one empty of 303 bore near from the place of
the absconding co-accused, whereas from the place of the
deceased a rifle 222 bore along with an empty were taken
into possession. The site-plan was prepared on pointation
of the eye-witnesses with an addition in respect of the
bullet marks on pointation of PW-03 Haider Ali Shah
S.H.O. It is pertinent to mention that from the walls spent
bullets were extracted. The recovered weapons along with
empties were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory, and
a positive report was received in that respect.

15. It leaves no ambiguity that the deceased also
resorted to firing, which though did not hurt the appellant
but created bullet marks on the surrounding walls and this
factor alone is sufficient to dispel what the complainant

stated, rather an inference can be drawn that in fact both

C

13

the sides resorted to firing. It is pertinent to mention that
the Investigating Officer has placed on file the revenue
record of the disputed property. It was also brought on
record that a civil suit was pending between the parties in
respect of the land in question. The Investigating officer
admitted on record that even on the day of occurrence, an
application for temporary injunction was fixed before the
concerned Court, where both the parties put their
appearance.

16. In order to understand the issue in its true spirit,
it is essential to read the explanation given by the
appellant, when his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C,
was recorded and when he reported the matter. The
appellant stated that on the day of incident both the sides
had attended the Court proceedings, where an application
for temporary injunction was to be decided and it was on
dismissal of the application, he left for his house followed
by the deceased along with Haji Shah Nawaz and PW
Abdullah, when they reached to the place of incident he
was over powered, beaten and in that eventuality, the
repeater 12 bore in possession of the PW Adbullah went
off which resulted into the death of the deceased. We do
not agree with what the appellant narrated, as on one

hand, he was arrested on the spot and on the other, the

14

recovered empty matched with the weapon which was
taken into possession at the time of his arrest. We lurk no
doubt in our mind that it was the appellant who killed the
deceased, but we cannot ignore that during spot inspection
the Investigating officer also recovered a Kalakov
belonging to the deceased along with an empty lying on
the spot, which too yielded to a positive report. The record
further tells that these were the fire shots of the deceased
which struck the walls and the spent bullets were
recovered by the Investigating Officer therefrom. The
circumstances tell that it was not only the appellant who
initiated, rather the deceased was also instrumental in
aggravating the situation. The overall situation leads us
nowhere, but to hold that it was the joint venture of both,
i.e. the appellant and the deceased, which aggravated the
situation to an extent that claimed the life of deceased, we
cannot forget that the appellant at the time of his arrest
was 70/71 years of age, an age where to kill is the rarest
choice. The approach of the deceased and others to the
spot duly armed tells another story. Both the sides twisted
the facts to their favour and no one came forward with the
whole truth. The proceedings before the civil court on the
day of incident suggests that these were the deceased and

two others who chased the appellant to his house. When

15

two of the witnesses failed to establish their presence on
spot and the third one i.e. PW Abdullah, though present
suppressed the real facts, in such eventuality this Court is
to form its own independent opinion, keeping before the
attending circumstances of the case. We feel no hesitation
to hold that the deceased was equally responsible as the
appellant was, and it is still a mystery that who out of the
two took the start. The overall situation leads us to hold
that the sentence awarded does not meet the ends of
justice, in our view the appellant deserves a sentence
under section 302(c) P.P.C, instead of 302(b) P.P.C. The
matter in hand has already been dealt with by the august
Peshawar High Court Peshawar, in its case, titled Sultanat
Khan Vs the State and others”. in JCr.A No.233-M/2016,
decided on 28.11.2017 in the following manner

“No doubt, the appellant had not taken
the plea of self defence, neither in his
report nor in the statement recorded
under section 342 Cr.P.C, but it is by
now Settled that if an accused has not
specifically taken the plea of self
defence, but the circumstance of the
case and the prosecution evidence
suggests that the accused has acted in
his self defence, its benefit can be
extended to him.”

16

The factum of suppression of real facts of the appellant by
both the sides, are the circumstances suggesting the act of
firing by the appellant to have been committed in exercise
of his defence, the benefit of which can be extended to
him irrespective of the fact that he did not specifically

take that plea during trial. Reliance is placed on case titled

“Ghulam Fareed Vs _the State” (2009 SCMR_ 929),

wherein it has been held that:

“The appellant did not raised this plea
during trial either in his statement under
section 342, Cr.P.C. or at the time when
the prosecution witnesses were subjected
to cross-examination. There is no bar to
raise such plea despite having not taken
the said plea specifically during trial,
and the court can infer the same from
the evidence led during trial, if the same
is tenable. However, to justify such an
inference, in favour of the accused who
stands convicted on a murder charge and
sentenced to death, his conduct during
the occurrence should fall within the
parameters of private defence, as
codified in the Pakistan Penal Code.”
17, This view is further substantiated by a

celebrated judgment from the Indian jurisdiction reported

as “Munshi Ram and others Vs. Delhi_Administration

(AIR 1968 SC _702).The question whether an accused can

get benefit of the circumstances showing that he acted in

17

his defence, though he did not take that plea specifically,
the august Supreme Court of India held that:

“It is well settled that even if an
accused, does not plead self defence, it
is open to the court to consider such a
plea if the same arises from the
material on record.... The burden of
establishing that plea is on the accused
and that burden can be discharged by
showing preponderance of
probabilities in favour of that plea on

the basis of the material on record.”

18. The situation is further been clarified by the
apex Court, in its recent reported judgment “Raza and

another Vs the State and others, (2020 SCMR 1185),

wherein it is held that:

“As observed earlier, that the occurrence
had taken place due to the act of the
deceased, which enraged the mental
faculty of the petitioner and under the
impulses of the same the instant
occurrence had taken place, the same is
spelled out from the record and as such
the benefit of the same is available for
which so many circumstances are not
required rather the glimpse of the same is
always deemed sufficient, which has been
established by the Superior Court from
time to time.”

11. For what has been discussed above,

we are of the considered view that

18

sentence inflicted upon the petitioner by
learned Courts below under section
302(b), P.P.C. is not made out, therefore,
keeping in view the facts narrated above,
instant petition is converted into appeal
and same is partially allowed and we
convert the sentence from imprisonment
for life under section 302(b), P.P.C. to
imprisonment for 10 years under section
302(c), P.P.C.

19. After deriving wisdom from the quoted
judgments, this court reaches to the safest conclusion to
modify the sentence, awarded to the appellant in order to
avoid miscarriage of justice. We, therefore, partially
allow the appeal in hand by convicting the appellant u/s
302(c) P.P.C to 10-years RI and is burdened with
compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- (two lac) u/s 544-A
Cr.P.C, to be paid to the legal heirs of the deceased
recoverable as arrears of land revenue, or in default
whereof the convict shall further undergo (3) three
months SI. Whereas conviction and sentence under
section 15 AA is maintained. Both the sentences shall run
concurrently. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C is also

extended to the accused/ appellant. As the prosecution

> > -19-
has failed to prove its case u/s 506 P.P.C, against the
appellant, so the sentence awarded under section 506
P.P.C is set aside and the appellant is acquitted therefrom.
As the sentence awarded to the appellant Abdur Rahim
has been modified, therefore, the connected Cr. R No.66-

B of 2019, has become redundant, is dismissed as such.
