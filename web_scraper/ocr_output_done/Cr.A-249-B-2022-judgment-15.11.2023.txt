Dr. Khurshid Iqbal, J.-

1. By this single opinion, we intend to dispose of both the
instant criminal appeal and Criminal Appeal #11-B/2023. Both of
them arise from a judgment, dated 06.12.2022, passed by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-V, Bannu. Through the
judgment, rendered in case FIR # 338, dated 12.06.2019,
registered at Basia Khel Police Station in District Bannu, the
appellant Fazal Nawaz alias Muhammad Shafi was convicted
under section 302(b) PPC and sentenced to life imprisonment. He
was made liable to pay Rs.5,00,000/- (five hundred thousand
rupees) as compensation to the legal heirs of the deceased
Muhammad Haleem, as per section 544-A Cr.P.C. In default of
this payment, he was ordered to suffer 01 year simple
imprisonment. The benefit under section 382-B Cr.P.C was
extended to him, while he was acquitted of the charge under
section 324 PPC, pertaining to an ineffective murderous assault at

the complainant's life.

2. Briefly, on 12.06.2019, at 08:15 hours, the complainant,
Hayat Ullah Khan, while present at the crime scene with the dead
body of his deceased brother Muhammad Haleem, reported that
on the fateful morning, he and his deceased brother were en route
to a shop in Torka Bazar, traveling by foot from their residence.
Muhammad Haleem was going a few paces ahead while the
complainant was following him. On reaching the fields near
Maizer Chowk, at 08:00 hours, they encountered the appellant
Muhammad Shafi, a fellow villager, accompanied by two
unidentified assailants, duly armed with pistols. Upon spotting the
complainant and his brother, they started firing at them in order to
commit their qatl-i-amd. As a result, Haleem Khan sustained
injuries from the shots fired by the appellant Muhammad Shafi,
while the complainant luckily escaped unhurt. Post-incident, the
assailants fled the scene. The complainant being empty handed
could do nothing. On being attended by the complainant, Haleem
Khan succumbed to his injuries at the spot. The disclosed motive

behind the incident points to a dispute over a pathway wall.

3. After completion of the investigation, complete challan
under Section 173 Cr.P.C was prepared and submitted against the
appellant for proceedings under section 512 Cr.P.C due to his
abscondence. Subsequently, after his arrest, supplementary
challan was submitted. The appellant, being in custody, was
produced before the court through Zamima Bay. Copies of
statements and documents, as per the provisions of section 265-C
Cr.P.C, were provided to him. Subsequently, charge was framed,
to which he pleaded not guilty, opting for trial. The prosecution
produced 11 witnesses to substantiate its case. During the
appellant's examination under Section 342 Cr.P.C, he denied the
charges and refuted the prosecution's evidence. However, he
chose not to avail the opportunity to present evidence in his
defence or to provide a statement on oath, as mandated by section
340(2) Cr.P.C. After hearing arguments, the trial court adjudged
the appellant guilty, leading to his conviction and sentencing

under Section 302(b) PPC to life imprisonment as aforesaid.

However, he was acquitted of the charge under Section 324 PPC.
Dissatisfied with his conviction, the appellant has filed this
appeal, while the complainant, aggrieved by the appellant's
acquittal, has filed the connected appeal.

4. Arguments heard. Record perused.

5. The foundation of the prosecution case relies on multiple
pillars. Those include the ocular account, circumstantial evidence,
medical evidence, abscondence, and the alleged motive.
Primarily, the ocular account, representing the firsthand
testimony, takes precedence. This pivotal aspect centers on the
solitary statement provided by the complainant (PW-10), who, as
an eyewitness, plays a fundamental role in elucidating the
sequence of events leading to the occurrence and the proceedings
that followed. In scrutinizing the credibility and coherence of the
complainant's account, this court has meticulously examined the
intricate interplay of evidence, endeavouring to unveil the

truthfulness of the events as narrated and presented.

6. The deposition of the complainant, as mentioned in the
FIR, is straightforward. According to him, he and the deceased
were en route to their shop. Upon reaching the spot, the appellant,
accompanied by two unidentified assailants, armed with pistols,
started gunfire at them with the intent to commit their qatl-i-amd.
Consequently, the deceased was hit by the appellant's gunfire,
while the complainant fortunately escaped unhurt. Following the
incident, the accused immediately fled the scene. When the
complainant attended to his brother, he succumbed to his injuries

on the spot.

7. The FIR does not mention that following the assailants’
gunfire, the complainant took shelter in a nearby house. However,
when asked, he replied to have taken shelter in a house situated 28
to 30 feet away from the spot. Under cross-examination, the
complainant asserted that he had pointed out this house to the I.O.
during the spot inspection. While reviewing the site plan (Ex.PB),
Page - 4 - of 11

nothing was found regarding the existence of the mentioned house
near the spot, nor did it indicate that the complainant had taken
shelter anywhere. Furthermore, both the complainant and the I.O.
provided conflicting statements, with the latter asserting that there
was no place of shelter near the spot. PW-03, Qamar Zaman
Khan, the report's scribe, also affirmed the absence of any shelter
near the spot. The I.O. denied the complainant disclosing any
shelter during the spot inspection. In light of these circumstances,
the eyewitness account is not only inconsistent with the details in
the FIR, but also contradicts the information presented in the site
plan and the statements of the scribe and the J.O. This aspect of
the case raises questions about the credibility of the complainant's
account. The lack of mention of seeking shelter in the FIR,
coupled with discrepancies between the complainant's version and
the site plan, creates miracle regarding the truthfulness of the

events so described.

8. The prosecution asserts that all three assailants
simultaneously discharged firearms at the complainant from a
short proximity of 40 feet, with the only intent to commit his
murder. However, he remained unhurt given that he took shelter
in a house after covering a distance of about 28 to 30 feet. This is
particularly noteworthy considering the complainant was
unarmed, and the site plan does not indicate any obstruction
between him and the assailants. The record indicates open fields,
where the likelihood of escaping unhurt under such circumstances
is nothing short of a miraculous which raises doubt qua the

prosecution’s narrative.

9. According to the site plan Ex.PB, there existed bushes
between the complainant and the assailants. The J.O. admitted
that the assailants could easily conceal themselves in the bushes,
rendering them invisible from point #2, where the complainant
asserted his presence. This aspect casts doubt qua the

complainant's ability to exactly identify the appellant as the only
Page - 5 - of 11

assailant responsible for firing at the deceased, given the potential

impediment posed by the bushes.

10. The complainant stated that the I.O. arrived at the spot 30
minutes after the occurrence, a claim inconsistent with the
established timeline of the events. The occurrence took place at
08:00 hours, the report was lodged at 08:15 hours, and the FIR’s
registered at 09:05 hours. The I.O. said that he received the FIR
copy within 30 minutes of its registration and reached to the spot
within 15 to 20 minutes, suggesting his, arrival at around 09:50
hours. This discrepancy raises doubts regarding the complainant's
presence at the scene at the relevant time, as the disclosed timings
do not align with the documented sequence of the events.
Additionally, the complainant promptly reported the occurrence
to the local police within 15 minutes. The inquest report (ExPW-
3/3) was prepared at the scene, but in the identification column,
Hafeez Ullah and Rafi Ullah identified the deceased, not the
complainant. While it's not mandatory for the complainant to be
the identifier of the dead body in every case, the circumstances in
this case are peculiar. As noted above, the presence of the
complainant is otherwise doubtful. This omission when
considered conjointly would raise further concerns about his
presence at the scene. PW-09 Hafeez Ullah, the identifier, is the
complainant's brother-in-law from a different village, located 18
to 20 kilometers away from the spot, reached the spot and
identified the dead body of the deceased before the scribe. He
claimed his presence at the complainant's house on the day of the
incident, but didn't disclose the purpose of his visit. He also never
informed the I.O. about visiting the complainant's house that day.
The witness failed to explain convincingly why he was at the
complainant's house when, usually, male relatives avoid sitting at
home when other males are out. Considering the local customs
and traditions, along with the peculiar facts and circumstances as
aforesaid, it can be inferred that the witness arrived from his
village upon learning about the death of the deceased, and the

complainant may not have been present at the scene at the
Page - 6 - of 11

relevant time, and for this reason, the dead body was not
identified by the complainant. The scribe Qamar Zaman Khan
(PW-03), openly acknowledged that he first inspected the
deceased's body and subsequently drafted the complainant's report
at the spot. He also admitted to have noticed the crime empties at
the spot, but explained that he left them for the I.O. to collect.
This admission raises concerns, as it suggests that the report was
lodged after the preliminary investigation, a procedural misstep
that has consistently been deemed detrimental to the prosecution's
case. Legal precedents, such as Muhammad Zahir Shah v. Amin-
ur-Rehman (2023 YLR 2023 Peshawar), Sajid v. State (2023
PCrLJ 19 Peshawar), Muhammad Sheeraz v. State (2021
PCrLJN 26 Peshawar), and Naeem Gulzar _v. State (2021

PCrLJ 1586 Lahore), underscore the potential adverse impact of

such a lapse in the prosecution's case.

11. Constable Muhammad Shabir, examined as PW-05,
testified that he escorted the dead body of the deceased to the
hospital in a private vehicle, accompanied by 2/3 private persons.
Notably, the witness did not speak about the presence of the
complainant at the spot. If the complainant had indeed been
present with the deceased, it would be expected for him to
accompany the dead body of his real brother to the hospital.
However, he claimed to have stayed at the spot while the
deceased was taken to the hospital, which appears unnatural given
the closest relationship between them. This is yet another
circumstance which raises doubt qua the presence of the

complainant.

12. The circumstances surrounding the instant case
unequivocally suggest that the complainant was not present at the
time of the occurrence and, thus, he failed to establish his
presence at the spot through convincing evidence. Hence, when
the complainant, as the solitary eyewitness, has failed to establish
his presence at the time of the occurrence, and the collected

evidence also lacks the requisite standard to reasonably link the
Page - 7 - of 11

appellant with the alleged offence, then, the benefit of the doubt
would lean in his favour. This perspective is supported by a
notable judgment from the Supreme Court in the case of Khalid

Mehmood and another Vs The State and another (2021 SCMR

810), wherein it was observed:

All the circumstances highlighted above lead us to a
definite conclusion that the presence of eye-witnesses at
the place of occurrence at the relevant time is not above
board and prosecution has failed to prove its case against
the petitioner beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, the
instant jail petition is converted into an appeal and the
same is hereby allowed. The conviction and sentence of
appellant Khalid Mehmood is set aside. He is acquitted
of the charge framed against him. He is behind the bars
and is ordered to be released forthwith, if not required to
be detained in any other case.

13. A similar view was also expressed in Najaf Ali Shah Vs the
State (2021 SCMR 736), which reads:

The same view was reiterated in Abdul Jabbar v.
State (2010 SCMR 129) when this court observed
that once a single loophole is observed in a case
presented by the prosecution, such as conflict in the
ocular account and medical evidence or presence of
eye-witnesses being doubtful, the benefit of such
loophole/lacuna in the prosecution's case
automatically goes in favour of an accused.

14. Moreover, the scribe arrived at the spot within 15 minutes
of the occurrence. He stated to have found the deceased with the
head and feet tied with cloth. However, the absence of nearby
houses and the lack of blood on the complainant's clothes or
hands raise significant questions as to who could have executed
such actions in such a short time. These questions, however,
remain unanswered, which cast doubt on the mode and manner of
the occurrence. Legal precedents, as exemplified in cases like
Jawad v. The State and another (2020 YLR 1462) and Jalat Khan
alias Jalo vy. The State (2020 PCr.LJ 503) establish that when

serious inconsistencies and contradictions exist in the
prosecution's evidence, and it is found that the occurrence did not

unfold in the manner as described, the benefit should be resolved
Page - 8 - of 11

in favour of the accused. The. High Court of Balochistan
unequivocally affirmed and reiterated the impact of such position
in the case of Rafaat Shah Vs The State (2022 PCr.LJ Note 39

Balochistan). It reads:

The mode and manner of the occurrence itself by the
prosecution is not appealable to the prudent mined,
therefore, it was highly unsafe to rely on the statement
of both these witnesses to maintain conviction and
sentence of the accused on a capital charge.

15. Examining the medical evidence, it is revealed that the
autopsy on the dead body of the deceased was conducted by PW-
07 Dr. Hamid Farman, M.O. According to the ocular account and
the site plan, the deceased was allegedly shot from the left side.
However, discrepancies arise as the post-mortem report indicates
that the most of the injuries were received by the deceased from
the right side, suggesting a contradiction in the direction of the
gunshots. The complainant asserts that he attended to his brother
immediately after the incident, but he succumbed to his injuries
on the spot. It implies that according to the ocular account, the
deceased died instantaneously. This conflicts with the post-
mortem report, which states a probable duration of 30 minutes to
01 hour between the injuries and the deceased's death. In the
nutshell, the medical evidence contradicts both the ocular account
and the site plan, raising questions as to the truthfulness of the
reported events. The ocular account is, therefore, disbelieved in
line with the law laid down by this Court in Mehboob alias Booba
v. The State and others (2014 YLR 989 Peshawar), wherein it

was held:

It is settled that in the event of variation in ocular and
medical evidence, ocular evidence has to be believed,
but when the ocular account itself is inconsistent,
contradictory and not confidence inspiring, then no
reliance could be placed there-upon.

16. Turning to the circumstantial evidence, it transpires that
during the spot inspection, the I.O. collected 05 crime empties of

30 bore and bloodstained earth from the spot, subsequently sent to
Page -9-of 11

the FSL for analysis. The FSL reports indicate that the crime
empties were discharged from different 30 bore weapons, and the
bloodstained earth was found as of human, belonging to the same
blood group. The circumstantial evidence strongly supports the
prosecution's case, although it alone is not sufficient to sustain a
conviction for two primary reasons. Firstly, the evidentiary value
of circumstantial evidence is considered in favour of the
prosecution when the ocular account is reliable and inspires
confidence, which is not the case before us. The lack of
confidence in the ocular account diminishes the strength of the
circumstantial evidence. Secondly, while the circumstantial
evidence establishes a connection to the crime, it fails to explicitly
identify the accused charged as the actual perpetrator.
Consequently, the circumstantial evidence in the present case
does not contribute significantly to the proof of the charge against

the appellant.

17. Regarding the alleged motive, the complainant asserted a
dispute over a pathway wall between the parties. The I.0.
acknowledged the complainant's failure to provide any evidence
supporting the alleged motive. Additionally, the 1.0. conceded to
have not collected any evidence to substantiate the alleged
motive. Consequently, the prosecution failed in establishing the
motive, and in such circumstances, the burden falls on the
prosecution. While the absence of a motive does not always
decisively undermine the prosecution's case, it is a perfect legal
obligation of the prosecution to prove what it alleged as motive.
In the instant case, the motive served as the sole link between the
parties, and the failure to establish it significantly undermines the
foundation of the prosecution's case. We affirm that the
prosecution did not succeed in establishing the motive, and it is
the prosecution that must bear the consequences of this failure. In
this context, guidance can be sought from the Supreme Court's
judgment in Muhammad Akram alias Akrami Vs. The State (2019
SCMR 610), where it observed:
Page - 10 - of 11

We are of the view that the motive set out by the
prosecution remained far from being proved. It is well
settled that when prosecution alleges something against
an accused person and then fails to prove the same, the
premium of such failure must go to an accused person.
In this case as well, prosecution's failure to prove the
motive set out by it certainly benefits the appellant.

18. Insofar as the abscondence is concerned, it revealed that
the appellant remained absconder for more than a year without
providing any explanation. However, it is crucial to note that
abscondence alone does not serve as a conclusive proof of guilt.
While it can be considered as a corroborative piece of evidence,
its weight is contingent on the prior establishment of an accused
person's guilt through compelling evidence. As articulated in the
case of Rafagat Ullah_alias Paka v. Umar Fayaz (deceased)
through _ brother __Muhammad_ Riaz (2020 PCr.LJ 1361

Peshawar), when direct evidence falls short, abscondence as a
piece of evidence becomes inconsequential. The present case is

no exception to this principle.

19. On reappraisal of the evidence presented, it is abundantly
clear that the prosecution's case is riddled with uncertainties,
doubts, and inconsistencies. No substantive evidence exists to
firmly link the appellant to the commission of the offence beyond
any reasonable doubt. A fundamental principle of criminal
jurisprudence dictates that any doubt that raises questions in the
judicial mind must be resolved in favour of the accused, and the
burden of proof invariably rests on the prosecution to establish its
case beyond a reasonable doubt. Furthermore, numerous
circumstances are not required to cast doubt upon the guilt of an
accused; even a solitary factor that creates a reasonable doubt in
the mind of a prudent person is sufficient to benefit the accused.
Noteworthy legal precedents supporting this perspective include,
but not limited to, Ayub Masih v. The State (PLD 2002 SC 1048)
and Tarig Pervaiz v. The State (1995 SCMR 1345).

20. For these reasons, we allow this appeal, acquit the

appellant by setting aside the impugned judgment, dated
Page - 11-of11
06.12.2022, and order his release, with the caveat that his
detention is not otherwise required.

21. As the instant criminal appeal ended in acquittal, therefore,
the connected Criminal Appeal #11-B/2023 becomes infructuous.

It is, therefore, dismissed.

22. The foregoing are the reasons for our short order of even

date.
