bullets besides 70 open bullets (total 150) were recovered; from
another bag available there two hand grenades were also
found; all were taken into possession vide independent
inventories (PA & PC).

4. Above mentioned complaint (PA) was sent to Police
Station ‘Kehror Pacca’ through Muhammad Arshad Constable
on the basis whereof FIR” (PA/1) was recorded by Ikram Ullah
HC (Pw-1) under Section 4 of the Explosive Substances Act,
1908 (ESA), read with Section 7 of the Anti Terrorism Act,
1997 (Act) and Section 13(2)(c) of the Arms Ordinance, 1965
(Ordinance).

5. The case was investigated by Nazar Muhammad
Inspector (Pw-7) who on 28.02.2016 also arrested Muhammad
Rizwan (appellant) and on conclusion thereof submitted the
report under Section 173 Cr.P.C (Challan) in court showing
Muhammad Bilal as a Proclaimed Offender.

6. A charge under Section 4 of ESA read with Section
13(2)(c) of the Ordinance and Section 7 of the Act framed
against appellants, on 28.06.2016, was not pleaded guilty by
them and they demanded the trial.

7. In support of its case, prosecution had produced Ikram
Ullah HC/author of FIR and Moharrar” (Pw-1), Zafar Iqbal
Constable/parcels depositor (Pw-2), Muzaffar Hussain HC/
eyewitness (Pw-3), Muhammad Iqbal Pasha/Bomb Disposal

from the hand grenades for sampling (Pw-8).

8. | Muhammad Rasheed Constable was given up being
unnecessary by the learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor
who after producing the reports of PFSA’? (PK & PR) had
closed the prosecution’s case.

9. Both the appellants were called for their examinations
under Section 342 Cr.P.C and their common version was as
under: -

“Three years ago Muhammad Ajmal brother
of Dost Muhammad was murdered and FIR
was lodged against my uncle Mosa, in this way
my cousin Manzoor Ahmed murdered the
accused party, there were close relations with
ruling group, due to the circumstances, I along
with my family reside in Karachi. My
grandmother died and I came here to attend
the funeral ceremony of my grandmother.
Magbool SI with the connivance of rival group
lodged the fake FIR. The alleged place of
occurrence is in the populated area but no
private person was associated in the
investigation. All the witnesses are police
officials, are subordinates to Magqbool SI
complainant of the FIR”

10. Both the appellants opted not to appear in terms of
Section 340(2) Cr.PC in disproof of the allegations against
them or to produce any defence evidence.

11. We have heard both the sides and with their valuable
assistance we have also gone through the record of learned
trial court.

12. For further clarification of the facts, it will not be out of
context to refer here that on the same day of occurrence
(16.02.2016) the hand grenades were defused by Muhammad
Iqbal Pasha Bomb Disposal Commander/BDC (Pw-4) while

8 Punjab Forensic Science Agency
Criminal Appeal No.907 of 2017 5
Muhammad Hamza & another_vs. The State & another

arriving at Police Station who also on 26.03.2016 after one
month and ten days of the occurrence again visited the Police
Station, placed the hand grenades in two small wooden boxes
and made those into sealed parcels. It was then on 05.04.2016
after 8 days when Nazar Muhammad Inspector (Pw-7) had
taken both the parcels to Zafar Ali/BDC (Pw-8) at Civil
Defence Directorate, Lahore who collected 3 grams explosive
material from each hand grenade as sample and those were
taken into possession vide a recovery memo (PD).

13. We have observed that the prosecution’s case is filled up
with serious infirmities, contradictions and inherent defects but
with no logical, plausible or convincing responses by the
prosecution.

14. Although in cross-examination of Muzaffar Hussain HC
(Pw-3), Maqbool Hussain SI (Pw-6) and Nazar Muhammad
Inspector (Pw-7), one can gather the time of occurrence around
10:00 am but the careful perusal of complaint (PA) shows that
it is deficient that at what time the police party was present at
crime scene? When they arrived there? What was the time
when the secret information was received? And at what time
the jeep arrived at place of occurrence? Even at the end of
complaint against the word <4: no time has been recorded.
The FIR (PA/1) too does not speak that what the time of
occurrence was where against the words © s89 G49 9 QU it
was simply written as jg). Even in the examination in chief
of the earlier referred witnesses these details are completely
missing.

15. This is the case of prosecution that secret information
was received about three persons with their complete details as
Bilal Ahmed son of Ahmad Baksh alias Natthu caste Phol,

Muhammad Rizwan son of Riaz alias Kala caste Phol and
Criminal Appeal No.907 of 2017 6
Muhammad Hamza & another_vs. The State & another

Muhammad Hamza son of Tariq caste Phol and all residents of
‘Shah Pur Phol’. According to the witnesses this information
they had received 10 minutes earlier to arrival of the jeep. It is
not the case of Muzaffar Hussain HC (Pw-3) or Maqbool
Hussain SI (Pw-6) or Nazar Muhammad Inspector (Pw-7) that
after apprehending Muhammad Hamza at spot he was the one
who disclosed about his companions/associates named
Muhammad Bilal and Muhammad Rizwan. In_ these
circumstances, it was the fundamental duty of the prosecution
to establish that how the witnesses came to know that the
persons escaped from crime scene were Muhammad Bilal and
Muhammad Rizwan? In absence of any material in this
context, prosecution’s case on the face of it has become
doubtful.

16. Muhammad Rizwan (appellant) was arrested on
28.02.2016 by Nazar Muhammad Inspector (Pw-7) and
he/Nazar Muhammad too never stated that he came to know
about Muhammad Rizwan on the disclosure of Muhammad
Hamza.

17. The police party was comprised of seven members with
official weapons and vehicle also. The crime scene, as evident
from cross examination of the witnesses and the rough site
plan, was surrounded by almost open area so in presence of
police force escape of two assailants who while running were
not in possession of any weapon is a highly unnatural story
and cannot be accepted by a prudent and wise mind.

18. Muhammad Iqbal Pasha/BDC (Pw-4) in his examination
in chief stated that on 16.02.2016 he was summoned at Police
Station by SHO” city ‘Karor Pacca’ for defusing the hand

grenades where he arrived and performed the obligations on

‘* Station House Officer
Criminal Appeal No.907 of 2017 7
Muhammad Hamza & another_vs. The State & another

his part. In cross examination, he replied that he met Moharrar
of the Police Station who handed over to him the hand
grenades for defusing and that he did not meet any other police
officer there. When the statement of Ikram Ullah HC/Moharrar
is perused, he was completely silent about the visit of
Muhammad Iqbal Pasha/BDC (Pw-4) in the Police Station on
16.02.2016.

19. Muhammad Iqbal Pasha/BDC (Pw-4) in his examination
in chief further maintained that on 26.03.2016 he was again
summoned in the Police Station where he reached and
prepared parcels of hand grenades in two small wooden boxes
for onward transmission to the office of PFSA. Even in this
respect, Ikram Ullah HC/Moharrar was silent as he did not say
a single word on the basis whereof even it may be presumed
that on 26.03.2016 Muhammad Iqbal Pasha came to Police
Station for this assignment. In this view of the matter,
statement of Nazar Muhammad Inspector (Pw-7) that on
26.03.2016 at his request Muhammad Iqbal Pasha/BDC made
the sealed parcels of hand grenades is of no worth for the
prosecution.

20. It is not understandable that if on 16.02.2016
Muhammad Iqbal Pasha/BDC had defused the hand grenades
while coming to Police Station, why on the same day he did
not make those into sealed parcels and why this exercise was
deferred till 26.03.2016?

21. Muhammad Nazar Inspector in his examination in chief
claimed that on 05.04.2016, he received the parcels of hand
grenades from Moharrar of Police station which he had taken
to Civil Defence Office, Lahore where Zafar Ali/BDC (Pw-8)
separated the explosive material from each hand grenade for

expert opinion. Again the statement of Ikram Ullah
Criminal Appeal No.907 of 2017 8
Muhammad Hamza & another_vs. The State & another

HC/Moharrar (Pw-1) is short of any evidence that on
05.04.2016 he handed over the parcels of hand grenades to
Nazar Muhammad Inspector.

22. Nazar Muhammad Inspector (Pw-7) in his examination in
chief further added that after the collection of explosive
material through sealed parcels, he handed over the same to
Ameer Baksh Constable (Pw-5) who deposited the same in the
office of PFSA, Lahore. The report of PFSA (PL) has negated
his version as according to this document he was not Ameer
Baksh Constable but Nazar Muhammad Inspector who had
submitted the parcels in that office on 05.04.2016. It will not
be irrelevant to add here that Ameer Baksh Constable (Pw-5) in
his examination in chief never maintained about receiving of
any parcel of sample of explosive material on 05.04.2016 and
deposited thereof in the office of PFSA. His statement was
only to the extent that in his presence explosive material was
taken into possession vides a recovery memo (PD).

23. Zafar Iqbal Constable No. 220 (Pw-2) in his examination
in chief stated about receiving of parcels of Kalashnikov and
bullets which he had deposited in the office of PFSA on
29.02.2016. He is the same official who has also been shown
as an eyewitness and present at the time of occurrence on
16.02.2016 but in his examination in chief he did not bring out
from his mouth even a single word in this regard which has
finally smashed the prosecution’s case.

24. The principles of ‘safe custody’ and ‘chain of safe
custody’ do not confine to any specific case or situation but in
every case where prosecution demands conviction against an
offender on the basis of any material that constitutes an
offence like hand grenade as in the case in hand, bombs,

explosive materials, narcotics, arms and ammunitions etc.
Criminal Appeal No.907 of 2017 9
Muhammad Hamza & another_vs. The State & another

these principles shall be strictly adhered to and cannot be
compromised under any circumstance. There is a difference
between ‘safe custody’ and ‘chain safe custody’. ‘Safe
custody’ means, if the case property is with any
official/individual that has to be in accordance and under an
authority of law or at a secured place like ‘Malkhana’ where
access has to be under a specified procedure and law. Whereas
‘chain of safe custody’ means that if case property is
transferred or transmitted from one place to other place or
from one official to other official, such transmission has also
to be under a recognized method. Therefore, prosecution has to
establish and prove both ‘safe custody’ and ‘chain of safe
custody’ side by side and if any of the links of chain is broken
the conviction cannot be recorded or if recorded cannot
ordered to be sustained.

25. The discussions made earlier therefore have made it
clear that in the case in hand ‘safe custody’ and ‘chain of safe
custody’ both are under heavy clouds of doubts which are the
ultimate adverse blows for the prosecution.

26. We have gone through the impugned judgment and we
have noticed that the learned trial court blindly followed the
prosecution’s story without making proper appreciation of
evidence which is the soul of a good judgment. While deciding
the criminal case finally it is the primary duty of the court that
judgment must contain the point or points for determination,
the decision thereon and the reasons for the decision.
Appreciation of evidence which may be direct or
circumstantial is a delicate exercise that involves weighing the
credibility and reliability of the incriminating material
presented in a case and on conclusion thereof it must present a

good picture that has to be accurate on all counts, with good
Criminal Appeal No.907 of 2017 10
Muhammad Hamza & another_vs. The State & another

composition, exposure, focus, light, and timing. In a criminal
case as the question of life and liberty of an accused is at stake
therefore under the settled principles of law a strict standard of
proof is required so as to prove the guilt which cannot base on
preponderance of probabilities but it must be proved beyond
reasonable doubt. The words ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ mean
that the prosecution must convince the court that there is no
other reasonable outcome of the evidence produced in trial
except the conviction of accused.

27. The prosecution case presented in the court must be true.
There is also a difference between the words ‘may be true’ and
‘must be true’ and between these two phrases there is a long
distance that has to be covered by legal, reliable and
unimpeachable evidence. So for seeking the conviction against
an accused prosecution evidence ‘must be true’.

28. The golden principles to hold the accused responsible
for a crime can be formulated as under: -

i. Conviction cannot be based merely on the
high probabilities that may be inferred
from evidence in a given case.

ii. Finding of the guilt should rest surely and
firmly on the evidence produced by the
prosecution.

iii. Mere conjectures and probabilities cannot
take the place of legal proof otherwise the
golden rule of benefit of doubt will be
reduced to naught.

iv. Accused is only to create doubt in
prosecution’s case.

v. It is the duty of prosecution to prove its
case beyond reasonable doubt.

vi. Benefit of every reasonable doubt must go
to the accused.

vii. Benefit of doubt however slight must go to
the accused.

viii. Single infirmity in prosecution's case will
entitle the accused to benefit of doubt.

ix. Court is not supposed to thumb mark
blindly what the prosecution has desired.
Criminal Appeal No.907 of 2017 11
Muhammad Hamza & another_vs. The State & another

x. Rule of law is the supreme consideration
and nothing is top to it. A Judge is only to
be impressed when “burden of persuasion”
is successfully discharged which means to
convince the court that qualitative evidence
is there.

29. In the light of what has been discussed, deliberated and
analyzed above, the ultimate declaration of this Court is that
prosecution had badly failed to prove its case beyond
reasonable doubt against Muhammad Rizwan and Muhammad
Hamza (appellants) hence this criminal appeal is allowed.
Impugned judgment is set_aside. Both the appellants are
acquitted from the case. They are in custody and shall be
released forthwith if not required in any other case. The case
property shall be dealt with in the same manners as directed by

the learned trial court.
