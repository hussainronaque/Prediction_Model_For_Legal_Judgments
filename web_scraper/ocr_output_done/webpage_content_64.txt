Syed
Muhammad Farooq Shah J:      This
order shall culminate both captioned bail applications arising from the same
crime/incident. The applicants presently confined in Central Prison, Karachi
have sought their bail in case Crime No. 89/2013, for an offence punishable under
section 149, 324, 392, 385, 427, 435 and 452 PPC, registered at P.I.B. Colony
Police Station, Karachi. 
2.         Succinct
prosecution story as narrated in the FIR lodged by the Complainant is that
there is civil litigation in between the Complainant and applicants/accused
persons and others on a plot and some of the applicants have constructed shops
over there. It is alleged that the above persons extended threats to
Complainant to withdraw the above civil suit and in this respect he has
reported the matter to the concerned Police Station. That on 01.05.2013 at
about 9:00 am when the Complainant was sleeping at his house, his nephew Ali
Hassan and Ali Hyder came in injured condition and disclosed to the Complainant
that the applicants alongwith their wives and around 100/150 persons armed with
hatchets and iron rods attacked and injured them. Complainant saw that his
Government car No. GS-224 Toyota Corolla was set on the fire by the culprits.
The Complainant’s family informed to helpline police about the incident but the
culprits including women broke upon the central door of house of the
Complainant and robbed precious household articles. It is alleged that police
came alongwith rangers, arrested the culprits on pointation of complainant and thereafter
the Complainant lodged FIR. The investigation was carried out by SIO Inspector
Abdul Waheed and from the place of occurrence he recovered empties of used
bullets. Contents of charge sheet reveals that the names of ladies those have
participated in the commission of alleged offence alongwith men have not been
included as accused in any column of charge sheet. Earlier bail applications
filed by the applicants were dismissed by an order dated 15.06.2013 by learned
trial Court. Hence the instant bail application.  
3.         Learned
Counsel for the applicants/accused at the very outset submitted that the
applicants have falsely been implicated in this case due to animosity over the
piece of land occupied by the Complainant. It is next contended that no incriminating
article was recovered from the possession of the applicants, including stolen/
snatched property or the alleged weapons used in the crime. Learned Counsel
further submitted that no specific role to the applicants/accused is assigned by
the Complainant in the alleged FIR; that it was a day light incident in a
thickly populated area but no independent person of locality was examined and
that the evidence of Complainant is heresy. It is next argued that vide order
dated 01.08.2013 and 02.07.2013, co-accused Sultan, Khan Muhammad and Ghani to
whom identical role in commission of offence was assigned have already been
granted bail by the trial Court, therefore, keeping in view the rule of
consistency, the present applicants are also entitled for similar relief.
Learned Counsel submitted that there is long standing dispute in between the
parties and earlier the case against co-accused sultan and Hashim viz FIR No.
205/2007 was registered at P.S. Korangi and they were acquitted under section
249(A) Cr.P.C, by an order dated 18.06.2009. In support of his contention,
learned Counsel placed his reliance on the case of Gul Bahar and another
v/s The State 2011 P Cr. L J 985, Adrees Ahmed and others v/s
Zafar Ali and another 2010 SCMR 64, Subeh Sadiq alias Saabo alias
Kalu v/s The State and others 2011 SCMR 1543, Ganhwar Bhutto v/s
The State 2011 MLD 210, Zulfiqar alias Badna v/s The State 2012
YLR 1421, Dr. Abdul Jabbar v/s The State 2012 YLR 788,
Saqib v/s The State 2012 YLR 1417, Abdul Razzak alias Zeeshan and
another v/s The State 2012 MLD 1789 and Sanwan v/s The State 2012
MLD 1956. 
4.         Conversely,
learned Counsel for the Complainant duly assisted by learned Prosecutor
submitted that the applicants are dangerous criminals and their case falls
under section 6 and 7 ATA 1997 but the learned ATC Court while passing an order
dated 02.05.2013 on remand report has seriously erred that case does not fall within
the ambits of section 6 and 7 ATA 1997 and directed the concerned police to
seek the remand of case from the Court having jurisdiction. It is an admitted
position that now the trial is pending before the Court of ordinary
jurisdiction. At this juncture, learned advocate for the Complainant submits
that against the order dated 02.05.2013, passed by Judge ATC-I (East) Karachi,
the complainant has filed a writ petition before this Court. Learned Counsel
for the complainant placed his reliance on the cases of Tariq Bashir and
5 others v/s The State PLD 1995 SC 34, Imtiaz Ahmed and another
v/s The State PLD 1997 SC 545 and WAPDA and others v/s Qari
Muhammad Feroze and others 2011 PLC (C.S) 950.
5.         Arguments
heard and considered. Record perused. 
6.         A
perusal of contents of the FIR reveals that no specific allegation or specific role
in commission of the offence has assigned to the applicants, particularly, no incriminating
article including crime weapons or robbed articles have been recovered from
their possession. Citations relied upon by learned Counsel for the Complainant
are not attracting in the circumstances of the present case as it is settled
law that each case is to be decided in view of its peculiar facts and
circumstances. Admittedly, three accused to whom identical role in commission
of offence is assigned have already been enlarged on bail, therefore, keeping
in view rule of consistency, the case thus warrants further inquiry. Moreso, a
tentative assessment of record demonstrate that no specific role in commission
of offence is assigned to them and police did not record statement of any
independent person or inhabitant of the locality; evidence of complainant is
heresay, therefore, keeping in view the principle governing the administration
of criminal justice and in light of the case law relied upon by learned Counsel
for the applicants/accused, squarely applicable in this case, the applicants
are admitted to bail subject to their furnishing solvent surety in the sum of
Rs. 100,000/- each and PR Bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial
Court.                                                                                                                                                                                                 7.         It
need not to emphasize that the observation made above are tentative in nature,
shall not influence the trial court.
