4. Appellants on the strength of their appeal have
challenged their conviction whereas, complainant pursuant
to PSLA has called in question the acquittal of accused and
he, by way of criminal revision, has also desired
enhancement of sentences awarded to appellants.

5. The above decision is outcome of a private complaint
instituted by Ahmad Bakhsh/complainant (Pw-1). It is
important to mention here that with regard to same
occurrence by same complainant FIR” No.86 (PB) was
registered on 03.03.2010 under Sections 302/324/148/149
PPC at Police Station Noor Muhammad district Rajanpur
and the record shows that both the state and complaint cases
were consolidated.

6. In complaint, filed on 03.05.2010 after two months of
the FIR, complainant asserted that on 03.03.2010 he came to
know that Sabaz Ali (accused) who was occupying
his/complainant’s house, after sale, wanted to transfer its

possession to some other person; he along with Habib Ullah,

Sadiq & another vs. The State & another ~

Ramzan (Pw-2), Hafeez, Abdul Rahim (brothers), Shamim,
Izzat Mai and Kalsoom Mai arrived at the house of Sabaz
Ali on a vehicle; when he called Sabaz Ali etc. and asked
about shifting of house and also desired its possession, at
that occasion Sadiq (appellant) armed with 12-bore pistol,
Sabaz Ali (accused) in possession of gun, Akbar alias Koroo
(accused) equipped with 12-bore gun, Hazoor Bakhsh
(accused) in possession of 30-bore pistol, Hanif (accused)
having a revolver and Ghulam Muhammad alias Pakkhi
(appellant) with a hatchet came there; they raised a Lalkara®
where after Sadiq (appellant) fired a shot that hit on the right
side of chest of Habib Ullah; Akbar alias Koroo made a fire
and the pallets hit on the head and left thigh of Hafeez; the
fire made by Hanif hit on the right thigh of Abdul Raheem
and subsequent thereto Ghulam Muhammad alias Pakkhi
gave an injury on the back side of head and back of Ramzan;
Sabaz Ali made a fire with 12-bore gun which hit on
his/complainant’s right ear and left chest; Hazoor Bakhsh
had been firing with 12-bore pistol but none of the fires hit
anyone; Habib Ullah died at the spot; on hue and cry of the
females, appellants and accused stopped firing who then
escaped from crime scene.

7. The ultimate version of complainant was that,
although police registered the case and got his thumb
impression but the statement was not read over to him and
that Ghulam Fareed Sub Inspector (Cw-5) also recorded
incorrect statements of the witnesses.

8. On issuance of processes, appellants and the accused
turned up to face trial. On 10.02.2011, a charge’ was framed
against all accused except Akbar alias Koroo. When Challan
to his extent was also submitted, an amended charge was

framed on 01.10.2012 against all of them under Sections

12. After the prosecution’s evidence was closed,

appellants and accused were called for their examinations
Crl. Appeal No. 161 of 2013 5
Sadiq & another vs. The State & another

under Section 342 Cr.P.C. To the question that why this case
was against him, version of Sadiq (appellant) was as under: -

“Tam innocent. I am student. On 03.03.2010
at 09:00 am, I along with women folk of my
family was present at my _ house.
Complainant along with 20/30 persons
armed with deadly weapons launched attack
on us to get the possession of our house. The
complainant along with his companions
entered in our house from northern and
southern outer gates of our house and
started indiscriminate firing upon me and
other family members. We saved our lives by
concealing ourselves in rooms. Due to the
above said indiscriminate firing, Habib
Ullah deceased expired as he received
firearm injury on his back from close range.
Muhammad Bux, Abdul Rahim and Hafeez
sustained injuries as a result of above said
indiscriminate firing. On arrival of
inhabitants of the locality, the complainant
party fled away. Sabaz Ali, Hazoor Bux,
Akbar alias Koroo and Hanif were not
present at the place of occurrence as they
had proceeded to Rajanpur early in the
morning to appear in the court of Mr.
Khaliq Ishaque, learned Magistrate Section
30, Rajanpur in criminal cases pending
there. In the absence of my brothers and
nephew, complainant party launched attacks
to get possession of house and land owned
by Provincial Government. My father got
constructed the house wherein we are
residing. The complainant party also wanted
to abduct my wife Mst. Fatima daughter of
Sajjad Dhandla. My father had been
cultivating the above said land since 1991.
There was civil as well as criminal litigation
inter se the parties with regard to above said
land and house. Under the said grudge, we
have been falsely involved in this case.”

13. Same version was of Ghulam Muhammad _ alias
Pakkhi (appellant).

14. The learned trial court did not believe the
prosecution’s version by holding that in fact complainant
party lunched the attack to take possession of disputed
property where only appellants were present and they acted

in self defence but exceeded hence both were convicted.
Crl. Appeal No. 161 of 2013 6
Sadiq & another vs. The State & another

15. Learned counsel for appellants maintains that the
learned trial court once disbelieved the prosecutions’ story,
there was no question for scrutinizing and analyzing the
defence plea which has to be accepted in totality without
making any pick and choose hence conviction of appellants
cannot sustain.

16. On the other hand, learned ADPP argued that the
learned trial court made correct analysis of material
produced in this case and by sifting the grain from the chaff
rightly came to a view that appellants although acted in self
defence but they exceeded that right therefore, rightly
convicted Sadiq under Sections 302(c)/324 PPC and Ghulam
Muhammad alias Pakkhi under Section 324 PPC.

17. HEARD

18. Before the prosecution’s evidence and defence plea is
discussed in the light of material produced in this case, I will
like to respond on the contention of learned ADPP that as
Muhammad Bakhsh (Pw-1) and Ramzan (Pw-2) are the
injured witnesses so, on this ground alone their reliability
and credibility cannot be taken to any exception. This is not
the absolute position under the law. No doubt that presence
of an injured witness at crime scene cannot be disputed or
doubted because of injuries on his body® but at the same
time this recognized principle cannot be skipped that injuries
on the person of witness will not show that what he has
stated in the court that is the truth and not less than truth’
and that said injuries do not give him a stamp of truth on his
testimony'”. This principle also cannot be kept out of sight
that his testimony is to be tested and appraised on the
principles applied for appreciation of any other prosecution’s

19. As both the parties in this case have come forward with a

contrast version about one and the same occurrence,

therefore, I will also like to refer the settled principles on the

subject as recapitulated and summarized by the apex Court!”

in its latest pronouncement and those are as under: -

i.

iii.

The burden, in a criminal case, to
prove the guilt of the accused is
always on the prosecution. Therefore,
the court, in the first instance, is to
discuss and assess the prosecution
evidence, in order to arrive at the
conclusion as to whether or not the
prosecution has succeeded in proving
the charge against the accused on the
basis of its evidence.

In a case where the accused has not
taken any specific plea (e.g. self
defence, grave and sudden
provocation etc.) or has not produced
any evidence in his defence, the court
should decide the question of success
or failure of the prosecution in
proving the charge against the
accused on the basis of the
prosecution evidence alone.

In a case where the accused has
taken a specific plea or has produced
evidence in his defence, the court
should appraise the prosecution case
and the defense version § in
juxtaposition, in order to arrive at a
just conclusion. Even in such
situation the burden remains on the
prosecution to prove the necessary
ingredients of the offence charged
against the accused, and it does not
shift upon the accused merely by
taking a defence plea or producing
evidence in his defence.

The burden shifts upon the accused
under Article 121 of the QSO™ to
prove his defense plea, only when a
prima facie case is made out against
him by the prosecution on the basis of
its evidence. If the prosecution fails
to prove its case against the accused,

the question of shifting of burden on
the accused does not arise.

The primary purpose of section 342
Cr.P.C is to enable the accused to

viii.

know and to explain and respond to
the evidence brought against him by
the prosecution. A direct dialogue is
established between the Court and
the accused by putting every
important incriminating piece of
evidence to the accused and granting
him an opportunity to answer and
explain.

If the prosecution fails to prove its

case_against the accused, the court
can take into consideration the

statement of the accused under
section 342 Cr.P.C_ whether _in
favour of or against the accused; but
it_must_take into consideration that
statement in its entirety and cannot
select_and_ place _reliance_on_the
Inculpatory part of the statement
only.

In the last mentioned circumstance

the facts narrated by the accused in
his statement _under_ section 342
Cr.P.C_ are to be accepted without

requiring their proof. The court,
however, should examine the said

facts in order to give due effect to
them under the law. The object of
such examination is to determine
whether or not the facts narrated by
the accused constitute an offence
under the law or fit into any
exception of the offence provided
under the law.

An admission or confession made in
statement under section 342 Cr.P.C,
which is improbable or unbelievable,
or is not consistent with the overall
facts and circumstances of a case do
not have any probative value and
thus it cannot be relied upon by the
court for reaching a conclusion.
(Emphasized)

20. By applying the principles referred above, I proceed

to examine prosecution’s story in first instance. Since

beginning, it appears that, complainant was not fair while

setting up his case which he changed when he came in court

by filing the private complaint. What was his complaint that

has already been referred in the earlier paragraphs of this

judgment and the following comparison table will show that
Crl. Appeal No. 161 of 2013 9
Sadiq & another vs. The State & another

how complainant deviated from the original story he set up

in FIR: -

Complaint

FIR

Sadiq fired a shot that hit
on the right side of chest of
Habib Ullah.

Akbar alias Koroo made a
fire and the pallets hit on
the head and left thigh of
Hafeez.

> Sadiq made a fire that hit

on the right side of chest of
Habib Ullah.

Akbar alias Koroo, Hazoor
Bakhsh and Hanif with their
weapons made firing
causing injuries to Ramzan,

> Fire made by Hanif hit on Hafeez and Rahim.
the right thigh of Abdul
Raheem.

> Ghulam Muhammad alias
Pakkhi gave an injury on
the back side of head and
back of Ramzan.

> Sabaz Ali made a fire with
12-bore gun which hit on
complainant’s right ear and
left chest.

> Hazoor Bakhsh had been
firing with 12-bore pistol
but none of the fires hit
anyone.

21. The comparison of above two stories clearly indicates
that in FIR there was no specific allegation against any of
the accused except Sadiq (appellant) and even it was not
alleged that fire of any accused hit on the person of
complainant. So much so, Ghulam Muhammad alias Pakkhi
(appellant) although was shown armed with hatchet but no
role whatsoever in FIR for causing any injury to any person
was assigned to him.

22. Muhammad Bakhsh in complaint maintained that his
statement (Cw-5/D) was not recorded correctly and also was
not read over to him. His simple words in particular when
this is a case of capital charge cannot destroy the veracity
and authenticity of the complaint (Cw-5/D), which is a well
drafted document with his thumb impression and having the
endorsement of Ghulam Farid SI (Cw-5). If it is admitted

that complainant was lodged in hospital being injured where

Crl. Appeal No. 161 of 2013 10
Sadiq & another vs. The State & another

he remained for few days, still question remains that
immediately after discharge, what action he had taken
against Ghulam Fareed SI? There is nothing on record to
show that Muhammad Bakhsh raised his voice before any
authority, if the complaint (Cw-5/D) was not recorded in
accordance with his version. He was also completely silent
that what those circumstances were on the basis of which
Ghulam Fareed SI misused his official position and reduced
into writing a wrong statement. Complaint was filed after
two months of the occurrence so a single line statement that
Ghulam Freed SI did not record correct version of
complainant and the witnesses, was a so called and
unsuccessful attempt to defeat the most important
document/complainant of this case on the basis of which
FIR was recorded.

23. The time of the occurrence has been stated by the
witnesses as 07:30 am and by defence at 09:00 am. Even
here prosecution is under serious challenges. This is in
evidence that occurrence was over within maximum 20
minutes where after complainant and injured remained at
crime scene for 10/12 minutes and when they reached at
‘Pull Saya Wala’ Ghulam Fareed SI (Cw-5) met them. Said
place was at distance of about two miles from crime scene.
Under any circumstance keeping in view what the witnesses
had claimed, they met Ghulam Fareed SI at the most by or
before 08:30 am but the complaint (Cw-5/D) shows that it
was recorded at 09:30 am. Without wastage of time and after
preparation of necessary documents, all the injured were
sent to hospital for medical examination which was at a
distance of about 4 miles from the venue of information.
Statement of Dr. Gul Hassan (Pw-5) and medico legal
reports of Muhammad Hafeez (PC), Muhammad Bakhsh
(PD), Abdul Raheem (PE), and Muhammad Ramzan (PF)

'4 Name of a bridge
Crl. Appeal No. 161 of 2013 11
Sadiq & another vs. The State & another

show that they were examined in between 12:20 to12:30 pm.
This fact further creates doubt in prosecution’s story with
reference to meeting of complainant with Ghulam Fareed SI
at 09:30 am, immediate referring the injured to the hospital
and medical examination without wastage of time.

24. Complainant was dishonest since beginning while
giving the time of occurrence at 07:30 am and that was with
a specific purpose. On the strength of documentary evidence
(DM/1) it was proved that on 03.03.2010 Sabaz Ali, Hazoor
Bakhsh, Ghulam Akbar alias Koroo and Muhammad Hanif
were present in the court of a Magistrate as accused in a
criminal case. The said proceedings show that one Rehmat
Ullah the complainant of that case alleged that said accused
had appeared in court after commission of some offences at
‘Pull Saya Wala’ but in response thereto accused
unanimously maintained that they arrived in the court
premises at 09:00 am. Who out of two parties was correct
before the Magistrate that controversy is not relevant for this
Court but one fact is established that said accused were
present in the court of Magistrate at 09:00 am, which venue
was far and far away from the crime scene. How was it
possible for them to be present in the court if they had
committed the crime which has not been proved at 07:30 am
but much later thereto?

25. The plea of alibi Sabaz Ali, Akbar alias Koroo,
Hazoor Bakhsh and Hanif was successfully established by
them during the investigation, which they had taken at the
first available opportunity. It was verified by Ghulam Fareed
SI (Cw-5) who finally declared them innocent, recommended
their discharge and that was agreed by a Magistrate. As the
value of investigation made by the first Investigating Officer
is of worth, therefore, the investigation conducted by Shah
Alam Khan DSP (Pw-7) after more than four months

showing no level of responsibility cannot defeat the
Crl. Appeal No. 161 of 2013 12
Sadiq & another vs. The State & another

investigation made by Ghulam Fareed SI merely on the
reason that Shah Alam Khan was senior officer in rank.

26. With regard to above said four accused their acquittal
was not on the basis of doubt but on the strength of absolute
position that they were present in the court of Magistrate at
the relevant time. Said absolute position is therefore a
serious blow for prosecution that how Muhammad Bakhsh
(Pw-1) and Ramzan (Pw-2) can be believed qua the
appellants. The rule of ‘sifting the grain from chaff is no
more applicable in Pakistan as held by the Honourable
Supreme court of Pakistan'’, where it has been finally
resolved that Rule “falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus” shall
henceforth be an integral part of our jurisprudence in
criminal cases.

27. Occurrence had taken place outside the house of
Sadiq (appellant) where admittedly complainant party came
from a considerable distance on a vehicle on the dispute of
house but prosecution could not prove that complainant was
having ownership of the said property which in fact has been
established to be under the title of the government of Punjab.
In these circumstances, the view taken by the learned trial
court is quite convincing that the complainant party in fact
launched the attack at the house of accused.

28. Coming to the medical evidence, it requires no detail
discussion with regard to injuries on the witnesses and
deceased. However, as observed earlier, this piece of
evidence is a barrier for the worth of prosecution’s version
about the time of occurrence. It indicates that FIR was result
of consultation, fabrication and concoction. All injured were
examined in between 12:20 pm to 12:30 pm whereas they
were brought to hospital much earlier to that. There is also
another serious question that why the post mortem of Habib

Ullah was conducted at 05:30 pm? This delay in post

'S PLD 2019 SC 527
Crl. Appeal No. 161 of 2013 13
Sadiq & another vs. The State & another ~

mortem examination, too, has brought the case under heavy
clouds of doubts’®.

29. Coming to defence version appellants never stated
that they made any firing in exercise of their right of defence
but what they maintained that complainant and his
companions made indiscriminate firing; they/appellants and
their family members saved their lives by concealing in a
room; due to indiscriminate firing, Habib Ullah expired as
he received firearm injury on his back from close range;
Muhammad Bakhsh, Abdul Raheem and Hafeez also
sustained injuries as a result of above said indiscriminate
firing. The learned trial court only on the basis of
presumptions held that appellants made firing in exercise of
their defence which they exceeded. The learned trial court
by holding so committed serious illegality and did what it
was not supposed to do. In Razas’ case (ibid) the Apex
Court while discussing the question ‘whether reasonable
possibility of the defence plea of being true can benefit the
accused’ was pleased to observe as under: -

In Woolmington,a famous English case,
Viscount Sankey, Lord Chancellor, in his
"Golden thread" speech laid down: "While
the prosecution must prove the guilt of the
prisoner, there is no such burden laid on the
prisoner to prove his innocence and it is
sufficient for him to raise a doubt as to his
guilt; he is not bound to satisfy the jury of
his innocence. ... Throughout the web of the
English Criminal Law one golden thread is
always to be seen that it is the duty of the
prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt ...
If, at the end of and on the whole of the case,
there is a reasonable doubt, created by the
evidence given by either the prosecution or
the prisoner, as to whether the prisoner
killed the deceased with a malicious
intention, the prosecution has not made out
the case and the prisoner is entitled to an
acquittal." The application of the
Woolmington principle in Pakistan was
considered by the Federal Court of Pakistan

others 2019 SCMR 956 and Irshad Ahmed vs. the State 2011 SCMR 1190
afzaal

Crl. Appeal No. 161 of 2013 14
Sadiq & another vs. The State & another

in Safdar Ali. Abdul Rashid, CJ, in that case,
held:

"Tf, after an examination of the whole
evidence, the Court is of the opinion that
there is a reasonable possibility that the
defence put forward by the accused might be
true, it is clear that such a view reacts on
the whole prosecution case. In these
circumstances, the accused is entitled to the
benefit of doubt, not as a matter of grace,
but as of right, because the prosecution has
not proved its case beyond reasonable
doubt....

30. The defence plea could not be construed by the
learned trial court on the basis of surmises and conjectures
unless there had to be clear evidence helping the court to
arrive at such decision. The principles referred in earlier
discussion were imposing a duty on the learned trial court
that once prosecution’s version was disbelieved, there was
no authority with the court to make pick and choose of
defence plea and then to proceed to record the conviction.

31. In view of above, when both versions discussed and
analyzed in juxtaposition, the prosecution’s case has been found
based on dishonesty, malafide, improved version and false
assertions by the witnesses whereas, defence plea is probable and
nearer to possibility. So the final outcome is that prosecution has
badly failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt also
against Sadiq and Ghulam Muhammad alias Pakkhi (appellants).
Criminal Appeal No.161/2013 is therefore, allowed. Impugned
judgment is set_aside and the appellants are acquitted from the
case. They are on bail and discharged from terms and conditions
of bail bonds. The deliberations further resulted into dismissal

criminal revision and PSLA filed by the complainant.
