ARR ARK

Dr. Khurshid Iqbal, J.-

1. The appellant was indicted for the charge under section 9(d)
of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic Substances Act,
2019 (“the Act”) on the strength of FIR No.138, dated 20.03.2021,
registered at Police Station Karak. By its judgment, dated
23.02.2023 (“the impugned judgment”), the Special Court of
Additional Sessions Judge-II, Karak convicted and sentenced him to
life imprisonment, along with a fine of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five
Hundred Thousand), or to suffer 12 months S.I. in default of its
payment. The benefit under section 382-B Cr.P.C was extended to
him. Being aggrieved, the appellant has challenged the impugned
judgment under section 24 of the Act through the instant appeal.

2. Before we proceed to embark upon the merits, it would be
necessary to unveil the pertinent facts of the case. On 20.03.2021, at
17:30 hours, the complainant Asif Sharif, SHO, Karak received what
he called authentic information that charas would be smuggled on a
large scale through Shehzore pickup to southern districts. Acting on
the information, the SHO, accompanied by a police contingent, laid

a barricade at Toll Plaza Check Post, District Karak. Meanwhile, he
Page - 2 - of 10

intercepted a Shehzore pickup bearing Registration No.J-
5551/Peshawar for checking purpose. Its driver was alighted and
searched, but nothing incriminating was found in his possession.
However, the body floor of the vehicle was suspected. Accordingly,
an official mechanic named Qayyum Khan was called from the
police lines to open the floor. He arrived and did so. Consequently,
79 packets of charas wrapped in yellow colour solution tape were
recovered from it. On weighment, those came out 1200 grams each
(94800 grams in toto). Out of the recovered packets, five grams were
separated and sealed in parcels No.1 to 79 for their onward dispatch
to the FSL for chemical analysis, while the remaining quantities
were packed and sealed in parcel No.80. The recovered charas, along
with the vehicle, were taken into possession as per the recovery
memo Ex.PW-7/2. The driver disclosed his identity as Asad Khan
son of Sunab Gul resident of Ambar Banda, District Kohat. He was
accused of trafficking the recovered substance and arrested. The
murasila was drafted and sent to the police station through constable
Zakir Ullah No.5852 for registration of the case. This stood
converted into the FIR Ex.PA.

3. After the completion of the investigation, the final report
(challan) under section 173 Cr.P.C was submitted against the
appellant. He was summoned, and copies of relevant statements and
documents were supplied to him under section 265-C Cr.P.C.
Charge was framed, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
The prosecution produced 11 witnesses to substantiate the charge
against the appellant. In his statement recorded under section 342
Cr.P.C, the appellant pleaded innocence and refuted all the
allegations leveled against him. He did not opt to appear as his own
witness on oath under section 340(2) Cr.P.C to disprove the
allegations against him. He also did not produce any evidence in his
defence. After hearing the arguments, the trial Court adjudged the
appellant guilty and, as such, convicted and sentenced him as

aforesaid. Hence, this appeal.

4. We have anxiously considered the arguments addressed at the

bar and perused the material available on the record.

5. Perusal of the record reveals that the testimony of the
complainant Asif Sharif, SHO, served as the founding pillar of this
case inasmuch as he conducted the processes of search, seizure, and
arrest in the instant case. We would, therefore, like to start with his
testimony. He testified as PW-07 and provided the same narrative as
detailed in the FIR. He maintained consistency regarding the
material points related to the mode and manner in which he
conducted the processes of search, seizure, and arrest. He remained
unwavering in asserting the factum of recovery from the floor of the
vehicle driven by the appellant, in the presence of marginal
witnesses, as reflected in the recovery memo Ex.PW-7/2. In his
testimony, he affirmed that he had shown the recovered contraband
in sealed form to the I.0., a fact emphatically acknowledged by the
1.0. in his statement as PW-08.

6. Mechanic Qayyum Khan was examined as PW-03. He
remained categoric in stating that he opened the floor of the vehicle,
where 79 packets of charas were found concealed. Similarly,
Constable Habib Ullah No.219 was examined as PW-09. As a
marginal witness to the recovery memo Ex.PW-7/2, he fully narrated
and supported its contents. He narrated the minute aspects in which
the seizing officer conducted the processes of search, seizure, and
arrest. He fully endorsed the testimonies furnished by the seizing
officer and the mechanic against the appellant. All three witnesses
faced cross-examination on material aspects of the case. However,
they maintained consistency and did not contradict each other
regarding the factum of recovery being effected from the floor of the
vehicle driven by the appellant. Though, the learned counsel for the
appellant referred to some discrepancies in the testimony of the
mechanic (PW-03) regarding his arrival at the spot, the time he spent
there, and his departure from the spot, but the fact remains that the

role of this witness is limited to opening the floor of the vehicle,
Page - 4 - of 10

regarding which no discrepancy could be pointed out. Moreover, the
noted discrepancies, being not relevant to the core issue, do not cast

any aspersion on the prosecution narrative against the appellant.

7. Nasir Iqbal, MHC, was examined as PW-06. He testified that
the seizing officer handed him the case property, along with the
application addressed by the 1.0. to the FSL for its chemical
analysis, which he dispatched, along with the road certificate
through Constable Kashif-ur-Rehman No.542 to the FSL. Upon
return, he was handed over the receipt and road certificate duly
stamped by the FSL authorities as acknowledgment receipt. This fact
was fully supported by the said constable, who took the witness box
as PW-01. Both witnesses were extensively cross-examined by the
defence. However, nothing in their testimony was revealed that
could cast doubt on the safe custody or the secure transmission of

the case property to the FSL.

8. In addition to the aforementioned witnesses, the prosecution
has also produced and examined the remaining material witnesses.
An in depth examination of their testimonies reveals a consistent and
coherent account of the events pertaining to the charge against the
appellant. Despite thorough cross-examination by the defence, the
witnesses remained steadfast and unwavering in their accounts.
Remarkably, their testimonies collectively contribute to a
compelling and unambiguous narrative supporting the prosecution

case against the appellant.

9. Furthermore, the appellant has failed to point out any reason,
what to say of production of confidence inspiring evidence, that why
the local police would opt to implicate him in a false case involving
capital punishment. Regardless of whoever was the owner of the
vehicle, the fact remains that it was the appellant who drove it at the
time of recovery. While the appellant was driving the vehicle all
alone, no ambiguity is left as to his full control and conscious

possession of the recovered contraband, especially when those were
Page - 5 - of 10

recovered from its floor. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in Kashif
Amir _v. The State (PLD 2010 Supreme Court 1052) ruled that
when a person is driving a vehicle, he is in charge of it, and
whatever articles are within it are under his control and possession.
Similarly, in the case of Syed Karam Hussain Shah and others v. The
State and others (2019 MLD 1445), it was held that:

...in this case, the contraband was concealed in front

doors of the vehicle, therefore, onus is upon the

appellants to prove in terms of Article 122 of the

Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 as to how the

contraband was concealed in the car and as such, the

appellants have not explained the circumstances. At

last, the Apex Court has also laid down heavy burden

of proof upon the driver of vehicle, against whom the

prosecution has discharged its onus and the driver of

the vehicle is to be declared responsible person for

transportation of narcotics as no condition or

qualifications are made in Section 9(c) of CNSA,

1997.
10. Considering the inherent worth of the evidence presented, it
has been established that the prosecution has successfully proven
against the appellant the factum of recovery, the safe custody of the
contraband, and the secure transmission of the sample parcels to the
FSL. The sample parcels were dispatched to the FSL well within the
prescribed period of 72 hours of their recovery. The sample parcels
were subjected to chemical analysis at the FSL. The report (Ex.PZ)
confirmed the substances in the sample parcels as charas. This
provides significant corroboration to the charge against the

appellant.

11. Much was argued by the learned counsel for the appellant
regarding the failure of the prosecution to produce Register No.XIX
to prove the safe custody of the case property. In our view, Rule
22.70 of the Police Rules, 1934, which pertains to Register No.XIX,
is relevant. Its object is to ensure that the case property remains in

safe custody and is not tampered with. It is noted that in order to
Page - 6 - of 10

prove the factum of safe custody and secure transmission of the case
property to the FSL, the prosecution has examined all material
witnesses. Each of them affirmatively testified as to the recovery of
the case property, its transfer from one police officer to another, its
secure deposit in the storeroom of the police station, and its onward
transmission to the FSL through PW-01. There is no ambiguity as to
which police officers were responsible for the case property at each
stage, from beginning to end. Moreover, all relevant officials were
produced and examined, where they maintained clarity regarding
their respective roles throughout the process. The defence attempted
to impeach their credit through cross-examination, but remained
unsuccessful. Notably, the defence even did not put any suggestion
to the witnesses that entries in Register No.XIX were never made.
When the Muharrir took the witness box as PW-06, the defence
attempted to question his credibility regarding safe custody due to
Register No.XIX not being produced. However, the witness
emphatically stated that he made entries in Register No.XIX
regarding the receipt of the case property on 20.03.2021, a fact
affirming that entries were duly made and the register was
maintained. In these circumstances, it is clear that the prosecution
has otherwise succeeded in establishing, through a well knitted chain
of evidence, the factum of safe custody and secure transmission from

start to finish.

12. Nevertheless, we cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that when
the Register No.XIX was duly maintained and the entries related to
the case property were also recorded therein, then of course, its non-
production, neither by the 1.0. during the investigation, nor by the
Muharrir of the police station during his statement before the trial
court, would give an impression that they are either inefficient or
intentionally omitted to perform their duties for reasons best known
to them. Even under section 4(1)(b)(ii) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Prosecution Service (Constitution, Functions, and Powers) Act,

2005, the Public Prosecutor, upon receiving the final report under
Page - 7 - of 10

section 173 Cr.P.C, could withhold it due to the absence of a copy of
the relevant extract from Register No.XIX and return it to the IO.
for re-submission after removing the deficiency. But unfortunately,
the prosecution branch also failed to identify this deficiency and
follow the prescribed procedure as adumbrated in the above said
provision of law. Furthermore, no attempt was made by the Public
Prosecutor during the trial to ensure the production of the register
before the trial Court. This shows that the prosecution branch, too,

omitted to fulfill its functions and duties as required by law.

13. We cannot ignore that the escalating menace of narcotics,
both in its sale and trafficking, is a pressing concern that intensifies
day by day, as more and more young people are falling into
addiction. What never ceases to alarm us is the fact that even
children are known addicts nowadays, and the prevalence of this
harmful addiction knows no boundaries. Consequently, the youth
addicted are destined to compromise their future and become a
burden on society. Viewing this issue from a broader perspective,
the widespread prevalence of this menace poses a grave threat to
society, which carries the potential to precipitate its eventual
collapse and imperil the future of the youth. If left unchecked, the
pervasive consequences may weaken the stability, progress, and
prosperity of the nation as a whole. The Legislature, recognizing the
urgency of the situation, has proactively brought about legislative
strictness within the province through the enactment of the 2019
CNS Act. The legislative framework on the subject accentuates the
gravity of the menace. It is, therefore, high time to combat this
menace through the available machinery of the criminal justice
system in confluence with legislative efforts, all while adhering to
the norms of the law. It requires no reiteration that the object behind
the establishment of the criminal justice system can only be achieved
if everyone forming its part fulfills their duties in accordance with
law. However, should anyone of them fails to discharge their duties

as mandated by law, then of course, the image of the criminal justice
Page - 8 - of 10

system will be tarnished beyond repair, and the majesty of the law
will be lost. Considering this crucial aspect of the matter in
juxtaposition with the conduct shown by the Public Prosecutor, the
1.0., and the Muharrir of the police station, it is imperative to direct
the Director General Prosecution, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the
District Police Officer, Karak, to hold within their respective spheres
inquiries into the matter as to why Register No.XIX was not brought
on the record, neither by the I.O. during the investigation, nor by the
Muharrir of the police station during his statement, nor any attempt
was made for this purpose by the Public Prosecutor, either upon the
receipt of the report under section 173 Cr.P.C, or during the trial,
and in case the omission is found to be the result of inefficiency, or
any other reason constituting inefficiency or misconduct on their
part, to initiate disciplinary proceedings against them in accordance
with law. The compliance reports shall be submitted to this Court
through the Additional Registrar of this Bench for our perusal in

chambers.

14. Considering the afore-noted facts and circumstances and the
huge quantity of the recovered charas, we are afraid to hold the mere
non-production of Register No.XIX as fatal to the prosecution case.
The submission of the learned counsel for the appellant is, therefore,

repelled.

15. Although, the learned counsel for the appellant also pointed
out some minor contradictions and discrepancies, such as those
related to timings and the number of police officials accompanying
the seizing officer to the spot, however, these do not cast doubt on
the guilt of the appellant in the judicial mind of this Court. Instead,
these discrepancies are found to be trivial and can be overlooked,
especially when the factum of recovery, the chain of safe custody,
and the secure transmission of the contraband are proven beyond
doubt. It cannot lose sight of the fact that police officials routinely
conduct the process of recovery of narcotic substances. Over time,

recollections of exact timings and the number of officials involved
,

Page - 9 - of 10

may vary. This does not imply that witnesses did not provide truthful
testimony, rather it shows the fallibility of memory and the routine
nature of such proceedings. By now, it is well settled that
prosecution witnesses are not expected to provide statements with
mathematical precision, but to provide truthful testimony to the best
of their recollection. Minor discrepancies or inconsistencies in
testimony should be disregarded as long as the core facts remain
consistent. It follows that parrot like narration of facts with
mathematical precision is not required, nor necessarily trustworthy.
As held by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Agil v. State (2023
SCMR 831), parrot like statements are discredited by the Courts. It
is a normal course of human conduct that minor discrepancies may

occur while narrating a particular incident.

16. In appreciating the effect of minor discrepancies and
contradictions in the prosecution case, the Supreme Court in

Shamsher Ahmad and another v. The State and others (2022 SCMR

1931) unequivocally held that undue importance should not be
attached to such discrepancies that do not shake the salient features
of the prosecution case, rather they should be ignored. The accused
cannot claim a premium for such minor discrepancies, and attaching
too much importance to such insignificant inconsistencies would
destabilize the purpose of the criminal administration of justice,
which is not solely intended for acquittals based on minor

discrepancies.

17. With these observations in mind, we are constrained to hold
that the prosecution has successfully proven the charge against the
appellant through compelling and confidence inspiring evidence
beyond any reasonable doubt. Not being persuaded that there was no
sound basis for adjudging the appellant guilty, we conclude that the
trial court has thoroughly appreciated the evidence presented, and, as
such, the impugned judgment is not open to any interference by this

Court.
Page - 10 - of 10

18. In the result, we would dismiss the appeal. Copy of this
judgment, along with full particulars of the case, be immediately
remitted to the Director General Prosecution, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,

and the DPO, Karak for compliance as aforesaid.
