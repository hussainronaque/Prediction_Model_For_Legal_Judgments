SYED MUHAMMAD ATTIQUE SHAH, J.-
Through this single judgment, this Court shall dispose
of bail petition and bail cancellation application, as
both arising out of one and the same case registered
vide F.IL.R No.726 dated 20.07.2018 under sections
419/420/467/471/34 PPC in Police Station Cantt,

Abbottabad. The particulars of the petitions are as

under:
(i) Cr.M (BA) No.924-A of 2018 Waqas
Aslam Awan Vs. The State etc.
(ii) Cr.M (BCA) No.941-A of 2018 Col.
Retd. Muhammad Khalid Khan
Vs. Imran Khan etc.
2. Accused-petitioner, Waqas Aslam Awan seeks

his post arrest bail in case FIR No.726 dated
20.07.2018 under sections 419/420/467/471/34 of
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 registered at Police Station
Cantt, Abbottabad.

3. The case of the prosecution against the
petitioners, registered on the report of complainant
Col. Retd Khalid Khan, after issuance of direction
under section 22-A Cr.P.C by the Justice of Peace,
wherein, he stated that his brother, having a house
constructed in ‘Khasra’ No.3003 measuring 5
‘Marlas’, situated in ‘Mauza’ Sheikh-ul-Bandi, Tehsil
& District Abbottabad, died issueless and his
inheritance mutation No.31106 was attested on
29.04.2016 in favour of his widow, Mst. Zahida Rani,
brothers and sisters; that accused/petitioner Waqas
Aslam Awan, who is maternal nephew of the wife of
complainant and the widow of his brother late
Muhammad Tariq; that accused/petitioner, in order to
obtain fraudulently the house with malafide and
forgery, in connivance with accused Fida Hussain,
Muhammad Tayyab Yaseen, residents of Dhok
Syedan, Rawalpindi and Imran Khan, relatives of
complainant and the accused/petitioner, prepared a
forged affidavit dated 12.04.2016, on behalf of
accused Fida Hussain in favour of accused/petitioner

Wagas Aslam Awan, showing payment of earnest
money by the former to the latter for the said house,
while Muhammad Tayyb Yaseen and Imran Khan
were shown witnesses of the said affidavit; that they
all played fraud and cheating with the complainant
and others in order to deprive them from their
property, without having any right to do so.
Accused/petitioner Waqas Aslam and co-accused
Imran Khan moved application for their release on
bail to the learned Judicial Magistrate, Abbottabad,
who after hearing learned counsel for the parties
granted post arrest bail to both the accused vide order
dated 13.08.2018. The complainant moved an
application for cancellation of bail granted to the
accused/ petitioner and accused/respondent in (Cr.M
No. BCA No.941-A/2018) before the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-I, Abbottabad, which was
partially allowed vide order dated 09.11.2018,
whereby, bail granted to accused/petitioner Waqas
Aslam Khan was recalled, while application to the
extent of accused/respondent Imran Khan was
dismissed. Hence, the present bail petition and bail
cancellation petition before this Court.

4. Arguments of the learned counsel for the

accused/petitioner and learned AAG assisted by
learned counsel for the complainant heard and record
perused with their able assistance.

5. Perusal of record reveals that an
affidavit-cum-agreement to sell was scribed between
accused Fida Hussain and accused/petitioner Waqas
Aslam Awan on 12.04.2016 at Rawalpindi, whereby,
the former agreed to sell a house to the latter,
measuring 5 ‘Marlas’, situated in Mohallah Supply,
Abbottabad for a sum of Rs.4,600,000/- and a sum of
Rs.1,500,000/- as earnest money was paid to the seller
and the remaining amount was to be paid on
12.10.2016, where-after, the buyer was bound to
transfer the suit house in the name of the seller i.e.
accused/petitioner. Besides, the possession of the
disputed house was also handed over to the
accused/petitioner by said Fida Hussain. It is evident
from record of the case that before the target date
fixed for payment of remaining amount,
accused/petitioner filed a suit for specific performance
of contract etc on 24.09.2016 against accused Fida
Hussain and he has also impleaded the present
complainant including widow, brothers and sisters of
late Muhammad Tariq Khan as defendant in the suit.
The civil Court has issued temporary injunction in

favour of the accused/petitioner. It is also an admitted
fact that inheritance mutation No.31106 in respect of
the disputed house has also been attested on
29.04.2016 in favour of the legal heirs of late
Muhammad Tariq. Thereafter, the complainant and
others also instituted a suit on 17.10.2016 against
accused/petitioner Waqas Aslam Awan, Mst.Zahida
Rani, widow of late Muhammad Tariq and Fida
Hussain, for declaration, permanent injunction,
possession and recovery of compensation and
possession through partition and also challenged the
deed. Both the suits are pending before the civil
Court.

6. It appears from record of the case that the
affidavit in question was scribed on 12.04.2016,
whereas, the report was lodged against the
accused/petitioner and others on 08.03.2018, after
delay of about two years, that too, when prima facie,
the complainant could not succeed to get the
temporary injunction vacated, moreover particularly,
when widow of the deceased has admittedly been
residing in the said house. It is yet to be determined
by the learned Civil Court whether the deed in
question was forged or accused Fida Hussain has any
right to transfer the disputed house or not after

recording evidence. At this moment this Court cannot
enter into threadbare discussion regarding the
transaction took place between the parties, as it is the
job of the trial Court, however, in view of the peculiar
facts and circumstances, this Court considers that the
case against the petitioner is that of further inquiry
into his guilt. Moreover, the offence under section 419
PPC provides seven years imprisonment or fine or
both, whereas section 420 PPC, is bailable and in
view of the facts of the present case, the applicability
of sections 467/471, would also be seen by the learned
trial Court at the relevant time during trial.

7. In Zafar _Iqbal’s_ case (2009 SCMR
1488), a larger Bench of the august Apex Court has
explicitly expressed the principles for considering the
grant of bail, where offences do not fall within the
prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C. The said
principles have consistently been followed by the
Honourable Supreme Court, as it has been held in
Riaz Jafar Natiq’s case (2011 SCMR 1708) that:

“Thus keeping in view the law laid
down in the case of Zafar Iqbal v.
Muhammad Anwar and others (2009
SCMR 1488) ordaining that where a
case falls within non-prohibitory
clause the concession of granting bail
must be favourably considered and
should only be declined in exceptional
cases. We do not find this to be a case
where it should be refused as an
exception. Thus, this petition is
converted into an appeal and the
same is allowed and, resultantly, the
petitioner is admitted to bail subject to
furnishing bail bond in the sum of Rs.
1,00,000 (Rupees one hundred
thousand only) with two sureties each
in the like amount to the satisfaction
of the learned trial Court.”

8. In any case, investigation in the
present case is complete and the accused/petitioner
is not required to the police for the purpose of
further investigation. In peculiar facts and
circumstances of the present case, no useful
purpose is going to be served by keeping him
behind the bars.

9. Consequently, the instant bail application
is accepted and accused-petitioner, Waqas Aslam
Awan is admitted to bail, subject to his furnishing bail
bonds in the sum of Rs.200,000/- (Rupees two
Hundred Thousands), with two sureties, each in the
like amount to the satisfaction of the I//aqa/Duty
Magistrate, Abbottabad.

10. So far as the connected bail
cancellation petition is concerned, this Court
considers that the grounds and the reasons,
rendered by the learned Judicial Magistrate,
Abbottabad and maintained by Additional
Sessions Judge-I, Abbottabad, for grant of post

arrest bail to accused/respondent, Imran Khan are
based on proper appreciation of facts and the law
applicable thereto. Thus, this Court is of the view
that said order of the learned Magistrate granting
bail to him is neither arbitrary nor perverse,
warranting interference by this Court at this stage.
Therefore, the bail cancellation petition being
bereft of merits is dismissed.
11. Before parting with the judgment, it is
to be noted that the observations rendered
hereinabove being tentative in nature, would not
affect the mind of the trial Court in any manner
whatsoever, during trial of the case.

Above are the detailed reasons for

short order of this Court of even date.
