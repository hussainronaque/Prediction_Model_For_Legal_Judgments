JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, _J.- This

appeal is directed against the judgment dated 26.03.2008,
passed by learned Revisional Court/Additional Sessions
Judge-IX, Peshawar, whereby he while allowing the
criminal revision petition of the respondents-accused,
setting aside the judgment/order dated 12.07.2007 of
learned Trial Court/Judicial Magistrate and by accepting
the application of the respondents-accused under section
249-A Cr.P.C., acquitted them of the charge in case FIR
No.139 dated 10.06.2003, registered under section 337-A
(ii)/34 PPC, in Police Station Bhana Mari, Peshawar.

2. The prosecution case is that on 10.06.2003,
at 06.20 hours, the respondents-accused while duly armed
with rifles thrashed appellant-complainant Muhammad
Iqbal, his brothers Muhammad Tariq, Farooq and

Nasrullah with the Butts of their rifles, as a result,

complainant and his brother Tariq sustained injuries,
hence, this case.

3. Accused/respondents were granted bail by
the learned Judicial Magistrate on the basis of compromise
arrived at between the parties. During trial, injured-
complainant and PW Tariq, resiled from the compromise
and in their statements before the learned Trial Court,
charged the accused for commission of the offence. Some
prosecution evidence was examined when in the meantime,
accused/respondents filed application before the learned
Trial Court under section 249-A Cr.P.C. for their acquittal
on the basis of compromise at bail stage, but the same was
dismissed vide order dated 12.07.2007, against which, the
accused/respondents, filed a criminal revision petition
before the learned Additional Sessions Judge-IX,
Peshawar, who vide order dated 26.03.2008 by allowing
the revision petition, set aside the impugned
judgment/order of the learned Trial Court and acquit the
accused/respondents by invoking the provision of section
249-A Cr.P.C., hence, this appeal.

4. Learned counsel for the
appellant/complainant argued that no doubt injured had
entered into a compromise with the accused, but the

compromise was only to the extent of bail and by then the

prosecution of offence was not pending before the learned
Judicial Magistrate, therefore, such compromise cannot be
made as basis for acquittal during trial; that later on, due to
conduct of the accused-respondents, the injured resiled
from the compromise, therefore, appeared in the witness
box before the learned Trial Court and charged the
accused; that learned revisional court has proceeded on
wrong premises by acquitting the accused on the basis of
compromise at bail stage, therefore, the impugned
judgment/order of the revisional court is liable to be
reversed.

5. Conversely, learned counsel for the
accused/respondents contended that compromise effected
between the parties even at bail stage would remain valid
during trial which cannot be revoked by any of the parties
unilaterally when main case would come up for trial. He
further added that victims after once having entered into a
valid compromise were not competent to withdraw from
the same. He further added that in the written compromise
at bail stage, both the injured have categorically stated that
they have no objection on release of the accused on bail as
well as on their acquittal, therefore, the said compromise
being exhibited before the competent court cannot be

discarded on mere retraction of the injured from the same

during trial; that the injured just to black mail the accused,
resiled from the compromise, therefore, the learned
revisional court by considering the compromise arrived at,
at bail stage, has rightly acquitted respondents-accused by
invoking the provision of section 249-A Cr.P.C.

6. Learned AAG contended that if the
compromise at bail stage was only for the purpose of bail,
then the same cannot be taken into consideration for
acquittal of the accused during trial. He, however, was of
the opinion that if during compromise at bail stage the
complainant/injured/ LRs of the deceased, as the case may
be, waived or compound the offence with the accused and
express their no objection on release as well as acquittal of
the accused, then such compromise can be taken into
account during trial even if the same has been retracted.

7. I have heard the respective submissions
advanced from either side and perused the record carefully.
8. No doubt, in the compromise deed Exh.PA
followed by statements of the injured, they have
categorically expressed their no objection on release of the
accused on bail as well as on their acquittal, but one thing
is clear that by then the learned Judicial Magistrate, who
granted bail to the accused on the basis of compromise,

was not acting as a Trial Court being not confronted with

the prosecution of the offence, rather he was only
confronted with the application of the accused for bail.
Under sub-section (2) of section 345 Cr.P.C. the offences
mentioned in the first two columns given in the said
section may, with the permission of the Court before whom
any prosecution for such offence is pending, be
compounded by the persons mentioned in the third column
given thereunder. Legally speaking such a compromise
effected at bail stage, cannot be made basis for acquittal of
the accused during trial as under section 345 (2) Cr.P.C. it
would be the Trial Court which has to satisfy itself and
grant permission in respect of compounding the offence
being tried by it. The important point for consideration in
cases of compromise is the satisfaction of the learned Trial
Court about the genuineness of the compromise that
whether it had been actually effected between the parties at
bail stage. Iam conscious of the fact that under section 345
(2) Cr.P.C. pendency of prosecution of the offence before
the learned Trial Court at the time of compromise is a
condition precedent, but in the interest of justice keeping in
view the traditions, customs and the way of earning
livelihood of the people in the country, I would added that
the Trial Court may consider the same compromise arrived

at between the parties at bail stage during trial, if the

compromise is still intact and victims or the LRs of the
deceased as the case may be, have no objection over the
compromise produced at bail stage, as this court has
observed that after effecting compromise at bail stage, the
male victims/ LRs of the deceased, sometime proceed
abroad for the purpose of earning livelihood while in case
of unmarried females injured/ LRs, if they get married,
their attendance create complications/unnecessary hurdle
in the way of compromise already effected and this
sometime even result in dismissal of the compromise
between the parties effected with great efforts by the elders
of the area by burying the hatchets of the parties. However,
if the learned Trial Court is not satisfied from the
compromise arrived at between the parties at bail stage, it
may proceed with the compromise afresh. As stated earlier,
the main point for consideration in such like cases is
always the satisfaction of the Trial Court in the interest of
justice and the parties, before whom the prosecution of the
offence is pending.

9. In the instant case, though the injured had
effected compromise with the accused at bail stage, but
during prosecution of the offence before the learned Trial
Court, they resiled, therefore, the learned Trial Court being

not satisfied from the compromise, was justified by not

considering the compromise for acquittal of the accused-
respondents. The learned revisional Court by over-sighting
the above discussed peculiar facts and circumstances of the
case and the law on the subject, landed in the field of error
and thus reached to erroneous conclusion by acquitting the
accused under section 249-A Cr.P.C. on the basis of
compromise.

9. Resultantly, I by allowing this appeal, set
aside the impugned judgment of the learned Revisional
Court and restored the order/judgment of the learned Trial
Court. The case is remanded to the learned Trial Court for
proceeding with the same on merits. Since, some of the
prosecution evidence has already been recorded, therefore,
the learned Trial Court by proceeding with the case on day
to day basis, shall decide the same within a month, from
the date of receipt of the record. During this period, the
accused/respondents shall remain on bail on the already
existing bail bonds. Office is directed to send the record to
the learned Trial Court within two days, without fail.

10. The Additional Registrar (Judicial) of this
court is directed to send copy of this judgment to the
learned Sessions Judge, Peshawar, who shall further
circulate the same among the Judicial Magistrates and the

Additional Sessions Judges of the District for future

guidance. The Additional Registrar (Judicial), shall
intimate compliance of direction to this Court.
