JUDGMENT

AHMAD ALI, J. Through this common judgment

we would propose to decide the connected Cr.R
No.118-P/2017. & Cr.A  No.541-P/2017 _ being
outcome of one and the same judgment dated
22.07.2017 of the learned Additional Sessions Judge-
XIU, Peshawar, whereby the appellant Adil Khan s/o
Roman, was convicted and sentenced to life
imprisonment with fine of Rs.100,000/ with payment
of compensation amount of Rs.300,000/- to the LRs
of deceased u/s 544-A Cr.P.C or in default thereof to
suffer 6 months SI, whereas co-accused Iftikhar Ali
s/o Murad Khan was acquitted of the charges, in case
FIR No.1159 dated 03.12.2013 registered against
them under sections 302/34 PPC at Police Station,

Badhber (Peshawar).
2. Brief facts of the case are that
complainant/Chinar Gul reported the matter to local
police to the effect that on 03.12.2013, when he was
proceeding to his house, he found the dead body of his
son Farid Ullah lying in a Suzuki vehicle, who was
put to death by some unknown person through
firearm. Initially, nobody was charged. Later on, on
26.02.2014, complainant recorded his statement under
section 164 Cr.P.C before learned JMIC, Peshawar,
wherein he charged the present appellant and
acquitted accused (respondent in Cr.A No.541-
P/2017) for the murder of his deceased son Farid
Ullah. Accordingly, both the accused were arrested
and put to trial.

2. On completion of investigation, challan was
submitted in Court where the accused-appellant was
charge-sheeted to which he pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. The prosecution in order to prove its
case, produced and examined as many as thirteen
witnesses whereafter statement of the accused was
recorded, wherein, he professed his innocence. The
learned Trial Court, after conclusion of trial, found the
appellant guilty of the charge and, while recording his
conviction, sentenced him as mentioned above.
Feeling aggrieved, the appellant has filed the instant

appeal before this Court.
3. Arguments heard and record gone through.

4. No doubt, it was an unseen occurrence and
initially, nobody was charged by the complainant for
the murder of his deceased son Farid Ullah. The State
came into action when mobile of the said deceased
was traced and recovered from one Nazim Mahmood
resident of Kohat. The complainant also recorded his
statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C before the JMIC on
26.02.2014 and charged the present accused-
appellant along with acquitted co-accused. There is
nothing on record or in the statement of complainant
in respect of source of information for charging the
accused in the instant case. The accused-appellant
and acquitted co-accused were shown to have been
arrested on 24.02.2014, but, surprisingly, there is no
card of arrest available on record in this regard so as
to suggest their features and identification marks etc.
5. The prosecution, for establishing the case
against accused-appellant and acquitted co-accused,
though produced the said Nazim Mahmood to whom
the cell phone was sold by the acquitted co-accused
(ftikhar Ali), before the Judicial Magistrate, but he
was not examined as PW during trial for reasons best
known to them. Had it been he would substantiate the
stance of prosecution with regard to involvement of

the accused appellant in the commission of offence in
shape of the recovered mobile of deceased. In the
circumstances adverse inference u/s 129(g) of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 could be safely
drawn. Be that as it may, the mobile phone when
produced before the Court was not in sealed
condition what to say about its parcel number. So, it
cannot be said with confidence that actually the said
mobile phone was the ownership of deceased. The
initial dents, as hinted above, create serious doubts in
the prosecution case qua involvement of the accused-
appellant in the commission of offence. Reliance

could be safely placed NLR 2015 SCJ 121.

7. From perusal of record, it further transpires
that the occurrence took place on 03.12.2013 which
was admittedly an unseen occurrence and there was
no direct evidence either that of the murder of
deceased Farid Ullah or about he having been lastly
seen alive in the company of accused. The
complainant had, therefore, initially nominated no
one as accused in the FIR and it was on 26.02.2014
when he recorded his statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C and
charged the accused in the present case without
mentioning source of his satisfaction. Accused were
then arrested and they have recorded their
confessional statements before the Magistrate. But,

surprisingly, no cards of arrest of both the accused
are available on judicial file to show that actually
when the accused were arrested in the instant case.
The prosecution also recorded the statement of one
PW Nazim Mahmood u/s 164 Cr.P.C from whose
custody the alleged mobile phone of deceased was
recovered who in his said statement, recorded on
05.03.2014, deposed as under:-
“I work in Plaster of Paris Factory at Kohat.
Iftikhar Ali also used to work with me in the said
factory. About one month ago, the said Iftikhar Ali
sold mobile set Samsung of white colour to me for
Rs.4000// Later on I came to know that the said
mobile set was the property of a deceased person
and the same was taken from him after his murder.

There is no malafide on my part. The mobile set in

question was produced by me to the police, who

took the same into possession.”

Which shows that he has only mentioned the
name of accused Iftikhar Ali (acquitted co accused).
His statement was not cross examined by the present
as well as acquitted co-accused as they have already
recorded their confessional statements on 01.03.2014
which is otherwise, exculpatory in its nature and it
will be more appropriate to discuss the statement

recorded under section 164 Cr.P.C;

Confession...... Confessions may be divided into two
classes, i.e. judicial and extra-judicial. Judicial

confessions are those which are made _ before
Magistrate or Court in the course of judicial
proceedings. Extra- judicial confessions are those
which are made by the party elsewhere than before a
Magistrate or Court. Extra judicial confessions are
generally those made by a party to or before a private
individual which includes even a judicial officer in his
private capacity. It also includes a Magistrate who is
not especially empowered to record confessions under
Section 164 of the Code or a Magistrate so
empowered but receiving the confession at a stage
when Section 164 does not apply. As to extra-judicial
confessions, two questions arise: (i) were they made
voluntarily? And (ii) are they true? As the section
enacts, a confession made by an accused person is
irrelevant in a criminal proceedings, if the making of
the confession appears to the Court to have been
caused by any inducement, threat or promise, (1)
having reference to the charge against the accused
person, (2) proceeding from a person in authority, and
(3) sufficient, in the opinion of the Court to give the
accused person grounds which would appear to him
reasonable for supposing that by making it he would
gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal

nature in reference to the proceedings against him.

8. Moreover, the Magistrate had nowhere stated

in the certificate or at the trial that he was fully
acquainted with or could understand the native
language of accused and that the confession was
translated word-by-word from the native language to
Urdu/English language. Another important aspect
was that the accused subsequently retracted his
confession. Keeping in view the conflict with the
other pieces of evidence, brought on record, the
retracted confession of the accused has lost its
evidentiary value and legal efficacy thus, it is
absolutely unsafe to rely on it and that too for
recording punishment on a capital charge. Even
otherwise, Judicial confession allegedly made by
accused-appellant before a Magistrate under section
164, Cr.P.C. had been retracted before the Trial
Court and in the absence of any independent
corroboration such retracted judicial confession could
not suffice all by itself for recording or upholding the
accused appellant’s conviction. More so, Retracted
confession should have been corroborated by some
other independent evidence and the same seldom
sufficed by itself to record a conviction on the basis
of the same. Mobile phone recovered during
investigation did not stand connected with alleged
offence and there was no other piece of evidence
produced by prosecution to provide any

corroboration to retracted confessions attributed to
accused appellant, thus, prosecution has miserably
failed to establish its case against the accused-
appellant. Even, otherwise, in view of the law laid
down in case reported in 2017 SCMR 713, if an
accused confesses his guilt, but pleads not guilty
during trial, then prosecution is bound to prove the
same beyond any shadow of doubt. We are also
forfeited from the case law laid down in the dictums
reported in AIR 2003 SC 3601, (2003)8 SCC 180,
2017 SCMR 986, 2017 SCMR 898 & 2012 SCMR

580, 2016 SCMR 274.

9. The moot point in the instant case is the
confessional statement of accused appellant and that
of acquitted co-accused. Now, it is important to see
the confessional statement of accused that whether it
was recorded according to principles laid down by
the superior courts or not. Confession recorded with a
delay of 4 days after arrest with no plausible
explanation and such undue delay cannot be made
basis for recording conviction of accused on capital
charge. Longer the custody of accused weaker the
evidentiary value of confession. Reference can be

made to case titled “Said Rasool Vs Sajid and three

others” reported in NLR 2014 SD 223.

10. For relying on confessional statement of any

accused it is to be appreciated that a specific
procedure has been followed u/s 164 Cr.P.C. i.e. as
soon as the accused is produced for his confessional
statement, his handcuffs should be removed and the
police officers should be turned out from the court
room, thereafter accused should be informed that he
is before a Magistrate and whether he makes any
statement or not. He would not be given back to the
police, which had produced him before the Court but
would be remanded to judicial lock-up. He should be
given sufficient time to ponder over the matter.
Thereafter he should be warned that he is not bound
to make any statement but if he did so, it could be
used against him as evidence. It will be also
appreciated that once accused, in a murder case, was
entrusted to custody of Magistrate, the Magistrate
was required to clear his court room from all the
police officials/officers in uniform or in plain clothes
and accused should be provided a chair and dice also
disclosing him that he is in safe and secure hands of
Magistrate and that he would not be entertained in
fear of police. Magistrate was also required to infuse
courage and confidence in the accused and providing
assurance that in case he did not make a confession,
he would not be handed over back to police. Simply
filing of printed proforma and dictating such an

important matter to typist was not a faithful
10

obligation under the law. In the instant case the
Magistrate has simply filled the proforma and has
shown highly irresponsible attitude while dealing
with such a sensitive matter and has violated the clear
instructions of the High Court, contained in the High

Court Rules & Orders.

11. There is another glaring point in the instant
case that while recording the confessional statements
of accused, no identity was affirmed by the learned
Judicial Magistrate. The questionnaire and certificate
did not contain anything regarding identity of
appellant like CNIC #, identification marks, physical
appearance. Likewise, no identification parade was
conducted in presence of witnesses that the accused-
appellant making confessional statement is actually
the one who has been enrobed in the instant case or
anyone else. In this regard, wisdom can be derived
from the case law laid down in the dictum reported in

2017 PLR 554.

12. It is a bedrock principle of law that, once a
Statute or rule directs that a particular act must be
performed and shall be construed in a particular way
then, acting contrary to that is impliedly prohibited.
That means, doing of something contrary to the

requirements of law and rules, is impliedly prohibited.
11

Therefore, the so called confession of accused
appellant cannot be termed as a true and voluntary
confession, and it cannot, whatsoever, be made the
sole basis for conviction of the accused appellant on a
capital charge specially when there is no corroborative
evidence, mere recovery of alleged mobile of
deceased from a third person that too who was not
produced for test of cross examination and the said
mobile was even not sealed into parcel and there is
also no proof that the mobile is actually the ownership
of deceased.

13. The above discussion has led this Court to
believe that the learned trial court has erred in
appreciating the case evidence in its true perspective.
It has been held, time and again by the superior
courts, that a slightest doubt occurs in the prosecution
case is sufficient to grant acquittal to an accused. The
conclusions drawn by the learned trial Court are not
borne out of the case evidence, therefore, the

impugned judgment is not sustainable.

14. For what has been discussed above, this appeal
is allowed, the impugned judgment is set aside and the
appellant is acquitted of the charge levelled against
him. He be set at liberty forthwith, if not required to

be detained in any other case.
12

15. As the judgment of the learned Trial Court is
set aside, therefore, the connected Criminal Revision
No.118-P/2017 has become infructuous and is
dismissed accordingly. Resultantly, the connected
Criminal Appeal against acquittal bearing No.541-

P/2017, being meritless also stands dismissed.

16. Above are the reasons of short order of even

date.
