3. As per contents of the F.ILR, on 02.02.2013 at
00.10 hours, Haider Zaman Khan, SHO to P.S. Lal Qila (PW-
7) was on "Ghust" of the "J//aga" alongwith other police
party and in the meanwhile received information in respect of
the commission of double murder at the vicinity of village
Karamar. For confirmation and other legal formalities, he
rushed to the venue of "Wardaat", found the dead bodies of
both the deceased accompanied by complainant, Israrullah
(PW-1), who reported the matter to the local police to the
effect that his sister Mst. Sharafat Bibi got married to one
Ghulam Haider some 4/5 months prior to the occurrence. On
the invitation of his sister, he alongwith his cousin Ishfaq
Ahmad (deceased) on 01.02.2013 at 12:00 hours visited her
house and were present in the "Baitak" while she used to
come to the "Baitak" for serving of tea as well as dinner and
after finishing dinner, they were busy in gossiping, when his
sister Mst. Sharafat Bibi (deceased) came to the Baitak and
remained busy in arranging quilt on the cots and told them to
get prepare for sleep. In the meanwhile, the convict-appellant
(who is uncle of his sister’s husband) duly armed with
Kalashnikov came to there and exchanged hot words with his
sister Mst. Sharafat Bibi on the pretext that why she came to
Baitak at night time and started altercation with them.

Thereafter, the appellant started indiscriminate firing upon
Ashfaq Ahmad & Mst. Sharafat Bibi, as a result of which
both of them died at the spot. The motive behind the
occurrence was that the appellant was suspicious that the
deceased have illicit relation with each other. The occurrence
was witnessed by the complainant and he charged the

appellant/ convict for the commission of crime.

4. After recording report of the complainant, it was
read-over and explained to him, who after admitting it to be
corrected impressed his thumb. After inspection of the bodies
of the deceased by Haider Zaman Khan SHO, he prepared
injury sheets alongwith inquest reports and sent it for
post-mortem examination, whereas the Murasala Ex. PA/I
was dispatched to the P.S. Lal Qila and on the basis of
marasila F.I.R. No. 50 dated 02.02.2013 was registered

against the convict/appellant under section 302 PPC.

5. On arrest of the accused/appellant and
subsequently on completion of investigation conducted by
the local police of P.S. Lal Qila, complete challan was
submitted against the appellant to the Court of learned Izafi
Zila Qazi Samarbagh, where at the commencement of the
trial, the prosecution produced as many as twelve (12)
witnesses, whose statements were recorded and placed on

file.
6. On close of the prosecution’s evidence, accused
was examined under section 342 Cr.P.C. Describing himself
as scapegoat; denied the charges, professed innocence and
stated to have falsely been implicated in the case. He,
however, wished to produce no defence nor to examine

himself on oath as required under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C.

7. The learned Trial Judge on conclusion of the trial
convicted and sentenced the accused/appellant vide judgment

impugned herein.

8. Learned counsel for the appellant-convict argued
that sole testimony of the complainant was not sufficient to
bring home the charges leveled against the appellant, as at the
time of occurrence the complainant was not present at the
venue of wardaat and the occurrence has not been taken
placed in the mode and manner as described by the
prosecution. He further added that material contradiction
existed in the statement of alleged eyewitness and other
evidence produced by the prosecution, thus, the impugned
conviction and sentence by the learned trial Court was not
warranted in light of the facts and circumstances of the case.
He lastly argued that the confession was obtained through
third decree method, which was neither voluntary nor true

and the same was retracted one as well as also questioned the
recovery of weapon to be planted one by the complainant

against the accused by joining hands with the police party.

9. Learned A.A.G. appearing on behalf of the State
and learned counsel for complainant on the other hand argued
that the appellant is directly and singularly charged in the
FIR for committing double murder, which is supported by the
confessional statement of accused coupled with testimony of
the eyewitness/complainant (PW-1), medical evidence,
recoveries in shape of empties from the spot and
Kalashnikov, as weapon of offence, at pointation of
appellant, blood stained garments of both the deceased and
positive FSL reports in respect of recoveries and negative
FSL report regarding swabs taken from both the deceased.
They further submitted that the prosecution's witnesses were
consistent on material particulars; therefore, the conviction is
based on proper appreciation of evidence on record and call

for no interference.

10. We have considered the arguments rendered by
learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the

entire record with their valuable assistance.

11. In support of the charge prosecution examined 12

PWs gist of which is as under:
PW 1 is the complainant and star witness who has
reiterated the stance taken in his report.

PW 2 Gul Naseed has received dead body of his
daughter Mst. Sharafat Bibi.

PW 3 Gul Hayat is the marginal witness of
recovery memo Ex PW 3/1 through which blood stained shirt
of Mst. Sharafat Bibi was taken into possession.

PW 4 Latif ur Rehman has received the dead body
of his son deceased Ashfaq Khan.

PW 5 is Shah Faisal Judicial Magistrate who has
recorded confessional statement of appellant/convict.

PW 6 is Dr. Jamil Khan who has conducted
postmortem of the deceased.

PW 7 Haidar Zaman Khan SHO has recorded
report of complainant, prepared injury sheets, inquest reports
and arrested the appellant. He has also recovered the weapon
of offence Kalashnikov on _ the pointation of
appellant/convict.

PW 8 Abdur Rauf ASI is the scribe of FIR.

PW 9 Suliman Shah is the marginal witness of the
recovery memo of weapon of offence P1.

PW 10 Rehmat Younas is the Investigation Office
in the present case who has inspected the spot; prepared site

plan; recovered blood stains earth and piece of carpet from
the place of occurrence; recovered 17 empties of 7.62 bore
along with 4 spent bullets; prepared list of LRs of deceased;
sent blood stained articles to FSL along with bullets, empties
and weapon of offence; took into possession quilt and other
belongings to deceased i.e mobile phones.

PW 11 Jamilullah had received sealed bottles from
the doctor and handed over to the I.O.

PW 12 Saeedullah is marginal witness of the
recovery memo Ex PW 12/9 through which bottle contained
Swabs were taken into possession.

12. It appears from the record that the prosecution’s
case mainly hinges upon the ocular evidence furnished by
sole eyewitness of the occurrence i.e. complainant Israrullah
(PW-1). In the present case, the occurrence took place on
02.02.2013 at about 00.10 hours in the house of deceased
Mst. Sharafat Bibi at the vicinity of village Karamar, wherein
as per prosecution version, the complainant Israrullah,
brother of the deceased Mst. Sharafat Bibi alongwith his
cousin Ashfaq Khan went to the house of deceased, so, as to
bring her to her parents’ house. They were present in the
Baitak as guest in her house and she came to Baitak in order
to arrange the bed sheets of the cot for them and told them to
go to sleep, when, the accused/appellant came to there and

asked the deceased-lady that for what purpose she came to
the Baitak at nighttime? Thereafter, the appellant exchanged
hot words with them and fired upon at Ashfaq Khan and
Mst. Sharafat Bibi, as a result of which both of them died at
the spot. As stated earlier, the occurrence was witnessed by
complainant. Now the question arises that whether the
complainant was present at the place of occurrence alongwith
the deceased Ashfaq Khan and Mst. Sharafat Bibi in her
house or not?

As is evident from the record, the occurrence was
taken placed on 02.2.2013 at 00.10 hours, whereas, it was
reported to the local police on 1.30 A.M. within the span of
1:20 hour and the concerned S.H.O. stated in his statement,
while appearing as PW-7 that when he reached to the spot,
Israrullah complainant was present in the house alongwith
bodies of the deceased and lodged the report in the shape of
Murasala Ex. PA/1. When other prosecution’s witnesses Gul
Nasib and Latif-ur-Rahman, fathers of the deceased, recorded
their statements as PW-2 and PW-4 respectively stated in
their cross-examinations that the village wherein the alleged
crime has been committed was situated at considerable
distance from their village .ie. 30/40 miles and can be
covered through vehicle within 1 % to 2 hours. Certainly no
plausible reason has been established by the defence to

indicate why the complainant/sole-eyewitness of the
occurrence would charge the appellant by leaving the real
culprits. Besides, keeping in view, the distance between the
two villages, it is not appealable to common sense that in
such a short span of time the complainant would come from
his far-flung village and will identify himself in the crime
village as an eyewitness of the alleged occurrence, so, the
testimony of this sole- eyewitness is natural and convincing
one and it statement finds ample corroboration from other
evidence produced by the prosecution. Even otherwise, he
was put to lengthy and searching cross-examination by the
defence, but nothing detrimental to the cause of prosecution
has been come out from his mouth, which could show that
the occurrence has not been taken placed on the mode and
manner as alleged by the prosecution or for that matter he
alongwith his cousin have not visited the house of the
deceased Mst. Sharafat Bibi. There exist no previous ill-will
between the parties and the convict-appellant had committed
the double murder on the pretext that he was suspected that
the deceased were having illicit relations and it seems that he
committed murder of the deceased in sudden provocation, as
both the deceased were cousin interse and aged about 17 to
20 years, moreso, it is not a rare phenomenon to visit the
house of married cousin alongwith her brother and it is also

comes within the domain of our tradition that whenever the
10

close relatives .i.e. brothers and cousins visited the house of
married sister, she used to come and meet the guests and also
to serve meal, tea or to do other routine works. From the
above testimony of the prosecution witnesses it is established
that the complainant was present at the place of occurrence
along with the deceased.

13. Adverting to the question that whether the
deceased were in compromising position or not?

Evidence on the face of record reveals that the
occurrence took place at the odd hours of the night in a house
wherein two persons lost their lives on the ground that they
were found in compromising position with each other. In
support of his plea, the appellant stated in his confessional
statement that his sister-in-law conveyed him information
about the alleged act of indulgence of sexual intercourse by
Mst. Sharafat Bibi with a guest, wherefater, he went to the
spot duly armed with deadly weapon and fired upon the
deceased, who tried to decamp from the spot, but could not
do so and after receiving firearm injuries died at the spot.

14. When, we put the above-referred stance of
appellant into juxtaposition with the evidence produced by
the prosecution, it transpired that the deceased were
examined by Doctor Jamil Khan, PW-6 and during

examination of bodies of the deceased, he has taken swabs
11

for chemical examination from both of the deceased, which
were sent to F.S.L. and the reports received whereof are in
negative. Likewise, it is in the evidence that when the I.O.
has taken into possession blood stained garments/clothes of
the deceased, which were having corresponding cut marks,
meaning thereby, that at the time of occurrence both the
deceased were wearing the clothes. So, the plea of appellant,
which he has taken in his confessional statement to the effect
that his sister-in-law informed him that Mst. Sharafat Bibi
lying in blanket with a guest and she is indulged in sexual
activity, could not be proved on record in shape of
circumstantial evidence, as when the deceased were brutally
murdered they were dressed up and moreso, the result of their
swabs tests were also received in negative.

15. The learned trial court mainly relied upon the
testimony of the eye witness/star witness i.e complainant
Israrullah. It is now well settled that conviction could be
based on testimony of a single witness if court is satisfied
that witness is reliable. The court has to go with the quality
and not with the quantity of evidence necessary for proving
or disproving a fact and particular number of witnesses is not
required for the proof of any fact and the same can be
produced by a single witness under the Provisions of Art. 19

(2) (b) of Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. Wisdom is

12

derived from Faroog Khan's case reported in 2008 SCMR

917 and Muhammad Mansha vs. the State, reported in 2001

SCMR 199.

16. Now adverting to the very moot question of
retracted confession made by appellant/convict before the
Judicial Magistrate.

The record reveals that just after the occurrence the
accused/appellant was arrested on 2.2.2013 and during
preliminary investigation he professed his guilt before the
1.0. So, on the next date .i.e. 3.2.2013, he was produced
before Mr. Shah Faisal, Learned Judicial Magistrate, PW—5,
who recorded his confessional statement. For the sake of
convenience, confessional statement of the appellant/convict

is reproduced as under:

A casual glance at the above quoted confessional

statement of the appellant/convict would show that there is
no missing link in the chain of available circumstances and it
seems that the confession made by accused/appellant is not
only voluntary, without any duress, inducement, coercion but
also based on truth and it is immaterial that he has later on
retracted from such confession. The apex court has held in
1992 SCMR 950 that:

“No basic difference exists between confession
or a retracted confession, if the element of truth
is not missing and it is always a question of fact
which is to be adjudged by the courts on the
attending circumstances of a particular case.
When an accused has given an account of the
incident and its truth is not doubted and such
statement is proved to be correct in all its parts,
such solitary piece of evidence can be used
against the accused without any further
corroboration. Where the — confessional
statement of the accused is found to be true and
voluntary, conviction can be recorded on such

statement”

Same view has been adopted by august Federal Shariat Court
in the cases reported in 1998 MLD 944 and 2013 P.Cr.L.J
1288. In the case reported in PLD 1995 Supreme Court

336, the apex court has observed that as against the maker
14

himself his confession, judicial or extra judicial, whether
retracted or nor retracted can in law validly form the sole
basis of his conviction if the court is satisfied and believes
that it is “true and voluntary” and was not obtained by torture
or coercion or inducement.

In case titled Wasair Khan vs. The State

reported in 1989 SCMR 446, the apex Court rejected the plea
that retracted confession was not sufficient in law to maintain
conviction and held that there was no legal bar for recording
conviction on a confession which was subsequently retracted
if it was voluntary and true. Similarly, in a case of Mst.

Nasreem_ Akhter v.s_the State ,1999 SCMR_ 1744, it was

reiterated that conviction for a capital offence could be
sustained on the basis of a retracted confession alone
provided it was voluntary and true and the Courts as a rule of
prudence, look for its corroboration by other reliable
evidence. It was further observed that any lapse on the part of
the Magistrate in recording a confession may not be fatal as
to its evidentiary value provided the court was satisfied that
the lapse on his part had not, in any way, adversely affected
its voluntariness or truthfulness. In a case Suleman_vys.
The State 2006 SCMR 366, it has been held that the judicial

confession alone if it is found true, convincing and made
15

voluntarily without any duress or coercion, the same can be
made basis for conviction.

17. No doubt, the convict-appellant has retracted from
his confessional statement but the same would not lose its
value for the mere reason that it was retracted. In a case titled

Tarig Hussain Shah vs. The State 2003 SCMR 938, it has

been held that retracted confession of accused when

confidence inspiring alone is sufficient for conviction.

18. The above cited case laws make the proposition
fully established that the confessional statement, even if
retracted subsequently, but found to be voluntary and true and
is supported some corroborative material, the same can solely
be made basis for conviction.

19. In the case in hand on the basis of available
circumstances it has established beyond any reasonable doubt
that confession of accused recorded on the very next day of his
custody is not only voluntary, without any duress and
inducement but is also based on truth which is also
corroborated by recoveries of empties of 7.62 bore from the
venue of crime and weapon of offence .i.e. Kalashnikov (P1) at
the pointation of accused/appellant alongwith statement of sole
eyewitness of the occurrence and other trustworthy evidence
produced by the prosecution. Moreover, the said empties

recovered from the spot and the weapon of offence were sent
16

to F.S.L. for opinion of fire-arm expert and as per FSL report,
Ex. PZ/3, received in positive, 17 empties were found fired
from SMG rifle No. 3838, while same rifle is 7.62 bore
(foreign made). Thus, the prosecution fully established guilt of
the accused/appellant through positive F.S.L reports in respect
of empties effected from the spot and weapon of offence i.e.
Kalashnikov recovered on his pointation.

20. Apart from the above, the medico-legal reports
furnished by Doctor Jamil Khan, PW-6 also fully supports the
version of prosecution, wherein, it has been mentioned that the
deceased were done to death through firearm injuries and the
entry wounds on the persons of both the deceased were of
same dimension.

21. Thus, in wake of the above discussion, we are clear
in mind that the prosecution fully established the guilt of
convict-appellant, who is singularly charged for firing at both
the deceased. There is no possible reason to believe that the
complainant party would let-free the real culprit and involve
the present appellant, because substitution in place of the real
culprit, in any case, is rare phenomenon. Nothing has been
brought on record to show that the occurrence has not taken
place in the mode and manner as alleged by the prosecution.
Therefore, taking into consideration the above evidence, we

are convinced to hold that the conclusion drawn by the learned
17

Trial Court regarding the guilt of appellant in the commission
of above offence is based on sound and cogent reasons.

22. For what has been discussed above, we do not find
any merits in the appeal in hand on the question of guilt of the
appellant, therefore, the judgment of conviction and sentence
recorded by the learned Trial Court is maintained and this appeal
is hereby dismissed. Similarly, the Murder Reference No. 6 is
also answered in positive and death sentence is, thus, confirmed.

Announced.
