Cause of death: Injures to vital organs due to

Kind of weapon: firearm.

4. Initially all the accused including the
present appellant/convict went into hiding,
however, co-accused were arrested on
29.06.2015 and challan was put in Court for their
trial. Formal charge was framed against them on
14.11.2015 to which they did not plead guilty
whereas the present appellant was proceeded u/s
512, Cr.P.C and prosecution was directed to lead
its evidence in his absence, thus, prosecution
examined Taj Muhammad, complainant Yousaf
Khan and Gul Zamin Khan as PW-1 to PW-3
respectively. On arrest of the present
appellant/convict on 23.07.2018, supplementary
challan was put in Court and he was formally
indicted for the offence. On his not pleading
guilty to the formal charge, the learned trial
Court directed the prosecution to produce its
evidence against all the accused alongwith re-
examination of the PWs already examined in

absence of the appellant/convict. Prosecution

oe: Hon'ble Mr. lustice ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
' -3-

examined twelve witnesses in support of its case
and closed the evidence. During examination w/s
342, Cr.P.C, the appellant and his co-accused
denied the allegation of prosecution, however,
they neither recorded their own statements on
oath nor produced any witness in their defense.
On conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court
vide impugned judgment acquitted co-accused
Sarfaraz, Ibrahim and Alam Khan whereas
convicted the present appellant for the murder of
deceased and sentenced him in the manner
already discussed in the earlier part of this
judgment, hence, this appeal.

3. ’ We have heard the arguments of
learned counsels for the parties including the
learned Assistant A.G. and perused the record

with their able assistance.

6. It is the case of prosecution against
the present appellant that he committed murder
of his wife Mst. Miraj Bibi inside his house due
to strained relations. Although the complainant,
at the time of lodging report, had also charged

co-accused Sarafarz, Ibrahim and Alam Khan but

the role of effective firing was attributed only to
the present appellant. According to prosecution
version, the occurrence was witnessed ‘by
complainant Yousaf Zada, Muhammad Zada and
Taj Muhammad who had gone to the house of
appellant for reconciliation between the spouses
as the relations between them were not cordial.
Complainant Yousaf Zada appeared before the
trial Court as PW-Al1 and reiterated in his
examination-in-chief the contents of his report.
The other eye witness Muhammad Zada was
produced as PW-A2. He also supported the
allegation against the present appellant by stating
that he had gone to the house of appellant
alongwith complainant and PW Taj Muhammad
for patching up the matter between the spouses
during which the appellant committed murder of
his wife through firing. It is noteworthy that
initially PW Taj Muhammad was examined as
PW-1 whereas the complainant was examined as
PW-2 on commencement of trial against the co-
accused, however, after arrest of the appellant

and commencement of joint trial against all the

oa; Mon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
-7-
accused including the present appellant/convict,
PW Taj Muhammad was abandoned. No doubt,
the complainant and other eye witnesses are
residents of village Kohan which is at a walking
distance of 40/45 minutes from village Manzai
where the occurrence took place, however, the
complainant has explained that he and other eye
witnesses were present in the house of appellant
for the purpose of compromise between his sister
and her husband. This version of the
complainant, being in accordance with the
prevailing customs in the area for patching up
domestic resolutions, stands to reason, as such,
their presence on the spot at the time of
occurrence could not be doubted. The statements
of both the eye witnesses i.e PW-A] and PW-A2
support each other on material particular of the
occurrence and their testimony could not be
shattered despite lengthy cross-examination. No
doubt, both the PWs are closely related to
deceased being her real brother and real uncle
respectively but their testimony, which is

otherwise trustworthy and confidence inspiring,

Tajamuyes*|

os: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag brahim
Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
-8-
cannot be discarded mere on the ground that they
are closely related to deceased. It is not a rule of
universal application that a person not related to
deceased will always speak the truth and a
witness closely related to the deceased will
necessarily tell lie in his favour rather it is the
intrinsic worth of the evidence of a witness
which is required to be considered and his
relation with the deceased would not come in the
way of his evidence. Wisdom is drawn from

“Abid Ali and 2 others Vs. The State” reported as

2011 SCMR 208. The rule laid down in the said

judgment is as under:

21. To believe or disbelieve a witness all
depends upon intrinsic value of the statement
made by him. Even otherwise, there cannot be
universal principle that in every case
interested witness shall be disbelieved or
disinterested witness shall be believed. It all
depends upon the rule of prudence and
reasonableness to hold that a particular
witness was present on the scene of crime and
that he is making true statement. A person
who is reported otherwise to be very honest,
above board and very respectable in society if
gives a statement which is illogical and
unbelievable, no prudent man despite his
nobility would accept such statement.

Z Admittedly, deceased Mst. Miraj Bibi

her murder inside his house as per prosecution
version. The Investigating Officer Salahuddin S.I
(PW-5A) has collected blood stained sand as well as
seven crime empties of 30 bore and a bullet-hit
silver bowl from the room where the occurrence
took place. The recovery memos in this regard are
available on record as Ex.PW-5/2 to Ex.PW-5/4
respectively. One of the marginal witnesses thereof
namely Anwar Zada was produced as PW-11] in
support of the said recoveries who has supported the
same in his statement and nothing could be from him
on the record during his cross-examination to create
a doubt regarding the genuineness of the recovery
memos. Moreso, both the eye witnesses have stated
in their cross-examination that they alongwith
abandoned witness Taj Muhammad were present
inside the room of deceased and they were sitting on
a mat at the time of conversation whereafter the
occurrence took place. Thus, the place of occurrence
i.e a room in the appellant’s house is established. No
doubt, the prime duty of proving its case against an
accused lies on prosecution but in cases like the
present one when husband is charged for the murder
of his wife and vice versa, responsibility lies on the

surviving party to explain that what had happened to

them. In the present case, the wife was done to death
through firing; the appellant, being her husband,
neither shifted her to hospital for saving her life nor
he reported the incident to police rather he went
abroad soon after the occurrence and made his entry
to Pakistan after three long years. Likewise, neither
he has recorded his statement on oath to raise the
plea that he was not present in his house at the time
of occurrence nor he has uttered a single word in this
regard during his examination u/s 342, Cr.P.C. Even
the defense has not put a single suggestion to this
effect while cross-examining the PWs to cast a
shadow of doubt on his presence in the house at the
time of occurrence. The above conduct of the
appellant and his silence to explain that what had
happened to his wife, have made his position very
much suspicious which has lightened the burden of
prosecution to a great extent. The Court can take
notice of such situation under Article 122 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 which reads:

122. Burden of proving fact especially within
knowledge. When any fact is especially within
the knowledge of any person the burden of
proving that fact is upon him.

Keeping in view the fact that the
appellant was husband of the deceased and only he

could better explain the occurrence which had taken

DB: Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim
‘hie Mr, a o

place inside his house. In absence of any evidence
on his behalf to the effect that he was away from his
house at the time of occurrence, his failure to
explain his position with regard to non-fulfillment of
his responsibility to protect his wife from the
aggression she had faced, casts a doubt on him.
Guidance in this regard is sought from judgment of
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of
Saeed Ahmad Vs. The State reported as 2015 SCMR
710 wherein it was held that:

8. In criminal cases it is for the prosecution to
establish its case against an accused. It is a
fundamental principle of law that the burden
of proof is on the prosecution (Article 117 of
the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984).
However, in this case the young wife of the
appellant, who was living with him, was
murdered. The appellant did not participate
in her last rites and disappeared for a period
of two months. The question that needs
consideration is whether such unreasonable
conduct of the appellant is of any consequence
and also whether certain matters exclusively
within his knowledge were not explained by
him, that is, not informing the police about his
wife's murder, not taking her to the hospital,
not participating in her last rites and
disappearing for a long period of two months.

& The case of prosecution is also
supported by medical evidence. According to
medical report Ex.PW-7/l, there are 06 entry
wounds on the body of deceased which means that it

was a clear cut case of gatl-e-amd. No doubt, in

Tajamul/PS* |

OB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim

Tajamul/Ps®:

-12-

cases where medical evidence is doubtful with
regard to the nature of death as homicide or suicide,
in such like situation the benefit can be given to the
inmates of the house but in this particular case the
injuries referred above lead us to an irresistible
conclusion that it was a case of homicide. The 1.0
has also recovered seven empties of 30 bore and
three damaged bullets from the room where the
deceased was done to death through firing. The
contents of site plan and statements of eye witnesses
also support each other and no conspicuous disparity
could be found between the ocular account and site
plan. According to FSL report Ex.PW-5/8, the blood
recovered from the spot has matched with the blood
on the clothes of deceased secured by 1.0 during
investigation. Although the crime weapon has not
been recovered in the present case but non-recovery
of crime weapon in view of abscondence of the
appellant/convict for more than three years is not
harmful to the prosecution case because recovery of
crime weapon after such long period could not
expected. Reliance is placed on Khalida Bibi Vs.

Nadeem Baig (PLD 2009 Supreme Court 440)

wherein it was observed by Hon’ble apex Court that:

DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr Justicn Wigar Ahmad
-13-

8. As régards the second ground that found
favour with the learned High Court related to
the non-recovery of the weapon of offence, it is
also not available to the accused for the reason
that he remained absconder for a considerable
period of time and even did not surrender
despite cancellation of his hail by the High
Court as well as by the Sessions Judge.

Though there is another lapse on the
part of prosecution, as argued by learned counsel for
the appellant, of non-sending of crime empties to
FSL for determination of the number of crime
weapons used in the occurrence, however, in light of
the above discussion on ocular account and the
unexplained conduct of the present appellant as
husband of the deceased who had met an unnatural
death inside his house, the prosecution could not be
penalized for the above lapse of the Investigating

Officer. Wisdom is drawn from the judgment of the

- august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of

Ansar_Mehmood Vs. Abdul Khaliq and another

reported as 2011 SCMR 713 wherein it was held

that:
Should a complainant suffer for the fault of
the prosecution, who was negligent in
discharging duties and functions? Answer
should be, readily, in negative.

a. Learned counsel for the appellant also

objected delay in lodging the FIR by questioning not

only presence of the complainant on the spot but
also contended that the appellant was charged in the
case after consultation and deliberation. Presence of
the complainant on the spot at the time of occurrence
has already been discussed in detail, therefore, there
is no need of further discussion on the said point. So
far his objection with regard to nomination of the
appellant/convict after consultation is concerned, the
record shows that the parties are related with each
other and the occurrence had taken place inside the
house of the appellant where the parties had
gathered for resolution of dispute between the
appellant and deceased. We have already believed
the version of complainant that he was present at the
time when his sister was shot dead by the present
appellant, therefore, in the circumstances when there
was no apprehension of mistaken identity of the
assailant, the delay caused in lodging the report
would not damage the prosecution case most
particularly when nothing has been brought on the

record to suggest false implication of the appellant

‘on the basis of ill-will or mala fide. Guidance is

sought from the judgment of the august Supreme

Court in the case of Ayaz Ali Shah Vs. The State

Tajamul/Ps*

DB; Hon’ble Mr. justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon‘ble Mr justice Wigar Ahmad

Tajamul/PS*

-15-
reported as 1997 SCMR 1296 wherein view of this
Court was confirmed in the following words:

12, We find that there was no delay in lodging
the report so as to cast any shadow of doubt
on the integrity of the prosecution case.
Nonetheless, the question of delayed report
came up for consideration before Peshawar
High Court in Mir Aftab v. The State (PLD
1981 Peshawar 23) which was approved by
this Court, wherein it was held that the
question of delayed report would be material
only if there was any doubt about the name of
the culprit. In the instant case, there was no
doubt about the two culprits, particularly the
petitioner because the occurrence had taken
place in broad daylight in the Bazar of the
village and, therefore, chances of substitution,
in the circumstances of the case, were quite
remote. Besides, 'the learned counsel for the
petitioner has not been able to pinpoint any
animus for the false charge against the
petitioner.

10. In addition to above, the appellant went
abroad soon after the occurrence and returned to
Pakistan after more than three years. He has offered
no explanation except the bald statement that he had
gone there for earning his livelihood. Thus, his long
and unexplained abscondence further corroborates
his involvement in commission of the offence.

il. The complainant has stated that
relations of the appellant with the deceased were
strained. Although prosecution has produced no

evidence in this regard, however, the complainant,

OB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice tshtlaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr, Justice Winer Ahmad
-16-
while recording his statement as PW-Al, has
explained in his cross-examination that:

It is evident from the above narrations
of the complainant that there was a dispute regarding
a cow between the spouses and it appears that
because of the said motive the appellant shot dead
his wife through firing. Though the motive set up by
prosecution has not be been proved but it is settled
law that an accused cannot be acquitted on the sole
ground of absence of motive or failure of
prosecution to prove the same, however, the said gap
can be considered towards mitigation of the sentence
and the learned trial Court has already taken lenient

view while awarding the sentence of life

imprisonment to the appellant/convict. Reliance is

placed on State/Government_of Sindh through

Advocate-General, Sindh, Karachi Vs. Sobharo

(1993 SCMR__585). The Hon’ble apex Court

confirmed its former view by observing that:

Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wioar Ahmad

No ‘doubt absence or weakness of motive
would not come in the way of the case of
prosecution and can be condoned if there is
otherwise strong and reliable evidence in
support of the case. Reference can be made to
the case of Mushtaq Ahmed v. Muhammad
Siddiq and another (PLD 1975 SC 160).

12. In light of what has been discussed
above, no ground could be found for interference

in the impugned judgment which is well-

reasoned and based on proper appreciation of
law and evidence on record. Resultantly, this . fn

appeal, being devoid of merits, is accordingly

dismissed.
