2. The complainant Adar Khan being aggrieved
from the impugned judgment filed Cr.R. No. 43-B/2019, for

enhancement of sentence of appellant.

3. As both, the appeal and revision petition are the
outcome of one and the same judgment, are going to be

decided through this common judgment.

4. Brief facts of the case, as divulged from the first
information report Ex: PW 2/1, are that on 02.04.2017, at
17.00 hours, the complainant Adar Khan alongwith dead-
body of his brother Imran Khan, reported the matter at Civil
Hospital, Bannu, to the effect that he along with his brother
Musharaf Khan were riding on one motorcycle, whereas his
brother Imran Khan, on the other, were proceeding from
Bannu Bazaar to their village. Imran Khan was ahead of them,
when they reached near the road leading to Dandy Kala on
Miran Road, at about 16:00 hours, all of a sudden accused
Javed Khan, Amir Khan and Zahid Khan, armed with pistols
emerged and started firing at Imran Khan, as a result whereof,
he was hit, sustained injuries and fell down from the
motorcycle. Accused after commission of the offence
decamped from the spot. The injured Imran Khan succumbed
to his injuries at the spot. Motive for the offence alleged by

the complainant was previous blood feud. The report of the

3

complainant was reduced in shape of Murasila by the scribe
Raqiaz Khan ASI and sent to the Police Station through
constable Amjad Ali No.5712, while he prepared injury sheet
and inquest report of the deceased and sent the dead-body
under the escort of constable Ghufran No.5751 to the doctor
for postmortem examination, hence, the F.I.R (ibid). On
04.4.2017 accused was arrested by the local police, having in
his possession a 0.30 bore pistol along with a fitted and a
spare magazine. He was also booked for the offence under
section 15 Arms Act in case F.I.R No. 254, dated 04.04.2017,

Police Station Cantt:, Bannu.

5. After completion of investigation, complete
challan was submitted before the learned trial Court, where at
the commencement of trial, prosecution produced and
examined as many as twelve (12) witnesses, whereafter,
statement of accused was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C,
wherein he professed his innocence and false implication,
however, neither he wished to be examined on oath as
provided under section 340(2) Cr.P.C, nor opted to produce
defence evidence. Learned trial Court after hearing arguments
from both the sides, vide impugned judgment dated

29.05.2019 convicted the appellant and sentenced him, as

4

mentioned above. Hence, the instant criminal appeal as well

as connected criminal revision petition.

6. We have heard arguments of learned counsel for
the appellant and learned Addl: A.G representing the State
assisted by learned counsel for complainant and gone through

the record with their valuable assistance.

7. The unfortunate incident claimed the life of one
Imran Khan, while travelling in the company of the
complainant and another. The incident occurred on 02.04.217
at 16.00 hours, whereas the matter was reported to the local
police in the Civil Hospital, Bannu at 1700 hours. It was the
complainant, who while reporting the matter charged the
appellant alongwith the absconding co-accused for murder of
the deceased. The appellant was arrested on 04.4.2017, by the
local police of Police Station Cantt: and from his personal
possession a .30 bore pistol was taken into possession and an
F.1.R under the relevant section of law was registered. The
appellant was later on handed over to the Investigating
Officer of Police Station Mandan, who was investigating the
case against the accused/ appellant and during spot pointation,
when the appellant allegedly disclosed the weapon of offence
to be in possession of the police of Police Station Cantt, he

visited Police Station Cantt: and as such, a .30 bore pistol was

5

taken into possession; and in that respect, recovery memo was
prepared. The accused/ appellant after his arrest, faced trial
and ultimately the learned trial Court convicted the appellant
vide impugned judgment. The learned trial Court was pleased
to assess the matter from different angles and after applying
its judicial mind to the collected evidence on file, passed the
impugned judgment. Though the impugned judgment is
comprehensive in all respects, yet this being the Court of
appeal, we are under the obligation to assess and reassess the
already appreciated evidence, to know as to whether the
learned trial Court was justified in holding the appellant guilty
and that, as to whether the reasoning advanced by the learned
trial Court suits the situation; that as to whether the
prosecution succeeded in bringing home guilt against the
appellant, that too, by producing convincing and confidence
inspiring evidence. We are conscious of the fact that both the
sides involved in the episode are reaping the harvest of the
miseries created by them or created for them, and in order to
redress the grievance of either side, they are faced with, this
Court is under the bounded duty to approach the core issue by
adopting the parameters laid down for the purpose, so to
avoid miscarriage of justice. True, that the like incidents

bring the society at halt, but the outright dejection will further

6

deteriorate the prevailing situation, as there is always a ray of
hope and these are the Courts of law to discover the same, to
bring the parties to justice as, every dark cloud has a silver

lining.

8. The incident was reported by the complainant to
the local police, who soon after the incident shifted the dead-
body of the deceased to Civil Hospital, Bannu, where the
police of the local Police Station were already present. The
matter was reported at 17:00 hours, to one Raqiaz (PW-4),
who after drafting Murasila, prepared injury sheet and inquest
report, and thereafter, sent the dead-body to the mortuary for
postmortem examination. Though the dead-body was
examined by the doctor, yet the time of examination and
arrival of the dead-body does not find mention in the
postmortem report and it was later on disclosed by the doctor

that he examined the dead-body at 06.30 p.m.

9. The moot question for determination for this
Court is as to whether the witnesses, more particularly, the
complainant was present at the time of incident, and as to
whether the incident occurred in the mode, manner and at the
stated time. The complainant was examined as PW-8, who
stated that on the day of incident he was informed by the

deceased regarding the interest of a party in their shop, to

7

purchase and in order to negotiate the price, he alongwith
eyewitness went to the place where his shop was situated. The
complainant further stated that party who was interested in
purchase of their shop was Dawar, hailing from Waziristan.
He further stated that the matter was negotiated, but the
bargain could not be stuck between the parties. The record
tells that the only and only purpose of the complainant to visit
his brother, at Bannu, was the negotiation regarding the sale
of their shop, but the complainant admitted that it was not his
routine to visit, we deem it appropriate to appreciate this
particular aspect of the case in light of the collected evidence,
so to understand that presence of the complainant with the
deceased at the stated time was a natural phenomenon. We are
to look for independent evidence in this respect, as we are
conscious of the fact that, if complainant fails to convince us
in that respect, then in that eventuality, his status will
transform to that of a chance witness. The site-plan was
prepared at the instance of the complainant, where the
accused are shown at point No. 4, 5 and 6, with their
motorcycle left behind at point-D, whereas the deceased at
point-1, and his motorcycle at point-A. The complainant and
eyewitness are shown at points-2 and 3 with their motorcycle

at point-B. The record tells that the deceased was few paces

8

ahead while the complainant a few paces behind and that it
was at 16.00 hours, when the accused attracted to the spot and
fired at the deceased. It is pertinent to mention that the
deceased was the youngest, whereas the complainant was the
eldest, and that it was the complainant, who was charged for
the murder of the brother of absconding co-accused Zahid.
The complainant is to tell that when it was broad day light
and that when he was chasing the deceased with a distance of
few yards, then why the accused did not kill the complainant
and that why the deceased fell a prey. The complainant being
the real enemy would have been the prime target, but the lack
of interest in killing the complainant indicates his absence
from the spot at the time of incident. Had he been present he
would have been the prime target. The deceased was shown at

point-1, down the metal road ie. on Kacha Gola, and the

Investigating Officer recovered blood stained earth from there.

If the deceased was riding a motorcycle, then instead of
driving on the metal road, he would have not selected
unpaved path to drive on. The situation helps in making an
opinion that the deceased was on foot. It is interesting to note
that the Investigating Officer was examined as PW-10, who
stated that on arrival to the spot during spot inspection, he

took into possession blood-stained earth, three empties of .30

9

bore along with a motorcycle belonging to the deceased, in
the same breath he stated that he revisited the spot on the next
day of the incident and photography was made. It is
interesting to note that while making snap shots on the
following day of occurrence, the motorcycle is shown
standing there with the same registration number, left by the
deceased. The learned counsel for the appellant, during trial,
exhibited the same as PW 10/DX-1. The prosecution is to tell
that when Investigating Officer had already taken into
possession the motorcycle on the day of incident, then instead
of having been parked in the concerned Police Station, who
brought it to the spot and for what purpose. It indicates that at
the time and on the day of incident the deceased was not
riding on a motorcycle. The presence of the complainant, is
further doubted from the fact that the report was made at
17:00 hours, in the same hospital where the postmortem was
conducted, but the dead-body was examined at 06.30 p.m,
surprisingly, when report had already been made and the
injury sheet alongwith inquest report were prepared, then why
the postmortem examination was postponed till 06.30 p.m.
The delay caused in examining the dead-body when read in

juxtaposition with non-mentioning of time of arrival and

10

examination of dead-body in the postmortem report belies the

stance of the complainant.

In case titled ‘Nazir and others Vs. The State’

@LD 1962 S.C. 269), it was held that:-

“By what we said in Niaz v. The State we
were not laying down any rule of law though
we were explaining for the guidance of
Courts our own approach to the problem that
generally confronts the Courts in cases of
crime by violence. It is possible to lay down a
rule of law that a witness belonging to a
particular category is to be presumed to be
unworthy of credit without corroboration. In
the case of an accomplice such a rule has
already been accepted by the Courts. But we
had no intention of laying down an inflexible
rule that the statement of an interested
witness (by which expression is meant a
witness who has a motive for falsely impli-
cating an accused person) can never be
accepted without corroboration”.

10. Another intriguing aspect of the case is that
neither the complainant, nor the eyewitness identified the
dead-body before the police at the time of report and before
the doctor at the time of postmortem examination. The
witnesses cited in the column of identification, both in the
inquest and postmortem report belong to the village of the
deceased and it is for the prosecution to tell that who
informed them regarding arrival of the dead-body to the

hospital. The complainant when appeared before the trial

Court, stated that when they reached to the hospital, the

11

concerned police of Police Station was already present, to
whom the matter was reported. It adds to our anxiety, that
how the police of the concerned Police Station reached to the
hospital, when the dead-body was still on the way, and that
who informed them. The time spent between the report and
examination of the dead-body leaves no room to doubt that
the dead-body was taken from the spot by the people present
on the place of incident, and that it was after securing the
attendance of the complainant that the report was made. The
record further reveals that the distance between the place of
incident and Police Station is 9/10 kilometers, that too,
connected through a metal road, even then it took one hour to
reach there. We cannot ignore that soon after reporting the
matter, the complainant left the Police Station for the spot and
he reached to the spot at 06.35 p.m, the time when the dead-
body was still to be examined. The conduct of the witness is
unnatural, being real brothers, their first priority would have
been to attend the dead-body at the time of postmortem
examination. The Investigating Officer, when appeared before
the trial Court stated that after arrival to the spot the
complainant alongwith another person arrived there on
motorcycle. This witness further explained that the second

person, who arrived to the spot alongwith the complainant,
12

was not the eyewitness, and his this assertion further
discredited the testimony of the complainant, had the
eyewitness been present at the time of incident and at the time
of report, then he would have accompanied the complainant
during spot pointation, when the complainant was examined
before the trial Court numerous enmities with numerous
people of the locality were put to him, to which he did not
deny and in most of the enmities the complainant and his
family involved, were blood feud, hence, the possibility
cannot be excluded that it was doing of some unknown

accused.

11. The appellant was allegedly arrested on
04.4.2017 by the local police of Police Station Cantt;, Bannu,
from his possession a .30 bore pistol was recovered and a
separate F.I.R under section 15 Arms Act was registered. The
concerned police official from the Police Station Cantt: was
examined as PW-12, who stated that he arrested the
accused/appellant and prepared his card of arrest. The witness
categorically admitted that he did not mention the recovered
pistol alongwith ammunition in the card of arrest. He was
further examined as to whether after arrest of the appellant the
information was conveyed to the Police Station Mandan, he

replied in affirmative, it was on the following day that the
13

Investigating Officer, who was investigating the murder case,
came to the Police Station Cantt:. At this particular aspect of
the case, the Investigating Officer Mir Daraz Khan was
examined, who admitted that on the day of arrest he visited
the Police Station Cantt:, but it was on the following day
when the appellant was formally arrested in the present case,
when the accused was brought to the District Courts, but
when the two statements are read in juxtaposition, it smells
foul, despite the fact the appellant was arrested and a .30 bore
pistol was recovered from his possession, the Investigating
Officer of Police Station Mandan, did not take interest to rush
to the Police Station Cantt, there and then and to arrest the
accused, who was badly needed in the present case. This is
surprising that the Moharrir of the Police Station Cantt. did
not inform the Police Station Mandan and even the weapon of
offence was not handed over on the day when the appellant
was arrested. The Moharrir of the Police Station was
examined as PW-5, who stated that a .30 bore pistol with fit
and spare magazine along with 13 live rounds were handed
over to the Investigating Officer of the present case, which
were lying in the Malkhana of Police Station Cantt, who
sealed the same and recorded his statement under section 161

Cr.P.C. This witness was cross-examined, who admitted that
14

no application was submitted by Abdul Samad Khan to him
for sending the case property ie. 0.30 bore pistol
No.31035024 to the Arms Expert. He further admitted that on
04.4.2017, the pistol was handed over to him in unsealed
condition, and that the entries were made in the relevant
Register of the case property i.e. Register No.19, of the Police
Station. He went on to say that he did not produce copy of the
said Register to the Investigating Officer of the present case,
this is surprising to note that PW-5 candidly conceded that he
did not give any documentary proof about the safe custody of
the recovered pistol from 04.4.2017 to 05.4.2017. The
circumstances do tell that neither the convict/appellant was
arrested in the manner nor the pistol was taken into
possession, rather it was a conscious attempt on the part of the
prosecution to generate evidence to connect the appellant with
commission of the offence, when the prosecution failed to
prove recovery of crime weapon and its safe custody, then in
that eventuality this piece of evidence cannot be taken into
consideration against the appellant. The apex Court has time
and again expressed its reservations on this particular aspect
of the case and we are fortified from the judgment reported as

‘Jehangir y. Nazar Farid and another 2002 SCMR_ 1986’,

wherein it has been held that:-
15

"The occurrence had taken place on

21.1.1996, Nazar Farid was arrested on

1.2.1996. The rifle in question had been

allegedly recovered from him on

12.2.1996 and it was at least 7 days

thereafter i.e. on 19.2.1996 that the

crime-empties in question had been

received in the Forensic Science

Laboratory. In the circumstances this

piece of evidence is not credible and is of

no assistance to the prosecution as

against Nazar Farid accused."
12. The medical evidence is in conflict with the
ocular account, as in the site-plan the deceased is shown at
point No.1, when he had nearly crossed the accused and in
that eventuality, the deceased must have received firearm
entry from his right to left or on his back with its exit on the
front, but the situation is otherwise. True, that medical
evidence is confirmatory in nature and equally true that in
presence of the direct eyewitness account, it has a little
significance but, here it speaks to the contrary. In the present
case, as the witnesses failed to prove their presence on the
spot and their statements are not trustworthy being chance
witnesses, so it is the medical evidence that steers the wheel,
and the conflict between the two has spoiled the prosecution

case to a greater extent. Reference may be made to case law

reported as 2011 SCMR 323 ‘Amin Ali and another Vs. The

State and 2019 SCMR 1306 ‘Mansab Ali Vs. the State’.

16

13. The motive was stated to be the blood-feud
between the parties, but the Investigating Officer failed to
collect either documentary or oral evidence in that respect and
even the complainant failed to substantiate the same. The
complainant himself is uncertain regarding his enmities, as
admittedly his family was involved in several blood feud with
different people and to fix the responsibility on a single side is
next to impossible, that too when complainant was spared as
he should have been the prime target, there is no cavil with
the proposition that the prosecution is not under obligation to
prove the motive and even its weakness or absence will not
damage the prosecution case, but we cannot ignore that once
the prosecution alleges motive, then it is under obligation to
prove the same, if it did not, then it is only and only the
prosecution to suffer. The complainant failed to connect the
appellant with the alleged motive, so we cannot hold
otherwise, but that is the prosecution to suffer. In case titled

"Muhammad Ashraf alias Acchu Vs. The State" (2019

SCMR 652), it was held that:-

"7. The motive is always a double-edged
weapon. The complainant Sultan Ahmad
(PW9) has admitted murder enmity
between the parties and has also given
details of the same in his statement
recorded before the trial court. No doubt,
previous enmity can be a reason for the
appellant to commit the alleged crime, but

17

Vv it can equally be a reason for the
complainant side to falsely implicate the
appellant in this case for previous
grouse."

14. The cumulative effect for what has been stated
above, leads this Court to an inescapable conclusion that the
prosecution failed to bring home guilt against the appellant
and that the impugned judgment is the outcome of haste and
without application of judicial mind to the collected evidence
on file, which calls for interference, resultantly, the instant
criminal appeal is allowed, impugned judgment is set aside
and the appellant is acquitted of the charge levelled against
him. He be set-at-liberty forthwith, if he is not required to be
detained in any other criminal case. Since we have set aside

the conviction and sentence awarded to the appellant by the

trial Court, so, the connected Criminal Revision No.43-

B/2019 stands dismissed.
15. Above are the detailed reasons of our short of
even date. 5 Y
