QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- Having been
convicted under Section 5 _ Explosive
Substances Act and sentenced to five years
R.| and also convicted under Section 7 ATA,
1997, and sentenced to five years R.I by the
learned Judge, Anti Terrorism Court-ll,
Peshawar, vide impugned judgment/order
dated 15.05.2017, the convict/appellant, Sher
Rehman son of Fazal-ur Rehman resident of

Utmanzai, Charsadda, preferred the instant
appeal for setting aside the impugned
judgment as well as his conviction and
sentences awarded to him by the learned trial
Court in case vide FIR No.93 dated
18.07.2016 under Sections 5 Explosive
Substances Act and 7 ATA, 1997,Police
Station CTD, Peshawar.

2. The case was registered on the report
of Muhammad Qayyum, Inspector P.S CTD
Peshawar/complainant who, while purportedly
acting on a prior information of intelligence
wing, laid a barricade on ring road near Achini
Cross and found a person coming on foot
from the Tribal Territory, in suspicious
condition, who reportedly tried to flee, but
was overpowered and a cloth bag wrapped in
another cloth/chaddar containing two green
colour plastic bottles was recovered, showing
some suspected wires in the bottles, which
were shifted along with the accused, who
disclosed his name as Sher Rehman son of
Fazal ur Rehman resident of Utmanzai,

Charsadda, P.S CTD, and BDU staff was
summoned, who’ defused the explosive
material, weighing 4 1/2 kilograms, with nut
bolts, two non-electric detonators, prima card
measuring 4 feet and safety fuse measuring 5
feet, which were, allegedly, sealed; and
murasila drafted by complainant/Inspector
was sent to the P.S for registration of the
case.

3. Although, the alleged recovery was
made at 1030 hours on 18.07.2016, but the
recovered so called explosive material were
sent to the Incharge BDU for opinion/report
vide application dated 19.07.2016; which
were, however, received by the Assistant
Inspector General of Police BDU Special
Branch, KPK, Peshawar, on 29.07.2016 i.e.
ten days after their dispatch. Anyhow, on the
application dated 22.09.2016 of the Inspector
P.S CTD, the articles mentioned in the
application were destroyed, by the officials of
Bomb Disposal Squad under the supervision
of learned Judicial Magistrate-Il, Peshawar, on

27.09.2016. After completion of investigation,
complete challan was submitted in the trial
Court.

4. After framing of formal charge by the
learned trial Court/Judge ATC-II, Peshawar, to
which the accused/appellant pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial, the prosecution
produced a total of 8 PWs, including seizing
officer, Muhammad Qayyum _ Inspector
(PW.1); marginal witness Muhammad Ayaz SI
(PW2); Member of BDU staff Irshad Ali Sl
(PW3); 1.0 Hastam Khan Inspector (PW.6);
Judicial Magistrate-Il, Peshawar, Ghulam
Hamid (PW7) and AIG BDU KPK, Mr.Shafqat
Malik (PW8), besides a couple of formal
witnesses of CTD staff; where-after, statement
of the accused was recorded under Section
342 Cr.P.C, wherein, he refuted charges of
the prosecution against him, but declined to
be examined on oath or produce defence
evidence.

5. On the conclusion of trial, the learned
trial Court/Judge ATC-Il, Peshawar, heard

arguments of learned PP and learned counsel
for the accused, and rendered the impugned
judgment, thereby convicting the
appellant/accused and awarding him the
sentences, mentioned hereinabove; hence the
instant appeal.

6. Arguments of learned counsel for the
convict/appellant and learned AAG heard; and
record perused.

7. It may be observed, at the very outset,
that all the witnesses of the prosecution are
not only police officials but they are also from
the same CTD Peshawar; of course, with the
exception of Ghulam Hamid, Judicial
Magistrate-I| Peshawar (PW7), but only a
witness to the destruction of the case
property, and Mr. Shafgat Malik AlG BDU
KPK (PW8), though not from CTD Peshawar,
but nevertheless a Senior Police Officer. No
doubt, police officials are as good witnesses
as anyone else may be, as aptly observed by
the learned trial Court, but their testimony for
conviction is to be accepted with great care

and caution, and discrepancies/contradictions
in their testimony is to be keenly observed and
the benefit of any such
discrepancies/contradictions, invariably,
extended to the accused; which is even
otherwise the cherished principle of criminal
justice system.

8. Moreover, it sounds something strange
that a person would enter settled area from
T.T after covering distance of 2 to 3 K.M on
foot while carrying a cloth bag wrapped in
another cloth/chaddar containing explosive
material weighing more than 4/5 kilograms.
Besides, there are two more striking feature of
the case, which cannot be so conveniently
overlooked. The so-called explosive material,
allegedly recovered on 18.07.2016, was
dispatched to the Incharge BDU, KPK,
Peshawar vide application dated 19.07.2016,
and received in the office of AIG BDU on
29.07.2016, without any evidence with regard
to the safe custody of the articles during the

intervening period.
9. Apart from the above unexplained
delay in sending the explosive material to
Incharge BDU, KPK, Peshawar, for
opinion/report, thus casting doubt on the
report of Incharge BDU, there was another
damaging aspect of the case of prosecution,
which was overlooked by the learned trial
Court while convicting the appellant/accused
and awarding him the impugned sentences.
The complainant/Inspector (PW1)_ himself
stated in his statement before the Court that
“the explosive material was blasted on the
spot by the BDU official for defusing’, if so,
what was then inspected by the Incharge BDU
and what was later on destroyed by the BDU
official under the Supervision of Learned
Judicial Magistrate-Il, Peshawar (PW/7).
Obviously, it was not simple defusing of the
explosive material, as sound of explosion was
heard by the complainant and his. staff
present at a distance of 40 to 50 paces. It is
also a fact, admitted by the marginal witness

Muhammad Ayaz (PW2), that recovery memo
and murasila were prepared after defusing i.e.
blasting. The above referred admissions on
the part of the PWs assume importance for
the case in favour of the defence in the light of
statement of SI BDU Irshad Ali (PW3) to the
effect that there was difference between
defusing and destruction/exploding/blasting of
the IED, (allegedly recovered from the
appellant/accused). Besides, nothing was
brought on the record to show either
departure or arrival of complainant/Inspector
and his staff in the P.S. Likewise, no entry
was made in the relevant register (Register
No.19), showing receipt of the explosive
material by the Muharrir and dispatch of the
same to Incharge BDU. Even if the explosive
material was destroyed, no explanation is
forthcoming for not producing and exhibiting
in the Court the cloth/chaddar and the cloth
bag, allegedly, containing the explosive
material. It is also an admitted fact that there
were shops as well as residential property

near the place of alleged recovery, but not
even an attempt seems to have been made by
the | complainant/Inspector to procure
attendance of witness/witnesses from the
general public to lend credence to the
recovery of the so-called incriminating articles
from the possession of the appellant/accused,
despite prior information received by the
complainant/Inspector about transportation of
explosive material from T.T to the settled
area. Furthermore, nothing was brought on
record to establish nexus of _ the
appellant/accused with a terrorist
organization.

10. To say the least, these glaring
discrepancies should not have escaped notice
of the learned trial Court while convicting the
appellant/accused and awarding him the
impugned sentences. Therefore, the
impugned judgment as well as conviction and
sentences awarded to the appellant/accused
are not sustainable in law, and ought to be set
aside. Consequently, the appeal is accepted,

and the impugned judgment of the learned
trial Court as well as conviction of the
appellant/accused and sentences awarded to
him by the learned trial Court are set aside.
The appellant is acquitted of the charges
while extending him the benefit of doubt; and

be set free forthwith if not required in any

other case.
