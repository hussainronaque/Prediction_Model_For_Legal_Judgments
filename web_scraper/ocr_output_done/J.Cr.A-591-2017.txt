JUDGMENT

FRR RK

AHMAD ALT, J. Questioned herein is the judgment of
learned Sessions Judge/Judge, Special Court, Hangu, dated
16.05.2017, whereby appellant Multan Jan was convicted
and sentenced to life imprisonment with fine of
Rs.200,000/ in case FIR No.315 dated 08.04.2015
registered against him u/s 9© CNSA, 1997 at Police

Station, City (District Hangu).

2. Brief facts of the case are that complainant/Fazal
Muhammad ASI/PW2 alongwith other police officials,
during gusht received information that charas would be
smuggled from Hangu to Kohat. On this information, he
made Nakabandi at Raeesan Bazaar on main Kohat-Hangu
Road and at about 20:30 pm, a white colour motor car
(Probox) bearing registration No. WK-997/Islamabad

arrived from Hangu side which was stopped. The driver
alongwith one person was found suspected. The driver
disclosed his name as Muhammad Hakeem while the other
person disclosed his name as Multan Jan (present
appellant). Search of the vehicle resulted into recovery of
12 kgs charas from secret cavities of the car contained in
10 packets of 1200/1200 grams each. Out of the recovered
contraband 10/10 grams were separated for chemical
analysis of FSL, remaining stuff was sealed in another
parcel. The Contraband and vehicle along with its
registration book were taken into possession vide recovery
memo Ex.PW1/1. On the basis of murasila Ex.PA/1, FIR
(Ex.PA) was registered against the accused-appellant.

2. On completion of investigation, challan was
submitted in Court where the appellant was charge-sheeted
to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The
prosecution in order to prove its case, produced and
examined as many as five witnesses whereafter statement
of the accused was recorded, wherein, he professed his
innocence. The learned Trial Court, after conclusion of
trial, found the appellant guilty of the charge and, while
recording his conviction, sentenced him as mentioned
above. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant has filed the instant

appeal before this Court.

3. Arguments heard and record gone through.
4. Allegation against the appellant is that he was

apprehended while setting in a car driven by acquitted co-
accused Muhammad Hakeem, having 12 kgs charas
recovered from its secret cavities.

5. For just decision of the instant case, a thorough
look at the testimony of evidence produced by the
prosecution is necessary. Particular portions of the
statement of PW-2 who is the Seizing
Officer/complainant in the instant case, are reproduced
below for ready reference:-

PW-2.....

“The motorcar was searched by me
During search, from the rear portion
and the cavities which were made on
the sides of motor car, 10 packets of
charas were recovered. Presently, I do
not recollect the number of packets
which were recovered from each side of
the motor car but probable they were
5+5 from each sides.......... I handed
over the accused and charas in the PS
along with motor car and then I left for
the spot again....... I have separated
10/10 grams of charas from each 10
packets while the remaining quantity
was packed/sealed by me in a separate
parcel, amounting to quantity 11900
grams in a separate parcel while the 10
separate parcels in connection with
FSL were also packed/sealed in a

separate parcel. ”
From the above statement, it is not clear that to whom the
seizing officer has handed over the recovered contraband
and samples in the police station being allegedly sealed in

separate parcels. Which were also, indeed, un-numbered.

PW-1 is Hussain Badshah No.20/FC who took the samples
to FSL for chemical analysis. This witness while appearing
as PW-1, deposed as under:

PW-1.....

“Moharrir of the PS handed over to me
10 parcels of sample containing 10/10
grams each, meant for FSL analysis on
receipt, which is ExPW1/1. I took the
parcels _of sample and handed over

the same to FSL authorities”.

XX... had gone to FSL laboratory
from the PS and had handed over the
parcels of sample. Apart from the case
property of the present case, the case
property of some other cases were also
handed over to the FSL Peshawar on
08.04.2015 for ascertaining the
opinion. I was entrusted with a copy of
FIR, recovery memo, site plan and
samples of the recovered charas by the
Moharrir of the PS when I was taking
the case property to FSL. I had handed
over the parcels of sample to FSL
Peshawar on 08.04.2015. No receipt
was handed over to me by the FSL
Peshawar in connection of receiving of

samples.”

Contrary to the above stated facts of PW-1, the FSL report
shows the date of receipt of samples, contained in parcels
No.1 to 10, as 16.04.2015. Such stance creates a serious
doubt in the prosecution case and also negates the stance of
PW-2/Seizing Officer/complainant as hinted above. Ilyas
Khan IHC, who is also witness to the recovery memo,
appeared as PW3 and deposed in his cross-examination as

under (relevant portion):-
fXXX ee Exactly I cannot tell the time

of our Nakabandi and arrival of motor
car.......first Fazal Muhammad ASI
had signalled the vehicle....... I cannot
tell that how much packets were taken
out from one side and how much from

another”

It has never been mentioned in the record or in any of the
statements of PWs that where the case property and
samples were kept when it was produced before the court
or the samples sent to FSL. Moharrir of the police station
in the present case would have been a handful witness to
the prosecution if examined, who would certainly depose

about the custody of narcotics and samples thereof.

6. In the present case against the appellant, the record
suggests that safe custody of the recovered substance, as
well as safe transmission of samples of the recovered
substance to the FSL, had not been established by the
prosecution. The Complainant/Seizing Officer/PW2 has
though deposed in his Court's statement that he took into
position the contraband, but it is not clear from his
statement that to whom he handed over the remaining
contraband. The complainant further deposed that he
prepared the samples for FSL, but from his statement, it is
not clear that to whom he handed over the case property
and samples in the police station. There is no record or

assertion that the samples and case property were ever kept
in Malkhana. Had it been, the Register No.19 would have
been examined. In this situation, the safe custody of the
samples and case property is not proved. In a case where
safe custody of the recovered substance or safe
transmission of samples of the recovered substance was
not proved by the prosecution through independent
evidence, it could not be concluded that the prosecution
had succeeded in establishing its case against the accused
beyond reasonable doubt. Guidance could be sought from
case law reported in 2019 SCMR 608. Similar views have

also been taken by the apex court in 2018 SCMR 2039, &

2019 SCMR 903.

7. Furthermore, the record is silent as to where
remained the samples and case property from 08.04.2015
to 16.04.2015 when it was received in FSL with a

considerable and unexplained delay of 8 days. In the case

titled “Ikramullah_and others Vs _the State reported in

2015 SCMR 1002” it has also been held by the apex Court
that;

“No such police official was produced before
Trial Court to depose about safe custody of
samples entrusted to him for being deposited
in office of Chemical Examiner---Prosecution
was not able to establish that after alleged
recovery of substance so recovered was either
kept in safe custody or that samples were
taken from recovered substance had safely
been transmitted to office of Chemical
Examiner without the same being tampered

with or replaced while in transit---Prosecution
failed to prove its case against accused

persons beyond reasonable doubt”
8. Although prosecution sought to corroborate
testimony of recovery witnesses with report of Forensic
Science Laboratory to the effect that contraband item
recovered from secret cavities were charas, yet sanctity of
report of Laboratory was eroded by evidence of official
who could not correctly reply as to where samples
remained between the dates when those were allegedly
taken into possession from car and the date those were
received by Forensic Science Laboratory. Prosecution had
failed to tender any plausible explanation for delay in
sending the samples for analysis. Case law refers to 2012

SCMR 577 & 2015 PCr.LJ 62.

7. In present case, where the recovery is doubtful and
safe custody of the recovered substance as well as safe
transmission of the samples thereof is not established by
the prosecution through cogent evidence, there it cannot
be said with confidence that the prosecution had proved
its case against the accused-appellant beyond reasonable
doubt.

8. Perusal of record further reveals that the accused-
appellant was convicted by the learned trial court on the
basis of an affidavit sworn by the accused during trial on
one hand and affirmative answer to the question at the

time of recording his statement u/s 342-Cr.P.C. on the
other hand. Bare perusal of the affidavit shows that
accused-appellant was in judicial custody on 02.05.2016
when the affidavit was scribed and also in judicial custody
when on 25.05.2016 the said affidavit was produced in the
Court. Affidavit has also not contained any stamp of jail
authorities, moreover, the Oath Commissioner,
Muhammad Amin, Advocate, was also not produced by
the prosecution who could explain that how he attested
the affidavit of accused-appellant when he was in judicial
lock-up. While relying on the statement of accused-
appellant recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, same is also
against the law because at the time of production of
accused before the Trial Court or Magistrate, he refused
his guilt and while framing of charge the accused-
appellant also did not plead guilty. Statement of the
accused-appellant was also recorded u/s 342 Cr.P.C. Once
on 25.05.2016 the accused-appellant has refused to be
examined on oath or to produce defence evidence, but
even then statement of DW-I Naveed Aslam was recorded
on 17.02.2017 and present accused-appellant Multan Jan’s
statement was recorded on 18.02.2017, but the accused-
appellant was again examined u/s 342 Cr.P.C on
11.04.2017 for reason best known to the learned Trial
Court same vitiated whole trial of the accused-appellant.
Even otherwise, section 242, 243 & 244 of the Cr.P.C

clearly depicts that once a formal charge is framed and put
to accused which is denied by him u/s 242 Cr.P.C,
provision of section 243 Cr.P.C shall “epso-facto”
become inoperative and court has to proceed u/s 242
Cr.P.C by recording the prosecution evidence as well as
of the accused, if led in defence. Confessional statement
made by the accused-appellant after 2/3 dates of hearing
after explicit denial of the charge at the time of framing
the same is of no legal effect in view of section 244, 265-
D, 265-E and 265-F Cr.P.C. So, when the accused pleads
guilty during course of trail, independent evidence should
be taken and conceded by the Court and no one should be
condemned and sentenced on a capital charge merely if he
pleaded guilty to the charge but some evidence must be
recorded which shall be taken in support of guilt of the
accused. Admission of the guilt could not be made sole
basis for sentencing accused. Reliance is placed on 2017

SCMR 713.

9. It has also been noted that Trial court recorded
statement of appellant on oath u/s 340(2) Cr.P.C. and he
re-affirmed his admission made in his statement under
section 342, Cr.P.C. about his guilt, although he never
opted for to record such statement. The learned Trial
Court also could not perceive the correct legal position
that, confession of accused as it has held it to be, if is
recorded on oath, becomes absolutely inadmissible in

evidence and for this reason alone, the same can be
10

discarded. For recording of confession, whether by a
Magistrate or the Trial Court, the procedure laid down
under the High Court Rules and Orders and the safeguards
provided under section 364, Cr.P.C. have to be essentially
followed. True, that under section 265-E, Cr.P.C. the Trial
Court in a session case, has discretion to record the plea of
the accused and if he pleads guilty to the charge, it may
convict him in its discretion. Nevertheless, it is also
provided in section 265-F, Cr.P.C. that if the Trial Court
does not convict him on his plea of guilt, it shall proceed
to hear the complainant (if any) and take all such evidence
as may be produced in support of the prosecution. This
discretion is to be exercised with extra care and caution,
and ordinarily on such admission, awarding capital
sentence shall be avoided and to prove the guilt of an
accused, evidence of the complainant or the prosecution
has to be recorded, in the interest of safe administration of

justice.

The most important factors and required standards of
confession may be cited below:-

"It should be ensured,

(i) hat the accused is in full senses and understands the
consequences of making a confession;

(ii) hat, the confession was not a result of any duress,
coercion or any promise by the prosecution, to be made an
approver;

(iil) hat, during transit of the accused by the police from
and to the Trial Court from the prison, on each "Paishi" no
threat or pressure was applied by the escorting police guard
or incharge thereof;

(iv) | what were the actual facts, which induced the accused
10.

11

to confess after facing trial, during which he pleaded
innocence all the way;

(v) the court recording the confession has to ensure that
the mental capacity of the accused is not diminished due to
any illness and if some indication of abnormality is suspected
by the Court, it is better to refer the accused to the Standing
Medical Board to ascertain the true cause thereof;

(vi) | While recording the confession, the same safeguards
and precautions be adopted, by directing the Public
Prosecutor, the complainant's counsel, the Naib Court and all
other officials to leave the Court. If need be, the counsel who
represents him, may be given an opportunity to be present
inside the Court during the whole process, if the accused
person, on asking by the Trial Judge, so demands;

(vii) the handcuffs of the accused be removed and he be
provided a chair on the dais. He may be given some time to
think over the making of the confession and in that regard
particular questions be put to him, as to why he was making
the confession when he has already pleaded innocence and
claimed trial at the time, the formal charge was framed;

(viii) the Trial Judge shall explain to the accused that, in case
of making confession, he has to face a capital sentence in a
murder case or any offence punishable with death;

(ix) the entire record of all the questions and answers
recorded, be properly maintained and thereafter, a proper
certificate be appended thereto, showing the satisfaction of
the Trial Judge that the accused person was not mentally sick
and he was making the confession voluntarily, based on true
facts and that, there was no other compelling reason behind
that.

Reliance could be placed on 2017 SCMR 713.

As the above procedure was not adopted, therefore,

it was incorrectly construed by the Court below as

confession of the accused. Under the law, it may be

treated as an admission of the appellant, however, on the

basis of admission alone, accused person cannot be

awarded a capital punishment because admission, as has

been defined by Article 30 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat

Order, 1984, is only a relevant fact and not a proof by

itself, as has been envisaged in Article 43 of the Order,

1984, where a proved, voluntary and true confession alone
12

is held to be a proof against the maker therefore, both the
Courts below have fallen in error by treating this halfway
admission to be a confession of guilt on the part of the
appellant. It is a bedrock principle of law that, once a
Statute or rule directs that a particular act must be
performed and shall be construed in a particular way then,
acting contrary to that is impliedly prohibited. That
means, doing of something contrary to the requirements
of law and rules, is impliedly prohibited. Therefore, it is
held that the admission of the appellant cannot be a
substitute for a true and voluntary confession, recorded
after adopting a due process of law and it cannot be made
the sole basis of conviction on a capital charge.

11. Apart from the above, co-accused who was driver
of the vehicle involved in the instant case has already
been acquitted by the learned Trial Court.

12. Keeping in view the contradictions on material
points occurred in the statements of PWs and handling
of the contraband as hinted above created doubts in the
prosecution case qua its recovery, safe custody and safe
transmission to the FSL, which suggest that occurrence
has not taken place in the mode and manner as alleged

by the prosecution.

13. The above discussion has led this Court to believe
that the learned trial court has erred in appreciating the

case evidence in its true perspective. It has been held,
13

time and again by the superior courts, that a slightest
doubt occurs in the prosecution case is sufficient to grant
acquittal to an accused. The conclusions drawn by the
learned trial Court are not borne out of the case
evidence, therefore, the impugned judgment is not

sustainable.

14. For what has been discussed above, this appeal is
allowed, the impugned judgment is set aside and the
appellant is acquitted of the charge levelled against him.
He be set at liberty forthwith, if not required to be
detained in any other case.

15. Above are the reasons of short order of even date.

Announced.
