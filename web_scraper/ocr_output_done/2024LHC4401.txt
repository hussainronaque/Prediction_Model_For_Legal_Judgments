Aforementioned sentences were ordered to run concurrently and
benefit of Section: 382-B Cr.P.C. was also extended to the
appellants/convicts.

It is pertinent to mention here that Muhammad Akhtar accused
became absent after recording of his statement under Section: 342
Cr.P.C. therefore declared as proclaimed offender.

2. Brief facts of the case in hand are that Zafar Yaseen (complainant/
PW-2) moved application (Ex.PT) for registration of case to Zahid Hussain
S.I. (PW-5) while mentioning therein that accused persons namely
Muhammad Akhtar, Zufiqar Ali resident of House No.234, Street No.2,
Mohallah Islampura, Toba Tek Singh and accused Arif Zaman Patwari
resident of Chak No.320-GB (© @), in connivance as well as consultation
with each other, with malafide intention while deceitfully committing fraud
and forgery, prepared a forged, fictitious and fabricated Fard Jamabandi
pertaining to the land bearing Khewat No.642/634, Khatooni No.750,
measuring: 2-K, 0-M (out of total measuring 22-K, 16-M) pertaining to two
plots one Kanal each, reference to Mutation No.11223 dated: 12.02.2008 in
connection with oral sale of land measuring 10-Marla; copy of Daily Diary
No.785 dated: 12.02.2008 and Mutation No.11256 dated: 25.02.2008
situated at Chak No.327/JB, Tehsil & District: Toba Tek Singh regarding
Criminal Appeal No.909/2012 3
the agreement to sell dated: 05.03.2007, whereby they agreed to sell land

@ Rs.52,500/- per Marla and received Rs.600,000/- as earnest money
@ Rs.300,000/- per Kanal whereas remaining amount of sale consideration
of Rs.7,50,000/- was received in the office of Arif Zaman Patwari situated
at Faiz Colony, Toba Tek Singh in presence of Hafiz Abdul Razzaq,
Muhammad Umar and misappropriated the amount with the pretext to sell
the lands; upon completion of period of agreement it came into knowledge
of the complainant that Fard Jamabandi is a forged, fictitious and
fabricated document; accused persons are not owner of the land; they in
consultation with each other having mala fide intention, cheating and fraud
in their hearts, grabbed a sum of Rs.10,50,000/- from the complainant,
which was as a trust with them till completion of agreement and the same
had been misappropriated with mala fide intention; the complainant along
with witnesses went to the accused persons, protested and demanded return
of his amount, whereupon, they while confessing their guilt sought pardon
and promised to return the amount but now they have flatly refused to do
so; upon which, the complainant himself paid amount of agreement to sell
of Rs.10,50,000/- to Muhammad Shafique; when demanded back said
amount from the accused persons, they threatened for involving him in

false cases.

On the basis of said application of Zafar Yaseen (complainant/
PW-2), case vide F.I.R. No.245/2009 (Ex.PT/1) dated: 05.06.2009 under
Sections: 420, 468, 471 PPC was registered at Police Station: City Toba
Tek Singh.

After investigation, report under section 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted in
the Court; Muhammad Arif Zaman, Zulfiqar Ali (appellants) and
Muhammad Akhtar (now P.O.) were put for trial; charge under Sections:
420, 468, 471 PPC read with Section: 5 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption
Act, 1947 was framed against them to which they pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. Prosecution during trial examined eleven witnesses whereas
Mushtaq Hussain, Assistant Commissioner, Toba Tek Singh was examined
as Court Witness (CW-1); thereafter statements of both the appellants as well
as of Muhammad Akhtar were recorded under Section: 342 CrP.C. on
03.08.2011 wherein they refuted case of the prosecution against them; the

appellants did not opt to record their statements under Section: 340(2)
Criminal Appeal No.909/2012 4
Cr.P.C. however Muhammad Akhtar (now P.O.) produced some documents

in his defence. Thereafter, an application was moved on behalf of the
complainant for producing further evidence which was allowed
on 28.09.2011; Muhammad Akhtar accused became absent and was declared
as proclaimed offender; Statements of Abid Hussain Patwari as PW-12 and
Ali Gardawar as PW-13 were recorded; both the appellants were again
examined under Section: 342 Cr.P.C. on 20.03.2012 wherein they refuted the
allegations levelled against them; they did not opt to appear under Section:
340 (2) Cr.P.C. however documents Ex.DK and Ex.DL were produced in
defence on behalf of Arif Zaman (appellant No.1). Trial court after
conclusion of trial has convicted and sentenced the appellants as

mentioned above through impugned judgment dated: 10.05.2012.

3. Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that convictions
recorded against and sentences awarded to the appellants through
impugned judgment are against the ‘law and facts’ and result of non-
reading/misreading of evidence. Learned counsel for the appellants

finally prayed for acquittal of the appellants.

4. Conversely, learned Deputy Prosecutor General has supported the

impugned judgment and prayed for dismissal of the appeal.

5. Arguments heard. Record perused.

6. Case of the prosecution against Zulfiqar Ali (appellant No.1) is
that he and Muhammad Akhtar (accused now P.O.) executed Iqrar
Nama (agreement to sell/Ex.PW) with Zafar Yaseen (complainant/
PW-2) regarding two plots measuring 1-Kanal each while receiving
Rs.600,000/- as earnest money; subsequently, Muhammad Akhtar
accused in furtherance of said Iqrar Nama (agreement to sell/Ex.PW)
got entered two mutations bearing No(s).11223 dated: 12.02.2008
(Ex.PG) and 11256 dated: 25.02.2008 (Ex.PJ) in revenue record in
favour of one Muhammad Shafique vide oral statement qua sale on the
basis of Mutation No.9981 (Part Patwar/Ex.PE and Part Sarkar/
Ex.P.E/1) which was entered on the basis of Rapt No.571 (Ex.PF).
Criminal Appeal No.909/2012 5
So far as Iqrar Nama (Agreement to Sell/Ex.PW) is concerned, it

is relevant to mention here that original of the same was neither
produced nor got exhibited; so much so that it was not got compared
with copy of the same, which was exhibited in the Court; even any
material has not been brought on the record to show that original has
been destroyed or not available in order to justify production of

secondary evidence i.e. copy of the same and in this regard, cases of

“Mst. AKHTAR SULTANA Versus. Major Retd. MUZAFFAR

KHAN MALIK through his legal heirs and others” PLD 2021 SC
715 and “Mst. KHURSHID BEGUM and 6 others versus CHIRAGH

MUHAMMAD” 1995 SCMR 1237 can be advantageously referred;
Even any notary public who attested Iqrar Nama (Agreement to
Sell/Ex.PW) has not been produced as witness by the prosecution; apart
from this, Zulfiqar Ali (appellant No.2) merely posed himself as having
purchased the land and not expressly mentioned therein that he is full
owner of the land and same wording was used by the complainant
(PW-2) himself in the agreement (Ex.PX) which he executed with
aforementioned Muhammad Shafique and he (complainant) even
admitted said facts including the fact that Zulfiqar Ali (appellant No.2)
and Muhammad Akhtar (since P.O.) executed Iqrar Nama (Ex.PW) with
him on the basis of Iqrar Nama, which they made with Yar Muhammad
etc. regarding purchase of the land and relevant portion of his statement

in this regard is scanned below: -

So, it has been admitted by the complainant (PW-2) that Iqrar Nama
(Agreement to sell/Ex.PW) was executed with him by Zulfiqar Ali
(appellant No.2) as well as Muhammad Akhtar (accused now P.O.) not
in the capacity of full owner of the land rather as purchaser of the land
and on the basis of agreement to sell, executed between Zulfigar Ali,
Muhammad Akhtar and Yar Muhammad, etc.; it was duty of the
prosecution to prove that Zulfiqar Ali (appellant No.2) was not owner of
any land there but prosecution did not produce any evidence in this
regard. It is not the case of the prosecution that Zulfigar Ali (appellant
No.2) while claiming himself as full owner of the land made statement to
Revenue Patwari regarding sale of the land to the complainant or any
other person on the asking of the complainant or any mutation of the
land was entered in the revenue record on the statement of Zulfiqar Ali
(appellant No.2) as owner; so much so, in the both impugned mutations
No(s) 11223 (Ex.PG) and 11256 (Ex.PJ), Zulfiqar Ali is not even
signatory in any capacity. Furthermore, as per Iqrar Nama (Agreement
to sell/Ex.PW), if Zulfiqar Ali (appellant No.2) fails to transfer land to
the complainant, then remedy is before Civil Court for specific
performance of the same or paying the double amount of the received
earnest money; in this regard, relevant portion of Iqrar Nama

(Agreement to sell/Ex.PW) is reproduced below: -
Criminal Appeal No.909/2012 7

Therefore, prosecution has been failed to prove the charge against
Zulfiqar Ali (appellant No.2) and there is no need to discuss defence
version qua him, hence, instant appeal to the extent of appellant No.2 is
allowed; resultantly, convictions recorded and sentences awarded to
appellant No.2 through impugned judgment are hereby set-aside; he is
acquitted of the charge; he is on bail after suspension of execution of his
sentence by this Court vide order dated: 20.06.2012 passed in Crl. Misc.
No.01/2012, his surety stands discharged from the liability of bail bonds.

7. Before discussing the case of Muhammad Arif Zaman (appellant
No.1), it is relevant to mention here that while deciding the criminal
case, approach of the Court must be inquisitorial instead of adversarial;
furthermore, in the case of forgery, cheating and particularly by the
accused who being official is also holder of the relevant record, it is not
easy to find out the direct evidence because such officials when become
cheater, they make planning, manage the atmosphere/material, try their
level best to conceal the relevant incriminating material and usually said
forgery comes to the knowledge of the affectee at belated stage and it is
more difficult to find out evidence at said stage due to passage of time;
therefore, in such offences, relevant material in the form of
documents/transactions can be given due weight while appreciating the
evidence in the light of maxim “Res ipsa loquitur ” i.e. “the thing speaks

itself” instead of emphasizing the oral/direct evidence.

8. So far case of Muhammad Arif Zaman (appellant No.1) is
concerned, he was acting as revene Patwari of the relevant area Chak
No.328 “{Jeem Bay (~ @)}”; he while acting as Patwari recorded Rapt
No.571 dated: 18.06.2006 (Ex.PF) in Roznamcha Wadiati, entered
mutation No.9981 (Ex.PE, Ex.PE/1) on 18.02.2006 regarding land in
favour of Muhammad Akhtar (accused since P.O.); he also entered
mutation No.11223 (Ex.PG=Ex.PN) dated: 12.02.2008 and mutation
No.11256 (Ex.PJ=Ex.PR) on the statement of Muhammad Akhtar
(accused since P.O.) in favour of one Muhammad Shafique s/o Sher

Muhammad; in this regard, statement of Ghulam Murtaza, Patwari
Criminal Appeal No.909/2012 8
(PW-4) and recovery memos (Ex.PC. Ex.PL and Ex.PS) can be safely

referred whereas relevant portion of Ex.PL is hereby scanned below: -

Muhammad Arif Zaman (appellant No.1) recorded aforementioned Rapt
No.571 dated: 18.06.2006 (Ex.PF) in favour of Muhammad Akhtar,
which is hereby scanned below: -

Perusal of said rapt reveals that it was incomplete, vague as well as
dubious because neither parentage of Muhammad Akhtar nor amount of
sale was mentioned in the same; similarly, measurement of the land
i.e. how much land has been sold and handing over of the possession has
also not been mentioned in the same. And with reference of said
incomplete rapt, mutation No.9981 was entered in the relevant register

on 18.02.2006 by appellant No.1 but it was never sanctioned/attested by
Criminal Appeal No.909/2012 9
any revenue officer and for the said reason same was of no value; in this

regard, case of “KARAM SHAH versus Mst. GHULAM FATIMA
and 3 others” (1988 CLC 1812) can be safely referred and relevant
portion of the same from its paragraph No.2 is hereby reproduced as
under: -

“An attested mutation may carry _a__rebuttable
presumption of truth but an unattested mutation entered simply
by a Patwari has no significance, importance or value in the

eyes of law”

(emphasis added)
Therefore, Muhammad Arif Zaman (appellant No.1) was having full

knowledge of incomplete/dubious feature/aspect of the rapt (Ex.PF)
being its author but he used the same and on the basis of said
incomplete/dubious rapt (Ex.PF), knowingly entered mutation No.9981
(Ex .PE, Ex.PE/1) on 18.02.2006 in favour of Muhammad Akhtar, which
remained unsanctioned/unattested and was of no value but even then, he
knowingly entered mutation bearing No(s).11223 (Ex.PG=Ex.PN) and
11256 (Ex.PJ=Ex.PR) on the statement of Muhammad Akhtar (accused,
now proclaimed offender) on the basis of said unsanctioned/unattested
mutation No.9981. Both mutation No(s).11223 and 11256 (mentioned
above) are subject matter of this case. Therefore, prosecution has
established that Muhammad Arif Zaman (appellant No.1) knowingly
committed forgery for the purpose of cheating, as well as cheating, used
forged document as genuine and also being public servant committed

“criminal misconduct”.

Now coming to the defence version of appellant No.1; relevant
portions of his answer to question No.10 during his statement recorded
under Section: 342 Cr.P.C. are hereby reproduced: -

‘T am not part to the agreement Ex-PW dated:
05.03.2007 between the complainant and Muhammad Akhtar
and Zulfiqar accused. There is no evidence on record
regarding any payment; neither on 05.03.07 nor on its
implementation dated i.e. 01.08.2007 relating to my
intervention.

As regards mutation No.11223 and 11256 or their reports
No.785 and 841, the complainant is not concerned with any of
these documents. The alleged vendee Muhammad Shafique never
joined the enquiry investigation or trial proceedings of this case.
PW4 Ghulam Murtaza Patwari has clearly admitted that
Muhammad Akhtar accused was already owner of 2 Kanals 13
Marlas since 30.09.06 vide mutation No.10338, Ex-DA.”
Criminal Appeal No.909/2012 10

“The mutations No, 11223 and 11256 were further based
upon mutation No. 9981 dated 18.02.06 got entered by Tayyub
Magbool in favour of Muhammad Akhtar, lying intact at that
time. A cancellation note, however, appears to have been forged
thereon by the prosecution through any hidden hand, hence not
blessed with the endorsement of any revenue officer ”.

When aforementioned defence version of appellant No.l has been
examined while keeping the same in juxta position with prosecution
version, then his version is of no avail whereas prosecution version is
cogent, convincing and based upon confidence inspiring evidence to his

extent.

9. Nutshell of the above discussion is that prosecution has proved its
case i.e. charge against Muhammad Arif Zaman (appellant No.1) beyond
shadow of doubt; he has been rightly convicted and sentenced by the
trial court; hence, aforementioned convictions recorded and sentences
awarded to appellant No.l through impugned judgment under
Sections: 420, 468, 471 PPC Section: 5 (2) of the Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1947 and Section: 9 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act,
1958, are maintained in toto. Therefore, instant appeal to the extent of
Muhammad Arif Zaman (appellant No.1) is hereby dismissed. Order
dated: 20.06.2012 passed by this Court with respect to suspension of
execution of sentence of appellant No.1 is hereby recalled. Station House
Officer of police station concerned will proceed further in accordance with
law. Office is directed to transmit copy of this judgment to the trial court

for compliance in accordance with law.
