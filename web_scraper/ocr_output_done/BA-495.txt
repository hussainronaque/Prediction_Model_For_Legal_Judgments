Advocate.

Respondents:- (the State & 1 another) by Hafiz

MOHAMMAD IBRAHIM KHAN, J- After being

entangled in case FIR No. 29 dated 24.01.2017
charged under sections 489-F & 420 PPC
registered at Levies Post Batkhela,
accused/Petitioner Zia Talab is looking for his

post arrest bail.

2. Prior to, the Petitioner for the similar
relief approached the Court of learned Judicial

Magistrate/Illaqa Qazi-III Malakand through an

2 application, which was dismissed by the order

ow.

dated 23.08.2017. Next off, the matter was
taken up before the Court of learned Additional
Sessions Judge/Izafi Zila Qazi Malakand at

Batkhela, where too the wheel of fortune did not

Nawab (SB) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
favour the Petitioner and the application stood

dismissed on 31.08.2017.

3. As per prosecution version, on
18.01.2017 at 15:45 hours the complainant Shakeel
Ahmad reported the matter to the local police vide
Naqal Mad (Roznamcha) No. 17 by presenting the
cheque bearing No. 00045201 dated 01.08.2016
alongwith memorandum of slip and stamp paper
dated 22.10.2015 that he had sumhased a piece of
land situated within the local limits of Mauza Piran
Kalay from Raza Talab Khan son of Zoor Talab
Khan in presence of marginal witnesses of the deed
in lieu of sale consideration of Rs.53,62,500/-,
which was paid to him in lump sum. Later on, due
to differences in respect of the suit land amongst
the LRs inter-se, the sale in question could not
materialize, therefore, the complainant made a
request for return of the said amount of
Rs. 53,62,500/- from the accused/Petitioner. In this
regard, the Petitioner had issued the above-referred
cheque for an amount of Rs. 15 lacs on 01.08.2016,
which was bounced back when presented before the
concerned Bank due to insufficient funds in the

account of Petitioner. In view whereof an inquiry

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
e—

was initiated which culminated into FIR ibid

registered against the Petitioner.

4. Having heard arguments of learned
counsel for the Petitioner, learned counsel for
the complainant and learned State counsel,
record with their valuable assistance delved

deep into.

5. Learned counsel for the Petitioner
referred to 2013 P Cr. LJ 1591 (Lahore) ''Dr.
Nasar Khan ys the State and another", 2013 P
Cr. LJ 1593 (Sindh) '"' Deedar vs Abdullah and
another", 2014 P Cr. LJ_1327 (High Court
(AJ&K) " Shahroom vs the State", 2017 P Cr.
LJ Note 34 (Peshawar) '' Haji Sardar Ali vs

Yar Muhammad and another" and PLD 2013
Lahore 173 _"'" Abdul Sattar _vs the State and
another". In the light of these dictums of the

Hon'ble superior Courts prayed for the grant of

pod bail. Inversely, learned counsel for the

complainant assisted by learned State counsel
placed reliance on 2009 SCMR 174 "' Shameel
Ahmad _ys_the_ State", 2017 MLD _ 1383 _"

Muhammad Ilyas vs the State", 2016 MLD

Nawab (S.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
451 (Peshawar) "Jamal Shah ys the State and
another"", PLJ 2013 Cr.C. (Peshawar) 686
(DJ. Khan Bench) '" Muhammad Imran_ys
State and another", 2011 YLR 863 (Lahore) "'
Abdul Sattar vs the State", 2012 P Cr. LJ 918
(Sindh)"" Muhammad_Naseem vs the State"
and 2011 MLD 299 (Lahore) '" Muhammad
Nawaz vs _ the State & others" . Besides, the
learned counsel for complainant also placed on
record photocopy of the FIR bearing No. 228
dated 29.09.2014, wherein the present
accused/Petitioner has been indicted an accused
under the similar section of law i.e. 489-F PPC.
Thus, prayed for utter dismissal of the bail

petition.

6. It appears from the record that

though the accused/Petitioner has been directly

yw) charged for issuance of bogus cheque
x ~ dishonestly to the complainant for an amount of
Rs. 15,00,000/-,however, from the available

record it divulges that he was mainly refused the
concession of bail on the grounds of his long

unexplained absconsion and his involvement in
offence of alike nature by the learned
Additional Sessions concerned through the
impugned order. Without being prejudice to the
merits of the case lest it may affect claims of
each party, suffice it to say, that it has been held
in plethora of judgments by the Hon’ble
superior Courts that the offence under section
489-F PPC provides a maximum punishment of
three years and it does not fall within the
prohibitory clause of section 497 (1) Cr. P.C,
whereas section 420 PPC is bailable and when
an accused was behind the bars for sufficient
length of time. Investigation in the case was
complete, inasmuch as charge has been framed
against an accused and such an accused was no
more required by police for further proceedings.
Then, such an accused was granted bail, even in
previous cases an accused whose bail bonds
have been forfeited, where there is a case of
further inquiry and the accused making a case
for bail on merits, mere abscondence would not
come in his way while granting bail. Similar

view has already been taken for the grant of bail

even despite involvement of the
accused/Petitioner in other cases of alike nature,
particularly, when there is no previous
conviction, mere implication in other criminal

cases will not stand as hurdle in the way of

releasing of an accused/Petitioner on bail.

7. The most recent view of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan in Criminal Appeal No.
273 of 2017 has altogether formed a distinguishable
view that for the offence when an accused has been
charged does not attract the prohibitory clause,
there can be no strong reason to withhold the
concession of bail, as grant of bail in such like

cases is a rule and refusal is an exception.

8. Moreover, as per version of the
complainant, the cheque in question has been
issued to him by the accused/Petitioner in respect of
his outstanding amount which was allegedly paid
for purchase of piece of land by the complainant,
but later on the sale of suit land did not take place
due to differences amongst the LRs. Thus, in view
whereof, prima facie the matter appears to be civil

in nature.

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
9. Learned counsel for the complainant
and learned State counsel were put a query by the
Court as to whether there are any exceptions
existed in the case, in view whereof bail could be
refused to the accused/Petitioner, they though
argued the case at considerable length but could

not pin-point any such exceptions.

10. In view of the above, the Petitioner at
this juncture is entitled to the concession of bail,
hence, he is asked to furnish bail bonds in the
sum of Rs. 200,000/- (Rupees two lacs) with two
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction
of learned Trial Court, who shall ensure that the

sureties are local, reliable and men of means.

11. These are the reasons of my short
order of even date.

12. Before parting with this judgment, it
is pertinent to mention here that the observations
made above are purely tentative in nature and

should in no way prejudice the case of either

party during trial. we
