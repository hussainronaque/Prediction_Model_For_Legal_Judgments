JUDGMENT
Dr. Khurshid Iqbal, J.-
1, We propose to dispose of the instant
criminal appeal against the judgment dated 20.03.2018
of the learned Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla
Qazi, Khwaza Khela, District Swat, by which, he has
convicted Nowsherawan (hereinafter “appellant”) son of
Mian Mosamar, u/s.302(b) PPC, to life imprisonment as
Y Tazir for Qatl-e-Amd of one Rozi Alam, and fine of
Rs.100,000/- which if realized, shall be paid to the legal
heirs of the deceased as compensation u/s.544-A Cr.P.C.
In default of payment of the fine, the appellant was
further convicted to undergo simple imprisonment for a
term of 06 months. The amount of fine was also ordered
to be recoverable as arrears of land revenue from the
person and estate of the appellant. The appellant was
further convicted u/s 324 PPC and sentenced to 05 years

SI and fine of Rs.50,000/-; In default whereof, he was

Bakht Sher Ali/Stenot DB: Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Or. Khurshid Iqbal

-2-

further convicted to undergo simple imprisonment for 06
months. The appellant was extended the benefit of

Section 382-B Cr.P.C.

2. The incident in respect of which the instant
case was registered, was reported to have occurred
on 11.03.2006 at 16:00 hours and reported at 17:00
hours by one Arsala Khan. The story Arsala Khan
narrated to the police in the emergency ward of hospital
in Khwaza Khela town, was that at 16:00 hours, he and
Rozi Alam his brother, were sitting in a shop in their
village called Tikdarai, when the appellant came there,
having a pistol with him. No sooner he reached their
shop, he opened fire at both of them. With his fire shot
Rozi Alam was hit on his head at several places and fell
on the ground. The complainant, however, remained
unhurt. He stated that the appellant decamped from
the spot, while waving his pistol. With the help of the
residents of the village, the complainant shifted
Rozi Alam in injured condition to the hospital,
who succumbed to his injuries while on the way. The
complainant told to the police that there is no motive of
the occurrence, he was still satisfied that the appellant
committed the murder of his brother on the abetment of
Ali Shah s/o Muhammad Ali Khan and Majat Khan

s/o Sher Muhammad both residents of village Chalyar.

Bakht Sher All/Stenot bB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar

Hon'ble Mr. Justice Dr. Khurshid Iqbal
-3-

The reasons he showed was that he has blood feud
enmity with those people. He further stated that the
occurrence was witnessed by Sohrab Khan, Muhammad

Didar and Sher Zada

3. ASI Shah Mumtaz Khan recorded the report
in the form of a Murasila in the hospital, which he read
over to the complainant, who acknowledged it as correct
and signed it. He also prepared injury sheet of the
deceased. He sent the Murasila and the injury sheet
through Constable Abid Ali to the Police Station of

Khwaza Khela, where it was converted into FIR No.109.

4. SI Meskin Ali conducted investigation of
the case. He prepared the site plan, took into possession
the blood stained Qamis of the deceased, one empty of
.30 bore pistol and blood stained earth from the spot,
put all these in parcels, which he sealed. He prepared
memos of the aforementioned articles. He arrested the
appellant on 13.03.2006; issued his card of arrest and
obtained his three days police custody from the learned
Judicial Magistrate/Ilaqa Qazi, Khwaza Khela. It is
worth mentioning here that when the appellant was
produced before the Medical Officer, before the period
of his police custody, the Medical Officer observed

that he was stated to be a mental patient. While the

Bakht Sher Ali/Stenot 08: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

Hon'ble Mr. Justice Or. Khurshid Iqbaf
-4.

Medical Officer recorded the information in black and
white, he noted that the appellant seems to be sound and
fit. After expiry of his police custody, the appellant was
again produced before a medical officer, who, too, found
him fit. The Investigation Officer produced him before
the Illaqa Magistrate with an application that the
appellant wanted to record his confession. The appellant
refused to confess to his guilt. Then, the learned
Illaqa Qazi, sent the appellant to the judicial lockup.
While in police custody, on 15.03.2006, the appellant
made pointation of the place where he had allegedly
concealed the pistol, the weapon of offence. He was
taken to that place, which was the vacant house of one
Javid Zargar(goldsmith). On his pointation, the I.O
recovered the pistol from the aforesaid vacant house and
prepared a site plan as well as a recovery memo. He also
put the weapon of offence in a parcel and sealed it. He
sent the blood stained earth and blood stained shirt of the
deceased as well as the one crime empty and pistol to
the FSL, who returned positive results in respect of those

articles. He also examined the PWs u/s 161 Cr.P.C.

5. After completion of investigation, final report
(challan) was submitted before the learned Sessions
Judge, Swat. On 25.09.2006, the case was assigned

to the learned Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla

Bakht Sher All/Stenot OB: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Or. Khurshid igbel
Ss

-5-

Qazi-II, Swat, for trial. The learned trial Court supplied
copies of the relevant documents to the appellant and
other accused u/s 265(c), Cr.P.C. He then framed charge
against the accused, to which, they pleaded not guilty

and claimed trial.

6. The prosecution examined as many as seven
(07) PWs till 07.03.2007. The record of the trial Court
shows that the learned Sessions Judge, during his jail
visit on 28.02.2007, found that the appellant seemed to
be a mentally ill person. The learned Sessions Judge
issued directions for examination of the appellant
through a Medical Board. On 07.06.2007, after receipt
of the report of the Medical Board that the appellant was
a mentally ill person, the trial against the appellant was
suspended u/s. 465, Cr.PC, till his recovery, while it
continued against the two other co-accused. The learned
rial Court, on 26.09.2007, acquitted the co-accused and
kept the remaining proceedings against the appellant
suspended till a declaration of his recovery and fitness
by the Medical Board from Central Jail, Peshawar. Since
then, the appellant was examined by the Medical Boards
for as many as four times. He was twice declared fit to
face the trial and on conclusion of the trial convicted
twice. In the first round, the trial of the appellant was

resumed on 26.08.2010 in light of the report of the

Bakht Sher Ali/Stenot DB: Hon’ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’bte Mr, Justice Dr. Khurshid Iqbat

-6-

Medical Board. On conclusion of the trial, the appellant
was convicted vide judgment dated 23.12.2010. This
Court allowed his appeal (No.46-P/2011) and remanded
the case to the learned trial Court with the direction
to provide him full opportunity of cross examination of
all prosecution witnesses. In the second round, the
prosecution examined 11 PWs and one Najibullah DFC,
as CW]. The CW testified that the ].0 was reported to
have passed away. Muhammad Ghafoor was examined
as PW11, who furnished evidence of the fact that he was
acquainted with the signatures of J.0. On conclusion of
the trial in the second round, the appellant was again
convicted by the trial Court vide judgment dated

20.03.2018, impugned herein.

7. We have heard arguments of learned counsel
for the appellant and the learned Assistant Advocate
General for the State and perused the record.

8. The instant appeal relates to the second round
of the trial. The mental illness issue of the appellant by
the Medical Boards has passed through chequered
history. We heard the instant appeal a couple of times
from the perspective of that issue. The main point raised
in this respect was that none of the Medical Boards
endeavoured to determine as to what was the mental

condition of the appellant at the time of the commission

Bakht Sher Ali/Stenot oa: Hon’ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Dr, Khurshid Iqba!

-7-

of the offence. We, therefore, deemed it appropriate to
examine the merits of the case in the first instance and

examine the mental illness issue later on.

9. On merits, the main point for determination
before us is that whether the learned trial Court has
arrived at a correct conclusion by recording conviction
of the appellant. In other words, the question is that
whether the prosecution has successfully proved the
charge against the appellant. This requires reappraisal of

evidence of the prosecution.

10. At the heart of the prosecution case lies the
evidence of Arsala Khan, the complainant (PW4),
Muhammad Didar (PWS) and Sohrab Khan, father of
the deceased (PW6). The complainant, brother of the
deceased, in his initial report recorded in the shape of
Murasila, reiterated the report he made to the police in
the emergency room of the hospital in Khwaza Khela.
He stated that on 11.03.2006 at 16:00 hours, while he
and Rozi Alam (his deceased brother) were sitting in
their shop in their village Tikdarai, the appellant came
there, having a pistol in his hand and opened fire at him
and his brother. As a result of the firing, he added, his
brother was hit on several parts of his body, whereas he

remained unhurt. The appellant decamped from the

Bakht Sher All/Stenot Os: Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar

Hon'ble Mr. Justice Dr, Khurshid Iqbal
-8-

place of the occurrence. No motive of the occurrence
was stated. Besides the appellant, two other persons
namely Ali Shah and one Fajat were also charged but for
abetment. The complainant deposed that apart from him,
Sohrab Khan, his father, Muhammad Didar and

Sher Zada were the eye witnesses of the occurrence.

11. The Investigation Officer prepared the site
plan at the instance of the complainant and aforesaid eye
witnesses. According to the site plan, the shop, where
the occurrence took place, is situated on the road of
village Tikdarai. The shop was part of the house of the
complainant party. The road of the village Tikdarai was
situated towards south. There was also a path leading
from south towards north which joins the road of village
Tikdarai. The door of the shop is towards the aforesaid
path. The deceased and the complainant were shown at
points | & 3, whereas the accused was shown at point
No.2, inside the house. The eye witnesses, namely,
Sohrab, Muhammad Didar and Sher Zada were shown
at points 4, 5 & 6, respectively, which are lying on the
road of the village. According to the medical report, the
fire shots hit the deceased at the back of his head

occipital region.

Bakht Sher All/Stenot DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’‘bie Mr. Justice Or. Khurshid Iqbal
-9-
12. Arsala Khan, the complainant (PW4),

deposed that at the time of firing, he was talking with the
deceased. He and the deceased were facing each other. It
means that the right side of the face of the deceased was
open to firing from point No.2, where the deceased was
shown to have fired at him. In such a situation, the
deceased should have been hit somewhere on the upper
portion of his right side. If the appellant had first fired at
the deceased, then, the deceased must have been hit at
his right side. Soon after the firing, the position of both
the deceased and the complainant would have changed.
It follows that the statement of the complainant
materially contradicts the medical evidence. The
eyewitness Muhammad Didar (PW5) deposed that the
appellant fired at the complainant and the deceased,
while standing in the door of the shop. He stated that
both the deceased and the appellant had their faces
towards him. This situation, when seen in juxtaposition
with the site plan, creates another material doubt in the
prosecution case. PWS was shown at point No.5, outside
the shop though the deceased and the appellant were
visible to him from that position. The medical evidence
and the deposition furnished by the complainant are
contradictory to each other. While firing at the deceased,

the appellant had his back towards the PW. If the

Bakhe Sher Ali/Stenot oe: Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Dr. Khurshid Iqbal
-10-

deceased was having his face towards the complainant at
point No.3, it was not possible for him to have his face
towards PWS at point No.5, which is situated towards
south of the shop. If the deceased has turned his face

towards south, he would have been hit on his front.

13. Statement of Sohrab Khan (PW6) reveals that
at the time of firing, he was present inside his house. It
means that he was present inside his house, he came out
from his house on hearing the fire shots and that he did
not see with his own eyes while the appellant fired at the
deceased, as such he could not be considered typically as
an eyewitness. He deposed that when the appellant was
entering the shop, he was present in the veranda of his
house. He admitted that from the veranda of his house,
the street, (i.e., the road of village Tikdarai) was not
visible. Two points are worth mentioning here. Firstly,
in the site plan that shows the house of the complainant,
the veranda was not shown. Secondly, if the street was
not visible from the veranda, then it was not possible for
him to see the appellant while entering the shop. These
facts further shatter his deposition as an eyewitness of

the occurrence.

14, According to the Murasila, the occurrence

took place at 16:00 hours (04:00PM) and it was reported

Bakht Sher Ali/Stenot DB: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

Hon'ble Mr. Justice Or. Khurshid (gha!
-ll-
to the police at 17:00 hours (05:00 PM). The Medical

Officer Dr. Muhammad Ali Jan (PW3) recorded
post-mortem examination of the dead body of the
deceased on page 3 of the inquest report presented to
him by the police. The report (Ex:P'W3/1) reflects that
the examination was conducted at 03:45 PM. The time
of the occurrence mentioned in the Murasila was 16:00
hours. It follows that the examination of the dead body
was conducted 15 minutes before the occurrence. Next,
according to the Murasila, when Rozi Alam was hit and
got injured with the fire shots of the appellant, he was
shifted to the hospital for medical treatment. He was
reported to have died on the way to the hospital. The
medical report shows that Rozi Alam died within one to
two hours. While it is not clear as to what was the
distance between the village Tikdarai and that of the
hospital Khwaza-Khela, it is quite clear that the
deceased passed away on the way to the hospital, which

means that he died within almost less than one hour.

15. In light of our above discussion, we find that
the prosecution has failed to prove the charge against the

appellant beyond reasonable shadow of doubt.

16. We would now come to the mental illness

issue of the appellant in greater details. The main

Bakht Sher Ali/Stenot DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

Hon'ble Mr. Justice Or. Khurshid Iqbal
-12-

question here is that whether the mental illness issue of
the appellant was treated according to law. The appellant
was arrested on 13.03.2006, the second day of the
occurrence. On 13.03.2006, he was produced before the
Magistrate for his police custody which was allowed for
three days. When produced for pre-custody medical
examination, the Medical Officer made the following
observation:

“I have examined Mr. Nowsherawan son of
Mian Moshamar r/o Tikdarai, Khwaza Khela,
stating of mental patient. There is no proof of
his mental illness. He seems sound and fit.”

17. On 16.03.2006, when he was again presented
for examination to the medical officer after expiry of his
custody, the Medical Officer found him “normal and
fit’. The above observation of the Medical Officer
evinces that there was such information regarding the
mental illness issue. But neither the Medical Officer, nor
did the IO attend to it. There is no evidence in support of
the allegation that the appellant fired at the instance or
on the abetment of the acquitted accused. In the
Murasila, there is no information whether the appellant
has any relationship with the accused or not. The
‘Investigation Officer also did not make any investigation
in this respect. The Murasila reflects that the appellant
came to the shop of the complainant party and opened

Bakht Sher All/Stenot DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Or. Khurshid Iqbal
-13-

fire without any conversation or altercation with them.
The complainant Arsala Khan was asked under cross-
examination in this regard. He deposed that no
altercation took place at the time of the occurrence.
Rather, he categorically stated that as soon as the
appellant came to their shop, he fired at them. It does not
appeal to a prudent mind that the appellant fired at the
complainant party without any justification. Rather,
this fact coupled with the above observation of the
Medical Officer shows that the accused did suffer with
mental illness. In such a_ situation, without first
determining the mental condition of the appellant right
at that time, the pointation by and the recovery of the
weapon of offence at the instance of the appellant

appeared to be materially doubtful.

18, As noted above, the factum of mental illness
of the appellant was immediately disclosed when he was
produced before the Medical Officer on the day of his
arrest, i.e., 13.03.2006. It is not clear who informed the
Medical Officer at that time. However, it is an
undeniable fact that the information was disclosed at the
right time and before the right person. As observed
above, the Medical Officer simply noted that there was
no proof of mental illness. The Medical Officer at the

expiry of the police custody also made no observation

Bakht Sher Ali/Stenot 0B: Hon’‘ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Or. Khurshid Iqba!
-14-

regarding the mental illness of the appellant. Had the
Magistrate gone through the judicial record with alacrity
of mind, he would have surely seen that there was an
information about the mental illness of the appellant.
That would have prompted the Magistrate to pass an
appropriate order, most particularly, re-examination of
the appellant by a Medical Officer in the hospital, or

even more appropriately, by a Medical Board.

19. Order No.24 dated 19.07.2007 of the trial
Court shows that on 28.02.2007, during his jail visit, the
learned Sessions Judge issued directions to the
Superintendent Jail for medical examination of the
appellant by a psychiatrist in the jail. The Superintendent
Jail submitted a report to the learned Sessions Judge
on 02.03.2007, and then the trial Court passed his order

dated 20.03.2007 referred to above.

20, The appellant was shifted to the Police
Services Hospital, Peshawar, for his medical
examination, where a Medical Board examined him and
submitted its report on 07.06.2007. The Board expressed
its opinion that the appellant was unable to understand
proceedings of the case and could not defend himself in
the Court of law; he was thus found unfit to plead in the

Court. In his order passed on 19.07.2007, the learned

Bakht Sher All/Stenot. 0B: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

Hon'ble Mr. Justice Dr. Khurshid Iqbal
-15-
trial Court postponed the proceedings/trial u/s 465,

Cr.PC. As the proceedings against the co-accused
continued, on 26.09.2007, they were acquitted, whereas
in respect of the appellant the postponement order was
kept intact with the direction that the Medical Board
shall examine the appellant after every six months and,

if found fit, he be produced again for trial.

21. In the year 2010, a second Medical Board
examined the appellant which found him fit to face the
trial (report dated 12.08.2010). Pursuant to that report,
the remaining proceedings at the trial were conducted
and the appellant was convicted u/s 302/324, PPC vide
judgment passed on 23.10.2010. On 03.03.2014, this
Court after hearing the appeal, set aside the conviction
and remanded the case to the trial Court to proceed with
the trial afresh strictly in accordance with law by
affording the appellant full opportunity of cross

examining all the prosecution witnesses,

22. During the trial, the appellant was again
examined by a Medical Board (third one) which gave its
report on 28.08.2014. The Medical Board opined that
the appellant was suffering from chronic paranoid
schizophrenia and advised that his case may be disposed

of according to the mental health Law. The learned trial

Bakht Sher Ali/Stenot DB: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Dr. Khurshid Iqbal
-16-
Court, vide his order dated 01.10.2014, observed that the

Mental Health Ordinance, 2001, was not extended to the
erstwhile PATA. The learned trail Court, then, directed
re-examination of the appellant by the Medical Board.
Vide its report dated 23.10.2014, the Medical Board
(the fourth one) opined that the appellant was well
enough and stable and posed no threat to the society
at large and observed that he may be released provided
his family takes responsibility of his behavior. The
learned trial Court against resumed the trial. However,
vide its report of 19.03.2015, the Medical Board once
again found the appellant unfit to face the trial.
Thus, vide his order dated 07.04.2015 the learned
trial Court again postponed the trial u/s. 465, Cr.P.C.
On 06.10.2016, the learned trial Court while recording
the history of the case, observed that on 30.08.2016,
the appellant was shifted to District Jail Timergara
along with report of the Medical Board to the effect that
the appellant was fit to face the trial. It was for the
second time, that the appellant was convicted by the

learned trial Court vide his judgment dated 20.03.2018.

23. The conclusion of above discussion is that
the prosecution has failed to bring home the charge
against the appellant. The FIR story, the site plan and the

medical evidence materially contradict each other. The

Bakht Sher Ali/Stenot 06: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Or, Khurshid Igba!
-17-
sitting position of the deceased and the complainant, the
direction of firing alleged by the complainant and the
presence of the appellant on the spot stated by the eye-
witnesses do not support each other beyond reasonable
shadow of doubt. It is settled law that a single
reasonable doubt is sufficient for acquittal of an accused.
Reliance is placed on Tarig Pervez v. The State (1995
SCMR 1345), wherein the august Supreme Court has
held that:

“The concept of benefit of doubt to an accused
person is deep-rooted in our country. For
giving him benefit of doubt, it is not necessary
that there should be many circumstances
creating doubts. If there is a circumstance
which creates reasonable doubt in a prudent
mind about the guilt of the accused, then the
accused will be entitled to the benefit not as a

matter of grace and concession but as a matter
of right.”

24, The time of post-mortem examination of the
deceased at the hospital and the time of the occurrence
are materially different; the former being earlier than the
latter. The motive was set up in the FIR but not proved.
The mental illness issue was duly considered by the trial
Court in the light of the reports of the Medical Boards.
However, at the initial stage, the Medical Officer and the
1.0 did not attend to it properly. The Medical Boards
examined the appellant’s condition as it prevailed

at the time of the medical examination. Had the

Bakht Sher Ali/Stenot OB: Hon'ble Mrz. Justice Muhammad Neeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Or, Khurshid Iqbal
-18-
Medical Officer attended to the issue at the very

beginning, there could have been a specific findings
about the mental condition of the appellant at the time of
commission of the offence. Circumstantially, it has been
proved that the appellant suffered as a mentally ill
person at the time of the occurrence. Guidance may be
sought from the case of Abdul Wahid alias Wahdi v,
The State reported as 1994 SCMR 1517. In this case,
august the Supreme Court has held that if the Court
reaches to the conclusion after holding an inquiry that
the accused was incapable of understanding the nature of
act constituting the offence for reasons of unsoundness
of mind, the accused will be acquitted, but the Court
shall give a specific finding whether he committed the
act or not. For ready reference, relevant findings of the
august Court are reproduced as under:

“Apart from the obligation of the Court to
hold an inquiry into the fact of unsoundness of
the mind of the accused in the above-stated
circumstances, the combined effect of sections
469 and 470, Cr.P.C. is that the Court shall
also hold an inquiry, if it appears from the
evidence produced before it, or if it has
reasons to believe that the accused was
incapable of understanding the nature of
offence at the time he committed it for reasons
of unsoundness of mind, into the fact of
unsoundness of the mind of the accused at the
time he committed the offence. If the Court
reaches the conclusion after holding such
inquiry, that the accused was incapable of
understanding the nature of act constituting
the offence for reasons of unsoundness of
mind, the accused will be acquitted, but the
Court shall give a specific finding whether he

Bakht Sher All/Stenot OB: Hon’ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Dr. Khurshid Iqbal
<A

-19-

committed the act or not. The above finding
by the Court is necessary as further action
against the accused upon his acquittal in the
case is to be taken by the Court under sections
471, 474 and 475, Cr.P.C. in the light of such
findings. The evidence recorded in the case
prima facie supports the contention that the
appellant/ accused at the time of commission
of offence was of unsound mind and,
therefore, this fact should have been inquired
into by the Court as provided under Chapter
34 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”

In Naseebullah_v. Special Judge, Anti-

Terrorism Court-II, Quetta and another (PLD 2017

Baluchistan 37), it was held that:

“The principles embodied in Section 84 of the
P.P.C. is based upon the Maxim, “actus non
facit reum nisi mens sit rea" i.e. an act is not
criminal unless there is criminal intent. It is
the mandate of law that nothing is an offence,
which is done by a person, who, at the time of
committing an offence, by reason of
unsoundness of mind, if incapable of knowing
the nature of the act or that whatever he is
doing is wrong or contrary to law. Once a
person is found to be suffering from mental
disorder or mental deficiency, which takes
within its ambit hallucinations, dementia, loss
of memory and self-control, at all relevant
times by way of appropriate documentary and
oral evidence, the person concerned would be
entitled to get the benefit of aforementioned
provision of law.”

This Court in the case of Muhammad Idrees

v. The State and 2 others reported as 2011 P Cr. LJ

925, has held:

“16. Viewing the case from every angle, it has
been established on record that appellant at
the time of occurrence was suffering from
serious psychiatric illness and was declared
unpredictable and dangerous by the Standing
Medical Boards constituted from time to time.
The appellant due to such precarious

condition was incapable of knowing the nature

Bakht Sher Ali/Stenot. OB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammed Naeem Anwar

Hon’ble Mr. Justice Or. Khurshid tqhal
-20-

of the act or that he was doing what was either
wrong or contrary to law. This particular
degree of insanity brings the case within
exception. Even on merits, we found no
tangible or confidence inspiring evidence
leading to the guilt and conviction of accused.

17, In the facts and circumstances of the case,
we find that the prosecution has not been able
to prove its case against the appellant and in
this view of the matter while extending benefit
of doubt, the appellant deserves acquittal.”

25. Consequent upon the above discussion, we
allow the instant appeal, set aside the conviction and
sentence recorded by the learned trial Court vide its
judgment dated 20.03.2018 and acquit the appellant
from ail the charges levelled against him. We direct the
family members of the appellant to take due care of the
appellant, make arrangement for his proper medical
treatment, and take responsibility of his behaviour in

respect of his own self and others in the community.

26, Above are the reasons of our short order of
the even date.
