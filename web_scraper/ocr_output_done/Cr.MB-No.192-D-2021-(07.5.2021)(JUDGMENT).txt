2. The prosecution story as disclosed in the

FIR, registered on the basis of murasila, in brief, is that

on 17.10.2020 at 12:10 hours, complainant Muhammad

Ayub, in injured condition alongwith injured, Mujeeb ur

Rehman, Syed Masjood Mehdi and dead body of
deceased Muhammad Safdar, reported the matter to
Muhammad Ramzan (S.H.O) on the spot to the effect
that he alongwith constable Mujeeb ur Rehman No.486
while riding the motorcycle was present in the area for
search and strike operation, when received spy

information that a suspected person on motorbike was

‘present at Hashmi Chowk Mohallah Qureshian Wala

near Ghas Mandi Morr to commit criminal activity, upon
which he reached to the spot where he found the said
person alongwith 125CC motorcycle, on seeing them, he

pulled out a pistol from his trouser’s fold and started

‘firing at them, as result whereof, he (complainant), Syed

Safdar Shah and Syed Masjood Mehdi sustained

injuries, while Syed Safdar Shah fell on the ground; that

he (complainant) and Mujeeb ur Rehman tried to

overpower the accused, who attacked them with the

‘knife in his possession, which caused him additional

injuries; that the accused was overpowered and
“ -3-

disarmed, who disclosed his name as Muhammad Suhail
son of Hidayat Ullah, resident of Mohallah Jumma Shah,
D.I.Khan; that when the injured Muhammad Safdar

Shah was attended to, by then he had expired,

‘meanwhile, the SHO of police station City alongwith

police Nafri arrived at the spot and the accused
alongwith the recovered articles and motorcycle was
handed over to him. He charged the accused for the

commission of offence.

3. I have heard arguments of learned counsel

for the petitioner and the learned A.A.G. assisted by
learned counsel for the complainant at a considerable
length and perused the record with their valuable

assistance.

“4. It cannot be ignored that the matter was

promptly reported, where the petitioner is directly

charged, who was arrested from the spot soon after the

incident alongwith the weapons used and the motorcycle

owned. The Investigating Officer while inspecting the

‘spot, recovered four empties of .30 bore alongwith

blood-stained earth from the places of deceased and the

injured.

5. The learned counsel for the petitioner
argued the case at considerable length and wanted to
harvest the benefit arising out of the statement of father
of the deceased, who appeared before the trial Court and
did not charge the petitioner for the death of his son,
with further submission that one of the injured has
effected compromise with the petitioner and is in no
mood to prosecute him, which according to the learned
counsel makes the case of the petitioner arguable for the
purpose of bail. True that the case has been put in Court
and some of the witnesses recorded their statements, but
equally true that in the episode the complainant who
happens to be a police official also sustained injuries
who has neither compromised the matter nor has
expressed his willingness for release of the petitioner on
bail. It is imperative to assess the available material on
the file, without having been influenced by what has
been stated above. There is no denial to the fact that the
petitioner is directly charged and a .30 bore pistol
alongwith the knife used were recovered from his
possession. The collected empties alongwith the
‘recovered pistol were sent to the Forensic Science

Laboratory to ascertain as to whether those were fired
-5-
from the recovered pistol or otherwise. The Chemical
Examiner after examining the same, opined that the
same were fired from one and the same weapon. The
injured also received injuries caused through sharp-
edged weapon and the recovery of the knife from his
possession substantiates the case of the prosecution to a
greater extent. The petitioner could not bring on record
mala fide on part of the complainant and as such at this
juncture, no other presumption can be drawn but that the
petitioner is prima facie connected with commission of
the offence.

6. The contention of the learned counsel that
the statement recorded by the father of the deceased,
who was examined by the trial Court should be taken
into consideration to benefit the petitioner even at bail
stage, are unfounded. There is no cavil to the proposition
that while seized of a bail matter, the Court is to make
tentative assessment and deeper appreciation is not
‘warranted, even otherwise the father of the deceased is
not the eyewitness of occurrence and no weight could be
given to what he stated in favour of the petitioner. True,
that bail applications cannot be heard and decided in a

vacuum and the Courts of law should apply its judicial
a

lily

-6-
mind to the collected evidence even at bail stage to
avoid miscarriage of justice but the present case is an
exception, as in case in hand, the material collected by
the investigating agency speaks in no other tone but that
the petitioner seems prima facie connected with
commission of the offence and does not deserve the
requested concession. The instant bail petition is bereft

of merit stands dismissed. 7
