ORDER

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, _J.- Being

unsuccessful before the two courts below to get the
concession of bail, petitioner through this further petition
seeks bail in case FIR No.273 dated 19.04.2008, registered
under sections 302/34 PPC, in Police Station Agha Mir
Jani Shah, Peshawar, wherein he alongwith absconding
co-accused Fida Khan, Shahid Khan and co-accused
Pervez, committed the murder of Saifullah deceased with
firearm on 19.04.2008 at 09.15 hours on Ring road near
Peshawar Model School Jabba Sohail, on a motive of
previous blood feud.

2. Arguments heard and record perused.

3. As per autopsy report the deceased has
sustained single firearm entry wound with corresponding
exit for which four persons including the petitioner are

charged. General role of firing has been attributed to all the

four accused, therefore, it is yet to be determined during
trial, as to whose fire shot proved fatal. Petitioner has not
confessed his guilt before the competent court of law nor
any incriminating articles to connect him with the
commission of offence has been recovered either from his
direct or indirect possession or on his pointation. In view
of the above, the case of the petitioner requires further
probe in to his guilt within the meaning of Sub-section 2 of
8.497 Cr.P.C. Co-accused Pervez, whose role is identical
to that of the petitioner has already been granted bail by
this court vide order dated 20.12.2013 in Cr.Misc.BA
No.1494-P/2013, so on the principle of consistency too, he
is entitled to concession of bail. Reliance can be placed on
case titled, “Muhammad Daud and another Vs the State
and another” (2008 SCMR 173). Since on merits,
petitioner has made out a case of bail, therefore, his mere
alleged abscondance in light of ratio of judgments of the
august Apex Court in cases titled “Ibrahim Vs Hayat Gul
and others (1985 SCMR 382), “Muhamamd Sadiq Vs
Sadiq and others” (PLD 1985 SC 182), “Mitho Pitafi Vs
The State” 2009 SCM R 299, would not be sufficient
to clog the way of bail. It has been clarified by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in case titled, “Qamar alias Mitho Vs the

State and others” (PLD 2012 Supreme Court 222) that

right of bail cannot be refused to accused merely on
account of his alleged abscondance which is factor relevant
only to propriety. No doubt, trial has been commenced but
as per the dictum of Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled,
“Abid Ali alias Ali vs the State” (2011 SCMR 161),
when prima face case of accused appears to be one of
further inquiry and is covered under the provisions of
section 497 Cr.P.C. then it has become a right of accused
that he be released on bail. Practice of refusal in cases
where challan has been submitted should not be a bar to
refuse a right. In the judgment (supra) it has also been
observed by the august Apex Court that bail cannot be
withheld as a punishment.

4. For the reasons discussed above, I am
inclined to exercise the discretion of bail in favour of the
petitioner. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he
furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two
local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Trial Court.
