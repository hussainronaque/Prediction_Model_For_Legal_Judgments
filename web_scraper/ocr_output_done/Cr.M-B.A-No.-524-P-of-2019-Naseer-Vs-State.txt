QAISER RASHID KHAN, J:- Accused/ petitioner

Naseer seeks his release on bail in case FIR No.1091,

dated 25-8-2012, under Sections 302/34 PPC of Police

Station Charsadda, District Charsadda, with the

allegations that he along with his co-accused Basheer had

fired at the complainant Abid with which he was injured

and later on succumbed to the injuries in the hospital.

2. The learned counsel for the

accused/petitioner inter alia contends that the co-accused

M.Ishaq Shah,PS. Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
namely Basheer, with a similar role of firing, has already
been acquitted of the charge, by this court, vide judgment
in Cr.A.No. 698-P/2015 decided on 9" March, 2017 and
that the fate of the trial of the accused/petitioner Naseer

would not be different.

3. The learned Additional Advocate General
assisted by the learned counsel for the complainant, on
their turn, resist the submissions of the learned counsel
for the petitioner and contend that the accused/petitioner
after the commission of the offence preferred to remain
fugitive from law for more than six long years and
surfaced only after the acquittal of his co-accused
Basheer and hence, being directly charged with a

specific role, he is not entitled to the concession of bail.

4. Arguments heard and the available record
perused.
5. As per the FIR ibid, it was on 25.8.2012 at

8.45 a.m. when Abid (complainant) reported in injured

condition as to how on the fateful day, while he was

M.Ishaq Shah,PS. Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
proceeding to Tehsil Bazar from his house on his motor

cycle and when reached the place of occurrence at 8.15

a.m., Basheer (acquitted co-accused) and Naseer

(accused/petitioner) having already waylaid at the spot,

started firing at him with their respective weapons and

caused him firearm injuries. The injured complainant

later on succumbed to the injuries in the hospital.

6. The complainant in his dying declaration

assigned a similar role of firing at him to both the

accused i.e. accused/petitioner and his acquitted co-

accused Basheer, with their respective firearms and from

the spot, seven empties of 30 bore pistol were recovered

which as per report of the Forensic Science Laboratory

were fired from one and the same weapon. The acquitted

co-accused, namely Basheer, arrested on 26.4.2014, was

convicted and sentenced to death by the learned

Additional Sessions Judge-V, Charsadda, on 26.11.2015

but the appeal bearing No. 698-P/2015 preferred by the

M.Ishaq Shah,PS. Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
said co-accused, was allowed by this court, vide

judgment dated 9.3.2017 and he was acquitted of the

charge.

Thus in a situation where the acquitted co-

accused, namely, Basheer, charged with a similar and

identical role in the FIR by the complainant/deceased as

that of the accused-petitioner and on the same set of

evidence, he was acquitted of the charge in appeal, then

such acquittal per se takes the case of the

accused/petitioner to one of further enquiry,

notwithstanding the fact that he remained absconder for a

sufficient long time. It needs no reiteration that if an

accused is otherwise held entitled to the concession of

bail, then abscondence alone shall not come in his way.

7. Accordingly, this petition is allowed and the

petitioner is admitted to bail provided he furnishes bail

bonds in the sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two lakh),

with two sureties, each in the like amount to the

satisfaction of the Illaqa/Judicial Magistrate who shall

M.Ishaq Shah,PS. Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men of

means.

8. Needless to mention that the observations
recorded in this order are tentative in nature and shall not
prejudice the proceedings before the learned trial court
where the case be decided on its own merits after

recording evidence.

Announced on
3rd_April, 2019. SENIOR PUISNE JUDGE

M.Ishaq Shah,PS. Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
