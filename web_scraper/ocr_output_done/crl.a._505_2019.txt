JUDGMENT
NAEEM AKHTAR AFGHAN, J. While acquitting accused

Ghulam Sarwar and Abdul Ghafoor, the co-accused Muhammad Makki,
Muhammad Mazhar, Muhammad Akhtar, Ghulam Mustafa and
Muhammad Aslam (the convicts) were awarded conviction and sentence
as follows by Anti-Terrorism Court-I, Multan (the Trial Court) vide
judgment dated 29 June 2009 in FIR No.296/2007 registered with Police
Station Qureshiwala, District Lodhra on 4 September 2007 on the basis of
statement of Muhammad Arshad s/o Haji Muhammad (the complainant)
for the allegation of committing murder of Haji Muhammad (father of the
complainant), Muhammad Umer, Sajida Bibi and causing firearm injuries
to Muhammad Siddique (PW.15) and Muhammad Umair (not produced at
the trial). It was further alleged by the complainant that accused Ghulam
Sarwar had abetted the co-accused for committing the offence due to

previous enmity:

“Therefore, I convict Muhammad Makki, Muhammad Mazhar,
Muhammad Akhtar, Ghulam Mustafa and Muhammad Aslam accused for
committing rioting and award sentence u/s 148 PPC to undergo 2 years
RI. and a fine of Rs.10000/- each to accused, in default of which, they

Crl. A. No. 505 of 2019 etc. 2

deceased Haji Muhammad, Muhammad Umar and Sajida Bibi, in default
of which, shall further undergo 6 months S.I. Muhammad Makki,
Muhammad Mazhar, Muhammad Akhtar, Ghulam Mustafa and
Muhammad Aslam accused are convicted for causing injuries to
Muhammad Siddique and awarded sentence u/s 324/149 PPC for 10
years RI. and to pay Rs.20000/- as Daman by each of accused, in
default of which, shall further undergo 3 months S.I. They are also

awarded sentence u/s 452/149 PPC for 3 yeOars RI. and a fine of
Rs.10000/- each of accused, in default of which, shall further undergo 3

which, they shall further undergo 6 months S.I.

All the sentences shall run concurrently. Convicts are given
benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C.”

2. Capital Sentence Reference (CSR) No.12/2009 was forwarded by the
Trial Court to the Lahore High Court (the Appellate Court) for
confirmation or otherwise of the death sentence of the convicts. The
convicts challenged their conviction and sentence by filing Criminal Appeal

Nos. 21-ATA/2009 and 29-ATA/2010 before the Appellate Court.

3. While acquitting the co-convicts Muhammad Makki, Muhammad
Mazhar and Ghulam Mustafa vide common judgment dated 12 February
2015 and answering CSR No.12/2009 in negative, the conviction of the
convicts Muhammad Aslam and Muhammad Akhtar u/s 302 (b) PPC was
maintained but their death sentence were commuted to imprisonment for
life with amount of compensation as directed by the Trial Court. Their
conviction and sentence u/s 452, 324/34 PC was also maintained.
However, their conviction and sentence u/s 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act,
1997 and under section 148 PPC was set aside. The Appellate Court further
ordered that all the sentences shall run concurrently with benefit of section

382-B Cr.P.C.

4. The convicts Muhammad Aslam and Muhammad Akhtar challenged
their conviction and sentence by filing Jail Petition No.251/2015 wherein
leave to appeal was granted on 30 October 2019 and same was converted to

Criminal Appeal No. 505/2019.

The complainant filed Criminal Petitions for Leave to Appeal No.314-
L/2015 and 391-L of 2015 challenging the acquittal of accused as well as
for enhancement of the sentence of the convicts wherein leave to appeal
was granted vide order dated 30 October 2019 and same were converted

into Criminal Appeal No.506/19 and 507/19 respectively.

5. During pendency of appeals, convict Muhammad Aslam passed away
in jail due to which Criminal Appeal No.505/2019, to his extent, stood
abated.
Crl. A. No. 505 of 2019 etc. 3

6. After hearing learned counsel for the appellants and learned
Additional Prosecutor General, we have perused the available record.
According to case of the prosecution, during investigation, twenty four
empties of Kalashnikov, two empty cartridges of 12 bore, one missed bullet
and one missed cartridge of 12 bore were recovered from the place of
occurrence but same alongwith .44 bore rifle (allegedly recovered from the
appellant Muhammad Akhtar), 222 bore rifle (allegedly recovered from
acquitted accused Muhammad Makki), 12 bore repeater (allegedly
recovered from acquitted accused Muhammad Mazhar alias Shakar),
Kalashnikov (allegedly recovered from acquitted accused Abdul Ghafoor),
Kalashnikov (allegedly recovered from acquitted accused Ghulam Mustafa)
and Mouzer .30 bore (allegedly recovered from deceased convict
Muhammad Aslam) were not sent to the firearm expert for analysis and in

this regard no explanation has been offered by the prosecution at the trial.

7. The complainant is son of deceased Haji Muhammad and is having
blood relations with all the deceased and the injured. According to his
statement recorded at the trial as PW.14, he alongwith his brothers
Muhammad Shafique and Muhammad Akhtar were sleeping on the roof of
their residential room in the night of the occurrence while his father
alongwith other inmates (the deceased and injured) were sleeping in the
courtyard. At about 5:30 am they heard the sound of motorbikes and saw
the nominated accused present in their courtyard with firearms making
firing upon the deceased and injured. PW.14 has specifically nominated all
the accused with specific firearms in their hands and he has attributed
specific firearm injuries on different parts of the bodies of the deceased as
well as the injured to all the accused with precision. Surprisingly, PW.14
did not receive a single firearm injury in the whole occurrence despite
indiscriminate firing by six nominated accused and despite allegedly

witnessing the entire occurrence from a close range.

8. Non-receiving of any firearm injury by PW.14 during the occurrence
and his accurate attribution of each injury of the deceased and injured to
each accused specifically with specific firearms casts serious doubt about
his presence at the place of occurrence and his planation as an eye witness
of the occurrence due to previous enmity with the nominated accused
cannot be ruled out of consideration particularly when his testimony is

lacking independent corroboration in material aspects.

9. There is no medico legal certificate of alleged injured Muhammad
Umair on record. The alleged injured Muhammad Umair and Muhammad
Shafique (brother of the complainant allegedly present at the place of

occurrence) have not been produced as prosecution witnesses at the trial.
Cri. A. No. 505 of 2019 etc. 4

Presumption under Article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 is drawn
to the effect that had these two witnesses been produced at the trial, they

would have not supported the prosecution version.

10. The ocular testimony of the injured witnesses is contradictory to the

medico legal evidence.

11. The recovery of 44 bore rifle from the appellant Muhammad Akhtar is
lacking independent corroboration and as earlier observed, same was not
sent to the firearm expert with the crime empties for analysis. Hence the

said recovery is held inconsequential.

12. The statements of complainant/PW.14, PW.16 Muhammad Akhtar
and the injured witness (PW.15) are suffering from dishonest improvements

and material contradictions rendering their testimony doubtful.

13. The infirmities in the case of the prosecution and the contradictory
statements of the prosecution witnesses, which are also suffering from
dishonest improvements, have created reasonable doubt in the case of the
prosecution. According to settled principle of law, benefit of reasonable

doubt has to be extended in favour of accused.

14. On reappraisal of the evidence available on record, it is concluded
that the prosecution has failed to prove the charge against the appellant
Muhammad Akhtar and acquitted accused beyond reasonable doubt. It is
further concluded that the acquittal of co-accused by the Appellate Court is

not suffering from any illegality or irregularity.

15. For the above reasons drawn today, vide our short order of even date,
Criminal Appeal No. 505/2019 (filed by the convict Muhammad Akhtar)
has been accepted and he has been acquitted of the charge while Criminal
Appeal Nos. 506/2019 and 507/2019 (filed by the complainant against
acquittal of the co-accused and for enhancement of the sentence of the

convicts) have been dismissed.
