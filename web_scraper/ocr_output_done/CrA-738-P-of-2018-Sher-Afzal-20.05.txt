JUDGMENT

LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- This criminal
appeal is directed against the judgment
dated 09.08.2018 of the learned Sessions
Judge/Judge Special Court, Swabi delivered
in case FIR No.162 dated 26.05.2017 under
section 9 (c) of the Control of Narcotics
Substances Act, 1997 of Police Station Topi
District Swabi, whereby the appellant has
been convicted and sentenced to three
years RI with fine of Rs.5,000/- or in default
whereof to undergo further two months SI
with benefit under section 382-B Cr.P.C.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on
26.05.2017 complainant of the case,
namely, Iltaf Khan, SHO (PW-1) alongwith
other police contingent was on gusht when
received information regarding selling of

chars by the appellant in the graveyard of
village Kotha, hence he rushed to the spot
and arrested the appellant having a black
shopper in his possession wherein there
were found three packets of chars, each of
1068, 955 and 977 grams, respectively. The
seizing officer separated 05/05 grams chars
from each packet for the purpose of
chemical analysis whereas rest of the chars
was sealed in a separate parcel. On the
basis of ibid recovery, case FIR Ex.PA was
registered.

3. On completion of investigation, the
case was put in court which indicted the
accused for commission of the offence to
which he pleaded not guilty and claimed
trial. Prosecution in order to substantiate its
case produced and examined 3 witnesses in
all whereafter statement of the accused was
recorded wherein he professed his
innocence. The learned trial court, on
conclusion of the trial, found the appellant
guilty of the charge and while recording his
conviction sentenced him as mentioned
above which he has impugned through the
instant appeal.

4. Arguments heard and record gone

through.
5. Perusal of the case record would
show that the very chain of events starting
from the crime spot to the Police Station
regarding the dispatch and safe custody in
the police malkhana of the representative
samples has not been proved which
deficiency has dented the prosecution case.
The case murasila PA/1 was handed over to
constable Sher Zada No.345 wherein there
is no mention that the case property and the
representative samples were delivered to
him for their handing over to Moharrir of the
Police Station. Likewise, moharrir of the
police station has not been produced as a
witness to depose that he had kept the
representatives samples in safe custody
before their dispatch to FSL. Similarly the
official who took the samples to FSL for their
chemical analysis too did not appear for the
prosecution as its witness. Thus, safe
custody of the case property and the
representative samples has not been proved
by the prosecution. Furthermore, according
to PW-1, the FIR was chalked out by
Rashid Khan, ASI on receipt of murasila
from constable Sher Zada No.345 but

neither Rashid Khan, ASI nor Sher Zada
have been produced by the prosecution in
support of its case. Besides there are other
contradictions in the statements of PWs
which were not taken into consideration by
the learned trial court while arriving at the
impugned conclusions.

6. Thorough and careful examination of
the case record would show that the
prosecution has not proved its case against
the appellant through any cogent and
reliable evidence and the learned trial court
has not appreciated the case evidence in its
true perspective for which the impugned
judgment cannot be upheld. It is cardinal
principle of criminal law that in order to
connect an accused with the commission of
an offence, the prosecution must produce
concrete and confidence inspiring evidence
connecting his neck with the alleged crime,
which is not the case in hand as on no count
it could be said that the prosecution has
proved its case against the appellant beyond
any shadow of doubt.

7. For what has been discussed above,
this appeal is allowed, the conviction and
sentence recorded by learned Sessions

Judge/Judge Special Court, Swabi vide
impugned judgment dated 09.08.2018 is set
aside and consequently the appellant is
acquitted of the charge levelled against him.
He is on bail and his sureties are discharged

from the liability of bail bonds.
