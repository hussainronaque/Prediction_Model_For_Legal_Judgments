JUDGMENT
MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR. J. The petitioner, through the

instant criminal revision, filed under section 439 r/w section
435 Cr. P.C, has challenged the order of the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-XII, Peshawar dated 18.12.2020,
vide which, his appeal, for conversion of consecutive
sentences into concurrent, was dismissed.

02. Facts forming the background of this petition are
that, against the petitioner, five FIRs under section 489-F of
PPC, 1860 were registered by the different complainants at
District, Peshawar, out of which, as per contents of the
petition, in one FIR bearing No.324 dated 01.07.2016 under
section 489-F,420,406 PPC, registered at Police Station,
Tehkal, District, Peshawar, the petitioner had resolved the
dispute by patching up the matter with the complainant
namely Bakht Zada while in rest of FIRs (four in number), he
had pleaded his guilt before the learned trial Court, the
particulars whereof are as under:

Table-1

Sr | FIR | Date of | Section of | Police | Name of
# |# FIR law Station | complainant
1452 | 01.12.2016 | 489-F PPC | Tehkal | Haider Ali |
2 | 174 | 04.03.2017 | 489-F PPC | Tehkal | Muhammad

: Aslam Khan

489-F PPC | Tehkal | Irfan Ali

03. In case tabulated at serial No.1, FIR No.1452 dated
01.12.2016, the petitioner was charged for issuance of
cheque amounting to Rs, 9,95,000/-, for the case at serial
No. 2 i.e, FIR No.174 dated 04.03.2017 he was charged for
commission of offence pertaining to the cheque issued with
alleged dishonest intention for payment of Rs.25,80,000/-
(twenty-five lac & eighty thousand), for the case at serial No.
3 of FIR No.758 dated 01.09.2017, the disputed amount was
Rs.16,00,000/- (rupees sixteen lac), whereas, for the case at
serial No.4 the disputed amount in case FIR No.759 dated
02.09.2017 was Rs,14,00,000/- (rupees fourteen lac). In all
the above mentioned four FIRs, different cheques of various
huge amounts were handed over to the complainants by the
petitioner, which, on presentation before the concerned
Banks, were dis-honored due to insufficient balance in the
petitioner's account. The details of sentences awarded to the

petitioner by the learned trial Court, are as under:

04. Learned counsel for petitioner contended that not
only all the three cases of serial Nos. 1, 3 & 4 of table No-2
were pending before one and same Court but were also fixed
for the same date i.e., 01.07.2020 and in all the cases the
petitioner had pleaded his guilt but the learned trial Court
has awarded maximum sentence of three years with fine of
Rs. 1000 in accordance with the provisions of section 489-F
of the Pakistan Penal Code 1860, more importantly, while
convicting & sentencing, the learned trial Court has totally
ignored the mandate of section 35 and 397 of Cr. P.C.
which resulted into miscarriage of justice, improper exercise
of jurisdiction pertaining to discretion and the philosophy
and logic of reformatory punishment. He added that on
08.09.2020, when in the case at serial No.2 of Table 2, the
petitioner was already in jail being convicted and sentenced
in the above referred cases and in such circumstances the
Court was required to extend the benefit of section 35 and
397 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 for which the
petitioner filed an appeal before the learned Sessions Judge,
Peshawar, for conversion the consecutive sentences to
concurrent, awarded to him by the learned trial Court. The
appeal was entrusted to the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-XIl, Peshawar but his appeal was dismissed vide order

dated 18.12.2020, hence, this criminal revision. He termed

the runn

ing of all the sentences consecutively as unjust,

excess of exercise of jurisdiction so vested in trial court and
the dismissal of appeal by the learned appellate court as
illegal and against the law. Conversely, Ms. Shakeela Begum,
Mr. Sardar Ali Raza, Mr. Bashar Naveed & Mr. Umer Farooq
learned Additional Advocates General argued that section 35
of Cr. P.C does not applicable to the matter in hand whereas
exercise of jurisdiction under section 397 of Cr. P.C was the
discretion of learned trial court which was exercised aptly
and judiciously while considering the facts and
circumstances of the cases and that the petition has got no
merit thus, requires dismissal.
05. Arguments heard and record perused.
06. Admittedly, for all the offences separate challan was
submitted before the court. Though three out of four cases
were pending in one and the same court however, the trials
were undeniably Separate, in such circumstances when
learned counsel for the petitioner was confronted with the
Provisions of section 35 of Cr. CP, which deals with the
sentence in case of conviction of several offences at one trial,
who frankly stated at the bar that section 35 of the Criminal
Procedure Code, is not applicable to the case of petitioner.
07. Evidently, in all the cases accused has pleaded his
guilt before the trial court after framing of charge. Earlier
when charged was framed he denied the allegations against
and claimed trial however, in three out of four cases when he

admitted the commission of offence he was not served with a

notice as required under section 243 of CrPC which was

mandatory in accordance with law. Rel: Sharif Khan vs. The

\

State (1991 P Cr. LJ 1761) for convenience section 243 is

reproduced as under:

Section 243, Cr. P.C.--- If the accused admits
that he has committed the offence with
which he is charged, his admission shail be
recorded as nearly as possible in the words
used by him; and if he shows no sufficient
cause why he should not be convicted, the
Magistrate may convict him accordingly.

08. It appears from record that on the basis of admission,
the learned trial Court without serving him with show cause
notice convicted and sentenced him in all the three cases on
the same date and in each case, he was awarded three years
simple imprisonment with fine. This was done when the
accused /petitioner was produced in custody, solely on the
basis of application, when he placed himself at the mercy of
court. In the case of Akhtar Zareen Vs, The State (2020 P Cr.
LJ] 229) Honorable Sind High Court has held that: -

I shall further add that there had never been

any doubt to the legal position that every

accused, regardless of charge against him,

was/is entitled for an expeditious trial which

(expeditious), however, never allows the

‘judge’ to make departure from mandatory

procedure and to ignore settled principles of

law rather invites capacity of the judge to

ensure legal disposal of the case by using all

available legal courses, provided by the law

and procedure themselves. This is so,

because a delayed justice is not a justice at

all and even may compel the accused to

accept what he never did.
09. Undisputedly, the petitioner has not challenged his
conviction before the competent forum however, for the
purpose of determination as to whether the petitioner is
entitled for exercise of discretion regarding conversion of his
sentence in different cases from consecutive to concurrent,

the circumstances of the cases in which his conviction was

recorded is one of the requisites which are to be seen as held

by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the cases of Sajjad Ikram

and others vs, Sikandar Hayat and others (2016 SCMR
467) that:

“It is clear from section 397, Cr. P.C. that the

Court, while analyzing the facts and

circumstances of every case, is competent to

direct those sentences in two different trials

would run concurrently. In that eventuality,

the Court has wide power to direct that

sentence in one trial would run

concurrently. The provision of section 397,

Cr. P. C. confers wide discretion on the Court

to extend such benefit to the accused in a

case of peculiar nature, like the present one.

Thus, extending the beneficial provision in

favor of the appellant, would clearly meet

the end of justice. We, therefore, observe

that there is nothing wrong in treating the

sentences of imprisonment for life of the

convict/appellants on three counts to run

concurrently, in view of facts and

circumstances discussed above.”
10. Although in the cases of Ali Khan Kakar (2012 SCMR
334) & Ghulam Farid (2013 SCMR 16) the HRC and Criminal
Suo Moto Review Petition were dismissed however, it was
enunciated in both the cases that for exercising discretion the
court would have to go through from the facts and
circumstances of the cases. The aim of imprisoning a person
is not merely to dump him in a jail. The aim is equally to
reform him during the period of incarceration so that he may
be brought back into the society as a peace-loving and law-
abiding citizen. The logic of imprisonment is not only to
incarcerate the accused person within four walls of the jail;
the purpose is to reform the convict. Further, a sentence of
three years’ imprisonment has to commensurate within the
offences. In the present case, the petitioner has been
convicted for the offence under section 489-F PPC for the

period of three years in each however, in case the sentences

were not to run concurrently, the petitioner would have to

|

serve a total of 12 years if he pays the fine in each case
otherwise would remain there for further period of four
months (SI), such as, further incarceration of the petitioner
beyond three years with one month (SI) for failure of
payment of fine. Keeping in view the circumstances of the
case and the powers of this Court it is the judicial obligation
of the High Court to undo a wrong in course of
administration of justice or to prevent continuation of

unnecessary judicial process. This is founded on the legal

maxim “ x aliquid alicui 1 jtur et i
sine qua res ipsa esse non potest”. The full import of this

maxim is whenever anything is authorized, and especially if,
as a matter duty required to be done by law, it is found
impossible to do that thing unless something else not
authorized in express terms be also done, may also be done,
then that something else will be supplied by necessary
intendment. The whole idea is to do real, complete and
substantial justice for which it exists. Ref: Gian Singh v. State
of Punjab, (2012) 10 SCC 303]

11. It is pertinent to mention here that one of the
argument of respondents that this Court can exercise such
power for conversion of sentence from consecutive to
concurrent only under section 561-A and not under section
439 read with section 435 CrPC. | have gone through from
the relevant provisions of the code and of the opinion that
the matter before this Court is not for conversion of
conviction into acquittal therefore, it is held that power
under Section 397 Cr. P.C. can also be exercised by the Court,

while exercising jurisdiction as Appellate Court or revisional

@

We

Court. Reference can be made to the case of M.R. Kudva Vs.

State of Andhra Pradesh 2007 R.Cr.D. 236 (SC), decided by
the Indian Supreme Court.

12. Accordingly, it can safely be held that that discretion
to make the sentences to run consecutively or concurrently
would be governed by different consideration, like facts of
each case, nature and character of the offences, criminal
history sheet and record of the offender, his age, sex. In fact,
it is not possible to exhaustively lay down all the factors that
may be relevant to be taken into consideration and basically
it would depend upon facts of each case to be so noted by the
Court while exercising its discretion in this regard.

13. A Full Bench of Allahabad High Court in Mulaim
Singh v. State, reported in 1974 Cr. LJ. 1397, examined the
issue in question in detail and arrived at the conclusion as

under: -

“The discretion conferred on the Court
under Section 397 has to be exercised on
some judicial principle. If a situation arises,
for invoking the inherent power of the Court
under Section 561-A of the Code, the Court
has to see whether the circumstances and
the object for which the inherent power is to
be exercised are in existence and can be
achieved. It is equally well established that
the inherent power is to be exercised to do
the right and to undo a wrong in the course
of administration of justice and this power
ought to be exercised sparingly only when
the Court feels that the ends of justice
require it and not as a matter of routine.”

Likewise, in the case of People vs Laureano, 8 N.Y. 2D 640
(Mar. 26, 1996), “New York Court of Appeals” observed the

principle that sentences must run concurrently when the act
constitutes one offence and is also a material element of
another offence. This was with reference to penal law under

relevant provisions of law while dealing with a case of

manslaughter in the first degree and robbery in the first
degree when the same act caused the victim serious injuries
and his death. Referring to these circumstances, the Court
took the view that concurrent sentence must be imposed

upon the convict.

14. Considering from another angle of restrictions & the
power of Court that whether the discretion vested in the
Court under Section 397 of the Code has been legislatively
circumscribed and, if not, can the provision be so construed
so as to impose limitations on exercise of power of the Court
while awarding sentence. The answer is within the statutory
interpretation that penal statutes are to be construed strictly
while the remedial statutes would receive a_ liberal
construction. By development of law, the distinction between
tiberal and strict construction has very much narrowed down
and is only important in resolving a doubt which other
canons of construction fail to solve when two or more
constructions are equally open. In case of remedial statutes,
the Court ought to give widest operation which the language
of the provision permits. In case of pure penal statutes, it is
also an equally settled principle that in penal or procedural
provisions relating to criminal jurisprudence, liability. or
punishment would be capable of narrower construction, but
the construction which will tilt the interpretation favorable
to the accused will be preferred over the interpretation
which would adversely affect the right of a person/accused

under trial.

10

15. Therefore, keeping in view the facts and
circumstances of the case, the manner in which the matter
was decided by the learned trail Court ie, in three cases by
the one and the same Court and the other on different date
however, in all the cases on the admission of
accused/petitioner, the principle discussed hereinabove
relating to the purpose, philosophy and logic of punishment
this petition is disposed of in the term that all sentences
awarded to the petitioner, as particularized in Table-2 of
para 3 of this judgment, shall be deemed to run concurrently.
Office is directed to send the copy of this judgment to the
Superintendent Central Prison, Peshawar for compliance in

accordance with law.
