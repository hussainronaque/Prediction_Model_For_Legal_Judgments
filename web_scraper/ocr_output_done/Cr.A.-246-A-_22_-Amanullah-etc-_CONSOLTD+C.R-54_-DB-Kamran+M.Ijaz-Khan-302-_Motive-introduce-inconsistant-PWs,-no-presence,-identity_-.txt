3. After the completion of investigation, the
complete challan was submitted before the court
against appellant Amanullah and co-accused
Muhammad Nabi upon which a full-fledged trial
was conducted against them and on_ the
conclusion thereof, appellant Amanullah was
initially convicted and _ sentenced to
imprisonment for life on two counts etc by the
learned trial court, vide judgment and order
dated 13.06.2019, however, being aggrieved of
the said judgment and order, appellant
Amanullah had filed appeal No.195-A/2019
before this court which was allowed and the
aforesaid impugned judgment and order of the
learned trial court was set aside and the case, for
want of some deficiencies in the charge, was
remanded back for denovo trial after reframing
of the charge in accordance with guidelines
penned down by this court vide order and
judgment dated 09.03.2021. In the wake
thereof, the learned trial court reframed the

charge against both the appellants to which they

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial and
commenced the denovo trial. Prosecution in
order to prove its case against the appellants,
produced as many as seventeen (17) witnesses
including AR-PW-3 namely Ali Zaman ASI
who is marginal witness to recovery memo
Ex.PW-3/1 and conducted partial investigation
in this case. AR-PW-5 is Hizbur Rehman HC.
He is marginal witness to recovery memo Ex.
AR-PW-5/1 vide which the SHO took into
possession the Kalashnikov 7.62 bore
alongwith 12 live rounds during the raid on the
house of appellant Parvez. AR-PW-6 is lady
Dr.Kausar Mehboob who conducted autopsy on
the dead body of deceased Gul Fareena vide

Amanullah vide recovery memo Ex.PW-8/20.
PW-8 is Ali Akbar (then) O.I.I. He also
conducted partial investigation to the extent of
appellant Parvez. PW-10 is Nosherwan son of
Aleemullah. Though he was present at
Abbottabad on the night of occurrence,
however, he furnished some fact regarding post
occurrence and stood marginal witness to
recovery memo Ex.PW-8/20 as well as
pointation memo Ex.PW-9/8. PW-11 namely
Shakeel Ahmad, PW-12/complainant namely
Jan Muhammad and PW-13 namely Mst.Bibi

proceedings, accused Muhammad Nabi was
arrested and from room of the residential house,
he recovered one Kalashnikov _ bearing
No.1975-AH-4177 loaded with 12 live
cartridges vide recovery memo Ex.PW-16/1.
PW-17 is Imtiaz Ali (then O.I.I). He conducted
investigation in this case. When prosecution
closed its evidence, statements of the appellants
were recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C before
the learned trial court, wherein they claimed
innocence, however, they neither wished to
produce the defense evidence nor desired to be
examined as witness under section 340(2)
Cr.PC. Then after hearing arguments of learned
counsel for the parties, the learned trial court
vide impugned order and judgment dated
12.10.2022 convicted and _ sentenced the
appellants while acquitted —_co-accused
Muhammad Nabi as detailed in Para No.1 of this
judgment. The appellants have now called in
question the aforesaid order/judgment of

conviction and sentence through the instant

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
criminal appeal, while the complainant namely
Jan Muhammad has filed the connected
Criminal Revision No.54-A/2022 for
enhancement of sentence of the appellants.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for the
parties and learned Assistant Advocate General
were heard in detail and record perused with
their able assistance.

5. It is the case of prosecution as set up by
the complainant namely Jan Muhammad (PW-
12) in the First Information Report (Ex.PA)
when he brought the dead body of his mother
namely Mst.Fareena accompanied by injured
Bibi Fatima, Mst.Sabahat and Jamil Ahmad to
the police station and reported to AR-PW-01 to
the effect that he alongwith his family members
were present in their house when at about 08.00
p.m. Ishha Vela, both the appellants who are
father and son inter-se armed with the deadly
weapons entered into their house and started
firing at them and as a result thereof, the fire

shot of appellant Parvaiz hit his mother Mst.Gul

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-10-

Fareena, whereas fire shots of appellant Aman
Ullah hit Bibi Fatima (PW-13), Mst.Sabahat
and Muhammad Jameel and both the appellants
have committed the said offence due to the
abetment of acquitted co-accused Muhammad
Nabbi. After the commission of offence,
statedly both the appellants decamped from the
spot. The occurrence was stated to be witnessed
by his father Aleem Ullah and his nephew
Shakeel Ahmad. No motive was disclosed in
the First Information Report (FIR).

6. In this case, the ocular account has
furnished by PW-11 Shakeel Ahmed, PW-12
the complainant namely Jan Muhammad and
PW-13 namely Mst.Fatima, whereas PW-10
Nosherwan though has not been mentioned in
the FIR as eyewitness of the occurrence,
however, he too has appeared in support of the
prosecution version. It may be noted that in
evry criminal case before analyzing the
credibility and legal worth of the evidence so

furnished by the prosecution witnesses, first the

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-ll-

prosecution witness(es) have to prove their
presence on the spot and at the relevant time. In
the present case though the complainant namely
Jan Muhammad and PW Shakeel Ahmad have
alleged that they were present on the spot and
have seen the occurrence, however, their
presence on the spot is not established, which is
to be highlighted as under.

7. As far as the presence of the complainant
Jan Muhammad on the spot is concerned, it is
part of the record that he is not residing in the
house where the crime was committed as the
spot house is the house of his brother namely
Nosherwan and this fact has also been admitted
by he himself as PW-12 as well as by PW-13
Mst.Bibi Fatima, who has_ categorically
admitted that the complainant alongwith his
kids were residing with his father Aleem Ullah
in another house. It is also part of the evidence
that father of the complainant namely Aleem

Ullah is having two houses and it is also part of

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-12-

the record that the other house of the
complainant’s father, where the complainant is
residing, is situated at a distance of 10/15
minutes from the crime house, therefore, in the
given facts and circumstances, the prosecution
was required to establish the presence of PW-12
Jan Muhammad at the time and place of the
occurrence and especially when the occurrence
has taken place at nighttime. As far as the
presence of PW-11 Shakeel Ahmad on the spot
is concerned, the same too is highly doubtful as
admittedly two of his younger sisters namely
Mst.Fatima and Mst.Sabahat and one of his
younger brother namely Jamil had sustained
severe injuries on their bodies, however, he did
not opt to stand as complainant of the instant
occurrence and instead the prosecution opted to
register the instant FIR through Jan Muhammad
who is admittedly residing in another house and
PW Shakeel even did not endorse and second

the contents of the FIR. Had he been present he

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-13-

would have definitely been acted either as a
complainant of this case or at least a seconder

of the contents of the FIR.

8. The  presence-cum-conduct of PW
Shakeel Ahmad on the spot is also highly
doubtful because admittedly when two of his
younger sisters, a younger brother and his
paternal grandmother sustained severe injuries
but he on his own did not make any effort to
shift their injured siblings and grandmother to
the hospital so as to save their lives and over
and above when the dead body and the injured
victims were statedly shifted to the local police
station and when the report was lodged even
thereafter, as admitted by PW-13 Shakeel
Ahmad himself in his cross-examination, that
he did not accompany the injured siblings to the
hospital. Such conduct on the part of PW-13
Shakeel Ahmad casts a serious doubt on his
presence at the time and place of the

occurrence. The presence of PW-12 Jan

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-14-

Muhammad and PW-11 Shakeel Ahmed on the
spot also does not find support from the site
plan (Ex.PW-17/2) as as per the entries of the
site plan they were shown at points No.8 and 9
and they were well within the firing range
especially from the place assigned to the
appellant Aman Ullah and who instead of
targeting the two minors Mst.Sabahat and Jamil
Ahmad, could have easily targeted them had
they been present at the time and place of the
occurrence and specially when they were at a

distance of a few feet from the appellants.

9. It is also relevant to mention here that the
statement of injured witness Mst.Fatima
recorded under section 161 Cr.PC as well as
statement of her mother namely Sarzamina
recorded under section 161 Cr.PC would also
show that they have excluded the presence of
Jan Muhammad and Shakeel Ahmad as
eyewitnesses of the occurrence as she has not
specifically named them to be the eyewitnesses

of the occurrence. In view of the above

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-15-

discussions, the prosecution has not been able
to prove that PW-12 Jan Muhammad and PW-
11 Shakeel Ahmad were present on the spot and
thus their evidence could not be considered for
the purpose of the impugned conviction and
sentence. In the case titled “SUFYAN NAWAZ
and another vs. The STATE and_ others”
reported as 2020 SCMR 192, the Supreme Court
of Pakistan set aside conviction and sentence of
appellant Sufyan Nawaz and acquitted him of the
charge framed against him by observing that
complainant is, by all means, a chance witness

and his presence at the spot at the relevant time is

not free from doubt. Similarly, in another case

titled “ABDUL JABBAR and another vs. The
STATE” reported as 2019 SCMR_ 129, the
Supreme Court has held that it is the settled
principle of law that once a single loophole is
observed in a case presented by the prosecution

where presence of eye-witnesses is not free from

doubt, the benefit of such loophole/lacuna in the
prosecution case automatically goes in favour of

an accused. At the cost of reiteration, it has been

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-16-

observed by us that, in a case, where the learned
appellate court, after reappraisal of entire
evidence available on record, has reached the
conclusion that there is unexplained delay in

lodging the FIR; the presence of eye-witnesses is

not established; there are irreparable dents in the
case of the prosecution; the recovery is
ineffective and is of no consequence; the ocular
account is belied by the medical evidence; the
motive behind the occurrence is far from being
proved and almost non-existent, the said Court
fell in gross error in maintaining the conviction of
the appellants. In these circumstances and after
an independent evaluation of evidence available
on record, we have no manner of doubt in our
minds that the prosecution has not been able to
prove its case against the appellants beyond
reasonable doubt. In another case titled
“KHALID @ KHALIDI and two others vs. THE
STATE” reported as 2012 SCMR_ 327, the
Supreme Court has observed that the ocular
account is not of such a character which could
be relied upon in order to convict a person on a

capital charge when the same is not corroborated

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-17-

by any other independent evidence as __ the

presence of both the eye-witnesses at the place

and time of occurrence is not established as their

statements have been disbelieved by the learned
appellate court regarding Sultan Mehmood
acquitted accused. In the case titled “Khawaja
AHMAD KHAN and 2 others vs. THE STATE”
reported as 1998 PCr.LJ 1192, this court by
allowing an appeal against conviction has held
the ocular testimony of related, interested and
inimical witnesses has not been supported by
any other independent and unimpeachable

source. It was further held that the presence_of

the eye-witnesses is highly doubtful. Likewise,

in the case titled “ZAFAR vs. The STATE and
others” reported as 2018 SCMR_ 326, the
Supreme Court of Pakistan has observed that
had they been present at the relevant time, they
would not have waited for the murder of their
father and would have raised alarm the moment
they saw the accused and his co-accused

standing near their father.

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-18-

10. As far as the statement of PW-13
Mst.Bibi Fatima is concerned, though she has
received injuries in the occurrence, however, it
is settled law that injuries on the body of a PW
is not a stamp that such witness is telling the
whole truth as despite the fact that she being a
victim of the occurrence was an important
witness for the prosecution, however, she has
not been associated with the investigation of the
case as she in her cross-examination has
categorically admitted that no proceedings were
conducted before her by any police officer. It is
also relevant to mention here that in the FIR
(Ex.AR-PW-1/1), the complainant has not
disclosed any motive for the occurrence but
when she appeared in the court as PW-13 she
introduced the motive of the occurrence by
stating that infact her engagement had been
made with her cousin namely Abdullah and that
the appellant Aman Ullah was annoyed of the

same as he wanted to marry her. She has also

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-19-

contradicted her own stance as in initial portion
of her cross-examination she has stated that no
proceedings were conducted in her presence by
any police officer but in the later portion she
has stated that she has shown to the I.O. the
place of her presence at the crime scene. In
view of the contradictory and mutually
destructive stance of this PW, her statement too
could not be relied upon. The Supreme Court of
Pakistan in the case titled “Mst.ASIA BIBI vs.
The STATE and others” reported as PLD 2019
Supreme Court 64, while allowing the appeal,
setting aside the conviction and sentence of the
appellant recorded and upheld by the courts
below and acquitting the appellant has observed
that there were also discrepancies between the
examination-in-chief of the complainant and the
complaint lodged by him. Such material

contradictions and inconsistent statements of

the_witnesses_and_complainant_cast_ further

doubts on the coherence of the evidence.

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-20-

11. It is the case of prosecution that both the
appellants who were duly armed with
Kalashnikovs entered the house of complainant
party and made indiscriminate firing at the
inmates of the house, however, on the available
record the prosecution has not been able to
prove that both the appellants have in fact
participated in the occurrence as the same
appears to be the doing of a single person. It
may be noted that as per the prosecution
version, total seven empties of 7.62 bore were
recovered, i.e. three from a place assigned to
appellant Parvaiz, whereas four empties from a
place assigned to appellant Aman Ullah,
however, the I.O did not bother to send the said
empties to the Forensic Science Laboratory to
determine that as to whether they have been
fired from a single weapon or more and the
aforesaid lacuna in the prosecution case
becomes more significant when it is seen that
the LO/PW-17 in his cross-examination has

admitted that he had sent the empties to the Fire

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-21-

Arm Expert to determine whether they have
been fired from one weapon or more than one,
however, astonishingly in this regard no report
of the FSL is available on the file and even the
learned defence counsel has confronted the LO.
with the suggestion that since the report was not
supporting the version of the prosecution,
therefore, the same has not been placed on file.

12. Another aspect of this case which casts a
serious doubt on the participation of both the
appellants in the occurrence is that it is the case
of the prosecution that both the appellants were
having Kalashnikovs with which they had fired,
however, only seven empties are shown to have
been recovered from the spot. It may be noted
that in the chamber/Bandolier of a Kalashnikov,
30 cartridges could be loaded and thus if both
the Kalashnikovs as attributed to the appellants
were filled even to the half then there must have
been recovery of more empties as alleged by
the prosecution. Similarly, the number of

injuries on the bodies of the victims i.e. one on

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-22-

the deceased namely Gul Fareena, one injury on

the deceased Jamil and one injury on PW

Fatima and one injury on Mst.Sabahat would
also show that in fact it is one-man doing
occurrence, therefore, it is spelling out all
around from the record that the complainant has
implicated atleast one innocent person amongst
the two and thus benefit of the same has to be
extended to both the appellants.

13. It is also relevant to mention here that as
per the prosecution case, the occurrence has
taken place at 08.00 p.m. Ishha Vela, however,
neither in the site plan (Ex.PW-17/2) any
source of light has been shown nor the
prosecution witnesses in their statements have
explained that as to how they identified the
appellants in the pitch-darkness of night and
more specifically when it is not the case of
complainant party that before starting firing any
conversation has taken place between them so
as to identify the appellants through their

voices. Since under’ the _ established

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-23 -

jurisprudence when an occurrence is taken
place in the darkness of the night then the
prosecution is bound to explain the accurate
identity of the assailant(s) which are apparently
missing in the instant case. In the case titled
“USMAN alias KALOO vs The STATE”
reported as 2017 SCMR_ 622, the Supreme
Court of Pakistan on acceptance of appeal of
the convict and by acquitting him of the
charges, has observed that the occurrence in
this case had taken place in the dead of a night,
Le. at 11.30 p.m. on 05.03.2005 and the
investigating officer had stated before the trial
court in black and white that no electric light
was available at the spot. The occurrence in
issue had taken place outside the house of the

deceased and in the absence of any source of

light at the spot the question regarding

identification of the assailant had assumed
pivotal importance but the prosecution had paid
no heed to the same. Similarly, the Supreme

Court in the case titled “Mst.SHAZIA

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-24-

PARVEEN vs The STATE” reported as 2014
SCMR _ 1197, on acceptance of appeal of the
convict and by acquitting her of the charges
observed that the incident in issue had taken
place at about 10-30 p.m. inside the house
wherein the appellant and her husband were

living and no source of light at the spot had

been disclosed_or_shown anywhere _on_the

record. In the case titled “The STATE vs.
SHAH alias SHANA and 4 others” reported as
1994 SCMR 152, the Supreme Court of Pakistan
has dismissed the appeal against a cquittal by
observing that considering the state of evidence
as it is, the High Court was justified in taking

the view that there was no satisfactory material

on the record to establish the identity of the

culprits and in the circumstances it was difficult
to hold that with any measure of certainty that
the respondents had taken part in the
occurrence. We find no basis for interfering
with the judgment of acquittal recorded by the

High Court.

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-25-

14. Another aspect of this case which casts
doubt on the prosecution story is that the house,
where the crime has been shown committed is
described and depicted in the site plan (Ex.PW-
17/2), the same would show that it is a house in
lands having no boundary walls. It is also
reflecting from the site plan (Ex.PW-17/2) that
the said house is surrounded by the maize crops
and thus the appellants could have attacked the
complainant party from outside the house or
from the nearby maize crops instead of taking
any risk to enter the house of the complainant
party especially when it appears that it was a
house without any boundary walls.

15. It is also relevant to mention here that the
prosecution has withheld the best available
evidence as statedly the occurrence has taken
place inside the house of Nosherwan who is the
brother of the complainant namely Jan
Muhammad and though Nosherwan who
appeared as PW-10 has stated that on the night

of the occurrence he was outside his home at

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
- 26 -

Abbottabad, however, PW Sarzamina, who is
the wife of the aforesaid PW Nosherwan was
very much present in her house and her
statement under section 161 Cr.PC has also
been recorded, however, she has not been
produced by the prosecution. Similarly, another
injured/victim namely Mst.Sabahat has also not
been produced by the prosecution and over and
above, one Aleem Ullah who is the husband of
deceased Gul Fareena and father of the
complainant and he was also shown as an
eyewitness of the occurrence in the FIR, has
also been abandoned by the prosecution being
unnecessary, therefore, prosecution has
withheld important pieces of evidence which
could have been produced through production
of these witnesses, therefore, an adverse
inference under Article 129(g) of Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 has to be drawn that had
the aforesaid witnesses been produced they
would have not supported the version of

prosecution. In the case tilted “MUHAMMAD

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-27-

ASIF vs. The STATE” reported as 2017 SCMR
486 the Supreme Court of Pakistan has held that
in our considered opinion these two
independent witnesses could provide the first
degree of evidence of reliable nature, thus,
adverse inference has been drawn that because
they were not supporting the prosecution case
so set up, therefore, they were dropped at the
trial. In this way, the best evidence,
independent in nature, was withheld from the
court for obvious reasons. This fact by itself is
sufficient to discard the evidence of the
interested and related witnesses because their
evidence is not only of the second degree but
also for the reason given above due to their
unnatural conduct. In another case tilted

“MUHAMMAD RAFIQUE ys. THE STATE and

others” reported as 2010 SCMR_ 385 the
Supreme Court has held that it is well-settled
that if any party withholds the best piece of
evidence then it can fairly be presumed that the

presumption under Article 129(g) of Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order can fairly be drawn that if P.W.
Amir Ali would have been examined, his
evidence would have been unfavourable to the
prosecution.

16. It is also relevant to mention here that as
per the contents of Crime Report (Ex.PA),
appellant Amanullah has been charged for
firing at the deceased Jamil and causing injuries
to other victims, whereas the appellant Parvaiz
has been charged for effective firing at the
deceased Gul Fareena however, in their
statements recorded under section 342 Cr.PC,
as question No.6 the appellant Parvaiz has been
asked that Mst.Gul Fareena was effectively
fired by the co-appellant Aman Ullah.
Similarly, as question No.2 the co-appellant
namely Aman Ullah has been asked that he has
made effective firing at Mst.Gul Fareena which
is not at all the case of the prosecution as set in
the FIR and court statements, therefore, on this

score alone, the prosecution evidence could not

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-29-

be considered against the appellants and thus
they could not be convicted on the basis of
aforesaid evidence.

17. It is also part of the record that in initial
report, the complainant has not set any motive
for the occurrence and it was lateron when PW-
13 Mst.Bibi Fatima who introduced a motive,
however, the prosecution has even failed to
substantiate the belatedly set motive as no
independent material or evidence was brought
on record qua the fact that the engagement of
Mst.Fatime was made with her cousin Abdullah
and on which the appellants’ side was annoyed.
It was also noted that in order to prove the
motive, Abdullah was an important witness but
the prosecution even did not bother to produce
him as well and thus even the belatedly
introduced motive has not been proved by the
prosecution. It is settled law that prosecution is
not bound to set a motive, however, when once
it opted to set a motive then it has to be proved

and in case of its failure to do so, benefit

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-30-

thereof has to be given to the accused. In the
case titled “TAJAMAL HUSSAIN SHAH vs
The STATE and another” reported as 2022
SCMR 1567, the Supreme Court of Pakistan has
observed that according to the prosecution the
motive of the occurrence was previous quarrel
between co-accused Nazakat Hussain Shah
(tried separately) and Wajid, son of the
complainant. However, the prosecution failed to

produce the said Wajid in order to prove the

motive part, therefore, it can safely be
concluded that prosecution could not prove the
motive part of the story. The Supreme Court of
Pakistan in another the case titled “SARFRAZ
and another vs The STATE” reported as 2023
SCMR 670, has also held that it is now well

established that if a specific motive has been

alleged by the prosecution then it is duty of the

prosecution to establish the said motive through

cogent and confidence inspiring evidence.

Otherwise, the same would go in favour of the

accused.

18. It also part of the record that seven
empties of 7.62 bore were recovered from the
scene of the occurrence on the second day of
the occurrence i.e. 20.08.2016 and out of these
seven empties, four were recovered from the
place assigned to the appellant Amanullah,
whereas three empties were recovered from the
place assigned to the appellant Parvaiz. The
record further reveals that these empties were
not sent to the FSL then and there as when the
appellant Amanullah was arrested after more
than one year on 31.10.2017 and after six days
of his custody when allegedly on his pointation,
the rifle was recovered on 06.11.2017 and it
was thereafter that both the empties recovered
way back on 20.08.2016 and the rifle recovered
on 06.11.2017 were sent together to the FSL,
therefore, the positive FSL report is of no avail
for the prosecution. Similarly, in the case of
appellant Parvaiz though he was arrested on
30.12.2020 i.e. after more than four years of the

occurrence, however, on the second day of the

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-32-

occurrence, a Kalashnikov was shown
recovered on the pointation of his father namely
Muhammad Nabi from a room and beneath the
cot and thus admittedly neither at the time of
arrest of appellant Parvaiz nor on his pointation,
the said rifle has been recovered, therefore,
such recovery could not be considered as
against the appellant Parvaiz. Furthermore, the
empties recovered from the place of appellant
Parvaiz and the alleged weapon of offence were
also sent by the I.O. jointly to the FSL and thus
any report thereof too would be of no avail for
the prosecution. The Supreme Court of Pakistan
in the case titled “Nawab SIRAJ ALI and
others vs. The STATE through A.G. Sindh”
reported as 2023 SCMR 16 by allowing the
appeal and acquitting the accused/appellant has

held that if the crime empty is sent_to the

Forensic Science Laboratory after the arrest of

the accused or together with the crime weapon,

the positive report of the said Laboratory loses

its evidentiary value. Sending the crime empties

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
- 33 -

together with the weapon of offence is not a
safe way to sustain conviction of the accused
and it smacks of foul play on the part of the
Investigating Officer simply for the reason that
till recovery of weapon, he kept the empties
with him for no justifiable reason. Similarly, in
the case titled “MUNEER MALIK and others
ys. The STATE through P.G. Sindh” reported
as 2022 SCMR 14934 by allowing the appeals
and acquitting the accused/appellants has
observed that the record shows that eight
empties of Kalashnikov and six empties of T.T.
pistol were recovered from the scene of
occurrence on the same day i.e. 17.05.2007
through recovery memo but the said crime
empties were neither kept in safe custody nor
sent to Chemical Examiner immediately after
recovery. The weapons of offence and the crime
empties were jointly sent to the office of
Chemical Examiner after a delay of more than
two months i.e. on 13.07.2007 for which no

plausible explanation has been given by the

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-34-

prosecution. In these circumstances, the
recoveries are inadmissible in evidence and
cannot be relied upon to sustain conviction of
the appellants.

19. It is also relevant to mention here that
Hizbur Rehman HC/PW-5, one of the marginal
witnesses to recovery memo Ex.ARPW-5/1
vide which the SHO took into possession a
Kalashnikov during a raid at the house of
appellant Parvez, in his court statement has not
even named the co-accused Muhammad Nabi,
who had allegedly produced the said weapon to
the SHO on behalf of the appellant Parvaiz.
Furthermore, as per statement of Muhammad
Arshad Khan SHO (PW-16), Imtiaz Ali Shah
SI/O.I.I was accompanying him at the time of
aforesaid raid, however, it is astonishing to note
that when Imtiaz Ali O.LI appeared as PW-17,
he did not bother to mention the facts of the
aforesaid raid or recovery of the weapon of
offence which inconsistencies in the statements

of the prosecution witnesses not only create

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-35-

doubt regarding the alleged recovery but also
give rise to two-fold impressions i.e. either PW-
17 was not present with PW-16 at the time of
alleged recovery or no_ such_ recovery
whatsoever had ever been made in the mode
and manner as alleged by PW-16.

20. It merits to mention here that though it is
the case of the prosecution from the very
inception that the appellants have committed
the alleged offence because of the abetment of
the co-accused Muhammad Nabi, however,
during the course of the investigation as well as
trial, the prosecution could not produce an iota
of evidence that as to when, where and in
whose presence the alleged conspiracy was
hatched and thus due to the aforesaid reason,
the learned trial court has acquitted the said co-
accused of the appellants but astonishingly the
complainant has not filed any appeal against his
acquittal order and thus the prosecution has
itself conceded that half of its allegations as set

in the FIR were wrong.

21. It is settled law that for giving benefit to
an accused, it is not essential that there should
be many circumstances creating doubts, even a
single doubt is sufficient to extend its benefit
to an accused person as it is the cardinal
principle of criminal administration of justice
that let hundred guilty persons be acquitted but
one innocent person should not be convicted.
In the case titled “SAGHIR AHMAD vs The
STATE and others” reported as 2023 SCMR
241, the Supreme Court has held that it is a
well settled principle of law that for the
accused to be afforded the right of the benefit
of the doubt, it is not necessary that there
should be many circumstances creating
uncertainty and if there is only one doubt, the
benefit of the same must go to the petitioner.
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its
judgment rendered in the case titled “BASHIR
MUHAMMAD KHAN ys _ The _ STATE”

reported as 2022 SCMR_ 986, has held that

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
-37-

single circumstance creating reasonable doubt
in a prudent mind about the guilt of accused
makes him entitled to its benefits, not as a
matter of grace and concession but as a matter
of right. The conviction must be based on
unimpeachable; trustworthy and _ reliable
evidence. Any doubt arising in prosecution's
case is to be resolved in favour of the accused
and burden of proof is always on prosecution
to prove its case beyond reasonable shadow of
doubt. Similarly, in the case titled “KHALID
MEHMOOD alias KHALOO ys The STATE”
reported as 2022 SCMR_ 1148, the Supreme
Court has reiterated the same rational by
observing that in these circumstances, a dent in
the prosecution's case has been created, benefit
of which must be given to the appellant. It is a
settled law that single circumstance creating
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the
guilt of accused makes him entitled to its

benefits, not as a matter of grace and

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)
- 38 -

concession but as a matter of right. The
conviction must be based on unimpeachable,
trustworthy and reliable evidence. In another
case titled “KASHIF ALI alias KALU vs. The
STATE and another” reported as 2022 SCMR
1515, the Apex Court has held that it is settled
law that a single circumstance creating
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the
guilt of accused makes him entitled to its
benefits, not as a matter of grace and
concession but as a matter of right. The
conviction must be based on unimpeachable,
trustworthy and reliable evidence. Any doubt
arising in prosecution case is to be resolved in
favour of the accused. Reliance in this behalf
can be made upon the following cases:-

i) Tariq Pervez _v. The State
(1995 SCMR 1345),

ii) Ghulam Qadir and 2 others v.
The State (2008 SCMR 1221),

iii) Muhammad Akram vy. The

22. For the reasons recorded hereinabove, this
criminal appeal is allowed, all the convictions
and sentences of the appellants namely Aman
Ullah alias Babu and Muhammad Parvez
recorded by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-I, Battagram through the impugned
judgment dated 12.10.2022 are set aside and by
extending them the benefit of doubt they are
acquitted from all the charges levelled against
them. They shall be released from the jail
forthwith if not required to be detained in any
other case.

23. Since we have allowed the instant Criminal
Appeal No.246-A/2022 and set aside judgment/

convicted and sentenced, therefore, the connected
