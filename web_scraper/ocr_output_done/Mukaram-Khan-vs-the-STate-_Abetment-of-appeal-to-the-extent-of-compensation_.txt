JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- At a trial held by learned

Additional Sessions Judge, Lahor (Swabi), accused

Mukaram Khan, having been found guilty of committing

murder of Fojdar and Naqash Gul deceased and an attempt

at the lives complainant Sohail Khan and PW Rehman Gul,

vide judgment dated 10.01.2018, in case FIR No.342 dated

09.12.2015, under sections 302/324/34 PPC, Police Station

Tordher, was convicted and sentenced as under:-

Under section 302 PPC:- To undergo
imprisonment for life on two counts and to
pay fine of Rs.4,00,000/-, as compensation in
terms of section 544-A Cr.P.C.

Under Section 324 PPC:- To undergo three

years imprisonment and pay a fine of
Rs.10,000/- or in default therefore to undergo
three months S.I.

Both the sentences shall run
concurrently and benefit of section 382-B
Cr.P.C. has been extended to him.

2. Through the instant appeal, the convict has
questioned his conviction and _ sentences, whereas,
complainant has filed connected Cr.R. No.13-P/2018,
seeking enhancement of sentence of the convict from life
imprisonment to normal penalty of death, as provide for
the offence under section 302 PPC.

3. Since, both the matters are emanating from one
and the same judgment of the learned trial Court, therefore,
we propose to decide the same through this single
judgment.

4. The prosecution case as unfolded in First
Information Report (FIR) Exh.PA is that on 09.12.2015 at
1730 hours, complainant Sohail Khan (PW.3), in company
of dead bodies of Fojdar and Naqash Gul deceased,
reported in Police Station Tordher Swabi to the effect that
on the fateful day he along with the deceased and PW
Rehman Gul was proceeding to their village on two
motorbikes. The deceased were riding on one motorcycle,
whereas, he and Rehman Gul (PW.4) on another. At 1630
hours, when they reached near the house of one Saz Bacha,
the appellant along with absconding co-accused Dil Jan

and Dawar Khan, duly armed with firearms overtook their
motorbikes in a red colour motorcar, intercepted them and
opened fire at them, as a result, the deceased got hit and
died on the spot, whereas, he and PW Rehman Gul luckily
remained unscathed. A previous blood feud between the
parties has been advanced as a motive behind the
occurrence. Report of the complainant was recorded into
FIR Exh.PA by Farooq Khan ASI (PW.6), who also
prepared injury sheets and inquest reports Exh.PM/1 to
Exh.PM/5 of the deceased and sent their dead bodies to the
mortuary for post mortem examination.

5. On arrest of the appellant and completion of
investigation, challan was submitted against him before the
learned trial Court, where he was tried and ultimately
convicted and sentenced as mentioned above, vide
judgment impugned herein.

6. During pendency of the appeal, the appellant-
convict died inside the jail. In this view of the matter, the
main legal point for consideration before us is whether on
the death of the appellant-convict, the appeal shall abate
under section 431 Cr.P.C., only to the extent of his
corporal punishment i.e. imprisonment for life or also to
the extent of compensation under section 544-A Cr.P.C.?

7. We have heard the respective submissions of
learned counsel for the parties and gone through the

relevant law on the subject.
8. Section 431 Cr.P.C., provides that every appeal
under section 411-A sub-section (2), or section 417 shall
finally abate on the death of the accused, and every other
appeal under this Chapter (except an appeal from a
sentence of fine) shall finally abate on the death of the
appellant. For the sake of convenience and ready reference,
section 431 Cr.P.C., is reproduced below:-

“431.Abatement of Appeals:- every appeal

under section 411-A sub-section (2), or

section 417 shall finally abate on the death of

the accused, and every other appeal under

this Chapter (except an appeal from a

sentence of fine) shall finally abate on the

death of the appellant”.
9. Chapter-III of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, provides

following ten types of punishments:-

i. Qisas
li. Diyat;
ili. Arsh;

iv. Daman;

v. Ta’ zir;

vi. Death

vii. Imprisonment for life.

viii. Imprisonment which is of two descriptions,
namely,
(Rigorous i.e. with hard labour); (ii) Simple.

ix. Forfeiture of property

x. Fine.
10. Similarly, section 302 PPC, provided the following
punishment for the offence of Qatl-i-am:-

(a) Punishment of death as Qisas;

(b) Punishment of death or
imprisonment for life as  Ta’zir
having regard to the facts and
circumstances of the case, if the
proof in either of the forms
specified in section 304 is not
available; or

(c) Punishment of imprisonment of
either description for a term which
may extend to twenty-five years,
where according to the injunctions of
Islam the punishment of qisas_ is not

applicable.

Thorough perusal of section 302 PPC would reveal that it
does not include “compensation” as a punishment for the
offence of Qatl-e-Amd. Similarly, “compensation” is also
not included in the schedule of punishments provided
under section 53 PPC. The word “compensation” also
does not find mention in section 431 Cr.P.C., rather word
“fine” has been specifically used therein. Though on
conviction of an offender under section 302 PPC, the
courts normally, in addition to corporal punishment,
imposed compensation upon the offender/convict to be
paid to the legal heirs of the deceased in terms of section
544-A Cr.P.C., recoverable as arrears of land revenue, but

in terms of section 544-A Cr.P.C., the compensation is not
a sentence under section 302 PPC, as per ratio of the
judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled,
“Azmat Ullah vs the State” (2014 SCMR 1178). The
relevant part of the judgment in this regard is reproduced
below:-

“Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of
the case this appeal is partly allowed, the
conviction of the appellant for an offence under
section 302(b) PPC is converted into that for an
offence under section 302(c) PPC and
consequently his sentence is reduced from rigorous
imprisonment for twenty-five years to rigorous
imprisonment for ten years. The sentence of fine
passed against the appellant by the learned trial
court and upheld by the Lahore High Court,
Lahore has been found by us to be unwarranted
because section 302(b) or 302(c_) PPC, do not
contemplate any such sentence. Instead of fine
we direct that the appellant shall pay a sum of
Rs.50,000/- to the legal heirs of the deceased by
way of compensation under section 544-A Cr.P.C.
or in default of payment therefore he shall undergo
simple imprisonment for six months. The benefit
under section 382-B Cr.P.C. shall be extended to
him. This appeal is disposed of in these terms.”
(Bold and underlines are ours which implied

emphasis).
11. In view of the judgment (supra) of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court, we are fine in our view to hold that the
word “fine” used by the learned trial Court in the
impugned judgment is actually compensation under section
544-A Cr.P.C., in addition to imprisonment for life.

Section 544-A Cr.P.C. was amended in the year 1972
under the Law Reforms Ordinance, however, no
corresponding amendment to the extent of compensation
has been brought in section 431 Cr.P.C. Had there been
any intention of the legislature that the appeal on the death
of the accused would not abate to the extent of
compensation then definitely, section 431 Cr.P.C., would
have also been amended to this extent, but such is not the
position. For the sake of convenience and ready reference
section 544-A Cr.P.C. is reproduced below:-

544-A. Compensation of the heirs to the person
killed, etc.: (1) Whenever a person is convicted of
an offence in the commission whereof the death of,
or hurt, injury or mental anguish or psychological
damage, to any person is caused, or damage to or
loss or destruction of any property is caused, the
Court shall, when convicting such person, unless for
reasons to be recorded in writing, it otherwise
directs, order the person, convicted to pay to the
heirs of the person whose death has been caused, or
to the person hurt or injured, or to the person to
whom mental anguish or psychological damage has
been caused, or to the owner of the property
damaged, lost or destroyed, as the case may be, such
compensation as the Court may determine, having

regard to the circumstances of the case.

(2) The compensation payable under subjection (1)
shall be recoverable as an arrears of land revenue
and the Court may further order that, in default of
payment or of recovery as; aforesaid the person
ordered to pay such compensation shall suffer
imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months,
or if it be a Court of the Magistrate of the Third
Class, for a period not exceeding thirty days.
(3) The compensation payable under sub-section (1)
shall be in addition to any sentence with the Court
may impose for the offence of which the person

directed to pay compensation has been convicted.

(4) The provisions of sub-sections (2-B), (2-C), (3)
and (4) of Section 250 shall as far as may be, apply

to payment of compensation under this section.

(5) An order under this section may also be made by
an Appellate Court or by a Court when exercising its

powers of revision.”

12. As per the golden principles of interpretation of
statute the courts while interpreting a provision of law
having penal consequences, follow the rule of strict
interpretation, according to which words not used by the
Legislature in a statue, cannot be inserted by the courts. In
order words when there is doubt about interpretation of a
statue then the interpretation is to be made which favours
the subject, as is held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
case titled, “Brig. (Rtd) F.B Ali and another vs the State
(PLD 1975 SC 506). The relevant part of the judgment is
reproduced below:-

“The language of a penal statue has to be

construed strictly and no question can possibly

arise in such a statute “carrying forward any

legal fiction”, which is not attracted by the plain

words of a statute which seriously curtails the

rights of a citizen”.
13. For what has been discussed above, we are firm in

our view to hold that “compensation” under section
544-A Cr.P.C., being neither a sentence under section 53
PPC nor under section 302 PPC, therefore, the appeal of
the appellant on his demise shall stand abate to the extent
of corporal punishment as well as compensation.
Resultantly, the word “fine” used by the learned trial
Court, being against the mandate of section 302 PPC is of
is no consequence whereas order for payment of the
amount of above mentioned fine to the LRs of the
deceased in terms of section 544-A Cr.P.C. shall also
stands abated with appeal.

14. Adverting to the punishment awarded to the
appellant under section 324 PPC, the same is
imprisonment for 03 years and Rs.10,000/- as a fine. To
the extent of sentence of imprisonment, the appeal of the
appellant shall stand abate under section 431 Cr.P.C.,
however, to the extent of fine, we are going to decide the
appeal on merits.

15. Perusal of the FIR depicts that complainant Sohail
(PW.3) has charged the appellant and absconding
co-accused for ineffective firing upon him and PW
Rehman Gul, however, while appearing as PW.3 he
deviated from his stance by attributing the role of firing to
the accused only at the two deceased. Similar is the
statement of eyewitness Rehman Gul, who while appearing
as PW.4 also did not charge the accused for firing at him

and the complainant. None of them has sustained any
10

injured. In this view of the matter, the learned trial Court
has landed into the field of error by convicting the
appellant under section 324 PPC and burdening him an
amount of fine.

16. In view of the above discourse, this appeal against
the deceased convict/appellant along with compensation
being abated is hereby dismissed, however, appeal to the
extent of sentence of fine under section 324 PPC is
allowed on merit and the sentence of fine imposed upon
the appellant deceased under section 324 PPC, is hereby
set aside.

17. On the death of the convict, the connected Cr.R.
No.13-P of 2018 for enhancement of sentence has become
infructuous which is hereby dismissed.
