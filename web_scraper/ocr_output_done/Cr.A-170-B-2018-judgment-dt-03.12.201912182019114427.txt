JUDGMENT

SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- impugned herein is the
judgment dated 13.10.2018 rendered by learned Additional
Sessions Judge, Lakki Marwat whereby the appellant Niaz
Wali alias Naz Ali, involved in case FIR No.149 dated
21.8.2007, under sections 302/34 PPC of police station
Tajori, District Lakki Marwat was convicted and sentenced
to death with compensation of rupees two million payable
to the L.Rs of the deceased or in default thereof to undergo

six months S.I. further.
Murder Reference No.09-B/2018 has also been
put up before us for confirmation.
2. Precisely stated facts of the instant criminal
appeal, as spelt out from the record, are that are that on
21.8.2007 at 0110 hours, Wali Khan, the complainant
made a report to the local police to the effect that on the
day of occurrence, he alongwith his cousin Gul Khan were
grazing their sheep and goats in their lands known as
Kotana Wala near Manzar Faqir. A goat of Gul Khan
entered into the field of accused while eating “Gowara”
crop, accused Naz Ali armed with single barrel shot gun
.12 bore, Hayatullah armed with 303 bore rifle were
present, both of them on entering of the goat, altercated
with Gul Khan, forthwith Hayatullah ordered his son Naz
Ali to kill him, resultantly, Gul Khan got hit and severely
injured, whereas accused bolted away from the crime spot.
Motive behind the offence, as stated by the complainant, is

entry of goat in the field of accused and eating “Gowara”
crops. He has charged the convict-appellant for
commission of the crime.

3. Investigation was started in the case by the
local police of Tojori. Since both the accused went into
hiding, therefore, proceedings under section 512, Cr.P.C.
were initiated against them, whereas challan was submitted
against the respondent-accused to the Court of learned
Additional Sessions Judge-III, Lakki Marwat, where at the
commencement of the trial the prosecution produced as
many as 11 witnesses whose statements were recorded and
placed on file. After the closure of the prosecution
evidence, respondent-accused was examined under section
342, Cr.P.C, wherein he denied the charges, professed
innocence and stated to have falsely been implicated in the
case. He, however, wished to produce no defence nor to
examine himself on oath as required under section 340(2),
Cr.P.C. The learned trial Court, on conclusion of the trial,
convicted and sentenced the appellant, as mentioned and

has also sent murder reference for its confirmation.
4. We have considered submissions of the learned
counsel for the parties and gone through the record of the
case with their valuable assistance.

5. It was on 21.8.2007 at 11:00 a.m., when the
complainant in the company of deceased were grazing
their sheeps at the place of occurrence, where one of the
sheep went to the field of the appellant which allegedly
resulted in exchange of hot words between the deceased
and the appellant, resultantly, Hayatullah, the father
commanded his son Niaz Ali Khan to kill, who fired with
his .12 bore shotgun which resulted into a serious injury on
person of the deceased. The deceased then injured was
rushed to DHQ, hospital Bannu, where he was initially
treated and the complainant reported the matter to the
casualty police which was taken vide murasila at 1:10 p.m,
but the injured later on died. The learned counsel for the
defence vehemently argued that the complainant was not
present at the time and at the place of occurrence and he

further contended that it was an un-witnessed occurrence.
Noy

We, with the valuable assistance of the learned counsel for
the parties, have gone through the record, the complainant
while reporting the matter, stated that it was his goat which
went into the fields of the accused to eat Gawara crops
which resulted into the tragedy, but when the Investigating
Officer prepared the site plan at the instance of the
complainant, nowhere the fields of the accused were
shown, nor the fields surrounded were having any Gawara
crops and all the fields have been shown as un-cultivated.
The complainant was examined as PW-7, who stated that
his village was situated across the ravine and that they
have their own property where they and the co-villagers
graze their sheeps, if they had a common pasture, then why
they brought their sheeps there. Even otherwise, the
presence of the complainant seems somewhat doubtful, as
he could not explain the exact location of his presence and
the field to which the goat of the deceased had gone. The
injured was taken to DHQ hospital Bannu in a Datsun

pickup arranged by one Iqbal, his co-villager and he stated

that other co-villagers also accompanied the injured to the
hospital but the Investigating Officer did not record the
statements of these people to substantiate the stance of the
complainant. The complainant stated that he reached to
DHQ hospital Bannu at 12:50 p.m, whereas the scribe Gul
Shehzad stated that he received the injured 1:10 p.m in the
hospital and he further stated that one Gul Malook brought
the injury sheet with him from police station Tajori. We
are surprised to note, that if the injured was straightaway
taken to the hospital, then how the injury sheet was
prepared in the police station and that why the complainant

gemained silent on this particular aspect of the case. The
prosecution case received jolts, when Gul Malook was
examined as PW-4, who stated that he was informed by the
Muharrir of Police Station Tajori at 11:50 a.m, that the
injured was brought to the hospital and he should proceed.
This PW further stated that when he reached to the

hospital, Gul Shehzad Head Constable (PW-9) penned

down the report of the complainant and handed him over
the injury sheet, but in the same breath he admitted that the
matter was already reported and he had not seen the
injured but he was in knowledge of the injuries, this is
surprising that when he did not meet the injured, how
could he say that he was in the knowledge of the injuries
on the person of the injured but in fact inference can be
drawn that the injured was first taken to police station
Tajori where the report was made and the injury sheet was
prepared. The scribe stated that it was 01:10 p.m when the
injured was received, whereas the complainant stated that
they reached to the hospital at 12:50 p.m, then how PW
Gul Malook got information from the Muharrir at 11:50
a.m regarding the arrival of the injured to the hospital. All
the witnesses contradicted one another, which indicates
that in fact neither the complainant was present with the
injured/deceased, nor the injured was taken straightaway to
the hospital but the inference can be drawn that these were

the nearby people who took the deceased then injured to
the police station Tajori and later on when the complainant

was procured, he reported the matter to the police.

In case titled Mst, Anwar Begum Vs. Akhtar

Hussain alias KAKA and 2 others (2017S C M R 1710) it was
held that:-
It is well settled by now that in order to
maintain conviction of a convict on capital
charge on the basis of testimony of chance
witnesses the court has to be at guard and
corroboration is to be sought for relying

upon any such evidence. But no

corroboration is available in this case.
6. The witnesses are at variance regarding the
mode and manner in which the injured was shifted either to
the hospital or to the police station. One Gul Badshah who
was examined as PW-6_ stated that at 2/3:00 p.m they
received information and when they reached to Gambila
Bus Stand the dead body also arrived to the police post
Gambila where he identified the dead body before the
police and thereafter, it was taken to RHC Gambila where

too he identified the dead body before the doctor. Gul
Malook, who was examined as PW-4, constantly denied
the taking of the dead body to the police post Gambila,
rather he said that from DHQ Bannu the dead body was
taken to RHC Gambila. The deceased was first taken to
D.H.Q hospital Bannu, where he was initially examined
but surprisingly, throughout the investigation neither the
statement of the doctor who initially treated the deceased
then injured was brought on record, nor medico-legal
report was prepared, hence, the initial journey from the
spot to the hospital is shrouded in mystery and it tells
otherwise of presence of the complainant. When PW-6 was
examined, he categorically denied the presence of the
complainant in the police post Gambila as well as in RHC
Gambila, whereas the complainant stated that when the
dead body was brought to the Mortuary for postmortem
examination, he left for his village, had he been present in
the hospital, he would have waited till completion of the
postmortem examination and then would have joined his

co-villagers to bring the dead body to the village.
-10-

In case titled Zulfigar Ali Vs. Imtiaz & others
(2019 SCMR 1315), it was held that:-

“According to the autopsy report,
deceased was brought dead through a
police constable and there is nothing
on the record to even obliquely suggest
witnesses’ presence in the hospital;
there is no medico legal report to
postulate hypothesis of arrival in the

hospital in injured condition”.
7. The Investigating Officer, after receipt of copy
of the FIR visited the spot and he called for the
complainant from his village and on his pointation the
blood was recovered and site plan was prepared. In the site
plan, the complainant has shown himself at a considerable
distance from the deceased and also the distance between
the accused/appellant and his co-accused Hayatullah.
Keeping in view the long distances the exchange of hot
words is not appealing to a prudent mind, if there was
exchange of hot words, then the parties would have come
closer and even the complainant would have tried to

intervene but the complainant remained a silent spectator.
\ S

-ll-

The purpose of presence was the grazing of sheeps and the
tragedy was stated to be the result of eating Gawara crops
by the sheep but when the site plan is thoroughly gone
through, neither there was any Gowara crop in the fields,
nor the accused had property at the place of occurrence, if
so, then why would they retaliate. The adjacent fields
belong to one Maidal and Sattar Khan, but the
Investigating Officer did not record their statements.

8. This is admitted on record that while going to
D.H.Q. Hospital Bannu, Police Station Tajori, P.P Gambila
and Police Station Sarai-e-Norang fall in the way and if so,
the complainant should have reported the matter to the
police in either of these stations. Similarly, Civil Hospital
Tajori, RHC Gambila, Civil Hospital Norang and Civil
Hospital Lakki lay in the way, then why the injured was
not taken there so that his life could be saved at the earliest
but the behavior of the complainant suggests that it was a
blind murder and no one was a witness to it. There was a

conscious attempt on part of the witnesses to improve their
-12-

statements to cover the delay, but these improvements

cannot simply be ignored and it reacts otherwise, and we

can safely hold that first the investigation was conducted

and then the report was made. The prosecution case when

is looked from all angles, leads us nowhere but to hold that

preliminary investigation was conducted and on

availability of the witnesses the report was made. In case

titled Nazeer Ahmed Vs. State & others (2019 SCMR
594), it was held that:-

As far as the alleged murder of Manzoor
la Ahmed is concerned the only eye-witness of
the said murder was none other than Nazeer
Ahmed complainant (PW1). According to
the complainant there had been repeated
exchange of hot words between the deceased
and the complainant on the one hand and
the accused party on the other and, thus, it
was unlikely that the complainant and the
deceased would go with respondent No. 2 to
his house for repairing a computer. The
FIR in respect of the incident in issue had
not been lodged at the Police Station giving
rise to an inference that the same had been
lodged and registered after deliberations

and preliminary investigation.
-13-

In this respect, case titled Allah Wasaya Vs.
State (2018 P.Cr.L.J_ Note Peshawar_192) can also be
referred.
9. So far as abscondence in the instant case is
concerned, it is not denied that abscondence alone cannot
be a substitute for real evidence because people do
abscond though falsely charged in order to save themselves
from agony of protracted trial and also to avoid duress and
torture at the hands of police. In the instant case,
abscondence is meaningless, because it can neither remove
defects of the oral evidence, nor is by itself sufficient to
bring guilt home to the accused.

In case titled Muhammad Sadiq Vs. State
(2017 SCMR 144), it was held that:-

The fact that the appellant absconded and
was not traceable for considerably long
period of time could also not be made sole
basis for his conviction when the other
evidence of the prosecution is doubtful as

it is riddled with contradictions.
-12-

The fact that the appellant absconded and
was not traceable for considerably long
period of time could also not be made sole
basis for his conviction when the other
evidence of the prosecution is doubtful as it
is riddled with contradictions.

In this respect case law reported as Muhammad

Salim Vs. Muhammad Azam and another" (2011 SCMR-474)
and Rohtas Khan Vs. State (2010 SCMR_ 566) can also be

referred. Needless to say that absconsion is corroborative piece
of evidence and in cases where direct evidence fails,
corroborative piece of evidence is of no avail, as in the instant
case.

10. For what has been discussed above, this appeal is
allowed, the conviction and sentences awarded to the appellant
are set-aside and he is acquitted of the charge levelled against
him. He shall be released forthwith, if not required to be
detained in any other case. Murder Reference No.09-B/2018 is
answered in negative.

The above are the reasons of our short order of the even date.
