Assistant District Public Prosecutor

Mohammad Riaz/respondent No.2 (complainant/Pw-1) by filing
the private complaint, on 04.01.2011, against Allah Rakkha
(appellant), Khuda Bakhsh, Ghulam Shabbir, Allah Bakhsh,
Muhammad Bakhsh and Ali Mohammad maintained that he was the
resident of Chak' No.166/10R Sialan Wala; Ahmad Khan alias Baggu
(deceased) was his real brother; Rajjad (Pw-2)/his brother-in-law
(Behnoi) was also residing in the same Chak; Ahmad Khan used to
have dinner at the house of Rajjad; at about 09:00 pm in between
24/25.07.2010, Rajjad (Pw-2) and Khuda Bakhsh (Pw-3) came to
Ahmad Khan at his ‘Ahata’’ and offered him the food; at that
occasion all accused (except Ghulam Shabbir who was involved later on)
were sitting there and they were extending threats to kill Ahmad Khan
alias Baggu for the reason that he was having illicit relations with
relative of accused; Ahmad Khan refuted the allegations where after,
all the accused left his house; Ahmad Khan, then, went to the house of
Rajjad for having dinner and ultimately returned to his home; on the
following morning Ahmad Khan was not found present at his ‘Ahata’
and at that occasion Rajjad told him/complainant about previous
night’s incident; they had been searching Ahmad Khan till late night;
it was 26.07.2010, at about 07:00 am, when they were in search of
Ahmad Khan, they met Allah Rakkha and when they inquired from
him, he/Allah Rakkha started running but he was apprehended by

‘a locality

Allah Rakkha Vs. The State & another

them; Allah Rakkha (appellant) disclosed that they were having
suspicion that Ahmad Khan was maintaining illicit relations with Rani
Mai, their close relative, so he along with other accused after
committing his murder had thrown the dead body in gutter near the
‘Ahata’; Allah Rakkha led to that gutter and dead body of Ahmad
Khan was found there inside; Allah Rakkha getting a chance was
succeeded to escape. Complainant further stated that he got registered
FIR No. 323, on 26.07.2010, at Police Station Sadar Khanewal under
Sections 302/148/149 PPC and as the Investigating Officer did not
record the statements of witnesses showing connivance with accused,
so it compelled him/complainant to file the private complaint.

2. After recording cursory evidence, processes were issued against
appellant and his co-accused, who on 09.06.2012 were charged under
Sections 302/148/149 PPC for which they pleaded not guilty and
demanded their trial.

3. In order to prove its’ case, Muhammad Riaz/complainant came
in witness box as Pw-1 and he produced Rajjad (Pw-2), Khuda Bakhsh
(Pw-3), Raja Ghulam Farid/draftsman (Pw-4), Muhammad Zaheer
Ahmad ASI/Moharrar (Pw-5), Muhammad Riaz (Pw-6), Sajid Ameen
(Pw-7), Naveed Abbas Constable (Pw-8), Muhammad Anwar
ASI/author of FIR (Pw-9) and Zafar Iqbal Constable (Pw-10). The
learned trial Court also examined Muhammad Zafar SI/IO (Cw-1) and
Dr. Javed Iqbal (Cw-2).

4. In his examination made under Section 342 Cr.P.C, version of
appellant was that case against him was based on concoction;
witnesses had deposed falsely; he had purchased ‘Ahata’ from
complainant, who wanted to take it back, so a false case was managed.
Appellant opted not to produce defence evidence or to appear in terms
of Section 342 Cr.P.C.

5. Appellant is unable to produce his learned advocate. As this
appeal pertains to the year 2013, so with the valuable assistance of
learned ADPP, I proceed to decide it on the basis of available record.
6. Learned ADPP, while opposing this appeal maintains that
although it is a case of circumstantial evidence, but as every piece has

been successfully linked with each other, therefore the allegations
Criminal Appeal No. 445 of 2013

Allah Rakkha Vs. The State & another

leveled against appellant were rightly believed by the learned trial
Court; the recovery of dead body at the instance of appellant is a
strong piece of evidence, which alone is sufficient to sustain the
conviction. He finally argued that there is no occasion for this Court to
interfere in a well-reasoned judgment.

7. HEARD

8. Prosecution’s case is based upon circumstantial evidence.
Universally, worth and value of circumstantial evidence always
remained an important subject. So, what the circumstantial evidence

is, that is to be understood first and then to see the principles

governing on this topic. It is defined” as under: -

i. Evidence of facts or circumstances from which the
existence or non existence of fact in issue may be
inferred.

ii. The proof of various facts or circumstances which
usually attend the main fact in dispute, and
therefore tend to prove its existence.

iii. As a series of circumstances leading to the
inference or conclusion of guilt, when direct
evidence is not available.

iv. It falls short of directly establishing a fact in issue,
but which is admissible by reason of its relevance
to the fact in issue.

v. <Aparticular set of circumstances may lead to the
appropriate inference being drawn.

vi. A theory, supported by a significant quantity of
corroborating evidence.

vii. It simply means that when there is no direct
evidence of a problem, it's a good idea to look
around for any other evidence that might be useful.

9. Differentiating the direct and circumstantial evidence
according to David Ellison’: -

“Sometimes it is easier to understand the difference
with an example. If your brother comes to you and says
he saw it snow today, then there is direct evidence that
it was snowing. If your brother told you that he woke
up and saw snow on the ground, then there is
circumstantial evidence that it snowed. He did not see

it snow, but it is a reasonable inference that if there is
snow on the ground, it must have snowed

10. Dr. Sowed_ Juma Mayanja°, while making comparative

analysis of the Common Law and Islamic Law Systems with regard to
circumstantial evidence and its admissibility in criminal proceedings, writes
that under the Islamic law, circumstantial evidence refers to admissibility of
‘Algqara’in’ that is plural of ‘Alqariinah’, which literally means connection,
conjunction, relation, presumption, inference or indication. According to him
in the language of the law, the word ‘Alqariinah’ refers to something which
surrounds an event and serves as a sign for the existence or non existence of
something. Thus, circumstantial evidence and ‘Alqariinah’ are both
synonymous and refer to circumstances surrounding an event from which an
inference can be drawn for existence or non existence of the issue under
investigation. The basis of admissibility of circumstantial evidence under
Islamic law is found in both the Qur’an and the Sunnah of the Prophet
(SAW). He also referred the verses of Holy Quran from “Surat Yusuf” as
under: -

“They said: ‘Our father, we went racing with one
another and left Yusuf by our belongings and a wolf
devoured him, but you will never believe us even if we
speak the truth’. And they brought his shirt stained
with false blood. He said: ‘Nay, but your own selves
have made up a tale.”

11. Elaborating the above verses in the light of circumstantial
evidence Dr. Juma further writes that: -

“These verses are about the story of Prophet Yusuf and
his brothers who threw him into a well because of
being the most beloved son to their father. After
throwing him into the well, they came back in the
evening weeping. They told their father that they had
left Yusuf guarding their belongings and went racing
with one another. As they were away, a wolf came and
devoured Yusuf. They brought his shirt stained with
false blood to convince their father that the blood was
a result of the wolf devouring Yusuf. Their father based
on circumstantial evidence to disprove their tale as he
looked at Yusuf’s un-torn shirt and said “When did the
wolf become so intelligent so as to remove Yusuf’s
shirt un-torn before devouring him?” that is why he
said, “Nay but your own selves have made up a tale”.

12. Quoting further Surat Yusuf, he wrote that: -

“Yusuf and the woman raced towards the door one
behind the other and she tore his shirt from behind. In
the process they met her husband at the door. On
seeing him she cried out, ‘what punishment does one
deserve who shows evil intentions towards your wife?
What else than he should be put in prison or tortured
with painful torment’. Yusuf said, “It was she that
seduced me”. At this moment, a witness of her own folk
testified saying, “if his shirt is torn from the front, then
her tale is true and he is a liar, but if his shirt is torn
from the back then she has told a lie and he is speaking
the truth”. When her husband saw Yusuf’s shirt torn at
the back, he said: “Surely it is a plot of you woman,
certainly mighty is your plot’’.

13. The above verses are about the story of ‘Prophet Yusuf’
and his master’s wife. The woman after closing all the doors of the
house, tried to seduce Yusuf into evil. Prophet Yusuf instead refused
and rushed to open the door. The woman decided to race with him and
pulled him from behind. In the process she tore his shirt from behind.
As they reached the door, they found Yusuf’s master. The woman
tried to accuse Yusuf of trying to do evil to her, but Yusuf defended
himself by counter accusing her that she was the one who was trying
to seduce him. As neither of the two had evidence to support his/her
claim, a person from among her own folk adduced circumstantial
evidence to prove the fact in issue. He said that look at his shirt, if it
be that it is torn from the front, then that would be enough evidence
for her that Yusuf was trying to do evil to her and as she was trying to
defend herself she tore his shirt from the front. But if it be that his
shirt is torn from the back, then that would be enough proof for Yusuf
that as he was trying to escape from evil, she tried to pull him from
behind and as a result his shirt got torn from the back. The master
relied on circumstantial evidence of the shirt being torn from the back,
to prove that the woman was telling lies, and that is why he said:

‘Surely it is a plot of you women, certainly mighty is your plot’.

14. Reverting my discussion that on circumstantial evidence,

what the principles are till now settled by the apex court, the

. . 7
formulation thereof is as under’: -

ii.

iii.

iv.

Vii.

viii.

ix.

Circumstantial evidence may sometimes be conclusive,
but it must always be narrowly examined.
Circumstances should be ascertained with minute care
and caution, before any conclusion or inference
adverse to the accused is drawn.

The process of inference and deduction involved in
such cases is of a delicate and perplexing character,
liable to numerous causes of fallacy.

This danger points need for great caution in accepting
proof of the facts and circumstances, before they are
held to be established for the purpose of drawing
inferences there from.

A mere concurrence of circumstances, some or all of
which are supported by defective or inadequate
evidence, can create a specious appearance, leading to
fallacious inferences.

It is necessary that only such circumstances should be
accepted as the basis of inferences that are, on careful
examination of the evidence, found to be well-
established.

A high quality of evidence is, therefore, required to
prove the facts and circumstances from which the
inference of the guilt of the accused person is to be
drawn.

There are chances of fabricating evidence in cases that
are based solely on circumstantial evidence; therefore,
the court, in such cases, should take extra care and
caution to examine the evidence with pure judicial
approach on strict legal standards to satisfy itself
about its proof, probative value and reliability.

When there are apparent indications of possibility of
fabricating evidence by the investigating officer in
making the case, the court must be watchful against the
trap, which may misled to drawing a false inference,
and satisfy itself about the fair and genuine collection
of such evidence. The failure of the court to observe
such care and caution can adversely affect the proper
and safe administration of criminal justice.

The settled approach to deal with the question as to
sufficiency of circumstantial evidence for conviction of
the accused is this: If, on the facts and circumstances
proved, no hypothesis consistent with the innocence of
accused can be suggested, the case is fit for conviction
on such conclusion; however, if such facts and
circumstances can be reconciled with any reasonable
hypothesis compatible with the innocence of the

accused, the case is to be treated one of insufficient
evidence, resulting in acquittal of the accused.
Circumstantial evidence, in a murder case, should be
like a well-knit chain, one end of which touches the
dead body of the deceased and the other the neck of the
accused.

No link in chain of the circumstances should be broken
and the circumstances should be such as cannot be
explained away on any reasonable hypothesis other
than guilt of accused.

Chain of such facts and circumstances has to be
completed to establish guilt of the accused beyond
reasonable doubt and to make the plea of his being
innocent incompatible with the weight of evidence
against him. Any link missing from the chain breaks
the whole chain and renders the same unreliable and
in that event, conviction cannot be safely recorded,
especially on a capital charge.

If the circumstantial evidence is found not of the said
standard and quality, it will be highly unsafe to rely
upon the same for conviction; rather, not to rely upon
such evidence will a better and a safer course.

15. Further study from some of the foreign jurisdictions, on the

question of circumstantial evidence and principles thereon, is as

under: -

AUSTRALIA®

i. Circumstantial evidence is very often the best.

ii. In order to convict, the only rational conclusion
to be drawn from the circumstances is the guilt
of accused.

iii. It is essential that the circumstances should to a
moral certainty actually exclude every
hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved.

iv. Circumstantial evidence is to be considered as a
chain, and each piece of evidence is a link in the
chain, but that is not so, for then, if any one link
breaks, the chain would fail.

v. Any case of such kind has to be dealt with in the
shadow of two contrasted forensic metaphors.
The first is the “links in a chain” metaphor. The
second is the ‘strands in a cable’ metaphor.

UNITED KINGDOM”

i. One strand of a cord might be insufficient to
sustain the weight, but three stranded together
may be quite sufficient of strength.

ii. There may be a combination of circumstances
no one of which would raise a reasonable

conviction, or more than a mere suspicion; but
the whole, taken together, may create a strong
conclusion of guilty, that is, with as much
certainty as human affairs can require or admit.
Circumstantial evidence must always be
narrowly examined.

CANADA’?

Circumstantial evidence, assessed in the light of
human experience, should be such that it excludes
any other reasonable alternative.

Any inferences based on circumstantial evidence
must be reasonable, and not speculative. The
danger is that speculative inferences can cause a
Trier of fact to make a leap of logic, unsupported
by the evidence.

INDIA"!

The inference of guilt can be justified only when all
the incriminating facts and circumstances are
found to be incompatible with the innocence of the
accused.

The circumstances have to be proved beyond
reasonable doubt and have to be shown to be
closely connected with the principal fact sought to
be inferred from those circumstances.

The cumulative effect of the circumstances must be
such as to negative the innocence of the accused
and bring the offences home beyond any
reasonable doubt.

All the circumstances should be complete and there
should be no gap left in the chain of evidence.

The circumstances, from which an inference of guilt
is sought to be drawn, must be cogently and firmly
established.

Circumstances should be of a definite tendency
unerringly pointing towards guilt of the accused.

16. Even in other jurisdictions the principles are almost the same.

So taking into consideration, what has been referred above, it can be

safely concluded and compiled that the courts have to be very careful

and critical while appreciating the circumstantial evidence. This

exercise being delicate needs great care and caution. The reference

made earlier, in particular under the Islamic perspective, shows that

even the evidence of best persons (sons of Prophet Yaqoob) on the

touch stone of appreciation of evidence was seen with doubt on first

presentation. The evidence of the wife of master of Prophet Yusuf,
who was the strong in all respect and when no one was there to see the
incident, when examined by applying the wisdom, was declared false.

17. In the light of above principles, now I proceed to examine and
appreciate the prosecution’s evidence produced in support of its’ case.

18. It was the case of prosecution, that all accused while appearing
before Muhammad Ramzan and Altaf Hussain made confession that
they committed the murder of Ahmad Khan alias Baggu. But during
trial, both these witnesses were not produced and given up by the
prosecution on the reason that they were won over by the accused. On
this score alone it is not difficult to hold that the chain is broken, and
its’ destruction is in totality.

19. It was claimed by Muhammad Riaz/complainant (Pw-1) that all
accused (except Ghulam Shabbir), on 24.07.2010, came to the house of
Ahmad Khan (deceased) and in clear words threatened to kill him
because of his illicit relations with some of their relatives. At that
occasion Rajjad (Pw-2) and Khuda Bakhsh (Pw-3) were also sitting
there. This story on the face of it appears to be unnatural and doubtful
that in presence of two witnesses, the accused having no fear at all
came and extended the threats to take the life of Anmad Khan. For the
sake of arguments, if this narrative is believed, the question is still
there that why not the matter was reported to police then and there and
similarly, why Muhammad Riaz/complainant was not taken into
confidence as according to complainant, he was told in this regard by
Rajjad etc. in the following morning, when Ahmad Khan was found
missing? For a moment, if it is also acknowledged that in the morning
complainant came to know about the incident of previous night, again
the challenge shall remain that why the police was not informed
immediately thereafter? All the witnesses are silent in this regard
therefore the foundation of the case is defective.

20. Muhammad Riaz (Pw-6) and Sajid Amin (Pw-7), when came in
witness box, they stated that on 24.07.2010, at about 11/11:30 pm they
had seen all the accused standing together near the gutter and when
they inquired, accused replied that they were present for discussion on

some domestic issue.
Criminal Appeal No. 445 of 2013
Allah Rakkha Vs. The State & another

21. In the village area at about 11/11:30 pm to be present at a place
where all accused were also stated to be available, seems to be
abnormal. Although in examination-in-chief both the witnesses did
not state that from where they were returning however on perusal of
their cross-examination, it appears that Muhammad Riaz (Pw-6) was
having some ailment and he had gone to doctor at Multan with Sajid
Amin but they could not successfully prove this fact. According to
Muhammad Riaz, he was suffering from stomach problem so for this
reason had gone to the doctor. No prescription of the doctor or any
other proof was produced by him. Statement of Sajid Amin reveals
that he was unable to tell the name of doctor, the details of hospital or
the clinic or its location etc.

22. Both these witnesses were closely related to the complainant. It
cannot be disputed that on 25.07.2010 in the morning they came to
know about the missing of Ahmad Khan from his house. If it was so,
then why on the same day they did not bother to inform Muhammad
Riaz complainant, about the presence of all accused together. This
disclosure at that time was much relevant for the reason that on
previous night, accused had extended threats to eliminate Ahmad
Khan and in the morning he was found missing. Presuming that they
did not deem it proper, even then prosecution cannot come out of
another test that why, immediately after the recovery of dead body
from same gutter where they had seen the accused, they did not
disclose it to complainant and why they opened their mouths after the
funeral prayer of the deceased was over?

23. In view of above by disbelieving both Muhammad Riaz and
Sajid Amin this court declares that prosecution lost another hook of
the chain.

24. Finally coming to the story of prosecution about apprehending
Allah Rakkha (appellant) and recovery of dead body at his instance,
when other pieces of evidence have already been disbelieved, this too
cannot be relied upon on many additional reasons. If complainant and
two others were succeeded to apprehend the appellant, who got
recovered the dead body, how was it possible for him/appellant to

escape? In his examination-in-chief Muhammad Riaz/complainant
Criminal Appeal No. 445 of 2013
Allah Rakkha Vs. The State & another

(Pw-1) did not disclose the time, when the dead body was recovered
however, in cross-examination the time he told was 07:00/08:00 am.
He further maintained that information was provided to police, who
arrived at crime scene at 10:00 am. Similarly Rajjad (Pw-2) was silent
about the time of recovery of dead body in his examination-in-chief
however, in cross-questioning, he responded that at about 09:00 am
they meet appellant, who fled away but was apprehend, which means
that dead body was recovered after 09:00 am. Khuda Bakhsh (Pw-3) in
cross-examination answered that the complainant informed the police
at about 09:30/10:00 am. Naveed Abbas Constable (Pw-8), who had
escorted the dead body to hospital in his cross-examination, replied
that they left the police station at about 08:00/09:00 am and he
received the dead body at about 10:00 am. Finally, version of
Muhammad Zafar SI/IO (Cw-1) in this context was that they arrived at
crime scene at 08:00 am.

25. Above serious contradictions about the meeting of appellant
with the witnesses, information to police and arrival of the
investigating officer at crime scene are serious in nature hence cannot
be overlooked. If the complaint (PC) is examined, it shows that it was
completed at 08:00 am that means the police arrived at crime scene
much earlier to that. If it was so, how the statement of Muhammad
Riaz (Pw-1) can be believed who stated that police came there at about
10:00 am. So, Prosecution even here is at loss of another link of chain.
26. About the medical evidence, it is observed that the post mortem
examination in fact was conducted by Dr. Sajid Amin who had gone
abroad, therefore, post mortem report (Cw-2/A) through secondary
evidence was proved by Dr. Javed Iqbal (Cw-2). As referred earlier the
complaint (PC) was completed at 08:00 am and immediately thereafter
dead body was sent to hospital for post mortem examination. Naveed
Iqbal Constable (Pw-8) was the one who escorted the dead body to
hospital that was at a distance of about 10-kilometrs. He categorically
stated that he received the dead body at 10:00 am and reached the
hospital within an hour. It means that the dead body was in hospital at
11:00 am. This position is in serious contrast on examination of post

mortem report, where in the relevant column the time of receiving the
Criminal Appeal No. 445 of 2013
Allah Rakkha Vs. The State & another

dead body is recorded 02:00 pm. It is a case of circumstantial
evidence and every piece of evidence has to be analyzed in a critical
way therefore this variation cannot be left unattended or answered in
favour of prosecution.

27. The post mortem examination of deceased was conducted at
03:00 pm, which is further challenge for prosecution but with no
answer that if the dead body was in the hospital at 11:00 am, why the
autopsy was delayed. In “Khalid alias Khalidi & 2 others vs. The State
2012 SCMR_ 327”, the incident took place at 02:00 am, FIR was
recorded at 04:00/05:00 am and post mortem examination was
conducted at 03:00 pm i.e. after about ten hours. It was held that this
fact clearly shows that FIR was not lodged at the given time. In
“Irshad _Ahmed_vs. the State 2011 SCMR_ 1190” post-mortem
examination was conducted with a noticeable delay. The apex court
held that delay was suggestive of a real possibility that time had been
consumed by the police in cooking up a story for the prosecution.

28. All other accused of the case including Ghulam Shabbir, who
was involved on the basis of supplementary statement, were acquitted
from the case on the basis of same impugned judgment. If initial story
of coming of accused at the house of deceased and threatening to kill
him and the next episode of their presence near the gutter has been
disbelieved, how the same evidence can be relied upon qua the
appellant?

29. These are the settled principles of law that it is the burden of the
prosecution to prove its case against the accused beyond reasonable
doubt; this duty remains throughout and does not shift to the accused,
who is only burdened to prove a defence plea, if he takes; in case of
failure to discharge, its responsibility, the accused shall be entitled for
benefit of doubt, not as a matter of grace but as a matter of right’.

30. This takes me to the ultimate conclusion that under no
circumstance, prosecution was able to prove its case beyond
reasonable doubt against appellant and the learned trial court without

applying judicial mind to the facts and circumstances of the case and

Criminal Appeal No. 445 of 2013
Allah Rakkha Vs. The State & another

by ignoring the settled principles for appreciation of circumstantial
evidence, wrongly relied the prosecution’s version, hence the
conviction of appellant cannot sustain.

31. Summing up the deliberations made above, this Criminal
Appeal is allowed, while reserving the impugned judgment dated
17.09.2013. Allah Rakkha/Appellant is acquitted from the case. He is
on bail and his surety is discharged from terms and conditions of bail

bonds.
