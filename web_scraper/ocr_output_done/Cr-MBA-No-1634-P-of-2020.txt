ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN_ KHAN, _J:- Petitioners seek post
arrest bail in case FIR No.68 dated 26.02.2020, registered
under sections 324/148/149 PPC, at Police Station Sro
Kalay, Charsadda.
2. According to FIR/report of complainant Amir on
26.02.2020, he along with his uncle Wakil ur Rehman, was
present on a thoroughfare near the house of Wakil ur
Rehman when at 1810 hours, the petitioners along with
co-accused Nisar, Aziz, Usman Ali and Wisal, duly armed
/ with firearms came there and opened fire at them, as a
result, his uncle sustained injury while he luckily remained

unscathed. Motive behind the occurrence is that prior to the
occurrence, son of accused Nisar was forbidden by the
injured from using a thoroughfare, hence, this case.

3. Despite service complainant is not in attendance.
Being bail application cannot be kept pending for an
indefinite period for the sole reason to procure the
attendance of complainant, who otherwise, has been duly
served. In this view of the matter, after hearing learned
counsel for the petitioner and worthy AAG, this petition is
being decided on the available record.

4. Before adverting to the bail plea of the petitioners,
I deem it appropriate to decide first Cr.Misc.No.87-
P/2020, filed by learned counsel for the petitioners for
deciding the controversy as to whether in cases of an
attempt to commit qatl-i-Amd (324 PPC), it would be
legally justified at bail stage to sent the case(s) to the
prosecution for insertion of sections of law governing the
hurt caused to injured of the case(s)?.

5. Learned counsel for the petitioners argued that by
sending case(s) registered under section 324 PPC, to the
prosecution for insertion of sections of law pertaining to
hurt always results into filing of fresh bail application(s) by
the accused person(s) right from the court of learned
Judicial Magistrate till this court which not only increase
the agonies of the parties but also multiply the pendency,
putting extra burden on the racks of the courts. He

contended that section 324 PPC by itself is exclusive in
pe

nature which not only provides punishments for attempt to
commit Qatl-i-amd, but in addition, also provides
punishment for the hurt caused, therefore, insertion of
sections of law in the FIR for the hurt caused at bail stage,
is not the requirement of law, because such exercise is the
sole discretion of the trial Court, which after recording
evidence of the medical officer determines the proper
section for the hurt caused. He added that it is also the job
of the learned trial Court to alter the charge at any stage of
the proceedings, whereas, any such direction of this court
at bail stage shall tie the hands of the trial Courts in
framing of charge at the trial stage.

6. I am in agreement with the submissions of learned
counsel for the petitioner for the reasons that section 324
PPC provides two types of punishments, one for the
offence of an attempt to commit qatl-i-Amd and another
for the hurt caused, in addition to the punishment of the
offence of attempt to commit qatl-i-Amd. What the court(s)
is/are required at bail stage to do is the determination of
prima facie connectivity or otherwise of an accused
seeking bail in light of the tentative assessment of the
material on record coupled with the story of the
prosecution in the FIR. Even if any section of law has been
omitted by the prosecution, the court may take the same
into consideration from the material on record. The courts

are not bound to deal with the cases in light of the sections
ofl

of law leveled by the prosecution; rather what offence(s)
can be made out from the material on record shall be taken
into consideration. On legal premises, insertion of section
of law in a case is the sole prerogative of the Investigating
Agency at the investigation stage; secondly, by the
prosecution Branch, and lastly, the trial Court at the time of
framing of charge on the basis of the material available on
file against an accused. Under section 227 Cr.P.C., the
court may alter or add to any charge at any time before
judgment is pronounced. Even otherwise, without
altercation of charge, the trial Court has ample powers
under sections 237 and 238 Cr.P.C. to award punishment
under a penal section, irrespective of the fact that charge
under the said section had not been framed, particularly, in
the circumstances when charge had been framed in a
section providing major punishment, whereas the accused
is being awarded minor punishment.

7. In this view of the matter, sending of case to the
prosecution at bail stage for insertion of sections of law by
this court would amount to interference in investigation
which exercise has been disliked and deprecated by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in plethora of judgments, some of
which may be referred ie. Wali Muhamamd alias Walia
vs Haq Nawaz and 03 others (1971 SCMR_ 717
Shahnaz Begum Vs the Hon’ble Judges of the High
Court of Sindh and Baluchistan _and_another” (PLD
3B.

1971 Supreme Court 677), Brig.(Rtd) Imtiaz Ahmad vs
Government of Pakistan through Secretary, Interior
Division Islamabad and 02 others (1994 SCMR 2142),
Mazhar Naeem Qureshi vs the State (1999 SCMR 828)
and_Pordil_ Khan _vs_the State_through Advocate
General Khyber _Pakhtunkhwa and 11 others (2016
MLD 314).

8. In view of the above, I am firm in my view to hold
that sending of case file to the prosecution by this Court
while dealing with bail matter of accused, is not legally
justified. Such exercise is nothing but to increase the
agonies of the litigants and burdened the courts with extra
labour.

9. Coming to merits of the case for the purpose of
bail of the petitioner, as per medico legal report, the injured
has sustained a solitary firearm entry wound with
corresponding exit on his chest for which by attributing a
general role of indiscriminate firing, seven accused
including the petitioners are charged. The injury sustained
by the injured has not been specifically attributed to
anyone of the petitioners. Fire shot of which of the seven
accused proved effective and sharing of common intention
of the remaining accused with the accused of effective fire
shot is yet to be determined during trial after recording
evidence by the learned trial Court. Similarly, escape of the

complainant from indiscriminate firing of seven accused,
who at the time of occurrence was in close proximity of the
injured, is yet another begging question which makes the
case of the petitioners arguable for the purpose of bail,
hence, they are entitled to the concession of bail.

10, Accordingly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioners are admitted to bail provided each one
of them furnishes bail bonds to the tune of rupees two lacs
with two local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the
like amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD concerned.
