ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, J:- This criminal appeal, filed

by Momin Khan, the appellant, is directed against the

judgment dated 22.07.2017. of learned

Court/Additional Sessions Judge-I, Swabi, whereby he has

been convicted and sentenced, in case FIR No.781 dated

06.07.2013, Police Station Swabi, as under:-
Under 302(b) PPC:- To undergo imprisonment
for life as Ta’azir and to pay Rs.20,00,000/-, as

and in default thereof to undergo 06 months S.I.
Under section 324 PPC: To undergo 03 years
rigorous imprisonment and to pay a fine of

Rs.25,000/-.
2. As per contents of FIR (Exh.PA) the prosecution
case is that on 06.07.2013 at 1600 hours, deceased then
injured Ehtisham aged 19/20 years, in company of injured,
Abuzar aged 16/17 years and minor Sana, were brought to
casualty of District Headquarter (DHQ) hospital Swabi
where Ehtisham reported the matter to Shoaib Khan SI
(PW.5), in presence of Casualty Medical Officer (CMO) to
the effect that on the fateful day he alongwith his uncles,
namely, Muzamil Shah and Mantariq Shah (PW.14), was
present on main road near the Hujra of one Jalil situated at
Khandary Maniri Payan when at 1530 hours, Momin the
appellant along with Amir, Talha and Feroz (absconding
co-accused), duly armed with firearms came there and
opened fire at them with the intention to commit their
murder, as a result, he got hit and injured, whereas, his
uncles named-above, luckily remained unscathed. Due to
firing of the accused, Abuzar and a minor girl Sana also
sustained injuries. After the occurrence, the accused
decamped from the spot. In addition to the deceased then
injured the occurrence is stated to have been witnessed by
his uncles named-above. A previous blood feud between
the parties has been alleged as motive behind the
occurrence. Report of the deceased then injured was
reduced into writing in the shape of Murasila Exh.PA/1 by
Shoaib Khan SI (PW.5) which was verified by Mustaqeem

Shah (PW.9), on the basis of which FIR Exh.PA was
registered against the appellant and absconding co-
accused. PW.5 then prepared injury sheets of injured
Abuzar and Ehtisham Exh.PW.2/2 and Exh.PW.4/1,
respectively and referred them for medical examination.
Dr. Mukammil Khan SMO DHQ Swabi (PW.4) examined
injured Abuzar and Ehtisham vide medico legal reports
Exh.PW.4/1 and Exh.PW.4/2, respectively. He also
endorsed the injury sheet of injured Ehtisham and Murasila
report Exh.PA/1. After first aid, the then injured Ehtisham
was referred to LRH, Peshawar, where he succumbed to
the injuries, hence, at 10.55 p.m. Dr. Muhammad Kabir
(PW.11) conducted his autopsy and furnished report
Exh.PM. Minor Sana was medically examined by lady Dr.
Shahida (PW.2).

3. Shehzad Khan SI (PW.13), was entrusted the task
of investigation, who proceeded to the spot and prepared
site plan Exh.PB on the pointation of eyewitnesses. During
spot inspection he secured bloodstained earth from the
place of injured Abuzar, Sana and deceased then injured
vide recovery memos Exh.PW.8/1 to Exh.PW.8/2. Vide
recovery memo Exh.PW.8/3 he took into possession three
empties of 9 MM Exh.P.7 from the place of absconding
co-accused Amir. Likewise, through recovery memos
Exh.Pw.8/3, Exh.PW.3/1 and Exh.PW.3/2, he took into
possession the bloodstained garments of the injured and

the deceased then injured in presence of witnesses,
recorded statements of the PWs u/s 161 Cr.P.C., sent the
empties to the FSL for safe custody, and _ initiated
proceedings under section 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. against the
accused. After completion of investigation he handed over
case file to the SHO for submission of challan under
section 512 Cr.P.C. against the accused.

4. On arrest of the appellant and completion of
necessary investigation supplementary challan was
submitted against him before the learned trial Court, where
he was formally charge-sheeted to which he pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial. To prove guilt of the appellant, the
prosecution examined as many as fourteen witnesses. After
closure of the prosecution evidence, statement of the
appellant was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein
he denied the prosecution allegations and professed his
innocence. He, however, refused to be examined on oath
under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. or to produce evidence in
defence. On conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court,
after hearing both the sides, convicted and sentenced the
appellant as mentioned above, hence, this appeal.

5. We have heard the arguments of learned counsel
for the parties and perused the record with their able
assistance.

6. It appears from record that during _ trial,
PW Muzamil Shah, one of the purported eyewitnesses, has

been abandoned as he was absconding in a murder case.
Similarly, injured Abuzar aged 16/17 years has been
abandoned being unnecessary, whereas, injured minor
Sana being not competent to answer rational questions, has
also been abandoned.

In view of the above, the case of the prosecution
hinges upon the testimony of Muntariq Shah (PW.14), the
purported eyewitness, Mustaqeem Shah PW.9 (verifier of
the Murasila), dying declaration of the deceased then
injured Ehtisham, medical evidence in the shape of medico
legal reports of injured and the autopsy report of the
deceased then injured; recovery of blood from the spot,
positive Serologist report qua the blood secured from the
spot and the bloodstained garments of the injured and the
deceased as well as recovery of three crime empties of 9
MM Bore.

7. First of all we are taking the testimony of Muntariq
Shah (PW.14). In examination-in-chief he has narrated the
same story as set forth by the deceased then injured in his
initial report Exh.PA/1. In cross-examination he deposed
that he and PW Muzamil Shah (abandoned), accompanied
the deceased then injured to the hospital where the police
in our presence recorded his statement. He further deposed
that Mustaqeem Shah did not accompany them to the
hospital, rather, he himself reached the hospital. Contrary
to his statement, Mustaqgeem Shah while appearing as

PW.9 deposed that he accompanied the deceased then
injured Ehtisham to DHQ Swabi from Swabi Adda, who
reported to police in injured condition in presence of the
doctor and he (PW.9), verified his report. The testimony of
Mustaqeem Shah (PW.9), excludes the presence of PW
Mantariq Shah at the time of shifting the deceased then
injured to the hospital and at the time of report allegedly
made by the deceased then injured. Perusal of initial report
Exh.PA/1 reveals that it does not bear the signature or
thumb impression of alleged eyewitness Mantariq Shah. If
at all PWs Mantariq Shah and Muzamil Shah (abandoned)
were present with the deceased then injured at the spot and
then in the hospital, then instead of verifying report of the
deceased then injured by PW Mustaqeem Shah, they
would have verified the same. No explanation, much less,
plausible has been furnished by PW Mantariq Shah as to
why he or abandoned PW Muzamil Shah did not
signed/thumb impressed the report of the deceased then
injured as verifier. Similarly, the Author of Murasila has
also not furnished any explanation to the effect that when
he recorded the report of the deceased then injured where
PWs Muntariq Shah and Muzamil Shah were shown as
eyewitnesses they why the report was not verified through
them. Contradicting the report Exh.PA/1, PW Mantariq
Shah deposed that he provided cell phone number to the
police when report of the deceased then injured was being

recorded and he also thumb impressed the report. As stated
above, report of the deceased then injured Exh.PA/1 does
not bear the thumb impression of PW Mantariq Shah. He
further deposed that after 10/15 minutes the deceased then
injured was referred to Peshawar, however, neither he nor
abandoned PW Muzamil Shah accompanied the deceased
then injured to Peshawar despite the fact that the injured
was the nephew of the above named PWs. This part of
statement of PW Mantariq Shah is squarely against the
natural conduct of an uncle. Though he along with
Muzamil Shah, accompanied the deceased then injured to
DHQ Swabi but what prompted him immediately to leave
his nephew on mercy of other relatives and did not
accompany him to hospital in Peshawar. He further
deposed that enmity of the accused was not only confined
to Ehtisham deceased then injured, rather it was also with
them. In the site plan Exh.PB, though the PW Mantariq
Shah and Muzamil Shah have been shown present at a
distance of 8 to 14 paces from the accused, but no one
from them has received a single firearm injury despite that
they were under the indiscriminate firing of four accused
armed with lethal weapons and were at their mercy. It is
not the case of prosecution that the purported eyewitnesses
took shelter during the firing. In this view of the matter
escape of the PWs or letting them off by the accused so as
to stand witnesses against them is beyond the

comprehension of a prudent mind. PW Mantariq Shah and
Muzamil Shah have been shown in the site plan Exh.PB
near wall of Hujra of Jalil, but no bullet marks or spent
bullet have been noticed by the I.O. on the wall of the said
Hujra behind them. In the site plan near the spot house of
one Matlab and shops of Waqar, Yahya and Muqarab have
been shown but none of them has either been examined by
the I.O or produced by the purported eyewitness in support
of their version or at least to the extent of their presence at
the spot after the occurrence. Medical report of deceased
then injured Ehtisham bears the name of one Jawad but his
statement has neither been recorded by the I.O. nor by the
author of the Murasila. PW Mantariq Shah deposed that
said Jawad is not known to him and he is not his neighbor.
PW Mantariq Shah has not given any explanation, much
less, plausible with regard to purpose of their presence at
the spot on the day of occurrence. During cross
examination he was also confronted with his statement
recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C. by the defence by
putting certain questions replies of which amounts to
dishonest improvements. In view of the contradictions,
discrepancies and dishonest improvements in the testimony
of PW Mantariq Shah, we are firm in our view that he is
not eyewitness of the occurrence. He failed to establish his
presence at the spot at the time of occurrence through
cogent and reliable evidence, therefore, we disbelieve his

testimony.
8. As stated above, PW Muzamil Shah and injured
PW Abuzar, have been abandoned by the prosecution on
the ground that the former was absconding in a murder
case and the latter become unnecessary to produce and
examine him. Injured PW Abuzar was an independent
witness being not related to either party, therefore, his
testimony could play a decisive role in this case, therefore,
his non-production in the witness box amounts to
withholding the best available evidence, as such an adverse
inference within the meaning of Article 129 (g) of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 would be draw against the
prosecution that had he been produced he would not have
supported the prosecution case.

9. Adverting to the dying declaration of the deceased
then injured Eshtisham, suffice it to say that dying
declaration is a statement of a deceased person as to cause
of his death when he is at the point of death. No doubt,
sanctity is attached to a dying declaration because a dying
man is not expected to tell lies, but being weak kind of
evidence, it requires close scrutiny and corroboration from
circumstantial evidence. At different occasions the august
Supreme Court of Pakistan has settled some of the well
known tests for determining the genuineness of dying
declaration which are (i) whether it rings true (ii) whether
the dying man was capable of making it (iii) whether it

was free from outside prompting and was not inconsistent
10

with other evidence, facts and circumstances of the case
(iv) whether the deceased then injured was capable to
identify the assailant (s). To find out truth or falsity of a
dying declaration a case is generally considered in all its
physical environment and circumstances. It is necessary to
find out how far the evidence or its different parts fit in
with the circumstances and possibility that can safely be
deducted in a particular case. Therefore, in order to pass
the test of reliability, a dying declaration has to be
subjected to a very close scrutiny, keeping in view the fact
that such statements are made in absence of an accused,
which has no opportunity of testing the veracity of the
statement by cross examination.

10. In case titled, Mst. Zahida Bibi Vs The State”
(PLD 2006 Supreme Court 255 it has been held by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan that dying declaration
like the statement of an interested witness requires close
scrutiny and is not to be believed merely for the reason that
dying person is not expected to tell a lie. Likewise, rule
25-21 of the Police Rules,1834, speak about the essential
ingredients to be followed during recording of dying
declaration, which for the sake of convenience and ready
reference is reproduced below:-

25-21 Dying Declaration:-

(1) A dying declaration shall, whenever
possible, be recorded by a magistrate.
11

(2) The person making the declaration shall,
if possible, be examined by medical
officer with a view to ascertaining that
he is sufficiently in possession of his
reason to make a lucid statement.

(3) If no magistrate can be obtained, the
declaration shall, when a gazetted police
officer is not present, be recorded in the
presence of two or more reliable
witnesses unconnected with the police
department and with the parties
concerned in the case.

(4) If no such witnesses can be obtained
without risk of the injured person dying
before his statement can be recorded, it
shall be recorded in the presence of two
or more police officers.

(5) <A dying declaration made to a police
Officer should, under section 162, Code
of Criminal Procedure, be signed by the
person making it.

11. In view of the law and the precedent referred
above, the first point for consideration is whether the
deceased then injured was capable to talk and able to make
a statement. No doubt, Author of Murasila and Mukammil
Khan SMO (PW.4) in his medico legal report have
mentioned that the deceased then injured was conscious
and well oriented in time and space, but the firearms
entrance wounds on the person of the deceased then
injured reflects otherwise which makes the statements of
the Medical Officer and author of Murasila doubtful. As
per autopsy report the deceased then injured has sustained
firearm entry wound on right side of forehead measuring
1xl cm above lateral boarder of eyebrow with
corresponding exit on right side face below eye 1 cm from
nose. Similarly, has also sustained firearm entry wound on

right side front of his abdomen with corresponding exit on
12

back of his abdomen. In view of the aforesaid injuries on
most vital parts, capability and ability of the deceased then
injured to make statement/talk is beyond the
comprehension of a prudent mind. Besides, in the medico
legal report firearm entry on right side of forehead of the
deceased then injured has not been shown. Similarly, in the
medico legal report total seven firearm wounds including
entrance, exit and lacerated have been shown on the person
of the deceased with 0.5x1 dimension of all entrance
wounds, whereas, in the autopsy report total twelve firearm
wounds including entrance and exit have been shown on
the person of the deceased. Dimension of one entrance
wound has been shown as 1x1 cm and the remaining as
0.5x0.5 cm. Firearm entry wound on right side of forehead
of the deceased has not been shown in the medico legal
report purposely so as to prove capability and ability of
making statement of the deceased then injured.
Admittedly, the dying declaration of the deceased then
injured as not been recorded in accordance with the law
and rules mentioned above.

12. We are facing yet another ambiguity qua recording
of the alleged dying declaration by Shoaib Khan SI
(PW.5). The moment, the injured was brought to casualty,
Murasila was drafted at 4.00 p.m. and the injured was
referred to casualty Medical Officer through FC Tauseef,

who examined the him at 4.00 p.m. The Murasila was
13

verified by Mustaqeem Shah son of Malik Shah, but the
medico legal report shows presence of one Jawad at the
time of medical examination of the injured. Mustaqeem
Shah (PW.9), the alleged verifier of the dying declaration,
in cross-examination deposed that injured was shifted to
the hospital by neighbours, however, he could not
disclosed their names. The above named Jawad was
neither examined nor abandoned for the reason best known
to the prosecution; however, it suggests that initially
injured Ehtisham was brought to the hospital by
neighbours including Jawad, who has rightly noticed by
the CMO at the time of medical examination of injured
Ehtisham. Had said Jawad been examined, he would have
clarified the actual position about dying declaration.

13. From the above it is manifest that initially, the
decease then injured was brought to the hospital by
neighbors wherein one Jawad was present at the time of
medical examination. The Murasila was delayed till arrival
of the PW Mustaqeem Shah, verifier of the Murasila, who
as stated earlier is not the eyewitness of the occurrence
because at the time of occurrence he has shown himself in
Swabi Adda, whereform he allegedly accompanied the
deceased then injured to the hospital. The above discussed
circumstances clearly suggest that the report Exh.PA/1 has
not been recorded on the statement of the deceased then

injured rather it is a manipulated document which does not
14

find corroboration from any direct or circumstantial
evidence. No crime empty has been shown recovered from
the place of the appellant. Similarly, no crime weapon has
been shown recovered either from his direct or indirect
possession. Total four accused including the appellant have
been charged for firing at the deceased whereas as per
medico legal report of the deceased then injured all the
wounds on his body were found of one and the same
dimension, but as per autopsy report of the deceased, the
two type of dimensions of entrance wounds have been
shown on the deceased, which indicate that the occurrence
may be the doing of at the most two persons. The alleged
recovered 3 crime empties have not been sent to the FSL
so as to ascertain the number of accused. The dying
declaration of the deceased then injured is not corroborated
by any other circumstantial evidence to prove participation
of the appellant in the commission of offence. Similarly,
the dying declaration has also not been recorded in
accordance with the rules and the settled law. The case has
not been registered through direct FIR in Police Station
rather in the shape of Murasila.

14. The above discussed facts and circumstances of
the case have been ignored by the learned trial Court,
therefore, reached to an erroneous conclusion by holding
the appellant guilty of the offence. Resultantly, this appeal

is allowed, conviction and sentences of the appellant
15

recorded by the learned trial Court vide impugned
judgment dated 22.07.2017 is hereby set-aside and he is
acquitted of the charge leveled against him. He be set at
liberty forthwith, if not confined in any other case.

15. These are reasons of our short order of even date
which is reproduced below:-

“For reasons to be recorded later, we allow
this appeal, set-aside the conviction and
sentences of appellant, namely, Momin Khan
son of Asim Khan, recorded under sections
324 and 302 (b) PPC, by the learned trial
