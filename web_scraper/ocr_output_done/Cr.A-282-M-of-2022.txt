JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD _NAEEM_ ANWAR, _J.- Through instant

appeal under section 410, Cr.P.C., the appellant/convict has
challenged the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge/Zilla
Qazi, Buner at Daggar, dated 24.09.2022 in case FIR No.
165 dated 04.02.2018 w/s 302/34 PPC of P.S Pir Baba,
District Buner, whereby he was convicted under section
302(b)/34 PPC and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment
as Ta’azir with fine of Rs.500,000/- as compensation
payable to LRs of the deceased in terms of section 544-A,
Cr.P.C, or in case of default thereof to undergo further six
months S.I. Benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C was extended

to him.

2. Precise facts of the case are that complainant
Mian Syed Wahab Bacha made a report to police on

04.02.2018 to the effect that, he along with his son Syed

Tajarnut/cs*| 0B: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
Hussain Shah Bacha were present in their Hujra on
04.02.2018, the appellant Syed Farman Ali Shah along with
his brother/absconding accused Syed Ali Shah came to their
Hujra at about 17:30 hours and started altercation with his
son for their share in the said Hujra and aimed to lock the
main door of the Hujra on which a fight took place between
them. During the quarrel, co-accused Syed Ali Shah took out
his pistol and fired at Syed Hussain Shah Bacha as a result
of which he got hit on his back. Motive for the occurrence
was stated to be the property dispute. The injured later on

succumbed to the injuries.

3. Initially, both the accused remained absconders,
therefore, challan against them under section 512, Cr.P.C
was submitted before the Court and they were declared as
proclaimed offenders. The present appellant was arrested on
08.08.2020 and, after completion of _post-arrest
investigation, he was recommended for trial through
submission of supplementary challan. Formal charge was
framed against him to which he did not plead guilty and
opted to face the trial. In order to further substantiate its case
against the appellant, prosecution produced and examined as
many as thirteen witnesses and closed the evidence. When
examined under section 342, Cr.P.C. the appellant denied

the charged, however, he neither recorded his own statement

Tajamul/cs*| oB: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
on oath nor produced any evidence in his defence. On
conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court vide impugned
judgment convicted and sentenced him, the detail of which

has been given in the earlier portion of this judgment, hence,

instant appeal.
4. Arguments heard and record perused.
5. It is the version of prosecution, that the present

appellant alongwith his absconding co-accused entered the
Hujura of deceased and during altercation/scuffle with him
and his father, the co-accused fired at the deceased with his
pistol which subsequently caused his death. Admittedly,
complainant in his initial report as well as in his statement
before the learned trial Court has ascribed the role of firing
upon the deceased to co-accused Said Ali Shah. The other
eye-witness Shahab-ud-Din (PW-12) also recorded his
statement in the same line. The learned trial Court has
convicted and sentenced the present appellant for murder of
the deceased on the ground of his common intention with his
co-accused by holding that both the accused, having the
common motive, had jointly entered the Hujra of deceased
and during a scuffle with him, the co-accused fired at the
deceased whereafter both of them jointly decamped from the
spot. In order to know the conditions for holding an accused

constructively liable for an offence under section 34 PPC

Tajamul/cs*| DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’! _ Justi Khan
and the basic ingredients thereof, the provision is reproduced

below for ready perusal.

34. Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common
intention. When a criminal act is done by several persons, in
furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons
is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him
alone.

Section 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code is also on
the same subject but the same deals with vicarious liability
of members of unlawful assembly in prosecution of their

common object. Section 149, PPC reads as under:

149. Every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence
committed in prosecution of common object. If an offence is
committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in
prosecution of the common object of that assembly, or such as
the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed
in prosecution of that object, every person who, at the time of the
committing of that offence, is a member of the same assembly, is
guilty of that offence.

The main differences between the two provisions
are that the former deals with commission of a crime by
accused less than five in number under their “common
intention” whereas the latter deals with vicarious liability of
members of unlawful assembly of five or more accused in
furtherance of their “common object”, however, constructive
liability of the accused is the main theme of both the referred
provisions under sections 34 and 149 of the Pakistan Penal
Code. The learned trial Court has discussed vicarious
liability of the appellant in Para 9 of the judgment wherein

mainly the principles governing constructive liability of

Tajamul/cs+| OB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ af Khan

accused have been discussed but no discussion was made
that on what grounds the murder of deceased was an
organized commission of the crime by the accused. The
learned trial Court has also not clarified in light of evidence
that whether the accused had come to Hujra of the deceased
after a pre-concert between them or they had formed their
common intention for the murder at spur of the moment.
Criminal intention of an accused or pre-concert or pre-
arrangement of several accused cannot be proved through
direct evidence in each case, however, the same can be
inferred from the facts disclosed in evidence and
surrounding circumstances of the case. Since, co-accused of
the appellant is still absconding, therefore, we would confine
our discussion only to liability of the appellant under his
common intention with his co-accused as alleged by
prosecution and in this regard only the relevant evidence

needs to be thrashed out.

6. Admittedly, complainant Mian Syed Wahab
Bacha is real paternal uncle of the present appellant and his
co-accused. According to the version of prosecution, the
accused had entered the Hujra, appearing to be joint holding
of the parties, and made a demand of their share in the said
Hujra by disclosing their intention that they were going to

close the main gate of the said building. Joint entry of both

Tajamuycs*| DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
the accused into Hujra cannot be denied in light of direct
and circumstantial evidence, however, the moot question
is whether entry of the appellant into the Hujra in the
company of his co-accused in the mode and manner as
reflecting from the evidence is sufficient to establish that
he was sharing his intention with his co-accused for
committing murder of the deceased? There is no evidence
on record to suggest any previous bitterness of serious
nature between the parties prior to the occurrence,
therefore, in view of their close relationship with each
other, mere joint entry of the accused in the Hujra cannot
be viewed with suspicion that there was pre-concert or
pre-arrangement between them for commission of the
offence. No doubt, there was motive of dispute over share
of the accused in the Hujra where the occurrence took
place, however, the common motive of both the accused
alone was not sufficient to prove that the appellant and his
co-accused had entered the Hujra in furtherance of their
common intention for committing the murder of deceased.

There is no evidence on record to prove that any pre-
consultation or pre-planning had taken place between both
the accused before the occurrence nor the said elements can

be inferred from the surrounding facts of the case. PW-12

Tajamuycs*| DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
admitted in his cross-examination that the appellant was not
having any pistol at the time of occurrence. The fact that the
appellant was empty handed at the relevant time suggests
that neither any pre-planning had taken place between both
the accused before the occurrence nor the appellant had the
knowledge that his brother/co-accused was in possession of
weapon nor he anticipated any quarrel with the complainant
side culminating in murder of the deceased. It is a matter of
common observation in this society that close relatives carry
weapons with them on the occasions when they apprehend
that a fight will likely take place with the other side. Had the
appellant any intention of fight with the complainant or had
he apprehended the same or had he the knowledge that his
brother was carrying a pistol with him while going to the
Hujra, he would have also carried some weapon with him at
least for his self defence. In view of the above attending
facts, prior concert of the appellant with his co-accused or
his pre-arranged plan with him for murder of the deceased
cannot be inferred from the evidence on record. The general
rule governing the constructive liability of several accused
for a crime is that there should be prior concert and pre-
arranged plan because before an accused can be vicariously
convicted for the criminal act of another, the act must have

been done in furtherance of the common intention of them

Tajamul/cs*| DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
ble Mr,
all. In this regard we would refer the judgment of the apex
Court in the case titled “Muhammad Yaqoob, Sub-
Inspector Vs. The State” reported as PLD 2001 S.C 378. It
was further observed in the said judgment that all that is
necessary is either to have direct proof of prior concert, or
proof of circumstances which necessarily led to that
inference or the incriminating facts must be incompatible
with the innocence of the accused and incapable of
explanation on any other reasonable hypothesis. Thus, mere
joint entry of the appellant with his co-accused into the
Hujra is not sufficient to establish that he had common
intention with his co-accused for committing the murder of
deceased especially when he was unarmed at the relevant

time and no overt act was attributed to him during the fight.

Z We have in our mind the settled principle of law
as observed by apex Court in the case titled “Ali Imran Vs.
The State” (PLD 2006 S.C 87) that it is not necessary that
evidence of pre-consultation or concert should be clearly
brought on the record rather sometimes common intention
may develop at the spur of the moment or during
commission of offence. Learned counsel for the complainant
stressed this point mainly on the ground of joint entry of
both the accused in Hujra of the complainant and their

scuffle with the complainant and deceased. According to

Tajamuycs*| DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
him, since the accused had common motive and they had
made entry into the Hujra at the same time, therefore, the
learned trial Court, while convicting the appellant for
murder of the deceased, has rightly attracted section 34, PPC
to the case of appellant. Each criminal case rests on its own
facts and circumstances in light whereof guilt or innocence
of an accused is to be determined with proper recourse to
ocular account and incriminating recoveries. The version of
prosecution qua the effective firing upon the deceased
specifically attributed to co-accused Said Ali Shah is clear
and unambiguous, therefore, appreciation of the evidence in
the same line qua culpability of the present appellant is
neither required nor warranted in view of the abscondence of
the co-accuse. The question for resolution before this Court
is whether any direct evidence or circumstances exist from
which it can be inferred that common intention of the
‘
appellant with his co-accused had developed at spur of the
moment or during commission of the offence? Complainant
alleged that both the accused scuffled with him and his
deceased son but except the above bald statement there is no
evidence from which independent role of the appellant in the
occurrence could be ascertained. Learned counsel for the
complainant was of the view that for application of section

34, PPC, it is not necessary that the accused should perform

Tajamul/cs*| DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
a in

any act with his own hands. In this regard he relied upon

“Rab Nawaz and others Vs. The State” (2015 P Cr. L J
1531 _ Sindh) and “Muhammad Arif and others Vs. The
State and others” (2008 YLR 580 Shariat Court AJ & K).

The rule emerging from the aforementioned dicta is that if
several persons had the common intention of doing a
particular criminal act and if, in furtherance of that common
intention all of them joined together and aided or abetted
each other in the commission of an act and one out of them
did not do the act with his own hand but helped by his
presence or by other act in the commission of an act, he
would be held to have himself done that act within the
meaning of section 34, PPC. The rule primarily speaks about
doing of a criminal act by several accused in furtherance of
their common intention, which must be proved through
direct evidence and if direct evidence is not available then
the same may be inferred from circumstances of the case.
Complainant or PW-12 have not attributed even a single
overt act to appellant in the present case during the fight to
be considered for aiding or abetting his co-accused at the
time of firing at the deceased. The ocular account, in respect
of the present appellant, can only establish his presence on
the spot but none of the PWs have explained his independent

role or the manner he had aided or abetted the absconding

Tajarnul/cs*| 0B: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Mi in

co-accused. Ratio of the judgments referred to by learned
counsel for the complainant is that when common intention
of several accused is established on the record then it is
immaterial that who had played what role. The above rule is

also reflecting from “Sh. Muhammad Abid Vs. The State”

(2011 SCMR 1148), wherein it has been held that once it
was found that accused persons had common intention to
commit crime, it was immaterial as to what part was played
by whom, as vicarious liability was that who had stood
together, must have fallen together. The words ‘once it was
found’ used by their lordships in the afore-referred judgment
have great significance which implies that proof of common
intention of several accused for committing a crime or
inference thereof by Court from circumstances of the case is
a condition precedent, as such, when the common intention
is neither proved through evidence nor could be inferred
from the circumstances then the accused could not be held
vicariously liable for commission of the crime under section
34 PPC merely on the ground that he was present on the spot
at the time of occurrence. Guidance is taken from “Hasan
Din Vs. Muhammad Mushtaq and others” (1978 SCMR
49) wherein it has been held that mere presence of a person
on the spot does not necessarily attract section 34, PPC.

Thus, the judgments relied upon by learned counsel for the

Tajamul/cs*| 0B: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
ic
-12-

complainant cannot be applied to the present case in view of

its peculiar facts and circumstances.

& Section 34, PPC is neither punitive, nor it enacts
a rule of evidence but mainly relates to joint liability. Such
vicarious liability of an accused could not be determined in
vacuum rather the evidence on record requires to be
analyzed with due care and caution so that an innocent
person may not be punished for a crime he neither intended
to commit himself nor aided or abetted the commission
thereof in any manner nor he had the knowledge that his co-
accused would commit the crime. In the case of Sadig and
two_others_ vs. The State (1990 SCMR 340) the accused
were acquitted by the Hon’ble Supreme Court on the ground
that though the accused were present at the scene of
occurrence but neither any role was attributed to them for
causing injury to the deceased nor any of the prosecution
witnesses. In the case of Abdul Rashid vs. The State (1989
SCMR 144) two brothers Abdul Rashid and Riaz Ahmad
were charged for the murder of Muhammad Hanif. They
were found guilty by the Additional Sessions Judge, Multan,
vide his judgment dated 15" February, 1979. Abdul Rashid
was sentenced to death and Riaz Ahmad to imprisonment for
life. Abdul Rashid was also ordered to pay a fine of

Rs.2,000 which on realization was ordered to be paid to the

Tajamul/cs*| DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

Hon’ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
-13-

heirs of Muhammad Hanif deceased. In appeal it was held
by the High Court that section 34, P.P.C. was not attracted to
his case and converted his conviction from one under section
302, P.P.C. read with section 34, P.P.C. to one under section
323, P.P.C. for causing hurt to Muhammad Hanif deceased
and ordered that since the appellant Riaz Ahmad had already
suffered sentence for more than one year which is the
maximum sentence provided for an offence under section
323, P.P.C., no further sentence of imprisonment was
required to be awarded to him. In appeal the hon’ble

Supreme Court has held that:

Moreover, there is no evidence that Riaz Ahmad knew
that Abdul Rashid was carrying any knife. Therefore,
he could be saddled with his own act which was causing
of simple injury to Muhammad Hanif.

In the case of Hasan vs. The State (1969 SCMR
454) the accused was acquitted by Hon’ble Supreme Court
by observing that proof of some overt act on part of each
accused in furthermore of common intention necessary and
mere presence of accused not-sufficient or conviction. In
light of the afore-referred dicta, the learned trial Court has
fallen in error by convicting the appellant for murder of the
deceased under section 34 PPC without attending the
evidence on record and circumstances of the case discussed

above.
