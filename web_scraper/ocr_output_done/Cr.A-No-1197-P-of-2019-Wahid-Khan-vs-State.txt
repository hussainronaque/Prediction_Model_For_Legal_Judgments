under section 15 KP Arms Act, 2013, but under the Act
ibid, the State would be the only aggrieved party in case of
acquittal of the accused, hence, the above appeal being
filed by the complainant is not maintainable, hence, is
hereby dismissed.

3. The criminal appeal filed by the appellant/convict
and the revision petition for enhancement of sentence filed
by complainant being emanating from one and the same
judgment of the learned trial Court, are being decided
through this single judgment.

4. The prosecution case as unfolded in the FIR is that
on 10.10.2017 at 0850 hours, complainant Mohabat Khan
(PW.5) alongside the dead body of his daughter Mst.
Khadija deceased in Trauma Room of LRH, Peshawar
reported to police that his deceased daughter was married
to Wahid Khan (appellant) some 8/9 years back. From the
wedlock of the spouses, two daughters and a son were
born. From sufficient time there was ill will between the
spouses over domestic affairs relating to women folk. On

the previous night he (complainant) had gone to the house
of his brother-in-law, namely, Riaz where Wahid Khan
along with his brother Zahid Khan (absconding
co-accused), came and make a complaint to him about
behavior of the deceased. He (complainant) advised them
to settle the dispute themselves as well he will also visit
their house for settlement of the dispute. On the fateful day,
at 0815 hours, he (complainant) received information that
his daughter Mst. Khadija has committed suicide with
firearm and her dead body has been shifted to LRH,
Peshawar. On the said information he reached the hospital
where he found dead body of his daughter having marks of
violence over her body, due to which he satisfied that she
has not committed suicide, rather has been murdered by her
husband Wahid Khan and his brother Zahid Khan. Report
of the complainant was reduced into writing in the shape of
Murasila Exh.PA by Noor Asghar ASI (PW.6) on the basis
of which FIR mentioned above was registered. He (PW.6)
prepared injury sheet and inquest report Exh.PW.6/1 and
Exh.PW.6/2 of the deceased and referred her dead body to
the mortuary where Dr. Maimona Murad (PW.9)
conducted post mortem examination and found the
following injuries on her person:-

1. A firearm entry wound on left side of front of chest
0.8.x0.8 cm in size, 2 cm away from midline and 4
cm below mid clavicle with surround tattooing

10x8 cm in size.
2. Firearm exit wound on left side of back 1x1 cm in
size, 4 cm away from midline, 15 cm below base
of skull.

3. Crescent shape laceration with irregular margin
seen on left thigh 3x1 cm in size, 10 cm above
kneed joint with surrounding bruised area of 6x6
cm.

4. Multiple bruises in linear atteren 10x5 cm in size
of different parts of body.

Opinion: The deceased died due to injuries to left lung and

corresponding vessels and chest wall due to firearm.

5. Doran Shah _ Inspector (PW.4) conducted
investigation in the case, who proceeded to the spot and
prepared site plan Exh.PB at his own observations. During
spot inspection he secured blood through cotton Exh.P.1
from the place of the deceased, two crime empties of 30
bore Exh.P.2, a spent bullet of 30 bore Exh.P.3 and a 30
bore pistol No.TA.29 along with magazine with 03 live
rounds of the same bore Exh.P.4 vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.3/1. Vide recovery memo Exh.sPW.4/1 he took
into possession the last worn bloodstained garments of the
deceased and sealed the same in parcel, placed on file
postmortem report of the deceased, sent the bloodstained
articles and the crime empties and pistol to the FSL, reports
whereof are Exh.PZ and Exh.PZ/1 respectively. He
initiated proceedings under section 204, 87 and 88 Cr.P.C.
against the accused, recorded statements of the PWs under

section 161 Cr.P.C. and on completion of investigation
handed over case file to SHO, who submitted challan under
section 512 Cr.P.C. against the accused.

6. After arrest of the accused/appellant Wahid Khan
and completion of necessary investigation, supplementary
challan was submitted against him before the learned trial
Court, where he was formally charge sheeted to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order to prove its
case, the prosecution examined as many as eleven
witnesses. After closure of the prosecution evidence,
statement of the appellant was recorded under section 342
Cr.P.C., wherein he denied the prosecution allegations and
professed innocence. He, however, declined to be
examined on oath under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C., or to
produce evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial, the
learned trial Court, convicted and sentenced the appellant
as mentioned in the first paragraph of the instant judgment,
hence, this appeal and revision.

7. We have considered the arguments of learned
counsel for the parties advanced at the bar and perused the
record with their able assistance.

8. No doubt, complainant is not the eyewitness of the
occurrence, however, it is an admitted fact that
Mst. Khadeja was the legally wedded wife of the appellant
Wahid Khan, residing with him in his house situated in
Yousafabad. It is also un-denied fact that the crime spot

shown by the prosecution is the residential room of
Mst. Khadeja and the appellant in a house, situated in
Yousafabad, Peshawar. The positive Serologist report
Exh.PZ with regard to the blood of the deceased secured
from the spot, confirms the place of occurrence to be the
room of the spouses i.e. the appellant and the deceased.
Neither in cross-examination of the PWs nor in his
statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. he has questioned the
place of occurrence. In this view of the matter, the first
circumstance which goes against the appellant is the
murder of his wife inside his room, therefore, at least onus
was on the shoulder of the appellant to explain about the
unnatural death of his wife. From inception of registration
of the case till his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C., the
appellant has nether negated his presence in his dwelling
house nor has taken any plea of his absence in the house on
the day and time of occurrence. The occurrence has taken
place at 10.10.2017 at 08.00 a.m. i.e. in early hours,
therefore, presence of the appellant in his house during
early hours in natural. The dispute between the spouses
over wrangle between the women folk in the family has
fully been proved by Mohabat Khan (PW.5), father of the
deceased Mst. Khadeja, who in his initial report has
directly charged the appellant and co-accused Zahid for
murder of his daughter on the ground that on the night of
the day of occurrence he was present in the house of his

brother-in-law, namely, Risaz when appellant Wahid Khan
and his brother Zahid Khan (absconding co-accused) came
there and complained against the behavior of his deceased
daughter. He (complainant) told them it being their internal
domestic matter they should settle at their own as well as
he (complainant) ensured them that in few days he will
visit their house for counseling his daughter Mst. Khadeja
deceased. The aforesaid version of the complainant has
been substantiated by Riaz, who while appearing as PW.11
deposed that on that day he was present in his home along
with guests in connection with fixation of date of marriage
of his daughter. Complainant Mohabat Khan was also
present in his house when in the meanwhile, absconding
co-accused Zahid called the complainant on mobile phone
to come out of the house. The complainant when came out
the accused threatened him of dire consequence to make
understand his daughter Mst. Khadeja to live good life in
the appellant’s house, otherwise he (complainant) will cry
her death. PW.11 further deposed that he and complainant
told the accused that being their domestic matter settle the
same themselves; however, on Friday they will visit their
home and will advice Mst. Khadeja deceased. On next
morning at 08.00 hours, the deceased was done to death
inside a room of the appellant. Admittedly, appellant is the
son-in-law of the complainant. His deceased daughter is
survived by three children i.e. two daughters and a son. On

the face of record, there exists no reason as to why he will
charge innocent father of his grand children, particularly, in
the circumstances when his grand children have already
been deprived of their mother. An iota of evidence is not
available on record remotely showing false implication of
the appellant by the complainant, either on the basis of any
previous grudge or ulterior motive. Post-mortem report
depicts that firearm injury to internal vital organs of the
deceased resulted in her death. Besides, the multiple
bruises in liner pattern on different party of body of the
deceased suggest that prior to murder the deceased has
been subjected to acute torture. Reading of the postmortem
report, would led one to the conclusion that fire shot on the
deceased was not immediate, rather she has been handled
recklessly and with a treat of extreme brutality.

9. Appellant being husband of the deceased was
legally, morally and ethically under an obligation to take
notice of murder of his wife or at least, if his hands were
not sullied with her blood, he should have shifted her dead
body to the hospital and made a report. Contrary, he went
into hiding and did not bother to participate in the funeral
ceremony of his deceased wife or at least to give courage
and support to his orphans’ children. The appellant has not
furnished any explanation, much less plausible, with regard
to his abscondence after the occurrence, thus, noticeable
and willful abscondence of the appellant speaks volume

about his guilty conscious. As observed in the preceding
para that appellant and the deceased (spouses) were
normally residing in one room of a dwelling house. The
appellant is charged for murder of his wife. The
prosecution has succeeded in proving that the spouses had
spent the night together in the room of their house. The
deceased/wife of the appellant has been murdered in early
morning inside her room; therefore, the appellant/husband
was under laden duty to explain the death of his wife. If he
could not offer any explanation how his wife received
injuries and bruises or offer any explanation which is found
to be false, it is a strong circumstance, which indicates that
he (the appellant) is responsible for murder of his wife.

10. The above discussed circumstances make an
unbroken chain, one end of which touches the dead body of
the deceased and another neck of the appellant. Though,
during cross-examination of the PWs the appellant has
tried his level best to make it a case of suicide, but on one
hand, he has not brought an iota of evidence to prove that
his deceased wife was fed up of her life and wanted to get
rid of herself, while on the other hand, medical evidence
belies his said plea. The marks of violence on the body of
the deceased in the shape of laceration and multiple bruises
coupled with recovery of two crime empties of 30 bore pistol,
a spent bullet from the spot and a 30 bore pistol from the room
of the appellant, coupled with positive FSL report in respect

thereof, squarely proves that the deceased has not
10

committed suicide rather she had been done to death by the
appellant.

11. For what has been discussed above, the
prosecution has proved the guilt of the appellant through
cogent and confidence inspiring circumstantial evidence
supported by medical evidence; hence, the learned trial
court has rightly held him guilty of the offence to which no
exception can be taken. As regards the quantum of
sentence, admittedly, the deceased is survived by two
daughters and a son, who have already lost their mother
and if they are also deprived from their father by awarding
him capital sentence, they would suffer to the maximum
because in absence of their parents, they would become
shelter less. Therefore, the sentence of life imprisonment
already awarded to the appellant by the learned trial Court
would be sufficient to meet the ends of justice.

12. Accordingly, this appeal and the connected
revision petition being meritless are hereby dismissed.
