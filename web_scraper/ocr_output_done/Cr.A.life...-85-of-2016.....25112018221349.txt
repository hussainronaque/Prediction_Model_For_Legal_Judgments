11: In this unfortunate and tragic incident, thew
minor children, namely, Mst. Shumaim Bibi, Hashim
and Sameer have lost their lives and the charge of their
Qatl-i-Amd was leveled by the complainant, father of
deceased against her wife, the present appellant. ‘The
appellant during investigation — recorded her
confessional statement, which was recorded by PW-9,
who at the time of occurrence was Judicial Magistrate,
Abbottabad, wherein, she stated that the complainant
at the time of leaving home for his duty gave her a

plastic bottle by saying that mix the same in “Ajwain
( ‘Costly? 1) and administer it to the children and she
could not understand that it was poison and she
thought that it was a medicine of cough and she mixed
the same in “Ajwain”; that she remained busy in
marriages of family and on 05.07.2013, Sameer at the
time of sleeping asked for “Ajwain” as he was
complaining of pain in stomach; that she picked up the
bowl of “Ajwain” and first of all Ilashim moved his
hand forward for the same; she gave “Ajwain” to him
and thereafter she also gave the same alongwith water
to other two children, however, the children started
weeping and she called her father-in-law (PW-8),
wives of younger and elder brothers of complainant,
who gave them ‘Desi Ghee’ but they could not survive
and lost their lives one by one and she was not aware
that the liquid . mixed in “Ajwain” was poison,

otherwise she would not have administered the same.

12. ‘The only material incriminating evidence in
this case against the present appellant is her
abovementioned confessional statement before the

Court. However, it is well settled principle of criminal
jurisprudence that whenever prosccution is relying on
solitary confessional statement of an accused in the
absence of direct ocular account or circumstantial
evidence, then confessional statement is to be accepted
or rejected in whole/toto. However, where direct
ocular account and = circumstantial evidence is
available, besides confessional statement of accused, in
that eventuality, the portion of confessional statement,
which is supporting the version of the prosecution
would be taken into consideration, whereas, other
portion of confessional — statement, which — is
inconsistent with it would not be taken into
consideration. Reliance is placed on case titled

“Ganga ram Versus The State (1999 P.Cr.L.J 490)”

and “Ajab Khan Versus The State (1995 MLD

1199)”. Admittedly, there is no ocular or direct
evidence against the appellant in this case. ‘This Court
would consider the confessional statement of the
appellant as a whole, wherein, she stated that the
complainant at the time of leaving home for his duty

eave her a plastic bottle by saying that mix the same
10

with “Ajwain® and on the eventful day on the
complaint of pain in stomach by Samcer, she gave the
same to him as well as to the other two children which
resulted into their death. The statement of appellant
would be taken into consideration in its entirety and
not mercly the inculpatory part of it to the exclusion of
the exculpatory part unless there is other reliable
evidence which supplements the prosecution case. ‘The
criminal cases are to be decided on the basis of cogent
and reliable and confidence inspiring evidence and not
on the basis of presumptions. ‘lhe prosecution has
produced Muhammad Gulistan (PW-8) grandfather of
deceased children and none else from other inmates of
the house was produced. PW Gulistan during cross-
examination admitted that the wife of his son Khuram
used to get ready the deceased children for school and
she would give them food when they returned home, as
the appellant never looked after her children. He
further admitted that mostly wife of Khurram uscd to
give meal to the children and on the eventful day, wife

of Khurram, Mst. Sabiah Bibi cooked vegetables and
they all had the same dinner including the children on
that night. The prosecution has failed to establish
allegation of illicit relations of the appellant with
anybody. The relations of complainant and appellant
being husband and wife were not established to be so
strained, which forced the appellant to such extent to
take life of her minor children. No plausible reason
has been furnished by the prosecution, which in
peculiar facts and circumstances of the present ‘case
would justify such an act and that too by a mother.
Having thus considered in this back-ground, this Court
has no doubt that the charge against the appellant has
not been proved beyond any shadow of reasonable
doubt.

13. It is well settled law that even a single doubt,
if found reasonable, would entitle the accused person
to acquittal and not a combination of several doubts.

Reliance is placed on case titled ‘Ghulam Qadir Vs.

The State’ (2008 SCMR 1221), wherein, it has held

that:

“It needs no reiteration that for the purpose

of giving benefit of doubt to an accused
person, more than one infirmity is not
required, a single — infirmity crating
reasonable doubt in the mind of a
reasonable and prudent mind regarding the
truth of charge-makers the whole case
doublful. Merely because the burden is on
accused to prove his innocence it does not
absolve the prosecution to prove its case
against the accused beyond any shadow of
doubt in this duty does not change or vary in

the case.”
Reliance is also placed on case law reported as_2009

SCMR 230, 1995 SCMR 1345, 2017 SCMR 596 and

2017 MR_ 709. In this view of the matter, ‘he

learned trial Court has not properly appreciated
evidence and the law applicable thereto, which needs
interference by this Court in its Appellate jurisdiction
to that extent.

14. Thus, in view of above discussion, this appeal
is allowed and the conviction and sentence awarded to
the appellant are set aside and she is acquitted of the
charge leveled against them in this case, who be

released forthwith, if not required in any other case.
Above are the detailed reasons for short order

of this Court of even date.
