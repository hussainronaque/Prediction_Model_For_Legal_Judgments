ORDER

Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, J.: | Post-mortem examination of
the deadbody of Shah Room Khan deceased had been conducted in
this case 40 minutes prior to registration of an FIR in respect of his
murder and in the Post-mortem Examination Report time of death
of the deceased had not been recorded in the relevant column. This
factor had irretrievably shaken the credibility of the FIR as well as
of the claimed presence of Ali Yar Khan complainant (PW3) with

the deceased at the time of occurrence. The other eyewitnesses
namely Zahid Khan (PW2) and Ishtiaq Khan (PW4) were related to
the deceased and were chance witnesses who ordinarily resided
about 5 and 2/3 kilometers away from the place of occurrence
respectively. The Imam of the concerned mosque wherein the

occurrence had taken place had not been produced as an
eyewitness nor any other independent eyews witness Was produced by
the prosecution. No proof regarding the alleged motive had been
adduced before the trial court and no weapon had been recovered
from the custody of respondent No. 1. In these circumstances the
High Court had concluded that the prosecution had failed to prove
its case against respondent No. 1 beyond reasonable doubt and we
have not been able to take any legitimate exception to the said
conclusion reached by the High Court. This petition is, therefore,

dismissed and leave to appeal is refused.
