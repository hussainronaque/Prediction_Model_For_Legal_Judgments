-2-

We propose to dispose of both these matters by this single
judgment as both have sprung out of one and the same

judgment dated 08.4.2017.

2. The prosecution story as unfolded in the FIR is that
on 31.03.2015 at 13.00 hours, complainant Allah Wasaya
(PW-7) reported the matter to the local police in emergency
room of civil hospital Paroa, that he alongwith his deceased
son, Asmatullah aged about 30/31 years were going to Jhoke
Jehandeer to attend marriage ceremony of sons of Sona Khan.
At 12.10 a.m, when they reached at Dus Dari Bridge on the
road to Jhok Jhand, the accused namely Naqeebullah armed
with pistol while Inayatullah armed with repeater (both sons of
Ghulam Hussain by caste Ghanera), their co-villagers were
coming from opposite side. On seeing them, they opened firing
at them with intention to kill them, resultantly, Asmatullah got
hit and fell down from the bridge into standing water while the
complainant escaped un-hurt. After the occurrence, accused
decamped from the spot, and upon his hue and cry people of
the village attracted to the spot, who pulled out Asmatullah
from water in injured/unconscious condition, then Asmatullah
was brought to civil hospital through a private vehicle,
however, he succumbed to his injuries before reaching to
hospital.

3. The report was recorded by ASI Tasawar Hussain
Shah (PW-8) who prepared injury sheet of the deceased

Ex.PW-5/1 and inquest report Ex.PW-5/2, dispatched the
-3-

murasila Ex. PA/1 to police station through constable Ghulam
Abbas, where it was incorporated into a formal FIR Ex. P.A.

According to him, distorted bullet was recovered from left

corresponding cut marks were handed over to police, to him,
-4-

probable time between injuries and death 30 to 45 minutes and
probable time between death and PM fresh.

6. On receipt of Murasila, Ejaz Hussain Shah S.I
(PW-11) conducted investigation. On arrival at the spot he
prepared the site plan Ex. PB at the instance of eye witnesses.
He recovered blood stained earth Ex.P-3, one pair of plastic
chappal Ex.P-4 and two empties of .30 bore Ex.P-5 and 04
empties of 12 bore giving smell of fresh discharge in presence
of Ahmad Bakhsh and Habib-ur-Rehman, searched house of
the accused, but they made themselves scarce, and examined
PWs. The warrants for the arrest of the accused under Section
204 Cr.P.C could not be executed, but it was returned
unserved, applied for issuance of proclamation, made
publication. On 20.04.2015, arrested both the accused. On their
personal search, recovered one 30 bore pistol alongwith fitted
magazine containing 07 live cartridges P-1 from accused
Naimatullah and license of the pistol Ex.P.1-A. Likewise, from
personal possession of accused Inayatullah recovered a
repeater alongwith fitted magazine containing 05 live rounds
Ex.P-2 and its license Ex. P.2-B, prepared pointation memo
Ex. PB of the accused. Dispatched crime articles to FSL,
placed its report on record as Ex. PK & PK/1 respectively. On
completion of investigation, handed over the case file to the
SHO for submission of challan.

7. The motive for the crime as alleged by the

complainant in the FIR is dispute over womenfolk.
-5-

8. It is alleged that the incident was witnessed by
Allah Wasaya complainant (PW-7) and Ahmad Bakhsh (PW-
8), Allah Wasaya is the father of the deceased and Ahmad
Bakhsh is their caste fellow.

9. The accused had denied the allegations made by
the prosecution against them and had pleaded not guilty to the
charge. They produced no defence.

10. In support of its case, the prosecution at the trial
relied upon the following pieces of evidence.

1. The ocular account furnished by Allah
Wasaya (PW-7) and Ahmad Bakhsh
(PW-8).

2. The evidence as to motive.

3. The incriminating recoveries,
witnessed by Ahmad Bakhsh PW-
8,and Fazal Raheem PW-9.

4. FSL report Ex. PK & PK/1.

5. The medical evidence.

6. Abscondence of accused.

11. It has been argued by learned counsel for the
appellant that it is an unwitnessed crime; that Ahmad Bakhsh
PW-8 has not been named as an eye witness in the crime
report; that medical evidence does not support the ocular
account; that nothing incriminating articles were recovered
from personal possession of the accused; that the motive as
alleged could not be proved; that abscondence is not sufficient

to prove guilt of the accused. He lastly argued that prosecution
-6-

has failed to prove guilt of the accused beyond a shadow of
doubt, and prayed for their outright acquittal.

12. On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the complainant argued that the ocular account
furnished by PW-7 & PW-8, site plan and medical evidence if
placed in a juxtaposition are consistent. He next contended that
recovery of crime weapon and its matching report with the
empties fully supports the prosecution case. He further
contended that PW-8 is a neutral and independent witness, he
has no motive to falsely depose against the accused. He lastly
contended that prosecution has proved its case against the
accused beyond a ray of doubt, therefore, they deserve normal
penalty of death.

13. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State
added that after commission of offence, the accused remained
absconder for quite sufficient time, which is a sufficient proof
of their guilt.

14. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and
have gone through the record with their eminent assistance.

15. The ocular account was furnished by Allah Wasaya
PW-7 and Ahmad Bakhsh PW-8, the prosecution case hinges
upon the credibility of testimony of these two prosecution
witnesses. Keeping in mind the guiding principles laid down
by the superior Courts for the safe administration of justice in
criminal case

(i) that an accused is presumed to be

innocent till proved guilty;
-7-

(ii) that prosecution is under obligation to
prove guilt of the accused beyond a ray
of doubt.

(iii) that since accused being a favourite
child of law has been given a license of
telling the lies, which has also been
recognized by the Courts, he cannot be
punished for his flaws or falsities and
his failure to prove the plea taken by
him shall not strengthen the
prosecution case or absolve it from the
duty to prove the case on the strength
of its own evidence.

(iv) that if there is any doubt, of course, a
reasonable and genuine doubt and not
an artificial, the accused shall get its
benefit not as a matter of grace or

concession, but as a matter of right.

16. We proceed to evaluate the structure of the
prosecution case and first of all deal with the initial report
recorded in shape of murasila Ex. PA/I, subsequently
incorporated into FIR Ex. PA. The prosecution case is that the
occurrence took place dated 12.10 p.m on a metaled road of
Dus Daripull, and after receiving the injury the deceased fell
down from the bridge in the standing water beneath the bridge.
PW-7 & 8 had seen the appellant causing the death of
Asmatullah. At the trial, it is worth mentioning that the ocular

account of evidence contained certain addition and
-8-

improvements as compared to the narration in the FIR,

therefore, it is necessary to delineate upon it.

17. — Admittedly, the complainant in his report recorded
in shape of murasila Ex.PA/1 has not shown presence of
Ahmad Bakhsh (PW-8) on the scene of crime, except him, and
the deceased at the time of incident, as such the subsequent
introduction of Ahmad Bakhsh (PW-8) in the prosecution’s
case, his examination as eye witness is a deliberate act with
malafide intention and no credential value can be given to his
testimony. Particularly, when it was alleged by complainant
(PW-7) in his initial report recorded by the police that on his
hue and cry people of the village attracted to the scene of crime
who helped him in pulling out the body of his son from
standing water, it does not appeal to a prudent mind that his
name could be escaped by the complainant. Contrary to that,
scanning of the statement of PW-8 reflects that he deposed that
on the eventful day and time, he was proceeding to Paroa from
his house and he has seen the incident with his own eyes and
he helped the complainant in pulling out the body of his son
and then subsequent proceedings including preparation of site

plan were carried out before him.

18. From the above discussion, it can safely be held
that Ahmad Bakhsh (PW-8) was introduced as an eye witness

at a belated stage, after due deliberation and contemplation to
-9-

support the contention of the complainant. It is by now well
settled principle of law that no value can be given to the
evidence of witness, whose name does not appear in the crime
report. Allah Wasaya complainant (PW-7) deposed that I had
stated in my report that my son was shifted from the spot to the
hospital in a Qingqi Rickshaw (confronted omitted). Apart
from these, he introduced Ahmad Bakhsh as an eye witness by
stating in his examination-in-chief that I immediately raised
alarm on which one Ahmad Bakhsh was attracted to the spot
he also helped me in pulling out my son from the semi watered
area underneath the bridge, at that time, Asmatullah was
unconscious. These facts were introduced for the first time in
the deposition made before learned trial Court, which were not

found in his initial report.

19. From the above position, it is clear that the
complainant has improved his statement, from the statement
which he had already made in the crime report and that too, by
introducing new facts and Ahmad Bakhsh (PW-8) as an eye-
witness. Had Ahmad Bakhsh been there, it does not appeal to
reasons that he would have missed his name as witness.
Improvements made by the complainant create serious doubts
about his veracity and credibility. In this respect we are
fortified by the judgments reported as Amir Zaman vs
Mehboob and others (1985 SCMR_ 685), Akhtar Ali’s case

(2008 SCMR 6), Khalid Javed’s case (2003 SCMR_149),
-10-

Muhammad Shafique Ahmad vs The State (PLD 1981 SC
472), Syed Saeed Ahmad Shah and another vs The State

(1993 SCMR_550)& Muhammad Saleem vs Muhammad

Azam (2011 SCMR 474).
20. In this behalf, reliance can also be placed on the

case reported as Sardar Bibi and another vs Munir Ahmad
and others (2017_SCMR_ 334), wherein it was held that
“dishonest and deliberate improvements and omissions made
by the witness in unreliable and not trustworthy.”

21. Another interesting aspect of the case is that
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-6) who is related to the deceased

from maternal side deposed that:

I was at Paroa when I first of all got
information about the death of deceased
Asmat Ullah. The place of occurrence is at a
distance of about 7 KM from Parao. I
immediately proceeded to the spot on Quingqi
and then brought the dead body to civil
hospital Paroa. The dead body was examined
by the medical officer at Parao Hospital at
about 01:30 PM. I had taken the quingqi from
Parao to the spot. When I reached the spot at
first instance there was no police official

available there.

22. He did not utter even a single word about presence
of PW-7 & PW-8 on the scene of crime, his deposition totally

falsifies presence of PW-7 & PW-8 on the scene of crime.
-ll-

23. We noted that PW-7 & PW-8 deposed that after
receiving firearm injuries the deceased fell down from the
bridge in the standing water beneath the bridge. PW-8 stated in
cross-examination that height of the bridge may be 4/5 feet
higher than him, strange enough, falling from such a height, no
injury was found on the body of the deceased, though there
was a little water beneath the bridge but, neither clothes of the
deceased nor injuries were found wet with water or mud by the
police as well as by the doctor. PW-7 stated in his cross-
examination that his cloth was stained with blood of his son
when he picked and brought him to the hospital. He could
have establish his presence on the spot by handing over such
an important piece of evidence but he neither handed over his
cloth to the I.O nor blood was noted by him on his cloth, it
does not appeal to the prudent mind that such an important
piece of evidence could have been ignored by the I.O which
falsifies the presence of these PWs on the spot and suggests
that occurrence has not taken in the manner or mode as
described by the prosecution. Moreso, PW-8, is the resident of
village Bhirki, he deposed that on the day of incident, he was
going to Paroa but he has not stated that the reasons for what

purpose he was going to village Paroa. He is a chance witness.

24, It was alleged by prosecution witnesses PW-7 &
PW-8 that accused Inayat Ullah fired at the deceased from 12
bore shotgun while accused Naimatullah from 30 bore pistol.

However, appraisal of post-mortem report and the deposition
-12-

of Dr. Abdur Rauf Khan, PW-2 does not reflect that injuries
were caused by .12 bore shotgun. No pellet was found in the
body of the deceased. Only a distorted bullet was recovered
from his left thigh which too negates presence of these PWs on

the spot.

25. After having considered the evidence of Allah
Wasaya complainant PW-7 and Ahmad Bakhsh PW-8
carefully, we are of the opinion that no implicit reliance can be

placed upon their testimony.

26. Coming to recovery of crime weapon and its
matching report with the empties recovered from the spot, it
was alleged by the prosecution that accused were arrested by
PW-9.on 20.05.2015, and at the time of arrest, .12 bore
shotgun alongwith license were recovered from the possession
of accused Inayatullah, while .30 bore pistol and its license
were recovered from possession of co-accused Naimatullah.
Both these crime weapons alongwith empties were sent to
FSL, where it was opined that empties of 12 bore were fired
from .12 bore shotgun repeater, however, empties of .30 bore
did not match with .30 bore pistol. As discussed above, no
pellet injury on the body of the deceased was described in the
post-mortem report. Therefore, its matching report would not
help the prosecution, even otherwise, the recovery of crime

empty or weapon with its matching report of FSL is a
-13-

corroborated piece of evidence, which by itself is not sufficient
to convict the accused in the absence of substantive evidence.
In this behalf reference is invited to Ijaz Ahmad’s Case (1997
SCMR_1279), Asad-ullah Muhammad Ali’s (PLD 1971 SC
541), wherein it was held by the August Supreme Court that
corroborative evidence is meant to test the veracity of ocular
evidence. Both corroborative and ocular testimony is to be read
together and not in isolation. In Saif-ullah’s Case (1985
SCMR 410), it was observed that when there is no eye witness
to be relied upon, then there is nothing which can be
corroborated by recovery. In the present case, we have already
disbelieved the ocular testimony as such there is no substantive
piece of evidence which requires to be corroborated through

the recoveries. Thus, the recoveries in the present

circumstances of the case have no weight.

27. As regard to motive, though it was alleged by the
prosecution that incident is result of dispute over womenfolk.
Solitary statement of the complainant without any supporting
evidence is unsafe to be relied upon. Thus the prosecution has
failed to prove the motive. No doubt, prosecution is not bound
to allege a motive, but once a motive is alleged, then
prosecution is bound to prove the same, and failure to prove
the same, then the prosecution must suffer the consequences
and not the defence. In this behalf reliance can be placed on

the case reported as Muhammad Sadiq vs Muhammad
-14-

Sarwar (1979 SCMR 214), wherein it was observed that when
motive is alleged but not proved then the ocular evidence
required to be scrutinized with great caution. In Hakim Ali’s
Case (1971 SCMR_ 432), it was held that the prosecution
though not called upon to establish motive in every case, yet
once it has set up a motive and failed to establish it, the
prosecution must suffer consequence and not defence. In this
behalf reference may also be made to the case reported as
Ameen-ullah vs State (PLD 1976 SCMR 629), wherein it was
observed that where the motive is an important constituent and
is found by the Court to be untrue, the Court, should be on

guard to accept prosecution story.

28. As held above, the ocular account which forms the
cornerstone of the prosecution case is devoid of the ring of
truth, whereas this evidence is eliminated, the structure of the

prosecution case tumbles down completely.

29. Now adverting to abscondence of the accused,
suffice it to say that abscondence cannot be a substitute for real
evidence because people do abscond though falsely charged in
order to save themselves from agony of protracted trial or to be
killed in retaliation. In this behalf reliance can be placed on the

case reported as Muhammad Khan and another vs The State

(1999 SC 1220).
-15-

30. In the result, we would accept the appeal, set aside
the conviction of the appellant and acquit them. They be set at
liberty, if not required in any other case. Since the appeal of
the accused/appellants against their conviction and sentence is
allowed, therefore, criminal Revision Petition No.09-D/2017
fails and dismissed.

31. Above are the reasons of our short order of even

date.
