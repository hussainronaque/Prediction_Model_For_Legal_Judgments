SHAHID KHAN, J.- Impugned herein is the
acquittal of Pervez Khan, respondent
hereinafter, whereof, the complainant, now the
appellant has called in question his acquittal in
case of FIR No. 202 dated 31.08.2018, U/Ss
302/34 PPC, R/W Section 15-KPK Arms Act,
2013 ~P.S, Barawal, District Dir Upper,
recorded by the Court of learned Additional
Sessions Judge 1* /Izafi Zila Qazi/Judge Model

Criminal Trial Court, Dir Upper, through the

-impugned order/judgment dated 02.07.2020.

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
2. It would not be out of place to
clarify here that while hearing initial arguments
qua admitting the subject criminal appeal for
full-hearing or otherwise, the appeal in hand has
been admitted to full hearing by this Court vide
its order dated 28.09.2022 to the extent of
accused/respondent No.1, Khan Pervez,
whereas, it stands dismissed in limine to the
extent of accused/respondent No. 2, Javaid
Khan, therefore, the findings of this Court
would be restricted to the acquittal of

accused/respondent No. 1, Khan Pervez only.

3. Reportedly, the police party under
the command & supervision of SHO, PS,
Barawal rushed to the venue of crime i.e. the
house of accused, Javaid, pursuant to receipt of
information about an offence of murder of
deceased, Irfan Ullah, whose dead body has
been lying in the Baitak of accused, Javaid.
Nobody was present with the dead body,
therefore, it was shifted to Barawal hospital for
further proceedings. At the hospital, the

appellant/complainant, Aleem Ullah, father of

Nawab (D.B)} Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
So

the deceased, Irfan Ullah, reported the subject
event to local police in terms that on the fateful
day his son, Irfan Ullah after offering of Juma
prayers at his native mosque had gone to Bazar
Banda. At Asar Vela, he received information
about lying of the dead body of his son at
Barawal hospital. The appellant/complainant
after due satisfaction charged the accused/
respondents, Javaid & Pervez for committing
the murder of his son through firearms. At the
relevant time no motive was advanced by the
complainant with further information that the
occurrence might have been witnessed by
anyone. The event was reduced into in writing
in the shape ‘Muasila’ (Ex. PW-2/1) followed
by the ibid FIR (Ex. PW-2/6) registered against

the accused/respondents at P.S concerned.

4. Upon arrest of the accused/
respondents followed by completion of the
investigation, challan was drawn and was sent-
up for trial to the learned trial Court.
Accused/respondents were confronted with the

statement of allegations through a formal

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
charge-sheet to which they pleaded not guilty

and claimed trial.

5. To substantiate the guilt of the
accused/respondents, the prosecution furnished
its account consist of the statements of twelve
(12) witnesses. The accused were confronted to
the evidence so furnished through statements of
accused within the meaning of section 342

Cr.P.C.

6. On conclusion of the trial, in view
of the evidence so recorded and the assistance
so rendered by the learned counsel for the
accused/respondents and the learned counsel for
the complainant/learned State counsel, the
learned trial Court arrived at the conclusion
that in view of the evidence so recorded and
assistance so provided, allegations against the
accused/respondents are tainted with the doubts,
as such, by extending the benefit of doubt, the
acquittal of the respondents/accused was

recorded accordingly.

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
7. It obliged the  appeliant/
complainant to approach this Court through the

subject criminal appeal.

8. Learned counsel for the parties
as well as the learned Addl: A.G for the State
have been heard at a length and the record

gone through with their valuable assistance.

9. At first & foremost instance, it
shall be kept in mind that the subject
occurrence of murder of the deceased, Irfan
Ullah, the son of the complainant is an unseen
& un-witnessed event, on all counts, with the
only exception of testimony of Ali Ahmad,
PW-8, who had allegedly lastly seen the
deceased and the accused/respondent, Khan
Pervez in & around the place of occurrence,
therefore, his account/testimony could at the

most be termed as a last-seen evidence.

10. On her own tum, _ the
appellant/complainant appeared in the witness-
box as PW-7. In his examination-in-chief, he
almost reiterated the same facts as advanced by

him in his initial report in the shape of

Nawab (D.B) Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
‘Murasila’ followed by the ibid FIR qua
implication of both the accused for committing
the murder of his deceased son, however, on
one hand, he failed to disclosed the source of
his information or satisfaction in terms that why
the accused were all-out to kill his son,
especially, when admittedly there was no
motive in field and on the other hand both the
assailants have been assigned a general role
without specifying the role of each & every
accused qua committing the murder of his
deceased son. Neither the appellant/
complainant himself is an eyewitness of the
occurrence nor he has put-forward any ocular-
account of the occurrence except mere
mentioning of the general term that’ the
occurrence might have been witnessed by
anyone, therefore, on this score, the identity of
the real culprit amongst the set of accused is
shrouded in mystery. Likewise, the testimony
of Ali Ahmad, PW-8 is of no help to the
prosecution, as his name has neither been
mentioned by the complainant in his initial
report in the shape of ‘Murasila’ followed by

Nawab (D.B) Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar
Hon"ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
the ibid FIR nor the Court statement of the
complainant bearing his name. His testimony
could at the most be considered as last-seen
evidence, however, without any independent
corroboration, the same has no evidentiary
value qua guilt of the accused/respondent, Khan
Pervez. In view of the above, the learned trial
Court has rightly extended the benefit of
doubt to the accused/respondent in the shape

of his acquittal.

11. There is no denial at all that the
subject event is an unseen occurrence in its
kind & nature as during the investigation
direct evidence regarding the commission of
offence could not surface, therefore, the entire
prosecution’s case hinges upon the sole fact
that the dead body of the deceased son of the
complainant has been recovered from the
Baitak of one of the accused, Javaid,
therefore, the burden of proof lying on his
shoulders to prove said aspect of the case. No
doubt, Hon’ble Apex Court has held in its

judgment rendered in case titled “Saeed Ahmad

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
so

ws The State” reported as 2015 SCMR 710 that
with regard to vulnerable members of society,
such as children, women and the infirm, who
were living with the accused or were last seen
in his company, the accused ought to offer
some explanation of what happened to them. If
instead he remains silent or offers a false
explanation he casts a shadow upon himself.
But it has also been noted therein that it did not
mean that the burden of proof had shifted on to
the accused as it is for the prosecution to prove
its case. Ratio of the judgment of Saeed Ahmad
Supra cannot however be applied to the case in
hand for the reason that prosecution have not
been able to discharge its onus. Initial burden of
proof always lies on the prosecution, which
though may get shifted to accused under Article
122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984,
under circumstances justifying such shifting of
burden, but in the case in hand, it is noticeable
that prosecution has not been able, even to
discharge its initial burden of proof. Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of

“Nasrullah alias Nasro v/s The State” reported

Nawab (D.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
as 2017 SCMB 724 had observed, in this
respect;-

“ It has been argued by the learned counsel for

the complainant that in the cases of Arshad
Mehmood v. The State (2005 SCMR 1524) and
Saeed Ahmed y. The State (2015 SCMR 710) this
Court had held that where a wife of a person or any
vulnerable dependent dies an unnatural death in the
house of such person then some part of the onus lies
on him to establish the circumstances in which such
unnatural death had occurred, The learned counsel
for the complainant has maintained that the stand
taken by the appellant regarding suicide having been
committed by the deceased was neither established
by him nor did it fit into the circumstances of the
case, particularly when the medical evidence
contradicted the same. Be that as it may holding by
this Court that some part of the onus lies on the
accused person in such a case does not mean that
the entire burden of proof shifts to the accused
person in a case of this nature. It has already been
clarified by this Court in the case of Abdul Majeed v.
The State (2011 SCMR 941) that the prosecution is
bound to prove its case against an accused person
beyond reasonable doubt at all stages of a criminal
case and in a case where the prosecution asserts
presence of some eye-witnesses and such claim of
the prosecution is not established by it there the
accused person could not be convicted merely on the
basis of a presumption that since the murder of his
wife had taken place in his house, therefore, it must
be he and none else who would have committed that
murder.”

A somewhat similar findings have

also been recorded by Hon’ble Apex Court in its
judgment in the case of “Nazeer Ahmad v/s The
State” reported as 2016 SCMR 1628, which are
reproduced hereunder for ready reference;-

“It may be true that when a vulnerable dependant is
done to death inside the confines of a house,
particularly during a night, there some part of the
onus lies on the close relatives of the deceased to
explain as to how their near one had met an
unnatural death but where the prosecution utterly
fails to prove its own case against an accused person
there the accused person cannot be convicted on the

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
.

-10-

sole basis of his failure to explain the death. These
aspects of the legal issue have been commented upon
by this Court in the cases of Arshad Mehmood v.
The State (2005 SCMR 1524), Abdul Majeed v. The
State (2011 SCMR 941) and Saeed Ahmed v. The
State (2015 SCMR 710).”

Likewise, in the case of

“Muhammad Jamsheed and another v/s The

State_and_ others” reported as 2016 SCMR
1019, Hon’ble Apex Court had observed that
suspicion howsoever grave or strong could
never be a proper substitute for proof, beyond
reasonable doubt, required in a criminal case.

12. The prosecution has not been able
to bring on record any ocular evidence which
could connect the accused/respondent with the
murder of the deceased nor there is any sort of
circumstantial evidence against the accused in
the field except the recovery of weapon of
offence i.e. a 30 bore pistol. The said recovery
of weapon of offence was allegedly made on the
joint pointation of both the accused from the
landed property situated near the place of
occurrence i.e. Baitak of the accused Javaid,
therefore, in view of the joint recovery coupled
with assignment of a general role to both the

accused, the evidentiary value of the aforesaid

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
>

-1l-

recovery is standing in vacuum. Even otherwise,
when substantive evidence fails to connect the
accused person with the commission of
offence or is disbelieved, corroborative
evidence is of no help to the prosecution as the
corroborative evidence cannot by itself prove
the prosecution’s case. Hon’ble Supreme Court

of Pakistan while giving its judgment in case

titled “Muhammad Afzal alias Abdullah and

others _vs. The State and others” reported as

2009 SCMR_639 has also expressed almost a
similar view in para-12 of its judgment, which

is reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

“After taking out from consideration the ocular
evidence, the evidence of identification and the
medical evidence, we are left with the evidence of
recoveries only, which being purely corroboratory
in nature, in our view, alone is not capable to bring
home charge against the appellant in the absence
of any direct evidence because it is well-settled that
unless direct or substantive evidence is available
conviction cannot be recorded on the basis of any
other type of evidence howsoever, convincing it
may be.”

Hon’ble Supreme Court of
Pakistan in its judgment rendered in case titled
“Imran Ashraf _& 7 others v/s The State”
reported as 2001 SCMR 424, has also observed;
“Recovery of incriminating articles is used for

the purpose of providing corroboration to the
ocular testimony. Ocular evidence and

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar
Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-12-

recoveries, therefore, are to be considered
simultaneously in order to reach for a just
conclusion."

In support of same ratio, further

reliance may also be placed on the judgment

reported as 2007 SCMR 1427.

13. As far as the medical evidence is
concerned, needless to highlight that the
medical evidence may confirm the direct or
ocular account, if any, with regard to the set of
injuries, kind of weapon allegedly used in the
commission of offence and at least the nature
of injuries, however, in the subject case when
the occurrence is undoubtedly unseen & un-
witnessed then evidentiary value of
medical evidence qua the guilt of the
accused/respondent as a sole piece of
corroboratory evidence cannot be given much
weight. Reliance in this regard is placed on

the case titled “Abdul Rashid v/s The State”

reported as 2019 P Cr. LJ 1456, whereby it
has been held that;-

“The medical evidence in this case has been
furnished by PW-4 Dr. Nasreen Ahmad Tareen,
Medical Officer, who has confirmed the unnatural
death of deceased. However, the| fact remain that
medical evidence is only used for confirmation of
ocular evidence regarding seat of injury, time of
occurrence and weapon of offence used, etc. but
medical evidence itself does not constitute any

Nawab (D.8) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
Q)

-13-

corroboration qua the identity of accused person to
prove their culpability. Reliance in this regard can

be placed on the case of “Muhammad Sharif &
another v/s The State” (1997 SCMR 866).

14. The prosecution has also not been

able to prove the motive part of the subject
offence in terms that why the accused were so
desperate & all-out to kill the deceased son of
the complainant and it seen|s that real facts
have been suppressed by the complainant for
the reasons best known to him. In case titled
“Khalid Mehmood & another v/s The State”
reported as 2021 SCMR 810 it was held by

the Apex Court that;-

A specific motive was set out by the prosecution
in the FIR inasmuch as hot words were being
exchanged between Khalid Party and Sarwar
Party in front of house of Jayaid. There is no
detail whatsoever why Khalid Party and Sarwar
Party were quarrelling with leach other; why
both the parties at once started firing at the
deceased; why and in which capacity deceased
Muhammad Aslam intervened to pacify both the
parties. The answers to these questions are not
available on record. In these circumstances, the
learned High Court has rightly not believed the
motive set out by the prosecution in Para 12 of
the impugned judgment.

Similarly, in case titled “Pathan
v/s The State” reported 2015 SCMR 315, the
Apex Court about relevancy of motive has

held as under;-

Motive in legal parlance was ordinarily not
considered as a principle of primary evidence in a

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
-14-

murder case, however, in rare cases, motive did
play a very vital and decisive role for committing
murder,

15. In view of the above, when
neither any direct nor any circumstantial
evidence is available on the face of the
record, as such, the case of prosecution is
full doubt all-around; therefore, the
accused/respondent has rightly been
extended the benefit of the doubt through
the impugned order/judgment of acquittal,
which is neither perverse nor arbitrary nor

, whimsical.

Je

16. It is well settled, it is not essential
at all to place reliance on multiple doubts
coupled with multiple grounds to extend the
benefit of doubt to an accused, even a single
worth reliable doubt is sufficient enough to
extend its benefit to an accused person as it is
the cardinal principle of criminal
administration of justice that let hundred
guilty persons be acquitted but one innocent

person should not be convicted. In the case of

“Tariq Pervaiz v/s The State” reported as

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
se

-15-

1995 SCMR 1345 , the Apex Court has held

as under;-

That the concept of benefit of doubt to an accused
person is deep-rooted in our country. For giving
him benefit of doubt, it is not necessary that there
should be many circumstances creating doubts. If
there is a circumstance which creates reasonable
doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of the
accused, then the accused will be entitled to the
benefit not as a matter of grace and concession but
as a matter of right.

Further reliance is placed on the

case law cited as “Daniel boyd (Muslim
name Saifullah) vs the State” reported as
1992 SCMR_196”, where the -following
observations were recorded by the Apex
Court;-

Nobody is to be punished unless proved
guilty on the basis of reliable or true
evidence. Benefit of every reasonable
doubt is to go to the accused.

This view also reflects in the
judgment of the apex Court titled as
“Ghulam Qadir and 2 others vs the State”
reported as 2008 SCMR_ 1221, wherein it

was observed that:-

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
"Benefit of doubt. Principle of
applicability. For the purpose of benefit of
doubt to an accused, more than one
infirmity is not required. Single infirmity
creates reasonable doubt in the mind of a
reasonable and prudent person regarding
the truth of charge, makes the whole case
doubtful. "

In support of the same rational,
further reliance is placed on the judgment of
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan cited

as “Muhammad Zaman vs. the State”

(2014 _SCMR_ 749), wherein it was held

that;-

Even a single doubt if found reasonable,
was enough to warrant acquittal of the
accused,

17. For the afore-stated reasons, the

subject criminal appeal being bereft of any

merits is hereby dismissed.
