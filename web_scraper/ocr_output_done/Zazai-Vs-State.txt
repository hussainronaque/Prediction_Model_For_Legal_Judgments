JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.-

Petitioner Zazai, seeks bail in case FIR No.657

dated 04.08.2015, registered under sections

419/420 PPC and S.14 Foreigners Act, 1946, in

police Station University Town.

2. Allegations against the petitioner are

that when he was inquired about his stay in

Pakistan by the local police, he produced them

Afghan Refugee card, which was allegedly fake

and bogus.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. During the course of arguments learned

counsel for the petitioner produced Afghan

Citizen/Afghan Refugees Card of brother of

petitioner, namely, Azmat Khan and contended

that the entire family members of the petitioner

are refugees, who have been issued Refugees

Cards by the Government of Pakistan qua their

legal stay in Pakistan. Record reveals that the

Card of the petitioner has not been verified from

NADRA nor an iota of evidence has been

brought to show his stay illegal in Pakistan. In

absence of any report from NADRA qua

fakeness of card of the petitioner, his case

requires further probe to the extent of 8.14

Foreigners Act. So far as sections 419 and 420

PPC are concerned, one is bailable while

punishment of the other does not fall within the

Restrictive Clause of S.497 Cr.P.C. hence,

petitioner is entitled to concession of bail.

5. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.

Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided

he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of

Rs.3,00,000/- with two sureties each in the like

amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa

Judicial Magistrate-"MOD concerned. The

sureties must be local, reliable and men of

means.
