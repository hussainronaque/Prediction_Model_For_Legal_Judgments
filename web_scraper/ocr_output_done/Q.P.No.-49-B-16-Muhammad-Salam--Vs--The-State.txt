2. In these petitions following questions of law are
involved, therefore, the same are being decided through this
consolidated judgment.

> Whether the vehicles in question

are Non Custom Paid and these

were brought to the settled area in

violation of the Customs Act,

1969?

> Whether in presence of Customs

Act, 1969 as well as judgment of

the apex Court in Criminal

Petitions No.802 of 2015 and 22

of 2017, the Non Custom Paid

vehicles can be released on

Superdari?
3. The brief facts of the case are that the petitioners
are the permanent residents of North Waziristan Agency and
are now residing in Bannu as Temporary Dislocated Persons
(TDPs). That the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Home
& Tribal Affairs Department, vide circular No.SO(AR)/HD/1-
8/NCP/2014/KC_ dated 03" October, 2014, approved a
mechanism/policy for Non Custom Paid (NCP) vehicles of
TDPs of North Waziristan Agency in wake of Military
operation “Zarb-e-Azb” and circulated the same in different
Provincial Government Departments. That in pursuance of the

circular, referred to above, some vehicles were provisionally

registered and allowed to be plied in Districts Bannu,

Imran/* (D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor and Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, JJ
-3-

D.I.Khan and Lakki Marwat, while other were not registered.
The Police Officers/Officials intercepted some of the vehicles
while plying in District Bannu, and it transpired that no duty
and taxes leviable on such imported vehicles were paid, which
culminated in registration of FIRs. The vehicles were
apprehended by the local police and cases were accordingly
registered.

4. The petitioners filed petitions before the learned
Illaqa Magistrates concerned for release of the vehicles in
question on Superdari, which were turned down. Not
contended with the same, the petitioners filed criminal
revisions before the learned Additional Sessions Judges,
concerned and the learned revisional Court through separate
orders, maintained the orders passed by the Illaqa Judicial
Magistrates on the ground that the petitioners have failed to
prove their ownership in support of their contentions,
therefore, they filed the quashment petitions under Section
561-A Cr.PC, for release of the vehicles in question claiming
to be its lawful owners and its importation under the circular,
referred to above.

5. It is, inter alia, agued by the learned counsel for the
petitioners that the petitioners are Temporary Dislocated
Persons (TDPs) and in order to facilitate the TDPS, the
Provincial Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Home &

Tribal Affairs Department vide circular No.SO (AR)/HD/1-

Imran/* (D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor and Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, JJ
-4-

8/NCP/2014/KC. dated 03" October, 2014, approved the
mechanism/policy for Non Custom Paid (NCP) vehicles of
TDPs of North Waziristan Agency, therefore, interception and
apprehension of such vehciles by the Officials of Police is
illegal, without lawful authority and without jurisdiction and
they are entitled for its custody.

6. As against that, the learned Addl: A.G representing
the State strenuously opposed the contention of the learned
counsel for the petitioners and argued that under Section 19 of
the Customs Act, 1969, only the Federal Government is
competent to grant exemption from payment of custom duties
chargeable thereon and the circular issued by the Provincial
Government offends Section 19 of the Act ibid, therefore,
seizure of the vehicles in question and registration of FIRs by
the Government functionaries are legal; that neither the
vehicles have lawfully been imported into settled area nor the
taxes and duties leviable thereon have been paid; that the
learned Illaqa Judicial Magistrate, Additional Sessions Judge

and High Court have got no power to release such vehicles on

Superdari.
7. Arguments heard and record perused.
8. Perusal of the record reflects that the vehicles in

question are of foreign origin and were seized by the Officials

of Police being Non Custom Paid. The petitioners have failed

Imran/* (D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor and Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, JJ
-5-

to produce any documentary evidence showing their
ownership and lawful import in the settled areas.

9. The question emerging for consideration of this
Court, as formulated above, is whether the vehicles seized
have been lawfully imported and the persons importing them
have paid the duties and taxes leviable thereon and whether
the circular under which some vehicles were provisionally
registered offends Section 19 of the Customs Act, 1969 or not,
the answer to the question is obviously in affirmative. It will
be advantageous to reproduce Section 19 of the Act ibid,
which reads as under:-

“19. General power to exempt from
customs duties..---[()] The [Federal
Government], subject to such
conditions, limitations or restrictions, if
any, as it thinks fit to impose, may, by
Notification in the official Gazette,
exempt any goods imported into, or
exported from, Pakistan or into or from
any specified port or station or area
therein, from the whole or any part of
the customs-duties chargeable thereon
[and may remit fine, penalty, charge or
any other amount recoverable under
this Act.]

[2] A Notification issued
under sub-section (1) shall be effective
from the day specified therein,

notwithstanding the fact that the issue

Imran/* (D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor and Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, JJ
-6-

of the official Gazette in which such
Notification appears is published at any
time after that day.]

[3] Notwithstanding anything
contained in any other law for the time
being in force, including but not limited
to the Protection of Economic Reforms
Act, 1992 (XII of 1992), and
notwithstanding any decision or
judgment of any forum, authority or
Court, no person shall, in the absence
of a_ notification by the Federal
Government published in the official
gazette expressly — granting and
affirming exemption from or refund of
customs duty on the basis of the
doctrine of promissory estoppel or on
account of any correspondence or
admission or promise or commitment
or concessionary order made or
understanding given whether in writing
or otherwise, by any government

department or authority.]
10. A bare reading of this section reveals that the
notification regarding exemption of any goods imported into
Pakistan can only be issued by the Federal Government. There
are certain other provisions of Customs Act, 1969, which
empower the Central Board of Revenue also to issue certain
notifications in matters pertaining to the delegated legislation,
and the exemptions and the scope and extent thereof under

Imran/* (D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor and Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, JJ
-7-

Section-19 of the Customs Act, 1969 are exclusively within
the competence of Federal Government.

11. Admittedly, the vehicles in questions were neither
brought into settled area in accordance with the provisions
contained in the Customs Act, 1969, nor the custom duty nor
any duties and taxes leviable thereon were paid by its
importers, hence, neither the High Court nor Sessions Judges
nor Judicial Magistrates have the power to release such
vehicles on superdari. These vehicles are subject to
departmental adjudication as envisaged under the Customs
Act, 1969.

13. I am also fortified by the judgment of the
Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in Criminal Petitions
No.802 of 2015 and 22 of 2016, where identical questions
were answered by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan, and
held that the seizure of vehicles not lawfully imported, and
failure of payment of the duties and taxes leviable thereon by
the persons importing them, is legal.

14. For what has been discussed above, we find no
substance in the petitions in hand, therefore, the same are
hereby dismissed alongwith connected Contempt of Court
Petitions.

Announced.
