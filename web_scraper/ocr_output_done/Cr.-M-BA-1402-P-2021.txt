QAISER RASHID KHAN, CJ:- Accused-petitioner

seeks his release on bail in case FIR No.198, dated
15.07.2016, under Sections 302/34 PPC of Police Station
Jarma, District Kohat, with the allegations that he along with
his co-accused had fired at Lal Muhammad, brother of the
complainant with which he was hit and died on the spot.

2. All that the learned counsel for the accused-
petitioner contends is that the latter has been falsely roped in
the instant case as no motive has been advanced against him in
the FIR; that the medical evidence does not support the

prosecution version; that the site plan rules out the presence of

Altaf Hussain, CS. (SB) Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
the accused-petitioner on the spot; that the co-accused
Zahirullah with a similar role of firing has been acquitted by
the learned trial court and such circumstances, take his case to
one of further inquiry entitling him to the concession of bail.

3. The complainant present in court expressed his
inability to engage a counsel. As such, the learned AAG
advanced his arguments resisting the bail petition. He
contended that the accused-petitioner along with his co-
accused have been directly nominated by the complainant for
the commission of the offence and as such, he is not entitled to

the concession of bail.

4. Arguments heard and the available record
perused.
5. As per the FIR ibid, it was the complainant

Naimat Khan, who accompanied by the dead body of his
brother namely Lal Muhammad reported at the police station
about the incident as to how while he along with his deceased
brother and uncle Muslim Khan were proceeding from their
house to Bazar with his brother Lal Muhammad ahead of them,

when they came across the accused-petitioner along with his

Altaf Hussain, CS. (SB) Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
co-accused namely Umar Nawaz and Zahirullah duly armed
with their respective firearms, who suddenly started firing at
Lal Muhammad with their respective firearms with which he
was hit and died on the spot.

6. From the spot 30 empties of 7.62 bore were
retrieved which as per the FSL report have been fired from
different weapons. Given the fact that the accused-petitioner
along with his co-accused have been directly nominated by the
complainant for firing at his deceased brother with their
respective firearms with which he sustained multiple firearm
injuries and died on the spot, coupled with the FSL report
pointing towards the involvement of more than one accused in
the commission of the offence, then in such event, the accused-
petitioner is prima facie connected with the commission of the
offence attracting the prohibitory limb of section 497 Cr.P.C.

7. The argument of the learned counsel for the
accused-petitioner that the co-accused Zahirulah with a similar
role of firing at the deceased has been acquitted by the learned
trial court carries little weight. While co-accused Zahirulah

faced trial, the accused-petitioner preferred to abscond and

Altaf Hussain, CS. (SB) Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
surrendered barely a month after the acquittal of his co-
accused. Moreover, the other co-accused Umar Nawaz is still
fugitive from law.

8, Thus taking a tentative assessment of the material
available on record, the accused-petitioner is prima facie
connected with the commission of the offence attracting the
prohibitory limb of section 497 Cr.P.C. Hence, I hold him

disentitled to the concession of bail.

9. Resultantly, this bail petition stands dismissed.
