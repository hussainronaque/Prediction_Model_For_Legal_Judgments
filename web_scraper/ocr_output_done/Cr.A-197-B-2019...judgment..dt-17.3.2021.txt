SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- This judgment shall
dispose of Cr.A.No.197-B of 2019 titled “Ghulam Jan
Vs. The State & another’ and the connected criminal
revision bearing No.49-B/2019 titled ‘Mujeeb ur
Rehman Vs. Ghulam Jan’ as both are the outcome of one
and the same judgment dated 26.6.2019, rendered by
learned Additional Sessions Judge-II, Lakki Marwat,
whereby the appellant has been convicted under
section 302(b) P.P.C and sentenced to life imprisonment
with Rs.2,00,000/- (two lac) as compensation under
section 544-A Cr.P.C. to the legal heirs of deceased or in
default thereof, to undergo six months simple

imprisonment. He was further convicted under section
-2-
324 P.P.C and sentenced to five years imprisonment. All
the sentences were ordered to run concurrently. Benefit
of section 382-B Cr.P.C was extended to the convict.

2. The prosecution story as disclosed in the
F.LR (Ex. PW 4/1), registered on the basis of murasila
(Ex. PW 2/1), in brief, is that on 27.10.2015 at 19:45
hours, complainant Mujib-ur-Rehman (PW-8), while
present with dead-body of his cousin, Shams ud Din,
made report on the spot to Sami Ullah Khan ASI (PW-2),
to the effect that a few days ago, wife of the accused,
namely, Mst. Nasim Bibi, was sitting deserted in the
house of her parents situated in Kotka Alam Khel, due to
strained relations with her husband; that on the eventful
day, he alongwith his cousin Shams-ud-Din were on their
way to the house of Muhammad Jan to settle the dispute
between the spouses, when they reached near the house
of Faqir Khalifa Amma Khel at about 17:00 hours,
accused Ghulam Jan, duly armed with pistol was already
present there, who on seeing them, raised Lalkara and
started firing upon them with the intention to commit
their gatl-i-amd, resultantly, his cousin Shams-ud-Din
got hit and fell to the ground, while he fortunately
escaped unhurt; that he could do nothing being empty-

handed and ran towards nearby fields to save his life.
-3-
After the occurrence, the accused decamped from the
spot; that when he attended the deceased, by then he had
already expired. Motive for the occurrence was stated to
be a dispute over women folk. On the report of
complainant, PW-2 drafted Murasila (Ex: PW-2/1),
prepared injury sheet and inquest report of the deceased
and sent the dead-body to the doctor for postmortem
examination, under the escort of Constable Qadir Khan
No.502 (PW-3), while Murasila was transmitted to the
police station, where Muhammad Ayaz Khan Incharge,
DSB, Lakki (PW-4) incorporated its contents into the
F.LR (Ex. PW-4/1).

3. Initially, accused absconded, _ therefore,
proceedings under section 512, Cr.P.C. were conducted
against him. On arrest of the accused and after
completion of investigation, complete challan was
submitted against him to the trial Court, where on the
commencement of trial, the prosecution produced and
examined as many as nine witnesses, whereafter, accused
was examined under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he
denied the allegations and professed innocence, however,
neither he opted to be examined on oath in terms of
Section 340(2), Cr.P.C., nor produced evidence in his

defence. The learned trial Court after hearing arguments
-4-
of learned counsel for the parties vide judgment
impugned herein, convicted the accused and sentenced
him, as mentioned in the earlier part of the judgment.
The convict/appellant has assailed his conviction and
sentence through the instant criminal appeal, while the
complainant has moved connected criminal revision
bearing No.49-B of 2019, for enhancement of sentence,
which we intend to decide the two through this common
judgment.

4. We have heard learned counsel representing
the appellant, Additional Advocate-General assisted by
learned private counsel at length and with their valuable
assistance, the record was gone through.

5. The unfortunate incident occurred on
27.10.2015, when the deceased was done to death. The
complainant reported the matter to the local police, who
on receiving information reached to the spot. The
appellant was charged as the sole accused, the motive
was stated to be a dispute over women folk.

6. True, that in the episode, single accused is
charged and that in the like cases substitution is a rare
phenomenon, that too when the parties are closely related
to each other. In case in hand, the deceased is no one else

but a brother-in-law of the accused, with sister of the
-5-
accused married to him. The incident is the offshoot of
strained relations between the husband and wife. The
learned trial Court dealt with the matter comprehensively
and fully dilated upon material aspects of the case. We
are conscious of the fact that it was the direct charge
against a single accused that prevailed with the trial
Court, as the sole determining factor. The trial Court was
highly swayed and travelled under the impulse that in
case of single accused, substitution is rare a
phenomenon, but it ignored that the proposition which
perturbed, is not a rule of thumb, but is subject to
interpretation when the situation arises. We are
conscious of the fact that the wisdom behind is nothing
more but a caution to the Courts of law for exercising
great care and caution while dealing with the cases of a
singularly charged accused. The burden never shifts to
the accused to prove his innocence rather it is still the
prosecution to discharge its liabilities. While sitting in
appeal, this is the responsibility of this Court to assess
and re-assess the already assessed evidence to confirm
that the conclusion drawn was perfect and reasonable.
This Court is to see as to whether the incident occurred

in the mode, manner and at the stated time and as to
-6-

whether the complainant was present with the deceased
when he received the fatal shot.

7. The incident allegedly occurred on the metal
road when the deceased and complainant were a little
short of their destination. The report tells that when they
reached to the place of incident, the accused was present
duly armed with a pistol, who fired at the deceased and
the deceased after receiving firearm injury fell to the
ground. The report further tells that the complainant ran
away from the spot towards the fields to save his life and
on return found the deceased dead.

8. The complainant being the sole eyewitness
was examined as PW-8, who explained the way the
incident occurred and the police arrived. This is admitted
on record that the incident occurred at 17:00 hours,
whereas the matter was reported at 19:45 hours, that too
on arrival of the local police to the place of incident. It
took nearly three hours that the police arrived to the spot
that too on receiving information. We are yet to know
that why the complainant did not inform the police
despite the fact that he was in possession of his personal
mobile phone. The site plan shows that incident occurred
on the metal road with the traffic plying thereon, but the

complainant was least interested to shift the dead body
-7-

either to police station or to Civil Hospital, Naurang. The
complainant when appeared before the trial Court, stated
that he left his village in the company of the deceased
and reached to the spot at 17:00 hours. He further stated
that the deceased at the time of incident was walking a
head by ten (10) feet, when they were fired at. The stance
taken by the complainant is belied by the site plan which
was prepared on his pointation. It was the complainant
who pointed the inter se distance as thirty (30) feet, we
are anxious to know that when both, the complainant and
deceased were on foot towards the village to settle the
dispute, why they kept on walking with such an
abnormal distance in between. The complainant stated
that the accused fired at both of them, but he escaped
unhurt as he ran from the place of incident towards the
fields. He further stated that while running the accused
did not fire at him. The complainant failed to explain that
why he was fired at, as he was not connected with the
alleged motive. There is no denial to the fact that the
incident occurred at the deserted place with nobody
around, both the complainant and deceased were at the
mercy of the accused, had he the intention to kill the
complainant, no hurdle was in between. The complainant

stated that while running from the spot, he was not fired
-8-
at. His this explanation contradicts his own stance. What
abnormality this was, that the dead-body was lying on
the road with the complainant sitting around waiting for
arrival of the local police. What a coincidence this was
that the invited witnesses and local police reached to the
spot at one and the same time, after three hours of the
incident.

In case titled “Muhammad_Ashraf_alias
Acchu_ Vs the State” (2019 SCMR 652), wherein it is

held that:

“It is well settled that benefit of
slightest doubt must go to an accused
and in a case where the Court reaches
a conclusion that eye-witnesses were
chance witnesses; they had not
witnessed the occurrence and the
prosecution story is concocted by the
PWs, then the case of the accused

merits plain acquittal.”
9. The site plan shows the house of one Faqir
Khalifa Amma Khel near the place of incident and also
the village abadi at a little distance, but the complainant
did not move an inch to ask their help and even no one
attracted to the spot till arrival of the local police. The
matter was reported to one Sami Ullah Khan ASI, who

was examined as PW-2. He stated that while on Gasth,
-9-

he received information from Moharrir of the police
station, with further direction to visit the spot; and that
on arrival to the spot, only the complainant was present,
whereas the dead-body was lying on the ground. He went
on to say that apart from murasila, he prepared the injury
sheet and inquest report. He also admitted that no empty
was lying on the spot. It is pertinent to mention that this
PW admitted the presence of the complainant with the
deceased, but maintained silence in respect of the other
witnesses. If we admit that the inquest report was
prepared on the spot, then wherefrom Naik Muhammad
reached, as the complainant stated that on his
information, Noor Muhammad and Bin Yamin arrived to
the spot. This interesting to note that the scribe while
preparing the inquest report, mentioned the word “Fire
Arm” in the relevant column, whereas the complainant
while reporting the matter specified the weapon used as
pistol, again in the relevant column, the time of death is
mentioned as 8:55 hours, and the complainant also
admitted the time of death as 8:55 hours. If the
complainant had reported the matter on the spot, then the
scribe would have used the word pistol instead of firearm
and the time of death as 17:00 hours, instead of 8:55

P.M; this anomaly on part of the police official, to whom
-10-

the matter was reported leads us to hold that the matter
was not reported on the spot and at the stated time. This
does not appeal to a prudent mind that the dead body
remained on ground for long three hours despite the fact
that the village abadi was situated nearby. PW Sami
Ullah stated that nothing on search was recovered from
the deceased, but surprisingly the doctor at the time of
postmortem examination took into possession Rs.4100/-,
a watch, mobile Nokia and Tasbeeh from the deceased,
which were handed over to the complainant and in that
respect a memo was prepared duly signed by the
complainant. The conflict between the two in respect of
recoveries from deceased tells nothing, but that the dead
body was lying un-attended on the spot and someone
from the village informed the local police, who collected
the dead body from the spot and shifted to the hospital.
We lurk no doubt in our mind that initially, the injury
sheet and inquest report were prepared and it was on
arrival of the complainant that the murasila was drafted.
We cannot resist to hold that the police conducted
preliminary investigation and when attendance of the
complainant was procured the matter was reported.

In case titled “Nazir Ahmad Vs The State

i664

and others” (2019 SCMR 594), it is held that:
-ll-

“The FIR in respect of the incident in
issue had not been lodged at the Police
Station giving rise to an inference that
the same had been lodged and registered
after deliberations and preliminary

investigation”.
10. The doctor conducted autopsy on dead-body
of the deceased who was examined as PW-7, who stated
that he did not write the names of the identifiers in the
relevant column and that the identifiers were summoned
by his staff. He further stated that overwriting was made
by him in the time of arrival and the time of examination.
He surprised us to say that he could not rebut or affirm
the suggestion that the dead body was examined at 00:55
hours i.e. midnight. Uncertainty prevailed throughout his
statement, his conduct is not above board, his reckless
tampering in the relevant columns confirms that neither
the complainant nor the witnesses were present at the
time of report and the postmortem examination. His
uncertain reply in respect of 00:55 hours confirms the
time of occurrence as 8:55 hours, as it was he who
mentioned the time between the death and postmortem as
4 to 5 hours. The record tells that 08:55 hours is the time
mentioned by the police official in the relevant column
of the inquest report and by the complainant in his Court

statement. The cumulative effect of what is stated above
-12-

leads us to hold that neither the incident occurred at the
stated time nor the complainant was present when the
deceased was done to death.

11. The Investigating Officer visited the spot,
recovered blood through cotton from the place of the
deceased, but no empty was recovered. This is
astonishing that when 3/4 shots were fired, why no
empty was found by both the police officials despite, the
fact that the complainant remained present on the spot till
the report was made. We are yet to know, as to whether
the site plan was prepared on the night of incident or on
the following day. It was suggested to the Investigating
Officer that he visited the spot in the morning on the
following day, to which he denied. The complainant
stated that it was on his pointation on the night of
incident that the site plan was prepared. It was intriguing
on part of the Investigating officer that he again visited
the spot at 7:00 a.m in the moming, but he failed to
convince the purpose of his visit when he had already
completed the proceedings on the night of incident.
When assessed from all angles, we are confirmed in our
belief that the site plan was not prepared on the night of
incident, but early in the morning. When the complainant

denied his second visit, it can safely be held that the site
-13-

plan was not prepared on pointation of the complainant,
which in turn excludes his presence on the spot.

12. Motive was stated to be a dispute over women
folk with further explanation that due to strained
relations, the wife of the deceased had left his house and
was residing at her parents’ home and that on the day of
incident the deceased went for reconciliation when the
incident occurred. The Investigating Officer did not
record statement of the wife of the deceased to confirm
the motive and even no independent witness was
produced in that respect. The prosecution failed to prove
the same. True that absence or weakness of motive does
not play a decisive role in the acquittal of an accused, but
equally true, that once a motive is alleged the
prosecution is bound to prove the same, failing which
none else but the prosecution is to suffer. In case titled
"Muhammad Ashraf alias Acchu Vs. The State” (2019
SCMR 652), it was held that:-

"7, The motive is always a double-edged
weapon. The complainant Sultan
Ahmad (PW9) has admitted murder
enmity between the parties and has also
given details of the same in his
statement recorded before the trial
court. No doubt, previous enmity can be
a reason for the appellant to commit the
alleged crime, but it can equally be a
reason for the complainant side to
falsely implicate the appellant in this
case for previous grouse."

-14-

13. It was agitated time and again that the
accused / appellant soon after the occurrence disappeared
and surfaced after a long time, which absence he failed to
explain and this factor alone is sufficient to term the

accused guilty. We are unable to understand that how in

absence of positive and convincing evidence
abscondence alone can lead to conviction, if we accede
to the submissions so forwarded, we are afraid the results
would be drastic. There is no cavil to the proposition that
abscondence alone cannot be a substitute for the direct
evidence and this aspect has been beautifully dealt with

by the apex Court in case “Muhammad Sadiq Vs. State

(2017 SCMR 144), it is held that:

“The fact that the appellant absconded

and was not traceable for considerably

long period of time could also not be

made sole basis for his conviction when

the other evidence of the prosecution is

doubtful as it is riddled with

contradictions.”
14. After evaluating the evidence available on file,
this court reaches to an inescapable conclusion, that the
prosecution could not succeed in bringing home guilt
against the accused/ appellant through confidence inspiring
witnesses and that the complainant failed to establish his

presence on the spot at the time of incident. The learned trial

Court failed to appreciate the evidence available on file and
-15-

did not apply its judicial mind to the facts and circumstances
of the case. The impugned judgment is devoid of reasons,
which calls for interference, resultantly, the appeal in hand
is allowed and the appellant is acquitted of the charges. He
be released forthwith, if not required to be detained in
connection with any other criminal case. As the appeal filed
by the appellant has succeeded, so the connected criminal
revision bearing No. 49-B/2019, has become redundant is,

dismissed as such.

Above are the detailed reasons of our short

order of the even date.
