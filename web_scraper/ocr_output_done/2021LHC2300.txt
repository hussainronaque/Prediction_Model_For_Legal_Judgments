Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan, J:- This judgment shall
dispose of Criminal Appeal No.820 of 2016, filed by Azhar
(appellant), against his conviction and sentence, as well as, Criminal
Revision No.554 of 2016, filed by the complainant Dost Muhammad
for enhancement of sentence awarded to Azhar (appellant) from
imprisonment for life to death and compensation amount, as both these
matters have arisen out of the same impugned judgment dated

15.03.2016, passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Chiniot.

2. Azhar (appellant) along with Ahmad Sher and Hassan (co-
accused since acquitted), was tried in case F.I.R. No.971/2008 dated
02.12.2008, registered at police station Saddar Chiniot, in respect of
offences under sections 302/324/148/149 PPC. After conclusion of the
Cri. Appeal No.820 of 2016 &
Cri. Revision No.554 of 2016

trial, the learned trial Court vide its judgment dated 15.03.2016, has
convicted and sentenced Azhar (appellant) as under: -

Under section 302(b) PPC to imprisonment for life as

tazir. He was also ordered to pay Rs.2,00,000/- (rupees

two hundred thousand only) to the legal heirs of Ahmad

Ali (deceased) as compensation under section 544-A of

Cr.P.C and in default thereof to suffer simple
imprisonment for six months.

Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C was also extended to the
appellant.

However, vide the same impugned judgment dated 15.03.2016,
Ahmad Sher and Hassan (co-accused), were acquitted by the learned
trial Court/Additional Sessions Judge, Chiniot while giving them the
benefit of doubt.

3. Brief facts of the case as given by the complainant Dost
Muhammad (PW-1), in his Fard Bayan (Ex.PA), on the basis of which
the formal FIR (Ex.PA/1) was chalked out, are that the complainant
was resident of Chak No.125 and was cultivator by profession. About
one (01) year ago, Imran and Usman sons of Faiz-ul-Hassan (co-
accused since died), committed murder of nephew of the complainant
namely Younas and the case regarding the abovementioned occurrence
was fixed for hearing on 02.12.2008, in the Court of Sabir Sultan,
Additional Sessions Judge, Chiniot. The complainant party came out of
Katchary after Court proceedings in the abovementioned case. In the
meanwhile, Faiz-ul-Hassan (co-accused since died), Ahmad Sher (co-
accused since acquitted) gave threat to the complainant and his brother
namely Ahmad Ali (deceased), that the complainant party will face
dire consequences, if they (complainant party) will pursue the above-
said case. The complainant party went to the chamber of their lawyer
and informed about the next date of hearing of the case. Dost
Muhammad complainant (PW-1) along with Hafeez Ullah (PW since
given-up) and Muhammad Yousaf (PW-3), thereafter, boarded one
Cri. Appeal No.820 of 2016 &
Cri. Revision No.554 of 2016

motorcycle, whereas Ahmad Ali deceased and Rabnawaz (PW-2),
boarded other motorcycle and they departed for their homes. Ahmad
Ali deceased and Rabnawaz (PW-2), were ahead at a distance of 25/30
yards from the remaining prosecution witnesses. The complainant
party when crossed New Abadi Kot Khudayar, at about 3.30 p.m Faiz-
ul-Hassan (co-accused since died) while armed with gun 12 bore,
Ahmed Sher (co-accused since acquitted) while armed with gun 12
bore, Hassan (co-accused since acquitted) while armed with gun 12
bore, Azhar (appellant) while armed with gun 12 bore and Saif Ullah
(co-accused since tried separately) while armed with repeater gun,
emerged there. The accused party at gun point forcibly stopped Ahmad
Ali (deceased) and he along with Rab Nawaz (PW-2), were alighted
from the motorcycle. Saif Ullah (co-accused since tried separately),
then made a fire shot, which landed on the right knee of Ahmad Ali
(deceased). Ahmad Sher (co-accused since acquitted), thereafter made
a fire shot, which landed on the right calf of Ahmad Ali (deceased).
Azhar (appellant), made a fire shot, which landed on the right foot of
Ahmad Ai (deceased). Faiz-ul-Hassan (co-accused since died), made a
fire shot, which landed on the right leg of Rab Nawaz (PW-2). Hassan
(co-accused since acquitted), made a fire shot, which landed on the left
leg of Rab Nawaz (PW-2). Saif Ullah (co-accused since tired
separately), made second fire shot, which landed on the right leg of
Rab Nawaz (PW-2). Ahmad Ali (deceased) and Rab Nawaz (PW-2),
fell on the ground after receiving the injuries. The accused persons
while raising Jalkaras and after boarding their motorcycles decamped
from the spot. The accused also took away with them the motorcycle
of Ahmad Ali (deceased). Ahmad Ali succumbed to the injuries at the
spot, whereas Rab Nawaz (PW-2), was shifted to the DHQ Hospital,
Chiniot in injured condition. Dost Muhammad complainant (PW-1),
thereafter made his ‘Fard Bayan’ (Ex.PA), before the police, on the
basis of which the formal FIR (Ex.PA/1), was registered.

Cri. Revision No.554 of 2016

4. The appellant was arrested in this case by the police and after
completion of investigation the challan was prepared and submitted
before the learned trial court. The learned trial Court, after observing
legal formalities, as provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1898 framed charge against the appellant and his co-accused on
03.02.2015, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order
to prove its case the prosecution produced thirteen witnesses, whereas
Muhammad Afzal Inspector (CW-1) appeared before the Court as
Court witness. Prosecution also produced documentary evidence in the
shape of Ex.PA to Ex.PAC. The statement of the appellant under
section 342 Cr.P.C, was recorded, wherein he refuted the allegations
levelled against him and professed his innocence. In defence the
appellant produced documentary evidence in the shape of Ex.DA to

Ex.DF.

5. The learned trial Court vide its impugned judgment dated
15.03.2016, found the appellant guilty, convicted and sentenced him as

mentioned and detailed above.

6. It is contended by learned counsel for the appellant that the
appellant is absolutely innocent and he has falsely been implicated in
this case by the complainant being in league with the local police; that
evidence of two prosecution eye-witnesses namely Dost Muhammad
(PW-1) and Muhammad Yousaf (PW-3) has been disbelieved by the
learned trial Court and the appellant has been convicted and sentenced
on account of evidence of Rab Nawaz injured (PW-2) but even the
evidence of Rab Nawaz (PW-2) is not worthy of reliance; that mere
injuries on the body of Rab Nawaz (PW-2) do not mean that he was
stating the whole truth; that evidence of Rab Nawaz (PW-2) has also
been disbelieved by the learned trial Court to the extent of Ahmed Sher

and Hassan co-accused who have been acquitted by the learned trial
Cri. Appeal No.820 of 2016 &
Cri. Revision No.554 of 2016

Court and appeal filed against their acquittal has already been
dismissed by this Court due to non-prosecution vide order dated
20.04.2020, therefore, the prosecution evidence which has been
disbelieved against the above mentioned co-accused cannot be
believed against the appellant without independent corroboration
which is very much lacking in this case; that recovery of gun 12-bore
from the possession of appellant is inconsequential because there is no
report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore in this case; that
even no specific motive was alleged against the appellant and the same
was jointly alleged against the appellant and the acquitted co-accused;
that even otherwise the prosecution could not prove any motive against
the appellant; that there are material contradictions in the prosecution
evidence which have not been properly appreciated by the learned trial
Court while passing the impugned judgment; that the prosecution
miserably failed to prove its case against the appellant beyond the
shadow of doubt, therefore, this appeal may be accepted and the
appellant may be acquitted from the charges.

7. On the other hand, it is argued by the learned Additional
Prosecutor General for the State assisted by learned counsel for the
complainant that the prosecution has proved its case against the
appellant beyond the shadow of any doubt, therefore, he was rightly
convicted and sentenced by the learned trial Court; that co-accused of
the appellant namely Ahmed Sher and Hassan have been acquitted in
this case by the learned trial Court but their case is distinguishable
from the case of the appellant because the said accused were found
innocent during the police investigation whereas the appellant was
found guilty; that moreover, no weapon was recovered from the
possession of above mentioned co-accused whereas a gun 12-bore
(P-2) has been recovered from the possession of the appellant, which
also corroborates the prosecution case against the appellant; that the

appellant remained an absconder in this case for a considerable period
Cri. Appeal No.820 of 2016 &
Cri. Revision No.554 of 2016

which further corroborates the prosecution case against the appellant;
that the appellant was assigned a specific role of making a fire shot
which landed on the right foot of Ahmad Ali (deceased) and the said
role is fully supported by the medical evidence because injury No.1 in
the postmortem report was on the right foot of Ahmad Ali (deceased);
that the prosecution eye-witnesses stood the test of lengthy cross-
examination but their evidence could not be shaken to the extent of
role attributed to the appellant; that there is no substance in this appeal,

therefore, the same may be dismissed.

Learned counsel for the complainant while arguing Cri. Revision
No.554 of 2016 contends that Azhar (respondent No.2 in the above
mentioned criminal revision) has wrongly been awarded lesser
punishment by the learned trial Court whereas there was no mitigating
circumstance in this case, therefore, he may be awarded the normal

penalty of death.

8. I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the
parties, as well as, the learned Additional Prosecutor General and
have also gone through the evidence available on the record with

their able assistance.

9. The detail of the prosecution case as set forth in Fard Bayan
(Ex.PA) on the basis of which the formal FIR (Ex.PA/1), was chalked
out has already been given in Para No.3 of this judgment, therefore,

there is no need to repeat the same.

10. It is noteworthy that the learned trial Court has already
disbelieved the evidence of the prosecution eye-witnesses namely Dost
Muhammad complainant (PW-1) and Muhammad Yousaf (PW-3), in
paragraph No.23, of the impugned judgment, however, the appellant

has been convicted and sentenced on the basis of evidence of Rab
Cri. Appeal No.820 of 2016 &
Cri. Revision No.554 of 2016

Nawaz injured (PW-2). It is true that Rab Nawaz (PW-2), is an injured
eye-witness of this case but it is by now well settled that the injuries on
the body of a witness do not mean that he is telling the truth. Reliance
in this respect may be placed on the judgment reported as
“Muhammad Pervez and others Vs. The State and others” (2007
SCMR 670). The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan at page 681 of
the said judgment has observed as under:-
“Tt is also a settled law that injuries on P.W. only indication of his

presence at the spot but is not informative prove of his credibility
and truth. See said Ahmad’s case 1981 SCMR 795”.

11. It is further noteworthy that Azhar (appellant) was assigned the
role of making a fire shot, which landed on the right foot of Ahmad Ali
(deceased), whereas Ahmad Sher (co-accused since acquitted), has also
been attributed the role of making a fire shot, which landed on the right
calf of Ahmad Ali (deceased) but the abovementioned Ahmad Sher
(co-accused) has been acquitted by the learned trial Court and Criminal
Appeal No.912 of 2016 filed by the complainant against his acquittal
has already been dismissed due to non-prosecution by this Court vide
order dated 20.02.2020. No application has been filed by the
complainant till today for restoration of the abovementioned appeal,
despite the lapse of a period of more than one year and three months.
Under the circumstances, the acquittal of Ahmad Sher (co-accused) has
attained finality. It is by now well settled that if a prosecution evidence
is disbelieved qua one accused or one set of accused, then the same
evidence cannot be believed against the other accused or other set of

accused, without independent corroboration.

12. As mentioned earlier, Azhar (appellant) was attributed the role
that he made a fire shot which landed on the right foot of Ahmed Ali
(deceased) and according to the postmortem report of Ahmad Ali
(deceased), there was injury No.1-A, on his right foot, whereas the role

attributed to Ahmad Sher (co-accused since acquitted), was that he
Cri. Appeal No.820 of 2016 &
Cri. Revision No.554 of 2016

made a fire shot which landed on the right calf of Ahmed Ali
(deceased) and in the postmortem report of the deceased there was
injury No.2, on his right calf. According to the evidence of Dr. Inam
Jeelani (PW-5), all the injuries on the body of the deceased were the
cause of his death. Under the circumstances, the case of Azhar
(appellant), is not distinguishable on medical grounds from the case of

the abovementioned acquitted co-accused.

13. Learned Additional Prosecutor General assisted by learned
counsel for the complainant tried to distinguish the case of the Azhar
(appellant) from the case of abovementioned acquitted co-accused on
the ground that 12-bore gun (P-2) has been recovered from the
possession of the appellant, whereas no weapon was recovered from
the possession of abovementioned Ahmad Sher (co-accused since
acquitted) but I have noted that there is no report of Punjab Forensic
Science Agency regarding matching of any empty recovered from the
spot with the gun (P-2), therefore, alleged recovery of gun 12- bore (P-
2), on the pointation of the appellant is inconsequential for the
prosecution and as such there is no independent corroboration of the
prosecution case against Azhar (appellant), on account of above-

referred recovery.

14. ‘It is further noteworthy that as per prosecution case, the motive
behind the occurrence was that about one year prior to the occurrence
Imran and Usman sons of Faiz-ul-Hassan (co-accused since died)
along with others committed murder of nephew of the complainant.
The motive was specifically alleged against Faiz-ul-Hassan (co-
accused since died) and no specific motive was alleged against the
appellant. Apart from the abovementioned specific motive alleged
against Faiz-ul-Hassan (co-accused since died), the motive was jointly
alleged against all the accused persons. It is also noteworthy that Rab

Nawaz (PW-2), during his cross examination conceded that the
Cri. Appeal No.820 of 2016 &
Cri. Revision No.554 of 2016

appellant had no concern with the earlier FIR registered due to murder
of nephew of the complainant. Relevant part of his statement reads as
under:-

“Present accused Hassan, Ahmad Sher and Azhar had no

nexus with above mentioned FIR number 905 and they were
not the accused of said murder case”

Even otherwise, the motive was jointly alleged against Azhar
(appellant), as well as, against Ahmad Sher and Hassan (co-accused
since acquitted), therefore, the prosecution cannot seek independent

corroboration against the appellant from the alleged motive.

15. It is next contended by learned Additional Prosecutor General
assisted by learned counsel for the complainant that Ahmad Sher and
Hassan (co-accused since acquitted), were declared innocent during the
police investigation, whereas the appellant was found guilty, therefore,
the case of the appellant is distinguishable from the case of the
abovementioned acquitted co-accused. Insofar as the police opinion is
concerned, it is by now well settled that police opinion/finding
regarding the innocence or guilt of an accused becomes irrelevant after
recording of evidence of the parties by the learned trial Court. It is
further noteworthy that opinion of the police is inadmissible in
evidence. Reference in this context may be made to the case of
“Muhammad Ahmad (Mahmood Ahmed) and another Vs. The State”
(2010 SCMR 660) wherein at page No.676 the Hon’ble Supreme Court
of Pakistan was pleased to observe as under:-

“\....Jt may be mentioned here, for the benefit and guidance

of all concerned, that determination of guilt or innocence of

the accused persons was the exclusive domain of only the

Courts of law established for the purpose and the said

sovereign power of the Courts could never be permitted to be

exercised by the employees of the Police department or by

anyone else for that matter. If the tendency of allowing such-

like impressions of the Investigating Officer to creep into the

evidence was not curbed then the same could lead to
disastrous consequences. If an accused person could be let off
Cri. Appeal No.820 of 2016 & 10
Cri. Revision No.554 of 2016 —

or acquitted only because the Investigating Officer was of the
opinion that such an accused person was innocent then why
could not, on the same principle, another accused person be
hanged to death only because the Investigating Officer had
opined about his guilt......... ”

It is, therefore, evident that the case of the appellant cannot be
distinguished from the case of the above mentioned acquitted co-

accused on the basis of police opinion.

16. It is lastly argued by learned Additional Prosecutor General
assisted by learned counsel for the complainant that the appellant
remained absconder in this case for a considerable period after the
occurrence and he was declared a proclaimed offender, therefore, his
abscondance corroborates the prosecution case against him. There is no
substance in the abovementioned argument of learned Additional
Prosecutor General assisted by learned counsel for the complainant
because it is by now well settled that if the direct or circumstantial
prosecution evidence is not worthy of reliance on some grounds then
an accused cannot be convicted and sentenced merely on the basis of
his abscondance. I may refer here the judgment reported as “Haji Paio
Khan Vs. Sher _Biaz_and_ others” (2009 SCMR 803), wherein the
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to observe as under:-

“12. Insofar as the abscondance is concerned, it may be stated
that mere absconsion is not conclusive proof of guilt of an
accused person. It is only a suspicious circumstance against an
accused that he was found guilty of the offence. However,
suspicions after all are suspicions. The same cannot take the

place of proof.”

Similar view was taken by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan
in the cases of “Muhammad Tasaweer Vs. Hafiz Zulkarnain_and 2
others” (PLD 2009 Supreme Court 53), “Rahimullah Jan Vs. Kashif
and another” (PLD 2008 Supreme Court 298) & “Tahir Khan Vs. The
State” (2011 SCMR 646).
Cri. Appeal No.820 of 2016 & 11
Cri. Revision No.554 of 2016 —

17. Under the circumstances, the case of the appellant is not
distinguishable from the case of Ahmad Sher (co-accused since
acquitted) and as such, the prosecution evidence which has been
disbelieved against Ahmad Sher (co-accused since acquitted) cannot be
believed against the appellant without independent corroboration which
is very much lacking in this case, therefore, the appellant is also entitled
to the acquittal from the charge. In the case of “Muhammad Akram Vs.
The State” (2012 SCMR 440) the Apex Court of the Country at Page-
446 was pleased to observe as under:-

 hecee snes Since the same set of evidence has been disbelieved

qua the involvement of Muhammad Aslam, as such, the same

evidence cannot be relied upon in order to convict the

appellant on a capital charge as the statements of both the eye-

witnesses do not find any corroboration from any piece of
independent evidence.......... ”

Similar view was taken by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the
cases reported as “Akhtar Ali and others Vs. The State” (2008 SMCR
6), “Muhammad_Ali Vs. The State” (2015 SCMR 137), “Ulfat
Husain Vs. The State” (2018 SCMR 313), “Shaban_Akhtar_and
another Vs. The State through Prosecutor General Punjab” (2021
SCMR 395), “Liagat Ali and others Vs. The State and others” (2021
SCMR 455) and “Muhammad Yasin and another Vs. The State
through P.G. Punjab and others” (2020 SCMR 1237).

18. It is also noteworthy that for one deceased and one injured of
this case the complainant party implicated five (05) accused persons in
this case while assigning one or two injuries to each of them either on
the body of the deceased or on the body of Rab Nawaz (PW-2),
whereas, two additional accused were implicated in this case with the
allegation of abetment and as such total seven (07) accused persons
have been implicated in this case by the prosecution. Keeping in view

all the abovementioned facts, possibility of false involvement of the
*Aitazaz *

Cri. Appeal No.820 of 2016 & 12
Cri. Revision No.554 of 2016 —

appellant in this case by using the wider-net by the complainant cannot

be ruled out.

19. I have considered all the aspects of this case and have come to
this irresistible conclusion that the prosecution could not prove its case

against the appellant beyond the shadow of doubt.

20. In the light of above discussion, I accept Criminal Appeal
No.820 of 2016 filed by Azhar (appellant), set aside his conviction and
sentence recorded by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Chiniot
vide impugned judgment dated 15.03.2016 and acquit him of the
charge under Section 302(b) PPC by extending him the benefit of
doubt. Azhar (appellant) is in custody, he be released forthwith, if not

required in any other case.

21. Insofar as the Criminal Revision No.554 of 2016, filed by Dost
Muhammad (complainant) for enhancement of sentence awarded to
Azhar (respondent No.2 of the said criminal revision) from
imprisonment for life to death and compensation amount is concerned,
I have already disbelieved the prosecution evidence due to the reasons
mentioned in paragraph Nos.10 to 16 of this judgment and Azhar
(appellant) has been acquitted from the charge, therefore, this criminal

revision being devoid of any force is hereby dismissed.
