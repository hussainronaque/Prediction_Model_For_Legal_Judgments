JUDGMENT

Date of hearing 07.10.2019

Appellant-Petitioner

Respondent

SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.--- Appellant namely-

Pio Rehman (complainant), being aggrieved from judgment

dated 19.5.2012 passed by the learned Additional Sessions

Judge, Banda Daud Shah, Karak whereby the respondent

was acquitted from the charge.

2- Briefly stated facts of the case are that

appellant/complainant on 16.02.2008 at 12:20 hours

reported the matter to police to the effect that on the

eventful morning he along with Latif-ur-Rehman and Atta-

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
ur-Rehman came to Gurguri Bazar for purchase of

household articles, at about 11:30 hours on reaching the

spot, accused Faqir Gul, Salim Jan and Safeer Badshah duly

armed emerged and on seeing them, all the accused fired at

complainant party with intention to kill, resultantly, Atta-ur-

Rehman got hit and died on the spot, while complainant and

his other companion escaped unhurt luckily. Motive

advanced was dispute over property.

On completion of investigation, trial

commenced against the respondent/accused U/S. 512

Cr.P.C, wherein they were declared proclaimed offenders,

but after arrest of respondents/accused, supplementary

challan against him was put in court, prosecution produced

as many as twelve (12) witnesses. On the conclusion of

prosecution evidence, respondent/accused was examined

U/S. 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he professed innocence and false

implication, however, neither he opted to be examined on

Oath U/S. 340 (2) Cr.P.C nor produced defence. The

learned trial court after hearing pro and contra arguments,

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
acquitted the respondent/accused from the charges leveled

against him by giving him benefit of doubt, hence, the

instant criminal appeal.

It is worth mentioning here that co-accused

Saleem Jan died and proceedings against him were abated

by the trial court vide order dated 26.6.2019 in the initial

trial U/S. 512 Cr.P.C, against the respondent/ accused, and

so was a co-accused Faqir Gul.

3- Learned counsel for the parties as well as

learned Addl: A.G for the State were heard and with their

valuable assistance the record was thoroughly perused.

4- In the incident one Atta-ur-Rehman lost his life

and two eye-witesses, i.e, the complainant and Latif-ur-

Rehman escaped unhurt. The prosecution story is

unfolded when in the morning at 08:00 AM all the three, i.e,

the deceased, complainant and Latif-ur-Rehman _ eye-

witness left for Gurguri Bazar with the sole purpose to

purchase wheat, they after purchase at 11:00 AM left for

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
their village and when reached at the place of occurrence

known as Alwara Banda, it was 11:30 AM when the

accused facing trial with his co-accused Faqir Gul s/o

Haleem Gul, Saleem Khan s/o Hakeem Gul opened

indiscriminate firing which resulted in the death of the

deceased, but luckily the complainant (PW-7) and eye-

witness (PW-8) escaped unhurt.

The site-plan was prepared as Ex.PB on the

pointation of the complainant. The place is deserted one and

the three accused were shown duly armed with fire-arms,

whereas, the complainant side was empty handed, but

strange enough that only the deceased received fatal shots.

The motive was shown as property dispute

between the parties, but it surprises that when the dispute

was common then why only the deceased was targeted

when the other two were also at the mercy of accused. The

accused shown armed with AK-47, a sophisticated weapon

and the selection of the weapon leaves no doubt in mind,

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
had the witnesses been present at the time on the spot, their

fate would be no less than the deceased.

5- The site-plan contradicts the eye-witness

account and even the statements of the witnesses are pole

apart on this particular aspect of the case, Point-1 was given

to the deceased and similarly Point-2 and 3 to the

complainant and eye-witness respectively. On the other

hand, Point-4, 5, 6 to the appellant and co-accused, if the

stance of the witnesses is accepted that they were

proceeding from South to North then it disturbs, that why

the accused duly armed at Point-6 let the deceased and

others to pass smoothly without being fired upon and how

the fire made by the appellant landed on the extreme left of

the deceased when yet front of the deceased was exposed to

the appellant. The question still remained unanswered that

why the two who were leading the deceased did not receive

even a single fire arm injury. It leaves us nowhere but to

hold that the eye-witnesses were not present at the time with

the deceased. The witnesses remained inconsistent and

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
made conscious improvements, the eye-witness admitted

the presence of 2/3 feet ridge (Bana) between them whereas

the investigating officer confirmed its height as % feet then

why the assailants would expose their identity and why they

did not take shelter behind, on one hand to accomplish their

target and on the other to avoid of having been identified. It

is again surprising that though three persons made

indiscriminate firing, but only one empty of 7.62 bore was

recovered from the spot. Though the investigating officer in

his examination-in-chief stated that the site-plan was

prepared on pointation of the eye-witnesses, but the

witnesses denies to accept as they excluded the presence of

each other.

PW-8 Latif-ur-Rehman when cross-examined,

stated that he after Postmortem examination hired a taxi and

reached the spot where I.O and complainant were present

and pointed-out the spot whereas the investigating officer

said that after spot pointation by the complainant, they went

to the house of the deceased where PW-8 was present, so in

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
his company they again came to the spot for pointation. We

are anxious to know that once the spot had already been

pointed by the complainant and the recoveries were effected

then what led the investigating officer to come again to the

spot with witnesses, it leads nowhere but to hold that the

witnesses were not present with the deceased and the dead

body was taken to PS by the nearby villagers and later on

the witnesses were procured and appellant along with others

were charged.

6- The conduct of the witnesses is unnatural and

they tell nothing, but lie with the sole purpose to connect the

appellant with the offence, their presence is further doubted

when they say that the villagers hearing the fire shots came

to the spot after 30/35 minutes with a COT, how did the

villagers come to know that someone was killed and a COT

was needed to shift the body to hospital as non from the

eye-witnesses informed them, it leaves no ambiguity that

the witnesses were informed in the village of the incident

which admittedly was situated at a 30 minutesâ€™ walk.

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
Their presence is further shattered as the eye-

witness says that the COT was taken to the PS on foot

where as PW-4 Hafiz-ur-Rehman stated that the dead body

was brought to PS in vehicle.

The presence of PWs is further questioned

when PW-8 stated that after registration of FIR, the police

examined the dead body of the deceased at about 12:00

hours, on the other hand the report was made at 12:20 hours,

so it makes us believe that the dead body was brought to the

PS, proceedings were conducted and when the complainant

was procured, report was made.

7- This is on record that the deceased and

witnesses were involved in criminal cases including

abduction of ladies and this position was frankly conceded

by the investigating officer rather he admitted that the

deceased was a criminal and a thief.

The list of criminal cases gives the background

of the witnesses and deceased and if so, then how the

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
witnesses at the time of occurrence were empty handed and

had they been present they would not have so easily

surrendered and they would have specify that what accused

was armed with what weapon.

They admitted joint enmities with others and

their criminal association with the deceased confirms their

status of interested and chance witnesses and great care is

needed to award conviction on the evidence of such a

witness.

In case titled "Rohtas Khan Vs. The State"

(2010 SCMR 566 (C), wherein it has been held:-

"Story of following the
deceased by eye-witnesses just before the
occurrence did not appeal to common
sense, being against their natural conduct
--- Despite indiscriminate firing of about
100 rounds at the place of incident and
deceased having sustained 26 fire-arm
injuries, no empties of kalashnikov were
found on the spot---Motive was against the
complainant, but accused did not cause

any injury to him despite being within the

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
10

range of his firing---Ocular witnesses,
thus, did not seem to be present at the
place of occurrence---Ocular testimony
having inherent defects was _ neither
plausible nor reasonable and did not fall
within any exception, where the statements
of interested witnesses could be accepted
without corroboration, which was even

lacking in the case"

8- Though the motive alleged was _ landed

property dispute, but no revenue record was placed on file

to substantiate the claim of the witnesses and even the

investigating officer did not bother to collect evidence in

this respect. Once the motive is alleged, the prosecution is

bound to prove the same, failing which negative inference

shall be taken against the prosecution.

In case titled "Muhammad Ashraf alias

Acchu Vs The State" (2019 SCMR 652 Para-7), wherein it

has been held:-

"7. The motive is always a
double-edged weapon. The complainant
Sultan Ahmad (PW9) has admitted murder

enmity between the parties and has also

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
11

given details of the same in his statement
recorded before the trial court. No doubt,
previous enmity can be a reason for the
appellant to commit the alleged crime, but
it can equally be a reason for the
complainant side to falsely implicate the

appellant in this case for previous grouse."

9- The learned counsel for the appellant

vehemently argued that the respondent/accused remained

absconder for sufficient long time, but mere absconscion of

accused is not conclusive guilt of an accused person; it is

only a suspicious circumstance against an accused that he

was found guilty of the offence. However, suspicions after

all are suspicions, the same cannot take the place of proof,

the value of absconcion, therefore, depends on the facts of

each case.

In case titled " Liagat Hussain and others Vs

Falak Sher and others" (2003 SCMR_ 611(a),wherein it

has been held:-

"(a) Eye-witnesses including

the complainant had failed to furnish a

plausible and acceptable explanation for

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
12

being present on the scene of occurrence
and were chance witnesses---Prosecution
case did not inspire confidence and fell for
short of sounding probable to a man of
reasonable prudence---Abscondence of
accused in such circumstances could not
offer any useful corroboration to the case

of prosecution"

10- Needless to emphasis that when an accused

person is acquitted from the charge by a court of competent

jurisdiction then, double presumption of innocence is

attached to its order, with which the superior courts do not

interfere unless the impugned order is arbitrary, capricious,

fanciful and against the record. As was observed by the

Supreme Court of Pakistan in Muhammad Mansha Kausar

Vs. Muhammad Asghar & others (2003 SCMR 477) "that

the law relating to reappraisal of evidence in appeals

against acquittal is stringent in that the presumption of

innocence is doubled and multiplied after a finding of not

guilty is recorded by a competent court of law Such

findings cannot be reversed, upset and disturbed except

when the judgment is found to be perverse, shocking,

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
13

alarming, artificial and suffering from error of
jurisdiction or mis reading,  non-reading of
evidence........law requires that a judgment of acquittal
shall not be disturbed even though second opinion may

reasonably be possible."

In view of what has been discussed above, we
do not find any ground to interfere with the impugned

judgment. Accordingly, the appeal being devoid of force is

dismissed.
