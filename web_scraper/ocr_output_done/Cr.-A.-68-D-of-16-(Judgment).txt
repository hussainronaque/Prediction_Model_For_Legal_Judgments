4. At the trial the prosecution examined fourteen

witnesses. Lady Doctor Khurshid Bhittani, who had
-4-

conducted autopsy, appeared as PW-6. She noted
following injuries on her person.

External Appearance

A young lady wearing printed Qameez

and pink Shalwar with pink Dopata,

ear rings, nose pin of gold. Rigor

mortis developed.

Wound

All the incised wounds and crushed on

the left side of the face. There was

fractured of nose, upper lip cut and

cheek brekented. There was fractured

of mandible jaw. All the cheeks,

nostrils of nose cut.
The doctor opined that death had occurred due to injury to
vital organs, injury by sharp weapon leading to shock,
coma and death. According to her, duration between
injury and death 10 to 20 minutes while duration between
death and postmortem, 12 to 14 hours. Ghulam Rasool
(PW-8) narrated the facts given by him in the FIR.
Ghulam Qadir (PW-9) stated that deceased Zaroba Bibi
was his sister. He had gone to Karachi for earning
livelihood. There he was informed telephonically about
the murder of his sister by convict. In pursuance thereof,

he left Karachi for D.I.Khan and reached on the following
-5-

morning at about 8.00 a.m when he reached to his house,
found dead body of his sister. He inquired about the
incident from inmates of the house, who disclosed that
Azeem Khan had committed murder of deceased with axe
and decamped from the spot. He was examined by the I.0,
wherein he charged the accused for committing murder of
his sister. Safdar HC, who appeared as PW-14 stated of
having witnessed the recovery of axe P-2, lastly worn
garments of the deceased stained with blood Ex. P-3.

5. The accused when examined after close of
prosecution evidence denied the charge and pleaded
innocence. He did not produce any evidence in defence.

6. The prosecution case depended on the
testimony of PW-8 & 9, namely Ghulam Rasool (uncle of
the deceased) Ghulam Qadir (brother of the deceased).
Recovery of blood stained earth and blood stained axe
from crime scene, recovery of dead body of Mst. Zaroba
Bibi from the house of the convict, medical evidence
plead guilty of the appellant in previous trial and
abscondence of accused.

7. Learned counsel for the appellant while
criticizing the testimony of PW-8 & 9 contended that they
did not witness the occurrence, there statement is based on
hearsay, therefore, not be relied upon for conviction of

appellant. He next contended that recoveries of axe and
-6-

blood stained earth is not reliable and be excluded from
consideration. He further contended that medical evidence
does not connect the appellant with the alleged crime. He
lastly contended that the prosecution has failed to prove
that the appellant was owner and in exclusive possession
of the house where alleged murder was committed and
prayed for outright acquittal of the accused.

8. As against that, learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the complainant argued that the complainant and
PW-9 Ghulam Qadir has no ill will to falsely depose
against the appellant. He next urged that circumstances
established that prosecution has proved its case against the
appellant beyond a ray of doubt. He lastly argued that
after commission of offence the accused remained at large
for quite sufficient time, which proves his guilty,
conscious and prayed for dismissal of appeal.

9. The learned A.A.G representing the State added
that the recoveries of implicating material from the spot
and medical evidence fully corroborates the statement of
PW-9 & 10, he concluded that prosecution has proved its
case against the appellant beyond a ray of doubt and
prayed to maintain the impugned judgment.

10. We have carefully gone through the evidence
on record and have heard the learned counsel for the

parties with their eminent assistance.
-7-

11. Perusal of the record reflects that the crime in
this case had taken place in odd hours/small hours of the
fateful night at unknown time in the 2" last week of
December. The crime scene was inside house of the
appellant. The FIR of the incident was lodged at 16 hours
and according to site plan (Ex.P-B) there was other houses
situated close to the house of occurrence.

12. We found in the deposition of PW-8 Ghulam
Rasool that he was informed by a child, who had came
from the house of the accused, about the incident, when he
was present in his house alongwith Zain-uddin and Sher
Muhammad, on receipt of this information he rushed to
the crime scene alongwith the said Zain-uddin and Sher
Muhammad, where they found the dead body of the
deceased and blood stained axe. They inquired about the
incident from the inmates of the house, who unanimously
disclosed that the deceased Mst. Zroba Bibi was done to
death by his husband (appellant) by means of axe.
Admitteldy, Ghulam Rasool (PW-8) and Ghulam Qadir
(PW-9) are not the eye witnesses of the alleged
occurrence, their statement is based on the information
furnished to them by the inmates of the house, therefore, it
can safely be held that their statements were based on
hearsay and being not hit by Article 71 of Qanun-e-

Shahadat Ordinance, 1984, is not admissible which says
-8-

that oral evidence must be direct. It was deposed by Sattar
Khan S.I (PW-10) that he had recorded the statement of
parents and brothers of the appellant, but astonishingly,
during trial they were not produced as witnesses to
corroborate the statement of complainant, Sher
Muhammad and Zain-uddin. They have been abandoned
for no good reasons.

13. The allegation of the prosecution that murder of
the appellant’s wife in his house may be a circumstance to
be taken into account alongwith other prosecution
evidence. However, this may by itself not sufficient to
establish appellant’s guilt in the absence of any other
evidence of the prosecution connecting him with the
crime. The prosecution has failed to establish that the
house where the murder was committed was in absolute
and exclusive possession of the accused as we found in the
deposition of Ghulam Rasool (PW-8) that he found other
inmates of the house when he visited the crime scene.

14. The basic principle of criminal jurisprudence is
that prosecution is under legal obligation to prove its case
against the accused beyond a ray of doubt. This burden
remains throughout and does not shift to the shoulder of
accused, who is only burdened to prove a defence plea.
Therefore, contention of the learned counsel for the

complainant that some part of the onus had shifted to the

-9-

appellant to explain the circumstances under which his
wife met unnatural death in his house on the fateful night,
but he had failed to discharge that part of the onus. We
have considered this aspect of the case and found that the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove the guilt of the
accused through positive and cogent evidence. In this
context we are fortified by the judgment reported as
Nasrullah alias Nasro vs The State (2017 SCMR 724)
and Asad Khan the State (PLD 2017 SC 681), wherein it
has been held that:

“The above mentioned shifting of same point of
the onus to the accused may not be relevant in a
case where the entire case of the prosecution
itself is not reliable and where the prosecution

fails to produce any believable evidence.
15. In this behalf reference may also be made to
the case reported as Abdul Majeed vs The State (2011
SCMR 941), wherein it has been observed that:

“In the absence of direct or substantial
evidence the conviction of a person cannot be
sustained merely on account of failure to explain
the murder of his wife in his house ”

In this context reliance can also be placed on the case

reported as Umer Zaman vs The State (2013 PCr.LJ

708).
-10-

16. Now adverting to contention of the learned
counsel for the complainant that in earlier trial the accused
had pleaded guilty and was convicted and sentenced.
However, in appeal his conviction and sentence was set
aside by this Court and case was remanded with the
direction to frame charge against the accused/appellant
afresh by recording his plea of guilty in his own words
and then decide the case afresh after recording evidence of
the prosecution and statement of appellant vide judgment
dated 30.05.2015, after remand, the accused/appellant on
04.07.2012 submitted an application before the learned
trial Court for his examination by the medical board as he
is suffering from mental disorder, his request was acceded t&
on 04.07.2012, whereafter, he was examined by the
Standing Medical Board and opined as under

“That the accused has a past history

of psychotic illness with depression.

He still exhibit, disturbed behavior

abnormally of thinking and

perceptual _ abnormalities. The

Standing Medical Board is of the

opinion that he needs treatment with

anti-psychotic medication. At the

moment he does not understands the

proceedings of the Court, nature of

his offence its consequence therefore,

‘he is unfit to plead in the Court of

law. The board would review him

after one year during this period he

needs to be in a secure please like
prison”.
-ll-

17. After receipt of opinion of Medical Board, the
learned trial Court, postponed the trial for a period of one
year vide order dated 12.12.2012, after lapse of one year,
he was again examined by the Medical Board on

13.03.2014 and furnished following opinion.

The Standing Medical Board is of the
opinion that the accused suffers from
Chronic schizophrenia which is a
major mental illness. The accused has
responded to medication and has
made significant recovery. The
Standing Medical Board is of the
opinion that at the moment he is very
well communicative, coherent and
rational. He understands the nature of
his crime, its consequences court
proceedings and therefore is fit to
plead in the Court of law. However
since schizophrenic illness is chronic
and relapsing condition the accused
needs treatment with anti-psychotic
medication for foreseeable future. The
honourable Court may dispose off his
case under relevant section of mental
health act.

Whereafter, proceedings were restored and _ trial
commenced.

18. In the instant case, the mental state of the
convict during previous trial at the time of framing of
charge is relevant. He did not defend his case and pleaded
guilty. In his statement under Section 342 Cr.P.C, he
stated that for the last so many years he is suffering from
mental disease and on 23.08.2011, he was under the

influence of his mental disease and was unable to
-12-

understand the proceedings of the Court. His contention
leads support from medical evidence.

19, After going through the opinion of medical
board, we are of the considered view that convict was not
able to understand the proceedings of the Court at the time
of framing of charge during earlier trial and was not aware
of the consequences of admission of guilt, therefore, this
would be of no help to the prosecution to prove the guilt
of the accused.

20. The evidence of recovery of axe P-2 from the
crime scene is of no consequence for determining the guilt
of the appellant, the reason being that the axe was found
lying on the crime scene. It was neither recovered at the
instance of the accused nor it belonged to him, so it cannot
be presumed that it was the appellant who had used the
axe for inflicting the injuries.

21. Safdar Hussain while appearing as PW-14
deposed about having witnessed recovery of blood stained
earth, axe P-2 form the spot and lastly worn garments of
deceased Ex. PW-3, but did not say anything about the
occurrence.

22. The learned trial Court while convicting the
accused sought corroboration from medical evidence. It

is by now settled that medical evidence neither identify
-13-

the assailant nor pin point the accused, at the most it
reflects the seat of the injury, duration and weapon used in
the commission of offence and cause of death. In this
behalf reliance can be placed on the case reported as
Hashim Qasim and another vs The State (2017 SCMR
986) and Abdul Majeed vs Mulazim Hussain and otherse
(PLD 2007 SC 637).

23. Adverting to abscondence of the accused, no
doubt the accused remained absconder for more than eight
years, however it is by now settled that abscondence can
never remedy the defects in the prosecution case as it is
not indicative of guilt. People do abscond out of fear to be
killed in retaliation or to avoid police torture and duress.
In this respect reference may be made to the case reported
as Mehar Khan and others vs the State (PLD 1977 SC
41).

24. For the reasons noted above, doubts have
arisen in our mind and we feel that it would not be
safe to maintain conviction of the appellant. This
appeal is, therefore, allowed and the appellant is
acquitted by way of grant of benefit of doubt. He shall

be released forthwith if not required in any other case.

-14-

25. Above are the reasons of our short order of
even date.
