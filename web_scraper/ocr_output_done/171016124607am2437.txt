2. The learned trial Court has also
sent Murder Reference No. 07-M/2014 to
this Court for confirmation of the death
sentence under Section 374, Cr.P.C.
3. Abstract of the prosecution case
as set out in the first information report is that
on 25.10.2013, on receiving information from
Army personnel on duty in village Koza
Bandai, Akbar Zeb Khan, S.H.O of Police
Station Kanju, accompanied by police
contingents rushed to the place of occurrence
where he found the body of an unknown boy
aged 11/12 years. At that time complainant
Muhammad Tariq also reached to the spot and
made a report to the effect that on the same
day his brother went out of his house at
morning but did not return for taking lunch, so
search was started for him. At the time of Isha
prayers information was received that dead
body of a boy is lying in Doghalgo Banda. For

confirmation, the complainant alongwith his

JCF.A No. 179 of 2014 Suleman Vs. The State
TajamuliPS*

maternal uncle namely Amanullah reached to
the spot and saw that dead body of his brother
was lying there and Police as well as Army
personnel were also present on the spot.
During search and probe the children
informed the complainant that his deceased
brother Attaullah had gone with Suleman on
his donkey-cart. The complainant examined
his brother and found that accused had killed
the deceased by pressing his neck as well as
hitting his head with something apart from
subjecting him to sodomy. May be the
occurrence have been witnessed by someone.
The complainant charged accused Suleman
for the offences.

4. The S.H.O prepared injury sheet
of the deceased and sent the dead body for
post-mortem. He recorded the report of
complainant in Murasila (Ex.PW-8/1) on the
basis of which F.I.R (Ex.PA) was registered
against accused Suleman son of Jannat Gul.

5. The accused was arrested on the

same day i.e on 25.10.2013 and after

JCr.A No, 179 of 2014 Suleman Vs. The State
TajamuPS*

conducting usual investigation, the local
police put complete challan in Court for trial
of the accused. The learned trial Court framed
formal charge against the accused to which he
pleaded not guilty and opted to face the trial.
Prosecution produced and examined as many
as thirteen (13) witnesses in support of its case
whereafter statement of the accused under
Section 342, Cr.P.C was recorded wherein he
denied the allegations of prosecution,
however, he neither recorded his statement on
oath in terms of Section 340(2), Cr.P.C nor
wished to produce evidence in his defence. At
conclusion of the trial, the trial Court vide
judgment dated 24.06.2014 found the accused
guilty of offences under Sections 302 and 377
PPC and sentenced him as mentioned in Para
No.1 of this judgment. Being aggrieved, the
appellant-convict has sent this appeal through
Jail authorities whereby he has challenged his
conviction and sentence vide the impugned

judgment.

TajamuPs*

6. Learned counsel for the appellant
engaged on State expenses, inter alia,
contended that the appellant was below 18
years at the time of occurrence. Further
contended that the learned trial Court has not
duly exercised the jurisdiction vested in him
under Section 7 of the Juvenile Justice System
Ordinance, 2000 according to which the trial
Court was under obligation to hold an inquiry
before conducting the trial in order to settle
the question of age whether the accused at the
time of occurrence was above 18 years or
otherwise. Learned counsel further contended
that opportunity of fair trial has not been
afforded to the appellant, therefore, the
impugned conviction is not legally
sustainable. He added that the alleged
confessional statement of the accused is the
result of pressure and severe torture which has
not been considered in light of well settled
principles of criminal justice. Learned counsel
concluded that in view of serious illegalities

as well procedural irregularities, the impugned

JCr.A No. 179 of 2014 Suleman Vs. The State
Tajamuy/PS*

judgment, on no touch stone, could be
considered to have been delivered according
to law. He submitted that the impugned
judgment be set aside and the appellant be
acquitted in the interest of justice.

7. As against that learned Assistant
Advocate General, appearing on behalf of
State, inter alia, contended that the appellant
has recorded his confessional statement which
is duly corroborated by circumstantial as well
as ocular account produced by the
prosecution, therefore, the impugned
judgment, being well-reasoned, is legally
correct. Further contended that the appellant
has committed heinous offences, therefore,
the impugned judgment cannot be legally set
aside merely on the basis of formal defects.
When confronted with the question regarding
determination of age by the trial Court,
learned A.A.G. opposed the same and
contended that the plea was never raised

before the trial Court.

JCr.A No. 179 of 2014 Suleman Vs. The State
Tajamul/PS*

8. Complainant was present in
person before the Court on the last date of
hearing and stated that he will rely on the
arguments of learned Assistant Advocate
General.

9 We have gone through the record
in light of valuable assistance of learned
counsel for the appellant as well learned
A.A.G.

10. In the card of arrest (Ex.P W-8/4),
age of the accused was mentioned as 18/19
years, in his medical examination the doctor
showed the accused 18/20 years of age
whereas in charge-sheet the trial Court
mentioned the age of accused as 19 years.
Thereafter, statement of the accused under
Section 342, Cr.P.C was recorded after 8
months but even then his age was mentioned
by the learned trial Court as 19 years.

Ii. The appellant, in the present
appeal, has taken the plea of his age with the
contention that he was hardly 17 years of age

at the time of the alleged offence. No doubt,

JCK.A No. 179 of 2014 Suleman Vs. The State
TajamuliPS*

the appellant was sent by this Court to
Standing Medical Board and as per report
dated 03.11.2015, the Board opined that age
of the accused is more than 23 years but
record of the Medical Board would not be a
conclusive proof of determination of age
unless the doctors who gave the opinion are
brought to the witness box by affording
opportunity to the parties of cross-
examination. In addition to the opinion of
Medical Board, the trial Court was supposed
to make efforts to clarify the anomaly of age
by summoning the NADRA officials and
school record, if any, to ascertain whether the
appellant was above 18 years or otherwise at
the relevant time but no such effort by the trial
Court appears on the face of record. Hence, it
is held that the trial Court has not made the
compliance of Section 7 of the Juvenile
Justice System Ordinance, 2000 which reads
as:-
“7. Determination of age.--- If a

question arises as to whether a
person before it is a child for the

JCr.A No. 179 of 2014 Suleman Vs. The State
Tajamul/PS*

purpose of this Ordinance, the
Juvenile Court shall record a finding
after such inquiry which shall
include a medical report for
determination of the age of the
child”.

While deciding the case

titled “Muhammad Aslam and others V/s. The

State _and_another” (PLD 2009 Supreme
Court 777), the Hon’ble apex Court laid
down some principles for regulating the
determination of age of accused and inter alia
observed thats

“(f) proper compliance of the said
provisions of Section 7 would be to
call upon the parties to lead their
evidence — oral or documentary in
accordance with the provisions of
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order of 1984
with a right to the other party to
test the veracity or the
genuineness of the same in
accordance with law and then to
arrive at a judicial decision in
terms thereof”.

12. The contention of learned counsel
for the appellant that the accused was not
afforded the opportunity of fair trial and
reference was made to media hype as well as
to Order Sheet No. 05 dated 12.12.2013 which

reads as:-

We are in agreement with learned
counsel for the appellant that Courts should
not be influenced by heinousness of the
offence or public pressure. The Courts are
under obligation to administer justice under
the law and the right of fair trial cannot be
taken away from an accused through any
extraneous grounds and especially when the
case is of capital punishment. Perusal of the
order sheet would reveal that in Tehsil Kabal
none of the advocates was ready to defend the
accused and thereafter two lawyers were
engaged for him through an N.G.O namely
SHARP. Here in our view if the lawyers were
not experts in criminal cases then it was the

duty of the trial Court to engage a counsel

JCr.A No. 179 of 2014 Suleman Vs. The State
Tajamul/PS*

-ll-

having expertise on criminal law under the
High Court Rules and Orders.
Notwithstanding the nature of the offence
whether heinous, brutal or sensational every
accused has inalienable constitutional right to
have a fair trial before a competent Court.
Reliance in this regard is placed on the
judgment of the Supreme Court of India in
the case titled “Muhammad _Hussain_alias

State (Govt. of NCT), Delhi_(2012 SCMR

1610) wherein it has been held that:-

“In my view, every person,
therefore, has a right to a fair trial
by a competent Court in the spirit
of the right to life and personal
liberty. The object and purpose of
providing competent legal aid to
undefended and _ unrepresented
accused persons are to see that the
accused gets free and fair, just
and reasonable trial of charge in a
criminal case”.

In case when an accused is
unable to engage a counsel then in such
situation heavy duty lies on the shoulders of
the trial Court to adjudge the matter and
appreciate the prosecution evidence with care

and caution. If the witnesses are not duly

JCK.A No. 179 of 2014 Suleman Vs. The State
Tajamul/PS*

-12-

cross-examined then the trial Court can put
questions to the witnesses for ascertaining the
real facts for the just and proper decision of
the case. In the present case the accused was
unrepresented and was defended by counsels
engaged by the Court through an N.G.O, in
such like circumstances, in our view, proper
justice has not been done to the accused
appellant especially when death sentence was
awarded to him which required utmost care
and caution.

13. Keeping in view the above
mentioned situation of the present case,
remand of the case has become inevitable.
Therefore, this appeal is allowed, the
impugned judgment of the trial Court is set
aside and the case is remanded and entrusted
to the Court of Sessions Judge, Swat at
Gulkada who shall _ himself conduct
proceedings in the case. The learned Sessions
Judge shall first engage a counsel for the
accused under High Court Rules and Orders

and thereafter shall hold an inquiry under

JCr.A No. 179 of 2014 Suleman Vs. The State
ond

-13-

Section 7 of the Juvenile Justice System
Ordinance, 2000. If it is established after the
inquiry that at the time of occurrence the
accused was juvenile then denovo trial of the
accused be conducted under the ibid
Ordinance otherwise the learned Court, either
on the request of the accused or on its own
motion, shall re-summon the material
witnesses in order to enable the accused to
further cross-examine them. Needless to
mention that the accused shall be treated as
under trial prisoner by the Court as well by

jail authorities. Murder Reference No. 07-M/

- 2014 is answered in Negative.
