SHAHID KHAN, J.-— Appellant, Kashmaloo, after having
been tried by the learned Judge, Special Court / Additional
Sessions Judge-II, Karak, was convicted.and sentenced under
section 9(d), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 2019, to rigorous imprisonment for life with
fine in the sum of Rs.5,00,000/- or in default thereof, to suffer
12 months S.I. vide judgment, dated 15.12.2022 rendered in
case FIR No.252, dated 21.08.2021 registered under section
9(d) ibid at Police Station Sabirabad, District Karak. It obliged
the appellant to approach this Court through the subject appeal.
2. Brief, but relevant facts, culminating in registration of the
case, are that on 21.08.2021 at around 17:00 hours, complainant
Qabil Khan SITIO (PW-06) accompanied by police contingent

had made barricade at Kamran Shaheed Chowk, when noticed a
person coming from ‘labbi side with two cartons in his hands.
‘The person being suspected was stopped where the cartons, in
his possession, were searched which led to recovery of 10 / 10
packets of Charas, cach of which contained different quantitics.
Afier due weighment, the total quantity came out 24280 grams
and as such, the Charas were taken into possession after
separating sample parcels of 05 / 05 grams from cach of the
recovered packets for the purpose of chemical analysis at the
Forensic Science Laboratory vide recovery memo lix.PW-6/2,
duly attested by marginal witnesses. ‘The person was
accordingly arrested, who disclosed his name as Kashmalo son
of Kafeel resident of Jamal Khel, Tehsil Landi Kotal, District
Khyber. Murasila was draficd & prepared and was sent to the
police station through constable Muhammad Arif No.380 for
registration of the case. Hence, the ibid FIR.

3. After completion of investigation, complete challan was
drawn and accordingly sent up for trial. To substantiate its
version, the prosecution placed reliance on the account /
statements of as many as 08 witnesses. On close of prosecution
evidence, statement of accused appellant was recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein, he professed innocence and false
implication, however, he neither opted to be examined on oath
as provided under section 340(2) Cr.P.C nor wished to produce

defence evidence. After hearing arguments, the learned trial
Court arrived at the conclusion that the prosecution has
successfully brought home charge against the appellant, as
such, vide impugned judgment, dated 15.12.2022, convicted
and sentenced the appellant as mentioned above. Hence, the
instant appeal against the judgment of conviction.

4, We have heard at a considerable Iength learned counsel
for the appellant as well as the worthy Assistant Advocate
General representing the State and scanned through the record,
with their valuable assistance.

5. Record reveals that the accused appellant, after having
been booked in the instant case, was tried by the learned Judge
Special Court / Additional Sessions Judge-II, Karak and on
conclusion of the trial, the learned trial court arrived at the
conclusion that the prosecution has successfully brought home
charge against the appellant / accused, as such, the Court was
pleased to convict him for the charges vide the impugned
judgment. The appellate Court shall examine as to whether the
Icarned trial court appreciated the evidence so furnished in its
letter & spirit and as to whether the impugned judgment is the
outcome of application of judicial mind to the facts and
circumstances of the case. There is no denial of the fact that
under the ibid Act, stringent punishments are provided for the
offences thereunder and when the punishment is severe, then

the prosecution is equally burdened to prove the charges to the
hilt. In the present case, the prosecution examined as many as
08 witnesses and to ascertain as to whether the learned trial
judge was justified to convict the appellant, the Court felt it
essential to revisit and re-appreciate the cvidence once
appreciated, so that miscarriage of justice could be avoided.

6. | The prosecution case as set up is that on 21.08.2021 at
about 17:00 hours, complainant Qabil Khan SHO (PW-06)
accompanied by police contingent had installed / improvised
barricade at Kamran Shaheed Chowk, when a person having
two cartons in his hands, on his way from Tabbi side, was
noticed and stopped being suspected. The cartons in his
possession were searched on the basis where 10 / 10 packets
containing Charas were recovered from the same. After
weighment, the Charas came out 24280 grams in foto. Out of
the recovered contraband, sample parcels weighing 05 / 05
grams were separated from cach packet and sealed in separate
parcels for chemical analysis, whereas, the remaining quantity
was packed and sealed separately vide recovery memo [x.PW-
6/2. The complainant being the star witness was examined as
PW-06, who stated that on the day of incident, while on
barricade duty, he noticed the accused appellant with cartons in
his hands; that the accused appellant afier being suspected was
stopped and the cartons were scarched wherefrom the

contraband in shape of 10 / 10 packets of Charas were
de

recovered; that out of cach packet, he separated sample parcels
of 05 / 05 grams for the purpose of chemical analysis at FSL,
which he packed & sealed in parcels No.1! to 10 and 12 to 21
respectively, whereas, the remaining quantity was packed and
sealed in separate parcels No.11 and 22 respectively; that he
arrested the accused appellant and issued his arrest card and
also drafted & prepared the murasila, it was sent to Police
Station through constable Muhammad Arif # 380 and that on
arrival of Investigating Officer to the spot, he pointed him out
the site plan as also the recovered stuff. This witness was cross-
examined by the defense, but nothing detrimental to the
prosecution case could be extracted from his mouth. The
witness was examined regarding his arrival at the spot, the
manner in which the accused appellant was apprehended and
the mode of recovery from his direct possession but he
remained firm and consistent on material facts &
circumstances. In order to ascertain as to whether the
complainant was telling the whole truth and as to whether the
incident occurred in the mode, manner and the stated time, the
Court feel it essential to go through the statement of Nascer
Iqbal (PW-08), who was present with complainant at the time
and place of recovery and that in his presence, the recovery was
effected from the possession of accused appellant. This witness

was cross-examined on material aspects of the case, but he
remained catcgoric to what the complainant stated and
supported the contents of recovery memo Ex.PW-6/2. The
witness supported the mode and manner in which the accused
appellant was stopped and the process of search, scizure and
arrest was carried out followed by separation and sealing of the
parcels on the spot. The witness disclosed all the events in the
manner it occurred right from the beginning till the end. The
deposition made by this witness is natural and completely in
line with version of the prosecution case. The police official,
who transmitted the murasila report from spot to the PS and the
one, who incorporated its contents in the shape of FIR Ex.PA,
were produced and cxamined as PW-04 and PW-05
respectively. The latter being the carrier of murasila, testified
that it was he who took the same from spot to the PS where he
handed it to the former, whereas, the former having registered
the FIR soon on receiving the murasila, testified in that respect.
Both these witnesses remained firm & consistent as far as
transmission of murasila, its receipt and incorporation of its
contents in shape of IR are concerned.

7. The investigating officer was examined as PW-03, who,
inter alia, stated that after recciving copy of the F.I.R, he
visited the spot where he prepared the site plan on pointation of
complainant as also the recovery memo Ex.PW-2/1 duly

attested by marginal witnesses. The witness further stated that
he placed on file copy of daily diary pertaining to their
departure from, and arrival at, the police station in connection
with investigation and also the FSI report Ix.PZ regarding the
result of stuff recovered. The investigating officer was cross
examined on material aspects of the case, but his testimony
could not be shattered and he remained categoric to the factum
of contraband being recovered from the accused appellant by
the complainant and the process of investigation which he
carried out. Muharrir of the police station was examined as PW-
Ol, who affirmed that it was he who sent through constable
Rahim Ullah No.467 the case property to ISL after making its
entry in Register No.19, maintained for the purpose. Similarly,
constable Rahim Ullah No.467 was cxamined as PW-07, he
too, while affirming the deposition made by PW-01, stated that
it was he, to whom the sample parcels alongwith application
and route certificate were handed over by Muharrir for
transmission to ISL. Peshawar, which he accordingly
transmitted and on return, handed over to Muharrir of the police
station route certificate duly stamped by the concerned official
of KS] Peshawar. The two were subjected to Iengthy cross
examination, but they remained in harmony with cach other as
far as the date, time and mode & manner of transmission and

handing over of the parcels to the concerned official at FST are
act

concerned and nothing detrimental could be brought out from
their mouth.

8. All the witnesses have narrated the episode in a
straightforward manner and remained consistent as regards the
mode & manner in which the accused appellant was arrested,
the process of search and seizure which was carried out,
weighment of contraband and scparation of samples from the
packets coupled with its sealing in separate parcels, arrival of
investigating officer to the spot and the proceedings he
conducted. Kecping in view the consistency in the testimony of
prosecution witnesses in juxtaposition with the collected
evidence vis-a-vis the peculiar facts & circumstances, the
prosecution has not only been successful in proving the factum
of recovery, right from the beginning till the end, but has also
been successful in proving safe custody of the recovered
contraband and its safe transmission to the Forensic Science
Laboratory, where the report x.PZ was received in positive
and as such, it has further strengthened the case of the
prosccution. It is pertinent to mention that the recovery was
effected on 21.08.2021, whereas, the sample parcels were sent
to, and received by, the laboratory on 24.08.2021, so for all
intents and purposes, the requirement of Rule-4 of the Control
of Narcotic Substances (Government Analysts) Rules, 2001

pertaining to dispatch of sample parcel to the laboratory within
72 hours, which, though is directory in nature, but even then
stood fulfilled.

9. Though, it was agitated time and again that safe custody
of the recovered contraband has not been proved, but we are not
convinced. As stated above, we have before us the testimony of
Muharrir of the police station who was examined as PW-01 and
the constable who transmitted the sample parcels to the FSL as
PW-07. The witness deposed in a straightforward manner that
he took out the sample parcels from Maal Khana and sent the
same through Constable Rahim Ullah No.497 (PW-07), who
too affirmatively deposed in that respect. While substantiating
safe custody, the witness made reference to entry made in
Register No.19, which is available on file as ix.PW-3/5. This
piece of evidence supports the version of PW-01 with regard to
safe custody. The defence failed to cross examine the witness
cither regarding the safe custody or the entry made in Register
No.19 in that respect. As the witness was nol cross examined on
material point, so the provisions of Article 133 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 can be pressed into service and as such,
this aspect of the case would be deemed to have been admitted
by the defence. Wisdom could well be derived from the law laid
down in the case of “Muhammad Rafiq Vs Abdul Aziz” (2021
SCMR 1805 Supreme Court) whercin it has been held that:
-10-

“It is settled that a material point of

statement of a witness which is not

cross-examined is deemed to have

been admitted by the other side.”
10. Besides, the case property was duly deposited in Maal
Khan by Muharrir of the police station on the same day, the
same fact is evident from daily diary dated 21.08.2021 (Ex.PW-
3/4). The Muharrir while appearing as PW-01 too affirmed in
his cross examination that it was the complainant, who handed
him over the case property on the day of recovery. Though,
learned counsel for the appellant attempted to harvest the reap
of omission on part of complainant to hand over the case
property to the investigating officer on the spot after his arrival,
but we cannot ignore that on one hand, the factum of recovery
has otherwise been proved to the hilt, whereas, on the other, the
prosecution has successfully proved safe custody of the
recovered contraband coupled with its timely transmission to
the ISI, so such omission at the most can be interpreted to be
inefficiency of both the complainant to hand it over and the
investigating officer as well, to take the same on spot. There is
no cavil to the proposition that when guilt of accused person is
otherwise proved through confidence inspiring evidence, then
mere inefficiency on part of investigating officer could not be

taken a sole ground for acquittal, that too, in a case involving
-ll-

such a huge quantity of narcotics. We cannot ignore that the
menace of drug addiction is a potential threat to our socicty, as
it adverscly affects the lives of many innocent youngsters and
as such, keeping in view the huge quantity so recovered, it can
never be denicd that such quantity was solely meant for the
purpose of sell. The Legislature keeping before the increasing
tendency of this evil was conscious enough to bring about
legislative strictness in the form of the 2019 Act, so the
offenders booked under the Act must be combated with judicial
response and no benefit on account of such inefficiency on the
part of law enforcement agency can be extended to them, more
particularly, when the factum of recovery and safe custody is
overwhelmingly proved as is the case before us. The
submission of learned counsel for the appellant, thus, merits no
consideration and is discarded as such. It is pertinent to mention
that the defense could not bring on record that what mala fide
cither the complainant or the investigating officer or even any
other police official had against the accused appellant to falscly
charge him for commission of the offence. Even otherwise,
clement of malafide or false implication, that too, in a case
involving such a huge quantity is out of the question, because
the accused appellant belongs to District Khyber, whereas, the
recovery was cffected from his direct possession in District

Karak. The appellant has badly failed to establish to the
S

-12-

contrary the very purpose of his presence at the place of
recovery.

11. Learned counsel for the appellant referred to some minor
discrepancies in the statements of the witnesses, but the same
being trivial, cannot be pressed into service to dislodge the
trustworthy account furnished by the prosecution witnesses on
one hand, and the inherent worth of the collected material, on
the other. It cannot be ignored that the witnesses tasted the test
of cross examination after a considerable period of the date of
recovery, so the minor contradictions with regard to the
timings, or the exact number of police officials, who
accompanied the complainant or the investigating officer, as the
case may be, were bound to occur, because it cannot be denied
that police officials conduct the like proceedings on day to day
basis and as such, it would be unnatural to expect them to
disclose in each and every such case with exactitude the timings
or the number of officials accompanying the complainant or the
investigating officer. Besides, under the criminal administration
of justice, minor contradictions or discrepancies, which do not
go deep to the roots of a particular case, cannot be made sole
ground for acquittal, more particularly, when guilt of accused
person is otherwise established on record. The reason behind is
that if such irrelevant contradictions or discrepancies is given

much importance and are taken into consideration sole ground,
-13-

then there would be hardly any conviction in criminal cases,
which has never been the intent and purpose behind
appreciation of evidence under the criminal administration of
justice. The Apex Court in the case of “Shamsher Ahmad and

another Vs The State and others” (2022 SCMR 1931) has held

that:
“While appreciating the evidence, the
court must not attach undue importance
to minor discrepancies and such minor
discrepancies which do not shake the
salient features of the prosecution case
should be ignored. The accused cannot
claim = premium = of — such minor
discrepancies. If importance be given to
such insignificant inconsistencies then

there would hardly be any conviction.”

12. The cumulative effect of what has been stated above

leads this Court nowhere, but to hold that the prosecution has

fully succeeded in bringing home guilt against the appellant.

‘The evidence on file has properly been appreciated and the

learned trial Court, in the circumstances, was right to convict

the appellant. Icarned counsel for the appellant has failed to

point out any illegality or irregularity, or misreading or non-

reading of any material piece of evidence in the impugned
-14-

judgment, rather the record speaks otherwise and the reasons
given by the Icarned trial judge find complete support from
record of the case, as such, no interference is called for.
Consequently, the instant criminal appeal being bereft of any

merit is hereby dismissed.
