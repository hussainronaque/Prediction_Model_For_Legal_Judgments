2. The prosecution story as disclosed in the -
FIR, in brief, is that on 23.7.2004 at 19:45 hours,
complainant Zahir Shah (PW-8), and cousin Syed
Badshah (PW-9) brought the dead body of his brother
Itwar Shah to police station Mullazai, where he
reported the matter to the local police, to the effect
that on eventful day he alongwith his said brother and
cousin had gone to look-afler their landed property
situated within limits of Kirri Khazani; that his brother
was preparing protection Band with stones, at about
Deegar Wela, absconding co-accused Fazal Shah,
armed with 3x3 bore rifle, while the accused/appellant
Hayatullah, armed with Kalashnikov came there and
started firing at his brother with the intention to do
him away, as a result whereof, he got hit, fell to the
ground and died on the spot; that one Raheem Gul
came there for their rescue, however, he was also fired
at by accused Khan Gul and Gulap, standing nearby,
as a result whereof, he got injured on his right foot.
After commission of the occurrence, the accused fled
away from the spot. Besides the complainant, the
occurrence was stated to be witnessed by said Raheem
Gul. Motive for the offence was stated 10 be previous
blood-feud. He charged the accused for the

commission of offence.

-3-

3, It is pertinent to mention that after
commission of the offence, the accused went into
hiding, therefore, they were proceeded against under
section 512, Cr.P.C. and consequently they were
declared proclaimed offenders by learned trial Court
vide order dated 09.12.2006. On arrest of the accused,
supplementary challan against them was submitted
before the trial Court, however, vide order dated
13.02.2019, co-accused Khan Gul and Gulap Khan
were acquitted on the basis of compromise, as they
were charged only for effective firing at Raheem Gul
(subsequently passed away in some other incident). At
the commencement of trial against the
accused/appellant, the prosecution produced and
examined as many as twelve (12) witnesses,
whereaficr, statement of the accused under section
342 Cr.P.C, was recorded wherein he professed
innocence and false implication, however, neither he
wished to be examined under section 340(2) Cr.P.C,
nor opted to produce defence evidence. The learned
trial after hearing arguments, convicted the appellant
and sentenced him, as mentioned above, which has
been assailed by the appellant through the instant
criminal appeal.

4. We have heard the learned counsel for the

appellant, the Icarned State Counsel assisted by
-4-

learned private counsel for the complainant at length
and with their able assistance, the record was scanned.
5. Though the learned trial Court passed a
guilty verdict, yet this being the appellate Court is
under the bounden duty to assess and re-assess the
available evidence on the file and to appreciate as to
whether the learned trial Court was correct in its
approach by convicting the appellant. In order to
ascertain as to whether the impugned judgment is
based on proper reasoning and that the learned trial
Court correctly applied its judicial mind to the facts
and circumstances of the case keeping in view the
evidence available on the file, so we deem it essential
to thrash out the evidence so as to avoid miscarriage
of justice.

6. The prosecution is under obligation to
convince this Court regarding the mode, manner and
the time of incident, and the complainant as well as
the eyewitness, being closely related to the deceased,
are to establish their presence on the spot and this
Court has to scrutinize as to whether the incident

occurred in the mode, manner and at the stated time.

Ts It is the case of prosecution that the
complainant alongwith his deceased brother and

cousin Syed Badshah (PW-9) had gone to look-after
|
|

-

-5-

their landed property where his brother was preparing -
protection Band with stones, meanwhile, at about
Deegar Wela, absconding co-accused Fazal Shah,
armed with 3x3 bore rifle, while the
accused/appellant, armed with a Kalashnikov came
there and started firing at his brother with the intention
to commit his gatl-i-amd, as a result whereof, he got
hit, fell 10 the ground and died on the spot; that one
Raheem Gul attracted to the spot for their rescue,
however, he was also fired at by accused Khan Gul
and Gulap, standing nearby, as a result whercof, he
got injured on his right foot. In the present case, the
ocular account of the incident was furnished by the
complainant, who was examined as PW-8 and Syed
Badshah, who was examined as PW-9. We are
conscious of the fact that no doubt mere relationship
of a witness could not be a ground to discard his
evidence, however, testimony of such witness is to be
scrutinized with great care and caution, especially the
same should not be relicd upon, without
corroboration, for sustaining conviction on a capital
charge. To begin with, complainant was examined
before the trial Court as PW-8, who although
reiterated same story as narrated in the FIR, however,
he also added that on the following day of the

occurrence the local police came to the spot and they
©)

-6-

were waiting for arrival of the dead body when the-
local police came and they went to the spot where
blood-stained earth from the place of deceased and
injured was secured coupled with collection of five
empties of 7.62 bore from the place of the appellant
and were sealed into parcel by the Investigating
Officer and that he spent 2 to 2:30 hours on the spot
with the Investigating Officer, however, the above
deposition is belied by Sabir Shah S.J (PW-3), who
stated during cross-examination that the complainant
and eyewitness were present with them when they
proceeded from police station to the spot. Although he
is a tractor driver by profession and used wrist watch
as admitted by him and rightly so, because during the
days of occurrence wrist watch was essential for a
tractor driver to note working time i.e. ploughing etc,
however, despite thal no specific time of occurrence
was mentioned in the report lodged by the
complainant, rather it was mentioned as Deegar Wela.
This witness admitted that in his report he did not
mention the time of departure from their house to their
landed property. According to his deposition, at the
time of occurrence, left side of the deceased was
towards the accused. If we accept this deposition of
the complainant, in such eventuality, same is belied by

the statement of Medical Officer (PW-7), who
t)

afffle

although observed first entry wounds on left shoulder -
joint with its exit wound on right axilla, however,
entry No.2 is on medial aspect of right forearm. It is in
the statement of the complainant that the dead body
remained on the spot for about 25/30 minutes after the
occurrence, whereafter, Rasool Khan, Mashal Khan
and so many other persons attracted to the spot,
amongst whom, Niaz Gul arranged cot while the
Datsun pickup was arranged by his co-villagers for
shifting the injured and the dead body, however, these
facts were not narrated by him in the first information
report. Although he stated that afler lodging the
report, the dead body was brought to civil hospital,
Tank and Nasceb Jan and Umar Daraz also
accompanied the dead body, whereas he and his
cousin Syed Badshah (PW-9) lefi the police station
and proceeded to their village on foot, however, this
deposition is not appealable to a man of prudence,
firstly because there was no reason why he did not
accompany the dead body of his brother to the
hospital, rather than going to his house and secondly,
his deposition is belicd by the statement Aziz Khan,
his own father, examined before the trial Court as
PW-11, who stated that mother of the deceased and
Zahir Shah accompanied the dead body to the police

station for lodging the report. The question arises that
-8-

when the complainant, being brother of the deceased
and father of the deceased were available, then what
prompted the mother to accompany the dead body to
police station for report. In this respect, cross-
examination of Haroon Rasheed 8.1. (PW-12) is worth
perusal, who chalked out the FIR and also conducted
investigation in the present case. According to his
deposition, the dead body and injured were sent to
civil hospital, Tank, under the escort of constable,
while the complainant remained with them in the
police station, wherefrom he alongwith the
complainant and other police Nafri proceeded to the
spot at about 8:05 PM and reached there at about 9:00
PM, which belies the statement complainant, who
stated that after lodging the report, he alongwith
alleged eyewitness proceeded to their house on foot.
The only inference which could be drawn therefrom is
that neither the complainant nor father of the deceased
were available to accompany the dead body of
deceased to the police station for reporting the matter.
Moreover, the factum of deccased’s mother going to
the police station appears to be a true and voluntary
account of the occurrence that other prosecution
witnesses had deliberatcly tried to conceal. It is also
pertinent to mention here that autopsy on the dead

body of deceased was conducted on following day of
«9.

occurrence i.e. on 24.7.2004 at 8:00 AM. At very
inception of cross-examination, the Medical Officer
(PW-7) was specifically questioned by the defence,
who replied that, “Ji is correct that I have not fill up
the column regarding the “body brought by”. He
explained that the dead body was brought on
23.7.2004, however, he had not mentioned the time of
arrival of the dead body. The only inference which
could be drawn from the above is that the postmortem
was delayed to procure attendance of the complainant
and the alleged eyewitness.

In case titled “Mian Sohail Ahmed _and
others Vs. The State and others” (2019 SCMR
956), it was held by the Apex Court that:-

“According to the Doctor (PW-10), who
did the post-mortem examination, the
dead-body of the deceased was brought to
the mortuary at [1:15 a.m. on 01.9.2006
and the post-mortem examination took
place at 12 noon after a delay of 15
hours. This delay in the post-mortem
examination, when the occurrence was
prompily reported at 8:45 p.m. and formal
FIR was registered at 9.00 p.m. on
31.8.2006 gives rise to an inference that
the incident was not reported as stated by
the prosecution”.

In another case reported as “Muhammad
Rafique alias Feeq Vs. The State” (2019 SCMR
1068), it was held by the Honourable Supreme Court
of Pakistan that:-

“When the Additional Prosecutor General
and learned counsel for the complainant
©)

-10-

were confronted to explain the marked
delay in carrying out the post mortem of
Muhammad Azam, they were unable to
point out any justifiable reason for the
same in the entire record. Such
unexplained delay in the post mortem of a
deceased would surely put a prudent mind
on guard to very cautiously assess and
scrutinize the prosecution's evidence. In
such circumstances, the most natural
inference would be that the delay so
caused was for preliminary investigation
and prior consultation to nominate the
accused and plant eye-witnesses of the
crime. In similar circumstances, this
Court, in the case of Irshad Ahmad v.
The State (2011 SCMR 1190), observed
that the noticeable delay in post mortem
examination of the dead body is generally
suggestive of a real possibility that time
had been consumed by the police in
procuring and planting eye-witnesses
before preparing police papers necessary
for the same. This view has been followed
by this court in Ulfat Husain vy. The State
(2018 SCMR 313), Muhammad Yaseen v.
Muhammad Afzal and another (2018
SCMR 1549), Muhammad Rafique v. The
State (2014 SCMR 1698), Muhammad
Ashraf vy. The State (2012 SCMR 419)
and Khalid alias Khalidi and 2 others v.
The State (2012 SCMR 327)”.

Besides the above, testimony of
complainant is also belied by PW-11, who stated that
Itwar Shah deceased first went to the landed
property/place of occurrence without being
accompanied by the complainant. According to him,
as he was not present in the house, therefore, he could
not say that the complainant went to the place of
occurrence after the occurrence.

The second alleged eyewitness, namely

Syed Badshah was examined as PW-9, who although
ta)

-ll-

reiterated same story as narrated in the FIR, however, °
according to him, first he reached the place of
occurrence/landed property, whereas the complainant
reached there after 5/10 minutes of his arrival. This
deposition is contradicted by the report as well as
statement of the complainant, wherein it has been
stated that the deceased and PW-9 had accompanied
the complainant to their fields. He admitted that at the
lime of report, he was present outside the police
station. After lodging the report, he alongwith the
complainant did not accompany the dead body to the
hospital, rather returned to their village from police
station, which is not appealable to a prudent mind.
The question arises that if this witness had
accompanied the dead body to police station, then in
such eventuality, afier lodging the report in police
station, he should have accompanied the dead body to
the hospital. Even he was unable to disclose the names
of co-villagers who brought the cot to the spot. Even
he was not in a position to tell that who arranged the
Datsun pickup for shifling the dead body. He
disclosed that aficr the occurrence Raees Khan and
Zakam Khan attracted to the spot, while the
complainant never stated so. Surprisingly, he stated
that they reached to police station for lodging the

report at about 5:30/6:00 PM, which is contradictory
-12-

to the statement of complainant, who stated to have ,
reached the police station at Sham Vela. Even
otherwise, the occurrence allegedly occurred on 23"
of July and in the said month evening falls at about
7:30 PM, while the time mentioned by this witness is
almost before Asar prayers. This particular aspect of
the case is sufficient to conclude that his statement
was not reliable. According to him, he remained in
police station for one and half hour in connection with
lodging the report, however, same is also
contradictory to the statement of complainant, who
stated that they remained in the police station for
about forty minutes and thereafter lefi for their village.
It is also surprising that according to this witness, he
and the complainant did not try to run away at the
time of occurrence and kept sitting at their respective
places. Again, this deposition is contradicted by the
complainant, who stated that at the time of firing, he
alongwith this PW were standing without doing any
work. According to him, the firing lasted for thirty
(30) minutes, whereas the complainant stated that the
same continued only for five minutes. Thus, in view
of the above discussion, when the very presence of
the eye-witnesses is doubtful, then the veracity of

their testimony would surely fall short of credence
-13-

to saddle capital punishment upon the present

appellant.

In case titled “Abdul Jabbar and another

Vs. The State” (2019 SCMR 129), it has been held

that:-

“At the cost of reiteration, it has been
observed by us that, in a case, where
the learned appellate court, after
reappraisal of entire evidence available
on record, has reached the conclusion
that there is unexplained delay in
lodging the FIR; the presence of eye-
witnesses is not established; there are
irreparable dents in the case of the
prosecution; the recovery is ineffective
and is of no consequence; the ocular
account is belied by the medical
evidence; the motive behind the
occurrence is far from being proved
and almost non-existent, the said Court
fell in gross error in maintaining the
conviction of _ the appellants
particularly on a capital charge”.

In this respect, reliance can also be placed

on the case law reported as “Muhammad Ibrahim

Vs. Ahmed Ali and others” (2010 SCMR 638) and
“Mansab Ali Vs. The State” (2019 SCMR 1306).

8. So far as recoverics are concerned, same
were allegedly effected from the spot on the following
day of occurrence, however, there is nothing on record
that afier the occurrence till the time of spot
inspection, the spot was secured by the Investigating
Officer, despite the fact that as per statement of
Investigating Officer he visited the spot on the day of

occurrence. In this view of the matter, presence of the
-14-

alleged empties without being disturbed over night ~
also creates serious doubts about its recovery. Moreso,
same being corroborative picce of evidence could not
outweigh the ocular account, which has already been
disbelieved by us in the preceding paragraphs.
Needless to mention that the crime empties were
allegedly sent to the I'SL, however, report in that
regard is not available on file. Even the Moharrir
concerned was not examined before the trial Court to
testify about sending of crime empties to the FSL for
expert opinion. Moreso, in the present case, no
recovery was effected from the convict/appellant.

9. The prosecution alleged motive to be
previous blood-feud between the parties, however, it
did not succeed in establishing the alleged motive and
even no independent witness was produced in that
respect. The prosecution, in all circumstances was to
prove the same. In this view of the matter, when the

prosecution did not succeed in establishing the
motive, then it is for the prosecution to suffer, as is
held in case titled "Hakim Ali Vs. The State" (1971
SCMR-432), that the prosecution though not called
upon to establish motive in every case, yet once it has
sclup a motive and failed to establish, the prosecution

must suffer consequences and not the defence. The
2 [5S=
above view has been reiterated in the case of "Amin :
Ullah Vs. The State" (PLD 1976 SC 629), wherein, it
has been observed by their lordships, that motive is an
important constituent and if found by the Court to be
untruc, the Court should be on guard to accept the
prosecution story. It was again re-enforced by the
august Supreme Court in the case of “Muhammad
Sadig Vs. Muhammad Sarwar” (1997 SCMR 214).
Again, on the same principle, case laws titled

“Noor Muhammad Vs. The State and another”

(2010 SCMR 997) and “Amin Ali_and another Vs.
The State” (2011 SCMR-323) can also be referred,

10. It was highly agitated, that right from the
day of incident till his arrest, the appellant remained in
hiding with no plausible explanation. It was submitted
that the long unexplained abscondence alone was
sufficient to convict the appellant. Be that as it may,
there is no cavil with the proposition that abscondence
is not a substantive picce of evidence, rather it is a
circumstance that can be taken into consideration, that
too, when the prosecution succeeds in bringing home
guilt against the accused by producing convincing

evidence, but in the instant case the situation is

- 16-
altogether different, so the abscondence alone cannot
be taken into consideration to convict the appellant,
that too, for awarding capital punishment.

11. There is no two opinion about the fact
that the cardinal principle of justice always laid
emphasis on the quality of evidence which must be of
first degree and sufficient enough to dispel the
apprehension of the Court with regard to the
implication of innocent persons alongwith guilty one
by the prosecution, otherwise, the golden principle of
justice would come into play that even a single doubt
if found reasonable would be sufficient to acquit the
accused, giving him/them benefit of doubt because
bundle of doubts are not required to extend the legal
benefit to the accused. In this regard, reliance is

placed on a view held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court

in case titled Riaz Masih alias Mithoo Vs. State (NLR
L995 Cr.SC 694).

12. The overall impact of what has been
discussed above is that the prosecution has
miserably failed to cstablish the case against the
appellants, otherwise to extend benefit of doubt so
many circumstanccs arc nol required to be brought

forth. In this regard, guidance is sought from a
-]7-

judgment reported as “Tariq Pervez Vs. The State” °
(1995 SCMR 1345), wherein it has been held that:-
“The concept of benefit of doubt to any
accused person is deep rooted in our
country. For giving him benefit of doubt,
it is not necessary that there should be
many circumstances creating doubts. If
there is a circumstance which creates
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind
about the guilt of the accused, then the
accused will be entitled to the benefit not
as a matter of grace and concession but
as a matter of right”.
13. For what has been discussed above, the
instant criminal appeal is allowed, the impugned
judgment is sct aside, consequently, the appellant is
acquitted of the charges levelled against him. He shall
be released forthwith, if not required to be detained in
connection with any other criminal case.

14. Above are the detailed reasons of our short

order of even date.
