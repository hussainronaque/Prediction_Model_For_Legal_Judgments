JUDGMENT

SYED ARSHAD ALI, J:- This consolidated judgment is
aimed at deciding the instant petition as well as connected
petitions, details whereof have been provided in Annexure ‘A’
to this judgment, as essentially adjudication of common
questions of law and facts are involved in all the petition.

Writ Petition No. 1521-P & 4255-P/2021

2. Brief facts as narrated in the petitions are that the

petitioners are qualified Category B Pharmacists/Dispensers
and Category C Apprentices who have been running their
medical stores for the last 20/30 years under licences regularly
renewed till 2017. Petitioners contend that when they applied
to the respondents, their applications were turned down citing
as ground the impugned amendments in the NWFP Drugs
Rules 1982 through notification dated 09.05.2017. They
further allege that in a meeting following protests against the
rejection of applications for renewal, the then Chief minister
and Health minister on 24/05/18 agreed to arrange an

examination for the applicants to be conducted by Provincial
2
Pharmacy Council, which, if qualified, would entitle them for

receipt of license under Category B . They add that despite the
above assurance the respondents never conducted the exam as
promised, and consequently, did not renew licenses of the
applicants. Petitioners have prayed for renewal of licenses,
striking down of KPK Drug Rules, 2017, and for leave to the
applicants to appear in the exam to be conducted by Provincial
Pharmacy Council.

WP No. 926-M/2018 & WP No. 88-M/2020

3. Petitioners in this petition run drug retail stores in

Malakand division. They are holders of category C license;
they pray for striking down Notification dated 09.05.2017 to
the extent of serial No. 7 (e) whereby rule 18(1) along with
Form No. 8(B) being ultra vires the Constitution.

Writ Petition No. 927-M/2018

4. Petitioners have drug retail stores in Malakand under a

Category C license. It is alleged that their shops were recently
raided for non-renewal of licenses, and despite the fact that of
their applications for renewal being pending, their shops were
sealed. Aggrieved with the actions of the respondents, they
seek a writ of mandamus directing the respondents into
renewal of their licenses.

Writ Petition No. 2852-P/2018

5. It is purported/alleged that Petitioners No. 1 to 5 are

holders of degree of Bachelor of Pharmacy from the
recognized universities whereas petitioner No.6 is Association
duly registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860,
however, they have filed the instant petition with the

following prayer:-

“It is, therefore, humbly prayed that on acceptance of
this writ petition, this honorable court may declare, hold
and direct:-

I That paragraph 2 and paragraph 3 in rules
introduce by virtue of notification No. SO (Drug)
HD/2-43/2018 dated 10.05.2018 and further
amendments in vide Notification No. So
(Drugs)/HD/2-43/2018 dated 04.10.2019 are
patently illegal, without lawful authority, in excess of
sa:

3

jurisdiction and based on malafide, therefore, not
sustainable.

IL That the amendments proposed and/or made in rule
18 adding proviso is patently in negation of the spirit
of the act and respondents cannot be allowed to
make such amendments illegally and unlawfully.

III. That the amendments made in the rules will destroy
the main object of the act, therefore, liable to be
declared unlawful and of no legal effect.

IV. That the petitioners have been condemned unheard
and the notification dated 10.05.2018 & 04.10.2019
have been issued and notified in negation of article
10-A of Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan
therefore, not binding upon the right upon the right
of the petitioners.

V. Any other appropriate remedy not specifically
prayed for may also be granted deemed appropriate
in the circumstances by this honorble court”.

Writ Petition No. 323-M/2020

6. The petitioners, who allegedly run their medical stores
at different parts District Swat, have approached this Court
through the instant petition with the prayer to declare the
petitioners entitled to run their medical stores under the
customary ‘Riwaji’ licenses issued on Form-9 Rule 15(1) of
Drug Rules, 1982 and to issue necessary mandamus to the
respondents for renewing their current licences.

Writ Petition No. 89-M/2020

7. The petitioners, who allegedly/purportedly run their

medical stores at different parts of District Swat and holders of
licences under Category-C, have approached this Court with
the prayer to declare them entitled to run their medical stores
under the current category by issuing necessary mandamus to
the respondents for renewal of their current licences.

8. The precise assertions of the learned counsels for the
petitioners in these cases are that the practice of Pharmacy is
regulated through Pharmacy Act, 1967 (“Act of 1967”).
While referring to section 25 of the Act of 1967, the learned
counsels have argued that the qualification for registration as
Pharmacist or as an apprentice in pharmacy has been
acknowledged and recognized under the Act of 1967 and one
of the qualifications is that the person, who passed the

examination in pharmacy held by the Provincial Council can
4
be registered with the Provincial Council, therefore they have

the right to practice the business of pharmacy. On the dint of
such qualification they were issued licences for sale of drugs
at their retail point through rule-18 of the then NWFP Drug
Rules, 1982 (“Rules, 1982”); However, through the impugned
amendment in the Rules, of 1982, the persons who have not
passed the examination in pharmacy held by a Provincial
Council as provided under section 25 (c) of the Act of 1967
have been barred to deal in the sale of life saving drugs and
thus the effect of the said rules is that the licence issued to the
petitioners were not renewed.

9. To sum up the contention of the learned counsels for the
petitioners; once under the Rules, 1982 license is granted then
subsequently a subsequent amendment in the Rules cannot
deprive the license holders of their right to do and enter the
lawful business which is one of their fundamental rights
guaranteed through Article 18 of the Constitution of Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (“Constitution”).

10. On the other hand, the worthy AAG along with
representative have argued that the amendment to the rules
was made only after all relevant stakeholders had been
consulted, and after they had ascribed their approval to it in
wider public interest. The learned AAG has also stated that the
amendment in the rules was made pursuant to the direction of
the superior courts including this Court as well as the Apex
Court wherein the Governments were directed to frame
comprehensive rules/regulations to deal with the menace of
sale and availability of spurious/ substandard drugs, besides,
the qualification of the persons, who are dealing with the said
business.

11. Arguments heard and record perused.

12. The matter regulating the subject of practice of
pharmacy is being governed under the Act of 1967. The Act of
1967 provides for establishment of the Pharmacy Council at

Centre (section 4) and the Provincial Council of Pharmacy
+)

(section 5). It is one of the obligation of the Provincial Council
to prepare and maintain Registers of Pharmacists and
Apprentices in Pharmacy and to register Pharmacists and grant
certificates of registration, beside, to conduct examinations for
the purpose of registration as Pharmacists (section 23). Section
24 of the Act of 1967 deals with preparation and maintenance
of Registers by the Provincial Council; whereas qualification
for registration as a Pharmacist or as an Apprentice in
Pharmacy is provided under section 25 of the Act of 1967.

Relevant provisions of the Act of 1967 read as under: -

24, Preparation and maintenance of Registers.-
(1) The Provincial Council prepare or cause to be
prepared and maintained the following Registers of
Pharmacists and apprentices for the Province,
namely:-

(a) Register A- in which shall be registered the
persons specified in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of
section 25;

(b) Register B- in which shall be registered the
persons specified in clauses (b) and (c) of the said
sub-section; and

(c) Register C- in which shall be registered the
apprentices in pharmacy;

Provided that the Provincial Council may,
with the previous approval of the Provincial
Government, discontinue the registration of
apprentices in pharmacy an may, with like approval
re-open such registration after it has been
discontinued and shall, upon such discontinuance or
re-opening, publish in the official gazette a notice
there of specifying the date of such discontinuance
or re-opening.

(2) Every Register prepared and maintained
under sub-section (1) shall include the following
particulars relating to a person registered, namely:
(a) full name;

(b) residential address;

(c) professional address;

(d) father’s name;

(e) date and place of birth;

(63) nationality;

(g) qualification;

(h) date on which registered; and

(i) such other particulars as may be prescribed
by bye-laws.

25. Qualifications for registration as a pharmacist
or as an apprentice in pharmacy.— (1) The
following persons shall, subject to the provision of
sub-section (3), be qualified for registration as
pharmacists under this Act, namely:—

(a) persons who hold a degree in pharmacy conferred
by a University or an institution affiliated thereto,
6

where the degree is recognised by the Central
Council;

(b) persons who hold a diploma in pharmacy granted
by any institution recognised by the Central Council;
and

(c) persons who pass the examination in pharmacy
held by a Provincial Council

13. However, import, export, manufacturer, store,
distribution and sale of drugs is governed by the Drugs Act,
1976 (“Act of 1976”). Section 6 of the Act of 1976 is relevant
to the present controversy, which reads as under:-

6. Regulation of sale of drugs.-The Provincial
Governments shall regulate the sale of drugs in the
prescribed manner and may for that purpose make
such orders, and issue such directions to the
importers, manufacturers, stockists, retailers or
other dealers of drugs, as they may deem fit.

14. Similarly, section 44 of the Act of 1976 empowers the
Provincial Government to make rules, inter alia, to provide the
conditions to regulate sale or storage or distribution of drugs
or any specific drug class of drugs, and also for the form of
licences for the sale or distribution of drugs. In exercise of its
mandate under section 44 ibid, the Provincial Government
framed rules known as NWFP (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa)
Drug Rules, 1982. Part-II of the said rules relates to the type
of licences to sale the drugs and the licensing authority.
According to rule-12 the Secretary to Government of Health
Department is the licensing authority whereas the types of the
licences are as follows:-

(i) Licence to sell drugs by way of retail
sale;

(ii) Licence to sell drugs by way of
wholesale;

(iii) Licence to sell narcotics; and

(iv) Licence to sell drugs in a pharmacy.

15. Further under rule-17 it is envisaged that the licences
stated above are to be issued for the period of two years. The

pre-condition for issuance of licence is provided under
7
rule-18. Relevant to the present controversy is the un-amended

rule-18(2), which reads as under:-

18. Pre-conditions of the issue of licence.-

(2) The sale of drugs shall be supervised----

(a) Under licence ii Form 9 or Form I] by a person-

(i) Who registered under section 24(1) (a) and (b) of
the Pharmacy Act, 1967 (XI of 1967) or

(ii) Who was approved as qualified person for grant
of drug sales licence under the West Pakistan
Drug Rules 1958 or

(iii)who was on the 19" day of June, 1972 qualified
for registration under section 24 (1) (b) of
pharmacy Act 1967 (XI of 1976); or

(iv) Who has before the commencement of these rules
passed the examination, of compounder or
dispenser and has completed two years period of
apprenticeship under section 24(1)( c ) of the
Pharmacy Act, 1967

(b) Under license in Form 10 by a person

(i) who fulfils the conditions laid down in clause (a),
or

(ii) Who has been a student or apprentice in
pharmacy under clause (iii) of sub-section (2) of
section 25 of the Pharmacy Act, 1967 (XI of
1967);

Provided that this provision shall be applicable after

2 years of the commencement of these rules;

(c) under licence in Form 12 by a person who is
registered as pharmacist under section 24 (1) (a)
of Pharmacy Act, 1967 (XI of 1967) or by a
person who is registered under section 24 (1) (b)
of Pharmacy Act, 1967 (XI of 1967) and
possesses at least 3 years experience in
compounding.

16. The present controversy stems from the notification
dated 09.05.2017 issued under section 44 of the Act, 1976
whereby rule-18 was amended. The amendment which is
germane to the present controversy is rule-18 (1) (¢) which

reads as under:-

7. For rule 18, the following shall be substituted,
namely:

(1) The Licensing authority shall not issue
licences, unless,-

(G) vee ee cee ese ee cee ee cones nents nen ene dee ene rene nee ene nee tee es

(e) in case of Pharmacy and distribution, the
proprietor has appointed a person registered under
clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 24 of the
Pharmacy Act, 1967 (XI of 1967) while in case of
medical store a qualified person registered under
8

clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (1) of section 24 of
the Pharmacy Act, 1967, to personally supervise the
sale of drugs;

17. One of the effect of the said amendment is that
apprentices as defined under section 24 (c) who were
previously entitled to a licence to manage a medical store,
are/were excluded from the category of individuals qualified
to obtain a license for the business of sale of drugs, a condition
precedent. .

18. It is the precise contention of the petitioners that since
before the amendment in the Rules, 1982, they were doing a
lawful trade/business; hence, they have a vested right in terms
of Article 18 of the Constitution to continue with this business
and that the said right cannot be taken away from the
petitioners through the impugned amendment in the rules.

19. The rule of 2017, as stated above, in rule-12 envisages
for different kinds of licences entitling them to do the business
of sale of drugs at a retail point/pharmacy and the effect of
amendment is that they would not be entitled to renewal of
licence as by the amended rules they are not qualified to
conduct the business of sale of drugs in the pharmacy.

20. Undoubtedly, Article 18 of the Constitution guarantees
rights to the citizen to enter upon any lawful profession or
occupation and to conduct any lawful trade or business but the
said right is not unqualified as Article 18 starts with the word
subject to such a “qualification”, if any. Moreover, the proviso
attached to the article clearly empowers the legislature to
regulate any trade or business and it is always assumed that
such regulations may be by license.

21. The meaning connotation of the word ‘licence’ cannot
be expanded beyond a mere a privilege as it is not a right in its
strict sense. Explaining the concept Justice Retd Fazal Karim
notes: “The ordinary dictionary meaning of expression
‘licence’ as contained in the Concise Oxford Dictionary is:

“permit from government ete to marry, print something,
9
preach, carry on some trade (especially that in alcoholic

liquor) etc”.

22. The definition and general nature of a licence is thus
stated at page-32 of the 33% Vol. of the American
Jurisprudence: “in its specific sense, to licence means to
confer on a person the right to do something which otherwise
he would not have the right to do. A licence is in the nature of
a special privilege rather than a right common to all and is
often required as a condition precedent to the right to carry on
business or to hold certain classes of property within the
jurisdiction”.!

23. A similar question arose before the Apex Court in the
case of Zamir Ahmad Khan”. The facts of the case were that
section 3(1) of Act No. XXXIX of 1950 confers power upon
the Federal Government to prohibit, restrict or otherwise
control, the import and export of goods of any specified
description. The issue in that case was that the cinematograph
films was an importable item in the free list which could be
imported by private persons, however, in the manner as
provided under the Act which, inter alia, included the
licensing system. The respondent in the case had applied for a
licence for certain cinematograph films which were borne on
the free list and deposited certain amount for that purpose,
however, before the proper licence could be issued, an
amendment was introduced in the Import Policy on
09.08.1972 and the effect of the said amendment was that
from the date of amendment, cinematograph films could be
imported from abroad only through an official agency to be
named by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and
private importers were disqualified form importing the same.
As a result of the said amendment, the Licensing Authority
declined to authenticate the licence in favour of the

respondent. It was the claim of the respondent that by applying

2 Government of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Commerce and
another vs. Zamir Ahmad Khan (PLD 1975 Supreme Court 667)
aa

10
for licence and depositing the required fee, a vested and

fundamental right had accrued in his favour which could not
be taken away through the said amendment. In this
background regarding the meaning of the licence, it was
observed by the Apex Court that it is well settled that in
generality of cases, licence (simpliciter) is a privilege and not
a legal right; much less there is a legal duty for its grant.
Therefore, exceptional cases apart, mandamus would not issue
in such cases. Speaking generally in such cases the emphasis
is on policy, and any discretion vesting in the authorities is
directed towards attaining the policy objective. In the

concluding paragraph, the Apex Court had observed that:

“In the instant case, as already pointed out,
section 3(1) of the 1950 Act reserves to the
Central Government power of the widest
amplitude to prohibit, restrict or otherwise
control the import of goods. What goods are
to be imported, how and in what quantities
and by whom they are to be imported are all
questions of policy to be laid down by the
Federal Government. Indeed, the
Government has all along since the inception
of the Act, frequently and materially altered
import policies. These policies, availability of
foreign exchange and multitudes of other
factors of which the Federal Government is
the sole arbiter in exercise of its executive
authority. The decision taken, falls within the
realm of policy making. These policy
decisions are binding on the subordinate
administrative authorities as a matter of duty.
In all such cases, orders made must conform
to the policy decisions of the Government.
The amendment made on 10.8.1972 in item
No. 49 signified a change in policy and the
respondent was informed that he was being
refused licence because of “the change in
policy” and not because of any other reason.
On these facts, it is not possible to subscribe
to the proposition that a writ of mandamus
would like against the Licensing Authority
which would have the effect of defeating the
policy, competently made by the Federal
Government. Accordingly, I would answer
the second question on which leave was
granted, also in the negative”.
11
24. The leading American authority on the point is what is

known as Slaughterhouse cases’

in which a challenge to a
Louisiana legislation of 1869 to clean up the Mississippi River
was repelled. The legislation was aimed at preventing the
pollution and the resulting contamination of the city’s water
supply. The Act prohibited all landing and slaughtering of
livestock in the city or surrounding parishes except at one
large slaughterhouse which was granted an exclusive franchise
for 25 years. The Act also established maximum rates to be
charged for the land and slaughtering of livestock a group of
small independent slaughterers which had been displaced by
the legislation challenged the Act on the ground that it
violated the 13" and 14 Amendments in taking away their
livelihood. The court rejected any notion that the butchers’
right to practise their profession constituted one of the
privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States
alleged to be protected from state infringement by the 14"
amendment.

25. In Ganapati’s case’, it was held that if there is a grant,
revocation or withholding of a licence or a permit for the
carrying on of a trade, business or profession, such law can be
challenged as violative of fundamental right, however, at the
same time, it was observed by the Indian Supreme Court in the
case of Cooverji> that the said right will not apply to trade or
business which is inherently dangerous to the community and
which the state is entitled either to prohibit entirely or to
permit only under such condition as will minimise harm likely
to cause from such enterprises. Therefore, the running and
carrying on of a business under a license system does not
confer upon a licensee the right to continue with the said

business, if in the opinion of the state or government the said

5 Cooverji Vs Excise Commissioner (AIR 1954 SC 220)
12
business may endanger or is likely to endanger the public

health and safety.

26. In the present cases, even if we assume that on the dint
of un-amended rules, the petitioners were allowed to enter into
the trade/business of sale of drugs at the sale point on the basis
of their qualification as provided under section 25(c) of the
Act of 1967; it is the case of the respondents in their
comments that since long there was a debate regarding the
eligibility of persons holding license under category-C
(section 25) to deal with the sale of drug by way of retail. It is
further alleged that under section 2(f)° of the Act of 1967 the
petitioners holding apprentice in register-C can not be
declared as pharmacist/qualified person , therefore, grant of
licence to a person registered in category-C ibid is against the
provisions of Act of 1967. It is further explained in the
comments that Drugs Rules framed in 1982 were considered
grossly deficient as it does not provide explanation of
important segment to cope with present scenario and
challenges. It has been observed on various occasions not only
by Provincial Quality Control Board (PQCB) while
scrutinizing case of Drug Inspector but this Court too has
issued directive for necessary tweaking of existing law to
ensure quality of drugs available for retail. The Federal
Government conveyed the directions of the Supreme Court of
Pakistan Islamabad, inter alia, to the Health Department of all
the Provinces to take immediate measure to implement the Act
Plan, which was designed after series of Inter Provincial
meetings for implementation of recommendations. In the
Action Plan, it has been emphasized to amend and update the
rules to ensure the availability of safe efficacious and quality
drugs to ailing masses. In short, the amendments were
prompted by valid concerns, the Rules, 1982 were amended

with the consensus of all the stakeholders including PCDA

in register A and Register B.
13
provincial chapter before the same was notified in official

gazette. The area of amendment, inter alia, deals with the

following matter:-

i. The method of purchase from authorize agent by
retailer and is further sale is regularized to
ensure its traceability/proof of purchase.

ii, Storage and distribution of medicine are well
explained.

tii.

=

Restraining the non-qualified personnel to
supervise and carryout the sale of drugs.

iv. Restraining the manufacturers/distributors not
to sell drugs to any — unlicensed
premises/retailers to discourage the mushroom
growth of unlicensed premises.

y. Clear dimension/specification even color of the
sign board for various premises whether
medical store/pharmacy distribution are given
on the basis of qualified person who will
supervise the sale in respective premises.

vi. To ensure presence of qualified person to
supervise sale of drug to avoid the possibility of

any error/misuse.

vii.

=

Displaying original category registration on
basis of which drug sale license issued, to avoid
its renting out for grant of license to another
premises thus mitigating the chances of
duplication.

27. Thus, it appears that the amendment was brought in the
Rules, 1982 in the public interest as sale of drugs by non-
qualified person would endanger the lives of the public.

28. We have also considered the ratio of the Apex Court in
the case of Arshad Mehmood’. In the said case, the vires of
section 69(1) of the Punjab Motor Vehicles (Amendment)
Ordinance (XLVI of 1999) was challenged on the touchstone
of Article 8 and 18 of the Constitution. It was the case of
petitioners before the Apex Court that they had a permit to ply
stage carriages in different cities of the Province and the effect

of amendment in section 69-A was that section 69-A, inter

7 Arshad Mehmood and others vs. Government of Punjab through Secretary,
Transport Civil Secretariat, Lahore and others (PLD 2005 Supreme Court 193).

14
alia, envisaged for grant of a franchise to the stage carriages

with carrying capacity of 70 or more passengers by a bus
service providing and maintaining the prescribed facility on
routes in respect of which it is declared by the Government
that only a bus service of the nature referred to above shall be
allowed to obtain stage carriage thereon to the exclusion of
other stage carriages. The definition of stage carriage under
the Punjab Motor Vehicles Ordinances provided a vehicle
having the capacity of six seats except the driver for
passengers. The said provision was struck down by the Apex
Court on various grounds with directions for legislation,
however, the judgment is distinguishable for the reasons that
the impugned legislation had allowed a class of people to
monopolize the business of transport whereas in the present
case, the object of the impugned amendment is obvious
because the sale of drugs at a Pharmacy is a very sophisticated
calling for specialized scientific expertise and thus the
requirement for essential qualification for the sale of drugs.
Any person, who is not qualified in the field of pharmacy, if
allowed to sale drugs to the public at the pharmacy or sale
point, it may jeopardize health of the consumer public.

29. The impugned decision of the Provincial Government
amending the rules, in our opinion, is a policy matter of the
Province and has been made in the large interest of the people,
therefore, is a reasonable qualification prescribed by the law
for entering into a lawful trade/business. It is noteworthy that
back in 1980’s when the rules were first passed, there was a
dearth of qualified pharmacists, hence, the laxity in
qualifications for drug retail license. However, today, situation
is substantially different, and pharmacy graduates are neither
hard nor costly to find, therefore, prohibiting the carrying of
the said business by unqualified persons is in public interest
and the qualification so prescribed by the Government through

impugned legislation qualifies the test of reasonableness,
~~

15
therefore, we are not inclined to interfere in the said policy

decision of the Government.
30. Resultantly, all these writ petitions having no merit and

are accordingly dismissed.
