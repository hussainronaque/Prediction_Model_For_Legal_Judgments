SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- The State being

41/IIl of 2009 by which Javed Iqbal was
acquitted of the charge under Section 9 (c)
CNSA, has filed this acquittal appeal through

2. The prosecution story as narrated in
crime No. 42 dated 18.01.2008 registered at
Police Station Mirpur, Abbottabad Ex.PA

business of charas. On the day of occurrence
informer informed him that Javed Iqbal would

go to his Guest House from Mir Alam Town

information, complainant alongwith other
police officials rushed to the pointed place of
the informer and arranged barricade. A person
having shopping bag in his hand came there,
he was stopped, on query, he disclosed his
name to be Javed Iqbal. The shopping bag
which the said Javed Iqbal was holding in his
hand was searched, which contained chars
wrapped in the newspaper, consisting of five
packets. Each packet contained 13 slabs. The
recovered chars was weighed on the spot
which was found to be 5200 grams, 4/4 grams
chars was separated from each packet for
chemical analysis while remaining 5180 grams
was sealed into separate parcel. From the

Nokia 1600, photocopy of CNIC, phone diary,
keys, visiting cards and Rs.830/- were also
recovered. Accused was formally arrested and

alongwith other recovered items / articles.
Abdul Hafeez ASI PW-4 is the seizing officer /
recovery officer, who deposed that during
relevant day and time he alongwith police
officials was on gasht within the vicinity of Mir
Alam Town, there he received a_ spy
information to the effect that the accused is
coming from Mir Alam Town _ having
contraband and is proceeding towards his
guest house, held Nakabandi, alongwith police
officials, apprehended the accused, effected
recovery of contraband from personal

possession of the accused, which was being
carried by him in a shopping bag, the packets

2, Newspaper Ex.P-3 before the learned trial
court. Asif constable Pw-5 took the sample to
FSL through receipt Ex.Pw-5/1, after delivery
of same, returned the receipt to Moharrir of
police station Mirpur. After completion of
investigation the accused was put to trail. After

closure of prosecution witnesses, the accused
was examined under Section 342 Cr.P.C
wherein he denied the allegations put forth by
the prosecution and pleaded false implication,
however, he neither produced defence nor
wished to be examined on oath.

3. The learned trial court taking into
consideration, the evidence adduced before it,
acquitted the respondent named above by the
impugned judgment and consequently the
State has filed the acquittal appeal on the
grounds mentioned in the memorandum of the
appeal. Having admitted appeal for hearing on
16.03.2011 on the ground that the evidence
required reappraisal, bailable warrant in the
sum of Rs. 50,000/- was issued against the
respondent. Consequently, we are concerned
with State appeal No. 16 of 2010 against the
accused / respondent, namely Javed Iqbal.

4. We have heard arguments of the
learned AAG representing the State and
learned counsel for the respondent at length
and scanned the record with their valuable
assistance.

5. Before we discuss the merits of the
case, brief reference to the principles which

are always taken into consideration while
dealing with acquittal appeal, appears
necessary. In that respect it will be useful to
refer to the observations made in the case
reported as State Vs Amir Ali & others PLD
1967 Karachi 440, wherein it was held as
under:-

“We must keep in mind the basic doctrine
of the privy council reported in AIR 1934 PC
227 (2) in this connection, this findings has
been followed with approval by our
Supreme Court, thereafter, in deciding an
appeal against acquittal what is to be borne
in mind is:

i. The views of the trial judge as to
the credibility of the witnesses.

ii. The presumption of innocence in
favour of an _ accused, a
presumption certainly weakened
by the fact that he has been
acquitted at his trial.

iii. The slowness of the appellate
court in disturbing the findings of
fact arrived at trial by a judge
who had the advantage of seeing
the witnesses.

6. In setting aside an acquittal in a
case, which rested wholly on direct evidence
of witness as much importance is to be given
as in any other case, to the rule which runs
through the criminal jurisprudence of our
country as a golden thread that benefit of

every doubt must go to the accused person.
Of course, a view of facts or the conclusion
therein formed by the trial court is not binding
on the court of appeal. Equally, a conclusion
by a judge may be fairly and has formulated
grounds of doubts, which are not perverse or
wholly illogical or unreasonable, there is clear
risk of departure from this rule of benefit of the
doubt in reversing his findings. In this context,
reference may be made to the cases reported
as Abdul Majid Vs_ Superintendent
Remembrance of Legal Affairs,
Government of Pakistan PLD 1964 SC 422.
State Vs Anwar Saifullah Khan PLD 2016
SC 276 and Ghulam Sikandar and another
Vs Mamrez Khan and another PLD 1985 SC
11, wherein it was observed as under:

“However, notwithstanding the diversity of
facts and circumstances of each case,
amongst others, some of the important and
consistently followed principles can be clearly
visualized from the cited and other cases law
on the question of setting aside an acquittal

by this Court. They are as follows:

(1) In an appeal against acquittal
the Supreme Court would not on
principle ordinarily interfere and
instead would give due weight and
consideration to the findings of
Court acquitting the accused. This

approach is slightly different than
that in an appeal against conviction
when leave is granted only for the
ie-appraisement of evidence which
then is undertaken so as to see
that benefit of every reasonable
doubt should be extended to the
accused. This difference of
approach is mainly conditioned by
the fact that the acquittal carries
with it the two well-accepted
presumptions : One initial, that, till
found guilty, the accused is
innocent ; and Two that again after
the trial a Court below confirmed

the assumption of innocence.

(2) The acquitted will not carry the
second presumption and will also
thus loose the first one if on points
having conclusive effect on the end
result the Court below:

(a) Disregarded material evidence;
(b) misread such evidence;
(c)Received such evidence

illegally.

(3) In either case the well-known
principles of re-appraisement of
evidence will have to be kept in
view when examining the strength
of the views expressed by the
Court below. They will not be
brushed aside lightly on mere
assumptions keeping always in
view that a departure from the
normal __ principle must be
necessitated by obligatory

observances of some _ higher
principle as noted above and for no

other reason.

(4) The Court would not interfere
with acquittal merely because on
re-appraisal of the evidence it
comes to the conclusion different
from that of the Court acquitting the
accused provided’ both _ the
conclusions are reasonably
possible. If however, the
conclusion reached by that Court
was such that no reasonable
person would conceivably reach
the same and was impossible then
this Court would interfere in
exceptional cases on
overwhelming proof resulting in
conclusion and irresistible
conclusion ; and that too with a
view only to avoid grave
miscarriage of justice and for no
other purpose. The important test
visualized in these cases, in this
behalf was that the finding sought
to be interfered with, after scrutiny
under the foregoing searching light,
should be found wholly as artificial,

shocking and ridiculous.

7. Having dealt with the general
principles of law applicable to the 417 Cr.P.C,
we may now take up for consideration the
evidence to connect the accused with the

commission of offence.
10

8. The prosecution case as set forth in
the crime report is that the complainant Abdul
Hafeez ASI (PW-4) received an information
that the accused Javed Iqbal, owner of Lasani
Guest House is engaged in narcotic business.
He was kept under surveillance, on 18"
January, 2008, during patrolling, he received a
spy information that the accused namely
Javed Iqbal would take the huge quantity of
chars to his guest house for the purpose of
sale, on receipt of this credible information, he
alongwith police officials, Imtiaz, Fazil, Nasir
and Shamrez, who were in plain dresses,
reached at the pointed place, laid Nakabandi
there. At 12:20 PM, the accused who was
having a white colour plastic shopping bag in
his right, came there, he was stopped, who
disclosed his name as Javed Iqbal, on search
of the shopping bag, the police party
recovered five packets of chars, each packet
contained thirteen (13) cabs / cakes, in
presence of marginal witnesses of recovery
memo Ex.PW-3/1, four (04) grams of chars
was taken from each packet for chemical

analysis.
11

9. From perusal of the record it was
found that only four (04) grams of chars was
taken from the five (05) packets of chars. It
transpires from statement of PW-4 (seizing
officer) that the samples were not taken from
each slab / rod / cake and piece of recovered
substance for chemical analysis. This creates
doubts in our mind, regarding quantity
collected from each slab, cake and pieces. It is
also an admitted fact that recovery of
contraband was made on 18.01.2008, the
application for sending the samples to
chemical examiner was drawn and handed
over to Asif constable (PW-5) on the same day
as admitted by him in his cross examination,
however, it was taken by hand in Forensic
Science Laboratory, Peshawar on 23.01.2008,
no reason what so ever was given by the said
prosecution witness for retaining the samples
with him for a period of five (05) days,
therefore, the delay in taking the sample to the
laboratory is another important defect in the
prosecution case and there is nothing on
record to show that the samples of chars
remained in safe custody during intervening

period. (i.e. 18.01.2008 to 23.01.2008) which
12

makes the FSL report highly doubtful and any
doubt arises in the links of the chain of
prosecution story, the benefit of the same
must go to the accused.

10. It was mentioned in the crime report
that during patrolling the complainant received
credible information that the accused would go
to his guest house with huge quantity of chars
for the purpose of sale in bulk in pursuance
thereof Nakabandi was laid on the pointed
place of informer, however, it is a matter of
record that prosecution in support of its case
has not produced copy of Roznamcha entry of
leaving the police station for patrolling, which
defect is sufficient to knock down the entire
prosecution story as the base of the
prosecution story for proceedings for patrolling
is not supported by the documentary evidence.
In this context reliance can well be placed on
the judgment reported Qalandro alias Nazro
Vs State 1997 MLD 1632, wherein it was
observed that non-production of roznamcha /
DD report, showing departure of the police
party from police station creates serious
doubts in relation to the genuineness of the

prosecution story.
13

11. The above dicta was followed in the
case reported as Aijaz Ali Vs State 2001 YLR
1493. The production of entry of the Daily
Diary report in the instant case was more
essential to establish the case as the entry in
the Roznamcha was for specific purpose of
patrolling in pursuance thereof Nakabandi was
laid and accused was apprehended alongwith
contraband.

12 We have also noted the most
important factor of the case, which
compounded all those doubts and raised a big
question mark upon the veracity of the
prosecution’s case against the appellant was
that after allegedly recovering the chars from
possession of the accused the parcels of the
recovered substance were sealed with a
monogram reading as WK, which is neither the
abbreviation of the name of seizing officer/
recovery officer nor investigating officer. PWs
had not been able to advance any explanation
whatsoever as to why recovery officer namely
Abdul Hafeez (PW-4) had not put his own
monogram on the seals of the parcels
prepared by him and as to why he had used

the monogram of some other officer, whose
14

posting was even not shown at police station
at the relevant time.

13. Keeping in view the evidence and the
law on the point, we are of the view that the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove to
our satisfaction that the acquitted accused
before us guilty of the commission of the
offence. It may also be necessary to state that
the prosecution has not been able to show us
that the grounds on which the trial court had
based acquittal of the present accused were
unreasonable, perverse, unsound or
manifestly wrong, calling for interference.

14. In result of the above discussion, we
do not find any force in the appeal filed by the
State against Javed Iqbal acquitted accused,

therefore, the same is hereby dismissed.
