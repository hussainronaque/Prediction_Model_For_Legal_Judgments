ABDUL LATIF KHAN, J:- This appeal has been
preferred against the judgment dated 22.01.2013,
passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge-lll,
Abbottabad whereby the appellant Yousaf involved in
case FIR No.515 dated 9.7.2011 u/s 377 PPC, P.S.
Cantt: Abbottabad, was convicted and sentenced to
undergo imprisonment for life alongwith fine of
Rs.50,000/- or in default thereof to suffer further six
months SI. He was also ordered to pay compensation
of Rs.2,00,000/-(Two lac) to the complainant/victim
u/s 544-A Cr.PC, recoverable as an arrears of land
revenue however benefit of Section 382-B Cr.PC was

extended to the appellant.
2. As per prosecution case, complainant
Sami Ullah was called by the appellant being Moulvi
to the room of the mosque where he committed
carnal intercourse against the order of nature with the
complainant forcibly after tying him with a cloth.
Consequently on the report of complainant/victim
instant FIR was registered against the appellant.

3. After completion of investigation complete
challan against accused was submitted in the trial
Court where in order to prove its case against
accused, the prosecution examined 14 witnesses. At
conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court convicted
and sentenced the appellant vide impugned judgment
hence the instant Criminal appeal has been preferred
by the appellant/convict for his acquittal.

Arguments hear and record perused.

4. The evidence on the record shows that
the case against the appellant has been proved
beyond any shadow of doubt as the statements of all
the P.Ws being in line with each other are not only
credible but also inspire confidence which is duly
supported by the medical evidence. All the

prosecution witnesses were lengthy cross examined
by defence but nothing beneficial towards the
appellant was brought out from their mouths.
Defence has brought nothing on the record which
could show that the testimony of the P.Ws was
motivated by any ill will or hostility. Therefore, we
have no hesitation to maintain the conviction
recorded by the learned trial Court.

5. So far as sentence awarded to the
appellant/convict is concerned, punishment for the
offence u/s 377 PPC is imprisonment for life or
with imprisonment of either description for a term
which shall not be less than two years nor more
than ten years and shall also be liable to fine. The
learned trial Court while convicting the appellant
considered the first portion of section 377 PPC but
ignored the other portion wherein punishment more
than 10 years cannot be awarded to an accused.
Besides, appellant is a young boy of 23/24 years,
being first offender having no record/previous history
of involvement/conviction in such like offence
therefore, the sentence awarded to the appellant is
harsh in nature. The sentence should be neither so

severe that the offenders, could, out of frustration,
become desperate and hardened criminals, nor
should it be so mild that it encourage the offenders to
commit the offence again therefore we, in the
circumstances of the case, when the appellant has
spent almost 4 years in Jail, would like to reduce his
sentence of imprisonment for life to 5 years R.I and
the fine of Rs.50,000/- to Rs.25,000/- or in default to
undergo one month S.I| whereas the judgment of
learned trial Court to the extent of payment of
compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- u/s 544-A Cr.PC, to
the complainant/victim is set aside.

With the modification hinted to above, this
appeal is disposed of.

Announced.
