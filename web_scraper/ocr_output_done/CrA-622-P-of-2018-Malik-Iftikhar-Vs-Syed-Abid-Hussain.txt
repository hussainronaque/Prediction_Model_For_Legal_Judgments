JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, _J.-_ This
criminal appeal is directed against the
judgment dated 13.06.2018 of learned
Sessions Judge, Peshawar, delivered in
case FIR No.1353 dated 08.09.2016 u/ss
302/324/34 PPC of Police Station
Pishtakhara, Peshawar, whereby the
appellants have been convicted and
sentenced as under:-

i. u/s  302(b)/34 PPC to life
imprisonment as Ta’azir with payment
of Rs.1,50,000/- each as compensation
payable to the legal heirs of the
deceased within the meaning of
Section 544-A Cr.P.C. or in default
whereof to suffer six months SI.

ii. u/ss 324/34 PPC to 03 years Sl
with fine of Rs.10,000/- or in default

whereof to undergo one month SI each.
All the sentences were directed to run
concurrently while benefit of Section 382-B
Cr.P.C. was extended to them.

2. As per prosecution version, on
08.09.2016, Syed Abid Hussain (PW-13)
while reporting the matter to the police at
casualty ward of Khyber Teaching Hospital,
Peshawar, alleged that on the relevant day
he, his younger brother Syed Tajamul
Hussain and paternal cousin Syed Dildar
Hussain Shah were present in Pishtakhara
Payan near the Hujra of Noor Shad Hussain
when his maternal cousins, who are also his
co-villagers, namely, Malik Iftikhar,
Malik Inam ((present appellants),
Malik Sharafat and Malik Irfan came duly
armed with deadly weapons and started
firing at them with intention to kill as result
Syed Tajamul Hussain received injuries on
different parts of his body and succumbed to
the injuries while on way to the hospital
whereas he/complainant and his paternal
cousin Syed Dildar Hussain Shah escaped
unhurt. Besides them, the occurrence is
stated to have been witnessed by people
present on the spot. The culprits were

identified by complainant and Syed Dildar
Hussain Shah in light of the bulb installed
outside the gate of the Hujra. Motive for the
crime was stated to be dispute over land,
hence on the basis of murasila, case FIR
(Ex.PA) was registered.

3. After completion of investigation, the
accused were charge sheeted to which they
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

4. The prosecution in order to
substantiate its case against the accused
produced and examined 16 witnesses in all.
Where-after the statements of accused were
recorded, wherein, they professed their
innocence. The learned trial Court, on
conclusion of trial, found the appellants
guilty of charge and while recording their
conviction, sentenced them, as mentioned
above, where against they have preferred
the instant appeal whereas the complainant
has filed Cr.R  No.80-P/2018 for
enhancement of sentence, therefore, being
outcome of the same judgment, they are
decided through this single judgment.

5. Perusal of record would reveal that
the entire case of prosecution hinges upon
ocular account furnished by complainant

(PW-13) and eyewitness, namely,
Syed Dildar Hussain Shah (PW-14), medical
evidence, recovery of klashnikov from the
appellant Malik Iftikhar, recovery of 7.62
bore from the spot, its matching report
Ex.PZ/1, wherein, the microscopic
examination resulted into opinion as that
three 7.62 bore crime empties marked C1 to
C3 fired from 16 MM SMG fifle
No.19753311 in question, in view of the
following major points i.e. striker pin mark,
breach face mark, ejector marks, etc” and
the motive.

6. Before analyzing the decisive role of
ocular account, we would like to discuss the
motive at first. In legal dictionary motive is
defined; “it is an inducement, reason, or
willful desire and purpose behind the
commission of offence. Whether the
purpose was good, like helping someone
commit suicide, or bad, like committing
murder, however, it is not the deciding factor
in deciding guilt or innocence. In
psychology, this is what energizes people to
action determines their choice or behavior,
as concerns, desire, emotion or need”. In
this case, in First Information Report, motive

was specifically taken a dispute over the
property in between both families i.e. of
complainant and accused. Record depicts
that MstNaseem Jan (mother of
complainant & deceased) was _ allegedly
deprived of her inheritance by his brother,
namely, Malik Shah Khan (father of
convict/appellants) for which she _ has
instituted a suit, which was decreed in her
favour on 24.05.2014, however, the appeal
was pending, during which occurrence took
place on 08.09.2016. In the cross-
examination of PW13 (complainant,
convict/appellant had placed on file that “in
the year 2009, my mother filed an
application against the accused for her
share in the property in the court”. Copies of
documents of civil dispute i.e. plaint,
mutation, judgment & decree were placed
on record as Mark |. the date of decree in
civil suit was 25.04.2014, whereby the
inherited property of complainant's mother
was decreed in her favour, the occurrence
took place in order to get revenge of the
aforesaid civil litigation. Reliance is placed
on case title Khadija Saddique and

another vs. Shah Hussain and another
(PLD 2019 SC 261), wherein, it has been
held:-

“The High Court had observed that
motive set up by the prosecution
had not been proved by it because
on the one hand Khadija Siddiqui
(PW6) had maintained that she had
refused to marry respondent No.1
but on the other hand a letter
written by her to respondent No.1
showed that she was quite willing
and eager to marry him. The High
Court had failed to read that portion
of the statement of Khadija Siddiqui
(PW6) wherein she had explained
that she was being harassed by
respondent No.1 and she wanted to
complain against him to her mother
and, therefore, an attempt was
made by respondent No.1 to silence
her. Khadija Siddiqui (PW6) had
also been suggested by the defence
itself that respondent No.1 had
shunned her company but the
young lady persisted in continuing
her relationship with respondent
No.1 which suggestion clearly
showed that there was a break in
the close friendship between that
young lady and respondent No.1
prompting the respondent to make
an attempt to get rid of her which
provided a plausible motive to

respondent No.1”.
7. The prosecution has proved the
motive as alleged by it in FIR. Though
motive alone could not be considered for
conviction but shall be considered with the
ocular account of the case. Since the
decisive role was that of ocular account of
complainant & PW14, therefore, in our view,
we would like to discuss it by making careful
appraisal of all to draw a conclusion as to
whether their presence on the spot at the
time of occurrence has been established by
prosecution and whether their testimony is
worthy of credence, believable and whether
their conduct is natural and in accordance
with the ordinary human conduct or
otherwise.

8. It has been noticed that instant
occurrence took place on 08.09.206, at
about 1930 hours, whereas the matter was
reported to the local police at 2010 hours
within 40 minutes after the occurrence.
Appellants-convict, their brother Malik
Sharafat (convicted by the learned Sessions
Judge/Judge Juvenile Court and Malik Irfan
declared proclaimed offender), were
nominated in promptly lodged FIR, with

specific role of causing firearm injuries on
right, left lungs, heart, small & large
intestines to Syed Tajamul Hussain Shah
(deceased). The eyewitness, PW14, has
also been nominated in the FIR. Such
promptly lodged FIR excludes chances of
consultations and deliberations. The ocular
account in the case has been furnished by
Syed Abid Hussain (PW-13) = and
Syed Dildar Hussain Shah (PW14) have
fully supported the prosecution’s version as
narrated by the complainant in FIR (Ex.PA).
They in their respective statements deposed
that on the day of occurrence they alongwith
deceased were present at the spot after
Maghrib prayer when in the meanwhile
appellants alongwith Sharafat and
Malik Irfan (proclaimed offender) while
armed with deadly weapon came to the
spot, who were identified by them through
electric light installed on the outer gate of
Hujra of Noor Shad Hussain Shah and on
seeing them started firing at them as a result
of which Tajamul Hussain (deceased)
sustained injuries on different parts of body
whereas they escaped unhurt. After firing
accused decamped from the spot whereas

they took deceased then injured to the
hospital, but in the way Tajamul Hussain
succumbed to the injuries.

9. Although Syed Abid Hussain
complainant is the real brother of
Tajamul Hussain deceased whereas PW14
Syed Dildar Hussain Shah is the cousin of
deceased, therefore, their testimony cannot
be discarded merely on account of their
relationship with deceased (Syed Tajamul
Hussain) rather they are natural witnesses
and their evidence is confidence inspiring
and trustworthy. Though occurrence took
place at night time i.e. after Maghrib prayer,
yet PWs Syed Abid Hussain and
Syed Dildar Hussain Shah cousin, have
given the source of identification by stating
that they identified the appellants and two
others at the spot in the light of energy saver
“bulb”. Perusal of evidence of
aforementioned PWs reveals that they
remained consistent on all material points
and there was no discrepancy in their
statements. They have given all details of
occurrence leading to the murder of
Syed Tajamul Hussain deceased at the
hands of appellants. Both PWs 13 and 14

were cross-examined at length but defence
10

failed to shatter the evidence of said
witnesses. Undoubtedly and undeniably, the
complainant and deceased were brothers,
similarly PW14 and deceased were first
cousins but the eye witnesses are consistent
regarding mode and manner in which the
occurrence has taken place. They were
cross examined at length but there was no
material contradiction in their statements.
Moreso, their statements were further
corroborated by medical evidence. The
mere relationship would not detract the
veracity of natural witnesses, if they had
absolutely no motive of their own to involve
the appellants falsely by letting off the real
culprits. Reliance is placed on case title
Iqbal versus State (2014 SCMR 1227),
wherein, it was held as under:

“Mere relationship of these two
P.Ws. with deceased cannot render
their evidence unreliable unless it is
established that they had motive

implicate the appellant falsely.”

10. The apex court of the country in case
tiled Hasil Khan vs. The State (2012

SCMR 1936) has held that:-
11

“The ocular account in this case was
furnished mainly by _ P.W.1 Dil
Murad(complainant) and Zareef Khan
P.W.2. The former is the brother whereas
the latter is the nephew of the deceased.
though both are relative but mere
relationship would not make a witness
unworthy of reliance if his testimony is
corroborated by any _ independent
evidence or circumstance appearing on
record. Both the witnesses have
reasonably explained their presence at
the spot i.e. the reason of their travel was
that they were returning from a marriage
ceremony and this reason has not been
specifically challenged by defense during
cross examination. Their testimony is
corroborated medical evidence and
recovery of T.T pistol. All the eye
witnesses were subjected to lengthy
cross examination but their credibility
could not be shaken as they not only
corroborated each other but also
remained consistent on all material

particulars of the prosecution case.”
12

11. ‘It is pertinent to mention here that
appellants and their brothers are first
cousins of complainant and who is the real
brother of deceased (Syed Tajamul
Hussain), so it cannot be expected for
complainant that he would let off the real
culprit and would falsely involve appellants
in the murder of his real brother.

12. Medical evidence further corroborates
the ocular account furnished by the
prosecution. For further clarity of the injuries
on the person of Syed Tajamul Hussain
deceased, prosecution produced
Dr.Muhammad Kabir (PW8), who conducted
the postmortem examination of the dead
body of deceased. The doctor observed
multiple firearm injuries (as many as
seventeen in number, entry & exit) on the
person of deceased. Cause of death was
shown by Dr.Muhammad Kabir PW8 as
injuries to right, left lungs, heart, small and
large intestine due to firearm injuries.
According to the opinion of Doctor, wall, ribs,
cartilages, pleurae, right & left lung,
pericardium, heart and blood vessels were
injured, pertaining to Thorax in_ internal

examination besides abdomen. The
13

probable time between injuries & death was
immediate and between death &
postmortem examination was 1 to 4 hours,
therefore, medical evidence of Syed Tajamul
Hussain deceased corroborates the seat of
injuries, weapon used by appellants &
Malik Sharafat establishes the time of
occurrence. The medical evidence of
deceased is in line with ocular account
furnished by prosecution. One of the
contention of learned counsel for appellants
pertaining to the place of occurrence as
mentioned in FIR & the one in site plan
(Ex.PB) where in former it is mentioned as
Hujra Noshad but in latter as Hujra Bahadar
was also of no weight because Bahadar is
the father of Noshad.

13. | Recovery of klashnikov with 21 live
rounds from personal possession of
appellant Malik Iftikhar, recovery of 30 bore
pistol without number with 25 live rounds
from personal possession of appellant
Malik Inam were properly corroborated by
report of Forensic Science Laboratory
(Ex.P2/2), Ex.PW11/7 & Ex.PZ/1, which
further strengthened the version of

prosecution as given by the PW13 & PW14.
14

Reliance is placed on case titled Nasir Iqbal
alias Nasra Vs. The State (2016 SCMR
2152), wherein it is held as under: -

““In the above circumstances, we
found that the ocular evidence
furnished by the eye-witnesses to
be credit worthy and confidence
inspiring and we have not been
able to observe any defect or
material lacunas in their evidence;
their presence at the spot had been
established beyond any shadow of
doubt; both the eye-witnesses
were of course closely related to
the deceased but fact of the matter
remains that their mere
relationship would not render them
to be interested or partisan
witnesses when the same has been
corroborated with the medical
evidence as well as the recoveries
of crime weapon and the motive
has fully been proved as such in
our view  no_ interference is
required in conviction of the

appellants”.

14. Thus, keeping in view that ocular
account is in consonance with medical
evidence, recoveries of weapon of offence,
empties recovered from the place of
occurrence with positive report from

Forensic Science Laboratory, proof of theory
15

of motive as expounded by the complainant,
we are of the view that learned trial court
has rightly held the appellants guilty of
offence.

15. Another important question would be
the quantum of sentences to be awarded to
the appellants, we are of the view that the
question of quantum of sentence always
requires utmost care and caution on the part
of the court, as such decisions relate to the
life of the accused. It is settled by now that
the prosecution is obliged to exclude every
mitigating circumstance from its case and
once it fails to do so, the convicts can be
awarded lesser punishment provided under
the law. Law is also settled that while
deciding the question of sentence, the
accused are entitled for benefit of every
mitigating circumstance. Learned trial court,
while determining the quantum of sentence,
has kept in mind that for the murder of
Syed Tajamul Hussain, four persons have
been charged due to which capital
punishment would not be proper and as
such the appellants were sentenced for life
imprisonment, thus, the quantum of

sentence for appellants was _ properly
16

determined by the learned trial court.
Guidance can be sought from the case titled
Sharafat Ali Khan Vs. The State (2010
SCMR 1205), wherein, it was held by the
Supreme Court that: -

“In Muhammad Riaz and another Vs.
The State (2007 SCMR 1413) while
considering the penalty for an act of
commission of qatl-e-amd it was
observed that “no doubt, normal
penalty for an act of commission of
qatl-e-amd provided under law is
death, but since the life
imprisonment also being a _ legal
sentence for such offence must be
kept in mind wherever the facts &
circumstances warrant mitigation of
sentence, because no hard and false
rule can be applied in each and

every case”.

16. The Hon’ble Supreme Court, while
deciding the case titled Haji Muhammad
Sadiq Vs. Liaqat Ali and others (2014
SCMR 1034) has held that: -

“A single mitigating circumstance,
available in a particular case, would
be sufficient to put on guard the
Judge not to award the penalty of
death but life imprisonment. No clear
guideline, in this regard can be laid
down because facts and
circumstances of case differs from
the other, however, it become the
essential obligation of Judge in
awarding one or the other sentence
17

to apply his judicial mind with a
deep thought to the facts of
particular case. If the Judge/Judges
entertain some doubt, albeit not
sufficient for acquittal, judicial
caution must be exercised to award
the alternative sentence of life
imprisonment, lest an_ innocent
person might not be sent to the
gallows, so it is better to respect the
human life, as far as possible, rather
to put it at and, by assessing the
evidence, facts & circumstances of
particular murder case, under which
it was committed”.

17. Thus, the learned trial court has
properly appreciated the facts and
circumstances of the case while determining
the quantum of sentence of appellants,
therefore, no exception could be taken to it,
as such, for the reasons discussed above,
this appeal has no merit, which is hereby
dismissed. Similarly, keeping in view the
quantum of sentence as discussed above,

Cr.R No.80-P/2018 is dismissed.
