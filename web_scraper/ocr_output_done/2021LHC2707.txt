Appellants by: Mr. Muhammad Naveed Abbas Raja
Advocate

State by: Ms. Maimoona Ehsan-ul-Haq DDPP

Complainant by: Mr. Muhammad Razzaq Advocate

SOHAIL NASIR J: Aqib Javed, Muhammad Sadiq, Amjad
Ali and Bilal Ali (appellants) had faced trial in case FIR No. 147
(PQ) recorded on 21.08.2019 under Section 365-A PPC on the
complaint of Mushtaq Hussain (Pw-5) at police station Jalalpur
Sharif, District Jhelum for the abduction of Shahbaz Hussain
(Pw-7). Later on, Section 337-L(I) PPC was also added. On
conclusion of trial, vide judgment dated 29.11.2019 passed by
learned Judge Anti-Terrorism Court No. 1 Rawalpindi, all
appellants were convicted and sentenced as under: -

Section _356-A_ PPC imprisonment for life
each and forfeiture of properties each
Under Section 7-E of the Anti-Terrorism
Act, 1997 (Act) imprisonment for life each.

It was directed that their sentences shall
run concurrently. Benefit of Section 382-
B Cr.P.C was also extended to them.

2. Being dissatisfied from the judgment of learned trial Court,
appellants have assailed their convictions through the instant
appeal.

3. Facts of the case are that on 21.08.2019, Mushtaq Hussain
(Pw-5) moved an application (PC) to SHO Jalalpur Sharif where
he maintained that his son Shahbaz Hussain (Pw-7) aged about 25
years was running a shop under the title of ‘Friend Mobiles’ in a

plaza Haris Center; it was his routine to close the shop at 09:30 pm
Cr. A. No. 952 of 2019 2

and to return to home; on that day (20.08.2019) he did not come
back so he/complainant from his mobile 0302-5149012 contacted
Shahbaz Hussain on his mobile 0300-5648081, but the calls were
not attended; at about 11:30 pm, when he/complainant responded a
telephone call, he was told that his son had been abducted; the
person on other side asked to arrange Rs. 500000/- (five lacs);
he/complainant also talked to his son who disclosed that he was
abducted from the street and he was taken to an unknown place.
According to complainant thereafter the cell phone of his son was
switched off.

4. On the basis of above application, FIR was recorded by
Muhammad Jawwad Anwar Inspector (Pw-10) at 04:40 am on
21.08.2019.

5. Prosecution’s case is that on the same day in the morning
Mushtaq Hussain (Pw-5) along with Muhammad Rafiq (Pw-6)
went to Kukkar Pindi on a motorbike on the asking of unknown
assailant; they arrived near mountain; on the way Muhammad
Rafiq concealed himself whereas, Mushtaq Hussain having ransom
money that was settled as Rs. 100000/- (one lac) moved ahead
where Muhammad Sadiq (appellant) armed with pistol was present
at some distance. On payment of ransom, Shahbaz Hussain was
released who was produced before Raja Jawwad Inspector and he
prepared a memo (PD).

6. Prosecution further alleged that on the same day at about
06:00 pm on receipt of secret information police party headed by
Muhammad Jawwad Anwar Inspector (Pw-10) reached at factory
road, Chak Mujahid, Link Road and arrested Aqib Javed,
Muhammad Sadiq and Amjad Ali (appellants) who were brought
to police station and confined in lockup; on 22.08.2019 all three
were produced before the Court and sent to judicial lockup for
their identification parade which was conducted on 24.08.2019 by
Mr. Fahad Khan Sarwar Judicial Magistrate (Pw-12); on
25.08.2019 upon receipt of secret information, Bilal Ali

(appellant) was also arrested from Factory Mor, Chak Mujahid,
Cr. A. No. 952 of 2019 3

Raja Hotel; on 26.08.2019, he was also sent to jail where on
28.08.2019 his identification parade had taken place under the
supervision of Mr. Najam Ayyub Judicial Magistrate (Pw-13).

7. Prosecution further claims that all appellants were identified
in the identification parades and during investigation the ransom
amount beside 30-bore pistols were also recovered from them.

8. On conclusion of investigation, report under Section 173
Cr.P.C (Challan) was submitted in Court.

9. A charge under Sections 365-A/337-L(I]) PPC read with
Section 7 of the Act on 28.02.2019 was framed against all the
appellants, which they pleaded not guilty and demanded their trial.
10. In support of its case, prosecution had produced Dr. Usman
Aslam who medically examined the abductee (Pw-1), Nazar Abbas
HC/Moharrar (Pw-2), Asif Iqbal Constable who got conducted
medical examination of the victim (Pw-3), Adil Naseer HC who
provided the CDRs of appellants (Pw-4), Mushtaq
Hussain/Complainant (Pw-5), Muhammad Rafiq/witness to
payment of ransom (Pw-6), Shahbaz Hussain/abductee (Pw-7),
Hassan Raza ASI/witness to recoveries (Pw-9), Muhammad
Jawwad Anwar Inspector/IO (Pw-10), Yaqoob Ali Shahzad
Magistrate who recorded the statement of abductee under Section
164 Cr.P.C (Pw-11), Mr. Fahad Khan Sarwar Magistrate who
supervised the identification parade of Aqib Javed, Muhammad
Sadiq and Amjad Ali (Pw-10) and Mr. Najam Ayyub Magistrate
who supervised the identification parade of Bilal Ali (Pw-13).

11. Hassan Hayat Constable and Dr. Rabia Tariq were given up
being unnecessary by learned DPP who thereafter closed
prosecution’s evidence. The learned trial Court also examined
Syed Hammad Abid DPO as Cw-1.

12. In their examinations under Section 342 Cr.P.C all the
appellants pleaded a long story and crux of the matter was that they
were involved falsely in this case. All they opted not to produce

defense evidence or to appear under Section 340(2) Cr.P.C.
Cr. A. No. 952 of 2019 4

13. Learned counsel for appellants contended that prosecution’s
case is filled up with serious lacunas, infirmities, inherent defects
and the statements of witnesses are in contrast to each other; the
story that only on payment of Rs. 100000/- (one lac) as ransom the
abductee was released after passing only a night appears to be
unnatural; conduct of police in particular DPO Jhelum has been
found under serious criticism and it is proved that appellants have
been made escape goat.

14. On the other hand, learned counsel for complainant and
learned DPP jointly argued that the case is serious and heinous in
its nature as a young boy was abducted for ransom and the
allegations leveled by prosecution were successfully proved during
the trial; there was no enmity of the witnesses for false
involvement of any of the appellants; in identification parades all
the appellants were rightly identified by the witnesses; during
investigation ransom amount was also recovered from every
appellant beside fire arm weapons. They finally contended that the
learned trial Court on the basis of a well reasoned judgment has
rightly convicted the appellants therefore appeal is liable to be
dismissed.

15. HEARD.

16. Prosecution’s case is that on the same day (21.08.2019),
Mushtaq Hussain (Pw-5) and Muhammad Rafiq (Pw-6) had gone
to Kukkar Pindi where the ransom amount of Rs.100000/- was
paid for release of Shahbaz Hussain (Pw-7). In cross-examination
both witnesses admitted that the police officials were also with
them and standing after crossing the village Kukkar Pindi at a
distance of 1/2 KM. Considering these facts the question in our
mind is that when Shahbaz Hussain was released and was in the
safe custody of both the witnesses, why the police officials present
there made no effort to apprehend any of the culprits? Having
Police with complainant at the time of payment of ransom makes it
clear that it was a planned move and that the police was also in the

knowledge that at what place ransom had to be paid? Despite
Cr. A. No. 952 of 2019 5

having prior information not to proceed for apprehension of any of
the criminals who were certainly within the range of police officers
makes the prosecution’s story doubtful.

17. Statement of Muhammad Jawwad Anwar Inspector (Pw-10)
indicates that at the time of payment of ransom a considerable
number of police officials/officers were present there. He in cross
examination stated that: -

“The ransom amount of Rs. 100000/- was
settled in between the accused and
complainant. I reached a Kukkar Pindi
behind hills. I ordered the other police
officials for guarding at Daulat Pur, Kukkar
Pindi and Pind Baghan Wala. In the
meanwhile, complainant Mushtaq Hussain
along with Muhammad Rafiq reached there
on motorcycle and I sent them along with
ransom amount of Rs. 100000/- towards
Kukkar Pindi Hills. In the meanwhile, the
DPO Jhelum ordered to join CIA staff
Jhelum, Elite force and officials of other P.S
Jhelum with me. At about 05:55 AM,
Mushtaq Hussain complainant, Muhammad
Rafiq brought Shahbaz Hussain abductee
before me from the clutches of three
unknown accused after giving ransom
amount of Rs. 100000/-. I sent the police
came from the other police stations behind
the accused”

18. It is surprising that every event was within the view of large
number of police officers, who were deputed at all relevant places
but no one was able to apprehend any of the accused.

19. Who had arranged the ransom amount? Prosecution even on
it is not confident. According to Mushtaq Hussain the money was
available in the house of Muhammad Rafiq which they took and
went to police station. On the other hand Muhammad Jawwad
Anwar Inspector (Pw-10) claimed that he sent Mushtaq Hussain
etc. towards Kukkar Pindi Hills along with Rs. 100000/-. Hammad
Abid DPO Jhelum (Cw-1) in cross-examination also with regard to
arranging the ransom money had stated that “it is correct that I
mentioned in the displayed video that we arranged the ransom

”

amount”. Although he volunteered that “we” meant the
Cr. A. No. 952 of 2019 6

complainant side but his version cannot be accepted because in the
same statement he maintained that the currency notes which were
to be given as ransom were marked, so subsequently they can be
recovered to trace the accused.

20. When the criminals could be apprehended conveniently,
they were not taken to task despite availability of considerable
numbers of police officers, but on the same day when they had
every chance to disappear, they were arrested with a gap of 12
hours only, from the same area on spy information. A prudent
mind cannot accept this story.

21. Moving ahead the prosecution’s story is that on 05.09.2019
at the instance of Muhammad Sadiq (appellant) an amount of
Rs.33000/, Aqib Javed Rs.33000/- and Amjad Ali Rs.43000/- were
recovered but none of the currency notes were having any specific
mark. This aspect we have deliberately referred because when
Hammad Abid DPO (Cw-1) was examined, he added that the
currency notes were marked.

22. Recovery of currency notes from the possession of a person
shall be presumed to be belonging to him, unless there are special
circumstances to hold otherwise. The cash recovered from
Muhammad Sadiq, Aqib Javed and Amjad Ali were not a big
amount so these cannot be considered as the one that was paid as a
ransom.

23. It was alleged that Muhammad Sadiq (appellant) got
recovered Rs.33000/- on 05.09.2019 and pistol 30 bore after
disclosure during the investigation those were lying in his hut like
house situated at Factory Mor, Chak Mujahid. It was stated that
Muhammad Sadiq (appellant) called his wife who provided the
key on the basis of which he opened an iron box and from there the
currency notes and pistol were recovered. These recoveries cannot
be believed for the reason that neither box, nor lock or the key
were taken into possession by the investigating officer.

24. Aqib Javed (appellant) on the same day (05.09.2019) got
recovered pistol 30 bore and Rs.33000/- which he kept in a room
Cr. A. No. 952 of 2019 7

of a deserted Dera of Imtiaz Shah. After digging the ground he
brought out the amount and pistol 30 bore and produced before the
investigating officer. The owner of the Dera was never joined in
the investigation to establish that in what capacity appellant was
having an access to that property.

25. Finally, on the same day, Amjad Ali (appellant) got
recovered Rs.43000/- and a pistol from a deserted Kotha after
digging the earth. This was an unattended place and within the
approach everyone so here too prosecution is defeated.

26. Even if we believe, these recoveries are of no help for
prosecution because the amount so recovered has not been proved.
to be the part of ransom money due to contradictory statements of
the witnesses and for another very important reason that according
to Mushtaq Hussain, he had saved serial numbers of currency notes
in his mobile phone. If this was the position, it was quite easy for
prosecution to connect the recovered currency notes from the
amount of ransom after retrieving the data from mobile phone.
Withholding this best evidence is another blow for prosecution.

27. Before reverting to identification parade we want to discuss
the statement of Syed Hammad Abid DPO (Cw-1). It was
18.11.2019, when on behalf of appellants their learned advocate
moved an application under Section 540 Cr.P.C for summoning of
Syed Hammad Abid DPO Jhelum as a Court witness on the reason
that soon after the incident, he made a press conference and also
got recorded an interview with SAMAA TV, which was aired and in
that press conference he had given a different story of the incident.
A CD of that interview and press conference was also produced.
After hearing both the sides said application was allowed and in
this background Syed Hammad Abid was examined as Cw-1. In
his examination-in-chief, he narrated the same story on which
prosecution is relying but in cross-examination the picture was
otherwise. When he was cross-examined by prosecution, an

attempt was made to make the video clippings doubtful. The CD
Cr. A. No. 952 of 2019 8

was played in the Court and viewed by him. Finding him in
difficulty he replied that: -

“The source of this video cannot be
ascertained, it may be made by a person
planted from accused side being locals. It is
not officially issued by me. This video clip is
mixed with made probably by SAMAA TV
and it is not authentic even my name is
wrongly written in it. The video Mark-E
shown to me in the Court is edited, mixed
and out of context. The officials of PFSA did
not summon me to verify the contents of the
video at PFSA, Lahore”

28. The above responses appear to be result of understanding
between prosecution and the said witness, however in cross
examination by defense the facts which came on surface are as
under: -

I. The CD has voice and picture of
Hammad Abid.

II. In this clipping, the time mentioned by
the witness was 10:00 am.

Ill. He reached at the site at about 10:15
am.

IV. In the video, he was describing the time
of his arrival in the area as 03:30/03:45
am.

V. The ransom amount was recovered from
the accused at spot.

VI. The currency notes which were to be
given as ransom were marked for
subsequent recovery from accused.

Vil. The ransom money was arranged by
police.

VIII. There was a cross firing between police
party and the accused.

29. Although while giving the answers to every question, he had
been offering some volunteer portions trying to dispute what he
had stated but fact was established that he made an interview and a
press conference. In such state of affairs, we see no reason to
acknowledge his lame excuses and we hold that facts which have
been posted and presented in this case are mysterious and full of
doubts.

30. We have also observed that the identification proceedings

are short of required standard. Identification parade is not a
Cr. A. No. 952 of 2019 9

requirement of law but only one of the methods to test the veracity
of evidence of an eye witness who has had an opportunity to see
the accused and claims to identify him. It is to be conducted as a
tule of caution. It is not a substantial piece of evidence unless
supported from independent sources. Volume III, Chapter 11-G,
Part-C of the Rules and Orders of The Lahore High Court Lahore,
and Paragraph 26.32 Chapter XXVI of the Police Rules, 1934
prescribe a procedure for holding the identification parade. Some
of the salient features are as under: -

i. The proceedings shall be conducted
under the supervision of a Magistrate.

ii. Identification parade shall be carried as
soon as possible after the arrest of
suspect.

iii. List of all persons included in the
identification should be prepared by
showing their names, parentage,
addresses and occupations.

iv. Suspects shall be placed amongst other
persons traced of the same religion and
of same social status with proportion of 8
or 9 for each suspect.

v. They will be similarly dressed up.

vi. The identifying witnesses shall be kept
separate from each other so they may not
be in a position to have any contact with
them.

vii. No communication which would
facilitate identification is made to any
witness who is awaiting his turn to
identify; and

viii. that after making identification the
witnesses do not communicate with other
witnesses who have yet to do so.

31. In first phase, Agib Javed, Muhammad Sadiq and Amjad Ali
(appellants) were placed under the identification parade on
22.08.2019 supervised by Mr. Fahad Khan Sarwar Judicial
Magistrate Jhelum (Pw-12). It is more than surprise for us that the
learned Magistrate did not consider appropriate to hold a joint
identification parade of all the appellants and this has raised
multiple challenges for prosecution. Appellants were three in

numbers and the identification parade had to be in one go. The
Cr. A. No. 952 of 2019 10

learned Magistrate was under obligation to arrange three queues. In
each line one appellant had to stand at a number of his choice and
thereafter witnesses were to be invited one by one. Every witness
had to identify the accused from each line.

32. The learned Magistrate adopted entirely a different
procedure. He conducted the identification parade for each
appellant independently and separately. We have noticed that three
independent proceedings (PAA, PBB and PCC) were prepared by
him. In every proceeding he recorded as under: -

I. First of all, identification of suspect Aqib
Javed started.
Il. First_of all, identification parade of
Muhammad Sadiq Started.
I. First_of all, identification of suspect
Amjad Ali started.

33. If three independent identification proceedings were carried
than how every proceeding was first of all. We have noticed that
all identification proceedings almost are verbatim copies to each
other and the only difference is with regard to names of appellant
and the manners in which witnesses identified them.

34. As referred earlier that under the guiding principles a
Magistrate has to ensure that after first witness is called and he is
relieved from the exercise, he/she has to be kept at a place from
where he/she cannot have any communication or contact with the
witness who still has to come to identify the accused. In this case
we have noticed that after Mushtaq Hussain had identified each
appellant, he was not ordered to be kept at a place from where he
could not see or communicate with the other witness. The moment
Mushtaq Hussain completed his assignment, thereafter Shahbaz
Hussain was called to identify the accused which means that at that
occasion Mushtaq Hussain was also there.

35. Before calling the second witness, it was the duty of
Magistrate to make an offer to every appellant to change his
position but even here, the learned Magistrate is found to have

deviated from his obligations.
Cr. A. No. 952 of 2019 11

36. It is also not clear that after the first identification parade
was completed, where both the witnesses remained or stayed and
how they assembled again. We are again astonished to see that
three proceedings were shown independently, but in every
proceeding the time was recorded as 11:30 am. In cross
examination when Mr. Fahad Sarwar Khan (Pw-12) was
confronted with this specific situation, he simply replied that it was
a typographical error. When all the proceedings are suffering from
procedural violations and under serious doubts, we cannot accept
the explanation offered by the gentleman.

37. Identification parade of Bilal Ali (appellant) was conducted
on 28.08.2019 by Mr. Najam Ayyub Judicial Magistrate Jhelum
(Pw-13). Bilal was aged 24 years but some of dummies placed
with him were of 33 years of age. Although learned Magistrate
stated that all the dummies were of similar features but we are not
going to hold so because of difference of ages among them. One of
the conditions, that all the dummies must be similarly dressed up
are also missing in these proceedings.

38. Finally coming to CDR that was taken into possession
during investigation pertaining to all appellants we have observed
that these documents have not been proved by the prosecution in
accordance with law as these are computer generated papers
secured from the system available with police department. To
prove such evidence through modern device the principles have
already been settled. In ‘Gohar Khan & another vs. The State
PLJ 2019 Cr.C (FSC) 515’ on the question of proof of CDR it was
held that: -

“As far as, the Call Data Record (CDR)
(Ex.PT/1 to Ex.PT/5) is concerned, it has
added nothing to the case of prosecution on
many counts. Firstly, the prosecution has
failed to associate and produce the
concerned official of the Cellular Company
who issued the CDR (Ex.PT/1 to Ex.PT/5),
secondly, the CDR (Ex.PT/1 to Ex.PT/5),
does not figure even the sign alone and
stamp of the concerned Authority, who
issued the same”
Cr. A. No. 952 of 2019 12

39. Prosecution on the strength of settled principles of law in all
circumstances is under obligation to prove its case at all stages of
criminal trial. No license can be given to prosecution to take
advantage of weakness of defense as it has to stand on its own legs.
Heinousness of offence alone cannot be a consideration to record
the conviction. Before an accused is sent to gallows, Court requires
the evidence and that too of qualitative nature. The benefit of doubt
is all situations shall be extended to accused not as a matter of
concession but as a privilege.

40. Concluding the discussion made above, we finally hold that
prosecution has badly failed to prove its case beyond shadow of
doubt against all the appellants named Aqib Javed, Muhammad.
Sadiq, Amjad Ali and Bilal Ali, therefore, this criminal appeal is
allowed. Impugned judgment dated 29.11.2019 passed by the
learned trial Court is set_aside and all the appellants are acquitted
from the case. They are in custody and they shall be released

forthwith it not required in any other case.
