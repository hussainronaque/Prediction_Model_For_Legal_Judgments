JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.- Questioned

herein is the judgment dated 22.10.2011, rendered by learned

Additional Sessions Judge Lahor, District Swabi, whereby

appellant Ismail, has been convicted under section 302 (b)

PPC, for committing the murder of Sher Zaman deceased and

sentenced to undergo life imprisonment as Ta’azir and to pay

Rs.2,00,000/- (two lacs) as compensation to LRs of the

deceased within the meaning of S.544-A Cr.P.C. or in default

thereof to undergo 6 months S.I. further. He has also been

convicted and sentenced under section 324 PPC for attempting

at the lives of complainant and PW Imtiaz, to suffer 2 years

R.I. and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/- or in default thereof to

undergo 01 month S.I. Benefit of S.382-B Cr.P.C. has been

extended to him.

2. The prosecution case in brief, as divulging from First

Information Report is that on 15.11.2009 at 1920 hours,

complainant Imtiaz (PW-10), in company of dead body of his

brother Sher Zaman deceased, reported to local police in

hospital Kahanda that on the fateful day he along with his

brothers Akhtar Zaman and deceased had gone to village “Jalo

Wand” for purchasing husk heap and on their return when

reached near the shop of Jan Said, Ismail (appellant-convict

herein), duly armed with firearm, emerged and opened fire at

them with intention to do them away, resultantly, the deceased

was hit and died on the spot while he and PW Akhtar Zaman

luckily remained unscathed. An oral altercation inter-se the

accused and deceased, a month prior to the incident, has been

alleged as motive behind the incident. In addition to him, the

incident is stated to have been witnessed by said Akhtar

Zaman.

3. Report of the complainant was recorded in the

shape of murasila Exh.PA/1 by Muhammad Hussain Khan ASI

(PW.3), on the basis of which FIR Exh.PA No.887 dated

15.11.2009 was registered against the accused-appellant under

sections 302/324 PPC at Police Station Lahor District Swabi. He

prepared injury sheet and inquest report of the deceased

Exh.PM/1 and Exh.PM/2 and shifted the dead body to the

mortuary for autopsy.

4. Dr. Asghar Ali Shah (PW.6) conducted postmortem

examination on the dead body of the deceased on 15.11.2009

at 8.00 p.m. and found the following injuries on his person:-

1. Firearm entrance wound size about 2 cm on right
side of back.

2. Firearm exit wound size about 1x1 cm on right side
chest.

3. Firearm entrance wound size about Y2 cm on

lumber region on back side.

4. Firearm exit wound 1 cm on abdomen above
umbilicus.
5. Firearm entrance wound on right side back lumber

region size about 1 cm.
6. Firearm exit wound on right side abdomen size

about 1 x 1 cm.

7. Firearm entrance wound on left side lega on calf

8. Firearm exit wound on left leg front size about 1 x 1
cm.

9. Firearm entrance wound on left palm size about 2

10. Firearm exit wound on the palm left side 1 x 1 cm.

Opinion:- According to opinion of the Medical Officer, death of
the deceased occurred due to firearm injury to vital organs like
lungs and liver leading to hemorrhage shock and death.
Probable time between injury and death has been observed
“within few minutes” while between death and postmortem as
“about 3 hours”.

5. Afsar Said Khan SI (PW.13) proceeded to the spot

and prepared site plan Exh.PB at the instance of eyewitnesses.

During spot inspection he secured blood stained earth from the

place of the deceased vide recovery memo Exh.PW.13/1. Vide

recovery memo Exh.PW.13/2 he took into possession the last

worn bloodstained garments of the deceased, sent the

bloodstained articles to the FSL and receipt the report Exh.PK,

initiated proceedings under sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. against

the accused, recorded statements of the PWs under section

161 Cr.P.C. and after completion of investigation handed over

case file to the SHO, who submitted challan in terms of S.512

Cr.P.C. against the accused/appellant.

6. After arrest of the accused/appellant and completion

of necessary investigation, supplementary challan was

submitted against him before the learned Trial Court, where he

was formally charge sheeted, to which he pleaded not guilty

and claimed Trial. To prove its case, prosecution examined as

many as fourteen witnesses. After closure of the prosecution

evidence, statement of the appellant was recorded under

section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein he denied the prosecution

allegations and professed his innocence. He, however, declined

to be examined on oath or to produce evidence in defence. On

conclusion of trial, learned Trial Court, after hearing both the

sides, convicted and sentenced the appellant, as mentioned

above, hence, this appeal.

7. Learned counsel for the appellant argued that

appellant is squarely innocent and has been implicated falsely;

that the occurrence is unseen and PWs Imtiaz and Akhtar

Zaman being real brothers of the deceased are procured

witnesses; that none of them has received a single scratch

much less any firearm injury despite in close proximity of the

accused and at his mercy; no bullet marks has been observed

on the walls behind them falling in fire line as shown in the site

plan; that both the PWs have not stated a single word about

kind of firearm with the accused in the initial report; that Wazir

Kaka from whom the PWs allegedly purchased the husk heap,

has not been examined to establish the association of the PWs

with each other on the fateful day; that both have badly failed

to establish their presence on the spot through some physical

circumstances of the incident; that medical evidence squarely

belies the ocular account; that no empty has been recovered

from the spot; that motive alleged remained unproved; that

from the record the deceased was involved in so many criminal

cases and having enmity with many people, therefore, he

might have been killed by his enemies; that mere recovery of

blood stained garments of the deceased and his autopsy report

coupled with alleged recovery of Kalashnikov in other case

without any FSL report to prove the same to be the crime

weapon, would not advance the prosecution case as these

pieces of evidence being corroborative are always taken into

consideration with direct evidence, which in the instant case is

discrepant, untrustworthy and_= suffering from material

contradictions, hence, cannot be relied upon; that mere

abscondance which too is a corroborative piece of evidence in

absence of direct evidence would not be sufficient to prove the

guilt of the appellant. He contended that prosecution has

miserably failed to bring home the guilt of the appellant

through cogent and confidence inspiring evidence thus the

learned Trial Court reached to erroneous conclusion by holding

the appellant guilty of the offence, therefore, impugned

judgment is liable to be reversed.

8. Conversely, learned AAG assisted by learned

counsel for the complainant contended that appellant is directly

and singularly charged for murder of the deceased in a

promptly lodged report eliminating the possibility of

consultation, deliberation and concoction; that being a broad

daylight incident and parties well known to each other,

question of mistaken identity does not arise; that there exist no

reason to prompt the PWs to falsely charge the appellant but

letting off the real culprit; that eyewitnesses have established

truthful and straightforward account of the incident and

defence failed to shatter their testimony; that recovery of blood

from the spot, bloodstained garments of the deceased, the

unnatural death of the deceased with firearm as per autopsy

report corroborate the ocular account; that after the incident

appellant remained fugitive from law which is another

circumstance proving his guilty conscious; that mere non-

recovery of empties would not damage the prosecution case in

presence of direct and substantive evidence. They while

supporting the impugned judgment sought dismissal of the

appeal.

9. We have given our anxious consideration to the

respective arguments advanced from both the sides and

perused the record carefully.

10. Record divulges that deceased had been done to

death on a thoroughfare near the shop of one Jan Said at

1730 hours in the month of November for which the

appellant has been directly and singularly charged. No doubt,

the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held in so many judgments

that substitution of single accused in a murder charge is a

rare phenomenon, but still to put the rope around the neck of

an accused charged singularly, there must be ocular account

of unimpeachable character, trustworthy and confidence

inspiring, corroborated by other material circumstantial

evidence. Besides, the apex Court in case titled, “Dr. Israr

ul Haq vs Muhammad Fayyaz and another” (2007

SCMR 1427) has observed that substitution of innocent

person when a single accused is named in a murder case is a

rare phenomenon, but it depends from case to case. The

ocular account of the incident has been furnished by

complainant Imtiaz (PW.10) and Akhtar Zaman (PW.11), both

brothers of the deceased. Admittedly, mere relationship of a

witness with the deceased is not a valid ground for excluding

his testimony from consideration, but it is equally settled

principle of law that an eyewitness who claims his presence

on the spot must satisfy the mind of the Court for believing

his statement and placing implicit reliance over the same by

some physical circumstances.

11. In support of his version Imtiaz complainant

appeared as PW.10. In his examination in chief he reiterated

the same story set forth by him in his initial report. He charged

the appellant for murder of the deceased as well as attempting

at their lives. In cross-examination he totally negated his own

version by deposing that he lodged report/murasila Exh.PA/1

on the spot and signed the same there and then before the

10

1.0. Same is the version of PW Akhtar Zaman who stood as

rider on the murasila. He deposed that he signed the murasila

Exh.PA/1 as a rider on the spot. Contrary to their version,

according to murasila the same had been recorded by

Muhammad Hussain Khan ASI (PW.3) in the hospital on the

report of complainant. PW-3 has not stated a single word

about any report of the complainant on the spot. No such

report lodged by complainant on the spot, is available on the

file, so in the circumstances, the very report of the complainant

in the hospital is highly doubtful. In the site plan Exh.PB the

appellant has been shown at point No.2 at a distance of seven

paces from complainant at point No.3 and at a distance of 8

paces from PW Akhtar Zaman at point No.4. None of them has

disclosed the specific kind of weapon in possession of the

appellant at the time of incident despite such close proximity.

In cross-examination both admit that they can differentiate

between different types of weapons like pistols, Kalashnikov

etc. So if they were able to differentiate and recognize different

types of weapons, why did not they disclose specifically the

kind of weapon allegedly used by the appellant in the

11

commission of offence, is a disturbing circumstance creating

doubt about his presence on the spot, for which no plausible

explanation has been furnished by them. Besides, Complainant

has been shown at point No.3 at a distance of single space

from PW Akhtar Zaman at point No.4 and their inter-se

distance with the appellant has been shown as 7, 8 paces, but

none of them has received a single scratch much less any

firearm injury nor any bullet marks has been observed on the

walls behind them i.e. shop of Jan Said. It is not the case of

the prosecution that the PWs took shelter any where during

the incident, so if they were at the mercy of the accused who

was mentally prepared to do them all away, why were they let

off, is another crucial circumstance creating doubt in a prudent

mind about presence of the alleged eyewitnesses because no

assailant would take a risk in such eventualities to leave

evidence behind him or to leave a risk of revenge in future.

Complainant in cross-examination deposed that he himself

placed the dead body of the deceased on cot, in which process

his hands and clothes smeared with the blood of the deceased.

No such clothes have been taken by the I.O. in to possession

12

nor produced by the complainant to him to establish his

presence on the spot. No independent witness has come

forward from the nearby house to depose about presence of

the alleged eyewitnesses on the spot. At least Jan Said shop

keeper should have been examined by the I.0O. in proof of

presence of the PWs, but he has neither been examined nor

cited as witness. Akhtar Zaman PW.11 deposed that they

purchased husk heap from one Wazir Kaka and village Jalo

Wand, but said Wazir Kaka has not been examined by the I.0O.

He should have been examined at least to prove the

association of the PWs with the deceased and neither their visit

to his village. All the above discussed circumstances, cast

serious doubts about presence of the alleged eyewitnesses

with the deceased at the relevant time of incident.

12. Yet there is another aspect of the case, which

totally negates the ocular account. According to alleged PWs

and as shown in the site plan the deceased was facing towards

the accused at the time of incident, but as per autopsy report,

the deceased has sustained all the entrance wounds from back

to front, which belies the alleged eyewitnesses. If we presume

13

that a human cannot remain static in such situation and the

deceased might have changed his position during firing, but at

least he should have been received one injury from front in

which circumstances, the above proposition then would be

appealable to a prudent mind, but such is not the case herein.

In view of the above discussion we are of the firm view that

both the alleged eyewitnesses have not witnessed the incident

and the occurrence has not taken place in the mode and

manner as alleged by the prosecution, rather in some other

mode.

13. No crime empty has been recovered from the spot.

During court statements both the alleged eyewitnesses just to

bring in line their testimony with the circumstance of non-

recovery of the empties, deposed that after the occurrence,

people who attracted to the spot removed the empties, which

amounts to intentional dishonest improvement as not a single

word has been uttered by them in the initial report. So far as

recovery of blood, bloodstained garments of the deceased

autopsy report wherein deceased met unnatural death due to

firearm injuries and Kalashnikov allegedly recovered from the

14

appellant in other criminal case, are the only corroborative

and confirmatory pieces of evidence, which in absence of

direct evidence would not be sufficient to prove the guilt of

the appellant. In this regard reference can be made to Riaz

Ahmed’s case (2010 SCMR 846). As per the dictum of the

apex Court, corroborative evidence is meant to test the

veracity of ocular evidence. Both corroborative and ocular

testimony is to be read together and not in isolation. Wisdom

in this regard may be derived from Ijaz Ahmed’s case

(1997 SCMR 1279 and Asadullah’s case (PLD 1971 SC

541). It has been held by the apex Court in case titled,

“Saifullah Vs the State” (1985 SCMR 410), that when

there is no eyewitness to be relied upon, then there is

nothing, which can be corroborated by the recovery. Similarly,

in case titled, “Riaz Masih Vs the State” 1995 SCMR

1730, the honourable apex Court held that recovery of crime

weapon by itself is not sufficient for conviction on murder

charge. The same view has been expressed by the apex Court

in Saifullah’s case (1985 SCMR 410).

15

14. No doubt, proceedings under section 512 Cr.P.C.

were initiated and completed against the appellant, however,

he has denied his abscondence in his statement under section

342 Cr.P.C. It is settled law that abscondence alone, cannot

be a substitute of real evidence. It has been observed by the

apex Court in Farman Ali and others’ case (PLD 1980 SC

201) that abscondence by itself would be of no avail to

prosecution in absence of any other evidence against the

absconding accused. Mere abscondence of accused would not

be enough to sustain his conviction. Reliance can also be

placed on case titled, “Muhammad Vs Pesham Khan

(1986 SCMR 823).

15. For the forgoing reasons, we are of the firm view

that prosecution has miserably failed to bring home the guilt

of appellant through cogent and confidence inspiring evidence

beyond shadow of doubt. The prosecution evidence is

pregnant of doubts and according to golden principle of

benefit of doubt; one substantial doubt would be enough for

acquittal of the accused. The rule of benefit of doubt is

essentially a rule of prudence, which cannot be ignored while

16

dispensing justice in accordance with law. Conviction must be
based on unimpeachable evidence and certainty of guilt and
any doubt arising in the prosecution case, must be resolved in
favour of the accused. The said rule is based on the maxim
“ it is better that ten guilty persons be acquitted rather than
one innocent person be convicted” which occupied a pivotal
place in the Islamic Law and is enforced strictly in view of the
saying of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) that the “mistake of Qazi
(Judge) in releasing a criminal is better than his mistake in
punishing an innocent”. Wisdom in this regard can also be
derived from the judgments of the apex court in case titled,
"Muhammad Khan and another Vs the State” (1999
SCMR 1220) and case titled, “Muhammad Ikram Vs the
State” (2009 SCMR 230). In the instant case, the
prosecution evidence is highly discrepant, full of infirmities
and doubts. The learned trial Court has not evaluated the
evidence in its true perspective and thus reached to an
erroneous conclusion by holding the appellant guilty of the
offence. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed. Convection and

sentences of the appellant are set aside and he is acquitted of

17

the charges leveled against him. He be set at liberty forthwith,

if not required in any other case.

16. These are reasons of our short order of even date.

maintained that the learned Trial Court has the
jurisdiction to entertain the suit and in case of
decision of issue of the jurisdiction in favour of the

petitioners, after conclusion of trail, it would be

19

respondent to suffer and she is ready to face the
consequences of such scenario. He while supporting
the impugned orders, sought dismissal of the instant
petition.

5. Come what may, the issue raised, being a
mixed question of law and fact, can properly be
resolved, after recording pro and contra evidence of
the parties by the learned Trial Court. In view of the
above, the impugned orders of both the courts below
are set aside and the matter is remanded to the
learned Trial Court with the direction to frame a
specific issue (qua) jurisdiction, if already not framed,
to afford an opportunity to the parties for leading
their evidence and then to decide the suit on merits
in accordance with law. The learned Trial Court shall
conclude the trial as early as possible, but not later than

4 months, on receipt of the record. Office shall ensure
