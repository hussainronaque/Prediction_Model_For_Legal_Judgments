JUDGMENT

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’bie Mr. Ishtiaq tbrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
WIQAR AHMAD, J.- Through this single judgment,
we intend to dispose of Criminal Appeal No. 27-M of
2018, Criminal Appeal No. 46-M/2018 as well as
Criminal Revision No. 12-M of 2018. All these:
connected appeals and revision arise out of judgment
dated 31.01.2018 of the Court of learned Additional
Sessions Judge Dir Lower at Chakdara, which had
passed the following order;

“As sequel to above discussion, prosecution remained
successful in bringing home charge against accused
Mudasir Shah beyond any shadow of doubt for
murder of deceased Mst. Ghazala as well as murder
of Ihrar in furtherance of common intention and
attempting at life of complainant. The minor short
comings and deficiencies although worth ignoring
are not denied in the prosecution case which do creep
with passage of time, and in such circumstances, the
principle underlying the concept of benefit of doubt
can in addition to the consideration of question of
guilt or otherwise, may also be pressed in the matter
of sentence. When the accused succeeds in casting
some doubt on the version of prosecution case, is
entitled to benefit in the matter of sentence. The
accused is also of young age 20/21 years old
therefore, in view of the peculiar facts of the case,
capital punishment is avoided and accused namely
Mudashir Shah is hereby convicted under section
302 (b) PPC and sentenced to life imprisonment (on
two counts). The convict is also directed to pay
amount of Rs. 100,000(One Lac each) as
compensation amount within the meaning of section
544-A Cr.P.C to the legal heirs of each deceased and
in case of default thereof convict shall further
undergo six month SI. Accused Mudasir Shah is also
convicted under section 324 PPC and sentenced to 7
years RI. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C is extended
to convict. The sentences awarded to the accused
would run concurrently. Accused Muhammad Tahir
Shah is still absconder, he is declared proclaimed

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’bte Mr. Ishtiag }brahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
offender and his name be entered in the register of
P.Os and perpetual warrant of arrest be issued
against him, Accused Atta Ul Maboob was however
acquitted of the charges by extending him benefit of
doubt.

Feeling aggrieved therefrom appellant
namely Mudasar Shah has filed his criminal appeal
against conviction, while complainant (appellant)
namely Muhammad Faraz has filed appeal against
acquittal of accused/respondent namely Attaul
Mabood. The complainant has also filed criminal
revision for enhancement of the sentences awarded to
the convicted accused (appellant herein).

2. Appellant and other co-accused faced
trial in case FIR No. 05 (Ex.PW-7/1) dated 01.01.2016
under sections 302,324,34,109,212 PPC registered at
Police Station Chakdara District Dir Lower on the
basis of ‘Murasila’ (Ex. PW-1/1) sent by Zahid Khan,
SHO. He has stated that he had received information
of the occurrence and gone to the spot, where the
complainant namely Muhammad Faraz had lodged
first report of the occurrence. The complainant stated
in his report that he along with his sister namely Mst.
Ghazala had gone to the house of their brother-in-law
namely Jehan Akbar. While they were coming back to

their own house they found the absconding accused

Nawab —_(D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Kon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tahir Shah along with the appellant Mudasaar Shah
near a place known as Matoor (3s), The accused
first made firing at their brother namely Ihrar and
thereafter ran towards them. On reaching them they
opened fire at the complainant and his accompanying
sister with the intention to kill them. Brother of the
complainant namely lhrar received injuries on his head
as a result of firing of the accused while his sister
received injuries on her chest and died on
the spot, while the complainant escaped un-hurt
miraculously. Mst. Ghazala had earlier been engaged
with absconding co-accused Tahir Shah whose
engagement had later on ended, which fact was
disclosed as motive for commission of the offence.

3. During the course of investigation, the
Investigating Officer recovered blood through tissue
paper (Ex. P-1) from the spot vide recovery memo Ex.
PW-2/2 dated 02.01.20216. An empty of 30 bore
(Ex.P-2) had also been recovered from the spot vide.
recovery memo Ex. PW-2/3 dated 02.01.2016. Two
crime empties of 30 bore pistol were also taken in
possession vide recovery memo Ex. PW-2/5 dated
02.01.2016, Weapon of offence i.e. 30 bore pistol was
also recovered on pointation of the appellant vide

Nawab —_(D.B.)_ Hon'ble Mr. Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
recovery memo Ex. PW-10/6 dated 29.02.2016. The
pistol along with empties recovered from the spot were
sent to Forensic Science Laboratory (hereinafter
referred to as “FSL”) for the purpose of comparison,
report (Ex.PW-16/2) received therefrom was in
affirmative.

4. On completion of investigation, complete
challan was submitted against appellant and other co-
accused before learned trial Court. Proceedings under
section 512 Cr.P.C were initiated against absconding
co-accused Tahir Shah. After compliance of
proceedings of 265-C Cr.P.C, charge was framed
against them on 09.05.2016, to which they pleaded
“not guilty” and claimed trial. Prosecution produced
as many as sixteen (16) witnesses, whose statements
were recorded and placed on file. On conclusion of
proceedings in the case, accused were examined under
section 342 Cr.P.C. Learned trial Court convicted and
sentenced the appellant namely Mudasar Shah vide
impugned judgment dated 31.01.2018 as stated earlier,
while co-accused namely Attaul Maboob was
acquitted of the charges by extending him benefit of

doubt.

Nawab (0.B.) Hon‘ble Mr. Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
5. We have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the parties, learned Adll: A.G appearing on
behalf of State and perused the record.
6, Perusal of record reveals that
prosecution have mainly been relying upon testimony
of the sole eyewitness namely Muhammad Faraz
(PW-1), who had also been complainant in the instant
case. In his examination-in-chief he has narrated the
story as mentioned in the FIR, with the only addition
that at the time of firing at his deceased sister he had
run towards the nearby graveyard so as to save himself
from the firing. This witness was cross-examined at
length. There has been a delay 2 hours and 45 minutes
in lodging first report of the occurrence, as the time of
occurrence has been mentioned as 16:00 P.M on
01.01.2016 while the time of report has been shown as
18:45 P.M on said date in the ‘Murasila’ Ex. PW-1/1.
In the context of delay as well as presence of the PW, a
part of the cross-examination of this sole eyewitness is
very important which needs reproduction herein for
ready reference;

"Setlists acs 28,

This is very strange that the complainant
had left behind his injured brother, as well as his
deceased sister and had rushed to the house where he
had also taken his cousins with him, and chased the
accused. During the long chase of 02 hours and 40.
minutes, he had almost forgotten his brother and sister
which he had left on the spot. It is very strange that

nobody else from the house had come out and taken

the injured to the hospital or lodged report of the :

occurrence with the promptitude which was need of
the hour. Further ahead in his cross-examination this
witness has also stated that the distance between their
house and police post “Khadgazai” was about 1300
hundred meter while he was unable to disclose the
distance of another police post namely “Badwan”. He
also stated that during search of the accused
they had neither sent information of the occurrence
to police post “Khadgazai” nor to police post.

“Badwan”, Tt has come in the statement of

Nawab = (D.B.)_Hon'bie Mr. Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
Investigating Officer PW-12 that the distance between
police post “Badwan has been 3/4 kilometers
(approximately) from house of the deceased. The
witness i.e. PW-] had also improved his statement in
his examination-in-chief where he stated that he had
tun to the graveyard for taking shelter, while on the
other hand he had stated in his first report of the
occurrence that he had escaped the firing miraculously.
Such an improvement might have been felt necessary
by him, for the reason that his role has not been fitting
in the story of prosecution. Had he been present in the
company of his sister and fired at by two of the
accused simultaneously, his escape in such a situation
might be deemed requiring an explanation, for which
purpose the assertion of running towards graveyard
might have been added to the story. This display of
unnatural conduct by the sole eyewitness, creates
substantial doubt about presence of the PW and
witnessing the occurrence. In the case of “Pathan v/s
The_ State” reported as 2015 SCMR 315 Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan had disbelieved the
eyewitnesses, due to the unnatural conduct found

described in their respective testimonies. Relevant part

Nawab (0.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Ishtiag ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
of findings of the Hon’ble Apex Court is reproduced
hereunder for ready reference;

“In this case, the deceased has received numerous
stab/incised wounds on different parts of his body,
numbering 19 in all. The appellant was armed only with
scissors not a formidable weapon of destruction. The
complainant is the son of the deceased while Baradi and the
other P.W. Muhammad Yousaf are also related to the
deceased. The causing of such large number of injuries one
after another to the deceased with scissors must have
consumed reasonable time due to the pause in between the
first injury and the last one but all the three P.Ws. including
the son with a strong stature and built remained as silent
spectators. They did not react or showed any response when
the accused was causing the injuries. No man on the earth
would believe that a close relative would remain silent
Spectator in a situation like this because their intervention
was very natural to rescue the deceased but they did nothing
nor attempted to chase the accused and apprehend him at
the spot.”

Further reliance in this regard may also
be placed on judgment of Hon’ble Lahore High Court
in the case of “Mst. Salamat_Bibi_v/s_The_ State”
reported as 1986 P Cr.LJ 111.

7. So far as recovery of the pistol on
‘pointation of accused/appellant, vide recovery memo
Ex. PW-10/6 is concerned, it is important to be noted
that said pistol has been shown lying beneath a stone at
a place known as Khwar Sabar Shah near an irrigation
channel. The recovery was shown to have been
witnessed by the witnesses mentioned there, among
whom PW-10 namely Muhammad Naseer Khan
Inspector has been produced in Court, who stated in

his cross-examination that marginal witnesses to the

Nawab {D.B.) Hon’ble Mr, Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-10-

recovery memo Ex. 10/6 namely Mahmood Khan and
Rahim Bakshah were relatives of the complainant-
party. Even otherwise, when the prosecution has failed
to prove the case against the appellant beyond
reasonable doubt then the corroboratory evidence
produced in the case could be of no help to the
prosecution. In this respect, reliance is placed on
judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the
case of “Imran Ashraf & 7 others v/s The State”
reported as 2001 SCMR 424, wherein it has been held;

“Recovery of incriminating articles is used for the
purpose of providing corroboration to the ocular
testimony. Ocular evidence and recoveries, therefore,
are to be considered simultaneously in order to reach
for a just conclusion."

In support of same ratio, further reliance
may also be placed on the judgment reported as

2007 SCMR 1427.

8. Prosecution have therefore not been able
to prove its case against the appellant beyond
reasonable doubt. The accused/appellant is therefore
acquitted of the charges by allowing the instant appeal.
Criminal Appeal No. 46-M of 2018 filed by
complainant against acquittal of accused/respondent
namely Atta-ul Maboob is also dismissed for the

reasons recorded hereinabove. Criminal Revision No.

Nawab (0.8.) Hon'ble Mr, Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-ll-

12-M of 2018 has become infructuous and same is also
dismissed accordingly.
9, These are reasons for our short order of

even date, which read as follows;

/
“For reasons to be recorded later, we allow this appeal,
set-aside the judgment of conviction dated 31.01.2018
passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge Chakdara
Dir Lower in case FIR No. 05 dated 01.01.2016 registered
under sections 302, 324, 34,109,212 PPC at police station
Chakdara District Dir Lower and resultantly acquit the
accused/appellant namely Mudasar Shah of the charges
levelled against him. He be released forthwith if not
required in any other case.”
