KAMRAN _HAYAT MIANKHEL, _J:- This
criminal appeal is directed against the judgment
dated 02.04.2019 of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-VI, Abbottabad delivered in case
FIR No.499 dated 20.06.2015 under section 15
AA, KPK, Police Station Mirpur Abbottabad,
whereby the appellant Javed Awan has been
convicted under section 15 AA KPK_ and
sentenced to a rigorous imprisonment for seven
years and a fine of Rs.50,000/- and in default of
payment of the same fine, he shall further

undergo three months S.I. Benefit under section
382-B Cr.P.C has been extended in favour of
appellant/convict.

2. Facts of the case, in brief, are that on
20.06.2015 during patrolling, SHO Police
Station Mirpur receipt a spy information that
Javed Awan nominated accused in case FIR
No.498 dated 20.06.2015 u/s 324 PPC, Police
Station Mirpur is present in his hostel. On this
information after calling mobile rushed to Javed
Awan Hostel situated near Ruqia Sultana
Hospital for the arrest of accused and conducted
raid. Accused was found present in the hostel, he
was atrested in the aforesaid case, his personal
search was conducted during which one 30 bore
pistol No.30276, country made alongwith four
cartridges loaded in a magazine. On further
search six cartridges of the same bore were also
recovered from right side pocket of his shirt. The
accused could not produce any valid
licence/permit for the recovery arm and
cartridges. The same was sealed into parcel No.1
and was taken into possession as a weapon of

offence in aforesaid case. In the wake thereof,
instant case was registered against the
appellant/accused.

3. On completion of investigation, challan
was put in court. After compliance of provisions
of section 265-c Cr.PC, charge was framed and
served upon the appellant/accused for the crime
to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
Prosecution produced five (05) witnesses in
support of its case. On conclusion of prosecution
evidence, statement of accused was recorded u/s
342 Cr.PC. Learned trial court after hearing
arguments from both sides found the appellant
guilty of the charge and, while recording his
conviction, sentenced him as mentioned above.

4. | Arguments of both sides heard and record
gone through.

5. Scrutiny of record depicts that the pistol
was recovered from personal possession of the
appellant/convict for which he could not produce
any valid license or permit for its lawful
retention coupled with the fact the same was
used by the appellant/convict in a murder case,

registered vide FIR No.498 dated 20.06.2015
under section 302 PPC, police station Mirpur
(Abbottabad). Furthermore, the weapon of
offence was sent to Forensic Science Laboratory
for its chemical analysis, report of which was
found positive which further supported
prosecution case. The prosecution produced 5
witnesses to prove its case against the accused
and all of them were subjected to lengthy cross-
examination but nothing could be extracted from
their mouth to favour the accused or to create
any doubt in their credibility in respect of
recovery of weapon of offence rather all the
prosecution witnesses remained consistent and
coherent on material aspects of the case.

6. Although both the marginal witnesses to
the recovery memo vide which the weapon of
offence was taken into possession by the
complainant, are police officials, however, the
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its
numerous verdicts held that testimonies of police
officials are as good as any other private witness

unless it is proved that they have any animosity
against the accused. Further, that reluctance of
general public to become witness in such like
cases has become judicially recognized fact and
there is no way out to consider statement of
official witnesses, as no legal embargo is
imposed in this respect. Police officials are as
good witnesses and could be relied upon, if their
testimony remains unshattered during cross-
examination. While, in the instant case, defence
has failed to substantiate that the prosecution
witnesses had any ill-will or animosity towards
the appellant to falsely implicate him. In this
respect, reliance can be placed on a judgment of
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case titled
“Liaqat Ali and another v. The State” reported as
2022 SCMR 1097, wherein it was held that:

“This Court in a number of judgments

has held that testimony of police

officials is as good as any other

private witness unless it is proved that

they have animus against the accused.

However, no such thing could be

brought on record by the petitioners in

this case. This Court has time and

again held that reluctance of general

public to become witness in such like

cases has become _—_ judicially
recognized fact and there is no way
out to consider statement of official
witnesses, as no legal bar or restriction
has been imposed in such regard.
Police officials are as good witnesses
and could be relied upon, if their
testimony remains un-shattered during
cross-examination.”

7. In view of detailed discussion of this court
rendered hereinabove, it is held that prosecution
has well established its charge against the
appellant/convict and the learned trial court has
properly appreciated the prosecution evidence in
its true perspective. No illegality in the
impugned conviction recorded by the learned
trial court was found. As such, conviction of the
appellant recorded by the learned trial court vide
judgment/order dated 02.04.2019 is hereby
maintained, resultantly appeal preferred by the

appellant, being devoid of any merit, is

dismissed.
Announced.
