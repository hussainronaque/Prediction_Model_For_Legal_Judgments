Appellant (Abdul Hameed) By Ms. Farhana Marwat, Advocate.

State. By Mian Arshad Jan, AAG.

QAISER RASHID KHAN, J. Ata trial held by the
learned Judge Special Court/ Additional Sessions Judge-III,
Kohat the appellant, Abdul Hameed, on being found guilty
under section 9 (c) CNS Act, in case FIR No.298 dated
26.3.2013, Police Station MRS, Kohat was convicted and
sentenced to seven years R.I and to pay a fine of Rs.50000/-
(fifty thousand) or in default to undergo further six months S.I
with benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C extended to him vide
judgment dated 15.7.2014.

2. The prosecution case as per FIR is that on 26.3.2013
upon receipt of information about the smuggling of huge

quantity of Charas via Highway, the complainant Wali Bat
Khan IHC alongwith other police officials laid a picket at

Highway Check Post when, in the meanwhile, motorcar

bearing Registration No. PL-2355 coming from Dara

Adamkhel side and driven by the appellant, Abdul Hameed,

was stopped for the purpose of checking. From his body

search nothing incriminating was recovered. However, search

of the motorcar led to the recovery of 8 packets of Charas

Gardah concealed in the secret cavities made in the floor of

the car which on weighment turned out to be 10,000 grams

and from each of the packets 5/5 grams were separated for

FSL while the rest were sealed in a separate parcel. The

accused-appellant was arrested on the spot and the motorcar

alongwith registration book was also taken into possession,

hence the FIR ibid.

3. Investigation commenced and on its conclusion,

complete challan was submitted against the accused-appellant

before the learned trial Judge who after holding a full dressed

trial convicted and sentenced the appellant through the

impugned judgment, hence the appeal.
4. In order to prove its case the prosecution produced

seven witnesses in all. PW-1 Mazhar Jahan Khan is the I.O.

He prepared the site plan (Ex.PB) at the instance of the

complainant and also recorded the statements of PWs under

section 161 Cr.P.C. He obtained custody of the accused vide

application (Ex.PW1/1), interrogated him, recorded his

statement under section 161 Cr.P.C and on expiry of the

police custody, the accused was sent to judicial lockup. After

completion of investigation, he handed over the case file to

the SHO for submission of challan before the learned trial

court.

PW-2 Wali Bat Khan IHC, is complainant of the case.

He narrated the same facts which were mentioned by him in

his murasila (Ex.PA). He stated that on the eventful day he

got information about smuggling of narcotics through

motorcar and on such information he alongwith other police

contingents held nakabandi at the crime spot when in the

meanwhile motorcar bearing No.PL-2355 of grey colour

coming from Dara Adam Khel was signaled to stop. He

deboarded the accused from the motorcar but from his
personal search nothing was recovered. However, on search of

the motorcar he recovered 8 packets of charas gardah from the

secret cavities made in the floor of the said motorcar.

PW-3 Gulab Din FC is marginal witness to the recovery

memo (Ex.PW2/1) vide which in his presence the

complainant recovered 8 packets of charas gardah total

weighing 10 KGs from the secret cavities made in the floor of

the motorcar. From each packet 5/5 grams were separated for

FSL examination and sealed into parcel No. 1 to 8 while the

remaining stuff was sealed into parcel No. 9.

PW-4 Iftikhar Ali LHC took parcels No. 1 to 8 to the

FSL vide road certificate copy whereof is Ex.PW4/1,

deposited the same with the concerned official and brought

the receipt back.

PW-5 Javed Hussain SHO PS Teeri on completion of

investigation submitted complete challan against the accused

which bears his signature.

PW-6 Shaukat Salim ASHO PS MRS Kohat on receipt

of murasila registered the case FIR (Ex.PA/1) which bears his

signature.
PW-7 Gulzar Hussain LHC PS Usterzai took the

murasila to the PS and handed over the same to the Moharrir

of the P.S.

5. On closure of the prosecution evidence, the accused-

appellant was examined under section 342 Cr.P.C wherein he

denied the allegations levelled against him, pleaded innocence

and false implication. However, he neither opted to be

examined on oath nor to produce defence.

Arguments heard and record perused.

6. It was the complainant Wali Bat Khan IHC who, on

receipt of spy information regarding the smuggling of Charas

by the appellant held a nakabandi at the crime spot when in

the meanwhile motorcar bearing registration No. PL-2355

driven by the accused-appellant appeared which was stopped

and search of the motorcar led to the recovery of 8 packets of

Charas Gardah total weighing 10 KGs concealed in the secret

cavities made in the floor beneath the doors of the motorcar.

His ocular testimony was subjected to extensive cross-

examination by the appellant but he stuck to his stance

regarding the arrest of the appellant and the recovery of the
contraband Charas from the secret cavities made in the floor

of the motorcar which was in exclusive possession of the

appellant.

7. PW-3 also testified to the effect that the recovery of the

Charas was effected in his presence vide recovery memo

(Ex.PW2/1) and that the same correctly bore his signature. An

attempt was made by the defence counsel to make some dent

in his version but to no avail to the appellant. He firmly

supported the prosecution’s stance regarding the recovery of

Charas from the motorcar driven by the appellant. Similarly,

PW-1 namely, Mazhar Jehan Khan SHO, who conducted the

investigation in the case also faced the test of cross-

examination but no questions as such were asked from him

whereby his investigation could be brought under the shadow

of any doubt.

8. During the course of arguments, the learned counsel for

the appellant lambasted the FSL report and contended that the

same puts to naught the prosecution version according to

which the recovered contraband was gardah but in the FSL

report, its physical appearance has been shown to be ‘brown
solid’. We do not subscribe to this argument of the learned

counsel for the appellant. Lately an impression has been

created that ‘Gardah’ as the very name connotes means

“powder” and that is how the defence takes benefit of the

same when during evidence in such like recoveries, PWs in all

earnest and fairness while recording their statements call the

recovered narcotics to be in solid or semi solid form. “Charas

Gardah” by no means can be equated with its literal

translation to be powder. “Charas Gardah” for all practical

purposes is in solid but, of course, raw form. In common

jargon this solid raw form is known as “Gardah”. This

misnomer by our estimate is safely pressed into service by the

accused as his defence during trial. This is but an endeavour

on our part to clarify or rather allay the misconception about

the phrase “Charas Gardah”. The overleaf of FSL report

(Ex.PZ) shows that not only the recovered contraband was of

“brown solid” form but when subjected to chemical

examination, it tested positive during “Duquenois Test” as

well as in “Thinalyer Chromatography” which are the tests

conducted in order to ascertain as to whether certain
contraband item is Charas or otherwise. The ‘Test Report’

has been duly signed by the Chemical Expert FSL Peshawar

as well as the Assistant Chemical Examiner FSL, KPK,

Peshawar.

9. Another argument advanced before us is that as against

the complainant, Wali Bat Khan, who during cross-

examination termed the recovered contraband Charas to be of

‘Khar’ colour, PW3 in his cross-examination stated it to be of

‘blackish colour’ and in the FSL report its physical

appearance has been shown to be ‘brown solid’. We are

rather amused with such contention. ‘Khar’ is the Pashto

translation of the word ‘brown’. By the same corollary,

Khar’, ‘brown’ and ‘blackish colour’ convey the same

meaning and certainly depends upon the understanding and

appreciation of different individuals of various colours.

10. The other argument strongly advanced by the learned

counsel for the appellant is that the car from whose secret

cavities Charas was recovered was not produced before the

learned trial court. In order to fully appreciate this argument

of the learned counsel for the appellant, we again went
through the entire evidence. As against the statements of PWs

who vouched about the recovery of the contraband from the

secret cavities made in the floor of the car, not a single

question was asked from them about the non-production of

the vehicle or that such cavities could not have been made in

its floor. Even when the questions in respect of the vehicle

were asked from the complainant Wali Bat Khan, they

pertained to its ownership, registration book and its model and

it would be more apt to reproduce the replies of the

complainant to such questions:

i) “Motorcar was shifted to PS through constable.”

ii) “I do not remember the name of the constable
who_ brought the vehicle to PS.”

iil) “T have not observed the registration book about
the ownership.”

13. It needs no reiteration that CNS Act, 1997 is a special

law and it has been specifically provided under section 29 of

the Act that presumption of recovery of the contraband item is

always deemed to be from the accused unless is proved to the

contrary. In the present case, barring minor and negligible

contradictions which, of course, do not strike at the roots of
10

the prosecution case, otherwise the PWs are unanimous about

the recovery of the contraband item from the vehicle driven

by the appellant. Being the driver, the appellant was the

overall Incharge of the vehicle and thus cannot plead or feign

ignorance about the contraband charas hidden in the secret

cavities of the vehicle. The responsibility and liability of the

driver has been resolved by the august apex court in case

titled “Muhammad Noor and others vs. The State” (2010

SCMR 927). Moreover, the PWs were not at all questioned

about any previous ill-will or animus with the appellant

whereby he could have been falsely nabbed and charged for

the possession of the contraband Charas. Not only the

recovery of the Charas from the motorcar which was in the

exclusive possession of the accused-appellant stood proved

but also the separation of the samples, its sending to the FSL

and the affirmative report later on vide Ex.PZ. Though the

appellant has denied the prosecution allegations in his

statement under section 342 Cr.P.C, but mere denial of charge

and pleading innocence without substantiating the same

through cogent evidence would not be sufficient to earn him
11

acquittal. Moreover, the appellant has neither appeared as his

own witness under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C nor has produced

any evidence in rebuttal to the prosecution evidence or for that

matter in support of his plea of defence. The same per se

suggests that the appellant had nothing in his defence.

14. In view of the fact that the prosecution case stood fully

proved against the appellant to the hilt, the learned trial Judge

recorded a well reasoned judgment after proper application of

mind. As such the impugned judgment does not suffer from

any illegality, misreading or non-reading of evidence which

would in turn call for interference through the instant appeal.

Resultantly, this appeal being bereft of any merits

stands dismissed.
