KEE

MUHAMMAD FAHEEM WALI, J.- This appeal
is directed against the judgment dated 07.12.2021,
rendered by learned Judge, Anti-Terrorism Court,
D.I.Khan, whereby the appellants, after facing trial in
case FIR No.310 dated 14.7.2021, under sections 365-
A, 387, 382, 411/34 PPC read with section 15 Arms
Act, of police station SMA, Tank, have been
convicted and sentenced as under:-

(i) Under section 365-A PPC, to

rigorous imprisonment for life;

(ii) Under Section 392 PPC, to seven

years R.I. with fine of Rs.20,000/- or in

default thereof, to suffer two months

simple imprisonment; and

(iii) Under Section 15 Arms Act, to
three years R.I.
= Dis

All the sentences have been ordered to run
concurrently. However, section 387 PPC has been
deleted.

2. The prosecution story as unfolded in the
FIR, registered on the basis of murasila, in brief, is
that on 14.7.2021 at 6:45 hours, complainant Habib
Ullah (PW-2), reported on the spot to Sajid Ahmad
Khan SHO of police station SMA, Tank, to the effect
that on 13.7.2021, he alongwith Muhammad Faraz
(PW-2), owner of truck bearing registration
No.C/1399, Rahimullah (abandoned PW) and Javed
Ullah (PW-8) were proceeding to Peshawar from
Ladha in the said truck loaded with woods and at
about 23:30 hours, when they reached to the spot,
three muffled face persons, duly armed with pistols
and Kalashnikov were standing on roadside, who
signaled them to stop, whereupon due to fear they
stopped the truck and were deboarded therefrom; that
the accused searched them and took away Rs.60,000/-
from him, Rs.1500/- from Javed and a mobile phone
having SIM No.03348821774 and also kidnapped
Muhammad Faraz by demanding Rs.1,00,000/- as
ransom. He charged unknown accused for the
commission of offence. Subsequently, during course
of investigation, statement of the alleged abductee was
recorded under section 161, Cr.P.C. where he charged

unknown accused with their identification marks and

Sc

descriptions, however, he charged the convict/
appellants during identifications parades conducted by .
Illaqa Magistrate (PW-10) in Central Jail D.J.Khan
and Sub Jail, Tank.

3. On completion of the investigation,
complete challan against the appellants was submitted
before the learned trial Court where at the
commencement of trial, the prosecution produced and
examined as many as ten witnesses, whereafter,
statements of the accused under section 342 Cr.P.C,
were recorded wherein they professed innocence and
false implication, however, neither they wished to be
examined on oath in terms of section 340(2) Cr.P.C,
nor, opted to produce defence evidence. On
conclusion of trial, learned trial Court, vide impugned
judgment, convicted the appellants and sentenced
them, as mentioned above, hence, the instant criminal
appeal.

4, It is pertinent to mention here that the
appellants have filed Cr.M.No.01-D of 2022, seeking
condonation of delay caused in filing the appeal, as
the impugned judgment was passed on 07.12.2021,
whereas the appeal was filed on 04.01.2022. Under
the Anti-Terrorism Act, an appeal against conviction
is to be filed by a convict within fifteen days,

however, in view of the contents of application, same

-4-

is allowed and the delay caused in filing the appeal is

condoned.

5. We have heard the learned counsel
representing the appellants, the learned State Counsel
assisted by learned private counsel at length and with
their valuable assistance, the record was scanned.

6. Although the learned trial Court after
appraisal of evidence has recorded judgment of
conviction, however, this being appellate Court, is
under legal obligation to re-assess the already assessed
evidence in order to determine that whether the
prosecution successfully proved its case against the
appellants beyond any reasonable doubt and as to
whether the occurrence had taken place in the mode
and manner as portrayed by the prosecution.

7. Scanning of the record reveals that the
occurrence in the present case allegedly occurred on
13.7.2021 at 23:30 hours at Tank-Jandola road near
Custom Pump, whereas the matter was reported by
the complainant PW-2 on 14.7.2021 at 6:45 hours,
which is belied by the complainant himself in his
cross examination where he stated that after the
occurrence he reached to the police station in one
hour as the police station was already known to him.
The prosecution produced and cxamined the
complainant, the alleged abductee Muhammad Faraz

and their companion Javed Ullah as PW-2, PW-3
®@

o Bis

and PW-8, respectively, however, they admitted in
unequivocal terms that at the time of occurrence the
accused were muffled face.

8. The first question for determination is
identification parade of the accused conducted by
Judicial Magistrate (PW-9) in Sub-Jail Tank and
Central Prison, D.J.Khan, wherein the alleged
abductee Muhammad Faraz (PW-3) allegedly
identified the appellants. There is no denial of the
fact that the occurrence occurred at night time and at
the time of occurrence the accused were muffled
face, however, no features of the accused have been
mentioned in the FIR. As per prosecution version,
the abductee was allegedly released by the accused
on 16.7.2021, whereafier, he came to police station
where his statement under Section 161, Cr.P.C. was
recorded wherein he charged the accused by
mentioning their identification marks and
descriptions. Now the question arises that when the
accused had muffled their faces at the time of
occurrence, then subsequently how they could be
identified by the alleged abductee during
identification parade conducted with a delay of
almost twenty days. Moreso, prior to holding the
identification parade, the appellants were produced
before the learned Judge Anti-Terrorism Court,

D.I.Khan on 23.7.201, 24.7.2021 and 28.7.2021,
@)

wiGre

therefore, the possibility of disclosing their
appearance to the identifier could not be ruled out.
In such view of the matter, no importance could be
attached to the identification parade. Besides, the
identifier did not point out the specific role played
by the appellants in the crime. It is by now well
settled that in order to make an identification parade
reliable, the identifier must assign the specific role,
which each of the perpetrator has played in the
crime. As the identification parade is silent on the
ibid aspect and had taken place at a belated stage of
the appellants' arrest, therefore, no explicit reliance
could be placed thereupon for the safe
administration of justice.
The Honourable Supreme Court of

Pakistan in a case reported as “Noor Islam Vs.
Ghani-ur-Rehman and another” (2020 SCMR 310)
has held that:-

“In this case, the police arrested several

suspects and the only piece of evidence

on which the two foras below relied, is

the identification parade, conducted in

the Central Jail where the appellant was

identified however, beside being the

weakest piece of evidence it loses its

judicial efficacy because the face

feature complexion etc. were not given

in the report”.

In case reported as “Mian Sohail Ahmed

and others Vs. The State others” (2019 SCMR 956),

it has been held that:-

Fa oo

5, The Test Identification Parade
("TIP") (Ex/PN) which was conducted
by the Special Judicial Magistrate (PW-
13) on 13.6.2006 is fraught with several
infirmities diminishing its probative and
evidentiary value. Brief description of
the two unknown persons (later on
identified as the appellants) in the first
information report mentions their
height, bodily size and colour of the
skin. TIP proceedings are silent
regarding the description of the
unknown accused given by the
complainant in the report. TIP can only
commence, once suspects matching the
description in the crime report or in the
statements of the witnesses under
section 161, Cr.P.C. have been arrested.
Matching the description in the first
information report is the starting point
towards identification of the unknown
accused. It is, therefore, uncertain how
the appellants were hurled and lined-up
for the identification parade without the
Magistrate _first matching the
description given by the complainant.
Selection of the suspects, without any
correlation with description of the
accused in the first information report,
raises doubts and makes the
identification proceedings unsafe and
doubtful rendering the identification
evidence inconsequential. This is just a
shade apart from cases where there is
no description of the accused in the
FIR, the effect being the same, casting
doubts on the credibility of the test
identification parade. See
State/Government of Sindh v. Sobharo
(1993 SCMR 585), Muhammad Afzal
alias Abdullah v. State (2009 SCMR
436), Sabir Ali alias Foji v. State (2011
SCMR 563) and Muhammad Abdul
Hafeez v. State of A.P. (AIR 1983 SC
367).

In view of case law referred to above, the

alleged identification parade has lost its evidentiary

-

ais
value, which could not be relied upon for sustaining
conviction.

9, The second question for determination is
recovery of pair of Chappal which was allegedly
given to the abductee by the accused and has been
made the basis for awarding conviction to the
appellants by learned trial Court. At this stage, learned
counsel for the appellants submitted that such type of
recovery could not be made the basis for awarding
conviction, as the same could easily be made available
from the open market. He further submitted that no
identification parade of the Chappel was conducted
through the alleged abductce, therefore, it has lost its
evidentiary value. Although shopkeeper appeared
before the Court as PW-1 and stated that said pair of
chappel was purchased by accused Muhammad
Noman on 16.7.2021 @ Rs.450/-, however, same
could not be made the basis for awarding sentence to
the appellants for the reason that such type chappel are
easily available in open market, especially when no
identification of the same has been conducted through

the alleged abductee.

-9-
10. Besides the above, none from the locality
where the abductee was allegedly confined in a house,
was cited as witness to confirm that after the
occurrence till his release by the accused, they had
seen the abductee in the company of appellants.
Although the Investigating Officer while appearing
before the Court as PW-9, during cross examination
stated that the house where the abductee was confined
was owned by one Sultan Masood, however, said
Sultan Masood has not been cited as witness to
confirm that the abductee was confined in the house
owned by him, PW-9 further admitted that he had not
recorded statement of anyone to confirm the factum of
roaming around of the accused near the house where
the abductee was confined. In this view of the matter,
when no independent evidence is available on file to
corroborate the statements of alleged abductee and the
Investigating Officer, it could hardly be believed that
the appellants were involved in the commission of
offence.
11. The overall impact of what has been
discussed above is that the prosecution has

miserably failed to establish the case against the

appellants, otherwise to extend benefit of doubt so
xf

26 =

many circumstances are not required to be brought
forth. In this regard, guidance has been sought from
a judgment reported as Tariq Pervez v. The State
(1995 SCMR_1345), wherein it has been held that,
“The concept of benefit of doubt to any accused
person is deep rooted in our country. For giving him
benefit of doubt, it is not necessary that there should
be many circumstances creating doubts. If there is a
circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a
prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then the
accused will be entitled to the benefit not as a matter
of grace and concession but as a matter of right”. The
instant criminal appeal is, therefore, allowed, the
impugned judgment is set aside, the appellants are
acquitted of the charges levelled against them, They
shall be released forthwith, if nol required to be

detained in connection with any other case.

order of even date. W
