ORDER

Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J.- Syed Zulfigar, 42, was

shot dead during the night between 27/28-1-2015 within the precincts
of Police Station Qaidabad, Quetta; the appellant conveyed information
to deceasedâ€™s brother Jawad Hussain (PW-1) who attended the casualty
in Civil Hospital Quetta. A solitary fire shot on the right side of face was
opined as fatal. The complainant named the appellant as suspect
without citing any motive for the crime.

Indicted before the learned Addl. Sessions Judge-II Quetta, the
appellant claimed trial, pursuant whereto, the prosecution produced a
number of witnesses, complainant being the most prominent of them,
who reiterated his case in the witness-box. The appellant confronted
prosecution evidence with a denial, blaming the deceased, a drug
addict, to have committed suicide, albeit in the premises they lived
together. The learned trial Judge proceeded vide judgment dated
24.11.2016 to convict the appellant under clause (b) of section 302 of
Criminal Appeal Nos. 15-Q & 16-Q of 2020 2

the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced the appellant to
imprisonment for life with a direction to pay compensation, upheld by a
learned Judge-in-Chamber of the High Court of Balochistan vide
impugned judgment dated 03.09.2018, being assailed through leave of
the Court.

2. Learned counsel for the appellant contends that entire
prosecution case is structured upon a misconceived and misplaced
suspicion as there is no eye witness of the occurrence and no other
than the appellant himself informed the complainant about the suicidal
death of the deceased being his friend with whom he lived in the same
premises; he has further argued that it was appellant himself who
brought the deceased to the hospital in a bid to save his live; mere fact
that the deceased lived with the appellant by itself is no proof that the
appellant committed the crime. Contrarily, the learned Law Officer,
assisted by counsel for the complainant, argued that the deceased
resided with the appellant and it was within his exclusive knowledge as
to what befell upon him as the story of suicide is negated by medical
evidence whereunder the medical officer ruled out possibility of suicide
pursuant to cross-examination conducted on behalf of the appellant; he
adds that recovery of a .9 mm pistol wedded with the casing secured
from the spot, in the totality of circumstances, constituted proof beyond
doubt sufficient to sustain the conviction.

3. Heard. Record perused

4. Complainant is not an eye witness of the crime nor anyone
else came forward to disclose the circumstances leading to the
unnatural death of the deceased. It is also a common ground that the
appellant not only took the deceased to the hospital but also informed
the complainant at an odd hour of the night. Locale of injury being the
face below the right eye with blackened margins is a possible choice for
a person hell bent to take his own life. There is no positive opinion by
the medical officer that ruled out the possibility of suicide; the
conviction is based upon an indiscreet suggestion by defence lawyer
with a grievous inaptitude and, thus, the appellant should not be
allowed to be victim of a bad choice of his defence. Totality of
circumstances fails to qualify to sustain the capital charge. Mystery of
the occurrence is fraught with doubts and, thus, it would be unsafe to
maintain the conviction. Criminal Appeal No.15-Q of 2020 is allowed;

the impugned judgments of the courts below are set aside; the appellant
Criminal Appeal Nos. 15-Q & 16-Q of 2020 3

is acquitted of the charge; he has already been ordered to be released
forthwith, if not required to be detained in any other case.

Criminal Appeal No.16-Q of 2020 stands dismissed as not

pressed.
