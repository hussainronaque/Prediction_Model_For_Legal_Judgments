and one primes card was recovered, they were
arrested on the spot. On cursory interrogation, it was
disclosed to the police that the accused who
decamped from the pot was wanted to the police in
case FIR No.6 dated 16.02.2017, under Sections
302, 353, 404, 427, 148, 149, 21G), 214) PPC/7
ATA. The accused-petitioners applied for post arrest
bail before the learned lower Court which was
declined vide order dated 28.7.2017, hence this
petition.

3. The learned counsel for the petitioners
mainly argued that actually the accused-petitioners
were arrested from their houses on 23.3.2017 which
fact is evident from the application of Muhammad
Naseem, father of Muhammad Awais and Nasreen
Bibi wife of Muhammad Saleem and sister-in-law of
Kaleem, wherein it was alleged that on 23.3.2017 at
11:00 p.m, their houses were raided by the police
without any lawful authority and took away
Rs:9,00,000/- cash which were kept for the purpose
of Hajj and also the male members of the family of
the applicants. He next contended that there is no
reasonable ground to believe that the accused-
petitioners have committed the offence, but there is

sufficient scope of further inquiry into their guilt.

4. As against that, the learned Asstt: A.G.
representing the State, contended that the accused
were caught red-handed and explosive materials
were recovered from their personal possession
which reasonably connects them with the
commission of offence. He lastly contended that the
offence with which the accused-petitioners are
charged, falls within the prohibition contained in
Section 497, Cr.P.C, therefore, they do not deserve
the concession of bail.

5. Arguments heard and record perused.

6. Vide order dated 29.8.2017, the record
of application submitted by wife of the accused
Muhammad Kaleem and Muhammad Saleem was
requisitioned from the office of the Superintendent
of Police CTD, D.I.Khan Region. The application of
father of the petitioner (Muhammad Awais) was
duly entered vide No.535/CTD dated 17.4.2017 and
the application of the wife of accused Muhammad
Saleem was entered vide No.1225 dated 17.4.2017,
which was sent to the District Police Officer vide
No.816/CTD DJI.Khan dated 19.4.2017. After
receipt of the same, the SHO CTD vide his
comments dated 18.4.2017, denied the arrest of the

accused, however, no inquiry/investigation was
Kifayat/*

-5-

conducted about the incident of abduction of the
petitioners from their houses, as alleged by the
complainant party.

7. Facts and circumstances of the case
suggest that the investigation was one-sided and
other aspects of vital importance were not touched
much less investigated into without any explanation
offered by the Investigating Officer, therefore, the
case of the accused-petitioners falls within the ambit
of subsection (2) of Section 497, Cr.P.C. In this
respect, reference can well be made on the case of
Muhammad Noman Vs. The State and another
(2017 SCMR-560), wherein it was held as under:-

“---§, 497(2)---Anti-Terrorism Act
(XXVII of 1997), Ss. 7 & 9---Pakistan
Arms Ordinance (XX of 1965), Ss. 13-
2(A) & 20---Explosive Substances Act
(VI of 1908), S. 4---Acts of terrorism,
possession of illegal weapons,
explosives and time-bomb---Bail,
grant of---Further inquiry---Counter-
Terrorism Department alleged that
accused and co-accused persons were
arrested while travelling in a car, that
contained arms, ammunition, bombs,
explosives and militant literature---
Family of accused on the other hand
alleged that accused was picked up
from his housel by some unknown
persons and _ subsequently police
showed his arrest; that the incident of
accused’s abduction was immediately
reported to the police, and that a
habeas corpus petition was also filed to
find the whereabouts of the accused
after his abduction--- Written complaint
Kifayat/*

-6-

submitted by family of accused about
his abduction from his house, was
neither inquiry into nor investigated in
any manner whatsoever, rather the
same was deliberately suppressed by
the police---Investigating officer had
not opined that the accused was found
connected with any militant group or
had been found financer or provided
any other facility to militants---
Investigation/inquiry carried out was
neither satisfactory nor free from
malice and the accused’s implication
in present case was not free from
reasonable doubt, thus, he could not be
left at the mercy of the police---
Investigation, in the present case, was
one-sided and the other aspects of vital
importance were not touched much
less investigated into without any
explanation offered by the
investigating officer---Case of the
accused was one of further inquiry into
his guilt”.

8. In the instant case, no material was
brought on record to show that the accused were
found connected with any militant group or had been
found financer or provided any other facility to
militants.

9. Admittedly, the petitioners were
arrested on 11.7.2017, and their alleged confessional
statements were recorded by District Police on
17.7.2017. The question of its voluntariness or
otherwise before a person who could never be
thought to be independent, impartial, non-partisan

and separated from those who were entrusted with
Kifayat/*

-7-

the job of investigation, is alarming, and is left to be
decided by the trial Court after recording evidence.
10. In view of what has been discussed
above, this bail petition is allowed and the accused-
petitioners are directed to be released on bail subject
to furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs:3,00,000/-
with two sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of learned trial Court, who shall ensure
that the sureties must be local, reliable and men of
means.

Announced.
