criminal appeal, the accused/appellant, Ubaid

93 dated, 17.10.2020, U/S 302 PPC, PS,

F.S. S, (Thana), District Malakand.

2. Reportedly, the complainant,
Muhammad Sajid reported the subject event to
the local police at emergency ward, Thana
hospital in terms that on the fateful day, he
(complainant) along with his mother, Mst.

Chaman Bibi (deceased) & other inmates were

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-2-

present in their residential unit, whereas, their
father was out of station. On the relevant date,
day & time, his brother, Ubaid Khan (the
accused/appellant herein) started altercation
with his mother on the domestic issues. His
brother, Ubaid Khan duly armed with an axe hit
his mother Mst. Chaman Bibi on her head. As a
result of the axe blow, she was severely injured,
fell-down on the ground and died on the spot.
The heartbreaking event was witnessed by the
inmates i.e. the complainant and his sister, Mst.
Irum Bibi. Motive for the commission of
offence was stated to be a domestic dispute
(ne 3US she),

3. In view of the report of the
complainant, the ‘Murasila’ (Ex. PA/1) was
drafted which culminated into the ibid FIR
(Ex. PA) registered against the accused/

appellant at P.S concerned.

4, Upon arrest of the accused/
appellant followed by completion of
investigation, challan was drawn and was sent-
up for trial to the learned trial Court. Accused/

appellant was confronted with the statement of

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Necem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
oo

-3-

allegations through formal charge-sheet to

which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

5. To substantiate the guilt of the
accused/appellant, the prosecution furnished its
account consist of the statements of nine (09)
witnesses. The accused was confronted with the
evidence so furnished through statement of
accused within the meaning of section 342

Cr.P.C.

6. On conclusion of the proceedings/
trial, in view of the evidence so recorded and
the assistance so rendered by the learned
counsel for the accused/appellant and the
learned counsel for the complainant/learned
State counsel, the learned trial Court arrived at
the conclusion that the prosecution has
successfully brought home charge against the
appellant/accused through cogent & worth
reliable evidence, as such, the accused was

convicted & sentenced as follows;-

U/S 302 (b) PPC as T’azir & sentenced to
imprisonment for life, along with compensation in
the sum of Rs. 500,000/- (five hundred thousand),
U/S 544-A Cr.P.C, in default of payment of the
compensation, the accused shall further undergo
six months imprisonment. The compensation shall
be recoverable as arrears of land revenue from the
person & estate of accused.

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
-4-
The accused/appellant has also been extended the
benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C.

7. It obliged the appellant/accused to
approach this Court through the subject Jail

criminal appeal

8. Learned counsel for the
accused/appellant as well as the learned Astt:
A.G for the State have been heard at a length
and the record gone through with their

valuable assistance.

9, There is no denial at all that in
the subject event the accused/appellant, Ubaid
Khan has been charged by the complainant/
respondent for committing the murder of his
real mother Mst. Chaman Bibi and that too
inside their residential unit in the presence of
other inmates i.e. legal heirs of the deceased
son & daughter. Needless to highlight that the
accused/appellant and the complainant are
real brothers inter-se, therefore, there is no
chance of misidentification or false
implication qua the guilt of the accused/
appellant coupled with the fact that not only
the matter was reported to the local police

with utmost promptitude i.e. within one hour

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-5-

but in the event in hand a single accused was
charged for inflicting axe blow injury on the

head of his real mother.

10. Other than the above, in the case
in hand the ocular-account has been furnished
by the complainant, Muhammad Sajid. He
appeared in the witness-box as PW-6 and Mst.
Irum Bibi, daughter of the deceased, she
recorded her statement as PW-5. The
testimonies of both the witnesses are quite
natural as they have narrated the real facts in
respect of the murder of their mother at the
hands of nobody else but their real bother i.e.
the accused/appellant. Both the witnesses
overcome the searching & lengthy
examination-in-cross of the learned defence
counsel but the probative worth of their
accounts qua the guilt of the accused/
appellant could not be shattered in any
manner, whatsoever. It is an admitted fact on
both ends that the subject event has taken
place inside the house of the complainant-
party and the accused/appellant is also not a

stranger to the aggrieved party as he is

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
\

-6-
nobody else but the real brother of the

complainant, therefore, the presence of PW-5
& PW-6 being inmates of the same house
could not be excluded on any stretch of
imagination. In the circumstances, if the
assailant was stranger to the complainant-
party then the situation might have been
different altogether, which is not the case
here, therefore, in view of the peculiar facts &
circumstances of the subject event the
accounts of both the eyewitnesses are prima
facie in line with the version of the
prosecution. Even otherwise, it is a common
custom, culture and tradition that inhabitants
of the joint family do reside in their common
residential unit and on this score, the presence
of the male & female inmates in their house is
quite natural & appealable to a prudent mind,
as such, the presence of PW-5 & PW-6 at the
scene of occurrence could neither be
underestimated, doubted or excluded. In a
situation akin to the present one, the Apex
Court in case titled “Muhammad Akbar alias

Bhola_& others v/ The State _& others”

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-7-
reported as 2019 SCMR 2036 had taken into

consideration the ocular account of three eye-
witness, out of whom two of them were
natural witnesses being inmates of the same
house, wherein the occurrence had taken
place. Similarly, in case titled “Muhammad
Ashraf v/s The State” reported as 2021
SCMR 758, the Apex Court has also affirmed
the same rational by observing that witnesses
being inmates of the premise themselves had
no axe to grind against the accused nor were
expected to swap the actual offender with an
innocent person, as there was nothing on the
record to even obliquely entertain any theory

of substitution.

11. As far as the account of PW-7,
Misal Khan, (husband of the deceased lady
Mst. Chaman Bibi) is concerned, suffice it to
say, he denied his presence at the spot at the
relevant time as he was working as watchmen
in the CNG station. It was also the stance of
the complainant that on the fateful day when
his mother was done to death by his brother,

his father i.e. Misal Khan (PW-7) was not

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon"ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
-8-

present in their house. PW-7 was not only
declared hostile witness on the request of the
learned State counsel but he was also cross-
examined by the prosecution, therefore, the
non-presence of PW-7 at the scene of crime at
the relevant time would be of no consequence
qua the guilt of the accused/appellant
especially in presence of the testimonies of
the other two eyewitnesses, who were also
inmates of the same house where the

occurrence has taken place.

12. In the circumstances, the direct
account of the witnesses being not only the
inmates of the house but also members of the
same family, identity of the assailant by the
natural witnesses can no way be under
estimated rather the remote chance of even

misidentification can safely be excluded.

13. The medical evidence furnished
by PW-1, Dr. Ali Muhammad further boost &
substantiates the version of the prosecution.
As per medical-legal report of the deceased,
Ex.PW-1/1 the cause of death of the deceased

was Head trauma and the nature of wound

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-9-

was blunt, which is exactly in consonance
with the story of the prosecution for the
reason that the appellant/accused is facing the
allegations to have given blow of the
handle/lever of the axe to his mother, resulted
into her unnatural death. The medical
evidence on this score further boost &
supports the stance of the prosecution. Even
otherwise, it is well settled that corroboration
by itself is only rule of caution and not a rule _
of law. If testimony of an eyewitness is found
reliable & trustworthy then there is hardly any
need to look for any corroboration. In this
regard, reliance is placed on the case law

titled “ Muhammad Waris v/s The State”

reported as 2008 SCMR_784. Similarly, it

was also held by the Apex Court in case titled

“Shafat Ali & others v/s The State” reported

as PLD 2005 Supreme Court 288 that as far

as medical evidence or expert’s opinion was
concerned, it was always treated to be
confirmatory in nature and if there was ocular

account fully reliable in support of incident,

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'bie Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
-10-

then the minor contradictions in medical and

ocular account, if any, could be outweighed.

14, The case in hand is also having
sufficient circumstantial evidence in the form of
recovery of weapon of offence i.e. axe,
allegedly recovered on the pointation of the

complainant and blood stained garments of the

deceased as well as that of the complainant/
respondent, therefore, the circumstantial evidence
further provides added vigor to the story of the

prosecution.

15. The prosecution has also been able
to establish motive which was stated to be a
domestic dispute (~¢5Ui sh 48), therefore, on
this score too, the case of the prosecution find

its positive support from the said angle.

16. As a result of cumulative effect of
evidence of the prosecution, the Court has
reached to the conclusion that the accused/
appellant has rightly been found guilty of
commission of the offence, however, his sentence
of life imprisonment requires a rethinking. It is
part of the record & as highlighted by the learned

counsel for the appellant/accused that the

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-ll-

occurrence took place at the spur of the moment
and as per medico-legal report of the deceased,
Ex. PW-1/1 a wound (4-5 cm) was found on
temporal region with hematoma but no active
bleeding and “bone was not exposed”’, therefore,
prima facie it seems that the accused/appellant
was having no premeditation or intention to harm
his mother or for that matter inflicted a life-
threatening injury on her person rather it appears
that the occurrence took place at the spur of the
moment coupled with the fact that the deceased
had received a single blow, as highlighted above.
It is also part of the record and as evident from
the eye-account of PW-5, Mst. Irum Bibi that the
accused/appellant after the unfortunate incident
took his injured mother in his lap and
accompanied her dead body to the hospital. In
order to inculcate the natural conduct &
repentance of the accused/appellant over his sin
after the commission of the offence, the relevant
part of examination-in-chief of PW-5 is
reproduced as under;-

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan

-12-
No doubt, the Statute is clear

enough regarding the quantum of sentence but it
shall not skip the attention of the Court that
normal punishment under the Statute shall be
another fatal blow to the bereaved family, has
lost their mother followed by their brother, as
such, in the peculiar facts & circumstances of the
event lesser punishment shall meet the ends of
justice.

17. During the course of investigation,
the Investigation Officer collected garments of
the accused/appellant vide recovery memo, Ex.
PW-8/3, which was also having blood spots
(e®2,S O54) allegedly of the deceased, Mst.
Chaman Bibi, therefore, it shows that he did not
escape from the venue of crime i.e. the house in
question rather he took his injured mother in his
lap (258) and thereafter accompanied her dead
body to the hospital, as such, the very conduct &
demeanor of the accused/appellant is quite
natural. On all counts, all these minor
weaknesses & lacunas in the evidence of
prosecution, as discussed hereinabove, may not
be taken as a justification for the out-right
acquittal of the accused/appellant, but such

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan

-]3-

weaknesses may be considered for reduction of
the sentence as held by the Apex Court in case
titled “Mst Bevi_v/s Ghulam Shabbir and
another” reported as “1980 SCMR_ 859”,
wherein, it has been observed;-

“It has been held in some cases that the principle
underlying the concept of benefit of doubt can in
addition to the consideration of question of guilt or
otherwise, be pressed also in matter of sentence. As
a definite motive was asserted against the
respondent and the same has failed, keeping in view
all the circumstances of this case, it would not be
necessary to impose the capita’ punishment.
Therefore while finding him guilty; under section
302, P. P. C. he is sentenced to transportation for life
should be awarded as compensation.”

A similar rational has also been

expounded by the Apex Court in case titled
“Mir Muhammad alias Miro v/s The State”
reported as 2009 SCMR_ 1188. Further

reliance may also be placed on judgments in

case titled “Muhammad Ayaz Khan v/s
Murtaza and other” reported as 2008 SCMR 984
and case titled “Kamran Ullah v/s The State and
another” reported as 2020 SCMR 1214.

18. Similarly, in eventuality when an
accused person committed an offence without
any premeditation or planning and in the heat of a
free-fight had struck the deceased with a single
blow. In such circumstances, his case would

come within clause (c) of section 302, PPC.

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-14-
Conviction of accused recorded U/S 302 (b) PPC

was altered to one U/S 302 (c) PPC and
consequently, his sentence of life imprisonment
was reduced to ten years imprisonment.

Reference can be made to the case law Titled

“Zeeshan alias Shani V/S The State (PLD 2017

Supreme Court 165). Needless to highlight that

in the event in hand, the accused/appellant was

also confronted with the same set of allegations,

as not only the occurrence took at the spur of the

moment but the deceased had also received a

single blow. All such circumstances are taken as

i sufficient justification for reduction of the

Sy sentence from the normal penalty of life
imprisonment to ten years imprisonment.

19. In view of the above discussion and

exposition of law, the subject criminal appeal is

partially allowed to the extent that the sentence of

life imprisonment awarded to the accused/

appellant, Ubaid Khan, U/S 302 (b) PPC is

reduced to ten (10) years imprisonment within

the meaning of section 302 (c) PPC. The benefit

of section 382-B Cr.P.C is also extended to the

appellant/accused, whereas, the rest of the

impugned order/judgment dated 31.05.2022 to

the extent of imposition of compensation in the

remain intact.
