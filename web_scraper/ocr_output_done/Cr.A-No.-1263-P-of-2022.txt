2. Brief facts giving rise to the instant criminal appeal are

that the complainant-Shaukat Hussain reported to the local police

of Police Post Chamtar to the effect that his brother went missing
on 17.07.2018, and that in that respect the information was

entered in Naqal Mad No.07, dated 19.07.2018, with police post

Chamtar, district Mardan. After receiving information, the

inquiry was permitted u/s 156(3) Cr.P.C, but, during inquiry it

surfaced that the deceased was last found in village Doshera and

thereafter the link was broken, as such the incharge PP Chamtar

reported the matter to the police high-ups and requested for

transfer of the inquiry to the concerned police station and as such

permission was granted and the inquiry was handed over to the

police of Police Station Sardheri, District Charsadda. It was

during the inquiry that the local police of Police Post Aziz Abad

contacted several suspects including the appellants and others. It

was during inquiry that the appellant-Wajid Ali admitted the

murder of the deceased in collusion with his other co-accused

including, one Nadeem s/o Jamshed, and Jamshed s/o Abdur

Razak, alongwith Mst. Shaheen w/o Jamshed. He further

disclosed that after the deceased was killed, his dead body was

buried with the help of the co-accused-Nadeem and that the

motorcycle and slippers (chappal) of the deceased were thrown

away from the place of his killing. Motive was disclosed as illicit
relationship between the deceased and Mst. Safia. The convict-

appellant led the police party to the place where the dead body

was buried and after confirming the same, the murasila was

drafted on the spot, which was incorporated in the FIR ibid.

3. During investigation, accused-Wajid Ali, Jamshed &

Nadeem were arrested, whereas the co-accused could not be

arrested as they went into hiding. Challan was submitted,

formalities u/s 265-C Cr.P.C, were complied with by handing

over the requisite record to the accused. Charge was framed, to

which they did not plead guilty and claimed trial. Trial

commenced, which ended into the conviction of the appellant

vide the impugned judgment.

4. Heard. Record perused.

5. It was on 19.07.2018, when one Shoukat Hussain reported

the matter regarding the missing of his brother, to the incharge of

Police Post Chamtar, which was incorporated in Daily Dairy

No.7. The complainant while reporting the matter explained the

circumstances in which the deceased left the house and did not

come back. On the basis of information conveyed by the

complainant, inquiry u/s 156 (3) Cr.P.C, was initiated and that in
that respect the statements of numerous people were recorded.

Though initially, no positive evidence was available with the

prosecution, but when the SIMs in possession of the deceased

were tried, the investigating agency succeeded in tracing him

near Doshera Bazar, District Charsadda. The matter was probed

into and ultimately it surfaced that the deceased was last found in

the vicinity of police station Sardheri, and thereafter the link was

broken. When the police realized that the case pertains to the

Police Station Sardheri, District Charsadda, it was on request of

the incharge of the Police Post Chamtar, that the inquiry was

handed over to the police of district Charsadda, for further probe.

The task was finally assigned to the incharge of police post Aziz

Abad and as such the process of inquiry was kept continued.

Numerous people including the appellants were asked to appear

and as such on their appearance, they were interrogated regarding

their relationship with the accused, and after getting satisfied

numerous suspects were exonerated, whereas it was during

inquiry that the appellant-Wajid Ali admitted his guilt and

explained the circumstances which led to the death of the

deceased and as such he pointed out the place where the dead
body was buried and on his pointation a .30 bore pistol near from

the place of occurrence was recovered and a spade from inside

the sugarcane crop. The police of police station Risalpur

succeeded in taking into possession the motorcycle belonging to

the deceased and his footwear (chappal) were also taken into

possession, the same was later on handed over to the police of the

concerned police station. During investigation the appellant

disclosed the names of his co-accused and as such they were also

implicated as accused in the instant case. It is pertinent to

mention that the appellants-Nadeem & Jamshed, were arrested

and out of the two it was the appellant-Nadeem who pointed out

the place of incident and the place where the spade was thrown,

but nothing was recovered on his pointation. When the appellant

led the police party to the place where the dead body was buried

and when the place was confirmed, then the investigating officer

requested the District & Sessions Judge, Charsadda, for

permission to disinter the dead body. The application was

allowed and the concerned Judicial Magistrate was directed to do

the needful, who in turn permitted the Area Magistrate to go for

exhumation and to arrange the needed officials. It was one Akbar
Ali, Senior Civil Judge, who undertook the errand on 18.08.2018.

The magistrate visited the spot in the company of the police

officials, the doctor, forensic expert and also the legal heirs of the

deceased, and as such the process of exhumation was carried out,

the dead body was unearthed and the postmortem was conducted.

It is pertinent to mention that though some portion of the body

was decomposed, yet rest of the body was perfect and

identifiable. These were the legal heirs of the deceased who

identified the dead body and the learned Judicial Magistrate

prepared a comprehensive report in that respect. The report was

duly exhibited and the learned Magistrate highlighted the

material aspects of the case, right from their arrival to the spot till

the dead body was handed over to the legal heirs. The report is

comprehensive which contains the details regarding the

precautions taken by the concerned Magistrate and also the

fulfillment of legal formalities for the purpose. From the place of

the incident, blood stained earth was collected and also a portion

from the blood stained garments of the deceased was taken into

possession. The collected pieces were sent to the laboratory, a

report was received that the same were of the same human group.
6. When the period of granted custody expired, the appellant

was produced before the court of Judicial Magistrate where he

opted to confess his guilt and as such his confessional statement

was recorded, where he explained the manner in which the

deceased was done to death and the manner in which the dead

body was pointed out and thereafter he was sent to the concerned

judicial lockup, the trial commenced and on conclusion of the

trial, the appellants were convicted vide the impugned judgment.

7. The learned Trial Court took into consideration the

material aspects of the case and also took pain to go through the

record of the case as well as statements of the witnesses, and

ultimately, after application of its judicial mind, convicted the

appellants. There is no denial to the fact that the instant case

hinges upon the circumstantial evidence and the confessional

statement of the appellant-Wajid Ali, but there is no denial to the

fact that in support of its claim the prosecution succeeded in

collecting different pieces of evidence which ultimately decided

the fates of all responsible. Though one of the appellant

confessed his guilt and that it was he who led the police party to

the place where the dead body was buried, to the place
wherefrom a .30 bore pistol was recovered and to the places

where the motorcycle and footwear of the deceased were thrown

and were taken into possession by the local police. We are

confident in holding that the evidence collected by the

prosecution is circumstantial and that sole reliance cannot be

placed on the same until and unless corroborated. Besides, the

circumstantial evidence, we have the confessional statement of

the appellant, which must be read in juxtaposition with the

circumstantial evidence and thereafter this Court would be in a

better position to determine as to whether the prosecution

succeeded in bringing home guilt against the appellants and as to

whether both pieces of evidence supported each other to such an

extent which led to the conviction of the appellants. This Court is

to determine as to whether the collected pieces of evidence were

from independent sources and that the confessional statement of

the appellant was true and voluntary. True that the learned Trial

Court was influenced with certain recoveries and the confessional

statement of the appellant, but equally true that the courts of law

must seek for independent corroboration, so that miscarriage of

justice could be avoided. As in the case in hand the learned Trial
10

Court awarded the normal penalty of death, so this Court deems

it its obligation to scan through the record to know, as to whether

the approach of the learned Trial Court was correct and was in

accordance with law.

8. The questions for determination before this Court are as to

whether the incident occurred in the mode, manner and at the

stated time, as to whether the prosecution succeed in collecting

different pieces of evidence and the knitted net, led to the

involvement of the accused charged; as to whether the dead body

was recovered on pointation of the appellant-Wajid Ali and as to

whether the legal requirements for the same were complied with.

This Court is further to see as to whether the co-accused were in

league with the appellant-Wajid Ali, and as to whether the

deceased was done to death owing to his illicit relationship with

Mst. Safia d/o Jamshed. We are further to see as to whether the

accused/appellant (Wajid Ali) confessed his guilt and that the

learned Magistrate observed the legal formalities.

9. The prosecution is to tell as to whether it was the appellant

who killed the deceased and as to whether the appellant was in

league with his co-accused and that the motive was the illicit
11

relationship between the deceased and his sister-in-law. It is

interesting to note that the deceased was engaged to one Mst.

Sana, daughter of the appellant-Jamshed, but the family was

suspecting the deceased of having illicit relationship with the

sister of his fiancée. True that the investigating officer failed to

collect independent evidence in respect of the alleged motive and

equally true that neither the statements of Mst. Sana, nor that of

Mst. Safia were recorded, but that by itself is not sufficient to

discard the collected evidence on file. We are conscious of the

fact that the case is hinging upon the circumstantial evidence and

that the prosecution is under the boundened duty to prove on

record that the circumstances when brought together created an

organic whole. We are further to see that what led to the

conviction of the appellant and that what evidence was taken into

consideration. There is no denial to the fact that it was the

appellant-Wajid Ali, who during inquiry disclosed that it was he

who killed the deceased with the help and connivance of his other

co-accused. Not only he admitted his guilt, at the time of his

arrest, but also led the police party to the place where the dead

body was buried and to the places where the pistol and spade
12

were thrown. It was on his pointation that the dead body was

recovered. It was voiced for the appellant that neither

independent evidence was produced, nor the circumstantial

evidence was collected from the independent sources and that the

impugned judgment is the outcome of haste and without the

application of judicial mind. It was further submitted that despite

the fact that the most relevant witnesses were available with the

prosecution, but their statements were not recorded and that an

adverse inference can be drawn. We are not persuaded with what

the learned counsel for the appellant submitted, as it was the

accused/appellant who led the police party to the place where the

deceased was killed and his dead body was buried and that it was

the accused/appellant on whose pointation the weapon of offence

and the spade used for burial of the deceased were recovered.

Even the appellant-Wajid Ali led the police party to the places

where the motorcycle and footwear of the deceased were thrown.

As the prosecution had no malafide and the complainant was

nourishing no grudge against the accused charged, so the

circumstantial evidence, more particularly, the recovery of the

dead body on pointation of the appellant cannot be discarded.
13

The complainant charged the accused/appellants after the guilt

was admitted and the recoveries were affected. Had the

complainant mala fide to charge, then the accused would have

been charged at the earliest, but when he got satisfied regarding

the involvement of the appellants, then he recorded his statement

u/s 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Had this been the case

of direct evidence, then the non-recording of the statements of

both the sisters would have played a decisive role, but as the case

rests upon the circumstantial evidence, so the absence of their

statement would hardly favour the appellants. We cannot lose

sight of the fact that the place from where the dead body was

recovered is situated inside the fields hardly visited by the

common people and hardly known to the appellants, more

particularly, to the appellant-Wajid Ali. As there was no visible

sign of a grave, so neither we can expect that the local police

would know earlier to the pointation made by the appellant, so

the recoveries & discoveries pursuant to the pointation of the

appellant are the circumstances which should be and which must

be taken into consideration. Even the weapon of offence was
14

recovered when the appellant led the police party to the place

where it was disposed of and also the spade.

10. The witnesses appeared before the Trial Court whose

statements were recorded, but despite searching cross

examination nothing detrimental to the prosecution case, could be

extracted from their mouths. The witnesses were asked and

confronted with different pieces of evidence, but their sequence

could not be broken and no inconsistency could be brought in

their statements. We cannot forget that for exhumation of the

dead body the legal requirements were complied with and it was

after getting permission from the competent court of law, that the

dead body was unearthed, that too, in supervision of the

concerned Judicial Magistrate. The Area Magistrate appeared

before the Trial Court as PW-10, who in his examination-in-chief

explained the circumstances in which the permission was granted

and the dead body was dug out. This witness was examined on

material aspects of the case and he succeeded in bringing on

record that the proceedings were conducted in accordance with

law and that the dead body was duly identified by the legal heirs.

Apart from the Area Magistrate, the concerned doctor, who
15

conducted autopsy on the dead body of the deceased was also

examined, who confirmed that the deceased died due to firearm

injury and that the dead body despite decomposition was

identifiable. When this part of evidence is read in juxtaposition

with the recoveries and discoveries made on pointation of the

appellant, no ambiguity is left that it was the appellant who killed

the deceased and that it was the appellant on whose pointation the

dead body was recovered. Apart from the legal heirs the forensic

report further confirmed the identity of the dead body.

11. We are to see as to what interest the appellant had, in

killing the deceased. The record tells that the accused-Wajid Ali

is the son-in-law of the appellant-Jamshed and that he was

equally related to the family as the deceased was. As the

unfortunate deceased was suspected of having illicit relations

with the sister of his fiancée, so it infuriated the family, more

particularly, the appellant-Wajid Ali, as he thought it a stigma to

his family and as such he committed to kill the deceased. Apart

from the circumstantial evidence, we have the confessional

statement of the appellant which was recorded on 20.08.2019,

soon after his arrest. As the prosecution succeeded in collecting
16

the most reliable pieces of evidence and when the same were

placed together a chain was formed with no link missing. This

Court lurks no doubt in mind that the circumstantial evidence,

where most of the evidence was collected on pointation of the

appellant, is sufficient to hold the appellant responsible for the

tragedy. Reliance is placed on judgment of the Apex Court

reported as P L D 2008 Supreme Court 503, in case title

“MUHAMMAD LATIF Vs the State”, which reads as follows:-

“11. As far the contention of the learned
counsel that upon _ circumstantial
evidence, one cannot be convicted and
awarded the penalty of death, this plea is
also misconceived because there is no bar
or hindrance to pass the sentence upon a
killer of three human beings when the
chain of guilt is found not to be broken
and irresistible conclusion of the guilt is
surfacing from the evidence, which is
connecting the accused with the
commission of that offence without any
doubt or suspicion. If the circumstantial
evidence brought on the record is of such
nature than the conclusion would be in
the shape of conviction and no other
conclusion shall be drawn by any stretch
of imagination in such a case, for the guilt
of the accused, penalty of death or life
imprisonment shall be a normal event.
The following judgments can be cited
with benefits for this proposition.”

12. ‘The record tells that on 20.08.2019, the appellant was

produced before the court of Judicial Magistrate where he opted

to confess his guilt and as such his confessional statement was

recorded. As the confessional statement of the appellant plays a
17

pivotal role in the instant case, so we deem it essential to go

through the same and to get it confirmed that the same was true,

voluntary and that the legal requirements were fulfilled by the

learned Judicial Magistrate.

13. There is no denial to the fact that the appellant was

produced before the court of competent jurisdiction and that he

opted to confess his guilt. It is pertinent to mention that as per

law the questionnaire was prepared, the relevant questions were

put to the appellant and that sufficient time was given to the

appellant to recompose himself. The record further tells that a 30-

minute time was provided to the appellant and that the learned

Judicial Magistrate disclosed his identity to the appellant. Every

step was taken to remove the influence from the mind of the

appellant with an assurance that in case he refuses to confess, he

would not be handed over to the police related to the case. The

learned Judicial Magistrate put his appearance before the Court

as PW-8, who stated that on the relevant day the appellant was

produced before him; surplus people including the police were

asked to leave; that he disclosed his identity to the appellant and

assured the appellant that in case he did not confess his guilt his
18

custody would not be handed over to the investigating officer or

other police officials belonging to the same police station. The

learned Magistrate was cross examined on material aspects of the

case, but nothing could be extracted from his mouth that would

go against the case of the prosecution. We also went through the

requisite formalities observed by the learned Magistrate, where

we did not come across any illegality or irregularity, rather the

learned Magistrate took extra care and extra measures for his

satisfaction and that of the appellant as well. The confessional

statement of the appellant was gone through where we found that

the appellant narrated the events as it occurred and he also

disclosed that it was on his pointation that the dead body was

recovered. He further disclosed that he also led the police party to

the place where the pistol was thrown and to the place where the

spade was disposed of. The coherence in events disclosed by the

appellant while confessing his guilt confirms that the

confessional statement is voluntary and true. The confessional

statement of the appellant lends support to the prosecution case

and it has increased the authenticity of the circumstantial

evidence, which came to surface on the pointation of the
19

appellant. This court lurks no doubt in mind that the appellant

confessed his guilt and that his confessional statement is not only

voluntary but true as well. We are benefited from the

observations rendered by the Apex Court in case titled

“MUHAMMAD TALHA HUSSAIN alias NOMAN and

another Versus the STATE, (PLD 2008 Supreme Court 115),

which is reproduced herein below:-

In the confessional statements the
petitioners have also disclosed their
motives ie. killing of deceased Syed
Zafar Hussain for sectarian reason,
which clearly goes to indicate that they
had made confession voluntarily and
true. So far as delay of 10 days in
recording of confessional statement is
concerned, it would not be fatal in view
of the facts and circumstances of the
case because, per se, for this reason,
confessional statement cannot be
discarded.

14. The cumulative effect of what has been stated above leads

this Court nowhere but to hold that the prosecution succeeded in

bringing home guilt against the appellant and that the learned

Trial Court was fully justified to convict the appellant-Wajid Ali

for the death of the deceased.

15. As the appellant got death penalty to his share, so this

Court is to see as to whether the learned Trial Court was justified

in that respect and as to whether the evidence on file was
20

sufficient to ask for the same. As the prosecution case hinges on

the circumstantial evidence and also upon the confessional

statement of the appellant, so this Court is to see as to what

prompted the appellant to kill the deceased. It is evident from the

record that the appellant-Wajid Ali was equally related to the

house as the deceased was and that he was attached to the family

more than the deceased. As the deceased lost his life because of

the suspected illicit relationship with the sister-in-law of the

appellant, so the same turned to be the cause of his annoyance

and that the feelings went so deep which prompted the appellant

to kill the deceased. On one hand if we are to admit the

confessional statement of the appellant, then on the other we are

to accept the same in totality. When in his statement the cause is

mentioned as the illicit relationship between the two and as the

appellant while confessing his guilt confirmed the same to be the

cause of killing, so this Court is confident in holding that the

appellant was swayed by his emotion and attachment to the

family. When such is the state of affairs, this Court lurks no

doubt in mind in holding that the learned Trial Court fell into

error on this particular aspect of the case and that its approach to
21

the quantum of sentence is not in accordance with law which

calls for interference. In the like circumstances, we are blessed

with the observations rendered in case title “AKHTAR Versus

The STATE, reported as “2020 S C M R 2020”, which reads

as follows:-

“8. So far as prayer of learned
counsel for the appellant regarding
alternate sentence of imprisonment
for life instead of death is
concerned, it has been observed by
us that the prosecution case is based
upon circumstantial evidence, as has
been discussed in the preceding
paragraphs. Although the conviction
of appellant under section 302(b),
P.P.C. does not call for any
interference by this Court, but
considering the overall
circumstances of the case, we are of
the view that instead of death
sentence, the alternate sentence of
imprisonment for life provided
under section 302(b), P.P.C. shall
meet the ends of justice.”

16. The instant criminal appeal is partly allowed. The

conviction of the appellant-Wajid Ali u/s 302(b) PPC is

maintained, however, his sentence of death is converted into

imprisonment for life, with benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. The

amount of compensation under section 544-A Cr.P.C, as well as

the findings of the court on section 15-AA are left intact,

however, the appellant, in default of payment of compensation,

shall spend 06-months S.I. When the appeal is partly allowed, so
22

the Murder Reference No.28-P of 2022 is answered in

Negative.

17. It is interesting to note that the appellant has also been

convicted under section 201 PPC and this Court is to see, as to

whether the approach of the learned Trial Court was justified on

this particular aspect of the case, we deem it essential to

reproduce section 201 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which reads as

follows:-

“201. Causing disappearance of evidence of
offence, or giving false information to screen
offender__ if a capital offence. Whoever,
knowing or having reason to believe that an offence
has

been committed, causes any evidence of the
commission of that offence to disappear, with the
intention of screening the offender from legal
punishment, or with that intention gives any
information respecting the offence which he knows
or believes to be false, shall, if the offence which
he knows or believes to have been committed is
punishable with death, be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which
may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable
to fine...”

To appreciate this particular aspect of the case, we deem it

essential to note that in section 201 PPC, word ‘offender’ is used,

which means ‘a person who is guilty of a crime’. As in the instant

case it was the appellant-Wajid Ali, who killed the deceased, so

for all practical purposes in this particular case Wajid Ali is the
23

offender and that he by himself cannot be punished under this

section of law, rather the one who helped and facilitated in the

disappearance of evidence shall be held responsible. The

approach of the learned Trial Court to this particular aspect of the

case is against the law which calls for interference. The

conviction & sentence awarded to the appellant-Wajid Ali, u/s

201 PPC, are not sustainable in the eye of law, the same is set-

aside and he is acquitted from the charge u/s 201 of the Pakistan

Penal Code. The like circumstances came before the Apex Court

and the Court was pleased to answer the same in case title

“Ahmad Vs the State”, reported as “2015 SCMR 993”, in the

following manner:-

“5. For what has been discussed above this
appeal is dismissed to the extent of the
appellant's conviction for an offence under
section 302(b), P.P.C. recorded and upheld by
the learned courts below but the same, is partly
allowed to the extent of the appellant's sentence
on that count of the charge which is reduced
from death to imprisonment for life. The benefit
under section 382- B, Cr.P.C. shall be extended
to the appellant. We note that the learned trial
court had also passed a sentence of fine of Rs.
50,000 against the appellant which was utterly
unlawful and what could be done under section
544-A, Cr.P.C, was to order payment of
compensation. The said aspect of the appellant's
sentence is, therefore, modified and it is ordered
that the appellant shall pay a sum of Rs. 50,000
to the heirs of the deceased by way of
compensation and in default of payment thereof
he shall undergo simple imprisonment for six
months. We are also surprised to find that the
learned trial court had also convicted the
24

appellant for an offence under section 201,
P.P.C. and had sentenced him to rigorous
imprisonment for seven years and a fine of
Rs.10,000 for the said offence and in default of
payment of fine he was ordered to undergo
simple imprisonment for three months. This
Court has already clarified that the conviction
for an offence under section 201, P.P.C. cannot
simultaneously be recorded with a conviction for
an offence under section 302, P.P.C. and a
reference in this respect may be made to the case
of Nasar Khan v. The State (2000 SCMR 130). In
this view of the matter the appellant's conviction
and sentence for the offence under section 201,
P.P.C. are set aside. This appeal is disposed of in
these terms.”

While handing down the judgment supra, the Apex Court placed

its reliance on a judgment of the same court, titled as “Nasar

Khan Vs the State”, (2000 SCMR 130), which reads as follows:

“12. Keeping in view the circumstances narrated
above, the prosecution case stands fully
established against the appellant so far as the
murder of Siraj I Muhammad deceased is
concerned, he was, therefore, rightly convicted
and properly punished. However, as regards his
conviction under section 201, P.P.C., it may be
stated that it is a well-settled proposition of law
that an accused charged with the main offence
ie. murder cannot be _ convicted for
disappearance of evidence or offence to screen or
save himself. Farid Muhammad y. The State
(PLD 1959 (W.P.) Peshawar 12) and Gulazr
Khan v. The State (PLD 1963 (W.P.) Peshawar
178) may be cited in this behalf.

In this view of the matter, we accept this appeal
to that extent and set aside the appellant's
conviction and sentence under section 201,
P.P.C. With the above modification the appeal is
otherwise dismissed.”

18. Now diverting to the case of the other appellants ie.

Jamshed & Nadeeem, as the prosecution could not bring on

record any evidence against these appellants, but only the

confessional statement of the co-accused, so this Court is under

the obligation to re-assess the evidentiary value of the recorded

statements, to know as to whether the learned Trial Court was

correct in its approach while convicting these two appellants for

the murder of the deceased and that the learned Trial Court

validly took into consideration the attending circumstances of the

present case. As right from the beginning till the end, no positive

evidence could be collected to link the appellant with the death of

the deceased and even nothing incriminating was recovered on

their pointation, so the only confessional statement of the co-

accused cannot be held the basis for their conviction. As the

confessional statement of the accused can only be taken a

circumstantial evidence against the co-accused who is on joint

trial. When the prosecution failed to collect evidence regarding

their involvement in the episode and when no recovery or

discovery was made on their pointation, then this Court lurks no

doubt in mind in holding that the learned Trial Court fell into

error on this particular aspect of the case and it misdirected itself

both on facts & in law, which calls for interference, as such the

criminal appeal to the extent of the appellants i.e. Jamshed &
26

Nadeem, is allowed, they are acquitted of the charge and shall be
released forthwith, if not to be detained in any other case.

19. Now diverting to the Criminal Revision No.276-P/2022,
titled “Shaukat Hussain Vs Jamshid and another”, where the
complainant has asked for the enhancement of sentence awarded
to the appellant-Jamshid, so in such eventuality the instant
criminal revision has lost its utility and the same is dismissed as
such.
