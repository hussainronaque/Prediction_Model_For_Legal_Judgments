Cr. MQ No. 69-D of 2015
JUDGMENT
Date of hearing 26.10.2015
Appellant-petitioner Allau Din etc by Mr. Sana Ullah Khan
Gandapur Advocate

Respondent State by Mr. Kamran Hayat Miankhel Addl: AG

MUHAMMAD GHAZANFAR_ KHAN, J.- Through the
instant petition under section 561-A Cr.P.C, the petitioners
have called in question the order dated 28.8.2015 rendered
by learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV/Justice of Peace,
D.I.Khan, whereby application filed by respondent No.2
under section 22-A(6) Cr.P.C was allowed and the SHO of
police station concerned was directed to register an FIR
against the petitioners in the light of facts alleged in the

application.

2. The brief facts giving rise to the instant petition
are that Mohammad Siddique, respondent No.2 submitted
an application under sections 22-A(6)/25 Cr.P.C_ for
registration of a criminal case under sections 324/34 PPC
against the petitioners alleging that on 31.3.2015 at 0630
hours, he alongwith his cousin Islamuddin was coming
towards home from their lands; that when they reached the
land of one Haji Shajee Khan, they saw the petitioners

standing there duly armed with pistols; that when the
-2-

complainant and his companion reached near petitioners,
the latter started firing at them with the intention to kill, as
a result of which the complainant sustained injury whereas

his companion escaped unhurt.

3. The application was marked to learned
Additional Sessions Judge-I[V, D.I.Khan who called for
comments of the SHO concerned which were submitted.
After hearing the arguments, the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-IV/Justice of Peace, D.I.Khan accepted the
application vide impugned judgment/order dated

28.8.2015.

4. The learned counsel for the petitioners argued
that the learned Court has failed to appreciate the
provisions of section 156 Cr.P.C. He further contended
that after cancellation of case on 29.4.2015 by the learned
Illaqa Magistrate on the same allegations, the learned
Justice of Peace could not hear the case and thus the
registration of new FIR No.103 dated 01.9.2015 is

unwarranted which needs to be quashed.

5. As against that, the learned Addl: A.G
vehemently opposed the arguments of learned counsel for
the petitioners and contended that a cognizable offence
was reported to the local police but instead of lodging an

FIR, the local police started inquiry under section 156(3)
-3-

Cr.P.C which was not required as the police could not

investigate the matter prior to registration of the case.

6. I have heard the arguments of learned counsel
for the parties and have gone through the record and law

on the subject.

7. Perusal of the record indicates that on
31.3.2015, respondent No.2 had made a report in the
emergency room of Mufti Mehmood Hospital, D.I.Khan
against the petitioners for causing injury to him which was
recorded vide daily diary No.20 of police station
Chaudhwan, which was inquired into and final report was
submitted and on the basis of such report, the learned
Resident Magistrate, Daraban (D.I.Khan) vide order dated
29.4.2015, filed the same without proceeding further in the
matter. On the same allegations, respondent No.2 filed
another application on 27.6.2015 before learned Justice of
Peace, D.I.Khan which was accepted vide impugned order.
Once the report of respondent No.2 containing the same
allegations was filed by the learned Magistrate after proper
inquiry, the impugned order for registration of FIR against
the petitioners on the same allegations is not warranted by
law. The arguments of learned Addl: A.G, that prior to
registration of case, a police officer was not empowered to
investigate the case, are misconceived. Section 156(1)

Cr.P.C envisages that any officer incharge of a police
-4-

station may, without the order of a Magistrate, investigate
any cognizable case which a Court having jurisdiction over
the local area within the limits of such station would have
power to inquire into or try under the provisions of Chapter
XV relating to the place of inquiry or trial. The learned
Justice of Peace has materially erred in accepting the

application of respondent No.2.

8. For the reasons mentioned above, the instant
petition is accepted, the impugned order dated 28.8.2015
of learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV/Justice of Peace,
D.I.Khan is set aside and consequently, FIR No.103 dated
01.9.2015 registered against the petitioners at police
station Chaudhwan, D.I.Khan is quashed.

Announced.
