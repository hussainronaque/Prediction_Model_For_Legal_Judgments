LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- This petition is
directed against the order dated 06.02.2020 of
the learned Judge, Anti-Terrorism Court-ll,
Peshawar, whereby the application moved by
the State under Section 227 of the Criminal
Procedure Code, 1898 for alteration of the
consolidated charge framed on 04.11.2019 in
two separate criminal cases, has been

dismissed.
2. Brief facts of the case are that on

28.02.2019, a case was registered vide FIR

No.12 at Police Station C.T.D, Peshawar under

Sections 324/ 353/427/148/149 PPC read with

Sections 7 and 11 of the Anti-Terrorism Act,

1997 against some unknown persons (the first

case). Thereafter on 16.04.2019, in the same

Police Station another case was registered

vide FIR No.25 u/ss 302/ 324/353/427/120-B

PPC read with Section 3, 4 and 5 of the

Explosive Substances Act, 1908, Section 15 of

the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013 and

Section 7, 11-N and 21(i) of the Anti-Terrorism

Act, 1997 (the second case).

3. After completion of investigation, the first

case was put in Court wherein charge was

framed on 10.10.2019 against the respondents

No.1 to 3. When the second case was put in

Court, the learned trial Court ordered joint trial

of both the cases vide order dated 31.10.2019

and consequently a consolidated charge was
framed on 04.11.2019 against all the

respondents herein to which neither the State

nor the accused raised any objection. On

commencement of the joint trial, the learned

trial Court, pursuant to the consolidated

charge, started recording evidence in the

cases. During the joint trial, the learned

Prosecutor moved an application before the

learned trial Court for alteration of the

consolidated charge, which application was

dismissed by the learned trial Court vide order

dated 06.02.2020 whereagainst the State has

preferred the instant petition.

4. Arguments heard and record gone
through.
5. Perusal of the record would show that

the first case reported in FIR No.12 took place

on 28.02.2019 wherein an Hon'ble judge of this

Court was fired at when he was on his way to

Court from his residence for performing his

duties whereas the second case reported in
FIR No.25 occurred on 15.04.2019, according

to which some miscreants had occupied a

house at Hayatabad for their indulging in

anti-State activities. As per contents of the FIR

of the second case, the law enforcers, in order

to foil the designs of the miscreants, raided the

house to effect their arrest, on which, firing and

cross-firing ensued as a result of which one

ASI embraced shahadat and an_ alleged

miscreant too lost his life.

6. It seems from the record that both the

incidents are separate in nature and there is no

similarity or sameness in between the two,

hence, it cannot be said that both are of the

same kind or are very much alike. No doubt,

according to Section 234 Cr.P.C., when a

person is accused of more offences than one

of the same kind committed within the space of

twelve months from the first to the last of such

offences, he may be charged with and tried at

one trial and according to Section 239 (d) of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, persons

accused of different offences committed in the

course of same transaction could be charged

and tried together but, as stated earlier, both

the incidents reported in the two different FIRs

are neither of the same kind nor have been

committed during the course of same

transaction, therefore, same cannot be tried

jointly. It transpires from the record that the first

case pertains to an incident wherein firing was

made at an Hon’ble Judge of this Court,

whereas in the second case, one person from

each side lost his life as a result of firing and

cross-firing and hurling of hand grenades

allegedly by the accused mentioned in the FIR

of the case. So both the incidents are

altogether of different kind (wisdom is derived

from a judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court of

Pakistan reported in PLD 2003 SC 891).

7. In order to attract the provisions of

Sections 234 and 239 of the Criminal
Procedure Code, 1898, for conducting joint trial
of two cases, both the offences committed
must be of the same kind which is not the case
in hand. The learned trial Court, while passing
the order of joint trial of both the cases and
framing a consolidated/joint charge, in the
considered opinion of this court, has committed
an illegality which cannot be countenanced. It
is also worth to mention that as per
Section 233 Cr.P.C., for every distinct offence
of which any person is accused, there shall be
a separate charge and every such charge shall
be tried separately except in the cases
mentioned in Sections 234, 235 and 239
Cr.P.C.

8. As not only both the cases are distinct in
kind as to facts thereof but their victims too are
different and_ similarly complainants and
witnesses of both the cases too are separate,
therefore, on no count same could be jointly

tried through a consolidated charge. Besides,
some of the accused of the second case have

not been charged as perpetrators in the first

case.

9. Though the State has not challenged

the very order of joint trial of both the cases

passed on 31.10.2019 by the learned trial court

and 59 PWs, 9 DWs and 16 CWs have been

examined by the learned trial Court besides

recording statements of 6 of the accused as

envisaged under section 342 Cr.P.C. but as

conducting both the cases jointly through a

consolidated charge is a grass violation of law

on the subject, therefore, mere recording of

evidence to the ibid effect through the

consolidated charge cannot be made a ground

to validate the joint trial and the impugned

order.

10. For what has been discussed above,

this petition is allowed, the impugned order is

set aside and it is directed that both the cases

be tried separately on separate charges,
however, as the respondents-accused are
behind the bars since long, therefore, the
learned trial Court is directed to proceed with
their cases on day-to-day basis and in order to
achieve the ibid goal, all the necessary means

available under the law be employed.
