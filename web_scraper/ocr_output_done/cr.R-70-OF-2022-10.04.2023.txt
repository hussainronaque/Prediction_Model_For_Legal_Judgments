JUDGMENT
Cr. Revision No. 70-P of 2022.

Date of hearing: 10.04.2023

Petitioner: (Saeedullah)
By Mr. Shan Asghar, Advocate.

Respondent: (Lal Sher) By Mr. Hussain Ali,
Advocate.

(State) By Mr. Muhammad Nisar Khan,
AAG.

Mr. Ashfaq Ahmad Daudzai,
Assistant Attorney General, as
Amicus Curiae.

ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- = Through this

Criminal Revision, the petitioner namely Saeedullah son of
Esrar-ud-Din, has challenged the order dated 30.03.2022
passed by the learned Judge Anti-Terrorism Court-II,
Peshawar, whereby the application filed by the petitioner
for transfer of the trial to the Juvenile Court and deletion of
section-7 ATA was dismissed.

2. The petition raises questions about the construction
of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997, Juvenile Justice System

Act 2018, the inter-play of their various provisions, the
legal effect of inserting Ordinance NO.V of 2012 in
Juvenile Justice System Ordinance (XXII of 2000), and its
subsequent expiry with the efflux of time. The ultimate
question is whether the Anti-Terrorism Court or the
Juvenile Court shall try the accused for the offence of
terrorism.

3. On 12.7.2019, Saeedullah, allegedly aged 17 years
at the time of the commission of the offence, was
convicted by the Anti-Terrorism Court under Sections-
324/34,337-A (i) PPC, Section-15 of the KP Arms Act,
and Section-7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997. He
appealed his conviction to the High Court and put forth
different contentions, including the objection on Anti-
Terrorism Court jurisdiction on the grounds of juvenility.
The High Court vide judgment dated 22.02.2022 rendered
in Cr. Appeal No.929-P of 2019 allowed his appeal,
remanded his case to the trial court, and directed its
transfer to the juvenile court.

4. Resuming trial, the Anti-Terrorism Court framed the

charge against the accused on 30.3.2022. It overruled the
objection regarding its jurisdiction. The court summed up

its order:

5.

“Admittedly, as per S.R.O.572(1)2012, the Federal
Government has already designated the Anti-
Terrorism Courts established throughout the
country under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, to
exercise the powers of Juvenile Court in the area of
their respective jurisdiction. The learned counsel for
the accused claimed that the above referred
notification was issued in the light of Juvenile
Justice System Ordinance and after the
promulgation of Juvenile Justice System Act 2018,no
fresh notification empowering Anti-Terrorism Court
to act as Juvenile Courts has been issued, therefore
Anti-Terrorism Courts lack jurisdiction to try cases
involving Juvenile. This contention of the learned
defence counsel is not sustainable on the ground
that as per section 24 of the General Clauses Act,
1897, the notification already issued by the Federal
Government designating the Anti-Terrorism Court
as Juvenile Court is protected.”

This Court has had helpful submissions from

Mr. Shan Asghar, advocate representing the petitioner,

Hussain Ali, advocate from complainant, Muhammad

Nisar, Additional Advocate General, and Mr. Ashfaq

Ahmed Daudzai, Assistant Attorney General.

6.

Before the Juvenile Justice System Act 2018 was

promulgated, the High Courts had a widely-held view that

the Anti-Terrorism Act took precedence over the Juvenile

Justice System Ordinance (XXII of 2000) for the trial of

juveniles. The Court’s decisions were primarily seized

upon the following considerations:

I. Section 14 of the Juvenile Justice System

Ordinance provides that provisions of the
Ordinance are to be read in addition to and not in
derogation of any law for the time being in force.

Il. The term "exclusively" found in section 21-G of
the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 was added through
Act II of 2005, which came after the
promulgation of the Ordinance. It demonstrates
the legislative intent for the Anti-Terrorism Act
to supersede section 4(3) of the Ordinance.

Il. Section 32 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997
provides that the provisions of the said Act have

an overriding effect over all other laws.

IV. The Government of Pakistan, through the
notification dated 30.05.2012, declared all the
Anti-Terrorism Courts established throughout the
country under the Terrorism Act 1997 to exercise

the powers of Juvenile Courts.

7. As an abundant clarity, few decisions need a
reference.

8. The Lahore High Court held in Muhammad Din v
Muhammad Jehangir, PLD 2004 Lahore 779:

"The express provisions of sections 2(d),21-C(5),21-
C(7)(e),21-C (7)(f) and 21-F of the Anti-Terrorism
Act, 1997 clearly postulate that a child below the
age of eighteen years can legitimately be tried by an
Anti-Terrorism Court constituted under the Anti-
Terrorism Act ,1997.We are fortified in this
impression by the provisions of section 32 of the
Anti-Terrorism Act,1997 which unambiguously
provide that the provisions of the said Act are to

have overriding effect over all other laws. As
against that the provisions of section 14 of the
Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000 expressly
provide that the provisions of the said Ordinance
shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any
other law for the time being in force. The Juvenile
Justice System Ordinance 2000 was introduced at a
time when the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 was already
holding the field containing the above mentioned
provisions relating to a trial of child by an Anti-
Terrorism Court and we have every reason to
believe that the Legislature was quite conscious of
the said fact but despite that the Juvenile Justice
System Ordinance 2000 was not given by the
Legislature an overriding effect over the other laws
and thus the provisions contained in the Anti-
Terrorism Act 1997 relatable to a child's trial by an
Anti-Terrorism Court were not tinkered with or
disturbed.",

9. The Balochistan High Court expressed in no
different terms in Muhammad Rasool and another
versus the State, PLD 2012 Balochistan 122:

"Learned counsel for the appellants contended that
the trial court had no jurisdiction to try appellant
Rohullah, being minor. The contention of the
counsel has no legs to stand on, as the provisions of
section 21-G of the Act of 1997 furnish a complete
answer to the said contention, which postulate that
an offence of terrorism can be tried only by an Anti-
Terrorism Court, constituted under the Act of 1997
and the age of offender has no relevance to the
question of such jurisdiction. Difference between the

Act of 1997 and the Juvenile Justice System
Ordinance 2000 was that in the former statute Court
acquired jurisdiction, if the offence was triable by
them whereas in the later statute Courts acquired
jurisdiction if the offenders were juvenile,
irrespective of the nature of offence committed by
them. Under section 32, the provisions of Anti-
Terrorism Act 1997 have the overriding effect over
all other laws including the Juvenile Justice System
Ordinance 2000 whereas under section 14 of the
Ordinance 2000, the provisions of the Ordinance
20000 shall be in addition to and not in derogation

of any other law for the time being in force".
10. Adding a little more to the already held opinion, the
Sindh High Court in Qamar Hussain Shah Versus, the
State PLD 2006 Karachi 331, held:

"In the Ordinance 2000 there is no specific
provision for overriding the provisions of other
laws. Thus the principle of maxim "Generalibus
specialia derogant" does not apply to the present
case because different intention of the Legislature
appears in the Ordinance 2000 in the shape of
section 14...

Now it is to be seen as to why a necessity had arisen
in enacting section 21-G in A.T Act. As already
observed that before Ordinance 2000 the A.T Act
had jurisdiction to try offences committed by any
accused either major or minor. After promulgation
of Ordinance 2000, situation was changed. The
Parliament realized that offences of act of terrorism
might be tried under the Ordinance 2000 , therefore
a necessity arose before the Parliament to describe

which offence shall be tried by which court.
Therefore section 21-G was enacted in the year
2001 describing the jurisdiction and powers of A.T
Court. Not only that in the year 2005 the word
exclusive has further been added in the section 21-G
to make it more clear that all the offences under the
A.T Act are exclusively triable by the Anti-Terrorism
Court only...

I have already observed that the Juvenile Court
created under Ordinance 2000 is the Court of
general jurisdiction for taking cognizance and trial
of all offences under any law, whereas the courts
created under the CNS Act and A.T Act are the
Courts of special jurisdiction to take cognizance and
try offences mentioned under the said Acts therefore
the provisions of both the Act are special provisions
in comparison to such provisions of the

Ordinance2000."
11. This Court in Mujahid Iqbal Versus the State and
another 2019 PCr LJ 1432, described it so:

"Therefore the insertion of word " exclusively" in the
Anti-Terrorism Act, being later in time will have
precedence over section 4(3) of the Ordinance 2000,
more particularly when the intention of legislature
in the Ordinance of 2000 is reflected in section 14
which envisages that the provisions of the
Ordinance shall be in addition to and not in
derogation of any law for the time being in
force."Asad Ullah alias Shakir Ullah v State (2011
PCrLJ 1022), Muhammad Rasool v State (PLD
2012 Balochistan 122).

Even otherwise, the Government of Pakistan

through notification dated 30.05.2012 has declared
all the Anti-Terrorism Courts _ established
throughout the country under the Anti-Terrorism Act
1997 to exercise the powers of Juvenile Courts in
the area of their respective jurisdiction, under the

Juvenile Justice System Ordinance 2000."

12. In the order under challenge before this Court, the
Anti-Terrorism Court based its opinion on Ordinance No.
V, 2012, and the effect of section 24 General Clauses Act
1897. Article-89 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973 says
that the Ordinance stands repealed at the expiration of one
hundred twenty days from its promulgation. It follows that
the Ordinance No. V of 2012, which amended Section-4 of
the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance.2000, ceased to be
effective after one hundred and twenty days from its
promulgation.

13. Does the Ordinance have a shadow effect? It is a
long-settled opinion that the Ordinance is temporary
legislation that carries with it the potential for its own
cessation. In his book Understanding Statutes, First
Edition 1997, S.M Zafar has discussed the effects of
expiry of a temporary statute. In his opinion:

“The general law, with regard to the effect of expiry

of a temporary statute, has been laid down in the
famous case Crown v Haveli, in this case it was held
that, when a temporary statute expires it ceases
altogether to have effect as if it has never been
,except as to transactions past and closed. This
result follows unless there be provision made in the
statute itself for continuing the effect thereof in any

respect.”

14. When assessing the posthumous effects of the
Ordinance, the Courts have consistently maintained that
the General Clauses Act 1897 cannot be used to interpret
constitutional provisions. The Courts, on several
occasions, considered the implications of Article 264 of
the Constitution of Pakistan 1973 and the applicability of
Section 6 and Section 6-A of the General Clauses Act
1897. Nonetheless, the temporary nature of the Ordinance
has meant that it is unlikely to have any influence after it
expires.

15. In a relatively earlier authority from this Court,
Arbab Muhammad Hasham Khan versus the Crown
PLD 1953 Peshawar 72, it was held:

"Reference has been made to section 6 of the
N.W.F-P General Clause Act IIT of 1932, under
which where an Act repeals any enactment or where
an Act enforced for a period ceases to operate on

the expiry of that period then unless a different
16.

10

intention appears, the repeal or expiry does not
revive anything, not in force or existing at the time
at which the repeal or expiry takes effect. This
section obviously does not deal with Ordinances
which are distinct from Acts. The Acts are
permanent legislations placed on the statute Book
for all time to come while the Ordinances are
temporary enactments which have got force only for
a limited period, and it is on account of this fact that
section 6 of the N.W.F. P General Clauses Act-II of
1932 is silent with regard to the Ordinances. In our
view, therefore, when the N.W.F.P Public Safety
(Amendment) Ordinance II of 1952, ceased to
operate, section 3 of the N.W.F.P Public Safety Act
of 1948 revived.”

The latest verdict of the Honorable Supreme Court,

Pakistan Medical and Dental Council, through its

President Versus Muhammad Fahad Malik and others,

Civil Appeals No.3 & 4 of 2018, Civil Petition No.3412

of 2017, and Civil Petition No.45 & 64 to 70 of 2018,

after surveying several judgments, puts it beyond pale of

doubt. The relevant paragraph reads as under:

"It is well-recognized that in case of any doubt or
conflict between any two provisions of the
Constitution, the Court has to construct the same
harmoniously. First, it is to be determined whether
or not there is any conflict between the provisions of
Articles 89 and 264 of the Constitution. The clear
mandate of Article 89 ibid is that while the President
1

is authorized to make amendments in a permanent
statute by promulgating an Ordinance, subject to the
conditions mentioned therein, that Ordinance has
been accorded only a limited period of effectiveness
and operation, and cannot operate beyond that
period unless given permanency by Parliament by
making it an Act of Parliament. On the other hand,
Article 264 of the Constitution provides, inter alia,
that where a law is repealed, by, under, or by virtue
of the Constitution, the repeal shall not, except as
otherwise provided in the Constitution, revive
anything not in force or existing at the time at which
the repeal takes effect, or affect the previous
operation of the law or anything duly done or
suffered under the law. Does the Constitution
provide for anything to the contrary or otherwise in
this regard? The answer to this is yes — Article 89 of
the Constitution, which clearly provides otherwise,
ie. every Ordinance shall stand repealed on the
expiration of 120 days from its promulgation or
upon the passing of a resolution disapproving it if
passed by the National Assembly or either House (as
the case may be) before the expiration of that
period, however, the National Assembly or either
House (as the case may be) may by a resolution
extend, only once, the Ordinance for a further
period of 120 days. What is the effect of an
Ordinance on a permanent statute? To our mind, the
effect is of a temporary nature, namely, any
amendment/insertion/substitution made by it (the
Ordinance) would only be for a limited period of
120 or at the most 240 days, unless provided
permanency by Parliament by making it an Act of

Parliament. Of course, in that eventuality, it would
12

become a permanent statute. A combined reading of
both the Articles makes it manifest that the intention
of the legislature appears to be to limit the
Ordinance making power of the President and not to
give the President unlimited power to
amend/alter/modify/change/rescind a permanent
statute, which, of course, falls within the domain of

Parliament."

17. Summing it up, the Ordinance No. V of 2012,
having outlived its life as a temporary law, can have no
legal force of its own to withstand the repealing effects of
the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance. Resultantly, the
decision on the revision petition would essentially turn
upon the nature or equity of two statutes, the Anti-
Terrorism Act 1997 and the Juvenile Justice System Act
2018. That, in turn, would help assess the impact of
competing sections and their resultant legal impact.

18. The Sindh High Court in Qamar Hussain Shah’s
case (PLD 2006 Karachi 331), made following analysis of
the general and special law:

"I have already observed that the Juvenile Court
created under Ordinance 2000 is the Court of
general jurisdiction for taking cognizance and trial
of all offences under any law, whereas the courts
created under the CNS Act and A.T Act are the

Courts of special jurisdiction to take cognizance and
19.

13

try offences mentioned under the said Acts,
therefore, the provisions of both the Act are special
provisions in comparison to such provisions of the

Ordinance 2000."

The above observations seemingly fall short of

describing the true essence of "general" and "special law".

Thus, in People v. Wilcox, 237 Ill. 421,86 N.E. 672, one

of the earliest expositions on the subject, the Court held:

20.

"The words ‘local’ and ‘special’ are frequently used
interchangeably, although it is clear that they do not
have the same meaning. The word ‘local’ signifies
belonging to or confined to a particular place. When
applied to legislation, it signifies such legislation as
relates to only a portion of the territory of a state.
Bouvier's Law Dict.; Burrill's Law Dict.; People v.
O'Brien, 38 N. Y. 193; People v. Newburgh, etc.,
Railroad Co., 86 N. Y. 1; Ellis v. Frazier, 38 Or.
462, 63 Pac. 642,53 L. R. A. 454. The word ‘local’
is used as a counter term to ‘general.’ The word
‘special’ appears to be more appropriately applied
to laws that grant some special right, privilege, or
immunity or impose some particular burden upon
some portion of the people of the state less than all.
State v. Corson, 67 NJ law.178 ,50 Atl 780"

Similarly, in State v. Johnson, 170 N.C. 685, 86

S.E. 788 (N.C. 1915), it was held as under:

“4 law is local when it pertains to a particular place
or to a definite region or portion of space or is

restricted to one place, as, for instance, a local
21.

14

custom; and it is special when it is different from
others of the same general kind or designed for a
Particular purpose or is limited in range or confined
to a prescribed field of action or operation; and so

say the lexicographers”

For further clarity see Gunepally Thammayya and

Others. Versus Sri Rajah Tyadapusapati (1930) 59

MLJ 755:

22.

"In In re Smith's Estate. Clements v. Ward (1887) 35
Ch. 589 an earlier Act 43 Geo. 3, giving power to
all persons to settle or devise lands or goods for any
church, provided it was three months before death,
was held not to be affected by the Married
Women's Property Act, 1882, which gave absolute
power to married women to dispose of property by
will. Here the later Act is a special Act in the sense
that it applied to married women and not to all
persons, but the first Act is special in the sense that
it dealt with property given to church, whereas the
Married Women's Property Act dealt with all kinds

of settlements and devises."

Therefore, the special law encompasses various

eventualities: individuals, objectives, and domains of

activity. While the Juvenile Justice System Act, 2018

caters to specific persons, the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997

addresses a particular subject. It would be wrong to

characterize either of the laws as general.
15

23. It leads further to an examination of the clash
between the two special laws. As a preliminary, the
previous comparison between the Juvenile Justice System
Ordinance 2000 and the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 is no
longer relevant. The legal framework has changed. The
Juvenile Justice System Act 2018 has no parallel provision
to section 14 of the Ordinance. It includes a non-obstante
clause and provides an exclusive jurisdiction of the
Juvenile Court to try juveniles' cases. The relevant sections
read as follows:

Section-4. Juvenile Court. --(4) The Juvenile Court
shall have exclusive jurisdiction to try cases in
which a juvenile is accused of the commission of an
offence.

Section-23. Act to override other laws. ---The
provisions of this Act shall have overriding effect
notwithstanding anything contained in any other law

for the time being in force.
24. Consequently, it is a conflict of two non-obstante
clauses that require focus. In Syed Mushahid Shah and
Others Versus Federal Investment Agency and Others,
2017 SCMR 1218 Honorable the Supreme Court, held as

follows:
25.

16

"Thus when there are two special laws both of which
contain overriding clauses, in the case of conflict
between the two laws generally the statute later in

time will prevail over the statute prior in time."

In the same vein, however, the Honorable Court

added:

26.

"However we are of the opinion that this
presumption is not automatic: instead, a host of
other factors, including the object, purpose, and
policy of both the statutes and legislature's intention
as expressed by the language employed therein,
need to be considered to determine which of the two

special laws is to prevail”.

For the foregoing, salient features of the two laws,

the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 and the Juvenile Justice

System Act 2018 may be considered:

been made or credible
information has been
received or a reasonable
suspicion exists of his

having been so
concerned, for purpose of
inquiry:

27. Based on the above analysis, conflicting provisions
in both laws display irreconcilable discrepancies.
Therefore, the latter legislation, the Juvenile Justice
System Act 2018, would take precedence in the trial of
juveniles accused of committing terrorist offences. It aligns
with the legislative intent expressed in section 4,
subsection 4, and section 23 of the Juvenile Justice System
Act,2018. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the Juvenile

Justice System Act 2018 mentions three categories of
20

offences- minor, major, and heinous- with the last one
relevant to terrorism-related act.

28. It is crucial to consider that certain safeguards; both
substantive and procedural, available to minors can only be
ensured through the Juvenile. Court platform. These
measures include confidentiality of proceedings, detention
in observation homes, support from probation and social
welfare officers to the investigating officer, and the social
investigation report attached to the report under section
173 of the Cr PC. Additionally, the spectrum of
rehabilitative penalties, such as probation, community
service orders, detention in juvenile rehabilitation centers,
and the prohibition of capital punishment, are only
envisioned within the parameters of the Juvenile Justice
System Act 2018. The absence of such safeguards can
affect their right to a fair trial.

29. The case of T.V The United Kingdom,
Application No.24724/94 dated 16" December 1999,
concerned two children aged ten tried by the Crown Court
for abduction and murder. They were convicted and

sentenced, and T filed an application with the European
21

Commission of Human Rights, alleging the state violated
its obligations under Articles 1, 3, 6, and 14 of the
Convention. The European Commission of Human Rights
and the Government of the United Kingdom referred the
case to the European Court of Human Rights. T claimed
that due to his "youth, immaturity, and emotional state his
trial in an adult Crown Court in public was inhumane,
degrading, and unfair", and he could not effectively
participate in the trial. The Court found that there was a
violation of Articles 6 and 1 of the Convention, and held
that:

"The Court notes that the applicant's trial took place
over three weeks in public in the Crown Court.
Special measures were taken in view of the
applicant's young age and to promote his
understanding of the proceedings: for example, he
had the trial procedure explained to him and was
taken to see the courtroom in advance, and the
hearing times were shortened so as not to tire the
defendants excessively. Nonetheless, the formality
and ritual of the Crown Court must at times have
seemed incomprehensible and intimidating for a
child of eleven, and there is evidence that certain of
the modifications to the courtroom, in particular the
raised dock which was designed to enable the
defendants to see what was going on, had the effect

of increasing the applicant's sense of discomfort
30.

22

during the trial, since he felt exposed to the scrutiny
of the press and public. The trial generated
extremely high levels of press and public interest,
both inside and outside the courtroom, to the extent
that the judge in his summing-up referred to the
problems caused to witnesses by the blaze of
publicity and asked the jury to take this into account

when assessing their evidence (see paragraph 13

Here, although the applicant's legal representatives
were seated, as the Government put it, “within
whispering distance”, it is highly unlikely that the
applicant would have felt sufficiently uninhibited, in
the tense courtroom and under public scrutiny, to
have consulted with them during the trial or, indeed,
that, given his immaturity and his disturbed
emotional state, he would have been capable outside
the courtroom of cooperating with his lawyers and
giving them information for the purposes of his
defence. In conclusion, the Court considers that the
applicant was unable to participate effectively in the
criminal proceedings against him and was, in
consequence, denied a fair hearing in breach of
Article 6 & 1."

Pakistan has ratified the United Nations Convention

on the Rights of the Child. As per Article-40 (2) (b) (iii) &

(VII) of the Convention, the trial of a child should be

conducted in a juvenile court, ensuring safeguards of their

privacy. Article-40 (2) (b) (IV) requires proper procedural

measures are in place to ensure the child effectively
23
participates in the trial. Furthermore, Article-40 (1)
emphasizes a rehabilitative approach to passing sentences.
31. Sometimes it is believed that the juvenile justice
framework is inadequate or inappropriate to deal with
radicalized youth or children committing adult-sized
crimes. The fallacy of such thinking is underscored by the
recent legal literature. The Law Council of Australia
report, Review of the prosecution and sentencing of
Children for Commonwealth terrorist offences,27 June
2018, mentions:
“The Law Council is of the view that in light of the
detrimental effects of incarceration on the
rehabilitative prospects for terrorist offenders, the
focus on sentencing young terrorist offenders
should, where possible, be on alternatives to
imprisonment with intensive rehabilitative programs
in order to reduce chances of recidivism upon
release from such supervision. Where imprisonment
is necessary, targeted rehabilitative programs

should be available to offenders while serving their

sentence”.
32. The Islamic Legal System has long ago stressed the
importance of treating juveniles differently in the justice

system. Even while dealing with serious crimes, the
24
Islamic justice system prefers administrative penalties for
children of a certain age. To quote from Abdul Qadir
Oudah's Criminal Law of Islam, translated by S.Zakir
Aijaz, International Islamic Publishers,

"At this stage, the perceptive child is not
immediately accountable on criminal grounds and
will not be subject to the Hadd laid down for theft
and adultery; nor will be amenable to qisas for
homicide and infliction of injury. Disciplinary action
is also a punishment for crime in itself but it is not
criminal punishment. The effect of criminal and
disciplinary punishment would be that the child will
not be treated as a habitual offender, and will as
such be liable to only those penal punishments that

aim at warning and admonition."
33. Therefore, for the above, it is held that the juvenile
accused of committing terrorism offence shall be tried by
the Juvenile Court established and notified under the
Juvenile Justice System Act 2018. The criminal revision
petition is allowed, and the case of the accused Saeedullah
shall forthwith be transferred to the Juvenile Court at
Peshawar. Needless to mention that in light of Section-23
of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997, the Juvenile Court shall
proceed with the trial of the case as if it had taken

cognizance of the offence. Thus, the trial shall resume
25
from the stage it is transferred by the Anti-Terrorism

Court.
