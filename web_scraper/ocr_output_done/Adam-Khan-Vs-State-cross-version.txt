ORDER

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- Petitioner

Adam Khan, seeks bail in case FIR No.438 dated
24.11.2015, registered under sections 302/324/148/149
PPC, in Police Station Matani, Peshawar, wherein he
alongwith absconding co-accused is charged for
committing the murder of Malang with firearms on
24.11.2015 at 11.00 hours in the graveyard of village
Maryam Zai, on a motive of previous blood feud.

2. Arguments heard and record perused.

3. It appears from the material on record that qua
the same incident another FIR No.439 dated 24.11.2015
under sections 324/148/149 PPC, has been registered in the
same Police Station on the report of injured Wilayat
wherein he besides charging other co-accused, has also
charged Malang (deceased of the instant case) as accused

for attempting at his life and causing him firearm injuries.

Motive of previous blood feud enmity between the paties
has been alleged in both the FIRs. When both the FIRs are
taken in combination, the date, time and place of
occurrence as well as parties are the same, thus, the
incident falls within the ambit of cross version. No doubt
in the instant case one person has lost his life and in FIR
No.439 only complainant Wilayat has sustained firearm
injuries, but the prime consideration in cases of cross
version, is as to who the aggressor was and who was
aggressed upon and not the injuries caused to one side only
or that the loss/ damage caused to one party is greater than
caused to the other, which is only a relevant factor and
does not have overriding effect. In this view of the matter,
who has acted in self defence and who has attacked, is a
matter of further inquiry which is yet to be determined
during trial after recording evidence, on the basis of which
the case of the petitioner is arguable for the purpose of bail
in light of the dictum laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in cases titled, “Muhammad Shahzad Siddique Vs
the State and another” (PLD 2009 Supreme Court 58),
Abdul Hameed Vs Zahid Hussain alias Papu Chaman
Patiwala and others” (2011 SCMR 606) “Hamza Ali

Hamza and others Vs the State” (2010 SCMR 1219).

4. Resultantly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/ petitioner is admitted to bail provided he
furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two
local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD concerned.
