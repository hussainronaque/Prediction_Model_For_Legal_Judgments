the house of complainant, situated in village Nawa Kamar
Bara.

2. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record perused.

3. Since, learned counsel for the petitioner was
pressing hard for release of the petitioner on medical
ground, therefore, vide order dated 24.12.2020, the
Director General Health Services, Peshawar, was directed
to constitute a Standing Medical Board for examination of
the petitioner for the purpose of determination of his
ailment and that whether his treatment can be held in the
jail premises or otherwise and to submit report within a
fortnight, positively.
4. The Standing Medical Board, after examination of
the petitioner, has furnished and submitted the following
report:-

“The Standing Medical Board is of the opinion

that patient is a known case of diabetes mellitus,

hypertension and ischemic heart disease (valvular

heart disease) miltral stenosis for which PTMC

was done. He is having severe osteoarthritis of

both knees, cannot walk without support of

walking aid. His ECHO shows RWMA with

impaired systolic function. He is also having

coronary Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

(COPD), history of impaired renal function. He is

having multiple health issues of chronic nature

and severity. He_needs tertiary care hospital

facilities for_his_treatment_as_he_is having

multiple disease of severe nature. His treatment

may not be possible in jail premises. (emphasis

supplied)
5. According to record petitioner is 75 years old and as
per opinion of the Standing Medical Board, he is suffering from
multiple diseases of severe nature and his treatment inside the
jail may not be possible. Proviso Ist to section 497 Cr.P.C.
deals with bail to any person under the age of sixteen years or
any woman or any sick or infirm person accused, which reads
as under:-

“S.497 (1).. Proviso First:- Provided that the

Court may direct that any person under the age of

sixteen years or any woman or any sick or inform

person accused of such an offence be released on

bail”
Correct criteria for grant of bail to an accused on medical , in a
non-bailable offences, has been laid down by the apex Court in
case titled, “Mian _Manzoor Ahamed Watto Vs the State”
(2000 SCMR 107), in these words:-
PL

“Correct criteria for grant of bail to an accused
in a non-bailable case on medical ground would
be that the sickness or ailment with which the
accused is suffering is such that it cannot be
properly treated within the jail premises and that
some specialized treatment is need and his
continued detention in jail is likely to affect his
capacity or is hazardous to his life”.

Guidance in this regard may also be derived from case titled,

‘Haji Mir Aftab Vs the State” (1979 SCMR 320).

6. As regards gravity of the offence, where the Court is
satisfied of the sickness of the accused and such disease cannot
be properly treated in custody, then gravity of the disease
would outshine the gravity of the offence. The Hon’ble
Supreme Court in case titled, “Peer Mukaram_ ul Haq Vs

National Accountability Bureau (NAB) through Chairman

and others (2006 SCMR 1225), has held that:-

“sick or inform person may be released on bail
even if there are reasonable grounds for believing
that he has been guilty of an offence punishable
with death or life imprisonment because where a
statute itself lays down certain principles for
doing some acts they may be taken as a guideline
jor doing something of the same nature which is
in the discretion of the Court.

In case titled, “The State Vs Haji Kabeer Khan” (PLD 2005

Supreme Court 364) it has been held by the apex Court that:
“Courts are not required to quality or quantify
the nature of disease and once a case is made
out under the recognized principle laid down by
the Supreme Court in this behalf, bail is to be
granted on medical ground leaving prosecution
at liberty to move the Court for cancellation of
bail, if health of accused has improved during
pendency of proceedings, because on the
ground of sickness or infirmity, on exceptional
term, law has offered an opportunity to an
accused to enjoy the concession of bail subject

to satisfying the Court about the nature of his
ailment as well as on the ground of non-getting

of proper treatment in jail, but no sooner the

accused has improved his health, the

prosecution can come forward with the request

Jor withdrawal of the concession of bail.”
7. Deriving guidance and placing reliance on the
judgments (supra) of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, I without
touching the merits of the case, accept this petition and allow
the petitioner bail on the sole medical ground. He shall be
released on bail is he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of rupees
two lac with two local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in

the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned Trial Court.
