          SHAHID
ANWAR BAJWA, J:-  FIR No.09 of 2010 was recorded on 16.08.2010 at police
station FIA, Corporate Crime Circle, Karachi on a written complaint received
from Joint Director of State Bank of Pakistan. Facts in the FIR have been summarized
by the trial Court in the following words:-
"-
- - -  A complaint was received from Mr. Syed Mansoor Ali, Sr. Joint Director
Financial Monitoring Unit SBP main Building Karachi alongwith a suspicious
transaction report that Muhammad Yousuf is maintaining account with HBL at DHA
branch under the title of M/s Yousuf Goods Transport, and report of SBP is that
millions of rupees have been routed through account No.05417987605003 i.e. PKR
90 million within a period of one and half month. The transactions in this
account amounted to millions of rupees with same day deposits and withdrawals
of almost equivalent amounts. The transactional activity in the account is in
contrast to the profile of the customer namely Muhammad Yousuf. During enquiry
one Gulzar Ahmed Bilal Manager and authorized signatory of cheques of M/s Kappa
Enterprises was called alongwith relevant documents. On 3.6.2010 Gulzar Ahmed
Bilal produced the photo state relevant documents relating to remittance of
foreign exchange sent abroad through M/s Time Exchange company B Pvt Ltd, the
documents include copies of telex transfer of wall street exchange center LLC
Dubai UAE, and M/sA1 Zarooni Dubai Exchange Dubai, UAE, and the documents were
taken into possession by the FIA under seizure memo. Gulzar Ahmed Bilal also
confirmed that the cheques amounting to Rs.5,050,000/- in respect of A/c
001301000895 of M/s Kappa Enterprises Karachi and of his personal A/c
001301000892 both maintained at Bank Al Falah Limited Marriott road were given
by him to Saddaruddin branch Incharge of M/s Time Exchange for transferring the
amounts to China and Hong Kong and the foreign exchange equivalent of above
amount were accordingly transferred by M/s Time Exchange vide telex transfers
Gulzar Ahmed Bilal further confirmed that he used to call Saddaruddin of M/s
Time Exchange and employee of M/s Time Exchange used to collect the cheque
amount from him. The account number and name of company to whom the money was
intended to transfer was communicated to M/s Time Exchange and TT was sent to
the concerned company through AI Zarooni Exchange. The company when received
the funds remitted sent him/Gulzar Ahmed Bilal confirmed message. The copies of
TT were also sent to him from an email [email protected] of M/s
Time Exchange as confirmation that amount has been remitted to concern company.
Upon the above revelation that M/s Time Exchange at Shahrahe Faisal Karachi is
involved in illegal business of Hawala-Hundi/unauthorized remittance abroad, a
team of officer of FIA CCC reached at the place where branch Incharge
Sadaruddin and his Manager Sikandar Lalani alongwith other staff were found on
spot. They were confronted on numerous suspicious illegal remittances made by
their office in abroad secured during enquiry which they owned as having made
by them, and on demand they produced relevant record and were taken in
possession by the FIA under proper seizure memo. The computer hard drives
recovered and seized from the premises of M/s Time Exchange Company were sent
to FIA NR3C Karachi for forensic/technical analysis and report confirms that
the alleged firm has been chatting with one Baber of M/s Al Zarooni Exchange of
UAE, regarding remittance as well as email correspondence on email [email protected]."
   
2.                           
Mr. M. Ilyas Khan learned counsel for applicants submitted that none of
the bank accounts referred to in the FIR have been either opened by appellants
or were ever operated by any of the applicants and no material has been brought
on record so far to substantiate that they had any link or connection with
those accounts. He further submitted that statement of as many as three
witnessed have been recorded so far but none of the witnesses has uttered a single
word against any of the applicants. He further submitted that applicants have
been behind the bars for almost six months now and statements of only three
witnesses have been recorded whereas according to list of witnesses submitted
with challan there are as many as 41 witnesses. Therefore, it appears that
trial is going to interminably long. Learned counsel also referred to statement
of accounts and submitted that applicants had nothing to do with these
accounts. 
3.                           
Mr. Ashiq Raza Learned Deputy Attorney General vehemently opposed bail
application and argued that applicants are involved in serious crime of
transfer of foreign exchange through Hawala and, therefore, they are not
entitled to bail.
4.                           
We have considered submissions made by the learned counsel and have also
gone through the record.
5.                           
Though allegations leveled in the charge sheet and FIR are very serious
but learned Deputy Attorney General failed to point out any document indicating
connection the applicants allegedly had with any of the accounts through which
it is alleged that money was transferred. He was unable to point out or produce
any account opening form, specimen signature card or any other documents of
bank in respect of allegation that present applicants were owners or operators of
the bank accounts in question or had anything to do so with those bank
accounts. 
6.                           
Learned counsel submitted that there are as many as 41 witnesses and
statements of only three witnesses have been recorded. Israr Ali Deputy Director
FIA stated that they have given up some of the witnesses. In fact said Israr
stated that after 3 or 4 more witnesses are examined and cross-examined,
prosecution will be in a position to decide as how many other witness does in
need to produce. Therefore, it appears that trial is going to drag on or will
take a considerable long time.
7.                           
It is settled law that while observations made in bail order are
tentative in nature and deeper appreciation of evidence cannot be undertaken
while deciding bail application, however, having looked at the material so far
produced before the Court and also having gone through testimony of the three
witnesses processed so far (there is not a single word in the statement of any
of the witnesses regarding any role or allegation against present applicants),
it does not appear to be a situation where prosecution has a cut and dried case.
It is a situation where the case still appeared to be of further inquiry.
8.                           
Result of the above discussion is that this bail application is allowed
and applicants are ordered to be released on bail subject to their furnishing
sureties in the sum of Rs.5,00,000/= each (five lacs) only and P.R. bond in the
like amount to the satisfaction of trial Court.

Above are our reasons for short order dictated in open Court on
24.05.2011.
