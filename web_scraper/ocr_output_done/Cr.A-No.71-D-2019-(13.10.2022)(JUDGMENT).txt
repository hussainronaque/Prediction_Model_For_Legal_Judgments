SHAHID KHAN, J.- Hameedullah, the appellant/
complainant, has called in question, acquittal of
Nazir Khan, respondent/accused, through the subject
appeal, under Section 417(2-A) Cr.PC, whereof, the
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Model Criminal
Trial Court, D.I.Khan, on conclusion of trial of the
respondent/accused, charged in case FIR No.378,
dated 10.9.1990, under Sections 302/34 PPC, of
police station City, D.I.Khan, recorded acquittal of

the accused by extending him the benefit of doubt.

2: The facts, in brief, are that the on

10.9.1990 at 12:30 p.m., the appellant/complainant

ae

namely Hameedullah brought the dead body of his
father Musa Khan and reported to the local police in
Emergency Room of Civil Hospital, D.I.Khan to the
effect that after attending the Courts, he alongwith
his father were on their way to Ustrana Hotel,
Commissionery Bazar, D.l.Khan for a lunch. The
appellant/complainant was ahead of his father. At
11:45 a.m., they reached at the end of Mohallah
Hayatullah. The appellant/complainant heard his
father, he turned back and saw that Zarif Khan
(acquitted co-accused) had caught hold of his father
and commanded the respondent/accused Nazir to
kill him. In the meanwhile, the respondent/accused
Nazir gave two dagger blows on his back, as a result
of it, he got injured and fell down. On hue and cry of
the appellant/complainant, the accused fled away
from the spot. The appellant/complainant being
empty handed could do nothing. The appellant/
complainant while shifting his injured father to the
hospital in a rickshaw, he succumbed to the injuries
on the way to the hospital. Motive for the
occurrence is stated to be dispute over lands and
previous blood feud. The report of the appellant/
complainant was reduced into writing in the shape
of murasila which culminated into registration of

above referred FIR.

3, Afier the occurrence, both the accused
opted for hiding, therefore, after completion of the
investigation, complete challan was drawn under
Section 512 Cr.PC and was sent up for trial. The
learned trial Court preserved the evidence and in
view of the evidence so collected, prima facie
involvement of the accused in the commission of
offence being could not be ruled out, as such, vide
order, dated, 10.5.1993, perpetual warrants of arrest

of the accused were issued accordingly.

4, On arrest of co-accused Zarif Khan
followed by completion of investigation to his
extent, challan was drawn and routed through the
relevant prosecution branch followed by sent up for
trial. On conclusion of the trial, the learned trial
Court arrived at the conclusion that the prosecution
in view of the evidence so recorded has
substantiated its version, as such, vide judgment,
dated 01.6,2006, the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-V, D.I.Khan, convicted and sentenced the
accused for life imprisonment. However, his
Cr.A.No.59-D/2006, was accepted by this Court,
vide judgment dated 28.01.2010, and he was

acquitted of the charges levelled against him.

5. On arrest of the respondent/accused
(Nazir Khan) followed by completion of
investigation, challan was drawn and routed through
the relevant prosecution branch followed by sent up

for trial.

6. On commencement of trial, copies of
the evidence (oral & documentary) delivered to the
respondent/accused. He was confronted with the
statements of allegations through formal charge, he
denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty and

claimed trial.

7. The prosecution to bring home charge
against the respondent/accused, recorded the
account of eight (08) witnesses and closed its
evidence, At the conclusion of prosecution evidence,
the respondent/accused was examined under Section
342 CrPC. He professed innocence and false
implication in the case. However, neither he wished
to be examined on Oath as required under Section
340(2) Cr.PC nor wanted to produce evidence in his
defence. On conclusion of trial, the learned
Additional Sessions Judge/Model Criminal Trial
Court, D.I.Khan, in view of the evidence so
recorded and assistance at the bar, arrived at the

conclusion that the allegations of respondent/
-5-

accused Nazir Khan are tainted with doubts, as such,
vide impugned judgment, dated, 04.7.2019, his

acquittal was recorded accordingly.

8. We have heard the arguments of
learned counsel for the parties as well as learned
Asstt: A.G. representing the State and have gone

through the record of the case.

9. The version of appellant/complainant
is that on the fateful day, date & time (10.9.1990 at
11:45 a.m.), after attending the Courts, he alongwith
his father were on their way to Ustrana Hotel,
Commissionery Bazar, D.I.Khan, for a lunch. He
was ahead of his father and when reached to the
venue of the occurrence, he heard his father and
turned back. It was observed that Zarif Khan
(acquitted co-accused) had caught hold of his father
and commanded the respondent/accused Nazir to
kill him, as a result of the successive dagger blows
on the back of his father, he was injured and fell
down. He shifted his injured father in a rickshaw to
the hospital but he succumbed to his injuries on the
way. Motive for the occurrence is disclosed as land

dispute and blood feud enmity.

10. The appellant/complainant appeared in

the witness box as PW-8. He reiterated the contents
sifiee

of FIR in his examination-in-chief, It is unnatural
that the appellant/complainant was sure enough of
the fact that his injured father has succumbed to his
injuries but instead to approach the local police, he
opted for the hospital, knowingly, that the police
station falls on way to the hospital. On this score
alone, strong presumption can no way be ruled out
regarding the element of consultation and

deliberation.

11. The appellant/complainant disclosed in
his examination-in-cross that his hands and clothes
were besmeared with blood of his deceased father
and it is nothing but natural that the signs and
symptoms of the blood could also be observed in the
rickshaw while shifting him to the hospital.
Strangely enough, neither the Investigation Officer
has taken the pain to ask for the garments of the
appellant/complainant besmeared with blood nor the
rickshaw in question has been inspected during the
investigation, whereof, the signs and symptoms of
the blood could be observed. Not to procure and
produce the subject circumstantial evidence, it can
be observed that either the investigation is of
substandard or the subject disclosure of the
complainant is not all correct so disclosed on his

turn in the witness box.
-7-

12. Likewise, _ tangible circumstantial
evidence as a ‘Parcha Peshi’ has not been collected
by the Investigation Officer from the complainant
and on this score too, a strong circumstantial
evidence as on return of the complainant party after
attending the Court were on their way to the hotel,
whereof, the tragic incident took place. It makes the
Court to believe that not to furnish Parcha Peshi
before the I.O, whereof, the I.O on his turn in the
witness box has never stated that Parcha Peshi in
question was asked from the complainant party but
failed to produce, as such, non production of the

Parcha Peshi is also fatal.

13. Similarly, due particulars of the
rickshaw and its driver as registration number
coupled with the identity of the driver is neither part

and parcel of the investigation nor that of the trial.

14. Undoubtedly, the account of a solitary
witness is sufficient enough to procure conviction of
the accused in such like cases but in the
circumstances where strong circumstantial evidence
as garments of the complainant, besmeared with the
blood of the deceased coupled with not only stains
of blood do figure in and around the rickshaw in

question, it can safely be observed that the solitary

n

-8-

statement of the complainant does not find its
positive support from the circumstantial evidence
and it shall not skip the attention of the Court about
the chequered history of the blood feud enmity of
the parties, it is hard to believe the story of
prosecution regarding the mode and manner of the
occurrence and the Court is left with no option but
to observe that the occurrence has not taken place in
the mode and the manner 50 alleged and attempted

to substantiate during the trial.

15. The prosecution in this case has also
failed to bring on record any supportive oF
corroborative piece of evidence to prove the guilt
of accused. Circumstantial evidence as weapon of
offence could not have been secured and recovered
during the investigation. The appellant/complainant
disclosed in his statement as well as in the crime
report that motive for the occurrence is land dispute
and blood feud enmity between the parties, however,
he pointed out in his examination-in-cross that as
some 150 years ago the grandfathers of deceased
namely Abdul Rahman and Gul Dad Khan were
done to death by forefathers of the accused. He
admitted that the previous enmity was between their

predecessor and the predecessor of the acquitted co-

accused and not with the predecessor of respondent/

Wy

a0

accused, Nothing in black & white has been
produced regarding the alleged motive. No doubt,
motive is a circumstantial evidence and it is not fatal
at all but by now it is well settled, the motive once
alleged is to be proved; otherwise, it will adversely
affect the prosecution case because motive is a

double edged weapon and cuts both ways.

16. The medical evidence can no way pin
point the accused nor can establish the identity of
the accused. It is hard fact that medical evidence can
never be considered to be a corroborative piece of
evidence and at the most can be considered a
supporting evidence only to the extent of
specification of seat of injuries, the weapon of
offence, duration, the cause of death etc.
“Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State” (2018 SCMR
772), “Tariq Hussain and another Vs. The State

and 04 others” (2018 MLD 1573 [Federal Shariat
Court]).

17. Admittedly, after the commission of
offence, the respondent/accused was in hiding and
his service was attempted through warrant of arrest
under Section 204 Cr.PC followed by proclamation
notice under Section 87 Cr.PC followed by formal

order of the learned trial Court to declare the
-9-

accused. Nothing in black & white has been
produced regarding the alleged motive. No doubt,
motive is a circumstantial evidence and it is not fatal
at all but by now it is well settled, the motive once
alleged is to be proved; otherwise, it will adversely
affect the prosecution case because motive is a

double edged weapon and cuts both ways.

16, The medical evidence can no way pin
point the accused nor can establish the identity of
the accused. It is hard fact that medical evidence can
never be considered to be a cotroborative piece of
evidence and at the most can be considered a
supporting evidence only to the extent of
specification of seat of injuries, the weapon of
offence, duration, the cause of death etc.
“Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State” (2018 SCMR
772), “Tariq Hussain and another Vs. The State

and 04 others” (2018 MLD 1573 [Federal Shariat
Court).

17. Admittedly, after the commission of
offence, the respondent/accused was in hiding and
his service was attempted through warrant of arrest
under Section 204 Cr.PC followed by proclamation
notice under Section 87 Cr.PC followed by formal

order of the learned trial Court to declare the
-10-

accused as proclaimed offender. But it shall not skip
the attention of the Court that not only the accused
persons, irrespective of their innocence or otherwise,
they skip from the scene, particularly during the
patience cooling period but also for a considerable
length so as to avoid animosity & hostility of the
bereaved family but also to avoid gravity of the

situation.

18. Even otherwise abscondence is a
corroborative piece of evidence, it cannot be taken
into consideration in isolation but has to be taken
into consideration with substantive piece of
evidence. The august Apex Court has declared the
abscondence as just a corroborative piece of
evidence and can no way be considered as
substantive evidence followed by conviction of the
accused on its strength. “Asadullah vy. Muhammad
Ali” (PLD_ 1971 SC 541) observed that both
corroborative and ocular evidence are to be read
together and not in isolation. In the case of “Rasool
Muhammad Vs. Asal Muhammad” (1995 SCMR
1373), the august Apex Court observed that
abscondence is only a suspicion circumstance. In the
case of “Muhammad Sadiq vy. Najeeb Ali” (1995
SCMR 1632) it is observed that abscondence itself

has no value in the absence of any other evidence. It
efi s

was also held in the case of “Muhammad Khan v.
State” (1999 SCMR 1220) that abscondence of the
accused can never remedy the defects in the
prosecution case. In the case of “Gul Khan y, State”
(1999 SCMR_ 304), it was observed that
abscondence per se is not sufficient to prove the
guilt but can be taken as a corroborative piece of
evidence. In the cases of “Muhammad Arshad v.
Qasim Ali” (1992 SCMR 814), “Pir Badshah v.
State” (1985 SCMR 2070) and “Amir Gul v. State”
(1981 SCMR 182), it was observed that conviction
on abscondence alone cannot be sustained. In the
present case, substantive piece of evidence in the
shape of ocular account has been disbelieved,
therefore, no conviction can be based on

abscondence alone.

19. Moreover, this Court, in Cr.A,No.59-
D/2006 of co-accused Zarif Khan, has disbelieved
the statement of the appellant/complainant and
acquitted him of the charges, vide judgment, dated
28.10.2010. The peculiar facts and circumstances
are sufficient enough that the prosecution could

not be able to discharge the burden of proof.

20. It is well settled, benefit of doubt is not

a grace but right of the accused and it is not
ig

necessary that there should be many circumstances
creating doubts, even a single circumstance, creating
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt
of accused, makes him entitled to its benefit, not as a
matter of grace & concession but as a matter of
right. Reference is made to the case "Muhammad

Akram v. State" (2009 SCMR 230).

21. Beside the above, generally the order
of acquittal cannot be interfered with because the
presumption of innocence of the accused is further
strengthened by acquittal. The golden thread which
runs through the web of administration of justice in
criminal cases is that if two views are possible on
the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the
guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence,
the view which is favourable to the accused should
be adopted. The paramount consideration of the
Court is to ensure that miscarriage of justice is
prevented. A miscarriage of justice which may arise
from acquittal of the guilty is less than the
conviction of an innocent. In a case where
admissible evidence is ignored, a duty is cast upon
the appellate Court to re-appreciate the evidence in a
case where the accused has been acquitted, or the
purpose of ascertaining as to whether the accused

committed the offence or not. The principle to be
18}10

« [3:-

followed by this Court considering the appeal
against the judgment of acquittal is, to interfere only
when there are compelling and substantial reasons
for doing so, If the impugned judgment is clearly
unreasonable, only then it is a compelling reason for

interference.

22. For the afore-stated reasons, learned
counsel representing the appellant/complainant
could not point out any illegality and material
irregularity in the impugned judgment so that the
Court could incline to interfere in the impugned

judgment of the learned trial Court.

23. Resultantly, this appeal having no
merit and substance stands dismissed.
Announced.
