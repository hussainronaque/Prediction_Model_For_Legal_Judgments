QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- = Since this

petition for post arrest’ bail by
accused/petitioners, Sana-ur-Rehman and
Niaz sons of Muhammad Bashir and bail
cancellation application (BCA) by
Shamshad_ Bibi, complainant/petitioner,
against their father and _ co-accused,
Muhammad Bashir pertain to the same
case FIR No.284 dated 03.07.2015 under
Section 302 PPC read with Section 34 PPC,
Police Station Oghi, this single order shall
also dispose of the connected Cr.M/BCA

No.386-A/2015.
2. The FIR was lodged on the report of
Mst. Shamshad Bibi, complainant, who
reported to Muhammad Zaman ASHO in
CH Oghi at 20:30 hours on 03.07.2015
that on the eventful date at 0715 P.M she
heard noise outside and when she came
out of her house she found
accused/petitioners Sana-ur-Rehman and
Niaz along with their brother and co-
accused Naseer as well as their father
Muhammad Bashir, accused/respondent in
BCA, abusing and beating her son Fayaz
Muhammad with fists and kicks near the
mosque and meanwhile Naseer hit her son
with his axe on back side of his head. She
reportedly raised alarm which attracted
Fagir Muhammad son of Amjad and Badri
son of Khani Zaman as well as other co-
villagers, who saw the occurrence with
their own eyes. The accused made good
their escape from the scene of occurrence,
with whom the complainant had no

previous enmity, but the daughter in law
of accused/respondent Muhammad Bashir
was trying to allure her son which had
caused annoyance to the accused.

3. The Postmortem examination of the
then injured, who later on succumbed to
the injuries on his way to KTH Mansehra,
revealed an incised wound at the junction
of head and neck and another lacerated
big wound on the occipital region of head.
All the accused were arrested in the case,
but co-accused Muhammad Bashir has
been released on bail on the twin grounds
of his old age and infirmity as well as
having being attributed the role of giving
fist/kick blows, vide order of the learned
ASJ-V, Mansehra, dated 24.07.2015,
whereby bail was declined to the
accused/petitioner in the instant bail
petition. It may also be noted here that
co-accused Naseer Ahmed, who has been
attributed the effective role of axe blows
on the head of deceased, Fayaz

Muhammad, and who led the police to the
place where the axe was kept after the
occurrence and also handed over the same
to the I.0 is not a petitioner in the instant
bail petition. After completion — of
investigation in the case, the local
police/prosecution has submitted complete

challan in the case on 10.07.2015.

4. Arguments of the learned counsel
for the  accused/petitioners, learned
counsel for accused/respondent
Muhammad Bashir in BCA/Cr.M No.386-
A/2015, State Counsel assisted by learned
counsel for complainant heard, and record
perused.

5. Adverting to the BCA, in the first
instance, suffice it to say that apart from
the fact that there is no indication of
misuse of the concession of bail on the
part of accused/respondent, Muhammad
Bashir, the accused/respondent was
assigned the ineffective role of fist and
kick blows to the deceased, and was

admitted to bail on the main consideration
of old age and infirmity, which are not
belied by the available record. As such, the
impugned bail order does not appear to be
perverse or _ capricious, calling for
interference by this Court. It may not be
out of place to mention here that the
accused/petitioner along with his three
sons have been implicated in the case, but
the effective role of inflicting axe blow on
the head of deceased leading to his death
was specifically assigned to son of the
accused/respondent namely Naseer while
the accused/respondent and his two other
sons and accused/petitioner in the instant
bail petition namely Sana-ur-Rehman and
Niaz were ascribed the ineffective role of
fist and kick blows to the deceased.
Therefore, the bail cancellation application
is dismissed.

6. As regards the instant bail
petition, it may be pointed out that beside
the release of co-accused and father of the

accused/petitioners, imputed a similar role
in the FIR, has been released on bail,
albeit on the additional ground of old age,
and petition for cancellation of his bail has
been dismissed vide this order, the
medical/P.M report does not show cause of
death as fist and kick blows, rather the
cause of death has been clearly shown as
injuries by sharp weapon to vital organs,
thereby making role of the
accused/petitioners in the commission of
the offence that of further inquiry.

7. Above all, the
accused/petitioners have been arrested
immediately after the occurrence and are
behind the bars since then, without
recovery of anything incriminating from
their possession or on their piontation or
making any confessional statement; while,
on the other hand, investigation in the
case is complete as complete challan has
been submitted on 10.07.2015, implying
thereby that the accused/petitioners are

no longer required to the
police/prosecution for the purpose of
investigation. As such, no useful purpose is
going to be served by further retaining the
accused/petitioners in jail.

8. Consequently, on the
acceptance of the application, the
accused/petitioners, Sana-ur-Rehman and
Niaz sons of Muhammad Bashir, are
admitted to bail, provided they furnish bail
bonds in the sum of Rs.100000/- each with
two sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial

Magistrate.
