and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment each and to
pay Rs.50,000/- each, as compensation to legal heirs of
Habib Ullah deceased in terms of section 544-A Cr.P.C., in
case FIR No.68 dated 23.01.2013, registered under sections
302/324/109/34 PPC, at Police Station Rustam, District
Mardan, however, they have been acquitted under section

324 PPC. Similarly, co-accused Sher Nawas has also been
acquitted, whereas, co-accused Ahmad Nawas has been
declared as Proclaimed Offender. Benefit of section 382-B
Cr.P.C. has been extended to the convicts.

2. The convicts have field the instant appeal against
their conviction and sentences, whereas, Qari Shoaib, the
petitioner, has filed Cr.R. No.23-P/2017, seeking
enhancement of sentences of the convicts/respondents from
life imprisonment to normal penalty of death as provided
for the offence of murder.

3. No appeal has been filed by the
prosecution/complainant against acquittal of co-accused
Sher Nawas as well as acquittal of the convicts under
section 324 PPC.

4. As both, the appeal and the criminal revision arise
out from one and the same judgment of the learned trial
Court dated 19.01.2017, therefore, are being decided
through this common judgment.

5. According to FIR (Exh.PA, the prosecution case is
that on 23.01.2013 at 10.30 A.M, complainant Qeemat
Ullah (PW.7), in company of dead body of his son Habib
Ullah deceased reported to Zahir Shah ASI (PW.3), in
casualty DHQ hospital Mardan to the effect that on the
fateful day he along with his brother Qari Shoaib (PW.8)
and son Habib Ullah deceased, was busy in cutting clover
(Shaftal). They sent Habib Ullah deceased to the house of

his (complainant’s) sister in connection with some work
and at 09.30 A.M when he reached the crime spot, the
appellants along with Ahmad Nawas_ (absconding
co-accused) duly armed with firearms emerged there and
opened fire at the deceased, as a result, he got hit and fell
on the ground. On hue and cry of the complainant and PW
Qari Shoaib, the accused also fired at them, however, they
luckily remained unscathed. A dispute over landed
property has been alleged as motive behind the crime. The
deceased succumbed to injuries on the way to hospital.
Complainant alleged that the occurrence was initiated by
the accused named above at the instigation/behest of Sher
Nawaz (acquitted co-accused). Zahir Shah Khan ASI
(PW.3), recorded report of complainant in the shape of
Murasila Exh.PA/1, which was verified by PW Qari
Shoaib, on the basis whereof FIR Exh.PA, was registered
against the accused. PW.3 prepared injury sheet and
inquest report Exh.PW.3/1 and Exh.PW.3/2 of the
deceased and shifted his dead body to the mortuary for
port-mortem examination under the escort of Sohail FC
No.2545.

6. Dr. Amjid Kakakhel DHQ Hospital Mardan
(PW.1) conducted autopsy on the dead body of the
deceased on 23.01.2013 at 10.50 A.m. and observed a
firearm inlet wound measuring 1x2 inch on front lateral
aspect of thorax, 4 inches below the axilla (left). He

recovered a bullet from posterior body wall of the deceased
just beneath the skin near scapula. He further noticed a
perforating firearm wound on the right deltoid of the
deceased half inch in size. According to his opinion, the
deceased died due to firearm injuries to his left lung and its
blood vessels leading to shock and death. Probable time
between injury and death was opined to be with
45 minutes.

7. Nooran Shah Khan SI (PW.9) was entrusted with
the task of investigation, who proceeded to the spot and
prepared site plan Exh.PB at the pointation of
eyewitnesses. During spot inspection, he secured
bloodstained earth from the place of the deceased vide
recovery memo Exh.PW.6/l and _ recovery memo
Exh.PW.6/2, two empties of 7.62 bore from the places of
the accused. Through recovery memo Exh.PW.6/3, he took
into possession the last worn bloodstained garments of the
deceased, sent by the doctor through Constable Sohail.
Similarly, vide recovery memo Exh.PW.6/4 a_phial
containing spent bullet, sent by the doctor, extracted from
the dead body of the deceased was taken into possession.
He sent the bloodstained earth and garments of the
deceased to FSL and empties for safe custody to the FSL,
report of the former is Exh.PZ, initiated proceedings under
sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. against the accused, recorded
statements of the PWs and after completion of

investigation, handed over the case file to SHO, who
submitted challan under section 512 Cr.P.C., against the
accused.

8. After arrest of the appellants/convicts and
acquitted co-accused Sher Nawas and completion of
necessary investigation, supplementary Challan were
submitted against them before the learned trial Court,
where they were formally charge sheeted to which they
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To prove its case, the
prosecution examined as many as twelve witnesses. After
closure of the prosecution evidence, statements of the
appellants and acquitted co-accused were recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein they denied the prosecution
allegations and professed innocence. They, however,
declined to be examined on oath under section 340(2)
Cr.P.C. or to produce evidence in defence. On conclusion
of trial, the learned trial court after hearing both the sides,
convicted and sentenced the appellants as mentioned
above, however, acquitted co-accused Sher Nawas vide
judgment impugned herein.

9. Reader of the Court apprised us that in early hours,
Syed Mubashir Shah, Advocate, counsel for the
complainant appeared and marked his attendance with him
but at the time of call, the learned counsel did not turn up
despite sufficient wait. The conduct of the learned counsel
being against the professional ethic is highly deplorable.

This being appeal pertaining to the year 2017, cannot be
kept pending for more period, particularly, when learned
counsel for the complainant is in the know of fixation of
date of hearing, hence, after hearing learned counsel for the
appellant and learned AAG for the State, the appeal and
connected revision petition are being decided on the
available record.

10. It appears from record that occurrence has taken
place on 23.01.2013 in a broad daylight at 09.30 A.M
which has been reported by complainant Qeemat Ullah
(PW.7) at 10.30 A.M. i.e. after one hour in DHQ hospital
Mardan. In the FIR, Qeemat Ullah complainant (PW.7)
himself and Qari Shoaib (PW.8), has been shown to be the
eyewitnesses of the occurrence. Both of them are closely
related to the deceased because the former is father and the
latter is uncle of the deceased. Complainant (PW.7) has
admitted that he was serving in police department for the
last 20/25 years. Similarly, Qari Shoaib (PW.8) in the very
first line of his cross-examination has admitted that he was
Pesh Imam (Prayer Leader) in Gul Bahar Peshawar for the
last 15 years and that a day or two in a week he used to
visit his village. In cross-examination complainant (PW.7)
deposed that accused had direct enmity with him and PW
Qari Shoaib. In this view of the matter both the alleged
eyewitnesses being closely related to the deceased, living
in different areas, having direct enmity/motive with the

appellants are interested, inimical as well as chance
witnesses. Chance witness is one who should not normally
be where and when he professes to have been. No doubt,
on mere close relationship of a witness with the deceased
having motive with the accused or being a chance witness,
his/her testimony cannot be discarded provided the same is
trustworthy, confidence inspiring and corroborated by
other strong circumstances of the occurrence. Similarly, for
believing and relying upon the testimony of an eyewitness,
who claims his/her presence at the spot at the time of
occurrence must satisfy mind of the Court about his
purpose of presence through some physical circumstance
or through some corroborative evidence.

11. Taking the case in hand on the touch stone of the
above principles, we will reappraise the testimonies of
Qeemt Ullah (PW.7) and Qari Shoaib (PW.8), the
purported eyewitnesses. The former while appearing as
PW.7 reiterated the same story as set forth by him in the
initial report/Murasila Exh.PA/1. In cross-examination, he
deposed that he was serving in police department for the
last 20/25 years, during which tenure; he remained in
various Police Stations, namely, Police Station Kalu Khan,
Topi and Industrial area of District Swabi. He admitted that
during the days of occurrence he was posted in Police
Station Kalu Khan District Swabi. He further deposed that
his brother Qari Shoaib (PW.8) was Pesha Imam in

Peshawar during the days of occurrence. Record depicts
that deceased has been done to death in field of the
complainant, situated in Garakol Bhai Khan, District
Mardan. An iota of evidence either oral or documentary in
the shape of attendance Register/record of Police Station
Kalu Khan has not been brought on record by PW.7 to
substantiate that on the crucial day he was on leave from
duty. He has not furnished any explanation, much less
plausible, as to how he along with deceased and PW
Shoaib got to gathered or accompanied each other on the
day of occurrence to the spot, particularly, when
complainant has admitted that PW Shoaib is residing in
separate house. Complainant and PW Shoaib have not
sustained any injury despite the fact that accused were
having direct enmity with them. Complainant has stated
that accused did not come a step towards them after firing
at the deceased. In his initial report, the complainant has
not stated a single word about taking shelter at the time of
occurrence but in his court statement he while making
improvement to bring his stance in consonance of
prosecution case, deposed that PW Shoaib had taken
shelter from firing behind the (Bosara). Making target an
innocent chap/the deceased and letting off the complainant
and PW Shoaib by the accused who had direct motive with
them is beyond the comprehension of a prudent mind. In
the FIR, general role of firing upon the deceased has been

attributed to the appellants and absconding co-accused by
the complainant. In addition, it was narrated by
complainant that on raising hue and cry by them, they were
also fired by the accused, but neither he nor PW Shoaib has
sustained any injury, therefore, in order to bring his
testimony in line with the prosecution case by taking
summersault he deposed that he had not stated in his report
that accused also made firing at them, which not only
amounts to dishonest improvement, but by taking U-turn,
he has negated his version originated in the FIR and even
in his examination in chief. Complainant showed his
inability about the time on which they left for the field for
cutting Shaftal. He admitted that Bala Garhi hospital falls
in the way while coming from the spot to Mardan but they
did not take the deceased then injured to the said hospital.
He admitted that there are so many Police Stations while
proceeding from the spot to hospital at Mardan. Dr. Amjid
Khan (PW.1) has opined about the time between injury and
death of the deceased as “within 45 minutes”. Had the
complainant (PW.7) been present at the spot, he would
have shifted his deceased then injured son to Bala Garhi
hospital so as to save his life within 45 minutes and would
have informed the Police Stations falling in the way from
spot to Mardan. Had he been present at the spot, his clothes
and hands would have been smeared with blood of the
deceased in lifting him/shifting him to the hospital, but no

such clothes have been produced before the I.O. The above
10

discussed circumstances create serious doubts about
presence of the complainant at the spot at the time of
occurrence.
12. Qari Shoaib while appearing as PW.8 deposed that
on the day of occurrence he along with his brother Qeemat
Ullah complainant (PW.7) and deceased Habib Ullah was
present in their fields and were busy in cutting fodder for
the cattle. They sent Habib Ullah deceased to the house of
their sister for some work when in the meanwhile the
appellants along with their absconding co-accused duly
armed with firearms emerged there and opened fire at the
deceased, as a result, he got hit and injured. On their hue
and cry, the accused also fired at them but they luckily
escaped unhurt. The deceased then injured succumbed to
the injuries on the way to hospital. In the hospital the
complainant reported the occurrence and he verified his
report.

In cross-examination PW.8 deposed that he was
Pesh Imam in Gul Bahar Peshawar for the last 15 years. He
used to visit his house in the villagefor a day or two in a
week, while the remaining days of the week he used to say
at Peshawar. He further deposed that he does not remember
whether they had collected, stocked any heap of the cut
clove (Shaftal). He disclosed that he was listening report of
his brother (complainant) when it was being recorded,

wherein he (complainant) stated to the author of report that
11

accused were armed with Kalashnikovs. A look over the
initial report Exh.PA/1 reveals that only words “Aslaha
Atesheen” has been mentioned by complainant. As two
crime empties of 7.62 bore have been shown recovered
from the spot, therefore, PW Qari Shoaib in order to bring
in line his testimony with the prosecution case introduced
Kalashnikovs in the report of complainant. This dishonest
improvement made by him negates the report as well as
testimony of complainant. He deposed that at the time of
occurrence other co-villagers were busy in the Zamidara
work at some distance from them and the accused might
have seen those persons at the time of occurrence.
Contrary, complainant PW.7 deposed that except them no
one was there in the fields at the time of occurrence. PW.8
while contradicting the testimony of complainant deposed
that they had not taken shelter behind the hayrick (Bosara).
The testimonies of both the alleged eyewitnesses are
contradictory with each other on material events and
circumstances of the occurrence. Both have failed to prove
their presence at the spot through physical circumstance or
corroborative evidence. Neither any grass allegedly cut by
the PWs nor any sickle has been shown recovered from the
spot so as to corroborate their testimonies and establish
their presence.

12. The Investigation Officer has visited the spot on

the same day, but the spot inspection report is silent about
12

availability of any sheet (chadar) or sickle. Even no area
has been noticed by the I.O. wherefrom fodder had been
reap by the alleged eyewitnesses. The deceased has
sustained single firearm entry wound and a perforating
firearm wound on his body. A general role of firing has
been attributed to three accused including the appellants.
The effective fire shots on the person of the deceased have
not been specifically attributed to the appellants. No crime
weapon has been recovered either from direct or indirect
possession of the appellants. No FSL report is available
about the two 7.62 bore empties as to whether these have
been fired from one or more than one weapon, however,
from recovery of 7.62 bore empties one thing can be
inferred that weapon used in the offence was Kalashnikov
which is an automatic weapon ejecting number of shots in
seconds. For the sake of arguments if the occurrence is
considered to be the job of three accused then much
damage would have been caused to the deceased and large
number of empties might have been recovered from the
spot, but such is not the case herein. Similarly, escape or
letting off the complainant and PW Shoaib, with whom the
appellants had direct motive is yet another strong
circumstance which pinch a prudent mind about their
presence at the spot. In view of the above, we are firm in
our view that both the purported eyewitnesses being

closely related to the deceased and inimical towards the
13

appellants are interested and procured witnesses. Their
testimonies being suffering from major contradictions and
discrepancies cutting the very roots of the prosecution case
cannot be belied and relied upon for conviction in a capital
charge.

13. Recovery of blood from the spot, the last worn
bloodstained argument of the deceased, positive Serologist
in respect thereof coupled with postmortem of the
deceased, though confirm the unnatural death of the
deceased with firearm at the spot as alleged by the
prosecution, but never tell the names of the culprit (s).
Such pieces of supporting and corroborative evidence are
always taken into consideration along with direct evidence
and not in isolation. In support, reliance can be placed in
on the judgments rendered by the Hon’ble apex court in
Ijaz Ahmed’s case (1997 SCMR 1279 and Asadullah’s
case (PLD 1971 SC 541). Besides, in case titled,
“Saifullah vs the State” (1985 SCMR 410), it has been

ruled by the Hon’ble Supreme Court that:-
“When there is no eyewitness to be relied
upon, then there is nothing, which can be
corroborated by the recovery”.
14. As regards abscondence of the appellants, on one
hand it has been denied by the appellants in their
statements under section 342 Cr.P.C., while on the other

hand, it is settled law that mere abscondence of accused,
14

cannot be a substitute of real evidence. Abscondence by
itself would be of no avail to the prosecution in absence of
any other evidence against the absconding accused. Mere
abscondence of accused would not be enough to sustain
convict. Guidance in this regard can be obtained from the
judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled,
“Muhammad Vs Pasham Khan” (1986 SCMR 823).

15. For the reasons discussed above, we are firm in our
view to hold that prosecution has miserably failed to prove
the guilt of the appellants through cogent and confidence
inspiring direct evidence or circumstantial evidence
making an unbroken chain, one end of which touch the
dead body of the deceased and another end the neck of the
appellants. The prosecution evidence is pregnant with
doubts benefit of which should have been extended to the
appellants but the learned trial Court by not appreciating
the evidence in its true perspective landed into the field of
error by holding the appellants guilty of the offence. As
per golden principle of benefit of doubt one substantial
doubt would be enough for acquittal of the accused. Under
principle enunciated by the august apex court of the
country through different pronouncements, by now it is
settled law that conviction must be based on
unimpeachable evidence and certainty of guilt and any
doubt arising in prosecution case must be resolved in

favour of the accused. Indeed, this rule is based on the
15

maxim that “It is better that ten guilty persons be acquitted
rather than one innocent person be convicted”, which
occupied a pivotal place in the Islamic Law and is enforced
strictly in view of the saying of Holy Prophet (PBUH) that
“Mistake of Qazi (judge) in releasing a criminal is better
than his mistake in punishing an innocence person”.
Guidance derived from case titled, “Muhammad Khan
and_ another _vs the State” (1999 SCMR_ 1220) and
“Muhammad Ikram vs the State” (2009 SCMR 230).

16. Yet there is another aspect of the case, the learned
trial Court has convicted and sentenced the appellants
under section 302/34 PPC, by believing and relying upon
the testimony of the purported eyewitnesses, however,
acquitted them under section 324 PPC on the same set of
evidence, by applying the principle/rule of “sifting grain
from the chaff’ which principle/rule has been done away
with by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in its authoritative
and elaborate judgment, rendered in case of Hizar Hayat
(PLD 2019 SC-527) by dilating upon the entire law on the
principle right from 1925 till date. The relevant part of the

judgment is reproduced below:-
“We may observe in the end that a judicial system
which permits deliberate falsehood is doomed to fail
and a society which tolerates it is destined to self-
destruct. Truth is the foundation of justice and justice
is the core and bedrock of a civilized society and,

thus, any compromise on truth amounts to a
16

compromise on a society's future as a just, fair and
civilized society. Our judicial system has suffered a
lot as a consequence of the above mentioned
permissible deviation from the truth and it is about
time that such a colossal wrong may be rectified in
all earnestness. Therefore, in light of the discussion
made above, we declare that the rule falsus in uno,
falsus in omnibus shall henceforth be an integral
part of our jurisprudence in criminal cases and
the same shall be given effect to, followed and
applied by all the courts in the country in its
letter and spirit.” (Emphasis supplied)

17. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed, conviction and
sentences of the appellants/convicts recorded vide
impugned judgment dated 19.01.2017, are hereby set-aside
and both are acquitted from the charges leveled against
them. They be set at liberty forthwith, if not confined in
any other case.

18. On acquittal of the convicts, the connected Cr.R.
No.23-P/2017, titled, “Qari Shoaib vs Bakht Nawas etc”
has become infructuous, which is hereby dismissed.

19. These are the reasons of our short order of even
date, which is reproduced below:-

“For reasons to be recorded later, we allow this
appeal, set-aside the conviction and sentences of the
appellants, namely, (1) Bakht Nawas and (2) Jihad
Ali, recorded under section 302/34 PPC by the
learned trial Court/ Additional Sessions Judge-II,
Mardan, vide judgment dated 19.01.2017, in case FIR
No.68 dated 23.01.2013, under sections
17

302/324/109/34 PPC, Police Station Rustam Mardan
and hereby acquit them from the charge in the cited
case. They be set at liberty forthwith, if not confined

in any other case.
