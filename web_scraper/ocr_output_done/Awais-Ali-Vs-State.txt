ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- Petitioner Awais Ali son
of Sabit Ali, seeks post arrest bail in case FIR No.136
dated 15.02.2018, registered under section 9 (c ) Control
of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 in Police Station City
Kohat.

2. As per contents of FIR, prosecution case against
the petitioner is that on 15.02.2018 at 0910 hours, he while
travelling in a Suzuki vehicle as a passenger having a
plastic sack, was deboarded by Fayaz Khan SHO along
with other police officials, in front of old Tablighi Markaz
Hangu road Kohat and on search of the sack, recovered
08 packets charas Gardha, each packet weighing 1200
grams, making the total of 9600 grams. From each packet,

05 grams were separated and sealed in parcel as sample for
chemical analysis by the FSL. The petitioner was arrested
there and then, hence, this case.

3. Having heard the arguments of learned counsel for
the parties, it appears from the FIR that neither the Suzuki
in which the petitioner was allegedly trafficking narcotics
has been taken into possession nor has its driver, conductor
or any passenger has been cited as witness to the recovery
proceeding, so much so that the name of driver and
registration of the Suzuki vehicle is a shrouded mystery. In
absence of the above crucial pieces of evidence, whether
the prosecution would be able to prove the guilt of the
petitioner in the mode and manner as alleged in the FIR, is
a serious debatable question which makes the case of the
petitioner arguable for the purpose of bail. The petitioner
has no previous history of involvement in such like
offence. Investigation qua him is complete and he is no
more required for further interrogation. Thus, keeping him
behind the bars will serve no useful purpose. It is settled
law that a mistaken relief of bail can be repaired by
convicting the accused if proved guilty during trial, but no
proper reparation can be offered to an accused in case of
his acquittal in the long run.

4. The argument of learned counsel for the petitioner
that learned Judicial Magistrate was not competent to pass
an order of destruction of the case property/narcotics

before trial, is not tenable because under sub-section (4) of
section 33 of Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, a
Narcotic drug, psychotropic substance or controlled
substance seized under this Act shall be disposed of under
section 516A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898
(Act V of 1898). The 2"! and 3™ provisos attached to
section 516A Cr.P.C. provide a proper mechanism for
destruction of dangerous drug, intoxicant, intoxicating
liquor or any other narcotic. For the sake of convenience
and ready reference, the aforesaid provisos are reproduced
below:-

“Provided further that if the property is dangerous
drug, intoxicant, intoxicating liquor or any other
narcotic substances seized or taken into custody
under Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930 (II of 1930), the
Customs Act, 1969 (IV of 1969), the Prohibition
(Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979 (P.O. 4 of

1979), or any other law for the time being in force,

the Court may, either on an application or of its
own motion and under its supervision and
control, obtain and prepare such number of
samples of the property as it may deem fit for
safe_custody and production before it or any
other Court and cause destruction of the
remaining portion of the property under a
certificate issued by it in that behalf; (Emphasis
supplied).

Provided also that such samples shall be
deemed _to be whole of the property in any

inquiry or proceedings in relation to such offence

before any authority or Court.” (emphasis
supplied).
5. The Statutes governing the destruction of seized
narcotics do not provide any specific time for such
destruction. The words “such samples shall be deemed
to be whole of the property in any inquiry or
proceedings in relation to such offence before any
authority or Court” employed in 3rd proviso to section
561A Cr.P.C. empowered the Court to pass an order of
destruction of narcotics at any stage which may even be
before the trial. In this case, the learned Judicial
Magistrate, Kohat on the direction of the learned Sessions
Judge, after adopting the mechanism provided under 2"
and 3rd provisos to section 516A Cr.P.C. has ordered the
destruction of narcotics and in this regard has also issued a
proper certificate under his signature and seal of the Court.
4. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he
furnishes bail bonds in the sum of rupees two lacs with two
local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD concerned.
