MUHAMMAD NASIR MAHFOOZ, J:- Through the

instant petition, petitioner Mst. Haseena seeks her release
on bail in case FIR No.48 dated 06/07/2018 under
Section 9-C CNSA, Police Station RD/ANF, Peshawar.

2. According to prosecution case, during
Nakabandi, the ANF officials deboarded the petitioner
from a passenger Hiace bearing registration No.LES-3232
through lady constable Rafida Bibi, who was having a
minor girl in her lap. On search, five packets of heroin, out

of which two were weighing 1100 grams each, two were
ia

500 grams each and one was weighing 130 grams (total
3.330Kg ) were recovered by lady constable from the
immediate possession of petitioner, which she had tied
with her body. Consequently the contraband were taken
into custody, petitioner was arrested and a case vide FIR
mentioned above was registered against her.

3. I have heard learned counsel for the
petitioner, learned Special Prosecutor for ANF and gone
through the record.

4, Perusal of record reveals that at the time of
arrest of petitioner, she was also having a suckling baby of
8 months in her lap, who is still with her inside the jail.
Though considerable quantity of heroin has been
recovered from the possession of petitioner but she is also
having a suckling baby who is still kept in jail with her
mother for no sin. She is kept in jail with her mother for
her welfare. The concept of welfare of minor is
incompatible with jail life, so instead of detaining the
innocent baby infant in the jail for the crime allegedly
committed by her mother, it would be in the interest of
justice as well as welfare of minor if her mother

(petitioner) is released on bail. Wisdom can be derived
from the famous case of Ghamidiyya, wherein the Holy
Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) had
suspended the sentence of a pregnant woman, not only till
delivery of her child but also till suckling period i.e, two
years, obviously for the welfare of her child, which shows
paramount importance and significance of the right of a
suckling baby in Islam and the unprecedented care taken
of, and the protection given to a child or expected to be
born, by our Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon
Him). Hence while following the golden principle of
administration of justice enunciated by the Holy Prophet
Muhammad (PBUH), this Court without touching the
merits of the case, accept the instant bail petition and
admit the petitioner to bail provided she furnishes bail in
the sum of Rs.50,000/- (Fifty thousand) with two sureties
each in the like amount to the satisfaction of learned

Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate concerned.
