amended and quota be _ reserved for

2. Brief facts of the case are that the respondents

have introduced Associate Degree in Education, which is two

years degree program leading to B.Ed (Hons), a total four (04)

years program policy vide Notification No. SOF/E&SE/1-

25/2010 dated 22.7.2010, however, in the said Notification, it

was also declared that Associate Degree in Education equal to

Bachelor Degree and B.Ed (Hons) equal to Master Degree and

this fact was also approved by the Higher Education

Commission vide Notifications dated 25.10.2011 and

29.3.2007. The petitioners along with others applied for the

said program and have successfully completed the Associate

Degree in Education and B.Ed (Hons). That the respondents

had advertised certain posts of C.T. (Certified Teacher), PST

(Primary School Teacher) and SST (Secondary School

Teacher) along with others, for which, test and interview were

conducted but the petitioners were straight away refused the

posts for the reason that no policy has yet been made for

Associate Degree in Education and B.Ed (Hons). The

petitioners filed two Writ Petitions No. 842-P/2013 & 08-
3

P/2015 before this Court, which were disposed of vide order

dated 28.10.2015 and sent the cases to the Departmental

Authority with direction to pass an appropriate order as per

concession and preference committed by them in documents

annexed with writ petition at serial No. 10 to 17. The final

decision should be made within one month positively. The

above said order was not implemented, the petitioners had

filed C.0.C. No. 24-P/2016 before this Court, which was

dismissed vide order dated 29.3.2016 because the respondents

have complied with order of this Court dated 28.10.2015

delivered in Writ Petitions No. 842-P/2013 and Writ Petition

No. 08-P/2015 by issuing a speaking order dated 1.1.2016 and

the petitioners would be at liberty to challenge the same before

competent court of law; hence, the instant Writ Petition.

3. Comments were called from respondents No.

2 to 5, which they accordingly furnished and denied the

assertion of petitioners by stating that the matter/issue has

already been adjudicated upon by this Court and now the

petitioners have again agitated the same; hence, they prayed

that the Writ Petition may be dismissed with heavy cost.
28.10.2015 in WP No. 842-P/2013 moved by some of the

petitioners directed the departmental authorities to pass an

appropriate order as per concession and preference committed

by them vide different documents / letters. Subsequently COC

4

Arguments heard and record perused.

Previously this Court vide order / judgment dated

No.24-P/2016 was entertained and it was held as under:-

representation of the employees / petitioners was passed after

thorough deliberation and was rejected, inter alia on the

“Show cause notice was issued to the
respondents and they were also directed to
file their reply, which they accordingly
furnished wherein they have stated that order
of this Court has been complied with and a
speaking order was issued to the petitioners
on 1.1.2016. In these circumstances, the
instant petition has served out its purpose.
Dismissed as such, however, the petitioners
would be at liberty to challenge order dated
1.1.2016 annexed with the reply of
respondents before competent court of law.”

The order dated 1.1.2016, whereby the appeal /

following grounds:-

i)

ii)

Because the Govt. was always empowered to
make alter or modify the policy and to
enhance the qualification for a particular post
which could not be challenged. The govt. of
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa introduced a_ policy
with bonafide intention within the interest of
public at large iie 25% by promotion on
seniority cum fitness.

Because the competent authority has not
made such commitment vide which your
people are exempted from the competitive
5

recruitment process. Furthermore, you are at
liberty to participate in the recruitment
process. If found fit and eligible then you will
be appointed under the rules and existing
policy on merit.

iii) Because the work “may” is used in the entire
alleged policy which is not mandatory rather
it is the discretion of the competent authority
how to make appointments /. Recruitment
policy / process with the consent of all
concerned.

iv) Because it is settled principle of law that “a
desire solicited could not be equated to a legal
right, hence, no legal / vested right has been
infringed nor any _ provisions of the
constitution have been violated.

7. This court while sitting in writ jurisdiction cannot
asked the Government to amend, alter, add or subtract
anything in the recruitment, promotion rules, as the same is in
the domain of the Government / Department, unless and until
some discrimination or against the fundamental rights is
agitated. Reliance is placed on 1990 SCMR-1321, (f) titled
Government _of NWFP _ Health And _ Social Welfare
Department through its Secretary versus Dr. Sheikh
Muzaffar Iqbal and others, wherein it has been held as
under:-

(a)
(b).
(c).. .

(f)....Promotion---Vested right---No one can
claim a vested right in promotion or in the
terms and conditions for promotion to a
higher post---Government has the right to
enhance the qualification and the standards
for recruitment and promotion in order to
maintain efficiency in Service---Except for
6

the post which a civil servant happens to
hold, he cannot claim vested right in other
higher tires in the hierarchy.

8. Reiterating the above principles of law, the apex Court

in the case of Muhammad Saddique versus Secretary to

Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Education & others,

reported in PLD-1996, SC-197, again held that Government
has the right to enhance qualification and standards for
recruitment and promotion in order to maintain efficiency in
nature and nobody could claim any vested right in such policy

of government. Likewise, in the case of Zafar Iqbal and

others versus Director, Secondary Education, Multan
Division and others, reported in 2006 SCMR-1427, again
dilated upon the issue and held that government was always
empowered to change promotion policy and domain of the
government to prescribed qualification for a particular post

through amendment in relevant rules was not challengeable.

In the case of Executive District Officer (Revenue)
District _Khushab_ at Jauharabad and other versus Ijaz

Hussain and another, reported in 2011 SCMR-1864, while

dilating upon the “principles of trichotomy of power” it has

been held as under:-
7

---S. 4---Punjab Civil Servants (Appointment and
Conditions of service) Rules, 1974, R. 17---
Constitution of Pakistan, Preamble---Recruitment,
process of policy matter---Academic qualification and
interview marks---Ratio---trichotomy of power---
Scope---Respondents were unsuccessful in selection of
Patwaris and assailed process of selection on the
ground that recruitment policy was defective as it had
reserved 60% marks for academic qualification and
40% for interviews---High Court, in exercise of
constitutional jurisdiction directed the Provincial
Government to amend the recruitment policy and
marks for interview should not exceed 25% of the
total marks---Authorities contended that High Court
could not have issued directions to amend recruitment
policy as such power fell within policy making domain
of the executing authority ---Validity---Recruitment
policy was framed by Provincial Government as part
of delegated legislation and its provisions could not
have been struck down on vague considerations of
being unreasonable or likely to be misused---
Presumptions was that those who exercise such
powers would have done it in a bona fide manner and
if such power was exercised in a malafide manner, it
was the particular mala fide act which could be
challenged and struck down---Provisions did not
become unconstitutional, voilative of fundamental
rights or unreasonable simply because it could be
abused because any provision of law could be misused
if the wielder of power so intended---Framing of
recruitment policy and rules thereunder fell in the
executive domain---Constitution of Pakistan was
based on the principle of trichotomy of powers where
legislature was vested with the functions of law
making, the executive with its enforcement and
judiciary of interpreting the law---Courts could
neither assume the role of policy maker nor that of a
law maker, therefore, to such extent the judgment
passed by High Court was set aside by Supreme
Court.

9. For the reasons recorded hereinabove, this writ

petition is dismissed as such, with no order as to cost.
