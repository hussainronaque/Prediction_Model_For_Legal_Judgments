JUDGMENT

Dr. Khurshid Iqbal, J.-

1. This appeal is directed against the order
dated 06.12.2018, by which the learned Additional
Sessions Judge/ Izafi Zilla Qazi-VI, Swat, dismissed
the complaint of Muhammad Saeed, Jamil Hassan and
Muhammad Israr, the appellants, u/s. 500, PPC, filed
against Haidar Ali and three others, the respondents
herein, Leave to appeal was granted by this Court vide

order dated 18.06.2019.

2. Facts shortly are that the respondents in
representative capacity of residents of village Karakar,
Mian Kalay, submitted an application against the
appellants for legal action against them. The main
allegation of their application was that the appellants
have become a threat to the life and property of the
residents of the village and that they have been

interfering in their rights of drinking and irrigation

water, the enjoyment of their ancestral property in the
village and Shamilat alongwith protected forest area. In
paragraphs-2 and 3 of their application, they alleged
that the appellants are highly influential, enemy of the
State and belong to land and gabza mafia group. The
appellants, then, moved a private complaint against the
respondents u/s. 500, PPC, in which they alleged that
the accusation leveled against them by the respondents
amounts to the offence of defamation as defined in
section 499, PPC, and punishable u/s. 500, PPC. The
learned Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi-VI,
Swat, dismissed the complaint as not maintainable,
vide his order passed on 12.02.2016. The appellants,
then, moved an appeal before this Court, which was
allowed and the case remanded to the learned trial
Court for further proceedings according to law. The
learned trial Court forwarded the complaint to the local
police, who conducted an inquiry and submitted its
report. Further proceedings with the matter, copies of
the relevant papers were provided to the respondents
u/s. 265-C, Cr.P.C. and charge was framed against
them, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed
trial. Thereafter, the respondents submitted an

application for their acquittal u/s. 265-K, Cr.P.C. The

application was allowed and the respondents were

acquitted vide the impugned order dated 06.12.2018.

3. The main ground of this appeal is that
whether the respondents have committed the offence in
hand and that the learned trial Court has passed the

acquittal order against the law and facts.

4. I have heard arguments of Mr. Khurshid
Ali Walikhel, learned counsel for the appellants and
Syed Sultanat Khan, learned counsel for the

respondents and perused the record.

5, The offence of defamation is defined in

section 499, PPC, as under:

“499. Defamation.--- Whoever by words
either spoken or intended to be read, or by
sign or by visible representations, makes
or publishes any imputation concerning
any person intending to harm, or knowing
or having reason to believe that such
imputation will harm, the reputation of
such person, is said except in the cases
hereinafter excepted, to defame that
person.

[..]

Eight Exception.--- Accusation preferred
in good faith to authorized person. It is not

defamation to prefer in good faith an
accusation against any person to any of
those who have lawful authority over that
person with respect to the subject matter
of accusation.

Ninth Exception.--- Imputation made _ in

good faith to person for protection of his
or other's interests. It is not defamation to

make an imputation on the character of
another, provided that the imputation be
made in good faith for the protection of the

Abdu! Saboohi* (3.B) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IQBAL
-4.

interest of the person making it, or of any
other person, or for the public good.”

Following are the ingredients of

defamation:

i. “The making or publishing of an
imputation concerning any person;

ii. Such imputation must have been made:

a) By words either spoken or
intended to be read; or

b) By signs; or
c) By visible representations, and

iii, Such imputations must have been made
with the intention of harming or
knowing, or having reason to believe,
that it will harm the reputation of the
person concerning, whom it is made.”

The main essential of the offence of
defamation is mens rea or intention. The learned trial
Court dismissed the complaint on the basis of ninth

exception to section 499, PPC.

6. Coming to the facts of the case, the record
reveals that while there are certain allegations against
the appellants to the effect that they are enemy of the
State and belong to land and gabza mafia group,
however, the main allegation relates to dispute over
interference by the appellants in the rights of the
residents of the locality in respect of drinking water,
irrigation and the use of Shamilat land of the village
including protected forest. In the second round, the
learned trial Court forwarded the complaint to the local

police, which submitted its report on 28.03.2018. The

Abdut Sabooh!* (.B) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IQBAL
-5-
inquiry report reflects that in fact the dispute between
the parties is over the use of drinking water, irrigation
and Shamilat land. The parties have registered criminal
cases against each other, some of which are still
pending adjudication. The following remarks of the
inquiry report are worth perusal:

7. It appears that the respondents actually
wanted to press into service the factual aspect of the
controversy between them and the appellants in their
application addressed to the Deputy Commissioner,
Swat. In other words, as the inquiry report notes their
intention of harming the appellants could not be
gathered from the contents of the application of the

respondents. It appears that the respondents made

imputation for protection of their own interest and the

Abdu! Sabeoh!* (3.8) RON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Or. KHURSHID IOBAL
-6-

application being on behalf of the residents of the
village, the imputation appears to have been made for
the public good. Moreover, the appellants failed to
show as to what action, particularly in respect of the
imputation has been initiated against them by the
Deputy Commissioner, Swat. In short, the imputations
whatsoever were leveled in connection with the dispute
over irrigation and drinking water and use of Shamilat
land. According to eight exception to section 499,
PPC, an accusation made in good faith against any
person to lawful authorities does not constitute
defamation. Similarly, as noted above, an accusation in
good faith for protection of the interest of the person
making it or of any other person or for the public good
also do not constitute the offence of defamation. The
issues of irrigation and drinking water and the use of
Shamilat land including the protected forest, pertain to
the duties of the Deputy Commissioner to whom the
application was made. The contents of the application
categorically reflect that the imputations were not
independent, rather, the main issue between the parties
was over the enjoyment of drinking and irrigation
water and the use of Shamilat land. Moreover, there is
nothing on the record that the application was put in

the public domain through publication.

8, For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that
the learned trial Court has rightly dismissed the
complaint and acquitted the respondents u/s. 265-K,
Cr. P.C. A bare perusal of the provision contained in
section 265-K, Cr. P.C. would show that the trial Court
has the power to acquit an accused at any stage even
without recording of evidence. For the sake of

guidance, reference may be made to the recent case

law. In the case of Abbas Haider Naqvi and another

ys. Federation Of Pakistan and others reported as
PLD 2022 Supreme Court 562, the Hon’ble apex

Court held:

“11. First of all, we would like to state that
there can be no cavil to the rule of practice
and propriety, referred to by the High
Court, that when the trial is near
completion, the fate of the case should not
ordinarily be decided under Section 265-K
of the Cr.P.C. There may however be such
exceptional circumstances which may
justify departure from the said rule, as
there is hardly any rule of practice which
does not admit exception(s). Even
otherwise, Section 265-K of the Cr.P.C.
provides that the trial court can make an
order of acquittal at any stage of the case,
and such stage may be an initial stage of
the case on taking cognizance before
recording of the prosecution evidence, or it
may be a later stage of the case after
recording of some evidence of the
prosecution. No absolute’ bar, in
derogation of the law, can therefore be put
on the statutory power of the trial court to
entertain an application under Section
265-K, Cr.P.C. and decide upon its merits
at a later stage of the trial if the
exceptional circumstances of the case call
for so doing to prevent the abuse of the
process of court or to secure the ends of

Abdu Saboon!* (5.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IQBAL
-8-

justice. The High Court has, however,
failed to appreciate that the said rule has
no application to a ground pleaded by an
accused for his acquittal under Section
265-K of the Cr.P.C., which does not
require appraisal of the prosecution
evidence recorded during trial, such as, the
ground pleaded by the Petitioners in the
present case.

12. Ordinarily, an accused, who invokes
Section 265-K5 Cr.P.C. for his acquittal,
pleads that there is no probability of his
being convicted of any offence in the case
on any of the following four grounds: (i)
that even if the facts alleged by the
prosecution are taken to be true on their
face value, they do not make out/constitute
the commission of any offence by the
accused;6 (ii) that there is no evidence or
incriminating material on record of the
case in support of the commission of the
alleged offence by the accused;7 (iii) that
the evidence or incriminating material
collected during investigation in support of
the commission of the alleged offence and
proposed to be produced during trial is
insufficient and, even if recorded, will not
sustain conviction of the accused, of any
offence in the case;8 and (iv) that the
prosecution evidence so far recorded does
not make out a case for conviction of the
accused, of any offence in the case and the
remaining prosecution evidence, even if
recorded, will not improve the prosecution
case against the accused in any manner.”

This Court in State through Advocate

General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar vy.
Gulfam Hussain and_another (2018 YLR 1223),

observed as under:

“Recording of entire evidence is not
necessary for acquittal of an accused
rather at any stage the Court while
exercising powers under section 265-K, Cr.
P.C., can acquit the accused if there is no
probability of his conviction in any
offence. Mere naming of respondents on
the basis of suspicion and rumors, is not

Abdul Saboohi* GB) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Or. KHURSHID IQBAL
-9-

sufficient to establish their guilt,
particularly, when the same has no
corroboration from ocular or
circumstantial evidence.”

9. In light of the above discussion, the

instant appeal is found to be meritless. It is, thus,

dismissed.
