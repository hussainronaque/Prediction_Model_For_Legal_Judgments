RREKRRRREEK

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- This is a petition filed by Salamatullah S/o
Haji Abdul Qadeem R/o Nasirpur District Peshawar, under Article 199 of
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, for a direction or
writ in the nature of mandamus to release him on probation as per laid
down provisions in Section 2 of “The Good Conduct Prisoner’s
Probational Release Act, 1926” read with Rule 9 of “The Good

Conduct Prisoner’s Probational Release Rules, 1927”.

2. The facts of the case, in brief, are that after a full dressed trial in
crime No.41 dated 14.06.2011 registered under Section 9 (c) of the
Control of Narcotics Substances Act, 1997 of Police Station Anti-
Narcotics Force (ANF), Peshawar. The petitioner was convicted and
sentenced to life imprisonment by the learned Special Court, Peshawar,
constituted under the Control of Narcotics Substances Act vide judgment
dated 18.10.2012. Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.PC was extended to him
and the said judgment of the learned trial Court was upheld by this Court
as well as by the Apex Court, thus his conviction & sentence attained

finality. In earlier round of litigation, the petitioner filed Constitutional

petition bearing No.3970-P of 2018 for his release on probation, which
was disposed of with the direction to exhaust alternate remedy as
provided under Section 2 of “The Good Conduct Prisoner’s
Probational Release Act, 1926” vide judgment dated 20.12.2018. In
pursuance thereof, the petitioner as well as his wife submitted
applications to the respondent No.2 for release of the petitioner on
probation, however, till date it was not responded, which necessitated to

file the instant petition.

3. We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and

scanned the record with their able assistance.

4, It transpires from the record that in earlier round of litigation, the
petitioner had sought the same relief under Section 2 of “The Good
Conduct Prisoner’s Probational Release Act, 1926” read with Rule 9
of “The Good Conduct Prisoner’s Probational Release Rules, 1927”,
which was declined firstly, on the ground that he has not served out 10
years of his substantive sentence so as to bring his case within the ambit
of Rule 9 of the ibid Rules and secondly, that the petitioner has not
exhausted the alternate remedy as provided under Section 2 of the Act-X
of 1926. However, it was observed that the petitioner shall be at liberty to
approach the proper forum for redressal of his grievance under the ibid
Act and Rules, if so advised. In pursuance thereof, the petitioner as well
his wife filed representations for redressal of the grievance of the
petitioner before respondent No.2 (Secretary Home), which has not been
responded till today. We observe that Islamic Injunctions and teachings

grant to every aggrieved person the freedom to lodge protest. Every

aggrieved person has a right of representation. He is free to lodge an
appeal against an order affecting him adversely and it is his right that his
appeal will be adjudicated upon without inordinate delay by an
independent tribunal. He can, under no circumstances be stopped from
exercising his basic right. In this context reference may be made to the

following two Ayaats of Holy Quran:--

i. Ayat No.148 Sura 4 Al-Nisa of Holy Quran:
"Allah does not love the public utterance of hurtful
speech, unless (it be) by one to whom injustice has been

done."

ii. Ayat No.1 Sura 58 Al-Mujadilah (The Pleading one) of
Holy Quran:

"Allah indeed knows the plea of the woman who pleads

with you about her husband and complains to Allah, and

Allah knows the contentions of both of you; Surely Allah

is Hearing, Seeing."

Ayat No.1 of Sura Mujadilah, quoted above, has a reference to one
Khaula, wife of Aus bin Samit, who had been separated by her husband
on account of an old but a degrading custom whereby the husband could,
with impunity, exercise Zihar i.e. he would compare the wife to the back
of his mother and thereby succeed in denuding her of her marital status.
The consequence of this declaration was a total estrangement between the
spouses. The aggrieved women henceforth was neither a wife nor a
divorcee. Her rights were held in abeyance. Khaula, a genuinely
aggrieved spouse, injured on account of the prevailing but inhuman
custom, appeared before the Holy Prophet (p.b.u.h.) and lodged her
protest. Her legal entity was at stake. Who was she? Neither a wife nor a

divorcee. She could not withstand such a humiliating situation. In fact,

she demanded review of the custom which had the force of law. This is

probably the only instance in human history when a time-honoured
custom, having the force of law, was reviewed by Almighty Allah on the
protest of a lady. Quick came the response through the medium of
revelation. It is significant that Quran, which is a source of guidance till
eternity, preserves this particular incident of violation of human right for
the benefit of future generations. This episode brings into prominence
inter-alia the following principles:

a. There exists in the aggrieved person the unfettered right

to lodge a protest or prefer an appeal before a higher

authority with the object of seeking redressal of grievance;

b. The authority hearing the appeal is under obligation to
decide the same;

c. The arbiter is required to give due weight to violation of
human rights and human dignity;

d. The authority may, where necessary, impose a penalty
upon the violator of human rights (reference Ayat No.4 of

same Sura), and

e. Even a law can be amended/repealed on account of a
protest and

f. The right of an individual to initiate proceedings cannot
be circumscribed.

SAMEE AND BASEER

5. The reference to Divine attribute of Hearing and Seeing for well
over four score times in Holy Quran shows that the right of an aggrieved
person to lodge protest, appeal or representation against the wrong doer
before a higher tribunal i.e., a person other than the one whose order is to
be challenged has Divine sanction. The repeated reminders by Holy
Qur'an that Allah is Hearing and Seeing is, on one hand, a permission to
an injured soul to initiate proceedings and on the other hand a warning to

the adjudicator that Allah constantly watches the way matters are being

adjudicated upon. These oft-repeated attributes of Allah i.e., Seeing and
Hearing, mentioned in the Holy Quran are designed to act as guarantees.
In other words, the rights and freedoms are justiciable.
6. The Constitution as well as legal instruments in force in Pakistan,
provide ample remedies to aggrieved persons by way of appeals,
revisions, reviews. The Constitution mandates that the Supreme Court,
Federal Shariat Court and the High Courts shall have power to exercise
original and Suo Motu jurisdiction, and thereby provide relief to
aggrieved persons. The superior Judiciary has, while interpreting various
provisions of law held that right of appeal, representation, show-cause
notice is inherent in Islamic teachings. An instrument, having the force of
law, which purportedly denies the right of appeal etc. or which does not
provide for a show-cause notice will be deemed to be violative of the
Injunctions of Islam. In this behalf reference may be made to the
following precedents: -

a. Pakistan and others v. Public at Large and others PLD 1987

Supreme Court 304

b. Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of Defence v. The General
Public PLD 1989 Supreme Court 6.

c. In re: The Civil Servants Act, (LXXI of 1973) PLD 1984
Federal Shariat Court 34.

d. Messrs Sadiq Brothers v. Appellate Additional Commissioner,
Income Tax/Wealth Tax, Rawalpindi and another 2004 PTD 122.
(Appeal .... Barring a right of appeal offends against Injunctions of
Islam.

e. Dr. Muhammad Aslam Khaki and others v. Government of
Punjab and others PLD 2005 Federal Shariat Court 3

7. Islam has conferred upon human beings the freedom of expression.

Grievances have to be redressed. Any bar on this right is negation of the

Divine principle of human dignity. A portion of the famous Khutba
known as Khutba-e-Ajeeba (a wonderful sermon) and Khutba-e-Ghurra
(an eminent sermon) mentioned in Nahjul Balega as Khutba No.86,

delivered by Imam Ali R.A. the fourth Caliph, is illustrative of this point:

"He has given ears to you so that you may hear and
preserve in. mind things useful to you. He has given eyes
to you so that you may acquire such knowledge which will
bring you out of the darkness of ignorance and make you
see the light of reasoning and wisdom. He has also given to
you so many useful organs of body, each of which is
composed of many parts, their functioning depends upon
their interdependence and their symmetry; their forms and
periods of their utility, their co-ordinated action to serve
the body, their connection with a heart which is properly
fed (with blood) and nourished, in fact this perfectly
expedient body and mind are the blessings bestowed upon
you besides so many other bounties and thank-worthy
boons and protections. He then fixed a limit of life for
every one of you and has kept it a secret from you.

In the histories of the past nations and lives of individuals,
He provided opportunities for you to study the foot-prints
on the sands of time and to be warned of the consequences
of evil deeds. Lives of men, who were enjoying themselves
to their hearts' contents and had perfect freedom of action,
have such useful lessons in them to teach. Just read them
over and over again and see how quickly death overtook
them. They did not get time to satisfy their desires fully
before death put an end to their lives and placed them
beyond and further possibility of fulfillment of those
wishes."

This sermon appears to be a commentary upon the Ayat No.257 of
Sura 2, Al-Baqra which declares as follows:

"Allah is the Guardian of those who believe, He brings

them out of every darkness into light. And those who

disbelieve, their guardians are the evil ones; they bring

them out of light into all kinds of darkness. These are
destined for the Fire, and there shall they abide."

8. It has been statutorily provided that every public functionary shall

exercise the jurisdiction vested in it reasonably, fairly, justly and for the

advancement of the purposes of the enactment.

9. From the above discussion, it can safely be concluded that an early
decision on the representation/appeal of an aggrieved person is an
inherent right of every citizen and such public functionary shall not keep
the representation/appeal of an aggrieved person undecided for an
indefinite period. The authority, officer or person making any order or
issuing any direction shall provide a copy of the order to the person
affected prejudicially, and he is also supposed to give reasons in support
of the decisions, orders, especially when someone is deprived of his

vested right.

10. In view of the above, we direct respondent No.2 (Secretary Home)
to decide the fate of the representation filed by the petitioner as well as
his wife within a period of one (01) month from the date of receipt of this

order in the light of the observations made hereinabove, positively.

11. — This writ petition is disposed of in the above terms.

12. The office is directed to send the copy of this judgment to the
Chief Secretary & Administrative Secretaries of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa

Province for compliance in future.
