ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANT, J.- — This

appeal is directed against the judgment dated 14.03.2012,
rendered by learned Trial Court/ Additional Sessions
Judge-XIII, Peshawar, whereby he convicted appellant

B Cr.P.C. has been extended to him and the sentences have

been directed to run concurrently. .

2. The prosecution case is that on 26.03.2009 at
8.30 hours, when complainant Rahim Dad (PW.1)
alongwith his brother Zahir Khan deceased, was removing
mud from a thoroughfare near his house, situated in village
Khandar Khel Jarndo Kala, their neighbour Abdur Rehman
alias Malang (appellant-convict herein), came there and
opened fire at them, as a result, Zahir Khan got hit and
succumbed to the injuries on the way to hospital. An oral
altercation, prior to the incident, has been alleged as
motive of the incident.
3. The dead body of the deceased was shifted to
Police Station Mathra, where on the report of complainant
FIR No.174 dated 26.03.2009, under sections 302/324/34
PPC, was chalked out by Siraj Khan S.I (PW.3). He
prepared injury sheet and inquest report of the deceased
Exh.PW.3/2 and Exh.PW.3/3, respectively, followed by
dispatch of the dead body of the deceased to the mortuary
for postmortem examination.
4. Doctor Anwar ul Haq (PW.6), conducted
autopsy on the dead body of the deceased on 26.03.2009 at
01.15 p.m. and found the following injuries on his person:-
1. Firearm entry wound on right side of front of
chest, measuring | x 0.5 cm in size, 3 cm below

nipple and 11 cm from midline.

2. Bullet recovered from left back of chest.
Opinion:-According to his opinion, the deceased died due
to firearm injuries to his heart, right lung and vessels in the
thorax.

Probable time between injury and death has been observed
as “ Immediate” while between the death and postmortem
as “3 to 6 hours”.

5. Waris Khan Inspector (PW.2), proceeded to
the spot and prepared site plan Exh.PW.2/1 on the
pointation of Rahim Dad complainant. During spot
inspection, he vide recovery memo Exh.PW.2/2, secured
bloodstained earth from the place assigned to deceased,
took into possession two crime empties of 30 bore vide
recovery memo Exh.PW.2/3, recorded statements of
marginal witnesses to the recovery memos under section
161 Cr.P.C., took into possession the last worm
bloodstained garments of the deceased vide recovery
memo Exh.PC and sent the bloodstained articles to the
FSL. On 14.04.2009, he took into possession a spent
bullet, extracted from the dead body of the deceased during
postmortem examination by the doctor, vide recovery
memo Exh.PW.2/5, placed on file postmortem report of
the deceased and FSL report qua the bloodstained articles

Exh.PW.2/6. Since, the accused was avoiding his lawful

arrest, therefore, he initiated proceedings under sections
204 and 87 Cr.P.C. against him. On completion of
investigation complete challan in terms of $.512 Cr.P.C.
was submitted against the accused/appellant.

6. On arrest of the appellant, supplementary
challan was submitted against him before the learned Trial
Court, where he was formally charge sheeted, to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To prove its case,
prosecution examined as many as twelve witnesses. After
closure of the prosecution evidence, statement of
accused/appellant was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C.
wherein he denied the prosecution allegations and
professed his innocence. He, however, declined to be
examined on oath under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. or to
produce evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial, the
learned Trial Court after hearing both the sides, convicted
and sentenced the appellant as mentioned above, hence,
this appeal.

7. Learned counsel for the appellant argued that
learned Trial Court failed to appreciate the evidence
available on record in its true perspective, particularly, the
testimony of alleged eyewitness Rahim Dad, which suffers
from major contradictions, discrepancies and dishonest

improvements, creating serious doubt qua his presence on

the spot at the relevant time of incident; that PW Rahim
Dad is a procured witness who charged the appellant on
mere suspicions; that delay of more than two hours in
lodging report has not been explained which proves the
incident to have been reported with due deliberation and
consultation after procuring the attendance of PW Rahim
Dad; that medical evidence and site plan squarely negate
the ocular account; that the appellant has not confessed his
guilt before any competent Court of law nor any crime
weapon, either from his direct or indirect possession has
been recovered; that mere recovery of blood from the spot,
two empties of 30 bore and positive Serologist report qua
the bloodstained articles as well as abscondence of the
appellant, which otherwise, have been denied by the
appellant, being only corroborative pieces of evidence, in
absence of direct evidence, would not be sufficient to bring
home the guilt of the appellant. He submitted the
prosecution has miserably failed to bring home the guilt of
the appellant through cogent and confidence inspiring
evidence beyond shadow of reasonable doubt, therefore,
while extending benefit of doubts to the appellant he be
acquitted of the charge.

8. Conversely, learned AAG assisted by learned

counsel for the complainant contended that appellant is

directly and singularly charged for murder of the deceased
in a broad day light incident; that parties being neighbours
inter-se, question of mistaken identity does not arise; that
there exists no reason to suggest that complainant would
substitute the appellant for murder of his real brother; that
ocular account furnished by PW Rahim Dad _ is
straightforward, trustworthy and confidence inspiring,
corroborated by recovery of blood and crime empties from
the spot, autopsy report of the deceased coupled with
unexplained noticeable abscondence of the appellant. They
while supporting the impugned judgment, sought dismissal
of the appeal.

9. We have given our anxious consideration to
the respective arguments advanced from either side and
perused the record with their able assistance.

10. The incident took place on 26.03.2009 at
08.30 hours, on a thoroughfare leading to Jrando Korona,
lying at a distance of 2/3 Kilometers from Police Station
Mathra, but has been reported by Rahim Dad (PW.1) at
11.10 hours i.e. after sufficient delay of 02 hours and 40
minutes, which has not explained by him in his report.
However, complainant in order to cover up the delay, in
court statement deposed that the deceased was first shifted

to Police Station Mathra, wherefrom he was taken to

CMH, then to LRH, Peshawar and then again to Police
Station Mathra. Not a single word about the aforesaid
events has been uttered by him in his report, therefore, the
subsequent stance of the complainant, amounts to
dishonest improvements just to bring in line his case with
the time of report. In cross-examination he further deviated
from the version set forth by him in his initial report by
deposing that at the relevant time accused came and started
altercation with them over cleaning of mud from the
thoroughfare, whereafter he went, scaled over a wall of his
house and opened fired at them. What he has alleged in
report is that at the relevant time of the incident when mud
was being removed by them, appellant came there and
opened fire at them, which hit the deceased. Altercation of
the accused prior to incident, then his proceeding to the
house and scaling over the wall of his house followed by
opening of fire at the complainant party, does not find
mention in the FIR. Rahim Dad complainant further
deposed that appellant fired two shots, but in the FIR
number of the fire shots has not been mentioned. In his
report he has not stated about his taking shelter anywhere
during firing, but in cross-examination he deposed that at
the time of preparation of site plan he pointed out the place

wherefrom he ran and took shelter, however, no such place

has been shown in the site plan. As manifest from the site
plan, the crime venue is a straight street, having no house,
shop or any other place which could be utilized for taking
shelter. The distance between the deceased and
complainant has been shown as 3 paces, while between the
accused and the complainant as 05 paces, but despite such
close proximity, he did not sustain any injury. Similarly,
his let off by the accused having common motive with him
and his deceased brother, is also beyond our
understanding. Despite being a broad day light incident,
complainant has not disclosed the kind of weapon
allegedly used by the appellant in the commission of
offence. All these facts and circumstances clearly indicate
towards absence of the complainant at the time of incident.
He admits in his statement that house of Jahangir
brother-in-law of the deceased is situated at a distance of
10/20 feet from the crime venue. He further deposed that
while shifting the dead body of the deceased, his hands and
clothes were smeared with his blood, but no such clothes
have either been produced by him before the I.O. nor has
the IO. been mentioned this fact anywhere in
investigation. In the backdrop of the above discussed
peculiar facts and circumstances, shifting of dead body of

the deceased by his brother-in-law Jehangir, whose house

is situated at a distance of 10/12 paces and thereafter
procuring the attendance of the complainant within 2 hours
and 40 minutes, as suggested by the defence in
cross-examination of PW Rahim Dad, does appeal to a
prudent mind. It is settled law that an eyewitness, who
claims his presence on the spot, must satisfy mind of the
court through some strong physical circumstances or
through some corroboration in respect of his presence at
the spot, otherwise, his testimony would be of no help to
the prosecution.

11. No doubt, appellant is directly and singularly
charged for murder of the deceased and substitution of
innocent person in a case single accused is named for
murder is a rear phenomenon, but it depends from case to
case as held by the Apex Court in case titled, “Dr. Israr ul
Haq Vs Muhammad Fayyaz and another” (2007 SCMR
1427). Admittedly, conviction of an accused can be based
on the testimony of a single witness without corroboration,
but the condition is that such witness should be absolutely
dependable. We did not find Rahim Dad single witness of
this untoward incident as dependable in light of major
contradictions, discrepancies and dishonest improvements
in his testimony coupled with other peculiar facts and

circumstances of the case creating serious doubts qua his

10

presence on the spot at the relevant time of incident. In
light or ratio of judgment of the august Apex Court in case
titled, “Muhammad Saleem Vs Muhammad Azan and
another” (2011 SCMR 474), a witness making dishonest
improvements in his statement to strengthen prosecution
case, such improvements would cast serious doubt on
veracity of such witness, therefore would not be worthy of
reliance. It has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court
in case titled, “Mst. Sughra Begum and another Vs
Qaiser Pervez and others” (2015 SCMR 1142), that
ocular account in cases of qatl-i-Amd plays a decisive and
vital role and once its intrinsic worth is accepted and
believed then rest of the evidence, both circumstantial and
corroboratory in nature, would be required as a matter of
caution, but to the contrary, once the ocular account has
been disbelieved then no other evidence, even of a high
degree and value, would be sufficient for recording
conviction on a capital charge, therefore, probative value
of the ocular account had to be seen in light of the facts
and circumstances of each case.

12. Deriving wisdom from the judgment of the

august Apex Court (supra), when we have disbelieved the

ocular account, mere recovery of blood and crime empties

from the spot coupled with abscondence of the appellant

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

11

would not be sufficient to bring home the guilt of the

appellant because such pieces of evidence are always taken

into consideration alongwith the substantive evidence as

confirmatory and corroborative evidence, which in

isolation would not be sufficient for recording conviction

in a capital charge. In this regard guidance can be derived

from Riaz Ahmed’s case (2010 SCMR 846), Ijaz

Ahmed’s case (1997 SCMR 1279 and Asadullah’s case

(PLD 1971 SC 541), case titled, “Saifullah Vs the State”

(1985 SCMR 410), and case titled, “Riaz Masih Vs the

State” 1995 SCMR 1730 as well as Mst. Sughra Begum

and other’s case (2015 SCMR 1142). Similar is the

position of abscondence, which cannot be a substitute of

real evidence. Abscondence by itself would be of no avail

to prosecution in absence of any other evidence against the

absconding accused.

13. For what has been discussed above, the
learned Trial Court failed to appreciate the evidence
available on record in its true perspective in light of the

principles laid down by the superior Courts and thus

12

reached to erroneous conclusion by holding the appellant
guilty of the offence. Accordingly, we by allowing this
appeal, set aside the conviction and sentences of the
appellant recorded vide impugned judgment dated
14.03.2012, and hereby acquit him of the charge levelled
against him. He be set at liberty forthwith, if not required

in any other case.

14. These are reasons of our short order of even
date.
Announced
14.10.2015.
