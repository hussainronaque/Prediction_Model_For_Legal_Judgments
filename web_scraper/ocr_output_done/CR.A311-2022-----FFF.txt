2. Facts of the prosecution case are that on
16.01.2018 complainant Ijaz Ahmad s/o Anwar
Shah and his brother Sajjad Anwar in injured
condition brought the dead body of their brother
Zia-ur-Rahman to Casualty of DHQ, Hospital
Mardan with the help of other persons in RESCUE
1122 Ambulance and at 20:20 hours the
complainant Ijaz Ahmad reported the matter to the
police to the effect that on the evening of
16.01.2018 he alongwith his brothers namely Zia-
ur-Rahman, the deceased, and Sajjad were present
in their grocery shop; that at 19:35 hours accused
Abidullah duly armed with pistol, Abdullah and

Amanullah duly armed with axes while Akhtar Ali
4

and Shaukat Ali having sticks came to their shop;
that accused Abidullah made firing at his brother
Zia-ur-Rahman with his pistol, resultantly who got
hit and died on the spot while accused Abdullah
and Amanullah gave axe blows to Sajjad Anwar
and accused Akhtar Ali and Shaukat Ali started
beating him with sticks and resultantly he and his
brother Sajjad Anwar sustained bodily injuries. The
motive was stated to be altercation / quarrel taken
place on fuel wood prior to the occurrence between
the appellants and brother of the complainant
namely Shah Fahad. Besides the complainant, the
occurrence was also witnessed by Sajjad Anwar,
brother of complainant, and other people. Report of
the complainant was reduced into writing in the
shape of murasila and consequently the instant case

FIR was registered against the accused.
5

3. After completion of investigation, complete /
supplementary challans were submitted against the
appellants before the competent Court. Formal
charge against them was framed, to which they did
not plead guilty and claimed trial.

4. The prosecution in support of its case,
examined as many as fifteen (15) witnesses. On
conclusion of trial statements of accused-appellants
under section-342 Cr. PC were recorded, wherein
they professed innocence and false implication.
They neither wished to record their statements
within the meaning of section-340(2) Cr. PC nor
opted to produce evidence in defence. After hearing
arguments of learned counsels for the parties, the
learned trial Court vide impugned judgment dated
30.03.2022 convicted and sentenced the appellants
per details mentioned in the opening paragraph of

the judgment. The appellants impugned the
6

judgment of the trial Court before this Court by
filing the afore cited Cr. Appeals while the
complainant Ijaz Ahad also filed Criminal Revision
No.67-P of 2022 for enhancement of sentences
daman awarded to the appellants-respondents.

5. We have heard arguments of the learned
counsel for the appellants, learned A.A.G, for the
State and learned counsel for the complainant party
and gone through the evidence with their valuable

assistance.

First we have to decide the Criminal Appeal
No.311-P/2022_ filed by __convict-appellant
Abidullah, who is charged for the murder of

deceased Zia-ur-Rahman.
6. The complainant Ijaz Ahmad in his initial
report i.e murasila (EX PA/1) as well as in his
Court statement recorded as (PW-13) and injured
eyewitness namely Sajjad Anwar (PW-14) have
charged the appellant Abidullah for effective firing
with his 30 bore pistol at the deceased

Zia-ur-Rahman. Both of them in their respective
7

statements have stated that on the fateful evening
they alongwith their deceased brother Zia-ur-
Rehman were present in their grocery shop in the
meantime at 19:35 hours all the convicts-appellants
came to the place of occurrence duly armed with
_ pistol, axe and sticks. The occurrence had taken
place in front of the shop of complainant party.
Presence of complainant Ijaz Ahmad, his brother
Sajjad Anwar alongwith deceased Zia-ur-Rahman
are natural and normally at evening time people do
assemble at the shops, coupled with the fact that
their house situates at the distance of 200 paces
from the shop as stated by complainant in his cross
examination. The complainant Ijaz Ahmad (PW-
13) and injured eyewitness Sajjad Anwar (PW-14)
have attributed the effective role of firing at the
deceased to convict-appellant Abidullah with his 30

bore pistol. During spot inspection, Yousaf Khan
8

ASI Investigating Officer (PW-15) recovered two
empties of 30 bore from point-A and took into
possession the same vide recovery memo (EX PW
8/1) and vide recovery memo (EX PW 8/6) also
took into possession one 25 watt energy saver bulb
from point-B which was lit in front of the shop of
complainant party at the height of 10 feet at the
time of occurrence. The report was promptly
lodged by the complainant in injured condition in
the Casualty of DHQ Hospital, Mardan, at 20:20
hours i.e after 45 minutes of the occurrence which
was consumed in calling of RESCUE and reaching
of the Ambulance to the spot and other
arrangements for shifting the dead body of the
deceased as well as the injured persons, so the
question of consultation and deliberation does not
arise. Sardar Bacha son of Arsala Khan (PW-08),

who is marginal witness to various recovery
9

memos, deposed that vide recovery memo (EX PW
8/1) the I.O took into possession blood through
cotton from the place of deceased Zia-ur-Rahman
and sealed in parcel No.1 ExP-1, vide recovery
memo (EX PW 8/2) two empties of 30 bore were
recovered and taken into possession by the I.0 and
sealed the same in parcel No.2 Ex  P-2,
bloodstained clothes of deceased vide recovery
memo (EX PW 8/3) sealed in parcel No.3 ExP-3,
and vide recovery memo (EX PW 8/6) the I.O took
into possession one 25 watt energy saver bulb,
which was lit at the time of occurrence, sealed the
same in parcel No.7 Ex P-7. In addition to the
above, the spot of occurrence is situated on main
road, where besides the shop of complainant, there
are so many shops and residential houses and the
bulbs installed in front of the shops and street lights

available on the road could not be ruled out while
10

in front of the spot a Filling Station, known as
Liaqat Filling Station, which remains open around
‘the clock, has also been shown, where a number of
bulbs are installed and were lit at the time of
occurrence which suffice that there was sufficient
light on the spot of occurrence and rules out
question of non-identification of the accused by the
complainant and eye witnesses at the time of
occurrence during dark hours of the eventful day.
Furthermore, complainant party and accused are
co-villagers, as avowed by PW-14 in his cross
examination that accused are well known to them
being co-villagers, thus the question of mis-
identification is also not sustainable.

7. More so, Dr. Shah Zeb M.O posted at DHQ
Hospital, Mardan, (PW-4) conducted autopsy on
the dead body of deceased Zia-ur-Rahman son of

Anwar Shah and found one firearm entry wound at
11

mid of sternum at the level of 3 rib about 1cm in
diameter having exit wound at the medial aspect of
right scapula about 1-1/2cm in diameter and
according to his opinion the cause of death was
injury to vital organs i.e heart, lung and blood
vessels.

8. Two empties of 30 bore pistol, recovered
from the spot, were sent for forensic analysis,
according to FSL report the same did not match
with the pistol allegedly produced by the brother of
accused Abid Ullah. Learned trial Court has rightly
held that FSL report, in nature, is only
corroborative and confirmatory or explanatory to
the ocular or direct account of evidence. It is
undeniable that when prosecution has proved its
case through ocular account mere FSL report, being
negative, would not be fatal to the case of

prosecution. Because neither conviction nor
12

acquittal could be based solely on the basis on
opinion of Ballistic Expert, in this regard we are
fortified by Hon’ble apex Court judgment in
Yaqoob Shah’s case (PLD 1976 SC 53) wherein
it has been held that evidence of a Medical or
Ballistic expert is confirmatory in nature which is
not of much significance in presence of direct,
definite, forthright and creditworthy evidence, and
such report/ evidence cannot outweight direct
evidence not deficient in quality. Here, in instant
matter, Case of the prosecution mainly rest on
direct and substantive evidence of complainant and
injured eye witness, who witnessed the occurrence
and narrated the same in confidence inspiring
manner and despite of lengthy cross examination,
nothing has been elicited from the mouth of
complainant and Sajjad Anwar, the injured

eyewitness, which could favour the accused-
13

appellant Abidullah. The motive advanced by the
prosecution in the FIR, both the injured
eyewitnesses have supported the same, which
further corroborates the prosecution version.

9. For the foregoing reasons, without any
slightest doubt in our mind to hold that the
impugned judgment to the extent of convict-
appellant Abidullah is well reasoned and based on
proper appraisal of evidence, therefore, his
conviction and sentence under section-302(b) PPC
is maintained and as such Cr. Appeal No.311-
P/2022 filed by appellant Abidullah is dismissed.
Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C has already been

extended to the appellant by the learned trial Court.

Now coming to Criminal Appeals No.302 &
308-P/2022 filed by appellants namel,

Akhtar Ali son of Sabz Ali, Shaukat Ali son
of Akhtar Ali, Abdullah & Amanullah sons
of Ehsanullah respectively against their

conviction and sentences.
14

10. The complainant (PW-13) and eyewitness
Sajjad Anwar (PW-14) in their respective
statements have attributed the role of inflicting axe
blows to Sajjad Anwar by convict-appellants
namely Abdullah and Amanullah while convict-
appellants namely Akhtar Ali and Shaukat Ali have
been attributed the role of beating complainant Ijaz
Ahmad with sticks. Both the injured named above
were examined by Dr. Shah Zeb (PW-4) and the
injuries on the person of complainant Ijaz Ahmad
were opined to be of small size i.e three abrasions
on right hand posterior aspect while the injury on
the person of injured Sajjad was found to be a
lacerated wound at 2/3 posterior of forearm,
however, according to the final report furnished by
Radiologist, there is no bone fracture and that the
wound was labeled as Ghair Jaiffa. Injured-

complainant Ijaz Ahmad sustained small size
15

abrasions for which appellants Akhtar and Shaukat
Ali are charged, while injured Sajjad Anwar
sustained a lacerated wound and for the same
appellants Abdullah and Amanullah are charged
with no specific role. Perusal of the record
transpires that none of the above accused have been
allotted with a specific role as to which injury
resulted due to the blow(s) inflicted by which one
of the accused/appellants. To be more specific,
Sajjad Anwar sustained only one injury for which
appellants Abdullah and Amanullah both have been
charged. Similarly for three small abrasions
sustained by complaiant Ijaz Ahmad two persons
have been charged without specification that which
of the injuries or blow has been inflicted by which
one of the both accused/appellants. This fact give
rise to a reasonable doubt in mind, benefit of

which, being a settled principle by now, should be
16

accused as a matter of right and not as a grace. It is
theme of the dispensation of criminal justice that
for conviction of accused, prosecution is to prove
guilt to fit all the four corners because conviction
could be held in vacuum. Moreover, the injuries
sustained by the injured Ijaz Ahmad and Sajjad
Anwar are simple in nature. therefore, by extending
benefit of doubt, the above cited appeals are
allowed, the appellants are acquitted of the charges
leveled against them under sections 337-F(i)/337-F
(ii) PPC. They are on bail and their sureties are
absolved from the liability of bail bonds furnished
by them for their release on bail.

11. On the other hand, prosecution has
successfully proved its case against the
convict/appellant Abidullah through _ straight
forward and confidence inspiring the testimony of

injured witnesses. It is noteworthy to be highlighted
17

here that factors favouring the convict-appellants
Akhtar Ali, Shaukat Ali, Abdullah and Amanullah
will not benefit the convict/appellant Abidullah.
Their acquittal, by extending benefit of doubt for
safe administration of justice, would not create any
suspicion in establishing their presence of the
injured eyewitnesses on the spot at the relevant
time and their credibility has not been shattered,
however, the injuries sustained by them have been
opined by the doctor as abrasions and lacerated and
as such are simple in nature, which have not been
specifically attributed to any of the appellants. At
times, Courts, in plethora of cases, have been
inclined to extend benefit of doubt to some of
accused by acquitting them as an abundant caution,
while on the same set of evidence have recorded
conviction of co-accused. Learned Trial Court has

rightly convicted and sentenced the appellant
18

Abidullah on the basis of specific role attributed to
him by complainant and eye witnesses. The
acquittal of appellants namely Akhtar Ali, Shaukat
Ali, Abdullah and Amanullah will not entitle the
appellant namely Abidullah to outright acquittal.

12. It is also pertinent to mention here that
appellants Abidullah, Akhtar Ali, Shaukat Ali,
Abdullah and Amanullah have also been convicted
by the learned trial Court under sections-148/149
PPC being member of unlawful assembly and
sharing their common object. It is a matter of
record that first grappling took place between the
parties over a trivial matter and thereafter the
occurrence had taken place, so the question of their
being member of unlawful assembly and sharing
common object is open to serious doubt, therefore,
the appellants could not be held liable u/s-148/149

PPC for sharing of their common object, hence,

19

they are acquitted from the charge uw/s-148/149

PPC.

13. Record reveals that the occurrence taken
place without premeditation, therefore, the learned
trial Court has rightly awarded life imprisonment to
the appellant Abidullah by considering the overall
facts of the case, therefore the sentences awarded to
the convict-appellant Abidullah by the trial Court in
the circumstances of the case is appropriate while
rest of the convict-appellants namely Akhtar Ali,
Shaukat Ali, Abdullah and Amanullah have been
acquitted. Hence, the Criminal Revision No. 67-
P/2022 for enhancement of sentences and amount
of Daman awarded to the appellants, stands
dismissed.
