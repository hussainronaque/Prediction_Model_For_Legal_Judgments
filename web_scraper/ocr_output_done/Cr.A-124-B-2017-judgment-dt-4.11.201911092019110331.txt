SAHIBZADA_ ASADULLAH, J.---This single judgment
is aimed to dispose of the instant Criminal Appeal as well as
the connected Criminal Revision No. 30-B/2017
(Muhammad Janbaz Khan Vs Bad Shah Jamil etc), as both

these have arisen out of one and the same judgment.

2- Appellant Bad Shah Jamil, being aggrieved by
judgment dated 25.5.2017 of the learned Sessions Judge,
Karak in Sessions Case No. 11/7 of 2017, by which the

appellant was convicted U/S.302 (b) /34 PPC, and sentenced

*Imranullah* (D.B)} Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
to rigorous imprisonment for life as Ta’zir. He was also
liable to pay compensation of Rs.5,00,000/-(Five Lacs),
U/S.544-A(i) Cr.P.C, if realized be paid to the legal heirs of
the deceased and in default six months SI, however, the
accused was given benefit U/S. 382-B Cr.P.C. whereas was
though acquitted from the charges U/S- 324/34 PPC. Hence,
has preferred this appeal against his conviction and sentence,
while the connected Criminal Revision No.30-B/2017 was
preferred by the complainant Muhammad Jan Baz, for

enhancement of sentence.

3- Brief facts given in the FIR (Ex.PW-10/1) are
that on 25.9.1996 at 11:00 hours, Muhammad Jan Baz
Khan/complainant (PW-10) brought the dead body of his
deceased cousin Ameer Faraz to the police station where he
reported the matter to the effect that on the eventful day, he
along with the deceased had gone to the shop of Nasib Khan,
when came out of the shop at about 11:30 hours, the appellant
armed with Kalashnikov emerged, raised “Lalkara” and fired
which resulted into the death of the deceased. The

complainant ran after the accused to overpower him, but he

*Imranullah* (D.B} Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
was fired at by the co-accused Zafar Iqbal and Rasool
Badshah who luckily escaped unhurt. Motive shown was

family honour.

4- It is pertinent to mention here that the co-
accused were earlier arrested and after facing trial were
acquitted whereas the appellant was declared proclaimed
offender. The appellant was arrested on 12.3.2015 and faced
the trial and vide judgment dated 28.7.2016 was convicted
U/S. 302 (b) PPC for murder of deceased Ameer Faraz and
was sentenced to death. Feeling aggrieved of the judgment of
the appellant by then filed Cr.A No. 323-B/2016 before the
Peshawar High Court Bannu Bench, which was allowed vide
judgment dated 14.02.2017 and the case was remanded to the
trial court to make efforts to procure the attendance of some
of the witnesses failing which their already recorded
statements should be transposed U/S. 512 Cr.P.C after
observing the codal formalities and thereafter to record
statement of accused U/S. 342 Cr.P.C with fresh decision on

merit.

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
5- After remand the trial court on 27.3.2017
recorded the statement of Dr.Abdul Samad (PW-12) the then
Medical Officer posted at Rural Health Center, Sabir Abad,
who had conducted autopsy on the dead body of the deceased
Ameer Faraz Khan and had also endorsed the injury sheet and
inquest report which are exhibited as Ex.PM, Ex.PM/1 and

Ex.PM/2, respectively.

6- One Awal Khan SHO now retired though
appeared before the court, but was incapable of recording
statement being of extreme old age, so Dr. Abdus Samad
(PW-12) who was in attendance as his statement was to be
recorded, so the trial court requested his opinion as to whether
this witness was capable to understand the proceedings, he
replied in negative. After observing the legal formalities, his
earlier recorded statement was transposed with his status as
PW-7. This PW had taken into possession the blood-stained
garments of the deceased brought by constable Gul Pari Jan
and sealed the same into parcel vide memo Ex.PW-3/1,
arrested the acquitted co-accused Rasool Badshah and Zafar

Iqbal, issued their cards of arrest and vide application Ex.PW-

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
7/1 he obtained warrants against all the accused and
proclamation notices vide his application Ex.PW-7/2,
recorded statements of the marginal. witnesses, placed report
of FSL Ex.PK on file and submitted challan U/S. 512 Cr.P.C.
This PW in his earlier recorded statement also verified the

signatures of PW-Mashal Din ASI now deceased.

7- One Khalid Usman DSP (PW-13) while present
in court in some other case also came forward and stated that
he being fully conversant with the hand-writing and signature
of deceased Mashal Din ASI, got recorded his statement and
stated that he remained posted with deceased Mashal Din ASI
on several occasions during his service, thus, was fully
conversant with his hand writing and signature, he also
verified FIR Ex.PW-10/1, site-plan Ex.PB, recovery memos
Ex.PW-6/2 to Ex.PW-6/4, injury sheet Ex.PM/1, inquest
report Ex.PM/2, to be in the hand-writing of deceased Mashal

Din ASI and confirmed his signatures on the said documents.

8- The prosecution closed its evidence and the
accused recorded his statement U/S. 342 Cr.P.C, but did not

opt to be examined on Oath nor opted to produce defence.

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr, Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
9- The trial court after hearing the parties

convicted the appellant vide the impugned judgment dated

25.5.2017.

10- The learned counsels for the parties were heard

and with their valuable assistance the record was read from

cover to cover.

11- The prosecution story unfolded in the FIR is
that the complainant accompanied the deceased to the shop
of one Naseeb Khan to purchase snuff and cigarette and after
purchase the deceased followed him from the shop, while he
had hardly walked 10 paces that he heard fire shots and found
the appellant/accused duly armed with Kalashnikov firing
upon the deceased. Though both, the complainant and the
deceased had come with common purpose and left the shop
together, if this was so then instead going ahead 15 paces they
would have been together in front of the shop at the time of
firing. The complainant stated in his court statement that the
firing was indiscriminate and the accused exhausted the

magazine, if so then the complainant too would have received

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
fire arm injuries. The presence of the complainant on the spot
is not free from doubt, the purpose of their presence was to
purchase snuff and cigarettes from the shop of one Naseeb
Khan, neither the cigarettes nor the snuff were produced to
the investigating officer, so much so no attempt was made to
record the statement of the shop-keeper to confirm the
purpose of their presence and to convince us of their presence
at the place of occurrence. There was a deliberate attempt on
part of the complainant to justify his presence on the spot, we
failed to understand that why the complainant gave two
contradictory statements regarding presence of the deceased,
i.e, during spot pointation a specific point has been given to
the deceased adjacent to the door of the shop while sitting
whereas in his court statement he went on to say that the
deceased was coming after him. This PW in his court
statement admitted that all the shop-keepers came out and
witnessed the occurrence, but non came forward to confirm
the time and manner of the occurrence. In case titled Abid Ali

and two others Vs. The State (2011 SCMR 208), it was held:-

"We have thoroughly discussed the

statements of two eye-witnesses claiming to be present at

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
the scene of crime but they on their own admissions were
chance witnesses and have admitted their enmity with
the appellant. Both these witnesses could not reasonably
explain their presence with the deceased Muhammad
Azam rather their conduct runs against the natural
behavior of normal human, therefore, their testimonies
appears to be unbelievable in the circumstances of the

case."

12- The appellant/accused is shown at Point No-5
and the deceased at Point No.1, that too according to site-plan
being prepared by the complainant, in sitting position, then
the seat of injuries on the person of the deceased did not
support the stance of the complainant and there is an open
conflict between the medical evidence and ocular account; if
in fact the stances so taken are placed in juxta position then
we are afraid the medical evidence does not support the case
of the prosecution, if the deceased was sitting then his left
was exposed to the assailant, and in that situation the entry
wounds which found its exit on the left side of his body is
against the medical evidence and so was the case, while
walking with his back exposed to the assailant. Janbaz Khan
PW-10 stated that the appellant/accused resorted to

indiscriminate firing, if so, then we are anxious to know that

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
why no more empties were recovered as admittedly, only
three empties of 7.62 bore were recovered from the spot and
even no bullet marks on the surrounding walls were noticed,
as it is a matter of experience that a magazine of a
Kalashnikov accommodates cartridges maximum to seventy
five. The witness stated that it was a burst fire then instead of
three entry wounds the body of the deceased would have been
bullets riddled. The accused was positioned at Point No.5,
whereas the empties were recovered from Point-A at a
considerable distance that too towards left of the accused
which speaks nothing, but malafide on part of the
complainant and it strengthens the stance taken by the defence
that the complainant was not present at the time when the
deceased was done to death. The motive alleged was that of
family honour and the prosecution witnesses admitted of
being from one family with a common motive then why only
the deceased was targeted and rest of the witnesses, if present
on the spot, were spared, it gives no other inference, but to
hold that the witnesses are chance and interested witnesses

and the courts are to be careful while awarding sentence on

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
10

the testimony of such like witnesses and strong corroboration
is always needed. In case titled Muhammad Akram Vs. The

State (2009 SCMR 230), it was held that:-

"It is an axiomatic principle of law that in
case of doubt, the benefit thereof must accrue in favour

of the accused as a matter of right and not of grace. "

13- That the investigating officer when came to the
spot in order to effect recoveries and to prepare the site-plan,
the complainant accompanied him and on his pointation the
site-plan was prepared. The complainant pointed out Point-B
as the place when after firing the accused/appellant was
chased and the complainant when reached this point the co-
accused namely-Zafar Iqbal and Rasool Badshah started firing
at him, so he gave up the chase and came back towards the
deceased. The investigating officer kept silence that where the
appellant was present when chased by the complainant and
when the complainant reached to Point-B. This explanation
by the complainant finds no favour with us as the complainant
was empty handed and he could not run the risk to go after the
accused/appellant being armed with a Kalashnikov. This

factor is again disturbing that why the other two accused

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
ll

came there and only resorted to ineffective firing, had they
been there with the intention to kill then the result would have

been other-wise.

14- The complainant stated in his report that the
occurrence was also witnessed by PW- Muhammad Nisar and
Muhammad Saeed, who were the first cousins of the deceased.
When Muhammad Saeed was examined as PW-11, he stated
that at the time of occurrence, he along with Muhammad
Nisar was digging the soil and they saw the accused while
firing at the deceased, the distance between the deceased and
this PW has stated to be 93/96 paces which comes out to be
some 260 feet and in such a long distance this is humanly
impossible to recognize/identify a person with a weapon in
his hand. Neither the investigating officer collected the
instruments which they used for digging the soil nor the dug
earth was shown in the site-plan. Their presence at the time of
occurrence is not established on record, but being closely
related they were lateron procured to charge the
appellant/accused for commission of the offence. The

witnesses went in glaring contradictions and they suffered

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
12

with dishonest improvements with the only purpose to bring
their statement in line with the prosecution case. The motive
was not only against the deceased, but all the witnesses
admitted that they belong to one and the same family and the
motive was common to all of them, if so, then why they were
spared despite the fact that three assailants were there with
deadly weapons. In case titled Abdul Jabbar alias Jabbari Vs

The State (2017 SMCR 1155), it was held that:-

"Eye-witnesses claimed to have seen the
occurrence from a distance of about 111-1/2 feet and still
they claimed to have witnessed every detail of the incident
including the different weapons being used by the accused
party, which was a claim which could not be easily

accepted,"

15- The deceased was fired at, at 09:30 AM
whereas the matter was reported to the local police of police
station Sabir Abad at 11:00 AM, and the distance between the
spot and the police station is about 5/6 kilometers. The
prosecution miserably failed to explain that how this
abnormal delay in reporting the matter occasioned. None of
the two witnesses, i.e, the complainant and eye-witness were

the witnesses of identification before the police at the time of

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
13

preparation of the inquest report and also during the
postmortem before the doctor in the hospital. Had the
witnesses been present then they would have surely identified
the deceased at both these places, but in fact they were
procured and after consultation and deliberations the appellant
with the other accused were charged after preliminary
investigation. In case titled State through Advocate- General,

N.W.F.P., Peshawar Vs Shah Jahan (PLD 2003 SC 70):-

“It was held that the delay in lodging the F.LR.
has not been explained plausibly, which shows that it was
lodged after preliminary inquiry/investigation, deliberation

and consultation....)

16- We went deeply into merits of the case and read
the record thoroughly with assistance of the learned counsels.
The over-all impression of both, the documentary evidence as
well as the ocular account produced, led us to conclude that in
fact the witnesses were not present at the time and at the place
of occurrence. The prosecution did not make efforts to
associate any one of the shop-keepers especially Nasib Khan
from whose shop the witness and the deceased allegedly

purchased cigarettes and snuff and also the purchased items

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
14

were not taken into possession by the investigating officer.
Out of the identifiers who identified the dead body before the
doctor and the police, one Zakir was produced and in fact this
was the witness who was earlier produced as a prosecution
witness when the co-accused were facing trial before the court
and this witness went ahead of what he spoke before the trial
court when the co-accused were facing trial, this witness
stated therein that after the occurrence the dead body was
shifted to his house and from the house the deceased was
taken to the police station where the report was made and Post
Mortem was conducted. The appellant while recording his
statement U/S. 342 Cr.P.C, also explained the conduct of this
witness in the previous trial and the present one. If that aspect
is taken into consideration it further belies the presence of the
complainant and other witnesses on the spot and the veracity

of the prosecution case is further diminished.

17- The learned counsel for the prosecution
vehemently argued that the accused /appellant remained
absconder for sufficient long time, we agree with the
submission so put before us but we are to see as to

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
15

whether the prosecution could prove its case through
confidence inspiring evidence, if so, then abscondence
can be taken into consideration, but it cannot be denied
that sometimes the accused absconds because of fear of
the police. The prosecution case suffered a lot when the
empties collected from the spot were not sent to the
Forensic Sciences Laboratory with the request as to
whether these empties especially, the three recovered
from Point-A were fired from one or different weapons.
The accused was arrested, but at the time of arrest nothing
incriminating was recovered from his possession so much

so the weapon of offence.

18- The prosecution has alleged motive that too a
dispute over women-folk/family honour, but no efforts were
made either by the investigating officer or the complainant to
bring something concrete on record to connect the appellant
with the offence in hand. No independent witness came
forward to support and explain that what kind of dispute

between the parties was, which led the appellant to commit

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
16

the murder of the deceased. The motive so alleged cannot be
believed because if all were connected then why only the
deceased was done to death and rest of the witnesses were left

unhurt.

19- Be that as it may, the prosecution failed to

convince this court that it was non-else but accused who

killed the deceased.

20- After thoroughly evaluating the evidence
available on file this court reaches to an inescapable
conclusion that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove
its case against accused/appellant. Resultantly, this appeal is,
therefore, allowed, the conviction and sentence of the
appellant recorded by the learned trial court is set-aside and
he is acquitted of the charge by extending him the benefit of
doubt, he shall be released forth with from jail, if not required
to be detained in connection with any other case. So far as the
connected Criminal Revision No.  30-B/2017
(Muhammad Jan Baz Khan V Bad Shah Jameel etc) is

concerned, the same stands dismissed.

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asaduilah

21- These are the detailed reasons for my short

order of the even date.
