Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan, J:- This judgment shall
dispose of Criminal Appeal No.2227 of 2014, filed by Syed

Laila (co-accused since acquitted) was tried in case FIR.
No.1130/2010 dated 16.12.2010, registered at police station
Ferozewala District Sheikhupura in respect of offences under
sections 302/148/149 PPC. After conclusion of the trial, the
learned trial Court vide its judgment dated 28.11.2014, has

convicted and sentenced the appellant as under: -

Under section 302(b) PPC to imprisonment for
life. The appellant was also directed to pay an
amount of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees two hundred
thousand only), as compensation to the legal heirs
of Kamran Haider (deceased) under section 544-A
Cr.P.C and in case of default to further undergo
six months simple imprisonment.

Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C was also extended
to the appellant.

However, vide the same impugned judgment Muhammad Saleem
alias Kali Gujjar, Syed Raza Shah and Mst. Umm-i-Naila alias
Laila (co-accused) were acquitted by the learned trial Court while

extending them the benefit of doubt.

3. Brief facts of the case as given by the complainant Imran
Haider (PW-7) in the FIR (Ex.PG/1) are that on 16.12.2010, at
about 9.00 a.m, his brother namely Kamran Haider (deceased)
received a call on his mobile phone. On the query of the
complainant, Kamran Haider (deceased) told that Mst. Umm-i-
Naila alias Laila (co-accused since acquitted) had called him for
meeting. The complainant suspected something wrong, therefore,
he (complainant) along with his younger brother Farhan Haider
followed Kamran Haider (deceased) on their motorcycle. Kamran
Haider (deceased) proceeded towards Gujranwala on G.T. road on
his motorcycle Honda-CG-125 (black colour) bearing registration
No.LEV-09/ 4030 and when he reached on G.T. Road Total Petrol
Pump near Rice Farm, Kala Shah Kaku, Saqlain Shah (appellant),
Kali Gujjar (co-accused since acquitted), Mst. Umm-i-Naila alias

Laila (co-accused since acquitted), Raza Ali Shah (co-accused since
Crl. Appeal No.2227 of 2014 3
Cri. Revision No.24 of 2015

acquitted) and Riaz Shah (co-accused since P.O), along with one
unknown accused person emerged at the spot and intercepted him.
Saqlain Shah (appellant) and Muhammad Saleem alias Kali Gujjar
(co-accused since acquitted) thereafter, made indiscriminate firing
with their respective pistols at Kamran Haider (deceased), which
landed on the different parts of his body, who after sustaining
serious injuries fell down on the ground. Upon seeing the whole
occurrence, the complainant along with Farhan Haider (PW)
stepped forward on which, the accused persons while making firing
and raising ‘Lalkaras’ fled away from the spot while saying that
they had taken the revenge of their insult. The occurrence was also
witnessed by Abdul Rehman (given up PW), Durrab Hussain
(PW.8) and Ahmad Subhani (given up PW). Kamran Haider
succumbed to the injuries at the spot, hence the abovementioned

FIR.

The motive behind the occurrence was that Umm-i-Naila
alias Laila (co-accused since acquitted) wanted to marry with
Kamran Haider (deceased) and family members of said co-accused
also visited the complainant’s house for 2/3 times for the said
purpose but the complainant’s family members did not agree with
the proposal. The complainant’s family got contracted marriage of
Kamran Haider deceased at some other place and due to the said
grudge, the accused persons, in furtherance of their common object,

committed the murder of Kamran Haider (deceased).

4. The appellant was arrested in this case by the police and after
completion of investigation the challan was prepared and submitted
before the learned trial court. The learned trial Court, after
observing legal formalities, as provided under the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898 framed charge against the appellant and his co-
accused on 26.10.2011 to which they pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. In order to prove its case the prosecution produced ten
witnesses. Aftab Ahmad, DSP and Abdul Aziz, 982/C were
examined as Court witnesses (CW.1 and CW.2, respectively).

Prosecution also produced documentary evidence in the shape of
Cri. Appeal No.2227 of 2014 4
Cri. Revision No.24 of 2015

Ex.PA to Ex.PT during the trial. The statements of the appellant
and his co-accused under section 342 Cr.P.C were recorded,
wherein they refuted the allegations levelled against them and

professed their innocence.

5. The learned trial Court vide the impugned judgment dated
28.11.2014, found the appellant guilty, convicted and sentenced

him as mentioned and detailed above.

6. It is contended by learned counsel for the appellant that the
appellant is absolutely innocent and he has wrongly been convicted
and sentenced by the learned trial Court; that both the eye-witnesses
of the prosecution are chance witnesses because their houses were
situated at the distances of 10/15-KMs and 20/25-KMs from the
place of occurrence; that the prosecution eye-witnesses could not
justify their presence at the spot at the relevant time through any
cogent reason, therefore, their evidence is not worthy of reliance;
that there is a delay of 24-hours in conducting postmortem
examination of Kamran Haider (deceased) which also shows that
the prosecution witnesses were not present at the spot at the time of
occurrence; that the motive alleged against the appellant has also
not been proved in this case by the prosecution and the same has
rightly been disbelieved by the learned trial Court; that the recovery
of weapon of offence and positive report of the Punjab Forensic
Science Agency, Lahore (Ex.PT) is of no avail to the complainant
party because the empties and pistol were deposited together in the
office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore; that the witness,
namely, Shahzada Qeqous (837/C) who deposited the pistol and
empties in the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore,
did not appear in the witness box; that the appellant and
Muhammad Saleem alias Kali Gujjar, co-accused were attributed a
joint role of firing at the deceased but the said Muhammad Saleem
alias Kali Gujjar, co-accused has been acquitted by the learned trial
Court and criminal appeal filed against his acquittal i.e. Crl. Appeal
No.39 of 2015, has also been dismissed by this Court vide order

dated 20.11.2019, therefore, the prosecution evidence which has
Cri. Appeal No.2227 of 2014 5
Cri. Revision No.24 of 2015

been disbelieved against the above mentioned co-accused, cannot
be believed against the appellant without independent
corroboration, which is very much lacking in this case; that the
prosecution miserably failed to prove its case against the appellant
beyond the shadow of doubt, therefore, this appeal may be accepted

and the appellant may be acquitted from the charge.

7. On the other hand, it is argued by the learned Additional
Prosecutor General for the State assisted by learned counsel for the
complainant that the prosecution has proved its case against the
appellant beyond the shadow of any doubt, therefore, he was rightly
convicted and sentenced by the learned trial Court; that the
prosecution eye-witnesses were cross-examined at length but their
evidence could not be shaken; that the occurrence in this case took
place in the broad daylight and as such there was no chance of any
misidentification of the appellant; that the appellant alongwith
Muhammad Saleem alias Kali Gujjar, co-accused was given
specific role of making fire shots at Kamran Haider, deceased and
the said role is fully supported by the medical evidence; that the
prosecution case against the appellant has further been corroborated
by the recovery of pistol (P-5) from the possession of the appellant
and the positive report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore
(Ex.PT); that motive against the appellant has also been proved by
the trustworthy and reliable prosecution evidence and the same was
wrongly disbelieved by the learned trial Court; that the acquittal of
Muhammad Saleem alias Kali Gujjar, co-accused is of no avail to
the appellant because the said co-accused was declared innocent by
the police and nothing incriminating was recovered from his
possession whereas the appellant was found guilty by the police and
pistol (P-5) has also been recovered from his possession and as such
his case is distinguishable from the case of Muhammad Saleem
alias Kali Gujjar, co-accused (since acquitted), therefore, his
criminal appeal may be dismissed. While arguing Criminal
Revision No.24 of 2015 for enhancement of sentence of Syed

Saqlain Shah (convict), it is argued by learned counsel for the
Crl. Appeal No.2227 of 2014 6
Cri. Revision No.24 of 2015

complainant that there was no mitigating circumstance in this case,
therefore, Syed Saqlain Shah may be awarded the normal penalty of
death.

8. Arguments heard and record perused.

9. The detail of the prosecution case as set forth in the FIR
(Ex.PG/1) and in the complaint (Ex.PG), has already been given in
paragraph No.3 of this judgment, therefore, there is no need to

repeat the same.

10. In order to prove its ocular account, the prosecution has
produced in the witness box Imran Haider, complainant (PW.7) and
Durrab Hussain (PW.8). The occurrence in this case took place near
Total Petrol Pump situated at G.T. Road Kala Shah Kaku. Both the
above mentioned eye-witnesses are not residents of the place of
occurrence. Imran Haider, complainant (PW.7) has stated duriung
his cross-examination that Durrab Hussain (PW.8) is resident of
Wandala Dayal Shah Ferozewala which was situated at a distance
of 20/25-KMs from the place of occurrence. He further stated that
he himself was resident of Ferozewala and distance between
Ferozewala and the place of occurrence was about 15-KMs. In
order to justify his presence at the spot at the relevant time, Imran
Haider, complainant (PW.7) stated that on the day of occurrence,
Kamran Haider, deceased received a phone call and on inquiry of
Imran Haider, complainant (PW.7), he (deceased) informed that
Mst. Umm-i-Naila alias Laila, co-accused had called him and he
was going to meet her. On the said information, the complainant
suspected something wrong and followed his brother Kamran
Haider, deceased. No telephone number of Mst. Umm-i-Naila alias
Laila, co-accused has been mentioned in the FIR (Ex.PG/1) or in
the statement of any prosecution witness recorded by the police or
by the learned trial Court. Likewise, no phone number of Kamran
Haider (deceased) has been mentioned in the FIR or in the evidence
of any prosecution witness recorded by the police or by the learned

trial Court. Furthermore, no call data record of the phone numbers
Cri. Appeal No.2227 of 2014 7
Cri. Revision No.24 of 2015

of the deceased and Mst. Umm-i-Naila alias Laila, co-accused has
been collected in this case by the police to support the above
mentioned story of the complainant that he suspected something
wrong due to phone call of Mst. Umm-i-Naila alias Laila, co-
accused, therefore, he followed his brother, namely, Kamran Haider
(deceased) on the day of occurrence and reached at the spot where
he witnessed the occurrence. Similarly, Durrab Hussain (PW.8) has
made this excuse for establishing his presence at the spot at the
relevant time that he came to the spot which was situated in another
town at a distance of 15-KMs from his town, in order to get petrol
for his motorcycle but he conceded during his cross-examination
that many other petrol pumps were situated near his house. He did
not mention any valid reason for not getting petrol from the petrol
pump situated near his house and for travelling all the way to
another town which was situated at 15/20-KMs from his town to
get the petrol for his motorcycle. The relevant part of his statement

during cross-examination reads as under:-

“Tt is correct that I have no house, business place or
business concern near the place of occurrence. It is
correct that in my statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C Ex.DB and
in examination in chief, the only purpose was
mentioned i.e., getting petrol from the petrol pump. The
witness volunteered that I mentioned before the I.O that
I along with Ahmad Subhani went there to see the plot
in a SA garden but the I.O did not record said portion of
my statement. It is incorrect to suggest that my
volunteered portion is dishonest improvement just to
extent undue favour to the complainant party. It is
correct that in my statements u/s 161 Cr.P.C Ex.DB and
Ex.DC and in my examination in chief that fact has not
been mentioned. The witness volunteered that I had
disclosed that fact to the I.O. It is incorrect to suggest
that my volunteered portion is incorrect and false. It is
correct that there is PSO petrol located at Match factory
just to near my house. It is correct that petrol can also
be obtained from PSO petrol pump. It is correct that

there is another PSO petrol pump from the first PSO
Cri. Appeal No.2227 of 2014 8
Cri. Revision No.24 of 2015

petrol pump which is near Ferozewala bus stop. I
cannot say that there is an Attock petrol pump at Rana
Town bus stop. It is incorrect to suggest that I am
suppressing this fact with malafide. There might be a
shell Sitara petrol pump near Toll plaza Kala Shah
Kaku. It is correct that from all of the aforementioned
petrol pumps petrol could be obtained. There might be

seven petrol pumps on the opposite side of road.”

Although, Durrab Hussain (PW.8) made dishonest improvement
during his cross-examination that he told the investigating officer
that he alongwith Ahmad Subhani went to the place of occurrence
to see a plot in S.A Garden Housing Scheme but he conceded that
the said reason was not mentioned in his statements recorded under
section 161 Cr.P.C. Ex.DB or Ex.DC or even in his examination-in-
chief. It is, therefore, evident that Durrab Hussain (PW.8) made
dishonest improvement during his cross-examination by giving
another reason for his presence at the spot at the relevant time by
stating for the first time in the Court that he went to the place of
occurrence to see a plot in S.A. Garden Housing Scheme. He could
not give any valid reason for not getting petrol from petrol pumps
situated near his house. It does not appeal to a prudent mind that
instead of getting petrol from the petrol pumps situated near his
house, in his own town, he would go all the way to another town
situated at a distance of 15-KMs just to get petrol for his
motorcycle. Both the above mentioned eye witnesses could not
justify the reason given by them for their presence at the spot at the
time of occurrence. They are therefore, chance witnesses and as
such their evidence is not free from doubt. The Hon’ble Supreme
Court of Pakistan in the case of “Mst. Sughra Begum and another
Vs. Qaiser Pervez and others” (2015 SCMR 1142) at Para No.14,

observed regarding the chance witnesses as under:-

“14. A chance witness, in legal parlance is the
one who claims that he was present on the crime
spot at the fateful time, albeit, his presence there

was a sheer chance as in the ordinary course of
Cri. Appeal No.2227 of 2014 9
Cri. Revision No.24 of 2015

business, place of residence and normal course of
events, he was not supposed to be present on the
spot but at a place where he resides, carries on
business or runs day to day life affairs. It is in this
context that the testimony of chance witness,
ordinarily, is not accepted unless justifiable reasons
are shown to establish his presence at the crime
scene at the relevant time. In normal course, the
presumption under the law would operate about his
absence from the crime spot. True that in rare cases,
the testimony of chance witness may be relied upon,
provided some convincing explanations appealing
to prudent mind for his presence on the crime spot
are put forth, when the occurrence took place
otherwise, his testimony would fall within the
category of suspect evidence and cannot be

accepted without a pinch of salt.”

Likewise, in the case of “Sufvan Nawaz and another Vs. The State

and others” (2020 SCMR 192) at Para No.5, the Apex Court of the

country was pleased to observe as under:-

weet eeeee een eees He admitted that in his statement
before police, he had not assigned any reason for
coming to village on the day of occurrence. In these
circumstances, complainant Muhammad Arshad
(PW.7) is, by all means, a chance witness and his
presence at the spot at the relevant time is not free

from doubt.”

Similar view was taken in the case of “Muhammad Irshad_ JVs.

Allah Ditta and others” (2017 SCMR 142). Relevant part of the

said judgment at Para No.2 reads as under:-

ceedenenenenenenes Muhammad Irshad complainant
(PW8) and Rab Nawaz (PW9) were chance
witnesses and the stated reason for their presence
with the deceased at the relevant time had never
been established before the trial court through any

independent evidence............
Cri. Appeal No.2227 of 2014 10
Cri. Revision No.24 of 2015

As the above mentioned prosecution eye-witnesses are chance
witnesses and they could not prove the reason of their presence at
the spot at the time of occurrence, therefore, their very presence at

the spot at the relevant time becomes doubtful.

11. It is further noteworthy that as per prosecution case, the
occurrence in this case took place on 16.12.2010 at 9:00 A.M. but
as per statement of Dr. Khalid Bashir (PW.4), the postmortem
examination on the body of Kamran Haider deceased was
conducted on 17.12.2010 at 9:15 A.M. i.e. with the delay of more
than 24-hours from the occurrence. Although, Imran Haider,
complainant (PW.7) stated during his cross-examination that the
above mentioned delay in conducting the postmortem examination
on the body of deceased had occurred due to non-availability of the
Medical Officer but no such statement has been made by Dr.
Khalid Bashir (PW.4) that on 16.12.2010, no Medical Officer was
available in the concerned mortuary. The said witness rather stated
that the dead body was brought on 16.12.2010 at about 12:15 P.M.
without police papers and police papers were brought on
17.12.2010 at 9:15 A.M. and then he conducted the postmortem
examination on the body of the deceased. The above mentioned
delay in conducting the postmortem examination on the body of the
deceased is suggestive of the fact that the prosecution eye-witnesses
were not present at the spot at the relevant time and the said delay
was consumed in procuring the attendance of fake eye-witnesses. In

the case of “Zafar Vs. The State and others” (2018 SCMR 326),

the Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that delay of 11-hours in
conducting the postmortem examination shows that prosecution
eye-witnesses were not present at the spot at the time of occurrence,
therefore, the said delay was utilized for showing fake eye-
witnesses in the police papers. Likewise, in the case of
“Muhammad Ilyas Vs. Muhammad Abid alias Billa and others”
(2017 SCMR 54), the Apex Court of the Country was pleased to

observe that delay of nine-hours in conducting postmortem

examination suggests that prosecution eye-witnesses were not
Cri. Appeal No.2227 of 2014 11
Cri. Revision No.24 of 2015

present at the spot at the time of occurrence, therefore, the said
delay was used in procuring the attendance of fake eye-witnesses. I
am, therefore, of the considered view that the prosecution eye-
witnesses were not present at the spot at the time of occurrence
which resulted in the delay of postmortem examination of the

deceased.

12. As per prosecution case, the motive behind the occurrence
was that family members of Mst. Umm-i-Naila alias Laila, co-
accused wanted to marry her with Kamran Haider, deceased and for
the said purpose, her family members visited the house of the
complainant party 2/3 times but the family members of the
complainant party did not agree with the said proposal and due to
the above mentioned reason, the appellant and his co-accused
committed the murder of Kamran Haider, deceased. I have noted
that Imran Haider, complainant (PW.7) conceded that Kamran
Haider, deceased was already married prior to the occurrence. He
also conceded that even Mst. Umm-i-Naila alias Laila, co-accused
was also married prior to the occurrence with Syed Saqlain Shah,
appellant. He further conceded that no particular date, time, month
and year of the alleged marriage offer made by Mst. Umm-i-Naila
alias Laila, co-accused or her family members with the deceased
has been mentioned in the FIR. He also conceded that he did not
produce any elder of his family regarding the offer and refusal of
marriage proposal given by Mst. Umm-i-Naila alias Laila, co-
accused with the deceased during the investigation of this case. It is
further noteworthy that the motive was alleged against Mst. Umm-
i-Naila alias Laila, co-accused and she has been acquitted by the
learned trial Court and appeal filed against her acquittal i.e. Crl.
Appeal No.39 of 2015 has already been dismissed by this Court
vide order dated 20.11.2019 due to non-prosecution and restoration
application filed by the complainant has also been dismissed being
time barred vide order dated 09.06.2020. The motive was alleged
against Mst. Umm-i-Naila alias Laila, co-accused and no motive

whatsoever has been alleged by the prosecution against the
Cri. Appeal No.2227 of 2014 12
Cri. Revision No.24 of 2015

appellant. Keeping in view all the above mentioned facts, the
prosecution could not prove any motive against the appellant and
the same was rightly disbelieved by the learned trial Court in Para

No.32 of the impugned judgment.

13. Insofar as the recovery of pistol (P-5) from the possession of
the appellant and positive report of the Punjab Forensic Science
Agency, Lahore (Ex.PT) is concerned, I have noted that as per
report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore, the empties
recovered from the spot and pistol (P-5) were deposited together in
the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore on
08.07.2014 by Shahzada Qeqous (837/C). As the empties and pistol
(P-5) were deposited together in the office of Punjab Forensic
Science Agency, Lahore, therefore, it means that empties and pistol
(P-5) remained together at the police station. Under the
circumstances, possibility cannot be ruled out that fake empties
were prepared from pistol (P-5) allegedly recovered on the
pointation of the appellant and the same were sent to the office of
Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore for their comparison with
the said pistol. Although, it is argued by the learned Additional
Prosecutor General assisted by learned counsel for the complainant
that Mukhtar Ahmad, 983/C (PW.1), Mukhtar Ahmad, ASI (PW.6),
and Ali Ashraf, S.I (PW.9) have stated that empties were sent to the
office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore on 14.01.2011
whereas the pistol was recovered on the pointation of the appellant
on 06.02.2011 and the same was sent to the office of Punjab
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore on 22.02.2011 but the above
mentioned oral evidence of the prosecution has been excluded by
the documentary evidence i.e. report of the Punjab Forensic Science
Agency, Lahore (Ex.PT) which shows that the empties and pistol
(P-5) were deposited together in the above mentioned office. The
said report has been produced in evidence and relied upon by the
prosecution itself. The Apex Court of the Country in the case of

“Mushtaq and 3 others Vs. The State” (PLD 2008 Supreme Court

1) disbelieved the prosecution evidence qua the recovery of firearm
Crl. Appeal No.2227 of 2014 13
Cri. Revision No.24 of 2015

weapon and positive report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency,
Lahore, when empties and firearm were deposited together in the

office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore.

Likewise, in the case of “Jehangir Vs. Nazar Farid and

another” (2002 SCMR 1986), recovery of weapon of offence and
positive report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore were
disbelieved on the ground that empties and rifle were kept together
at the police station, therefore, possibility of preparation of fake
empties cannot be ruled out under the circumstances. It is further
noteworthy that as per report of the Punjab Forensic Science
Agency, Lahore (Ex.PT), the empties and pistol were deposited in
the said office by Shahzada Qeqous (837/C) but the said witness
has not been produced in the witness box by the prosecution. Under
the circumstances, the recovery of pistol (P-5) on the pointation of
the appellant and positive report of the Punjab Forensic Science

Agency, Lahore (Ex.PT) are of no avail to the prosecution.

14. It is further important to note that as per prosecution
evidence, Syed Saqlain Shah (appellant) and Muhammad Saleem
alias Kali Gujjar, co-accused were assigned a joint role of making
fire shots at Kamran Haider, deceased which landed on the different
parts of his body. The above mentioned Muhammad Saleem alias
Kali Gujjar, co-accused has been acquitted by the learned trial
Court vide the impugned judgment dated 28.11.2014 whereas Syed
Saqlain Shah (appellant) has been convicted and sentenced on the
basis of same prosecution evidence. Criminal Appeal No.39 of
2015 filed against the acquittal of said co-accused has already been
dismissed by this Court vide order dated 20.11.2019 due to non-
prosecution and restoration application filed by the complainant has
also been dismissed being time barred vide order dated 09.06.2020.
It is by now well settled that if the same prosecution evidence is
disbelieved qua one accused then the said evidence cannot be
believed against the other accused without independent
corroboration which is very much lacking in this case. The learned

trial Court distinguished the case of the appellant with the case of
Cri. Appeal No.2227 of 2014 14
Cri. Revision No.24 of 2015

Muhammad Saleem alias Kali Gujjar, co-accused on the ground
that appellant was declared guilty during the police investigation
whereas Muhammad Saleem alias Kali Gujjar, co-accused was
declared innocent and on the ground that no weapon was recovered.
from the possession of Muhammad Saleem alias Kali Gujjar, co-
accused whereas pistol (P-5) has been recovered from the
possession of the appellant. Insofar as the police opinion regarding
the innocence or guilt of an accused is concerned, it is by now well
settled that police opinion/finding becomes irrelevant after
recording of evidence of the parties by the learned trial Court. It is
further noteworthy that opinion of the police is inadmissible in
evidence. Reference in this context may be made to the case of
“Muhammad Ahmad (Mahmood Ahmed) and another Vs. The
State” (2010 SCMR 660) wherein at page No.676 the Hon’ble

Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to observe as under:-

beeees It may be mentioned here, for the benefit and
guidance of all concerned, that determination of
guilt or innocence of the accused persons was the
exclusive domain of only the Courts of law
established for the purpose and the said sovereign
power of the Courts could never be permitted to be
exercised by the employees of the Police
department or by anyone else for that matter. If the
tendency of allowing such-like impressions of the
Investigating Officer to creep into the evidence was
not curbed then the same could lead to disastrous
consequences. If an accused person could be let off
or acquitted only because the Investigating Officer
was of the opinion that such an accused person was
innocent then why could not, on the same principle,
another accused person be hanged to death only
because the Investigating Officer had opined about

his guilt.........

It is, therefore, evident that the case of the appellant cannot be
distinguished from the case of Muhammad Saleem alias Kali

Gujjar, co-accused on the basis of police opinion.
Cri. Appeal No.2227 of 2014 15
Cri. Revision No.24 of 2015

Insofar as the recovery of weapon of offence from the
possession of the appellant is concerned, even on the said ground
the case of the appellant is not distinguishable from the case of
Muhammad Saleem alias Kali Gujjar, co-accused because the
recovery of pistol (P-5) on the pointation of the appellant and
positive report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore
(Ex.PT) have already been disbelieved due to the reasons
mentioned in Paragraph No.13 of this judgment. Learned
Additional Prosecutor General assisted by learned counsel for the
complainant next argued that motive was alleged against the
appellant and the same was not alleged against the above
mentioned co-accused, therefore, case of the appellant is
distinguishable from the case of Muhammad Saleem alias Kali
Gujjar, co-accused but the motive alleged by the prosecution has
also been disbelieved by the learned trial Court, as well as, by this
Court on account of reasons mentioned in Paragraph No.12 of this
judgment. Under the circumstances, the case of the appellant is not
distinguishable from the case of Muhammad Saleem alias Kali
Gujjar, co-accused and as such, the prosecution evidence which has
been disbelieved against Muhammad Saleem alias Kali Gujjar, co-
accused cannot be believed against the appellant without
independent corroboration which is very much lacking in this case,
therefore, the appellant is also entitled to the acquittal from the
charge. In the case of Muhammad Akram Vs. The State” (2012
SCMR 440) the Apex Court of the Country at Page-446 was

pleased to observe as under:-

seeeeeenee Since the same set of evidence has been
disbelieved qua the involvement of Muhammad Aslam,
as such, the same evidence cannot be relied upon in
order to convict the appellant on a capital charge as the
statements of both the eye-witnesses do not find any
corroboration from any piece of independent

evidence..........

Similar view was taken by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in

the cases reported as “Akhtar Ali and others Vs. The State”’ (2008

Crl. Appeal No.2227 of 2014 16
Cri. Revision No.24 of 2015

SMCR 6), “Muhammad Ali Vs. The State” (2015 SCMR 137) and
“Ulfat Husain Vs. The State” (2018 SCMR 313).

15. Ihave considered all the aspects of this case and have come
to this irresistible conclusion that the prosecution could not prove

its case against the appellant beyond the shadow of doubt.

16. In the light of above discussion, I accept Criminal Appeal
No.2227 of 2014 filed by Syed Saqlain Shah (appellant), set aside
his conviction and sentence recorded by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge, Ferozwala, District Sheikhupura vide impugned
judgment dated 28.11.2014 and acquit him of the charge under
Section 302(b) PPC by extending him the benefit of doubt. Syed
Saqlain Shah (appellant) is in custody, he be released forthwith, if

not required in any other case.

17. Insofar the criminal revision i.e., Crl. Revision No.24 of
2015, filed by Imran Haider (complainant) for enhancement of
sentence, awarded by the learned trial Court against Syed Saqlain
Shah (appellant) from imprisonment for life to death is concerned, I
have already disbelieved the prosecution evidence due to the
reasons mentioned in paragraph Nos.10 to 15 of this judgment and
Syed Saqlain Shah (appellant) has been acquitted from the charge,
therefore, this criminal revision being devoid of any force is hereby

dismissed.
