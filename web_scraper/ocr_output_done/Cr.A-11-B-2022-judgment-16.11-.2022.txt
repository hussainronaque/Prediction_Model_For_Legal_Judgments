SAHIBZADA _ASADULLAH, _J.--- The appellants,
Muhammad Tufail. and Mehmooc Hassan, after having
been tried by the learned Additional Sessions Judge at
Takht-e-Nasrati, District Karak for the charges under
section 302/34 PPC in case FIR No.165 dated 24.03.2020
of Police Station Y.K.S Takht-e-Nasrati, District Karak,
were convicted under section 302(b)/34 P.P.C and
sentenced to life imprisonment as Tazir with fine of
Rs.5,00,000/- as compensation to the legal heirs of
deceased within the meaning of section 544-A Cr.P.C or in

default thereof, to undergo six months S.I each. Benefit
-2-

under section 382-B Cr.P.C was also extended to the
appellants vide judgment dated 12.01.2022.

2. Feeling aggrieved, the appellants have assailed the
judgment and the awarded sentence through the instant
criminal appeal, whereas, brother of the deceased, Amjad
Ali, being aggrieved of the quantum of sentence has moved
Criminal Revision Petition No.08-B/2022 for enhancement
of the same. Since both these matters have arisen out of the
same judgment, therefore, we intend to decide the same
through this common judgment.

3. The transient facts, as unfolded in the first
information report, are that on 24.03.2020 at 13:20 hours,
complainant / deceased then injured Aziz Ullah brought by
his co-villagers in injured condition to KDA Hospital,
Karak lodged a report to the effect that on the eventful day,
he was present in his house, when heard noise of his
children; that in response thereof, he came out from the
house and saw accused / appellants Mahmood Hassan and
Tufail, his co-villagers, duly armed: with firearms, who, on
seeing him, started firing at him in order to commit his
Qatl-i-Amd, due to which, the complainant got hit and
injured. The occurrence is stated to have been witnessed by
Muhammad Ilyas and motive is alleged to be a dispute over

a thoroughfare. The report of the. complainant was also
-3-

verified by his brother Amjad Ali. The report was reduced
into writing in the shape of murasila Ex.PW-1/1, which was
sent to the police station for registration of the case, on the
basis of which, the case was registered against the accused /
appellants under section 324/34 PPC on 24.03.2020. The
complainant / injured was referred to Peshawar where he
remained under treatment in Lady Reading Hospital,
Peshawar and was later on discharged therefrom, however,
thereafter his condition deteriorated and _ ultimately,
succumbed to his injuries on 19.04.2020 and autopsy on his
dead body was accordingly conducted in DHQ Hospital,
Karak. Consequently, the section of law too was altered
from one under section 324 PPC to 302 PPC.

4. Initially, accused Mehmood Hassan was arrested on
24.03.2020, whereas, co-accused Muhammad Tufail opted
to remain in hiding, but he was subsequently arrested on
16.05.2020 and after completion of investigation, challan
was submitted against both the accused, where at the
commencement of trial, the prosecution produced and
examined as many as 11 witnesses. On close of prosecution
evidence, statements of appellants were recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C wherein they professed innocence and
false implication, however, neither they opted to be

examined on oath as provided under section 340(2) Cr.P.C
-4-

nor wished to produce defence evidence. After hearing
arguments, the learned trial Court vide the impugned
judgment, convicted and sentenced the appellants as
mentioned above. Hence, the instant criminal appeal against
the judgment of conviction and the criminal revision for
enhancement of the sentence.

5. | We have heard at extensive length arguments of
learned counsel for the parties as well as that of learned
Assistant Advocate General for the State and scanned
through the record, with their valuable assistance.

6. The deceased then injured after receiving firearm
injuries was shifted to KDA Hospital Karak, where he
reported the matter to the local police in respect of the
incident and charged the accused / appellants for
commission of the offence. The police official after
examining the injured, prepared the injury sheet and
thereafter, drafted the murasila and the deceased then
injured was sent to the doctor, for medical examination,
under the escort of constable Afaq Ahmad No.535. The
injured was examined by the doctor and after giving first
aid to the deceased then injured, he was referred to
Peshawar for further treatment and as such, the injured was
shifted to LRH Peshawar. The murasila was incorporated in

the FIR and the investigating officer after receiving copy of

-5-

the FIR visited the spot and prepared the site plan. During
spot inspection, the investigating officer collected
bloodstained earth from place of the deceased then injured
and also recovered a spent bullet, two crime empties one
each of .30 & 9mm bore. The investigating officer packed
and sealed the bloodstained earth into parcel No.1, the spent

bullet in parcel No.2, the crime empty of .30 bore in parcel

--~ Nd.3 and the empty of 9mm bore in parcel No.4 vide
a

a recovery memo Ex.PC. Accused / appellant Mehmood

“

Hassan was arrested by the local police and the weapon of
offence i.e .30 bore pistol bearing No.4108 (Ex.P6)
alongwith fixed and spare charger containing 09 rounds of
the same bore was also recovered from his possession and
in that respect, FIR No.166 dated 24.03.2020 was registered
against him under section 15-AA at Police Station YKS,
Karak. The crime bullet was sealed in parcel No.2, crime
empties were sealed in parcels No.3 & 4 respectively, and
the weapon of offence was separately sealed in parcel No.1
and were sent to the Firearms Expert for ascertaining the
fact that from which bore the same were fired and as to
whether the incriminating articles were fired from the same
weapon or otherwise. The laboratory report in respect of the
pistol was received that the crime empty marked C1 and the

crime bullet marked “B” were fired from the pistol in
-6-

question, whereas, the other empty was reported to have
been fired from 9mm bore. It is pertinent to mention that
the deceased then injured remained under treatment at LRH
Peshawar and was discharged from the hospital whose
condition suddenly deteriorated thereafter and ultimately,
breathed his last on 19.04.2020., Inquest report of the
deceased was prepared and his dead body was sent under
the escort of constable Afaq Ahmad No.535 to the mortuary
for postmortem examination. As the deceased then injured
had received firearm injuries on 24.03.2020 and died on
19.04.2020 after he was discharged from LRH Peshawar, so
a medical board was constituted in order to ascertain the
exact cause of his death. Autopsy on the dead body of the
deceased was conducted at DHQ Hospital Karak vide
postmortem report ExPM and according to the medical
board, so constituted, the cause of death came out to be
“firearm injury to the chest’ and thoracic spine
cardiopulmonary failure and paraplegia” vide its report
Ex.PM/1. Thereafter, the section of law too was altered
from one under section 324 PPC to 302 PPC and in that
respect, a report ExPF was prepared.

7. The record was scanned through with valuable
assistance of learned counsel for the parties and also the

worthy Assistant Advocate General in order to see as to
-7-

whether the learned trial Court was justified to convict the
appellants and that as to whether the learned trial judge
appreciated the available record in its true perspective. This
Court is to see as to whether the learned trial Court
appreciated the evidence on file; as to whether the
impugned judgment finds support from record of the case
and as to whether the conclusion drawn by the learned trial
Judge is the outcome of assessment of evidence on file and
the recorded statements of witnesses. This being the Court
of appeal is under the obligation to reassess the already
assessed evidence and to re-appreciate the evidence once
appreciated, so that miscarriage of justice could be avoided.
8. The moot questions to be answered by this Court are
as to whether the incident occurred in the mode, manner
and at the stated time; as to whether the deceased then
injured was capable to talk and that: it was he who reported
the matter; as to whether the eye witness was present at the
crime scene at the time of occurrence and as to whether the
prosecution succeeded in bringing on record substantial
evidence to connect the appellant with the murder of the
deceased. The foremost question, which needs to be
determined in the first instance is, as to whether at the time
of making the report, the complainant was conscious

enough and well oriented in time and space or otherwise.
-8-

The report was lodged by the deceased then injured himself
and the occurrence is stated to have been witnessed by one
Muhammad Ilyas. The murasila report ExPA scribed by
PW-01 Muhammad Ismail Khan Incharge Casualty KDA
Hospital Karak reflects that the deceased then injured was
in full senses while reporting the occurrence and that the
report was read over to the complainant, who, after
admitting the it correct, thumb impressed the same. When
the scribe entered into the witness box as PW-01, he,
though admitted it correct that he has not obtained any
certificate regarding the consciousness or otherwise, of the
victim, from Medical Officer, but the witness has explained
it well that the victim was conscious and capable to talk.
Besides, we have before us an eye witness of the
occurrence, who was examined as PW-10, The witness
narrated the story, right from the beginning till the end, in a
straightforward manner and has consistently supported the
prosecution case against the accused / appellants. The
witness has confirmed that the injured himself reported the
matter to the local police in KDA Hospital Karak and that
the report was verified by his brother Amjad Ali. The
witness remained adamant to the factum of consciousness
of the complainant at the time of making the report. We

cannot lose sight of the fact that the occurrence has taken
-9-

place on 24.03.2020, whereas, the injured breathed his last
on 19.04.2020, after he was discharged from the hospital. It
is an admitted position on the record that initially, the
deceased then injured was referred to Peshawar and he
remained under treatment in LRH Peshawar wherefrom he
was discharged. It is evident from the record that it was on
04.04.2020, when the investigating officer took the
complainant to the spot where the complainant verified the
places assigned to the accused / appellants at the time of
occurrence and in this respect, a footnote was added to the
site plan (ExPB/3) by the investigating officer with red ink.
The snapshots of this episode have also been brought on
record by the investigating officer as Ex.PD. The victim at
the time of verification has confirmed the places assigned to
the accused / appellants to be the same as they stood at the
time they were committing the offence. If, for a while, we
admit that the victim was unconscious at the time of report,
then we cannot lose sight of the fact that the victim has
never denied the involvement of either of the accused /
appellants in the episode, after he was discharged from the
hospital, rather it was he who held them responsible for the
injuries they caused to him, before the investigating officer
and it was he who verified the site plan. The Medical

Officer, who had examined the injured, was produced as
-10-

PW-04. There is no denial of the fact that neither the scribe
has asked the doctor nor the doctor himself took pain to
provide a certificate with regard to the consciousness or
otherwise of the victim at the time of making the report,
which was crucial as far as condition of the victim was
concerned, but this case has its unique facts &
circumstances, where on one hand, the victim remained
alive for 26 long days and was discharged from the hospital
after he had recovered to a good extent, whereas, on the
other, he accompanied the investigating officer to the spot
:
for verification, which aspect has duly been corroborated
not only by the eye witness, but the investigating officer as
well, while recording his statement. It is evident from the
record that the doctor was not cross examined by the
defence as to whether the victim was conscious at the time
of his examination or otherwise and.even no suggestion was
put to the witness in that respect. This further confirms our
belief that the scribe has correctly deposed that the victim
was conscious. Keeping in view the highlighted aspects of
the case, we are confident to hold: that the deceased then
injured was well oriented in time and space while making
the report and it was none else, but the accused / appellants,

who were charged by the victim for the incident.
-li-

9. As the only fact that the deceased then injured was
oriented in time and space while making the report and that
his claim with regard to involvement of accused / appellants
in the incident through the dying declaration is not
sufficient to maintain the conviction, rather we have to walk
an extra mile and to see as to whether the dying declaration
has been corroborated by other evidence on record or
otherwise. In order to appreciate this particular aspect of the
case, we scanned through the available record. We find that
the occurrence is claimed to have been witnessed by
Muhammad Ilyas, who was examined as PW-10. The
witness stated that it was on 24.03.2020 at about 12:30
hours, when he came out of his house and saw the accused /
appellants busy in blockage of pathway; that he tried to stop
them, but they did not, which led to exchange of hot words
between them; that in the meanwhile, deceased then injured
came there where the accused / appellants, on seeing him,
started firing at him, due to which, he got hit and fell down;
that thereafter, the accused / appellants fled away towards
Kam Lawaghar side, while he alongwith others shifted the
injured to KDA Hospital Karak waere the victim himself
reported the occurrence to local police and his report was
verified by his brother Amjad Ali; that the injured was

referred to Peshawar where he remained under treatment
-12-

and was discharged after he recovered to a good extent; that
thereafter, the investigating officer, took the victim to the
spot for verification and the victim accordingly verified the
site plan to the investigating officer on 04.04.2020; that on
19.04.2020, the condition of the victim suddenly
deteriorated and as such, breathed his last. Though, it was
submitted that the witness is closely related to the victim, so
he being related and interested witness could not have been
relied upon, that too, on capital charge, but we are not in
agreement with what was submitted. We are mindful of the
fact that interested witness is one who has a motive to
falsely implicate. There cannot be an inflexible rule that the
statement of an interested witness;can never be accepted
without corroboration. Though, the witness has admitted
that the deceased Aziz Ullah was his maternal uncle, but
mere relationship of a witness with the deceased is not
sufficient to discredit a witness, more particularly, when
there is no motive with regard to false implication of the
accused, as is the case before us. There is no cavil to the
proposition that believing or disbelieving a witness depends
upon the intrinsic value of the statement made by the
witness and there is no universal principle that in every
case, interested witness shoulc be disbelieved or

disinterested witnesses be believed, rather it depends upon
-13-

the rule of prudence and reasonableness to hold that a
particular witness was present on the scene of crime and
that he is making a true statement. What is relevant is what
statement has been given and it is not the person, but the
statement of that person, which is to be seen and adjudged.
Reliance is placed on “Sajid Mehmood Vs_The_ State”
(2022 SCMR 1882). It has not been brought on record that
what exactly motivated the eye witness to depose against
the accused / appellants, that too, in a murder case. The
witness was cross examined on material aspects of the case
by the learned defence counsel, but nothing detrimental to
the prosecution case could be brought from his mouth,
rather he remained consistent and firmly disclosed the
events in the manner it occurred, The witness disclosed the
pre-occurrence circumstances, the mode & manner in which
the accused / appellants perpetrated the offence soon on
coming of the deceased then injured to the spot and the
post-occurrence circumstances. The conduct displayed by
the witness is natural and finds complete support from the
attending circumstances of the case. So, in the
circumstances, the defence has badly failed either to
impeach the credit of this witness or to shatter his presence
at the crime scene at the crucial time and, therefore, mere

relationship between the deceased and the witness remained
-14-

no ground to dislodge the deposition of this witness, as has
been attempted.
10. The investigating officer after receiving copy of the
FIR visited the spot where he recovered a spent bullet
Ex.P2 and an empty of 9mm bore ExP4 vide recovery
memo ExPC. An empty of .30 bore ExP3 was also taken
into possession vide recovery memo ExPC/1. It is pertinent
to mention that on 24,03.2020, a .30 bore pistol bearing
No.4108 with fixed and spare charger containing 09 rounds
of same bore was recovered from accused / appellant
Mehmood Hassan and in that respect, a separate FIR
No.166 was registered against him under section 15-AA. As
the pistol recovered was suspected to be the weapon of
offence, so the same alongwith the above incriminating
articles, sealed in separate parcels, were sent to the
Firearms Expert for opinion where the report was tendered
to the effect that the crime empty marked C1 and the crime
bullet marked “B” were fired from the pistol in question,
whereas, the crime empty marked C2 was opined to be that
of 9mm bore vide Ex.PK/1. Thus, it has been established
that on one hand, the pistol recovered was the same as used
in the commission of offence, whereas, on the other, the
offence perpetrated appeared to be tie job of two assailants.

As far as bloodstained earth is concerned, its report ExPZ
-15-

too was tendered in positive. Though, it was contended that
when the accused / appellant Mehmood Hassan earned
acquittal in the trial under section 15-AA, then the
laboratory report confirming the pistol recovered as weapon
of offence loses its efficacy in the murder case and, as such,
the same could in no way be used as a circumstantial or
corroborative piece of evidence against the accused, which,
in turn, impairs the very foundation of the prosecution case.
This limb of the arguments is of ng help to the defence, as
on one hand, case of the prosecution has independently
been proved through dying declaration, trustworthy ocular
account coupled with the collected evidence on record,
whereas, on the other, we cannot lose sight of the fact that
besides the recovery weapon of offence, the crime empties
and spent bullet recovered from the spot have been found to
be that of .30 & 9mm bores, which aspect suggests the
offence to be the job of two assailants. In the given
circumstances, we hold that mere acquittal in the connected
case under section 15-AA cannot be taken as a sole ground
for acquittal in the murder case, more particularly, when the
charges have independently been proved through
trustworthy evidence like ocular account, dying declaration,
and other evidence which inspires confidence as is the case

before us.
-16-

11. So far as medical evidence is.concerned, it comprises
of injury sheet ExPW-1/1, medico legal certificate ExPW-
4/1, inquest report ExPW-1/3 and postmortem report
ExPM. True that medical evidence is confirmatory in nature
and that alone is not sufficient for conviction of an accused
charged, but equally true that when the prosecution
otherwise succeeds in bringing on record strong evidence in
its favour, then medical evidence can be read and
considered in aid of the collected evidence. The locale,
number, and nature of injuries on person of the deceased
then injured coupled with the weapons used in perpetrating
the offence are in line with the dying declaration, ocular
account as well as the collected evidence and, therefore, the
medical evidence lends full support to the prosecution case.
The record is indicative of the fact that the deceased died as
a result of firearm injuries. The deposition of the victim has
been corroborated by the witnesses so produced and record
made available. It was vehemently argued that dying
declaration is a weak kind of evidence and is hardly
sufficient for the conviction of an accused charged, but we
are afraid that the defence went wrong while asking our
indulgence in its favour. It has never been held that the
declaration of a dying man merits no consideration, but

instead, much care is advised and for the purpose,
-17-

precautionary measures were asked while relying upon such
a statement. If we say that it is a weak type of evidence, it
does not mean that it has lost sanctity as in that eventuality,
we will commit an error, which is hard to be rectified. The
legislature was fully conscious of its importance, that’s why
its glimpses can be seen in the erstwhile Evidence Act,
1872 in the form of section 22, which was implanted in the
shape of Article 46 in the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984.
There is no denial of the fact that dying declaration is
admissible under Article 46 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat
Order, 1984, nevertheless, its evidentiary value and exact
place in prosecution case is a different question, which
has to be answered in each case according to its attending
circumstances keeping in mind the factum of its due

corroboration. In one of its landmark judgments, the

bd

Apex Court in the case of “Abdul Razik Vs The State’
(PLD _1965 SC 151) has observed that believing or
disbelieving a dying declaration is not an exercise in
application of law, but an application of simple human

judgment. The relevant portion of the judgment reads as

under:

"Now, in the concept of a judicial
trial according to the mode
practiced in the British

Jurisprudence, belief or disbelief as
-18-

to the credibility of a witness is a
matter which is left entirely to the
final judgment of a jury. It is notin
any respect a question of law
whether a witness appearing at a
trial a deposing as to an incident
Should be believed or should not be
believed. The conclusion eventually
reached is not an exercise in the
application of law, but merely an
application of simple human
judgment. Therefore, it is plain that
the three learned Judges in the
High Court were faced with no
legal problem, but merely a
question of ordinary human
judgment. The man who made these
statements did not appear before
the trial Judge. The usual aids to
belief or disbelief, namely, the
appearance of the face of the
witness as he makes a statement,
the manner in which he receives a
question, considers his reply and
states it, the manner in which he
faces cross-examination and meets
objections affecting his veracity,
and such other factors by which the
human judgment is assisted, are all
absent. There is only the bare
record on paper of what he said to

two persons in the brief time which
an

-19-

elapsed between the firing and his
death. Neither of the persons who
recorded his statement was asked
whether he thought the man was
saying something which he had
been prepared to say, something
which was artificial, or, on the
contrary, judging by his expression
and the way he spoke, that he was
telling the simple truth, Yet, this
being the only evidence available, it
is the duty of the Courts to decide
whether or not they can believe it.
To accept it without considering the
surrounding circumstances would
be totally inconsistent with the safe
dispensation of justice. To accept it
on considerations of expressions of
opinion regarding similar
declarations in precedent cases,
even if those opinions are
accompanied by words indicating
reliance on some principle of law, is
no less dangerous. Only after the
most careful scrutiny, applied to all
the physical) circumstances as they
appear from the evidence, is it
possible to decide whether it can be
said, with the degree of certainty
which is made obligatory for
reaching a conclusioti of guilt, that

the account given by the deceased
Q)

-20-
of the manner in which he met his
death is worthy of belief."

12. While dealing with the matter, one must be aware of
the guideline given and parameters provided by the
Superior Courts of the land from time to time. As discussed
earlier, the deceased then injured was capable to talk, the
next test is to see the worth of the collected evidence and
the extent of support it provides. The continuous struggle of
the investigating officer to collect the most reliable
evidence and the ocular account so furnished have added a
lot to the worth of the report made by the injured
complainant. In the present case, a well knit chain of events
has been created by the prosecution, which touches both the
ends, so we find it hard to discard the same, that too, for no
good reason. The continuity of events and the due
corroboration that has been established leaves no space for
indulgence and we, with no hesitation, hold that the
prosecution fully succeeded in labeling the appellants as the
actual killers.
13. As regards motive, it was set up as dispute over a
thoroughfare, which the accused / appellants were blocking.
Though, the investigating officer did not bring on record
confidence inspiring evidence in support of the motive

alleged, but there is no cavil to the;proposition that motive
-21-

is a double edged weapon, which could cut either side, as if
it could be the reason to kill the deceased, the same could as
well be the reason to charge the accused falsely on
suspicion by the relatives of deceased. In any case, it is not
necessary for the prosecution to set motive, but once it sets
the same, then the prosecution would be required to prove.
We are cognizant of the fact that failure to prove motive is a
factor to be considered against the prosecution, but it is not
the rule of thumb that in every case, if prosecution fails to
prove motive, it would automatically lead to acquittal of
accused charged, rather the failure is not always fatal to
prosecution, more particularly, when the charge is
otherwise proved through trustworthy evidence as is the
case in hand. Such failure may, however, react upon the
quantum of sentence on a capital charge as was held by the
august Supreme Court in the case of “Ali Bux & others Vs
The State” (2018 SCMR 354). The relevant portion of the
judgment reads as under:

“The law is settled by now that if the

prosecution asserts a motive, but

fails to prove the same then such

failure on the part of the prosecution

may react against a sentence of

death passed against a convict on a
-22-

capital charge and a reference in this
respect may be made to the cases of
Ahmad Nawaz y, T he State (2011
SCMR 593), Iftikhar Mehmood and
another v. Qaiser Iftikhar and others
(2011 SCMR 1165), Muhammad
Mumtaz v. The State and another
(2012, SCMR_ 267), Muhammad
Imran @ Asif v. The State (2013
SCMR 782), Sabir Hussain alias
Sabri v. The State (2013 SCMR
1554), Zeeshan Afzal alias Shani
and another v. The State and another
(2013 SCMR 1602), Naveed alias
Needu and others v. The State and
others (2014 SCMR_ 1464),
Muhammad Nadeem Wagas and
another v. The State, (2014 SCMR
1658), Muhammad Asif».
Muhammad Akhtar and others (2016
SCMR 2035) and Qaddan and others
v. The State (2017 SCMR 148).”
14. The cumulative effect of whet has been stated above

leads this Court nowhere, but to hold that the prosecution
-23-

has successfully brought home charge against the accused /
appellants through trustworthy, reliable, and confidence
inspiring evidence. It has been proved that the victim. was.
oriented in time and space while making the report and as
such, case of the prosecution is supported by the dying
declaration. The prosecution has further been successful to
corroborate the dying declaration through ocular account,
circumstantial and medical evidence. The peculiar facts &
circumstances so highlighted supported not only the dying
declaration, but the ocular account as well. The ocular
account is trustworthy and inspires confidence being in line
with the prosecution version. The medical evidence also
gives complete support to the prosecution version, as the
locale, nature, and number of injuries are in line with record
of the case and the deposition made. The learned trial judge
has, therefore, rightly convicted the accused / appellants.
The impugned judgment does not suffer from misreading or
non-reading of any material piece’of evidence, rather the
same is well reasoned and finds support from record of the
case and the recorded statements, which does not call for
any interference. The instant criminal appeal being bereft of
any merit is hereby dismissed.

15. Now diverting to the quantum of sentence awarded

by the learned trial Court and the enhancement as sought
-24-

through the Criminal Revision Petition No.08-B/2022. We
went through record of the case minutely and in order to
ascertain as to what led the learned trial judge to choose a
lesser sentence instead of normal penalty of death, we
deemed it essential to go through record of the case once
again, which we did. As on one hand, the motive alleged by
the prosecution has not been proveci, whereas, on the other,
the recovery of pistol as weapon of offence could not be
established against accused / appellant Mehmood Hassan as
he has earned acquittal in the case under section 15-AA,
though this aspect does not absolve him in entirety since the
charge is otherwise established against him. As stated
above, it has consistently been held by the Apex Court that
failure of prosecution to prove motive may react upon the
quantum of sentence against a convict on a charge of
murder, so while deriving wisdom from the judgments of

the Apex Court reported as 2018 SCMR 911 “Mst. Nazia

Anwar Vs State”, 2018 SCMR 149 “Nadeem Ramzan Vs
State”, 2018 SCMR 21 “Hag Nawaz_Vs_ State”, 2017

SCMR 2048 “Ghulam Muhammad Vs State”, 2017 SCMR

1662 “Zahoor Ahmad Vs State”, and 2017 SCMR 880

“Qurban Hussain _Vs_State” aid while taking into

consideration the factum of recovery of pistol as weapon of

offence having not been established as mitigating
-25-

circumstances, we are not persuaded to interfere and honour
the request of the petitioner for enhancement of the
sentence. We do appreciate the approach of the learned trial
Court on this particular aspect of the case and the quantum
of awarded sentence is fully justified, which hardly calls for

interference. The instant criminal revision being bereft of

merit is dismissed as such.
