JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN__KHAN, J:-By invoking the
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199
of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973,
Kaleem Ullah, the petitioner, seeks setting-aside of order
dated 26.09.2020, passed by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge/Justice of Peace, Kohat as well as
quashment of FIR No.245 dated 01.10.2020 under sections
324/337-F(ii)/337-F(iii)/34 PPC at Police Station Shakar
Dara Kohat, registered on the basis of the aforesaid order
of the Justice of Peace.

2. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record perused.

3. It appears from record that FIR No.172 dated

24.06.2020 under sections 302/324/148/149 PPC and
section 15 KP Arms Act, has been registered against
respondents No.1 to 5, on the report of petitioner Kaleem
Ullah in Police Station Shakar Daraa Kohat, wherein he
has charged the respondents for murder, attempt to commit
murder and causing injuries to him as well as PWs. About
the same incident, on the report of respondent/accused,
namely, Aqib Khan daily diary report No.21 dated
24.06.2020, has also been registered wherein he has
charged present petitioner and his co-accused for attempt to
commit murder and causing injuries to him and PWs.
Complainant of Mad report No.21 requested the local
police for registration of separate FIR, but his request was
turned down, resultantly, he filed an application under
section 22-A(6) Cr.P.C. before the learned Justice of Peace
Kohat, which was allowed vide impugned order dated
26.09.2020, on the basis whereof, the impugned FIR
No.245 (ibid) was registered against the present petitioner
and his co-accused.

4. In both the FIRS, the day, date, time and place of
occurrence coupled with the parties are one and the same.
In this view of the matter, the two versions of the rival
complainants are about one and the same incident accusing
each other. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in its recent
judgment, rendered in casee titled, “Mst. Sughran Bibi Vs
the State” (PLD 2018 Supreme Court _595), after an

elaborate and thorough discussion has resolved the issue,
namely, “Whether a separate FIR can be registered for every new

version of the same incident when commission of the relevant
cognizable offence already stands reported to police and an FIR
already stands registered in that regard or not? If no separate FIR
can be registered for any new version of the same incident then
now can such new version be recorded and investigated by the

Police?, as under:-

“As a result of the discussion made above we
declare the legal position as follows:-

(i) According to section 154 Cr.P.C., an FIR is only
the first information report to the local police
about commission of a cognizable offence. For
instance, an information received from any
source that a murder has been committed in such
and such village is to be a valid and sufficient
basis for registration of an FIR in that regard.

(ii) If the information received by the local police
about commission of a cognizable offence also
contains a version as to how the relevant offence
was committed, by whom it was committed and
in which background it was committed then that
version of the incident is only the version of the
informant and nothing more and such version is
not to be unreservedly accepted by the
investigating officer as the truth or the whole
truth.

(iii) Upon registration of an FIR a criminal “case”
come s into existence and that case is to be
assigned a number and such case carries the
same number till the final decision of the matter.

(iv) During the investigation conducted after
registration of an FIR the investigating officer
may record any number of versions of the same
incident brought to his notice by different
persons which versions are to be recorded by him
under section 161 Cr.P.C. in the same case. No

separate FIR is to be recorded for any new
version of the same incident brought to the notice
of the investigating officer during the
investigation of the case.

(v) During the investigation the investigating officer
is obliged to investigate the matter from all
possible angles while keeping in view all the
version of the incident brought to his notice and
as required by Rule 25.2(3) of the Police Rules,
1934 “It is the duty of an investigation officer to
find out the truth of the matter under
investigation. His object shall be to discover the
actual facts of the case and to arrest the real
offender or offenders. He shall not commit
himself prematurely to any view of the facts for

or against any person.”

5. Probably, the judgment (supra) of the august
Supreme Court was not brought into the notice of the
learned Justice of Peace, therefore, he reached to an
erroneous conclusion directing the police to register
separate FIR vide impugned order dated 26.09.2020, as a
result, the impugned FIR No.245 dated 01.10.2020 under
sections 324/337-F(ii)/337-F(iii)/34 PPC was registered in
PS Shakar Darra.

6. Accordingly, this petition is allowed. The
impugned order dated 29.09.2020 of the learned Justice of
Peace and consequential FIR No.245 (ibid) registered on
the basis thereof, are hereby quashed. The version of
complainant of FIR No.245 and the PWs shall be recorded
in the shape of statements under section 161 Cr.P.C. and

the Investigating Officer shall proceed with the
investigation in accordance with the observations and
directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in its judgment

rendered in Mt. Sughran Bibi’s case (PLD 2018 Supreme

Court 595).
