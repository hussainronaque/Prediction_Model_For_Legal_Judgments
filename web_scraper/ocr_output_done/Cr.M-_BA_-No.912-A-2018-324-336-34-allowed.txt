OE 8 OK oR

SYED MUHAMMAD ATTIQUE SHAH, _J.-
Accused-petitioner, Naeem Khan son of Alamgir,
after having been refused bail by the learned lower
Court in case F.I.R No.16 dated 13.05.2018 under
section 324/336 PPC, Police Station Jalkot, Kohistan,
has approached to this Court for the same relief by
filing the instant bail petition.

2. Brief facts of the case, as narrated in the

F.I.R. by Abdul Sattar complainant in injured
condition to the police are that he was cleaning his
rifle at his home at about 8.00 AM, which was
suddenly and accidently went off and the bullet in its
chamber got hit on his right thigh and knee, as a result
thereof, he sustained injuries. He did not charge
anybody in his report and the occurrence was stated to
have witnessed by inmates of his house including his
brothers Abdul Ghaffar and Bakhtiar Ahmad, who
alongwith other took him for treatment.

3. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
accused/petitioner and AAG heard and record perused
with their valuable assistance.

4. Perusal of record reveals that the
complainant himself lodged the report to the police
and clearly mentioned in his report that the occurrence
had occurred due to his negligence and nobody has
fired at him and he was hit on his right thigh and knee
accidently, when he was cleaning his rifle at his home.
Astonishingly, the complainant has changed his mind
after long twenty days when he recorded his statement
under section 164 Cr.P.C on 01.06.2018, wherein, he
charged the present accused/petitioner for the offence.
The injury caused to the complainant being on non-
vital part of his body needs further probe into the guilt

of present accused/petitioner by the learned trial Court
after recording evidence of the prosecution. Thus, in
view of peculiar facts and circumstances of the
present case, the role of accused/petitioner becomes
that of ‘further inquiry’ into his guilt under subsection
2 of section 497 Cr.P.C.
5. Additionally, the accused/petitioner is no
longer required to the police for the purpose of
investigation, as complete challan has been submitted
in the case; therefore, no useful purpose is going to be
served by keeping him behind the bars.
6. The observations rendered hereinabove
being tentative in nature, would not affect the mind of
the learned trial Court in any manner whatsoever,
during trial of the case
7. Consequently, this bail application is
accepted and accused-petitioner is admitted to bail,
subject to his furnishing bail bonds in the sum of
Rs.200,000/- (Rupees two lacs), with two sureties
each in the like amount, to the satisfaction of the
Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate, Dassu Kohistan.
Above are the detailed reasons of short

order of this Court of even date.
