MUHAMMAD FAHEEM WALI, J.- Through this
criminal miscellaneous petition, the petitioner has sought
special leave to appeal against the order dated 29.3.2022,
passed by learned Judicial Magistrate-I, D.I.Khan,
whereby the respondents/accused were acquitted under
Section 249-A, Cr.P.C in a complaint filed by the
petitioner under Sections 120/406/427/452/506/148/

149/161 P.P.C.

2. Arguments of learned counsel for the

petitioner heard and record perused.

3. The record reveals that the petitioner
filed a complaint under Sections 120/406/427/452/
506/148/149/161 P.P.C against the respondents/

accused. It is averred in the complaint that vide Iqrar

Nama dated 01.6.2012, he purchased land measuring
06 kanal 16 marla in the shape of plots No.1, 2, 3, 13,
14 in survey No.80 Cantt situated opposite G.P.O
Chowk, D.I.Khan from respondents No.2 to 8 for
worth consideration of Rs.03 crore 80 lac, but
thereafter by violating terms and conditions of Iqrar
Nama and in connivance with respondent No.9, they
transferred the said land in favour of respondents
No.10 to 14 through registered deed No.1510 dated
15.5.2014 and registered deed No.1799 dated

02.6.2014 and thus committed fraud with him.

4. After recording statement of the
petitioner/complainant under Section 200 Cr.P.C, the
complaint was sent to the S.H.O of Police Station
concerned for inquiry/investigation and in pursuance
thereof, the report was submitted. During proceedings
in complaint, the respondents/accused submitted an
application under Section 249-A, Cr.P.C, notice
whereof was given to the opposite side. The learned
Judicial Magistrate-I, DJI.-Khan, after hearing
arguments of learned counsel for the parties, accepted
application of the respondents/accused and acquitted
them under Section 249-A Cr.P.C vide order dated

29,3.2022, impugned herein.

5. The record reflects that earlier, the

petitioner had filed Misc. Complaint No.10 of 2018
-

-3-

against the respondents/accused regarding the same
allegations as narrated in the instant complaint. The
learned Special Judge, Anti-Corruption, Southern
Region K.P.K, Camp Court at D.I.Khan, after hearing
both the sides, dismissed the said complaint vide
order dated 24.9.2021 by invoking the provisions of
Section 203, Cr.P.C. Under the law, nobody could be
tried twice for the same offence on the basis of
maxim "nemo debt bis vexari", which means that no
person can be tried for the second time for an offence
with which he was previously charged. This principle
is fundamentally embodied in (i) section 403, Cr.P.C.,
(ii) section 26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 and
(iii) Article 13(a) of the Constitution of Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, 1973. For ready reference
these are reproduced as under:-

“Section-403, Cr.P.C. Persons once
convicted or acquitted not to be tried
for the same offence. (1) A person who
has once been tried by a Court of
competent jurisdiction for an offence
and convicted or acquitted of such
offence shall, while such conviction or
acquittal remains in force, not to be
liable to be tried again for the same
offence, nor on the same facts for any
other offence for which a different
charge from the one made against him
might have been made under section
236, or for which he might have been
convicted under section 237.

(2) A person acquitted or convicted for
any offence may be afterwards tried for
any district offence for which a separate
charge might have been made against
him on the former trial under section
-4-

235, subsection (1).

(3) A person convicted of any offence
constituted by any act causing
consequences which together with such
act, constituted a different offence from
that of which he was convicted, may be
afterwards tried for such last-mentioned
offence, if the consequence had not
happened or were not happened, or were
not known to the Court to have
happened, at the time when he was
convicted.

(4) A person acquitted or convicted of
any offence constituted by any acts
may, notwithstanding such acquittal or
conviction, be subsequently charged
with, and tried for any other offence
constituted by the same acts which he
may have committed if the Court by
which he was first tried was not
competent to try the offence with which
he is subsequently charged.

(5) Nothing in this section shall affect
the provision of section 26 of the
General Clauses Act, 1897, or section
188 of this Code.”

“Section 26 of General Clauses Act.
Offences punishable under two or
more enactments. Where an act or
omission constitutes an offence under
two or more enactments, then the
offender shall be liable to be prosecuted
and punished under either or any of
those enactments, but shall not be liable
to be punished twice for the same
offence.”

“Article 13 of the Constitution of
Pakistan. Protection against
double punishment. No person—

(a) Shall be prosecuted or punished for
the same offence more than once.

6. August Apex Court in case titled
“Sherin Bacha and others Vs. Namoos Iqbal and 3
others” reported in (PLD 1993 Supreme Court
247), while dealing in similar circumstances has held
that:-

“The Constitution and the Code of

Criminal Procedure read with General

Clauses Act do not permit the re-trial of

an offence in which a person which

having once been tried as accused

stands finally acquitted.”
7. In view of above, since the subject
matter has already been tried by the Court of
competent jurisdiction in Misc. Complaint No.10 of
2018, therefore, I am of the considered opinion that
the learned counsel for the petitioner has failed to
point out any illegality and irregularity in the
impugned order 29.3.2022 of learned trial Court
warranting interference by this Court. Accordingly,
leave refused and the instant petition for granting
special leave to file the appeal is dismissed.
Announced.
