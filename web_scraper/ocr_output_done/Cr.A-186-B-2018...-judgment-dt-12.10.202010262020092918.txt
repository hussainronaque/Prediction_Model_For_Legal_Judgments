2. Brief facts of the case are that on 21.12.2014 at 09:50
a.m the complainant Muhammad Siraj alongwith dead-body of his
brother Maraj Khan, reported the matter on the spot, to the effect
that he alongwith his brother and cousin Fakhr-e-Alam, were busy in
the construction of warkha/vial, meanwhile, at about 09:30 a.m.
accused/ appellant Jahangir Khan, duly armed with Kalashnikov,
appeared and started altercation with his brother Maraj Khan, and
forthwith started firing at him, as a result of which he was hit,
sustained injuries and fell down, while the accused decamped from
the spot. When he attended his brother, he was dead. The motive
was a dispute over the warkha/vial. Nabi Shah Inspector, reduced
the report of complainant in shape of murasila Ex: PA, which was
later on culminated into above-mentioned F.LR Ex: PW 3/1. On
completion of investigation the complete challan was submitted
against the accused/appellant before the learned trial Court, who
after complying with provision under section 265-C Cr.P.C,
formally charge-sheeted the accused/ appellant to which he pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution in order to substantiate
its charge against the accused, produced and examined as many as
nine (9) witnesses, whereafter, statement of accused was recorded
under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he professed his innocence. He
opted to record his statement on oath as provided under section
340(2) Cr.P.C and produced defence witnesses. Learned trial Court
after hearing arguments of learned counsel for the parties, vide
impugned judgment dated 19.10.2018, convicted the accused and

sentenced him as mentioned above. Feeling aggrieved the convict/
-3-

appellant has filed the instant criminal appeal, while the complainant
moved criminal revision petition for enhancement of his sentence.

3. The learned counsel for the parties alongwith
Additional Advocate-General were heard at length and with their
valuable assistance the record was gone through.

4. The incident occurred on 21.12.2014, at 09:30 a.m.
when the complainant alongwith the deceased and eyewitness were
busy in their construction work on the spot, where the convict/
appellant emerged from his house situated towards north, altercated

with the deceased followed by firing, which hit the deceased, who

LD to the ground and died on the spot.
5. True, that in the episode, single accused is charged

with no previous blood-feud, equally true that substitution in case of
single accused is a rear phenomenon, but that alone cannot absolve
the Courts of law of their liability to assess and reassess the
available material on file to reach a just and proper conclusion in
order to avoid injustice to either side. The record tells that the matter
was promptly reported by the complainant to the local police who
arrived to the spot and that the occurrence besides the complainant
was also witnessed by the eyewitness, but this alone is not sufficient,
rather the trial Court as well as this Court is under the bounden duty
to ascertain as to whether the incident in issue occurred in the mode
and manner as presented.

6. The incident occurred on 21.12.2014 at 09:30 a.m. and
the matter was reported to the scribe, who attracted to the spot after
receiving information. It is for the complainant to establish his

presence on the spot and to tell that why the dead body was not
-4-

taken either to the hospital or to the local police station to register
the case and that why they kept on waiting till arrival of the local
police to the spot, despite presence of the complainant and
eyewitness at the time of incident no efforts were made to approach
the local Police Station to register the case, rather the complainant
kept on waiting till the police arrived. The complainant was
examined as PW-6, who stated that he alongwith the eyewitness was
present and busy in the construction work and the deceased was
busy to supply bricks, when the convict/appellant attracted to the
spot and killed the deceased. He further stated that soon after the
incident the appellant decamped from the spot, but he failed to
explain that why no efforts were made to shift the dead-body either
to the hospital or to the concerned Police Station for registration of
case. This witness was cross-examined on this particular aspect of
the case but he failed to explain that what precluded them from
approaching the local police of Police Station Basia Khel. The
explanation he tendered is not only unsatisfactory but abnormal as
well, as he stated that soon after the incident the nearby people
attracted to the spot to whom he asked as what to do and how to
transport the dead-body. The complainant was asked regarding the
availability of transport both in the village and at the place of
incident, to which he replied in negative. He explained that neither
the Datsun could be arranged nor the Rikshaws were available
which led them to wait till arrival of the police. The scribe was
examined as PW-5, who stated that at the relevant time he was
present near Akram Durrani College, when he received information

from Police Station Basia Khel, regarding the incident and on
-5-

receiving the information he left for the spot. He further stated that
while on gasht he had police nafri, but when leaving for the spot he
retained only three, whereas rest of them were sent to the Police
Station. This witness explained that on reaching to the spot, he found
the complainant alongwith the eyewitness present there, whereas the
dead-body of the deceased was lying on the spot. PW-6 stated that
he prepared the injury sheet, inquest report followed by murasila,
sensing the danger he in the same breath changed the sequence and
stated that the murasila was prepared first followed by the injury
sheet and inquest report. The dead-body was sent to the hospital but
neither the complainant nor the eyewitness accompanied the same
and when the complainant was cross-examined that why he did not
accompany the dead-body to the hospital, he replied that he and the
eyewitness were asked to stay on the spot till arrival of the
Investigating Officer, but neither the Investigating Officer nor the
scribe confirmed their this stance. It surprises that a real brother
despite his presence on the spot did not accompany the dead-body of
his younger brother to the hospital, which gives an impression that
the complainant was not present on the spot and that the dead-body
was shifted to the hospital by the people present there. His presence
is further doubted when the dead-body was identified by the
identifiers who hailed from a different village lying at a distance of
3/4 kilometers from the spot, who too are the close relatives of the
deceased. The complainant stated that on arrival of the scribe only
he and the eyewitness were present on the spot, but he could not tell
that how the identifiers reached to the spot and identified the dead-

body before the police and that who informed them regarding the
-6-

incident, puts a question-mark on the veracity of the complainant
and on his presence on the spot.

7. The complainant was examined as PW-06, who stated
that on the day of incident he alongwith Fakhr-e-Alam and the
deceased were busy in constructing of a vial (warkha) and that for
the purpose material including bricks were brought and lying on the
spot. He further stated that they did not take the help of a mason and
labourers for the purpose as they were intending to construct it by
themselves. There is no denial to the fact that the complainant used
to run a mobile shop and the deceased was a student during the days
of occurrence and both were lacking the expertise to construct, so it
surprises that why the experts (masons) were not hired for the
purpose. The Investigating Officer was examined as PW-8, who
stated that on arrival to the spot, he did not notice bricks, shingle etc.
to be used for construction. This conflict between the two creates a
dent in the prosecution case, as the purpose of his presence on the
spot is not established. We cannot ignore that the deceased was a
student of tender age with no direct motive with the
convict/appellant, then what led the appellant to kill the deceased
and leave the two, who were falling in the way while approaching
the deceased. This aspect of the case creates doubt regarding
presence of the complainant and the eyewitness on the spot at the
time of incident.

In case titled “Muhammad Saleem Vs. the State”

(2010 SCMR 374), it is held that:

“General rule is that statement of a witness

must be in consonance witness the

-7-

probabilities fitting in the circumstances of the
case and also inspires confidence in the mind
of a reasonable and prudent person. If these
element are present, then the statement of a
worst enemy of the accused can be accepted
and relied upon without corroboration but if
these elements are missing then the statement
of a pious man can be rejected without section
thought...applying the test to the pros
witnesses, we find that their statements do not
come within the ambit of above rule of
acceptance of evidence, therefore, no implicit
reliance can be placed on such type of
evidence without any corroboration which is

lacking in the present case.”

8. The manner in which the convict/appellant was
arrested gives a new twist to the prosecution case when the scribe
stated that on arrival to the spot the matter was reported by the
complainant and after doing the needful he went after the accused to
his house, when he reached near the house, the accused came out
and started running who was chased and after a hot pursuit was
arrested, the Kalashnikov was taken into possession and murasila
was drafted on the spot which led to registration of F.ILR No. 591
dated 21.12.2014 under section 15 Arms Act of Police Station Basia
Khel. It is interesting to note that while drafting the murasila in
respect of the arrest and recovery of the Kalashnikov, the scribe/
complainant inserted explanation that the accused is also required in
case F.LR No. 590 under section 302 P.P.C dated 21.12.2014, Police
Station Basia Khel. We are surprised to see that how the

complainant came to know that an F.I.R bearing No.590 has already

-8-

been registered, as the time of occurrence and drafting of murasila
under Section 15 Arms Act was 10:30 a.m, whereas FIR No.590 was
registered at 10:50 a.m. The conduct of the S.H.O (scribe) is not
above board, rather he went on a conscious attempt to help the
prosecution that too at the cost of the appellant. We are yet to see as
to whether the convict/appellant was arrested in the manner as
mentioned in F.IL.R No.591 or that PW-5 was telling a lie, this is
interesting to note that the appellant after his arrest was produced
before the doctor who found multiple injuries on his body, the said
doctor was examined as DW-1, whose examination in chief is
reproduced for ready reference. “On 22.12.2014, at 01:35 p.m.
accused Jehangir Khan was produced before me by the
Investigating Officer of the present case, for obtaining his fitness
certificate about his custody. On examination I found wounds on
his both knees subcutaneous hematoma on lower leg and
abdominal tenderness. I have mention my observation on his
judicial remand paper already exhibited as Ex::PW8/3, while my
observations are written on its corner, which correctly bears my
signature and are in my head writing and are Ex: DW 1/1.” This
witness was cross-examined, who stated in his cross-examination,
“subcutaneous hematoma means small blood clots immediately
under the skin. There is no blood on the person of the accused,
however, his clothes were crushed and besmeared with dust.” The
appellant, right from beginning, attempted hard to bring on record
his plea to which we cannot close our eyes, it beings with an
application submitted to the Deputy Inspector General of Police for

fair investigation in the matter where he took the plea of his

-9-

innocence. The statement of accused under section 342 Cr.P.C was
recorded, where he opted to be examined on oath and also to
produce defence witnesses. While recording his statement under
section 340(2) Cr.P.C, he explained that on the day of occurrence at
about 08:30 a.m, he in routine started for his bargain center on his
motorbike, when he reached at the corner of the mosque near the
main road, he saw Muhammad Saeed, Abidullah and Ziad Khan,
duly armed with Kalashnikovs while Fakhar-e-Alam was armed
with pistol, Shahid Rehman, Saif ur Rehman and Meraj were busy in
demolishing the “Warkha”, he requested them to stop demolishing
until the matter was resolved which annoyed them and they started
beating him with their weapons etc, they broke his spectacles and
torn his clothes when in the meanwhile, Muhammad Saeed made a
fire which hit the deceased who fell on the ground. He further stated
that the co-villagers namely Dil Fayyaz Khan, Noor Qadir, Rahm
Subkhan, Umar Shad and others attracted to the spot and rescued
him from the hands of the accused and to save his life, so he was
taken inside the hujra of one Hazrat Bilal. Though the accused tried
their best to broke open the door but the villagers resisted and they
could not succeed and these were the villagers who informed the
SHO of police station Basia Khel, who arrived to the spot after
30/40 minutes of the occurrence and took him into custody from the
hujra empty-handed. The appellant also produced one Dil Fayyaz
Khan son of Bahadur Khan as DW-2, who also supported the
version of the accused/appellant. Though the SHO has clung to his
stance reported vide case F.I.R No.591, but yet we are to thrash out

as to which of the versions is correct. Though the accused has been

-10-

shown arrested by Nabbi Shah Khan S.I, but while preparing his
card of arrest, he did not mention the injuries on his person and the
condition of his clothes. It was then when the accused/appellant was
examined by the doctor, who found multiple blunt injuries on his
body with torn/crushed clothes, but the conduct of Nabbi Shah Khan
SI tells mala fide on his part. As all the three came forward with
their own version, so we deem it appropriate to place all i.e. the
statement of accused recorded under section 340(2) Cr.P.C, that of
the complainant and the S.H.O of the concerned Police Station in
juxtaposition, in order to know as to whether it was the complainant,
the S.H.O or the appellant who was telling the truth.

9. The overall situation attaches great importance to the
plea of the accused which he took at the earliest. The record tells
that on 25.12.2014, the convict/appellant submitted an application
under section 22-A(6) Cr.P.C before the Ex-Officio Justice of Peace
which was turned down vide order dated 25.01.2015, feeling
aggrieved, the accused/appellant approached this Court through a
writ petition, but the same did not succeed and was dismissed vide
judgment dated 12.01.2016, when the appellant was knocked out by
this Court, he then opted to file a criminal complaint under section
200, Cr.P.C. before the trial Court, where a reply was sought from
the S.H.O concerned and finally the complaint was dismissed vide
order dated 13.10.2016, which was assailed through a revision
petition which too met the same fate on 18.01.2017. It was argued
that when the plea of the appellant was turned down by the
competent Courts of law, could it be taken into consideration to

benefit the convict/appellant, we do not find ourselves in agreement

-ll-

with the learned counsel, as this Court is yet to see as to which of the
theories is more probable, we cannot deny the efforts of the
appellant to bring on record his plea and even he ran the risk to be
examined under section 340(2) Cr.P.C and to produce defence
witnesses, knowing the fact that he and his witnesses were to stand
the test of cross-examination.

10. There is no denial to the fact that the appellant is
directly charged for the murder of the deceased and that the accused
was arrested from near the place of occurrence alongwith a
Kalashnikov used in the incident which matched with the recovered
empties, but yet the prosecution is lagging behind to convince this
Court regarding the mode and manner of the incident. Though the
complainant struggled hard to establish his presence on the spot, but
at the same time, we cannot say goodbye to the plea taken by the
appellant, at the earliest. We are confident that all the three i.e. the
S.H.O, who arrested the appellant, the complainant and the appellant
have suppressed the true facts, but we are to apply our judicial mind
to the attending circumstances of the case, while doing so, we reach
to an inescapable conclusion that out of the three, it is the appellant
whose plea is nearer to the truth, however, we a little disagree with
his stance that it was the fire shot of one Muhammad Saeed which
went effective. We feel no hesitation to hold that it was from the fire
shot of the convict/appellant that the deceased got hit and died, but
the injuries on person of the appellant and his torn clothes belie what
the SHO (PW-5) stated. We while appreciating the evidence, have
reached to the safest conclusion that the incident occurred when the

parties were engaged in a free fight, which resulted into the death of

-12-

the deceased and to injuries on person of the appellant, we are
confirmed in our mind that the deceased was never the target.

In case titled “Abdur _Rehman_alias_Boota_and
another Vs the State and another” (2011 SCMR 34), it is held that:

“8. In the interest of justice and fair play
we have also re-examined the evidence on
record with the assistance of the learned
counsel of the parties and come to the same
conclusion after re-appraisal of the evidence
that eye witnesses were not present on the
spot, therefore, the learned High Court was
justified to ignore their statements. The
convict was convicted in terms of his
statement under section 342 Cr.P.C,
therefore, the learned High Court was
justified to alter the conviction of the convict
from under section 302(b) P.P.C to section
302(c) P.P.C. It is settled principle of law
that statement of the accused has to be
accepted or rejected as a whole when entire
prosecution evidence disbelieved as the
eyewitnesses were not present at the spot,
then conviction under section 302(b) P.P.C
altered to section 302(c) P.P.C and sentence
of death awarded by trial Court was reduced
to 14 years R.I. by learned High Court was
not against the law laid down by this court in

various pronouncements.”

11. We have before us the legality of the awarded sentence
and we are to thrash it out as to whether the sentence awarded will
meet the ends of justice. The overall impact of what has been stated

above, leads us nowhere, but to hold that the occurrence was the

-13-

result of free fight and that both the sides twisted the facts to their
benefit, hence, in such eventuality the quantum of sentence calls for
interference, resultantly, we partially allow this appeal by altering
the conviction awarded to the appellant under Section 302(b) P.P.C
to one under Section 302(c) P.P.C and the appellant is convicted and
sentenced to ten years R.I. Needless to mention that the amount of
compensation awarded to the legal heirs under section 544-A,
Cr.P.C. shall remain intact. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. is
extended in favour of the convict/appellant. However, criminal

revision No.49-B of 2018, stands dismissed.
