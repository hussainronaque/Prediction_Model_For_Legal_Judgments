Tajamul/Ps* (SB) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Rigorous imprisonment for 01 year with fine of
Rs.100,000/-, in case of default he was directed to
undergo further 01-month R.I.

Benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C was extended to
both the convicts.

Z. Precise facts of the case are that complainant
Shah Said (PW-3), while present in front of vegetable
market (Sabzi Mandi) Mingora on 14.07.2021, received
spy information that a motorcar, having three persons
onboard and containing huge quantity of narcotics, had
been parked on the roadside Raja Abad near Janazgah.
Consequent upon the tipoff, complainant picked up with
him Fahim Khan ASI (PW-S5) and other police officials
present in People Chowk on patrol duty and rushed to the
spot. On arrival there, police found the motorcar having
been parked on the right side of road wherein appellants
Mehboob Ali and Rafayun had occupied the driver seat
and front passenger seats respectively whereas their co-
accused Sohail Khan (acquitted) was sitting on the rear
. seat of the motorcar from which they were deboarded.
During body search of appellant Mehboob Ali, a holster
around his waist was recovered from him which contained
30 bore pistol bearing No. R7178 with spare magazine and
25 rounds whereas Methamphetamine (Ice) was recovered
from his right side pocket. Similarly, a plastic bag

containing Ice was recovered from the right-side pocket of

Tajemuys*| (5.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justten Muhammad Naeem Anwar
appellant Rafayun during his body search. During search
of the motorcar, a sack of flour of white colour, containing
08 packets of chars wrapped with yellow tape, was
recovered from the recessed area of stepney inside the
trunk. When separately weighed through a digital scale, the
Ice recovered from possession of appellant Mehboob Ali
came out of 750 grams whereas weight of the Ice
recovered from appellant Rafayun became known as 783
grams. The packets of chars were found of 1017, 1050,
1047, 1014, 1028, 1030, 1019 and 1026 total 8231 grams.
Appellant Mehboob Ali could not produce license
regarding the pistol, which was sealed in Parcel No.1.
Samples of 01 gram each from the recovered Ice whereas
samples of 05 grams each were separated from the packets
of chars and sealed in Parcels No. 02 to 11. The remaining
Ice 749 grams were sealed in Parcel No.12, the remaining
Ice 782 grams were sealed in Parcel No.13 whereas the
remaining chars weighing 8191 grams containing 08
packets were sealed in Parcel No. 14. The motorcar was
also taken into possession and joint recovery memo in
respect of the aforesaid recoveries was prepared on the
spot. The appellants and their co-accused were arrested
and the case was reported against them through Murasila

which was sent through ASI Fahim Khan (PW-5) to P.S

Tafamul/PS* {$.8) Hon'ble Mz, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Mingora, where FIR (Ex.PW-2/1) was registered against

all the accused.

3. After completion of investigation, complete
challan was submitted before the Court for trial of the
appellants and their co-accused. Formal charge was framed
against them to which they did not plead guilty and
claimed trial. In order to substantiate the allegations
against the accused, prosecution produced and examined
08 witnesses and closed the evidence. Thereafter,
statements of the accused were recorded u/s 342, Cr.P.C
wherein they pleaded innocence and claimed to have been
charged in a false case, however, they neither recorded
their own statements on oath in terms of section 340(2),
Cr.P.C nor produced any witness in their defence. On
conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court vide impugned
judgment acquitted co-accused Sohail Khan whereas
convicted and sentenced the present appellants, the detail
of which has already been given in the earlier portion of

this judgment, hence, these appeals.

Is

Arguments heard and record perused.

Ita

The case of prosecution against the present
appellants is that police have recovered total 8231 grams
of chars containing eight packets from the trunk of an

unregistered/non-custom paid (NCP) motorcar wherein

Tapemurrese| (5.8) Hon‘ble Mr. tustice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
appellant Mehboob Ali was seated on the driving seat at
the time of recovery whereas 750 grams of Ice were
recovered from his right-side pocket. Complainant has also
claimed recovery of 783 grams of Ice from the pocket of
appellant Rafayun who was seated in the front seat of the
car. As per prosecution version, the samples of 01 gram
each from the recovered Ice were sealed in Parcel Nos. 2 &
3 whereas samples of 05 grams each separated from the
packets of chars were sealed in Parcel Nos. 4 to ll, as
such, total 10 parcels were sent to FSL for chemical
analysis. The FSL report in this regard is available on
record as Ex.PW-7/10 which is positive for Ice and chars
qua the samples in the respective parcels. It is by now
settled law that in narcotics cases, conviction of an accused
cannot be based only on the matching FSL report unless
and until the chain of safe custody and safe transmission of
the samples of recovered contraband right from the time of
recovery till delivery thereof in the Forensic Lab is
established. The completeness of this chain of custody is of
utmost importance and any break therein or lapse in the
control of possession of the samples would be sufficient to
create a doubt regarding safe custody and safe transmission
of the samples. In such eventuality, reliability of the

positive FSL report qua the samples loses its value and

Tapmul/rst| (5.8) Hon'ble Mr. tustice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
cannot be relied upon for conviction of accused. The
significance of the chain of safe custody and secured
transmission of the samples has been highlighted by
Hon’ble Supreme Court in a number of cases. In the case

titled “The State through Regional Director ANF VA.
Imam_Bakhsh_and_others” (2018 SCMR 2039) the

Hon’ble apex Court observed that the chain of custody
begins with the recovery of the seized drug by the Police
and includes the separation of the representative sample(s)
of the seized drug and their dispatch to the Narcotics
Testing Laboratory; this chain of custody is pivotal as the
entire construct of the Act and the Rules rests on the
Report of the Government Analyst, which in turn rests on
the process of sampling and its safe and secure custody and
transmission to the laboratory. Thus, the rule laid down by
the Hon’ble apex Court in this regard is that the
prosecution is bound to establish that the chain of custody
of the samples was unbroken, unsuspicious, indubitable,
safe and secure. Whether that onus has been discharged by
prosecution in the present case in accordance with the
aforesaid settled principle or not, is the first question which
needs resolution by this Court in light of the evidence

available on record.

Tajamul/PS° (8.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
6. I have carefully gone through the statements of
the Seizing Officer namely Shah Said ASHO (PW-3) and
other prosecution witnesses but none of them have
explained in their examination-in-chief that who had
brought the samples to police station and when and to
whom the same were handed over for safe custody. The
record shows that AS] Fahim Khan (PW-5) had taken only
Murasila, card of arrest and recovery memo to police
station but his statement is silent regarding the case
property rather ASI Afzal Hussain (PW-2), to whom the
above documents were handed over by PW-5, frankly
admitted that alongwith Murasila neither case property nor
the accused had been produced before him. Constable
Farman Ali (PW-6), who is carrier of the samples to FSL,
in response to a question in his cross-examination, stated
that the parcels were lying with Moharrir in his office.
Madad Moharrir Barkat Ali appeared in the witness box as
PW-8 and recorded his statement only to the extent of
handing over the samples to constable Farman Ali and did
not utter a single word in his examination-in-chief that the
samples had been given to him by Seizing Officer for safe
custody. He stated in his cross-examination that he had
collected the parcels from Malkhana but admitted that he

was not incharge of Malkhana meaning thereby that the

Tajarnul/Ps* {5.8} Mon‘ble Mr. justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
samples had not been entrusted to him for safe custody.
Thus, if it be presumed that the samples had been kept in
Malkhana even then it is shrouded in mystery that who
was responsible for safe custody of the samples.
Obviously, neither name of the Muharrir or incharge of the
Malkhana, to whom the samples had been handed over,
can be ascertained from the entire record nor prosecution
has examined him before the trial Court for confirmation
of safe custody of the samples. Even neither copy of the
relevant page of Register No.19 is available on record nor
original thereof was produced before the Court to prove
that the case property had ever been kept in Malkhana.
Hence, the chain of safe custody of samples since the time
of separation thereof from the contraband on 14.07.2021
till handing over the same to carrier (PW-6) on 15.07.2021
is broken which has vitiated reliability and conclusiveness
of the FSL report. Further guidance is sought from “Zafar

Khan and another Vs. State” (PLJ 2022 SC (Cr.C.) 131),

“Abdul Ghani_and_others Vs. The State and others”

(2019 SCMR 608) and “Usman Shah Vs. The State”

(2022 YLR 821 Peshawar).

vA Another glaring disparity in the present case is

emerging from the number of parcels containing the

samples sent to the Forensic Lab. According to FIR,

Tpamut/Ps+| (5.8) Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
recovery memo and transit receipt (Ex.PW-8/1), which
was placed on file through an application after 16 months
of the delivery of samples, total 10 parcels had been
prepared regarding the samples on the spot; two pertaining
to Ice while Parcel Nos. 4 to 11 were containing the
samples of 08 packets of chars but it is astonishing that
constable Farman Ali (PW-6) had carried only 04 parcels
to FSL. The first few lines of his examination-in-chief are

worth perusal.

“Stated that on 15.07.2021 Bakht Ali (Barkat Ali) Muharrir
Investigation of Police Station Mingora handed over me
four_parcels containing 05/05-gram chars and 01/01 ICE
along with copy of FIR, application alongwith transit receipt
for taking the same to FSL Laboratory”.

(Emphasis supplied and the name in parenthesis added)

In cross-examination he further clarified the
number of parcels he had carried to FSL by replying the
questions that:

“

Moharrir of the PS handed over to me only four parcels
at 08:30 a.m. These parcels were given to me in shopping

bag. Self-stated these four parcels were wrapped in white
clothes affixed with seals........ The four parcels were
lying with the Moharrir in his office room i.e., Roznam

Cha office, wherein he handed over the same to me”.

(Emphasis supplied)

It is copiously clear from the above statement of
PW-6 that he had taken only four parcels containing
samples of the recovered contraband whereas the report

has been received about 10 samples. The mentioned

Tofamuy/Ps+| {5.8} Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

-10-

disparity floating on the surface of record creates a serious
doubt regarding genuineness of the samples and FSL
report more particularly when the transit receipt was
placed on file at a belated stage without any plausible
reason. It is also reflected from record that application to
Chemical Examiner of the Forensic Laboratory was moved
by Seizing Officer though it was not his job at all when he
had already parted with the case after making pointation of
the place of recovery to I.O. When confronted with the
application, the Seizing Officer stated that he had
forwarded the application to FSL with his signature. The
application, available at Page 124 of the record, bears the
words sil 43 at the foot, therefore, only the
Investigating Officer was authorized to forward the
application with his own signature and the Seizing Officer
had nothing to do with it as he had already completed his
job.

8. The record further shows that body search of the
appellants and their acquitted co-accused was conducted
by the Seizing Officer on the spot and except recovery of
Ice from the pockets of the present appellants, nothing else
was shown recovered from their possession. He stated in
his examination that during body search of the accused, he

had never recovered any wallet, mobiles or cash from their

Tajamutfess| (S.8) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Natem Anwar
-ll-

possession, therefore, did not mention the same in the
recovery memo. The record shows that appellant Mehboob
Ali belongs to Tehsil Matta whereas the remaining two
accused Rafayun and Sohail Khan hail from Peshawar.
Two accused had travelled to District Swat from far off
area i.e., Peshawar whereas appellant Mehboob Ali though
hailed from Swat but his abode was in Teshsil Matta away
from Mingora. It is beyond comprehension that they were
not carrying a single penny with them though staying far
away from their homes and their routine transactions with
shops, hotels, petrol/CNG pumps etc. were dependent on
cash payment. The above version of the Seizing Officer
regarding non-recovery of cash from the appellants and
their co-accused raises the eyebrow. A suggestion was put
to him regarding recovery of Rs.28,000/- from one of the
appellants, which he refuted. His falsity becomes apparent
supposedly at subsequent stage after shifting the accused to
Police Station when their body search was again conducted
and recovery of two mobile sets with driving license from
appellant Mehboob Ali, one mobile set from appellant
Refayun whereas recovery of two mobile sets were shown
from acquitted co-accused Sohail Khan through recovery
memo Ex.PW-4/1. It is pertinent to mention here that SIM

numbers found inside the mobile phones of the accused

Tajamul/Ps?| (5.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Tajamuy/es+| {S.8) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

-12-

have duly been mentioned in the heading of Murasila as
well as in their card of arrest prepared on the spot as per
Seizing Officer. When no mobile phone, as per statement
of the Seizing Officer, had been recovered from the
accused on the spot from what source he had confirmed
their SIM numbers and entered the same in Murasila and
card of arrest there and then. This situation leads this Court
to the conclusion that Murasila, card of arrest and recovery
memos had been prepared in the police station, as such, on
the same ratio the status of the subsequent proceedings of
investigation has also become doubtful. It is settled law
that slightest doubt, which occurs in prosecution case is
sufficient to acquit accused. It has been held by superior
Court umpteenth times that for extending benefit of doubt,
it is not necessary that there should be many circumstances
creating doubts rather a single circumstance, creating
reasonable doubt in prudent mind about guilt of accused
makes him entitled to its benefit, not as a matter of grace

or concession but as a matter of right. Rel: “Mst. Asia Bibi

Vs. The State and others” (PLD 2019 S.C 64), “Tariq

Pervaiz Vs. The State” (1995 SCMR 1345) and “Ayub

Masih Vs. The State” PLD 2002 SC 1048”.

9. In addition to the above-mentioned legal

infirmities in handling the samples and process of
-13-

investigation, important witnesses of prosecution have not
supported each other in their respective statements on
material particulars of the recovery in light whereof
various doubts arise regarding the mode and manner of
recovery of narcotics as reported in the present case. It is
the version of Seizing Officer in FIR that he had received
spy information with regard to suspected motorcar near
Janazgaah when he was present in front of vegetables/
fruits market from where he rushed towards the spot by
picking up ASI Fahim Khan and other police officials from
People Chowk but ASI Fahim Khan (PW-5) stated in
cross-examination that he had met the Seizing Officer near
fruits Market. In Murasila/FIR, appellant Mehboob Ali
was shown on driving seat of the motorcar, appellant
Rafayun on the front seat whereas acquitted co-accused
Sohail Khan was mentioned seated in the rear seat but
Seizing Officer stated that Rafayun was on the rear seat of
motorcar. When confronted with non-mentioning of the
mobile Datsun as well as driver and gunner Altaf Hussain
in the site plan, Seizing Officer stated that he had left the
mobile van at some distance whereas driver and gunner
were present there for security of the official vehicle. ASI
Fahim Khan narrated some other story in his cross

examination that on their arrival to spot, the Seizing

Tajamul/Ps* (8.8) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Talamul/Ps* (5.8) Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

-14-

Officer touched the motorcar; opened the door thereof and
by that time they also deboarded from the mobile Datsun
meaning thereby that the vehicle had been taken to the spot
but same was not shown in the site plan nor the driver and
gunner were given any point. It was noted in Murasila and
site plan that the motorcar, from which the contraband was
recovered, had no registration number and_ similar
statement was recorded by Seizing Officer but Fahim Khan
ASI belied him by stating that the motorcar was having
registration No. AE-1226. According to contents of
Murasila, the chars had been recovered from a white color
sack but the sack produced before the Court was found
green in colour. Fahim Khan ASI, while carrying Murasila
from the spot, had reached the P.S at 09:45 hours whereas
Seizing Officer had shown his arrival to P.S from the spot
at 09:25 hours. Arrival of the Seizing Officer to P.S prior
from ASI Fahim Khan, entrusted with the duty of carrying
Murasila, is an irrational and illogical phenomenon
appearing in the present case. While replying another
question, the Seizing Officer, in utter disagreement with
his earlier version, stated that he had reached the P.S after
02 hours and 30 minutes after departure of Fahim Khan
ASI. If the latter version of the Seizing Officer be accepted

as true, his first arrival to P.S from the spot was 12:30
-15-

hours but his that version is also belied by his subsequent
version according to which he had showed the time of his
departure with LO for spot pointation as 10:40 hours.
Similar contradictions are visible in the statements of
Seizing Officer and I.O0 qua the times of their joint
departure from the P.S to Spot for pointation and their
arrival back to P.S. The Seizing Officer stated that he and
1.0 had proceeded to the spot alone but on the other hand
stated that IO had recorded statements of investigation
staff on the spot which fact was negated by 1.0 by stating
that he had examined no one during the spot inspection.
Similar variations can be found in the statement of Seizing
Officer, Fahim Khan ASI and contents of Murasila
regarding the mode and manner of deboarding and
conducting body search of the accused and direction of the
motorcar of the accused at the relevant time. Fahim Khan
ASI was confronted with his statement u/s 161, Cr.P.C
wherein he had mentioned the kind of contraband as heroin
though narcotic of the same nature does not appear in the
recovery memo and FIR. The kind of motorcar has been
mentioned ‘G’ in the first paragraph of site plan but
thereafter two times it was mentioned as ‘X’. The above
contradictions in the statements of PWs suggest that a

concocted story was structured against the appellants. No

Tajamul/Ps* {S.B) Hon'ble Mr. lustice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
-16-

doubt, it is settled principle of law that minor
contradictions in the statements of witnesses do creep with
passage of time and can be ignored for safe administration
of justice, however, disagreement of the PWs in their
deposition on almost each and every fact of the occurrence
can be considered for testing their credibility and integrity.
In the present case, not only the Seizing Officer has
recorded a self-contradictory statement but most of his
assertions have not been confirmed by the remaining PWs.
Thus, the statements recorded by the witnesses in the
present case neither ring true nor appear to be natural,
hence, cannot be considered for conviction of the

appellant.

10. Summing up the above discussion, the
prosecution case is suffering from inherent infirmities and
inconsistency of very glaring nature creating serious
doubts in mind regarding the guilt of appellants. The
learned trial Court has convicted both the appellants by
taking into consideration only the contents of FIR and
recovery memo without touching the remaining
contradictory and inconsistent statements of the
prosecution witnesses. Trial is a structured process where
the facts of a case are presented before the Court in support

of which witnesses are produced and examined by

Tajamuljes+| (S.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
-17-

prosecution. It is the duty of trial Judge to analyse the facts
of the case so presented in juxtaposition with the
statements of witnesses. Any conclusion drawn by trial
Court only on the basis of facts without proper appraisal of
evidence on record is a wrong approach against the settled
principles for administration of justice. The impugned
Judgment is result of non-reading of evidence on record,
hence, needs reversal in the circumstances. Resultantly,
instant appeal Cr.A No. 276-M/2022 as well as the
connected Cr.A No. 300-M/ 2022 are allowed, the
impugned judgment to the extent of conviction and
sentences of appellants Meboob Ali and Rafayun is set
aside and they are acquitted of the charge levelled against
them in the present case. They be released forthwith from
jail, if not already released, provided their detention in jail

is no more required in connection with some other case.
