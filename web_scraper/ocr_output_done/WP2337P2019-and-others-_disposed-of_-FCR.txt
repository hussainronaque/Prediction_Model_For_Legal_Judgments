JUDGMENT

SYED ARSHAD ALI, J:- This consolidated judgment is
directed to dispose of instant petition as well as the connected
petitions as adjudication of common questions of law are
involved.
2. We have before us four categories of cases. The
first category of the cases relates to those matters, which were
filed before the erstwhile FATA Tribunal under Section 55-A
of the Frontier Crimes Regulation, 1901 (“FCR”) and
pursuant to the judgment of this Court dated 20.03.2019
passed in Reference No. 01-P/2019, the same were referred to
this Court (the detailed list of this category of cases has been
provided in Annexure “A” to this Judgment and hereinafter
referred to as First Category of Cases)

In the second category, we have one case Le.
Khial Gul vs. Khan Gul, who was convicted by the Political
Agent vide order and sentence dated 14.12.2016. The said
conviction was challenged by Khial Gul before the
Commissioner Kohat Division Kohat, however, later, the said
appeal was transferred to this court pursuant to the judgment

dated 20.03.2019 in Reference No. 01-P/2019 (Hereinafter
2
referred to as the Second Category of Cases and the details

whereof are also provided in Annexure “A”’).

The third category of cases relates to the matter
where the offence was committed prior to the promulgation of
the 25" Amendment in the Constitution, however, no final
judgment was passed by the trial Court under the FCR though
the matter was referred to the Jirga and the Jirga had also
given its verdict regarding the guilt or otherwise of the
accused. On promulgation of the 25" amendment in the
Constitution and pursuant to the judgment of this Court dated
20.03.2019 in Reference No. 01-P/2019 those cases were
transferred for adjudication to the regular courts and the
regular courts in the majority of cases had acquitted the
accused as the prosecution had failed to produce any evidence
(Hereinafter referred to as the Third Category of Cases the
details whereof are also provided in Annexure “A”).

The fourth category is those cases in which the
initial trial under Section 8 of the FCR relating to the civil
dispute culminated into the final judgment by the Political
Agent. They had filed an appeal against the order of the
Political Agent, which was transferred to the court of the
District Judge pursuant to the judgment of this Court in
Reference No. 01-P/2019, and the District Judge had passed
an order in those cases, and the orders of the District Judge are
now questioned before this Court (Hereinafter referred to as
the Fourth Category of Cases the details whereof are also
provided in Annexure “A”’).

3. We have before us for adjudication the legal
issue, which cropped up on promulgation of the 25"
Amendment in the Constitution through Act No. XXXVII of
2018 dated 05.06.2018. Through the 25" Amendment in the
Constitution, inter alia, Article 247 of the Constitution was
omitted. Article 247 (3) of the Constitution dealt with the
extension of laws passed by Parliament to the Federally

Administered Tribal Area (“FATA”). The erstwhile Articles
3
246 & 247 of the Constitution had provided for a legal

dispensation in the tribal area. Article 247(4) of the
Constitution envisages that the President may, with respect to
any matter, make regulations for peace and good government
in FATA or any part thereof. In view of the above, a good
number of laws were extended to the erstwhile FATA and
similarly, the President of Pakistan had also made/issued
various regulations for maintaining peace in the erstwhile
FATA.

The FCR was the governing law relating to

resolution of civil as well as criminal dispute among the tribal
men within the meaning of Articles 268 and 247 of the
Constitution.
4. On the omission of Article 247 of the
Constitution, the Parliament has passed no law relating to the
pending proceedings in the erstwhile tribal area before the
various fora established under FCR. However, the corollary of
omission of Article 247 of the Constitution, all the normal
laws passed by the Federal and Provincial legislature
including the establishment of various courts automatically
stood extended to erstwhile FATA as the essential barrier
contained in Article 247 ibid was removed through 25"
amendment Act in the Constitution.

It would be important to note that through Section
34 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1963, the FCR
except for its application to the tribal area was repealed.
However, since under erstwhile Article 247 of the
Constitution, the jurisdiction of the superior courts was barred
to entertain any matter relating to erstwhile FATA, therefore,
the legality of the FCR to the extent of its application to
FATA was never examined on the touchstone of the
Constitution by the Apex Court. However, it was never
considered a good law and, in this regard, the following

reference can be borrowed from the judgment of the Apex
4
Court in the case of Samundar ys. The Crown_ (PLD 1954 SC
228) wherein it was held that:

“The process of decision provided under the
Regulation (FCR) is also foreign to justice as
administered by the Courts... Decisions of this
nature are common enough on the administrative
side, but they are obnoxious to all recognized
modern principles governing the dispensation of
justice. In such circumstances, it is impossible to
preserve public confidence in the justness of the
decision. That may be of secondary importance to
an administrative agency. But it is of permanent
importance to a Court of justice.....

I am therefore clearly of the opinion that the
proceedings which have been taken in the present
cases are not to be regarded as proceedings in
justice, but that they are from every point of view to
be regarded as_ proceedings before an
administrative agency, specially provided for the
settlement of criminal cases, and_ specifically
adapted to the conditions prevailing in frontier
districts, at any rate at the time when the Regulation
was enacted”.

5. The tribes living in the tribal belt comprising of
seven Agencies and six Frontier Regions were, for centuries
governed by their traditions and customs, which they inherited
from generation to generation, till the British extended the
Frontier Crimes Regulations, 1901 to their area. After
Independence, FATA continued to be governed by the same
law wherein the President of the country was the highest
Executive Authority and the Governor of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa (former NWFP) discharged the responsibilities
as Agent to the President while exercising powers of Chief
Executive relating the tribal belt.

6. The existence of more than one law, in one
country with reference to FATA, had often been questioned.
Legal reforms were introduced by successive governments. In
the year 2011, some reforms were introduced, and in the year
2018, FATA Interim Governance Regulation, 2018 was
promulgated (“Regulation”). Section 3 of the Regulation
repealed the Frontier Crimes Regulation, 1901 (amended in

2011).
5
7. The vires of the Regulation were challenged

before this Court through a constitutional petition No 3098-P
of 2018, which was allowed, and the Regulation was declared
ultra vires of the Constitution to the extent of allowing
Commissioners to act as Judges; Council of Elders deciding
the Civil & Criminal matters; Constitution of Quami Jirga;
Modified application of Chapter VII & XLII of the Code for
Security; Third Schedule administered area.

8. The judgment of this court was assailed before
the Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan in Civil Petition No
773-P of 2018. The concluding paragraph of the judgment is
reproduced as under:-

“In light of the foregoing, Constitution Petition No.
24/2012 is disposed of and Civil Petition No. 773-
P/2018 is dismissed as having been withdrawn, with the
following observations:-

i. The operation of jirgas/panchayats etc. violates
Pakistan’s international commitments under the
UDHR, ICCPR and CEDAW which place a
responsibility on the State of Pakistan to ensure that
everyone has access to courts or tribunals, are
treated equally before the law and in all stages of
procedure in courts and tribunals;

ii. The manner in which jirgas/panchayats etc.
function is violative of Articles 4, 8, 10-A, 25 and
175(3) of the Constitution;

ii.

Jirgahs/panchayats etc. do not operate under the
Constitution or any other law whatsoever to the
extent that they attempt to adjudicate on civil or
criminal matters; however, they may operate within
the permissible limits of the law to the extent of
acting arbitration, mediation, negotiation or
reconciliation forums between parties involved in a
civil dispute who willingly consent to the same;

iv. Since no individual or persons in the name of a
jirga/panchayat or under any other name can
assume the jurisdiction of a civil or criminal court
without any lawful authority; any order, decision or
a direction issued by any such individual or group
of persons is hereby declared illegal and against the
spirit of the Constitution;

v. The law enforcement agencies all over Pakistan are
duty-bound to be vigilant and ensure that if any
crime has gone unreported, they of their own
accord file FIR(s) with regards to the same and
initiate the process of investigation;
6

vi. If as a consequence of any illegal decision, order,
direction or inducement of such _ self-appointed
adjudicatory bodies any crime is committed, the
offender as well as the individual or group of
persons involved in aiding such jirga/panchayat etc.
shall be jointly held responsible for the said offence
and must be proceeded against in accordance with
the law;

vii. The police must ensure compliance with the general
guiding principles laid down in paragraph No. 14
of this judgment and standard operating procedures
(SOPs) must be introduced by them within two
months from the date of announcement of this
judgment which should be circulated throughout the
country with a compliance report to be submitted to
this Court at the end of the two-month period;

viii. After the 25" Amendment, all the residents
of the Province of KPK are similarly placed, there
is no rational basis on which the people of FATA
can be distinguished from the people of the rest of
the province of KPK and thus the application of the
FATA Interim Regulation to one part of KPK while
the rest of the province enjoys the protection of the
provincial laws is absolutely unjustified, grossly
discriminatory and in contravention of the
fundamental right to equal protection;

ix. On grounds of discrimination which cannot be
Justified under any reasonable classification and the
law laid down in Azizullah Memon’s case (supra),
the FATA Interim Regulation is declared as ultra
vires on the touchstone of Articles 4, 8, 25, 175 and
203 of the Constitution; and

x. The Government of KPK is granted six months from
the date of announcement of this judgment for the
development of infrastructure ot take steps to
spread a uniform system of courts of ordinary
jurisdiction in KPK, mandating the local law
enforcement agencies to ensure that the rule of law
is observed by reducing jirgas/panchayats etc. to
arbitration forums which may be approached
voluntarily by local residents to the extent of civil
disputes only”.

9. On 5" June, 2018, through Act No. XXXVII of
2018, twenty-fifth amendment in the Constitution was
promulgated which omitted Article 247 of the Constitution,
and amended Article 246. Tribal areas of FATA region were
merged into the settled area. With this constitutional
amendment the judicial system of the country was extended to

FATA.
7
10. Since on omission of Article 247 ibid the normal

laws stood applicable to the newly merged FATA and criminal
as well as civil courts were also established in the said area
therefore, this Court felt to provide a forum for the pending
legal matter while adjudicating upon a Reference/Suo Moto
No. 01-P/2019. The following questions were framed, which

reads as under: -

1. Whether the forums constituted under defunct FCR
(Deputy Commissioner FCR, Commissioner FCR and
FCR Tribunal) can continue to exercise jurisdiction
in respect of the matters pending before the time of
25" Constitutional Amendment judgment of this
Court in FGR case (W.P.No.3098-P/2018, Ali Azim
Afridi. V. Federation of Pakistan and_ others,
judgment dated 16.01.2019 of august Supreme Court
of Pakistan in C. P No.24/2012 (Under Article 184
(3) of the Constitution and C.P. No.773-P of 2018
(Government of Pakistan...V... Ali Azim Afridi and
others) and Judgment dated 15.10.2018 of august
Supreme Court of Pakistan in Human Rights case
No.70788 of 2018?

2. Whether the Appellate and Revisional forums
(Commissioner FCR and FCR_ Tribunal)
constituted under defunct FCR can continue to
retain the jurisdiction over Civil and Criminal
Appeals and Civil and Criminal Revisions pending
before them after the coming into force of the 25"
Constitutional Amendments and the judgment of
this Court in FGR case (W.P.No.3098-P/2018, Ali
Azim Afridi..V.. Federation of Pakistan and others
and judgment of august Supreme Court of
Pakistan referred to above?

11. This Court vide its judgment recorded in
Reference No.01-P/2019 on 20.03.2019 has answered the

questions, which reads as under:

“The questions No.1 & 2 are interconnected, so taken
together for determination & answer. Perusal of
record would depict that before (Twenty-fifth
amendment) Act, 2018, FATA Interim Governance
Regulation,2018, was promulgated whereby Deputy
Commissioners, Additional Deputy Commissioners &
Assistant Commissioners have been vested with the
powers to act as Judge, in the Tribal Districts &
Sub-Divisions, under the Code to try offences under
the regulation. Under section-3 of the said regulation,
Frontier Crimes Regulation, 1901, was repealed,
however, it would be seen that whether by virtue of
said section the FCR is expressly repealed or
otherwise, especially after the judgment of this Court
declaring the portion of IGR, as ultra vires, and in
8

view of section-6 of General Clauses Act. The reply to
this query lies in the ascertainment of the raison
detre of the ibid pronouncement. The IGR is violative of
the fundamental rights and in particular the right to
fair trial guaranteed by the constitution and it
would be absurd to imply from the ibid
pronouncement that the material part of the IGR is
dismantled inclusive of the provision repealing the
FCR s.(3) In effect revitalizing the FCR; which indeed
is not the intention of the legislature while enacting
IGR and on declaration of IGR being ultra vires, the
whole superstructure thereof has crumbled to ground
inclusive of S.52, thus the FCR stands impliedly
repealed for the reasons that the same was
restricted in its applicability to FATA, which
through (Twenty-fifth constitutional amendment)
cease to exist, and thus FATA is now alien to the
constitution, the enactment restricted specifically to
FATA would through implication stand repealed
therefore, s.6 G C A would be applicable.”

Vide Para No.11 of the ibid, judgment all the
cases were ordered to be transferred to the regular courts by
exercising the powers under Section 24 of Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 and Section 526 of Criminal Procedure Code,
1898.

12. Later, when a good number of cases were
transferred to this Court, which were supposed to be decided
by erstwhile hierarchy established under the FCR, the Bench
hearing one of the cases had requested the Hon’ble Chief
Justice to constitute a Larger Bench as the decision of this
Court in Reference No. 01-P/2019 had decided the issue in
contravention to the mandate of Article 264 of the
Constitution.

13. Before proceeding further, we would first refer to
the mechanism of dispute resolution both; civil and criminal
under the FCR. Chapter III of the FCR deals with the
resolution of civil disputes, adjudication, and sentencing of
crimes. According to Section 8 of the FCR in case of a civil
dispute between various persons which may likely cause a
breach of Peace in the area, the Political Agent or the District
Coordination Officer, on receipt of any such complaint, would

refer the matter to the Council of Elders, the members whereof
9
to be nominated with the consent of the parties, who shall

inquire the matter and record their findings by Riwaj of the
locality. On receipt of finding of the Council of Elders, the
Political Agent or the District Coordination Officer could pass
a decree in accordance with the findings of the majority of the
Council of Elders or would remand the case to the Council of
Elders for further inquiry and findings, if so required. (See
section 8 of FCR)

14. Similarly, where any offence was committed
within the territorial limits of erstwhile FATA, the Political
Agent or the District Coordination Officer would take
cognizance in the mater and on the arrest of the accused, the
question of guilt or innocence of the accused would be
referred to the Council of Elders for its findings, who after
holding necessary inquiry and hearing the parties would
submit its finding to the Political Agent or the District
Coordination Officer, as the case may be. On receipt of the
findings of the Council of Elders, the Political Agent or the
District Coordination Officer, as the case may be, would pass
an order in accordance with the findings of the majority of the
Council of Elders or remand the case to the Council of Elders
for further inquiry and findings. (See section 11 of FCR)

15. Chapter-VI of the FCR deals with the appeal and
revision. Under Section 48 of the FCR, an appeal would lie to
the Commissioner or Additional Commissioner, if authorized
so by the Governor, from any decision given, decree or
sentence passed or order made by the Political Agent or the
District Coordination Officer under the Regulation and the
order of Commissioner or Additional Commissioner could be
challenged before the FATA Tribunal established under
Section 55-A FCR.

16. Under FCR for the trial of an offence; the
proceedings were trifurcated into three stages i.e. first
cognizance of offence and reference to the jirga, and second

inquiry and trial by the jirga which inter alia includes
10
recording the statement of the parties and collection of

evidence, and to recommend its findings to the Political Agent
or Deputy Commissioner, and thirdly, the order (concurrence)
of the Deputy Commissioner/Political Agent upon the guilt or
otherwise of the accused. As stated above, the order of the
Political Agent could be challenged before the next higher
authority. Similar was the position in the matter of trying a
civil dispute. Therefore, the question arises as to what extent
the repeal of FCR would affect the pending trial.

17. The trifurcated proceedings before the erstwhile
forum included procedural as well as substantive law
regulating the rights of the parties in that legal dispensation.
Though through 25" amendment in the Constitution, Article
247 was omitted, however as for as its consequence in terms
of Article 264 is concerned, we are conscious of the legal
proposition that the effect of omission of any law has a similar
meaning that of repeal; repeal and omissions are not distinct
terms rather they are expression used by the legislature to
achieve the same object, where the legislature wanted to
abrogate and annul an entire/whole statute, it adhered to the
word repeal but where a particular provision or part of the
statute was to be rescinded, abrogated, annulled expressions

omitted or deleted was used. Muhammad Tariq Badr _vs.
National Bank of Pakistan (2013 SCMR 314).

18. No doubt after 25" amendment in the
Constitution, the Frontier Crimes Regulation, 1901 stands
repealed, however despite the repeal of law even in absence of
re-enactment the subject of repealed law, it is trite that the
pending actions before any legal forum would continue under
the repealed law. Exception to this rule is amendment of
omission of procedure law followed by re-enactment which
may provide a different forum for adjudication of substantive
rights of the parties accruing of the repealed law. Similarly, it

is one of the general rules of construction that if the rights and
11
procedure are both altered but rights accrued under the

repealed enactment are saved, then in the absence of an
intention to the contrary expressed or necessarily implied in
the new statute, it will be proper to interpret the intention of
the legislature to be that the old procedure will subsist for the
enforcement of the saved rights. (N.S Bindra Interpretation of

Statutes, 9" Edition).

19. The effect of repeal whether the subject of
repealed law is reenacted or not has been provided under
Article 264 of the Constitution, which, thus, would be relevant
to the present controversy. Article 264 of the Constitution

reads as under:

Where a law is repealed, or is deemed to have
been repealed, by, under, or by virtue of the
Constitution, the repeal shall not, except as
otherwise provided in the constitution, -

a. revives anything not in force or existing at the
time at which the repeal takes effect;

b. affects the previous operation of the law or
anything duly done or suffered under the law;

c. affects any right, privilege, obligation or liability
acquired, accrued or incurred under the law;

d. affects any penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect of any offence committed
against the law; or

e. affects any investigation legal proceeding or
remedy in respect of any such right, privilege,
obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or
punishment; and any such investigation, legal
proceeding or remedy may be _ instituted,
continued or enforced, and any such penalty,
forfeiture or punishment may be imposed, as if
the law had not been repealed.

20. The basic principle of law is that when a statute is
repealed, everything stands obliterated except the pending
proceedings. The effect of Article 264 of the Constitution was

discussed in the case of Muhammad Arif vs. State (1993
SCMR 1589) as follows:
21.

materia to Article 264 of the Constitution. Indian Supreme

Court in the case of Neena Aneja vs Jai Prakash Associates
Ltd., (AIR 2021 SC 1441) explained different clauses of

12

“Tt is evident that there is judicial consensus that
where a law is repealed, it will not inter alia affect
any investigations, legal proceedings or remedy in
respect of any right, privilege, obligation, liability,
penalty, forfeiture or punishment, and any such
investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be
instituted, continued or enforced, and any such
penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed
as if the law had not been repealed. This is so, inter
alia, because of section 6 of the General Clauses
Act, 1897 (which corresponds to section 4 of the
West Pakistan General Clauses Act, 1956), in the
absence of any contrary intention manifested in the
relevant statute. Since the General Clauses Act is
not applicable to the Constitution, the above
provision has been incorporated therein in the form
of Article 264.”

Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 is pari

Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, by observing that:

“63. Section 6 of the General Clauses Act provides
governing principles with regard to the impact of
the repeal of a central statute or regulation. These
governing principles are to apply, "unless a
different intention appears". Clause(c) of Section
6 inter alia stipulates that a repeal would not affect
“any right, privilege, obligation or liability
acquired, accrued or incurred under any enactment
so repealed". The right to pursue a validly instituted
consumer complaint under the Act of 1986 is a right
which has accrued under the law which was
repealed. Clause (e) of Section 6 stipulates that the
repeal will not affect, inter alia, any "legal
proceeding or remedy" in respect of any such
right...as aforesaid". Any such legal proceedings
may be continued as if the repealing legislation had
not been passed. Clause (c) of Section _6 has the
effect of preserving the right which has accrued.
Clause (e) ensures that a legal proceeding which
has been initiated to protect or enforce "such right"
will not be affected and that it can be continued as
if the repealing legislation has not been enacted.
The expression such a right in clause (e) evidently
means the right which has been adverted to in
clause (c). The plain consequence of clause (c) and
clause (e), when read together is two- fold: first, the
right which has accrued on the date of the
institution of the consumer complaint under the Act
of 1986 (the repealing law) is preserved; and
second, the enforcement of the right through the
instrument of a legal proceeding or remedy will not
be affected by the repeal.
13

64. Having stated the above position, we need to
harmonize it with the principle that the right to a
forum is not an accrued right, as discussed in Part
C of this judgment. Simply put, while Section 6(e) of
the General Clauses Act protects the pending legal
proceedings for the enforcement of an accrued right
from the effect of a repeal, this does not mean that
the legal proceedings at a particular forum are
saved from the effects from the repeal. The question
whether the pending legal proceedings are required
to be transferred to the newly created forum by
virtue of the repeal would still persist. As discussed,
this Court in New India Assurance(supra) and
Maria Christina(supra) has held that forum is a
matter pertaining to procedural law and therefore
the litigant has to pursue the legal proceedings at
the forum created by the repealing act, unless a
contrary intention appears. This principle would
also apply to pending proceedings, as observed in
Ramesh Kumar Soni (supra), Hitendra Kumar
Thakur (supra) and Sudhir G Angur(supra). In this
backdrop, what is relevant to ascertain is whether a
contrary intent to the general rule of retrospectivity
has been expressed under the Act of 2019 to
continue the proceedings at the older forum.

65. Now, in considering the expression of intent in
the repealing enactment in the present case, it is
apparent that there is no express language
indicating that all pending cases would stand
transferred to the fora created by the Act of 2019 by
applying its newly prescribed pecuniary limits. In
deducing whether there is a contrary intent, the
legislative scheme and procedural history may
provide a relevant insight into the intention of the
legislature.”

In the above case in view of the hardship of the
litigants the pending proceedings were not transferred to the
courts created under the new law.

22. The question here arises as to what would be the
effect of the repeal of FCR on the pending proceedings before
the fora established under the erstwhile FCR. We are not
dealing with the issue for the first time as the effect of repeal
of FCR on the pending cases already came under discussion
before this Court as well as other High Courts and even before
the Apex Court.

23. The matter of repeal of FCR was specifically
discussed by the High Court of West Pakistan in Full Bench
judgment in the case of Sardar Nawab Haji_ Muhammad

Khan Versus Additional Commissioner_and_ others (PLD
14
1964 Lahore 401) and it was held that the repeal will not

affect the proceedings instituted before the passing of the
repealing act. The relevant excerpt from the judgment is

reproduced here for ready reference:

“11. The other reason for holding the West
Pakistan Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1963, to
be irrelevant for our present purposes is that even if
the Act had come into force in the Quetta and Kalat
Divisions, the Regulation being thereupon repealed,
the present petitions, having been instituted before
the passing of the Act, would not have been
affected, their continuation being one of the
ordinary incidents of the repeal of an enactment.”

The question of repeal of Frontier Crimes
Regulation also came up for discussion before the Honorable
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Sona and another
Versus the State (PLD 1970 Supreme Court 264). The Larger
Bench of the august Apex Court held that Section 6 of the
General Clauses Act of 1897 which applies to Central Acts or
Regulations is also in the same term and language. One of the
effects of the repeal is that it shall not affect any investigation,
legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right,
privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or
punishment as aforesaid; and any such investigation, legal
proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and any such penalty, forfeiture or punishment may
be imposed as if the Repealing Act or Regulation had not been
passed. It is, therefore, quite clear that all the investigations or
proceedings which are contemplated are to continue as if the
Repealing Act or Regulation had not been passed. On this
language it is quite clear that the trial of criminal cases has to
be in accordance with rules of procedure in force at the
commencement of the trial and the same procedure has to be
followed.
24. A similar situation also arose before this Court
when a similar law i.e. Regulation No. II of 1994 providing
for a similar legal dispensation in the erstwhile PATA was

repealed, a reference was filed before this Court relating to the
15
effect of such repeal on the pending matters when admittedly

the normal law of the land including the establishment of
Courts were also extended to the PATA. A reference was filed
before this Court in the case of Abdul Samad vs. Painda
Muhammad (PLD 1997 Peshawar 3) seeking guidance on the
point that as to whether the cases pending before forums set up
under (repealed) Regulation of 1975 were required to be
transferred to Courts established under Regulation II of 1994,
and whether the District Judge would be competent to hear
appeal against judgments of Deputy Commissioners passed
under repealed Regulation of 1975. It was held that:

“8. Section 11 of N.-W.F.P., Regulation II of 1994
is a legitimate and valid provision of law which has
been made by competent authority of making laws
for PATA N.-W. F. P. Section 11 of N.-W. F. P.
Regulation No. 11 of 1994 is para materia with
section 6 of the General Clauses Act and almost in
the same language as used in the said section 6. The
Balochistan High Court has held that whereas in
the event of enactment found repugnant or
inconsistent with the provisions of Constitution of
struck down, consequences are analogous to repeal
and such laws, remain operative till finalization of
pending proceedings. The PATA N-W.F.P.
Regulation I of 1975 and PATA Regulation II of
1975 were repealed by N.-W. F. P. Regulation IT of
1994 with effect from 12th day-of February, 1994.
The provisions of section 11 of N-W.F.P.
Regulation IT of 1994 does not provide transfer of
appeals and revisions pending hearing before
forums under PATA N.-W.F.P. Regulations I and IT
of 1975 and rightly so. The appellate and revisional
forums under PATA N.-W.F.P. Regulations I and IT
of 1975 cannot be equated to the forums of appeals
and revisions under the Civil Procedure Code, 1908
and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. A
fortiori a criminal appeal or revision is governed by
the Code of Criminal Procedure, Pakistan Penal
Code and other criminal laws. The civil, appellate
and revisional Courts are governed by the Code of
Civil Procedure, Civil Courts Ordinance, 1962,
Court Fees Act, Suits Valuation Act and other
connected and relevant -laws read with generally
the Qanun-e-Shahadat. A party in appeal or
revision before the forums under PATA N.-W.F.P.,
Regulations I and II of 1975 cannot choose to
withdraw the same and then file the appeal or
revision in ordinary civil and criminal Courts on his
choosing without sanction of the law and procedure
and neither the ordinary Courts having jurisdiction
of appeal and revision can exercise jurisdiction in
such like cases brought before them.

9. The formulated Point No. | is answered to the
effect that appeals or petitions pending under the
repealed PATA N.-W.F.P. Regulation I of 1975 and
PATA N.-W.F.P. Regulation IT of 1975 will be
heard and decided by the forums under the said
Regulation II notwithstanding the repeal of the
Regulations by N.-W.F.P. Regulation No.II of 1994
and would not stand transferred to the Courts
established under N.-W.F.P. Regulation II of 1994.
The answer to Point No.2 is that the Courts
established under N.-W.F.P. Regulation II of 1994
including the District and Sessions Judges would be
competent to hear appeals against the judgments of
Deputy Commissioners passed under PATA
N.-W.F.P. Regulation I of 1975 and PATA
N.-W.F.P. Regulation II of 1975. Consequently, the
pending cases before the trial forums under the
PATA N.-W.F.P. Regulation I of 1975 and PATA
N.-W.F.P. Regulation II of 1975 are to be
transferred to the appropriate Courts of
ordinary jurisdiction, civil and criminal, for trial of
the cases and judgment thereupon under the law
and procedure applicable to the cases under
N.-W.F.P. Regulation II of 1994. The Reference of
the learned Additional District Judge under section
113 of C.P.C. is also answered accordingly.

10. Before parting with this judgment, it will not be
out of place to mention that valuable rights have
accrued to the parties whose cases have been
decided-by the trial forums under PATA N.-W.F.P.
Regulation I of 1975 and PATA N.-W.F.P.
Regulation II of 1975. If any appeal and revision is
to be decided by the hierarchy of the forums under
the said Regulations then it will decide the matter
according to the law and procedure applicable
under the said Regulations and in case any of the
forum under the said Regulations decide to remand
the case to the trial forums for trial, then the case
will be tried by the forums of ordinary criminal and
civil jurisdiction. It is also relevant to mention that
PATA N.-W.F.P. Regulation I of 1975 and PATA
N.-W.F.P. Regulation IT of 1975 were acted upon
and judgments delivered under the same for about
20 years and this Court in its Constitutional
jurisdiction passed orders from time to time in
regulating the procedure of the forums under the
said Regulations in accordance with law and
procedure applicable in the cases under the PATA
N.-W.F.P. Regulation I of and PATA N.-W.F.P.
Regulation II of 1975.

25. In the aforesaid trifurcated legal dispensation, it is
thus, obvious after considering the aforesaid judgments that all
pending proceedings which had commenced under the
repealed law (FCR) before the same forum would continue

under the same legal dispensation and should not be
17
transferred to the normal Courts which were altogether

established under a different law. Similarly, the law is settled
that filing of an appeal is a statutory right and is not a matter
of course, meaning thereby that unless provided by law, no
Court has any jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against the
decision of a forum though the said forum is subordinate to the
said Court. With profound respect, the Courts have no
jurisdiction to confer upon any forum a right of appeal which
indeed is a domain of the law-maker i.e. the appropriate
legislation. The outcome of the aforesaid discussion would be
that notwithstanding the repeal of Article 247 of the
Constitution and the corollary of the said omission despite the
fact that the FCR which had the force of law in terms of
Article 247 and 268 of the Constitution, the said repeal would
not affect any investigation, legal proceedings or remedy in
respect of any such right which would continue to be available
to the aggrieved party. Jbrahim_vs. Muhammad Hussain
(PLD 1975 SC 457), Habib Bank Limited vs. The State and
06 others (1993 SCMR 1853), Government of the Punjab vs.
Abdur Rehman_ (2022 SCMR 25).

26. In the present case, we have to yet draw a
distinction between the matters which though were initiated
prior to the 25" amendment in the Constitution, omitting
Article 247 ibid under the FCR but had not culminated into
the final judgment i.e. to say when any inquiry or trial in the
trifurcated system had commenced, the jirga was constituted,
which had inquired the matter, however, a final
judgment/order was not announced by the Political
Agent/Deputy Commissioner. Essentially, under the erstwhile
dispensation any matter whether civil or criminal was to be
inquired and investigated by a jirga/Council of Elders, and the
Political Agent or Deputy Commissioner had very less
jurisdiction to interfere in the findings of the jirga as the said
findings could not be substituted by the Deputy Commissioner

rather if he was of the opinion that the matter requires further
18
probe he could send back it to the jirga for further probe. It

was held by the Apex Court in the case of National

Commission _on_the status of women _vs. Government of

Pakistan through Secretary Law and Justice (PLD 2019 SC
218) referred above that the manner in which jirga/panchayat

functions in any system is violative of Articles 4, 8, 10-A, 25
and 175(3) of the Constitution. Therefore, any system which
provides for resolution of the matter through jirga system after
pronouncement of the judgment of the Apex Court ibid
(16.01.2019) cannot be allowed to further proceed with the
matter more particularly in the circumstances when the law of
the land establishing a normal investigation/inquiry/trial
stands extended to the erstwhile FATA.

27. Indeed, it is settled law that the matters relating
to investigation/inquiry/trial/receiving of evidence are
procedural and a new legal dispensation on the eve of
omission/replacement of old legal dispensation may operate
retrospectively. Crawford too takes the view that questions
relating to jurisdiction over a cause of action, venue, parties’
pleadings and rules of evidence also pertain to procedure,
provided the burden of proof is not shifted. Thus; a statute
purporting to transfer jurisdiction over certain causes of action
may operate retrospectively. This is what is meant by saying
that a change of forum by a law is retrospective being a matter
of procedure only. Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that if
in this process any existing rights are affected or the giving of
retroactive operation cause inconvenience or injustice, then
the Courts will not even in the case of a procedural statute,
favour an interpretation giving retrospective effect to the
statute. On the other hand, if the new procedural statute is of
such a character that its retroactive application will tend to
promote justice without any consequential embarrassment or
detriment to any of the parties concerned, the Courts would
favourably incline towards giving effect to such procedural

statutes retroactively. Malik Gul Hassan & Co Versus Allied
19
Bank of Pakistan (1996 SCMR 237) Adrian Afzal vy. Capt.

Sher Afzal (PLD 1969 SC 187). Ch. Safdar Ali _y. Malik

Abdullah _y. Imdad Ali (1972 SCMR 173), Bashir.v. Wazir

(PLD 1988 SC 391) and Yusuf Ali Khan v. Hongkong &

Shanghai__Banking Corporation, Karachi (1994 SCMR
1007).

28. We have noticed that the third category of the
cases was seriously affected by the judgment of this Court in
Reference No. 01-P/2019 dated 20.03.2019. As evident from
record that though the said cases were transferred to the regular
courts for adjudication but in this regard, neither any proper
investigation was conducted by the investigation agency nor a
complete challan was submitted in the manner provided under
Section 173 Cr.P.C. What exactly happened in majority of
those cases, that the cases which were being inquired by the
jirga/Council of Elders were placed before the regular courts for
adjudication where there was neither any report of Investigation
Officer nor the list of witnesses were before the Court. The trial
Court on a number of occasions had directed the Public
Prosecutor to produce evidence, however, when admittedly,
nobody had collected evidence then obviously no evidence
could be produced before the Court. It would have surely
served the requirements of fair trial if, other than jirga decision,
police had independently investigated the cases. Since as
observed by this Court in the preceding para that in view of the
judgment of the Apex Court in the case of National
Commission _on_the_status_of women_ys. Government of

Pakistan through Secretary Law and Justice (PLD 2019 SC
218) no credence can be given to the proceedings conducted by

jirga/panchayat and the inquiry § and __ investigation
being a procedural matter for which regular police
agency is now working under the merged area, therefore, in

such peculiar circumstances it is the requirement
20
of natural justice that these matters are investigated by the

regular police and after completion of investigation, the matter
be placed before the court of competent jurisdiction through the
office of District Public Prosecutor. However, in certain cases
re-investigation may be a futile exercise. The law is settled that
the reinvestigation may be conducted to unearth the truth where
the fairness, rectitude and impartiality demands but there are
certain conditions and limitations which may include the visible
defects in the first investigation or flaws in the final report
detected subsequently or the first investigation is unsatisfactory
for many reasons including non-availability of the evidence or
the successful induction of false evidence during the
investigation or the corrupt behavior of the police officer.
Reliance in this respect can be placed on Bahadur Khan ys.
Muhammad Azam (2006 SCMR 373), Atta Muhammad ys.
Inspector_General_of Police, West Pakistan, Lahore_ PLD
1965 (W.P) Lahore 734 and Zeeshan Mustafa Lashari V._The
Province of Sindh (2016 YLR Note 37). We are of the opinion
that defect, if any, in the investigation can be determined by the
respective Benches. We, therefore, leave it to the respective
Benches to consider the matters on case-to-case basis.
Similarly, pursuant to the judgment of this Court in Reference
No. 01-P/2019 dated 20.03.2019, if any proceeding has
culminated into final judgment passed by this Court cannot be
re-opened under the doctrine of past & closed transaction.
Furthermore, if pursuant to the aforesaid judgment of this
Court, any case was remanded to the regular trial court by this
Court and the regular trial court has recorded verdict in the
same and the said judgment is impugned before this Court
through any proceedings, it would be the appropriate Bench of
this Court to decide the same without being prejudiced by the
findings in this case.

29. In view of the above, we have reached at the
conclusion that notwithstanding the omission of Article 247

ibid as a result whereof the FCR also stood repealed the legal
proceedings or remedy in respect of any such a right would
continue under the legal dispensation provided under FCR
except the proceedings of jirga/Council of Elders in the same
mode and manner as provided under the repealed FCR.

Hence, we dispose of the instant petition and the connected

21

matters in the following manner.

i.

ili.

The case of the first category shall be
transferred to the FATA Tribunal which was
established under Section 55-A of the FCR and
in this regard, the Provincial Government shall
constitute and notify FATA Tribunal for
adjudication of the said cases as well as other
cases which would arise out of the judgment of
the Commissioner or other fora as stated in this
Judgment.

The case of second category i.e. Cr.A. No. 401-
P/2019 titled “Khiyal Gul vs. Inzar Gul and
another” shall also be transferred to the
Commissioner Kohat Division Kohat for
adjudication under FCR and in this regard, the
Provincial Government will also notify the
office of Commissioner under the enabling
provision of FCR .

The third category of cases shall be placed
before the respective Benches for determination
on its own merits. If deemed essential, the
respective Bench may refer the  case/
proceedings to the District Public Prosecutor of
the respective Districts/merged area, who will
thoroughly examine the record, may refer the
case for reinvestigation to the concerned Police
Station with direction to reinvestigate the
matter and thereafter submit a complete challan
before the competent court of law under Section
173 of Criminal Procedure Code.

The cases relating to civil disputes which did
not culminate into final judgment, were pending
before the Political Agents, and were
transferred to the regular courts in view of
Reference No 01-P/2019 decided on 20.03.2019
shall remain pending with the respective
Courts. However, the judgments/decree passed
by the District Judges/Additional District
22
Judges in the fourth category of the cases are
accordingly set aside and the appeals which
were transferred to the said Courts will be sent
back to the relevant forum (Commissioner
FCR) for adjudication under the FCR.
