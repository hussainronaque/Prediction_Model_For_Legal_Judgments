of the accused, Jehan Zeb, the complainant
sustained severe injuries, however, rest of the
complainant-party comprising of his other
sons, Usama & Muhammad Ali escaped un-
hurt. In addition to the injured/complainant,
the occurrence has been witnessed by his
sons, Usama & Muhammad Ali. Motive for
the commission of offence was disclosed to be
a dispute over the path/way. In view of the
report of the injured/complainant, the
‘Murasila’ (Ex. PW-3/1) was drafted which
culminated into the ibid FIR (Ex. PW-6/1)
registered against the accused/appellants at

P.S concerned.

criminal revision No. 01-M/2022 for
enhancement of the sentences awarded to the

accused/respondents.

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan

7. Learned counsel for the parties
as well as the learned Addl: A.G for the State
have been heard at a length and the record

gone through with their valuable assistance.

8. Needless to highlight that in the
subject event the law of the land was set in
motion when the police contingent, under the
command of Bahramand Shah, SHO, P.S,
Totalai, (PW-3) reached the emergency ward
of Civil Hospital Totalai, pursuant to receipt
of a clue about an offence of murder,
whereby, the injured/ complainant, Shaukat
Ali, PW-7, (father of the deceased, Sajjad Ali)
reported them the subject occurrence in terms
that on the fateful day, he, in the company of
his sons, Sajjad Ali (deceased) and other
complainant-party comprising of Usama &
Muhammad Ali were present in the venue of
crime in connection with supervision of their
under constructed house work. In the
meanwhile, the accused/ appellants, Jehan
Zeb, Abubakar Zeb. & Shakeel, while being
duly equipped firearms came there and

resorted to firing upon the complainant-party.

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-7-

As a result of firing of the accused/appellant,
Abubakar Zeb, his deceased son, Sajjad Ali
got hit and died on the spot, whereas, due to
fire shots of accused/appellant, Jehan Zeb, the
complainant sustained severe injuries. Rest of
the complainant-party icc. Usama &
Muhammad Ali escaped un-hurt. Motive for
the commission of offence was disclosed to be

a dispute over the path/way.

9. There is no second opinion at all
that the effective & specific role of firing at
the deceased as well as the injured/
complainant has been attributed to the
accused/appellants, Abubakar Zeb and Jehan
Zeb by the complainant in his initial report in
the shape of ‘Murasila’ followed by the ibid
FIR, with a specific motive which stated to be
a dispute over the path/way. Other than the
above, both the parties were known to each
other due to existence of the previous motive
as well as being co-villagers, as such, there
was no chance of mis-identification or false
implication on the part of the complainant-

party.

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan

10. In order to prove their case, the
prosecution has mainly been relying upon the
eyewitness-account offered by the two
prosecution witnesses, whose statements have
been recorded as PW-7 and PW-8,
respectively. The injured/complainant of the
subject case, Shaukat Ali (who is none else
but the real father of the deceased, Sajjad Ali)
offered a natural & straight-forward account
of the occurrence, as highlighted in the
‘Murasila’ followed by the ibid FIR. He was
cross-examined at a _ substantial length,
however, he remained consistent on most of
the material particulars of the subject case.
With the blessing of learned counsel for the
defence in the examination-in-cross of the
injured/complainant, the mode & manner of
the occurrence, the venue of crime as well as
the motive part of the case have been
specified & confirmed, in the following

words;-

On the day of occurrence four masons and eight
laborers were busy in working in my under
construction house.

The dispute over thoroughfare arose some two and
half months prior to the present occurrence.

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-9-

It is correct that Police Station Totalai and civil
hospital Totalai can be approached from the spot
in a vehicle. We remained on the spot for about 25
minutes after the occurrence and then left the
same for the hospital. Self-stated that due to non-
availability of the vehicle we remained on the spot.

Some 8/10 persons from the locality attracted to
the spot of the occurrence among whom I cannot
name anyone. I did not narrate the story to anyone
of them. I myself boarded the vehicle while the
dead body of my deceased son was lifted by the
masons, my sons and other persons. I had not
disclosed the names of masons as well as laborers
to the police either in my report or afterwards
during the course of investigation. The witness
volunteered that they were not known to me as
they hailed from Mardan.

Same was the case with the
account of another PW, Muhammad Usama
who has given a similar narration of the
occurrence in his examination-in-chief while
deposing as PW-8. He had also remained
consistent in his testimony during the course
of his cross-examination. In his examination-
in-cross, PW-8 has deposed in alike manner
as like his father i.e. the injured/complainant,
Shaukat Ali, in terms that he had pointed out
various placed to the Investigation Officer at
the time of his visit to the spot with respect to
presence of his deceased brother, Sajjad Ali,
his father, Shaukat Ali as well as his other
brother, Muhammad Ali. He had also made
pointation in respect of presence of the

masons & laborers on the spot to the

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-10-

Investigation Officer. He was also confronted
with his presence on the spot as well as his
arrival & departure therefrom. From the above
narrations of the star witnesses of the
prosecution, it is crystal clear that with the
blessing of the learned counsel for the defence
not only the presence of the masons as well as
the laborers in the under construction house of
the injured/complainant has been confirmed &
verified but the motive part of the case in
hand has also been came to surface. The mode
& manner of the occurrence narrated by the
aforesaid eyewitnesses of the occurrence is
also appealable to a prudent mind in a sense
that it is part & parcel of their cross-
examinations that after the occurrence their
deceased son/brother was lifted from the spot
by the masons in the company of other
complainant-party comprising of Usama &
Muhammad Ali, whereas, the complainant
being (in injured condition) himself boarded
in the vehicle, therefore, it is an admitted fact
floating on the surface of the record that it

was the accused-party who could be termed as

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-ll-

aggressors as they had attracted to the venue
of crime i.e. the under construction house of
the complainant-party in prosecution of their
common object and made murderous assault
upon them which resulted death of one
person besides causing severe firearm injuries
to the other. For the sake of arguments, if the
accused-party have not attracted to the venue
of crime i.e. the under construction house of
the complainant-party then there was no need
for the learned counsel for the defence to put
questions to these PWs in their cross-
examinations about the presence of the

masons as well as the laborers on the spot.

Likewise, there was no need for the learned ©

counsel for the defence to confront these PWs
with their presence on the spot or for that
matter their departure from the venue of
crime, meaning thereby, that impliedly the
learned counsel for the for the defence has
admitted the presence of the complainant-
party on the spot, otherwise, he would have

not confronted them with their presence on

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-12-

the spot especially when the complainant

himself have stamp of injuries on his body.

11. There has been some minor
discrepancies occurring during the course of
cross-examinations of these two PWs but the
same cannot be taken as having a sweeping
effect on their testimonies qua the guilt of the
accused/appellants. No doubt, there has been
some variation existing in the evidence vis-a-
vis, not knowing the names of the masons as
well as the laborers working in their under
construction house as well as variations in
respect of the delayed report of the occurrence
to the local police coupled with delayed
sending of the weapons of offence as well as
crime empties to the FSL. The learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the accused/
appellants laid much stress on _ these
discrepancies (as highlighted above) and
claimed that the same were sufficient for
disbelieving the eyewitness-account offered in
the case in hand, however, it is important to
be noted here that an eyewitness/complainant

may not be expected to have given an exact

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
so

-13-

time of occurrence while lodging his first
report thereof. The PWs while appearing in
the Court after more than 09 months of the
occurrence might not be recollecting the exact
time of occurrence from their own memories
but they may have been stood guided by the
time of occurrence given in the ‘Murasila’
/FIR used for refreshing their memories
before recording their statements. Substantial
time had lapsed between happening of the
events and its description by the two
witnesses offered during the course of the trial
of the accused/appellants. Recollection of
events happening before, at the time & after
the occurrence with a photographic precision
and that also after a lapse of more than 09
months would be unrealistic expectations
from these PWs. In such circumstances, the
contradictions mentioned above may safely be
taken as minor in nature having no bearing on
the material aspects of the subject case, in
respect of which the evidence of these PWs
have mostly remained unshaken, confidence

inspiring & worth reliable. In case titled

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
i

- 14.
“Khadim Hussain V/s The State” reported as
PLD 2010 Supreme Court 669, the Apex

Court has held that creeping in of minor
contradictions in the testimony of PWs, with
Passage of time, have been natural and the
same could be ignored easily. Relevant part
of the observation of the august Court is

reproduced for ready reference;

We have also adverted to the contention of learned
ASC that various contradictions in the statements
of the prosecution witnesses have not been taken
into consideration causing serious prejudice
against the appellant. It has been held time and
again by this Court that minor contradictions do

creep_in with the passage of time and can be

ignored safely.

Similarly, in case titled

“Muhammad Ilyas v/s The State” reported as

“2011_SCMR_460” the Hon’ble Supreme

Court has also observed as follows;

Contradictions which are not grave in nature
can_be ignored safely as minor contradictions
creep_in_with passage of time. Merely on the

basis of contradictions, statement of a
prosecution witness cannot be discarded if

corroborated by other incriminating material.
(underline supplied)

Further reliance in this respect

may also be placed on the judgment of Apex

Court rendered in case titled “Zulfigar Ahmad

v/s The State” reported as “2011 SCMR 492”.

12. Shaukat Ali, PW-7 the

injured/eye-witness has also supported the
prosecution case. Since he has sustained
firearm injuries on the back side of his neck as
well as his right shoulder and was thereafter
shifted to the hospital where his injury-sheet
was prepared and was further shifted to Civil
Hospital, Totalai, Buner for further treatment.
Thus, the presence of this injured/PW at the
spot is also established. In the circumstance, it
cannot be believed that the accused/appellants
were substituted for the real culprits. In this
regard, reliance is placed on the judgment of
august Supreme Court of Pakistan rendered in
case titled “Abdul Rauf and others v/s Mehhi
Hassan and others” reported as 2006 SCMR
1106, whereby, it has been held;-

“Presence of eye-witnesses who had received fire-
arm injuries at the place of occurrence at the
relevant time was not open to any doubt. None of
the eye-witnesses was shown to have any motive or
ill-will to maliciously implicate the accused in the
case.”

This ratio has further been

affirmed by the august Supreme Court of

Pakistan in case titled “Muhammad Waris v/s

‘Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
-16-
The State (2008 SCMR_784)”, wherein the

following observations were made;-

“Eye-witness had explained their presence at the
place of occurrence at the relevant time and thus,
they were natural and independent witnesses of the
incident. Medical evidence was not destructive of
the ocular testimony.”

Likewise, it was also held in case
titled “The State v/s Waheed Iqbal & others”
reported as 2005 P Cr. LJ 1384 that presence
of complainant on the spot could not be denied
as he had sustained injuries during the
occurrence.

13. Apart from the above, the
credibility of the ocular-account cannot be
doubted in the case in hand on the ground that
no question has been put to the eyewitnesses
with respect to any obstacle or hurdle existed
between their visibility range vis-a-vis the
accused-party, in particular, the accused/
appellants, Abubakar Zeb & Jehan Zeb, who
have been assigned a specific role firing at the
deceased as well as the injured/complainant.
The prosecution has also been able to prove the
place of occurrence i.e. the under construction
house of the complainant, wherefrom, the

Investigating Officer has also collected

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan

|

-17-

substantial materials in the shape of blood
stained earth from the places of the deceased as
well as the injured/complainant, crime empties
of 30 bore pistol, vide different recovery
memos. The place of occurrence has not at all
been seriously disputed by the defence side
during the course of cross-examinations of
these PWs. The prosecution has also been able
to sufficiently explain the presence of the PWs
at the spot. When their presence stood
established on the record, they were found
truthful in their narrations being natural and
confidence inspiring, then their testimonies
may be made the basis of conviction even in
absence of any independent corroboration. In
this respect, reliance is placed on the judgment
of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan
rendered in case titled “Muhammad Waris v4
The State” reported as _*2008 SCMR 784”
»whereby, it has been held;-

“The_ explanation offered _by the said _two_eye-
witnesses regarding their presence at the_place_of

occurrence at the relevant time had been accepted b

the two_learned Courts and no reason exists which
could_persuade_us _to_hold_otherwise. Both these
P.Ws. were thus, natural and independent witnesses
of the occurrence who had been rightly delivered by
the two learned Courts. Corroboration is only rule
of caution and not a rule of law and if the eye-

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-18-

witness account is found reliable and trustworthy
then there is hardly any need to look for any
corroboration.”

14. The medical evidence so furnished
in the subject case is also inconsonance with the
story of the prosecution. The dead body of the
deceased, Sajjad Ali, has been examined by Dr.
Abdul Ghafoor, PW-5. Likewise, he also
examined the injured/complainant, Shaukat Alli.
His reports Ex. PW-5/1 & Ex. PW-5/2, speak
loud & clear about the nature of the firearm
injuries received by the deceased and that too on
the vital organ of his body i.e. head. The injured/
complainant, Shaukat Ali also received firearm
injury on vital parts of his body i.e. on the back of
his neck as well as on his right shoulder He was
put to lengthy & searching cross-examination by
the defence but nothing beneficial could be
extracted from his mouth qua the innocence of the
accused/appellants.

15. We are also conscious of the fact
that the two eyewitnesses of the occurrence are
the real father & brother of the deceased but in
absence of any deep rooted enmity except the
one highlighted in the FIR which was stated to

be a dispute over the path/way, these PWs are

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-19-

not expected to substitute the actual culprits for
the present accused/appellants. We do not agree
with the learned counsel for the accused/
appellants that they are interested witness,
because interested witness is a person who had
a motive to falsely implicate the other person
and mere their relationship with the deceased
cannot be made a base to discard their
testimony, on all counts. In this regard, we are
fortified to place reliance on the cases of Apex

Court cited as ‘’Niaz vs the State PLD 1960

Supreme Court 387’’,Sharafat Ali vs the State
1999 SCMR 329’’, Abdur Rauf vs the State,
2003 SCMR_ 522”’, “Dilawar Hussain vs the
State, PLD 2008 S.C. 131”’.

In Sharafat Ali’s case Supra, the
august Supreme Court of Pakistan while
considering the testimony of the witnesses,
one of whom was the husband of the sister of
the deceased and the other was his brother has
held that;-

“Considering the testimony of these two eye-
witnesses on the touchstone of the aforesaid
criteria, we do not find that their testimony is
tainted or they had any motive to falsely implicate
the appellant nor any enmity worth the name has

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
. Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
SO

-20-

been brought on record to show that they were
implicating the appellant in this case falsely.”

In Abdur Rauf ‘s case Supra, it
was held by the august Supreme Court of
Pakistan:-

We may observe that relationship itself is no
ground to discard and discredit the testimony of
eye-witnesses unless it is shown that they are
partisan and interested witnesses. The eye-
witnesses in the present case undoubtedly are
related to the deceased but they have been found
entirely independent and truthful, therefore, their
testimony without looking for any other
corroborative evidence, would alone be sufficient
to establish the charge. The evidence of related
witnesses who are not found inimical and are
confidence-inspiring would hardly need any
corroboration. However, in the present case as
discussed above, the ocular account is seeking
ample support from the motive, the medical
evidence and the attending circumstances.”

In Dilawar Hussain’s case Supra
regarding the relationship of the witnesses, the
august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as
under:-

“The parties as well as the witnesses were closely
related inter se and also have good relations
except that appellant was annoyed’ with the
deceased for his purchase of land from his father
and thus in absence of any enmity or ill-will, mere
relationship is not a valid ground to discard the
evidence of a person and similarly a witness non-
resident of locality, is not as such unnatural
witness, therefore the evidence of such witness
cannot be excluded from consideration for mere
reason that he was related to the deceased or was
not resident of the area in which crime was
committed.”

Therefore, the learned trial Court

for all valid reasons has relied upon their

testimonies qua the guilt of the accused/

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
s

-21-

appellants, irrespective of their inter-se
relationship with the deceased.

16. The other circumstantial evidence
brought on the record by the prosecution do
support their case to a large extent, which
includes the pointation of the place of
occurrence by the accused/appellants, after their
arrest, recovery of blood stained earth and crime
empties of 30 bore pistol from the spot as well
as blood stained garments of the deceased as
well as the injured/complainant coupled with its
positive FSL reports, therefore, in view of the
aforesaid corroboratory evidence too, the
accused/appellants have rightly been found
guilty of the commission of offence by the
learned trial Court.

17. Last but not the least whether the
accused/appellant, Shakeel Ahmad Zeb can
also be held responsible for the commission of
murder and causing firearm injuries by his co-
accomplices, i.e. the accused/appellants,
Abubakar Zeb & Jehan Zeb. The concept to
award similar sentence in addition to the

principal accused who had the common

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-22-

intention of killing the deceased has been
embodied in sections 34 and 149 of the
Pakistan Penal Code (“Code”). The role of co-
accused who were either present at the spot or
had taken some decisive steps in commission
of the offence along with the principal accused
remained subject-matter before the superior
Courts for awarding conviction to the said co-
accused. In case titled “Muhammad Riaz alias

Riasti_and_ another vs the State” reported as

1987 SCMR 177, the Apex Court has made the
following the observations with respect to the
applicability of section 34 PPC to the extent of
co-accomplice;-

“In the above case, one appellant inflicted dagger
blow while the other appellant threw brickbat on -
the face of the fallen victim. It was urged before
this Court that the accused who threw brickbat,
did not know that the other co-accused was
carrying knife or that he would stab deceased in
abdomen and thus did not share common intention
to murder. The above contention was repelled and
it was held that from his throwing brickbat on the
face of the deceased after he had been stabbed in
the abdomen, it was evident that he shared
intention with the co-accused on spot to murder
the deceased. The appeal was dismissed and the
judgments of the two Courts below were
maintained.”’

This view has earlier been

expounded by the Division Bench of the

Lahore High Court in case titled “Gheba_&

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-23-
others vs_the Crown” reported as PLD 1949

Lahore 453, in the following words;-

“Common intention within the meaning of section
34 implies a prearranged plan. To convict the
accused of an offence applying section 34 it should
be proved that the criminal act was done in concert
pursuant to the pre-arranged plan. It is no doubt
difficult if not impossible to procure direct
evidence to prove the intention of an individual; it
has to be inferred from his act or conduct or other
relevant circumstances of the case. Care must be
taken not to confuse same or similar intention with
common intention; the partition which divides
"their bounds" is often very thin; nevertheless, the
distinction is real and substantial, and if
overlooked will result in miscarriage of justice.
The inference of common intention within the
meaning of the term in section 34 should never be
reached unless it is a necessary inference deducible
from the circumstances of the case."

Lastly, the august Supreme Court
of Pakistan in its celebrated judgment
rendered in case titled “Muhammad Akbar &
2 others vs The State reported as PLD 1991 S.C
923 has made the following observations with

respect to the matter-in-issue;-

“From the above-referred cases, it is evident that
a joint action by a number of persons is not
necessarily an action performed with a common
object, but it may be performed on the spur of the
moment as a reaction to some incident and such a
case would fall within the ambit of section 34,
P.P.C. However, it may be pointed out that section
34, P.P.C. contemplates an act in furtherance of
common intention and not the common intention
simpliciter and that there is a marked distinction
between similar intention and common intention
and between knowledge and common intention. It
may also be observed that mere presence of an
accused at the place of incident with a co-accused
who commits offence may not be sufficient to visit
the former with the vicarious liability, but there
should be some Wong circumstance manifesting a
common intention. Generally common intention
inter alia precedes by some or all of the following
elements, namely, common motive, pre-planned

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

-24-

preparation and concert pursuant to such plan.
However, common intention may develop even at
the spur of moment or during the commission of
offence as pointed out hereinabove. Conversely
common intention may undergo change during the
commission of offence’’.

Now reverting back to the case in
hand, the mode and manner of the occurrence
narrated by the prosecution witnesses, in
particular the injured/complainant, Shaukat
Ali, the accused-party comprising of the
principal accused, Abubakar Zeb & Jehan Zeb
would not be able to achieve their prime target
with such a ease & comfort if the
accused/appellant, Shakeel Ahmad Zeb has
not supported them while being duly armed
with firearm and thus the peculiar facts &
circumstances of the subject event clearly
indicates that the accused/appellant Shakeel
Ahmad Zeb was also sharing common
intention with his co-accomplices qua the
murder of the deceased as well as causing
firearm injuries to the injured/complainant.

18. The learned counsel for the
accused/appellants also laid much stress on
the point that in the case in hand the weapons

of offences i.e. 30 bore pistol & rifle were

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-25-

recovered on the pointation of the
accused/appellants, Abubakar Zeb and
Shakeel Ahmad Zeb vide recovery memo, Ex.
PW-3/7 dated 04.02.2021. Likewise, the crime
empties were also shown recovered from the
spot vide recovery memo, Ex. PW-2/1 on the
same day i.e. 04.02.2021, however, the FSL
report, Ex. PW-9/12 shows that the aforesaid
weapons of offences and crime empties were
sent to the FSL on 08.02.2021 with a delay of
03/04 days, therefore, the positive FSL report
is of no use for the prosecution qua the guilt of
the accused/appellants. Suffice it to say, that
this aspect of the case has elaborately been
clarified by the Investigation Officer of the
subject case, Bakhti Rawan Khan, in his
cross-examination, while appearing in Court
as PW-9, in the following words;-

I have not sent two empties of 30 bore and three
empties of 30 bore to the FSL for comparison
whether fired from one weapon or other. Self-
stated that due to public holidays i.e. Kashmir Day,
Saturday and Sunday the same were not sent to the
FSL.

Therefore, in view of the above

clarification the delayed sending of the
recovered items in the form of weapons of

offence as well as crime empties on the part of

‘Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
‘se

- 26 -

the prosecution was not so fatal or intentional,
therefore, the same would have no bearing
effect qua the guilt of the accused/appellants, in
the subject event, as such, this objection of the
learned counsel for the accused/appellants hold
no water, hence, discarded.

19. Prosecution have also been able to
successfully prove the motive part of the case in
hand which was stated to be a dispute over the
path/way. Such a motive has not been seriously
questioned by the defence side during the
course of cross-examinations of PWs and it
stood proved in circumstances of the case. But
even otherwise weakness or absence of motive
or failure to prove the same would hardly make
any difference in awarding death sentence, as
held by Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in

its judgment rendered in case titled “Waris

Khan v/s The State” reported as 2001 SCMR
387.

20. In light of the above re-appraisal
of the evidence of prosecution coupled with the
legal principles on the subject, the conviction
& sentence recorded by the learned Additional

Sessions Judge-II/ Izafi Zila Qazi, Buner at

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-27-

Daggar, through the impugned order/judgment
dated, 21.12.2021, is upheld & maintained and
consequently, the subject appeal stands

dismissed.

21. The learned trial Court vide the

impugned  order/judgment has rightly |
convicted & sentenced the accused/appellants |
to life imprisonment each after re-appraisal

of the entire evidence, therefore, no case for

enhancement of the sentence awarded to the
accused/respondents could: be made out, as

such, the subject criminal revision filed by

the petitioner/complainant, being bereft of

any merits, is hereby dismissed.
