AHMAD ALL J. - Through the instant appeal under
section 410 Cr.P.C, the appellant namely Nasar Shah
has called in question the judgment dated 27.07.2019
passed by learned Judge Anti-Terrorism Court Matta
(Swat) at Mardan, whereby the appellant was
convicted under sections 324/34, 353/34 PPC, 7(c),
7(h) of ATA and 15-AA in a case FIR No.198 dated
16.09.2016 registered at Police Station Kharkai,

District Mardan.

2. The prosecution story in brief is that the
complainant received an information that some
proclaimed offenders namely Shah Khalid, Nasar
Shah and Akbar Shah are present in the house of on

Zarin Shah situated in village Jewar Banda Alo. Thus,

the complainant along with police party headed by
Fazal Malik Shah raided that place and found there
Dilawar Shah, Zarin Shah along with other
proclaimed offenders. They all, on seeing the police
party started firing upon the police personnel as a
result whereof SHO Fazal Malik and constable Fayaz
Bacha got hit and sustained serious injuries. The
police party in self-defence counter the attack due to
which one proclaimed offender Shah Khalid got hit
and died on the spot; Nasir Shah was arrested along
with arm & ammunition while other proclaimed
offenders namely Akbar Shah, Dilawar Shah and

Zareen Shah made good their escape.

3. After completion of usual investigation,
complete challan against the accused/appellant along
with accused Zarin Shah was submitted. They were
formally charged to which they did not plead guilty
and claimed trial. In order to establish the charges, the
prosecution examined sixteen witnesses. The accused
were also examined under section 342 Cr.P.C wherein
they professed innocence and false implication.
However, they neither examined themselves on Oath

as required under section 340(2) Cr.P.C nor produced

any evidence in their defence. After hearing the
arguments, the learned Judge Anti-Terrorism Court
Matta (Swat) at Mardan acquitted co-accused Zarin
Shah, whereas, appellant was convicted and sentenced
under the above-mentioned charges vide impugned
judgment dated 27.07.2019, however, he stood

acquitted to the extent of remaining charges.

4. During the course of arguments, it transpired
that the learned trial court while recording the
conviction of appellant under sections 324/34, 353/34
PPC, 7(c), 7(h) of ATA and 15-AA, acquitted him
under section 302 PPC and also acquitted him to the
extent of remaining charges levelled again him by
extending him benefit of doubt. The relevant excerpt
from the impugned Judgment is reproduced here-

under:

“As a result of foregoing decision
it is held that the prosecution except
offence _u/s_302 PPC _has proved _ its
case_against the accused facing trial

Nasar Shah, He is, therefore, convicted

and sentenced as follows:

For offence u/s 324/34 PPC to
undergo R.I. for 10 years. He is
also liable to pay fine of
Rs.50,000/- (fifty thousand) and in
default thereof to undergo SI for

three months.

For offence u/s 7(c) ATA to
undergo R.I for 10 years with a
fine of Rs.25,000/- and in default
thereof to undergo SI for three

months.

For offence u/s 353/34 PPC to
undergo R.I for one year with a
fine of Rs.2,000/- and in default
thereof to undergo SI for fifteen

days.

For offence w/s 7(h) ATA to
undergo R.I. for seven years with a
fine of Rs.25,000/- and in default
thereof to undergo SI for three

months.

5. For offence u/s 15-AA to undergo
RI for one year with a fine of
Rs.2,000/- and in default thereof to

undergo SI for fifteen days.

All the sentences shall run
concurrently. Benefit of Section 382-B
Cr.PC is also extended to the convict.
He is, however, acquitted to the extent

of remaining charges levelled again

him by extending him the benefit of

doubt.”

5. From the above underlined sentences, it
came to lime light that the learned trial court on one
hand held that, “prosecution except offence u/s 302
PPC has proved its case against the accused facing
trial Nasar Shah.” meaning thereby that the
prosecution succeeded in proving the remaining
charges against him. Whereas, on the other hand, after
recording the conviction of appellant under sections
324/34, 353/34 PPC, 7(c), 7(h) of ATA and 15-AA,
acquitted him to the extent of remaining charges and

there is no finding with regard to Sections 148 & 149

PPC.

6. The prosecution case mainly hinges upon
Sections 148 & 149 PPC on the score that the
appellant being the member of unlawful assembly, in
prosecution of the common object of that assembly,
being armed with firearms, rioted the police party and
as a result thereof two police personnel got injured,
which establishes aggression of the accused party and
therefore Sections 148 & 149 PPC were added in the
instant case. As per prosecution episode, the firing at
police party was made by five number of persons, of
whom the appellant was arrested on the spot. The
learned trial court left these important sections
unattended as the appellant can be awarded sentence
under sections 324/34, 353/34 PPC and sections 7(c),
7(h) of ATA only when section 148 & 149 PPC are

proved.

7. Although the learned trial court has
specifically mentioned that prosecution proved its
charges against accused/appellant except section 302
PPC which means that Section 148 & 149 PPC are

also proved but no finding with regard to section 148

& 149 PPC are there. The ambiguity popped-up
further from a later verdict where learned trial court is
acquitting the appellant to the extent of remaining
charges levelled against him. Thus, we are of the view
that the mandatory provisions of section 367 Cr.P.C.
have not been followed by the learned trial court.

Section 367, Cr.P.C., reads as follows:-

367. Language of judgment: Contents
of judgment. (1) Every such judgment
shall, except as otherwise expressly
provided by this Code, be written by the
Presiding Officer of the Court (or from
the dictation of such Presiding Officer) in
the language of the Court, or in English;
and shall contain the point or points for
determination, the decision, thereon and
the reasons for the decision; and shall be
dated and signed by the Presiding Officer
in open Court at the time of pronouncing
it (and where it is not written by the
Presiding Officer with his own hand,

every page of such judgment shall be

signed by him).

(2) It shall specify by offence (if any) of
which and the section of the Pakistan
Penal Code or other law under which, the
accused is convicted, and the punishment

to which he is sentenced.

(3) When the conviction is under the Pakistan
Penal Code and it is doubtful under which of
two sections, or under which of two parts of the
same section, of that Code, the offence falls, the
Court shall distinctly express the same, and pass

judgment in the alternative.

(4) Ifit be a judgment of acquittal, it shall state
the offence of which the accused is acquitted

and direct that he be set at liberty.

(5) If the accused is convicted of any offence
punishable with death, the Court sentences him
to any punishment other than death, the Court
shall in its judgment state the reason why

sentence of death was not passed.

(6) For the purposes of this section, an order
under section 118 or section 123, subsection (3)

shall be deemed to be a judgment."

8. It is the mandate of sub-section (2) and (3)
above that when the Court finds accused guilty of one
or more offences, then separate sentence must
explicitly be awarded at the time of recording
conviction. An accused person cannot be presumed or
implied to be convicted under any offence rather the
sentence should be distinct for each and every offence

in which the accused found guilty.

9. Being inseparable and integral part of
conviction, unless specifically awarded, it cannot be
assumed to the prejudice of the accused that he was
also sentenced under sections 148 &149 PPC by
applying the rule of implication because the law
provides the passing of specific sentence for a distinct
offence and if it is not awarded, it cannot be construed
that same was impliedly awarded as it is violative of
the mandatory provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of
section 367 Cr.P.C. which cannot be cured by the
provisions of under section 537 Cr.P.C. Guidance
derived from the judgments of august Apex Court,
reported as 2016 SCMR 1190 titled Irfan and another
Vs. Muhammad Yousaf and another, 2004 SCMR 1

titled Farrukh Sayyar and 2 others Vs. Chairman,

10

NAB, Islamabad and others, and 1997 SCMR 871
titled Sahab Khan and 4 others Vs. The State and

others.

10. Without going into the merits of the case, we
deem it appropriate to remand the case to the learned
trial court for re-writing of the Judgment. Therefore,
appeal is allowed, impugned judgment of the learned
trial court is set aside and the case is remanded back
to the learned trial court with the direction to re-write
the Judgment in view of the above observations,
within one month of the receiving the case-file.

Appeal disposed of accordingly.

Announced.
