AHMAD ALI, J. Through this common
judgment we propose to decide the instant as
well the connected Criminal Appeal bearing
No.973-P/2018 filed under section 417 Cr.P.C,
questioning one and the same judgment dated
29.09.2018 by the complainant as well State,
whereby the learned Additional Sessions Judge-
Il, Kohat, has acquitted the respondents (Ijaz
Khan & Muhammad Shakir) from the charges
levelled against them under section 302/34 PPC,
in case FIR No.1250 dated 20.12.2013,
registered at Police Station MRS (District

Kohat).

2. Brief facts of the prosecution’s case are
that on the eventful day, Miftah-ud-Din ASHO,
received information from PS concerned on

phone, about presence of a dead body lying on

the spot of occurrence, he rushed to the spot,
where he found a dead body alongwith the
complainant Nasir Kamal (PW-2) who disclosed
that the dead body is of his brother Yasir Arafat
and reported the matter to police in terms that on
the day of occurrence, he as usual, went to the
fields and was present at some distance from the
spot of occurrence, when, he saw his brother
Yasir Arafat (deceased), running towards his
house with the accused Ijaz Khan and Shakir,
duly armed with Kalashnikovs, chasing him.
When they reached near Yasir Arafat, both the
accused-respondents opened fire at him due to
which he was put to death on the spot and made
their escape good from the spot. Motive was
stated to be previous enmity between the parties.
Both the accused were charged by the
complainant for the episode. On the basis of
Murasila Ex.PA, FIR ibid was registered against
the accused-respondents.

3. On completion of investigation, challan
was submitted in Court, which indicted the
present respondents for the crime to which they

pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Prosecution

in order to prove its case, examined 12
witnesses in all, whereafter statement of the
accused were recorded, wherein, they professed
their innocence. The learned Trial Court, after
conclusion of trial, acquitted the present
respondents-accused of the charge levelled
against them vide judgment impugned herein
whereagainst the appellant and the State have
filed the above mentioned appeals.

4. We have given our anxious consideration
to the submissions made by the learned AAG
appearing on behalf of the State and perused the
record with his able assistance. Whereas, in the
connected criminal appeal filed by Nasir Kamal,

complainant, no one turned up on his behalf.

5. The ocular account in the instant case
been furnished by the complainant /PW-2 who
was the sole eyewitness in the episode,
therefore, same is crucial for determination of
the fate of the case. It is on record that the
occurrence took place at about 5:40 pm whereas
the call for Maghreb prayer is made after the
sunset. the complainant has categorically stated

in his cross-examination that in the month of

December the sunset occurs at about 05: pm, but
during his examination in chief, he stated that he
saw his brother Yasir Arafat (deceased), running
towards his home, a little while before the
sunset . This contradiction regarding the time of
occurrence creates serious doubt in his version.
If the occurrence has taken place a little while
before the sunset, then the time of occurrence,
as per his own admission during his cross
examination is earlier than 05:00 pm. If time of
occurrence is presumed to be 05:40 pm then it
was not before the sunset rather the occurrence
has taken place in dark hours, after 30/40
minutes of sunset, because in the month of
December at this time full darkness is spread,
and as is admitted by the complainant. Be that
as it may, the complainant has not mentioned
any source of light for the identification of the
deceased and the accused-respondents. Keeping
in view the distance shown in the site plan and
as narrated by the complainant, identification of
respondents is impossible. To dislodge this fact,
the complainant stated that the occurrence took

place a while before the sunset.

6. When the complainant while appearing as
PW-11, after submission of supplementary
challan against accused-respondent No.2,
deposed that the respondents were chasing the
deceased, the deceased turned towards the
accused and they opened fire at him due to
which he was done to death. In his initial report,
the complainant stated that the accused-
respondents were chasing the accused and when
reached the place of occurrence they opened fire
at his deceased brother, resultantly, he got hit
and died on the spot. If his initial report is taken
qua the injuries on the body of the deceased, the
entry should have been on the backside of the
deceased. As per the autopsy report (Ex.PW1/1),
the entry wounds are present on the front side of
the deceased meaning thereby, that the deceased
was fired upon from front side and not from
back side. Though, the complainant, during his
examination in chief, stated that, when reached
to the spot of occurrence, the deceased turned
towards the accused-respondents, however, this
account has never been disclosed by him either

in the initial report or during his 161 Cr.P.C

statement made before the IO. Such stance of
the complainant termed to be improvement to
make his case in accordance with the
postmortem report (Ex.PWI/1). Thus, the
medical evidence does not support the version
of the complainant as disclosed in his initial

report.

7. As per version of the complainant that,
after the occurrence took place, he rushed to his
house for a Cot, remained there for 07 minutes
and returned to the spot within 10 minutes.
Admittedly, his house is situated at a distance of
10 minutes or about 01 km. Earlier, according to
the complainant, he remained with his deceased
brother for about 15 minutes. As per FIR, the
deceased died at the spot, but as per postmortem
report the time that elapsed between the injuries
and death of the deceased is 30 minutes. The
complainant remained with his injured brother
for about 15 minutes but even then he did not
try to shift him to hospital for treatment rather,
he waited for his brother to breath his last and
then left for his home to bring a cot to carry the

dead body, such conduct of the complainant is

not acceptable to the prudent mind.

8. As per the complainant, the local police
and his relatives arrived at the spot after 50
minutes of the occurrence. However, according
to the PW-4 and PW-S5 they reached the spot at
8:30 pm. In this way, not only the record but
also PW-4 & 5 have contradicted the stance of
the complainant regarding their arrival to the
spot. Keeping in view’ the peculiar
circumstances of the case, the time of arrival of
these PWs to the spot has its own importance as
it would, by itself prove the presence of the
complainant on the spot. But, as per cross
examinations of the PW-4 & PW-5, when they
reached the spot at about 8:00 or 8:30 pm, the
dead body was lying on the ground negating the
complainant version. The occurrence has
allegedly taken place at 5:40 pm, the local
police reached the spot at about 8:30 pm and the
dead body was lying at the ground despite of the
specific claim by the complainant that soon after
the occurrence, he rushed to his house, situated
at a distance of 01 km, to bring cot for his

deceased brother. This fact shows that the

complainant was never present at the spot at the

time of occurrence as alleged by him.

9. Record further reveals that the blood as
well as the empties were shown to have been
recovered from one spot within the radius of 4
feet and thereby denying the
assertions/allegations of the complainant that the
accused-respondents fired upon his deceased
brother Yasir Arafat during a hot pursuit. If the
deceased was hit during a pursuit there should
be a trial of blood as well as empties at the spot.
In present case, the recovery of articles, i.e.
blood, empties & blood stained garments, all
being corroborative pieces of evidence, are not
sufficient by themselves to substantiate the
prosecution case as the ocular account itself has
altogether botched.

4. Besides, the complainant is the brother of
deceased, who showed extraordinary strange
conduct after having seen his brother murdered
and tried his level best to suppress certain facts
proving that it was an un-witnessed occurrence
and he had seen just the deceased (then injured)

and not the occurrence in action. Exclusion of

the said witness from consideration would
result that no evidence was left on record to
connect the accused with the crime because the
rest of the evidence is corroborative piece of
evidence. Reference can be made to case law
reported in 1984 SCMR 42, PLD 1981 SC
472, 1972 SCMR_ 578, 2007 SCMR_ 1825,
1990 SCMR 158 & 2011 SCMR 474. Even,
otherwise, testimony of close related witnesses
is required to be scrutinized with great care and
caution, especially when the witness is
interested and inimical and is, thus, likely to
falsely implicate the accused. It is essential to
seek independent corroboration which is
lacking in the instant case. Moreover, while
appreciating the evidence, court had to take into
consideration, omission, improvements,
embellishments etc, had been of such
magnitude that they might materially affect the
trail, and where there are doubts about the
testimony, the Court would insist on
corroboration. Guidance could be safely sought
from the case law laid down in 2015 P.Cr.L.J

81.

10. Complainant/PW2/11 being important
witnesses of the episode was not consistent,
trustworthy and confidence-inspiring. Moreover,
there are glaring contradictions in the statements
of other PWs, which proves that occurrence has
not taken place in the mood, manner, time and
place as alleged by the prosecution.

11. As stated above the witnesses produced
by the prosecution were either not telling the
truth or trying to suppress the actual facts before
the court, therefore, the testimony cannot be
relied upon. A witness who lied about any
material fact must be disbelieved as to all facts.
‘Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus’ is a Latin
phrase meaning “false in one thing, false in
everything”. The rule held that a witness who
lied about any material fact must be disbelieved
as to all facts because of the reason that the
“presumption that the witness will declare the
truth ceases as soon as it manifestly appears that
he is capable of perjury” and that “Faith in a
witness’s testimony cannot be partial or

factional. Guidance could be placed on “PLJ

2019 SC (Criminal Cases) 265”. This view

stems from the notion that once a witness is
found to have lied about a material aspect of a
case, it cannot then be safely assumed that said
witness will declare the truth about any other
aspect of the case. A court of law cannot grant a
license to a witness to tell lies or to mix truth
with falsehood and then take it upon itself to sift
grain from chaff when law of land makes
perjury are testifying falsely a culpable offence.
12. So in the light of above-mentioned
judgment of the Apex Court, the testimony of
witnesses could not be relied upon and uncalled-
for.

13. The learned Trial Court has fully
appreciated the case evidence both, ocular and
circumstantial, in its true perspective and, while
keeping in view, incredible inconsistencies and
grave lacunae going to the very roots of
prosecution case, contradictions in the
statements of the PWs on certain material points
has rightly concluded qua acquittal of the
respondents from the charge levelled against
them. On re-appraisal of case evidence, there is

no room for interference of this Court in the

impugned judgment.

14. In addition, before us is an appeal against
acquittal where standard for appreciation of
evidence is different than the one in appeal
against conviction, as once an accused is
acquitted, then he earns double presumption of
his innocence, which cannot be taken away from
him unless it is shown that the judgment of
acquittal is based on surmises or presumptions,

which is not the case here.

15. In view of the above discussion, this
appeal, being bereft of any merit, is hereby
dismissed in limine.
