SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- At a trial held before
learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, Bannu, in case FIR
No.110 dated 02.6.2009, registered under Section 302/34
PPC at police station Domel, District Bannu, the
accused/respondents were acquitted vide judgment dated
02.12.2014, which has been assailed by the State through
Advocate General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar, by
filing the instant appeal.
2. Facts in brief as spelt out from the first
information report are that on 02.6.2009 at 1620 hours,
complainant Laiq Nawaz alias Laknavi (PW-9) brought the
dead body of his brother Zainullah to police station Domel
where he made report to the effect that he alongwith his
brother were present in their Hujra, meanwhile, accused

Rashid Khan and another unknown person, duly armed with
-2-

Kalashnikovs came there and asked from his brother
Zainullah about him (complainant) to which Zainullah
replied that Laiq Zaman is his brother, then Zainullah
brought cold drink (Sharbat) from home and after taking
the same, both the accused made firing with their respective
weapons with the intention to commit qatl-i-amd of his
brother Zainullah. As a result of firing, he was hit and
injured. Accused decamped from the spot after the
occurrence. He could do noting being empty-handed and
when he attended his brother, by then he had succumbed to
his injuries. On the report of complainant instant case vide
the captioned FIR was registered against the accused.
Subsequently, on 07.6.2009, the complainant in his
supplementary statement, charged unknown co-accused to
be Subhan Ali, for the commission of offence.

3. Initially, accused absconded, therefore, they
were proceeded against under Section 512, Cr.P.C.
Consequently, they were declared proclaimed offender.
Later on, accused were arrested and on completion of the
investigation, complete challan was submitted before the
trial Court. Accused were charged for the offence to which
they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order to prove
its case, the prosecution examined as many as twelve
witnesses, whereafter, the accused were examined under
Section 342, Cr.P.C, wherein they denied the allegations

and professed innocence, however, they neither opted to be
-3-

examined under Section 340(2), Cr.P.C. nor wished to
produce defence. The learned trial Court heard arguments
from both the sides and vide impugned judgment dated
02.12.2014, acquitted the accused/respondents, hence this
appeal.

4. It is worth mentioning that the instant appeal
was admitted to regular hearing on 10.12.2015 and
accused/respondents were summoned. The respondent
Subhan Ali put his appearance and submitted power of
attorney, whereas respondent Rashidullah was reported to
be dead and in this respect copy of FIR No.389 dated
12.10.2015 was produced which revealed that Mst.
Haleema Bibi had reported the matter regarding murder of
her brother Rashidullah and his father Taj Muhammad,
hence proceedings to the extent of accused/respondent
Rashidullah stand abated.

5. Arguments heard and record gone through.

6. It was on 02.6.2009 that complainant Laiq
Nawaz alias Laknavi (PW-9) brought the dead body of his
brother Zainullah to police station Domel where he made
report to the effect that he alongwith his brother were
present in their Hujra, meanwhile, accused Rashid Khan
and another unknown person, duly armed with
Kalashnikovs came there and asked from his brother
Zainullah about him (complainant) to which Zainullah

replied that Laiq Zaman was his brother, then whereafter
-4-

Zainullah the deceased went home and brought cold drinks
(Sharbat) and was served to the accused/ respondents, who
after drinking the same, started firing at the deceased with
their respective weapons with the intention to kill. The
deceased got hit and fell down and the accused/ respondents
decamped from the spot. When he attended his brother, he
had expired.

7. The incident occurred in the Hujra of the
complainant where he alongwith the deceased was present
when the respondents approached and that after they were
served with cold drinks, they resorted to firing where the
deceased lost his life. The record is silent that why the
accused came to the Hujra and that why only the deceased
was selected to be killed despite the reason that no previous
ill-will or grudge was there between the parties. The
conduct of the complainant is not above board that when
there was no particular purpose with the deceased and that
when on reaching the Hujra the assailants could have
accomplished their task then what for they kept waiting and
facilitated the deceased to go home and bring cold drinks as
the very purpose was to kill and the opportunity was there.
This is again surprising that only the deceased was targeted
and the complainant was spared when both of them were
the easiest targets. The conduct of the complainant is
unnatural and his presence on the spot disturbs the mind

that why the assailants asked for his introduction from his

-5-

brother and that why the deceased did not tell that who the
assailants were.

8. The spot is the Hujra of the complainant and
both the assailants resorted to indiscriminate firing but no
bullet marks were found on the surrounding walls or on the
cot where the deceased was sitting, which fact creates a
serious doubt regarding the place of occurrence and mode
and manner as alleged by the complainant. The complainant
was examined as PW-09, who could not explain that
whether at the time of firing the deceased was sitting on the
cot or was in standing position and even when the deceased
succumbed to his injuries he did not try to shift him to the
cot and even his clothes and hands were not besmeared
with blood. This unnatural conduct of the complainant casts
doubt regarding his truthfulness.

9. The record is silent that what prompted the
assailants to kill the deceased and even the Investigating
Officer could not collect anything in this respect. The
complainant stated that both the accused / respondents
entered their Hujra, where he knew one accused by name,
whereas the co-accused was not known to him and it was
on the next day that his supplementary statement was
recorded where he disclosed the unknown accused as
Subhan Ali. Our curiosity beings that when the co-accused
Rashid Khan was known to him then why the assailants

asked his introduction from his brother being from the same
-6-

locality. It was on the next day when through a
supplementary statement the complainant introduced the
unknown as Subhan Ali, but when he was examined as PW-
09, he did not explain that how he came to know that the
unknown accused was Subhan Ali and even the
Investigating Officer could not bring anything on record to
have confirmed the source wherefrom the information was
gathered.

10. The Investigating Officer recovered three
empties of 7.62 bore alongwith blood stained earth from the
spot and prepared the site-plan on pointation of the
complainant, but neither the jug nor the glasses were taken
into possession. The circumstances tell that the deceased at
the time of incident was all alone and that the complainant
was not present on the spot and it was later on when his
attendance was procured and the respondents were charged.

In case titled) “Muhammad Hussain Vs_the

State” (2017 YLR Note 12), it is held that:

“Similarly, law is also quite settled
on the point that evidence adduced
by interested and chance witnesses
has to be scrutinized with great care
and caution and an independent and
impartial testimony is required to
believe them which is missing in this

case.”

11. The report is silent regarding the name of the

co-accused as initially the complainant mentioned him as

-7-

unknown and it was through a supplementary statement that
his name was introduced as Subhan Ali. The respondent
was arrested on 10.12.2011 where after he was produced
for custody before the Court of Judicial Magistrate and later
on was lodged in the judicial lock up, after his arrest the
complainant was informed and identification parade was
arranged in the Central Jail, Bannu, where the respondent
was identified. This court is to see as to whether the
identification parade was conducted after observing all the
legal formalities and as to whether the accused was duly
identified. We are surprised to see that on the next day of
the occurrence the complainant through a supplementary
statement disclosed the identity of the respondent as
Subhan Ali then what was the need for conducting
identification parade, when the accused was already known
to the complainant. The report is silent regarding the
features of the respondent but simply the complainant has
stated that if the accused was brought before him, he can
identify. Though the identification parade was conducted
but neither any specific role was given to the respondent at
the time of occurrence nor were the requirements fulfilled.
This is admitted on record that it was after 23-days of the
arrest of the respondent that the identification parade was
conducted but the prosecution could not explain that what
caused the delay. Though the complainant stated that he

had gone for Tableegh and that it was on his coming back

-8-

that he was informed and the accused was got identified but
his this explanation holds no ground as no material was
collected by the Investigating Officer to substantiate his
claim. The Judicial Magistrate in whose supervision the
identification parade was conducted was examined as PW-
12, who stated that the accused was produced before him
for his physical custody on 12.12.2011, and again for
another round where further one day custody was granted.
PW-12, admitted it correct that when the respondent was
brought before him he was not muffled. He also admitted
that possibility cannot be excluded that the witnesses would
have an opportunity of seeing the respondent. The learned
Judicial Magistrate, stated that while conducting
identification parade the respondent complained that the
complainant was provided an opportunity to visit him in
Central Jail, Bannu before the identification parade, when
this is the status of the identification parade then it cannot
be relied upon to convict the respondent.

In case titled Amanullah_Vs. Muhammad

Asfhag and another (2018 YLR Note Peshawar_169), it

was held that:-

“Of course, there is an identification
parade of the appellants by identifier
Muhammad Abbas (PW-11) but such
identification parade has no evidentiary
worth as same had taken place on
22.11.2012 and prior to holding the
identification parade, the appellants were
produced before the learned Judge Anti-
Terrorism  Court-II, Peshawar on
01.11.2012 and the possibility of their

-9-

showing to the identifier cannot be ruled

out, therefore, no importance could be

attached to the identification parade.

Besides, the identifier did not point out

the specific role played by the appellants

in the crime. It is by now well settled that

in order to make an identification parade

reliable one, the identifier must assign

the specific role, which the perpetrator

has played in the crime. As _ the

identification parade is silent on the ibid

aspect and had taken place at a belated

stage of the appellants' arrest, therefore,

no explicit reliance could be placed upon

it for the safe administration of justice”.
12. The Investigating Officer recovered three
empties of 7.62 bore from the spot, which were sent to the
office of chemical examiner with a request to tender its
opinion, as to whether these were fired from one or
different weapons, the report has been exhibited as Ex:
PW10/6, where these empties were shown fired from one
and the same weapon. The deceased has three inlet wounds
and three empties were recovered from the spot with
opinion from the Forensic Sciences Laboratory as having
been fired from one and the same weapon belies the stance
of the complainant regarding the involvement of two
accused in commission of the offence.
13. Besides the above, generally the order of
acquittal cannot be interfered with because the presumption
of innocence of the accused is further strengthened by
acquittal. The golden thread which runs through the web of

administration of justice in criminal cases is, that, if two

views are possible on the evidence adduced in the case, one

aw

Ab

-10-

pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to his
innocence, the view which is favourable to the accused
should be adopted. The paramount consideration of the
Court is to ensure that miscarriage of justice is prevented. A
miscarriage of justice which may arise from acquittal of the
guilty is no less than from the conviction of an innocent. In
a case where admissible evidence is ignored, a duty is
casted upon the appellate Court to re-appreciate the
evidence in a case where the accused has been acquitted, or
the purpose of ascertaining as to whether the accused
committed the offence or not. The principle to be followed
by this Court considering the appeal against the judgment
of acquittal is, to interfere only when there are compelling
and substantial reasons for doing so. If the impugned
judgment is clearly unreasonable, it is a compelling reason
for interference.

14, For the reasons mentioned hereinabove, this

appeal being without merit and substance is hereby

dismissed.
