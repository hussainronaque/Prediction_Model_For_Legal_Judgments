2. Facts forming the background of
the instant case FIR No. 68 are that on
25.07.2021 complainant Haji Rafiq son of Siyal
Jan reported the matter in the causality Lady
Reading Hospital, Peshawar to the effect that
he alongwith his brother Tanzeemullah and
relative Adil and Muhammad Imran were

proceeding on their motorcycles towards
Shahkas Khyber Police Training Center, the
complainant was present alongwith the
deceased on his 125 Honda motorcycle
whereas, his brother Tanzeemullah was
present on his motorcycle driven by Adil; that
when they reached to the place of occurrence,
accused Gul Shah Ali, Ghous Ali and Hussain,
were present on the road side duly armed with
deadly weapons; that the accused on seeing
them, started firing at them as a result of which
the complainant party received firearm injuries;
that Imran succumbed to his injuries while on
the way to the hospital; that motive behind the
occurrence is previous blood feud; that the
occurrence was witnessed by the complainant
and other injured; that from the firing of
accused, the motorcycle was also damaged;
that the accused petitioners were charged for
the commission of the offence hence, the
present FIR.

3. Facts in brief of the Cr.A No. 950-
P/2023 titled “Gul Shah Alf vs Haji Rafiq &
others” are that in the incident the appellant
Gul Shah Ali also received firearm injuries
therefore, Abdullah Jan ASI alongwith another

Police official went to Khyber Teaching
Hospital, Peshawar where the appellant Gul
Shah Ali reported the matter to the effect that
he was proceeding on his 70 CC motorcycle
from his village towards the house of his sister
Mst. Wara wife of Abdullah situated at Bai Kor;
that he was duly armed with Kalashnikov; that
when he reached to the place of occurrence,
Haji Rafiq boarding a motorcycle with Imran
and Tanzeemullah with Adii, all duly armed
with their respective firearms, came there and
started firing at him as a result of which he
teceived firearm injuries on his body; that he
also resorted to firing; that motive behind the
occurrence is previous blood feud; that the
accused have received money for his killing;
that the occurrence was witnessed by other
persons present at the place of occurrence;
that the accused were charged for the
commission of offence hence, the daily diary
No. 20 dated 25.07.2021.

4, After completion of investigation,
complete challan was put in court. Provisions
of section 265-C CrPC were complied with. As
there are two set of accused one i.e. Gul Shah
Ali and Ghous Ali and the other i.e. Adil, Haji

Rafiq and Tanzeemullah therefore, the learned
trial court charge sheeted them separately to
which both set of accused pleaded not guilty
and claimed trial. In order to prove its claim, the
prosecution produced and examined as many
as 18 witnesses. After closure of prosecution
evidence, statements of both set of accused
were recorded under section 342 CrPC,
wherein both set of accused posed innocence,
however, neither they wished to be examined
on Oath as required under section 340 (2)
Cr.PC, nor wanted to produce evidence in
defence. The leamed trial Court, after full-
fledged trial acquitted one set of accused i.e.
Haji Rafiq, Adil and Tanzeemullah whereas,
the other set of accused i.e. Gul Shah Ali and
Ghous Ali were convicted and sentenced vide
the impugned judgment, hence, these appeals.
5. Arguments of learned counsel for
the parties and learned AAG representing the
State were heard and record scanned through
with their valuable assistance.

6. The heart wrenching incident
Claimed the life of one, leaving behind three
injured from the side of the complainant,
whereas, the appellant himself received a

firearm injury. The injured were collected from
the spot and were hurriedly shifted to the
hospitals. The complainant and the injured of
the instant case were taken to Lady Reading
Hospital, Peshawar whereas, the appellant
being injured was brought to Khyber Teaching
Hospital (KTH), Peshawar. The complainant
reported the matter to one Abdullah Jan ASI,
who dictated the same to Sajjad Khan ASI. The
injury sheets of the injured were prepared and
the injured were examined by the doctor. After
medical examination the doctor prepared the
medico-legal certificates of the injured. Though
the deceased Muhammad Imran was brought
to the hospital where he was found dead, but
the concerned police officials shifted his dead
body to RHC Ekka Ghund, his injury sheet and
inquest report were prepared. The dead body
was shifted for postmortem examination.

7. As in the incident the appellant
also received a firearm injury, so he reported
the matter in the hospital to the same police
officials, to whom report of the instant case was
made. The information of the appellant was
collected in the shape of daily diary No. 20. As
the appeliant was injured, so his injury sheet

was prepared, was examined by the doctor and
his medico-legal certificate was prepared. The
appellant while reporting the matter explained
the manner in which the incident occurred and
he charged the complainant of the instant case,
the injured eye witnesses and the deceased for
firing at him. The investigating officer after
receiving copies of both the reports, visited the
spot and prepared the site plan. While
inspecting spot in the instant case, the
investigating officer collected blood through
cotton from the respective places of the injured
and the deceased. During spot inspection, 07
empties of 7.62 bore were collected from the
spot. The same were sent to the firearms
expert to ascertain that from how many
weapons the same were fired. A report was
received telling that the same were fired from
different weapons.

8. As the appellant had also reported
the matter in shape of DD No. 20, so the
investigating officer also prepared another site
plan and he also collected blood from a place
where the appellant was shown lying in injured
condition. During investigation brother of
deceased Muhammad Imran, produced a

motorcycle belonging to the deceased and the
same was taken into possession on
27.07.2021. As the injured appellant was also
riding on motorcycle at the time of incident, so
the same was also taken into possession. The
appellant was arrested in the hospital whereas,
his co-accused went into hiding. As one of the
co-accused i.e. Ghous Ali was undergoing his
training in Shahkas Training Center, so he was
arrested by the police from the place of his
training and in that respect his card of arrest
was prepared. The custody of the appellant
was requested by the local police, but as the
appellant had received a firearm injury, so he
could not be shifted from hospital to the police
station, so his custody was declined, however,
directions were issued, by the learned judicial
magistrate, to place him in the hospital, under
detention, till he recovers. When the condition
of the appellant improved, he was produced
before the judicial magistrate, but the appellant
could not be remanded in police custody, as he
was not fully recovered. The appellant was
sent to the judicial lock-up. As the complainant
and the injured eye witnesses were arrested in
DD No. 20, so the accused from both sides

faced the trial and on conclusion of the trial the
10

learned trial court was pleased to acquit the
accused charged for the injuries caused to the
appellant whereas, the appellant alongwith his
co-accused were convicted and sentenced vide
the impugned judgment.

9. The learned trial court on
conclusion of the trial held the appellants
responsible for the tragic incident, whereas, the
accused charged for the injuries caused to the
appellant earned acquittal. This court is to see
as to what led the trial court to conclude the
matter in that manner and that whether the
reasons given find support from record of the
case and that whether the learned judge
succeeded in appreciating the collected
evidence and the statements of the witnesses.
As admittedly, the appellant also received a
firearm injury in the same episode, so this court
is to see that whether the learned trial court
was justified to acquit one set of accused and
to convict the appellants, but on what basis.
Record tells that the injured of both the cases
were hurriedly shifted to the hospitals and both
the sides reported the matter to the local police
who visited the hospitals. As the time of

occurrence, the place of occurrence and the
11

time of report are one and the same, so this
court is to see as to who was responsible for
the tragic incident, who initiated and that who is
the worst sufferer. Though the impugned
judgment contains the detailed reasons, but in
our understanding it failed to appreciate the
attending circumstances of the present case
and it failed to give plausible reasons for the
acquittal of the accused charged by the
appellant. In order to appreciate the individual
liability of both the parties we deem it essential
to scan through the record and we deem it
appropriate to re-assess the evidence on file,
so in that eventuality we would be in a position
to fix the liabilities and we would be in a
position to appreciate the approach of the
learned trial court. We are confident in holding
that the appellant received a firearm injury in
the same transaction, so his presence on the
spot at the stated time is neither doubtful nor
disputed. Even the report of the appellant
leaves no ambiguity that the appellant
accepted his part in the incident, but in a
different manner. We are anxious to know that
how the incident occurred and that in what

manner. Had the appellant suppressed the
12

firing he made, then the matter was easy to
appreciate and it was more easy for the courts
to fix the liabilities but, as the appellant did not
suppress the damage caused to the
opponents, so the complexity of the case has
dramatically changed and in the changed
circumstances the approach must be dynamic
and pragmatic. We are intending to re-
appreciate the record of the case and we are
inclined to re-consider the role played by the
either side, so that the guilty could be punished
and the innocent could be rescued.

10. The points for determination
before this court are as to whether the incident
occurred in the mode, manner and at the
stated time; as to whether the witnesses were
present on the spot and, that they did not
conceal the material facts; as to whether the
witnesses remained consistent in respect of the
incident and, that the matter was reported at
the stated time and in the stated manner; as to
whether the report of the appellant in the shape
of daily diary No. 20 is sufficient to hold the
injured witnesses responsible for the injuries
caused to him; as to who was the aggressor

and who was aggressed upon; as to whether
13

the appellant was left with the only choice to
retaliate for saving his life; as to whether the
appellant acted in self defence, if so, what
benefit would accrue to him and, as to whether
the prosecution succeeded in bringing home
guilt against the appellants.

11. in order to appreciate the essence
of the matter we deem it essential to take into
consideration the reports of the parties and the
statements of the witnesses of both the cases.
As admittedly, the presence of the appellant is
established on record and as the eye
witnesses received injuries in the episode, so
their presence on the spot is neither disputed
nor doubtful. Once this court comes to the
conclusion that both the parties i.e. appellant
and the injured of the instant case were
present on the spot, then it is obligatory for this
court to determine the manner in which the
incident occurred and to determine the manner
in which the appellant also received the firearm
injury. In order to resolve the controversy, we
deem it essential to go through the statements
of the complainant, the injured eye witness, the
scribe alongwith the investigating officer. The

complainant was examined as PW-12, who
14

explained that how they reached to the place of
incident and that how the incident occurred.
The complainant did not disclose that in the
episode the appellant also received a firearm
injury, collected from the spot and was shifted
to the hospital. in order to appreciate the
conduct of the complainant we deem it
essential to take into consideration both the
reports. It is interesting to note that the
complainant suppressed the injuries caused to
the appellant and instead, while reporting the
matter, he charged the appellant alongwith two
others for the commission of the offence
whereas, on the other hand the appellant in his
report disclosed that on reaching to the place
of incident he was fired at by the complainant
and others and to save his life, he also resorted
to firing. He further explained that after
receiving firearm injury he fell on the ground,
and was shifted to the hospital by the people of
locality. The appellant explained the
circumstances, he did not conceal the injuries
caused to the other side and he disclosed that
the tragic incident occurred because of
previous blood feud between the parties. Both

the reports left no ambiguity that soon after the
15

incident the injured from both the sides were
shifted to the hospital and initially, the
complainant reported the matter, their injury
sheets were prepared, but the same police
Officials also visited the hospital where the
appellant was admitted. It was one hour after
the report of the complainant that the report of
the appellant was penned down, and no
ambiguity is left, that the delay of one hour
between the two reports was explained by the
witnesses. As after the report was made by the
complainant, the injury sheets were prepared,
SO it took time to complete, and thereafter the
same police officials visited the appellant in
Khyber Teaching Hospital. The arrival of the
injured appellant to the hospital was duly
entered in the relevant register, the doctor who
examined the appellant and the Incharge
casualty Khyber Teaching Hospital also
recorded their statements. The doctor was
examined as PW- 9 who disclosed the time of
arrival of the injured appellant and the time of
his examination. She also disclosed that
appellant received an entry wound on his right
iliac fossa (RIF) with its exit on his buttock.

Similarly, the police official who _ initially
16

prepared the injury sheet was examined as
PW-11 who explained that on arrival of the
injured, his initial injury sheet was prepared by
him. The statements of these witnesses have
confirmed the injury caused to the appellant
and they also confirmed that the appellant was
brought to the hospital within the shortest
possible time. The quick succession of events
leave no ambiguity in holding that the appellant
had no time to consult and there was no
consultation and deliberation on his part. It is
pertinent to mention that after the complainant
charged the appellant, the officials who visited
the hospital arrested the appellant and
prepared his card of arrest. At the same time
when the appellant reported the matter, the
complainant and injured of the present case
were arrested and their cards of arrest were
prepared. The appellant, Ghous Ali was
arrested from Police Training Center, Shahkas,
on the next day of the incident. The
investigating officer visited the hospitals and
collected record regarding treatment of the
parties and the same was placed on file.

12. The nature of injury of the

appellant can be assessed from the fact that
17

his physical custody was refused on the day of
his arrest and even on the subsequent dates,
when he got a little recovered. The order of
judicial magistrate is placed on file which tells
that the request of the investigating officer for
the grant of custody was lastly declined, and
the appellant was remanded to judicial lock-up
because of his injury. As the deceased lost his
life while enroute to the hospital, so he was
brought to Lady Reading Hospital and from
there was shifted to the concerned hospital for
postmortem examination. The record tells that
the matter was reported by both the parties
without loss of time, so the factor of
consultation and deliberation can easily be
excluded. The moot question for determination
for this court is that how the incident occurred,
who was responsible for initiating the tragedy
and that what role was played by the appellant.
As both the parties reached to the place of
incident and as both the parties received
firearm injuries, so no ambiguity is left that both
the parties were equally responsible for the
tragic incident. As one of the party suppressed
the injuries caused to the other, so the conduct

of the complainant and all related, is not above
18

board. Had the appellant not received an injury
that too on the most vital part of his body then
the report of the complainant and the death of
the deceased would have easily determined
the fate of the appellant, but as while reporting
the matter in the shape of DD No. 20 the
appellant did not conceal the material facts and
he admitted that as he was fired at, so to save
his life, he also resorted to firing. The
investigating officer while preparing the site
plans also collected blood from the place away
from the places of the injured of the instant
case and he also explained that the place of
the appellant was pointed by the people of
locality. When the witness was questioned
regarding the distance of the appellant from the
complainant, he disclosed that the blood was
recovered 100 meter away, from the places of
the injured witnesses. If, the statement of the
investigating officer is taken to be correct, then
at the same time we would accept the
statement of the appellant regarding the firing
made at him, by the complainant party. As the
respective places were pointed out by the
people, more particularly, the place of the

appellant, so no ambiguity is left that the
19

incident was witnessed by the villagers, but
their statements could not be recorded for the
reasons best known to the investigating officer.
When admittedly, the appellant received a
serious injury, and when the matter was
promptly reported, so we are confident in
holding that the appellant told the whole truth,
but the complainant suppressed the material
facts. The injury of the appellant is the
determining factor and that would determine
the role played by the appellant. There is no
denial to this fact that both of the parties were
not residing near the place of incident, but their
arrival to the spot is a circumstance which has
increased the anxiety of this court and we are
anxious to resolve the same. The appellant in
his report stated that he left for the house of his
sister and that he was armed with a
Kalashnikov. He also admitted that on reaching
to the place of incident, the complainant party
came on two moforcycles and started firing at
him. In the same breath the appellant admitted
his role of firing and in our understanding he
reported what he observed and he disclosed
the roles played by both the parties. When the

place was not common to the parties, then this
20

court is to see that who was the aggressor and
who was aggressed upon. As record is silent
that who was present on the spot and who
arrived thereafter, so the factum of aggression
cannot be determined and even the witnesses
failed to convince. When such is the state of
affairs, then this court is under the obligation to
assess the roles played by both the parties, on
the basis of available record, and on the basis
of injuries caused and received. The
motorcycles of the deceased and the
complainant were produced after few days of
the incident and the same also confirmed the
manner in which the incident occurred. Though
the learned trial court burdened the appellants
with the injuries caused to the complainant and
his companions, yet, it failed to give justiciable
reasons for the same. The learned trial court
was highly swayed with the damage caused to
the complainant party, but it failed to appreciate
the injuries received by the appellant and it
failed to take into consideration the report of
the appellant. Had the learned trial court
appreciated the evidence of both the parties,
then in our understanding instead of rushing to

acquit and rushing to convict, it would have
21

done complete justice to the parties. We could
not come across the reasons which
distinguished the case of the appellants from
that of the complainant and even while
acquitting the complainant and others the
learned trial court failed to advance sufficient
and necessary reasons. The suppression of
facts by the complainant in his report is a
circumstance which cannot be ignored and it
by itself is sufficient to question the credibility of
the complainant and others.

13. The attending circumstances of
the present case invite the attention of this
court to sections 96, 97, 100 and 102 of the
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (‘The Act’). We
cannot ignore the intent of the legislature while
making these sections part of the book. As the
legislature was conscious of the like
circumstances, so it took measures to protect
the one, who faces the like situation. The
wisdom behind was to extend the right to
protect one’s self from an act of aggression
and from an activity which towards the end
would claim his life. Section 97 of the Act, is
unambiguous and it explains that to act in self

defence would not be an offence. For ease of
22

reference, the relevant section is reproduced,

which reads as follows:

97. Right of private defence of the
body_and_of property: - Every

person has a right, subject to the
restrictions contained in Section 99,
to defend; First: His own body, and
the body of any other person, against
any offence affecting the human
body;

Secondly: The property, whether
movable or immovable, of himself or
of any other person, against any act
which is an offence falling under the
definition of theft, robbery, mischief
or criminal trespass, or which is an
attempt to commit theft, robbery,
mischief or criminal trespass.

The matter does not end here, rather the
Code has further explained in section 100, the
limits to act in self defence, so for ease of
reference section 100 is reproduced, which

reads as follows:

“When the right of private defence
of the body extends to causing

death: The right of private defence of
the body extends, under the
restrictions mentioned in the last
preceding section, to the voluntary
causing of death or of any other
23

harm to the assailant, if the offence
which occasions the exercise of the
right be of any of the descriptions
hereinafter enumerated, namely: -

First! Such an assault as may
reasonably cause the
apprehension that death will
otherwise be the consequence of
such assault;

Secondly: Such an assault as
may reasonably cause the
apprehension that grievous hurt
will otherwise be the

consequence of such assault:

Thirdly: An assault with the
intention of committing rape;

Fourthly: An assault with the
intention of gratifying unnatural
lust.

Fifthly: An assault with the
intention of kidnapping or
abduction.

Sixthly: An assault with the
intention of wrongfully confining a
person, under circumstances
which may reasonably cause him
to apprehend that he will be
unable to have recourse to the
public authorities for his release.
24

The combined reading of the above
sections leave no ambiguity that the appellant
acted in self defence and the injury caused to
him was on the vital part of his body, so in our
understanding the appellant was deserving the
extended concession, but the learned trial court
failed to consider the most essential, and the
most crucial aspect of this case. Similar
circumstances came before the apex court and
the same were answered, in case titled titled
Abdul Rashid Vs Nazir Hussain and 5
OTHERS (1971 S C M R 284), in the
following manner: -

“Although, the injuries on the
persons of Nazir Hussain and Noor
Muhammad were suppressed by the
prosecution, this came to light
because they had voluntarily
appeared for examination before the
same doctor who had held the
post-mortem examination of the
dead body of Mehraj Din. However,
the injury No. 1 which was a
contused wound " x1/8" x1" deep
extending upwards under the skin
on the back of the head sustained
by Nazir Hussain is on a vital part of
the body, although it did not cause
any grievous hurt. Such injury on the
vital part of the body must have
25

caused a reason able apprehension
in the mind of Nazir Hussain that his
life was in danger or his body in risk
of grievous hurt. Accordingly, he had
the right of private defence of his
person which, under section 100 of
the Penal Code, extended to the
causing of death of Mehraj Din.”

14. Though the attention of this court
was invited to the statement of accused
recorded under section 342 Cr.PC where, the
appellant denied to have fired over the
complainant party, but that alone will not be
sufficient, as on the very day of the occurrence
the appellant reported the matter and he
explained the circumstances in which the
incident occurred. The appellant from the very
beginning accepted the firing over the
complainant and others, but at the same time
he explained the circumstances which
compelled him to retaliate, if not then he would
have been killed. In our understanding the
appellant travelled with honesty and he did not
suppress the injuries caused to the opponents.
As in this case, right from the beginning the
appellant accepted the firing made by him, but

he also explained the circumstances which put
26

him in the situation. In our understanding the
courts of law, even by itself, can deduce the
circumstances which put an accused to fire and
from those circumstances the courts can
presume that had he not fired, then his death
was certain. As in this particular case, the
appellant in his report explained the
circumstances and even the investigating
officer confirmed the same while preparing the
site plans, so we are confident in holding that
the appellant faced a situation where the only
option left was to fire. This view is further
substantiated by a celebrated judgment from
the Indian jurisdiction reported as "Munshi
Ram and others Vs. Delhi Administration
(AIR 1968 SC 7021. The question whether an
accused can get benefit of the circumstances
showing that he acted in his defence, though
he did not take that plea specifically, the august

Supreme Court of India held that:

‘It is well settled that even an
accused, does not plead self
defence’ it is open to the court to
consider such a plead the same
arises from the material on
record..., The burden of
establishing that plea is on the
27

accused and that burden can be
discharged by showing
preponderance of probabilities in
favour of that plea on the basis of

the material on record.”

15. The learned trial court fell into
error while fixing the liabilities. Had it
appreciated the essence of the matter, then
there was hardly an occasion to reach to such
a conclusion, the conclusion which is in conflict
with the law on the subject. As the complainant
and others were equally responsible for the
tragic incident and, as many as four persons
chased the appellant Gul Shah Ali, fired at him,
so there was no option but to retaliate. The
appellant succeeded in rescuing himself, but
he could not succeed to avoid the danger and,
as such, he received an injury on the most vital
part of the body. Though his seat of injury
confirms his presence on the spot, but it
explains that what he did, was done only to
exercise his right of self defence. We are
confident in holding that the learned trial court
failed to appreciate this essential aspect of the
case, so while appreciating the same, this court

holds that the appellants deserve the same
28

concession as was extended to the
respondents. The instant criminal is allowed,
the impugned is set aside and the appellants
are acquitted of the charge levelled against
them. They be released forthwith, if not
required to be detained in any other criminal
case.

16. Now diverting to Cr.A No. 950-
P/2023 titled “Gul Shah Ali vs Haji Rafiq &
others” through which the appellant Gul Shah
Ali has impugned before us the judgment of the
learned trial court to the extent of acquittal of
respondents/accused Haji Rafiq, Tanzeemullah
and Adil, suffice it to say that both the parties
received firearm injuries, both the parties were
hurriedly shifted to the hospital in injured
condition, more particularly, the deceased
Muhammad Imran lost his life in the same
episode, so no ambiguity is left that the
Presence of the injured witnesses and the
injured appellant is established on record, that
too when the appellant reported the matter in
the shape of daily diary No. 20 on the same
day. As the injured appellant i.e. Gul Shah Ali
reported the matter and did not conceal the

material facts, so no ambiguity is left that these
29

were the respondents, who concealed the
material facts from the investigating agency
and from the learned trial court, as well. As the
appellant received a fire arm injury on the vital
part of his body and as from the other side one
lost his life and three received serious injuries,
so this is the uncertainty of events which led
the learned trial court to decide the matter in
that manner. As the appellant Gul Shah Ali and
Ghous Ali are acquitted of the charge, that too,
on the basis of suppression of facts and that
there remained an uncertainty as to who was
the aggressor and who was aggressed upon,
so the benefit of the same has rightly been
