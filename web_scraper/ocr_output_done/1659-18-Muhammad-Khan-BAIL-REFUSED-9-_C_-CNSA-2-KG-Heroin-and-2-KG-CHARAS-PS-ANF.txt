SHAKEEL AHMAD:-J: Through the instant petition, the

accused-petitioner Muhammad Khan son of Azeem Khan,

seeks post arrest bail in crime No.64 dated 22.04.2018

registered under section-9 (c) of the Control of Narcotic

Substances Act, 1997, (““CNSA”), at Police Station ANF,

Peshawar.

2. It is the case of the prosecution that on

22.4.2018, Incharge of Police Station ANF received a spy

information that huge quantity of narcotics would be

smuggled from Nowshera to Punjab through vehicle bearing

registration No.LIC-579, on this the complainant (S.I Sajjad

Dar) alongwith constables Naeem Abas, Muhammad Hayat
and other officials started surveillances on the spot at the

instruction of incharge of Police Station ANF. In the

meanwhile at 19.15 hours, the vehicle in question arrived on

the spot, which was signaled to stop; that the driver of the

vehicle was overpowered with the help of police officials,

who disclosed his name as Muhammad Khan and the front

seater disclosed his name as Shahzeb. The petitioner and co-

accused admitted concealment of contraband in the vehicle.

The vehicle was brought to police station, where it was

searched, which led to the recovery of two KGs heroin and

two KGs charas from its secret cavities, resultantly, the

petitioner and co-accused were arrested. Vide order dated

10.7.2018, the learned Judge Special Court, (CNS) declined

bail to the petitioner, hence this petition.

3. It has been argued by the learned counsel for

the petitioner that he is innocent and has falsely been

implicated. He next argued that the alleged contraband was

recovered from the secret cavities of the vehicle and

petitioner being its driver had no conscious knowledge of

the same. He lastly argued that it is not the maximum
punishment, but ultimate sentence which is likely to be

imposed be taken into consideration for the purpose of bail

because question of sentence must commensurate with the

quantum of guilt.

4. Conversely, the learned Special Prosecutor

appearing on behalf of ANF vehemently opposed the

contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner and

contended that heroin weighing two KGs and charas

weighing two KGs were recovered from inside door of the

vehicle which was being driven by the accused, therefore, he

can be saddled with criminal liability. He next contended

that FSL report regarding charas and heroin were sufficient

to show that substance recovered from the vehicle was

charas and heroin, which could be used to cause

intoxication. He lastly contended that categorization of

sentence or guess work or speculative exercise cannot be

taken by the Court at bail stage and prayed for dismissal of

the bail petition.
5. I have heard arguments of the learned counsel

for the parties and have gone through the record with their

eminent assistance.

6. Scanning of the record reflects that heroin

weighing two KGs and charas weighing two KGs were

recovered from inside right door of the vehicle, which was

being driven by the petitioner. It is now settled that driver

cannot be absolved from the liability, if contraband are

being transported in the doors of the vehicle being driven by

him. In this behalf reference may be made to the cases

reported as Muhammad Shah..vs..State (PLD 1984 SC

278), Said Shah..vs..The State (PLD 1987 SC 288), Nadir

Khan..vs..The State (1988 SCMR_ 1899), Rab

Nawaz..vs..The State (PLD 1994 SC 858) and Ikram

Hussain..vs..The State (2005 SCMR 1487). The chemical

examiners report is sufficient to prove that substance

recovered from the vehicle was charas and heroin, which

could be used to cause intoxication.

7. Adverting next to the contention of the learned

counsel for the petitioner that while deciding the fate of a
petition for grant of bail, the Court is not to keep in view the

maximum sentence provided by law for the charged offence,

but the one likely to be imposed. It is now settled by the

august Supreme Court of Pakistan that neither categorization

of sentencing nor any guess work or speculative exercise

could be undertaken by the Court at bail stage to enlarge an

accused on bail in such crimes as laid down in Socha Gul’s

case (2015 SCMR 1077). Even otherwise investigation is

complete and challan has been submitted and trial is likely

to commence. In such a situation the Courts normally and

ordinarily avoids to grant bail on merits, lest it may cause

prejudice to either side. The tentative assessment of the

record leads me to the conclusion that there exists a prima

facie case against the petitioner, which falls within the

prohibition contained in Section 497 Cr.PC read with

Section-51 of CNSA Act, 1997, therefore, he is not entitled

to the concession of bail.

For what has been discussed above, the petition

in hand being bereft of merits is hereby dismissed. However,

the prosecution is directed to submit complete challan in the
Court within a fortnight and trial Court is directed to

conclude the trial expeditiously, but not later than four

months from the date of receipt of the file. Office is directed

to send back the record of the case immediately.
