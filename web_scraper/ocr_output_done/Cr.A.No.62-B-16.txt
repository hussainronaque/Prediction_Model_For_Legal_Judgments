vide judgment dated 08.12.2014, hence, this appeal by

State through Advocate General Khyber

2. On 26.7.2011 at 0930 hours, complainant

Gharib Nawaz (PW-6) brought the dead body of his

son Noor Wali Shah to Police Station Domail, Bannu

Imran/*

-2-

with the help of co-villagers in a Datsun and reported

the matter that on the fateful day he alongwith his son

Noor Wali Shah were proceeding to Mangal Mela for

purchasing victuals and when reached the lands

known as Kharbanay Korona at 0600 hours, accused

Afsar Ali, Zafar Ali, Anwar and Gul Azam armed

with Kalashnikovs came on motorcycle and started

firing on them as result, Noor Wali Shah got hit and

died on the spot while luckily the complainant

escaped unhurt. Motive for the occurrence is stated to

be blood feud between the parties. On the report of

complainant above referred FIR got registered.

3. At first co-accused Afsar Ali and Gul

Azad Khan faced trial and were acquitted vide

judgment dated 23.6.2012 while perpetual warrants of

arrest were issued against the respondents/accused.

Thereafter, the respondents/accused were arrested and

on completion of investigation supplementary challan

was submitted against them. They were formally

Imran/*

-3-

charged but they claimed trial. In support of its case

the prosecution examined eleven (11) witnesses

whereafter statements of accused were recorded under

Section 342 Cr.PC but they professed their innocence.

However, they neither wished to be examined on Oath

nor wanted to produce evidence in their defence. On

conclusion of trial, the learned Additional Sessions

Judge-I, Bannu acquitted the respondents/accused

vide impugned judgment dated 08.12.2014.

4. We have heard arguments of learned

A.A.G for the State-appellant and have gone through

the available record.

5. This unfortunate incident, wherein Noor

Wali Shh, son of complainant lost his life, took place

on 26.7.2011 at 06:30 a.m. The matter was reported to

the police by complainant Gharib Nawaz (PW-6) on

the same day at 09:30 a.m. whereas the distance

between place of occurrence and police station was

just about 13/14 kilometers. There is no satisfactory

Imran/*

-4-

explanation for delay of three and half hours in

reporting the matter to the police which casts serious

doubt regarding the veracity of the prosecution story.

6. The complainant charged four accused

for making simultaneous firing at him and _ his

deceased son with Kalashnikovs. Postmortem report

(Ex.PW-1/1) shows three entry wounds of 1/4" x 1/4"

on the body of the deceased. Motive for the

occurrence was stated to be blood feud between the

parties. The deceased and the complainant were at the

mercy of four accused but in incident the complainant

did not receive even a single injury. Story of the

complainant that he accompanied the deceased were

proceeding to Mangal Mela for purchasing daily use

items, in our view this story/version has been

introduced in order to justify the presence of the

complainant at the relevant time. Reliance is placed on

case titled, “Muhammad Khan and another Vs. The

State” (1999 SCMR 1220) and case titled, “Mir Mat

Imran/*

-5-

Khan alias Matokai Vs. The State (2002 P Cr. L J

1914).

7. Afsar Ali and Gul Azad Khan co-accused

are already acquitted and the role attributed to them

was identical to that attributed to the respondents/

accused. The record shows that acquittal of co-

accused has not been challenged by complainant party

or the State before High Court and acceptance of such

acquittal on the part of complainant indicates that they

were falsely implicated in the case. The law is settled

by now that if some eye-witnesses are disbelieved

against some accused persons attributed effective

roles then the same eye-witnesses cannot be relied

upon to the extent of the other accused persons in the

absence of any independent corroboration. Reliance is

placed on case titled, “Shahbaz Vs. The State”, (2016

SCMR 1763).

8. So far as the abscondence of respondents/

accused is concerned, in this part of the country

Imran/*

-6-

people do abscond not because they are guilty, but

because of fear and torture of the police. Even

otherwise, absconsion is not substantive piece of

evidence, it is a corroborative piece of evidence and in

cases where direct evidence fails, corroborative piece

of evidence is of no avail, as in the instant case, where

the evidence of complainant has been disbelieved.

Needless to say that abscondence can neither cure the

inherent defect of the ocular account nor by itself is

sufficient to sustain conviction. In this respect,

reference can be made to cases, “Taj Muhammad Vs.

Pesham Khan and others” (1986 SCMR 823) and

“Farman Ali and 3 others Vs. The State” (PLD 1980

Supreme Court 201).

9. Having examined the prosecution case,

we are of the considered view that the prosecution has

failed to connect the respondents/accused with the

commission of crime beyond shadow of doubt. The

learned trial Court, in the impugned judgment, has

Imran/*

-7-

considered all the legal and factual aspects of the
matter and we have not found misreading or non-
reading of evidence or anything which may call for
interference by this Court. Therefore, this appeal,
having no footing to stand with, is dismissed in /imine.

Announced.
