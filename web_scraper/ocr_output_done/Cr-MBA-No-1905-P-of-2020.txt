ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- Petitioner Hidayat Ullah,
seeks post arrest bail in case FIR No.186 dated 20.03.2005,
registered under sections 324/34 PPC, at Police Station
Hangu.

2. According to FlR/report of complainant
Muhammad Badshah on the fateful day he along with his
companions, namely, Farooq, Muhammad Riaz, and
Muhammad Ayaz was coming back to their houses, from
Malakhi Patti Samana and at 1300 hour, when reached the
place of occurrence, accused Hidayat Ullah, Abdul Raziq,
Faroog and Muhammad Yousaf, present there, duly armed
with Kalashnikovs, opened fire at them, as a result, he got
hit, whereas his companions fortunately remained
unscathed, hence, this case.

3. Complainant present in person states he does not
want to engage a counsel and would rely on the arguments
of learned Law Officer for the State. Arguments heard and

record perused.

4. It appears from the FIR that a general role of firing
at the complainant party has been attributed to four accused
including the petitioner. As per medico legal report, the
complainant has sustained two firearm entrance wounds
with corresponding exits. The said effective shots on the
person of the complainant have not been specifically
attributed to the petitioner. None of the companions of the
complainant has sustained any injury despite the fact that
they were also under the indiscriminate firing of four
accused and in close proximity of the complainant, which
is a disturbing aspect of the case and pinches a prudent
mind. Initially, co-accused Muhammad Youaf and Farooq
were arrested and they after facing trial were acquitted by
the competent court by disbelieving the prosecution
evidence vide judgment dated 03.03.2010. Record is silent
about filing of any appeal against the acquittal of co-
accused by the prosecution or complainant before the upper
forum. The role of the petitioner is similar to that of the
acquitted co-accused. In this view of the matter, whether
the prosecution would be able to prove the guilt of the
petitioner on the same set of evidence which has been
disbelieved by the competent Court, is a begging question,
which makes the case of the petitioner arguable for the
purpose of bail, particularly, in the circumstances when the
principle/rule of “sifting grain from the chaff” has been

done away with by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in its
authoritative and elaborate judgment, rendered in case of

Hizar Hayat (PLD 2019 SC-527) by dilating upon the
entire law right from 1925 till date. The relevant part of the

judgment is reproduced below:-

“We may observe in the end that a judicial system
which permits deliberate falsehood is doomed to fail
and a society which tolerates it is destined to self-
destruct. Truth is the foundation of justice and justice
is the core and bedrock of a civilized society and,
thus, any compromise on truth amounts to a
compromise on a society's future as a just, fair and
civilized society. Our judicial system has suffered a
lot as a consequence of the above mentioned
permissible deviation from the truth and it is about
time that such a colossal wrong may be rectified in
all earnestness. Therefore, in light of the discussion

made above, we declare that the rule falsus in uno.

falsus in omnibus shall henceforth be an integral
part of our jurisprudence in criminal cases and
the same shall be given effect _to, followed_and
applied by all the courts in the country _in_its
letter and spirit.” (Emphasis supplied)
5. As on merit, the petitioner has made out a case for

the grant of bail, therefore, mere abscondence, as per the
settled dictum of the worthy superior Courts, would not be
sufficient to clog the way of grant of bail to the petitioner.
6. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he
furnishes bail bonds in the sum of rupees two lac with two
local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD concerned.
