iii) Under section 337-F(iii) P.P.C:

Rehmani Gul with simple imprisonment for
one year.

Benefit u/s 382-B, Cr.P.C was extended to the
appellant and all the sentences were ordered to run

concurrently.

2. The occurrence was reported to police
by complainant Inam Ullah (PW-1) on 15.06.2016 at
17:56 hours in emergency ward of DHQ Hospital
Timergara by stating that on the same day he was
present in his cloth shop situated in bazaar Haya
Serai; at 16:00 hours the acquitted co-accused Taj
Munir and Anwar Zeb came to his shop. They
purchased a suit from him but refused to pay the
price thereof on the ground that they had purchased
another suit from him three days ago which was
deficient in size. An altercation took place between
them on the said issue during which some people of
the bazaar gathered there and they reasoned with the
accused for non-payment of cloth price as well as
their wicked behavior with the complainant. The
complainant further narrated in his report that the
said co-accused called their other companion namely
Master Ali (the present appellant) through a phone

call who, on his arrival to bazaar, fired at him from

DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-3-
which he escaped narrowly, however, Muhammad
Ibrahim and Rehmani Gul, who were present there
for mediation, where hit by bullet shots and became
seriously injured whererafter were shifted to
Timergara hospital through private conveyance. He
stated that the occurrence has been witnessed by him
and the above named injured persons as well other
people who were present in bazaar of Haya Serai. It
is noteworthy that injured Ibrahim later on

succumbed to the injuries in LRH Peshawar.

3. Injured Rehmani Gul and deceased then
injured Muhammad Ibrahim were examined by
Dr. Muhammad Salim (PW-9) on 15.06.2016. The

detail of his reports is as follows.

Rehmani Gul (injured)

One entrance firearm injury wound with inverted
margins over the left side neck.

One exit firearm injury with everted margins over
the left side neck back.

Opinion: Firearm injury.

The deceased then injured was admitted
in Surgical Unit “C” and, having traumatic chest, he
was operated for By-lateral Chest Intubation by
Dr. Muhammad Amin (PW-8) whose report is
Ex.PW-8/1. Thereafter he was referred to
Cardiothoracic Neuro-Surgery Ward, LRH

Peshawar.

4. The appellant/convict and his co-
accused were arrested on 26.06.2016. After
completion of investigation, challan against them
was put in Court. Formal charge was framed against
them to which they did not plead guilty and opted to
face the trial. Prosecution produced and examined as
many as thirteen out of seventeen PWs mentioned in
the calendar of witnesses and closed the evidence.
When examined u/s 342, Cr.P.C, the accused denied
the allegations of prosecution, however, they neither
recorded their own statements on oath nor opted to
examine any witness in their defence. On conclusion
of trial, the learned trial Court acquitted co-accused
Taj Munir and Anwar Zeb while convicted and
sentenced the present appellant vide judgment dated
12.01.2019, which is impugned before this Court in

the instant appeal.

5. We have heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the parties including the learned counsel
representing the State and perused the record with

their able assistance.

6. The prosecution has based its case
mainly on ocular account furnished by complainant
Inam Ullah (PW-1) and injured Rehmani Gul
(PW-2), medical evidence and _ incriminating
recoveries. According to the F.I.R and statement of
the complainant before the trial Court, prior to the
occurrence an altercation took place between him
and acquitted co-accused Taj Munir and Anwar Zeb
over non-payment of purchase price of cloth. The
said altercation turned into a fight between them
during which the co-accused called the present
appellant through a phone call; the appellant, on his
arrival to the spot, fired at the complainant who
escaped from the firing, however, Ibrahim and
Rehmani Gul (PW-2) who had approached to the
spot during the fight, sustained injuries on their
persons. Complainant Inam Ullah, being the main
party to the present controversy, is natural witness of
the occurrence as the initial fight had taken place
between him and the acquitted co-accused. The

occurrence has taken place in front of his cloth shop

DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamul/Ps*|

-6-
situated at Haya Serai bazaar. The facts that the
present appellant had approached to the place of
occurrence on the phone call of the co-accused as
well as presence of the deceased and injured on the
spot get confirmation from his cross-examination. In
response to a question by defence counsel, the
complainant stated that the appellant was
telephonically contacted by co-accused Taj Munir
and the appellant had arrived to the spot within ten
minutes. He further confirmed in his cross-
examination that the appellant was having a pistol in
his hand and soon after his arrival to the spot he
opened firing at him due to which Rehmani Gul was
injured and thereafter deceased Ibrahim was
wounded as a result of the said firing. Although, it
was brought from the mouth of the complainant
during cross-examination that about 20/30 persons
were present between him and the appellant at the
time of firing, however, he has explained the
position by stating that at the time of firing he
alongwith the deceased and injured were standing on
the podium of his shop. Moreso, according to
medical evidence of the deceased and injured, both
of them have sustained firearm injuries on the upper

parts of their bodies, therefore, escape of the people

7.
though standing in the line of firing, stands to reason

in the mentioned circumstances.

Zz. The other eye witness namely Rehmani
Gul appeared in the witness box as PW-2. He is
resident of bazaar Haya Serai and his house is at a
distance of 100 yards from the place of occurrence
besides his sons are running three shops in the same
vicinity. He has also sustained firearm injury on his
person, therefore, his presence on the spot cannot be
doubted. He has supported the complainant on
material particulars of the occurrence and verified
the report lodged by complainant at DHQ Hospital,
Timergara. He had no enmity with the appellant to
charge him in a false case, hence, there is no
convincing reason before us to disbelieve this
witness. Reliance is placed on Abdul Aziz and

another Vs. The State (1993 SCMR 544) wherein it

was held that:

The presence of Abdul Aziz P.W. on the spot
cannot be doubted at all because of the stamp
of injury on his person. He is, no doubt, the
sister's son of the deceased but it is highly
improbable that he would falsely implicate
innocent persons for his injury as well as that
of Muhammad Ramzan deceased and allow
the real culprits to go spot free whom he must
have identified in the daylight.

Although he has contradicted the

complainant regarding the mode of fight between the

DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamul/Ps*

-8-
co-accused and complainant as well as with regard
to arrival of the appellant to the spot but the same
contradictions are not forceful enough to negate the
entire case of prosecution. It is evident from the
record that the occurrence took place on 15.06.2016
and the eye witnesses were produced before the
Court on 14.09.2017 after fifteen months of the
occurrence. A witness cannot be expected to record
photographic narration of the occurrence after such
long time. Though the complainant is educated till
intermediate level but the injured witness is an
illiterate and rustic person having no axe of his own
to grind. They have been subjected to lengthy cross-
examination extending over hours, _ therefore,
emergence of negligible contradictions in their
statements as a result of such taxing cross-
examination cannot be excluded. In such situation,
in order to reach at a fair and just conclusion, the
Court has to look into the salient features on which
the PWs agree in their statements. Thus, the
contradictions in the statements of the two eye
witnesses in the instant case would not damage their
credibility. Reliance is placed on the judgment of the

august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of

DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-9-

Roshan and 4 others Vs. The State (PLD 1977 S.C

557) wherein it was observed that:

“Some counsel devote all their energies to
create contradictions, and to this end lengthy
cross-examination is conducted for hours and
days which is intended to confuse, even an
intelligent person, and is not calculated to elicit
any useful information. This exercise is
undertaken because Courts give undue
importance to contradictions found in the
statements of the prosecution witnesses. The
primary consideration in appraising the
evidence given by a witness is to determine,
firstly, why has he offered to testify ? Has he
seen the occurrence ? If so, has the Witness a
motive to implicate a person who was not
among the culprits or to exaggerate the part
played by any of them ? If a witness satisfies

y these two tests, then the Court should watch
f the general demeanour of the witness in order

to judge the quality of his perception and his
a) faculty to recall the past incidents: A witness

/ may make contradictory statements on some
{| of the details of the incident in respect of which
| j he is deposing in Court. The variation may be
| due to mere lapse of memory or the confusion
/ caused in his mind by a relentless cross-
examiner. Very often a witness gives an
incorrect statement because he must answer
every question regardless of the fact whether
he knows the answer to it or not. It is not
uncommon that the cross-examiner puts words
in the mouth of witnesses and the presiding
officer is not vigilant enough to check it. It is
also common experience that, without any
particular intent, even educated people
exaggerate when describing an event. Some
witnesses may be prone to it more than others.
Mere contradictions, therefore, do not lead to
the result that whatever the witness has said
on the salient features of the case and which
conforms to the other evidence on the record is
to be thrown over-board. ".

The benefit of slight variations between
the statements of the eye witnesses has already been
given to the appellant in the matter of quantum of
sentence and no revision has been filed by

complainant.

8 The record further shows _ that
complainant Inam Ullah, deceased Muhammad
Ibrahim and injured Rehmani Gul are residents of
different villages and there is no relationship
between them. The witnesses have got no common
motive to depose against the accused and same is the
position of LRs of deceased Muhammad Ibrahim. If
they had any reason for false implication of the
accused they could have charged all of the accused
for effective firing at the deceased in view of the
multiple firearm injuries on his body, however, they
have charged only the present appellant for firing by
narrating the occurrence in its true merits and
perspective which shows honesty and
straightforwardness of the PWs. The occurrence
took place in a bazaar, therefore, assemblage of the
deceased and injured in front of the complainant’s
shop at that particular event was a normal behavior
exhibited by them in view of the grave situation.

Keeping in mind the afore-mentioned aspects of
DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamul/Ps|

-ll-

the case coupled with the fact that the occurrence
had taken place at spur of the moment, any pre-
meditation, counseling or consultation between the eye
witnesses for concocting a false case against the
appellant is altogether ruled out. Even otherwise,
such consensus or cooperation cannot be expected
from the people involved in business in busy
markets or bazaars as it generally happens in rural
areas. In addition to above, the occurrence took
place in broad daylight, thus, there was no
possibility of misidentification of the assailant or his
substitution with the real culprit. Both the eye
witnesses have been subjected to lengthy cross-
examination, but except bringing contradictions of
minor nature from them, their credibility could not
be impeached on important aspects of the case,
therefore, their testimony is worth reliance for

conviction of the appellant.

9. The ocular account gets ample

corroboration from medical evidence and other
circumstantial evidence on record. According to
medical report (Ex.PW-9/1) of the deceased, he
sustained multiple firearm injuries on his body.
Similarly, injured Rehmani Gul sustained one entry

wound below his left scapula with exit on the right

side back of his neck. Thus, medical evidence is in
conformity with statements of the eye witnesses and
site plan. The I.O has also recovered the crime
weapon 30 bore pistol on pointation of the present
appellant regarding which another case vide F.LR
No. 200 dated 27.06.2016 was registered against
him u/s 15 A.A. in the same police station. The said
weapon has matched with the two crime empties of
30 bore lifted from the spot by I.O as is evident from
F.S.L report Ex.PW-12/10. Likewise, the report of
serologist Ex.PW-12/9 is also positive for human
blood regarding the blood-stained shirts of the
deceased and injured. Prosecution has examined
constable Hamid Ullah (PW-5) in support of
recovery memo Ex.PW-5/1 regarding recovery of
the two empties from the spot. Akhtar Said MHC
(PW-7) was examined as marginal witness of
recovery memo Ex.PW-12/24 and Ex.PW-12/25
regarding pistol and Datsun/Pickup through which
the accused had decamped from the spot after the
occurrence. He also verified the pointation memo
Ex.PW-12/23. Constable Shah Raza appeared before
the Court as PW-10 and supported the recovery of
blood stained shirts of the deceased and injured vide

recovery memos Ex.PW-12/3 and Ex.PW-12/4. The

DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamul/Ps*|

-13-
testimony of the above said marginal witnesses of
various recovery memos was not shattered during

their cross-examination.

10. Learned counsel for the appellant
vehemently contended that there is delay of about
two hours in lodging the report though the police
station is hardly at a distance of 1/2 kilometer from
the place of occurrence. The record shows that the
occurrence took place on 15.06.2016 at 16:00 hours
which was reported to police by complainant at
DHQ hospital Timergara situated at a distance of
10/11 kilometers according to the I.O which can be
covered in 40/45 minutes. According to statement of
Habib-ur-Rehman ASI, author of Murasila (Ex.PW-
1/1), he followed the injured persons to DHQ
Hospital Timergara after receiving information
about the occurrence and recorded the report of
complainant. Obviously, the author of Murasila
must have consumed some time while proceeding to
the hospital. The record also transpires that the
appellant was an employee of Police Department
and was posted in the same police station as
constable. It appears that recording of the matter was
purposely delayed by police either to get permission

from their high ups or help their colleague. In such

0B: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

-14-
circumstances, the delay, if any, in lodging the

report would not harm the prosecution case.

11. The record further shows that the
occurrence had taken place all of a sudden without
pre-meditation or consultation on behalf of the
accused, besides there are contradictions of minor
nature in the statements of eye witnesses, therefore,
the appellant was rightly awarded the sentence of
life imprisonment. Moreso, the complainant and
injured Rehmani Gul have attributed the role of
firing only to the present appellant, hence, acquittal
of his co-accused Taj Munir and Anwar Zeb by

learned trial Court is not open to any exception.

12. Upshot of the above discussion is that
prosecution has proved the guilt of the present
appellant through convincing direct as well as
circumstantial evidence, therefore, his involvement
in the occurrence could not be doubted.
Additionally, the appellant went into hiding soon
after the occurrence and surrendered before the local
police after eleven days of the occurrence which
further corroborates the ocular account and other
evidence regarding his involvement in commission

of the offences.

13. In light of the above discussion, the
impugned judgment, being well-reasoned and based
on correct appreciation of evidence on record, does

not call for any interference. Resultantly, this appeal,

being, devoid of merits, is accordingly dismissed.
