Petitioner(s) by:

Respondent(s) by:

IKRAMULLAH KHAN, J.- This appeal is

directed against the order of the learned
Accountability Court-lll, Peshawar dated
28.10.2017 whereby the Objection Petition
filed by the appellants was disposed of
subject to furnishing of bank guarantees equal
to the amount of loss allegedly caused by the
appellants.

02. Brief facts of the appeal in hand
are that the appellants in connivance with the
officers/officials of Working Folks Grammer
Schools, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa managed to get
transport contracts for the year, 2012-13 and
2013-14 for pick and drop facility of the
students of the said schools on_ highly
exorbitant rates through mock _ bidding

process and in sheer violation of the PPRA
rules. Resultantly, the NAB took cognizance of
the matter and an inquiry against the
appellants was authorized on the allegations
of corruption and corrupt practices by the
appellants. The NAB authorities freezed the
bank accounts of the appellants, confirmed by
the learned Administrative Judge,
Accountability Court, Peshawar vide order
dated 08.02.2017. Feeling aggrieved from the
above, the appellants filed Writ Petition
before this Court, which was disposed of on
20.09.2017 with the following directions: -

“Learned ADPG representing the
NAB informed the Court that the
petitioners have impugned the
freezing order dated 08.02.2017
before the learned trial Court
through Objection Petition and
the same is still pending. Thus,
by availing alternate remedy, the
petitioners are supposed to
pursue the same before the
learned trial Court, who is
directed to dispose it of within
thirty (30) working days.

2. The Writ Petition stands
disposed of”.

03. In compliance of order of this
Court dated 20.09.2017, the learned Trial
Court vide impugned order dated 28.10.2017
disposed of the objection petition filed by the
appellants by allowing defreezing bank

accounts of the appellants subject to
3

furnishing of authenticated bank guarantees
equal to the amount of the loss. Hence, the
instant appeal.

04. The record reveals that the
Reference against the appellants was placed
before the learned Trial Court on 09.04.2016,
wherein appellants were charged on
01.06.2016. The worthy Chairman, NAB had
freezed the Bank accounts of appellants on
25.01.2017 where, the record of the case was
already submitted before the learned Trial
Court, while the learned Administrative Judge
had confirmed the preliminary freezing order
rendered by NAB on 08.02.2017 without
taking cognizance of the case.

05. The provisions contained in
Section 12(a) of the NAB Ordinance empower
the Chairman NAB or the Court trying an
accused for any offence under the NAB
Ordinance for reasonable grounds to freeze
any movable or immovable property of an
accused or any relative, associate or person on
his behalf but if the freezing order is made by
the Chairman NAB the same is subjected to

two conditions as mentioned in first proviso
thereto Section 12 of the NAB Ordinance,
which reads as: -

“12. Power to freeze
property.—(a) The chairman
NAB or the Court trying an
accused for any offence as
specified under this Ordinance,
may at any time, if there appear
reasonable grounds for believing
that the accused has committed
such an_ offence, order the
freezing of his property, or part
thereof, whether in his
possession or in the possession
of any relative, associate or
person on his behalf:

(b) If the property ordered to be
frozen under sub-section (a) is a
debt or other moveable
property, the freezing may be
made, --

(i) by seizure; or

(ii) by appointment of receiver;
or

(iii) by prohibiting the delivery
of such property to the accused
or to anyone on his behalf; or
(iv) by all or any such or other
methods as the Court or the
Chairman NAB as the case may
be, deem fit;

(c) If the property ordered to be
frozen is immovable, _ the
freezing shall, in the case of land
paying revenue, be made
through the Collector of the
district in which the land is
situated, and in all other cases, --
(i) by taking possession; or

(ii) by appointment of receiver;
or

(iii) by prohibiting the payment
of rent or delivery of property to
the accused or to any other
person on his behalf; or

(iv) by all or any such methods
as the Chairman NAB or the
Court may deem fit:

Provided that any Order of
seizure, freezing, attachment or
any prohibitory order mentioned
above by the Chairman NAB,
shall remain in force for a period
not exceeding fifteen days
unless confirmed by the Court,
where the Reference under this
Order shall be sent by Chairman
NAB.

Provided further that
notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained therein the
Order of Chairman NAB or the
Curt shall be effective from the
time of passing thereof or
proclamation thereof in a
Newspaper, widely of the
accused either by registered post
A.D. or courier service or
electronic media as the Court
may deem proper having regard
to the facts and circumstances of
the case.

(d) If the property ordered to be
frozen consists of livestock or is
of a perishable nature, the
Chairman, NAB, or the Court
may, if it deems proper and
expedient, order the immediate
sale thereof and the proceeds of
the sale may be deposited with
the Chairman NAB or the Court,
or as either may direct as
appropriate.

(e) The powers, duties, and
liabilities of a Receiver, if any,
appointed under this section
shall be the same as those of a
Receiver appointed under Order
XL of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 (Act V of 1908).
(f) The order of _ freezing
mentioned in sub-sections “a” to
“e” shall remain operative until
the final disposal of the case by
the Court, and in the event of the
acquittal or release of the
accused, shall continue’ to
remain operative for a period of
ten days after receipt of certified
copy of the order of acquittal by
NAB, whereafter it shall be
subject to an order by the Court
in which an appeal, if any, is
filed”.

06. The intention of the legislature is
crystal clear that Chairman, NAB could

exercise its power to freeze any property,
belonging to accused or his relative or
associate or person on behalf of accused not
exceeding 10 days at the stage where the
reference had not already been send to the
Court otherwise the last sentence in the
proviso itself would have not been used as
“Where the Reference under this Order shall
be sent by the Chairman, NAB".

07. The Provisions contained in
Section 12(a) authorizes not only the
Chairman, NAB but also the Court to freeze
the property at any time but power of the
Court is also made conditional to exercise
such power only when trying the accused
under the NAB Ordinance.

08. The word “anytime” used for
exercise of power either by the Chairman or
the Court in regard to freezing of property is
subject to or to be read as at any time during
investigation by the Chairman, NAB or at any
time by the Court during course of trial.

09. The word “any time” does not
empower the Court to freeze the property
before commencement of trial and likewise

once an accused sent for trial, then the
7

Chairman, NAB become functus officio, which
is also very well clarified by the first proviso
thereto Section 12 of the NAB Ordinance,
reproduced hereinabove.

10. In case in hand, the respondent at
the first instance had made a “caution order”
alien to any provisions of the NAB Ordinance
which was challenged by the appellants in
Writ Petition No.3438-P/2016, however,
during course of adjudication of the
impugned order, the respondent made order
of freezing of the Bank account of appellants
and the writ petition on account of the
freezing order dated 25.01.2017 was become
infructuous and was disposed of with
permission to the appellant to challenge the
same before the learned Trial Court in terms
of Section 13 of the NAB Ordinance.

11. The learned Trial Court had
acceded to the contention of appellants
insofar as the question of exercise of power
under Section 12(a) by the Chairman, NAB was
concerned and as such the Bank accounts

were released but subject to furnishing bank
8

guarantee equal to the amount allegedly
misappropriated by the appellants.

12. It is settled principle of law that
freezing of any property by the Court for
unlimited period is itself against the
constitution and no any prolonged restriction
could be imposed in order to deprive a person
even the accused to use right over his
property prior to holding him guilty and in
order to decide such matter in regard to
freezing of property, Section 13 of the NAB
could be strictly construed, wherein Court is
empower to adjudicate the issue of freezing
separately, however, is case in hand, the
learned Trial Court had not adopted the
procedure, envisaged under Section 13 of the
NAB Ordinance and without recording any
evidence in this regard had decided the issue
under consideration.

13. Once a Court arrives to the
conclusion that any order/act under challenge
is illegal or without jurisdiction then the Court
shall annul the same in order to fulfill the

requirement of law for the safe administration
9
of justice. There shall be no compromise over
the rights of citizen as well as accused.
14. Courts are custodian of rights of
both the state and citizen performing function
as “Amin” and bound to return due rights of
parties.
15. No any provisions of furnishing
surety bonds were accommodated under the
provisions of Section 13 of the Ordinance,
therefore, placing condition for release of
property is not justified.
16. As mentioned hereinabove, the
Chairman, NAB could not exercise its power
envisaged under Section 12(a) ibid, thereafter,
sending the Reference before the
Accountability Court, as such not only the first
order dated 25.01.2017, rendered by the
Chairman, NAB was not warranted by law but
also the confirmation order dated 08.02.2017
rendered by the learned Administrative Jude,
Accountability Court.
17. This Court in Khalid Aziz (PLD
2003 Peshawar 94) is explained and
interpreted similar power as under discussion

exercised by the Chairman, NAB under Section
10

26 of the Act ibid, wherein it is held that
“grant of pardon to the co-accused under
Section 26 of the NAB Ordinance by the
Chairman, NAB without approval of the Trial
Court being illegal without lawful authority
and void ab initio".

18. While in case Shuja Khan Baloch
(PLD 2011 Islamabad 25) the Hon'ble
Islamabad High Court is held that “the
Chairman has the authority to pass any order
in respect of property of the accused as long
as the Court has not taken cognizance of the
case, but the moment the Court takes
cognizance of any matter under the National
Accountability | Ordinance, 1999, then
Chairman NAB becomes functus officio and
only the Accountability Court can pass any
order regarding the property of the accused’.
19. As discussed hereinabove, for the
afore-stated reasons, this appeal is dispose of
in terms that not only the impugned freezing
order dated 25.01.2017, rendered by the
Chairman, NAB but also the Judgment dated
08.02.2017 rendered by the learned Court

below. However, learned Trial Court may
11
keeping in view the provisions of Section 12(a)
of the NAB Ordinance and if he deems it
appropriate may re-freeze the property of the
appellants if reasonable grounds exists for
such exercise of power under Section 12(a) of

the NAB Ordinance.

Announced.
