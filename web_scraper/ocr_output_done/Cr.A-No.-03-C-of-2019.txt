2. Criminal revision No. 1-C/2019 has been
filed by complainant for enhancement of the sentence

of appellant namely Ahsan Ahmad to that of death

penalty.

3. FIR in the case in hand was registered on
the basis of Murasila Ex PW 8/1. Complainant namely
Muhammad Nasir lodged report of the occurrence at
Emergency Ward of DHQ Hospital Chitral, by stating
that he had gone to the local market for purchasing
grocery for the occasion of Eid and on return, he
parked his motorcycle near outer door of his house. In

the meanwhile, the accused (appellant) came there and

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-3-

started abusing the complainant. Complainant
had also lodged a protest to father of the
appellant, who came there in the meanwhile.
When son of the complainant namely Zakria
(deceased) came to the spot, the appellant took
out a knife from his pocket and stabbed him
with the intention to kill him. Complainant
tried to separate the appellant and his son, but
the appellant also made knife blows at his
body. As a result of which, he was injured
on left side of his head as well as abdomen,
while his son was injured on _ back side
and upper portion of his head as well as left
leg. The occurrence was stated to have been
witnessed by PWs Abdul Rahman and Inam-ur-
Rahman. Motive for commission of the offence
was stated to have been some previous
ill-will. The accused/appellant was accordingly
charged for commission of the offence by the

complainant.

4. Investigation in the case was started,
during which injury sheets of the complainant and

postmortem report of the deceased were obtained.

-4.

Beside other proceedings in investigation, the knife
through which the appellant had allegedly stabbed the
deceased, was also recovered vide recovery memo Ex
PW 4/1, report regarding which was also obtained and
placed on record as Ex PZ. The accused/appellant was
arrested on the day of occurrence i.e. 01.09.2017. After
completion of investigation, complete challan was put
in Court. Charge was framed against him on
24.10.2017. The case was then posted for evidence of
the prosecution. The prosecution recorded statements
of fifteen (15) witnesses. On conclusion of prosecution
evidence, statement of accused was recorded under
section 342 Cr. PC. At conclusion of proceedings in
the case, the accused/appellant namely Ahsan Ahmad
was convicted and sentenced as reproduced above vide

impugned judgment dated 29.06.2019.

5. We have heard arguments of learned

counsel for the parties, learned Asst:A.G appearing on

behalf of the State and perused the record.

6. Perusal of record reveals that prosecution
have been relying upon statements of the six eye-
witnesses beside the corroboratory evidence that have
been led in the case. We would first discuss eye-

witness account of the occurrence. Statement of the

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-5-

complainant was recorded as PW-10. In _ his
examination-in-chief, he stated that on 01.09.2017 he
had gone to the local market for purchasing grocery for
the occasion of Eid and on his return, he parked his
motorcycle near outer door of his house. The appellant
namely Ihsan Ahmad came there and started abusing
him. His father namely Sikandar Khan was also stated
to have come in the meanwhile to whom the
complainant lodged a protest and when son of the
complainant namely Zakria (deceased) came to the
spot, the appellant took out a knife from his pocket and
stabbed him with the intention to kill him.
Complainant further stated that he tried to separate the
two, where-upon the appellant also gave him knife
blows, causing him injuries on left side of his head as
well as abdomen. The occurrence was stated to have
been witnessed by PWs Abdul Rahman and Inam-ur-
Rahman. Motive for commission of the offence was
disclosed as his refusal in giving hands of his daughter
to the appellant, due to which he had also extended
threats to the complainant party earlier and security
bond for keeping peace, had also been obtained from

him under section 107 Cr. PC on their complaint.

7. The witness was allowed to be cross-

examined by the defence side but the scheme of cross-

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-6-

examination reveals that learned counsel for the
accused/appellant had been trying to extracts some
statement from the witness, wherein burden of his
client may be lightened and the ensuing criminal
liability diminished to a possible extent. Whatever may
be the scheme of cross-examination, but the fact
remained that the veracity of this witness regarding the
occurrence and the role played by the appellant could
not be shattered, even to a slightest extent. It was
suggested to this witness that brunt of the knife which
the appellant was having at the relevant time could not
have caused death of a person, in response to which the
witness had denied the suggestion and added that if
brunt of the blow was borne by sensitive part of the
body, then it might result into death. It was also
suggested that there had been some iron rods on the
spot and due to falling on such iron rods, the deceased
had died but said suggestion had also been
straightaway denied by the witness. There had not been
any evidence or material to said effect as it neither
found support from site plan or any other piece of
evidence. Brother of the deceased namely Sohaib
Ahmad was examined as PW-2. While another cousin

of the deceased namely Hamid-ur-Rahman was

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-7-

examined as PW-6 beside Zafrullah, who was

examined as PW-5.

8. Inam-ur-Rahman examined as PW-1, has
been an independent witness being neighbor of both
the parties having no axe to be grinded in the matter.
He has supported case of the prosecution in his
examination-in-chief. He was cross-examined but
nothing beneficial to the case of prosecution could be
extracted from his mouth. Same was the case with
statement of Ubaid-ur-Rahman recorded as PW-3. He
was also community watcher and had been present at
the spot. He has also been cross-examined at length but
nothing beneficial to the case of prosecution could be
extracted from his mouth. Both these witnesses had
been fully independent witnesses of the locality having
no relations with any of the parties. Hon’ble Supreme
Court of Pakistan in the case of Muhammad Iqbal
and others vs. Muhammad Akram and _ another
reported as 1996 SCMR 908, has held that witnesses
may be classified into three categories i.e. absolutely
reliable witnesses, absolutely unreliable witnesses and
partly reliable witnesses. It has further been held in
said judgment that conviction may safely be based on
testimony of absolutely reliable witnesses even in

absence of any corroboratory material with the

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-8-

prosecution. Relevant part of observation of the august

Court is reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

“ In the first category, conviction may safely
be sustained on uncorroborated testimony.”

These witnesses have also been fully
independent witnesses and no reason existed for
discarding their testimony. Besides, other prosecution
witnesses have also supported case of the prosecution
and have remained fully consistent with each other as
well as with the documentary evidence available with
the prosecution on material aspects of the case. Their
cross-examinations could not produce any beneficial

factor for the defence.

9. Prosecution have also been banking on
confessional statement of the appellant but same
cannot safely be relied upon. The confessional
statement Ex PW 12/2 has been recorded on
06.09.2017 while the accused/appellant had been
arrested on 01.09.2017 i.e. after five days of his arrest.
It was not only a delayed judicial confession but the
accused had been brought before the Magistrate on the
following day of his arrest (vide application Ex PW
14/3), who had granted two days custody of the

accused. Then again he was produced before the

Magistrate on 04.09.2017 (vide application Ex PW

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-9-
14/7) and the local police obtained further two days

custody of the accused. On neither of the two
occasions, the accused had confessed his guilt before
the Court. Then on 06.09.2017 when the accused/
appellant was produced before the Magistrate, his
confessional statement was recorded. Such prolonged
custody and repeated productions of the accused before
the Magistrate and taking him back to the Police
Station would have naturally produced a state of mind,
where the appellant might have been under the
impression that if he had not made confession, he
might again be handed back to the police. The
confessional statement in such circumstances cannot be
stated to be voluntary and it is not a piece of evidence

which can safely be relied upon.

10. Other corroboratory pieces of evidence
included post-mortem report of the deceased exhibited
as Ex PW 9/2. The concerned Doctor has been
examined in support thereof as PW-9, who has given

the following description of injuries in his statement;

“About 4cm cut wound posterior upper
cervical region i.e. with a depth of 6 to 7cm
about which is already stitched, small cut
wound over right scapula clothed blood in
both nostrils.

About 4cm cut wound in upper cervical
region on left side with maximum of about 6
to 7cm seen. Underlying bone exposed and

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-10-

fracture communicating with posterior
cranial fossa breach in dura meter with
subdural hematoma extending into
cerebellum.”

In his cross-examination, he denied the
suggestion that with a knife of routine usage, such like
injuries could not be caused. The description of
injuries given by the Doctor had also been lending
support to the version of complainant as narrated in the
FIR. Learned counsel for the appellant has been laying
substantial stress on point that the injuries as described
in the medico-legal report could not have been caused
with a knife of routine usage and that this fact shows
that the occurrence had not happened in the mode and
manner as narrated by the complainant. We have given
our anxious thought to this submission of learned
counsel for the appellant but have found an adequate
answer in the statement of Constable Akhtar Ayub
recorded as PW-4. In his examination-in-chief, this
witness has stated that the knife recovered from body
search of the appellant had been having a blade of 4
inches. It needs mention here that the appellant had
been arrested on the day of occurrence. In his cross-
examination, he has stated that the knife was having a
shape like fish and that one side of its handle had been
broken. He had denied the suggestion that the knife

had been so small and that it could not cause injuries to

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-11-

anyone. The broken side of handle shows the force
applied by the appellant while stabbing the deceased.
Knife of even routine usage, in the hands of a powerful
person, may cause injuries of very serious nature
particularly when the blows are received on sensitive
parts of one’s body. When we read statement of PW-4
along with overwhelming evidence of the prosecution
including the statements of independent eye-witnesses,
we come to the conclusion that the injures had been
caused with the stab blows of the appellant and it had
been a sheer force applied that had caused fracture of

the skull and resultant death of the deceased.

1. Recovery of knife through which the
occurrence had been committed, recovered from the
appellant at the time of his arrest from his personal
search on 01.09.2017, has also been proved by the
prosecution through the statement of PW-4 as well as
statement of Investigating Officer. Said knife had also
been sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory for the
purpose of chemical analysis, wherefrom report Ex PZ
had been received showing that the knife, shirt and
blood stained shalwar had been containing human

blood but same had not found sufficient for blood

grouping.

12. Prosecution have been able to prove their
case against the appellant beyond a shadow of doubt
and the learned trial Court has rightly convicted the
appellant for commission of the offence. The instant
criminal appeal was found divested of any force and

same is accordingly dismissed.

13. So far as criminal revision No. 1-C/2019,
filed by the petitioner for enhancement of the sentence
is concerned, it is important to be noted that the
occurrence had taken place all of a sudden without any
premeditation. Exchange of hot words had also taken
place between the complainant and the appellant,
immediately before the occurrence. Motive for
commission of the offence could not be proved by the
prosecution, beyond reasonable doubt. In such
circumstances, the learned trial Court had rightly
awarded the appellant a sentence of life imprisonment
instead of death penalty. No case for enhancement of
the sentence could be made out by learned counsel for
petitioner in the criminal revision. Same was found to

be divested of any force and accordingly dismissed.
