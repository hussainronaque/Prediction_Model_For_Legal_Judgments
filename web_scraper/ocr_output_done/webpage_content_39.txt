Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, J.   
The applicant has sought bail in Crime No.17/2011 registered on 16.03.2011
under Section 8(1) Sindh Public Property Act 2010 at P.S. Anti-Encroachment
Sindh, Karachi. Briefly the case of the prosecution against the applicant as
stated in the FIR is as under:-
 
"I, Sabir Hussain S/o Mohammad Saleh, Mukhtiarkar
Bin Qasim Town Karachi accompanying D.O. Revenue Karachi and police official
reached at Dhoro Bhenis Colony. Where some persons occupied Government land
measuring 10 Acres and made construction there upon. When we interrogated to
said persons then they have no any reasonable answer about it. We also demanded
for the documents but they have failed to produce same and asked their names as
1. Ghulam Rasool S/o Fazal-ul-Din 2. Irshad Hussain S/o Fazal Karim 3. Muzafar
Ali S/o Manzoor Hussain 4. Abdul Haque S/o Wazeer Ahmed and all of them
arrested by the police on the spot and above arrested persons asked the names
of absconded persons as 1. Bashir Abbasi S/o Fareed Ahmed 2. Muzaffar S/o
Unknown 3. Arshad S/o Unknown 4. Anwar S/o Unknown 5. Mohammad Deer Shah S/o
Unknown. Now my claim against the arrested and absconded persons that they
occupied the Government land and illegally constructed there upon. Therefore
this crime registered under section 8(1) of Sindh Property Act 2010."
 
2.         After
investigation of the case, challan has been submitted before the learned trial
Court.
3.         Learned
counsel for the applicants has contended that the applicants are innocent and
have been falsely implicated in the instant crime. Per learned counsel, allegation
against the applicants for having encroached the Government land is totally
incorrect whereas no construction whatsoever has been raised nor any
encroachment has been made by them. It is contended that the applicant No.1
owns land admeasuring 1-00 acre in Naclass 46, Deh Gamgiyaro, Bin Qasim Town,
Karachi, and has legal documents in this regard, whereas he has no concern
whatsoever with other land of the Government. Per learned counsel, the FIR is
vague, whereas no specific role has been assigned to the applicants. Per
learned counsel, there is inordinate delay in lodging the FIR for which no
plausible explanation has been given. Per learned counsel, neither recovery of
any article nor any construction by the applicants on the alleged encroached
land has been shown. Per learned counsel, the applicants have been implicated
just to cause harassment and humiliation with mala-fide intention of the
prosecution for personal gain. It is further argued that the alleged offence
does not fall within the prohibitory clause of sub-section (2) of section 497
Cr. P.C. Per learned counsel, it is a case of further inquiry. It is further
contended that in view of the record available with the Mukhtiarkar, who is
present in Court, the applicants have no concern with the alleged encroachment
on the government land. In support of his contention on application of rule of
consistency in case of bail before arrest and after arrest, the learned counsel
has placed reliance in the case of Muhammad Fazal alias Bodi vs. The State 1979
SCMR page 9 and Abdul Salam vs. The State 1980 SCMR 142. On merits, the learned
counsel has further argued that since the applicant has no claim whatsoever
over the land for which the FIR has been registered nor he has encroached upon
such land, the entire proceedings under the circumstances are liable to be
quashed.
In support of his contentions, learned counsel has placed reliance on the
following judgments:
1.         Muhammad Daud and another Vs. The State and another 2008
SCMR 173
2.         Fida
Hussain Vs. The State and others PLD 2002 SC 16
3.         Abdul Salam Vs. The State 1980 SCMR 142.
4.         Abdul Aziz Khan Niazi Vs. The State through Chairman NAB, Islamabad PLD 2003 SC 668
5.         Anwar Saifullah Khan Vs. The State and 3 others 2001 SCMR
1040.
6.         Muhammad Ismail Vs. Muhammad Rafique and another PLD 1989 SC
585.
7.         Ch. Tanveer Khan Vs. Chairman, National Accountability
Bureau and others PLD 2002 SC 572.
8.         Gul Zaman Vs. The State 1999 SCMR 1271
9.         Noor Muhammad Vs. The State 2008 SCMR 1556 
 
4.         The
complainant/Mukhtiarkar, present in Court has placed on record the interim
challan in respect of FIR No.18/2011. He has also place on record the letter
issued by ADO (Revenue)-IV Malir Zone, City District Government Karachi,
bearing No.ADO/REV/Malir/Zone-IV/1392/2010 dated 23.09.2010 in respect of the
land allotted to the applicant No.1 Muhammad Arshad son of Ghulam Muhammad in
Naclass 46, copy of which has already filed by the applicant available at page 33
of the file. He further stated that the instant FIR has been registered in
respect of Dhora (Nalla), which according to him was being encroached by the
present applicants, whereas the applicants have no concern with such land. He
further informed that though there is no concrete construction, however on some
land, boundary walls are found raised. He has sought permission to remove such
encroachment from the government land. 
5.         Conversely,
the learned APG, in view of hereinabove has formally opposed the bail, however
he could not explain the opposition of bail. Learned APG has submitted that the
matter be proceeded in accordance with law and the proceedings may not be
quashed at this stage.
6.         I
have heard learned counsel for the applicants as well as APG and noted the
contention of the complainant/Mukhtiarkar, present in Court. On tentative
assessment of the record and in view of the statement of Mukhtiarkar, I am of
the view that the FIR does not contain the specific allegation about the nature
of the encroachment or the identification of government land, which has
allegedly been encroached upon, whereas no detail of such encroachment has been
given. The applicants were admittedly not found to have occupied or encroached the
government land. Mukhtiarkar has stated that at present no one is found in
illegal possession of the land as stated in the FIR. No incriminating material
has been recovered from the applicants, which could support the version of the
prosecution or connect the applicant with the alleged crime, whereas
application of provisions of Section 8 of the Sindh Public Property (Removal of
Encroachment) Act, 2010 under the circumstances appears to be doubtful. Neither
there is any independent witness of the alleged crime nor any independent
witness has been associated.
7.         In
view of hereinabove, prosecution story cannot be treated free from doubt and
the matter requires further inquiry, whereas minimum punishment provided under
Section 8(1) of Sindh Public Property (Removal of Encroachment) Act, 2010 is
one year. In the reported case of Shehzore and another v. The State 2006 Y.L.R
3167, the learned Judge of this Court now elevated to the Apex Court while
granting bail in a case registered under Section 395 PPC has held that under
provisions of Section 395, P.P.C. alternate punishment i.e. imprisonment for
live or imprisonment not less than four years and more than 10 years having
been provided, lesser sentence should be considered by the Court in the matter
of bail. It is settled principle of law that bail cannot be withheld as
punishment, whereas grant of bail in bailable offences is a rule and refusal is
exception. Similarly, law is not to be stretched in favour of prosecution.
Reliance in this regard can be placed on the recent judgment of Hon’ble Supreme
Court in the case of Abid Ali alias Ali v. The State 2011 SCMR 161.  Ratio
of the case laws relied upon by the learned counsel for the applicants is
attracted under the circumstances.
8.         In
view of hereinabove, and respectfully following the dicta laid down in the
above cited judgments, I am of the view that the applicants have made out a
case for confirmation of ad-interim pre-arrest bail, which was granted by this
Court vide order dated 24.03.2011. Accordingly, pre-arrest ad-interim bail is
hereby confirmed on the same terms and conditions as contained in the order
dated 24.03.2011. 
9.         Needless
to observe that the observation made herein are tentative in nature and shall
not prejudice the merits of the case which may be examined strictly in
accordance with law and on the basis of evidence on record. 
10.       However,
it is clarified that if, the applicant misuses the concession of bail in any
manner, the learned trial Court shall be at liberty to proceed against the
applicants as per law.
