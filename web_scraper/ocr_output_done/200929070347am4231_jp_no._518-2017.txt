Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 against the judgment dated
06.04.2017 passed by learned Division Bench of Peshawar High
Court, Peshawar in. Murder Reference No. 09 of 2016/Criminal

Appeal No. 393-P of 2016.

2. At the very outset, it has been argued by learned
counsel appearing on behalf of petitioner that both the courts below
have not taken the evidence available on the record in its true

prospective and same has not been evaluated according to the

4 established principles of law enunciated by superior courts from

time to time. Contends that statement of Abdar Ali Shah (PW-7) who
is stated to be only eye witness of this occurrence is an interested

, Witnesses and his presence at the spot is doubtful and has been

created just to strengthen the prosecution case as his name is not
‘mentioned in the. crime report. Further contends that neither there is
any sign of fire shot on the alleged rickshaw which was being driven
by the said Abdar Ali. Shah -(PW-7) at, the relevant time, nor any
blood was taken from the said rickshaw, therefore, it create a doubt

in the genuineness of the prosecution version and calling for

interference of this Court in the interest of. ‘justice.

3. We have heard the learned counsel and gone through

the record. : :
“4°. Bare perusal of crime report clearly reflects that though

the name of Abdar Ali Shah (PW-7) is not mentioned in the FIR but
the complainant Salsalat Bacha (PW-6) while lodging the FIR
narrated that the occurrence was witnessed by those who were
present at the spot at the relevant time. There is no denial to this
fact that the statement of Abdar Ali Shah (PW-7) under section 161
Cr.P.C. was recorded at the spot ‘when the police arrived at the spot
‘and later on his statement under section 164 Cr.P.C was recorded
on 11.05.2011. All contentions raised by learned counsel relates to
minor discrepancies. It is established law that if the discrepancies
are shattering the prosecution story on salient feature then it has
substance to intervene on the subject otherwise it has no impact on
the veracity of the prosecution story. The learned High Court while
handing down the judgment impugned before us has already taken

care of all established principles of law and converted the sentence
a

of death into imprisonment for life which seems to us appropriate
and in accordance with law. The contentions raised by learned

counsel are without any force which are repelled. As a consequence,
