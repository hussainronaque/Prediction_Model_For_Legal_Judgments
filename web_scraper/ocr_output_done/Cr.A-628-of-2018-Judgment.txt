Special Task, Katlang delivered in case FIR No.507
dated 03.12.2015 u/s 302 PPC of Police Station Katlang
District Mardan, whereby accused/respondent has been

acquitted of the charge leveled against him.

2. As per contents of FIR, on 03.12.2015,
Musarraf Shah SI alongwith other police contingent was
on gusht of the area when received information to the
effect that a dead body of an unknown female was lying
at Gul Mian Kaly near Kandao Pahar. In the wake, he

in terms, that the dead body was of his niece Mst.Bano,

through firing with firearms. No one was charged by the
complainant for the crime at the time of report. On the
basis of murasila Ex.PA/1, FIR Ex.PA was registered
against unknown accused. Later on, on 07.12.2015,

father of deceased Azam Khan recorded his statement

before the Illaqa Judicial Magistrate u/s 164 Cr.P.C.,

wherein, he charged the accused/respondent for the

murder of his daughter having illicit relation with her.

3. After completion of investigation, challan was put in

court against the accused, which indicted him for
commission of the offence to which he did not plead guilty
and claimed trial. Prosecution in order to substantiate its
case produced and examined 14 witnesses in all,

whereafter statement of the accused was recorded,

wherein, he professed his innocence. The learned trial
court, after conclusion of the trial, found the appellant not
guilty of the charge and acquitted him vide judgment

dated 09.06.2018 whereagainst instant appeal has been

preferred.
4. Arguments heard and record gone through.

5. In the instant case, FIR has been lodged by Sahib Gul
uncle of the deceased on 03.12.2015, wherein, no one was
charged for commission of the offence. On 07.12.2015,
father of the deceased recorded his 164 Cr.P.C., wherein,
he nominated the accused/respondent for the crime.

Neither uncle nor father of the deceased has witnessed the

crime. Though allegation of illicit relation between the

ee

deceased and accused/respondent has been leveled but
no evidence was produced by the prosecution in this
respect. No doubt recovery of mobile phone belonging to
brother-in-law of the accused/respondent has been made
but his statement has not been recorded by |.0./PW-14. As
stated earlier, complainant (PW-9) has stated that he was
neither eyewitness to the occurrence nor he could show
any person having seen the deceased in the company of
accused/respondent prior to the occurrence, during the
occurrence and after the occurrence. Moreover, PW-14
admitted that he had not brought the conversation between
the accused/respondent and deceased on file in support of
CDR Ex.PW14/9. Again SIM No.0348-9243618 allegedly
recovered from the dead body of deceased stands
registered in the name of Wazir Badshah whereas SIM
No.0343-2548128 recovered from the accused/respondent
has been registered in the name of Ameer Zada. Similarly,
SIM No.0348-2610507 is registered in the name of
accused/respondent but it is not ascertainable as to from
where the same was recovered because of non-availability
of recovery memo thereof. On the basis of three SIMs and
CDR record, it cannot be said with certainty that
accused/respondent was responsible for the murder of

deceased.

6. In addition, neither weapon of offence nor any other
incriminating recovery has been made from the
accused/respondent or on his pointation. Furthermore, the

motive has not been established through evidence.

4
|__| 7 _ The learned trial court after proper appreciation of the |
available case evidence has rightly granted acquittal to the
accused/respondent as his participation in the crime could
not be proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable
doubts. While reaching to its conclusion qua acquittal of
the accused/respondent, the learned trial court has not
committed any illegality or irregularity, therefore, no
exception could be taken by this court to the judgment of
the learned trial court. Furthermore, it is well settled
principle of law that once an accused is acquitted, then he
earns double presumption of his innocence, which cannot
be taken away from him unless it is shown that the
judgment of acquittal is arbitrary or contrary to the case

evidence, which is not the case in hand.

8. For the aforementioned reasons, this appeal has no

substance, which is hereby dismissed in limine.
