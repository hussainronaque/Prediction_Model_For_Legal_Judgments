State by: Mr. Adnan Ali, Asstt: A.G.

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- Hidayat-ullah son of Gohar Ali
Shah, Kundi by caste, resident of village Amma-Khel
Tehsil and District Tank, was tried for the murder of Aftab
Ali and attempting at the life of Muhammad Alam
complainant, Muhammad Nazif cousin of complainant
and father of the complainant namely Muhammad Aslam,
by the learned Sessions Judge, Tank in crime No. 150
dated 22.10.2008, registered under Sections 302/324/34
P.P.C at police station Mullazai. The trial Judge by the
judgment dated 14.06.2012, acquitted Hidayat-ullah.

2. Through separate trial, vide judgment dated
05.01.2017, the learned Sessions Judge acquitted co-
accused Muhammad Yusuf Shah s/o Gohar Ali Shah, on

the same allegations with reference to crime No. 150,
-2-

dated 22.10.2008, registered under Sections 302/324/34

P.P.C, at Police Station Mullazai.

3. Complainant Mehmood has _ challenged
acquittal of both the accused through Cr. Appeal. No. 40-
D of 2012 and Cr. A. No. 04-D of 2017, respectively, we
propose to decide both these appeals, through this single
judgment as both these appeals have sprung out of one and
the same crime report and same set of evidence involving
identical question of law and facts.

4. The occurrence in which respondents were
involved was alleged to have taken place on 22.10.2008 at
9 a.m. in front of baithak of the complainant situated at
Amar-Khel within the jurisdiction of Police Station
Mullazai Tehsil and District Tank. Initial report in shape
of Murasila Ex. PA/1 was lodged by Mehmood Alam PW-
8, subsequently incorporated into FIR Ex. PA. The matter
was reported to Muhammad Hussian Inspector (PW-12) in
emergency room of Civil Hospital, Tank, on 22.10.2008 at
10.30 a.m., stating that on the eventful day and time, he
alongwith his father, his cousin Muhammad Nazif son of
Mastan Ali Shah were sitting in front of his baithak. In the
meantime, his cousin Hidayat-ullah Shah son of Gohar Ali
Shah came and angrily asked him as to why he had not
permitted them to connect wire from the transformer and

slapped him in his face. His father and his cousin
-3-

Muhammad Nazif separated them. Hidayat-ullah went
back to his home and after a while, he alongwith his
brother Yusuf Shah armed with Kalashinkov came there
and with the intention to kill fired upon them, on hearing
fire shots, his brother Aftab Ali who was busy in his study
inside baithak, came out and accused with the intention to
kill him made firing upon him and severally injured him.
After commission of offence the accused fled away from
the spot. The injured Aftab was taken to the hospital in an
official ambulance for medical treatment, but succumbed
to his injuries, on the way to hospital. Besides,
complainant, the occurrence was witnessed by his father
Aslam and cousin Muhammad Aslam. Motive as alleged,
was that the accused was stopped from taking connection
from the transformer.

5. The prosecution evidence in this case consists
of ocular version furnished by the first informant
Mehmood Alam (PW-8), Muhammad Nazif (PW-9),
Muhammad Aslam was given up. The other evidence
pertains to the recovery of blood stained earth, 05 empties
of 7.62 bore and two leads spent bullet from the scene of
crime, the postmortem examination, FSL report Ex. PY
and abscondence of accused.

6. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

complainant took us through the ocular evidence, then
-4-
referred to the recoveries, FSL report and finally the
postmortem report.

7. While dealing with the ocular accounts he
submitted that they were natural witnesses. They gave
reasonable explanation of their presence on the scene of
crime. They were not inimical in any way to the
respondents. It was further submitted that on the ground of
relationship with the deceased their evidence is not to be
discarded. Learned counsel argued that the eye witnesses
account is corroborated by the recovery of blood stained
earth and 05 empties of 7.62 bore which according to FSL
report were fired from different weapons, which clearly
suggests that assailants were more than one. Postmortem
report (Ex. PM) further proved that the weapon used could
be fire arms.

8. Learned counsel then challenged the reasons
given by the trial Court for acquittal of the respondents
and vociferously contended that these were contrary to the
record.

9. The learned counsel representing the State
supported the contentions of the learned counsel for the
complainant and added that all the PWs are consistent on
the mode, manner and place of occurrence, they were
cross-examined at length but no dent could be caused in

this statement.
-5-

10. We have also heard the learned counsel for the
respondents at length who opposed the appeal on the
ground that the trial Court acted in accordance with law
and principles concerning the administration of criminal
justice. He submitted that the ocular evidence did not
inspire confidence, therefore, their presence on the spot
was rightly disbelieved. He lastly contended that the
impugned judgment is based on proper appreciation of
evidence and needs no interference.

11. We have given our anxious consideration to the
submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties
and have gone through the record with their able
assistance.

12. It is cardinal principle of criminal
jurisprudence, which has been settled since decades by the
apex Court of the country that when an accused is
acquitted of the charge, he can be brought into barriers of
jail when the findings of the learned Court acquitting the
accused are proved to be perverse, arbitrary, whimsical,
unreasonable, fake, concocted artificial, ridiculous,
shocking, based on misreading of material evidence, on
inadmissible evidence, on a view not possible to gather
from the evidence on the record, highly conjectural, or
based on surmises unwarranted in law. It is also settled

that an accused, who has been acquitted is credited with
-6-

two advantages, one that is available to him of his
innocence at the pre-trial stage and the other which is
earned by him on the basis of the judgment of acquittal
from a Court of competent jurisdiction. The following
authorities noted below, are worth consideration in this
regard:-

13. Keeping in view, these principles, we have
examined the instant case and have not found any wrong
having been committed by the learned Sessions Judge,
Tank, while delivering the judgment of acquittal. We are
in agreement with the view of innocence taken by the
learned trial Judge.
14, Mehmood Alam (PW-8) the first informant is
brother of deceased (Aftab Alam), Muhammad Nazif
(PW-9) being cousin of the deceased is also relative. The
learned trial Court has disbelieved presence of eye-
witnesses on the spot. He has discussed evidence of each

one of them and given cogent reasons for disbelieving
-8-

them. About complainant Mehmood Alam and PW
Muhammad Nazif it is stated that they are highly
interested and inimically deposed towards the
accused/respondents. First reason for disbelieving them
was that there presence on the spot was not natural, that
had they been present at the spot they would have received
some injuries by the bullets fired at them by the
accused/respondents, though they were totally at the
mercy of accused/respondents, they have tried to suppress
their interestedness. Secondly, it was alleged by the
prosecution that complainant, PW Muhammad Nazif and
Muhammad Aslam (father of the complainant) were
sitting in front of the complainant’s baithak. In cross-
examination PW-8 was asked to clarify their actual places
on the spot, he replied that he was at point No. 4, Nazif at
point No. 5 and his father was at point No. 6, but perusal
of the site plan Ex. PW-3, reflects that their presence has
not shown been in front of the baitakh, rather their
presence has been shown towards Northern side of the
baithak. Thirdly in cross-examination PW-9 stated that he
is employed as PTC teacher since 01.09.1985 and was
posted at GPS, Sultan Keroona Amma Khel. He further
stated that during the days of occurrence, the school used
to be started at 8.45 a.m. He admitted that there were no

holidays in the school during those days. He added that he
-9-

was on casual leave for two days. He further stated that he
was granted leave for 22 & 23-10-2008, as he had to
attend ploughing of his fields and his fields/lands are
situated two mile away from the scene of offence. He had
no business to-be with the complainant at 9 a.m, which is
the time of the incident, on that day there was no holiday.
The prosecution has not brought anything in black and
white to show that he was on leave on the day of
occurrence. In the ordinary course this witness should
have been in the school at the relevant time and if for the
sake of arguments, even if it is admitted that he was on
leave on that particular day, he should have been in his
fields at the time of incident. His presence on this ground
at the scene of offence is found to be doubtful.

15. Muhammad Aslam father of the deceased, was
also cited as an eye witness of the incident but he was
given up on the pretext that he is witness of the same fact
and unnecessary. How could it be? A question for
declaring him the unnecessary may not arise as being a
father he is closely related to the deceased. His non
appearance may show that he was not to support the
prosecution story which definitely creates a lawful
presumption against the prosecution that he would not

have deposed in favour of the prosecution, if produced and
-10-

that he was, for being father, just named as an eye witness
on the hope of securing his evidence.

16. No impartial evidence could have come from
the neighbourhood to corroborate the prosecution case,
which of course could have been available due to noise of
fire. Such being the case, the indication and production of
only interested and inter-related persons as witness out of
whom one refrained from appearing as witness to support
them, may not inspire confidence.

17. Another interesting feature of the case is that
the accused had no motive to fire at the deceased. It was
alleged by the prosecution that the accused was restrained
from taking electricity connection by the complainant and
the accused Hidayat ullah came to him on the day of
incident, slapped in his face, thereafter, left the place and
came back with his brother Yusuf Shah duly armed with
Kalashnikov and fired at them, but they escaped unhurt
without receiving a scratch in the incident though they
were empty handed at the time of the incident and were
totally at the mercy of the accused, they were left alive
and selected to kill the brother of the complainant with
whom they have no direct motive and so it may be
inferred that the incident did not take place in the mode

and manner, as it was alleged.
-ll-

18. No doubt, FSL report Ex. PY depicts that 5 .
empties of 7.62 bore recovered from the spot were sent to
FSL, where it was opined that these were fired from
different weapons. The empties were recovered from the
scene of crime on 22.10.2008, but sent to the FSL on
08.11.2002, admittedly, after sixteen days of the incident
and no explanation what to speak of a plausible
explanation was offered by the prosecution for sending the
empties to FSL with inordinate delay. The record is even
silent that who took the empties to FSL, even otherwise
the same being corroborative in nature and if substantive
charge is not proved it would be of no help to prosecution.
19. Again on the question of motive, the learned
trial Court came to the conclusion that it was not
established. It was alleged that the complainant had
restrained the respondent from taking electricity
connection from transformer, was shown as motive. The
accused had nothing to do with the murder of Aftab Alam.
They had come to commit murder of the complainant. If
the respondents wanted to kill him by way of revenge,
they could have easily killed him, but he was spared by
the respondents for no apparent reason and killed his
brother. Had the motive as alleged by the prosecution

been correct, then complainant rather than his brother
-12-

would have been target of the two respondents who had
came to the spot with fire arms.
20. Adverting to abscondence of the accused. No
doubt they were absconder for quite sufficient time and
were declared proclaimed offenders. It is by now settled
that abscondence cannot be made basis for conviction,
because the people do abscond out of fear to be killed in
retaliation and to avoid torture at the hands of police. In
this behalf reliance can be placed on the judgment
reported as Muhammad Sadiq vs The State (2017 SCMR
144) wherein it was held that:
“abscondence of accused for about ten
years. Such abscondence could not be made
sole basis for conviction of accused when
the other prosecution evidence was
doubtful and riddled with contradictions.”
In this context, I am also fortified by the judgment
reported as Rohtas Khan vs The State ((2010 SCMR
566), wherein it was held that
“Abscondence of accused, no doubt, is a
relevant fact, but it can be used as a
corroborative piece of evidence, which
cannot read in isolation but has to be read

alongwith substantive piece of evidence.”

21. In view of the above legal position and state of
evidence as discussed alone, we do not find any reason to
interfere with the order of acquittal rendered by the
learned trial Judge in this case. Consequently, this appeal

and connected appeal No. 04-D of 2017, being bereft of

/

merits, are hereby dismissed.
