ORDER

MUHAMMAD SHAFI SIDDIQUI, J.- The applicants see,
arrest bail in FIR No. 127/2012 under section 392/397/34 PPc
lodged at Police Station Peerabad. .

The facts of the prosecution case as incorporated in the FIR
in terms of the complainant Firdous Khan’s statement are that the
complainant is in business of transport with one Haji Roshan and
has purchased Bus No. K-6583, Model 1990 which was plying on
contract duty. After duty, the vehicle was used to be parked near
the college situated near Pashtoon Market. On 26.3.2012 ic. the
day of incident at 07:00 a.m. when the driver of the complainant
namely Imroz Khan was parking the bus, four persons namely
Suleman Shah, Awal Meer along with two brothers Khaista Meer
Khan and Khan Meer came and on gun point asked driver Imroz
Khan to keep away from the:bus as their money is due from the
bus owner. It was further narrated in the FIR that due to fear the
driver Imroz Khan left the bus, however, he made efforts to solve
the situation but all in vain, hence the instant case was registered.

The applicants were arrested by the Police Station in the
aforesaid FIR. Subsequently the applicants have moved the frst
bail application before the trial Court which was dismissed 0”

her contended that the applicants are ere
os ocent and have falsely been involved in. the above nase ri ly
[ qubmitted by the learned Counsel that the complainant Finddus
jodged the FIR was not present at the place of occurrence
pence he as not witnessed the incident whereas the FIR si
jodged 07 the disclosure of his driver Imroz Khan and it was
gecepted and recoded as ipse-dixit. He has also contended that the.
applicants were arrested on 16.4.2012 and remain in police custody
or considerable period but nothing came out from such
| investigation. The statement of the driver Imroz Khan was - |
| recorded by the Investigation Officer on 03.4.2012 under section
\ 161 Cr.P.C wherein he stated that he did not see weapons and
? stated that two persons were muffled faces whereas one accused
disclosed his name to be Suleman Shah while the other accused
could be identified if brought before him by arranging an
identification parade. However, the iwo muffled face accused
persons were yet to be identified by the driver. It is submitted that
the case of the applicants is of further inquiry and there is a
contradiction between the statements recorded under Sections 154
crP.c. and 161 Cr.P.C. Without prejudice . to the above
contentions, learned Counsel lastly submitted that in terms of
Section 397 PPC the robbery or dacoity committed by the offender
by using any deadly weapon OF causes grievous hurt to any person
would come within the definition of section ibid. Since the ©
applicants/accused have not used the weapon inasmuch as it has
not been used to “fire” it cannot be said that show of weapon
comes under such definition prescribed in Section 397 PPC.
Leamed Counsel for the applicants has relied upon the cases

application of the accused.

I have heard the learned Counsel and perused the matey
available on record. Tal

As far as the last contention of the learned Counce
regarding use of weapon is concerned, I.am not at all convicteq
that the word “use” used in section 397 PPC can be given ,
restricted meaning. In my view, if the accused is armed with the
weapon threatens victims it would come within the definition of
“use of weapon” which in fact would makes it easier for the
accused or other culprits to perform action which they intended to
and hence the definition cannot be restricted to what the leamed
Counsel has submitted. Although these arguments were without
prejudice to the other arguments raised by the learned Counsel,
however it is necessary that the word “use of weapon” should be
defined for its interpretation. If any reference is needed, following

cases can be looked into. : ,

1. PLD 1960 (W.P) Lahore 559 and
2. PLD 1963 SC 737.

Now, I come to the other limbs of arguments. It is apparent
that the statement of driver Imroz Khan was recorded on 03.4.2012
and the names of the applicants are not mentioned in such
statement and he categorically stated therein that at the time 0
incident, he, himself, has not seen weapons. He has further stated
in the statement that one accused person himself disclosed his
name as Suleman Shah through he himself did not say that he
personally knew that Suleman Shah. The applicants have not been
arrested at the spot nor was any independent witness cited. The
applicants were not put to identification parade. It is admitted by
the driver that he himself could not identify rest of the three
accused persons, how the complainant knew their names an
nominated them in the FIR when he had even not witnessed the
incident. It is also apparent that the statements under Sections |

«and 161 Cr.P.C are also in contradiction’ at least to the

exter!

Under the circumstances, the case of the applicants is of

“quiry and therefore, I allow.this application and admit
- hel vpplicants to bail subject to their furnishing surety in the
