ORDER
SHAHNAWAZ TARIQ,J:-      Through captioned pre-arrest bail application,
applicant Zamir Hussain and Mohkumdin have impugned order dated 17.08.2013, passed
by learned III- Additional Sessions Judge, Mirpur Mathelo, whereby their earlier
bail application was declined.
 
2.       Relevant
facts narrated in F.I.R are that on fateful day, applicants duly armed trespassed
in to the plot of complainant and on gun point taken away 02 iron guarders and
04 iron TRs, hence instant F.I.R. 
 
3.       Learned
Counsel for applicant contended that applicants are innocent and have been
falsely implicated in instant crime due to ulterior motives as complainant is already
disputed with them on the question of purchase of subject plot, and he pointed
out page-37 of file which is photocopy of sale agreement executed between the
owner Amir Mehmood and applicant No.2 Mohkumuddin; that previously one
Hafeezullah belonging to applicants’ party had also lodged F.I.R No.91 of 2013,
at Police Station, Mirpur Mathelo, under Sections  324, 337A(ii), 337H(ii),
114, 427, 147, 148, 149, 4452, 447, 511, PPC against the complainant party and
such case is pending before learned Court of Ist Additional Sessions Judge,
Ghotki; that no independent person from the locality came forward to support the
allegations leveled by complainant in F.I.R; that complainant has not mentioned
that how accused persons taken away two Iron guarders and 04 Iron TRs from the
spot; that bail to co-accused Farooq has already been granted by learned trial
Court on same grounds; that applicants joined investigation and their
statements were recorded, but nothing was recovered from them; that neither 
applicants have misused the concession of bail nor they have attempted to
tamper with the prosecution evidence; that alleged offence does not fall within
the ambit of prohibitory clause of Section 497 (1) Cr.P.C,  hence pre-arrest
bail granted to applicants may be confirmed. He relied on the case of Shehzore
and another v. The State (2006 YLR 3167) and Muhammad Daud and another v. The
State and another (2008 SCMR 173). 
 
4.       While
controverting the above submissions, learned Counsel for complainant contended
that case of co-accused Farooque Ahmed to whom bail has been granted by learned
trial Court is totally on different footings and present applicant could not
claim the concession of bail under the rule of consistency; that names of the
applicants with specific role are mentioned in F.I.R. 
 
5.       Learned
APG considering the submissions made by learned Counsel for applicants, extended
no objection for confirmation of bail.
 
6.       Perusal
of the material available on record and consideration of arguments advanced by learned
counsel for the parties coupled with case law emanate that parties are already disputed
with each other and F.I.R No.91 of 2013 was also registered at Police Station
Mirpur Mathelo, by one Hafezullah Mahar who is belong to accused party against
complainant party and such case is sub-judice before the Court of learned Ist
Additional Sessions Judge, Ghotki. Indeed, applicant No.2 is claiming to be
owner of the disputed plot on the strength of sale-deed duly executed between
applicant No.2 and owner of the plot Amir Mehmood on 21.05.2010. Though the
incident occurred during bright day in populated area, but no independent
person came forward to support the allegations leveled by complainant, and even
he has not mentioned in F.I.R that how accused person taken away 2 Iron guarders
and 4 Iron TRs from the place of incident. Even otherwise, no empty was
recovered from the spot during the course of investigation, hence allegations
require serious consideration. Co-accused Farooq Ahmed has already been granted
bail by learned trial Court vide order dated 13.05.2015, against whom same
allegations were levelled.
 
7.       In
the case of Mohammad Daud (Supra) honourable Supreme Court has observed
that co-accused in the case had already been admitted to bail, applicant was
allowed bail in view of the rule consistency in the circumstances.
8.       The
offence punishable under Section 395 PPC provided the quantum of sentence not
less than four years and not more that 10 years. It is well settled that while
examining the question of bail, Court has to consider the minimum aspect of the
sentence if for the alleged offence there are maximum and minimum quantum of
sentences or fine are provided for the offence in schedule.
 
9.       Perusal
of material placed on record reflects that alleged offence does not fall within
the prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C and applicants are also entitled
for grant of bail under the rule of consistency and the refusal of bail at this
stage will not serve any useful purpose when applicants after grant of bail are
regularly attending the trial Court and have not misused the concession of bail
nor attempted to tamper with the prosecution evidence. 
 
10.      Considering
the above facts and circumstances, interim pre-arrest bail already granted to
the present applicants vide order dated 27.08.2013, stands confirmed on the
same terms and conditions. Applicants are directed to appear before learned
trial Court regularly to face their trial. However, learned trial Court would
be at liberty to cancel the bail granted to the applicants in case they misused
the concession of bail.
