IKRAMULLAH KHAN, J. This single judgment
shall dispose of instant petition (WP No.832-P/2017)
filed by petitioner Sahibzada Alamgir and connected
Writ Petition No.843-P/2017 filed by petitioner Olas
Khan because in both petitions, petitioners have
prayed for their release on bail in one and the same
NAB case.

2. Learned counsel for petitioners contended
that the case against the petitioners is that of further

inquiry into their guilt as prima facie, no any such act
has committed by the petitioners, which attract any
provision contained in Section 9(a) of NAB
Ordinance 1999( hereinafter Ordinance) for which the
petitioner could be held responsible in order to charge
them under the Ordinance; that the NAB authorities
had not only twisted facts but also have implicated the
petitioner in the case with malafide, which had
curtailed the liberty of the petitioners in utmost
disregard of the mandate of the Constitution, 1973.
Learned counsel for petitioner namely Sahibzada
Alamgir, while taking us alongwith the available
record contended that petitioner Sahibzada had been
posted as Deputy Director Northern Region,
somewhere in the year 2009, while all the site and
contract were already selected and awarded
respectively prior to his posting, any nexus with the
charges leveled against him, which otherwise are
general in nature and without specification in order to
attract any offence mentioned under Section 9 of the
Ordinance. Both the learned counsel for petitioners at
the conclusion of their argument, vehemently stressed
the hardship facing by petitioners and others similar

accused, who were booked under the NAB Ordinance
in fixation of their Writ Petitions, which consumed
considerable time and made their submissions that
there is no any impediment provided under the NAB
Ordinance, to approach the High Court for release of
accused in term of Section 497 Cr.PC by filing bail
petitions but the office is not entertaining bail petition
in view of Section 9-b of NAB Ordinance and the
procedure adopted since the year 2001, while the bar
placed in Section 9-B of NAB Ordinance, already had
been removed thereafter pronouncement of the
direction of the apex Court rendered therein
“Asfandyar Wali Khan’s Case (PLD 2001 SC 607)
and Section 9-B of the Ordinance was amended
through Ordinance XXXV of 2001, but still bail
petition in term of Section 497 Cr.PC is not
entertained by the office, which is against law.

3. On the other hand, learned DPGs in both
the petitions turn by turn, argued that petitioner
namely Olas Khan was posted as Project Director of
the Project known as “Water Conservation and
Productivity Enhancement through High Efficiency
Irrigation Systems (NWFP component)” and he by

misusing his official authorities, dishonestly and
fraudulently misappropriated the funds provided for
the project and thereby caused loss’ of
Rs.113,995,339/- to the exchequer, when they were
confronted by this Court that what was the role of
accused Sahibzada, they made submissions that he
had facilitated the offence in connivance with co-
accused. On the point of legal preposition put forward
by learned counsel for petitioners that NAB
authorities do not provide complete case record to the
Court and comments which occasioned hardship for
counsel of accused as well as the Court, learned DPG
argued that Section 9(B) of the NAB Ordinance, bar
the jurisdiction of any Court in matter of granting bail
therefore, bail in term of Section 497 Cr.PC could not
be sought in view of express bar as provided under
Section 9(B) of the NAB Ordinance.

4. We have heard learned counsel for
petitioners as well as learned DPGs, in light of
available record and law on the subject.

5. In order to eradicate the menace of
corruption, corrupt practices, misuse and abuse of
power, misappropriation of property and all such like

matters connected and ancillary or incidental thereto,
the National Accountability Bureau Ordinance, 1999
was promulgated with retrospective effect from
1.1.1985.
6. In the original Ordinance, the jurisdiction
of High Court was expressly ousted in matter of bail
and appeal against acquittal or conviction, as well as
the power exercisable under Section 426, 491, 497,
498, 561-A Cr.PC. Not only the jurisdiction of High
Court in term of Section 497 Cr.PC but also in view of
Section 498 Cr.PC was made expressly barred. The
original Section 9(B) of NAB = Ordinance, if
reproduced would be read as:-
9-(b)---- All offences under this
Order shall be non-bailable and
notwithstanding anything contained
in Ss.426,491, 497,498 and 561-A or
any other provision of the Code, or
any other law for the time being in
force no Court (including High
Court), shall have jurisdiction to
grant bail to any person accused of
any offence under this Order.”
7. The bare reading of the afore-stated
provisions of law (then it was) had expressly ousted
the jurisdiction of High Court not only in grant of bail

to an accused in view of and under provisions of

Section 497 Cr.PC, but also under Section 426, 491,
498 & 561-A Cr.PC. Persons arrested and confined
under any provisions of the Ordinance, in order to
seek their release, approach the High Court, by
invoking its jurisdiction under Article 199 of the
Constitution, 1973. The matter came before the apex
Court in “Afsandyar _Wali_Khan’s case supra.
Thereafter the apex Court thoroughly deliberated on
various provisions of the NAB Ordinance, rendered its
findings as such.
8. After pronouncement of the judgment of
apex Court supra, the legislator brought the relevant
amendment in various provisions of NAB Ordinance
including Section 9(B) which after the amendment,
introduced through Ordinance XXXV of 2001
amended the above referred provisions of law with
effect from 10.8.2001, which reads as:-

9-(b)---- All offences under this

Order shall be non-bailable and

notwithstanding anything contained

in Ss.426,491, 497,498 and 561-A or

any other provision of the Code, or

any other law for the time being in

force no Court, shall have

jurisdiction to grant bail to any

person accused of any offence under
this Order.”
9. After the amendment the jurisdiction of the
Accountability Court for grant of bail remained to be
ousted as the word ‘Court’ used in Section 9-B be
construed is Accountability Court only as defined in
Section 5(g) of NAB Ordinance, however, after the
omission of words “including the High Court”
through Ordinance XXXV of 2001, the High Court
can grant bail, on the grounds and on the principle of
law, enumerated by superior Courts, in term of
Section 497 Cr.PC. The embargo and ouster clause of
Jurisdiction of High Court had done away with soon
after the promulgation of Ordinance XXXV of 2001
effective from 1.8.2001.

10. The same view has also been expressed by
the apex Court in case of “Muhammad Saeed Mehdi
Vs_The State etc” (2002 SCMR 282), which has
binding effect on all Courts in term of Article 199 &
185(3) of the Constitution, 1973, which reads as:-

(d) National Accountability Bureau
Ordinance (XVIH of 1999) -------
S.9(b) [as amended] --- Constitution
of Pakistan (1973), Art.199--
Constitutional petition--- _ Post-
arrest bail, grant of --- Ouster of
jurisdiction of High Court to grant
bail in scheduled offences had been
done away with by amendment in
S.9(b) of National Accountability
Bureau Ordinance, 1999, omitting
the words "High Court"--- Even
under unamended provisions of S.
9(b) of the Ordinance, High Court
had jurisdiction under Art. 199 of the
Constitution to grant bail in an
offence under the Ordinance in
appropriate case as the bar of
jurisdiction thereunder being in the
nature of legislative enactment could
not take away its jurisdiction under
Art. 199 of the Constitution.

11. By virtue of the provisions contained in
Section 17 of the NAB Ordinance, the provision of the
Code of the Criminal Procedure, 1898 is applied
mutatis mutandis, to the proceeding under the NAB
Ordinance, which reads as:-

17.. Provisions of the Code to apply:-
(a) Notwithstanding anything
contained in any other law for the
time being in force, unless there is
anything inconsistent with the
provisions of this Ordinance, the
provisions of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898),
Shall mutatis mutandis, apply to
proceedings under this Ordinance.

b) Subject to sub-section (a), the
provisions of Chapter XXIIA of the
Code shall apply to trials under this
Order.

co) Notwithstanding anything
contained in sub-section (a) or sub-
section (b) or in any law for the time
being in force, the Court may, for
reasons to be recorded, dispense with
any provision of the Code and follow
such procedure as it may deem fit in

the circumstances of the case.

d) Notwithstanding anything in

Section 234 of the Code, a person

accused of more offences than one of

the same kind committed during the

space of any number of years, from

the first to the last of such offences,

may be changed with and tried at one

trial for any number of such

offences.”
12. For the reasons mentioned hereinabove,
we are with full agreement with the submission of
learned counsel for petitioners that there is no bar on
the jurisdiction of High Court to entertain, dispose of
and decide bail petition filed by any accused in terms
of Section 497 Cr.PC in cases, registered against them
under the NAB Ordinance, however, no ordinary
Court including the Accountability Court, can
exercise such powers, envisaged under Section 497
Cr.PC, as NAB Ordinance is a special law.
13. No doubt, the NAB Ordinance is a special
law but special law by itself does not exclude the
jurisdiction of High Court in matter of bail in terms of
Section 497 Cr.PC, if specifically the same
jurisdiction is not ousted.

14. Provision of Cr.PC, which is self contained

Code for holding of criminal trial and matter relating
10

thereto has been applicable to proceedings under NAB
Ordinance, 1999 as provided by Section 17-A of the
said Ordinance, including the provisions contained in
Sections 491, 496, 497, 498 and 561-A Cr.PC,
however, the jurisdiction of High Court was barred in
term of Section 9(b) of NAB Ordinance in this
respect. However, after the amendment made by Act
XXXV of 2001, in the NAB Ordinance, the bar of
jurisdiction, was removed. There are many other
special laws, where even the provision of Cr.PC is not
expressly applied, to trials under the respective special
laws but even then, Courts are granting bail under
Section 497 Cr.PC, to accused charged under the
provisions of same special laws on account of the fact
that the application of the Code is not specifically
ousted. For example, the Arms Ordinance, 1965, KPK
Arms Act 2013, Explosive Substances Act 1908,
Drugs Act, Explosive Act 1884, Electricity Act 1910,
the provisions of Gambling Act 1977, the Emigration
Ordinance 1979 etc.

15. Where, a Court has the jurisdiction in
regard to trial of an offence, or having power of

appeals, and if specifically, the application of the
11

Code is not excluded, then both the Court had
jurisdiction to exercise its power envisaged under
Section 497 Cr.PC, however, if such jurisdiction is
expressly, ousted by special enactment, the same
could not be exercised. As mentioned hereinabove,
only the Accountability Court has been barred by
Section 9(2) of the NAB Ordinance, to exercise power
under Section 491, 496, 497, 498, 561-A Cr.PC but
the power of High Court, could not be ousted by the
mere use of word ‘Court’ which is itself defined under
Section 5(g) of the NAB Ordinance, to be meant the
Accountability Court only.

16. Insofar as the submission of learned
counsel in regard to the allegations against the
petitioners are concerned, petitioner namely Olas
Khan being Project Director (now retired) prima facie,
there are sufficient material, so far collected by NAB
against him.

17. The record reveals that the
accused/petitioner had advanced 20% mobilization
amount even to those companies, persons, whose
works were dropped and even the schemes were not

found feasible.
12

18. It is also depicted and palpable on
available record that many schemes for which more
than 80% amount had released were not existed on
grounds but those were commissioned and funds were
released with active connivance of the Project
Director.

19. As it is settled principle of law, that deep
appreciation of facts, while disposing of bail petition
or constitutional petition, in matter of detention, is not
requirement of law, but prima facie from the inquiry
against the petitioner Olas Khan, sufficient and
reasonable documentary proof is available which
makes out a case, in term of Section 9 of the NAB
Ordinance, 1999 against him so he does not deserve
any concession of bail at this stage. So his petition for
release on bail in the instant matter is declined and the
WP No.843-P/2017 filed by him, is dismissed
accordingly.

20. Insofar as the case of petitioner Sahibzada
Alamgir is concerned, admittedly he had posted in the
year 2010, as Deputy Director, when the Project was
already near to completion. Moreover, no any iota

piece of evidence in any documentary form was
13

available on record that he had paid any amount to
any person. His role was subservient to the principle
accused Project Director, but no any direct allegation
of corruption or misuse or abuse of power is alleged
against him by the NAB, however, whether the
petitioner/accused had acted in violation of any law or
rules, benefitting him or any other person, could be
dealt with by the learned trial Court. As the inquiry is
already completed against this accused, where, he had
charged only for connivance and no any direct
allegation, had brought by the NAB therefore, keeping
in view his position and kind of duties, assigned to
him as Deputy Director, for the northern region, he
deserves to be released on bail. So for these reasons,
the Writ Petition No.832-P/2017 filed by petitioner
Sahibzada Alamgir is allowed and he is admitted to
bail provided he furnishes bail bond in the sum of
Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lac) with two sureties
each in the like amount to the satisfaction of learned
Administrative Judge, Accountability Courts,
Peshawar, who shall ensure that the sureties must be

local, reliable and men of means.
14

21. Before we conclude this judgment, it
would be appreciated that this judgment be placed
before his Lordship, the Chief Justice of this Court,

for further orders, in regard to bail petitions pertaining

to NAB cases.
