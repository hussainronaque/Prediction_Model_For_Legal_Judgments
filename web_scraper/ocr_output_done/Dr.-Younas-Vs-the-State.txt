JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.-

My this common judgment shall govern the

instant bail petition filed by petitioner

Dr. Younas and connected bail petition

No.1122-P/2015, filed by petitioner Dr. Samin,

as both are the outcome of one and the same FIR

No.529 dated 30.05.2015, registered under

sections 324/337-F (1i)/34 PPC, in Police Station

Mathra, Peshawar.

2. On 30.05.2015 at 17.00 hours, Kifayat

Ullah, in injured condition in Trauma room

LRH, Peshawar, reported to local police that on

the fateful day he alongwith his brother

Dr. Muhammad Tariq, Khan Shafiq ur Rehman,

Babar Shaheen and Zeeshan Hamid Tariq, was

present in Tirai Payan Primary School/ Polling

Station, when in the meantime, at 16.00 hours,

petitioners alongwith absconding co-accused

Jamshed Khan, duly armed with firearms and

sharp objects, came there and inflicted blows on

the persons of Babar Shaheen, Zeshan, Hamid

Tariq and Dr. Muhammad Tariq as a result they

sustained injuries; that they also opened fire at

them with the intention to do them away,

resultantly, he and Shafiq ur Rehman got hit and

injured. Previous blood feud has been alleged as

motive behind the incident. The occurrence is

stated to have been witnessed by all the injured

PWs.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

Record of case FIR No.584 dated 30.05.2015

registered under sections 324/337-F(iv)/337-A

(ii)/337-L (/148/149 PPC Police Station

Mathra Peshawar, received.

4. No doubt, in this untoward

incident six persons have sustained injuries, out

of whom, the injuries of two have been declared

as grievous, but at the same time I am

confronted with FIR No.584 of the same date

i.e. 31.05.2015 registered in the same Police

Station, wherein complainant Muhammad

Samin, the petitioner/accused in the instant case,

has nominated all the injured of the instant case

as accused for attempting at their lives and

causing them injuries. Though, site plan has not

been prepared in case FIR No.584, but as

evident from the FIR, place of occurrence of

both the incident is the same. Similarly, the date

of occurrence and the parties of the two FIRs are

also same. However, due to slight variation in

time of incident of the two FIRs, the cases

cannot be termed as cross-cases as per the

principle of cross cases set out by the Apex

Court in Plethora of judgments. However, at the

moment, FIR No.584 of the even date and of

the same Police Station cannot be thrown away

from consideration. Keeping in juxtaposition

both the FIRs, I am confronted with two

versions about the same incident wherein

damage in the shape of causing injuries has been

caused to both the parties. At the moment it is

yet to be determined during trial after recording

evidence as to which of the two versions is

correct, which makes the case of the petitioners

arguable for the purpose of bail, hence, they are

entitled to concession of bail.

Accordingly, both the petitions are

allowed. Accused/petitioners are admitted to bail

provided each one of them furnishes bail bonds

in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two sureties
each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
learned [Illaqa Judicial Magistrate/MOD,
concerned. The sureties must be local reliable
and men of means.
