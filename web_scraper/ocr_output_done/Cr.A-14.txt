NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
namely Mst. Bakht Siraja (respondent) they found
dead body of one Ibrahim son of Dilfaroz,
lathered in blood. Respondent who was then
shown to be complainant, lodged report of the
occurrence by stating that she had been present in
her room, the previous night. Her father-in-law
namely Fazal Qayum, who had been old and
feeble person, had been taken out of the house by
her daughter Noor Zia aged about 14/15 years for
urination. As soon as he sit to urinate, the
deceased, then alive, was present there who
caught hold of daughter of the complainant
namely Noor Zia and took her to a room nearby.
On hue and cry of her daughter, the complainant
took her axe and as soon as she entered the room,
she found her daughter in clutches of the
deceased. To save her daughter from being raped,
she gave a blow to the deceased with her axe,
which resulted in causing injuries to him and he
started trying to leave the place. The complainant
repeated the axe blows, as a result of which he
(deceased) fell down on the ground and died.
People of the locality were informed the
following morning. From identity card of the
accused, he was identified as Ibrahim son of

Dilfaroz, who was alleged to have entered the

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
house with the intention of committing rape, due
to which he had been taken to death.

3. The ibid FIR (Ex. P-A) was
registered on the basis of ‘Murasila (Ex. P-B) sent
to police station by the SHO. Respondent Mst.
Bakht Siraja was shown to be the complainant
as well as accused in the case in hand.
Subsequently, she was arrested during the course
of investigation, wherein she also confessed her
guilt and her confessional statement was recorded
by the learned judicial Magistrate concerned.
Blood soaked earth was recovered in the case in
hand, beside the axe, with which deceased had
been done to death. Said axe was also sent to
Forensic Science Laboratory, report whereof was
received and placed on file. On completion of
investigation in the case, complete challan was
submitted in Court. Initially, accused/respondent
was convicted and sentenced to ten (10) years
simple imprisonment under section 302 (a) PPC
by the learned trial Court vide judgment dated
27.08.2010 of the Court of learned Additional

which was allowed vide judgment dated

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
29.03.2012 by setting aside judgment of the
learned trial Court and case was remanded to
learned trial Court with the directions to frame
fresh charge against the accused and parties were
also allowed to produce additional evidence.

4. After remand, charge was framed
against accused/respondent on 17.05.2012, to
which she pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
Prosecution produced eight (8) witnesses and
closed their evidence, whereafter statement of the
lady accused was recorded under section 342
Cr.P.C wherein she denied killing the deceased
and resiled from her earlier confessional statement
recorded during the course of investigation.

5. The learned trial Court on
conclusion of proceedings in the trial, acquitted
the accused/respondent vide impugned judgment
dated 15.12.2012 of the Court of learned
Additional Sessions Judge Swat at Kabal. Feeling
aggrieved therefrom, the appellant who was son
of the deceased has filed the instant appeal against
acquittal of accused/respondent.

6. We have heard arguments of
learned counsel for the parties, learned Astt: A.G

for State and perused the record.

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
Ts Perusal of record reveals that the
prosecution had mainly been relying upon
confessional statement of the accused, recovery of
axe on her pointation, pointation of the place of
occurrence by the accused and recovery of dead
body of the deceased from house of the accused,
for establishing case against accused/respondent.
There has not been any direct evidence in respect
of commission of the offence in the shape of any
eyewitness account except the confessional
statement of the accused.

8. Dr. Bahadar Shah, medical officer
civil hospital Kabal, who had examined dead
body of the victim, was examined as APW-1, who
has given detailed descriptions of the numerous
wounds received by deceased in his examination-
in-chief. He was cross-examined at length. One
Dawa Khan was examined as APW-2, who had
been marginal witness of the recovery memo Ex.
Ex.APW-2/1, vide which blood soaked earth had
been taken in possession. In his presence, the axe
which was shown to have been recovered on
pointation of the accused was also produced and
exhibited as Ex. P-2 and recovery memo in that
respect is Ex. APW-2/2. He was also marginal

witness of recovery memo Ex. PW-2/3, vide

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
which the Investigating Officer had taken into
possession other belongings of deceased including
mobile phone, Sim and watch etc. In his cross-
examination conducted before remand of the case
he had stated that he was not belonging to the area
where the deceased had died but had been his
co-villager and belonging to same caste.
Appellant namely Alamgir has testified as APW-
3. He has given his account of departure of his
father from their shop, before the night of
occurrence. Investigating Officer of the case was
examined as APW-4. APW-5 was statement of
learned Judicial Magistrate, who had recorded
confessional statement of the lady/accused. The
Magistrate was also cross-examined who has
stated in his cross-examination that after
recording confessional statement of the accused,
he had handed back the lady to police. He further
added that she had been handed back to the police
for the purpose of taking her to jail. He also
admitted as correct that the certificate was
pre-printed. He however denied the suggestion
that he had not filled the said certificate himself.
He denied the suggestion that the lady accused
had been under strain and duress, at the relevant

time. Lady Constable namely Yasmeen was

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
examined as APW-6 who had deposed in respect
of recovery of the mobile Sims. Lady doctor
Nagis Alam was examined as APW-7, who had
examined Mst. Noor Zia, daughter of the accused.
She had found a single bite mark on her left face.
Muhammad Ghawas Khan, SHO, who had
recorded first report of the occurrence was
examined as APW-8. In his statement, the
‘Murasila’ drafted by him was exhibited as Ex.
APW. 8/1 and injury sheet as Ex. APW-8/3. He
was also subjected to a lengthy cross-examination
by the learned counsel for accused/respondent,
whereafter evidence of prosecution was closed.

9. Accused/respondent had recorded
her confession immediately after the occurrence,
which appears to be clear from the element of any
coercion or duress and got recorded by her
voluntarily. Statement of Magistrate who had
recorded confession has been recorded as APW-5
in support of the confessional statement and there
is no plausible reason for discarding the same.
Beside the confession of respondent there has
been a lot of other circumstantial evidence which
establishes that the murder has been committed by
respondent. Such evidence includes, lodging of a

report in shape of ‘Murasila’ at her home as Ex.

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
Oe

PB, recovery of the blood stained axe on her
pointation, medical examination of daughter of
the lady wherein imprints of human bite was
found on her cheek coupled with her defence
taken in her statement recorded under section 342
Cr.P.C where she had stated that the deceased had
made an attempt for raping her daughter. Dead
body of the deceased had also been recovered
from house of the accused/lady. All these pieces
of circumstantial evidence do establish the fact
that deceased had been done to the death as a
result of the blows he received from this lady
accused. The learned trial Court has recorded
findings in the impugned judgment that
prosecution has been able to prove that it was
respondent/accused who had committed the
offence but in exercise of right of private defence
and thereby she has been given benefit of section
100 of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter
referred to as “PPC”). It is important to be noted
that accused/respondent has not filed any appeal
against the findings in the judgment, impugned
herein.

10. Evidence of prosecution transpire
that deceased had made an attempt for raping

daughter of the accused who was about 13/14

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
years of age. It is also clear from evidence of
prosecution that this lady was solely responsible
for protecting her younger daughter at the relevant
time, as her father-in-law was feeble and infirm
person and there had been no male member living
in her house. In normal circumstances, this fact
may have been argued that due to large number of
injuries on body of the deceased, it can be inferred
that right of private defence had been exceeded,
making the accused liable for commission of the
offence, but the instant case has its own peculiar
circumstances. It needs mention here that right of
private defence extend to causing of death in case
of an assault with the intention of committing
rape, according to section 100 of PPC, which is

reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

S. 100. When the right of private defence of the
body extends to causing death: The right of
private defence of the body extends, under the
restrictions mentioned in the last preceding
section, to the voluntary causing of death or of
any other harm to the assailant, if the offence
which occasions the exercise of the right be of
any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated,
namely:--

First: Such an assault as may reasonably cause
the apprehension that death will otherwise be the
consequence of such assault;

Secondly: Such an assault as may reasonably
cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will
otherwise be the consequence of such assault;
Thirdly: An assault with the intention of
committing rape;

Fourthly: An assault with the intention of
gratifying unnatural lust.

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-10-

Fifthly: An assault with the intention of
kidnapping or abduction.

Sixthly: An assault with the intention of
wrongfully confining a _ person, under
circumstances which may reasonably cause him
to apprehend that he will be unable to have
recourse to the public authorities for his release.

It is also noticeable that as per first
description of the onslaught, given in the above
reproduced provision of law, right of private
defence is shown to have been extending to
voluntary causing of death in a case where the
assault may reasonably cause the apprehension
that death will otherwise be the consequence of
such an assault. Same was the case with the
second clause which provided that such right
would be available in case of a grievous hurt with
an explanation given by legislature that where
grievous hurt would otherwise be a consequence
of such an assault. No such qualification has been
provided in the case of an assault with the
intention of committing rape. We can therefore
safely say that right of defence can easily be
claimed for neutralizing an assault with the
intention of committing rape than the case of
assaults with the apprehension of causing death or
grievous hurt. The right of private defence, does

not allows a person to inflict more harm than it is

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-ll-

necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence,
according to section 99 of PPC, but the quantum
of force required for warding off danger may not
be measured in golden scales, as held by the
Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of “Mashal Khan
v/s The State” reported as PLD 1988 Supreme
Court 25. It was sufficient that causing of death
was permissible in exercise of private defence of
body against an assault with the intention to
commit rape in the case in hand, according to
section 100 of PPC. “Once right of defence is
established” as held by Hon’ble Apex Court in the
case of “Muhammad Yaqoob v/s The State”
reported “1992 SCMR 1983” “same cannot be
defeated lightly”. It has also been laid therein that
force must be proportionate to the injury.
Numerous blows have no doubt been caused to
deceased in the case in hand, on account of which
learned counsel for appellant, have been claiming
that right of private defence have been exceeded,
but repetition of blows may have been the result
of insecurity that this lady was feeling in a state
where she was confronted with assault of a
grownup man and having no other capable male
member in her house to protect her and her

daughter. She was no doubt in an insecure

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
=12is

condition, was not used to such like situations and
when confronted with such a predicament she
would definitely have been having apprehensions
of a counter attack by the deceased. The fact of
chasing the accused, till the door of the house,
may also be the result of some apprehension and
the desire to save herself from a counter attack
apprehended in the circumstances. Besides,
presence of numerous injuries on body of the
deceased cannot be taken as_ conclusive
evidence of the accused/lady exceeding the right
of private defence. In quite similar situation,
this Court in its judgment in the case of “Mst.
Gul Naz v/s The State” reported as 2011 P Cr.L
J_1190 had extended the benefit of right of
private defence to accused in the case, by
observing as follows;

“The learned trial Judge while drawing the
impugned judgment did not stop nor took a pause
to think with a judicial mind that the appellant
with her young daughter and two (02) minor sons
were entrapped in a situation, where, they could
not find any other way to wriggle out or thwart
the abominable attempt the other way but to
incapacitate the man, marching towards the girl
to ravish her, thus, the learned Judge has failed to
do justice in the matter. He has unnecessarily and
without just cause laboured in drawing a
judgment in favour of the prosecution, ignoring
all the above facts. The appellant stood firm to her

stance, taken in the F.I.R., in her confession and
at the trial and despite of availability of legal

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
+13 «

advice, she did not retrace rather, told the whole
truth to assist the Court for reaching at a just
conclusion, however, she was given altogether
undesirable treatment, punishing her for no
wrongful act.”

Existence of numerous injuries on
body of the deceased may not therefore be taken
as a conclusive proof of disproportionate use of
right of private defence by the lady accused,
particularly in the circumstances narrated above.
Case of the accused/respondent had been falling
in the general exception contained in sections 96
and 100 PPC and benefit of the same has rightly
been extended to her by learned trial Court
through the impugned judgment. We are not
inclined to take a different view.

11. It is important to be noted that in the
case in hand, after remand, respondent/accused
had been facing trial on the charge of commission
of the offence under Ikrah-i-Tam. Denovo charge
had been framed in pursuance to earlier judgment
of this Court wherein case had been remanded to
the learned trial Court with the direction to frame
charge denovo under section 303 (a) PPC, which
was accordingly framed and the trial was
conducted thereafter. The learned trial Court,

through the impugned judgment has acquitted the

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
214 =

accused of the commission of offence by
extending her benefit of right of private defence.
There is a difference between commission of an
offence under Ikrah-i-Tam and an act done in
exercise of the right of private defence. A murder
committed under Jkrah-i-Tam is a criminal act
which ensues a criminal liability under section
303 (a) PPC, while a murder committed in
exercise of valid right of private defence falls in
general exceptions and carries no criminal
liability. The distinguishing features between the
two also include the fact that right of private
defence is exercised against the assailant, while an
offence committed under Jkrah-i-Tam is
punishable for the reason that it is committed
against a third person. In the latter case, the
person who puts another under [krah-i-Tam or
Ikrah-i-Naqis and the person who commits an
offence under /krah-i-Tam, both are liable for
commission of offences albeit with certain
variations. Ikrah-i-Tam is a kind of coercive
duress, to which a person is subjected for making
him commit an offence. [krah-i-Tam is defined
under section 299-G PPC as “putting any person,
his spouse or any of his blood relations within the

prohibited degree of marriage in fear of instant

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
#15

death or instant permanent impairing of any
organ of the body or instant fear of being
subjected to sodomy or zina-bil-jabr”. Section
303 (a) PPC provides that when a murder is
committed under Jkrah-i-Tam the person
committing the murder may be imprisoned with a
term which may extend to twenty-five years but
shall not be less than ten years and the person
causing Ikrah-i-Tam shall be punished for the
kind of gatl committed as a consequence of his
Ikrah-i-Tam. This clearly envision a case where
murder of a third person is committed and the
sections of law makes both the persons, who has
put another person under /krah-i-Tam, as well as
the person who has been subjected to Jkrah-i-Tam
for committing murder of another person,
subjected to criminal liability and the ensuing
penalty. Section 96 of PPC on the other hand
provides that nothing is an offence which is done
in exercise of the right of private defence. Right
of private defence of body and property has been
provided in section 97 PPC and the extent of
private defence for causing death of another
person has been provided in section 100 PPC. No
criminal liability stands constituted when a person

is murdered in exercise of a right of private

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-16-

defence. It is thus clear that in cases where the
right of private defence is available there is no
applicability of section 303 (a) PPC. If murder of
a person who has put another in Jkrah-i-Tam is
committed, then the case would be covered by
section 100 PPC, rather than section 303 (a) PPC.
If murder of another person is committed under
Ikrah-i-Tam then section 303 (a) PPC would be
attracted to facts and circumstances of the case. In
holding so, reference may also be made to
judgment of the Hon’ble Lahore High Court in
the case of “The State v/s Hamid Ali_alias
Ahmad Ali” reported as 2002 YLR 4008, where
the Hon’ble Court has dealt with the issue in the

following words;

“The bare perusal of section 299(g), P.P.C. shows
that the culprit for the commission of this offence
would be a person who puts any person, his
spouses or any of his blood relations within the
prohibited degree of marriage in fear of instant
death or instant permanent impairing of any
organ of the body or instant fear of being
subjected to sodomy or Zina-bil-Jabr. In the
present case, learned trial Court has accepted the
defence plea that Hamid Ali alias Ahmad Ali
appellant was under the instant fear of being
subjected to sodomy by the deceased and his
companion and in order to save himself, appellant
committed the murder of Abdul Jabbar deceased
and caused injury to Muhammad Afzaal P. W.11.
The ingredients of section 299(g), P.P.C. were not
attracted against the appellant rather in the
circumstances actual culprit for the offence under
section 299(g), P.P.C. read with section 303,

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
=17.-

P.P.C. were the deceased and his companion
namely Muhammad Afzaal P.W.11.

20. Be that as it may, since defence plea of the
appellant that he caused injury to the deceased
and Muhammad Afzaal P. W.11, as he was under
instant fear of being subjected to sodomy has been
accepted, this case would be covered under
section 100, clause fourthly, P.P.C. and he is
entitled to get the benefit of right of self-defence.”

Similar observation has also been
recorded by the Hon’ble Baluchistan High

Court in its judgment in the case of “Abdul

Qadeer_and_others v/s State _and_ others”

reported as PLJ 2010 Cr.C. (Quetta) 116 as

follows;

“Section 303 (a) P.P.C provides punishment for
a person who commits Qatl under Ikrah-e-tam
as well as for the person who causes such
Ikrah-e-tam, therefore, if he commits murder of
that person who had put him, his spouse or any
of his blood relations within the prohibited
degree of marriage in fear of instant death or
instant permanent impairing of any of the organ
of body or instant fear of being subjected to
sodomy or Zina Bil Jabar, the said clause would
not be attracted otherwise the second part
would become redundant which provides
punishment for the person causing such Ikrah-
e-tam, in other words Qatl is in respect of
another person and not the person who has
cause Ikrah-e-tam as otherwise person causing
Tkrah-e-tam could not be punished under the
second part aat-all. Furthermore; such
interpretation would also negate the provision
relating to right of private defence which
extends to causing death in cases where such
assault causes apprehension of death or
grievous hurt or is with the intention of
committing rap, unnatural lust or kidnapping or
ADAUCTION......00eereeeeeeees ”

The learned trial Court has
therefore rightly acquitted the accused of the
charge under section 303 (a) PPC and has
rightly extended her the right of private defence
as provided in section 100 PPC. The appeal in
hand is therefore found to have been lacking
merits and same is accordingly dismissed.
