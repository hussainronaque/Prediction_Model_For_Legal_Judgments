ORDER

Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, J.: It is not disputed that Mst. Taj
Mohallah, an injured eyewitness, had not been produced during
the trial and in her earlier statement recorded under section 512,
Cr.P.C. she had not implicated respondent No. 1 in the alleged
murder or murderous assault. The eyewitnesses produced by the
prosecution were residents of different places and no independent
proof had been adduced before the trial court establishing the
stated reasons for their availability with the deceased at the
relevant time. The said eyewitnesses had claimed that their hands ; |
and clothes had been stained with blood due to handling of the
deceased immediately after the occurrence but no proof was |

available in that regard on the record of the case. The eyewitnesses

produced by the prosecution were equally relevant to the alleged
motive but they had not been harmed by respondent No. 1 in any
manner. An FIR in respect of the alleged occurrence had been
registered after preliminary investigation denuding it of its worth.
The medical evidence had contradicted the eyewitnesses in many
ways. The alleged abscondance of respondent No. 1 had not been
established in a proper and lawful manner. For all these reasons
the High Court had concluded that the prosecution had failed to
prove its case against respondent No. 1 beyond reasonable doubt
and in the circumstances of the case we have not been able to take
a view of the matter different from that taken by the High Court.

This petition is, therefore, dismissed and leave to appeal is refused.
