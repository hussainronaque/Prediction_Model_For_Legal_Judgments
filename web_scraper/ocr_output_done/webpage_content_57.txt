This appeal under
section 417 Cr.P.C. against the acquittal of respondent Nos. 1 & 2 has been
instituted on 13.11.2004. 
 
By
order dated 22.2.2013 on the demise of respondent No. 1 namely Ghulam Mustafa
proceedings against him were abated. It appears that the appellant is not
appearing since 30.5.2006 and due to his non-appearance, NBWs were also issued
against him against which an application CMA No. 3315/2006 was filed on
15.9.2006 for recalling the order dated 01.8.2006, which is pending.
Intentional and deliberate absence of appellant and his counsel shows their
lack of interest to contest the appeal filed against the acquittal judgment
pronounced on 09.10.2004 by learned Judicial Magistrate   Karachi-West. Even
otherwise, perusal of the judgment shows that with sound reasons and after
discussing the evidence of PWs and material brought by the prosecution on the
record, the judgment was pronounced which does not require any interference by
this court. Consequently, the appeal filed against the acquittal of respondents
No. 1 & 2 stands dismissed.
