ORDER
Date ofhearing: 31.01.2018

ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- This petition

within the meanings of section 561-A Cr.P.C
has been directed against the order dated
10.3.2016 rendered by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge/Izafi Zila Qazi, Dir Upper,
whereby learned Court while granting bail to
the petitioner/accused also directed the
petitioner to deposit the compensation amount

of Arsh equal to 5% of Diyat.

2, In essence, the present petitioner
being accused in the case FIR No.340 dated
03.4.2015 registered under section 337-A(ii)

PPC at Police Station Dir, moved bail petition

Sebz Al" (S.B)} HONBLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAG IBRAHIM
before the learned Additional Sessions
Judge/Izafi Zila Qazi, Dir Upper, which was
accepted and the petitioner/accused was
admitted to bail by furnishing bail bonds in
the sum of Rs.80,000/- with two sureties, but
at the same time, he was also directed to
deposit amount of Arsh equal to 5% of Diyat,
which shall be paid to the complainant/injured
as compensation, if the prosecution succeeded
to establish guilt of the accused after
conclusion of trial otherwise he will be at
liberty to withdraw the same. Pursuant to bail
order dated 10.3.2016, in addition to bail
bonds, an amount of Rs.85,000/- was also
deposited by the petitioner in the learned
Lower Court as Arsh. Feeling aggrieved to the
extent of imposing this condition on the

petitioner/accused, he filed the instant petition.

3. Arguments heard and record gone
through.
4. The moot question, which is to be

answered by this Court through this order, is

Sabz aw" (S.B) HONBLE MA, JUSTICE ISHTIAG MERAH
as to whether a Court at bail stage while
releasing an accused on bail subject to
furnishing of bail bonds can simultaneously
impose the condition of depositing the amount
of Arsh/Diyat in advance or otherwise. To
answer this question, it would be appropriate,
first to see that what is bail? Bail has not been
defined in the Code. However, the word ‘bail’

has acquired a clear meaning in our legal

system. In case of ‘Mian Mahmud Ali Qasuri

and another Vs. The State’ reported in PLD
1963 SC 478, the following observation was

made in respect of ‘bail’.

“The connotation of the word
‘bail’ itself, as understood in law,
supports the position adopted by
the learned counsel on behalf of
the appellants. An accused
person is said, at common law, to
be admitted to bail, when he is
released from the custody of the
officers of the Court and is
entrusted to the custody of
persons known as his sureties,
who are bound to produce him to
answer, at a specified time and
place, the charge against him and
who in default of so doing are
liable to forfeit such sum as is
specified when bail is granted.”

Sebz Ai (S.B) HOIPELE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAG IGRAHNA
Chapter XXXIX of the Code of
Criminal Procedure deals with bail matters.
Bare reading of section 497 Cr.P.C would
reveal that the same nowhere empowers the
Court to ask for cash/security deposit, rather
in a case falling within the ambit of section
497 (2) Cr.P.C bail can be granted to an
accused with or without the sureties. Section
498 Cr.P.C deals with the amount of bail
bonds, whereas section 499 Cr.P.C deals with
bond of accused and his sureties, which is

reproduced as under for ready reference.

“499, Bond of accused and
sureties. -(1) Before any person is
released on bail or released on his
own bond, a bond for such sum of
money as the police-officer or
Court, as the case may be, thinks
sufficient shall be executed by
such person and, when he is
released on bail, by one or more
sufficient sureties conditioned
that such person shall attend at
the time and place mentioned in
the bond, and shall continue so to
attend until otherwise directed by
the police officer or Court, as the
case may be.”

In addition to the above, the only

one provision i.e. section 513 of the Code of

Sabz Air (S.B) HONSLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAG IBRAHIM
Criminal Procedure provides mechanism for
depositing cash amount instead of surety
bond, which is reproduced below for the sake

of convenience:

“513, Deposit instead of
recognizance. When any person
is required by any Court or
officer to execute a bond, with or
without sureties, such Court or
officer may, except in the case of
a bond for good behavior, permit
him to deposit a sum of money or
Government promissory notes to
such amount as the Court or
officer may fix, in lieu of
executing such bond.”

The above referred section would
construe that the deposit of amount is an
option available to the accused in case he is
unable to arrange sureties for his release on
bail, if already granted by the Court, as the
words of ‘in lieu of executing such bond’ have
been used, therefore, in the impugned bail
order there was no need to specifically bound
down the petitioner/accused with such a
condition that too at bail stage. Reliance is

placed on the case of ‘Masood Khan_Vs. the

Sabz Alt (S.B) HONBLE MR, JUSTICE ISHTIAG IBRAHIN
State’ reported in 1996 MLD 502, wherein it

had been held that.-

“The accused belongs to Lahore
and does not seem to have
sufficient links at Peshawar and
hence his learned counsel as well as
his mother and wife have stated at
the bar on behalf of the accused
that the deposit of cash amount
would be preferred and so is
prayed for. The reason being
genuine, the prayer of the learned
counsel is accepted and under
section 513, Cr.P.C, the accused is
permitted to deposit the amount in
cash.”

5. In the present case, as the
required bail bonds have already been
executed on behalf of the petitioner/accused
by his sureties, therefore, depositing the
amount of Arsh particularly at this stage
would serve no useful purpose. Moreso, it
appears that the findings of the learned Lower
Court in the bail granting order to the extent
of the imposing the condition of depositing
the cash amount does not speak to have been
given within the spirit of section 513 of the
Cr.P.C, which is an enabling provision and

provides that except in cases of bonds for

Sabz al" (S.B) HOWBLE MR, JUSTICE {SHTIAQ IBRAHIM
maintaining good behavior, a Court can direct
an accused to deposit cash amount in fit cases,
however, nothing exceptional could be
noticed in this case nor the learned Lower
Court did record its findings in the impugned
order to that effect and in absence of such
exposure by the learned Lower Court in the
impugned order. Moreover, according to
section 53 of the PPC, Arsh is punishment,
which is to be awarded to an accused if he is
found guilty of the offence charged with,
therefore, on this reason, there would be
substance in the argument of the learned
counsel for the petitioner/accused that such
directions in advance to the petitioner
amounts to his pre-trial conviction, which is
not justified at this stage. Furthermore, it is
not the case here that the amount of bail bonds
or security has been substituted on the request
of the petitioner/accused and the fact of
having no objection on the part of learned
counsel for the petitioner/accused to deposit

the amount of Arsh on his behalf for his

release on bail itself does not confer any
jurisdiction/authorization upon a Court. In
addition to the above, there was no
compromise in the case in hand to laid down
such condition. As such, the impugned order
to the extent of such condition is not
maintainable. Thus, this petition is allowed
and the impugned order is modified only to
that extent. The petitioner/accused may
accordingly withdraw the amount of
Rs.85,000/- so deposited by him in the learned

Court below.
