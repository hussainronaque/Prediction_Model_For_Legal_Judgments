JUDGMENT

WIQAR AHMAD, J.- My this order is directed to

‘dispose of Criminal Revision bearing No. 33-M of

2019 filed by the petitioner Dilawar Syed against

the judgments of two Courts below.

2. Petitioner was alleged to have been
driving Suzuki Carry bearing registration No. BA-
8231 Peshawar, chassis No. 843023 and engine
No. 726504, when it was seized by the local police
under sections 523/550 Cr. PC on 17.07.2015 and
daily diary report No. 37 was entered in the
relevant register. Subsequently, an inquiry under
section 157 (1) Cr. PC was initiated. During the
course of inquiry, it was found that chassis number

of the vehicle had been tampered which resulted

into registration of FIR bearing No. 321 registered
on 29.08.2015 in Police Station Ouch, District Dir
Lower under sections 419/468/471 PPC against the
accused/petitioner namely Dilawar Syed son of

Rahmat Syed.

3. On completion of investigation,
complete challan was put in Court, charge was
framed by the learned Judicial Magistrate on
10.09.2016. The accused/petitioner denied the
charge and claimed trial. Prosecution produced as
many as nine (09) witnesses, where after statement
of accused was recorded under section 342 Cr. PC.
Thereafter, the accused/petitioner was convicted by
the Court of learned Judicial Magistrate vide its
judgment dated 28.02.2019 and sentenced as

follows;

i. Under section 468 PPC to undergo 1
year along with fine of Rs. 5000/- and in
default, he shall further undergo for
one month simple imprisonment.

ii. Under section 471 PPC to undergo 1
year along with fine of Rs. 5000/7 and in
default, he shall further undergo for

one month simple imprisonment.

4. The convict/petitioner filed an appeal
before the learned Sessions Judge, Dir Lower at
Timergara which was entrusted for adjudication to
the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Dir Lower
at Chakdara. The learned appellate Court vide its
judgment dated 19.03.2019 partially allowed the
appeal to the effect that the accused was acquitted
from the charge under section 468 PPC, his
conviction under section 471 PPC was however
maintained and the recovered vehicle was ordered
to be confiscated to the State. Feeling aggrieved of
the said order, the convict/petitioner has filed the
instant criminal revision on the grounds given

therein.

5. Learned counsel for the convict/
petitioner submitted that the prosecution lacked the
requisite evidence against him as no direct
evidence of his involvement in the commission of
alleged offence could be brought on record. He
submitted that the convict/petitioner was entitled to
acquittal but was unjustifiably convicted which
order has also been partially maintained by the
learned appellate Court - without any legal
justification.

6. The learned Assistant Advocate
General appearing on behalf of the State submitted
in rebuttal that the prosecution has been successful
in proving the case against the convict/ petitioner.
He further added that recovery of vehicle had been
proved which was found chassis tampered and its

registration number was also found to be fake.

7. I have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the convict/petitioner, learned Assistant
Advocate General for the State and perused the

record.

8. Perusal of record reveals that the
convict/petitioner has been acquitted under section
468 PPC by the Court of learned Additional
Sessions Judge, Dir Lower at Chakdara as evidence
of the accused committing any forgery could not be
found by the said Court. The only offence for
which he was convicted was under section 471
PPC, which provided punishment for using any
document fraudulently or dishonestly as genuine
which a person knows or has reason to believe that

same is a forged document; such an act has been

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
@

provided to be punishable as he has forged the

document.

9. The prosecution in my opinion could
not prove use of the forged document by the
convict/petitioner as genuine. Among the witnesses
of prosecution, in whose presence the vehicle was
recovered at the time of occurrence PW-7 namely
Said Zaman Shah Khan SHO and PW-8 namely
Mohsin Ali (belt No. 3038) were produced in
Court, while other witness of the recovered vehicle
namely Shah Zeb (belt No. 1161) was abandoned
during the course of prosecution evidence. None of
the witnesses had ever stated that the
accused/petitioner had ever presented them any
registration book or used the same as genuing.
Beside the two witnesses, no evidence could be
produced that the accused/ petitioner had ever used
the fake registration book as genuine at the time of
plying the vehicle ‘on the road. A copy of
registration book was however stated by the other
PWs to have been produced before the
Investigating Officer by the accused/ petitioner. To
this effect, statement of PW-5 namely Fayaz-ur-

Rahman Head Constable was recorded who has

Abdul Sabooh/* -(S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
6

stated in his examination-in-chief that the
accused/petitioner produced registration book in
respect of the vehicle on 22.07.2015 before the I.O.
He could not tell about the number of pages of the
registration book. PW-6 i.e. the Inquiry Officer has
stated that he took into possession copy of the
registration book which was being presented by the
accused/petitioner. PW-9 has also stated that the
Inquiry Officer took into possession the registration
book exhibited as Ex PW 6/2 in his presence. The
original registration book has nowhere been
produced in evidence. Muharir of the Police Station
appeared as CW-1 but categorically stated that the
entry of registration book had never been made in the
register No. 19. In this regard, he also produced daily
diary bearing No. 53 dated 12.02.2019 as Ex CW

1/1.

10. As stated earlier, accused/petitioner has
nowhere used the registration book as genuine while
plying the vehicle on record. At the time of seizure of
the vehicle also the accused had not produced the
registration book. So far as recovery of copy of
the registration book from the accused during
the course of inquiry is concerned; it is important

to be noted that in this respect, recovery

Abdul Sabooh/* {S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
7

memo Ex PW 6/2 was drafted, wherein it has been
stated that the registration book was taken into
possession by the 1.0 on 22.07.2015 but while
appearing as witness, he has produced a copy of the
registration book and the original registration book
could nowhere be produced during trial. Non
production of the original registration book during
trial, when it has been so mentioned in the recovery
memo that original had been taken into possession,

makes the case of prosecution doubtful.

11. Even if we assume the production of
registration book as proved, then it is relevant to be
noted that during the course of an investigation or
inquiry, an accused is legally bound to produce the
relevant documents. If he does not produce any
document, same may result in an action against
him. When he produced certain documents before
the inquiry officer, then it cannot be said that he
had used a bogus document as genuine. The word |
“use” coined in section 471 PPC would mean a
voluntary and intentional act of using a forged
document as genuine coupled with the fact that the
person knows or has reason to believe that same
was a forged document. In the case in hand, the

Abdul Sabooh/* {S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
8

document has not been used as genuine by the
convict/petitioner and secondly no evidence had
ever been brought on record that he had the
knowledge or had reason to believe that the
document was forged and factitious. In such
situation, conviction of the accused under section

471 PPC was not justified.

12. In light of what has been discussed
above, the instant criminal revision is partially
allowed to the effect that the accused/petitioner is
acquitted of the charge under section 471 PPC by
extending him benefit of doubt. The vehicle i.e.
Suzuki Carry bearing registration No. BA-8231
Peshawar, chassis No. 843023 and _ engine
No. 726504 is not however found to be a genuine
vehicle as its chassis number had been tampered. |
Same is therefore ordered to be confiscated to the
State and to that extent, judgments of the two

Courts below are maintained.
