LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- Through this
judgment, we shall also decide Cr.A.No.
394-P of 2013 as both the appeals have
arisen out of common judgment
dated 16.07.2013 passed by the learned
Judge Anti-Terrorism Court-ll, Peshawar in
case FIR No.817 dated 10.09.2012
u/s 365-A PPC of Police Station Shaheed
Gulfat Hussain, Peshawar, whereby on
conviction, the appellants have been
sentenced to imprisonment for life with

benefit u/s 382-B Cr.P.C.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on
30.8.2012, Muhammad Ishfaque (PW-9)
reported to S.I. Naqeeb Shah (PW-2) in the
Police Station, regarding the missing of his

brother Riaz Ahmad (PW-10). In the report
(Ex.PW 2/1), it was alleged by the
complainant that he and his brother i.e., the
abudctee, went together for Maghrib prayer
in the nearby mosque when in the meantime
his brother received a call on his cell phone
No.0300-5907997, who responded that he
was offering prayer. After the prayer, both
came out of the mosque. The complainant
saw a 2D motorcar parked there alongside
the road, wherein, four persons including the
driver were sitting, who made his brother
seated in the car and then drove away.
According to the FIR, the complainant
could not know the purpose for which his
brother went with the aforesaid persons.
Likewise, he could not guess whether his
brother on his own went with the four
persons or was forced to go with them. He
entreated that his brother be traced out and
recovered. On the basis of ibid information,
enquiry u/s 156 (3) Cr.P.C was initiated. It
happened that on 25.10.2012, abductee
Riaz Ahmad appeared before the local
police and charged the appellants for his

abduction for ransom.

3. After completion of investigation, the

case was put in court, which indicted the
accused for the crime to which they pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial. In order to prove
its case, prosecution examined 13 witnesses
whereafter statements of the accused were
recorded, wherein, they professed their
innocence. The learned trial court, after
conclusion of the trial, found the accused
guilty of the charge and while recording their
conviction sentenced them as mentioned
above whereagainst they have preferred

their separate appeals.

4. Arguments heard and record gone
through.
5. Noticeable aspect of the case is that

the abductee was recovered on 06.10.2012
but neither he nor complainant of the case
reported to the local police about his release
from the captivity till 25.10.2012. Though the
prosecution has attempted to justify the
delay caused in charging the accused by
stating that after recovery the abductee went
to Punjab for his medical treatment but ibid
delay does not seem to be justifiable. True
that after recovery from captivity, an
abductee remains upset and _ mentally
disturbed for sometime but if the disturbance

continues up to 19 days, then such duration
will create reasonable doubt on subsequent
implication of the accused, therefore, the
delay caused in charging the accused at a
belated stage is fatal to the prosecution for
safe administration of justice. As the
prosecution has not given a_ plausible
explanation for the delay caused in
implicating the accused, therefore, no safe
reliance could be placed on the testimony of

the prosecution witnesses.

6. Of course, there is an identification
parade of the appellants by _ identifier
Muhammad Abbas (PW-11) but such
identification parade has no evidentiary
worth as same had taken place on
22.11.2012 and prior to holding the
identification parade, the appellants were
produced before the learned Judge
Anti-Terrorism Court-Il, Peshawar on
01.11.2012 and the possibility of their
showing to the identifier cannot be ruled out,
therefore, no importance could be attached
to the identification parade. Besides, the
identifier did not point out the specific role
played by the appellants in the crime. It is by
now well settled that in order to make an

identification parade reliable one, the
identifier must assign the specific role, which
the perpetrator has played in the crime. As
the identification parade is silent on the ibid
aspect and had taken place at a belated
stage of the appellants’ arrest, therefore, no
explicit reliance could be placed upon it for

the safe administration of justice.

7. The prosecution has also relied upon
the ransom amount recovered from the
appellants but this aspect of the case too is
of no help to it as PW-11 has not named any
specific accused to whom he had paid the
ransom. Moreso, one Malik Adeel, who had
produced Rs.2,00,000/- to the police being
ransom though Ex.PW 4/1, was not
produced by the prosecution before the
court and likewise the recovery of amount of
Rs.2,00,000/- on pointation of the appellant
Javed Akhtar on 31.10.2012, being ransom,
too is not believable as said amount was
statedly buried in ground by the appellant,
which fact does not appeal to mind as
now-a-days no person would ever bury

currency notes in ground.

8. Another pronounced aspect of the
case is that on same set of evidence, the

learned trial court has acquitted co-accused
Murad Khan _ etc, vide judgment
dated 28.11.2015, whereagainst neither the
complainant nor the State has filed any
appeal. Acquittal of the co-accused cannot
be ignored as the evidence against the
present appellants and the acquitted
accused is almost one and the same. As
there is no significant difference in the roles
of all the accused, therefore, acquittal of the
four co-accused vide judgment
dated 28.11.2015 and its non-challenging
has caused colossal damage to _ the

prosecution.

9. Thorough and careful examination of
the case record would show that the
prosecution has not proved its case against
the appellants beyond any reasonable doubt,
which is hallmark of criminal jurisdiction. It
has been held umpteenth times by the
superior courts that in order to convict an
accused for a crime, the prosecution has to
prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and
through trustworthy evidence and if a single
doubt accrues in the prosecution case
benefit of that will be given to the accused
being a century old principle of criminal law.

It appears to us that the learned trial court
has not appreciated the case evidence in its
true perspective and in line with the settled
principle of criminal law and has fallen in
error by convicting the appellants for which
the impugned judgment cannot be

countenanced.

13. For what has been discussed above,
this and the connected appeal are allowed,
conviction and sentence of the appellants
are set aside and they are acquitted of the

charges leveled against them.

14. Above are the reasons of our short
order of even date, which is reproduced as

under:-

“For the reasons to be recorded later, this
appeal is allowed, conviction and sentence
recorded by learned Judge Anti-Terrorism
Court-Il, Peshawar vide impugned judgment
dated 16.07.2013 is set aside. The appellant is
acquitted of the charge leveled against him and
he be set free forthwith, if not required in any

other case”.
