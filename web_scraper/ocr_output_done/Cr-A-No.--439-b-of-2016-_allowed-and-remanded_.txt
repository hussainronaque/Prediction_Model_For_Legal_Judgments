SR RR KK
SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.--- This criminal appeal has

been preferred against the judgment dated 28.10.2016
passed by the learned Sessions Judge-II, Bannu whereby
the appellant was convicted U/S. 3 of Illegal
Dispossession Act, 2005, and sentenced to six(6) months
SI with a fine of Rs.10,000/-(Ten thousand) and in
default thereof to undergo further one (01) month SI.

2. At the very out-set the learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the appellant contended that the
appellant has been convicted and sentenced without
recording his statement U/S. 342 Cr.P.C, therefore, the
conviction and sentence recorded by the learned trial

Court is illegal and not sustainable in the eyes of law.

*Imranullah* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad

3. When learned counsel for respondent was
confronted with the above contention of the learned
counsel for the appellant, he sought time for preparation.
He was given one day to rebut the contention of the
learned counsel for the appellant, but today when he
appeared before the Court he frankly conceded that the
appellant was convicted and sentenced without recording
his statement U/S. 342 Cr.P.C, which is mandatory
requirement under the law.

4. I have given my anxious consideration to
the point raised by the learned counsel for the appellant.
It may be appreciated that the examination of an accused
U/S. 342 Cr.P.C is based on principle involved in the
maxim "audi alteram partem" is that no one should be
condemned unheard, intended to offer him full
opportunity to explain all incriminating circumstances
appearing in evidence against him.

5. Section 342 Cr.P.C has two parts. The first
part gives a discretion to the Court whereas the second
part is mandatory. Under the Ist part, the Court may put
such questions to the accused which may be deemed
appropriate in arriving at just conclusion whereas under
the second part, examination of accused is must to point-

out salient points appearing in evidence against him and

*Imranullah* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad

to ask for an explanation. It will be advantageous to

reproduce Section. 342 Cr.P.C as under:-

"342. Power to examine _the
accused.--- (1) For the purpose of enabling
the accused to explain any circumstances
appearing in the evidence against him, the
Court may, at any stage of any inquiry or
trial without previously warning the
accused, put such questions to him as the
Court considers necessary, and shall, for
the purpose aforesaid, question him
generally on the case after the witnesses
for the prosecution have been examined

and before he is called on for his defence."

Affording such an opportunity is
mandatory and the accused has to be heard in detail to
enable him to explain his position and lead any evidence
in defence and also to record statement on Oath in
disproof of allegations leveled against him, if he opts to
do so.

6. It is now settled that where the accused is
not questioned at all, or his attention to an important
piece of evidence is not invited, the omission so made is
incurable illegality and fatal. In this behalf reliance can
be placed on the judgment reported as Ashraf Vs The
state (2004 P.Cr.L.J 42). In this contest reliance can also

be placed on the cases reported as (1) Munir Ahmad alias

*Imranullah* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad

Munni v. The State 2001 SCMR 56, (2) Asif Ali Zardari
and another v. The State PLD 2001 SC 568, (3) Rattan
Singh v. State of H.P. AIR 1997 SC 768, (4) Sharad
Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra AIR 1984 SC
1622 and (5) State of Maharasthra v. Sukhdeo Singh
1992 Cr.LJ 3454 (SC).

7. In the instant case trial court failed to record
statement of the accused and convicted him, thus,
committed an illegality whereby proceedings of the trial
court stood vitiated.

8. In view of the above, this appeal is allowed,
the conviction and sentence recorded by the learned trial
Court is set-aside and the case is remanded back to the
learned trial Court with the direction to record statement
of accused as required U/S. 342 Cr.P.C, while providing
an opportunity to the parties to lead further evidence, if
they opt to do so and thereafter re-write the judgment as
required under the law.
