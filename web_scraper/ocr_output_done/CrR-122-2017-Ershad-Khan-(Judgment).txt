QAISER RASHID KHAN, J:- This criminal revision is
directed against the order of the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-X, Peshawar dated 25.9.2017, whereby the application
of the petitioner for the examination of the accused/respondent
through Medical Board/radiologist for the accurate

determination of his age, has been dismissed.

2. Facts relevant to the present petition are that the

accused/respondent Bilal along with other co-accused stand

M. Ishaq Shah,SCS. Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
charged in case FIR No.775, dated 21.5.2016 under Sections
302/324/34 PPC of Police Station Chamkani, Peshawar. He
was sent for trial before the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-X, Peshawar and on 10.8.2017 when the case was fixed
for framing of the charge against the accused/respondent, he
presented his Matric DMC according to which his age was
below 18 years at the time of the commission of the offence
and the learned trial court, accepting the said DMC as an
authentic document, issued directions to the prosecution to
submit separate challan against the accused/respondent under
the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000. Feeling
aggrieved, the petitioner, being complainant of the case,
moved an application before the learned trial court requesting
for the age determination of the accused/respondent through
proper inquiry and medical board in the light of section 7 of
the Ordinance ibid. The learned trial court, after hearing
arguments of the learned counsel for the parties, dismissed the
application vide order dated 14.9.2017, hence the instant

criminal revision petition.

M. Ishaq Shah,SCS. Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
3. Arguments heard and the available record
perused.
4. Since the learned counsel for the petitioner banks

upon Section 7 of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance,
2001, therefore, the same is reproduced as under for ready
reference:-

“7.Determination of age.- If a question arises as to

whether a person before it is a child for the purposes

of this Ordinance, the Juvenile Court shall record a

finding after such inquiry which shall include a

medical report for determination of the age of the

child.”
After going through the recitals of the aforesaid section of law,
the question to be decided is that whether under section 7 of
the ibid law, it is obligatory on the trial court to have recourse
to the Medical Board for the determination of the age of an
accused in every case. Certainly, under this provision of law,
when there is no concrete proof or documentary evidence qua
the juvenility of an accused, the trial court can resort to such

exercise of sending the matter to the Medical Board, but in

M.Ishaq Shah,SCS. Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
the instant case, the accused/respondent, before the framing of
the charge, presented his DMC of SSC examination in
support of his claim of minority which the learned trial court
accepted as an authentic document. More so, the petitioner has
not challenged the validity or authenticity of the document
produced by the accused/respondent in the form of DMC of
SSC issued by the BISE, Peshawar , either before the learned
trial court in his application nor before this court through the
instant petition but has simply averred that the age of the
accused/respondent be determined through the Medical Board.
Otherwise too, when the said document has not been held by
the competent forum as fraudulent or bogus, its authenticity
cannot be brushed aside on the bald assertion of the petitioner.
As per his Matric DMC, at the time of the alleged commission
of the offence on 21.5.2016, the accused/petitioner was below
18 years of age, i.e. 17 years, 8 months and 11 days.

In view of the foregoing discussion, the learned
trial court has rightly dismissed the application of the
petitioner. I am fortified in my view by the dictum laid down
by the august Apex Court in the case reported as Muhammad

M. Ishaq Shah,SCS. Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
Ishaq Vs Muhammad Nadeem and another (2002 SC MR

— 440) and Intizar Hussain _vs Hamza Amir and others

(2017S CM R- 633).

5. Resultantly, this criminal revision petition, being
without any substance, stands dismissed along with Cr.Misc.

No.335-P/2017.
