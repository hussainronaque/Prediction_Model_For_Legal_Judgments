JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- Iqbal Shah son of

Sakhawat Shah, herein appellant, has preferred instant
appeal u/s 410, Cr.P.C. against the judgment of the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, Buner at Daggar
dated 29.07.2022 rendered in case FIR No. 276 dated
07.05.2021 u/s 302/34 PPC read with S. 15 A.A. of P.S
Daggar, whereby he was convicted and sentenced as

under:

i) u/s 302/34 PPC

Imprisonment for life with payment of
Rs.300,000/- to LRs of deceased as
compensation u/s 544-A, Cr.P.C. In case of
default, he was directed to suffer further six
months $5.1.

ti) u/s 15 A.A.

One-year simple imprisonment with fine of
Rs.10,000/-. In case of non-payment of fine, the
appellant was directed to undergo further one-
month S.I. Benefit of Section 382-B, Cr.P.C. was
extended to him and the sentences were ordered
to run concurrently.

2. Complainant Zeeshan Khan, who was
__ present in the company of his relative Imran with dead _

see DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan

body of his uncle Jamshed son of Faridoon on
07.05.2021 in casualty of DHQ Hospital Daggar
reported to police at 18.:25 hours that on the same day
he was present in front of his house while his uncle was
proceeding home when in the meanwhile Iqbal Shah
(appellant) and his co-accused Bakhtyar Shah (still
absconding) appeared from the fields duly armed with
weapons and started firing upon his uncle Jamshed as
result whereof he sustained serious injuries. He was
shifted to hospital but he could not survive and died in
his way to hospital. The occurrence was stated to have
been witnessed by complainant Zeeshan Khan (PW-8),
his uncle Junaid (PW-9} and relative Imran
(abandoned). The motive was disclosed as previous

blood feud with the accused.

3. Report of the complainant was recorded in
shape of Murasila on the basis of which the ibid FIR was
registered against the appellant and his other co-
accused. The appellant was arrested on 17.05.2021
whereas his co-accused Bakhtiar Shah remained
absconder. After completion of investigation, final
report against the appellant was put in Court. Upon
commencement of trial, formal charge was framed
against him to which he did not plead guilty and opted
to face the trial, therefore, prosecution produced and

examined 11 out of 17 PWs listed in the calendar of

Tejamual Khan ese 08: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
witnesses and closed the evidence. When examined
under section 342, Cr.P.C. the appellant once again
denied the charge, however, he neither opted to be
examined on oath in terms of Section 340(2), Cr.P.C.
nor he produced any witness in his defence. On
conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court vide
impugned judgment convicted and sentenced him in
the manner already discussed in the earlier portion of

this judgment, hence, instant appeal.

4. We have heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the parties including the learned Assistant
A.G. representing the State and perused the record with

their able assistance.

Ss. The learned trial Court, while convicting the
appellant, mainly considered the ocular account
tendered by complainant Zeeshan Khan (PW-8) and
Junaid (PW-9). The former is nephew of the deceased
while the latter is his son. Learned counsel for the
appellant have challenged the ocular account mainly on
the ground that the eye-witnesses have failed to
establish their presence on the spot whereas in rebuttal
learned counsel for the complainant and learned A.A.G.
contended that the occurrence took place near the
house of deceased, therefore, presence of PW-8 and PW-
9, being the natural eye-witnesses, cannot be doubted

in any manner. The ocular account, mainly relied upon

Tepimel Klean gs OB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
by learned trial Court for conviction of the appellant,
remained the chief focus of the cross debate. Since, both
the eye-witnesses are closely related to deceased,
therefore, the ocular account in the present case needs
to be reappraised and scanned carefully in light of the

law laid down in “Muhammad Zaman Vs. The State and
others” (2014 SCMR 749).

6. According to narrations of complainant in the
FIR, on the day of occurrence he was standing in front
of his house while his uncle Jamshed was walking
towards home when the appellant and absconding co-
accused appeared from the fields with firearms and
fired at Jamshed. Junaid (PW-9) and Imran (not
produced) were mentioned as eye-witnesses of the
occurrence. When appeared in the witness box as PW-
8, complainant dishonestly improved his above version
by narrating that he was present in front of his house;
his uncle (deceased) came out of his house to the fields
for checkup of the vegetables; his cousin Junaid was
going to Masjid for Asr prayer while he (complainant)
was going after him. That in the meanwhile the
appellant and his co-accused appeared from the wheat
crop and fired at his deceased uncle who was coming
back from the field to his house as result whereof he got
hit and moved onward for a few steps and fell on the

ground. It is evident from the above deposition in

Sapnrval Hanes DB: —_-Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
examination-in-chief that complainant has recorded a
self-contradictory statement by showing himself in two
different positions at one and the same time. While
lodging the report, he informed the police that at the
relevant time he was standing in front of his house but
did not provide any detail regarding the other eye-
witnesses namely Junaid and Imran (abandoned) that
what were they doing at that time rather he simply
mentioned their names as eye-witnesses of the
occurrence. The new story introduced by complainant
in his statement before the trial Court manifests his
dishonest intention to bring the story of FIR in
conformity with site plan and to justify the presence of
his cousin Junaid near the spot at the time when the
deceased had got bullet injuries on his person. No
doubt, FIR is not an encyclopedia to cover each and
every minute detail of the occurrence but the stuff
which pricks our mind is that what had precluded the
complainant to provide the detail about PW Junaid in
the FIR in the same manner which he had offered
regarding himself. Admittedly, only names of Junaid
and Imran were mentioned in the FIR as eye-witnesses
without disclosing the purpose for which they were
shown in surrounding of the spot, as such, the matter
was deliberately left open for the eye-witnesses to

explain and justify his presence at the place of

Teyjrmal Klean ese DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
occurrence in any manner of their choice. Had PW
Junaid witnessed the occurrence, the complainant
would have mentioned the purpose of his presence on
the spot. Introduction of the said purpose at
subsequent stage by complainant stating that Junaid
was going for offering Asr prayer, appears to be
deliberate and intentional. The defence counsel has
confronted both the eye-witnesses with their statement
u/s 161, Cr.P.C. for highlighting the dishonest
improvements made by them on their appearance in the
dock. As dishonest intention of both the ye-witnesses
behind their mendacious improvements can easily be
gathered from the record, therefore, they have lost their
credibility in view of the law laid down in “Akhtar Ali
and others Vs. The State” (2008 SCMR 6) that it is
settled law that improvements once found deliberate
and dishonest cast doubt on the veracity of such
witness. In another case titled “Muhammad Arif Vs.
The State” (2019 SCMR 631), the apex Court laid.
down that when a witness improved his statement
dishonestly to strengthen the prosecution case, such
portion of his statement was to be discarded and
testimony of such witness could not be safely relied
upon to maintain conviction and sentence of an

accused on a capital charge.

Saja mal Hib 08: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
7. It is settled principle of criminal
jurisprudence that an eye-witness, who claimed his
presence at the spot, must satisfy the mind of the Court
through some physical circumstances or through some
corroborative evidence in support of his presence at the
spot, which are missing in the present case qua the
eye-witnesses namely Zeeshan and Junaid. They
claim to have accompanied the dead body from spot
to hospital but their names as identifiers of the dead
body neither appear in the Inquest Report nor in the
postmortem report in view of which their presence on
the spot at the time of occurrence is doubtful.
Reliance is placed on “Ramzan alias Jani Vs. The
State” (1997 SCMR_590) wherein it has been held
that eye-witnesses not been mentioned in the FIR and
the inquest report, their presence at the scene of
occurrence was doubtful. Likewise in the case of
“Liaqat Ali and another Vs. The State and others”
(2021 SCMR 780), presence of the eye-witnesses on the
spot was viewed with great suspicion due to non-
mentioning of their names in the post-mortem report.
The eye-witnesses have also stated that while shifting
the deceased then injured from the ground to cot, their
clothes got smeared with blood of the deceased but in
the same breath they admitted that they had not

handed over their blood-stained clothes to 1.0. This

Tajrmut Khare DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
omission on the part of Investigating Officer suggests
that neither the eye-witnesses were present on the spot
at the time of occurrence nor their clothes were smeared
with blood of the deceased, therefore, the same were not

taken into possession by police. In a similar situation in
the case of “Mst. Sughra Begum and another Vs. The
State” (2015 SCMR 1142) the apex Court observed

that the omission strikes at the roots of the case of the
prosecution and bespeaks volumes about the dishonest
and false claim of the eye-witnesses. Similarly, FIR and
inquest report do not divulge the kind of weapon with
which the accused were allegedly armed at the time of
firing and it was simply noted that the accused were
armed with ‘firearms’. The learned trial Court has met
this objection of the defence by stating that no question
was put to complainant with regard to his knowledge
about the weapons. It is pertinent to note here that
being a part of the erstwhile PATA, the people of this
area are well familiar with all types of arms especially
light weapons usually kept by people in their houses for
their protection, therefore, it would be quite illogical to
presume that the complainant had no knowledge of
types of weapons therefore he did not mentioned it in
the FIR. Junaid (PW-9) was confronted with his
statement u/s 161, Cr.P.C. wherein he had narrated
regarding entry of complainant into his house and

Sajamul Khan gs DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan

making three fire shots with a repeater, as such, there
is no possibility that the types of weapons were not
mentioned by complainant for the sole reason that he
had no knowledge about weapons. Thus, non-
specification of the kind of weapons by complainant in
his report and likewise non-mentioning thereof by the
police in inquest report creates a reasonable doubt
suggesting that complainant was neither present at the
time of occurrence nor at the time of report otherwise
there was no reason for the complainant not to specify
the weapons the accused were carrying. Thus, it can
safely be inferred that complainant Zeeshan Khan was
not present at the time of report which was dishonestly
attributed to him. The version of complainant that he
was present in front of his house at the time of
occurrence is also not supported by site plan wherein
he has been shown on a throughfare at a distance of 35
feet from his house. Keeping in view the ocular account
in juxtaposition with different pieces of circumstantial
evidence discussed above, quite an abnormal and
unmatching picture of the episode is emerging casting
a serious doubt on presence of the eye-witnesses on the
spot at the time of occurrence besides there is no
physical circumstance in light of which the narrations
of the eye-witnesses could be believed. It is settled
principle of law that ocular evidence must, in order to

Tajamed. Karn or 0B: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-10-

carry conviction on a capital charge, must come from
an unimpeachable source; if such a source is not
available, then it must be supported by some strong
circumstance to enable the Court to overcome the
inherent doubt, which such evidence must necessarily

create. Reliance is placed on “Nadeem alias Kala Vs.
The State and others” (2018 SCMR 153).

8. It would not be out of place to mention that
the defence counsel confronted complainant with
abduction of daughter of one Kan Farosh by deceased
and thereafter her murder; likewise, questions were put
to him regarding the allegation of murder of Ahmad
Hussain against the deceased and allegations of
murders of Kan Farosh, Muhammad Khan, Khaliq Shah
and Ijaz against brothers of the deceased but
complainant stated that he has no knowledge in this
regard. Similar denial also appears in the statement of
the other eye-witness Junaid (PW-9). Copies of previous
FIRs are available on record and it has also been
brought on record during cross-examination of the PWs
that brothers of the deceased are absconders in a case
of murders of four persons. The eye-witnesses were
supposed to know the well-known facts and events with
which they were confronted during their cross-
examination, therefore, the suppression of the said

facts by them shows their dishonest intention, as such,

Tajamal Khan co DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
-ll-

testimony of such unreliable and dishonest witnesses
cannot be relied upon for conviction of an accused on a
capital charge. While facing a similar situation in the
case titled “Ata Muhammad _and another Vs. The

State” (1995 SCMR 599) the Hon’ble Supreme Court

ruled down that:

The eye witnesses appear to be basically
dishonest as they gave evidence with a motive
other than of telling the truth, in that, they
even suppressed the facts which they were
supposed to know in the ordinary course of
events, e.g., when asked in
cross-examination, whether Atta Muhammad
got case under section 336/440, P.P.C.
registered against them at Police Station Midh
on 10-8-1988 vide F.ILR. No. 183, Bati P.W.
replied "I do not know".

9. The record shows that, per version of the
complainant, PW Imran had also witnessed the
occurrence in the backdrop of which his name was also
mentioned in the Inquest Report and postmortem report
as identifier of the dead body even he was shown to have
verified Murasila. It means that he was an important
witness of prosecution, as such, a witness whose
testimony could have been independent was abandoned
by the prosecution. Although he was a relative of the
deceased but the option of prosecution not to examine
him during the trial creates a doubt that he was
abandoned presumably with some sinister motive. In

this regard we would refer the case of “Muhammad

Saga nud Khan gs o8: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
-12-

Rafique and others Vs. The State and others” (2010
SCMR 385).

10. It is the version of prosecution that two
accused had fired upon the deceased as result of which
he sustained firearm injuries on his body. According to
record, the I.O has alleged recovery of 03 empties of 30
bore pistol and same number of crime empties of M16.
The dead body was examined by Dr. Muhammad Ali
(PW-7) on 07.05.2021 at 06:00 P.M. He reported the
following wounds on the body of deceased as per

Postmortem report Ex.PW-7/4.

(1) Entry wound on wmid-scapular line
backside 1 to 1 % cm in length.

(2) Entry wound near spine on left side 1 to
1 % cm in length.

(3) Entry wound on right side near the spine
1 to 1 %cmin length

(4) Entry wound on right side on dorsum of
hand 1 to 2 cm in length. Exit wound at
opposite side at palmar side at thenar
muscle 2 to 2 % cm in length.

(5) | Exit wound above the fourth intercostal
space and mid clavicular line 2 to 3 cm in
length on right side.

(6) Exit wound on right side near the sternum
lateral side 1 to 2 cm in length.

(7) Exit wound on right side lower rib above
the liver right portion 1 to 1 % cm in
length.

Close perusal of the above detail of wounds
found on the dead body reveals that dimension of the
entry wounds at serial No. (1) to (3) is one and the same
i.e. 1 to 1% cm which slightly varies from entry wound

No. (4) with the dimension of 1 to 2 cm. The mentioned

Tejanad Hhancs pa: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
. Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-13-

difference of half centimeter of the last entry wound
from the remaining three wounds was apparently due
to the difference in the locale of injuries. Thus, the
medical evidence suggests use of one weapon in the
occurrence which goes against the basic version of
prosecution that the murder had been committed by
two accused including the present appellant. It appears
from the afore-stated situation that the charge was
exaggerated by complainant by implicating two
members of the accused family. Thus, medical evidence
is not in line with ocular account and the benefit of
doubt arising out of the said conflict is to be given to
accused. Reliance is placed on “Najaf Ali Shah Vs. The

State” (2021 SCMR 736). It was observed by Hon’ble

apex Court in the said judgment that:

“Once a single loophole is observed in a case
presented by the prosecution, such as conflict
in the ocular account and medical evidence or
presence of eye-witnesses being doubtful, the
benefit of such loophole/lacuna in the
prosecution's case automatically goes in
favour of an accused”.

11. Adverting to recovery of the crime weapon on
pointation of the appellant, the Investigating Officer has
alleged that the appellant during the course of
investigation took him and other police party to a
retaining wall (<5) situated in the area of Naway Kalay
and recovered a pistol with fix charger containing three

empties which had been concealed by him in stones. The

Tajamal Khan gs DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-14-

1.0 took the pistol in possession through recovery memo
and prepared a _ sketch which shows a
thoroughfare/unmetalled road adjacent to the wall from
which the recovery was affected. The said place was thus
accessible by everyone, therefore, plantation of the pistol
against the appellant cannot be ruled out in the
mentioned circumstances. The record further shows that
the pistol was sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory
along with the crime empties but the report in this regard
shows the non-matching result creating a doubt of
serious nature qua the authenticity of the prosecution
case against the appellant. Guidance is taken from
“Sardar _Bibi_and_others Vs. Munir Ahmad and
others” (2017 SCMR 344) wherein the apex Court held
that when in the FIR no specific weapon was shown in
the hands of the accused; no crime empty was recovered
from the place of occurrence; and no positive report of
Forensic Science Laboratory was available regarding
matching of any crime empty with the allegedly recovered
weapon, then the recovery of weapon from accused was
inconsequential and could not be _ considered
corroborative piece of evidence. Almost same is the
doubtful position of the recovery of crime weapon in the
present case, therefore, the said recovery is of no help to

prosecution.

12. As per contents of the FIR, the motive behind
the occurrence in the present case has been set up as
previous blood-feud. Although the J.0 has placed on
record certain previous FIRs but the same do not
specifically divulge enmity of the appellant with
deceased Jamshed or his family except an FIR brought
on the record as Ex.PW-8/D-1 registered on the report
of one Feroz Shah against brothers of the deceased
Jamshed wherein the present appellant has been
shown as one of the eye-witnesses of the occurrence.
After going through the record in light of arguments
advanced by both the sides, the motive so set up by
complainant has not been proved through any solid
material as in this regard the complainant has not
moved ahead beyond the bald assertions. Even
otherwise, it is settled principle of law that motive is a
double-edged weapon which cuts both sides in the like
manner, therefore, false implication of the appellant by
complainant because of the motive so set up and his
status of being an eye-witness against his uncles
cannot be ruled out. Reliance is placed on “The “State
VS. Muhammad Sharif _and_others” (1995 SCMR

635) wherein it was held that:

So far as enmity is concerned, it is a
double-edged weapon and cuts both ways. If it
is considered as sufficient motive for
commission of offence, it can also be
considered as sufficient for false implication
as well,

Tejamal Khan oe: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-16-

13. Viewed and judged from all aspects, there are
glaring inconsistencies in the prosecution which are
sufficient to create serious doubts in prudent mind qua
involvement of the appellant in commission of the
offence. It is settled principle of law that benefit of even
a single but reasonable doubt should be extended to
accused and it is not necessary that for giving him
benefit of doubt, there should be many circumstances

creating doubts. In the case of “Ayub Masih Vs. The

State” (PLD 2002 S.C 1048), this principle was

elaborately discussed by apex Court by holding that:

The rule of benefit of doubt, which is described
as the golden rule, is essentially a ‘rule of
prudence’ which cannot be ignored while
dispensing justice in accordance with law. It is
based on the maxim, "it is better that ten guilty
persons be acquitted rather than one innocent
person be convicted". In simple words it means
that utmost care should be taken by the Court in
convicting an accused. It was held in The State
v. Mushtaq Ahmed (PLD 1973 SC 418) that this
rule is antithesis of haphazard approach or
reaching a fitful decision in a case. It will not be
out of place to mention here that this rule
occupies a pivotal place in the Islamic law and is
enforced rigorously in view of the saying of the
Holy Prophet (p.b.u.h) that the "mistake of Qazi
(Judge) in releasing a criminal is better than his
mistake in punishing an innocent."

14, Thus, in light of the above discussion, instant
appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment is set aside
and appellant Iqbal Shah is acquitted of the charge

levelled against him by complainant in the present case.
