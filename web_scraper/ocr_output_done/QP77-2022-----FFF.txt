ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- This petition, under
section 561-A Cr PC, calls for the evaluation of an order
of Learned Additional Session Judge XVI/JSC Peshawar
that discarded the defense objection on allowing the
prosecution witness to refresh memory from the police
record.

2. In the petitioner's trial for the offense under section
11 CNSA/ 9D CNSA (F.LR No 1223 dated 1.8.2021 P.S
Hayatabad, Peshawar), the trial court examined Ibad
Wazir, the prosecution witness. Ibad Wazir is witness to
the recovery of contraband. He testified to the alleged
incident of 1.8.2021, the recovery of ICE weighing 5

grams from the personal search of accused Inamullah, six
packets of heroin weighing 3750 grams, and ICE
weighing 06 Kg from the secret cavities of the car in
which the accused traveled. He also testified to the
separation of samples and the seal of the case property.
He finally affirmed the correctness of the recovery
memorandum Exhibit PW 4/1. At this juncture, the
defense objected that without a formal request for
refreshing memory, the witness had perused his
statement on the file. The prosecutor resisted the
objection claiming the rights of the witness under Article
155 of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order 1984. The trial
court decided that the witness has the right to refresh
memory under Article 155 of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat
Order 1984 and that he may peruse his statement and the
record he had endorsed.

3. In the first question in cross-examination, the
defense asked the witness about answering from the
police file. The witness admitted that he had perused his
police statement and the contents of the recovery

memorandum during examination-in-chief. To another
question that shortly followed, the witness answered he
was reading the police file during cross-examination.

4. After a few questions in cross-examination, the
defense objected again that the witness could not refresh
his memory without a formal request and that the police
file is before the witness when he is in the witness box.
The trial court overruled the objection and ordered that
the witness already had permission to refresh memory
under Article 155 of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order 1984.
5. The petitioner counsel submits that the trial judge
erred in allowing the witness to refresh his memory
without a formal request from him or the prosecution. He
contends that the method adopted in allowing the witness
to have the whole police file before him while giving
testimony cannot conceivably be called "refreshing
memory. He urges that such practice, if permitted, would
bring the exercise of cross-examination at naught, and
would seriously prejudice defense rights, thus a flagrant
violation of the right of a fair trial.

6. Arguments heard. Record perused.
7. The petition raises questions of significant legal
import on the use of police files, the use and evidentiary
value of statements under section 161 CrPC in evidence,
and the scope, and method of refreshing the memory of
the witnesses.

8. As a general rule, witnesses forget, and the use of
aids to stimulate or jog the memory is permitted. The trial
judge has discretion in allowing witnesses to refresh their
memories, albeit circumscribed by the applicable law. It
would be necessary, therefore, to put the law in context.
The discussion shall proceed on all the documents that
may have relevance to investigation.

9. Section 172 Criminal Procedure Code deals with
police diaries. The section mentions that the investigation
officer shall enter into it the day-to-day record of his

investigation. It further mentions:

1. Court may send for the diaries;

2. Court may use such diaries, not as evidence
in the case but to aid in the inquiry or trial;

3. The accused is neither entitled to use such
diaries nor entitled to see them;

4. The provisions of section 161 or section 145

of the Evidence Act, of 1872 (now Articles
157 and 140 of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat
Order 1984) shall apply if the police officer
who made them refreshes his memory or the
court uses the diary to contradict such

officer.

10. It follows, from above, the police diary is
essentially a confidential record that the accused cannot
see or use as evidence. However, the accused is entitled
to use it when the court questions the witness about that
diary or the police officer refreshes his memory.
Furthermore that only the police officer who made the
diary can use it to refresh his memory.

11. The earliest authority on the point, Allahabad High
Court decision in Queen-Empress vs Mannu on 13 July
1897! dealt with this aspect and held:

"There is no provision in Section 172 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure enabling any
person other than the Police officer who
made the special diary to refresh his
memory by looking at the special diary, and
the necessary implication is that a special
diary cannot be used to enable any witness
other than the Police officer who made the
special diary to refresh his memory by
looking at it. This is in truth a general
principle of law. The Criminal Court, but

not an accused person or his agent, unless

Code of Criminal Procedure consistent with
the rules of construction and a knowledge of
the English language is possible by which
the special diary is to be used to contradict
any person except the Police officer who
made it. It is not enacted in Section 172 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure by
reference to Section 145 of the Indian
Evidence Act, 1872, or otherwise that if the
special diary is used by the Court to
contradict the Police officer who made it, it
may thereupon or thereafter be used to

contradict any other witness in the case.”

As for the statements recorded under section 161

CrPC, their only use is for contradiction. Section 162

CrPC explicitly provides it. That is not to say, however,

that the recovery memo also comes within the prohibition

of section 162 CrPC. The distinction was admirably

made clear in “Vishnu Krishna Belurkar V The State Of

Maharashtra on 18 February 1974(1974) 76 BOMLR

627”

"Now if these are the purposes for which such
panch namas are made, the question that arises for
consideration is whether the fact that such record
is scribed by the police officer investigating the
offence or by a constable working under him
during the course of such investigation converts
such record into statements made by the panch to
the police officer within the meaning of Section
13.

162,Criminal Procedure Code, for, unless such
record amounts to statements made to a police
officer within the meaning of that section it would
not fall within the ban contained therein. It was not
disputed before us that Section 157 of the Evidence
Act is controlled by the special provisions of
Section 162, Criminal Procedure Code, and
therefore, if the statements, though falling under
Section157 of the Evidence Act, were also to fall
under Section 162, Criminal Procedure Code such
statements would become inadmissible and could
be made use of only for the purpose mentioned in
the proviso to Section 162, that is to say, for
contradicting the witness after following the
procedure indicated in Section 145 of the Evidence
Act.....In our view, having regard to the primary
and essential purpose for which _ these
panchanamas are made during the course of
investigation of an offence, it is not possible to
come to the conclusion that there is an element of
communication, that is to say, there is an intention
to communicate to the police officer the subject-
matter of the things seen and heard by the panchas
which are recorded in these documents.......... In
our view, there is a clear distinction between a
narration made to the police officer with a view to
communicate or impart knowledge of the subject-
matter of such narration to the police officer and a
mere record of what the panchas have seen and
heard which is intended to serve as aid memoir to

the panchas when they give evidence at the trial”.

The last and most significant question involves the

correct application and procedure of refreshing memory.

Article 155 Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order 1984 relates to the

present recollection revived, and Article 156 Qanoon-e-

Shahadat Order 1984 to the past recollection recorded.
14.

The Court of Appeal Manitoba (Province of

Canada) in R v. Wilks, 2005 MBCA 99 (CanLII) drew

the distinction as:

15.

"Witnesses often forget, and so it is permissible to
use aids to assist the witness. The use of these aids
will fall into one of two categories. They will either
i) assist the witness by reviving his or her memory
so that the witness, whose memory has been
jogged by the aid, now has a present memory of
the fact (“present memory revived”), or ti) be a
record of the fact, previously made and now
attested to as an accurate record (“past

recollection recorded”)"

"In the case of present memory revived, the aid is
not evidence, but is simply a __ facilitative
mechanism _which_becomes_irrelevant_once_the
witness _has_had_his_or_her_present_memory
revived by the use of the aid, In the case of past
recollection _recorded, there _is__no__ present

memory, so it is the evidence of the past

recollection, recorded usually in the form of notes

or the like, that is admitted".

The precondition for admissibility of the past

recollection recorded from Article 156 of QSO is that the

witness is sure that the facts were correctly recorded in
10
the document that is used to refresh memory. The Wilks’
case refers here to Wigmore criteria:

1. The past recollection, must have been
recorded in some reliable way.

2. At the time, it must have been sufficiently
fresh and vivid to be probably accurate.

3. The witness must be able now to assert that
the record accurately represented his
knowledge and recollection at the time. The
usual phrase requires the witness to affirm
that he “knew it to be true at the time”.

4. The original record itself must be used if it
is procurable."

From the Wilks® case preconditions for the admissibility

of present memory revived are as follows:

"Although no precise formula need be followed,
the substance of what is dealt with in the following
extract from Thomas A. Mauet, Donald G.
Casswell & Gordon P. Macdonald, Fundamentals of
Trial Technique, 2nd Canadian ed. (Boston: Little
Brown and Co., 1984), must be discernible from
the evidence (at pp. 102-3):

A certain litany must be followed to establish the

foundation for refreshing recollection...

The following elements must be demonstrated to

establish a foundation for refreshing the

recollection of a witness who is on the witness

stand:

1. Witness knows the facts, but has a memory
lapse on the stand.

2. Witness knows his report or other writing
will refresh his memory.

3. Witness is given and reads the pertinent part
of his report or other writing.

4. Witness states his memory has now been
refreshed.

5. Witness now testifies what he knows,
without further _aid_ of the report_or
other writing.”

It is on the aforesaid standard that the judges discarded
the evidence in the Wilks* Case:

"But the problem in the case was that what went
into evidence went well beyond the officer’s
current recollection. For example, “[t/he account
of the murder was put into evidence word for word

from the excluded ... transcript” (at para. 55).

This, said Binnie J., should not have been permitted (at

paras. 60-61):

The officer was quite entitled to attempt to
“refresh” his memory by an out-of-court review of
the corrected transcript, but in the witness box his
testimony had to be sourced in his “refreshed”

memory, not the excluded transcript.

“ https://www.canlii.org/en/m b/mbca/doc/2005/2005mbca99/2005mbca99.htmt
12

In short, the problem with the corrected
transcript as a stimulus to memory is not that it
was itself inadmissible but that it failed to

stimulate".
16. Applying the law to the facts, it is an inescapable
conclusion that the trial court did not follow the legally
acceptable procedure of permitting a witness to refresh
memory. It is clear that before reading the record, the
witness did not mention his memory lapse or that he
needed a document to jog his memory as a prerequisite
for invoking Article 155 QSO. There was no request
from the prosecutor or the witness to lay the foundation
for memory recall. He was an eyewitness to the recovery
supposed to depose in the witness box from his memory,
not from police or judicial file, authored by someone
else. If this practice is not streamlined it would definitely
have effect on the dispensation of criminal justice. Again,
and more importantly, the trial court permitted the
witness to record evidence while the police file was
before him. Instead of using the record to stimulate

witness memory, if at all it was exhausted, the trial Court
13

allowed him to have a full view of the file, regardless of
the nature of the documents. The witness, as it appears,
regurgitated from the record, unbridled to read when and
where wanted.

There is no gainsaying that allowing the probative value
of the recorded statement to prevail would be prejudicial
to the rights of the accused and an infringement of a fair
trial.

For the foregoing, I would allow the petition, set
aside orders of the trial court dated 8.9.2022, and direct
that the trial court shall record the evidence of PW-Ibad
Wazir again in accordance with the guidelines given in
this judgment. Consequently, the statement of PW Ibad
earlier recorded in the case shall be considered
inadmissible and of no legal effect.

Copy of this judgment be placed before Hon’ble
the Chief Justice for his kind perusal and the approval for
circulating copies of this judgment to all the Judicial

Officers in the Province for their guidance.
