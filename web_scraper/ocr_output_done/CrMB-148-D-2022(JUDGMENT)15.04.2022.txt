MUHAMMAD FAHEEM WALT, J.- Being booked in
case FIR No.02/2021 dated 13.3.2021, under Section
9(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substance Act, 1997,
registered at police station ANF, D.I.Khan, the petitioner
seeks post arrest bail, on statutory ground of delay in
conclusion of trial.
2. Brief facts of the case as narrated in the
FIR, registered on the basis of murasila, in brief, are that
on 13.3.2021, complainant Nasrullah Khan Inspector
received information from his high-ups that notorious
narcotic peddler Javed Khan son of Aman Ullah Khan,
resident of Lakki Marwat would smuggle and hand over
huge quantity of narcotics to his customer, upon which
the complainant alongwith other police Nafri rushed to

the spot in an official vehicle where the petitioner was
-

-2-

apprehended with a shopper containing seven packets of
Charas, each weighing 1000 gram, total 7000 gram
Charas was recovered from the accused, 10/10 gram
Charas were separated from the recovered contraband
for chemical analysis and were sealed in parcels No.1 to
7, whereas the remaining Charas was sealed in parcel
No.8. The seizing officer drafted the murasila and sent
the same to the police station where the captioned FIR
was registered against the accused/petitioner.
3. Arguments heard and record gone through.
4. Since the petitioner has sought bail on
statutory ground of delay in conclusion of his trial,
therefore, before proceeding further, it would be
convenient to reproduce Section 497(1)(3)(a), Cr.P.C.
which is as under:-

(a) Who, being accused of an offence

punishable with death, has been detained

for such offence for a continuous period

exceeding one year or in case of a woman

exceeding six months and whose trial for

such offence has not concluded.”

Part (a) of third proviso to section 497(1),

Cr.P.C. envisages that in an offence not punishable

with death, the trial of the accused is to be concluded

‘within a period of one year from the date of his/her

detention, and in case the trial was not so concluded,
the law mandates the release of the accused on bail. In
this view of the matter, the accused has a statutory

right to be released on bail if his trial for such offence
-3-

was not concluded within a period of one year from
the date of his detention and such period begins from
the date of the arrest/detention of the accused and it is
of little importance as to when the charge was framed
and the trial commenced. The purpose and objective of
the provision is to ensure that the trial of an accused is
conducted expeditiously and the pre-conviction
detention of an accused does not extend beyond the
period of one year, in cases involving offences not
punishable with death. In such cases, if the trial of an
accused was not concluded within a year of his
detention, the statutory right to be released on bail
ripened in his favour. This statutory right to be
released on bail is, however, subject to two
exceptions: one is embodied in the third proviso itself
and the second is provided in the fourth proviso to
section 497, Cr.P.C. As per these exceptions, the right
to be released on bail on the ground of delay in
conclusion of the trial is not available to an accused ift
(i) the delay in conclusion of the trial is occasioned by
an act or omission of the accused or by any other
person acting on his behalf, or (ii) the accused is a
convicted offender for an offence punishable with
death or imprisonment for life or is, in the opinion of

the Court, a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal
-4-

or is accused of an act of terrorism punishable with
death or imprisonment for life.

The second exception to the right of the
accused to be released on bail on the ground of delay
in conclusion of the trial is provided in the fourth
proviso to section 497, Cr.P.C. According to which the
provisions of the third proviso do not apply to the
accused who is: (i) a convicted offender for an offence
punishable with death or imprisonment for life; or (il)
a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal, in the
opinion of the Court; or (iii) an accused of an act of
terrorism punishable with death or imprisonment for
life.

5. Another important aspect that require
elucidation rcgarding the peculiar facts and
circumstances of the case is the provisions of the
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, where in proviso
to Section 9(c) of the Narcotic Substances Act
provides that if quantity of narcotics recovered
exceeds 10 K.Gs. then the punishment shall not be less
than imprisonment for life. By necessary application it
will conversely suggest that if the quantity of
recovered narcotic is Iess than 10 K.Gs., then the
mandatory punishment of imprisonment for life so
provided in the proviso would not be applicable.

Keeping the above narration in mind and_ being
-5-

mindful of the facts of the instant case, allegedly, 7
K.Gs. of Charas have been recovered from the
accuscd, hence, his casc would come under Part (a) of
the 3% proviso of Section 497(1), Cr.P.C., as the
mandatory punishment of death and imprisonment for
life pertains to only those cases where the quantity
recovered exceeds 10 K.Gs. For this reason, the
accused herein can claim benefit to be released on
statutory ground under section 497(1)(a) of 3% proviso
that provides entitlement to be released on bail after
continuous detention exceeding one year, if delay in
conclusion of the trial could not be attributed to him or
any person acting on his behalf.

6. It appears from the record available on file
that the petitioner was arrested on 13.3.2021, complete
challan was prepared on 16.4.2021, which was
submitted before learned trial Court on 12.7.2021,
provision of section 265-C, Cr.P.C. was complied with
on 30.8.2021, whereas charge was framed on 07.9.2021.
On 13.9.2021, PWs were absent, therefore, NBWA was
directed to be issued against them for 17.9.2021, on
which date it was Note Reader and case was adjourned
to 25.9.2021. On 25.9.2021, there was strike of the
lawyers community and case was adjourned to
02.10.2021. On 02.10.2021, PWs Razaf Akhtar and

Taimur ul Hassan were present but they requested for
Za

-6-

adjournment to prepare the case and on their request
case was adjourned to 08.10.2021, on which date PWs
were absent, therefore, NBWA was ordered to be issued
and salaries of the PWs were attached. On 16.10.2021
and 23.10.2021, the Presiding Officer was on leave. On
28.10.2021 PWs Razaf Akhtar and Taimur ul Hassan
were present but were sent unexamined as the learned
defence counsel was busy in trial of another case, hence,
case was adjourned to 30.10.2021. On 30.10.2021, the
lawyers community was on strike. The above order
sheets and the remaining order sheets till 12.3.2022 of
the trial Court would indicate that the delay in
conclusion of trial was caused on the part of prosecution.
Even otherwise, the period of detention exceeds one
year, while there is nothing on the record that accused is;
(i) a convicted offender for an offence punishable with
death or imprisonment for life; or (ii) a hardened,
desperate or dangerous criminal, in the opinion of the
Court; or (iii) an accused of an act of terrorism
punishable with death or imprisonment for life. In this
view of the matter, the accused/pctitioner is entitled to
the concession of bail. Guidance is sought from the
casc law reported as “Shakeel Shah Vs. The State and
others” (2022 SCMR 1).

7. For what has been stated above, this

petition is allowed and the accused/petitioner is directed
-7-

to be released on bail subject to furnishing bail bond in
the sum of Rs:100,000/- (one lac) with two sureties, each
in the like amount, to the satisfaction of learned
Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate.

8. Above are the reasons of my short order of
even date announced on 15.4.2022, which is reproduced
herein below:-

“For reasons to be recorded later, this
petition for post arrest bail is allowed and
accused/petitioner Javed Khan son of
Aman Ullah Khan is admitted to bail
subject to furnishing bail bonds in the
sum of Rs:100,000/- with two sureties,
each in the like amount, to the satisfaction
of learned _—‘aqa/Duty Judicial
Magistrate”.
