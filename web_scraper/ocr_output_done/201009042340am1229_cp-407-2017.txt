Criminal Petition No. 407 of 2017 2

Criminal Petition No. 407 of 2017

3. After hearing the learned counsel for the petitioner and going
through the record of the case appended with this petition we have
found ourselves in agreement with the High Court that the claimed
presence of the eyewitnesses produced by the prosecution was
highly doubtful. The petitioner/complainant was not an eyewitness
of the occurrence and he had claimed to have been informed about
the occurrence by his son namely Abdullah (PW6). Abdullah (PW6)
had, however, failed to mention before the trial court that his
father had been informed by him about the occurrence. No record
of any telephonic conversation between Pw6 and_ the
petitioner/ complainant had been brought on the record. PW6 did
not report the matter to the police upon arrival of the police at the
spot. The other eyewitness produced by the prosecution, i.e.
Usman Ali (PW5) was not even mentioned in the FIR in any
capacity whatsoever and he had made his first statement before
the police under section 161, Cr.P.C. after eight days of the alleged
occurrence. The said beleaguered. ocular account furnished by the
prosecution had failed to receive any independent corroboration
and the pieces of evidence produced by the prosecution as
corroboration had been discarded by the High Curt after recording
cogent reasons in that regard. In these circumstances no occasion
has been found by us for interference with the impugned judgment
of acquittal passed by the High Court. This petition is, therefore,

dismissed and leave to appeal is refused.
