awoke up and came out of the room; they saw two persons,

the tablets in the tea to Ameera Bibi and Munir Ahmad and
then got committed their murder through Allah Ditta and
Muhammad Ashraf alias Anwar Sayyal (appellants) because
she wanted to marry with Anwar Sayyal; after a short while,
getting the chance, Ramzana Bibi had escaped from there.

by the witnesses.

6. On conclusion of investigation report under Section
173 Cr.P.C (Challan) was submitted in court.

7. A charge under Sections 302/337-J/34 PPC was
framed against appellants on 25.11.2016 for which they
pleaded not guilty and demanded their trial.

8. In support its case prosecution had produced Farzand
Ali HC/Moharrar® the author of FIR (Pw-1), Muhammad
Amin Abid SI (Pw-2), Muhammad Akmal Constable (Pw-3),
Muhammad Aslam HC (Pw-4), Muhammad Javed Iqbal SI
(Pw-5), Dr. Muhammad Amin (Pw-6), Raja Usman Yousaf

Dr. Shawana Ambreen (Pw-9), Mr. Muhammad Imran Tariq
Magistrate (Pw-10), Inayat Ali/complainant (Pw-11),
Muhammad Ashraf/eye witness (Pw-12), Bagh Ali (Pw-13)
and Muhammad Afzal Inspector/Investigating officer
(Pw-14).

9. Amjad Ali and Muhammad Iqbal were given up being
unnecessary by the learned DDPP”? who after producing the
expert reports (PAA to PAE) had closed the prosecutions’
evidence.

10. Initially all the appellants were examined under
Section 342 Cr.P.C on 12.07.2017 but as thereafter more
evidence was produced, so they were again examined by the

learned trial court on 08.11.2017.

11. All the appellants denied incriminating evidences put
to them and their versions were as under: -

Muhammad Ashraf alias Anwar Sayyal
“All the PWs are related inter se. I am a

landless poor married man having three kids
and a wife and old ailing father living at
Singhpura Pakpattan. I was arrested by the

° Diarist of Police Station
' Deputy District Public Prosecutor

police on the second day of this occurrence
along with some three persons but they were
let off after receiving some consideration.
My pelvic bone of my left leg has been
broken and I cannot run and climb over the
wall as alleged by the prosecution. It was a
blind murder and so many people were
formally taken into custody and I was made
a scapegoat as I was a helpless man”

Allah Ditta

“As I have stated while replying question
No.10, this false and fabricated case was
registered against me by the complainant
and PWs when I refused to join them as a
PW, they have roped me in this case. I have
neither any enmity, motive and ill will
against the deceased nor I had any
association or relationship with my co-
accused Muhammad Ashraf alias Anwar
Sayyal. Other employees who were present
in Control Shed at the time of occurrence
did not support the version of the
complainant and no independent witness of
the vicinity verified the prosecution story.
The complainant and PWs are related inter
se and they have deposed falsely against
me”

Mst. Ramzana Bibi

“The PWs and complainant are related inter
se and are inimical towards me. I and
deceased Munir Ahmad had a love marriage
against the wishes of complainant and the
PWs who are close relative of Munir Ahmad
deceased at Lodhran. Due to _ their
annoyance I and Munir Ahmad shifted to
Machiwal and started living there and I was
living peaceful life with Munir Ahmad and
his mother and three kids were born out of
that wedlock. On the day of occurrence I
was not present at Machiwal at my
residence. A day prior to the occurrence I
and my kids had gone to Lodhran to see my
old ailing mother and I was there when I
learnt about this sad incident. From there I
rushed to P.S Machiwal along with my kids
where police detained me at police station
Machiwal and my kids were handed over to
complainant party. Few months prior to the
occurrence my husband Munir Ahmad
disposed of his house situated at Lodhran
for consideration of more than Rs.470000/.
Murder Reference No. 17 of 2018 6
Criminal Appeal No.117-J and 96-J of 2018
Criminal Revision No.84 of 2018

The complainant party involved me in this
case and took away more than Rs.470000/-
and my other ornaments and they involved
me in this case to grab the money and
property of my husband and to take kids
from me due to grudge of my love marriage
with Munir Ahmad deceased. They were not
on visiting terms with us and they never
came to Machiwal in life time of Munir
Ahmad deceased”

12. All the appellants did not opt to appear in terms of
Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. Ramzana Bibi also did not desire to
produce defence evidence, however, male appellants
consented to do so and for that they brought on record
certain documents (DA to DG).

13. All learned counsel for appellants jointly contended
that this is the fundamental duty of prosecution to prove its’
case beyond reasonable doubt and in failure to do so accused
deserves for acquittal as a matter of right; to discharge its’
duty prosecution cannot take any benefit from weakness of
defence; murder of two persons will not be a sole
consideration to send the culprits behind the gallows because
under all circumstances prosecution cannot escape from its’
liability to stand on its own legs; Inayat Ali (Pw-11) and
Muhammad Ashraf (Pw-12) both are the chance witnesses as
they could not furnish any explanation for their presence at
crime scene; so-called extra judicial confession of Ramzana
Bibi does not appeal to mind which even otherwise is not
supported from circumstances; how was it possible for
Ramzana Bibi to escape in presence of many persons present
at crime scene; no source of light was introduced by the
witnesses so the question of looking the faces of Muhammad
Ashraf and Allah Ditta does not arise; features of any of the
male appellants have not been provided therefore,
identification parade is of no worth; if the statement/extra
judicial confession of Ramzana Bibi (appellant) does not

remain in field, entire prosecutions’ evidence including
Murder Reference No. 17 of 2018 7
Criminal Appeal No.117-J and 96-J of 2018
Criminal Revision No.84 of 2018

identification parade proceedings shall fall on the ground;
reports of PFSA showing the matching of pistol of
Muhammad Ashraf (appellant) with empties recovered from
crime scene and DNA of buckle swabs shall also lose their
credibility if other pieces of evidence are disbelieved
because these reports at the most are corroborative and not
conclusive in nature. All learned counsel has ultimately
demanded the acquittal for their clients.

14. On the other hand, both learned counsel for
complainant and learned APG" jointly argued that both the
eye witnesses categorically maintained that they had come to
place of occurrence to see their sister and once they gave
logical reason they were no more chance witnesses; they
witnessed two assailants while scaling over the wall so they
were able to see their faces and on the basis thereof it was
quite easy for them to remember the features and then to
identify the male appellants during identification parade
proceedings; escape of Ramzana Bibi from crime scene is
not an abnormality, therefore, shall give no benefit to any of
the male appellants; it was immediately after the occurrence
when Ramzana Bibi disclosed about the names of male
appellants who were also nominated in FIR that was based
on prompt information received by police; medical evidence,
recoveries and expert reports stand in corroboration to the
ocular account; no enmity whatsoever exists between two
sides therefore, question of false involvement of any of the
appellants does not arise; statements of witnesses are not
suffering from any contradiction or infirmity hence cannot
be discarded; during cross-examination defence was not
successful to shatter the credibility of any of the witnesses.
All have finally contended that all the appellants have been
rightly convicted by the learned trial court on the basis of a

well reasoned judgment.

15. Learned counsel for complainant further added that as
Ramzana Bibi is the principal convict therefore her sentence
is liable to be enhanced from life imprisonment to death
penalty.

16. HEARD

17. Prosecutions’ story is based on the disclosure of
Ramzana Bibi (appellant) that she, at crime scene, stated that
she had given sleeping pills to Ameera Bibi and Munir
Ahmad and then she invited male appellants for the murder
of both of them. Had there been no revelation of Ramzana
Bibi in the field, it had to be a mystery that who were the
persons escaped from crime scene? Statement of Ramzana
Bibi which has been claimed as an extra judicial confession
has been found factually incorrect. The reports of PFSA
(PAC and PAB) show that the internal organs/stomach and
liver contents of both the deceased were sent to expert for
detection of drug or poison, however, according to these
reports there was no drug or poison detected in any of the
said organs.

18. It was the month of November when occurrence took
place at about 12:15 am. In this month even in this part of
the country almost winter starts. On coming to know about
firing not only two witnesses but other persons also arrived
at crime scene. After Ramzana Bibi made disclosure about
the crime, there was no occasion at all for her to escape from
that place in presence of considerable number of persons.
Simply to say that she by getting the chance was succeeded
to run is not acceptable to a prudent mind in particular when
none of the eye witnesses ever maintained that they tried to
chase the lady and to apprehend her?

19. Prosecution had claimed that Ramzana Bibi, on
17.11.2015, was produced by Muhammad Naeem the owner
of the Shed. He was not examined by the investigating

officer during the entire investigation. In the given
Murder Reference No. 17 of 2018 9
Criminal Appeal No.117-J and 96-J of 2018
Criminal Revision No.84 of 2018

circumstances, he was an important witness and by not
joining him in the investigation in fact prosecution is
responsible for withholding the best available evidence. So
this fact too has caused serious damage to the prosecutions’
case.

20. Inayat Ali (Pw-11) and Muhammad Ashraf (Pw-12) are
real brothers as well as real brothers of Ameera Bibi one of
the deceased. In cross-examination Inayat Ali categorically
admitted that he was not the resident of that locality. The
relevant answers given by him were as under: -

“My residence from place of
occurrence is about 60 miles.
Volunteered that my residence and
that of other Pws is 150 miles from
place of occurrence the residence of
Muhammad Ashraf Pw is at a
distance of 1 or 1% kilometers from
my residence towards East”

21. In view of above specific replies, Inayat Ali and
Muhammad Ashraf both were the chance witnesses. A
chance witness is the one who, if by coincidence or chance,
happens to be at the place of occurrence at the time it is
taking place and who in ordinary circumstances has to be not
at a place where he claims but is to be at his ordinary venue.
The evidence of a chance witness requires very cautious and
close scrutiny. He must adequately explain his presence at
the crime scene. In case of a chance witness, the prosecution
is burdened to show that what were those special reasons
that instead to be at his ordinary place he was present at a
point where he was not supposed to be? If the reasons are
sound, convincing, logical and corroborated from other
circumstances, the statement of a chance witness can be

accepted otherwise not’.

22. No doubt that Ameera Bibi (deceased) was the real
sister of both the eye witnesses but the fact remains that
what were those extraordinary circumstances that on
12.11.2015 both of them came there? When Inayat Ali
(Pw-11) was questioned in this regard he replied as under: -

“There was no special occasion of
our visit to the place of occurrence.
We just came there to see Munir
Ahmad and Ameera Bibi”
23. Similarly Muhammad Ashraf (Pw-12) in cross
examination responded as under: -

“There was no special occasion for
which we visited at the hose of Munir
Ahmad deceased”

24. To travel from a distance of about 150 miles by two
real brothers without any specific reason exactly on the same
day when on the following night occurrence took place,
speaks about some foul play in the prosecutions’ story hence
their credibility has lost the worth and they cannot be
believed.

25. Both the witnesses were also in contradiction when
Inayat Ali maintained that they had planned two days earlier
for their visit whereas, Muhammad Ashraf responded that
they made a plan about 4/5 days ago.

26. Another important fact in this case is that Muhammad
Ashraf (appellant) used to limb as admitted by the witnesses.
The wall of the house where occurrence took place was six
feet in height so how was it possible for him to scale over
the wall and to escape? In this context it was stated that on
one side of the wall there was small heap of garbage or some
bricks which might have been used by Muhammad Ashraf.
Even if this was the position, it was difficult for a person
who was having disability in his leg to climb and to scale

over the wall.
Murder Reference No. 17 of 2018 11
Criminal Appeal No.117-J and 96-J of 2018
Criminal Revision No.84 of 2018

27. Occurrence as claimed by prosecution took place at
about 12:15 midnight approximately. Statements of both the
eye witnesses do not show that there was any source of light
available at crime scene and this fact was also admitted by
Muhammad Afzal Inspector (Pw-14) that throughout the
investigation no source was shown for conceiving the
features of male appellants by the alleged eye witnesses.
28. For the sake of arguments if it is considered that both
the witnesses had seen the male appellants, the question
shall remain, whether they were in a position to see their
faces while they were running from crime scene? It was not
their case that they and male appellants came across to each
other when assailants were escaping. Muhammad Ashraf
(Pw-12) made an important reply in this context which was
as under: -
“The accused persons at the time of
departure were running from West to
East at the distance of 5/6 karams
from us”
29. What both the witnesses had seen and what they
conceived was that, one of the accused was with long height
and slim physique and other was with mid height. These
features under no circumstance can be stated to be the
relevant glimpse on the basis of which the witnesses were in
a position to identify the male appellants during the
identification parade proceedings.
30. To ensure a reliable identification parade prosecution
must prove also that the witnesses were able to see the
accused first time at crime scene and then during the
proceedings of identification parade. Prosecution is also
under obligation to establish that during the intervening
period there was no occasion or possibility or chance of
exposure of identity of accused.
31. Muhammad Afzal Inspector (Pw-14) in cross

examination admitted that when male appellants were
Murder Reference No. 17 of 2018 12
Criminal Appeal No.117-J and 96-J of 2018
Criminal Revision No.84 of 2018

produced before the learned Area Magistrate on 03.12.2015
for their judicial with the purpose of identification parade, he
did not mention in the application that they were muffled
faces. He also conceded that even in the order dated
03.12.2015 passed by the learned Magistrate there was
mention that male appellants had covered their faces.

32. Even otherwise we have observed that no safe
reliance can be placed on the identification parade
proceedings because it was the case of prosecution that
immediately after the male appellants were escaped,
Ramzana Bibi (appellant) had disclosed their names. She
also disclosed the fathers’ name of Allah Ditta as well as his
address. In these circumstances before male appellants were
arrested on 03.12.2015 there was every possibility for the
witnesses to see them and in this backdrop the identification
parade proceedings are of no value for the prosecution.

33. Mr. Muhammad Imran Tariq Magistrate (Pw-10) had
supervised the identification parade inside the Jail. This is
undeniable proposition that identification parade is a
relevant fact under Article 22 of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat,
Order 1984; it is not a requirement of law but only one of
the methods to test the veracity of the evidence of an eye
witness who had an occasion to see the accused and claims
to identify him; the evidence offered through identification
proceedings is not a substantive piece of evidence but is only
corroborative of the evidence given by the witnesses at the
trial; it has no independent value of its own and cannot as a
tule, form a sufficient basis for conviction though the same
may add some weight to the other evidence available on
record and that it is also not a rule of law but a rule of
prudence.

34. This too is not disputed that the identification parade
is governed by Volume III, Chapter 11-G, Part-C of the
Rules and Orders of the Lahore High Court, Lahore and
Murder Reference No. 17 of 2018 13
Criminal Appeal No.117-J and 96-J of 2018 ~
Criminal Revision No.84 of 2018

paragraph No. 26.32, Chapter XXVI of the Police Rules,
1934 and various instructions issued by the Government.
The important features for a valid identification parade are
that the proceedings shall be conducted under the
supervision of a Magistrate; proceedings shall be held inside
the jail; identification shall be carried as soon as possible
after the arrest of suspect; once the arrangements for
proceedings have been undertaken, the Officer investigating
the case and any Police Officer assisting him in that
investigation should have no access whatever either to the
suspect or to the witnesses; list of all persons included in
identification should be prepared, which should contain their
names, parentage, address and occupation; the suspects shall
be placed among other persons similarly dressed up, of the
same religion and of same social status; there shall be
proportion of 8 or 9 such persons to one suspect; the
identifying witnesses shall be kept separate from each other
and at such a distance from the place of identification as
shall render it impossible for them to see the suspects or any
of the persons concerned in the proceedings, until they are
called upon to make identification; each witness shall be
brought up separately to attempt his identification; care shall
be taken that the remaining witnesses are still kept out of
sight and hearing and that no opportunity is permitted for
communication to pass between witnesses who have been
called up and those who have not; the Magistrate conducting
the proceedings must take an intelligent interest in the
proceedings and not be just a silent spectator of the same
bearing in mind at all times that the life and liberty of
someone depends only upon his vigilance and caution and

that he is required to record in his report all the precautions

taken by him for a fair conduct of the proceedings”.

35. The identification parade proceedings (PN) show that
only the names and parentage of the dummies were
recorded. It does not indicate their ages, religion or caste.
Even this report does not show that male appellants and
dummies were having similarity. We have also observed that
Muhammad Ashraf one of the male appellants was a person
who admittedly used to limb. The report is completely silent
that if the said disability of Muhammad Ashraf remained
unexposed during the entire proceedings.

36. We, therefore, conclude that Inayat Ali and
Muhammad Ashraf the alleged eye witnesses were not
present at crime venue and in fact it was an unseen
occurrence. For this reason also we declare that the evidence
of identification parade cannot be relied upon.

37. Coming to the medical evidence it does not require
any detailed discussion about injuries on the persons of two
deceased because their death by way of firearm injuries have
not been disputed by appellants however, the post mortem
reports have negated the version of prosecution that it was a
promptly lodged FIR. Admittedly, the complaint (PO) was
completed at 02:45 am and according to Muhammad Afzal
Inspector the dead bodies were sent to hospital at about
08:00/09:00 am. This position cannot be acceptable to a
mind that if at 02:45 am the complaint was completed then
why almost more than four hours were consumed for the
preparation of documents. Even if it is ignored, how
prosecution will answer the fact which was disclosed by
Dr. Muhammad Amin (Pw-6) that after receiving the
complete documents from police, he conducted the post
mortem examination at 12:15 pm? How prosecution can
respond when said doctor answered in cross-examination
that before 11:30 am neither the dead body of Munir Ahmad
was received in hospital nor the relevant documents were

given to him? How the prosecution will come out from the
Murder Reference No. 17 of 2018 15
Criminal Appeal No.117-J and 96-J of 2018
Criminal Revision No.84 of 2018

challenge thrown by its own witness Dr. Shawana Ambreen
(Pw-9) who maintained that she received the dead body of
Ameera Bibi along with complete documents at 04:00 pm on
15.11.2015 and in cross-examination she reaffirmed that
before 03:30 pm neither the dead body nor the relevant
documents were produced before her?

38. The delayed post mortem examination and delayed
receipt of dead bodies and the relevant documents are the
strong reasons to hold that prosecution’s case is doubtful 7.
So we declare further that the occurrence did not take place
in the manners as alleged by the so-called eye witnesses of
the case.

39. Prosecution is forcefully relying on the positive report
of PFSA (PAA) that shows that the empties were fired from
the pistol recovered at the instance of Muhammad Ashraf
(appellant). Prosecution has also claimed that from the crime
scene spit was taken into possession which later on matched
with the buckle swabs of Muhammad Ashraf as evident
from the report of PFSA (PAE).

40. So far as positive report of firearm expert is
concerned, this proposition has already been settled that if
ocular account of the case is disbelieved, such report being
corroborative in nature cannot be used as substantive piece
of evidence for the purpose of conviction”.

41. No doubt that the DNA report has to be considered as
a strongest corroborative evidence but at the same time it too
has been settled that usefulness of DNA analysis depends
mostly on the skill, ability and integrity shown by the
Investigating Officers who are to first arrive at the scene of
crime and that unless the evidence is properly documented,

collected, packaged and preserved, it will not meet the legal

42. In the case in hand there was delay of 13 days for
sending the spit to the Office of PFSA which has not been
explained. The memo (PU) also does not show that what the
precautions and measures were adopted by the Investigating
Officer while collecting, packaging and preserving the spit?
We find that in view of the principles settled by the apex
Court, it is also the duty of prosecution to prove that
material/evidence was properly collected, packaged and
preserved and if it is not so, the DNA shall not meet the
legal and scientific requirements for admissibility.

43. Muhammad Ashraf (appellant) to the question No.9
about the collection of spit from crime scene had replied as
under: -

“The police arrested me on the
second day of occurrence and
Investigating Officer took spit from
me at police station Machiwal and
that he has not shown my formal
arrest. Later on he showed my formal
arrest and in this way he maneuvered
this fabricated and false evidence
against me”

44. Even during identification parade proceedings (PA)
when learned Magistrate asked from male appellants about
any objection, they categorically replied that they were kept
at Police Station for about 20 days.

45. When ocular account and identification proceedings
have been disbelieved; when it has also been held that
medical evidence has not corroborated the prosecutions’
story and when it is too established on the record that police
got the names of male appellants on the same day, the
version of Muhammad Ashraf in his examination made

under Section 342 Cr.P.C as well as before the learned

'© Ali Haider @ Pappu vs. Jameel Hussain & others PLD 2021 SC 362
Murder Reference No. 17 of 2018 17

Criminal Appeal No.117-J and 96-J of 2018

Criminal Revision No.84 of 2018

Magistrate during identification parade proceedings has got
the worth. Therefore it can be safely held that evidence of
spit has been fabricated in the way as claimed by
Muhammad Ashraf (appellant).

46. We cannot keep out of sight the principles that it is the
duty of prosecution to stand on its own legs and to prove the
case beyond reasonable doubt?” whereas, in this case the
said duty has not been discharged successfully hence the
benefit shall go to appellants’’ as a matter of right and
privilege.

47. We therefore, allow both the criminal appeals, set
aside the impugned judgment and acquit all the appellants
from this case. They are in custody and shall be released
forthwith if not required in any other case. The case property
shall be dealt with in the same manners as directed by the
learned trial court.

48. The criminal revision filed by complainant in above
circumstances is dismissed.

49. The death sentences awarded to male appellants are
NOT CONFIRMED and Murder Reference is answered in
NEGATIVE.
