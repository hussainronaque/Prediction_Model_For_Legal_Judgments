SAYYED MAZAHAR ALI AKBAR NAOVI, J:-

Muhammad Asif son of Nazar Muhammad, caste Baloch, resident of
Chhawani Khawaja Salah, Tehsil Bhera, District Sargodha, appellant
along with Maqbool, Mustafa, Muhammad Arshad, Muhammad Imran
son of Shamsher, Muhammad Imran son of Sardara, Muhammad

registered with Police Station Bhera. He was tried by learned
Additional Sessions Judge Bhalwal, District Sargodha under the
afore-mentioned offences. Learned trial court seized with the matter
in terms of judgment dated 08.09.2015 convicted and sentenced the

appellant in the following terms: -

> Under Section 302(b), PPC, sentenced to death as Ta’zir
with direction to pay Rs.2,00,000/- as compensation to
legal heirs of deceased in terms of Section 544-A,
Cr.P.C. to be recovered as arrears of land revenue and
in case of default in payment thereof, to undergo SI. for
six months.

2. Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the learned trial
court, the appellant has assailed his conviction and sentence through
filing Crl. Appeal No.1617/2015 whereas learned trial court
forwarded Murder Reference No.33/2016 for confirmation or
otherwise of sentence of death inflicted upon the convict in terms of
Section 374, Cr.P.C. The complainant filed Crl. Appeal No.1830/2015
against acquittal of Maqbool, Mustafa, Muhammad Arshad,
Muhammad Imran son of Shamsher, Muhammad Imran son of
Sardara, Muhammad Amir, Sardara, Farrukh Javed, Wazir Khan and
Mst. Riffat Batool/respondents whereas he also filed Crl. Revision
No.992/2015 seeking enhancement in compensation amount against
Muhammad Asif/convict. As all the appeals are arising out of one and
the same judgment of the learned trial court, therefore, these are

being disposed off through consolidated judgment.

3. Prosecution story as embodied in the FIR (Exh.PJ)
lodged on the statement (Exh.PJ/1) of Muhammad Khan son of Baqar
Khan, caste Maryana Gondal, resident of Jahanpur (PW-6) is that the
complainant is involved in Zamindara. On 05.05.2010 Asif son of
Nazar Muhammad, caste Baloch, resident of Chhawani Khawaja
Salah, etc. had kidnapped Mst. Riffat Bibi, daughter of the
complainant regarding which case FIR No.155/2010, dated
Murder Reference No.33/2016 3
Crl. Appeal No.1617/2015

Crl. Appeal No.1830/2015
Cri. Revision No.992/2015

07.05.2010, offence under Section 365, PPC, was lodged at Police
Station Bhera. Subsequently Mst. Rifat Bibi contracted marriage with
Asif and she also made statement in his favour, however, efforts were
made for patching up the matter between the parties. On 26.09.2010
Mst. Rifat Bibi called the complainant for compromise on the premise
that he had persuaded Asif etc. and it was decided that both sides will
get together at the dera of Muhammad Ameer son of Muhammad
Khan, caste Jahanpur. On this the complainant along with Gulzar
Ahmed son of Soni, (2) Muhammad Riaz son of Bhai Khan, both
Marryana Gondal by caste and residents of the same village riding on
a motorcycle whereas Mst. Amina Bibi wife of the complainant along
with her son Muhammad Nazeer riding on another motorcycle were
heading towards Dera. Nazeer Ahmed along with his mother were
ahead at some distance and soon they reached near the agricultural
land of Qari son of Siddique within the territorial jurisdiction of
Chhawani Khawaja Salah, from the opposite side (1) Muhammad Asif
son of Nazar Muhammad, armed with rifle 44-bore, (2) Javed alias
Mian son of Nazar Muhammad armed with gun .12-bore, (3) Nazeer
son of Muhammad Ameer armed with pistol .30-bore, (4) Arshad son
of Muhammad Ameer armed with rifle .44-bore, (5) Maqbool son of
Muhammad Afzal armed with gun .12-bore, (6) Mustafa son of
Muhammad Afzal armed with rifle .44-bore, (7) Mst. Rifat Bibi wife of
Muhammad Asif empty handed, all Baloch by caste and residents of
Chhawani Khawaja Salah, (8) Imran son of Sardar, caste Marryana
Gondal, resident of Jahanpur armed with rifle 44-bore and two
unknown accused persons armed with fire arms intercepted them, who
were identified in the headlights of motorcycles. Mst. Riffat Bibi
raised lalkara that the complainant wanted to bring her back and they
should not be spared. Muhammad Nazeer son of the complainant had
alighted from the motorcycle when Muhammad Asif made a straight

fire shot with his rifle, which landed at his left cheek leaving its exit
Murder Reference No.33/2016 4
Crl. Appeal No.1617/2015

Crl. Appeal No.1830/2015
Cri. Revision No.992/2015

from back side of neck. On sustaining injury son of the complainant
fell down on the ground while the other accused persons also made
indiscriminate aerial firing. It was alleged that the complainant and
other PWs witnessed the occurrence while Muhammad Nazeer

succumbed to the injuries at the spot.

Motive behind the occurrence as disclosed in the crime report
was that earlier Muhammad Asif etc. had kidnapped Riffat Bibi and
they had suspicion that the complainant party will take her back and
also cause harm to them. Due to this grudge and suspicion all the
accused persons in connivance with each other on the abetment of
Sardar son of Marja, caste Gondal, resident of Jahanpur, Ameer son
of Allah Bakhsh, caste Baloch, resident of Chhawani Khawaja Salah
which was overheard by Bashir son of Baqar and Nasar Hayhat son
of Ghulam Muhammad, both Marryana Gondal by caste and residents
of the same village, committed the occurrence. While leaving
Muhammad Ameer son of Muhammad Khan and Gulzar Ahmed son of
Mola Bakhsh to safeguard the dead body the complainant reached
Police Station and made his statement on the basis of which FIR was

chalked out.

4. After registration of the case, investigation was entrusted
to Ghulam Rasool, S.I. (PW-17), who along with other police officials
reached the place of occurrence. After inspecting dead body,
Investigating Officer prepared injury statement (Exh.PC), drafted
inquest report (Exh.PD) and dispatched the dead body to mortuary
under the escort of Muhammad Tariq 821/C (PW-12). From the spot
Investigating Officer secured blood stained earth vide recovery memo
Exh.PG and also collected four empty cartridges of gun .12-ore (P-
2/1-4), two missed bullets of rifle .44-bore (P-3/1-2) and four crime
empties of rifle 44-bore (P-4/1-4), which he took into possession vide

recovery memo Exh.PH. He also prepared rough site plan of the place
Murder Reference No.33/2016 5
Crl. Appeal No.1617/2015

Crl. Appeal No.1830/2015
Cri. Revision No.992/2015

of occurrence (Exh.PU). After postmortem examination last worn
clothes of the deceased shirt (P-5) and shalwar (P-6) were produced
before the Investigating Officer, which were secured vide recovery
memo Exh.PQ. Upon the direction of Investigating Officer and
pointing out of the PWs, on 01.10.2010, Muhammad Hafeez,
Draftsman (PW-18) took rough notes of the place of occurrence and
thereafter prepared scaled site plan (Exh.PB and Exh.PB/1), which
was made part of the file. Subsequently investigation was entrusted to
Zafar Abbas, S.J. (PW-16), who on 16.11.2013 arrested the appellant
and obtained his physical remand. During the course of interrogation
in pursuance of disclosure on 19.11.2013, appellant led to the
recovery of rifle .44-bore (P-7) along with ten live bullets (P-8/1-10)
which Investigating Officer took into possession vide recovery memo

Exh.PP.

5. As a result of investigation, the appellant was found
guilty, hence Investigating Officer prepared report under Section 173,
Cr.P.C. and sent the same to the court of Sessions en-routed through
the Illaqa Magistrate as provided under Section 190(2), Cr.P.C. The
learned trial court formally charge sheeted the accused vide order
dated 02.01.2014 to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
Prosecution in order to substantiate its case produced as many as

nineteen (19) prosecution witnesses.

6. Occular account in this case consists of the statements of
Muhammad Khan (PW-6), Mst. Amina Bibi (PW-7) and Gulzar
Ahmed (PW-10). Tariq Mehmmod 821/C (PW-12) had escorted dead
body to mortuary while Muhammad Hafeez, Draftsman (PW-18) had
prepared scaled site plan of the place of occurrence. Investigation in
this case was conducted by Ghulam Rasool, S.I. (PW-17), Zafar
Abbas, S.I. (PW-16) and Ghulam Jillani, DSP (PW-19).
Murder Reference No.33/2016 6

Crl. Appeal No.1830/2015
Cri. Revision No.992/2015

Dr. Noor-ul-Amin, Medical Officer (PW-2) on 26.09.2010 had
conducted postmortem examination on the dead body of Muhammad

Nazeer deceased and observed following injuries on his person: -

“7. A firearm wound of entrance 1 4% cm x 4 cm with
collar of abrasion present on left cheek.

2. A fire arm wound of exit 3 cm x 1 cm on back and
outer and right side of neck.”

After postmortem examination, doctor rendered the following
opinion: -
“In my opinion, death had occurred due to shock and
haemorrhage under injuries No.l & 2 which were
sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of nature.
Both injuries were ante mortem caused by fire arm.
Probable time that elapsed between injury and death was

immediate and between death and post mortem
examination was within one day.”

Statements of rest of the prosecution witnesses are formal in nature.

7. The appellant was examined under Section 342, Cr.P.C,
wherein he refuted the allegation levelled against him in the
prosecution evidence. He opted neither to appear as his own witness
in terms of Section 340(2), Cr.P.C, nor did he opt to adduce evidence
in defence. While replying to the question why this case against him
and why the PWs deposed against him, the appellant made the

following deposition:-

“The PWs deposed falsely being close relative of
complainant and deceased. Instant false case has been
registered against me by twisting the real facts.”’

8. Learned trial court after evaluating the evidence
available on record, found version of the prosecution proved beyond
shadow of reasonable doubt against the appellant, which resulted into

his conviction in the afore-stated terms.
Murder Reference No.33/2016 7

Crl. Appeal No.1617/2015

Crl. Appeal No.1830/2015
Cri. Revision No.992/2015

9. At the very outset learned counsel for the appellant
contended that the impugned judgment has been recorded by the learned
trial court in a slipshod manner without adverting to real facts of the
case and material available on record. Learned counsel vigorously
argued that the story advanced by the prosecution in the crime report,
on the face of it does not appeal to reason. Further contended that while
making their statements during the course of trial, the prosecution
witnesses of occular account took somersault and changed the story with
regard to mode and manner of occurrence, hence the same cannot be
given any legal credence. It was argued that the occular account is
belied by medical evidence on minute details. Learned counsel
vigorously contended that during the course of investigation bulk of
prosecution version was found false as accused Imran son of Sardar,
Maqbool, Muhammad Arshad, Ghulam Mustafa, Muhammad Ameer and
Sardar were found innocent. Moreover, except the appellant rest of the
accused were acquitted of the charge on the same set of evidence.
Learned counsel contended that the motorcycle (source of light) was not
taken into possession by the Investigating Officer. Learned counsel
vigorously argued that motive set forth in the crime report could not be
substantiated. As far as recovery of rifle .44-bore (P-7) affected from the
appellant and report of the concerned quarter in this regard is
concerned, it was argued that as both the articles were dispatched to the
office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency together, therefore, the report
is of no legal consequence. Learned counsel finally argued that keeping
in view all the facts and circumstances brought forth on record,
prosecution has miserably failed to establish its case against the
appellant beyond reasonable doubt, hence, conviction and sentence
recorded by the learned trial court is not sustainable in the eyes of law,

which is liable to be set aside.

10. On the other hand learned Deputy Prosecutor General

assisted by learned counsel for the complainant vehemently opposed
Murder Reference No.33/2016 8

Crl. Appeal No.1617/2015

Crl. Appeal No.1830/2015
Cri. Revision No.992/2015

the contentions raised by learned counsel for the appellant. It was
argued that although the occurrence had taken place at evening time,
however, both the parties being previously known to each other, no
question of mistaken identity arises. Learned counsel for the
complainant contended that the prosecution witnesses of occular
account while making their statements fully corroborated the
prosecution version on minute details. Although they were subjected
to lengthy cross-examination, however, nothing adverse to the
prosecution version could be brought on record. It was argued that
medical evidence is in line with the occular account. Further argued
that after the occurrence, the appellant became fugitive from law and
after his arrest, rifle 44-bore was recovered on his pointing out.
Learned counsel contended that the appellant had committed the
occurrence with strong motive, who was also found guilty during the
course of investigation as such his name was placed in column No.3
of the report prepared under Section 173, Cr.P.C. Lastly it was
argued that the appellant had taken the life of father of the
complainant without any just case while prosecution adduced its case
through straight-forward, reliable and confidence inspiring evidence,
therefore, the learned trial court rightly convicted the appellant under

the relevant provisions of law.

11. While arguing Crl. Appeal No.1830/2015, learned
counsel contended that Maqbool, Mustafa, Muhammad Arshad,
Muhammad Imran son of Shamsher, Muhammad Imran son of
Sardara, Muhammad Amir, Sardara, Farrukh Javed, Wazir Khan and
Mst. Riffat Batool were named in the crime report out of whom
Nazeer, Arshad, Maqbool, Mustafa and Imran had also made firing at
the time of occurrence. Further contended that prosecution through

adducing cogent and confidence inspiring evidence established its
Murder Reference No.33/2016 9

Crl. Appeal No.1617/2015

Crl. Appeal No.1830/2015
Cri. Revision No.992/2015

case against the respondents, hence learned trial court fell in error

while acquitting them of the charge.

12. While arguing Crl. Revision No.992/2015, learned
counsel for the petitioner contended that due to firing made by
Muhammad Asif/respondent, Nazeer Ahmed was done to death, hence
keeping in view peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, amount

of compensation is also liable to be enhanced.

13. We have heard the arguments advanced from both sides

and perused the record available on file.

14. It is an established principle of law that each criminal
case has its own peculiar facts and circumstances and the same
hardly coincide with each other. No doubt in this unfortunate
occurrence Muhammad Nazeer young son of the complainant aged
about 20/25 years was done to death due to firing made by the
assailants, however, this Court has to ascertain the truthfulness of the
prosecution story while taking into consideration all the facts and
circumstances. It is an admitted fact that the occurrence had taken
place on 26.09.2010 at 7:00 p.m. within the territorial jurisdiction of
Police Station Bhera, District Sargodha while the matter was reported
to the police at 8:30 p.m. whereas inter se distance between the place
of occurrence and the Police Station is 10-KMs. However, the
promptness of the crime report would be determined after taking into
consideration the other facts and circumstances floating on the
record. In order to substantiate its version the prosecution led
evidence qua occular account, motive, medical evidence, recovery of
rifle, as well as, investigation and other corroborative pieces of

evidence.

15. Admittedly while adjudicating the criminal matters,

occular account is always considered as principal evidence. In the
Murder Reference No.33/2016 10
Crl. Appeal No.1617/2015

Crl. Appeal No.1830/2015
Cri. Revision No.992/2015

instant case the prosecution version qua occular account consists of
the statements of Muhammad Khan, complainant (PW-6), Mst. Amina
Bibi (PW-7) and Gulzar Ahmed (PW-10). Perusal of record available
on file reflects that while lodging the crime report it was averred by
the complainant that in order to affect compromise on the issue of
marriage of Riffat Bibi with Muhammad Asif appellant against the
wishes of complainant party they were called and soon they reached
near the agricultural land of Qari son of Siddique, the appellant along
with other co-accused intercepted them and due to firing made by the
accused persons, Nazeer Ahmed was done to death. However, while
making their statements during the course of trial, the complainant, as
well as, other prosecution witnesses of occular account took a
complete somersault by contending that firstly they reached the dera
of Ameer where the accused party did not turn up. Subsequently
Wazeer, co-accused, called son of the complainant and his mother to
accompany to their house to have meeting with Mst. Riffat Bibi. On
their way at a distance of 10-acres away from the dera, the appellant
along with other accused persons intercepted them where altercation
took place and the accused made firing, which resulted into injuries
on the person of Nazeer Ahmed. Relevant extract out of the statement

of Muhammad Khan, complainant reads as under:-

“T along with Gulzar Ahmad, Muhammad Riaz, on
separate motorcycle while my wife Amina Bibi and son
Muhammad Nazir deceased on separate Motorcycle,
proceeded to a Dera of Muhammad Ameer. We reached
at the Dera of Ameer my relative at about 6:00 p.m. The
accused party did not turn up on the Dera. After a short
while about half acre away from Dera of Ameer referred
above accused Wazeer came and called my son
Muhammad Nazir deceased and my wife Amina Bibi
separately and told them that Riffat Bibi was hesitant to
come to the Dera of Muhammad Ameer who was her
uncle (Khalu) and he asked my wife and my son Nazir
deceased to come along with him who riding on
motorcycle along with Wazir accused riding on another
Murder Reference No.33/2016 11
Crl. Appeal No.1617/2015

Crl. Appeal No.1830/2015
Cri. Revision No.992/2015

motorcycle went towards East. We on_ separate
motorcycle, I along with Gulzar and Riaz followed them
on separate motorcycle. When about 10 acres away from
the Dera of Muhammad Ameer relative, we reached
about at about 6:45 p.m. near an open space where crop
of milt was present where Asif and Imran accused while
armed with rifles 44 bore, Wazir armed with 30-bore,
Mst. Riffat empty handed, Farrukh Jaffer armed with 12
bore gun, Imran son of Shamas armed with 12 bore gun
came forward and stopped my wife and my son
Muhammad Nazir whom we identified in the lights of
motorcycles. In the meantime, an altercation took place.
Resultantly, Asif accused fired straight at Nazir deceased
my son with his rifle.....”

Similarly Mst. Amina Bibi (PW-7) and Gulzar Ahmed (PW-10) while
taking somersault made material improvements contrary to contents
of their statements recorded under Section 161, Cr.P.C. in order to
bring the case in line with the statement made by the complainant.
These aspects when taken into consideration shatter the credence of
authenticity of the statements of the prosecution witnesses of occular
account. It is cordial principle of law that any statement improved
during trial is not worth relying, which is also deprecated by the
principle enunciated in two salutary judgments. In the dictum of law
laid down by august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Saeed

Ahmed Shah vs. The State (1993 SCMR 550), it has been held that the

statement of any witness improved at trial is not worth relying rather
such improvement creates serious doubt about its veracity and
credibility. Similar view was held in another case reported as
Muhammad Rafique and others vs. The State and others (2010 SCMR
385).

16. There is no cavil to this proposition that the occurrence
had taken place in the month of June at 7:00 p.m. whereas in the
crime report the complainant had given the specific role of each and
every accused named in the FIR. According to prosecution version the

prosecution witnesses had identified the assailants in the light of
Murder Reference No.33/2016 12
Crl. Appeal No.1617/2015

Crl. Appeal No.1830/2015
Cri. Revision No.992/2015

headlights of the motorcycles, which were also used as means of
transportation. However, the Investigating Officer had not taken into
possession the means of transportation, as well as, light through
which the prosecution witnesses had identified the assailants to
supplement the prosecution version. Hence, the prosecution case is
squarely hit by the dictates of the superior courts of the country laid
down in the cases of BASHIR AHMED alias MANNU vs. THE STATE
(1996 SCMR 308) and NAZEER AHMAD vs. GEHNE KHAN and
others (2011 SCMR 1473). In the case of BASHIR AHMED alias
MANNU ys. THE STATE (1996 SCMR 308) while dealing the issue

it was held as under:-

“---Bulb in the light of which eye-witnesses were shown
to have seen the occurrence was not taken into custody
by the police and the presence of electricity at that place
had been concocted----.”

17. As far as medical evidence in this case is concerned, Dr.
Noor-ul-Ameen (PW-2) had conducted postmortem examination on
the dead body of the deceased and observed two injuries on his
person. However, although the postmortem examination was
conducted on 26.09.2010 at 11:30 p.m. whereas according to
prosecution version the occurrence had taken place on the same day
at 7:00 p.m. but doctor did not give specific duration between death
and postmortem examination rather the same was mentioned as
“within one day”. Even otherwise it is consistent view of the superior
courts that medical evidence only discloses the nature of injury and
the weapon used but it does not lead to the culprits. Wisdom in this
regard is sought from the ratio decidendi of august Supreme Court of
Pakistan in the cases of MURSAL KAZMI alias QAMAR SHAH and
another_vs. THE STATE (2009 SCMR 1410) and MUHAMMAD
TASAWEER vs. Hafiz ZULKARNAIN and 2 others (PLD 2009

Supreme Court 53); wherein following principle was laid down:-
Murder Reference No.33/2016 13
Crl. Appeal No.1617/2015

Crl. Appeal No.1830/2015
Cri. Revision No.992/2015

“---§. 302/34---Appreciation of evidence---Medical
evidence---Significance---Medical evidence may confirm
the ocular evidence with regard to the seat of the injury,
nature of the injury, kind of weapon used in the
occurrence but it would not connect the accused with the
commission of the crime.”

18. As far as motive in this case is concerned, although it is
stated that Mst. Riffat Bibi accused (since acquitted) and Muhammad
Asif, appellant had apprehension that the complainant party might not
take Mst. Riffat Bibi back to their house, however, it has come on
record that she had contracted marriage with the appellant on
05.05.2010 while till 24.09.2010 absolutely no effort was made to
affect compromise between the parties. Hence, the motive set forth in
the crime report neither seems plausible nor any evidence was

adduced to substantiate the same.

19. As far as recovery of rifle 44-bore allegedly affected
from the appellant and report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency
(Exh.PZ/1) which undeniably is positive, is concerned, admittedly
both the crime empties and rifle were dispatched to the quarter
concerned on the same day; therefore, the report is squarely devoid of

legal credence.

20. As far as absconsion of the appellant as contended by
learned counsel for the complainant is concerned, it is established
principle of law that mere absconsion in isolation is not a proof of
guilt of an accused. Respectful reliance in this regard is placed on the
ratio decidendi of august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of
Rasool Muhammad vs. Asal Muhammad and another (PLJ 1995 S.C.
477); whereby their Lordships had held as under: -

“Disappearance of a person named as a murder/culprit
after occurrence, is but natural, whether named rightly
or wrongly ---Abscondance per se is not a proof of guilt
of an accused person --- It may, however, create
Murder Reference No.33/2016 14
Crl. Appeal No.1617/2015

Crl. Appeal No.1830/2015
Cri. Revision No.992/2015

suspicions against him but suspicions after all are
suspicions.”

21. Fact also remains that in the crime report besides the
appellant, Maqbool, Mustafa, Muhammad Arshad, Muhammad Imran
son of Shamsher, Muhammad Imran son of Sardara, Muhammad
Amir, Sardara, Farrukh Javed, Wazir Khan and Mst. Riffat Batool,
were arrayed as accused, however, during the course of trial they
were acquitted of the charge on the same set of evidence. It is settled
principle of law that if evidence of the prosecution is disbelieved qua
bulk of accused it cannot be believed qua the other in the absence of
very strong corroboration, which is squarely missing in the case in
hand. Respectful reliance in this regard is placed on the ratio
decidendi of august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the cases of Akhtar
Ali and others vs. The State (PLJ 2008 SC 269), Shera alias Sher
Muhammad's case (1999 SCMR 697) and Sher Bahadur’s case (1972
SCMR 651).

22. From the facts and circumstances narrated above, we are
persuaded to hold that the prosecution case is pregnant with major
discrepancies creating serious dents in its authenticity and in such
like situations it becomes incumbent upon the Court to extend the
benefit of doubt in favour of the accused. Furthermore, to extend the
benefit of doubt so many circumstances are not required rather one
circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in the veracity of the
prosecution version is sufficient for the purpose, not as a matter of
grace rather as a matter of right. Respectful reliance in this regard is
placed on the ratio decidendi of august Supreme Court of Pakistan in

the case of TARIQ PERVEZ vs. THE STATE (1995 SCMR 1345);

wherein following principle was laid down: -

“.--Art. 4---Benefit of doubt, grant of---For giving benefit
of doubt to an accused it is not necessary that there
should be many circumstances creating doubts---If a
simple circumstance creates reasonable doubt in a
Murder Reference No.33/2016 15
Crl. Appeal No.1617/2015

Crl. Appeal No.1830/2015
Cri. Revision No.992/2015

prudent mind about the guilt of accused, then he will be
entitled to such benefit not as a matter of grace and
concession but as a matter of right.”

Similarly in the case titled ARIF HUSSAIN AND ANOTHER vs. THE
STATE (1983 SCMR 428), the august Supreme Court of Pakistan had
further held as under:-

“---§. 302---Murder---Evidence---Benefit of doubt---
Prosecution case not free from doubt---Charges not
brought home to accused in manner required under law--
-Accused given benefit of doubt and acquitted”.

Similar view was affirmed in the case of Muhammad Akram vs. The

State (2009 SCMR 230).

Moreover, it is golden principle of law that the Court ought to
let off 100 guilty but should not convict one innocent person on the
basis of suspicion. Resultantly while setting aside the conviction and
sentence recorded by the learned trial court in terms of judgment
dated 08.09.2015, Crl. Appeal No.1617/2015 filed by the appellant is
accepted_in toto as a consequence whereof he is ordered to be
acquitted of the charge in FIR No.343/2010, dated 26.09.2010,
offence under Sections 302, 148, 149, 109, PPC, registered with
Police Station Bhera. The appellant is directed to be released
