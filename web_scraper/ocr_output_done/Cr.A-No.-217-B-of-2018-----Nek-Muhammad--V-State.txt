SHAKEEL AHMAD, _J.---_ Through _ this
Cr.Misc: No.77-B/2018 U/S. 426 Cr.P.C, the
petitioners namely, Naik Muhammad, Mst: Alima
Bibi alias Asma Bibi, Mst; Gul Zarina and Mst:
Gul Roshan Zada, have sought suspension of their
sentence, who were convicted U/S. 9 (C) Control

of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 and sentenced as

under:-

S.No | Name of accused Sentence

accused namely- with a fine of

Alima Bibi, Mst; Rs.100000/-
Gul Zarina and each, in default
Mst: Gul Shan of payment of
Zada fine to further

months SI.
2. Learned counsel for the petitioners

contended that at the time of arrest Mst: Gul
Zarina was accompanied by a daughter aged about
three years and six months and also pregnant, and
now she has given birth to a male child during her
captivity. He next contended that Mst: Gul Roshan
Zada was accompanied by two daughters namely-
Gul-e-Lala aged about three years and Ayesha
about two years while Mst: Alima Bibi is old and
infirm. He further contended that sentence
awarded to all the three lady accused is short. He
lastly contended that sentence of accused Naik
Muhammad is not based on cogent evidence and
there is no likely-hood that the appeal to be heard
in near future and prayed for suspension of
petitioners’ sentences.

3. Vide order dated 04.03.2019,

Superintendent Central Jail was directed to furnish

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr.Justice Shakeel Ahmad

detail report regarding female prisoners. In
pursuance thereof the report was submitted,
wherein, he admitted the above contention of the
learned counsel for the petitioners only to the
extent of petitioner Mst: Gul Zarin and Mst: Gul
Roshan Zada.

4. Learned Addl: A.G appearing on
behalf of the state conceded prayer of the learned
counsel for the petitioners only to the extent of
lady accused. Regarding male accused he
submitted that the impugned judgment does not
suffer from legal error and maintained that after
conviction, the presumption of his innocence has
come to an end.

5. We have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the parties and have gone through the
record with their able assistance.

6. There is no cavil to the proposition
that the appellate court possesses powers U/S. 426
Cr.P.C, to suspend the sentence of a convict and
release him on bail. Such power to grant bail is not
fettered by the provisions of Section. 497 Cr.P.C.
In this context reliance can well be placed on the

judgments reported as The State V Shah Sawar

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr.Justice Shakeel Ahmad

(1969 SCMR 151), wherein it was held that power
U/S. 426 Cr.P.C is not controlled by the provison
of Section. 496 & 497 Cr.P.C, however, the
principles provided therein indicted will have to be
borne in mind in granting or refusing bail. In this
respect reference may also be made to the case
reported as Bahadar Khan V The State (1969
SCMR 81).

7. It was admitted by the prosecution
that at the time of arrest accused Mst: Gul Zarina
was accompanied by one daughter namely-Sonia
aged about three years and six months, and she
was pregnant of 28 weeks and during captivity she
gave birth to a male child on 14.01.2019 at about
03:50 PM. It was also admitted that Mst: Gul
Roshan Zada was accompanied by two daughters
namely-Gul-e-Lala aged about three years and
Ayesha aged about two years and that they are
confined in female section of the jail with above
babies. We feel proud to follow the principle laid-
down by our Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in
the famous case of Ghamidiyya, the Holy Prophet
Muhammad (PBUH) was pleased to suspend the

sentence passed on a pregnant woman not only till

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr.Justice Shakeel Ahmad

delivery of child, but, for period of Riza’at as well,
basically for the welfare of the child. In this behalf
reliance can be placed on the case reported as
Hazoor Bakhsh V Federation of Pakistan (PLD
1981 FSC 145). In the following cases as well, the
sentences passed on female convicts were

suspended for the betterment of children:-

(1) Mst. Nusrat v. The State 1996 SCMR
973, (2) Liagat and another vy. the State
1999 PCr.LJ 1004, (3) Mst. Nasree v. The
State 1998 MLD 1350, (4) Mst. Ansar Jan
v. The State and another 2000 PCr.LJ 586,
(5) Hazoor Bakhsh y. Federation of

Pakistan PLD 1981 FSC 145.

8. Perusal of record further reflects that
lady accused were sentenced only for five years,
which is a short sentence and there is no likely-
hood of the appeal being taken up in near future.
They have served sentence for eight months and
14 days and also earned remission for one year
three months and six days. Benefit of Section. 382-

B Cr.P.C was also extended to them. Thus, they

have made out a case for suspension of sentence.

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr.Justice Shakeel Ahmad

In this behalf reliance can be placed on the cases
reported as Nazar Ahmad & 2 others V The state
(2005 P.Cr.L.J 657 Karachi), Abdul Hameed V
Mhammad Abdullah (1999 SCMR 2589), Ilyas
alias Billu V The State (2008 MLD 312)and
Mehmood Iqbal V The State (2008 MLD 1376).

9. So far as case of Male accused Naik
Muhammad is concerned, perusal of the facts and
judgment impugned herein, leads us to the
conclusion that the judgment on the face of it, does
not suffer from any legal error, therefore, we feel
that it would not be justified to suspend his
sentence.

10. For what has been discussed
hereinabove, this petition U/S. 426 Cr.P.C is
partially allowed to the extent of all the three lady
accused, the conviction and sentence awarded to
all the lady accused are suspended till the final
adjudication of the instant appeal and they are
directed to be released on bail subject to furnishing
bail bonds in the sum of Rs.2,00,000/-(two lacs)
with two sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of the learned trial court. The learned

trial court must ensure that the sureties are reliable

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr.Justice Shakeel Ahmad

men of means, local, and related to the lady
accused within the prohibited degree. However,
prayer of male accused Naik Muhammad for
suspension of sentence is declined.
