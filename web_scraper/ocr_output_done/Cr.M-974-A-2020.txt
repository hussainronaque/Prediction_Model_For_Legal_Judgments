Cr.M No.974-A/2020 in Cr.M (BA)No.884-A/2020

Present: Mr. Amir Sattar Tanoli, Advocate, for the
petitioner.

Sardar Muhammad Asif, AAG, for the State.

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J-. Applicant Mst. Safeena Shah
has moved this petition seeking therein permission to
deposit the surety amount Rs.200,000/- in cash.

2. The applicant is detained as an under trial
prisoner of offences under sections 302/109 PPC read
with section 15 AA KPK in crime No.1119 dated
03.08.2020 registered at PS City, Haripur. | had
admitted the applicant to bail on 12.10.2020, and
directed that she be released “subject to furnishing bail
bonds in the sum of Rs.200,000/- with two sureties in the
like amount to the satisfaction of //laqa/Duty Judicial
Magistrate, Haripur, who shall ensure that the sureties
are local, reliable and men of means.”

3. The learned AAG present in the Court in

some other case, was put on notice, has raised

objection that section 513 Cr.P.C does not authorize the
Court to demand cash security. He next contended that
the applicant may be allowed time to arrange local
surety.

4. I have carefully considered the
submissions of the learned AAG and have gone through
the relevant provision of law.

5. Learned AAG appears to be right to the
extent that section 513 Cr.P.C does not authorize a
Court to demand cash security, however, the same can
be permitted only if requested by the accused. The
words “permit him to deposit” used in Section 513
Cr.P.C, are not at all without significance and suggest of
a situation where something is permitted upon the
request of the accused but never ordered by the Court of
its own. The object of this section is to enable an
accused to deposit cash security in case he is unable to
find out sureties. Admittedly, the applicant does not
belong to District Haripur; she is a permanent resident of
Nai Abadi Moregah Rawalpindi, and does not seem to
have sufficient link at Haripur, therefore, she has prayed
for deposit of surety amount in cash. The request being
genuine, the prayer of the applicant is accepted, and
under section 513 C.P.C accused is permitted to deposit

the surety amount (Rs.200,000/-) in cash. She is hereby

directed to be released on bail provided she furnishes a
personal bond in a sum of Rs.200,000/- (two Lakh) with
bank guarantee to be furnished for the same amount to
the satisfaction of //laqga/Duty Judicial Magistrate,
Haripur.

Announced.
