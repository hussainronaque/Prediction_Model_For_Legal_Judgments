Sultan, and both of them got injured. Later on Sultan succumbed
to injuries.

3. Notice in this case was issued on 31.10.2017,
whereafter the case was fixed for arguments on 17.11.20 17, when
the learned counsel representing the respondent No.1 sought time
to further prepare his brief, therefore, adjournment was granted.
On 03.01.2018 case was again fixed for hearing when learned
counsel for respondent No.1 was available but respondent No.1
was not present and his learned counsel apprised the Court that
respondent No.1 had to go to Karachi on account of some
bereavement in the family and that he was on his way back. It was
requested that the case be adjourned for the next day, therefore,
the case was adjourned for 04.01.2018, but the respondent No.1
again absented himself on 04.01.2018, therefore, bailable warrants
were issued for procuring his attendance for 09.01.2018. The
respondent No.1 did not turn up on 09.01.2018-as well, therefore,
this Court was consttained to issue non-bailable warrants of arrest
of respondent No.1 for today and the SHO of the concerned police
station was ) directed ‘to execute the warrants and produce
respondent No.1 before this Court. Today, despite repeated calls,
neither the respondent No.1 nor his learned counsel has appeared.
The ASI/IO of Police Station, City Mardan is in attendance and has
also submitted a written report to the effect that despite his best
efforts, no clue of the respondent No.1 could ‘be traced and that
respondent No.1 has switched off his mobile phone and has

yabsconded. Learned counsel for the petitioner-complainant has

No. 566 of 2017 3

vehemently contended that respondent No.1 is nominated in the
FIR with specific role of firing at the complainant and Sultan
, deceased); that the offence alleged against respondent No.1
squarely falls within the prohibitory clause of section 497, Code of
Criminal Procedure; that earlier after registration of FIR, he
remained an absconder for considerable period of time, that the
learned High Court enlarged the respondent No.1 on bail without
considering the afore-referred facts and that even before this
Court, the respondent No.1 has willfully absented himself. The
learned State counsel has supported the contentions of learned
counsel for the petitioner.
3. Considering the afore-referred circumstances coupled
with the fact that respondent No.1 has not appeared before this
Court even after assurance given by his learned counsel, despite
issuance of non-bailable warrants of arrest issued against him, the
report of the police that he has again absconded, that even the
learned counsel representing him has also not appeared and the
fact that the case against the petitioner squarely falls within the
prohibitory clause of section 497, Code of Criminal Procedure, in
the circumstances of the case, the respondent No.1 was ‘not
entitled to the concession of bail.
4. For the foregoing, this petition is converted into an
appeal and the same is allowed. The impugned order of the learned
Peshawar High Court, Peshawar dated 15.05.2017 is set aside and
the bail granted to respondent No.1 is hereby cancelled. Since

y respondent No.1 is not present in person, therefore, we direct that
