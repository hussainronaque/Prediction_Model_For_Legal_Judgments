— as all the four (04) matters have emanated
from same judgment dated 07.02.2015 of the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-lil,
Haripur, delivered in case FIR No. 178 dated
15.04.2011 under Sections 302 / 452 / 109 /

34 PPC of Police Station Kot Najibullah
District Haripur, whereby appellant Rashid

Khan has been convicted under Section 302
(b) PPC and sentenced for imprisonment of
life with compensation of Rs.2,00,000/-,
payable to legal heirs of the deceased or in
default whereof to further suffer six (06)
months S.I. He has further been convicted
under Section 452 PPC and sentenced to
three (03) years nine (09) months and four
(04) days with fine of Rs. 20,000/- or in
default whereof to suffer three (03) months
S.l. Appellant Fareed Khan has been
convicted under Section 452 PPC and
sentenced to three (03) years nine (09)
months and four (04) days with a fine of
Rs.20,000/- or in default of payment of fine to
suffer further simple imprisonment of three
(03) months, however, he was acquitted of
the charge under Section 302 PPC. All the
sentences were ordered to run concurrently
with benefit under Section 382-B Cr.P.C.

2. Appellants have impugned their
convictions while the complainant has filed
appeal against the acquittal of accused

Fareed Khan from the charge of murder. He
has also filed criminal revision against
appellant Rashid Khan for enhancement of
the sentence awarded to him.

3. Brief facts of the case are that on
15.04.2011, complainant Muhammad Iqbal
(PW-6) reported to Sardar Jehangir Khan,
Inspector (PW-1) to the effect that on
14.04.2011, his son Khan Nawaz and
daughter-in-law Mst. Shazia, the newly
wedded couple, were asleep in their room
while he was asleep in the courtyard when at
Fajar Azan time, someone knocked at the
door of the groom’s room where he was
asleep, on which he i.e. the complainant
awoke and saw appellant Fareed Khan and
Rashid Khan present over there, duly armed.
According to the FIR, complainant enquired
from them the purpose of their presence. In
the meanwhile, his son came out of his room,
who was fired at by both the accused with
their pistols with which he was hit on his chest
and died on the spot. Motive for the offence

was stated to be some previous blood feud.
4. After arrest of the accused and
completion of the investigation, challan was
put in court, which indicted them, to which
they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
Prosecution in order to prove its case,
examined twelve (12) witnesses whereafter
statements of the accused were recorded
where they professed innocence. They also
produced evidence in their defense. The
learned trial court, after conclusion of the trial,
found the appellants guilty of the charges and
while recording their conviction, sentenced

them as mentioned above.

5. Arguments heard and record gone
through.
6. Perusal of the case record would

show that the prosecution has produced two
eyewitnesses in support of its charge but as
both the eyewitnesses are closely related to
the deceased, therefore, for the safe
dispensation of justice, their evidence will be
appreciated with great care and caution. No

doubt, evidence of a related witness cannot
be discarded on the ground of his being
related to the victim but if it is found that the
testimony of a related witness gets no
corroboration from attending circumstances of
the case or the conduct shown by him at the
time of occurrence or just thereafter is such
which cannot be expected from a prudent
person, then in such circumstance the
evidence furnished by a related witness can
be easily discarded.

7. On the touchstone of the above, we
now take into consideration the testimony
furnished by both the eyewitnesses in the
case. It reflects from the record that the
occurrence had taken place at Fajar Azan
Vela whereas same was reported to police by
the complainant at 08:30 a.m and that too at
the place of occurrence. Conduct of the
complainant by not shifting the dead body of
his son either to a hospital or the police
station suggests that at the time of
occurrence he was not present on the spot.

Had he been present on the spot at the time
of occurrence, he must have taken the dead
body either to a hospital or the police station
which admittedly he did not do. Assuming for
the sake of argument that personally he was
unable to take the deceased either to the
hospital or police station, he could have
deputed someone for that purpose. Waiting
for police on the spot with the dead body from
Fajar Azan Vela to 08:30 a.m for lodging
report is conduct of the complainant, which
ordinarily is not expected from a father.

8. Another important aspect of the case
is that according to FIR and prosecution
evidence, the complainant at the time of
occurrence was asleep in the courtyard of his
house whereas the occurrence had taken
place on 15.04.2011. In the month of April
people rarely sleep under the open sky and
that too in the Hazara Division. Above aspect
of the case also casts doubt on presence of
the complainant at the time of occurrence.
Though the complainant has advanced a

reason for his sleeping in the open sky that he
was a patient of asthma, but same is not
justifiable.

9. Not shifting the deceased to the
police station and letting it on the spot for
considerable period of time, waiting for arrival
of the police in his house, non-deputing
anyone to police station for report and
sleeping in the courtyard under the open sky
in the mid of April are some aspects of the
case which negate presence of the
complainant on the spot when the occurrence
had taken place. Therefore, his testimony
cannot be relied upon.

10. So far as presence of Mst. Shazia,
widow of the deceased, on the spot is
concerned, though according to the FIR and
her court statement she had come out of her
room at the time of occurrence and saw the
unfortunate event, but there is no material on
the record to show that prior to the
occurrence there had been any noise,
scuffling or any hue and cry in between the

deceased and his assailants which have
prompted her to leave her room and come on
the spot. Coming out of room by a bride by
following her groom in Suhaag Rat for no
justifiable reason is not appealable to a
prudent mind. Besides, the widow too did not
inform any member of the deceased family
about the occurrence in due course of time
and she also kept waiting till 08:30 a.m. Ibid
conduct of PW Mst. Shazia shows that the
occurrence did not take place the way it has
been reported.

11. Prosecution, in order to prove its
case against the appellant, has also relied
upon the crime empties recovered from the
spot and the two pistols taken into possession
on pointation of the appellants and the report
of FSL, according to which the crime empties
recovered from the spot did match with the
pistol recovered on the pointation of appellant
Rashid Khan but ibid recoveries are of no
help to the prosecution as both the pistols
were recovered from an open place which

was accessible to all and sundry. Besides,
both the pistols were recovered through a
joint recovery memo (Ex.PW-10/1) which fact
has eclipsed evidentiary worth of the
recoveries.

12. Thorough and careful examination of
the case record would show that the
prosecution has not proved its case through
any worth reliable and confidence inspiring
evidence. It is the cardinal principle of criminal
law that in order to bring home guilt to an
accused the prosecution must prove its case
through unimpeachable evidence and beyond
reasonable doubt which is not the case in
hand. The learned trial court has not
appreciated the case evidence in its true
perspective and has fallen in error to record
convictions of the appellants for which its
judgment is not sustainable in the eyes of law.
13. For what has been discussed above,
both the appeals filed by the convicts are
allowed, the impugned judgment is set aside
and consequently the appellants are acquitted

of the charges levelled against them. They be
10

set free from Jail, if not required in any other
case.
14. So far as criminal appeal and
criminal revision, filed by the complainant
against acquittal of appellant Fareed Khan
from the murder charge and for enhancement
of sentence of the appellant Rashid Khan
respectively, are concerned, suffice it to say
that as we have disbelieved the evidence,
adduced at the trial by the prosecution and
have set aside the judgment of conviction,
therefore, both the appeal and revision have
become infructuous and, as such, are hereby
dismissed.

Above are the detailed reasons of
our short orders of even date.
