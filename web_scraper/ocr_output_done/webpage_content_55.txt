Muhammad Ali Mazhar, J:            The
applicants have applied post arrest bail in Crime No. 27/2010, lodged at P.S
Golo Daro, District Shikarpur, under section 302, 364, 148, 149, 436, 452
P.P.C; Section 6 of Anti Terrorism Act, and 17 (3) Offences Against Property
(Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979.
 
            The bail application was moved
in the Anti Terrorism Court, Jacobabad, but vide order dated 02.02.2011, the
same was dismissed.
 
            The learned counsel for the
applicants argued that names of the applicants are not mentioned in the F.I.R,
but they have been nominated by way of supplementary statement recorded under
section 161 Cr.P.C. He further argued that there is at-least two days delay in
the F.I.R without any plausible explanation. The investigating officer in the
case has recorded the statements under section 161 Cr.P.C after lapse of
considerable time. He lastly contended that the case of present applicants
clearly falls within the phrase of further enquiry as envisaged under
subsection (2) of section 497 Cr.P.C, therefore, the applicants are entitled to
be released on bail. In support of his arguments, the learned counsel for the
applicants relied upon 2011 S.C.M.R 161 (Abid Ali V. The State); in which the
Hon’ble Supreme Court has held that bail cannot be withheld as punishment and
it was further held that even for the purposes of bail law is not to be
stretched in favor of the prosecution. The Hon’ble Supreme Court further went
on to hold that the name of petitioner is not mentioned in the F.I.R but his
name was included in the list of accused in the supplementary statement.  There
is no explanation available in this regard, therefore, the case of petitioner
falls under the category of further enquiry. It was further held that although
the challan has been submitted in the Court and the case was fixed for hearing
but still prima facie the case of the petitioner appears to be one of further
enquiry and is covered under the provisions of section 497 Cr.P.C, that he be
released on bail and practice of refusal of bail in such cases, where challan
is submitted should not be bar to refusal. 
 
            On the contrary, the learned
State counsel argued that at-least forty empties of different kind were
recovered from the place of incident. However, he conceded to that neither any
recovery was affected from the present applicants nor their names are appearing
in the F.I.R but they were implicated by way of supplementary statement.
 
            After hearing the arguments of
the learned counsel, we have reached to the conclusion that the names of the
applicants are not mentioned in the F.I.R and after lapse of at-least six
months, they were implicated by way of supplementary statement recorded under
section 161 Cr.P.C, which creates reasonable doubt and possibility of false
involvement of the applicants cannot be ruled out therefore, the case requires further
enquiry. The learned State counsel further conceded that in the statement
recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C no plausible explanation has been offered as
to why the applicants were not initially nominated in the F.I.R and what are
the reasons to implicate them after a long time in supplementary statement. We
are fortified by the dictum laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court (supra) that
bail cannot be withheld as punishment and even at the bail stage law is not to
be stretched in favor of the prosecution. In the similar circumstances, the
Hon’ble Supreme Court granted bail and we are also of the view that this is a
case of further enquiry, therefore, the applicants are granted bail subject to
furnishing solvent surety in the sum of Rs.300,000/- (Three hundred thousands)
each and P.R bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court.
