SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- The appellant Muhammad
Karim, through the instant criminal appeal, has assailed the
judgment dated 29.4.2019, rendered by learned Additional Sessions
Judge-II, Lakki Marwat, whereby the appellant was convicted
under section 302(b) P.P.C and sentenced to life imprisonment for
committing qatl-i-amd of deceased Sakhi Marjan, with
Rs.2,00,000/- (two lac), as compensation under section 544-A
Cr.P.C. to the legal heirs of deceased or in default thereof, to
undergo six months simple imprisonment. He was further convicted
under section 15 Arms Act and sentenced to three years rigorous
imprisonment with a fine of Rs.10,000/- or in default thereof, to
further suffer six months simple imprisonment. Benefit of section

382-B Cr.P.C was also extended to the convict.
2. Brief facts of the case, as divulged from the FIR, are
that on 05.02.2017 at 13:30 hours, complainant Gul Rehman
brought the dead-body of his brother Sakhi Marjan to City Hospital,
Lakki Marwat, where he reported the matter to the local police, to
the effect that on the eventful day, he alongwith his brother Sakhi
Marjan came to Lakki Bazaar for purchase of groceries, that after
purchase of groceries, when they reached at Adda Datson, near
Habib Bank when at about 12:55 hours, accused Muhammad Karim
and Jumma Khan sons of Muhammad Ali Khan, duly armed with
pistols suddenly emerged in the street and started firing upon the
complainant party with their respective weapons, with intention to
do away with them, resultantly, his brother Sakhi Marjan got hit
and fell down, while the complainant fortunately escaped unhurt.
After the occurrence, both the accused fled away. When the
complainant party attended the injured, by then he had succumbed
to his injuries. Motive for the occurrence was stated to be the blood-
feud between the parties, as some 29/30 years ago, father of the

appellant was killed, hence, the instant F.I.R.

3. After completion of necessary investigation,
prosecution submitted challan against the accused/appellant, while
co-accused Jumma Khan remained fugitive from law. At the
commencement of trial against the accused/appellant, prosecution

produced and examined as many as nine witnesses, whereafter,
-3-
statement of accused was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C,
wherein he professed innocence, however, he neither opted to be
examined on oath as provided under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor
produced evidence in his defence. After hearing arguments of
learned counsel for the parties, learned trial Court vide impugned
judgment 29.04.2019, convicted the appellant and sentenced him,
as mentioned in earlier part of the judgment, whereas the
absconding co-accused was declared as Proclaimed Offender,

hence, the instant appeal.

4. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant
alongwith learned A.A.G for the State at length and with their

valuable assistance, the record was gone through.

5. The gory incident claimed the life of deceased Sakhi
Marjan, leading to a charge against the appellant and his brother
namely Juma Khan. The incident was stated to be witnessed by the
complainant Gul Rehman. It is pertinent to mention that from the
fire shot alleged to the appellant and others, a passerby namely
Aziz-ur-Rehman also received an injury. The matter was reported
by the complainant to the local police at City Hospital Lakki. The
appellant was shown arrested on the day of incident and from his
personal possession a .30 pistol alongwith ammunitions were taken

into possession. The appellant faced the trial and was ultimately
-4-
convicted for the offences charged, vide the impugned judgment

dated 29.04.2019.

6. True, that the incident was witnessed by the
complainant, and that the accused/appellant was arrested on the day
of incident, but equally true, that mere arrest of the appellant and
recovery of the alleged weapon of offence will not serve the
purpose, rather the prosecution is under the bounded duty to
establish the involvement of an accused, that too, by producing
trustworthy and confidence inspiring evidence. The learned trial
Court dealt with the matter comprehensively and through a detailed
judgment awarded conviction to the appellant, but being the Court
of appeal, this Court is to see, as to whether the learned trial Court
fully appreciated the evidence and record on file; and as to whether
the witnesses succeeded in establishing their presence on the spot.
We cannot ignore that every criminal case is heinous in nature and
the people involved from both the sides are the worst sufferers,
waiting in return to the Courts of law to determine their fate. We
are conscious of the fact that in such like cases families are ruined,
especially, the one whose sole bread earners are killed. But let our
emotions should not be the masters to decide the miseries of the
wretched families, rather the Courts of law should apply its judicial
mind to the facts and circumstances of the case, so to avoid

miscarriage of justice. In case in hand, much is needed to unearth
.5. |

the truth and to remove the prevailing mystery, so to do justice with
the deserving. Though, the learned trial Court dealt with the matter
comprehensively, but we are still searching to dig out as to whether
the complainant was present at the time of incident and as to
i

whether he came forward with nothing, but the whole truth.

7. The incident occurred in a busy cattle fair, where the
complainant alongwith his deceased brother had come to purchase
household articles. The report tells that after purchasing the
household articles, they were supposed to leave for their house,
when the accused emerged from eastern side and started firing at
the complainant as well as the deceased, where the complainant
escaped unhurt, but the unfortunate deceased fell a prey. Not only
the deceased received firearm injuries, but also a passerby namcly
Aziz-ur-Rehman. The deceased was taken to the local hospital by
the complainant and the injured was shifted by the people who were
present near the place of incident. The matter was reported to the
local police in the City Hospital, Lakki at 13:30 hours, which was
penned down by one Ghulam Saboor Khan ASI, who also prepared
the injury sheets and inquest report of the deceased. After doing the
needful, the dead-body was sent to the mortuary where the autopsy
was conducted. It is pertinent to mention that while examining the
dead-body the doctor explained the time of arrival as 01:15 PM and

the time of examination of the dead-body as 02:00 PM. The
-6-
complainant was examined as PW-8, who stated that he alongwith
the deceased left their village for the cattle fair to purchase
household articles. He further stated that, after purchasing the same
they were leaving for their house when the accused emerged and
started firing at them. Though, the complainant posed himself to be
the sole eye-witness and that it was he who shifted the dead-body to
the hospital, but we are to see as to whether he has succeeded in
convincing the Court of law, in that respect. The complainant
admitted that there existed blood-feud between the parties, as some
29/30 years ago father of the appellant was killed Icading to a
charge against the complainant. The complainant is to tell that when
he was the singularly charged accused for the murder of father of
the assailants, then why the accused did not kill the complainant,
that too, when he was at their mercy, and that why the deceased was
targeted and killed, as the best needed target was available to them.
The record tells that it was the deceased who received the firearm
injuries and no injury was caused to the complainant, though the
complainant charged the accused for firing at him, but the same
proved ineffective. The interse distance between accused and the
complainant was so short, that had he been present and was fired at,
he would not have survived, but the circumstances tell otherwise.
The complainant is yet to explain that when the Investigating

Officer reached to the spot, why he did not produce the purchased
-7-
items. This is interesting to note that when the deceased received
fatal shot and fell to the ground even then the household articles
were in possession of the complainant, which were handed over to
one Yousaf Jan, belonging to his village. On one hand, the conduct
of the complainant was unnatural and on the other, if the said
Yousaf Jan was present at the time of incident, what precluded the
complainant to disclose his name to the Investigating Officer and
that why his name was not included in the calendar of witnesses.
The prosecution travelled with strange behaviour, despite the fact
the injured was available in the hospital at the time of report, but
was not asked to verify the report made by the complainant, that
too, in his presence. The presence of the complainant has put us in a
fix and it is important to search for circumstances that substantiate

his claim.

8. The complainant during Court statement, stated that
he hurriedly transported the dead-body of the deceased to the
hospital, knowing the fact that the deceased breathed his last on the
spot. When the complainant knew that the deceased had died, then
why the dead-body was not shifted to the local Police Station
situated at a distance of three furlong and that why the incident was
reported in the hospital. Another intriguing aspect of the case is that
the report was made to the scribe at 13:30 hours who thereafter.

prepared the injury sheet and inquest report, but the doctor
-8-
disclosed the time of arrival of the dead-body as 01:15 PM and the
time of postmortem as 02:00 PM. When the dead-body was present
before the doctor at 01:15 PM, then how the report was made at
13:30 hours and that why the doctor did not conduct the
postmortem examination soon after the dead-body was produced
before him. The delay caused gives an inference that all waited for
arrival of the complainant, whose village is situated at a distance of
one hour travel. The overall circumstances strengthen our belief
that after receiving the firearm injuries the deceased was shifted by
the people to the hospital, as the complainant was not available at
the time of incident. This fact is further corroborated by the fact,

that in his report, the complainant specified the weapon of offence

as pistol, whereas in the inquest report the word “e*T #41" has been

used. Had the report been made in the mode and manner, then the
scribe instead using the word “firearm” would have used the word
“pistol” and the complainant would also figure in the columns of

identification of both the inquest and postmortem reports.

9. The Investigating Officer after getting copy of the
F.LR, reached to the spot recovered blood-stained earth alongwith
four empties of .30 bore from the place of incident. The site plan
was prepared on pointation of the complainant. The Investigating

Officer was examined as PW-9, who stated that on receiving copy
-9-
of F.I.R, he reached to the place of occurrence, effected recoveries
and prepared the site plan, but this witness did not make efforts to
record statements of the nearby shopkeepers and even he did not
mention the Datson Adda, where the complainant was supposed to
go. The Investigating Officer did not inquire the whereabouts of
one Yousaf Jan, who was stated by the complainant, to have
witnessed the occurrence. The Investigating Officer collected four
empties of .30 bore, where three out of four, matched with the
recovered pistol and the one did not. Keeping in view the
dimensions of the injuries and recoveries of empties from the spot
the possibility cannot be excluded that it was the doing of one
person. The complainant when appeared before the trial Court,
stated that while present on the spot with the Investigating Officer,
Ghulam Saboor Khan ASI alongwith police officials brought the
accused and in his presence .30 bore pistol alongwith ammunitions
were recovered from the accused by the Investigating Officer,
whereas Ghulam Saboor Khan ASI, during his Court statement,
stated that the appellant was arrested a little away from the Police
Station and that it was he who recovered the pistol alongwith

ammunitions from his persona! possession.

10. Much was said regarding spot arrest and recovery of
the weapon of offence from personal possession of the appellant,

but the prosecution is still to establish the mode, manner and time
-10-
of arrest of the appellant. Ghulam Saboor Khan ASI was examined
as PW-7, who stated that after dispatching the dead-body to the
doctor for postmortem examination, he went in search of the
accused/appellant and that it was at a distance of one furlong from
the Police Station that the accused was arrested. He further stated
that at the time of arrest, he recovered .30 bore pistol alongwith
fitted magazine containing live rounds, but while preparing the card
of arrest he did not mention the recoveries effected from personal
possession of the appellant. The prosecution is to tell as to whether
it was PW-7, who arrested the accused and effected recoveries from
his personal possession or, that it was the Investigating Officer who
recovered the pistol alongwith ammunitions. Both the witnesses i.e.
PW-7 & PW-9 did not support each other the way the recoveries
were effected and the situation was further deteriorated by the
complainant, when he stated that the Investigating Officer
recovered the weapon of offence from personal possession of the
accused in his presence. The conflict amongst the three spoiled the
validity of this piece of evidence. Another aspect of the case is that
soon after its alleged recovery, the pistol being the weapon of
offence was not sealed into parcel and the possibility cannot
excluded of its having been tempered. This is surprising to note that
the Investigating Officer did not record statements of the concerned

police officials to establish its safe custody. We cannot deny the
-ll-
fact that the weapon was allegedly taken into possession on the day
of incident but the same was received by the Forensic Sciences
Laboratory on 06.03.2017, with a considerable delay of more than
one month and that the prosecution failed to explain that where
such important piece of evidence was lying in the intervening
period. The prosecution could not explain the safe custody and its
delayed sending to the laboratory. More interestingly, neither the
statement of the police official in whose custody the said was lying,
nor the statement of the concerned police official who took the
same to the Forensic Sciences Laboratory, were recorded. The
matter does not end here rather the prosecution is to prove the
manner in which the appellant was arrested, what a surprising
episode this is, that knowing the fact that he had killed the
deceased, the appellant was still roaming around the concerned
Police Station, that too, the weapon of offence in possession. It is
hard to believe that right from the time of occurrence i.e. 12:55 PM,
the convict/appellant was waiting the local police till 02:45 PM, to
arrest him, despite having the opportunity to escape. The overall
situation portrayed above, leaves no room to doubt that the
appellant was not arrested at the stated time and in the given
manner. When ‘such is the state of affairs, then the recoveries
effected and its matching report hold no ground and is not worth

consideration. The prosecution failed to establish this valuable
-12-
piece of evidence against the appellant and as such, the same is

taken out of consideration.

In case titled Hayat Ullah Vs. The State (2018

SCMR 2092), it was held that:-

“Much reliance was placed on the recovery of
pistol from the appellant and empty from the
place of occurrence, we observe that the
empty was recovered on 11.02.2006 and pistol
was recovered on 22.02.2006 and till the
recovery of the pistol the empty was not sent
to the firearm expert and the empty and the
pistol both remained together in the
Malkhana and thereafter transmitted to the
office of the Forensic Science Laboratory. So
the recovery is inconsequential. Even
otherwise recovery alone is not sufficient for
conviction and it is always termed as a
corroborative piece of evidence. It is settled
law that one tainted piece of evidence can't
corroborate another tainted piece of
evidence.”

11. To know, as to whether the incident occurred in the
mode and manner, it is essential to see the seat of injuries, the
presence of the deceased and the places wherefrom the accused
fired. The complainant in his Court statement stated that after
purchasing the house hold articles they were proceeding towards
the Datson Adda situated near Habib Bank Ltd. The site plan

depicts that while moving towards Adda from point of the

complainant and deceased, one must face the east and in that

i
‘

eventuality, the deceased must receive firearm entry wounds on his

front with its exit on his back, but the medical evidence does not
-13-
support the case of the prosecution. No doubt, medical evidence is
confirmatory in nature and it cannot outweigh the ocular account,
provided the ocular account is confidence inspiring. In case where a
witness fails to establish his presence on the spot then, in that
situation resort can be made to the medical evidence, and in that
eventuality it is the medical evidence that steers the wheel. As in
the instant case, the complainant could not convince us regarding
his presence on the spot when the deceased was done to death, then
we cannot ignore the conflict between the medical and ocular
account. The conflict between the two has damaged the prosecution
case beyond repair. Reference may be made to case law reported as
2011 SCMR 323 ‘Amin Ali and quoter Vs. The State and 2019

SCMR 1306 ‘Mansab Ali Vs. the State’.

12. Despite the fact, the prosecution had two important
witnesses in its armory but with no plausible explanation is given
that why they were not produced. The-injured Aziz-ur-Rehman was
one of the most important witness, that too, with stamp of injurics
on his person, but neither he was produced before the trial Court
nor the need was felt to verify the report of the complainant from
him. The Investigating Officer did not mention the reasons which
stopped him from producing the injured witness before the Trial
Court. We cannot ignore the statement of the complainant, when he

introduced the presence of one Yousaf Jan at the time of incident
-14-
but, he too was not produced before the Investigating Officer to
record his statement regarding the incident. Law is settled that when
the best available evidence is not produced, then inference must
always and always be drawn against the prosecution, that had he
been produced, he would not have supported the false claim of the
complainant. Article 129(g) of the ‘Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984,
caters for the situation, as is held in case titled Tahir Khan Vs. The

State (2011 SCMR 646), wherein it is held that:

“13. In the present case as observed above,
the clouds over the veracity of the prosecution
version began hovering with the substitution
of the initially nominated persons in the
F.LR. and also that complainant did not
appear as a witness. It assumes relevance as
he (Ghulam Hussain), Sultan Mehmood and
Ghulam Abbas were given up by the
prosecution and not produced. The only
possible conclusion is that the prosecution
sensed the risk of producing them that they
might not support the said version. Their
production thus was withheld leaving doubts

spreading all around”.
13, The cumulative effect of what has been discussed
above, bring this Court to an inescapable conclusion that the
prosecution did not succeed in bringing home guilt against the
appellant. The impugned judgement is suffering from inherent

defects and the learned Trial Court did not appreciate the available
-15-
record in its true perspective, the same calls for interference.
Resultantly, the instant criminal appeal is allowed, the conviction
and sentence of the appellant recorded by the learned ‘Trial Court
are set-aside and he is acquitted of the charges by extending him the
benefit of doubt, he shall be released forthwith from jail, if not

required to be detained in connection with any other criminal case.

14. Above are the detailed reasons of our short of even
date.
