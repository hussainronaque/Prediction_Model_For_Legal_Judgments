Malik Akhtar Nawaz, Advocates.

Respondent No.4 by --- M/s Jamal Khan Afridi & Shams

LAL JAN KHATTAK, J:- Petitioner Zeeshan
Ahmad Khan has applied to this court for
issuance of a writ declaring him eligible for
his appointment against one of the 03 PMS
Officer post (the post) reserved for the
disabled persons per recommendations of
the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Public Service
Commission as notified on 13.02.2020. He
has also solicited for a writ to declare as
illegal and unlawful the recommendations of
the Commission regarding appointment of

the respondent No.4 as a PMS Officer
against the post because neither he had
applied for it on the ground of his disability
nor even had _ produced his_ disability
certificate before the Commission at the time
of his interview.

2. Brief facts of the case are that
pursuant to the advertisement splashed in
the national dailies, petitioner, hailing from
Zone-04, applied for his appointment against
the post. He appeared in the prescribed
selection process and was_ provisionally
recommended per tentative notice issued by
the Commission on 13.02.2002 by securing
over all 785 merit position. His grievance
started when an application was submitted
by the respondent No.4 to the respondent
No.1 for his inclusion in the merit position in
view of his higher merit position in
consequence whereof provisional
recommendations of the petitioner was
withheld and ultimately his name was
dropped from the merit list and instead the
respondent No.4 was recommended for the
post. Being aggrieved from the above,

petitioner has filed the instant petition.
3. Arguments heard and record gone
through.
4. No doubt, on 13.02.2020, the

petitioner was provisionally recommended by
the Commission for his appointment against
the post but the recommendation ibid did not
confer on him any vested right as not only
same was provisional in nature but was
subject to cancellation in case any error or
discrepancy was found therein.

5. In support of cancellation of the
petitioner’s recommendation, the
Commission’s point of view is _ that
undoubtedly the respondent No.4 _ had
applied for his appointment against the post
for his being a disabled person and had
annexed with his application, an earlier
disability certificate dated 23.04.2014 issued
by a Standing Medical Board on the basis of
which he was provisionally interviewed on
30.01.2020 with a condition to produce
disability certificate issued by the Provincial
Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled

Persons (PCRDP) on or before the closing
date of the interview which he did produce
before the target date i.e. 11.02.2020.

6. Not only the respondent No.4
produced his disability certificate prior to the
closing date of interview but another
noticeable aspect of the case is that he had
appeared before the Provincial Council for
Rehabilitation of Disabled Persons on
15.01.2020 i.e. much before the target date,
and on same date he was examined by the
Council and found him disabled for his being
blind by one eye. True that on 30.01.2020,
when the respondent No.4 was provisionally
interviewed by the Commission, he was
holding a_ disability certificate dated
23.04.2014 issued to him by a Standing
Medical Board but as on 15.01.2020 the
PCRDP had examined him and had declared
him as a disabled person on same day,
therefore, mere production of the disability
certificate on 11.02.2020 by the respondent
before the Commission would not go to his
detriment as it is well settled that no one
shall suffer for the in action and lethargic

attitude of the others. Had the respondent
been not examined by the PCRDP on
15.01.2020 or before his interview i.e.
30.01.2020, then the situation for him of
course would have been different which is
not the case.

7. As the respondent No.4 otherwise
has got higher merit position than the
petitioner and his disability has undoubtedly
been confirmed by the Provincial Council for
Rehabilitation of Disabled Persons through
its certificate, therefore, the Commission was
well within its competence to drop the
petitioner's name from the provisional merit
list and recommend the respondent No.4 for
his appointment against the post in which we
do not see any illegality.

8. For what has been discussed above,
this petition, being bereft of any merit, is

hereby dismissed.
