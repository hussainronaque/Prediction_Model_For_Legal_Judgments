Accused-petitioner, Noor Zaman, secks his post arrest

sections 324/34 of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 and
section 15 AA, KPK, registered at Police Station
Banna Allai, District Battagram.

2. The allegation against the accused-
petitioner, as reveals from the report of Mahrifatullah,
complainant is that he alongwith his co-accused Gul
Zaman attempted at his life as well as life of his son

waseem on 23.03.2018 at 03.30 hours in their house
o)

situated in village Pashkal Nehr, within the criminal
jurisdiction of Police Station Banna Allai, Battagram,
by firing at them.

Arguments of the learned counsel for the

U2

partics heard and the record perused with their
valuable assistance.

4, No doubt, the present accused/petitioner
has been directly charged in the present case for firing
at the complainant, however, record of the case
reveals that co-accused Gul Zaman has been released
on bail by this Court vide order dated 23.07.2018.
‘The prosecution has not explained the delay of about
two and half hours in lodging the F.LR. ‘The
complainant in his report clearly mentioned the names
of two persons t.c. the present accused/petitioner and
his co-accused Gul Zaman for commission of offence,
however, later on, he disclosed the name of Zaman
son Nazir and charged him being co-accused, in his
supplementary statement recorded on 05.04.2018,
after twelve days of the occurrence. As observed by
this Court, while allowing bail petition of co-accused,
that statement of injured Waseem was also recorded
after twelve days of the occurrence, on 05.04.2018 but
no explanation has been given for such delay. It was

night occurrence and no source of light has been
ws

mentioned by the complainant. The Medical officer
also found blackening around the wounds, which
could not be possible from a distance of 10 fect, as
shown by the 1.0. in the site plan between point No.|
and 5. The ‘kalashinkov’ was not recovered on the
pointation of accused, rather it was shown to have
been recovered from the house of accused/petitioner
aficr cighteen days of occurrence and separate casc
was registered vide F.I.R No.60 dated 10.04.2018,
thus, the evidentiary value of the said recovery and
positive report of Firearms Expert would be
determined by the learned trial Court after recording
evidence of the prosecution. Moreover, — the
investigation in the case is complete and_ the
accused/petitioner is no more required to the police or
prosecution for further investigation. In view of
peculiar facts and circumstances, the case of the
accused/petilioner, prima facie, becomes that of
‘further inquiry’, aS envisaged in section 497 (2)

Cr.P.C.

Ww

The observations rendered hereinabove,
are tentative in nature and it would not prejudice the
mind of the trial Court in any manner whatsoever,

during trial of the case.
6. Consequently, this bail application as
well as Cr.M No.915-A/2015, filed by the accused/
petitioner for addition of section 15 AA KPK, are
accepted, accused-petitioner is admitted to bail in the
above offences, subject to his furnishing bail bonds in
