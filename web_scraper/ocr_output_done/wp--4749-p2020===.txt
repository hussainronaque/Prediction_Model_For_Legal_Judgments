2. The petitioners have prayed for the following
relief:-

“It is, therefore, humbly prayed that on acceptance of
this petition, this Hon’ble Court may graciously be
pleased to:-

(i) Declare the acts and omissions of respondents
and the impugned decisions/recommendations
of respondent No.3 (Departmental Committee)
and instructions contained in Para 3(a) & (b) of
the letter dated 31.08.2020 of respondent No.1
as unlawful, without lawful authority, of no
legal effect, inoperative against the rights of
petitioners, unfair, unjust, malafide,
discriminatory and violative of the fundamentals
rights of petitioners.

(ii) Direct the respondents to act in the matter in
accordance with law and treat the petitioners
equally and at par with the other similar placed
employees and re-designate their posts as
Computer Operator with upgradation to BPS-16
as done in the case of other similar placed
employees under similar circumstances vide
Notification dated 11.10.2018.

(iii) Restrain the respondents No.2 from acting upon
the instructions of respondent No.1 contained in
Para 3(a) & (b) of letter dated 31.08.2020 and
the subsequent recommendations of the
Departmental Committee (respondent No.3) in
the interest of justice.

(iv) Any other relief as deemed appropriate in the
circumstances of the case not specifically asked

for may also be granted to the petitioners”.

3. In essence, petitioners are serving as
Constables/Computer Operators (BPS-05) and Head
Constables (BPS-07) in the respondent-Department, who

have earlier approached this Court by filing writ petition
SS

Page 3 of 10

seeking therein upgradation of their posts to BPS-16 on the
analogy that other similar placed employees of the same
Department were allowed BPS-16. The said writ petition
was disposed of by this Court and direction was issued to
the respondents to decide their pending appeal/
representation within reasonable time. In compliance of the
order of this Court, a Departmental Committee was
constituted by the respondents and the Committee, in its
meeting held on 22.09.2020, regretted the case of the
petitioners. Being aggrieved, they filed the instant and
connected petitions.

4. Comments were called from the respondents
who furnished the same, wherein, they opposed the issuance
of desired writ asked for by the petitioners.

5. Arguments heard and record perused.

6. Perusal of the record reveals that petitioners
were initially appointed against the posts of Constables/
Computer Operators. In terms of the record provided, they
are holding either Master or Bachelor Degrees alongwith
Diploma in Computer. They were, however, placed in BPS-
05/07. The event, which necessitated them to request for
their upgradation, happens when vide Notification dated
29.07.2016, all the Computer Operators serving in the
Provincial Government Departments in BPS-12 were
allowed upgradation to BPS-16. Moreover, similar placed

Constables/Computer Operators were also recommended by
Page 4 of 10

the respondents/Departments which were placed before the
Upgradation Committee and the said Committee, in its
meeting held on 06.08.2018, recommended them for their
upgradation to BPS-16. The recommendations were duly
forwarded vide letter dated 04.09.2018 by the Government
of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Finance Department (Regulation
Wing). Relevant para of the minutes of the Upgradation
Committee is reproduced as under:-

“After threadbare discussion and deliberation, the
Committee agreed with consensus to recommend that the
post of Constable, Computer Operators, Head Constable,
Computer Operator, ASI Computer Operator, SI
Computer Operator and Inspector Computer Operator in
Police Department may be re-designated as Computer
Operator against the sanctioned posts and upgrade to
BPS-16 at par with the others of the same cadre. However,
it was added that no back benefits or arrear would be

claimed in this regard”.

7. Pursuant to the recommendations of the
Upgradation Committee and Finance Department’s letter
above referred, 83 posts of Executive Computer Staff were
re-designated as Computer Operators and upgraded to BPS-
16 vide Notification dated 11.10.2018.

8. Petitioners though similarly placed; albeit,
neither their case was forwarded for upgradation/re-
designation nor they were allowed the upgraded pay scale.
Accordingly, they agitated departmental and thereafter, filed
Writ Petition bearing No.2697-P/2019 before this Court,

which was disposed of vide order dated 19.11.2019 with

direction to the respondent-Department to decide their
application/representation within a reasonable time.
Interestingly, instead of forwarding the case of the
petitioners for similar treatment to the Upgradation
Committee of the Provincial Government, their case was
placed before a Committee consisting of senior Officers of
the Police Department. The Committee has completely
discarded their request on flimsy grounds and has failed to
distinguish cases of those officials who were allowed
upgradation. Para 3(iv) of the minutes of the meeting held
on 22.09.2020, being relevant, is reproduced as under:-

“iv. 83-Offiicals of Police Department already absorbed
in IT Cadre have been done under compulsory
circumstances, which was not an ideal keeping in view
the zonal allocation given and relevant experience. They

are also simply matriculate and graduate etc”.

9. Similarly, in order to get rid of the petitioners
that they may not claim upgradation in future, further
direction was issued. Para 4 of the minutes of the meeting,
being relevant, is reproduced as under:-

“4, Letter received from the Section Officer (Budget),
Home & Tribal Affairs Department vide
No.SO(Budget)/HE/5-20/2014 dated 31.08.2020 has also
been discussed, instructions contained in Para-3 (a) &
(b) of the said letter are reproduced:

a) First repatriate all the police constables who are
working as Computer Operator in Police Department to
their executive field duties so as to avoid further
litigation. Or

b) Take an affidavit from those police constables
who are working on computers that they will not claim
the post of Computer Operators as well as other benefits
of the post of Computer Operator”.

10.

Provincial Government notified vide Notification bearing
No.SO(FR)/I-D/7-2/2008 dated 11.10.2010, every effort is
to be made to bring at par identical post in same pay scale in

juxtaposition with other Departments/Autonomous Bodies.

Page 6 of 10

In terms of the Upgradation Policy of the

Para-III, being relevant, is reproduced as under:-

“Upgradation to Posts proposed on grounds of Principle
of Parity:-

While processing the cases where the proponent

department seeks upgradation of certain posts to a

higher pay scale on the analogy of similar posts in some

other department in this province created with same

nomenclature, the Committee shall take into account

following parameters:

)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

Ascertainment of full details about all such
posts created with same nomenclature by any
department in addition to those Departments
whose analogy has been quoted by proponent
department.

Nomenclature shall not be sole criterion for
determining parity/comparability of post(s).
Other details i.e. the job description and
prescribed qualification would necessarily be
examined,

In case of difference of prescribed qualification
or the job description (or both) as the case may
be, the committee may direct the change of
nomenclature of post(s) in any departments to
avoid confusion on this ground.

The committee may associate with all such
departments having same nomenclature of
certain post(s) with same responsibilities and
Same qualifications to ascertain as to what were
reasons for creation of same posts in different
departments with different pay scales and thus
made recommendations in respect of all such

posts in all concerned departments, whether

Page 7 of 10

they took up the case or otherwise, to bring
uniformity in pay scales in all departments to
avoid future references.

Provided that the committee shall not
recommend such proposals for uniformity where
prescribed qualifications as well as the
qualifications possessed by existing incumbents
is not at par with the posts(s)/incumbents cited as
precedence.

Provided further that in such cases the
committee may recommend change of
nomenclature of either those post(s) having
higher prescribed qualifications or those having
lesser prescribed qualifications as may be deemed

appropriate by the committee”.
11. Similarly, Article 38(e) of the Constitution of
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 provides “the State shall
reduce disparity in the income and earnings of individuals,
including persons in the various classes of the service of
Pakistan”.

12. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the

case titled “A. Sharwani_and_others Vs. Government of
Pakistan through Secretary, Finance Division, Islamabad and
others (1991 SCMR_1041)”, while commenting upon the

cases where discrimination can be ascertained, has
observed, as under:-

“Following are the principles with regard to equal
protection of law and reasonableness of classification:-
(i) that equal protection of law does not envisage
that every citizen is to be treated alike in all
circumstances, but it contemplates that persons
similarly situated or similarly placed are to be
treated alike;
(ii) that reasonable classification is permissible but it
must be founded on reasonable distinction or

—

reasonable basis;
Page 8 of 10

(iii) that different laws can validly be enacted for

different sexes, persons in different age groups,

persons having different financial standings, and
persons accused of heinous crimes;

that no standard of universal application to test

reasonableness of a classification can be laid

down as what may be reasonable classification in

a particular set of circumstances may be

unreasonable in the other set of circumstances;

(v) that a law applying to one person or one class of
persons may be constitutionally valid if there is
sufficient basis or reason for it, but a
classification which is arbitrary and is not
founded on any rational basis is no classification
as to warrant its exclusion .from the mischief of
Article 25;

(vi) that equal protection of law means that all
persons equally placed be treated alike both in
privileges conferred and liabilities imposed;

(vii) that in order to make a classification reasonable,
it should be based-

(a) on an _ intelligible differentia which
distinguishes persons or things that are
grouped together from those who have
been left out;

(b) that the differentia must have rational
nexus to the object sought to be achieved by
such classification”.

(iv

~~

13. Admittedly, petitioners are discriminated in the
matter of grant of upgradation, because, _ their
counterparts/colleagues, performing same duties with the
same designations, were allowed upgradation to BPS-16.
Even minutes of the Upgradation Committee do not speak
or refer to their respective computer related qualifications
and merely relied upon their designation as Computer
Operators/Constables while the petitioners are holding the
prescribed qualifications ever since their appointments. As
referred to above in the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme
Court of Pakistan in the case of LA. Sharwani, we find that

the principle of equal protection of law is applicable to the

Page 9 of 10

case of petitioners. It is the fundamental right of the
petitioners that they being equally placed, treated alike and
that no intelligible differentia can distinguish the petitioners
from those who are allowed upgradation.

14. This case was first heard on 29.03.2022 and the
learned AAG, representing the respondents, was allowed
time to confirm and provide any record, whereby, it can be
ascertained that there was any difference in their
appointments and nature of jobs in juxtaposition to those
who were upgraded to BPS-16. Today, again when this case
was taken up for hearing, the learned AAG frankly
conceded that on factual plain, the case of the petitioners is
fit on all fours to those Computer Operators/Constables who
are allowed upgradation. He, however, stated that the said
upgradation was not proper and that those officials should
not have been upgraded.

15. Such plea of the learned AAG cannot be
accepted at this stage as it was heartburning amongst the
similar placed Computer Operators/Constables who are left
out while their colleagues, having similar posts, were
allowed upgradation. During the course of hearing,
reference was made to the judgment of this Court passed in
W.P. No.1007-M/2018 decided on 17.09.2019, whereby,
identical matter has been decided. The case of the
petitioners is also on the same footing. We, thus, find that

the rejection of the case of the petitioners by the Inter-

Page 10 of 10

Departmental Committee is not according to the
upgradation policy of the Provincial Government notified
vide Notification dated 11.10.2010, the main aim of which
is to make every effort to bring at par identical posts in
same pay scale in juxtaposition with other Departments/
Autonomous Bodies, while in the instant case, the
discrimination is meted out to the similar placed employees
in the same Department.

16. In view of the above and while relying upon the
judgment of this Court passed in W.P. No.1007-M/2018
decided on 17.09.2019, we direct the respondents to place
the case of the petitioners before the Upgradation
Committee of the Provincial Government in terms of the
Upgradation Policy and to consider their cases for re-
designation and upgradation to BPS-16 in juxtaposition
with their earlier decision unanimously passed in its
meeting held on 06.08.2018.

17, This and the connected writ petitions are

allowed in the above terms.
