JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.-

My this common judgment shall dispose of

the instant bail petition filed by petitioner

Abdul Wahab and connected Cr.Misc.BA

1459-P/2015, filed by Mst. Noreen and

Cr.Misc.BA No.1460-P/2015, filed by

petitioner Mubarak Shah, as all the three are

the outcome of one and the same FIR

No.1040 dated 04.08.2015, registered under

sections 371-B, 371-B and 294 PPC in Police

Station Hayat Abad.

2. As per contents of First Information

Report, Fida Muhammad SI, on receipt of

public complainants from the last so many

days qua involvement of Mst. Robina and

Mubarak Shah in the detestable affairs of

running a brothel house, he alongwith other

police officials, raid their house on spy

information. Inside the house both the above

named accused were allegedly found present.

Besides, from in a room of the house, a

young boy with a woman who disclosed their

names as Abdul Wahab and Mst. Noreen,

were found in a compromising position and

were preparing for sexual intercourse.

2. Arguments heard and record perused.

3. On perusal of the record, I did not

find any written complaint from the public or

any oral statement of any independent person

of the locality, recorded by _ the

complainant/SI to support his version.

Nobody from the locality has been associated

with the alleged raid proceedings despite

prior complaints and spy information, so

much so that neither owner of the house has

been examined nor any evidence has been

collected as to the ownership of the house in

question. Similarly, none from surrounding

houses has been examined by _ the

complainant/SI in support of his version. No

material evidence has been collected during

investigation to show that petitioners are

involved in buying and selling person for the

purpose of prostitution, therefore, in the

circumstances, application of section 371-A

and 371-B PPC is a matter which requires

further probe. Provisions of Ss 371-A and

371-B PPC only apply to persons who sell or

purchase any person with the intent that such

person would be used for the purpose of

prostitution or illicit intercourse. When

learned AAG was asked about any evidence

collected during investigation to fulfill the

ingredients of the above two offence, he

fairly and frankly conceded that no such

evidence has been collected so far. Besides,

neither any search warrant has been obtained

nor any note-able of the locality has been

associated with the alleged raid proceedings,

therefore, in the circumstance the alleged raid

cannot be termed any better than an

intrusion, which is an act prohibited by the

Constitution, law and the Holy Quran. The

Legislature in their wisdom, having rergad to

the existing norms of the society, were

conscious of the fact that if cases under such

offences are permitted to be registered on spy

information or on the complaints lodged by

anonymous persons, such practice would

have encouraged false reports involving

innocent men or women for ill designs.

5. For the reasons discussed above, I am

inclined to exercise the discretion of bail in

favour of the petitioners. Accordingly, all

the three petitions are allowed.

Accused/petitioners are admitted to bail

provided each one of them furnishes bail

bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two

sureties each in the like amount to the

satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial

Magistrate/MOD, concerned. The sureties

must be local, reliable and men of means.
