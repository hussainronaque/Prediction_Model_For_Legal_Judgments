ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN_ KHAN, J:- By invoking the
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199
of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973,
(Constitution), accused-petitioner Arshad Khan _ Ex-
Director General FATA Disaster Management Authority
(FDMA), who is behind the bars since 02.04.2015 in NAB
Reference for corruption and corrupt practices under
section 9 (a) National Accountability Ordinance, 1999
(Ordinance) and schedule thereto and whose plea for bail
on merit has already been turned down by this Court vide
order dated 17.06.2015 in W.P. No.1442-P/2015, seeks his
release on bail on fresh ground of delay in conclusion of
his trial. Allegations against him are that he being the
Director General (FDMA), in connivance with crony
accused by misusing his authority, engineered/processed/
gave approval and forwarded fake and bogus claims of 161

persons and thereby misappropriated/ embezzled colossal
2
loss of Rs.59600000/- to FDMA rehabilitation grants

which was to be distributed as compensation amongst
affectees for the damage caused to their houses due to
security operations in Mohmand Agency.

2. Learned counsel for the petitioner argued
that petitioner is languishing in Jail since his arrest on
02.04.2015 till date, but in spite of mandate of section 16-
A of the Ordinance, 1999, his trial has not been concluded
so far; that after dismissal of his plea for bail on merits by
this Court vide order dated 17.06.2015, in W.P. No.1442-
P/2015, petitioner approached the Hon’ble apex Court by
filing C.P. No.1418 of 2015, which was dismissed on the
commitment of Senior Prosecutor NAB that trial shall be
concluded within 90 days; that in the meantime, in utter
shock and dismay of the petitioner, another warrant of
arrest was issued against him in another reference, split up
from the same offence, therefore, petitioner filed W.P.
No.3075-P/2015 before this Court for joinder of charges in
both the references and asked for stay of proceedings
before the learned Trial Court in the reference till the
disposal of the writ petition. Through interim order dated
0.09.2015, the proceedings were stayed in the reference till
10.12.2015, when the writ petition was ultimately allowed
and both the references were ordered to be
tried jointly. Learned counsel contended that though

some progress was made in the trial of the petitioner but
3
joinder of the charges took the matter to denovo trial and

now after framing fresh charge, only one PW out of 99
witnesses of the two reference, has been examined and the
remaining are yet to be examined which will take further
indefinite period of time keeping in view the lethargic
conduct of the prosecution. He submitted that speedy trial
is the right of every accused and petitioner cannot be
detained in jail for indefinite period at the whims and
wishes of the prosecution. He lastly submitted that keeping
in view the above facts and circumstances, it is a hardship
case which entitles the petitioner for bail.

3. Conversely, learned ADPG for NAB
contended that petitioner cannot claim bail as a right on
statutory ground as the provisions of section 497 Cr.P.C.
are not applicable for the purpose of grant of bail to an
accused facing charges under the Ordinance, except in
hardship cases; that petitioner has failed to make out a
hardship case as the delay caused in the trial is by his own
conduct, who approached this Court for bail on merit, then
the august apex Court on merits, and then again this Court
for joinder of the charges by filing writ petitions; that he
stayed the proceedings reference and caused delay in
conclusion of trial, hence, he is not entitled to concession

of bail.

4. We have heard the exhaustive arguments of

learned counsel for the parties and perused the record with
their able assistance.

5. Since the plea of bail on merit has already
been turned down by this Court, therefore, there is no need
to re-dilate upon the merits of the case. So far as the
question of delay in conclusion of trial is concerned it is
true that the provisions of Section 497 Cr.P.C. are not
applicable for grant of bail to accused persons facing
charges in cases under the Ordinance, but as held by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in cases titled “Hamish Khan Vs
the NAB Lahore and others” (2015 SCMR 1092),
“Muhammad Jameel Rahi Vs DG NAB and others
(2012 SCMR 552), “Muhammad Nadeem Anwar Vs
NAB” (PLD 2008 Supreme Court of Pakistan 645), and
“Anwar ul Haq Qureshi Vs National Accountability
Bureau (2008 SCMR 1135), the boarder principle of
section 497 Cr.P.C. can be pressed into service in hardship
cases to provide relief to a deserving accused person
incarcerating in Jail for a shockingly long period.

6. Taking the case in hand at the touchstone
of the principle laid down by the august apex Court in
the cases (supra), the only question for determination
before us would be as to whether the case of the
petitioner falls within the ambit of “hardship cases”?

Though, “hardship cases” has not been specifically
5
defined by the apex Court, however, from the crux of

the judgments referred above, a hardship case can be
termed a case of shocking delay on the part of the
prosecution in conclusion of trial. A look over the
record would show that the petitioner was arrested on
02.04.2015 and reference against him was filed on
22.07.2015. During interregnum, he approached this
Court through WP No.1442-P/2015 for his release on
bail on merit, but his request was turned down on
17.06.2015. He then rushed to the Hon’ble Apex Court
through CP No.1418 for the same relief, where his
application was dismissed on the commitment of the
Senior Prosecutor NAB that trial of the petitioner shall
be concluded within 90 days. In the meantime, another
reference was initiated by the NAB against the
petitioner regarding accumulation of assets in which
warrant of arrest was issued against him on
13.08.2015. For joinder of the charge in both the
references, petitioner filed W-.P. No.3075-P/2015
before this Court invoking the provisions of section 17
(d) of the Ordinance read with sections 234 and 239
Cr.P.C. and asked for stay of proceedings before the
learned Trial Court in the instant reference. The
proceedings were accordingly stayed vide order dated

09.09.2015 and ultimately, the writ petition was
6
allowed on 10.12.2015, resultantly, both the references

were ordered to be tried jointly. It is to be noted that
the number of the PWs in the instant reference is 45
and that of the other reference is 54, making a total of
99 witnesses. The joinder of the charges of the two
references had led to denovo trial. At present fresh
charge has been framed against the petitioner and only
one PW has been examined so far while rest of the 98
witnesses are yet to be examined. Keeping in view the
lethargic conduct of the prosecution who at first
instance in long period of about two years did not
conclude the trial of the petitioner wherein they were
supposed to examine forty-five witnesses, hence, it can
be expected that they would be in a position to examine
ninety-nine witnesses in near future. The conclusion of
trial after rejoinder of charges will definitely take
more, rather, indefinite and shockingly long period,
which would be sufficient to bring the case of
petitioner in ambit of “hardship case”. Admittedly,
investigation in the case is complete and petitioner is
no more required for further interrogation. He is
languishing in Jail for approximately last two years.
We do not see anything material to show that it was the
petitioner who occasioned delay in conclusion of trial.

So far as his approach before this Court for joinder of
7
charges and stay of proceedings for three months is

concerned, the same was his legal right, therefore, this
delay of 3 months cannot be considered against him.
Speedy trial has also been re-assured in S.16 of the
Ordinance, laying down criteria for day to day trial and
its conclusion within thirty day, but such object does
not appear likely be achieved anywhere in the near
future in the instant case. In the circumstances, keeping
the petitioner behind the bars would serve no useful
purpose rather would be against the principle of justice
and the principles laid down by the august apex Court
in the cases (supra).

7. For the reasons discussed above, the case of the
petitioner falling within the ambit of a hardship case,
this petition is allowed. He is admitted to bail, provided
he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rupees five
millions with two local, reliable and resourceful
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
the learned Accountability Court, Peshawar.
