SYED MUHAMMAD ATTIQUE SHAH, _J.-
Petitioner through the instant writ petition has
approached this Court under Article 199 of the
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973,
with the following prayer:-

“It is therefore, most humbly

prayed that on acceptance of
instant writ petition the acts of the
respondents i.e. issuance of show
cause notice dated 19.05.2017 to
the petitioner may please be
declared null and void, void ab-
initio.

The respondents may
please be directed that before
declaring result provide fair
opportunity of hearing to 73
students of the respondents before
UFM comniittee, papers of the all
students may also be ordered to be
produced before this Honourable
Court alongwith daily
examination progress / personal
report of HSSC examination 2017
of the petitioner’s examination

centre.
Any other relief which this
Honourable Court deems

appropriate and proper in the
circumstances of the case.”

2. In essence, the grievance of the

petitioner is that the respondents be directed not to

declare the result of Annual Examination 2017 of

Higher Secondary School Certificate pertaining to

students studying in petitioner’s school who have

allegedly been found indulged in Unfair Means

(UFM) during said examination and the show cause

notice issued to the petitioner’s school be also

declared null and void.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. Perusal of record reveals that a large
number of students have been found indulged in
‘Unfair Means’ (UFM) during conduct of Annual
Examination, 2017 in the petitioner’s school. The
matter of UMF and its decision squarely falls within
the domain of the respondents. The plea of the
petitioner’s school that upcoming result of students,

who appeared in HSSC examination and found
indulged in UMF be withheld is without any legal
justification, as this Court in view of the peculiar facts
and circumstances of the present case, deems it proper
not to dilate upon the controversy involved in the
present petition, lest it may not prejudice the case of
the petitioner’s school before the Authority
concerned. Moreover, the factual controversy raised
in the present writ petition by the petitioner cannot be
resolved or dilated upon by this Court in its
constitutional jurisdiction. This Court considers that
this factual dispute can best be resolved by the
respondent-authority after hearing the petitioner and
considering his submissions in meaningful manner.
Let the respondents perform their functions in
accordance with law available on the subject.
Moreover, interference of this Court in the affairs of
the respondents at this stage would amount to hamper
the legal process which is to be carried out by them.
However, there is an application dated 17.07.2017 of
the petitioner’s school submitted to respondent No.2,
Chairman of the Board, therefore, this Court directs
the respondents to proceed with the matter and decide

the said application strictly in accordance with law.
5. Keeping in view the above stated
peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and
discussion made thereupon, the present writ petition

being bereft of merits, hence dismissed in /imine.
