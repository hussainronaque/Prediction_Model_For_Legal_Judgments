ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:-__ Through Cr.Misc.
No.71-P/2017, petitioner seeks permission of the Court to
bring on file the additional documents annexed with the
application as the same are necessary for the just decision
of the case. The application is supported by an affidavit
and the other side, has no objection, therefore, the same is
allowed, resultantly, the documents annexed with the
application shall be considered as part of Cr.Misc.BA
No.1434-P/2017.

2. Petitioner Bakhtiar Khan, seeks bail in case FIR
No.337 dated 16.05.2010, registered under sections
302/324/34 PPC, in Police Station MRS, Kohat, where he
along with co-accused Qaisar is charged for committing the
murder of Jehanzeb Khan deceased, the brother of
complainant Jamshed Khan.

3. According to report of complainant Jamshed Khan

on the fateful day he along with his deceased brother were
2

in Togh Bazaar in connection with purchase of house hold
articles and when reached the Chowk near High School
Togh, petitioner Bakhtiar Khan alongwith co-accused
Qaisar Khan, duly armed with pistols, emerged and opened
fire at them with the intention to commit their murder,
resultantly, the deceased got hit and died on the spot, while
he, the complainant, luckily remained unscathed. A dispute
over property has been alleged as motive behind the crime,
hence, this case.

4. Having heard the arguments of learned counsel for
the parties, it appears from the record that petitioner is
directly charged for commission of the crime with specific
role of firing at the deceased and complainant. The
occurrence has been reported with promptitude i.e. 30
minutes of the occurrence, which eliminates the possibility
of consultation and deliberation in charging the accused.
Being a broad daylight occurrence and parties well known
to each other, question of mistaken identity does not arise.
Six empties of 30 bore pistol have been recovered from the
crime spot and as per autopsy report the deceased has
sustained four firearm injuries which resulted his unnatural
death. The injuries on the person of the deceased do
commensurate with the number of the accused. Recovery
of blood of the deceased from the spot, his last worn attires
coupled with postmortem report and _ noticeable

abscondence of the petitioner, corroborate the version of
3

the complainant. The above discussed circumstances,
prima facie show complicity of the petitioner with the
commission of offence, punishment of which falls within
the Prohibitory Clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C., hence, he is
not entitled to the concession of bail.

5. The argument of learned counsel _ that
since co-accused Qaisar Khan, having identical role as
assigned to the petitioner, has been released on bail by the
learned Trial Court, therefore, on the principle of
consistency, the petitioner also deserves the same
treatment, is misconceived because co-accused had been
refused bail upto this Court. It so happened during trial,
when the complainant failed to appear for recording
evidence despite hectic efforts of the Trial Court,
co-accused was ultimately, granted bail and the trial was
adjourned sine die. Though, the role of co-accused is
similar with the petitioner, but he has not been granted bail
on merits, therefore, the rule of consistency cannot be
pressed into service in favour of the petitioner.

6. For the reasons discussed above, this petition being
meritless is hereby dismissed.

7. Before parting with the judgment, I, deem it
appropriate to refer to the direction of the learned Trial
Court vide order dated 30.05.2011 whereby releasing
co-accused on bail, the trial/case has been adjourned sine

die due to non-appearance of the complainant for evidence.
4

The direction qua sine die adjournment is squarely against
the spirit of section 344 Cr.P.C. It is to be noted that the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, does not provide any
provision for sine die adjournment, rather by invoking the
provision of section 344 Cr.P.C. the Trial Court may
postpone or adjournment proceedings, if , from the absence
of a witness or any other reasonable cause, it becomes
necessary or advisable by order in writing stating the
reasons therefor from time to time on such terms as it
thinks fit, for such time as it considers reasonable and may
by warrant remand the accused if in custody. The words
“from time to time” and “for such time as it considers
reasonable” are of much significance which provide that
such adjournment in the above circumstances will be from
time to time and for some specific time as the Court thinks
fit. Thus, the direction of the learned Trial Court qua sine
die adjournment is hereby quashed. The learned Trial
Court shall restore the trial and proceed with the same in
accordance with law.
