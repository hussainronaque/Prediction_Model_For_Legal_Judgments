ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- Through the present

Criminal Appeal, Mansoor Khan son of Aziz Khan, the appellant,
has challenged the legality of the judgment dated 29.04.2015 of
the Icarned Additional Sessions Judge-V, Nowshera, rendered in
case FIR No. 839 dated 21.12.2012 under sections-302/324/34
PPC registered at Police Station, Pabbi, District Nowshera,
whereby the appellant has been convicted and sentenced as
follows;

i. Under section 302(b) PPC sentenced to life
imprisonment on two counts for the murder of
deceased Luqman son of Murad and Imtiaz son
of Nadam Shah. He was also sentenced to pay
Rs.300,000/- as compensation to be paid to the
legal heirs of the deceased under section-544-A
Cr.PC for each deceased, or in default of
payment, he shall further undergo for six months
simple imprisonment each.
ii, Under Section-324/34 PPC sentenced to suffer
imprisonment for five years and also sentenced to
pay fine to the tune of Rs.50,000/- or in default of
payment of fine, shall undergo further simple
imprisonment for a term of three months.

2. The matrix of the prosecution case is that on
21.12.2012 at 17:00 hours Tahir son of Nadan Shah
(injured) reported the matter to Rooh-ul-Amin SI posted at
Casualty LRH, to the effect that on the day of occurrence
at 15:45 hours he, alongwith Imtiaz, Luqman and Ansar
were going towards “Taru Stop” in a Qingqi Rickshaw and
when reached the place of occurrence, a fight was going on
in between Khan Zali resident of Ali Baig and Niaz Alli,
Mansoor, Shoaib and Masood residents of Bazid Khel,
Punj Khatta, on the issue of females; that he (complainant)
and his companions came down from the “Qingqi
Rickshaw” and tried to separate them, when in the
meanwhile Niaz Ali etc started firing with deadly weapons
at Khan Zali and complainant as well as his companions,
resultantly he, Luqman, Imtiaz, Ansar and a passerby got
hit and sustained injuries, however, Luqman and Imtiaz
succumbed to the injuries and died; that one Asad and

Pervez brought them to Hospital; that there was no enmity
between Niaz Ali (accused party) and complainant party;
that the occurrence was witnessed by complainant, Akhtar
Ali and Ansar. Report of the complainant was reduced into
writing in the shape of murasila (EX PA/!) and sent to
police station for registration of case FIR against the
accused. The injury sheets of the injured/victims and
deceased and inquest reports of deceased were prepared,
and referred the dead bodies of deceased to Khyber
Medical College for postmortem examination. The accused
were avoiding their lawful arrest, therefore, proceedings
under section-512 Cr.PC were initiated against them and
challan under section-512 Cr.PC was submitted against
them. Accused-appellant was confined in Central Jail,
Peshawar, in case FIR No.238 dated 16.03.2013 under
section-13 A.O registered at Police Station Badh Bhair,
therefore, after observing legal formalities, he was
formally arrested in the present case and shifted to District
Nowshera through Zamima-B. He was_ thoroughly
interrogated in the present case and after completion of
investigation, supplementary challan was submitted against

him.
3. The convict-appellant was summoned by the trial
Court, and after compliance of provisions u/s-265-C
Cr.PC, formal charge against him was framed to which he
did not plead guilty and claimed trial.

4, The prosecution in order to prove its case examined
as many as eleven (11) witnesses.

5. On closure of prosecution evidence, the accused-
appellant was examined under Section 342 Cr.P.C,
wherein he pleaded innocence being falsely charged by the
complainant. He neither wished to be examined on oath
within the meaning of section-340(2) Cr.PC nor opted to
produce evidence in defence.

6. On conclusion of trial, after hearing the learned
counsel for the parties and appraisal of evidence available
on the file, the learned trial Judge vide impugned judgment
dated 29.04.2015 convicted and sentenced the appellant,
the details whereof are mentioned in the opening paragraph
of the judgment.

7. The appellant challenged the legality and validity of
the judgment passed by the trial Court before this Court by

filing Criminal Appeal cited above with the prayer that the
impugned judgment may be set aside and he may be
acquitted from the charges leveled against him.

8. Valuable arguments of the learned counsel for the
parties heard and perused the record carefully with their
valuable assistance.

9. Before dilating upon the evidence led by the
prosecution during the course of trial, first we have to see
the mode and manner of the occurrence, which was alleged
by the prosecution has been duly proved or not. To sustain
conviction in a criminal case it is not only the presence of
the PWs, which is to be established by the prosecution, in
addition to that prosecution is under obligation to convince
the Court through cogent and reliable evidence that the
occurrence had taken place in the mode and manner as
alleged. If there is any flaw or unreasonableness in the
prosecution case regarding its story then of course it has
bearing on the fate of the case. In other words the
prosecution story being foundation on which the
superstructure of case is raised and that occupies vital
position in a case it must stand to reason and should be

natural, convincing and free from any _ inherent
improbability. It is quite unsafe to believe an improper
prosecution story to base conviction upon the same. In this
case the deceased and the PWs are residents of different
villages. As per their stance, they had arrived there per
chance to pacify the scuffle between Khan Zali and the
accused side, which in our view is not the correct narration
on their part rather an element of concealment is apparent
on the face of record and their version is repellent to
natural probabilities and common course of natural events.
Instead of doing away with Khan Zali with whom there
was womenfolk’s dispute of the accused party, spared him
and committed the present occurrence.

10. Article 129 of Qanoon-e-Shahadat is of much
relevance for the resolution of the controversy in the
present case which is re-produced below:-

129. Court may presume existence of certain
facts.--- The Court may presume the existence of any
fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being
had to the common course of natural events, human
conduct and public and private business, in their relation

to the facts of the particular case---
This article is fully attracted to the facts and circumstances
of the present case. It is to be seen that behavior and
narration of the prosecution witnesses is natural or it ran
counter to natural human conduct and the behavior
explained in the ibid article of Qanoon-e-Shahdat.

By keeping in mind the above referred discussion, we will
evaluate the prosecution evidence in the subsequent
paragraphs.

11. The prosecution case is based upon the ocular
account furnished by Tahir injured-complainant (PW-02)
and injured witness namely Ansar (PW-03). The
complainant Tahir in his initial report (EX PA/1) as well as
in his Court statement stated that he alongwith his
deceased brother Imtiaz, deceased Luqman and injured
Ansar. The injured Ansar (PW-3) is nephew of
complainant Tahir (PW-2) and both are the residents of
village Ali Baig, District Nowshera, while the convict-
appellant Mansoor Khan and the co-accused namely Niaz
Ali, Masood and Shoaib Khan are the residents of village
Bazid Khel, District Peshawar and there is no relationship /

friendship whatsoever in between the complainant and all
the accused, but, despite that the complainant charged all
the accused by name in his initial report i.e murasila (EX
PA/1) and Court statement. The complainant in his initial
report stated that all the accused were armed with “Aslaha
Atasheen” and started firing at Khan Zali as well as at
them and that he, the two deceased, injured Ansar and
passerby (injured) Akhtar Ali were shifted by Asad son of
Pervez and others to the Hospital and that besides him, the
occurrence was also witnessed by injured Akhtar Ali and
Ansar. The complainant in his initial report (EX PA/1) has
not disclosed the purpose of his visit to Taru Stop and
during cross examination he also stated that he does not
know that for which purpose they were coming to Taru
Stop, however, he volunteered that they were coming to
their vehicle, even then he did not disclose the description
of his vehicle and the later portion of his statement comes
within the definition of improvement. As per complainant,
he alongwith his companions were coming in a Qingqi
Rickshaw and when reached the place of occurrence, they
deboarded from the rickshaw in order to separate the

parties i.e accused party and one Khan Zali, but, the
prosecution did not bother to record the statement of driver
of Motor Rickshaw, who was admittedly co-villager of
complainant, and the I.O has not taken into possession the
said Motor Rickshaw, which could prove and establish the
version of complainant. The complainant in his report EX
PA/I1 stated that all the accused were armed with Aslaha
Atasheen, however, in cross examination he stated that ail
the accused have fired indiscriminately and continued for
04/05 minutes and that the pistols were automatic and the
firing was rapid and the assertion regarding firing with
automatic pistols is for the reason that during spot
inspection, the 1.0 recovered one empty of 30 bore. The
complainant in his cross examination further stated that
they remained after firing for 04/05 minutes on the spot
and then they were shifted to the hospital in an Ambulance
which was available on the spot and that blood was also
oozing in the vehicle in which they were shifted to the
Hospital. The availability of Ambulance at the crime spot
at the relevant time is a question mark and not appealable
to a prudent mind as no blood was taken into possession by

the I.O from the vehicle. Even statement of its driver has
10
also not been recorded to establish the prosecution version.
The complainant in his cross examination has further
stated that Khan Zali was also fired at by all the accused,
but, despite indiscriminate firing for 04/05 minutes as per
complainant version, Khan Zali did not receive a single
injury or a scratch despite that the altercation was in
between Khan Zali and the accused party, which is not
believable and fits in the natural probabilities. Besides the
above, the said Khan Zali has not been produced by the
prosecution to prove the factum of quarrel / altercation
took place in between him and the accused party and that
the complainant party intervened between them for their
separation. The complainant stated that the firing
continued for 04/05 minutes while injured Ansar (PW-3) in
his cross examination stated that the accused have fired for
15 minutes with their respective pistols. It is also pertinent
to mention that passerby Akhtar Ali also sustained firearm
injuries in the present occurrence, but, the prosecution did
not bother to produce him before the Court and record his
statement in order to corroborate the prosecution version.

The complainant stated that the accused also fired at Khan
It
Zali while injured Ansar (PW-3) stated that Khan Zali was
not at all fired at. Medicolegal report (EX PW 11/1) of
injured Ansar (PW-3) would reveals that the injured was
conscious at the time of his examination by the doctor,
however, this Ansar in his court statement stated that he
was seriously injured and was unconscious. The
complainant as well as injured witness Ansar in their
statements have stated that the firing continued for about
04/05 and 15 minutes respectively and the Investigating
Officer (PW-7) in his cross examination stated the shops
shown in the site plan do come in the firing range, but, he
has not noted any firing marks on the walls of the said
shops. In this case four accused have been charged for the
commission of offence. The Investigating officer during
spot inspection recovered only one empty of 30 bore from
the crime spot while the complainant charged four persons
have been attributed the role of firing with pistols while the
injured witness and complainant in their respective
statements have stated that the firing was continued for

about 4/5 to 15 minutes, which is unbelievable and also
12

goes to the roots of the prosecution case and element of
exaggeration and false implication could not be ruled out.

12. Tahir complainant (PW-02) and Ansar sustained
firearm injuries in the occurrence. No doubt, stamp of
injuries shows the presence of injured at the spot, but it is
not the guarantee that he/she is truthful witness, the Court
has to evaluate the intrinsic worth of statement of the
injured witness by considering the circumstances of each
and every case. In this regard reliance is placed upon the
judgment rendered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Amin
Ali’s case ((2011 SCMR-323), wherein it has been held

that;

“Certainly, the presence of the injured witnesses
cannot be doubted at the place of incident, but the
question is as to whether they are truthful witnesses
or otherwise, because merely the injuries on the
persons of PWs would not stamp them truthful
witnesses.”

13. By deriving wisdom from the judgments of the
Hon’ble apex court in case titled “Tariq Mehmood Vs
State” reported in 2019 SCMR 1140 = and
“Mst.Rukhsana Begum Vs Sajjad and others” reported
in 2017 SCMR 596, we come to the conclusion that the

prosecution case is replete with doubts. The presence of
13

the deceased and the PWs at the scene of occurrence at the
relevant time was not for the purpose which has been
advanced by the complainant right from the time of
registration of the FIR rather it shows that they had come
to the place of occurrence for some purpose other than
disclosed by them. The mode and manner of the
occurrence has also been suppressed by the prosecution.
Therefore, by evaluating the evidence led by the
prosecution, we are left with no choice to extend the
benefit of doubt to the appellants. It is an axiomatic
principle of law that in case of doubt, the benefit thereof
must accrue in favour of the accused as matter of right and
not of grace. For giving the benefit of doubt, it was not
necessary that there should be many circumstances
creating doubts. If there is a circumstance which creates
reasonable doubt in-a prudent mind about the guilt of the
accused, then the accused would be entitled to the benefit
of doubt not as a matter of grace and concession but as a
matter of right.

14. As a sequel to what has been discussed above, we

accept the instant Cr. Appeal, the impugned judgment

14
dated 29.04.2015 passed by the trial Court is set aside, and

the appellant is acquitted of the charges leveled against

him.
Above are the detailed reasons of our short order of
even date.
