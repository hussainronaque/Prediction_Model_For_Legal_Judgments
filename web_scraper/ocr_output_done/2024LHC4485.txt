The complainant Mr. Rashid Akhtar, Advocate and
represented by: Syed Zeeshan Haider, Advocate

Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, J.: Instant appeal

has been filed by the appellant Muhammad Aamir Karim son of
Muhammad Manzar Karim against his conviction and sentence
awarded to him vide judgment dated 11.03.2022, rendered by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge/MCTC, Ahmadpur East, in case
FIR No.273 dated 19.07.2019, registered for the offence under
section 302 PPC with Police Station, City Ahmadpur East. Through
the impugned judgment, the appellant was convicted and sentenced

as under:-

Under section 302(b) PPC: Life Imprisonment alongwith Rs.300,000/- u/s 544-A
Cr.P.C as compensation to the legal heirs of deceased. In default whereof, it was
ordered that the same shall be recovered from the convict as arrears of land revenue
and he shall also suffer further six months S.I.

He was also extended benefit of section 382-B of Cr.P.C.

2. Briefly, as per FIR, on 18.07.2019 at about 11:15 p.m, three
unknown accused persons were scuffling with Muhammad Dilshad,
brother of complainant and one of them opened pistol shot resulting
death of complainant’s brother at the spot.

3. After completion of investigation, report under section 173 of
Cr.P.C was submitted against the appellant. On culmination of trial,
he was convicted and sentenced as noted above, hence this appeal.

4. Learned counsel for the appellant, in support of this appeal,
contends that prosecution’s evidence is neither trustworthy nor

convincing; that there are a number of material lacunas in
Criminal Appeal No.200 of 2022 2

(Muhammad Amir Karim v. The State, etc.)

prosecution’s case and infirmities in depositions of PWs; that the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case against the
appellant beyond the shadow of doubt; thus, the appeal be accepted
and the appellant may be acquitted from the charge.

5. On the other hand, learned ADPP for the State duly assisted
by learned counsel for the complainant, vehemently opposes this
appeal on the grounds that the prosecution has proved the case
against the appellant; that the defence remained failed to extract any
mala-fide of the complainant to falsely implicate the appellant; that
the prosecution has successfully proved the case against the
appellant and sentence of life imprisonment was rightly awarded to
the appellant hence, appeal may be dismissed.

6. Heard; record perused.

7. In murder cases, great care & caution is required for
evaluation of authenticity and veracity of evidence of purported
eye witnesses. In the case under discussion, the complainant
Muhammad Latif took stance that he alongwith Muhammad
Asghar and Salah-ud-Din, were present at the spot when they
witnessed the occurrence. There is no denial to the fact that
complainant is real brother of deceased, PW.Muhammad Asghar is
cousin whereas Salahuddin PW is nephew/Bhanja of complainant.
As such, they all are inter-se related. The Testimony of witnesses
who are closely related to the deceased has to be appreciated
carefully.' The complainant while appearing as PW.8 admitted that
he serves in a School as a watchman/Chowkidar, which is at a
distance of one furlang from the place of occurrence. He further
admitted that school is 2/3 acres away from Chacha Basti Chowk
and interse distance of place of occurrence said Chowk is 10 acres.
As per relevant column of FIR, the occurrence was taken place
four furlong west of Chacha Basti Chowk, which means that there
was considerable distance of between the place of occurrence and
school where the complainant is serving as Chowkidar, as such his

presence at the place of occurrence particularly at midnight is not

Zaman v. The State and others” (2014 SCMR 749) and “Abdul Ghafoor v. The
State” (2022 SCMR 1527)

(Muhammad Amir Karim v. The State, etc.)

natural, hence he was a chance witness. Same was the position of
other PW.9, who is resident of Mouza Mehmood Abad, Tehsil
Ahmadpur, himself admitted in cross-examination that Mehmood
Abad is situated at a distance of approximately 12 km from place
of occurrence. Therefore, they being chance witnesses had to
explain satisfactorily about their presence at the place of
occurrence. However, unfortunately, not even a single word is
stated by both these PWs in their statements regarding the justified
reason of their presence at the place of occurrence. Although,
complainant tried to justify his presence by stating that his relative
namely Jam Moosa resides near the Ejaz Petrol Pump and he went
to see him at 10:00 p.m to his house, however, being Watchman of
a school, going to see a relative at 10:00 p.m without reason is not
justified. Even otherwise, said Jam Moosa was not produced
before the Court to substantiate the claim of complainant, hence,
the complainant could not establish his presence at the place of
occurrence at the relevant time. The august Supreme Court of
Pakistan in recent pronouncement in case titled as “Muhammad

Hassan and another v. The State”? has held as under:-

“In light of the aforementioned facts, we are of the considered view that
the above-mentioned eye-witnesses could not justify their reasons for
being at the place of occurrence at the relevant time. Therefore, they are
chance witnesses, and their evidence is not free from doubt.

(Emphasis added)

In this regard, reference can also be made to case titled as “Mst.

Sughra Begum and _another_v. Qaiser_ Pervez and_ others”;

“Muhammad Irshad v. Allah Ditta and others” and “Sufyan Nawaz

and another v. The State and others”3.

8. Now adverting to the indictment of present appellant in this
case. It is an admitted fact that the appellant was not named in the
FIR. The occurrence was taken place on 18.07.2019 whereas
appellant was arrested under suspicion under section 54 of Cr.P.C
on 26.07.2019 i.e. after eight days of occurrence and was sent to
New Central Jail Bahawalpur where on 31.07.2019 i.e. after five
days of arrest and thirteen days of occurrence, identification parade

was conducted. As such, the identification parade has been held

32015 SCMR 1142, 2017 SCMR 142 and 2020 SCMR 192
Criminal Appeal No.200 of 2022 4

(Muhammad Amir Karim v. The State, etc.)

after a considerable delay from the arrest of appellant.
Furthermore, there is no denial to the fact that neither in complaint,
nor in FIR, the complainant has not mentioned the features of
unknown accused persons. Even during the course of cross-
examination, both the eye witnesses have admitted this fact. The
investigating officer Ijaz Ahmad S.I (PW.11) also admitted during
the cross-examination that none told him about the features, height,
age, colour of accused or as to whether they were having beard or
not. Therefore, the evidentiary value of same has a little value in
the eyes of law more particularly when the lineaments and
physiognomy of the accused were not mentioned anywhere by the
complainant or the eye-witnesses. Reliance is placed upon recent

case laws titled as “Muhammad Riaz v. Khurram Shehzad and

another” and “Mehboob Hassan v. Akhtar Islam”.* Moreover, the

Judicial Magistrate/PW.7, who conducted identification parade
admitted in cross-examination that he did not describe the features,
colours, heights of the dummies in between the identification
parade, when it was conducted. He further admitted it correct that
he did not mention in his report Exh.P.K whether the dummies
were resembled with the accused in any manner. He also admitted
that the accused raised an objection that he was shown to witnesses
by the IO prior to sending him in judicial lock up. These
admissions on the part of identification parade conductor further
raises questions on the veracity of identification parade.

9. Apart from the above noted infirmities in identification
parade there is another fact which creates heavy shadows of doubts
on the veracity of identification parade i.e. interview of Station
House Officer concerned which was taken on 25.07.2019 and
published in daily “Khabrain” on 26.07.2019. The defence took the
stance that said interview was published prior to the shown date of
arrest of appellant and his snap was also published in the
newspaper. The interview conductor (CW.5) Abdul Qadeer
appeared in witness box and supported the stance of accused by

deposing that he received the information from Amir Lal S I about

Criminal Appeal No.200 of 2022 5

(Muhammad Amir Karim v. The State, etc.)

arrest of appellant Aamir Karim and his cameraman Irshad made a
picture of the appellant. The prosecution could not negate this
stance of appellant rather during the course of cross-examination,
investigating officer (PW.11) simply showed his ignorance about
this fact. However, said statement of I.O is not worthy of any
credence as his snap was also present alongwith appellant and
SHO, to whom he identified. Therefore, in view of above, the
identification parade has lost its credibility and no reliance can be
placed thereupon.

10. Another fact of immense importance which further casts
doubts on the prosecution story is that allegedly, the occurrence
took place at about 11:15 p.m on 18.07.2019, however, it is an
admitted fact that post mortem examination of the deceased was
conducted at 06:30 a.m on 19.07.2019 with the delay of more than
eight hours. PW.3 Muhammad Ramzan 1900/C deposed during the
course of cross-examination that they received information about
the occurrence at about 10:00/10:45 and they reached at the place
of occurrence within five minutes and left the spot after fifteen
minutes, meaning thereby, as per statement of this PW, he took the
dead body to hospital at about 11:10/11:15 p.m on 18.07.2019,
while on the other hand, contradicting the statement of this
important witness, PW.2/Dr.Muhammad Abid Aslam deposed
during the course of cross-examination that he received the dead
body at 06:00 a.m. Furthermore, at the time of external
examination of the dead body, the PW.2/Dr.Muhammad Abid
Aslam, observed that rigor mortis was developed and there was
heavy clotted blood over the cloths of dead body, which further
corroborates the fact that postmortem examination was conducted
with considerable delay. Even otherwise, there is no explanation at
all as to why the post mortem examination of the deceased was got
conducted with such a delay. In similar circumstances, in case

titled “Muhammad Ijaz alias BILLA and another v. The State and

others”®, the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under:-

“* In such circumstances, the most natural inference would be that the delay
so caused was or preliminary investigation and prior consultation to nominate

5 2024 SCMR 1507
Criminal Appeal No.200 of 2022 6

(Muhammad Amir Karim v. The State, etc.)

the accused and plant eye-witnesses of the crime. Reference in this regard
may be made to the case of Muhammad Rafique alias Feeqa v. The State
(2019 SCMR 1068). In similarly circumstances, this Court, in the case of
Irshad Ahmad v. The State (2011 SCMR 1190), observed that the noticeable
delay in post-mortem examination of the dead body is generally suggestive of
a real possibility that time had been consumed by the police in procuring and
planting eye-witnesses before preparing police papers necessary for the same.
This view has been followed by this court in Ulfat Hussain v. The State (2018
SCMR 313), Muhammad Yaseen v. Muhammad Afzal and another (2018
SCMR 1549), Muhammad Rafique v. The State (2014 SCMR 1698),
Muhammad Ashraf v. The State (2012 SCMR 419) and Khalid alias Khalidi
and 2 others v. The State (2012 SCMR 327).”
(Emphasis added)

11. Adverting to the next intriguing aspect of the matter ice.
conduct of witnesses. Admittedly, the complainant is real brother of
deceased whereas PW.Muhammad Asghar is cousin and Salahuddin
PW is nephew/Bhanja of complainant as well as of deceased. There
are certain admitted facts that none of them tried to catch the
accused persons or inform the police. They have not given any first
aid to the deceased in injured condition even they did not try to take
him to hospital in order to save his life and the deceased remained
lying on the ground even in the presence of his real brother and close
relatives. The mouth and eyes were found open by the medical
officer (PW.2) as such, it is proved that they even did not try to close
the mouth and eyes of the deceased. Such conduct of the
prosecution eye-witnesses was highly unnatural and casts doubts
about their presence at the place of occurrence at the relevant
time. Reliance in this regard is humbly placed upon the recent
pronouncements of august Supreme Court of Pakistan in case

titled as “Mst. Saima Noreen v. The State’”® and “Riasat Ali v. The

State’”’ and “Magsood Alam and another v. The State and others”®.

12. Another important aspect of the matter is that prosecution
witnesses could not establish their presence sufficiently at the
place of occurrence as neither the complainant nor PWs reside
there and their residences are at a considerable distance. The
stance of the complainant was that he was came to see his relative
Jam Moosa, who resides near the Ejaz Petrol Pump where other
PWs also arrived after one hour of his arrival. However, quite
astonishingly, the prosecution has not produced the said Jam

Moosa in order to substantiate presence of complainant and PWs

72024 SCMR 1224
52024 SCMR 156
Criminal Appeal No.200 of 2022 7

(Muhammad Amir Karim v. The State, etc.)

at the stated time. Hence, the best witness, which could have
independently supported the prosecution version has been
withheld by the prosecution and non-producing of said witness
tantamount to inference that had he been produced, he would have
not supported the prosecution version. The august Supreme Court

of Pakistan in recent pronouncement in case titled “Muhammad

Ijaz alias BILLA and another v. The State and others” ’ has held

as under: -

“We believe that the prosecution withheld the best evidence, which
undermines the credibility of its account. It is well established that
whenever a party withholds the best evidence available, it is presumed
under Article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, that if such
evidence had been produced, it would not have supported the stance of
that party.”

(Emphasis added)

Reference in this regard can also be placed on case titled as

“Riasat Ali v. The State” and “Abdul Qadeer v. The State” '°.

13. Last but not the least, learned counsel for the appellant has
consistently argued that the dead body of the deceased was taken
to hospital through Rescue-1122. Although, the prosecution has
been remained reluctant in this regard, however, during the course
of trial, the team of Rescue-1122 was summoned as CW.1 to
CW.3, who deposed in line with the version of defence and also
produced certain documents i.e. copies of Rapat record of 1122.
The said witnesses are undoubtedly natural and independent who
supported the defense plea and prosecution could not sufficiently
establish their any relation with the accused. Therefore, the
appellant remained successful in proving his plea. In case titled

oll

“Muhammad Imtiaz Baig and another_v. The State”'’, august

Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under: -

All the factors favouring belief in the accusation must be placed in
juxtaposition to the corresponding factors favouring the plea in defence
and the total effect should be estimated in relation to the questions viz. is
the plea/version raised by the accused satisfactorily established by the
evidence and circumstances appearing in the case?---If the answer is in the
affirmative, then the Court must accept the plea of the accused and act
accordingly---If the answer to the question is negative, then the Court will
not reject the defence plea as being false but will go a step further to find
out whether or not there is yet a reasonable possibility of the defence
plea/version being true---If the Court finds that although the accused has
failed to establish his (defence) plea/version to the satisfaction of the

° 2024 SCMR 1507

Criminal Appeal No.200 of 2022 8

(Muhammad Amir Karim v. The State, etc.)

Court but the plea might reasonably be true, even then the Court must
accept his plea and acquit or convict him accordingly.

Reference in this regard can also be placed on case laws titled as
“Faiz and others v. The State”, “Ashigq Hussain alias Muhammad

Ashraf _v. The State”, “Sultan Khan v. Sher Khan and

others” ,“Muhammad Asghar v. Muzammal Khan and 2 others”,
“Muhammad Ashraf v. The State’, “Sabir Ali v. The State”,
“Ahmad Nawaz and another v. The State” and “Ali Ahmad and

9912

another v. The State and others

14. In view of attending circumstances, there remains no
uncertainty that the prosecution case is replete with doubts in respect
of presence of PWs at the place of occurrence, the benefit of which
is unequivocally to be given to the appellant. Reliance in this regard
is also placed on recent pronouncements of august Supreme Court of

Pakistan in case laws titled as “Khial Muhammad v. The State”,

“Tftikhar Hussain alias Kharo v. The State” and “Muhammad Riaz v.
Khurram Shahzad”.

15. It is a known and settled principle of law that prosecution
primarily is bound to establish guilt against the accused without
shadow of reasonable doubt by producing trustworthy, convincing
and coherent evidence enabling the Court whether the prosecution
has succeeded in establishing accusation against the accused or
otherwise and if it comes to the conclusion that charges so imputed
against the accused have not been proved beyond reasonable doubt,
then the accused becomes entitled for his release on getting benefit
of doubt in the prosecution case. In such situation the Court has no
jurisdiction to abridge such right of the accused. After considering
all the pros and cons of this case, this Court has come to this
irresistible conclusion that the prosecution could not prove its case
against the appellant beyond the shadow of doubt. In a recent

pronouncement in case titled as “Muhammad Hassan and another v.

The State and others”'*, august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held:-

““’,..once a single loophole/ lacuna is observed in a case presented by the prosecution, the

benefit of such loophole/lacuna in the prosecution case automatically goes in favour of an

accused. Reference in this regard may be made to the cases of Daniel Boyd (Muslim Name
Saifullah) and another v. The State (1992 SCMR 196); Gul Dast Khan v. The State (2009
SCMR 431); Muhammad Ashraf alias Acchu v. The State (2019 SCMR 652); Abdul Jabbar
and another v. The State (2019 SCMR 129); Mst. Asia Bibi v. The State and others (PLD
2019 SC 64) and Muhammad Imran v. The State (2020 SCMR 857)”.

(Emphasis supplied)

16. In the light of above discussion, I am of the considered view
that the prosecution has failed to prove its case against the appellant
beyond the shadow of doubt, therefore, instant criminal appeal is
accepted and his conviction and sentence recorded by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge/MCTC, Ahmadpur East vide impugned
judgment dated 11.03.2022 is set aside and he is acquitted of the
charge by extending him the benefit of doubt. He is in jail, he be

released forthwith if not required in any other case.
