JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN_KHAN, _J:-_At a trial held by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-III, Swabi, accused
Nawab Khan, having been found guilty of committing
murder of Sultan Sharif deceased, has been convicted
under section 302 (b) PPC and sentenced to undergo
imprisonment for life and to pay Rs.2,00,000/-, as
compensation to legal heir of the deceased in terms of
section 544-A Cr.P.C., vide judgment dated 18.09.2017, in
case FIR No.71 dated 23.06.2014, registered at Police
Station IDS. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C., has been
v / extended to him.
y 2. Through the instant appeal, the appellant-convict
has questioned his conviction and sentence, whereas,

through connected Cr.R. No.123-P/2017, Mst. Lal Pari Jan
yt

(widow of the deceased), is seeking enhancement of
sentence of the convict from life imprisonment to normal
penalty of death, as provided for the offence of murder.

3, Since, both the matters are arising from one and
the same judgment of the learned trial Court dated
18.09.2017, therefore, we, propose to decide the same
through this single judgment.

4. The prosecution case as unfolded in First
Information Report (“FIR”) Exh.PA is that on 23.06.2014
at 20.00 hours, Sultan Sharif deceased then injured, fully
conscious, in presence of his brother Rehman Sharif
(PW.7) and Dr. Mukamil Khan CMO (PW.10), reported to
Mukhtiar Khan SI (PW.14), in Casualty of District
Headquarter (DHQ) hospital, Swabi, to the effect that on
the fateful day he was present in Masizai street near the
house of Hasham Khan when at 1830 hours, Nawab Khan
(the appellant), duly armed with pistol came there and fired
at him, as a result, he got hit and injured. after commission
of the offence, the appellant decamped from the spot. An
oral altercation between Said Sharif, father of the deceased
then injured and the appellant, a day prior to the
occurrence, has been advanced as a motive behind the
occurrence. Report of the deceased then injured was
recorded in the shape of Murasila Exh.PA/1 by Mukhtiar
Khan SI (PW.14), which was thumb impressed by the

deceased then injured, signed by Rehman Sharif (brother of
an

3

the deceased) as a verifier, and its author as well as
attested by Dr. Mukamil Khan CMO (PW.10). Mukhtiar
Khan SI (PW.14) prepared injury sheet Exh.PW.14/1 of the
deceased then injured and referred him for medical
examination. He sent the Murasila to Police Station on the
basis of which FIR Exh.PA was registered against the
appellant.

5. Dr. Mukamil Khan (PW.10) examined the
deceased then injured on 23.06.2014 at 08.05 p.m. vide
medico legal report Exh.PW.10/1, and observed the
following:-

Patient was conscious and oriented in time and

space. He was having severe pain in the wound and
bleeding. There was 1 x 1.5 cm entry wound on front of
right side of his chest near right axilla. Surgeon was called,
who referred him to LRH, Peshawar for further
management, however, the injured succumbed to injury in
DHQ hospital Swabi and Dr. Imtiaz Khan (PW.9)
conducted autopsy on his dead body on 24.06.2014 at
12.30 a.m, who noticed the same wound on the person of
the deceased then injured as observed by (PW.10), with no
exit. During post mortem a bullet was extracted from the
dead body of the deceased which was put in a phial and
handed over to police.

6. Rab Nawaz Khan ASI (PW.15), conducted

investigation in the case, who proceeded to the spot and
prepared site plan Exh.PB, on the pointation of alleged
eyewitness Habib ur Rehman (PW.6). Vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.3/1, he took into possession a phial containing
bullet Exh.P.1, Similarly, through recovery memo
Exh.PW.2/1 he took into possession the last worn
bloodstained garments of the deceased, recorded
statements of the PWs under section 161 Cr.P.C., sent the
bloodstained clothes to the FSL, initiated proceedings
under sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C., against the appellant
and after completion of investigation handed over case file
to the SHO, who submitted challan under section 512
Cr.P.C. against the appellant.

7. Appellant was arrested by Ibrahim Shah SHO on
28.07.2015 vide arrest Card Exh.PW.12/1 and handed over
to Manzoor Alam SI (PW.12), who interrogated him.
During interrogation the appellant disclosed that the crime
pistol has been recovered from possession of his son by the
police against whom vide FIR No.137 dated 17.12.2014
under section 15 KP Arms Act, 2013, has been registered.
The said pistol was produced by Moharrir of PS IDS to
Manzoor Alam SI along with 05 live rounds Exh.P.4, who
took the same into possession vide memo Exh.PW.11/1.
Vide application; he sent the pistol along with bullet
extracted from the body of the deceased to the FSL, report

whereof is Exh.PW.12/6. After completion of
y"

investigation, supplementary challan was submitted against
the appellant before the learned trial Court.

8. On receipt of challan by the learned trial Court, the
appellant was formally charge sheeted to which he pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial. To establish the guilt of the
appellant, the prosecution examined as many as fifteen
witnesses. After closure of the prosecution evidence,
statement of the appellant was recorded under section 342
Cr.P.C. wherein he denied the prosecution allegation and
professed innocence. He, however, neither wished to be
examined on oath under section 340(2) Cr.P.C., nor opted
to produce evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial, the
learned trial Court after hearing both the sides convicted
and sentenced the appellant as mentioned above.

9. We have heard the exhaustive arguments of
learned counsel for the parties and perused the record with
their able assistance.

10. It appears from record that it is a case of dying
declaration as the deceased then injured Sultan Sharif, after
making report Exh.PA/1 and getting first aid, succumbed
to his injury in DHQ hospital Swabi after an hour or two.
In cases of a dying declaration, the Courts always put
emphasis for the prooffevidence with regard to
consciousness, orientation in time and space as well as
ability and capability of the injured to make lucid

statement. In this case, the dying declaration of the
deceased then injured has been recorded by Mukhtiar Khan
S.I (PW.14) in the shape of Murasila Exh.PA/1, wherein it
has been categorically mentioned that the deceased then
injured was in full senses at the time of report. Mukhtiar
Khan SI while appearing as PW.14 confirmed the aforesaid
fact by deposing that at the time of making report
Exh.PA/1, Sultan Sharif the deceased then injured was in
full senses. He further deposed that he recorded his
report/dying declaration in presence of Rehman Sharif
(brother of the deceased) and Casualty Medical Officer
Mukamil Khan (PW.10). Dying declaration of the deceased
then injured, besides his thumb impression bear the
signatures of Mukhtiar Khan and Rehman Sharif (verifier).
Similarly, it also bears the
endorsement/certificate/attestation of the casualty medical
Officer. Rehman Sharif while appearing as PW.7, deposed
that report/dying declaration of the deceased was scribed
by PW.14 in his and presence of CMO, in the casualty of
DHQ hospital Swabi and at the time of report/declaration,
the deceased then injured was fully conscious.
Dr. Mukamil Khan CMO DHQ hospital Swabi while
y appearing as PW.10 deposed that on 23.06.2014 at 8.05
p.m, he examined the deceased then injured in casualty of
DHQ hospital Swabi, who was fully conscious and
oriented in time and space. He exhibited medico legal

report as Exh.Pw.10/1 and injury sheet Exh.PW.10/2.
11. The above named three witnesses, namely,
Mukhtiar Khan SI (PW.14) who is the author, Rehman
Sharif (PW.7), who is verifier, and Dr. Mukamil Khan
CMO (PW.10), who is attester of the dying declaration,
have been subjected to taxing cross-examination by the
defence, but nothing favourable to defence could be
extracted from their mouths. The defence failed to shatter
their testimony to the effect that the deceased was not
capable to make statement. All of them are consistent with
each other on the point of consciousness, orientation in
time and space as well as capability of the deceased then
injured at the time of making report. As per medico legal
report, the deceased then injured has sustained a solitary
firearm entry wound on front of right side of his chest near
right axilla and in the Post mortem report the probable time
between injury and death has been given as 3 to 4 hours. In
this view of the matter, we are of the considered view that
the deceased then injured was fully conscious, well
oriented in time and space and capable to make
statement/report. An iota of evidence has not been brought
by the defence to show remotely that the deceased then
injured was influenced by any one at the time of report. No
infirmity could be pointed out in the dying declaration. The
deceased then injured has furnished true account of the
occurrence. He has directly and singularly charged the

appellant for commission of the offence. The occurrence
has taken place in the month of June at 06.30 p.m. ie. in a
broad daylight, therefore, question of mistaken identity
does not arise, particularly, when the appellant and the
deceased being co-villagers, were already known to each
other. Medical evidence furnished by Dr. Mukamil Khan
(PW.10) and Dr. Imtiaz Khan (PW.9), is in consonance
with the version in the dying declaration. No reason and
circumstance has been brought on record by the defence so
as to remotely suggest substitution and false implication of
the appellant in the case. Admittedly, substitution of real
culprit charged directly and singularly is a rare
phenomenon in the system of criminal justice. Reference in
this regard can be made to case titled, “Allah Ditta Vs the
State” (PLD 2002 Supreme Court 52) and case titled,
“Muhammad Iqbal Vs the State” (PLD 2001 Supreme

Court 222. Positive Serologist report Exh.PL, with regard
to last wearing bloodstained garments of the deceased,
corroborates the dying declaration. Besides, absconsion of
the appellant soon after the occurrence till his arrest
without any explanation much less plausible, is yet another
circumstance which speaks about his guilty conscious.

12. As regards recovery of 30 bore pistol No.9066
(crime weapon) from son of the appellant against whom
FIR No.137 dated 17.12.2014 under section 15 KP Arms
Act, PS IDS, was registered, we, do not consider it safe to

take this piece of evidence in aid of the prosecution case
because in the FSL Exh.PW.12/6 it has not been opined
that the bullet extracted from the body of the deceased was
fired from the said pistol. The opinion of the Fire Arms
Expert is reproduced below:-

“Examination of the case has revealed that
deformed crime bullet marked B is that of 30 bore,
lacks sufficient identifiable data for examination and
comparison, hence, no opinion can be expressed as
to whether or not it was fired from 30 bore pistol
No.9066 in question. The 30 bore pistol No.9066 is
proper working order in its present condition.”

13. During the course of arguments, learned counsel
for the appellant emphasized on the testimony of alleged
eyewitness Habib ur Rehman (PW.6), and deposed that he
has totally contradicted the version of the deceased then
injured in his statement. Learned counsel added that he
(PW.6) has introduced quite a new story of the occurrence
so much so that he has disclosed a different place of
occurrence.

14. We have gone through the statement of Habib ur
Rehman (PW.6). Admittedly, his name does not appear as
eyewitness in the dying declaration, however, for the sake
of discussion his statement may be referred. He deposed
that on the eventful day he along with Naeem Ullah were
proceeding near the house of one Azam Khan, at that time
deceased Sultan Sharif was also proceeding a little ahead
of them; that accused facing trial Nawab made firing upon

deceased Sultan Sharif with pistol from the roof of (Dewri)
fl

10

of one Zar said, with which he got hit and injured; that he
and PW Naeem Ullah witnessed the occurrence; that he
pointed out the spot to the investigating Officer; that the
occurrence took place at about 6.30 p.m. In cross-
examination he stated that deceased was the son of his
Aunt. Somebody brought the cot and put the injured on the
cot and somebody might have conveyed the information
for the vehicle that came there. He further deposed that the
injured was taken by them upto the Adda but he did not
accompany the deceased then injured to the hospital. The
unnatural conduct of PW Habib ur Rehman i.e. not
informing the family members of the deceased not taking
any interest in arranging the Cot or vehicle as well as not
accompanying the deceased then injured to the hospital, is
sufficient to make doubtful his presence at the spot. Had
PW Habib ur Rehman present at the spot, he being the
maternal cousin, the deceased then injured must have
mentioned his name as an eyewitness or his alleged role. In
this view of the matter, we, straight away discard his
testimony. In case titled, “Rashid Ahmad Vs Muhammad
Nawaz and others”, (SCMR_1152) the Hon’ble Supreme
Court has held that:-

“testimony of the prosecution witness not
mentioned in the FIR, but introduced
subsequently, had no evidentiary value”.

15. In view of the above discourse, even if the

testimony of the PW Habib ur Rehman as corroborative
ql!

11

pieces of evidence is ousted from consideration, even then,
the dying declaration of the deceased then injured being
trustworthy and proved through cogent and confidence
inspiring evidence, would alone be sufficient for recording
conviction. The honesty and truthfulness of the dying
declaration of the deceased can be determined from the
fact that the report has been signed by Rehman Sharif
(PW.7) as a verifier, who is the brother of the deceased,
but even then the deceased then injured did not mention his
name as an eyewitness. In case titled, “Farmanullah vs

Qadeem Khan and another” (2001 SCMR 1474), it has

been ruled by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan

that:-

“Dying declaration once believed is not legally
required to be supported by independent
corroboration, especially in the absence of
allegation of the substitution of real culprit
with the accused.”

This Court in case titled, “Parvez vs Farhad Ali and
another” (PLD 2005 Peshawar 172) while placing
reliance on the judgment (supra) of the apex Court as well
as judgments of this Court and others has held that:-

“No doubt, sometimes a dying declaration alone
cannot be made a basis of conviction and as a matter
of abundant caution the superior courts ask for its
corroboration but it is not a rule of law, but
requirement of prudence, and if it is proved that it is
influence free or does not suffer from any infirmity, it
becomes a substantive piece of evidence and it alone

can become a basis of conviction. In this connection,
12

reliance can be placed on 1996 P Cr L J 1989 (Quetta),
1999 P Cr L J 1305 (Peshawar), 2001 P Cr LJ SC
(AJ&K) 286 and 2001 SCMR 1474.”

16. Deriving wisdom, guidance and placing reliance
on the judgments (supra), we believe the dying declaration
of the deceased then injured as the truthful account of the
occurrence, therefore, held the appellant guilty of the
offence.

17. Now the moot question would be the quantum of
sentence to be awarded to the appellant to meet the ends of
justice. In the case of Israr Ali vs. The State reported in
2007 SCMR 525, it was ruled by the Hon’able bench that
question of sentence demands utmost care on part of the
Court dealing with life and liberties of people and that
accused person (s) are also entitled to extenuating benefit
of doubt on the question of sentence. Again, in the case of

Muhammad Riaz and another vs the State and another

reported_in 2007 SCMR 1413, it was observed by the

Hon’able Supreme Court that no doubt, normal penalty for
an act of commission of Qatl-i-Amd provided under law is
death, but since life imprisonment also being a legal
sentence for such offence must be kept in mind wherever
the facts and circumstances warrant mitigation of sentence,
because no hard and fast rule can be applied in each and
every case.

18. In this case, the motive alleged has not been

proved. Similarly, the deceased has sustained a solitary
13

firearm entrance wound. There is no repetition of fire on
the part of the appellant despite that the deceased was at
his mercy. Thus considering the above aspects as
mitigating circumstances, we, concur with the learned trial
Court in the matter of sentence.

19, For what has been discussed above, this appeal and

the connected Cr.R. No.123-P/2017, titled, “Sultan

Sharif vs Nawab:, are hereby dismissed.
