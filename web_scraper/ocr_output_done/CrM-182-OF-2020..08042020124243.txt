JUDGMENT

see
AHMAD ALI, J. Through the instant petition, the
petitioners (Mehboob-ur-Rehman, Atiqu-ur-
Rehman and Arshad Aziz), seek their post arrest
bail in case FIR No. 31 dated 10.02.2020, under
Sections 302/148/149 PPC read with Section 15-
AA KPK, Police Station, Chanjal (District
Battagram).

2. Brief facts of the case are that the
complainant Haq Nawaz Khan reported the matter
to the local police to the effect that he was present
in house when at 03:30 AM, his brother Niaz
Muhammad Khan informed him from Abbottabad

that their brother Abdul Latif has been murdered.
On this information, he reached the house of
Sarnawaz Khan and found the dead body of Abdul
Latif, lying in a washroom. He charged accused
Niaz-ur-Rehman, Sajeed-ur-Rehman, Saeed-ur-
Rehman, Mehboob, Arshad and Attique ur
Rehman for committing murder of his brother.
Motive for the occurrence was disclosed to be
previous quarrel which though was compromised.
3. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
parties heard and record perused with their
valuable assistance.

4. Perusal of record reveals that six persons
have been charged for the commission of offence.
The complainant was, however, neither eyewitness
of the occurrence nor had first hand information
regarding the occurrence, while the brother of
complainant namely Niaz Muhammad Khan, who
informed the complainant about the occurrence,
had not himself reported the matter to the local
police.

5. Another important aspect of the case is that
co-accused Niaz-ur-Rehman has confessed his

guilt by recording his statement under Section
164/364 Cr.P.C. Though the evidentiary value of
the confessional statement of accused Niaz-ur-
Rehman is yet to be determined at trial, however,
tentative assessment of the same reveals that he
has exonerated the present petitioner and claimed
that he alone was involved in the murder of
deceased. Moreover, the complainant in his report,
charged accused/petitioners along with co-accused
for preplanned murder of the deceased, however,
no specific role towards commission of offence
was attributed to the present petitioners. The case
against the present petitioners thus squarely falls
within the ambit of further inquiry, entitling them
to the concession of bail.

6. It has, time and again, held by the superior
Courts that the question of vicarious liability is
always to be seen by the trial Court. In this respect
reliance can be placed on case laws reported in
2010 SCMR_ 1219, 1986 NLR SC 885 & 2011
SCMR 902.

7. For what has been discussed above and on
tentative assessment of material available on file, a

case for grant of bail is made out. Resultantly, this
petition is allowed and the accused-petitioners,
named above, are admitted to bail, on furnishing
bail bonds in the sum of Rs.200,000/- each with
two sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of learned Illaqa/Duty Judicial
Magistrate concerned, who shall ensure that the
sureties are local, reliable and men of means.
