ORDER
 
SHAHNAWAZ
TARIQ,J:- Through captioned pre-arrest bail application,
applicants Umar Gabol and Israr Gabol have impugned order dated 24.06.2011,  whereby
their earlier bail application was dismissed by the Court of learned Ist
Additional Sessions Judge, Ghotki.
 
2.     The
relevant facts spelt outfrom instant bail are that complainant lodged F.I.R on
23.05.2011 alleging that on 21.05.2011, that 12 named accused along with 6
unknown persons duly armed with hatchets and lathis forcibly taken away 40 bags
of wheat by tractor and trolley from the land of complainant, hence instant F.I.R.
 
3.     Learned
Counsel for applicant contended that applicants are innocent and have been
falsely implicated by the complainant due to ulterior motives as parties are already
disputed over matrimonial affairs; that complainant party lodged several F.I.Rs
and Direct Complaint against accused party but all cases were disposed of; that
complainant has lodged instant F.I.R with the delay of two days for which no reason
has been shown; that all the PWs are close relatives of the complainant and interested;
that two co-accused have already granted bail by the trial Court; that if
applicants are not granted bail, they will be arrested and humiliated at the
hands of police. He relied on the case of Mitho Pitafi v. The State (2009 SCMR
299).
 
4.     Learned
APG contended that applicants were granted pre-arrest bail by the trial Court
which was dismissed on 24.06.2011 and after 3 years, they have approached this
Court for bail,hence they are not entitled for grant of bail.
 
5.             Heard
learned Counsel for the parties supported with case law and perused the record
minutely. 
 
6.     Indeed,
parties are already disputed with each other and previously complainant party
had lodged F.I.Rs No.131 of 2009, 119 of 2009 and 47 of 2011 at Police Station,
Adil Pur, and Direct Complaint No.705 of 2009,against applicantsand their
companions, and ultimately all the cases were disposed of in favour of
applicants.Complainant has lodged F.I.R with delay of two days for which no
plausible explanation has been furnished. Allegedly incident occurred during
the bright day but no independent person from the locality has supported the
allegations levelled in F.I.R. There are general allegations against 12 named
and 6 unknown culprits for forcibly taking away 40 bags of wheat and such
allegations requires serious considerationand it is for learned trial Court to thrash
hold    the truth by recording evidence of PWs.Moreover, after grant of interim
pre-arrest bail by this Court vide order 01.12.2014, applicants are attending the
trial Court regularly and they neither misused the concession of bail nor they frustrated
the trial. It is well settled that concession of bail could not be withheld merely
on the ground that accused remained fugitive from law if accused is otherwise
entitled for grant of bail.In present case applicants were granted interim
pre-arrest bail by the trial but later on same was dismissed. Co-accused namely
Zahoor Ahmed and Subhan on the same allegations, have been granted bail by the
trial Court and case of applicants is on same footing as such their absence
from trial will not defeat their right of bail.In the case of Mitho Pitafi (Supra),
the honourable Supreme Court granted bail to accused as their bail was declined
by the High Court on the ground that accused remained fugitive from law.
 
7.     Considering the above facts
and circumstances, interim pre-arrest
bail already granted to the applicants vide order dated 01.12.2014, stands
confirmed on the same terms and conditions. Applicants are directed to appear
regularly before learned trial Court to face their trial.
 
 
8.     The observations
referred supra are tentative in nature and learned trial Court shall decide the
case strictly on merits.
