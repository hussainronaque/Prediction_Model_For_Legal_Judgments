Muhammad Usman
Versus

The State and another

JUDGMENT
For Petitioner: M/S Muhammad Yousaf Khan and
Muhammad Naveed Mehsood, Advocates.
For respondentNo.2: Mr. Shah Fahd Ansari, Advocate.
Date of hearing 18.12.2019

S.M.ATTIQUE SHAH, J.- Petitioner Muhammad Usman stands
charged in case F.I.R No.6 dated 06.11.2019 registered under
sections 3/21/24 of Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 read
with section 419 PPC at police station Cyber Crime, FIA,
D.I.Khan. He was refused the concession of bail by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-I, D.J.Khan vide order dated

13.11.2019, hence the instant petition for the same relief.

2. The prosecution story, in brief, is that on 08.8.2019,
the respondent No.2 submitted a written complaint to FIA
authorities regarding objectionable pictures and messages of
harassment transmitted to her by the petitioner. However, the
Cyber Crime team, after recording the statement of complainant,
investigated the matter, took screenshots of objectionable pictures,

messages as well as confirmation regarding the ownership of cell

number of the petitioner and after permission from the competent

authority, arrested the petitioner and registered the above F.LR.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4, Perusal of the record reveals that objectionable
pictures which were uploaded through a cell phone on whatsapp
were recovered from possession of the petitioner which
stigmatized the honour of not only the complainant but her whole
family. The petitioner also committed the offence of blackmailing
by intentionally and publicly exhibiting, displaying and
transmitting the nude photographs for the purpose of some
illegitimate demands. The petitioner, in his statement, also did not
deny the commission of offence. The offence is of moral turpitude
which badly affects the society at large. The argument of learned
counsel for the petitioner that the offence with which the petitioner
is charged does not fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497
Cr.P.C and in such like cases, bail is a rule and refusal an
exception, is of little help to him. No doubt, bail in offences
punishable with less than ten years of imprisonment is ordinarily
granted as a rule, however, the concession is to be extended having
regard to the facts and circumstances of each case and in
appropriate cases, the Court may justifiably depart from the rule to
deny the favour. In the instant case, the allegation against the
petitioner is not only supported by evidence but also his own
statement, thus, I do not feel persuaded to extend discretionary

jurisdiction in favour of the petitioner.
5. For the reasons mentioned above, the instant petition
being devoid of substance is hereby dismissed. However, it is
clarified that the observations made above being tentative in nature

would not impact upon the fate of the trial.

Announced.
