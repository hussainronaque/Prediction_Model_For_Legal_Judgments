Date of hearing: 20.12.2018
JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN_ KHAN, J:- By invoking the
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199
of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973,
(the Constitution), Salamatullah, the petitioner, serving
the sentence ‘imprisonment for life’ in case FIR No.41
dated 14.06.2011, Police Station Anti Narcotics Force
(ANF), Peshawar, seeks issuance of an appropriate writ
directing the respondents to award/extend remissions in his
sentence, extended by the Prime Minister and the President
of Pakistan, the Chief Minister, Inspector General Prisons,
Superintendent Jail, on account of blood donation and good
conduct and released him on parole under the Good
Conduct Prisoners’ Probational Release Act, 1926.

2. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard

and record perused.
3. It appears from contents of the cited FIR, that
petitioner had been arrested on 14.06.2011 by the ANF
officials on allegation of recovery of huge quantity of
narcotics i.e. 48 Kgs chars and 14.100 Kgs opium, from
secret cavities of motorcar No.RIW.8044, driven by him at
the relevant time. He was tried and ultimately convicted
and sentenced as mentioned above, by the learned Special
Court (CNS), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and vide judgment
dated 18.10.2012. His appeals against conviction and
sentence before this Court as well the Hon’ble apex Court,
were dismissed, so his conviction and sentence have
attained finality.

4. When summoned, the respondents filed their
para-wise comments; according to which sentence of the
petitioner has been given effect since 16.06.2011 and his
probable date of release has been fixed as 09.11.2030. As
per comments, remissions in the sentence for which the
petitioner was entitled, have already been given to him in

the following way:-

S.No. | Name of Remission period

1. Labour Remission 16 months

2. Good conduct 04 Months & 15
days

3. 1.G. Spl. Remission 08 months

4. Blood remission 02 months

5. Supdt. Spl Remission 02 months

6. Provincial Govt Spl Remission 11 months

7. Education Remission 02 years.

Total Remission 68 months and 06

days

Remissions awarded to the petitioner in his sentence, as is
manifest from the table mentioned above, have not been
rebutted by the petitioner through any cogent and concrete
evidence. On the preceding date i.e. 27.11.2018, learned
counsel for the petitioner sought time to file rejoinder to
the comments. His request was acceded to but no re-joinder
has been filed, meaning thereby that the petitioner has
nothing to rebut the remissions awarded to him by the
respondents. In this view of the matter, the petitioner
having already been awarded remissions to which he was
entitled, his prayer for further remission is merely a bald
assertion on his part, therefore, the same is hereby turned
down.

5. Adverting to the next prayer of the petitioner that
that on account of his good conduct, he may be released on
parole under section 2 read with section 5 of the Good
Conduct Prisoner’s Probational Release Act, 1926 (to be
referred hereinafter as the Act of 1926). Firstly, remission
on account of good conduct has already been granted to the
petitioner. Secondly, bare reading of Preamble of the Act
of 1926, would reveal that powers with regard to
conditional release of a prisoner on account of good
conduct is solely vested with the Provincial Government.
According to section 2 of the Act of 1926, if it appears to
the Provincial Government from antecedents or conduct of

a prisoner in the prison that he is likely to abstain from
crime and lead useful and industrious life, the Provincial
Government may by license permit him to be released
subject to certain conditions enumerated therein. For the
sake of convenience and ready reference, sections 2 of the

Act of 1926, is reproduced below:-

“S.2 Notwithstanding anything contained in
section 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1898, where a person is confined in prison under
a sentence of imprisonment, and it appears to the
Provincial Government from his antecedents or
his conduct in the prison that he is likely to
abstain from crime and lead useful and
industrious life, if he is released from prison, the
Provincial Government may by license permit
him to be released on condition that he be placed
under the supervision or authority of a servant of
the state or a secular, institution or of a person or
society professing the same religion as the
prisoner, named in the license and willing to
take charge of him.

Provided that a prisoner convicted and
sentenced under any of the sections in Chapter

XVI of the Pakistan Penal Code (XLV of 1860)

shall not be released on parole without the
consent of the victim or as the case may be, his

heirs.
Explanation:- The expression “sentence of
imprisonment” in this section shall include
imprisonment in default of payment of fine and
imprisonment for failure to furnish security
under Chapter-VII of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898”.
Section 5 of the Act of 1926, speaks about the terms and
condition of the license granted under section 2 (ibid),
which is reproduced below:-

“S.5 A license granted under the provisions of

section 2 shall be in such form and shall contain
such conditions as the Provincial Government
may, by general or special order by rules made in

this behalf direct.”
The plain reading of section 2 of the Act of 1926 would

depict that it empowers only the Provincial Government to
release a person confined in prison under sentence of
imprisonment on account of his good conduct. Since the
petitioner has been convicted and sentenced under section
9 (c ) Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, therefore,
his case does not fall within the ambit of proviso attached
to section 2 of the Act of 1926. According to comments of
respondent No.3, the petitioner has served out 07 years 02
months and 20 days imprisonment of his substantive
sentence. Under the Act of 1926, the Government has
framed “the Good Conduct Prisoner’s Probational
Release Rules, 1927”, wherein under rule 9 “Classes of
offenders eligible for conditional release” have been given,
pursuant whereof, in case of life imprisonment exceeding
14 years, a prisoner can be released under section 2 of the
Act of 1926, provided he has served out ten years of the
substantive sentence excluding remission other than
educational remission. In this view of the matter, we are
confronted with two situations, both not favouring the
petitioner. Firstly, the petitioner has not served out 10
years of his substantive sentence so as to bring his case
within the ambit of rule 9 of “the Good Conduct

Prisoner’s Probational Release Rules, 1927”, and
secondly, power with regard to his release on parole on
account of good conduct is vested with the Provincial
Government, therefore, the petitioner having an
appropriate and efficacious remedy to approach the
Provincial Government for redressal of his grievance, he
cannot invoke the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court
under Article 199 of the Constitution. It is settled law that
a writ jurisdiction can only be invoked by an aggrieved
person who has no alternate and efficacious remedy for
redressal of his grievance under the law. In this view of the
matter, the instant writ petition to the extent of second
prayer of the petitioner is not maintainable, however, the
petitioner is at liberty to approach the proper forum for
redressal of his grievance under the Rules of 1927 (ibide),
if so advised.

6. For what has been discussed above, this writ
petition is disposed of accordingly.
