QAISER RASHID KHAN, J.- Through the instant petition, the
accused-petitioner seeks bail in case FIR No. 594 dated
17.07.2013 registered under Sections 302 / 324 / 34 PPC by
Police Station Tehkal, Peshawar after being denied the said
concession by the learned lower fora.

2. Briefly stated facts leading to the instant petition are that
the complainant Amjad while reporting the crime at the
Casualty of KTH alleged that a day before the occurrence a
quarrel took place between his deceased brothers namely,
Najeeb Khan & Kamal with the co-accused namely, Nazir &
Bashir and for the redressal of grievances of the parties he
alongwith his deceased brothers went to the shop of Zeeshan
where the accused-petitioner alongwith his co-accused namely,

Zeeshan, Nazir and Bashir duly armed with deadly weapons
were present and during conversation both the parties

exchanged hot words and then the accused-party started firing at

them and resultantly, his brothers were hit and died on the spot

while the complainant escaped unhurt, hence the FIR ibid.

3. The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the

accused-petitioner is innocent and has falsely been implicated in

the present case for ulterior motives; that no recovery

whatsoever has been effected from the accused-petitioner; that

the FSL report does not support the version of the complainant

and that there is no directed or circumstantial evidence against

the accused-petitioner on record to connect him with the

commission of offence, hence the accused-petitioner is entitled

to the concession of bail.

4. The learned AAG assisted by the learned counsel for the

complainant opposed the bail petition on the ground that the

accused-petitioner alongwith his co-accused have been directly

charged by the complainant for the murder of his two real

brothers. They next contended that the accused-petitioner was

arrested by the local police after about two years of the

occurrence when his bail before arrest application was turned

down by the learned lower court and that is how he is prima
facie connected with the commission of the offence, hence, the

accused-petitioner is not entitled to the grant of bail.

Arguments heard and the record perused.

5. As per the complainantâ€™s version, it was with a view to

settle a quarrel having taken place between his deceased

brothers namely, Najeeb and Kamal with the co-accused Nazeer

and Bashir when the parties assembled at the shop of co-

accused Zeeshan and it was there when during the course of

discussion, due to rush of blood, the accused-party fired at the

complainant party, resulting in the death of two brothers of the

complainant on the spot.

6. At the bail stage this court cannot go into the deeper

discussion on merits of the case. As such only a tentative

assessment of the available record is to be kept in view while

disposing of the present bail petition.

7. Though similar role of indiscriminating firing has been

attributed to the accused-petitioner as well as the absconding

co-accused, but from the spot only five empties of 30-bore

alongwith a spent bullet have been retrieved. As per the FSL

report, all the five empties have been fired from one and the

same 30-bore weapon which certainly raises a question as to
whether the unfortunate act is the doing of one person or more.

This factor alone takes the matter to one of further probe and in

the process entitling the accused-petitioner to the concession of

bail.

8. Accordingly, this petition for bail is allowed and the

petitioner is directed to be released on bail provided he

furnishes bail bond in the sum of rupees two lac (Rs.2,00,000/-)

with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of

the learned trial Judge / Illaqa / Judicial Magistrate, who shall

ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men of means.

Before parting with this order, it is directed that any

observations recorded in this order, being purely tentative in

nature, should in no way prejudice the proceedings before the

learned trial court where the case be decided strictly on its own

merits after recording evidence.

These are the detailed reasons for short order of the even

date.

Announced:
14.07.2015.
