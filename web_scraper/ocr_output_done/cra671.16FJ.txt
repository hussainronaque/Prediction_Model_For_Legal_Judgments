IJAZ_ ANWAR, J.- This Criminal Appeal has been
directed against the judgment dated 07.10.2016 passed by
learned Additional Sessions Judge-V, Kohat, whereby the
accused-respondent, Razeem, involved in case FIR No. 143
dated 11.5.2015, under section 302/34 PPC, registered at
Police Station, Jarma, was acquitted of the charge under
section 265-K Cr.P.C.

2. The backdrop of the case, as reflected from the
record, is that on 11.5.2012 Zahid Mehmood, lodged a
report in emergency room of KDA hospital, Kohat, to the
effect that he was present in the street near his house,
when, in the meanwhile, at 17.50 hours accused Muslim,
Zahoor, Razeem and Zarnam, came, who on seeing him,
started firing at him, due to which he was hit and received
injuries. The occurrence was stated to have been witnessed
by his brother Rehman Shah. Later on, he succumbed to
the injuries. The local police after registration of the case

submitted completed challan against all the four accused.

Accused Zahoor Khan faced the trial, while rest of the

accused absconded themselves. The learned trial Court
after conclusion of the trial, acquitted Zahoor, while rest of
the accused including the present accused-respondent were
declared as proclaimed offenders, vide judgment dated
6.2.2014. Later on, the present accused-respondent was
arrested and supplementary challan against him was
submitted before leaned Additional Sessions Judge-V,
Kohat. The learned trial Court after observing the legal
formalities within the meaning of Sec. 265- C, Cr.P.C,
framing charge, recording evidence of nine prosecution
witnesses and hearing the parties, acquitted the accused-
respondent under section 265-K Cr.P.C, vide judgment
dated 7.7.2016,hence, the present appeal.

3. Learned counsel for the appellant argued that
respondents No.1 has been charged in a promptly lodged
report and there is sufficient evidence in shape of direct as
well as circumstantial, including longstanding abscondance,
against him but in spite of that the trial Court acquitted him
under section 265- K Cr.P.C, therefore, the findings of the
trial Court are against the law and facts on record and
liable to be set aside.

4. We have heard learned counsel for the
appellant and perused the available record.

5. It is established from the record that four

persons, who are brothers inter se, have been charged for

\se

indiscriminate firing at the deceased, out of whom, accused
Zahoor, after conclusion of trial, has been acquitted by
leamed Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Kohat, vide
judgment dated 6.2.2014, against which no appeal has been
filed by the prosecution and, as such, has gained the
finality. It is also established from the record that the role
of the present appellant is similar to that of his co-accused,
who has been acquitted of the charge. Honourable, the
apex Court in a case titled Ghulam Sikandar and another
ys. Mamaraz Khan and others Khan (PLD 1985 S.C 11)
has laid down guiding principles in such eventualities and
has held that “When witnesses are disbelieved qua the acquitted

co-accused to whom same and similar role was attributed then they

shall not be relied upon with regard to the other co-accused unless
they are strongly corroborated by evidence coming from independent
source.” . This judgment of the apex court has repeatedly
been followed in number of judgments. Reference can be
made to 2002 SCMR 1855, 1996 SCMR 1742 and 2009
SCMR 946. Recently, the apex Court again reiterated the

same view in the case titled Irfan Ali vs. The State, (
2015 SCMR_ 840) and observed that “Whenever witnesses

were found to have falsely deposed with regard to the involvement of
one co-accused then, ordinarily, they could not be relied upon qua
the other co-accused unless their testimony was sufficiently
corroborated through strong corroboratory evidence, coming from
an unimpeachable source. Evidence of a witness was divisible,
however, pre-condition was that evidence of the same set of

witnesses may be rejected against some of the accused and it could

be relied upon with regard to the other set of the accused, provided it

fi

was getting strong independent corroboration from unimpeachable

source while recording conviction on a capital charges.

6. The record divulges that the instant case has

been registered on the report of deceased then injured. No

doubt, a statement of a deceased person in the form of an
F.LR. can be treated as a dying declaration under Article 46
of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, for sustaining conviction
on a capital charge, however, to make it basis for
conviction, the prosecution is required to establish, firstly,
that the dying man was in full senses, conscious and alert to
surrounding, was fully oriented in space and time and was
able to make a coherent statement, secondly, the dying
declaration rings true, thirdly, the doctor present at the
occasion shall give a fitness certificate about the condition

of the dying man but here in the instant case the doctor has

not given any certificate on the Mursilla to the effect that
the deceased then injured was conscious and could talk. The
report has been recorded by Bahadar Nawaz ASI but he has
not obtained any certificate from the doctor to the effect
that the deceased then injured was able to talk or otherwise.
Besides the above, the alleged dying declaration/Murasilla
has been made in present of his brother Rehman Shah,
therefore, his statement in presence of his relative is not
worthy of credence. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan

has laid down in the case of Nazim Khan and 2 others. v.

oN

5

The State (1984 _SCMR_1092) that Dying-declaration

recorded in presence of relatives of deceased would not be worthy of

credence. In the case of Mst. Zahida Bibi v. The State (PLD

2006 _SC_255) it was observed by the Hon’able supreme

Court that “dying declaration like the statement of an interested

witness require close scrutiny and that it was a weak kind of evidence

being without the test of cross examination”. In Farman Ahmad v.

Muhammad Inayat and another (2007 SCMR 1825) it was again

reiterated by the apex Court that such a declaration would require
close scrutiny and corroboration.

7. In the present case, Rehman Shah and Raza
Khan, claimed to have seen the occurrence, but as stated
earlier, their statements have already been disbelieved by
the learned trial Court in the previous trial, which judgment
has gained the finality. Yes, there is absconsion in the
account of respondent-accused but the same alone cannot
be made basis for conviction, therefore, learned trial court
has properly exercised its jurisdiction under the provision
of Section 265-K Cr.P.C as there is no prospect of the
accused being convicted of the charge levelled against him.
8. _ Apart from the above, it is by now a well settled
principle of criminal dispensation of justice that after
earning acquittal from the trial Court, double presumption
of innocence is acquired by an accused. The court while
sitting in appeal is always slow in reversing the judgment

of acquittal, unless it is found arbitrary, fanciful and

capricious on the face of it or is the result of bare

6
@ misreading or non reading of any material evidence. We,

therefore, do not feel persuaded to admit this appeal to
regular hearing, which would amount to an exercise in
futility and wastage of Court’s time. It is, thus, dismissed
in limine.
