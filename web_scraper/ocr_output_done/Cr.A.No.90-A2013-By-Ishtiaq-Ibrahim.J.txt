ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- Abdullah Nasir alias Junejo,

appellant, has called in question the judgment dated
27.06.2013 delivered by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-IV, Mansehra whereby he was convicted under
Section 302 (b) PPC and sentenced to death. In addition to
the above, the appellant was also burdened to pay
compensation amount of Rs.3,00,000/-, payable to the legal

heirs of the deceased under Section 544-A Cr.P.C,
recoverable as arrears of tind revenue and in default to
suffer further six (06) months S.I.

2. Zakir Mehmood and Abdul Wahid, who were
charged for catching hold of the deceased Saqib Rasheed
and Wagas respectively, were acquitted through the same
judgment, impugned herein, therefore, the complainant
Abdul Rasheed has preferred an appeal against their
acquittal, thus, through this single judgment, we intend to
decide this and the connected Cr.Appeal No. 93-A/2013
titled “Abdur Rasheed Vs. ‘The State & 02 others” being
the outcome of one and same impugned judgment.

3. Case of the prosecution is that Abdur Rasheed (PW-
7) in the company of dead bodies of deceased (Saqib
Rasheed & Waqas) reported the incident to Imtiaz Ahmad,
ASI (PW-10) on 28.02.2010 at King Abdullah Teaching
Hospital, Mansehra to the effect that on the fateful day at
17:00 hours he alongwith his brother-in-law, Abdul Nazeer
(PW-8) were coming to the house of complainant, situated

‘
at Timber Khola, and when reached the place oF
occurrence, he saw his son Sagib Rasheed and his nephew
Wagqas (both deceased), grappling with the appellant and
his other three (03) companions namely, Zakir (acquitted

co-accused), Ramzan (absconding co-accused) and Abdul

Wahid (acquitted co-accused), It has further been alleged in

the report that his son Saqib Rasheed was caught hold by

Zakir while his nephew was caught hold by Abdul Wahid

whereas the appellant and absconding co-accused namely,

Ramzan both gave Churi blows to the victims respectively,

with which they fell on the ground while the accused

decamped from the spot. Motive for crime was stated to be

that accused were suspecting one of the deceased Le.

neers aware Be

Waaqas to have relations with their cousin.

4. After authoring murasila (Ex.PA), Imtiaz Ahmad

(PW-10) sent the same to police station through Constable

Muhammad Ashraf, whereupon the ibid FIR was
i)

registered. The case was investigated and_ thereafter,

el heey cre pga eo ee:

challan was submitted before the learned trial court, who

formally indicted the appellant alongwith the acquitted cc-

aa

Ass

accused, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial

while absconding co-accused was proceeded against under

a Were a OE

Section 512 Cr.P.C, thus the impugned judgment was

is

f rendered by the learned trial court.

4 5 Leamed counsel for the appellant argued that

iE impugned judgment of conviction is illegal and not in

ia

i accordance with law as crucial features of the case are

4 speculator and imaginary rather than on a solid tenable
; : evidence; that the prosecution introduced the report outside
: F the police station ie. in the shape of murasila, which

i always creates doubt regarding the false involvement and

4 fabricatine the story as laid down by the apex court; that

; § y y P'

: there is delay in lodging the report as the occurrence
i f alleged to have taken place on 28" February, 2010 at 17:00
f hours while the report was made at 18:45 hours and

thereafter the case was registered at 23:40 hours in the

police station, which is at a distance of hardly 10 / 11

a
ry ;
kilometers from the place of occurrence and 15 kilometers

f

from King Abdullah Teaching Hospital, Mansehra; that the

report was not lodged in the reporting center of King
Abdullah Teaching Hospital rather the complainant waited
till arrival of the local police from Police Station Khaki,
which clearly indicates that there was sufficient time which
lapsed between the alleged time of occurrence and report
and in this period, the prosecution fabricated the story and
involved the appellant in commission of the offence, which
of course looses the evidentiary value; that though both the
alleged eye witnesses i.e. Pw-7 and PW-8 were shown to
have been present at the time of occurrence but their names
were omitted from the inquest report which manifests that
they were not present at the time of alleged occurrence,
being not cited as witnesses till the time of preparation of
inquest report, besides being not shown witnesses at the
time of autopsy and that both the eyewitnesses, being
closely related to the deceased, did not receive a single
scratch in the alleged incident nor they tried to rescue the

deceased from the clutches of the accused, thus, it appears
' 64

b> .

: .

7 that they were not present at the spot and the occurrence is

h an unseen one.

bi
: i 6. To the contrary, learned counsel for the complainant
fi as well as Additional Advocate General opposed the
i contentions of the learned counsel for the appellant tooth
| i and nail and submitted that the appellant has directly been
H charged for commission of the offence in a report made
3

with promptitude; that the presence of the eye witnesses

has been duly established. That there is no background of

blood feud between the parties, the witnesses can be well

regarded as disinterested witnesses. They further contended

that it’s a double murder case and the appellant alongwith

his acquitted co-accused remained fugitive from law for

sufficient time, thus the learned trial court has rightly held

the present appellant responsible for commission of the
offence while the evidence against the acquitted co-accused
has wrongly been disbelieved and prayed for reversal of

their acquittal into conviction.

corceraesaus

In cases where the charge against accused is based
on ocular account, it is the bounden duty of the prosecution
to establish the presence of the eyewitnesses at the relevant
time beyond the shadow of reasonable doubt. Whether the
testimony of the cyewitnesses qualifies the test of common
human conduct and the course of natural events or
probabilities.

8. In the present case the ocular account was furnished
by Abdur Rasheed (PW-7) who is father of deceased Saqib
Rasheed and uncle of Waqas while PW-8 Abdul Nazir is
the brother-in-law of complainant. Their stance as divulged
from FIR that on the relevant day complainant has gone to
village Barballa to visit his brother-in-law PW Abdul Nazir
and while on their way back from the house of Abdul

Nazir, when they reached the place of occurrence, the

incident occurred within their sight and presence. It is very

strange that the distance between the village of Abdul Nazir

i.e. Barballa and that of complainant is four kilometers. The

purpose of the visit has not been disclosed by the

Scat eres aie tne 22 QT AS ARO EE ARNE Pe TE, ITEM ERT LAE NO IR OT
oo ca as renee acini, eM EET GTN
ot eerinteree Sak esif rea

RP NT ory

complainant as for what he had gone to the village Barballa

while PW Abdul Nazir is also mute regarding this aspect of

the case.

%

9. It is also repellant to the common sense that the

moment complainant and PW-8 reached the place of

occurrence from village Barballa which is situated at a

distance of four kilometers, the tragedy occurred in their

presence. The complainant (PW-7) has admitted in his

cross-examination that “it is correct that if per chance I

would not have come ta the place, I would have not

witness the occurrence”, Similarly, PW-8 has also stated
that “it is correct that if I was not coming to village

Timber Khola I would not have seen the occurrence”.
Both these witnesses are aged persons as complainant is
aged about 60/61 years while PW-8 is aged about 50/51
years, which does aot appeal to a prudent mind that they
would travel a distance of four kilometers by foot rather

they would have definitely hired a vehicle for covering

such a long distance. If the complainant visited the house of
the PW-8, what was the justification of PW-8 to
accompany the complainant to his village, we are unable to
find anything from the record which justifies the above
controversy.

10, Prosecution case is that both the witnesses were
present when their nears and dears were slayed in their
immediate presence, but it is not appealing to rcason they
are neither trying to interfere in the grappling / fight nor
rescuing the deceased from the clutches of accused, instead
they are standing there like silent spectators. Moreover,
after the tragedy they did not bother to apprehend the
accused or even tried to forbid them from the commission
of the offence, inspite of the fact that one was the father of
one of the deceased and the other was close blood relative,
more particularly when the accused were not armed with
any firearms as the case of prosecution is that the accused
were cquipped with knives only. This aspect of the case
pricks the judicial mind of the court regarding the presence

of the eyewitnesses at the relevant time.

ll.
dealing with almost similar situation in the case of Shahzad

Tanveer Vs. The State reported as 2012 SCMR 172 has

The Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan while

held as under: -

while confronted with same proposition, involved in this

“According to the prosecution, the
appellant, his father Tanveer Ahmed and
mother Mst. Irshad Begum had gone
upstairs and assaulted Mst. Kaneez
Akhtar. It is strange that none of the
accused carried any weapon except a
small kitchen knife, the total length and
width of which was "6-1/2 x 1/2"
including its handle while going to
commnit a capital offence. It is also more
strange that none of the P.Ws. dared to
physically intervene in order to save the
victim or apprehend the accused at the
spot. Neither the clothes of any P.W. got
stained with blood nor had they received
any scratch on their persons. In this view
of the matter the presence of the P.Ws. at
the time of occurrence appears to be

doubtful.”

In addition to the above, the Indian Supreme Court

‘
appeal, in a reported case titled “Meharaj Singh Vs. State of

U.P” 1995 PSC (Crl.) 727 has held as under.

“During — her cross-examination — she
admitted that she teak no steps to save her

husband hy either falling on her husband

or faking the assault on herself. She
admitted that she did not even receive a
Scratch during the entire occurrence and
her clothes neither Sot torn nor even got

Stained with blood”.

13. The arrival of the witnesses at that point of time

from a place situated at a distance of four kilometers would
make them chance witnesses, as they have already admitted
in their cross-examination that they arrived at the place of
occurrence per chance otherwise they would have not
witnessed the occurrence with their own eyes.

14. In the case of “Abid Ali & 02 others Vs. The State”
reported as 2011 SCMR 268 the apex court while
disbelieving the eyewitness account of the witnesses has
held as under: -

“We have thoroughly discussed the

Statements af two eye-witnesses claiming

to be present at the scene of crime but

4

A

they on their own'admissions were chance
witnesses and have admitted their enmity
with the appellants. Both these witnesses
could not reasonably explain — their
presence with the deceased Muhammad
Azam rather their conduct runs against
the natural behaviour of normal human,
therefore, their testimonies appear to be
unbelievable in the circumstances of the

case.”

1S. Murasila was drafted in the instant case at 12:45
hours wherein the time of occurrence has been mentioned
as 17:00 hours but if we go through the FIR, the formal FIR
was chalked out at police station at 23:40 hours ie. round
about five hours of the alleged report which was made in
the hospital for which there is no reasonable justification
which would not appeal to the mind of this court to treat the
report of complainant as a genuine document.

16. | Motive for the crime was stated to be relation of the
deceased (Waqas) with the cousin of accused party but
there is nothing on record to suggest that the motive alleged

by the prosecution was taken to its logical end by
fuicieacomn2ia ie

Te

producing some tangible evidence. Moreover, nothing
incriminating has been recovered by the investigating
agency during the course Of interrogation which could

if

prove the involvement of the appellant with the
commission of the offence.

17. hough the record divulges that the appellant
remained fugitive trom law and proceedings against him
were carried out under Sections 204 / 87 / 88 Cr.P.C but
because we disbclieved the ocular account and. other
circumstantial pieces of evidence, therefore, mere
abscondence would not entail penal consequences against
the appellant.

18. It is settled principle of law that for extending
benefit of doubt to an accused person, it is not essential
that there should be bundle of doubts rather a single doubt,
if found reasonable for a prudent mind, would entitle the
accused to the benefit of it and would be entitled to

acquittal.

19. In the case of “Muhammad Ilyas Vs. The State”

reported as 1997 SCMR 25 the Hon’ble Supreme Court of

Pakistan has held as under: -

“It is well settled principle of law that
where evidence creates doubt about the
truthfulness of prosecution story, benefit of
such a doubt had to be given to the accused

without any reservation”

20. The above view has further been strengthened by the
Hor’ble Apex Court in the case of “Muhammad Khan &
another Vs. The State” reported as 1999 SCMR._ 1220 by
holding that “conviction must be based on impeachable
evidence and certainty of guilt and any doubt arising in
the prosecution case must be resolved in favour of the
accused,”

21. Judged and considered from all angles and keeping
in view the combined study & careful reappraisal of the
entire evidence in thé) above manner, we are of the
considered view that the prosecution has failed to prove the
guilt of appellant beyond any shadow of doubt thus,

extending him the benefit of doubt, he deserves acquittal.
