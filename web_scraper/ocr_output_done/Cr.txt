KAMRAN HAYAT MIANKHEL, J.- Petitioner, Anyi
Sundy alias Joe, a Nigerian National, who is detained in
FIR No. 19/2020 dated 24.02.2020 registered against
him under Sections 409 / 419 / 420 / 468 / 471 / 406 /
109 PPC read with section 5 (2) Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1947 and 3 / 4 of Anti Money
Laundering Act, 2010 at police station, FIA ACC
Abbottabad, has approached this Court for admitting
him to bail on statutory delay till final conclusion of trial.
2. The facts of the case, in brief, are that
complainant, Shoaib Akhtar Qureshi, Regional
Executive NBP and Abdur Rashid, AVP Head NBP
Regional Office Abbottabad reported the matter to the

local police to the effect that Jehangir Khan was posted
as Manager National Bank of Pakistan, Khanaspur
Ayubia Branch Abbottabad; During usual review of the
branch ledger on 13.02.2020, he observed irregularity in
“cash in hand” and “adjusting account other’ GLs. An
internal enquiry was conducted, which showed cash
shortage of Rs.119,100,715/- and unauthorized debit to
adjusting of account of Rs. 20,900,000/- was also
detected on 17.02.2020. After detailed inquiry, case was
registered against the Branch Manager, Cashier
including the present petitioner/accused for the offences
of embezzlement, cheating, fraud and money
laundering, hence, the ibid FIR.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for the
petitioner and learned Assistant Attorney General heard
at length and record perused.

4. Perusal of record reveals that accused/
petitioner was arrested in this case on 05.08.2020 and
since then he is in continuous detention and the trial has
not yet been concluded. Before the bail petition in
hand, the petitioner has not moved any application for
grant of bail even on merits. In this petition, the
petitioner sought his bail on statutory ground and also
pressed into service the principle of consistency. It is
evident from the record that while dismissing bail

applications on merit filed by co-accused involved in the
case, the prosecution was directed to submit complete
challan against them within ten (10) days from the date
of receipt of order and the trial Court was directed to
conclude the trail within four (04) months. However, the
record reflects that the challan was given against the
petitioner on 08.12.2020 and provisions of section 265-
C Cr.P.C, were complied with on 05.04.2021, charge
was framed on 10.07.2021 and P.Ws, i.e. forty-four (44)
witnesses, were summoned, however, not a single
witness could be examined till date.

5. In order to convince the Court to deny bail
on statutory delay, the prosecution must show that there
was a concerted effort by the accused or his counsel to
delay the conclusion of the trial by “seeking
adjournments_ without sufficient cause on _ crucial
hearings” or by “making frivolous miscellaneous
applications” and there exists some material to show
that the accused would pose a serious threat to the
society if set free on bail.

6. It is obvious from record that the statutory
period mentioned in fifth proviso has expired and
conclusion of trial is not expected in near future as no
progress could take place in the case in hand despite
clear direction issued by this Court while disposing of

bail petitions of co-accused. It depicts from record that
delay, if any, in concluding the trial cannot be ascribed
to the petitioner or anyone acting on his behalf.
Furthermore, the second exception to the right of the
accused to be released on bail on the ground of delay in
conclusion of the trial was provided in the sixth proviso
to section 497 Cr.P.C. According to the sixth proviso,
the provisions of the fifth proviso do not apply to the
accused who is a convicted offender for an offence
punishable with death or imprisonment for life; or a
hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal in the
opinion of the Court; or an accused of an act of
terrorism punishable with death or imprisonment for life.
Additionally, the prosecution has not placed on record
before the Court to indicate that the petitioner is
hardened, desperate or dangerous criminals or
previously convicted persons for an offence punishable
with death or imprisonment for life or persons involved
in the act of terrorism. As held earlier by this Court
while disposing of the bail petitions of co-accused,
namely, Marvellours Amechi and Patrick Osandu
Nzogawa alias Dr. Ibrahim that ‘mere allegation of
involvement of the petitioners in financial corruption,
which is yet to be proved during trial, could not be
sufficient to hold them as hardened or desperate

criminals’. Therefore, in my opinion, the prosecution
could not convince this Court on above mentioned
crucial issues involved in the present case, thus, in the
absence of any such material, bail cannot be denied to
an accused on the statutory ground of delay in
conclusion of the trial. Besides, the petitioner is also
entitled to be released on bail on the principle of
consistency as the co-accused having similar role, have
already been released on statutory ground of delay.

7. Under these circumstances, it is held that
the statutory right to be released on bail flowed from the
constitutional right to liberty and fair trial under Articles 9
and 10A of the Constitution. The act or omission on the
part of the accused to delay the timely conclusion of the
trial must be the result of a visible concerted effort
orchestrated by the accused. The purpose and objective
of the provision was to ensure that the trial of an
accused was conducted expeditiously and the pre-
conviction detention of an accused did not extend
beyond the period of one year, in cases involving
offences not punishable with death. In such cases, if the
trial of an accused is not concluded within a year of his
detention, the statutory right to be released on bail
ripens in his favour. In this context, reliance can well be
placed on the judgments reported as ‘Amir v. The

State’ (PLD1972 SC 277), ‘Abdul Hakeem Khan v.
The State’ (1981 P.Cr.L.J 607), ‘Raheem Bux and
others v. The State’(PLD 1986 Karachi 224), ‘Aijaz
Ahmad v. Tasawar Hyder’ (1988 P.Cr.L.J 1408) and
‘Abdul Rehman v. The State’ (1978 P.Cr.L.J 589).
8. For the foregoing reasons, this petition is
allowed and petitioner is admitted to bail, subject to his
furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.20,00,000/-(Two
Millions) with three sureties, each in the like amount to
the satisfaction of the learned Special Judge (Offences
in respect of Banks) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar,
who shall ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and
men of means, besides surrendering their passports
before the FIA authorities and their name shall be placed
on Exit Control List (ECL) and shall not be allowed to
depart from Pakistan.

Above are the reasons for short order of this
Court of even date.

Announced:
Dt.14.03.2022.
