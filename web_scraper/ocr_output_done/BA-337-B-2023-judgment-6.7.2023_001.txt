36 2 oe OR

FAZAL SUBHAN, J.--- Instant is  a__ bail

application of petitioner Taj Ali Khan s/o Mughal
Khan r/o Darwiash Khel Banda Daud Shah, Tehsil
and District Karak, who is seeking his post-arrest
bail in connection with case F.LR No.290 dated
30.05.2023 u/s 489-F P.P.C, Police Station, Karak
city, District Karak.

2. On the application of complainant, Arab
Gul advocate, an inquiry into the issuance of two

cheques were conducted by the local police of
Police Station, Karak city and after getting legal
opinion from District Public Prosecutor concerned,
case in hand was registered. It was contention of
the complainant that he has friendly relationship
with the petitioner Taj Ali Khan, a contractor by
profession and at the need he used to extend
financial help to him and in this way an amount of
Rs.25,00,000/- (Twenty five lacs) was out-standing
against him. On his demand, the petitioner Taj Ali
Khan handed over two cheques valuing
Rs.900,000/- (nine Lacs) and another of
Rs.11,80,000/- (eleven lacs and eighty thousand)
which were presented in the bank for encashment
but these were returned by the Manager on the plea
that Taj Ali Khan has refused to encash the said
cheques. Accordingly on the report of
complainant, case in hand was registered.

3. After arrest, the petitioner applied for
bail in the court of Judicial Magistrate-IV, Karak,
and then in the court of learned Additional
Sessions Judge-I, Karak, but his bail applications
were dismissed, hence, he filed the instant bail

petition.
4. Arguments of learned counsel for
petitioner and learned counsels for complainant
assisted by the learned AAG heard and record
gone through.

5. After hearing arguments of both the
learned counsel for the parties and without dilating
upon deep merits of the case, it is clear that
offence u/s 489-F P.P.C, provides maximum
punishment for three years and, therefore, it does
not fall within the prohibitory limb of section
497(i) Cr.P.C, and in such like offences grant of
bail is a rule and refusal an exception. This
principle is discussed and elaborated by the
superior Courts in plethora of judgments. In the
case of “Jehanzeb Khan V. The State through
Additional Advocate General Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa” reported in 2020 SCMR 1268 and
“Tariq Bashir and 05 others V. The State” (PLD
1995 SC 34), the august Court has held that “bail
in cases not falling within the prohibitory clause
will be declined/refused only in extraordinary and
exceptional circumstances”. In another case titled
“Muhammad Tanveer Vs The State and another”

(PLD 2017 SC 733), the august Court held that:-
"6. We are shocked and
disturbed to observe that in cases of
this nature, not falling within the
prohibition contained in section 497,
Cr.P.C., invariably grant of bail is
refused on flimsy grounds. This
practice should come to an end
because the public, particularly
accused persons charged for such
offences are unnecessarily burdened
with extra expenditure and this
Court is heavily taxed because leave
petitions in hundreds are piling up in
this Court and the diary of the Court
is congested with such like petitions.
This phenomenon is growing
tremendously, thus, cannot be lightly
ignored as precious time of the Court
is wasted in disposal of such
petitions. This Court is purely a
constitutional Court to deal with
intricate questions of law and
Constitution and to lay down guiding
principle for the Courts of the
country where law points require
interpretation."

In the case of “Rao Ghulam Mustafa V.
The State and another” (2023 P.Cr.L.J 499), in

identical matter, it has been held:-

Sé

"6. The maximum punishment of
offence provided under section
489-F, P.P.C. is not more than
imprisonment for three years or
fine or both, as such, the same is
not covered by the prohibition
contained in subsection (1) of
section 497, Cr.P.C. In view of the
dictum laid down in Tariq Bashir
and 5 others v. The State - PLD
1995 SC 34, in  non-bailable
offences falling in the second
category i.e. punishable with
imprisonment for less than ten
years, the grant of bail is a rule
and refusal an exception. No
exceptional circumstances could be
pointed out by the learned
prosecutor as well as the learned
counsel for the complainant, as
enumerated in Tariq Bashir supra.
Further wisdom can be extracted
jrom the cases titled Muhammad
Tanveer v. The State - PLD 2017
Supreme Court 733 and Abdul
Saboor v. The State through A.G.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and another -

2022 SCMR 592."

6. For all the above reasons, there is no
doubt that offence u/s 489-F P.P.C, is not covered
by the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) Cr.P.C,
and in ordinary circumstances, bail is granted to
the accused who has allegedly given a cheque for
encashment but has been dishonored either due to
insufficient amount or any other reason.

7. It has been argued by the learned
counsel for petitioner that the petitioner is a
contractor and the amount was advanced as a share
in the business and this process continued for the
last more than a decade and the cheques were
issued in respect of the business transaction, hence,
the necessary ingredient of handing-over the
cheques dishonestly is not attracted to the case of
petitioner because the same were neither
dishonestly given nor there was intention to
knowingly defraud the complainant, thus, in this

situation the cheques were only guaranty cheques.
Ai

In this view of the matter, it is yet to be established
during trial as to whether parties had any business
transaction as well as the nature of the cheques
advanced to the complainant and this fact also
makes the case of petitioner one of further inquiry
into his guilt.

8. For the above mentioned reasons, the
instant petition is allowed and_ the
accused/petitioner is admitted to bail in the instant
case subject to furnishing bail bonds of
Rs.10,00,000/- (ten lacs) with two sureties each in
the like amount, to the satisfaction of the learned
Illaqa Judicial Magistrate/MOD, concerned. The

sureties must be local, reliable and men of means.

9. These are the detailed reasons of the
short order of the even date.
Announced.
