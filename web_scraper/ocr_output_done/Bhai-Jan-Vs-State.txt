ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- Petitioner Bhai Jan, seeks
post arrest bail in case FIR No.384 dated 21.05.2012,
registered under sections 302/496-B/109/34 PPC, in Police
Station Nisatta.

2. The prosecution case as set forth in the FIR is that
on 21.05.2012 at about 800 hours, Faqir Jan ASI, on
receipt of information about the occurrence rushed to the
spot and found the dead body of deceased Ijaz lying there.
Asfand Yar, complainant present at the spot reported him
to the effect that on 20.05.23012, the deceased left his
house, but did not return till evening. He was searched, but
could not be traced and on 21.05.2012, his dead body was
found in the poplar trees standing in the fields of one

Sadigeen. He disclosed that he having no enmity with
anybody; did not charge any one by name and will charge
the actual culprit (s) on satisfaction. On 4.06.2012, he
recorded his statement under section 164 Cr.P.C., wherein
he charged present petitioner and co-accused Mst. Nodia
Begum (widow of the deceased), for the occurrence, hence,
this case.

3. Having heard the arguments of learned counsel for
the parties, it appears from the record that the occurrence is
unseen. Though, complainant has directly nominated the
petitioner along with co-accused for commission of the
offence in his statement under section 164 Cr.P.C., but he
has not disclosed the source on the basis of which he got
satisfied about complicity of the petitioner in the
commission of offence. No doubt, co-accused Mst. Nodia
had recorded her confessional statement wherein she while
disclosing about her illicit relation with the present
petitioner has attributed the role of murder of the deceased
to the petitioner on her instigation, but it appears from the
record that this Court while deciding her appeal against
conviction by not believing her confessional statement has
recorded her acquittal vide judgment dated 09.04.2014.
Though, under the provisions of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984, confessional statement of an accused against
co-accused is to be considered as a circumstance, but when
the confessional statement of co-accused Mst. Nodia has

not been believed by this Court and there is no direct and
circumstantial evidence against the petitioner, whether the
prosecution would be able to prove the guilt of the
petitioner is a debatable question which makes his case
arguable for the purpose of bail. The petitioner has not
confessed his guilt before the competent Court of law nor
any incriminating articles to link him with the commission
of offence has been recovered from his direct or indirect
possession. Investigation against the petitioner is complete
and he is no more required for further interrogation. In this
view of the matter on merit, he is entitled to the concession
of bail. As regard abscondance of the petitioner, it has
been held by the august Apex Court in case titled, “Qamar
alias Mitho Vs The State and others” (PLD 2012
Supreme Court 222) that right of bail cannot be refused to
accused merely on account of his/her abscondance which is
a factor relevant only to propriety. Moreover, it has been
held by the august apex Court in cases of “Ibrahim v.
Hayat Gul and others” (1985 SCMR 382) and
“Muhammad Sadiq V Sadiq and others” (PLD 1985 SC
182) that in a case calling for further inquiry into the guilt
of an accused person bail is to be allowed to the accused as
of right and such right cannot be refused merely on account
of abscondance of accused. Same view has been reiterated
in case titled, “Ikram ul Haq Vs Raja Naveed Sabir and

others” (2012 SCMR 1273).
4. For the reason discussed above, this petition is
allowed. Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he
furnishes bail bonds in the sum of rupees two lace with two
local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD concerned.
