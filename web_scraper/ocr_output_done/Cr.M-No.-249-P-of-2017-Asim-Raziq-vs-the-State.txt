ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- This common order shall
dispose of instant bail application, filed by petitioner Asim
Raziq and connected Cr.Misc.BA No.250-P/2017, filed by
petitioner Mst. Noreen, as both arise out from one and the
same FIR No.46 dated 15.02.2011, registered under
sections 365-B/494 PPC, in Police Station Regi, District
Peshawar.

2. According to report of complainant Ayaz Khan on
15.02.2011, while he was present in his shop, situated in
Gul Haji Plazq, University road, was informed by his
father about missing of his wife Mst. Noreen, so he rushed
to his house and found his wife missing leaving her minor
kids Mst. Sumbal and Mst. Gulalay aged 3 years and 13
months, respectively at her house. He was in search of his
wife, when came to know that she has been enticed away
by Asim and his companions for the purpose of marriage.
Hence, this case.

3. Having heard the arguments of learned counsel for

the parties, the marriage of Mst. Noreen with the
2
complainant has not been denied by both the petitioners,

however, the stance of petitioner counsel is that Mst.
Noreen was divorced by the complainant whereafter she
entered into Nikah with petitioner Asim Raziq. The
petitioners have produced Nikah Nama to the I.O. which is
available on file. Perusal of the Nikah Nama reveals that in
column “whther the bride is virgin or divorced word
“virgin has been mentioned. It does not find any mention
of dower of either kind as well as any CNIC number of the
witnesses and Nikah Khawan. Similarly, none of the
witnesses named in the Nikah Nama have came forward in
support of the stance of the petitioners. The date of
marriage mentioned in the Nikah Nama is 03.01.2010,
which is the date of birth of Mst. Gulalay (the minor
daughter of complainant). Nothing is available on the
record suggestive of the fact regarding alleged divorce of
the petitioner Mst. Noreen by the complainant. Record
depict that the accused Mst. Noreen has left her house on
15.2.2011 and on the same date the complainant has
reported the matter to local police. Had she been divorced
by the complainant prior to the day of occurrence, she
would have left the abode of her in-laws on the day of
alleged divorce and would have not stayed with
complainant thereafter. It is manifest from the record that
she has left the house of her husband with her paramour,

Asim Raziq and has got settled with him during
3
subsistence of her marriage with complainant, so

much so, has given birth to two children namely Abuzar
(boy) and Roma (girl) from the alleged wedlock with co-
accused Asim Raziq. Sufficient evidence has been
collected during investigation by the I.O. in support of the
stance of the complainant to show their prima facie
involvement in a case of elopement during subsistence of
marriage of accused Mst. Noreen with complainant. The
plea of subsequent Nikah seems fallacious on the face of it,
hence the grant of bail to both the accused and allowing
them to live as husband and wife in a situation, particularly
when the Nikah of accused/petitioner Mst. Noreen with the
complainant still exists, would result in an odd situation
and shall create further complications.

4. On tentative assessment of the material on record,
the above observed circumstances prima facie connect the
petitioner with the commission of offence, which is of
moral turpitude and shall affect the entire society, hence, I
am not inclined to exercise the discretion of bail in their

favour. Resultantly, both the petitions stand dismissed.
