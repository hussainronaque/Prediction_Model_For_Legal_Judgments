or to suffer further six months S.I in case of default
thereof. Benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C was

extended to him.

The appellant/convict has challenged
his conviction and sentence through this appeal
whereas the complainant has filed the connected
Cr.R No. 08-M/2018 seeking enhancement of the
sentence awarded to the convict by learned trial
Court. Both the cases, being inter connected and
emanating from the same judgment, are decided

through this judgment.

2. The occurrence took place on
21.12.2015 at 10:30 hours in the lumberyard of
Bashir Ullah (PW-14) situated near High School
Dherai Kanjoo which was reported by complainant
Qashqaray Khan (PW-2) on the same day at 12:25
hours in casualty room of Saidu Sharif hospital.
According to the report, the complainant received
telephonic information that his cousin Bakht Zamin
Khan has been wounded by someone and he is being
shifted to Saidu Sharif hospital, therefore, he should
come to hospital hurriedly. On arrival to hospital, he

was informed that his cousin (deceased) was sitting

in the lumberyard whereas his friend Muhammad

Islam (the present appellant whose name was later
on corrected as Noor Islam) was roaming there. In
the meanwhile at 10:30 hours, the appellant
suddenly attacked his cousin with axe due to which
he sustained injury on his head and became
unconscious. The occurrence was stated to have
been witnessed by Habib-ur-Rehman (PW-3) and
several other persons present in the wood-stock. The
complainant, however, could not disclose any

motive at the time of lodging the report.

3. Hazrat Ali ASI (PW-5) recorded repot
of the complainant in Murasila (Ex.PW-5/3) and
sent the same to P.S Kanju for registration of FIR.
Amjad Ghafoor ASI (PW-1), on receipt of Murasila,
chalked out formal FIR (Ex.PA). The injured was
initially examined by Dr. Fazal Amin (PW-11) on
21.12.2015 who issued report Ex.PW-11/1 regarding

consciousness of the injured which is as follows:

I examined Mr. Bakht Zamin s/o Kashmir Khan
R/O Koza Bandai. He is semi-conscious and
unable to give statements.

The aforesaid doctor (PW-11) also

prepared his report Ex.PW-11/2 which is as under:

Crushed lacerated wound on left parieto-occipital
region. Wound is skin/muscles deep. The under-
lying skull bone is crushed with brain matter
oozing out of skull. Wound is profusely bleeding.

The injured died 08.01.2016 in HMC,
Peshawar. On receipt back of dead body, autopsy
was conducted by Dr. Muhammad Iqbal (PW-10).

His opinion as per report Ex.PW-10/1 is as follows.

Wound:

Already healed wound on the top of scalp 4 inch
long. Scalp fracture old present. Barain vessels
ruptured. Scalp fracture.

Remarks by Medical Officer

Skull fracture caused head injury, which resulted in
death.

Cause of death: Severe head injury.
Probable time that elapsed:

(a) Between injury and death: 16-18 days.

(b) Between Death and Postmortem: 1-2 days.
4. The appellant was arrested on
23.12.2015. The matter was investigated by Javed
Iqbal ASI (PW-12). After completion of
investigation, complete challan was put in Court
where the appellant was formally charge-sheeted for
the offence to which he did not plead guilty and
opted to face the trial. Prosecution produced as many
as fifteen PWs in support of its case and closed the
evidence. When examined u/s 342, Cr.P.C, the

appellant denied the allegation of prosecution and

0B: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wicar Ahmad
ee Mee TT

Tajamut/os*|

-5-

stated to have been charged in a false case, however,
he neither recorded his own statement on oath nor
produced any witness in his defence. On conclusion
of trial, the learned trial Court vide impugned
judgment convicted and sentenced the appellant in
the manner already discussed in the earlier part of
this judgment. Hence, this appeal and the connected

revision petition.

5. We have heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the parties including the learned A.A.G
for State and gone through the record with their able

assistance.

6. It is the case of prosecution against the
present appellant that he gave axe blow to deceased .
Bakht Zamin Khan in the woodstock of Bashir Ullah
(PW-14). Ocular account in the present case has
been furnished by Habib Ullah (PW-3), Hakim
Ullah (PW-4) and Muhammad Hussain (PW-7)
whereas complainant Qashqaray Khan was

examined as PW-2.

All the eye witnesses have unanimously
stated that the present appellant and deceased Bakht
Zamin came to the wood-stock on motorcycle. They

asked for a space in the lumberyard for installation

O68: Hon'ble Mr. Justice ishtlag Ibrahim
‘bl q ar Ah

Lot Ble ae Be

-6-
of saw-machine, however, the PWs replied them to
consult the owner Bashir Ullah in this regard.
Thereafter the appellant and deceased went ahead in
the wood-stock while the PWs continued their work
of splitting/cutting the wood. In the meanwhile they
heard ‘Aah’ and saw the deceased falling on the
ground whereas the appellant rode on the motorcycle
and decamped from the spot. On getting closer to the
deceased they found him injured with an axe lying

near him.

Presence of the three eye witnesses on
the spot cannot be doubted because they were
working in the same wood-stock as laborers which
fact has been confirmed by Bashir Ullah (PW-14),
owner of the wood-stock, in his statement. The first
objection which was raised by learned counsel for
the appellant during the course of arguments was
that name of none of the eye witnesses has been
mentioned in the FIR. The record transpires that
name of PW Habib Ullah has been mentioned as
Habib-ur-Rehman in the FIR, however, the same
mistake appears to be inadvertent because father
name in both the cases has been mentioned as
Sarzamin. Moreso, the report was lodged by

complainant Qashqaray on the basis of information

he had received from PW Habib Ullah. The
complainant is neither eye witness of the occurrence
nor resident of the area where the occurrence had
taken place rather he was residing in Rahim Abad
Mingora at the relevant time and had followed the
deceased then injured to hospital on receipt of phone
call from PW Habib Ullah. Thus mentioning the
name of PW Habib Ullah as Habib-ur-Rehman and
non-mentioning the names of other eye witnesses in
the FIR by complainant is not fatal to the
prosecution case in view of the above stated

circumstances.

Zz. It is a case of single accused and all the
eye witnesses have recorded their forthright
statements which are sufficient for establishing the
guilt of the present appellant. PW Habib Ullah,
though is distant cousin of the deceased but on the
other hand he is also brother-in-law of the present
appellant, therefore, his integrity could not be
doubted in any manner. The other two eye witnesses
namely Hakim Ullah and Muhammad Hussain are
independent and impartial witnesses of the
occurrence and they have supported the prosecution
version through their straightforward statements. All

the eye witnesses are unanimous on important

Hon'ble Me Justice Wigar Ahmad

aspects of the case and their credibility has not been
damaged during their cross-examination except a
few contradictions of minor and ignorable nature. In
fact they have narrated the occurrence and other
events having nexus therewith in the manner in
which they had actually taken place and nothing
could be found in their statements to suggest any
play-acting on their part for supporting a false case.
Indeed they had no motive to depose against the
present appellant. Thus, the ocular account in the
present case being reliable, truthful and trustworthy,
can safely be relied upon for conviction of the
appellant. Similar is the position with complainant
Qashqaray who has charged the appellant for the
murder of deceased who had taken away his sister
but despite the said grudge with the deceased he

lodged the report of his murder.

8. The case of prosecution is supported by
medical evidence. As per ocular account and initial
report, the appellant had hit the deceased on his head
with axe. The deceased then injured was examined
by Dr. Fazal Amin (PW-11) who has found a
crushed lacerated wound skin/muscles deep on his
left parieto-occipital region which caused his death

on 08.01.2016. The said doctor was cross-examined

to controvert the authenticity of his reports Ex.PW-
11/1 and Ex.PW-11/2 by confronting him with
several un-attended blanks in his report, however, he
has confidently explained the non-filling thereof by
stating that his top primacy in view of the critical
situation was to save a precious life, therefore, he
preferred speeding up of medical examination of the
injured over filling of the blanks in his report.
Similar are the reports of Dr. Muhammad Iqbal
(PW-10) which duly corroborate the version of
prosecution as narrated in the first information

report.

9. The I.O has recovered blood-stained
axe and blood through cotton from the spot which
were secured vide recovery memo Ex.PW-12/2.
Similarly, blood-stained shirt of the deceased was
taken into possession through recovery memo
Ex.PW-12/13. According to F.S.L report (Ex.PW-
12/26), blood on the axe and shirt has matched with
the blood recovered from the spot, thus, said report
further corroborates the prosecution case. The I.O
has not only recovered motorcycle on which the
appellant and deceased had arrived to the place of
occurrence but a helmet was also recovered during

search of his house as a proof of the fact that he was

08: Hon'ble Mr, Justke ishtlag Ibrahim
Bon’ble Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmed
Te tes perl Flew ae a ee

using motorcycle as routine. Some contradictions
with regard to the aforesaid recoveries in the
statements of PWs especially of Habib Ullah (PW-3)
cannot be excepted, however, the inconsistencies,
being minor in nature, have no significant bearing on
the prosecution case. Even otherwise, the ocular
account in the present case is sufficient for
conviction of the appellant and the circumstantial
evidence is to be considered as a matter of caution,
therefore, any inadequacy in the circumstantial
evidence would not discredit the ocular testimony
which is otherwise trustworthy and confidence
inspiring. Reliance is placed on Mst. Sughra Begum
and_ another Vs. Qaiser Pervez and others (2015
SCMR _ 1142) . It was observed by august Supreme

Court of Pakistan in the said judgment that:

“8. It is cardinal principle of justice that ocular
account in such cases plays a decisive and vital
role and once its intrinsic worth is accepted and
believed then the rest of the evidence, both
circumstantial and corroboratory in nature,
would be required as a matter of caution. To the
contrary, once the ocular account is disbelieved
then no other evidence, even of a high degree
and value, would be sufficient for recording
conviction on a capital charge therefore, we
have to see the probative value of the ocular
account in light of the facts and circumstances
of the case”.

10. Thus, prosecution has proved through

trustworthy direct as well as circumstantial evidence

that the present appellant had hit the deceased with
axe causing him serious wound on his head which
proved fatal to him and caused his death. However,
there are certain unattended circumstances of the
case with regard to real motive of the occurrence
which react on the quantum of sentence awarded to

the appellant by learned trial Court.

il. It is admitted that the deceased and the
present appellant had arrived to the place of
occurrence on the one and same motorcycle. It is
also admitted that the appellant was unarmed and he
had ample opportunity of doing away with the
deceased before his arrival to the scene of
occurrence. There is also no denial to the fact that
nobody has seen as to what had happened between
them right before the occurrence and that who was at
fault at that particular time which resulted into the
occurrence. It is also a matter of record that the axe,
which was used in commission of offence, was lying
in the wood-stock and it was not in possession of the
appellant prior to the occurrence. In addition to that
the appellant has caused a single axe blow to the
deceased. The witnesses are also silent with regard
to origin of the incident and reason of its

commission. Keeping in view the afore-referred

circumstances, it appears that something had
happened between the appellant and deceased right
before the occurrence at spur of the moment which
prompted the appellant to hit the deceased with axe,
however, that aspect of the case still shrouds in
mystery. Keeping in view the sudden mode of the
occurrence without premeditation or pre-planning on
the part of appellant, his case falls within Exception
4 to the erstwhile section 300 of the Pakistan Penal
Code which by that time was punishable under
section 304 of the old PPC. It would be appropriate
to reproduce Exception 4 herein below for ready

reference.

Exception 4.-- Culpable homicide is not
murder if it is committed without premeditation
in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon
sudden quarrel and without the offender’s
having taken undue advantage or acted in a
cruel or unusual manner.

Admittedly, neither the old section 300
nor the exceptions thereto are available in the new
Code and it was laid down in the case of “The State
V/s. Muhammad Hanif and 05 others” (1992 SCMR
2047) that all the matters which were initially dealt
with by erstwhile Section 304 PPC are now to be
considered under Section 302 (c) PPC. The said

view has repeatedly been upheld by the august

Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wioar Ahmad

atm prin or,

-13-

Supreme Court of Pakistan in a number of cases.

Thus, keeping in view the facts and circumstances of
the present case in light of the afore-referred

persistent view of the Hon’ble apex Court, in our -
opinion, the case of the present appellant attracts

section 302 (c) of the Pakistan Penal Code,

therefore, his conviction and sentence by the learned

trial Court u/s 302 (b) PPC are not sustainable. In

addition to that the appellant has caused a single axe

blow to the deceased. He neither repeated the axe

blows nor acted in a brutal manner by causing more

than one injuries to the deceased. Thus, in this

scenario, he deserves leniency with regard to

quantum of sentence. In the case of “Muhammad

Salim V/s. The State” (1969 SCMR 653), the august

Supreme Court of Pakistan in view of single knife
blow by accused during a sudden fight observed

that:

At the same time, it seems to us that
Muhammad Salim, in facing up to his uncle
and attacking him with a knife when he
himself was attacked ' with a hatchet, did not
behave in the manner of a very junior nephew
upon whom the wrath of his uncle had fallen,
so that he found himself in an open place being
attacked by the latter with a hatchet. If
Muhammad Salim’ had _ been himself
unprepared to meet force with force, then the
probability would be that after he was
suddenly attacked by his uncle with a hatchet,
he would have taken evasive action and
perhaps run away from the spot. Therefore,

DB; Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim

o

-14-

we consider that the view of the learned trial
Judge that there was a fight between the two
men is correct, and taking into account all the
circumstances, we agree with him also that this
fight took place suddenly and was not
pre-planned by the accused. In that fight, the
accused did not take undue advantage for he
struck only one blow, with his knife and then
fled from the spot.

12. For the foregoing reasons and
circumstances of the case, the instant appeal is partly
allowed. The conviction and sentence of the
appellant-convict recorded by the trial court under
Section 302(b), P.P.C are set aside. Instead he is
convicted under Section 302(c), P.P.C. and
sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 14 years. He
shall also pay compensation of Rs. 500,000/- (five
hundred thousand) to the legal heirs of the deceased
in terms of Section 544-A, Cr.P.C., and in default of
its payment he shall undergo simple imprisonment
for further six months. Benefit of Section 382-B,
Cr.P.C. is extended to him. The connected Cr.R No.
08-M/2018, being devoid of merits in view of the

above discussion, is accordingly dismissed.
