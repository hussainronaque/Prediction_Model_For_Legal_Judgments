ORDER

EJAZ AFZAL KHAN, J. This petition for leave to appeal has
arisen out of the judgment dated 13.04.2017 of a Division Bench of the
Peshawar High Court, Peshawar whereby it maintained the order of the
Accountability Court confirming the order of the DG NAB freezing the

account of the petitioners.

2. : Learned ASC appearing on behalf of the petitioners by taking
us through the orders passed the DG NAB, Accountability Court and the
judgment of the High Court sought to canvass at the bar that in the
absence of any precise allegations against the petitioners no order
freezing the accounts could be made: that if at all any excess payment
has been made what is the extent thereof and that without quantifying it

or neither the DG NAB exercising delegated powers could pass such order

; nor the Accountability Court could confirm it. The High Court, the learned
ASC added could have stepped in to rectify the error but if too
mechanically maintained the impugned orders.

3. | The learned Special Prosecutor appearing on behalf of the
: respondents stated that huge payment has been made to the petitioners
without justification but he too could not specify and substantiate it with
facts and figures. The orders impugned herein are also shorn of reasons.
Even the allegations have not been stated with particularity. Order
passed by the DG NAB, confirmed by the Accountability Court and |
mainiained by the High Court without specifying allegations and
recording reasons thus cannot be upheld. We therefore convert this
petition into appeal, allow it, set aside the impugned judgment and
orders and send the case back to the competent authority for passing an
appropriate order in terms of Section 24-A of the General Clauses Act,

after hearing the petitioners.
