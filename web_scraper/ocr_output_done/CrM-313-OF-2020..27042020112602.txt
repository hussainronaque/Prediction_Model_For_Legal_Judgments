AHMAD ALI, J.- After having been refused post
arrest bail to accused-petitioner, Muhammad Ashraf
son of Muhammad Azram, in case FIR No.419 dated
23.04.2019 under sections 365-B of Pakistan Penal
Code, 1860 registered at Police Station Havelian,
District Abbottabad, by the learned lower Court, he
seeks the same relief from this Court by filing instant
post arrest bail petition.

2. Dildar Khan son of Muhammad Afsar
Khan on 23.04.2019 submitted an application to the
Incharge Police Post Rajoyia to the effect that his
daughter Mst. Sawaira Bibi aged about 19/20 years
was married to Zubair resident of Banda Sahib Khan,
however, due to strained relations with her husband,
she was residing in his house for the last six months;

that on 20.04.2019 at ‘Sham Wiala’ she was found
missing, for which he searched her and now he is
satisfied that her daughter was abducted by Sharafat
Khan alias ‘7itw’ son of Dildar Khan alongwith
another unknown person in Suzuki Carry No.6230-
Rawalpindi for the purpose of ‘zina’; that his daughter
also took away cash amount of Rs.35,000/- and three
‘tolas’ gold, which may also be recovered.

3. Arguments heard. Record perused.

4. It transpires from the record that initially
the complainant has charged Sharafat Khan alias Titu
alongwith another unknown person, who was later on
traced as Zahid son of Ali Astan, for abduction of his
daughter, Mst. Sawaira Bibi. However, this version
was subsequently changed by the complainant in his
statement under section 164 Cr.P.C recorded on
03.06.2019, wherein, he charged one Faizan and
present accused/petitioner for abduction of his
daughter. Sharafat Khan and Zahid were released on
bail by this Court vide orders dated 20.09.2019 and
01.10.2019, respectively. Now, again the present
accused/petitioner alongwith his co-accused Faizan
were charged by the complainant on the basis of his
satisfaction but no source has been disclosed by him
in this respect. Admittedly, the present

accused/petitioner alongwith his brother Faizan has
Lo

been charged only on the basis of CDR date. At the
moment, no independent ocular or _ strong
circumstantial evidence is available on record to
connect the accused/petitioner with the offence of
abduction of Mst. Sawaira Bibi. Moreover, the
divergent statements of complainant made the entire
case of the prosecution doubtful, benefit whereof can
be extended to the accused/petitioners even at bail
stage. Reliance can be placed on 2018 P.Cr.L.J_173
and 2019 YLR 1617. Similarly, the co-accused have
already been admitted to bail by this Court, thus,
under the principle of consistency, accused/petitioner
also become entitled to the same relief.

5. Apart from the above, it has been held
time and again by the august Supreme Court that bail
does not mean acquittal of accused but only change of
custody from Government agencies to the sureties,
who on furnishing bonds take responsibility to
produce the accused whenever and wherever required
to be produced. Reliance could be placed on case
reported in 2008 SCMR 807 “Haji Muhammad Nazir
Vs State”.

6; Before parting with this order, this court
finds it necessary to mention that all the observations

recorded above are tentative assessment just for the
disposal of bail petition and not intended to influence
the mind of trial Court, which is free to appraise the
evidence strictly in accordance with law and merits of
the case.

7. So, by cutting the cackle, on tentative
assessment of material available on file, a case for the
grant of bail is made out. Consequently, this bail
application is allowed and accused-petitioner, named
above, is admitted to bail provided he furnishes bail
bonds in the sum of Rs.200,000/- (Two lacs) with two
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate, concerned, who shall
ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men of
means.
