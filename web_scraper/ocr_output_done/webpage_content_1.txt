ORDER
SHAHNAWAZ
TARIQ,J:-Through instant post arrest bail application,
applicant Syed Hyder Ali Shah has impugned order dated 28.08.2015, passed by
the Court of learned Ist Additional Sessions Judge/Special Judge CNS, Khairpur,
whereby his earlier bail application was declined.
2.     Necessary
facts spelt out from instant F.I.R are that on spy information complainant reached
at the pointed place, apprehended present applicant alongwith his two real
brothers and recovered one plastic shopper containing 02 envelopes of Heroin
powder weighing 1300 grams from present applicant,  whereas from Zubair Shah
1500 grams Charas, while from Zameer Shah 1500 grams Charas and 1300 grams
Opium.Complainant also lodged another F.I.R No.36 of 2015 against applicant in
respect of same narcotics. However, Challans were submitted separately against
all the three accused.
3.     Learned
counsel for applicant contended that applicant is innocent and has been falsely
implicated in instant case by complainant, who is disputed with applicant, as
co-accused Zameer Shah had filed harassment petitionagainst him and other
police officials; that in fact co-accused Zameer Shah had purchased a plot from
Choudhary Asghar, whereupon one Ghulam Qadir, who is influential person of the
locality, became annoyed and filed criminal complaint before Ist additional
Sessions Judge, Khairpur, against Choudhry Asghar and others including
co-accused Zameer Hussain; that complainant with ulterior motive has involved
all the three brothers falsely by foisting the Narcotics, as such entire family
is suffering for their livelihood; that co-accused Zubair Shah has already been
granted bail by the HighCourt; hence applicant is also entitled for grant of
bail on the rule of consistency; that the contents of FIR are silent regarding
weighing of Heroin powder wrapped in two envelopes and complainant has presumed
total weight of recovered narcotics to be 1300 grams without deducting the weight
of both envelopes, and this aspect of the case requires serious consideration;
that in past, applicant and his brothers havenever remained involved in any
criminal case.
4.     Learned
APG contended that applicant was apprehended at the spot and during his
personal search one plastic shopper was secured which was containing Heroin
powder in two envelopes. However, he candidly submitted that complainant has
not mentioned the mode of weighing of recovered Heroin.
5.     Perusal
of material available on record and consideration of arguments advanced by
learned counsel for the parties emanate that complainant despite prior
information about the accused persons having narcotic substances in their
possession for sale,he neither associated any independent mashir nor made any
serious efforts to hire any public person to act as mashir,and private persons
should have been given preference if they are available at the spot rather than
official personnel to maintain the transparency of the recovery.In the case of
State v. Bashir and others, PLD 1997 SC 408, the Hon’ble Supreme Court while
dealing with the issue of applicability of the provisions of section 103,
Cr.P.C, has observed as follows:-  
“As
regards the above second submission of Mr. M.M. Aqil, it may be observed that
it has been repeatedly held that the requirement of section 103, Cr.P.C.
namely, that two members of the public of the locality should be Mashirs to the
recovery, is mandatory unless it is shown by the prosecution that in the
circumstances of a particular case it was not possible to have two Mashirs from
the public. In this regard, it will suffice to refer to a recent Judgment of
this Court in the case of Mushtaq Ahmed v. The State, PLD 1996 SC 574. In the
case in hand SIP Muhammad Rafique has not been able to give any cogent
explanation as to why he was unable to secure two Mashirs from the public.”
 
6.     As
per the averments of FIR,the Heroin powder was recovered from two envelops butsame
was not weighed on the spot and complainant presumed its total weight to be
1300 grams tentatively. Perusal of the Chemical Examiner’s report dated
02.02.2015,reflects that Chemical Examiner has also not weighed both envelopes containing
Heroin powder separately mentioning their net weight, but he mentioned total
weight of Heroin powder lying in two envelopes as 1300 grams, though Chemical
Examiner was duty bound to mention net weight of Heroin powder lying in two
envelops separately after deducting weight of both envelops, but he has not
discharged his duty properly, hence after deducting the weight of both
envelops, net weight of recovered Heroin powder may become more or less than
1000 grams. 
7.     Indeed,
co-accused Syed ZameerHussain, brother of present applicant had filed
Cr.M.A.No.436/2014 against complainant and other police officials, which was
disposed of vide order dated 11.03.2014 in view of the undertaking given by police
officials including SHO P.S ‘B’ Section, Khairpur that neither they have caused
any kind of harassment to applicant nor intend to do so in future and Court of
learned Ist Additional Sessions Judge, Khairpur disposed of such application
with direction to the police officials not to cause any kind of harassment to
applicant. Moreover, co-accused Zubair was granted bail by the High Court vide
order dated 03.08.2015 in criminal bail application No.S-193 of 2015. Furthermore,
one Ghulam Qadir, who is influential person of the locality, filed Criminal
Complaint No.29/2014 against Choudhary Asghar and 7 others including co-accused
Zameer Hussain, who had purchased one plot from Choudhary Asghar, under
Sections 3,4 and 7 of Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005, before the Court of IstAdditional
Sessions Judge, Khairpur.
8.     It
significant to refer that all the three male members, who are real brothershave
been involved in instant F.I.R and their entire family comprising of women folk
and children are suffering for their butter and bread.Prosecution has failed to
place any criminal record of applicant and his two brothers andadmittedlyno
criminal case was lodged against themprior to instant
case.Applicant is a regular student of BS-II year 2015 of Department of Public Administration,
Shah Abdul Latif University,Khairpur, and such character certificate has been
issued by the Chairman, Department of Public Administration in favour of
applicant, which is available on page No.51 of the file.Complainant though
registered joint F.I.R No.34 of 2015 against all the accused, but he again
lodged second F.I.R No.36 of 2015 against present applicant for the same
recovered narcotics, and learned APG could not satisfy this Court as to why
second FIR was lodged against present applicant regarding same narcotics, which
otherwise reflects the personal grudge of complainant. It is well settled that
any iota of doubt even at bail stage shall be counted in the account of accused
and Court should not hesitate to extend such benefit irrespective of the sensitivity
of the offence.After conclusion of the investigation, Challan has already been
submitted and applicant is no more required further, hence further detention of
applicant will not serve any useful purpose and even there is no apprehension
of tempering with prosecution evidence as PWs are police officials. 
9.     Considering
the above circumstance, I am of the view that applicant has succeeded to make
out a case for grant of post arrest bail on the ground of further enquiry as
envisaged in Section 497(2), Cr.P.C. as well as on the rule of consistency. Consequently,
applicant is admitted to bail subject to his furnishing a solvent surety in the
sum of Rs.100,000/- and P.R. Bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of the
learned trial Court.
10.   The
observations made above are tentative in nature and learned trial Court shall
decide the case strictly on its merits.
