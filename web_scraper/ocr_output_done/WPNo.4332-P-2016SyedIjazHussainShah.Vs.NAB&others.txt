2. Brief facts of the case are that
Reference N.12 of 2016 has been filed against
Malik Habib s/o Malik Abdul and 05 others for the
offence of cheating to the public at large for fake
transactions of property, issuing fake copies of
Fard Jamabandi by showing particular land as
ownership of co-accused and instead selling other
land of less value not adjacent but distant to the
main road by adopting such modes operadi as
detailed in the reference and expropriated huge
amount of money from the affectees. The accused
Adil Shoukat has filed his WP No.1157-P/2016 for
his post arrest bail which was dismissed alongwith
W.P No.1081-P/2016, filed by co-accused Mehtab
Ali Qureshi, W.P No.1106-P/2016 filed by co-
accused Bostan Khan and W.P No.1616-P/2016
filed by co-accused Malik Habib. All above writ
petitions were dismissed vide order of this Court
dated 28.06.2016. Above said accused Mehtab Ali
Qureshi, Bostan Khan and Malik Habib
approached Hon’ble Supreme Court by filing their
respective Civil Petitions No.2343, 2555 & 2994 of
2016 which after hearing were dismissed, however

the Hon’ble Supreme Court directed the NAB
Ijaz

authorities to take action against other involved
persons including Government Officials having
role. The same para No.6 of the judgment of
Hon’ble Supreme Court is reproduced:-,

6. The arguments _ that

many others including officials

of the Revenue Department

having a serious role in the

commission of the crime have

not been touched altogether

may necessitate the issuance of

a_ direction to the NAB

authorities to be even handed

while investigating the case,

but shall not furnish a

justification for release of the
petitioners on bail.”

3. = In the light of above observations made by
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan and in the
light of claim of 14 others affectees, the matter
was further investigated by the NAB authorities
and 15 others accused including petitioners of
W.P No.433-P/2017 were charged in the
supplementary reference in reference No.12/2016.
4. The brief facts of the reference are that
petitioner Syed Ijaz Hussain Shah alongwith other
co-accused namely Malik Habib, Bostan Khan,
Adil Shaukat, Chaudhry Masood and Mehtab Ali
Qureshi are involved in the offence of cheating

under garb of fake property transactions through
Ijaz

which accused persons persuaded different
people to purchase the land not owned by the
pretended owners which was, shown to the
affectees and in this manner the accused persons
obtained pecuniary benefits in the form of cash
and properties by entering into agreement to sell
the land with defective title. Similarly, the accused
of the connected W.P No.433-P/2017 Mian
Muhammad Irfan and Ghulam Murtaza being
revenue officials had allegedly played a pivotal
role in the scam, since they were primary source
to ascertain the ownership and particulars of land
in league with other co-accused generated and
provided false information and fake record against
the actual one, thus by misusing their authority
facilitated and abetted the offence of cheating the
public at large and committed offence of breach of
trust, embezzled and misappropriated the amount
of worth Rs.231,680,000/-, so committed offence
u/s Q(a) punishable u/s 10 of NAO 1999 and
scheduled there to.

5. The learned counsel for petitioners argued
that petitioner namely Mian Muhammad Irfan was

working as Patwari in the Revenue Department,
Ijaz

Haripur and it was included in his duties to
incorporate the factum of inheritance, sale
mutation etc for which under law Patwari is bound
to enter the report of the same and provide the
copies of Fard Jamabandi according to the law to
the persons in need. He added that attestation of
mutation is the duty of revenue officer. Similarly,
the learned counsel submitted that the petitioner
namely Sardar Ghulam Murtaza being revenue
officer has acted according to law and whatever
he attested the mutations, those were attested
upon the already reported entry by the Patwari.
The learned counsel further argued that both are
revenue officials and have malafidely been roped
in case. Similarly, learned counsel for accused
Syed ljaz Hussain Shah argued that petitioner is
businessman engaged in real estate business at
Islamabad, Taxila and Rawalpindi who has been
falsely implicated in the alleged offence. Learned
counsel added that the only role given to the
petitioner is of “introducer” as wrongly stated by
Mr. Muhammad lIjmal Khan (now deceased) who
recorded his statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C during

investigation before the Magistrate at Peshawar as
Ijaz

an approver, so is entitled for the concession of
bail. Moreover the petitioner is only a witness to
sale agreement dated 06.07.2013 between
Mehtab Ali Qureshi co-accused and Umar Farooq
a so-called affectee/applicant/complainant. Both
the learned counsel for petitioners lastly argued
that number of witnesses is 64 and up till now
evidence has not been recorded of a single
witness.

6. On the other hand learned ADPG Mr.
Umer Farooq Khan, Advocate argued that
petitioners are member of a criminal gang who
persuaded the public at large for fake property
transactions to purchase the land not owned by
pretended owners, shown to affectees and
obtained pecuniary benefits in the form of cash
and properties by entering into agreement to sell
for land with defective title. He further added that
petitioners have committed the offence of
corruption and corrupt practices by expropriating
money from affectees. The petitioners Mian
Muhammad lIfran being Patwari entered wrong
repot in different mutations attested by other

petitioner Sardar Gul Murtaza as revenue officer
Ijaz

on the verification of Bostan Khan, Adil Shaukat
and thumb impressed by so called vendee Malik
Habib. He further argued that bail petitions of co-
accused Malik Habib, Bostan Khan, Adil Shaukat,
Chaudhry Sasood, Mehtab Ali Qureshi have been
turned down by this Court and maintained by
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan.

7. Arguments heard and record perused.
8. From the perusal of record, material
collected during investigation, it reveals that prima
facie accused petitioners together with other
above mentioned accused Malik Habib etc, sold
land to different people by making wrong entries,
attesting mutations, preparing fake revenue
papers showing land adjacent to road _ but
transferring land quite away from road, signing
sale agreements as witnesses. Similarly, petitioner
Mian Muhammad Irfan in the capacity of Patwari
entered sale mutation No.10990 showing Malik
Habib as owner, who thumb impressed the same
while verified by Bostan Khan and Adil Shaukat
co-accused and attested by Sardar Ghulam
Murtaza. Similar is the position about sale

mutations No.10996, 10997, 10998 & the sale
Ijaz

agreement dated 06.07.2013 between Mehtab Ali
Qureshi and Umar Farooq applicant/affectee,
witnessed by Syed ljaz Hussain Shah. All the
above acts of accused/petitioners and the others
co-accused connect them with each other and with
the commission of offence.

9. So after making tentative assessment
of available record, the accused/petitioners are
connected with the commission of offence which
falls under the prohibitory clause of section 497
Cr.P.C, thus in view of above, we are not inclined
to issue a writ for directing respondents to release
accused/petitioners on bail, hence this petition
alongwith connected writ petition being without
substance are dismissed. However, respondents
are directed to conclude the trial as early as
possible within three (3) months, failing which the
petitioners shall have the right to move petition for
release on bail.

Announced.
