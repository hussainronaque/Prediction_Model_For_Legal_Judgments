The State by: Khawaja Sohail Iqbal, District Public

Prosecutor along with Azmat, S.I.

SARDAR AHMED NAEEM, J.- The appellant challenges
the judgment dated 15.02.2021 rendered by learned Sessions
Judge, Attock, in case F.I.R. No.88 dated 17.09.2018, under
section 302, 311, P.P.C., registered at Police Station Rango,
Attock.

2. The appellant was tried by the learned trial court, which
held the appellant guilty under section 302(b), P.P.C.,
convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for life with
compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- payable to the legal heirs of
the deceased under section 544-A, Cr.P.C., in default whereof
to further undergo simple imprisonment for six months.
Benefit permissible under section 382-B, Cr.P.C. was also
extended to him.

3. Niaz Khan convict/appellant has filed Criminal Appeal
No.356 of 2021 against his conviction and sentences. The
complainant also filed Criminal Revision No.134 of 2021 for
enhancement of sentence awarded to Niaz Khan (respondent).
This judgment will dispose of both the above mentioned
matters.

4. Learned counsel for the appellant argued this appeal at
some length. The crux of his arguments was that the

appellant was incapable to face trial or to defend himself and
Criminal Appeal No.356 of 2021 2
Criminal Revision No.134 of 2021

that the learned trial court was cognizant of this fact but could
not determine this issue under the law, which caused
miscarriage of justice, thus, the impugned judgment of
conviction is not sustainable.

5. Learned District Public Prosecutor assisted by the
learned counsel for the complainant opposed this appeal with
vehemence and argued that the appellant committed Qatl-i-
Amd of his wife, namely, Bibi Zainab in his own house; that
the case of prosecution was supported by the ocular as well
as medical evidence; that motive was also proved which gets
further corroboration from the recovery of weapon i.e. ‘churri’;
that the prosecution witnesses firmly withstood the test of
cross-examination and remained unshaken. Added that
prosecution proved its case against the appellant to the hilt,
thus, appeal deserves dismissal.

6. I have given anxious considerations to the arguments
advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and perused
the record with their able assistance.

7. The occurrence in this case took place on 17.09.2018 at
09:55 a.m. in the area of Tajak. During the occurrence Bibi
Zainab wife of the appellant lost her life. The appellant was
charge sheeted on 15.11.2018 under section 302, P.P.C. The
case was posted for prosecution evidence. At trial, the
prosecution produced as many as 11 witnesses.

8. The appellant was examined under section 342, Cr.P.C.
He did not appear as his own witness under section 340(2),
Cr.P.C. but tendered into evidence letter No.3556 dated
12.03.2019 (Exh.DA) and medical report of District Standing
Medical Board (Exh.DB) suggesting his mental illness and
closed defence evidence.

9. The learned trial court held the appellant guilty,
convicted and sentenced as detailed above but the impugned
judgment is totally silent about the mental illness of the

appellant.
Criminal Appeal No.356 of 2021 3
Criminal Revision No.134 of 2021

10. The record divulged that on 21.12.2018, the appellant
was produced before the trial court in custody. The Court
observed that the appellant appeared to be abnormal. Then
he was not represented by his counsel. However, the order of
the learned trial Court dated 21.12.2018 can advantageously
be reproduced hereunder:

“From the physical appearance of the
accused, apparently, he seems to be
abnormal. Therefore, M.S DHQ Hospital
Attock is directed to medically examine
about his mental health condition
through Medical Board and submit his
report before this Court, on or before
07.01.2019. Superintendent, District
Jail, Attock is directed to have liaison
with M.S and make arrangements for
production of accused before medical
board.”

On 27.09.2019, report of Medical Board was submitted
along with the report of psychiatrist suggesting behavioural
disorder/ Schizophrenia but the learned trial court concluded
that the appellant was fit to stand trial and on his request,
Malik Zameer Abbas, Advocate was appointed as defence
counsel at state expense.

11. The record further divulged that at the time of final
arguments, the mental illness was pleaded by the learned
defence counsel but the impugned judgment is totally silent
about this aspect of the case. The appellant, as mentioned
above, was husband of the deceased, who sustained 15
‘Churri’ blows at his hand as suggested by the evidence
available on record. Despite the fact that the learned trial
court itself referred the appellant for evaluation of his
capability to stand trial but concluded that the appellant was
able to defend himself. No question, whatsoever, was put by
the learned trial court for its satisfaction. Within the
contemplation of section 84, P.P.C., whenever the plea is
raised regarding the state of mind of accused at the time of

commission of offence, the onus would be on the defence to
Criminal Appeal No.356 of 2021 4
Criminal Revision No.134 of 2021

prove such a plea as contemplated in Article 121 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984.

The learned trial court failed to determine the question
regarding capability of the appellant to face trial. The record
revealed that on 26.11.2019, an application was also filed by
the defence counsel for summoning Dr. Tameez-ud-Din as
CW., turned down by the learned trial court vide order dated
28.11.2019 with the observation that Dr. Tameez-ud-Din was
neither the prosecution witness nor acquainted with the
material facts in issue and thus concluded that the evidence
of Dr. Tameez-ud-Din was not essential.

12. A similar question came up for hearing before the apex
Court in a recent judgment titled (PLD 2021 SC 488), their
lordships in para No.54 at page 521 observed as under:

“54. Once the Court has formed a prima
facie tentative opinion that the accused
may be incapable of understanding the
proceedings of trial or make his/her
defence, it becomes obligatory upon the
Court to embark upon conducting an
inquiry to decide the issue of incapacity
of the accused to face trial due to mental
illness. Medical opinion is sine qua non
in such an inquiry. For this purpose, the
Court must get the accused examined by
a Medical Board, to be notified by the
Provincial Government, consisting a
qualified medical experts in the field of
mental health, to examine the accused
person and opine whether accused is
capable or otherwise to understand the
proceedings of trial and make his/her
defence. The _ report/opinion of the
Medical Board must not be a mere
diagnosis of a mental illness or absence
thereof. It must be a detailed and
structured report with specific reference
to psychopathology (if any) in the mental
functions of consciousness, intellect,
thinking, mood, emotions, perceptions,
cognition, judgment and insight. The
head of the Medical Board shall then be
examined as Court witness and such
examination shall be reduced in writing.
Both the prosecution and defence should
be given an opportunity to cross-examine
him in support of their respective stance.
Thereafter, if the accused wishes to
adduce any evidence in support of
his/her claim, then he/she should be
Criminal Appeal No.356 of 2021 5
Criminal Revision No.134 of 2021

allowed to produce such_ evidence,
including expert opinion with the
prosecution given an opportunity to
cross-examine. Similarly, the prosecution
may also be allowed to produce evidence
which it deems relevant to _ this
preliminary issue with opportunity given
to the defence to cross-examine. It is
upon the consideration of this evidence
procured and adduced before the Court
that a finding on this question of fact i.e.
the capability of the accused to face trial
within the contemplation of section 464
and 465, Cr.P.C. shall be recorded by the
Court.”

13. The reports of Psychiatrist and Medical Board are
available on record as Exh.DA and Exh.DB. The appellant
was diagnosed as patient of behavioural disorder and
Schizophrenia. The reports were neither detailed nor
comprehensive. The application moved by the learned counsel
for the appellant was turned down by the learned trial court
and, thus, head of the Medical Board could not enter the
witness dock. The learned trial court have dealt with the case
contrary to law declared by the apex Court in above
mentioned judgment.
14. It is inalienable right of every citizen to be treated in
accordance with law as envisaged by Article 4 of the
Constitution and it is the duty and obligation of the public
functionaries to act in accordance with law. Right to fair trial
is also guaranteed under Article 10-A of Constitution of
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.
15. Islam also gives a great deal of attention to all groups
within the society; each has their own rights, including
individuals with a_ disability. In order to understand the
disabilities in Islamic text, based on some examples of
physical conditions, such as blindness, deafness, lameness,
mental retardation and leprosy. An example of such is in the
Qur’an (48,17).

“There is not upon the blind any guilt or upon the lame

any guilt or upon ill any guilt. And whoever obeys Allah

and His messenger-He will admit him to gardens
Criminal Appeal No.356 of 2021 6
Criminal Revision No.134 of 2021

beneath which rivers flow: but whoever turns away-He

will punish him with a painful punishments”.

16. The generic term “ disability” was not mentioned in the
Qur’an; the term “disadvantaged people” was being used to
refer to those with special needs. In fact, society’s civil
responsibility is illustrated in the Qur’an, which stresses
that society is responsible for taking care of such individual
and is’ responsible for improving their conditions.
Disadvantaged situations (lack of some physical, economic or
social characteristic) are believed to be a result of barriers
produced by society.

17. To us, prophet (SAW) was the earliest _ initiator/
defender of disability right and 1400 years ago, way before
the UN convention on the Rights of Persons with disability
was enacted, he already worked hard to ensure that people
with disabilities were catered for and were given their rights
and privileges, including the right to a normal life just like
anyone else.

18. The prophet (SAW) transformed the lives of the disabled
people by teaching the society that there were no stigma or
bad attitudes for those with disabilities. The Prophet
reassured the disabled that their disabilities are not
punishments but it is a means for their sins to be forgiven.

The Sunnah supports the notion of social responsibility
towards the individuals. A few examples of this are found in
the following two Hadith.

According to prophetic tradition, mentioned in Sahih
Muslim, “the Similitude of believers in regard to mutual love,
affection, feeling is that we are all one body; When any limb
aches, the whole body aches, because of sleeplessness and
fever.(32,6258). Another Hadith narration from Sunnan AIl-
Tirmidhi states “the person is not one of us, who is not

mercifulness to our youth and respect to our elders.
Criminal Appeal No.356 of 2021 7
Criminal Revision No.134 of 2021

19. Disadvantaged people’s rights are mentioned in the text
of the Qur’an on several occasions. For instance, their civil
rights in terms of marriage and inheritance are clarified in the
Qur’an: “ And do not give the weak-minded your property,
which Allah has made a means of sustenance for you, but
provide for them with it and clothe them and speak to them
words of appropriate kindness. (4,5):
“And test the orphans (in their abilities) until they
reach marital age. Then if you perceive them to be of
sound judgment, release their property to them And do
not consume it excessively and quickly (anticipating)
that they will grow up. And whoever(when acting as
guardian), is self sufficient should refrain (from taking
a fee); and whoever is poor-let him take according to
what is acceptable. And then, when you release their
property to them, bring witnesses upon them. And
sufficient is Allah as accountant (4.6)”
20. Another Quranic verse in the same chapter tells us “
And concerning the oppressed among children and that you
maintain for orphans(their right) in justice” (4,127).
21. From the sources and texts mentioned above from the
Qur’an, following can be deduced:

> First, “Weak minded” is generic term that could
comprise several groups, such as_ very young children,
mentally retarded and mentally ill-individuals and so
forth;

> Second, the texts lay down the idea of guardianship for
disadvantaged individual such as the weak minded or
orphans;

> Third, this guardianship is subject to a sense of duty,
fairness and kindness.

22. Islam views disability as challenge set by Allah. The

Qur’an urges people to treat people with intellectual
disabilities with kindness and to protect people with
disabilities.

23. It is said in the Qur’an that “whosoever does an atom’s

weight of good will see it, and whosoever does an atom’s
Criminal Appeal No.356 of 2021 8
Criminal Revision No.134 of 2021

weight of evil will see it. (99,7-8). In-fact, several other
Qur’an and Hadith narrations promises both those who are in
a disadvantaged situation and those who are taking care of
them, rewards, both, in this life and in the hereafter for their
patience. Indeed, this promise usually motivates people to
support the disadvantaged whether are strangers or close
relations.

24. The inclusion is another example of Islam’s concerns for
those who are in a disadvantaged situation. The prophet
used to visit sick, pray for them and console them instilling
confidence in their souls and lifting their hearts.

25. The notion of disability and its existence in the Qur’an
and Hadith has been mentioned above in which the idea of
individuals being in disadvantaged situation has been clearly
stated.

26. Reverting to the facts/merits of this case, it may be
mentioned that every man is presumed to be sane and
possessed of a sufficient decree of reasons to be responsible
for his actions, until the contrary is proved. This clearly
follows from Article 121 of the Qanun-i-Shahdat, 1984, which
provides that burden of proving that the case of an accused
person falls within an exception is on him.

27. There are 650 million individuals in the world, who are
disabled as a result of mental, physical and sensory
impairments. The medical and the legal standards of sanity
are also not identical. Chapter XXXIV of the Criminal
Procedure Code, 1898 provides mechanism for the trial and
other related matters of the person, appear to the Court of
unsound mind. The person of unsound is a person who from
infirmity of mind is incapable of managing himself or his
affairs. Dealing with a similar question in case titled Fauqual

Bashar versus The State (1997 SCMR 239), the relevant

observations of their lordships appearing in para-5 of the

judgment read as under:
Criminal Appeal No.356 of 2021 9
Criminal Revision No.134 of 2021

“5. In context of insanity, the state of mind of an accused
person, firstly, at the time of occurrence and, secondly, at the
time of inquiry of trial is a question of fact. When a Court is
confronted with the question during an inquiry or trial,
whether or not an accused is of unsound mind and incapable
of understanding the proceedings against him, it has to take
action under sections 464 and 465, Cr.P.C. according as one
of other is attracted to the case.

In Ata Muhammad’s case supra, a fine comparison of the two
provisions was drawn by this Court in paragraph 12. of the

report which is as under:-

“In cases of trials before the Court of
Session or a High Court, if it appears to
the Court at the trial that an accused
person is of unsound mind and
consequently incapable of making his
defence, the Court, in the first instance
has to try the fact of such unsoundness
and incapacity and the trial of this
question shall be deemed to be a part of
the trial under subsection (2) of section
465 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The
legal position which emerges from the
two sections is that under section 464 the
Magistrate must have reason to believe
that the accused person before him is of
unsound mind and_ incapable’ of
understanding the proceedings, and
under section 465 it should appear to
the Court at the trial that the accused
person suffers from unsoundness of mind
and thus is incapable of making his
defence. In either case the action is to
follow the subjective reaction of the
Magistrate or the Court to the situation
that arises before him. If, during the
inquiry, nothing comes to the notice of a
Magistrate to induce a belief in him that
an accused person is of unsound mind
and if at the trial before the Sessions
Court it does not appear to the latter that
the accused is of unsound mind and
consequently incapable of making his
defence, there is nothing for them to do
except to proceed with the inquiry or the
trial in the normal manner. The words
appear to the Court are used in section
465 while the words has reason to believe
are used in section 464, but it is clear
that in practical effect they mean almost
Criminal Appeal No.356 of 2021 10
Criminal Revision No.134 of 2021

the same thing. The phrase to appear in
my judgment used in the context of
section 465 in the meaning is nearest to
the phrase to be in one’s opinion as given
in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary”...
28. The above mentioned formality/requirement of the law,

in particular, in the instant case, are the reports of
psychiatrist as well as the said medical board constituted for
this purpose, have established that the appellant was
suffering from behavioral disorder and schizophrenia. More so
when the manner of committing the offence by the person of
unsound mind is also falling squarely within the four corners
of criminal responsibility, which include:

i. The personal history of the accused, who may be
eccentric, melancholic, degenerate or neuroasthenic;

ii. Absence of motive, not only does a mentally ill person
commit without any motive but also often kills his
nearest and dearest relations;

iii. Absence of secrecy, because if the accused happens to
be mentally ill does not try to conceal body of victim,
nor does he attempt to evade law by destroying the
evidence of his crime;

iv. The manner of committing occurrence;

v. Want of preparation or pre-arrangement, a mentally ill
person does not make any prearranged plan to kill any
body, but a sane person, in routine, makes all the
necessary preparation prior to committing of crime; and

vi. A mentally ill person has no accomplice in the criminal
act.

29. Now, it is to be seen whether there was any such

material to call for enquiry in terms of section 465 Cr.P.C. The

record reveals that his abnormality was observed by the

Court itself and at some stage, an application was moved by

the learned defence counsel for summoning Dr. Tameez Ud

Din head of the special medical board as a witness, who

opined that the appellant was suffering from schizophrenia.

But strange is the fact that this application was rejected by
Criminal Appeal No.356 of 2021 11
Criminal Revision No.134 of 2021

the learned trial Court without application of mind. I am
unable to understand what was the haste on the part of the
learned trial Court to deal with this aspect of the case in such
a summary and slipshod manner notwithstanding the fact
that this is a mandate of the statute itself. The learned trial
Court did not realize altogether that if such plea or enquiry
envisaged by the above mentioned provision is found false, it
at its worst, would prolong trial for a month or so but if found
true, it at its best, would save a person from verdict of guilt.
When stakes in the latter case as compared to the former are
far greater and far more damaging such enquiry should not
be dispensed with so casually.

The learned trial Court failed to determine the issue of

mental illness and proceeded with undue haste and decided
the case contrary to the law/observations of their lordships,
thus, judgment of conviction cannot be sustained.
30. For the foregoing reasons, this appeal is allowed . The
impugned judgment 15.2.2021 is set aside and the case is
remanded to the learned trial Court with the direction to
obtain fresh, complete/comprehensive reports in view of
observations of the apex Court referred to in para-10 of this
judgment and then to determine the capability of the
appellant to face trial within parameters of section 464 and
465 Cr.P.C. The appellant shall be kept as under trial
prisoner till the conclusion of trial. The learned trial Court
shall, thereafter proceed further and conclude the trial in the
light of the above mentioned law declared by the apex Court.
