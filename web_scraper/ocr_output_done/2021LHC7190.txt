Muhammad (Pw-8). During the investigation Sections

injuries on the person of Zawwar Hussain, Muhammad
Siddique and Muhammad Zahid (Pw-15). It was finally
stated that all the assailants then escaped from crime scene.
4. Safdar Naseer SI after observing the necessary
formalities made an endorsement and send the complaint to
Police Station through Adnan Aslam Constable on the basis
of which FIR was recorded by Muhammad Imran ASI'°
(Pw-13). Appellants and their co-accused Muhammad Javed
were arrested on 22.06.2016 by Hubdar Hussain SI (Pw-11)
and were sent to jail where identification parade was
supervised by Mr. Muhammad Javed Khan Magistrate
(Pw-14). The witnesses had identified all the assailants.
During these proceedings the witnesses disclosed that Javed
was driving the motorbike whereas appellants made firing.
5. In subsequent investigation recoveries were also
affected at the instances of both the appellants.

6. On conclusion of investigation a report under Section
173 Cr.P.C (Challan) was submitted in court.

7. A charge under Sections 302/324/397/34 PPC, on
29.11.2016, was framed against appellants and Muhammad
Javed for which they pleaded not guilty and demanded their
trial, where after prosecution had produced the following
witnesses: -

Pw.1 Dr. Safdar Ali issued the operation
notes with regard to injuries on
Muhammad Siddique (deceased).

Pw-2 Dr. Iftikhar Ahmad conducted the
post mortem examination of Muhammad
Siddique and issued the report (PA).

author of FIR.

Pw-14 Muhammad Javed Khan
Magistrate supervised the identification
parade and issued the proceedings (PX).
Pw-15 Muhammad Zahid is an injured eye
witness.

8. After producing the reports of Serologist (PY),
firearm (PZ) and copies of FIRs (PAA) prosecution’s
evidence was closed by the learned Deputy District Public
Prosecutor.

9. In their examinations made under Section 342 Cr.P.C
appellants pleaded their false involvement.

10. Learned counsel for appellants maintained that the
basic evidence in this case is identification parade and if it
is established that there was no possibility for the witnesses
to see the faces of the appellants, how they could identify

them during these proceedings?; identification parade

" An official of revenue of department

Muhammad Ijaz& another Versus The State

proceedings are suffering from serious illegalities so cannot
be relied upon; identification parade is a weak type of
evidence and cannot be relied unless there is strong
corroboration from independent sources. He finally
contended that as it is a case of no evidence therefore
convictions of appellants cannot sustain.

11. On the other hand learned Assistant District Public
Prosecutor contended that witnesses were having no enmity
whatsoever for the false involvement of appellants who
were rightly picked up during the identification parade
where the role was also assigned to them and their co-
accused; identification proceedings, if suffering from
certain irregularities, for that complainant cannot be held
responsible as it was the duty of the Magistrate to observe
what he was supposed to do?; pointing the crime scene and
recoveries of weapons with positive report of firearm expert
are independent corroboration in this case. He finally
argued that there is no reason to interfere in a well reasoned
judgment recorded by the learned trial court.

12. HEARD

13. According to prosecution’s story the appellants along
with their co-accused on 09.07.2016 led the police party to
the crime scene and disclosed that it was the venue where
they committed the crime. Under Article 40 of the Qanoon-
e-Shahadat, Order 1984, when any fact is deposed to as
discovered in consequence of information received form a
person accused of any offence, in the custody of a police
officer, so much of such information, whether it amounts to
a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact thereby
discovered, may be proved (Emphasized).

14. The word ‘distinctly’ used in the provision means a

fact that was not in the knowledge of anyone prior to its
Criminal Appeal No.1240-J of 2017
Muhammad Ijaz& another Versus The State

disclosure by accused. The place of occurrence pointed out
by the appellants was not secret or a breaking news before
it was disclosed by them, so it has no legal value and cannot
be used as an incriminating piece of evidence against
appellants.

15. Muhammad Javed alias Kalay Shah was stated to be
present with appellants at the time of occurrence. Before the
identification proceedings were conducted neither in FIR
nor in their statements recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C
the witnesses ever claimed that Muhammad Javed was
driving the motorbike and only appellants made firing. The
case was quite specific that three unknown persons came
there and made indiscriminate firing. Muhammad Javed, as
mentioned earlier, has been acquitted by the learned trial
court. Neither complainant nor the state has taken any
exception to that acquittal, therefore when similarly placed
person has been cleared by the learned trial court while
disbelieving the statements of private witnesses, how
prosecution can force to sustain the convictions of
appellants?

16. Coming to the identification parade, the basic
question before this Court is that whether there was any
occasion for Nazar Muhammad (Pw-8), Muhammad Wazeer
(Pw-9) and Muhammad Zahid (Pw-15) to see the faces of
appellants and their co-accused, because the occurrence had
taken place in the dark hours of the night where admittedly
no source of light was available. This was their own case of
the eye witnesses that when motorbike of assailants came
close to them, till that time its head light was off so there
was no question for them to see the faces of any of the
assailants? It was then stated by them that the culprits

switched on the head light. Even from this angle there was
Criminal Appeal No.1240-J of 2017
Muhammad Ijaz& another Versus The State

no possibility for the witnesses to see the features of the
appellants and their co-accused because the head light of
the motorbike was towards their faces and not the
appellants.

17. The source of light was a serious challenge for
prosecution and finding in difficulty, first time in court
Nazar Muhammad (Pw-8) added that Abdul Ghaffar one of
the witnesses was having a torch in his hand. On
confrontation, in cross-examination by defence, he was
found under improvement. Similarly Muhammad Wazeer
and Muhammad Zahid stated so. This principle is relevant
to refer here that a witness who makes material
improvements in his statement during trial so as to cover
inherent defects, his credibility remains of no worth!?,

18. Hubdar Hussain SI in his statement admitted that no
source of torch was mentioned in the complaint however
this fact was introduced during the investigation. For the
sake of arguments if it is considered that torch was there,
why it was not taken into possession? Prosecution stands
with lips tight here.

19. The outcome of above discussion is that when there
was no chance and possibility for the eye witnesses to see
the faces of the appellants and their co-accused, the process
of identification was a futile exercise.

20. Reverting to the identification parade, that is also
called ‘Police Lineup’ (in American English) and ‘Identity
Parade’ (in British English) means that a line of people who
stand next to each other while someone tries to identify one
of them as the person who has committed the crime. It is a

relevant fact under Article 22 of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat,

” Sardar Bibi & another vs. Munir Ahmad & others 2017 SCMR 344, Syed Saeed Muhammad Shah & another vs. The State 1993 SCMR
550, Amir Zaman v. Mehboob and others 1985 SCMR 685 and Muhammad Arif vs. The State 2019 SCMR 631
Criminal Appeal No.1240-J of 2017
Muhammad Ijaz& another Versus The State

Order 1984. It is not a requirement of law but only one of
the methods to test the veracity of the evidence of an eye
witness who had an occasion to see the accused and claims
to identify him. The evidence offered through identification
proceedings is not a substantive piece of evidence but is
only corroborative of the evidence given by the witnesses at
the trial'?. It has no independent value of its own and
cannot as a rule, form a sufficient basis for conviction
though the same may add some weight to the other
evidence available on record'*. It is also not a rule of law
but a rule of prudence. Identification parade is governed by
Volume III, Chapter 11-G, Part-C of the Rules and Orders
of the Lahore High Court, Lahore and paragraph No. 26.32,
Chapter XXVI of the Police Rules, 1934 and various
instructions issued by the Government'. The important
features for a valid identification parade are as under: -

i. The proceedings shall be conducted under
the supervision of a Magistrate.

ii. Proceedings shall be held inside the jail.

iii. Identification shall be carried as soon as
possible after the arrest of suspect.

iv. Once the arrangements for proceedings
have been undertaken, the Officer
investigating the case and any Police
Officer assisting him in that investigation
should have no access whatever either to
the suspect or to the witnesses.

v. _ List of all persons included in identification
should be prepared, which should contain
their names, parentage, address and
occupation.

vi. The suspects shall be placed among other
persons similarly dressed up, of the same
religion and of same social status.

vii. There shall be proportion of 8 or 9 such
person to one suspect.

viii. The identifying witnesses shall be kept
separate from each other and at such a

distance from the place of identification as
shall render it impossible for them to see
the suspects or any of the persons
concerned in the proceedings, until they are
called upon to make identification.

ix. Each witness shall be brought up
separately to attempt his identification.
Care shall be taken that the remaining
witnesses are still kept out of sight and
hearing and that no opportunity is
permitted for communication to pass
between witnesses who have been called up
and those who have not.

21 In Kanwar Anwaar Ali case’ the apex court was
pleased to further add that the Magistrate conducting the
proceedings must take an intelligent interest in the
proceedings and not be just a silent spectator of the same
bearing in mind at all times that the life and liberty of
someone depends only upon his vigilance and caution and
that he is required to record in his report all the precautions
taken by him for a fair conduct of the proceedings.

22. Mr. Muhammad Javed Khan a learned Magistrate
(Pw-14) on 28.06.2016 had supervised the identification
parade. He did not perform his duty with a reasonable level
of responsibility. He deviated from the instructions (ibid)
for a proper identification parade. The  illegalities
committed by him are as under: -

i. He conducted the proceedings in an open
ground inside the jail so on this reason
alone no sanctity can be attached to this
exercise.

ii. List of all persons included in the
identification parade although contains the
names and parentage but the addresses and
occupations are not recorded.

iii. It does not indicate that the suspects were
placed among other persons similarly
dressed up, of the same religion and of
same social status.

Criminal Appeal No.1240-J of 2017

iv. It is silent that the identifying witnesses
were kept separate from each other and at
such a distance from the place of
identification as rendered it impossible for
them to see the suspects until they were
called upon to make identification.

v. Firstly Nazar Muhammad, then Abdul
Ghaffar and finally Muhammad Wazeer
were called but surprisingly every witness
after he completed his job was simply sent
back that means that he had the contact
with the identifying witness who still had to
join the proceedings.

vi. The proceedings are completely unvoiced
that where the witnesses were made to sit
and where they had to go after they did the
assignment?

23. The identification parade is of no worth for the
prosecution for another important reason. Nazar
Muhammad (Pw-8) after identifying the appellants
maintained that only Fayyaz made firing resulting into
death of Muhammad Zawwar and Muhammad Siddique.
When Abdul Ghaffar came to identify, he stated that
Fayyaz and Ijaz had made firing whereas Muhammad
Javed was driving the motorbike and same role was
assigned by Muhammad Wazeer (Pw-9).

24. It is settled principle of law that identification parade
is the weakest type of evidence and can be believed only if
it is supported from other independent sources.
Unfortunately prosecution even cannot claim that the
identification parade has been corroborated from other
independent material. Recovery of Kalashnikovs (P4) on
12.07.2016 at the instances of Ijaz (PN) and a Kalashnikov
(P5) at the instance of Fayyaz on 13.07.2016 is of no help to
the prosecution for the sole reason that both recoveries were

affected from open places those were within the approach

10
Criminal Appeal No.1240-J of 2017
Muhammad Ijaz& another Versus The State

of public at large hence exclusive possession of appellants
is not established.

25. It is surprising that recovery at the instance of Fayyaz
was made from the jurisdiction of Police Station Kehror
Pakka but the Investigation Officer did not bother to make
any entry in the Roznamcha of that Police Station or to join
any of the officials from there.

26. Coming to the recovery of motorbike at the instance
of Javed, it is also of no worth on a simple ground that
Javed has been acquitted which has not been taken to any
exception by the prosecution.

27. The positive report of firearm expert shall also play
no role in this case once the recoveries have been
disbelieved. 12 empties were collected from crime scene on
31.05.2016 and surprisingly sent to expert on 21.06.2016
just one day earlier to the arrest of appellants and Javed. No
explanation is there that why the empties were kept in
Police Station and were sent just 24 hours earlier to the
arrest of appellants and their co-accused? Even from this
dimension the report of PFSA has lost its value and cannot
be used against appellants.

28. There is no need to discuss the medical evidence
because it has not been denied that Zawwar Hussain,
Muhammad Siddique and Muhammad Zahid sustained the
injuries and later on Zawwar Hussain and Muhammad
Siddique had died.

29. The reasonable doubt standard is a fundamental part
of jurisprudence which once arisen, cannot be refused and
denied. This means that the prosecution must present
propositions which preclude "reasonable doubt" in the mind
of a reasonable person as to the guilt of accused. Therefore,

beneficiary of this failure by the prosecution under all the
Criminal Appeal No.1240-J of 2017

Muhammad Ijaz& another Versus The State

Adeel

circumstances shall be the one who is called favorite child
of law.

30. I therefore finally conclude that prosecution has not
been able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt against
both the appellants hence this Appeal is allowed. Impugned
judgment dated 25.04.2017 is set_aside. Appellants are
acquitted from the case. They are in custody and shall be
released forthwith if not required in any other case. The
case property shall be dealt in the same manners as directed

by the learned trial court.
