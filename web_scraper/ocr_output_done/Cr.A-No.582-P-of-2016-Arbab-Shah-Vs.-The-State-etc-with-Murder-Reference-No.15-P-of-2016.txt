QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- This criminal

appeal has arisen out of conviction of the
appellant, Arab Shah, under Section 302 (b)
PPC; and sentence of death awarded to him
by the learned trial Court/Additional Sessions

Judge-V, Charsadda, vide impugned
judgment dated 21.09.2016; whereby, the
appellant was also held liable to payment of
compensation amounting to Rs.200000/-;
which, on recovery, was to be paid to the legal
heirs of the deceased as required under
Section 544-A Cr.PC; with further order that
the amount of compensation shall be
recoverable as arrears of land revenue under
Section 544-A (2) Cr.PC or in default thereof
the appellant shall undergo S.I for six months.
The appellant was also convicted under
Section 324 PPC for attempt on the life of
complainant, Rehmat Shah, and sentenced to
five years R.| and fine of Rs.50,000/-, or in
default of payment of fine to six months S.I.
The appellant was ordered to be hanged by
neck till he was dead; and benefit of Section
382-B Cr.PC was extended to him.
Simultaneously, a reference under Section
374 Cr.PC was sent to this Court for
confirmation of the sentence awarded to the
appellant; with direction that the death

sentence shall not be executed until it was
confirmed by this Court. In the same
judgment, co-accused Shabbir Khan and Noor
Jamil were declared proclaimed offenders,
and perpetual warrants of arrest were issued
against them.

2. The case vide FIR No.481 dated
28.08.2014 under Sections 302/324/34 PPC
Police Station Charsadda was registered on the
report of Rahat Shah, complainant, who
reported to Iftikhar Ahmed ASI (PW.2) in the
casualty of Charsadda Hospital that he along
with his brother Azeem Shah, were present at
07.30 hours on 28.08.2014 in Gul Baba Kanday,
Rajjar, when in the meantime his father Arab
Shah son of Khuidad Shah i.e. the appellant and
his brother Shabbir Khan son of Arab Shah, the
absconding co-accused, and Noor Jamil, the
other absconding co-accused, came there and
opened firing at them, with which his brother
Azeem Shah was hit while he escaped unhurt.
The motive for the offence was cited as dispute
over landed property. The occurrence was

shown to have been witnessed by the other
people present there at the time of occurrence.
The murasila drafted by the said Iftikhar Ahmed
ASI was thumb impressed by the complainant
and also signed by one Abdul Qayyum son of
Sardar Khan as rider. After reducing into
writing the report of the complainant, the ASI
prepared injury sheet of injured Azeem Shah,
and referred him to the Medical Officer for
Medical examination and report.

3. The injured, Azeem Shah, was shown to
have been received unconscious by the Medical
Officer at 08.05 A.M; and the Medical Officer, on
examination, found 8 firearm entry wounds of 1
x 1 cm, with the exception of 4" fire arm entry
wound of 2 x 1 cm, with corresponding exit
wounds of 2 x 1 cm and 2 x 2 cm as well as 2 x 3
cm, and with no charring marks visible around
any wound. The injured Azeem _ Shah,
reportedly, succumbed to the injuries at 5.30
AM on 29.08.2014 and was later on subjected to
Postmortem examination at 9.00 AM by the

Medical Officer at DHQ Hospital, Charsadda. The
Postmortem report also showed injures of the
same nature, but with different sizes and
dimensions of 1.5 x 1.5 cm and 1 x 1.5 cm with
corresponding exit wounds of 2 x 2 cm, 2x3 cm
and 3x3 cm.

4. The site plan, reportedly, prepared by
the I.0 on the pointation of the complainant
showed presence of the complainant, deceased
Azeem Shah, then injured, and all the three
accused named in the FIR, including the
appellant, and recovery of blood stained earth
from the place assigned in the site plan to
deceased Azeem Shah, and five empty shells of
30 bore from point ‘A’ in the site plan located
behind the accused at some distance. The blood
stained secured from the spot and blood stained
garments of the deceased were examined by the
Chemical examiner, who reported that the same
was human blood. Likewise, the report of
firearms expert with regard to five 30 bore
crime empties was to the effect that all the five

crime empties were fired from one and the
same 30 bore weapon. After recording
statements of PWs under Section 161 Cr.PC, and
completion of investigation, complete challan
was submitted to the learned trial Court against
the appellant; and at the same time, challan
under Section 512 Cr.PC was submitted against

the two absconding co-accused.

5. On receipt of challan in the Court, after
compliance with the provision of 265-C Cr.PC,
formal charge against the appellant/accused
facing trial was framed under Sections
302/324/34 PPC, to which he pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial. The learned trial Court
examined, Tauheed Khan DFC (SW1) in support
of search warrants under Section 204 Cr.PC and
proclamations under Section 87 Cr.PC. The
learned trial Court also examined as many as 12
PWs, including important PWs like Iftikhar
Ahmed ASI P.S' Charsadda (PW.2), who
recorded report of the complainant in the shape
of murasila (EXPA); Dr. Amin Khattak, DHQ

Hospital, Charsadda (PW.5), examined Azeem
Shah, then injured; Dr. Waseem DHQ Hospital
Charsadda (PW.7), conducted the postmortem
examination of the deceased; Rahat Shah
(PW.9), the complainant; and Khawaja
Muhammad ASI (PW.10), conducted
investigation in the case.

6. After prosecution closed its evidence,
the appellant/accused facing trial was
examined under Section 342 Cr.PC, wherein, he
refuted allegations of the prosecution against
him, but declined to be examined on oath in
rebuttal of the prosecution case or produce
defence evidence. Thereafter, the learned trial
Court heard the learned APP assisted by
learned counsel for the complainant and
learned Defence counsel; and rendered the
impugned judgment, whereby, the
appellant/accused facing trial was convicted
and sentenced to the penalty of death under
Section 302 (b) PPC and five years R.I under

Section 324 PPC; along with compensation and
fine etc mentioned hereinabove; hence this
appeal.

7. Arguments of learned counsel for the
appellant and learned AAG, assisted by learned
counsel for the complainant heard; and record
perused.

8. This is a unique and rare case of its kind
in the sense that son has charged his father and
brother along with another person for the qatl-
i-amd of his brother, because of an unspecified
dispute over landed property. If falsely charging
of father by the son for murder of his brother
could be regarded as unimaginable, it is
equally beyond imagination that an aged father
would join his other son for qatl-i-amd of his
son over a dispute which is still shrouded in
mystery, and having not been proved on the
record by the prosecution, despite the motive
alleged by the complainant in the FIR.

9. Having considered respective
submissions at bar by learned counsel for the

parties and gone through record with their
valuable assistance, we arrived at this
irresistible conclusion that neither the
occurrence took place in the manner alleged by
the prosecution nor presence of the appellant
on the spot at the time of occurrence and his
participation in the commission of crime was
proved beyond any shadow of doubt, so as to
justify dismissal of appeal and upholding the
death penalty and other sentences awarded to
the appellant by the learned _ trial
Court/Additional Sessions Judge-V, Charsadda,
vide impugned judgment dated 21.09.2016.

10. In the murasila/FIR, the time of
occurrence has been reported as 0730 hours,
whereas time of report is mentioned as 0815
hours on the same day i.e. 28.08.2014; and the
murasila/FIR contains a foot note of its scribe to
the effect that deceased Azeem Shah, then
seriously injured, was referred to the Medical
Officer after preparation of his injury sheet; but
the time of examination on the injury sheet has

been recorded by the Medical Officer as 08.05
AM i.e before the time of report i.e. 08.15 hours,
mentioned in the murasila/FIR.

11. One Abdul Qayyum son of Sardar Khan
also signed the murasila as token of affirmation
of the report of the complainant; but he was not
produced as PW in the case, for the reason, best
known to the prosecution, thus leaving the
complainant as the sole eye witness in the case
to carry the burden of proof against the
appellant. Besides, neither weapons of offence
were mentioned in the FIR, nor any detail of
opening of ‘unprovoked’ indiscriminate firing
by all the three accused, simultaneously, has
been given, and not a single supporting ocular
account has been furnished by the people
shown present on the spot in the FIR at the time
of occurrence.

12. The site plan would show both the
complainant and the deceased in the same
direction from all the three accused, but only
the deceased was seemingly made target for

indiscriminate firing by the three accused
named in the FIR, while sparing the
complainant, who escaped unhurt and did not
receive a single scratch in the firing. This
appears something hard to believe in view of
the fact that the motive for the offence ie.
unspecified dispute over property was not
imputed to the accused only against the
deceased, who was the real brother of the
complainant, son of the appellant, and brother
of absconding accused Shabbir Khan. Even in
the site plan, the vacant plot of Azeem Shah
deceased has not been shown as the bone of
contention between the parties.

13. The I.0 recovered five empty shells of
30 bore from point ‘A’, shown in the site plan
behind the three accused named in the FIR; at
almost equal distance from them, which were
sent to the firearms expert, who opined that the
five 30 bore crime empties were fired from one
and the same 30 bore weapon; thereby
suggesting commission of offence by one

person, whereas three persons have been
charged for firearm injuries to the deceased,
having the same size and dimension of 1 x 1 cm,
barring injury No.4 of 2 x 1 cm size, in the
injury sheet; and 1.5 x 1.5 cm in the
postmortem report, and only two entry wounds
No.2 and 8 of the size of 1 x 1.5 cm. Both the
medical and P.M reports show five out of 8
firearms entry wounds on the back side of the
deceased, whereas the deceased has been
shown in the site plan in front of the accused.

14. According to the murasila/FIR,
complainant, Rahat Shah_ reported _ the
occurrence in the casualty of Charsadda
Hospital, where the report, in the ordinary
course, should have been recorded by the police
officer/official present on duty in the casualty;
but in this case scribe of the murasila i.e.
Iftikhar Ahmed ASI (PW.2), reportedly, received
information about the occurrence and
proceeded to the casualty of Charsadda
Hospital where the complainant lodged the

report to him; which fact would indeed create
suspicion about the recording of the murasila,
and FIR based thereupon, particularly in the
light of the fact that complainant, Rahat Shah
(PW9), categorically stated in his statement
before the Court that he had made report in the
hospital to the doctor and that the doctor
reduced his report in to writing and obtained
his thumb impression on the same and further
that he had made report to the doctor in the
emergency. It may also be noted that the
complainant, according to his own statement,
was running his business on a donkey cart
during the days of occurrence, and he did not
furnish any explanation, let alone plausible
explanation, for his presence in his house on the
day of occurrence.

15. The above noted discrepancies in the
case of prosecution against the appellant,
perhaps, escaped notice of the learned trial
Court while awarding death penalty and other
sentences to the appellant. The abscondence of

the appellant for some time, which alone
cannot lead to his _ conviction unless
corroborated by other incriminating evidence
against him, notwithstanding , the case of
prosecution against the appellant is replete
with doubts, and falls short of the required
standard of proof, essentially required for
recording the judgment of conviction of an
accused and awarding him sentence of death.

16. While empathetically observing that
these findings are confined only to the case of
the appellant, having no bearing on the case
against the absconding co-accused who are still
fugitive from law and have not yet surrendered
to the process of law like the appellant, the
appeal is accepted and the impugned judgment
dated 21.09.2016 of the learned _ trial
Court/Additional Sessions Judge-V Charsadda
is set aside. Consequently, the appellant is
acquitted of the charges, and he be released

from jail, if not required in any other case.
17. Murder Reference No.15-P/2016 sent
by the learned trial Court for confirmation of

the sentence is answered in the negative.
