MOHAMMAD _ IBRAHIM KHAN, __J:-.
Through this bail petition, petitioners Rahat
Gul and Niamat Ullah seek their release on
bail in case FIR No. 1414 dated 15.11.2022
under Sections 9-D/ 11-B KP CNSA 2019/
15 AA, registered at Police Station Rehman

Baba, Peshawar. Earlier their bail petition

2 was dismissed by the order of learned Addl:

Sessions Judge/CPC, Peshawar on
26.11.2022.
2. As per contents of report, the

local police after observing relevant
protocol, raided the baitak of petitioner
Rahat Gul on spy information qua selling of
narcotics; where petitioners alongwith co-
accused Hidayat Ullah were busy in
preparation of token/packing of heroin and
Ice. On personal search a pistol .30 bore
FF1603 alongwith two spare magazine and
22 live rounds of .30 bore were recovered
from possession of petitioner Niamat Ullah.
Further search of the baitak, led to the
recovery of 28 token of heroin weighing 28
grams, heroin lying in shopping bag
weighing 1127 grams, 11 sachet of Ice
weighing 11 grams, Ice recovered from
shopping bag weighing 175 grams
alongwith small spoon, scissor, stapler, one
digital scale and 11 plastic sachet as well as
other packing material from the said baitak.
The contraband alongwith above articles
were taken into custody, the accused were
arrested and a case vide FIR mentioned

above was registered against them.
3. Arguments heard and available
record gone through.
4. Admittedly, neither the Baitak

from which the alleged contraband was
recovered, is ownership of petitioner Niamat
Ullah nor the alleged contraband except
pistol .30 bore and rounds were recovered
from his immediate possession; rather the
said building was ownership of co petitioner
Rahat Gul, which makes the case of
petitioner Niamat Ullah that of further
inquiry. Though a pistol .30 bore alongwith
rounds were recovered from possession of
petitioner, for which the offence would not
bring his case for refusal of bail. Therefore,
this bail petition to the extent of petitioner
Niamat Ullah is allowed and he is admitted
to bail subject to furnishing bail bonds in the
sum of Rs.100,000/- (one lac) with two
sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of learned Illaqa/ Duty Judicial

Magistrate concerned; who shall ensure that
the sureties are local, reliable and men of
means.

5. So far as case of petitioner
Rahat Gul is concerned, the baitak in
question was his ownership and huge
quantity of narcotics has been recovered
from the same in his presence as well as
presence of marginal witnesses; who in their
statements under Section 161 Cr.PC affirm
the version of prosecution qua recovery of
narcotics from his baitak. The report of FSL
also affirms the version of prosecution,
according to which the recovered
contraband were heroin and meth
amphetamine. Learned counsel failed to
point out any malafide or ill will on the part
of prosecution to the extent of petitioner
Rahat Gul, against whom, sufficient material
has been collected by prosecution, which
prima facie connects him with the
commission of a heinous offence, falling
under the prohibitory clause of Section 497

CrPC, therefore, this bail petition to the
extent of petitioner Rahat Gul is dismissed.
However, the prosecution is directed to
submit complete challan against accused
within a fortnight and thereafter, the learned
trial Court is expected to conclude the trial
expeditiously.

The ibid observations are the
tentative assessment of the material
available on the record of the case, which
shall not influence the mind of the learned
trial Court in any manner at the time of
deciding the wheel of fortune of the accused
in either his acquittal or conviction within

the legal framework.
