Crl Rev. No. 18883 of 2019

2. Feeling aggrieved by the trial court's judgment, Allah Rakha alias
Mithu and Muhammad Javed, the appellants have assailed their convictions by
filing Crl. Appeal No.17661 of 2019. It is pertinent to mention here that the
complainant also filed Crl. Rev. No.18883 of 2019 qua enhancement of sentence
awarded to the appellants. The matters arising from the same trial court judgment

are being disposed of through consolidated judgment.

3. The prosecution story as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex. PA/1) lodged on
the complaint (Ex. PA) of Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant is that on
25.06.2014, marriage ceremony of Zawar Hussain was scheduled and in
connection of which, the complainant (PW-1) along with his brothers, Muhammad
Irfan alias Khan (since dead) and Shahbaz (injured PW) were present there. On
the same day, at about 5/6 p.m. evening, the appellants, along with their co-
accused persons, equipped with their respective weapons, came there and raised
lalkara, that Muhammad Irfan alias Khan should have been taught a lesson for
abducting the woman. After that, the accused persons started aerial firing; the
accused, Allah Rakha, fired at Muhammad Irfan alias Khan, which hit the front of
his chest, whereas the accused, Javed alias Jajju, fired at Muhammad Irfan alias
Khan (since dead), which landed at right armpit of Muhammad Irfan alias Khan.
After that, the accused, Javed, made a fire shot, which hit the left buttock of
Shahbaz Ahmad (injured PW). The accused, Allah Rakha alias Mithu, also

received injuries from the firing of his co-accused.

The motive behind the occurrence was that one year prior to the
alleged occurrence, Muhammad Irfan alias Khan (since dead) got married to a

woman of the accused persons without the consent of the accused persons.

4. Upon receiving the information of the occurrence, Muhammad
Nawaz S.I. (PW-11) reached the place of occurrence, where the complainant (PW-
1), submitted an application (Ex. PA) to Muhammad Nawaz SI. (PW-11) for

registration of F.IL.R; after that, on completion of police karawai, Muhammad
Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 & 3
Crl Rev. No. 18883 of 2019

Nawaz S.I. (PW-11) sent the same to the Police Station through Imdad Hussain
538/C (not cited as a witness), whereupon formal F.I.R. (Exh. PA/1) was chalked
out by Muhammad Arif, Head Constable (PW-5).

5. After registration of the case, the investigation of this case was
conducted by Muhammad Nawaz, S.I. (PW-11), who, having found the appellants
guilty, prepared a challan under section 173 Cr.P.C. and sent the same to the court
of competent jurisdiction. On 02.02.2018, the trial court formally charge-sheeted
the appellants, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In support of its

version, the prosecution produced as many as thirteen (13) witnesses.

6. After the closure of prosecution evidence, the appellants were
examined under Section 342 of Cr.P.C., wherein neither they opted to appear as
their own witnesses in terms of Section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. nor to produce evidence in
their defence. In response to a particular question that why this case was against
them and why the PWs had deposed against them, the appellants made the
following depositions: -

6

‘Sometime prior to the occurrence Irfan deceased
kidnapped Gul Naz and took her to Faisalabad. I
got returned Gul Naz from Irfan deceased through

punchait due to the grudge the complainant booked
me in this false case. All the PWs are inter-se related

and deposed against me with malafide intention.”

7. After recording evidence and evaluating the evidence available on
record in the light of the arguments advanced by both sides, the trial court found
the prosecution version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, which

resulted in the appellants’ conviction in the afore-stated terms.

8. I have heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the

parties and have minutely perused the record on the file.
Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 & 4
Crl Rev. No. 18883 of 2019

9. In the instance case, the occurrence occurred on 25.06.2014 at
05/06:00 p.m. in Chak No.442/J.B. situated within the jurisdiction of Police
Station, Mochiwala, District Jhang, which is 14 miles from the place of
occurrence. Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant, brother of Muhammad
Irfan (the deceased) and Shahbaz Ali (PW-2)-injured, reported the incident
through written application (Ex. PA) to Muhammad Nawaz, S.I. (PW-11)-the
investigating officer at Chak No.442/J.B at 08:15 p.m., whereupon Muhammad
Nawaz S.J. (PW-11) incorporated police proceedings at the end of written
complaint (Ex. PA) and sent the same through Imdad Hussain 538/C (not cited as
witness) to the police station, based on which, formal F.I.R. (Exh. PA/1) was
chalked out on the same day at 09:00 p.m. by Muhammad Arif 980/HC (PW-5).
Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during his examination-in-

chief that: -

“I_ was about to move to police station but the
police reached at the spot. After taking down
the application Exh. P-A I presented the same
before the police. Exh. P-A bear_my thumb
impression. The contents of the application are

true."

Whereas, during cross-examination, he (PW-1)-the complainant, deposed that-

“I got written the application for registration of
case from Safdar but he is not the witness of the

case. Safdar did not make any statement to the
1.0.”

Shahbaz Ali (PW-2)-the injured witness deposed during cross-examination that: -
“When police reached at _the_place_ of
occurrence first of all my elder brother
presented application to police at the place of

occurrence.”

Riaz Ahmad (PW-3)-the eye witness deposed during cross-examination that: -
Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 & 5
Crl Rev. No. 18883 of 2019

“Afzal got drafted application for registration
of case prior to the arrival of police. Pen and
papers were brought by Safdar for drafting

application for registration of case. Safdar _is
not related to me however he is related to the

is situated at a distance of 1 k.m from the place
of occurrence.”

It is the prosecution's case that after the occurrence, Muhammad
Afzal (PW-1), the complainant, was about to move to the police station, but the
police arrived. It is relevant to mention that the occurrence occurred at 05/06:00
p.m. and was reported to the police at 08:15 p.m. on 25.06.2014. Shahbaz Ali
(PW-2)-the injured witness remained at the place of the incident for about two
hours, but none of the prosecution witnesses made a complaint about the incident
nor shifted him to the hospital in the injured condition. Therefore, non-shifting the
injured to the hospital for medical treatment for about two hours was unnatural
conduct. Besides, it is an admitted fact that Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the
complainant got, drafted the application for registration of the case from one
“Safdar”. Non-mentioning this fact in the application/complaint (Ex. PA)
indicates that the complainant (PW-1) had not stated the complete truth and that
the F.I.R. came into existence after due deliberations and consultations. When and
where was the complaint (Ex. PA) prepared? The complaint's author should have
stated that he prepared the complaint under the instructions of the complainant. It
is also not a case of the prosecution that the complainant (PW-1) asked "Safdar”
to prepare a complaint. Accordingly, the complaint was prepared by "Safdar,"
which was shown to the complainant and read over to him, which was thumb
marked by him. Even the complainant had not explained the preparation of the
complaint in the complaint and his statement before the trial court; therefore, in
these circumstances, the chance of consultations and deliberations on the part of
the complainant cannot be ruled out. Even the complainant did not give any
explanation regarding a delay in lodging the report and about the preparation of

the complaint in the complaint as well as in his statement before the learned trial
Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 & 6
Crl Rev. No. 18883 of 2019

court; therefore, in these circumstances, the chance of consultations and
deliberations on the part of the complainant cannot be ruled out. It creates the first

dent in the prosecution case.

10. There is another aspect of the case; the legal position is well settled,
and the evidence of an injured witness must be given due weightage of being a
stamped witness. Thus, his presence cannot be doubted. The statement of the
injured PW is generally considered to be very reliable, and it is unlikely that he
would spare the actual assailant to implicate someone else falsely. Testimony of
an injured witness has its relevancy and efficacy as he has sustained injuries at the
time and place of occurrence. This lends support to his testimony that he was
present during the occurrence. Testimony of an injured witness is accorded a
special status in law, and such a witness would not let his actual assailant go
unpunished merely to implicate a third person falsely for the commission of the
offence. Thus, the evidence of the injured witness must be relied upon unless there
are convincing grounds for the rejection of his evidence. On the touchstone of the
position of law noted above, I shall now discuss the evidence of the material
witnesses. As per the prosecution case, the occurrence was witnessed by
Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant; Shahbaz Ali (PW-2)-the injured; and
Riaz Ahmad (PW-3)-the eye witness. Admittedly, during the incident, Shahbaz
Ali (PW-2) received firearm injuries, and the matter was reported to the police at
08:15 p.m. Muhammad Nawaz SI. (PW-11)-the investigating officer deposed

during cross-examination that: -

“The Imdad Hussain constable who had taken

the complaint for lodging of F.I.R came to the
place of occurrence after two hours of sending
Shahbaz pw to hospital.”

Admittedly, Shahbaz Ali (PW-2)-the injured, remained lying at the
place of occurrence in injured condition, and both, ie., Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-

the complainant, and Riaz Ahmad (PW-3) have not tried to shift him to the
Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 & 7
Crl Rev. No. 18883 of 2019

hospital for medical treatment. Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant

admitted during cross-examination that: -

“Shahbaz remained lying in injured condition

for about 2 hours at the place of occurrence.”

Shahbaz Ali (PW-2)-injured PW, deposed during his examination-in-
chief; after the incident, he was shifted to District Headquarter Hospital, Jhang, by
1122 ambulance service; from there, he was taken to RHC Mochiwala. After
medical treatment, he (PW-2) was referred to the District Headquarters Hospital,
Jhang. From District Headquarters Hospital, Jnang, he was shifted/referred to
Allied Hospital Faisalabad. Then, he (PW-2) was shifted to District Headquarters
Hospital Faisalabad, where he (PW-2) was operated. Whereas, on perusal of the
medico-legal examination report of Shahbaz Ali (PW-2)-injured, it reveals that he
was medically examined at 02:40 a.m. on 26.06.2014 with the history mentioned
in the column of “Brief History” of MLC that “fight at the marriage in Chak
No.442/J.B. and firing as told by the victim” brought by Muhammad Hussain
1572/C. Coming to the evidence of Shahbaz Ali (PW-2), a careful perusal of his
evidence would clearly show that it is replete with inherent improbabilities and
full of severe contradictions and meaningful improvements. After giving the
narrative of the occurrence, he detailed what happened after the occurrence; the
witness goes on to state that after the occurrence, he was shifted to the hospital by
the 1122 ambulance service, and his statement under Section 161 of Cr.P.C. was
recorded by the investigating officer 22 days after the occurrence. Shahbaz Ali

(PW-2) deposed during the examination-in-chief that: -

6

‘The accused made incriminate firing. On
hearing the fire report Riaz s/o Dalmeer_and
Amin_s/o_ Mukhtar alongwith many _ other
residence of vicinity attracted to the spot and
witnessed _the occurrence. I _was_ shifted to
District Headquarter hospital Jhang by 1122
ambulance service. From there I_was taken to
RHC_ Mochiwala. From where after _medico

legal examination J was again referred to
Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 & 8
Crl Rev. No. 18883 of 2019

District Headquarter Hospital Jhang. From
District Headquarter Hospital Jhang I was
shifted/referred_to Allied Hospital Faisalabad.
Then I_was_ shifted to District Headquarter

22 days. My statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. was
recorded by the police at District Headquarter
Hospital Jhang.”

Contrary to the above deposition, Shahbaz Ali (PW-2) deposed during cross-

examination that: -

6

‘My__examination-in-chief_was_recorded_on
03.02.2018 _ before _ this _ court..---------- Pw

Muhammad Nawaz, S.I. (PW-11)-the investigating officer deposed during the

examination-in-chief that: -

Crl. Rev. No. 18883 of 2019

6

‘I_prepared the injury statement Exh.P-H with
regard to Shahbaz Ahmed injured. I recorded
his statement _u/s 161 Cr.P.C. and sent him to
hospital through 1122 ambulance __with
Muhammad Hussain 1572/C-1 for medico legal
examination, ------------ Iwas _ present _at_the
place of occurrence and after_12:00 (midnight)
the next day started. So. on 26.06.2014
Muhammad Hussain 1572/C_ presented _to_me
the MLC No.297/14 of Shahbaz injured which I
annexed with the police.” He (PW-11)-the
investigating officer deposed during cross-
examination that, “I_did not go to the hospital
for_recording statement of Shahbaz pw. Pw
volunteered that I recorded his statement at the
place of occurrence. Soon after recording
statement of Shahbaz I sent him to hospital.”

As per the prosecution case, Shahbaz Ali (PW-2), the injured
witness, stated that soon after the occurrence, he was shifted to the hospital for
medical treatment, and he made a contradictory statement about the recording of
his statement by the investigating officer. Dr. Ashiq Hussain (PW-8) deposed

during the examination-in-chief that: -

“On 26.06.2014 I was posted_as M.O RHC
Mochiwala. On the same day, Shahbaz Ahmed
s/o Inayat_Ali caste Jutt_aged about 32 years
was brought at RHC by Muhammad Hussain
1572/C_for_medico legal examination. It was a
case having history of fight at marriage in Chak

No.442/JB with history of firing as told by the
victim.”

On perusal of the medico-legal examination certificate (Ex. PH), it
reveals that the injured arrived at 02:40 a.m. on 26.06.2014 after registration of
FIR, and its reference was given in the column “No. & date of Police docket/Court
Order.” The witness does not provide any explanation as to why he did not ask
Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant, and Riaz Ahmad (PW-3) to shift him
to the hospital, particularly when he was injured. I find it difficult to believe that

although such a severe occurrence had taken place, resulting in gunshot injuries to
Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 & 10
Crl Rev. No. 18883 of 2019

the deceased and injured P.W., the informant took no steps to inform anybody,
and nobody came to the scene of the occurrence. Such unnatural conduct can only
be consistent with the fact that prosecution witnesses i.e. Muhammad Afzal (PW-
1)-the complainant and Riaz Ahmad (PW-3) were not present at the place of
occurrence. The informant also does not give any explanation as to why he took
six hours and twenty-five minutes from the time of the recording of the FIR to
reach the hospital for medical treatment. Besides Shahbaz Ali (PW-2), who

deposed during the examination-in-chief that:

"

I remained admitted in hospital for about 22
days. My _ statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. was
recorded by the police at District Headquarter
Hospital Jhang."

The statement of the prosecution witness should be recorded as
promptly as possible, without giving him any opportunity to improve upon and
subtract from what he saw. Since the delay is likely to give an opportunity to a
witness to concoct a different version. However, the testimony of the injured
witness creates doubt about the date and place of recording his statement under
section 161 of Cr.P.C. The testimony of a witness had proved fatal and sounded
the death knell for the prosecution case. Considered against this background, the
argument of the learned counsel for the appellants that the evidence of
eyewitnesses was inconsistent with the medical evidence appears to be well found.
The medical evidence, therefore, clearly falsifies the prosecution's case regarding
how the deceased and injured witness were hit. There is another vital defect in the
prosecution case; according to the prosecution, the appellants had fired shots from
eight (8) feet. According to the site plan, Irfan alias Khan, deceased, is at point
“1,” Shahbaz Ali (PW-2) at point “2,” and the appellants, along with other
accused, are at point (3). The distance between points "1 and 2" and point “3” is 5
feet and 8 feet, respectively. The unscaled site plan (Ex. PQ) and scaled site plan
(Ex. PK), which was prepared at the pointing of the prosecution witnesses. At the

same time, the medical evidence states that there is blackening and burning on all
Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 & 11
Crl Rev. No. 18883 of 2019

the injuries, indicating that the fire shots were made from very close range. The
injured witness gave false evidence to strengthen the case of the prosecution. The
oral testimony is contrary to the documentary evidence in the shape of an un-
scaled site plan (Ex. PQ) and scaled site plan (Ex. PK). Muhammad Afzal (PW-

1)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination that: -

“I_ got prepared the site plan of the place of
occurrence. I got written the names of accused
persons to the L.O at the time of preparation of
unscaled_site plan confronted with ExhPQ

where the names of accused are not written.-----

Riaz Ahmad (PW-3)-the eye witness deposed during cross-examination that: -

“At the time of preparation of unscaled_ site
plan I was present there. I pointed out to the
1.0 the place of presence of accused at the time
of occurrence at the time of preparation of
unscaled site plan. I did not point out the place
of presence of accused _on soling. The accused

persons were present towards West from the
cot of Irfan deceased.”

Although the site plan is not a substantive piece of evidence in
Article 22 of the Qanune-e-Shahdat Order 1984 as held in the case of Mst.
Shamim Akhtar v. Fiaz Akhter and two others (PLD 1992 SC 211), but it
reflects the view of the crime scene, and the same can be used to contradict or
disbelieve eyewitnesses. During the incident, Allah Rakha, the accused-appellant,
also received injuries; however, the injuries sustained by Allah Rakha, the
accused-appellant, were concealed by the prosecution. Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-

the complainant deposed during cross-examination that: -

6

‘All the accused fled away from the place of
occurrence. Allah Rakha accused_in_ injured
condition also ran away to his Haveli which was
situated at_a distance of 4 acre and there fell
down. Police picked the accused Allah Rakha
on the day of occurrence from his Haveli.
However, it is not_my knowledge whether _he

Crl Rev. No. 18883 of 2019

was_ arrested or not. I did not accompany

and later on Allah Rakha accused was shifted to
hospital. After about 30 minutes of his arrival
the LO had gone to the Haveli of the accused.---

complaint filed by the accused of F.LR. they
were summoned by the court and they are
facing trial in the said complaint. "

Dr. Ashiq Hussain (PW-8) deposed during the examination-in-chief that: -

“On the same day at 2:30 a.m I also examined,
Allah Rakha s/o Sardar Caste Jutt aged about
26 years R/o Chak No.442/JB Police Station
Mochiwala__who was __brought at RHC
Mochiwala by Muhammad Hussain 1572/C for
medico legal examination, with history of fight
at marriage in Chak No442/J.B.”

Allah Rakha, the accused-appellant, was medically examined before
Shahbaz Ali (PW-2), the injured witness. Muhammad Nawaz, S.I. (PW-11)-the

investigating officer deposed during the cross-examination that: -

“I_ do not remember if I got recorded regarding
preparation of injury statement of Allah Rakha,
handing him with the injury statement to
Muhammad _ Hussain _1572/C_for_his_ medical

examination in my examination-in-chief or not.
—————— Muhammad_ Hussain _1572/C__also

produced before me the MLC of Allah Rakha.

The MLC number of Shahbaz is 296/14, again
said the MLC of Shahbaz is 297/14.------------

The MLC _No.296/14 pertains to Allah Rakha
accused.”

Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination
that: -

“During fight Allah Rakha also received fire
injury.”
Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 & 13
Crl Rev. No. 18883 of 2019

So, the injuries on the person of Allah Rakha, the accused-appellant,
negate the mode and manner of the occurrence. In such circumstances, it could
not be ruled out that the witnesses had suppressed the original occurrence and had
thus not presented the actual version. All these circumstances make the presence
of the eyewitnesses, i.e., Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant, and Riaz

Ahmad (PW-3)-the eyewitness, at the spot doubtful.

11. Another aspect of the case makes the presence of the eyewitnesses at
the spot doubtful. The postmortem report (Exh. PM) of Muhammad Irfan alias
Khan (the deceased) reveals that death took place at 07:30 p.m. on 25.06.2014, the
dead body was brought to the dead house at 05:20 a.m. on 26.06.2014, complete
police documents were received at 05:25 a.m., and the autopsy was conducted at
05:30 am. on 26.06.2014. Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant deposed

during cross-examination that: -

“QO .Is it correct that the deceased met his death
at 07:30 p.m.

Ans. After the pause of more than 30 second the
witness replied that Iam illiterate.”

However, it is the prosecution's case that the incident occurred at
5/6:00 p.m. on 25.06.2014. As per the postmortem report (Exh. PM), the probable
time that elapsed between injuries and death was immediate, whereas between
death and postmortem was within 10 hours. The injury statement (Ex. PN) for
conducting the postmortem examination on the dead body of Muhammad Irfan
alias Khan (the deceased) reveals that the same was received by the medical
officer on 26.06.2014 at 05:10 a.m. As per the prosecution case, the FIR was
registered at 09:00 p.m. However, no plausible explanation has been rendered as
to why the postmortem examination of the dead body of the deceased was delayed
by 08 hours and 30 minutes from the time of registration of the case. It is admitted
that the FIR was registered at 09:00 p.m., but the reference to the same has not

been given in the inquest report (Ex. PP). In the inquest report (Ex. PP), in the
Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 & 14
Crl Rev. No. 18883 of 2019

column related to the brief history of the case, the investigating officer has

mentioned: -

LIP Bub? 2 CER UE gts eS by AP”
I Pugh byl Pe EF Slee Buy”

“ebb Able et orf gel Utey

Dr. Shafqat Mumtaz (PW-9) deposed during the examination-in-chief that: -

6

‘I handed over well stitched body carbon copy
of PMR_No.34/14 and _ last worn clothes of

deceased_and_ police papers to Riaz Hussain
446/C. Exh .P-M_is correct copy of postmortem
report issued by me. Exh.P-M/1-2 are sketch of
injuries. J also endorsed injury statement
Exh_.P-N and inquest report Exh.P-P.”

There was no reason for the prosecution not to send the copy of
the FIR alongwith above said documents for conducting the postmortem
examination on the dead body of Muhammad Irfan alias Khan to Dr. Shafqat
Mumtaz (PW-9). In addition, in column No4 of the inquest report (Ex. PP)
prepared by Muhammad Nawaz S.I. (PW-11), the investigating officer, the names
of the witnesses who identified the dead body were mentioned as “Abdul Majeed
s/o Ch. Muhammad Din and Muhammad Naseer s/o Abdul Haq.” Suleman and
Baba Jafar were mentioned on the last page of the inquest report (Ex. PP). The
names of the prosecution witnesses and the complainant have not been mentioned
in the inquest report (Ex. PP). This outrightly suggests that the complainant (PW-
1) and Riaz Ahmad (PW-3), were not present at the time the inquest report in this
case was prepared. These circumstances, to my mind, suggest that the FIR was
ante timed. Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-

examination that: -

6

‘Abdul Majeed s/o Umar Din and Naseer s/o
Abdul received the dead body from hospital

of same Chak. Abdul Majeed _is resident of
Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 & 15
Crl Rev. No. 18883 of 2019

Chak No.443. Baber Jafer_is resident _of Chak
No.441.”

Muhammad Nawaz S.I. (PW-11)-the investigating officer deposed during cross-
examination that: -

“The Imdad Hussain constable who had taken

the complaint for lodging of F.LR. came to the

place of occurrence after two hours of sending
Shahbaz pw to hospital, --------------- The injur

statement of Shahbaz is before me which bears
case F.LR No etc.”

All the above-said facts throw a cloud of doubt that the F.ILR. was
recorded with a delay, and the FIR has not been recorded when it is claimed to
have been recorded. Considering all these facts, I have no hesitation in concluding
that the prosecution has not been able to prove on record that the incident was
reported when it was claimed to have been recorded.

12. As far as motive is concerned, it is a double-edged sword that cuts
both sides/ways. In the instant case, Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant,
brother of Muhammad Irfan (the deceased) and Shahbaz Ali (PW-2)-injured,

deposed during examination-in-chief that: -

'

"Motive behind the occurrence was that one year
prior to_the occurrence, daughter of Mushtaq s/o
Hakim Ali was eloped with Muhammad Irfan and
she contacted marriage with Muhammad Irfan with
her_free will and against the wishes of her
parents/family. Due to this grudge the accused
with common intention committed the Qatl-e-Amd
of Muhammad Irfan and made murders assault of
Shahbaz Ahmed. Due to the effort of elders said
girl was returned to her parents _as_a compromise
has been effected between the parties and after one
month the lady was divorced by the deceased. The
accused present in court committed the occurrence
on_the instance _of Mushtaq, Ali Muhammad,
Ishag. Ashfag and Abbas."

Whereas, Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant, deposed during cross-

examination that: -

Crl Rev. No. 18883 of 2019

‘One year prior to the occurrence Gulnaz left
her house on her own and came to the house of

Irfan_and she was not_abducted_by anyone.

Gulnaz was returned back through Punchait.
Irfan divorced her. Gulnaz is alive.”

The deposition of Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant, reveals
that a compromise was effected between the parties, and no one abducted Gulnaz;
instead, she left by herself. Therefore, this court is not satisfied that the
prosecution has established a sufficient motive for the accused to commit the
alleged crime. Therefore, the evidence led by the prosecution in connection with
the motive is insufficient for relying on the testimonies of the witnesses. Now, it is
trite law that enmity is a double-edged weapon. The existence of a motive on the
part of the accused may be a reason for committing the crime, yet the Court has to
be cognizant of the fact that this may, in a given case, lead to the false implication
of the appellants. Motive is a double-edged weapon for the occurrence and false
implications. There are always different motives in the person's mind for making
false accusations. The motive for the commission of the crime by the accused was
not proved through cogent and convincing evidence. In the circumstances, I
cannot avoid the conclusion that the alleged motive was an afterthought and has
not been proved by any credible evidence.

13. The report of Forensic Science Laboratory, Punjab, Lahore (Ex. PT)
is only to the effect that the weapon allegedly recovered from the
accused/appellant No. 1-Allah Rakha was in mechanical operating condition. So,
the recovery of the weapon from the accused/appellant No. 1-Allah Rakha is of no
consequence. Accordingly, the accused/appellant No. 1-Allah Rakha deserves to
be given the benefit of the doubt, and findings in this regard are to be set aside,
and the same are set aside.

14. As it is difficult to rely upon the testimonies of Muhammad Afzal
(PW-1), the complainant, Shahbaz Ali (PW-2), and Riaz Ahmad (PW-3), and for
other reasons enumerated hereinbefore, I am persuaded to hold that the

prosecution had not been able to prove its case against the appellants beyond
Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 & 17
Crl Rev. No. 18883 of 2019

shadow of doubt as there were many dents in the prosecution story. The
conviction and sentence the learned trial court recorded cannot be sustained.
Reliance has been placed on the case reported as “Muhammad Akram v. The
State” (2009 SCMR 230), wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has
held that even a single circumstance creating reasonable doubts in a prudent mind
about the guilt of the accused makes him entitled to the benefit, not as a matter of
grace and concession but as a matter of right.

15. The upshot of the above discussion is that the prosecution had badly
failed to bring home a charge against the appellants beyond any reasonable doubt;
therefore, in the interest of the safe administration of Criminal Justice, Criminal
Appeal No.17661 of 2019 filed by Allah Rakha alias Mithu and Muhammad
Javed, appellants is accepted in toto. The conviction and sentence awarded by
the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Jhang vide judgment dated 28.02.2019 is
set_aside, and the appellants are acquitted of the charge. The appellant-
Muhammad Javed s/o Mushtaq is directed to be released forthwith if not required
in any other criminal case. Meanwhile, the appellant, Allah Rakha, is present on
bail. His sureties stand discharged from the liability.

16. So far as Criminal Revision No.18883 of 2019 filed by the
complainant, Muhammad Afzal, for enhancement of compensation as well as
sentence of the respondent Nos.1 & 2 awarded by the trial court is concerned, for
the reasons afore-stated, the same is devoid of any legal force, which is

accordingly dismissed.
