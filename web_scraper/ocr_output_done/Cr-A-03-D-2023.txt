Pre

Dr. Khurshid Igbal, J.- This judgment shall also dispose of the
connected Cr.Rev.No.03-D of 2023, being the outcome of one
and the same F.J.R No.563 dated 10.10.2021, registered at Police
Station Saddar, District D.I].Khan. Through the instant criminal
appeal, Muhammad Yousuf (appellant), has called in question
the judgment, dated 31.01.2023, passed by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-II/Judge MCTC, D.LKhan, whereby he was
convicted under section 302(b) P.P.C and sentenced to undergo
imprisonment for life as Taazir, with compensation of
Rs.8,00,000/- (eight lacs) to be paid to the legal heirs of deceased
under section 544 Cr.P.C., or in default thereof, to further
undergo six months S.I. He was further convicted under Section

404 PPC, and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for one year
2

alongwith fine of Rs.50,000/- or in default thereof, to further
undergo one month S.I. Both the sentences were ordered to run
concurrently. Benefit of Section 382-B, Cr.P.C. was extended to
the convict/appellant. While father of the deceased has filed the
connected criminal revision for enhancement of the sentence
awarded to the appellant vide aforesaid judgment.

2. Brief facts of the case, as spelt out from the F.LR,
registered on the strength of a murasila, are that on 10.10.2021,
at 20:10 hours, complainant Muhammad Aamir (now deceased),
in injured condition, reported the occurrence in the emergency
room of civil hospital, D.I.Khan, to the effect that on the eventful
night, he was present at Sheikh Yousaf Adda. The appellant, his
friend, who use to run a Qingqi rickshaw called him to his
village Wandah Balochan Wala. He took a motorbike from his
other friend Muhammad Ansar (PW-12) and moved towards the
spot. At about 07:20 p.m, when he reached near the official water
tank, within limits of Wandah Balochan Wala, the appellant,
duly armed with a pistol, was present there. As soon as he got
down from the motorcycle, the appellant fired at him with the
intention to commit his ga¢l-i-amd, with which he was hit on
back and abdomen and fell to the ground. After commission of
the occurrence, the appellant took away the motorbike and the
cell phone of the then injured complainant. In his report, the
complainant further stated that someone might have seen the

occurrence. No motive was mentioned in the report. It is

3

pertinent to mention that initially, case was registered under
Section 324 PPC. Subsequently, the injured complainant
succumbed to his injuries in the hospital, therefore, Section 302
PPC was inserted in the FIR.

3. On completion of the investigation, complete challan
was submitted against the accused before the trial Court. At the
commencement of the trial, copies of the relevant documents were
provided to him in compliance with Section 265-C, CrP.C, Charge
was framed against him, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed
trial. The prosecution produced and examined as many as thirteen
witnesses. After closure of prosecution evidence, statement of the
appellant under section 342, Cr.P.C., was recorded wherein he
professed innocence and false implication. He neither opted to be
examined on oath in terms of Section 340(2), Cr.P.C. nor did he
produce defence evidence. Learned trial Court, after hearing
arguments, vide judgment impugned herein, convicted the appellant
and sentenced him as mentioned above. The appellant has
assailed his conviction and sentenced through the instant
criminal appeal, whereas father of the deceased has filed the
connected criminal revision for enhancement of the sentence.
Both the matters being inter-connected are taken together for
decision through this common judgment.

4. Arguments of learned counsels for the parties heard
and the records perused with their valuable assistance.

5. There is no denial of the fact that the incident in the

present case occurred at odd hours of night and according to the
d

prosecution version, none else except the appellant and the
deceased were present on the spot at the time of the occurrence.
In the present case, besides circumstantial evidence in the shape
of recoveries, the prosecution case mainly hinges upon the dying
declaration of the deceased then injured. In order to know about
the mode and manner of the incident, this Court is under its legal
obligation to re-assess the prosecution evidence. Since the
occurrence was reported in the hospital by the deceased, then
injured, in the shape of dying declaration, therefore, it would be
more advantageous to firstly discuss the medical evidence in
order to know whether the deceased then injured was capable to
talk, and whether the same was made in accordance with the
settled principles of justice. In this respect, Dr. Noman Shah was
examined before the trial Court as PW-7. He initially examined
the deceased, then injured, on 10.10.2021, at 07:55 p.m, and
observed an entry wound of 1x1 on abdomen laterally (left side)
and another entry wound of 1xl cm on back (lumbosacral
region). During cross-examination, he admitted that no document
was produced before him for the purpose of medical examination
and report. He further admitted that he had not mentioned in the
report (Ex. PW 7/1), that the then injured was in senses. To a
question regarding condition of the deceased, then injured, he
answered that the injured was in critical condition when he
was brought before him. He also admitted that no certificate

was obtained from him by the police regarding the

=)

consciousness or unconsciousness of the then injured.
Contrary to the above, Dr. Mutahir Jamil (PW-1), who conducted
autopsy on the dead body of the deceased on 11.10.201, at 06:30
p.m, and found an entry wound 1x1 cm on abdomen, laterally
left side, and an exit wound 1x1 em, on back lumbosacral region.
Needless to say, PW-7 noted two entry wounds, whereas PW-1
noted one entry wound with its exit. This conflict between the
statements of two Medical Officers has made the injuries
dubious for the reason that it cannot be determined that whether
the deceased received one or two fire shots. Moreso, no
certificate regarding capability to talk was issued by PW-7.
Needless to reiterate that the occurrence took place in odd hours
of night and no source of light to identify the assailant was
disclosed in the report. In this perspective, possibility that the
patient was unable to talk, could not be ruled out and that no

report was made by the deceased then injured.
In Khyber Khan Vs. Shahid Zaman and another
(2019 P.Cr.L.J. Peshawar 979), it was held that:

For believing a dying declaration, inter
alia, one of the essential ingredient is
that the prosecution shall establish
through cogent evidence that the dying
man was in full senses, conscious and
alert to the surroundings, was fully
oriented in space and time and was able
to make a coherent statement and the
doctor present at the occasion shall
give a fitness certificate about the
condition of a dying man, but such is
not the case herein.

6. No doubt, a dying declaration has a sanctity as an
important piece of evidence for the reason that a dying human-
being is not expected tell lie. However, it is always considered as
weak type of evidence being un-tested by cross-examination.
Courts are required to carefully and cautiously ascertain that the
maker had:
e the physical and mental capacity to make the declaration;
¢ an opportunity to identify the assailant with certainty;
e not been influenced at all; and
e been heard by competent and reliable witness.
Determination of the evidentiary worth of a dying
declaration thus is left to the ordinary human prudence. A
study of the jurisprudence would show that while considering a
dying declaration, the Courts always insist upon strong,
independent and reliable corroboratory evidence for the sake of
safe dispensation of justice.
In Tahir Khan Vs. The State (2011 SCMR 646), the

Supreme Court held that:-

Mere dying declaration shrouded by and
jraught with so many infirmities is not enough

to convict a person.

Another relevant case is of Mst. Ghulam Zohra and

another Vs. Malik Muhammad Sadiq and another (1997 SCMR
449). The Supreme Court ruled that:-

“Police Officer had not obtained certificate from
the Doctor before recording the statement of the

deceased in an injured condition that he was in a
Jit condition to give the statement, nor he had given
a plausible explanation for such omission and
fitness of the deceased to make the statement, thus,

remained doubtful”.

In this respect, case reported as Raza Khan Vs. Razeem
(2018 P.Cr.L.J. Peshawar Note 66). Let us reproduce its relevant
portion because it is a recent case.
For believing a dying declaration, inter alia,
one of the essential ingredient is that the
prosecution shall establish through cogent
evidence that the dying man was in full senses,
conscious and alert to the surroundings, was
fully oriented in space and time and was able
to make a coherent statement and the doctor
present at the occasion shall give a fitness
certificate about the condition of a dying man,
but such is not the case herein.
In light of the above facts of the case law and legal
principles, we exclude the dying declaration from consideration.
8. We shall now consider the manner in which the report

of the occurrence was lodged. The evidence shows that Mishkat Ullah
THC No. 817, was present in the Police Station, Saddar. As per his
statement (PW-9), he was informed by the Muharrir about the
occurrence, at which, he alongwith constables Mushataq and Sibtain,
on different motorbikes visited the DHQ hospital, D.I.Khan. PW-9
recorded report of the injured’s report in the shape of the murasila and
injury sheet. He got the murasila thumb impressed from the injured.
He also sent the injured to the Doctor through constable Sibtain for
medical treatment. While under cross examination, PW9 he made a
number of admissions: firstly, the murasila is not in his handwriting.
He added that the murasila was written by a constable under his

dictation. Secondly, when asked about the constable, he replied that

8

the name of the constable is not mentioned in the murasila. Thirdly,
he also admitted that the injury is also not in his handwriting. Fourthly,
he stated that it is not mentioned in the murasila that the injured was
brought to the hospital by officials of the Rescue 1122. It is also a
matter of the record that in spite of the fact that a police reporting
center is available in the DHQ hospital, he lodged the report as an
official of the Police Station Saddar. Indeed, no explanation was
offered by PWs in this regard. It is thus established that the manner in
which the report was lodged is highly doubtful. This aspect is
inextricably linked to the report as dying declaration as a result of
death of the injured.

9. We now tum to motorbike on which the deceased
reached to the place of the occurrence and cellphone on which the
deceased talked with the appellant. The record reflects that the
deceased borrowed the motorbike from Muhammad Ansar (PW12)
when he received a phone call from the appellant. In his deposition as
PW12, Muhammad Ansar confirmed the fact that he provided the
motorbike to the deceased. He, however, failed to mention its
registration number. PWs Habib-ur-Rahman SI (PW4) deposed that
the motorbike was owned by one Ali Sajjad Abbas son of Ghulam
Abbas, a resident of Eidgah road, DI Khan. He, however, deposed that
at the time of occurrence, PW12 was owning the motorbike from the
deceased borrowed it on the eventful day. PW3 Zamir Hussain IHC
deposed that the appellant disclosed that he along with the IO and
other officials recovered the motorbike and the cellphone of the
deceased during a raid on the hujra of one Rahmatullah, a proclaimed

offender in village Jandar which is situated in Kulachi. It is pertinent

9

to mention that the recovery was effected by the officials of the police
station Yarik in Kulachi. In this respect, when asked, PW-4 admitted
that no daily diary showing association of the officials of police
station Kulachi, was recorded. Even an official from the Kulachi
police station was cited a witness to the recovery. PW4 admitted that
the cellphone didn’t bear the description stated in the FIR. He further
admitted that the cellphone was not sealed into a parcel. He obviously
admitted that cellphones are easily available in the market.

10. Another significant recovery is that of two empties of a
30 bore pistol from the place of the occurrence. The FSL report of the
empties shows that both were fired from two different 30 bore pistols.
This squarely negates the prosecution version as to the injury sheet
and the medical evidence.

11. The mode and manner of the arrest of the appellant also
need assessment. The appellant was arrested by Karam Elahi Sub
Inspector (PW-5). He deposed that he received information that the
appellant was in the graveyard near Sheik Yousef’s shrine. He led a
police party and the 1.0 to the graveyard where the appellant was
arrested and a 30 bore pistol without number, having a fixed magazine
containing 05 rounds and a bandolier containing 07 rounds of 30 bore
pistol were recovered from him. The aforesaid recovered articles were
put in a parcels on which were affixed 3/3 seals with a monogram
bearing “AS” abbreviation, He stated to have handed over the
recovered articles to the 1.0. While under cross examination, PW-5
admitted at the time of the arrest the IO was not in possession of the
case file and that the card of arrest was not prepared by him under his

own handwriting. Two aspects are worth noting in this respect: firstly,
10

the PWs admitted that the place of the arrest is a thickly populated
area but none was associated to the recovery proceedings there. It was
admitted that the Mujawar at the shrine was present at the moment.
Secondly, it was stated that the insignia “AS” stands for Asmatullah
Khan, who remained as 1.0 in the case, but was not present at the time
of the recovery. Surprisingly, PW-5 admitted that while leaving the
police station, he took the monogram with himself. It follows that the
arresting official—PW5—used the monogram of an official who was
not accompanying the police party. It needs no mention that the
recovery with such a monogram is to be seen as if it was made by the
officials whose monogram was used for its sealing. (Akhtar Iqbal v.
The State, 2015 SCMR 291).

The aforementioned Asmatullah SI, who conducted
partial investigation, particularly after the injured succumbed to his
injuries in the hospital. While under cross examination, he confirmed
that he didn’t accompany the police party at the time of the arrest of
the appellant and the recoveries from him and further that the file
containing the record of the case was with him. His partial
investigation included preparation of the inquest report and sending
the dead body for post mortem examination, addition of section 404,
PPC, and preparation of the list of legal heirs of the deceased, As an
investigation officer he admitted that he neither received from the
Doctor concerned the document regarding the declaration of death of
the injured, nor did he mention the Doctor who handed over to him
the dead body. He also admitted that while relatives of the deceased
were present in the hospital, he didn’t mention their names. He

admitted having not placed on the record the daily diaries.

Il

12. Regarding the recoveries, the deposition of Fazal
Hussain constable (PW-6), a marginal witness of the recovery memo
is also worth examination. PW-6, alongwith Zamir Hussain JHC and
Muhammad Zahid constable, accompanied to the place of the
occurrence, where he collected blood stained earth (mark ‘A’), 02
empties and one live round of 30 bore pistol (marks ‘B’ and ‘C’)
which were sealed in a parcel. He also witnessed the pointation
proceedings conducted on 20.10.2012 and signed the memo as it
marginal witness. He deposed that the appellant pointed out the
various positions of the mode and manner of the occurrence on the
spot. He confirmed the recoveries of incriminating articles from the
appellant. While under cross-examination, he badly failed to recall
some of the material aspects of the pointation and recovery
proceedings. For example, he couldn’t recall the time the police party
reached to, the time it spent on and the time at which the police
returned from the place of the occurrence. Similarly, he couldn’t
remember for how long he remained with the SHO during the
recovery of pistol and rounds. In short, he desperately failed to stand
the test of cross-examination.

13% It is settled principle of law that for giving benefit of
doubt, it is not necessary that there should be so many
circumstances rather if only a single circumstance creating
reasonable doubt in the mind of a prudent person is available, then
such benefit is to be extended to an accused, not as a matter of
concession, but as of right. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan
in the case of "Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State" (2018 SCMR

772) has enunciated the following principle:
12

Needless to mention that while giving the
benefit of doubt to an accused it is not
necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating doubt. If there is
a circumstance which creates reasonable
doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt
of the accused, then the accused would
be entitled to the benefit of such doubt,
not as a matter of grace and concession,
but as a matter of right. It is based on
the maxim, "it is better that ten guilty
persons be acquitted rather than one
innocent person be convicted.

In a recent judgment, the Honourable Supreme Court of

Pakistan in the case reported as “Ahmad Ali and another Vs. The

State” (2023 SCMR 781), has held in paragraph 12, that:

Even otherwise, it is well settled that for
the purposes of extending the benefit of
doubt to an accused, it is not necessary
that there be multiple infirmities in the
prosecution case or several circumstances
creating doubt. A single or slightest doubt,
if found reasonable, in the prosecution
case would be sufficient to entitle the
accused to its benefit, not as a matter of
grace and concession but as a matter of
right. Reliance in this regard may be
placed on the cases reported as Tajamal
Hussain v. The State (2022 SCMR 1567),
Sajjad Hussain v. The State (2022 SCMR
1540), Abdul Ghafoor v. The State (2022
SCMR 1527 SC), Kashif Ali v. The State
(2022 SCMR 1515), Muhammad Ashraf v.
The State (2022 SCMR 1328), Khalid
Mehmoed vy. The State (2022 SCMR 1148),
Muhammad Sami Ullah v. The State (2022
SCMR 998), Bashir Muhammad Khan vy.
The State (2022 SCMR 986), The State v.
Ahmed Omer Sheikh (2021 SCMR 873),
Najaf Ali Shah v. The State (2021 SCMR
736), Muhammad Imran v. The State (2020
SCMR 857), Abdul Jabbar v. The State
(2019 SCMR 129), Mst. Asia Bibi v. The
State (PLD 2019 SC 64), Hashim Qasim v.
The State (2017 SCMR 986), Muhammad
Mansha vy. The State (2018 SCMR 772),
Muhammad Zaman y. The State (2014
SCMR 749 SC), Khalid Mehmood v. The
State (2011 SCMR 664), Muhammad
Akram v. The State (2009 SCMR 230),

(2008 SCMR 1572), Ghulam Qadir v. The
State (2008 SCMR 1221) and Tariq
Pervaiz v. The State (1995 SCMR 1345).

14. After thoroughly evaluating the evidence available
on file, we feel no hesitation in concluding that the prosecution
has miserably failed to prove its case against appellant beyond
any reasonable doubt and the learned trial Court has not
appreciated the evidence in its true perspective and fell into error
by convicting the accused. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed,
the conviction and sentence awarded to the appellant vide
impugned judgment is set-aside and by extending him the benefit
of doubt. The appellant is acquitted of the charge levelled against
him. He shall be released forthwith, if not required to be detained
in connection with any other criminal case. Consequent upon the
acceptance of this appeal against conviction, the connected
criminal revision stands infructuous, as such, it is dismissed.

15. Above are the reasons of our short order of even

date.
