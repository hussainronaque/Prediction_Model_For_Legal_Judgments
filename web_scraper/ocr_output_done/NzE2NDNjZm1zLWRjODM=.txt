CR. BAIL APPLICATION NO.727/2012

For hearing.
10.08.2012

Mr. Abdul Waheed advocate for applicant.
Mr. Muntazir Mehdi, APG.

Though the learned APG has vehemently opposed this
bail application on the ground that the applicant was apprehended
by the police at the spot after encounter and pistol used by him
during such encounter was also recovered from him and so also
stolen property i.e. Toyota Hilux was also recovered from the
applicant and co-accused. But it is admitted fact that such incident
of encounter and recovery was relating to another crime No.23/2012
registered at PS Keenjhar Lake Thatta, under section 324, 353
411/34 PPC while in the present case registered under section 381-A
PPC at PS ACLC, East, Karachi, some unknown person as per the
present FIR No.58/2012 had stolen away Toyota Hilux of the
complainant Arif Nawaz at midnight time when the same was parked
outside his house. Since no material seems to be available on record
to connect the present applicant with crime of such theft, therefore
the alleged recovery effected after about 9 days of the incident of
theft, needs further enquiry as the story setup by the applicant in his
defence is such that the same requires consideration after due trial of
the accused.

In the circumstances, the applicant is granted bail on
furnishing a solvent surety in the sum of Rs.100,000/- and PR bond

in the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned trial Court.
