therefore has preferred these separate appeals
Cr.A. No. 200-M of 2014 in the main case and
Cr.A. No. 201-M of 2014 in the connected case
of the recovery of weapon (Kalashnikov). The
facts and the legal propositions are coming to be
one and the same, therefore, these appeals are
disposed of by way of this singled-out judgment.

4, In the sessions trial bearing case

proceedings under section 265-C Cr. P.C, the

prayer near Masjid Kaskay Dehri falling within
the criminal jurisdiction of Police Station Asbanr
are said to have shared their common intention
and committed Qatl-i-amd of Muhammad Zeb
with fire arms, which offence is punishable under

prosecution witnesses is PW-2 Mst. Amir Zadgai,
who has shown herself to have witnessed the
occurrence when her son was put to death while
PW-3 Dilawar is father of the deceased. The
mother (PW-2) has posed herself eye witness
while father (PW-3) is not an eyewitness of the
occurrence as he has been informed about the
occurrence by his daughter. The other are formal
witnesses and the Investigation Officer who have
been examined as prosecution witnesses.

5. After closure of the prosecution
evidence, the accused/Appellant was examined
under section 342 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure, wherein he negated the prosecution

evidence through his respective answers and
posed innocence.

near Gul Abad Bazar fallen within the criminal
jurisdiction of Police Station Ouch. The police

6. At the end, in both the separate trials,
the accused/Appellant was convicted and
sentenced in the mode and manner as stated
above through the impugned judgments.
7. We have afforded fair opportunity of
hearing to the learned counsel for the
accused/Appellant in both the connected appeals,
learned counsel for the complainant and learned
State counsel, record was delved deep into with
their valuable assistance.
8. Learned counsel for the

convict/Appellant referred to 2016 YLR_ 905

Umar _Gul_and_ another vs Samar _Khan_and

Aslam and others vs The State" and prayed for

' po) acquittal of the accused/Appellant as the

testimony of sole eyewitness is not worth to be
relied upon. On the other hand, learned counsel
for the complainant duly assisted by learned State

counsel placed reliance on 2011 MED 1214

thereby requested for utter dismissal of the
appeal.

9, The important and foremost
consideration would be for the disposal of the
sessions case bearing No. 45/II, which is
regarding the main occurrence whereby the
accused/Appellant alongwith co-accused Zartaj
were tried together while sharing their common
intention and charge was framed against them for
causing murder of deceased Muhammad Zeb. In
this case, the only witness of ocular account is
PW-2 Mst. Amir Zadgai. She has stated that she

being mother of deceased Muhammad Zeb, her

wer son was coming to home from the nearby mosque

after offering Zuhr prayer, when on the way the
accused Zartaj and Minhaj sons of Musafar fired
at him. Her son Muhammad Zeb got injured who

later on died. This occurrence is stated to have

wor

been witnessed by Bakht Zaman and Jameel
besides her. Her statement has been meticulously
taken into consideration being solitary witness to
the crime whereby her son was murdered by the
accused/Appellant in the company of co-accused
Zartaj. In her examination-in-chief while being
administered oath she has stated that the
occurrence has been witnessed by Bakht Zaman
and Jameel. PW-4 Bakht Zaman has been
examined, who has utterly stated in the opening

line of his examination-in-chief:-

While PW Jameel has not been examined,
whereas statement of PW-2 Mst. Amir Zadgai is
silent that she had ever witnessed the occurrence. In
her cross-examination she has come up with an

admission:-

This witness posing to be an eyewitness of

ocular account has also admitted:-

Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
In the site plan she has not been shown
outside her house. She being Pardanasheen lady has
herself stated that was busy in the household work.
Even otherwise, in this advance age the
Pardanasheen \ady like Mst. Amir Zadgai is usually
present in the house for performance of day to day
routine household work. It is for the prosecution to
prove presence of this witness. Reliance in this
regard has been placed on 1993 SCMR 417 'Ashiq
vs_The State, wherein the relevant citation speaks
of:-

§.302---Burden of proof. Prosecution is
duty bound to prove the case against
accused beyond doubt and this duty
does not change or vary in the case in

which any defence plea is taken.

Mst. Amir Zadgai is the solitary
eyewitness of the occurrence, as the other witness
Dilawar father of the deceased has admitted:

If presence of this witness being father of
the deceased and PW-2 Mst. Amir Zadgai is ousted

then it would be an unseen occurrence. Reliance has

Nawab (D.8.) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
-10-

nd been placed on 1997 P Cr. LJ 2075 "Muhammad

Anwar vs The State", wherein it enunciates:-

Appreciation of evidence---Presence of
eye-witnesses at the time and place of
incident had not been established

beyond doubt and the occurrence was
an un-witnessed one, Other
incriminating connected evidence like
| strong motive, recovery of blood-stained
| dagger and medical evidence, in the
: circumstances, could not be collectively
or individually sufficient to form basis
of conviction of accused---Accused was
| acquitted on benefit of doubt

accordingly.

This view has further been re-affirmed in
| the case law cited as_1995 SCMR 1627 _" Haroon

alias Harooni_vs The State and another in the

following manner:-

S. 302-—-Appreciation of evidence

General rule. Statement of a witness

must be in consonance with the

| probabilities fitting in the
: circumstances of the case and also
inspire confidence in the mind of a

por reasonable prudent man. If these

oo elements are present, then the statement

of the worst enemy, of an accused may

be accepted and relied upon without

corroboration, but if these elements are

missing, then statement of a pious man

may be rejected without second

thought."

Nawab (D.8.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

Here in this case the prosecution version is
un-natural and unbelievable as no one has come
forward to state the fact other than Mst. Amir Zadgai
PW-2 and PW-4 Bakht Zaman. The other alleged
eyewitness PW Jameel has not been examined.
Reliance in this regard has been placed on 2003
SCMR_ 1391 "Gul Muhammad vs The State_and
another". The relevant citation of the said esteem
judgment is reproduced as under:-

----S.302---Constitution of Pakistan
(1973),  Art.185---Appeal _—_ against
acquittal--Appraisal of evidence---Eye-
witnesses were closely related to the
deceased and in the background of
enmity established on record—They
were interested witnesses whose
presence at the scene of occurrence was
neither natural nor probable and
explanation given by them for their
presence lacked __plausibility—-No
tangible proof was available on record
that the accused and co-accused had
fired at a particular place and
prosecution story in that respect clearly
smacked of fabrication on account of
yor non-recovery of any empty from the
said place---Conflict between the ocular
and the medical evidence also excluded
the presence of the eye-witnesses at the
place of occurrence--Ocular evidence
was too weak and unreliable to sustain
conviction and its defects could not be
cured by corroborative evidence and in

any case it was not supported by the

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad tbrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim,

-12-

medical evidence---Motive set up in the
F.LR. was not directed against the
deceased---Circumstances and
incriminating recoveries could not
serve as corroborative piece of evidence
when the ocular evidence was not
believable---Stereotyped reasons
recorded by the Trial Court stood
repelled in the face of the reasons
leading to the acquittal of the accused
which were not perverse, fanciful or
speculative. Prosecution, in
circumstances, had failed to prove its
case against the accused persons
beyond any reasonable doubt and the
grounds of acquittal by the High Court
could not be termed as perverse,
fanciful and speculative which was a
precondition for the reversal of
judgment of acquittal—Supreme Court

dismissed the appeal against acquittal.

It is also much significant that while
examining PW-4 Bakht Zaman he was declared
hostile. In the opening line of his examination-in-
chief he has utterly denied that he was not present at

the spot when this occurrence took place. Even

po/_cross-examined by the State counsel yet the

probative worth of his testimony could not be
shattered:-
BP ghd SOUL GA ta Se wey

-a
This means that this witness even if has

not been declared hostile was telling lie as he was

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
wed

-13-

not present at the spot. Reliance has been placed on
PLD 1989 Supreme Court 20 " Habib-ur-Reham
Khan vs Syed Mustafa Abbas", wherein the relevant
citation (e) reads:-

" Appreciation of evidence. Witnesses
having had resiled from their earlier
statements and turned hostile. No
importance to be attached to the
testimony of such witnesses.

It is extremely hard when there is solitary
eyewitness and to hold that she has seen the
occurrence then statement of such an eyewitness
must be of an unimpeachable character as it should
come straight from all corners that the witness was
present at the spot and had seen the occurrence. But
the cross-examination of PW-2 Mst. Amir Zadgai
would suggest that she being an old lady and besides
being Pardanasheen when the occurrence had taken
place the distance between the mosque and the house
fallen to be 15/20 paces and was attracted to the
place of occurrence within 2 minutes would
definitely lead to an inference that the occurrence is
un-witnessed. Reliance has been placed on PLJ 1978
Supreme Court 247 " Mumtaz-ud-Din_vs_ The
State", wherein the relevant citation reads:-

"Prosecution case resting on solitary
eyewitness whose evidence was full of

infirmities. Prosecution failing to prove

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'bie Mr. Justice Mohammad ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
-14-

guilt of accused beyond reasonable
doubt. Appeal allowed.
10. Now coming to the recovery of

Kalashnikov alongwith charger and 10 cartridges
allegedly recovered from personal possession of
the accused/Appellant, suffice it to say, that the
alleged recovery of this weapon i.e. Kalashnikov
has been effected after long lapse of 12 years as
the occurrence in the main case was happened in
the year 2001 whereas the alleged recovery of
weapon was effected in the year 2013. Though,
the FSL report has been furnished in positive to
the effect that the Kalashnikov has been found in
working condition yet when the evidence in the
main case has already been disbelieved against
the accused/Appellant in all probabilities, this
recovery of weapon would hardly be of much
significance in respect of guilt of the
accused/Appellant in the present case. Even
otherwise, it is settled by now that the recovery of
empties etc are always considered to be
corroborative piece of evidence and such kind of
evidence by itself is not sufficient to bring home

the charges against the accused especially when

Nawab (0.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq tbrahim
-15-
the other material put-forward by the prosecution

in respect of guilt of the accused/Appellant has

already been disbelieved.

It has been affirmed by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan in case cited as 2001

SCMR 424 " Imran Ashraf and 7 others vs the

State"' in the following manner:-

"Recovery of incriminating articles is
used for the purpose of providing
corroboration to the ocular testimony.
Ocular evidence and_ recoveries,
therefore, are to be considered
simultaneously in order to reach for a

just conclusion."

Likewise, if any other judgment is needed
on the same analogy, reference can be had of 2007

SCMR_1427_" Dr. Israr-ul-Haq vs Muhammad
Fayyaz and another", wherein the relevant citation

(c) enunciates:

ro “Direct evidence having failed,
\ — corroborative evidence was of no help.
When ocular evidence is disbelieved in
a criminal case then the recovery of
an incriminating article in the nature
of weapon of offence does not by itself

prove the prosecution case.

11. The gist of the whole discussion is that

the prosecution case against the

Nawab (D.B.} Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
‘Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
-16-
accused/Appellant is pregnant with doubts. It is
settled principle of law that in case of doubt, the
benefit thereof must accrue in favour of the
accused as a matter of right and not of grace. It

was observed by the apex Court in the case of

Tariq Pervez v. The State 1995 SCMR 1345
"that for_giving the benefit of doubt it was not
necessary that there __should__be__ many
circumstances creating doubts". If there_is
circumstance which created reasonable doubt in
a_prudent mind about the guilt of the accused,
then the accused would be entitled to_the benefit
of doubt not as a matter of grace and concession
but as a matter of right.

Similar citation of judgment 2008

SCMR 1221 "Ghulam Qadir and 2 others vs the

State" Supra enunciates:-

po "Benefit of doubt. Principle of
applicability. For the purpose of benefit
of doubt to an accused, more than one
infirmity is not required. Single infirmity
creating reasonable doubt in the mind of

a reasonable and prudent person

Nawab (D.8.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim.

regarding the truth of charge, makes the

whole case doubtful."
12. In view of the above discussion, we are
of the firm view that the prosecution failed to
prove its case against the accused/Appellant
beyond any shadow of doubt; therefore, his
conviction cannot be maintained, ergo, while
extending the benefit of doubt, we accept both
these connected appeals by setting aside his
conviction and sentences recorded by the learned
trial Court through the impugned judgments of
even date and acquit him of the charges leveled
against him. He be set free forthwith, if not

required in any other case.

14, These are the detailed reasons for our

short orders of even date.
