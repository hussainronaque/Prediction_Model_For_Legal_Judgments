SAHIBZADA_ ASADULLAH, J.- Being booked in
case FIR No.98 dated 06.5.2019, registered under
Section 376/34 PPC read with Section 53 of Child
Protection Act at police station Paroa, District D.I.Khan,
accused/petitioner Muhammad Irfan son of Allah Ditta
has approached this Court for his release on bail. Earlier,
he was declined bail by the Court of learned Additional
Sessions Judge-VI, D.I.Khan, vide order dated
30.9.2019.

2. Brief account of the prosecution story, as
disclosed in the FIR, is that on 06.5.2019 at 1730 hours,
Asma Bibi complainant, in the company of her father
Karim Bakhsh, made report in the police station Paroa,

to the effect that on the eventful day at about 10:00 a.m.,
-2-

she was going from her home to the house of her
paternal aunt and when reached near the house of
accused/petitioner in the thoroughfare, there petitioner
and co-accused Muzamil catch hold of her, accused
Muzamil put hands on her mouth and both the accused
dragged her to the house of the petitioner. The inmates
of the house had gone out for cutting the wheat crop.
She was put on a cot in the residential room of the
petitioner where she was beaten and subjected to zina-
bil-jabr, whereafter, accused/petitioner tied her hands,
while the co-accused Muzamil left the spot. She was let
free after two hours by the accused/petitioner and on
reaching her home, she narrated the occurrence to the
inmates of her house. On report of the complainant, the
instant case vide the captioned FIR was registered
against the accused.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner argued
the case at length and submitted that the report was
lodged with a considerable delay and that the medical
evidence does not support case of the prosecution. He
draw the attention of this Court to the medical report
available on file and also to the DNA report, the learned
counsel for the petitioner stressed that though vaginal
swabs were taken, but after analysis it was found
negative. He lastly contended that the co-accused, whose

bail was dismissed by this Court, when approached the
-3\-

trial Court on fresh ground on the basis of compromise
effected between the parties, he was released on bail.
The main thirst of his argument was that as the offence
was non-compoundable, so the role of both the accused
could not be bifurcated and to him, the benefit extended
to one of the accused should have been given to the
present petitioner and that the rule of consistency does
apply.

4. On the contrary, it was contended that the
offence is non-compoundable and heinous in nature,
therefore, compromise cannot be pressed into service to
enlarge the petitioner on bail. It was further contended
that the evidence collected by the investigating agency
fully supports the prosecution version, therefore, the
petitioner does not deserve the concession of bail.

5s Arguments heard and record perused.

6. The record was read thoroughly where it
surfaced that the accused/petitioner has been directly
charged for commission of the offence. It is a daylight
occurrence, so no question arises with regard to
misidentification of the culprits, that too when the
parties belong to the same village. The stress of the
learned counsel for the petitioner that the matter has
been reported after a considerable delay, does not hold
ground, as delay in such like matters is nothing but

natural as the honour of both the victim and the family is
-4-

involved and the family takes high care to avoid a
stigma and it is only when no option is left, the matter is
reported. In case in hand, as the petitioner has been
charged for ravishing the modesty of a young girl and
the parents were passing through mental agonies, so in
such state of affairs, it turns hard to decide and report, so
the delay caused will not benefit the accused at this
stage, keeping in view the peculiar facts and
circumstances of the case. The victim was medically
examined where it was found that the hymen was
ruptured, which lends support to the case of the
prosecution.

7. The learned counsel for the petitioner
submitted that the co-accused has been granted bail by
the learned trial Court on the basis of compromise,
therefore, the petitioner deserves alike treatment. The
submissions so made could not convince this Court, as
no compromise was effected with the petitioner.

8. The learned counsel for the petitioner
argued the case at length and wanted us to venture into
the realm of deeper appreciation, but this Court is
conscious of the fact that while seized of the bail matter,
deeper appreciation is not warranted as it may prejudice
the case of either side, rather the Court should adhere to

tentative assessment of the material brought before.

Prima facie, the petitioner seems connected with
oS
-

-5-

commission of the offence and could not succeed in
making out a case for bail. Reliance placed on case
reported as Aamir Bashir and another Vs. The State

and another (2017 SCMR 2060).

9. Resultantly, this petition is devoid of merit,

stands dismissed. Needless to mention that the
observations made hereinabove, shall not affect merits

of the case.
