MUHAMMAD AMJAD RAFIQ, J: - Amir Shahzad, appellant
and his father Muhammad Yousaf along with co-accused Allah Ditta

were tried, by the learned Additional Sessions Judge Shorkot, District
Jhang, on the charge of committing murder of Muhammad Abid (son of
his maternal aunt) aged 11/12 years, in case FIR No. 248 dated
29.08.2018 for offences under sections 302/34 PPC registered at Police
Station Warayam, District Jhang and at the conclusion of trial vide
judgment dated 30.05.2019, while acquitting Allah Ditta and
Muhammad Yousaf, appellant Amir Shahzad was convicted under
section 302(b) PPC and sentenced to imprisonment for life along with
compensation of Rs.300,000/- in case of default to further undergo
simple imprisonment for six months. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C,
was extended. Through Criminal Appeal No.38881 of 2019, he has

assailed above conviction and sentence, whereas, Criminal Revision
Crl.A.No.38881 of 2019 2
Crl.Rev.No.43848 of 2019.

No.43848 of 2019 has been filed by Muhammad Iqbal, complainant
seeking enhancement of his sentence.

2. The prosecution case set out in the FIR (Ex.PA) by Muhammad
Iqbal Khan complainant (PW-8) contains narration that on 28.08.2018
he (the complainant) along with Ishfaq Ahmed Khan had come to the
house of Basheer Ahmad (PW-9) and were talking to each other. At
about 07:30 p.m., from the house of father of appellant, Muhammad
Yousaf co-accused (since acquitted) they heard hues and cries. The ran
near to the said house and saw Amir Shahzad, appellant, Muhammad
Yousaf (his father) and Allah Ditta co-accused (since acquitted)
quarreling and abusing Muhammad Abid, nephew of the complainant.
Amir Shahzad, appellant while armed with fire arm weapon made a
straight fire which hit Muhammad Abid on his chest on the right side,
who fell down. The accused then managed their escape by brandishing

their weapons. Muhammad Abid succumbed to the injuries.

Motive was said to be a quarrel that took place between
womenfolk of accused and complainant party which was reacted by

Amir Shahzad, while extending threats.

3. Following night when date stood changed as 29.08.2018, Ijaz
Hussain SI/Investigating Officer (PW-10) after receiving information
about the occurrence reached at the crime scene, where Muhammad
Iqbal complainant filed application (Ex.PA/1) for registration of formal
FIR; he inspected the dead body of the deceased Muhammad Abid,
prepared injury statement (Ex.PE), inquest report (Ex.PF) and
thereafter dispatched the dead body through Imran Ali 729/C for
autopsy; he secured blood stained earth, recorded statements of
witnesses u/s 161 Cr.P.C and prepared rough site plan (Ex.PK); on
02.12.2018 he arrested Muhammad Yousaf and Amir Shahzad accused;
during investigation on the lead of appellant gun 12-bore stood
recovered lying in his residential house, which was taken into
possession through recovery memo (Ex.PJ). Challan was drafted

against three accused and sent the same to the Court for trial.
Crl.A.No.38881 of 2019 3
Crl.Rev.No.43848 of 2019.

4. The accused persons were charge sheeted, to which they pleaded
not guilty and claimed to be tried. During trial the prosecution
examined Muhammad Iqbal Khan complainant (PW-8) (step uncle of
deceased) and Basheer Ahmad (PW-9) in support of ocular account;
Ijaz Hussain Sub-Inspector Investigating Officer as PW-10; Dr. Safdar
Abbas (PW-3), who conducted post mortem examination of
Muhammad Abid; rest of the witnesses were more or less formal in
nature and they made statements about their respective roles during the
course of investigation. After close of prosecution evidence accused
persons were examined under section 342 Cr.P.C. wherein they have
controverted all the allegations levelled against them and pleaded their
innocence, however, in response to a question that why this case
against you and why PWs deposed against you? the appellant replied as

under: -

“All the PWs are related inter-se and inimical to me and my
family upon dispute of land. I am innocent. Deceased was my
khalazad brother and I have no previous any kind of enmity
with him. I.O also admitted during cross examination that I
have no enmity with the deceased previously and this fact was
proved during investigation. In fact, complainant and PWs
were not present at the spot, when occurrence took place.
Complainant and PW Ishfaq are resident of Tehsil 18-Hazari
which is as at a distance of 50/60 K.m. from the place of
occurrence. This distance was disclosed by complainant
himself during cross examination. No plausible specific reason
had come on the record during investigation that why they were
present near the place of occurrence at time of occurrence.
Basheer PW is not resident of the vicinity where occurrence
took place and this fact is visible from un-scaled site plan and
scaled site plans of the place of occurrence, because in the four
sides of the place of occurrence the house of Basheer PW was
not shown by the 1.0 and Draftsman. Occurrence took place
unintentionally, for the reason mother and sister of the
deceased who are legal heirs of the deceased have forgiven me
and my co-accused in the name of Almighty Allah. 1.0 also in
league with the complainant does not delete the offence and
wrongly challaned me in murder case despite the fact that all
above said situation of occurrence had taken place
unintentionally. I am innocent. I may be acquitted from the
charge.”

The appellant did not opt to lead any evidence in his defence or make
statement under Section 340(2) of Cr.P.C. On conclusion of trial above

conviction and sentence was recorded and passed against Amir
Crl.A.No.38881 of 2019 4
Crl.Rev.No.43848 of 2019.

Shahzad, appellant whereas Allah Ditta and Muhammad Yousaf co-
accused were acquitted.

5. The learned counsel for the appellant argued that totally a false
prosecution was initiated against the appellant which is reflected from
the facts that FIR was registered with a delay of more than five hours
and postmortem examination of the deceased after thirteen hours,
complainant and Ashfaq Ahmad Khan were not the resident of place of
occurrence and status of Basheer Ahmed as witness is also under
challenge because his house is not cited in the site plan, recovery of
gun 12 bore is also inconsequential because no crime empty was
collected from the place of occurrence. He also alleges contradiction in

ocular and medical account for a favour to appellant if acquitted.

6. The learned Deputy Prosecutor General assisted by learned
counsel for the complainant however, defended the impugned judgment
by arguing that complainant or the witnesses had no animosity towards
the accused/appellant to falsely implicate him and mere on the basis of
ocular account accused/appellant can be convicted because if other
types of evidence are not qualified to be weighed on standard of proof
i.e., beyond reasonable doubt, then they can be valued on basis of a
floating standard of proof to take a support for the ocular account in
this case and net result is proving of case beyond reasonable doubt by
the prosecution. Further states that though three accused were
nominated in the FIR but fire was attributed to the present appellant
and gun 12 bore also stood recovered from him which is corroborative
evidence. Further adds that doctor has clearly observed injury caused
by firearm weapon on the locale as deposed by the witnesses, therefore,
facts in issue in this case that deceased had died of firearm injury which
was caused by the accused/appellant and that too with a gun stood

proved and nothing else is required to prove guilt of the appellant.

7. I have heard the respective arguments and examined the

evidence with the help of proponent and opponent.

8. Before commenting upon the evidence of prosecution, it is

essential to highlight that deceased was a boy of 11/12 years of age
Crl.A.No.38881 of 2019 5
Crl.Rev.No.43848 of 2019.

who had no enmity with anybody including the appellant who was his
Khalazad. Complainant was his step uncle whereas mother and sister of
the deceased had not supported the prosecution case and at one
occasion entered appearance before the trial court, though they were
not examined as prosecution or defence witnesses yet their deposition
without cross examination was made part of record. They stated that
appellant was having a gun and deceased wanted to snatch it but during
scuffle gun went off; both ladies ruled out presence of complainant and
witnesses namely Ashfaq and Basheer at the relevant time. It has
further been observed that accused/appellant has also not taken any
specific plea like one stated by the mother and sister of deceased,
however, during cross examination at one occasion and in statement
under section 342 Cr.P.C. only a little touch of fact that occurrence
happened unintentionally. Such situation, in no case shifts the burden
on him nor it can be considered as any specific plea. Thus, case shall be

examined in the light of evidence produced by the prosecution.

9. Ocular account was led by Muhammad Iqbal Complainant
PW-8 & Basheer Ahmad PW-9 who deposed before the Court about
role of present appellant that he caused a firearm injury on the chest of
deceased. They claimed their presence in the house of PW-9 adjacent to
the house of accused and viewed the occurrence while glancing over to
the house of accused/appellant because the intervening wall was four
feet high. It is in the evidence that complainant was not the resident of
place of occurrence rather his house was at a distance 50/55 kilometer
away at 18-Hazari, Jhang. Delay of five hours for lodging the crime
report is reflective of the fact that he was not present at the place of
occurrence. Though he admitted that Mumtaz, father of deceased was
mentally and physically fit person and he informed him yet did not
arrive at the place of occurrence until next morning that too in the
hospital. He claimed his presence in the house of Basheer PW-9 his
brother-in-law but did not state the reason for his presence and also
could not justifiably establish the house of Basheer near to the crime
scene, though claimed that it was situated at a distance of one acre from

the place of occurrence. It is essential to note that occurrence took place
Crl.A.No.38881 of 2019 6
Crl.Rev.No.43848 of 2019.

in the house of appellant and site plan shows house of Abid deceased
adjacent to it from the back on southern side but no house of Basheer
PW-9 is cited in the unscaled or scaled site plan. His claim for house of
Basheer is further doubted when he deposed that he did not help the
investigating officer to prepare the unscaled site plan and similarly,
Raja Usman Draftsman PW-4 had also conceded as follows;

“IT was not shown the house of Basheer Ahmad son of Peer Khan

Baloch near the place of occurrence therefore, I have not mentioned
his house in the site plan.”

PW-4 further fortified that PWs and complainant had not shown to me
anything for sitting in the house. Therefore, he had not shown the same
in the site plan. He verified that house of deceased was adjacent to
house of accused as follows;

“The boundary wall of the house was four feet high. Point No. 3

prepared by me is a place showing the availability of complainant
and PWs which is residential house of deceased Abid”

Considering this fact, if any anything unusual was happened, the first to
respond should have been the mother or any other living in the house of
deceased, but she did not volunteer to become complainant or witness
in this case. Basheer PW-9 who was reportedly the brother-in-law of
the complainant has claimed that deceased and his family members
were living in his house in the days of occurrence, if it was the
situation, then in scaled or unscaled site plan his house must have been

swapped with the house of deceased Abid.

10. Though complainant PW-8 claimed that police were informed
about the occurrence by him but as a matter of fact, police have already
received information which fact was conceded by Muhammad Khan

1171/HC PW-1 as follows;

“Prior to registration of complaint, the information of this
occurrence was received to me. I cannot tell the name of the
person who informed me about the occurrence.”

Similarly, Basheer Ahmad PW-9 deposed during cross examination as

under;
Crl.A.No.38881 of 2019 7
Crl.Rev.No.43848 of 2019.

“T did not inform the police about the occurrence. PW Volunteered
that someone else informed the police. It did not come to my
knowledge as to who informed the police. In my presence the
complainant did not inform the police.”

Complainant even did not accompany the police with dead body to the
hospital and deposed like as under;
“T did not accompany the police to the Hospital with the dead body.

PW volunteered that subsequently I also came to Hospital. After 1/2
hours I reached the Hospital.”

He further conceded that people came from 18-Hazari also reached to
the Hospital. Thus, it is apparent from the above facts that complainant
PW-8 was not present at the place of occurrence at relevant time.
Mother or others were not ready to report the matter; therefore, police
waited for the person who could lead the drive for implication of the
accused/appellant in the story concocted through FIR; thus, PW-8 was
called from 18-Hazari to become complainant. By all means
complainant being not resident of the area was a chance witness who
could not justify his presence at the place of occurrence. He was a step
uncle of the deceased and it is shrouded in mystery that what grudge he
nourished against the accused/appellant to involve him in this case to
cash the murder of deceased, which occurrence was not supported by

any other from the locality.

11. Basheer Ahmad, PW-9 claimed that deceased was his Bhanja
who was living in his house with mother and sister and during cross
examination deposed that I.O. Ijaz remained busy in proceedings at the
place of occurrence but he did not know that he prepared the site plan
or not. He further deposed as under;

“After the occurrence a draftsman also came at the place of

occurrence. I showed said draftsman the house of Abid deceased
and my house.”

Above fact clearly speaks that house of deceased was not the same as
that of Basheer PW-9, and it is further reflected from a misstated fact
by PW-9 carrying a connotation about his separate house as under;

“Toward north of the Abadi I have a house. PW volunteered that
said house was prepared by me after the occurrence when the
Crl.A.No.38881 of 2019 8
Crl.Rev.No.43848 of 2019.

accused used to disturb/tease me. My said house is at a distance of
one acre from the Abadi where the occurrence took place.”

House of PW-9 was not adjacent to the place of occurrence and this
fact can further be calculated in the sense that both PW-8 & PW-9 have
made dishonest improvement in their statements while recording their
examination in chief before the Court. PW-8 stated as under;
“On 28.08.2018 I alongwith Ashfaq Ahmad Khan had come in the
house of my brother in law (Behnoi) namely Basheer Ahmad to see
him. We were sitting in his house and talking to each other. At about

7.30 P.M we heard hue and cry in the house of accused Yousaf
Khan son of Shameer Khan (present in the court on bail). , Ashfaq

Ahmad Khan and Basheer Ahmad bent forward and saw in the
house of accused Yousaf Khan that accused Yousaf Khan and

Allah Dita present on bail and Amir Shahzad present in custody
were quarreling with my nephew Muhammad Abid (since deceased)
and were abusing him.”

(Emphasis supplied)

PW-9 also deposed in the same terms as above, which is in
contradiction to their earlier stance before the police. According to
which, after hearing hues and cries, they while running to the house of
Muhammad Yousaf accused (father of appellant) reached there. It was,
of course, in response to a real fact emerged during investigation that in
fact house of deceased and accused were adjacent to each other and
there was no house of Basheer Ahmad PW-9 near to the place of
occurrence and in order to show that deceased was living in his house
was an exaggeration to claim his presence near to the place of
occurrence. A serious cloud was cast on the claim of PW-9 about his
presence at the place of occurrence when he deposed during cross
examination as under: -

“IT went to the Tehsil Headquarter Hospital, Shorkot subsequently

through motor cycle. Complainant did not go with me there. It is not

in my knowledge that I went first or complainant went first to the
Hospital. I reached the hospital in the morning.”

If he was the maternal uncle of the deceased, it was not expected from
him to stay behind which is against the normal human conduct
particularly when throughout his evidence he did not say anything for
his business to secure the crime scene or for any other function. It too

was not the case because if he was there, he must have secured the cot
Crl.A.No.38881 of 2019 9
Crl.Rev.No.43848 of 2019.

upon which the body was put and cartridge casing which he claimed as
had seen falling on the ground after fire. This witness also toed the line
of PW-8 with respect to situation of deceased after receiving fire shot,
like wriggling, no attempt to stop oozing of blood, putting on cot, not
staining of his clothes with blood of deceased etc., and it was like
verbatim showing a tutored impression. Thus, his testimony was not

confidence inspiring so as to rely on.

12. The occurrence took place on 28.08.2018 at 07:30 p.m. but
matter was reported to the police on 29.08.2018 at 12:50 a.m. i.e., more
than five hours and twenty minutes whereas postmortem examination
of the deceased was conducted after thirteen hours. Dr. Safdar Abbas
Senior Medical Officer (PW-3) appeared for medical evidence and
stated that he conducted postmortem examination of the deceased
Muhammad Abid on 29.08.2018 at 09:00 a.m. whereas police papers
were received to him at 05:00 a.m.; this delay from 5.00 a.m. to 9.00
a.m. had not been explained by him; however, this fact was deposed by
Imran Ali 729/C (PW-2) otherwise, who was the witness of escorting
the dead body for the purpose of postmortem, that he handed-over
police papers with dead body to the doctor at 08:00 a.m. Thus, attempt
of doctor to cover the delay remained unsuccessful. Doctor, however,
has observed only one entry wound on the dead body as under: -

Injury No.1.

A firearm entrance wound 4cm x 2cm X going right side of chest,
12 cm from right nipple. Wound was oval in shape. Margins of
wound were inverted. Blackening was present, fractures of clavicle
and ribs (02-03) were present. Right lung was injured. Major vessels
of right chest were found injured. Chest cavity was filled with
clotted blood.

No exit wound was observed by the doctor; when cross-examined on
this point, he conceded that there was one entry wound on the dead
body of the deceased without any exit and no any kind of foreign body
was recovered from the dead body of the deceased despite exploring.
He also observed blackening around the wound but non-availability of
exit wound questions the manner of injury, though he explained that
some time foreign body reaches in vertebra or spinal cord yet it cannot

be dissected unless dead body is divided into two parts which act, they
Crl.A.No.38881 of 2019 10
Crl.Rev.No.43848 of 2019.

do not perform for the dignity/respect of the dead body. Said
observation of the doctor was attended in the light of precedents and
forensic literature and found some related explanation in a case
reported as “Nirmal Singh And Anr vs State Of Bihar” (AIR 2005
SUPREME COURT 1265) which also deals with situation of lost
bullet in the body; it has been held as under: -

From the evidence of PW-9. Dr. R.N. Kumar, it appears that X-ray
reports disclosed the presence of a metallic substance and pursuant
thereto on further probing a bullet was found on opening of 5th
Lumbar vertebra. In the opinion of PW-9, the weapon used was a
fire-arm and the cause of death was shock and haemorrhage.
Obviously, this opinion is based on the finding that a bullet was
found embedded in the 5th Lumbar vertebra of the dead body of the
deceased.

It will thus be seen that the medical evidence does support the case
of the prosecution the deceased suffered a fire-arm injury and the
evidence which conclusively proved this fact was the recovery of a
bullet from the body of the deceased, which had got embedded in
the Sth Lumbar vertebra and therefore, could not be detected by the
medical team in the hospital at Chapra. With the aid of modern
equipment, the bullet was found in the body of the deceased.”

In another case reported as “MUHAMMAD AHMAD and_another
versus THE STATE and others” (1997 SCMR 839), it has been held that

the authorities on Medical Jurisprudence and the Forensic Ballistics
are, however, agreed that a bullet fired from a fire-arm may take any
unpredictable course on impact with bones, tissues etc. Taylor in his
Principles and Practice of Medical Jurisprudence, Volume I at page 446

observed as follows:

"The deflection of projectiles may occur not merely when they came
in contact with bone, but when they meet skin, muscles, tendons or,
membranes; the bullet then takes its course in the spaces between
these different structures. A bullet which entered at the ankle has
been known to make its exit at the knee; and another, which entered
at the back of the left shoulder, passed around the inside of the
scapula and was found below the right ear. This deflection of bullet
by slight obstacles has been ascribed partly to the obliquity with
which it strikes, and partly to the rotary motion in its axis. The same
deviation has been found to occur when the bullet was fired near or
at a distance provided that it was fired from an old fashioned
fire-arm, or was a rounded missile. The modern small-bore rifle
bullet has a much greater tendency to preserve its course, though
there are many published cases which indicate that deflections are
frequent."
Crl.A.No.38881 of 2019 11
Crl.Rev.No.43848 of 2019.

Modi has also expressed the view that in some cases, it is difficult to
determine the direction from which the weapon was fired "as the
bullet is so often deflected by the tissues that its course is very
irregular".

13. Though spontaneous migration of a retained bullet is rare, yet
during a study, a spontaneous migration of bullet from arm to forearm
was observed in a case of a 24-year-old male. This study was published

in ‘Journal of Ultrasound’ (a journal of the Italian Society of

Ultrasonology of medicine and biology), Published online 2013 Oct 19.
Similarly, in an article by Saptarshi Biswas, Catherine Price, and Sunil

Abrol, published in ‘Case Reports in Critical Care’ (Published online

2014 Jan 28) (https:/Avww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4009998/) on

following subject;

“An Elusive Bullet in the Gastrointestinal Tract: A Rare Case of
Bullet Embolism in the Gastrointestinal Tract and a Review of
Relevant Literature”

Which shows that bullet can be lost in the body cavity anywhere; it

reads like as under;

“Tn the first case, a spent bullet from an entry point in the back was
recovered from the oral cavity, while the second described a missile
from a chest wound that halted within the lungs and was coughed up
by the victim. One must also consider that “lost” bullets may have
actually passed uneventfully through the gastrointestinal tract, as
reported by Morrow et al.

A bullet becoming lodged in the intestine is an extremely rare event
even though bullet injuries constitute the majority of perforating
abdominal trauma and a large part of penetrating trauma. Although
rarely reported, gastrointestinal embolization should be taken into
consideration when searching for a missile in the abdomen during an
exploratory laparotomy. In a case in which a bullet halts within the
intestines, lack of awareness of the spatial location may result in
futile seeking of the missile in the abdominal cavity.

Sometimes a penetrating bullet that punctures the abdominal cavity
has enough kinetic energy to perforate the intestines and stop after
striking the vertebral column, abdominal musculature, or even just
beneath the skin. However, in some rare cases of low-velocity
ammunition, the bullet course ends within hollow viscus such as the
small or large intestine. Such cases are extremely rare and seldom
reported.”
Crl.A.No.38881 of 2019 12
Crl.Rev.No.43848 of 2019.

All the above cited cases deal with deflection of bullet but present is the
cartridge case fired from a gun; neither any wad nor any pallets were
recovered though its dispersion was expected. Doctor too has conceded
doctor during cross examination that he did not mention the fact of
reaching the foreign body to vertebrae or spinal cord in the postmortem
report. It has been observed that he did not suggest any x-ray or nor
used any latest technique to track the cartridge inside the body. Thus,
when there was no exit wound and no pellets were recovered from the
body, the case of the prosecution becomes more doubtful with respect
to injury caused by firearm weapon. In this way the circumstances
create serious doubt about the medical evidence in this case. This
conflict in ocular and medical suggests that witnesses have not seen the
occurrence and such conflict is damaging for the prosecution. Reliance
is placed on case reported as “Muhammad Shafi alias Kuddoo vs. The
State and others” (2019 SCMR 1045).

14. As regards motive, it was said to be a quarrel that took place
between womenfolk of accused and complainant party which was
reacted by Amir Shahzad, appellant while extending threats.
Complainant deposed during cross examination that he did not show
the police where allegedly the women of both the parties quarrelled.
While explaining the motive he inflated the version as follows;
“T got narrated that accused Amir Shahzad had abducted a female
and contracted marriage with her, my sister Kalsoom and wife of
Yousaf namely Bibo Mai quarreled with each other because said
Bibo Mai suspected that my sister Kalsoom and deceased Abid used
to arrange telephonic conversation with parents of said abducted
female/wife of Amir Shahzad.”
In support of such inflated motive neither Kalsoom Bibi nor Bibo Mai
appeared; similarly, the abducted wife of appellant did not turn up who
was expected to be free after the arrest of accused appellant; therefore,
motive was concocted and fictitious. If for the sake of arguments, it be
considered the motive of occurrence, then deceased being hot suspect
was not expected to visit the house of accused, and that too while
wearing a shalwar only in month of August at 08:30 p.m. as observed
by the doctor in post mortem report. So, apparently no reason came on

the record for absence of Qameez/Shirt on the dead body of the
Crl.A.No.38881 of 2019 13
Crl.Rev.No.43848 of 2019.

deceased who was 11/12 years of age. Thus, prosecution failed to prove
the motive as well as the circumstance of death of deceased. Learned
counsel for the complainant has tried to impress the Court that mother
of the deceased appeared before the learned trial Court though she was
not examined as PW yet her statement was recorded. Wherein though
she while twisting the fact stated that it was not an intentional murder
rather weapon held by the deceased went off, yet this factor can be
considered against the present appellant for his involvement in killing
of deceased. I have observed that appellant has not taken such plea
neither during cross-examination of witnesses nor in his statement
under Section 342 Cr.P.C., therefore, this fact cannot be read against
the present appellant. Motive set up but could not be established by the
prosecution leaving the entire episode of the tragedy in doubt. Reliance
is placed on cases reported as “PATHAN versus The STATE” (2015
SCMR 315) and “NAVEED alias NEEDU and _ others versus The
STATE and others” (2014 SCMR 1464).

15. Recovery of gun 12 bore was shown effected from the appellant
surprisingly from the house of accused/appellant where the occurrence
took place. Police by the time had searched that house many times but
making recovery only on the lead of appellant form a room of said
house is nothing but mere an eye wash to add a kind of frail evidence
considering it a support to prosecution. Even otherwise no cartridge
shell was secured or collected by the police from the crime scene.
Learned counsel for the complainant at this moment stated that PW-8
has clearly deposed during cross-examination that he had seen falling
of crime empty at the place of occurrence, which is just an
exaggeration.

It was a single fire shot case and as a matter of fact, a cartridge
shell is not ejected automatically after a fire by gun 12 bore rather it is
ejected manually to reload a new cartridge. However, it is different in
case of a repeater/pump action. Pump action shotguns are one of the
most popular types of shotguns, and can hold multiple rounds. They
have a great round capacity that will allow you to spend more time

shooting and not reloading. These guns function by manually sliding or
Crl.A.No.38881 of 2019 14
Crl.Rev.No.43848 of 2019.

“pumping” the action in order to eject a spent shell and chamber a new
round. As long as the shooter pumps it back completely, these shotguns
are extremely reliable and do not jam very often. This makes them
popular choices for hunting, home defence, and even law enforcement
applications.

The 12 Bore Pump Action Gun has been specially developed
for use as a security weapon. It is a single barrel breach loading weapon
superior to 12 Bore DBBL. It is provided with a tubular magazine,
which holds 4 nos. of 12 Bore Cartridges and is placed parallel to and
below the barrel. Extraction, loading and cocking of the cartridges take
place in a single ‘pump action’ by operating handle, sliding along the
magazine. Due to rapid reloading by pump action and spread of shots,
it is an ideal weapon for counter ambush tactics. Thus, if a 2nd fire is
intended, then spent shell is to be ejected by operating handle, sliding

along the magazine.

Some references were collected on topic “Shotgun Basics:
Identifying parts and functions” from following site;

https://tacticalgear.com/experts/shotgun-basics-identifying-parts-and functions,

Extractors and ejectors;

Most single and double-barrel shotguns have an extractor mechanism that
lifts the spent shell casing partially out of the chamber when the action is
opened. This allows the shooter to easily remove and replace the shells.
Many newer models (especially double-barrels) also have ejectors. When
the action is opened quickly, the spent shells are completely ejected from
the weapon, allowing for quicker reloads.

The fire has not been repeated in the present case; therefore, no
question of ejecting of cartridge or falling at the place of occurrence
arises. However, in any case non-availability of cartridge shell makes
recovery of gun inconsequential and PFSA report to the extent of

functionality test is not helpful to the prosecution.

16. Another aspect of the matter is that during trial, on the same set
of evidence, two co-accused stood acquitted by the learned trial court
and Criminal Appeal No. 43847 of 2019 filed against their acquittal
also stood dismissed on 28.11.2023 by learned Division Bench of this
Cout, as such, serious doubt spurred out in the prosecution case qua the
participation of present accused/appellant; thus, he could not be
convicted under the principle of “falsus in uno falsus in omnibus”
(false in one thing, false in all). Reliance is placed on the cases reported
as “Notice to Police Constable Khizar Hayat son of Hadait Ullah”
(PLD 2019 SC 527) and “PERVAIZ KHAN and another versus The
STATE” (2022 SCMR 393).

17. Considering all the pieces of evidence in this case and for what
has been discussed above, I have no doubt to hold that here in this case
the prosecution has failed miserably to establish the charge against the
accused/appellant beyond any shadow of doubt. In the case “NAJAF
ALI SHAH versus The STATE” (2021 SCMR 736) the Supreme Court

of Pakistan has held that for giving benefit of doubt to an accused a
single circumstance creating reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about
guilt of accused is sufficient to make him entitled to such benefit. Here

in this case as discussed above the prosecution has squarely failed to

bring home the guilt against the appellant. Consequently, the criminal
appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment of conviction and sentence is
set-aside and the accused/appellant is acquitted of the charge against
him. He shall be released forthwith if not required in any other case.
The case property, if any, be disposed of in accordance with law and

the record of the learned trial court be sent back immediately.

18. For the same reasons, the criminal revision filed by the

complainant fails and is dismissed.
