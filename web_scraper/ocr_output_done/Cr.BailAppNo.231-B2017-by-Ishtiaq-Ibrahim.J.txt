that co-accused have been acquitted bail cannot be granted
to the accused as a matter of right but, inter alia, the same
can be taken as one of the ground for the grant of bail.

8. There is no denial to the fact that whatever is
alleged in the F.J.R cannot be taken as a gospel truth and if
the allegation of the F.I.R are prima facie contradictory to
the other material, then the same cannot be totally ignored
and can be taken at bail stage, 4S in the instant case, F.].R
is contradictory to the site plan, medicolegal report and PM
report, which fact also lead the case of accused/ petitioner

to one of further inquiry. Reliance is placed on case titled

“Shah Mohammad Khaa_and another Vs the State”
See mMonamindd Khan and another Vs the State”

(1991 PCr.LJ 65 Peshawar), wherein it is held that:

“It can also not be denied that
whatever is alleged in the F.LR.
cannot in all cases be taken as
conclusive or gospel truth. If the
allegations in the F.ILR. are prima
facie negatives by the other materials
patent on record then that can also
be taken into consideration and it
would not be advisable and just to
ignore these materials on account of
the direct charge in the FuLR. If

such defects and doubts in the
prosecution case are pointed out at
the time of arguments even at bail
stage then those cannot be totally
ignored merely because the accused
is directly charged in the F.I.R. but
these can be kept in view qua the
charge in the F.LR. and tentative
assessment of these defects can be

made even at bail stage.

9. Mere abscondance how long it may be cannot
hamper the concession of bail, if the accused found entitled

to the same on merits of the’ase. Reliance is placed on
case titled “Khan Mir Vs Amal Sherin alias Kaml and 2
: {

i,
others” A989 SCMR 1987) wherein it is observed that:

“LT have considered the arguments of
learned counsel for the parties very
seriously. No doubt both — the
respondents remained fugitive from law
for about three months but it is also a
fact that three persons have been
charged for firing at the deceased but he
was hit only with one shot. 1 am,
therefore, of the considered opinion that
the case was of further inquiry and the
learned Sessions Judge has exercised
his discretion properly which does not
call for any interference by this Court”

10. It is not the spirit of law that the accused
should be kept in jail as punishment only on the ground
that he is directly charged for an offence falling under the
prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.PC. Because a
mistaken relief of bail can be repaired by convicting the
accused on proof of his guilt, but no satisfactory reparation
can be offered to him for his unjustified incarceration,

albeit. his acquittal, ai the trial. Wisdom is derived from

the Ziaghant’s case mentioned above, wherein it is held

that:

“9. To curtail the libefsy of a person is a
serious step in law; therefore, the
Judges shall apply judicial mind with
deep thought for reaching ata fair and
proper conclusion albeit tentatively
however, this exercise shall not to be
carried out in vacuum or ina flimsy and
casual manner as that will defeat the
ends of justice because if the accused
charged, is ultimately acquitted at the
trial — then no reparation or
compensation can be awarded to him
for the long incarceration, as the

provisions of Criminal Procedure Code

and the scheme of law on the subject do

wal ED not provide for such arrangements to

repair the loss, caused to an accused
person, detaining him in Jail without

just cause and reasonable ground.”

I. The investigation in the instant case is
complete and accused/ petitioner is no more required for
further investigation, hence, a presumed innocent person
keeping behind the bars has the right to be set at liberty, so

that he may defend his case.

12. For the above stated reasons, this bail petition
is allowed, accused/ petitioner Niaz ali is admitted to bail
provided he furnished bail bonds in the sum of
Rs.2,00,000/-(two lac) with two sureties each in the like

amount to the satisfaction of Hlaq’/ Duty Magistrate.

a

13. Before parting with the order it is directed that
any observations made in this order are tentative in nature
and should not prejudice the proceeding before the learned
trial court, where the case be decided on its own merits

after recording of the evidence.
