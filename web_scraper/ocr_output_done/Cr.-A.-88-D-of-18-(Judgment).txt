SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- Through the instant appeal
under Section 417(2-A), Cr.P.C., the appellant has
impugned the judgment dated 30.11.2018, passed by
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Tank whereby the
respondents-accused were acquitted of the charge in
case FIR No.158 dated 27.5.2016, registered under
section 302/324/148/149 PPC, at police station
Mullazai, District Tank.

2. The prosecution case as set-forth in the
FIR Ex.PA, registered on the basis of murasila Ex.
PA/I, is that on 27.5.2016 at 0735 hours, complainant
Akber Khan (PW-12) made report to Allauddin S.I
(PW-6) in the Civil Hospital, Tank, to the effect that
on the day of occurrence, he alongwith his brothers
Sher Ahmad Khan, Misal Khan (PW-14) and Mst.
Bagho Jana, sister-in-law were going from village
4a) Kaka Khel to their house on foot, at about 0600

hours, when they reached to the place of occurrence

-2-

near the house of Bahadur Khan situated in Sherin
Khel, accused-respondents duly armed with firearms,
emerged from the house of Bahadur Khan and started
firing upon them, as a result whereof, the
complainant, his brother Sher Ahmad Khan and his
sister-in-law Mst. Bagho Jana got hit, sustained
injuries and fell down on the ground, however, his
brother Misal Khan remained unhurt, while accused
decamped from the spot after the occurrence. Their
relatives attracted to the spot and were shifting them
to Civil Hospital Tank for treatment but his brother

Sher Ahmad Khan succumbed to his injuries on the

way to hospital. Besides the complainant, the
occurrence was stated to be witnessed by Misal Khan
(PW-14) and Bagho Jana (PW-13). Motive for the
occurrence was stated to be a dispute over landed
property. The complainant charged the accused for

the commission of offence. On the report of

complainant, instant case vide FIR mentioned above
was registered against the accused-respondents.

3. After completion of investigation,
complete challan was submitted before the trial Court.
The formal charge was framed against the
respondents-accused, to which they pleaded not guilty
and claimed trial. In order to prove its case, the

prosecution produced as many as_ seventeen

—_l

-3-

witnesses. After closure of prosecution evidence, the
accused-respondent was examined under Section 342,
Cr.P.C, wherein he denied the allegations and
professed innocence, however, he neither opted to be
examined on oath, nor produced evidence in his
defence. At the conclusion of trial, the learned trial
Court acquitted the respondent-accused vide

impugned judgment dated 30.11.2018, hence this

appeal.
4. Arguments heard and record gone
through.
5. Perusal of the record reflects that the

prosecution case mainly hinges on the testimony of
complainant (PW-12), Mst. Bagho Jana (PW-13),
Misal Khan (PW-14), medical evidence coupled with
circumstantial evidence. Complainant while
appearing as PW-11 stated in his cross-examination
that at the time of occurrence they were present
towards western side of the accused, which is belied
by site plan Ex. PB, according to which the afore-
named PWs have been sown towards northern and
eastern side of the accused. As per prosecution story
and as stated by PW-14 Misal Khan, the accused
emerged from the house of one Bahadur Khan and
started firing upon them when they reached to the

water channel, but PW-14 stated in his cross-

-4-

examination that they had crossed the water

channel/Khwarr when accused fired upon them. The

record further transpires that the site plan was
prepared on the pointation of PW-14, but neither his
statement nor the statements of other PWs support the
locations of deceased, injured and the accused.
Moreover, PW-14 specifically stated in his cross-
examination that there was no other house at the place
of occurrence nor he had pointed out any other house

to the Investigating Officer at the time of preparation

of site plan. He also stated that after receiving
injuries, Sher Ahmad was also lying on plain area till
he was shifted to the Datsun. This version of the
alleged eyewitness is belied by site plan, wherein two
houses have been shown on the spot, while deceased
then injured was shown in another vacant house at
point ‘B’. The Investigating Officer PW-16 admitted
in his cross-examination that point No.2 assigned to
the deceased in the site plan has been shown inside an
abandoned/demolished house at point ‘B’, wherefrom
he collected blood stained earth. Complainant PW-12
also stated in his cross examination that there were no
other houses at the place of occurrence. The
contradictions referred to above, have created serious

doubt regarding presence of alleged eyewitnesses on

the spot at the time of occurrence, therefore, the

_

-5-

learned trial Court rightly disbelieved their presence
on the spot.

6. According to FIR, the occurrence took
place at 06:00 a.m, but the complainant as PW-12,
stated in his statement that after the firing, accused
decamped from the spot and they called for Datsun
which reached to the spot and it was about 06:00 a.m.
Complainant in his cross examination stated that there
is only one entrance and exit way of the house of
Bahadur Khan and only debris of 1/2 feet of the
boundary wall is available, which is belied by PW-14,
who stated in his cross examination that there are two
entrances and exit of the house of Bahadur Khan.
Similarly, PW-16 stated in his cross-examination that
height of four boundary walls of the house of
Bahadur Khan is man’s height. These glaring
infirmities in the testimony of alleged eyewitnesses
created a serious doubt regarding their presence and
the mode and manner in which the occurrence had
taken place.

7. Besides the above, Dr. Uzair PW-11,
who conducted autopsy on the dead body of deceased
depicts that injury No.3 was shown as 6x4 inches in
size, while no entry or exit was mentioned by the
doctor in his report. The size of injury, referred to

above, cannot be believed to be caused with firearm.

-6-

Besides, the PW-11 did not endorse the injury sheet
of injured-complainant and this fact is admitted by
him in his cross-examination.

8. Motive as alleged by the prosecution is
concemed, no reliable evidence was produced by the
prosecution in this respect and in view of the above
discussion motive if proved, was of no help to the
prosecution.

9. So far as recovery of empties from the
spot is concerned, general of firing has been
attributed to all the accused. Needless to say that no
empty was recovered from the place accused Saleh
Khan and the alleged recovered empties from the
places of co-accused were also not sent to FSL, which
makes the same doubtful and could not be relied upon
for the purpose of conviction. Even otherwise, this
piece of evidence (recovery) is a corroborative one
and in cases where direct evidence fails, corroborative
piece of evidence is of no avail as in the instant case
where direct evidence of PWs have already been
disbelieved. In a case titled Ghulam _Akbar_and
another Vs. The State (2008 SCMR-1064, it was
observed by their Lordships that law requires that
empty recovered from the spot should be sent to the
laboratory without any delay, failing which such

recovery evidence was not free from doubt and could

-7-

not be used against the accused.

10. It is also fundamental principle of
jurisprudence, that is, to disbelieve a witness, it is not
necessary that there should be numerous infirmities.
If there is one which impeaches the credibility of the
witness, that may make the entire statement doubtful.
It has been now settled that conviction must be based
on unimpeachable evidence and certainty of guilt and
any doubt arising in the prosecution case must be
resolved in favour of the accused. The said rule is
based on the maxim “it is better that ten guilty
persons be acquitted rather than one innocent person
be convicted”, which occupies a pivotal place in
Islamic Criminal Jurisprudence and is enforced in
view of the Hadiths of the Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H)
that the “mistake of Qazi in releasing a criminal is
better than his mistake in punishing the innocent”. In
this respect, wisdom may also be sought from the
judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan,
reported in the cases titlhed Muhammad Khan and
another Vs. The state (1999 SCMR_ 1220) and

Muhammad Akram Vs. The State (2009 SCMR

230).

11. So far as the abscondence of the
accused-respondents is concerned, in this part of the

country people do abscond not because they are

t

-8-

guilty, but because of fear and torture of the police.
Even otherwise, absconsion is not substantive piece
of evidence, it is a corroborative piece of evidence
and in cases where direct evidence fails, corroborative
piece of evidence is of no avail, as in the instant case,
where the evidence of eyewitnesses have been
disbelieved. Needless to say that abscondence can
neither cure the inherent defect of the ocular
account nor by itself is sufficient to sustain
conviction. In this respect, reference can be made to

case "Islam Badshah and two others Vs. The

sSlal Dato eS

State" (PLD 1993 Peshawar 7).

12. The whole discussion has led us to
believe that the guilt has not been proved against the
accused beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt. The
benefit of doubt was rightly extended to the
respondent-accused by the learned trial Court,
therefore, the impugned judgment dated 22.11.2018,
is upheld and acquittal of the respondent is
maintained. Consequently, this appeal stands
dismissed in limine.
