ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- Mujib Rehman, appellant, has
filed this criminal appeal u/s 410 Cr.P.C against the
judgment dated 09.07.2020 of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-I, Kurram, in case F.L.R No.133/PNT-
11/2018 dated 08.10.2018 registered under section 302 PPC,
Police Station Central Kurram, whereby, the appellant was

convicted under section 302 (b) PPC and sentence to
undergo life imprisonment with a fine of Rs.200,000/- to be
paid to the legal heirs of the deceased as compensation
within the meanings of section 544-A Cr.P.C or in default
to undergo 06 months SI. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C

was extended in favour of the convict-appellant.

2. The prosecution case as per First Information Report
(Ex.PA) is that Abid Hussain Moharrir Badama received
information that at 09:00 AM in the morning accused Mujib
had killed Ahmed Khan by firing at him. Upon the
information, he immediately rushed to the place of
occurrence where accused had made confined his own
children and was saying that if anybody came to arrest him,
he will kill his own children. PNT-II was apprised of this
situation. The Then Tehsildar and Subidar Major also came
to the spot. The house of the accused was surrounded and
he was asked to surrender, in the meantime, accused came
out from his house along with his children. The accused
was immediately overpowered and the children were taken

into custody and handed over to brother of accused.

3. On 08.10.2018, case was registered against the
accused. Meanwhile, Federally Administered Tribal Area

(FATA) was merged with the province of Khyber
4

Pakhtunkhwa through 25" Amendment and regular Courts
were established and all the pending cases under FCR were
transferred to their respective Courts of competent
jurisdiction.

4. The accused was summoned from jail. Accused was
produced in custody and provisions of section 265-C
Cr.P.C were complied with. Formal charge against accused
was framed to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed
trial. The prosecution was directed to produce its evidence.
In support of its case, prosecution produced and examined

five (05) witnesses.

5. After prosecution closed its evidence, statement of
the accused was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C Having
heard arguments of learned DPP for the State assisted by
learned counsel for the complainant and learned defence
counsel, the learned trial Court/Additional Sessions Judge-I,
Kurram, rendered the impugned judgment dated
09.07.2020, whereby, appellant was convicted and
sentenced as mentioned in the first paragraph of this
judgment; hence this criminal appeal for his acquittal by

convict-appellant.
C)

6. Arguments heard and record of the case was

perused.

7. Before adverting to the merits of the case we would
like to meet the legal objections raised by learned counsel
for the appellant as he articulated before us that
investigation in the case was not conducted properly and
there are major irregularities and illegalities in the
investigation of the case. He also submitted that cause of
death of the deceased has not been established by the
prosecution by not holding the post-mortem examination,
therefore, on this score alone the appellant is entitled to be

acquitted.

8. True that there are certain lapses on the part of the
investigation/prosecution for the obvious reason that the
occurrence in this case had taken place on 08.10.2018
while the 25" Amendment was brought into the
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, on
31% May, 2018 and the Frontier Crimes Regulation, 1901
(“FCR”) was repealed. The occurrence in the present case
took place during the transitional period when the FATA
Interim Governance Regulation, 2018 (FIGR, 2018) was

promulgated vide notification dated 29.05.2018. Even that
(5

FATA Interim Governance Regulation, 2018, was declared
ultra vires of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of
Pakistan, 1973, by this Court in (W.P No.3098-P/2018)
titled “Ali Azim Afridi Vs. Federation of Pakistan and
others”, decided on 30.10.2018. The judgment of this

Court was maintained by the Apex Court in case of

“NATIONAL COMMISSION OF STATUS OF WOMEN

through Chairperson_and_others Vs. GOVERNMENT
OF PAKISTAN through Secretary Law and Justice and
others” (PLD 2019 Supreme Court 218). Owing to this
state of pandemonium proper investigation in the present
case could not be carried out and rightly so when the Law
Enforcing Agencies were not clear that as to what would
be the forum and what would be the standard of
investigation and evidence required in such like offences.
If we look at record, the entire proceedings have been
carried out by Muharrir and Political Naib Tehsildar as if
they were acting under the erstwhile FCR, therefore, we
will not attend this submission of the learned counsel for
the appellant that the case has not been investigated
properly and strictly in accordance with the cases which
are being investigated in down districts. Even otherwise by

now it has been settled that lapses in the investigation
would not vitiate the trial. In case of “MUHAMMAD
ASHRAF KHAN TAREEN JVs, THE STATE” (1995
PCr.LJ 313 [Peshawar]), this Court has gone even to the
extent that if there is any illegality even what to say of
irregularity, would not vitiate the entire process of trial.
The judgment of this Court was upheld by the Apex Court

in case of “MUHAMMAD ASHRAF KHAN _TAREEN

and another Vs. THE STATE and another” (1996 SCMR

1747 [Supreme Court of Pakistan].

9. The other objection taken by the learned counsel for
the appellant that no medical evidence is available on the
record to establish cause of death of the deceased. As
discussed above, the occurrence had taken place on
08.10.2018 and the customary law was invogue, therefore,
death of the deceased otherwise has been proved through
the testimonies of the witnesses and legally speaking under
section 174(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898,
leaves it to the discretion of the Investigating Officer
whether he wants to hold medical examination of a
deceased or not. For convenience section 174(3) Cr.P.C is

reproduced here asunder:

“174(3) When there is any doubt regarding the cause

of death, or when for any other reason the police
officer considers it expedient so to do, he shall,
subject to such rules as the Provincial Government
may prescribe in this behalf, forward the body, with a
view to its being examined, to the nearest Civil
Surgeon, or other qualified medical man appointed in
this behalf by the Provincial Government, if the state
of the weather and the distance admit of its being so
Sorwarded without risk of such putrefaction on the

road as would render such examination useless.”

Reliance is placed on the unreported judgment of this

Court in case of “SIKANDAR Vs, The State” (Criminal

Appeal No.215/2003), wherein, it is held that;

“The contention of the learned counsel for the
appellant that the cause of death, in the absence of
the postmortem report, cannot be accepted/confirmed.
The injury sheet and inquest report prepared by the
Investigating Officer, the testimonies of eyewitnesses
and recovery of empties from the spot and all other
circumstantial evidence had established that the
Jirearms injuries sustained by him on account of
appellant’s firing directly caused the death of the
deceased. Through postmortem examination only the
cause of death could be ascertained but it could not
identify the person who had actually killed the
deceased and in the present case the postmortem
examination of the deceased was totally irrelevant
and immaterial because of the availability of direct

evidence as to the cause of death of the deceased”

The judgment of this Court was maintained by the

Apex Court in case of “SIKANDAR Vs. THE STATE and
{

another” (2006 SCMR 1786 [Supreme Court of

Pakistan], wherein it is held that;

“The medical evidence is not substitute of direct

evidence rather is only a source of corroboration in

respect of nature and seat of injury, kind of weapon

used, the duration between the injury and death and

may confirm the ocular account to a limited extent

but cannot establish the identity of the accused or

connect him with the commission of offence,

therefore, if the charge of murder is otherwise proved

through the direct evidence, the absence of medical

evidence may not be fatal.”
10. Now adverting to the merits of the case. Mst.
Yasmeen Bibi complainant/eyewitness charged appellant,
namely, Mujib Rehman (her real brother) for the murder of
her deceased son Ahmed Khan. Mst. Yasmeen Bibi
eyewitness/complainant appeared before the Court and
recorded her statement as PW-III. She stated that on the
day of occurrence i.e. 08.10.2018 at about 07:00 hours at
morning when her son left out for School and closed the
main gate of their house, she heard crying and shouting of
her son, she came out of her house, accused fired at the
deceased with 12 bore, as result of which he was hit and

fell down and she immediately took him in her lap who

succumbed to the injuries and died in her lap. She stated
7)

that at the time of occurrence her father-in-law Abdul Hadi
(PW-IV) and his brother, namely, Hamish Gul (PW-V)
came to the spot and also spotted accused with weapons at
the spot. She stated that after the occurrence the accused
rushed to his house. After some time, Political
Administration reached to the spot and she charged the
accused for the murder of her son. Abdul Hadi, father-in-
law of the complainant/eyewitness and grandfather of
deceased recorded his statement as PW-IV while Haji
Hamish Gul, who is brother of Abdul Hadi, recorded his
statement as PW-V. The statement of the
eyewitness/complainant/PW-III was affirmed by PW-IV
and PW-V, who stated that they had come to the spot after
report of fire shorts and there they observed the accused
while decamping towards his house having 12-bore riffle in
his hand. Both the PWs stated that they informed the police
station, who came to the spot and arrested the accused from
his house. The witnesses fully supported the version of the
complainant/eyewitness. The testimony of
complainant/eyewitness and other PWs are unanimous on
all material particulars. They have with stood the test of

cross examination and nothing favorable to the appellant
-10-

has been elicited from them. Moreover, the appellant has
been directly charged in a promptly lodged report by the
complainant/eyewitness for gatl-i-amd of her son, who was
real nephew of the appellant, was student of Iqra Public
School Sadda. After the commission of offence, accused
took refuge in his own house and was arrested from there
by the local authorities. This fact is available in the
statement of PW-I Abid Hussain and PNT II Musadiq
Hussain. The occurrence had taken place in front of house
of the complainant/eyewitness; therefore, her presence at
spot is natural. The presence of other two PWs, namely,
Abdul Hadi (father-in-law of complainant) and Hamish

Gul, his brother, on the spot are also natural.

11. More-so, the case is that of a single accused, where
the substitution is a rare phenomenon. The parties are
closely related, therefore, no possibility of substitution is
there in this case. Nothing is available on record that the
appellant has been substituted for the real culprit by the
complainant/eyewitness. The complainant/eyewitness (PW-
III) was subjected to test of cross examination, but no
material contradictions came to surface to cast doubt on the

prosecution version. Reference in this regard is made to the
-ll-

case titled “Muhammad Iqbal V4. The State” (PLD 2001

S.C 222) wherein it is held that:-

“Moreover we failed to persuade ourselves to hold
that the accused was substituted by the complainant
party because in the cases of murder falling under
section 302, P.P.C. substitution of an accused who is
actually involved in the commission of the crime is a
rare phenomena in this country particularly in an
incident in which single accused was involved by
nominating him in the F.LR. from the very
beginning. So much so if the parties are inter se
related to each other, therefore, due to close kinship it
is very hard to accept the theory of substitution”.

12. In view of above, the prosecution has proved the guilt
of the appellant through cogent and confidence inspiring
ocular/direct evidence. The learned trial Court has rightly
awarded the conviction and sentence to the appellant which
needs no interference by this Court and the conviction and
sentence awarded to the appellant is maintained and the
appeal is dismissed. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C is

extended to the convict-appellant.
