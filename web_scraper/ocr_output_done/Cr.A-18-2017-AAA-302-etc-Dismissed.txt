AHMAD ALI, J. Through the instant appeal under
section 417 Cr.P.C, the appellant has impugned the
judgment dated 09.12.2016, whereby the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-III, Nowshera, has
acquitted the accused-respondents (Akhtar Ali &
Niaz Ali) from the charge leveled against them
under sections 302/324-PPC, in case FIR No.806
dated 28.10.2013, registered at Police Station

Nowshera Kalan.

2. Brief facts of the case, as per FIR, are that it
is lodged on the basis of Murasila, wherein the
complainant Muhammad Tahir reported the matter
to the effect that he alongwith his brother Ibrahim
and father Muhammad Akram were going on their
motorcycle 100 CC, red in colour, to know the well
being of a patient. When they reached to the spot of

occurrence, accused-respondents, namely, Akhtar

Ali & Niaz Ali, were already present there. They
stopped the complainant party and fired upon his
brother Ibrahim with their weapons which resulted
into his death on the spot. The occurrence was
witnessed by the complainant besides his father.
Motive for the offence was given as previous blood
feud enmity. Hence, the FIR ibid was registered
against the accused-respondents for the Qatl-e-Amd
of deceased Ibrahim.

3. After full dressed trial, the accused-
respondents were acquitted by the learned trial
Court vide judgment impugned herein whereagainst
the appellant has filed the instant appeal.

4. We have given our anxious consideration to
the submissions made by the learned counsel for
the appellant and scrupulously perused the record
with his able assistance.

5. The prosecution case is based on the
testimony of PW5/complainant. It is worth to
mention here that complainant himself was a
seasoned police officer. As the only eyewitness was
the complainant/PWS, so this Court has to, first, see
that whether complainant was present at the time of

occurrence on the spot and second that how the

complainant was left alive by the accused-
respondents while he was also at their mercy. There
is a lot of contradictions between Murasila and
statement of PW5/complainant recorded before the
Court. On one hand, he categorically mentioned
that only he alongwith his deceased brother Ibrahim
were travelling on his motorcycle, whereas his
father was present on the spot when they reached
there. The visible departure and improvement by
the complainant was never sufficiently explained.
In his cross examination he admitted that:

“there is no difference in the
Murasila. and in my _ statement
recorded before the Court today. It is
correct that only I alongwith my
deceased brother were coming to
Kheshgi Payan on motorcycle as
recorded in my examination in
chief...the witness volunteered that
my father was busy in buying house
items in the shop of Gulfam at the

spot of occurrence...”

His statement shows that he was very much
aware of the fact that there is noticeable difference
between the Murasila and his statement as PWS. As
mentioned above, the complainant was serving the

police department as an Investigation Officer and

he knows the nitty-gritty of investigation and
criminal law and its procedure, but he could not
repair the damage done by his statement. The
improvement has not been explained with plausible
reasons. In criminal law, the FIR is generally
considered as document of spontaneous account of
the occurrence. In the instant case the complainant
had already made serious departure from his earlier
account of the occurrence because in the FIR, the
complainant reported that he alongwith his brother
and father were going at motorcycle and it does not
appeal to a prudent mind that when three persons
were riding on motorcycle, how the witnesses
remained alive. The relevant para of Murasila is
reproduced as under:
Sige eS! demas 5 alt else se Une

While relevant para of his Court’s statement

is “on 28.10.2013 I alongwith my brother Ibrahim

now deceased were going on red colour motorcycle

100 CC.....the occurrence was witnessed by me and

my father Muhammad Akram. I shifted my brother

in vehicle to DHO, Hospital.”

6. Furthermore, the presence of the complainant

on the spot of occurrence was also disputed because
according to Ex:DW1/1, the Daily Diary of Police
Station, Kotwali, Peshawar, being written by
complainant himself. Relevant entry is reproduced
below:

which caused serious damage to the prosecution’s
case.
7. It is also astonishing that, though the
complainant himself was a seasoned police officer,
but, he has not mentioned in the Murasila the kind
of weapon used by the accused-respondents for
firing upon his deceased brother despite close
proximity with them at the time of occurrence as
shown in site plan which was also prepared on the
pointation of complainant himself. Although both
the parties were having blood feud enmity but
surprisingly the accused-respondents _ only
contended to kill the brother of complainant and
spare the complainant and his father being at their
mercy because in our society a person holding any

sway in Government is eliminated by his enemies

first. Guidance could be sought from case law

reported 2017 SCMR 596 wherein it has been held
by the apex Court---

“Unnatural conduct of the accused
party and deliberately leaving the
complainant and eyewitness alive---
According to the FIR, all the accused
persons encircled the complainant, the
prosecution witnesses and the two
deceased thus, the apparent object was
that none should escape alive---
Complainant being father of the two
deceased and the head of the family
was supposed to be the prime target,
but no threats were extended to them,
such unbelievable courtesy extended by
the accused persons to the complainant
and prosecution witnesses, knowing
well that they would depose against
them created serious doubts in the
prosecution case’.

Such behavior on the part of the accused

persons ran counter to natural human conduct
which is well explained in the provisions of Article
129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984.

8. Although, father of the complainant was
mentioned as eyewitness in the Murasila but he was
not produced as witness by the prosecution without
any plausible reason, so Article 129(g) of Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order 1984 is applicable here. Reliance
could be also placed on 2017 SCMR 486 wherein it
has been held that;

“In this way, the best evidence,

independent _in nature, was withheld

from the court for obvious reasons. This

fact by itself is sufficient to discard the

evidence.....”.

9. Furthermore, as disclosed by the
complainant, the vehicle in which the deceased was
shifted to hospital was neither produced, nor
statement of the driver was recorded by the IO of
the case despite the fact that he was also an
important witness in the instant case for
substantiating the place of occurrence. It has time
and again held by the apex court that the person
who shifts the deceased to the hospital is much
more important witness to be examined. For
Guidance 2018 SCMR 153 is referred to.

As stated above the witnesses produced by the
prosecution were not telling the truth rather trying
to suppress the actual truth before the court,
therefore, the testimony cannot be relied upon. It
has been held in recent judgment of the apex Court
reported in PLJ 2019 SC (Criminal Cases) 265,
authored by Hon’ble the Chief Justice of Pakistan,

which reads as under:-

“A witness who lied about any material fact
must be disbelieved as to all facts-- ‘Falsus
in uno, falsus in omnibus’ is a Latin phrase
meaning “false in one thing, false in
everything”...The rule held that a witness
who lied about any material fact must be
disbelieved as to all facts because of the
reason that the “presumption that the witness
will declare the truth ceases as soon as it
manifestly appears that he is capable of
perjury” and that “Faith in a witness’s
testimony cannot be partial or factional... The

rule was first held not o apply to cases in
Pakistan in case of Ghulam Muhammad and
others Vs Crown (PLD 1951 Lahore 66) and
judgment was authored by Muhammad
Munir, CJ--This view stems from notion that
once a witness is found to have lied about a
material aspect of a case, it cannot then be
safely assumed that said witness will declare
truth about any other aspect of case---Maxim
has not been accepted by superior Courts in
Pakistan--Supreme Court of Pakistan has
dealt with rule in different cases till date--Job
of a judge was to discover truth earlier rule
falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus is
inapplicable in this country practically
encourages commission of perjury which is a
serious offence in this country---A Court of
law cannot permit something which law
expressly forbids---With all due respect, we
feel that such an approach, which involves
extraneous and practical considerations, is
arbitrary besides, being subjective and same
can have drastic consequences for rule of law
and dispensation of justice in criminal
matters---when a witness has been found
false with regard to implication of one
accused about whose participation he had
deposed on oath credibility of such witness
regarding involvement of other accused in
same occurrence would be irretrievably
shaken---A-fore-discussed main rule shall
suffer serious change if an when it is
examined in light of Islamic Principles---The
Holy Qur’an deals with matter---It can be
seen that giving testimony its due importance
and weight is an obligatory duty and those
who stands firm in their testimonies are
among people of righteousness and faith---
According to corpus of traditions of Holy
Prophet (PBUH), false testimony is one of
greatest sins---Offence of Qazf; which has
been defined---It can be seen that Holy
Qur’an puts a great emphasis upon need to
meet requisite standard of evidence, so much
so, that for a person leveling allegation of
Zina but not meeting given standard, it not
only provides for a penal punishment, but
also for withdrawal of such a person’s civic
right to give evidence in all matters of his
life---A court of law cannot grant a license to
a witness to till lies or to mix truth with
falsehood and then take it upon itself to sift
grain from chaff when law of land makes
perjury are testifying falsely a culpable
offence--- A Court also has no jurisdiction to
lay down a principle of law when even
Parliament is expressly forbidden by
Constitution for enacting such a principle as

law---Inapplicability of this rule in Pakistan
was introduced by Chief Justice Muhammad
Munir in the year, 1951, when Article 227 of
Constitution was not in field but after
introduction of said constitutional prohibition
enunciation of law by his lordship in this
field, like infamous doctrine of necessity
introduced by his lordship in constitutional
field, may not hold its ground now--- A
judicial system which permits deliberate
falsehood is doomed to fail and a society
which tolerates it is destined to self-destruct--
--Truth is foundation of justice and justice is
core and bedrock of a civilized society and,
thus, any compromise on truth amounts to a
compromise on a society’s future as a just,
fare and civilized society---Our judicial
system has suffered a lot as a consequence of
above mentioned permissible deviation from
truth and it is about time that such a colossal
wrong may be rectified in all earnestness---
Therefore, in light of discussion made above,
we declare that rule falsus in uno, falsus in
omnibus shall henceforth be an integral part
of our jurisprudence in criminal cases and
same shall be given effect to, followed and
applied by all courts in country in its letter
and spirit---It is also directed that a witness
found by a court to have resorted to a
deliberate falsehood on a material aspect
shall, without any latitude, invariably be
proceeded against for committing perjury”.

10. So in the light of above mentioned judgment
of the apex Court, the testimony of complainant
could not be relied upon and uncalled-for. It is
settled principle of criminal justice that ocular
evidence in order to carry conviction on capital
charge must come from unimpeachable source or
must be supported by some strong circumstances.

11. The learned Trial Court has fully appreciated
the case evidence both, ocular and circumstantial,

in its true perspective and, while keeping in view,

contradictions in the statements of the PWs on
certain material points including non presence of
the complainant at the place of occurrence, has
rightly drawn conclusion qua acquittal of the
respondents from the charge leveled against them.
On re-appraisal of case evidence, there is no room
for this Court to interfere in the impugned

judgment.

12. In addition, before us is an appeal against
acquittal where standard for appreciation of
evidence is different than the one in appeal against
conviction, as once an accused is acquitted, then he
earns double presumption of his innocence, which
cannot be taken away from him unless it is shown
that the judgment of acquittal is based on surmises

or presumptions, which is not the case here.

13. In view of the above discussion, this appeal,

being bereft of any merit, is hereby dismissed in

limine.
