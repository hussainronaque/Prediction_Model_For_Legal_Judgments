2. The appellant, namely, Muhammad Sarwar along with Muhammad
Zeshan Sarwar alias Shana (co-accused since acquitted) and Muhammad
Arslan Sarwar alias Fana (co-accused since acquitted) was tried in case FIR.
No. 177 dated 12.02.2017 registered at Police Station Ghalib Market
District Lahore in respect of offences under Sections 302/34 of PPC. After
conclusion of the trial, the learned trial Court vide its judgment dated
11.07.2019 has convicted and sentenced Muhammad Sarwar appellant as
under: -

Under Section 302(b) PPC to ‘Death as tazir’ for committing

Qatl-i-Amd of Ahsan Aslam (deceased). He was also ordered

to pay Rs.300,000/- (Rupees three hundred thousand only) to

the legal heirs of Ahsan Aslam deceased as compensation

under Section 544-A of Cr.P.C, recoverable as arrears of

land revenue, and in default thereof to undergo simple
imprisonment for six months.

The learned trial Court however, vide the aforementioned judgment
has acquitted Muhammad Zeshan Sarwar alias Shana (co-accused) and
Muhammad Arslan Sarwar alias Fana (co-accused) by extending them the
benefit of doubt.

3. Brief facts of the case as given by the complainant Asad Aslam (PW-
8) in the complainant (Exh.PA) on the basis of which formal FIR (Exh.PA/2),
was chalked out, are that he (complainant) was resident of House No. 50,
Nasir Colony, Lahore. On 12.02.2017 at 12:30 p.m., (noon), he (complainant)
along with his elder brother, namely, Ahsan Aslam (deceased) was playing
cricket in Saint Marry Dongi Ground, where, Muhammad Sarwar (appellant)
armed with pistol, his (complainant’s) two sons, namely, Arslan alias Mana
(co-accused since acquitted) armed with ‘danda’, Zeshan alias Shana (co-
accused since acquitted) armed with ‘danda’ along with an unknown accused.
person entered. Zeshan (co-accused since acquitted) raised ‘lalkara’ that
Ahsan (deceased) be killed and be not let alive upon which all the accused
persons attacked & started beating the brother of the complainant. Ahsan
(deceased) called him (complainant) to save him, whereupon, he
(complainant) rushed towards his brother. In the meanwhile, Muhammad
Sarwar (appellant) made fire shot with his pistol which landed on the right
side of abdomen of Ahsan (deceased) who fell down while smeared in the

blood. Thereafter, Muhammad Sarwar (appellant) made two consecutive fire
3

Crl. Appeal No. 50403 of 2019 &
Murder Reference No. 275 of 2019.

shots which did not hit Ahsan (deceased) due to his fallen condition. The
occurrence was witnessed by Hakeem Khan (given up PW), Haji Tahir (given
up PW) and Sheraz Butt (PW-9). Ahsan (deceased) was shifted to the
Services Hospital, Lahore, in injured condition.

Motive behind the occurrence was that few days prior to the
occurrence, a quarrel took place between Ahsan (deceased) and Sarwar
(appellant) along with his two sons, namely, Arslan (co-accused since
acquitted) and Zeshan (co-accused since acquitted) on account of a fight of
the children of the locality and due to this grudge, the accused persons made
firing at the brother of the complainant.

Initially FIR was lodged for offences under Sections 324/34 of PPC
however, after the death of Ahsan (deceased) on 15.02.2017, offence under
Section 302 of PPC was added in this case vide zimni No. 03.

4. Muhammad Sarwar appellant was arrested on 08.03.2017 by Razaqat
Ali, Sub Inspector/I.O (PW-13) who on 19.03.2017 made disclosure and led
to the recovery of pistol (P-7) along with four live bullets P-8/1-4 vide
recovery memo (Exh.PH). After completion of investigation, the challan was
prepared and submitted before the learned trial Court. The learned trial Court,
after observing legal formalities, as provided under the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898 framed charge against Muhammad Sarwar appellant along
with Muhammad Zeshan Sarwar alias Shana (co-accused since acquitted) &
Muhammad Arslan Sarwar alias Fana (co-accused since acquitted) on
04.07.2017, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

5. In order to prove its case, the prosecution produced thirteen witnesses
during the trial and also produced documentary evidence in the shape of
(Exh.PA to Exh.PW).

The statements of the appellant and Muhammad Zeshan Sarwar alias
Shana (co-accused since acquitted) & Muhammad Arslan Sarwar alias Fana
(co-accused since acquitted) were recorded under Section 342 of Cr.P.C.
The appellant refuted the allegations levelled against him and professed his
innocence. The appellant neither opted to make his statement on oath as
envisaged under Section 340 (2) Cr.P.C., nor produced any evidence in his

defence.

Crl. Appeal No. 56707 of 2019

Crl. Appeal No. 50403 of 2019 &
Murder Reference No. 275 of 2019.

The learned trial Court vide its judgment dated 11.07.2019 found the
appellant guilty, convicted and sentenced him as mentioned and detailed
above however, acquitted Muhammad Zeshan Sarwar alias Shana (co-
accused) and Muhammad Arslan Sarwar alias Fana (co-accused) while
extending them the benefit of doubt.

6. It is contended by learned counsel for the appellant that the appellant
is absolutely innocent and he has falsely been implicated in this case by the
complainant being in league with the police; that in fact, the occurrence was
unseen; that the prosecution eye witnesses are chance witnesses and they
could not establish any reason of their presence at the spot at the relevant
time; that Razaqat Ali, Sub Inspector (PW-13), has admitted that two
gardeners were present at the spot at the relevant time who had stated that
they had witnessed the occurrence but the said gardeners were not produced
in the witness box and as such, the prosecution has withheld the best evidence
therefore, an adverse inference can be drawn under Article 129(g) of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 against the prosecution; that there is glaring
conflict between the ocular account and the medical evidence of the
prosecution because according to the ocular account, Ahsan (deceased) was
firstly beaten by the accused party and thereafter, one fire shot was made by
Muhammad Sarwar (appellant) which landed on the right side of the
abdomen of Ahsan (deceased) but according to the medical evidence, there
was no blunt injury on the body of the deceased, whereas, there were two
firearm entry wounds on his body and as such, the ocular account is
contradicted by the medical evidence; that it is evident from the evidence of
the prosecution witnesses that investigation in this case was conducted after
two (02) days of the occurrence i.e.,on 14.02.2017 which further created dent
in the prosecution case; that safe custody of parcel of pistol, allegedly
recovered on pointing out of the appellant, could not be established by the
prosecution in this case as Anwar-ul-Haq H.C/Moharrar (PW-4) has not
uttered a single word regarding handing over of the abovementioned parcel
to him or its delivery to any prosecution witness for its onward transmission
to the office of PFSA; that motive was also not proved in this case through

any reliable evidence; that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove its
5

Crl. Appeal No. 50403 of 2019 &
Murder Reference No. 275 of 2019.

case against the appellant beyond the shadow of doubt. It is therefore, prayed
that the appeal filed by Muhammad Sarwar (appellant) may be allowed and
the appellant may be acquitted of the charge by extending him the benefit of
doubt.

7. On the other hand, it is contended by the learned Deputy Prosecutor
General for the State assisted by learned counsel for the complainant that the
prosecution has proved its case against the appellant beyond the shadow of
doubt; that the occurrence took place in the broad day light and as such, there
was no chance of any mis-identification of the appellant during the
occurrence; that the prosecution witnesses were cross-examined at length but
their evidence could not be shaken and their evidence has substantially been
supported by the medical evidence; that prosecution case against the
appellant is further corroborated by the recovery of pistol (P-7) on pointing
out of the appellant and positive report of PFSA (Exh.PW); that motive of
the prosecution was also proved in this case through reliable evidence of the
prosecution witnesses; that there is no substance in the appeal filed by the
appellant therefore, his appeal may be dismissed, Murder Reference be
answered in the positive and the sentence of death awarded to the appellant
by the learned trial Court may be upheld & maintained.

Insofar as Crl. Appeal No. 50403 of 2019 filed by Asad Aslam
complainant against the acquittal of Muhammad Zeshan Sarwar alias Shana
(co-accused) and Muhammad Arslan Sarwar alias Fana (co-accused) is
concerned, learned counsel for the complainant submits that both the
aforementioned co-accused were not only present at the spot but they also
shared common intention with the principal accused; that they along with
other accused gave beating to Ahsan (deceased) at the time of occurrence and
as such, both the aforementioned acquitted accused actively participated
during the occurrence and they have wrongly been acquitted from the
charges. It is therefore, prayed that while allowing the appeal of the
complainant, both the accused (respondent Nos. 2 & 3) may also be convicted
& sentenced, in accordance with the law.

8. Arguments heard. Record perused.

Crl. Appeal No. 56707 of 2019

Murder Reference No. 275 of 2019.

9. Prosecution story as set forth in the complainant (Exh.PA) on the basis
of which formal FIR (Exh.PA/2) was chalked out, has already been
reproduced in para No.3 of this judgment therefore, there is no need to repeat
the same.

10. The occurrence in this case took place on 12.02.2017 at 12:30 p.m.,
(noon). The matter was reported to the police and the FIR (Exh.PA/2) was
also lodged on the same day i.e. on 12.02.2017 at 01:30 p.m., i.e., within a
period of 01 hour from the occurrence. The distance between the police
station and the place of occurrence was 1-kilometer. Even Ahsan Aslam
(deceased) who initially sustained injuries during the occurrence and later on,
died, was also medically examined on the same day i.e., on 12.02.2017 at
12:47 p.m., i.e., within a period of 17 minutes from the occurrence. Keeping
in view the time of occurrence, the place of occurrence, its distance from the
police station and the time of medical examination of the injured (later on
deceased), we are of the view that there was no deliberate or conscious delay
in reporting the matter to the police and the FIR was promptly lodged.

11. The ocular account of the prosecution was furnished by Asad Aslam
complainant (PW-8) and Sheraz Butt (PW-9). The occurrence in this case
took place in the cricket ground of Saint Marry Dongi Ground, Gulberg
Lahore. Asad Aslam complainant (PW-8) is real brother of Ahsan Aslam
(deceased). He is also resident of Gulberg, Lahore. Likewise, Sheraz Butt
(PW-9) is also resident of Lahore though he is resident of Umar Park
Baghbanpura, Lahore but both the abovementioned eye witnesses have
plausibly explained the reason of their presence at the spot at the relevant
time by stating that they were playing cricket along with Ahsan Aslam
(deceased) in the abovementioned cricket ground at the time of occurrence.
The occurrence in this case took place in the broad day light i.e., at 12:30
noon., and as such, there was no chance of any mis-identification of the
appellant during the occurrence. Both the abovementioned eye witnesses
were cross-examined at length but their evidence could not be shaken. They
corroborated each other on all material aspects of the case. Their evidence is

confidence inspiring & trustworthy. Although it is argued by learned counsel
7

Crl. Appeal No. 56707 of 2019

Crl. Appeal No. 50403 of 2019 &
Murder Reference No. 275 of 2019.

for the appellant that according to the statement of Razaqat Ali, Sub Inspector
(PW-13) gardeners of the ground, were present at the spot at the relevant time
and they were the most natural witnesses of the occurrence but the
prosecution has withheld their evidence and as such, an adverse inference
under Article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, may be drawn
against the prosecution but it is noteworthy that it is the quality and not the
quantity of evidence which weighs with the Courts regarding the decision of
a criminal case therefore, non-production of the aforementioned gardeners of
the ground in the witness box is not fatal to the prosecution case. Even
otherwise, it is by now well settled that the people/witnesses not related to
the deceased/complainant party do not appear in the witness box to avoid
enmity with the accused party and their non-appearance in the witness box is
not fatal to the prosecution case, as observed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court

of Pakistan in the cases reported as ‘Zakir Hussain Vs The State’ (2008

SCMR 222) & ‘Abdul Hag and another Vs The State’ (2015 SCMR 1326)

therefore, abovementioned argument of learned counsel for the appellant
carries no weight.

12. Recovery memo of the blood stained earth dated 12.02.2017 (Exh.PD),
recovery memo of the empties, recovered from the spot dated 12.02.2017
(Exh.PE), recovery memo of last worn/blood stained clothes of the deceased
dated 12.02.2017 (Exh.PF), all these documents show that investigation of
this case started on 12.02.2017 and as such, there is no force in the argument
of learned counsel for the appellant that investigation in this case started on
14.02.2017.

13. Medical evidence of the prosecution was furnished by Dr. Ayad
Akhtar (PW-5), Dr. Muhammad Owais Qureshi (PW-10) & Dr. Zulqarnain
Haider (PW-11). Dr. Ayad Akhtar (PW-5) initially medically examined
Ahsan (deceased), in injured condition, on 12.02.2017 at 12:47 p.m., ie.,
within a period of 17 minutes from the occurrence. He noted two firearm
injuries on the body of Ahsan (deceased). He further noted that the
abovementioned injuries were caused by firearm weapon. Although it is

argued by learned counsel for the appellant that according to the prosecution
8

Crl. Appeal No. 56707 of 2019

Crl. Appeal No. 50403 of 2019 &
Murder Reference No. 275 of 2019.

case, accused party firstly gave beating to Ahsan (deceased) and thereafter,
Muhammad Sarwar (appellant) made fire shots out of which only one fire
shot landed on the right side of the abdomen of Ahsan (deceased), whereas,
the Medical Officer did not note any blunt weapon injury on the body of the
deceased and two firearm injuries were noted on his body which contradicts
the prosecution case but it is noteworthy that the allegation of giving beating
to the deceased with the help of clubs was levelled against Muhammad
Zeshan Sarwar alias Shana & Muhammad Arslan Sarwar alias Fana (co-
accused) who have already been acquitted by the learned trial Court, whereas,
the prosecution case against the appellant of making fire shot which landed
on the right side of the abdomen of Ahsan (deceased) has substantially been
supported by the medical evidence and there is no conflict between the ocular
account and the medical evidence of the prosecution to the extent said role
played by the appellant during the occurrence. We have further noted that in
the contents of the FIR, as well as, in their statements before the learned trial
Court, prosecution eye witnesses stated that after sustaining firearm injury on
the right side of the abdomen, Ahsan (deceased) fell on the ground in injured
condition and thereafter, the appellant made two more fire shots on the
deceased however, the same did not hit him. Under the circumstances, there
was every possibility that one out of the two additional fire shots made by the
appellant, had hit the deceased but the same could not be noticed by the
prosecution eye witnesses due to the falling of the deceased on the ground,
as well as, on account of sensation & panic created due to the firing of the
appellant. It is by now well settled that an eye witness cannot give the photo
picture of each and every injury sustained by the deceased due to the panic
& sensation developed at the time of occurrence due to the firing of the
accused. Reliance in this respect may be placed on the cases of ‘Ellahi
Bakhsh Vs Rab Nawaz and another’ (2002 SCMR 1842) & ‘Abdur Rauf Vs
the State and another’ (2003 SCMR 522). We are therefore, of the view that

there is no serious conflict between ocular account and medical evidence and
the medical evidence has substantially supported the ocular account of the

prosecution.

Crl. Appeal No. 50403 of 2019 &
Murder Reference No. 275 of 2019.

14. Insofar as the recovery of pistol (P-7) on pointing out of the appellant
and positive report of PFSA (Exh.PW) is concerned, we have noted that
Anwar-ul-Haq HC (PW-4), who was Moharrar of Malkhana of the police
station, has not uttered a single word that any parcel of pistol was handed
over to him and thereafter, he kept the same in safe custody at the Malkhaana
and finally handed over the said parcel to any prosecution witness for its
onward transmission to the office of PFSA. We are therefore, of the view that
safe cutody of the parcel of pistol (P-7), allegedly recovered on pointing out
of the appellant, has not been proved in this case therefore, recovery of pistol
(P-7) and positive report of PFSA (Exh.PW) are of no avail to the
prosecution.

15. According to the prosecution case, motive behind the occurrence was
that few days prior to the occurrence, a quarrel took place between Ahsan
(deceased) and the accused party on account of fight of children. No specific
date, time and place of the said quarrel has been mentioned by any of the
prosecution witness. None of the prosecution witnesses stated that they were
present at the time of abovementioned quarrel. A vague and general motive
was alleged by the prosecution which has not been proved in this case.

16. We have disbelieved the prosecution evidence qua the recovery of
pistol (P-7) on pointing out of the appellant & motive of the occurrence due
to the reasons mentioned in para Nos. 14 & 15 above, however, if the
prosecution evidence qua the recovery of pistol (P-7) and motive is excluded
from consideration, even then sufficient incriminating evidence is available
on the record to prove the prosecution case against the appellant. As
discussed earlier, the prosecution case has been proved against the appellant
through the reliable and confidence inspiring evidence of eye-witnesses,
namely, Asad Aslam complainant (PW-8) & Sheraz Butt (PW-9). They stood
the test of lengthy cross-examination but their evidence could not be shaken
regarding the role played by the appellant during the occurrence. They
corroborated each other on all material aspects of the case. The ocular
account of the prosecution as given by Asad Aslam complainant (PW-8) &
Sheraz Butt (PW-9) about the role of the appellant is substantially supported
by the medical evidence furnished by Dr. Ayad Akhtar (PW-5), Dr.
10

Crl. Appeal No. 56707 of 2019

Crl. Appeal No. 50403 of 2019 &
Murder Reference No. 275 of 2019.

Muhammad Owais Qureshi (PW-10), Dr. Zulqarnain Haider (PW-11), MLC
of Ahsan (deceased) in injured condition (Exh.PC), as well as, postmortem
report of Ahsan (deceased) (Exh.PJ) & pictorial diagrams (Exh.PJ/1 &
Exh.PJ/2). The time of occurrence, the kind of weapon used, the nature and
seat of injuries inflicted by the appellant to Ahsan (deceased), all these facts
as stated by the abovementioned eye-witnesses were substantially supported
by the aforementioned medical evidence. We are therefore, of the view that
the prosecution has proved its case against the appellant beyond the shadow
of any doubt.

17. Now coming to the quantum of sentence, we have noted some
mitigating circumstances in favour of the appellant. Firstly recovery of pistol
(P-7) on pointing out of the appellant has been disbelieved by us due to the
reasons mentioned in paragraph No. 14 above, Secondly, prosecution
evidence qua motive has been disbelieved by us due to the reasons mentioned
in paragraph No. 15 of this judgment. Under the circumstances, the death
sentence awarded to the appellant is quite harsh and the sentence of
imprisonment for life shall meet the ends of justice.

18. While treating it a case of mitigation, the conviction of Muhammad
Sarwawr appellant under Section 302(b), PPC awarded by the learned trial
Court is maintained but his sentence is altered from death to imprisonment
for life. The compensation awarded by the learned trial Court against the
appellant and sentence in default thereof are maintained and upheld. The
benefit of Section 382-B of Cr.P.C. is extended in favour of the appellant.
19. Consequently, with the above said modification in the sentence of
Muhammad Sarwar appellant, Criminal Appeal No. 56707 of 2019 filed by
the appellant is hereby dismissed. Murder Reference (M.R. No. 275 of
2019) is answered in the negative and death sentence of Muhammad Sarwar
appellant is not confirmed.

20. Insofar as Crl. Appeal No. 50403 of 2019, filed by Asad Aslam
complainant against the acquittal of Muhammad Zeshan Sarwar alias Shana
and Muhammad Arslan Sarwar alias Fana is concerned, it is noteworthy that
the allegation of giving beating to Ahsan (deceased) by the aforementioned
accused has not been supported by the medical evidence as the Medical

Officers did not note any blunt injury on the body of the deceased therefore,
11

Crl. Appeal No. 56707 of 2019

Crl. Appeal No. 50403 of 2019 &
Murder Reference No. 275 of 2019.

mere oral assertion of the complainant party is not sufficient to convict the
said accused. Moreover, merely presence of the aforementioned respondents
at the place of occurrence does not mean their participation in the alleged
occurrence and prosecution has brought on record no evidence regarding
sharing of the common intention by the aforementioned acquitted
accused/respondent Nos. 2 & 3. The observations of the learned trial Court
regarding acquittal of the aforementioned respondents are based on sound
reasons which do not call for any interference by this Court. There is no
substance in the appeal filed by the complainant (Cr1. Appeal No. 50403 of
2019) against the acquittal of the said respondents therefore, the same is

hereby dismissed.
