ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN_ KHAN, _J:-Petitioner Almas Ullah Dad,
seeks pre-arrest bail in case FIR No.586 dated 17.07.2021,
registered under sections 452/336/148/149 PPC, in Police Station
SI Abdul Hameed Shaheed Shabqadar, District Charsadda. The
petitioner was granted ad-interim pre-arrest bail by this court vide
order dated 24.09.2021.

2. Having heard the arguments of learned counsel for the
parties, it appears from record that for the relief of extra ordinary
concession of pre-arrest bail, the petitioner initially approached
the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Shabaqar, wherein he was
granted ad-interim pre-arrest bail vide order dated 19.07.2021,
however, on the date of final hearing of the application on

03.09.2021, the petitioner did not turn up, resultantly, his
application for pre-arrest bail was dismissed on merits by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge Shabqadar vide order dated
03.09.2021, hence, the petitioner has filed the instant application.
3. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in a recent order/judgment
dated 29.07.2021, passed in Crl. P. No.1075-L/2020, has
exhaustively dealt with the procedure of deciding pre-arrest bail
application in case the accused after getting ad interim pre-arrest
bail, fails to appear before the court in light of the added section
498-A Cr.P.C.,. For the sake of convenience and guidance,

relevant parts of the order are reproduced below:-

“After the insertion of section 498-A of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898 (“CrPC”) if the accused, seeking pre-arrest
bail, is not present before the Court, the Court is not
authorized to grant bail to such an accused and therefore, the
petition is liable to be dismissed in light of the said statutory
provision. For convenience, section 498-A CrPC is
reproduced hereunder:-

“498-A. No bail to be granted to a person not
in custody, in court or against whom no case is
registered, etc:- Nothing in section 497 or
section 498 shall be deemed to require or
authorize a court to release on bail, or to direct to
be admitted to bail, any person who is not in
custody or is not present in court or against
whom no case stands registered for the time
being an order for the release of a person on bail,
or a direction that a person be admitted to bail,
shall be effective only in respect of the case that
so stands registered against him and is specified
in the order or direction.
Section 498-A CrPC creates a statutory fetter or a statutory

pre-condition requiring the presence of the petitioner in
person in Court for the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court
for granting pre-arrest bail. In case the petitioner (accused) is
not personally present in Court, the Court is not authorized to
grant him bail and the petition is to be dismissed for his lack
of presence in Court. However, in case some explanation is
furnished for his non-appearance, the Court may, if it finds

that explanation to be satisfactory, exempt his presence for
that day and adjourn the hearing of the petition for a short
period. The Court cannot, in the absence of the personal
appearance of the petitioner, travel further into the case and
examine the merits of the case. In fact the examination of the
merits of the case in absence of the accused totally defeats
the intent and purpose of the aforementioned statutory
provision. This is because once the Court proceeds to
examine the merits of the case, then the court has to opion to
either dismiss or allow the bail petition while under section
498-A CRPC the Court is not authorized to admit the accused
to bail in his absence.

We are cognizant of the fact that before the addition
of section 498-A in the CrPC, the view of the High Courts
was that once a petition for pre-arrest bail is admitted for
hearing and notice is given to State, it has to be decided on
merits notwithstanding the absence of the petitioner on the
date fixed for hearing the petition. However, after the
addition of section 498-A in the CrPC, there are divergent
views of the High Courts, on this point: one set of judgments
still retain to the said view, while the other set of cases hold
the view that the petition for pre-arrest bail is to be dismissed
if the petitioner is not present in court on the date fixed for
hearing the petition and it is not be decided on merits in his

absence, unless the Court exempts his presence. We approve

the judgments of the High Courts noted above, which
have considered the change in the legal position after
addition of Section 498-A in the CrPC and disapprove
those that still retain the earlier view as they have not

taken account of the true import and meaning of section
498-A CrPC. (emphasis supplied).

It is also clarified that in case the petition is
dismissed for non-appearance of the accused in a pre-arrest
bail matter under Section 498-A CrPC, the petitioner can file
a fresh bail petition before the same court provided that he
furnishes sufficient explanation for his non-appearance in the
earlier bail petition and the Court is satisfied with his said
explanation. But if he fails to furnish any satisfactory
explanation, his second bail petition is liable to be dismissed

on account of his conduct of misusing the process of Court
disentitling him to the grant of discretionary relief of pre-
arrest bail. (Mukhtar Ahmad Vs State) 2016 SCMR 2064.

It is also clarified that ad interim bail granted in a
pre-arrest application on the first hearing is to simply ensure
that the petitioner is present on all the subsequent dates of
hearing in the pre-arrest bail matter. Petitioner’s presence is,
therefore, required throughout the proceedings of the pre-
arrest bail petition and the fact that he appeared on the first
date when ad-interim bail was granted does not in any
manner lessen the rigours of Section 498-A CrPC or absolve
the responsibility of the accused from appearing in person

before the Court.”

4. This court has noted that tendency of non-appearance of
accused, after getting ad-interim pre-arrest bail, particularly, on
the date of final hearing of the application, is increasing day by
day. The accused probably sensing dismissal of applications
avoid appearance before the learned lower Courts or deliberately
make their escape good and thereafter surrendered themselves
before this court for the same relief. In the judgment (supra), the
Hon’ble Supreme Court has discussed the procedure to be
adopted by the courts in case the accused remains absent from the
court in pre-arrest bail application.

5. In this particular case, in view of the judgment (supra) of
the Hon’ble Supreme Court, I remit the instant application to the
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Shabqadar for treating the
same a fresh application and decide the same strictly in light of
the guidelines given by the Hon’ble apex court. The petitioner
shall furnish reasonable ground qua his absence on the day of
decision of his earlier BBA application. Parties shall appear

before the learned ASJ Shabqadar on 02.10.2021. In the
meantime, the petitioner shall remain on ad-interim pre-arrest on
the existing bail bonds.

6. The worthy Additional Registrar (judicial) of this Court
is directed to consign all pre-arrest bail applications pending
before this court in which pre-arrest bail applications of the
petitioners have been decided by the learned lower Courts in their
absentia and inform the petitioners and their learned counsel to
approach the learned Sessions Courts of the competent
jurisdiction by filing fresh applications in light of this order. He
shall also sent copy of this order to learned Sessions Judges of
the Province for further circulation among the criminal courts of
the District as well as a copy thereof to the Presidents of District
Bar Associations and the President of the Peshawar High Court
Bar Council for information and compliance.
