This being appeal filed against conviction and
sentence of life imprisonment, admit. Notice and record.
Cr.M 218-M/2017
ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- Through this application under
section 426 Cr.P.C, the applicant/appellant namely Haider
Ali son of Anwar Ali seeks suspension of the conviction &
sentence awarded to him by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge/Izafi Zila Qazi, Bahrain, Camp Court at Khwazakhela,
District Swat vide judgment dated 08.8.2017 passed in
Sessions Case No. 18/7 of 2014 and his release on bail till
the disposal of the main Criminal Appeal.

2. The applicant/appellant being involved in case
FIR No.602 dated 11.10.2014 registered under sections

302/109 PPC at Police Station Khurshid Khan Shaheed

District Swat was formally indicted on 08.12.2014 and
ultimately the trial culminated into the conviction of the
applicant/appellant and acquittal of the co-accused. On the
conviction of the appellant, he was awarded sentences by the

learned trial Court in the following terms:

i) “U/S 302 (b) PPC for the murder of deceased
Shujaat Ali Khan, the appellant was convicted
and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for life.

ij) He was further ordered to pay worth
Rs.300,000/- (rupees three hundred thousand) to
the legal heirs of deceased Shujaat Ali Khan
under section 544-A Cr.PC and in default
thereof, to suffer 06 months S.I.

However, the benefit of 382-B Cr.P.C was
extended to the convict/appellant.”

3. Learned counsel for the complainant in
connected Criminal Appeal No. 186-M/2017 & Criminal
Revision No.60-M/2017 while learned A.A.G in some other
matters, present before the Court were put on notice.

Learned counsel for the complainant submitted

wakalatnama.

4. Learned counsel for the applicant/appellant
submitted that the appellant is innocent and has falsely been
charged in the case; that the impugned judgment dated
08.08.2017 to the extent of conviction of the appellant is

wrong, illegal, void ab-initio, arbitrary, capricious, ultra

vires, whimsical, unjust, against the golden principles of

Shariah and against the materials available on the case
record, hence, the same is without lawful authority as no
reference of believable evidence against the convict has been
given in the impugned judgment and is liable to be set aside.
Further submitted that the learned trial Court has erred in
law while convicting the appellant for the murder of
deceased on very flimsy grounds without proper
appreciation of the entire evidence on the record. He relied
on the judgment of the apex Court rendered in 2016 SCMR

1325 “Soba Khan Vs. The State and another’.

5. Learned counsel for the complainant and
learned Additional Advocate General vehemently opposed
the submissions made by the learned counsel for the
applicant/appellant by contending that the appellant has
already lost his initial presumption of innocence as he has
been found guilty by the competent Court; that the grounds
agitated before this Court on behalf of the
applicant/appellant for suspension of the sentence would
amount to the appraisal of evidence and the prosecution
evidence could not be evaluated at this juncture as the same
would have a negative effect on the case of either party at

the time of hearing the main appeal. They relied on 2003

SCMR 911 and 2002 SCMR 1211.

Is

We have heard the valuable arguments

advanced by learned counsels for the parties as well as
learned Additional Advocate General and _ tentatively

perused the record.

7. It is pertinent to mention here that the grounds
agitated before us would amount to appraisal of evidence
which would prejudice the case of either side, so, we would
refrain to touch the merits of the case at this pre-mature
stage. The submission of learned counsel that the grounds
available to the accused under section 497 Cr.P.C can be
taken into consideration while the Court is seized of the

application under section 426 Cr.P.C is of paramount

importance.

8. Be that as it may, it is true that grounds under
section 497 Cr.P.C are to be kept in consideration while
dealing with the application under section 426 Cr.P.C for the
suspension of sentence but the difference between the
application for grant of bail u/s 497 Cr.P.C and suspension
of sentence u/s 426 Cr.P.C shall be kept into consideration
because at the time of grant of bail u/s 497 Cr.P.C, the
prosecution evidence is yet to be recorded by the trial Court,
so any findings made by the Court while granting bail under
the ibid provision would not be having bearing upon the trial

of the case. While exercising powers u/s 426 Cr.P.C, the

Courts are supposed to act with utmost care and caution for

the reasons that evidence has already been recorded and the
accused has been adjudged guilty by the competent Court of
law. In such eventuality, any finding in the circumstances of
the case beyond the mandate of section 426 Cr.P.C would
definitely have direct bearing on the merits of the main
appeal. In the present case, the applicant/appellant has
already been found guilty by the competent Court of law and
the grounds agitated by learned counsel would amount to
appraisal of evidence, which is not the mandate of section
426 Cr.P.C. Resultantly, this application, in the
circumstances of the case, being devoid of merits, is

dismissed.
