RASHEED AHMED SOOMRO J.,
 Applicant Ali Akbar Rustamani has applied for post-arrest
bail in Crime No.352 of 2016 registered at Police Station, Moro for offence under
section 23(i)-A, Sindh Arms Act, 2013, as his bail plea was declined by learned
Judge, ATC, Naushehro Feroze vide order dated 27.02.2017.
2.       Brief
facts of the prosecution case as disclosed in FIR are that applicant was
arrested in Crime No.348 of 2016 of Police Station Moro on 29.12.2016 and from
his possession one unlicensed Pistol 30 Bore with erased number was recovered.
After usual investigation challan was submitted against the applicant in the
present crime.
3.       Learned
counsel for the applicant mainly contended that applicant has been granted bail
 in the  main offence  as well  as in case of  police encounter.  He has  further
 contended  that the Pistol 30 Bore with erased number/description, has been
foisted upon the applicant by the police. He next contended that that
investigation is complete; challan has been submitted; applicant is no more
required for investigation; all the prosecution witnesses are police officials
and there is no question of tampering with the prosecution evidence.
4.       Learned
Assistant Prosecutor General appearing on behalf of the State argued that unlicensed
Pistol 30 Bore has been recovered from the possession of the applicant in
presence of the mashirs and alleged offence falls within the prohibitory clause
of section 497, Cr.P.C. He has opposed the bail application.
5.       We have heard learned
Counsel for the parties and scanned the material available on record, which
emanate that after encounter applicant was arrested from his Otaq situated at
Moro Town and recovered one Pistol 30 Bore without number. Contention of the learned counsel
for applicant that Pistol 30 Bore allegedly recovered from the applicant was a
licensed weapon which has been taken away by the police from his house and by
erasing its number, same has been foisted upon him at the instance of
complainant of crime No. 347 of 2016 of P.S.Moro has carried weighted and it is
yet to be determined at the time of trial. Applicant has already been granted
bail in main case as well as in a case of police encounter vide crime No. 348
of 2016 of P.S.Moro. Memo of arrest and recovery in all the three cases is one.
Applicant
is no more required for investigation purpose. All the prosecution witnesses
are police officials, hence there is no question of tampering with the
prosecution evidence. It is settled law that while hearing an application for
bail is not to keep in view the maximum sentence provided by the Statute but
the one which is likely to be entailed in the facts and circumstances of the
case. Applicant is behind bars since his arrest.
6.       Considering the facts and
circumstances referred supra, applicant has succeeded to make out a case for his enlargement
on post arrest bail on the ground of further inquiry, as envisaged under
section 497(2) Cr.P.C. Consequently, by our short order dated 20.04.2017,
applicant Ali Akbar was
admitted to post arrest bail on furnishing solvent surety in the sum Rs.1,00,000/-
(Rupees One lac) and P.R. bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of the
learned trial Court. These are the reasons of our short
order dated 20.04.2017.
7.       Nothing
herein shall affect the determination of the facts at the trial or influence
the trial Court in reaching its decision on the merits of the case and
observations made supra are tentative in
nature.          
          Bail
application stands disposed of in the above manner.
