QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- This = Criminal
Appeal under section 410 Cr.P.C by Abid
Khan, convict/appellant, is directed against
the judgment dated 26.06.2013 of learned
Sessions Judge, Charsadda, whereby, the
appellant was convicted under section 302 (b)
PPC and sentenced to life imprisonment and
also held liable to pay Rs:50,000/- as
compensation to the legal heirs of the

deceased and in default thereof to further six
months S.I, while extending him benefit of
382-B Cr.P.C.

2. The case/FIR was registered on the
report of Asghar Ali, complainant made to
Abdur Rashid Khan SHO Police Station,
Prang, at 14:25 hours on 26.03.2012, in the
casualty of Charsadda Hospital, where he had
brought the dead body of his father, Meraj-ud-
Din, and reported to the effect that the
appellant/accused, to whom Mst. Sidra
daughter of their cousin Israr-ud-Din was
married, had altercation with their father in the
morning in his presence as well as in the
presence of his brothers Arshad Ali and
Amjad Ali and other family members, in their
house, where the appellant/accused was also
residing and that at 14:05 hours the
appellant/accused again had altercation with
their father and went out of the house,
followed by their father, where he was
suddenly fired at by the appellant/accused,
with which his father was hit and died on the

spot, and the appellant/accused managed to
flee from the scene of occurrence. The
murasila signed by the complainant was
endorsed by his brother Arshad Ali who also
signed the same as a token of its verification.
On the basis of murasila, case/FIR was
registered in Police Station, Prang,
Charsadda, vide FIR No.280_ dated
26.03.2012 under sections 302/427 PPC.

3. The deceased, Meraj-ud-Din, was
subjected to Postmortem examination, and
the Medical Officer found one firearm entry
wound about 1/4 X 1/4 inch in diameter on
anterior-mid right shoulder with mild bleeding,
and corresponding exit wound about 1/3x 1/3
inch in diameter, with bleeding, on left side
chest below left axilla, in auxiliary line. The
Investigating Officer also prepared site plan
on the pointation of the complainant and
eyewitnesses, and could secure blood from
the place assigned to the deceased in the site
plan, and also recorded notes with regard to
the transformer installed in a Trolley having

received damage due to ffiring of the
appellant/accused, and also two bullet marks
on the wall 4/5 feet above the ground level.
The blood stained cotton and blood stained
garments of the deceased were sent to the
FSL, and after chemical analysis the chemical
examiner furnished positive report about blood
stained cotton and blood stained garments of
the deceased, except Shalwar (Trouser). The
appellant/accused remained at __ large,
therefore, was proceeded against under
sections 204 and 87/88 Cr.P.C; and after his
arrest on 29.05.2012; and completion of
investigation, complete challan was submitted
against him to the learned trial Court/Sessions
Judge, Charsadda. It may be added here that
during investigation, an application/complaint
was also received from SDO Pesco Rural Sub
Division, Charsadda, showing damage caused
to the Trolley transformer during clash/firing
between the parties on 26.03.2012.

4. On the receipt of complete challan in
the Court, learned Sessions Judge,

Charsadda, framed formal charge against the
appellant/accused under sections 302/427

PPC, to which the accused/appellant pleaded

not guilty and claimed trial. In order to prove

its case against the appellant/accused, the

prosecution produced the following nine PWs;

Ajmal Constable No.592 (PW-1),
escorted dead body of deceased Meraj-
ud-Din from casualty to the mortuary
and also handed over clothes of the
deceased to the 1.0 which were handed
over to him by the Medical Officer after
P.M examination;

Kiramat Shah DFC (PW-2), had
executed warrant of arrest under
section 204 Cr.P.C and_ also
proclamation under section 87 Cr.P.C;
Doctor Abdur Rashid (PW-3),
conducted autopsy on the dead body of
deceased Meraj-ud-Din and furnished
P.M report (EX.PM);

Asghar Ali (PW-4), the complainant;

Amjid Ali (PW-5), the eyewitness;
e Momin Khan HC No.110 (PW-6),
marginal witness to the pointation
memo (EX.PW6/1);

e Masood Khan ASI (PW-7), Investigating
Officer in the case;

e Alamgir Khan ASI (PW-8), registered
FIR (EX.PA) on the receipt of murasila;
and

e Abdur Rashid Khan_ Inspector/SHO
(PW-9), scribe of the murasila; and the
injury sheet (EX.PW9/1) as well as
inquest report (EX.PW9/2);

5. After prosecution closed its evidence,
the appellant/accused was examined under
section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein, he refuted
allegations of the prosecution levelled against
him but declined to be examined on oath or
produce defence’ evidence. Following
arguments on behalf of both the parties, the
learned trial Court/Sessions Judge,
Charsadda, rendered the impugned judgment
dated 26.06.2013, whereby the

appellant/accused was convicted and
sentenced, as mentioned hereinabove; hence
the instant appeal.

6. Arguments of learned counsel for the
convict/appellant and learned AAG heard. The
complainant, though present in the Court, yet
expressed his inability to engage counsel and
stated that he would be relying on the
arguments of learned AAG. Record perused.
7. No doubt, the appellant/accused was
charged as a single accused in the report of
the complainant lodged within 20 minutes of
the occurrence; but other facts of the case,
emerging from the evidence of _ the
prosecution, would make case of the
prosecution against the appellant/accused
replete with doubts.

8. One wonders when P.S Prang was
situated at a distance of about two furlong
from the spot, while the hospital was at a
distance of 2/3 kilometers, and the deceased
had died on the spot after receiving firearm
injury, also confirmed by the Medical Officer

(PW-3) declaring the death instantaneous,
then what prompted the complainant to take
the dead body to the hospital and lodge report
there, which was reduced into writing in the
shape of murasila by the SHO, Police Station,
Prang, who reportedly reached there on
receiving information about the occurrence;
thus casting shadow of doubt on _ the
authenticity of FIR.

9. The site plan shows the scene of
occurrence surrounded by residential houses
of other people, besides the joint house of the
complainant and the appellant/accused; but,
apart from this fact that none of the
inhabitants of the nearby houses were
examined as PWs in the case, the places
assigned to the deceased, the
appellant/accused and the eyewitnesses
raised so many questions not only about the
mode and manner of the occurrence but also
about presence of the complainant and so-
called eyewitnesses on the spot at the time of

occurrence, especially when neither the
complainant nor the so-called eyewitnesses
received a single firearm injury.

10. The occurrence, according to the FIR,
took place at 14:05 hours i.e. 02:05 PM and
the report was lodged in the casualty of
Charsadda Hospital at 14:25 hours i.e. 02:25
PM and thereafter the inquest report was
forwarded to the CMO for P.M examination;
but the Medical Officer (PW-3) not only
recorded 02:00 PM as the time on which the
dead body was brought to the hospital but
also confirmed in his statement before the
Court the time as about 02:00 PM on
26.03.2012 i.e. five minutes before the time of
occurrence mentioned in the FIR. It is note
worthy that there is overwriting on the time
mentioned regarding examination of the dead
body, which would create further doubt about
the exact time when the dead body was
brought to the hospital and was, then,
subjected to Postmortem examination. The
Postmortem report also led to another

anomaly, as the missile (bullet) was shown to
have travelled from the entry wound
downwards, indicating firing on the deceased
from upper level, which was inconsistent with
the site plan showing both the
appellant/accused and the deceased at the
same level.

11. A Trolley Transformer was shown
intervening between the appellant/accused
and the deceased, which also reportedly was
damaged during firing between the parties,
indicating cross firing between the parties
according to the application/complaint dated
26.03.2012 of the SDO Pesco Rural Sub
Division, Charsadda; but neither anyone from
Pesco appeared in support of _ the
application/complaint nor anything was
brought on the record by the prosecution to
show bullet marks either on one or both sides
of the Transformer so as to resolve the issue
of cross firing and also clear doubt about
cross firing, resulting in the death of the
deceased. Although charge of offence under

section 427 PPC was also framed; but in the
absence of evidence; and, apparently, charge
also not pressed by the prosecution against
the appellant/accused; the learned trial Court
did not record judgment/order of either
acquittal or conviction, hence amounting to
‘implied acquittal’ of the appellant/accused.
The prosecution, having not moved appeal
against such ‘implied acquittal’, seems to have
abandoned the charge’ against the
appellant/accused, thus bringing the important
pieces of evidence like the site plan and
application of the SDO Pesco under serious
doubt.

12. The learned trial Court/Sessions
Judge, Charsadda, while rendering the
impugned judgment thereby convicting the
appellant/accused under section 302 (b) PPC
and awarding him life imprisonment also
overlooked this vital aspect of the case that
except altercation between the
appellant/accused and the deceased in the
morning and again immediately before the

occurrence, no other motive was disclosed
which could lead to the commission of the
offence of gatl-i-amd of the deceased by the
appellant/accused, who were residing jointly in
the same house, and the deceased and the
so-called eyewitness were shown to have
followed the appellant/accused after he had
left the house. Needless to say that though
the murasila was signed by the brother of
complainant, namely, Arshad Ali, but he was
not produced and another brother of the
complainant Amjid Ali was produced as an
eyewitness (PW-5), while Arshad Ali was
abandoned by the prosecution.

13. The citing of Azam Jan and Sangeen
Shah as identifier of the dead body in the
inquest report as well as in the P.M report, but
not produced by the prosecution as PWs; and
the time of occurrence shown in the FIR,
when the complainant and the so-called
eyewitnesses were supposed to be busy with
their jobs/business, would also make their
presence on the spot at the time of

occurrence unlikely, and make _ their
depositions about their presence on the spot
at the time of occurrence and witnessing the
occurrence with their own eyes doubtful.

14. As such, there were so many doubts
and discrepancies in the case of prosecution,
which should have led to the acquittal of the
appellant/accused, instead of calling for his
conviction and award of life imprisonment to
him. Therefore, the appeal is accepted, and
the impugned judgment dated 26.06.2013
together with conviction of the
appellant/accused and sentences awarded to
him are set aside. The appellant is acquitted
of the charge leveled against him, and be set

free, forthwith, if not required in any other

case.
Announced.
