02. The convict has come up on appeal
against the conviction and sentences passed
by Mr. Muhammad Jamil, Additional Sessions
Judge-III/Judge, Model Criminal Trial Court,
Swabi per his judgment dated 17.07.2021,
whereas, Sawab Gul has preferred Criminal
Revision No.132-P/2021 for enhancement of
sentence. We propose to decide the appeal
and the revision through this judgment.

03. The facts of the prosecution case,
briefly stated, are that the complainant is the
tenant of one Muazzam Khan. On the relevant

day & time, he and his sons (Haroon &

seed

Siddique) & grandson Uzaima, were busy in
Zamindara work in the field. The appellant
and his sister’s son (grandson of the
complainant) came there and opened fire at
them with the intention to kill them. As a
result thereof, he, his sons Sadique, Haroon &
minor grandson Uzaima sustained firearm
injuries. The injured were removed to the
casualty of Swabi Hospital in a Rickshaw.
Haroon, who was critically injured, was
referred to Peshawar, but he succumbed to his
injuries on the way to hospital, on the same
day at 11:50 a.m. It was Sawab Gul, PW-3, who
lodged the report with Inspector Alam Shah
(PW-7). The latter sent the murasila Ex.PA/1
to the Police Station, Swabi for registration of
the case, prepared injury sheets of injured
Haroon Ex.PM/7, and after his death,
prepared injury sheet & inquest report
(Ex.PM/9 & Ex.PM/10). He also prepared
injury sheets of injured Uzaima and Sidique as
per Ex.PM/3 & Ex.PM/5. The report in shape
of murasila was incorporated into crime
No.806 Ex.PA by Raz Muhammad, ASI. He also
verified its contents as worded in the

murasila.
04. Dr. Qamar Zeb Khan, Medical Officer,

wound measuring 1 x 1 cm.

Fire arm entry wound at left shoulder
anteriorly wound measuring 2 x 2 cm with

09. The site plan Ex.PB was prepared at
the instance of eye witness Farhan Ali. The
appellant was placed under arrest on
10.02.2019 by the SHO of Police Station, Swabi
as is reflected from his card of arrest Ex.PW-
13/1.

10. The motive attributed for the crime
was dispute over domestic affairs.

11. The appellant denied the allegations of
the prosecution and pleaded not guilty to the

charge. He neither produced defence nor

wished to be examined on Oath. On the
conclusion of trail, he was convicted and
sentenced as stated above. His co-accused was
acquitted by the learned Juvenile Court on the
basis of compromise.

12. It appears from the record that the
prosecution case mainly rests on the
testimony of Sawab Gul (PW-3) and Siddique
(PW-4) for an eye witness of the account of
the incident and complainant Sawab Gul is the
father while Siddique is the brother of the
deceased Haroon, recovery of blood stained
earth, 20 crime empties of 7.62 bore and two
empties of 30 bore, from the crime scene,
medical evidence and abscondence of the
appellant.

13. No doubt, the complainant (PW-3) and
Siddique (PW-4) are father and son inter-se
and closely related to the deceased Haroon,
however, it is equally true that appellant is the
real son of the complainant Sawab Gul and
step brother of the deceased, but there is
nothing on the record to indicate that they
have been inimical terms with the appellant or
they deposed falsely against him or that they
were not present on the spot and were not in

a position to identify him, as one of the
assailant. It is by now well settled that mere
relationship with a victim would not render
the witnesses as interested, particularly, when
the charge was brought against him by his real
father. It was observed in the case reported as
“Sohni vs, Bahaduri & 5 others” (PLD 1965 SC
111) that testimony of an interested witness
should be corroborated by independent
evidence, is not of universal application and
that if his testimony is found reliable, the
Court may accept it even without any
corroboration, however, as a matter of
prudence, the Court insists on corroboration
where he inimically deposed towards the
accused. We are of the view that both the
witnesses in the instant case neither
inimically deposed towards the appellant nor
interested, and have no motive to implicate
him falsely, particularly, keeping in view the
relationship with the complainant. We may,
for this view of the matter, refer to the dictum
laid down in the case reported as “Shamsher &
another vs. The State etc” (1973 SCMR 69)
and would now proceed to scrutinize the

testimony of both these witnesses.
|

10

14. | Sawab Gul (PW-3), who is reporter of
the incident, and also real father of the
appellant deposed that he is tenant of
Muazzam Khan and on the day of incident, he,
his sons Farhan & Haroon and grandson
Uzaima, were busy in Zamindara work in the
field at 11:00 am., the appellant and his
grandson Abbas (daughter’s son) appeared on
the crime scene and opened fire with the
intention to kill them. The injured were
removed to the hospital in a Rickshaw. It was
in the hospital, he lodged the report at 11:50
a.m. Siddique (PW-4) supported him and
stated that, he, his father Sawab Gul, brother
Haroon & nephew Uzaima were busy in
Zamindara work in the field, when, at 11:00
a.m, appellant and his step sister’s son Abbas
appeared on the crime scene and murderously
assaulted at them. They were removed to the
hospital in a Rickshaw.

15. Both the witnesses have given a simple
and consistent account of the incident, which
took place in the field of Muazzam Khan, who
happens to be landlord of the complainant,
and who can be deemed to be natural

witnesses. Both of them have the stamp of
11

injuries on their persons and, as such, their
presence at the time of incident cannot be
doubted. Admittedly, the incident took place
in a broad daylight and being close relative of
the assailant, his identity was not difficult,
particularly, in the absence of any visual
hindrance as per site plan Ex.PB. The crime
was reported within fifty (50) minutes in the
hospital, about 2 kilometers away from Police
Station, without any delay and the appellant
and his acquitted co-accused, were specifically
named as offenders for committing the crime.
There is no reason to believe that the
appellant was falsely implicated or
substituted for the real culprit. The
submission of the learned counsel for the
appellant that both the witnesses being
closely related to the victim, are not to be
relied upon would not, in view of our
observation made above, prevail. He further
submitted that mere fact that the witnesses
have received injuries would not by itself be
indicative of their having told the truth. In
support of his contention, he relied upon the
judgment reported as “Said Ayub vs.

Zamrood” (1981 SCMR 795). We have gone
12

through the above judgment relied upon by
the learnd counsel for the appellant. In our
view, the reason recorded in the said
judgment is based on the particular
circumstances of the case and there is no
absolute rule that an injured witness is not to
be relied upon at all. Each case depends upon
its own facts and circumstances and
credibility of the injured witnesses is to be
determined in the light thereof. We are unable
to understand as to why a real father would
bring a false charge against his innocent son
and substitute him for the real culprit as
discussed above. In the instant case there is
nothing on the record to suggest even
remotely that both the witnesses have not
spoken the truth and have deliberately
suppressed certain facts with an ulterior
motive as pleaded by the learned counsel for
the appellant.

16. The learned counsel for the appellant
vehemently submitted that the testimony of
these witnesses was not in conformity with
the medical evidence and as such, cannot be
relied upon with confidence. This contention

of the learned counsel for the appellant seems
——=.-4

13

to be based on misconception. In the case
reported as “Yagoob Shah vs. The State” (PLD
1976 SC 53), it was held that ‘it is well
established principle that expert evidence
may it be medical or that of a Ballistic expert,
is entirely in the nature of confirmatory or
explanatory of direct or other circumstantial
evidence. We found that in the instant case,
not only there is a direct evidence, which is
definite forthright and at the same time
creditworthy and in conformity with the
medical evidence. Scanning of evidence on
record reflects that during cross-examination
while replying to the questions put by the
learned defence counsel for complainant (PW-
3) stated that we had taken breakfast, after
offering Fajar Prayer. I offered my Fajar
Prayer in my house and soon after, we took
our breakfast. We left for the field. At 10 or
10:15 a.m, they took tea, bread and eggs that
time and during postmortem report semi
digested food was found in the stomach of the
dead body of the deceased by the Doctor, who
conducted postmortem on the body of the
deceased. There is nothing on the record to

show that the injuries on the body of injured
14

were not caused by firearms or it were self-
inflicted injuries. The incident had taken place
at 11:00 am. The Doctor who examined the
injured at 11:35, 11:40, 11:45 and opined that
those injuries were fresh whereas, his opinion
with regard to the death of Haroon was to
have taken place about three hours and time
between death and postmortem about one
hour, which is probable. We noted that
autopsy was conducted at 02:55 p.m. and time
of death was given as 13:50 hours. The word
about is significant and would in no way give
rise to any doubt with regard to the time of
incident given by these witnesses.

17.  Adverting to the other grievance of the
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
appellant was that both the injured witnesses
were not present at the time of preparation of
site plan Ex.PB and that it was the duty of the
prosecution to have produced the injured
witness Farhan on whose pointation, site plan
was prepared and who claimed to be one of
the eye witness of the occurrence but he was
not named as an eye witness in the crime
report. He submitted that non-production of

injured Farhan & minor Uzaima is fatal to the
15

prosecution case. Statement of Fahim Khan,
ASI (PW-5) reveals that the site plan (Ex.PB)
was prepared by him at the instance of Farhan
(given up being won over). This argument of
the learned counsel for the appellant equally
has no force. It has not been denied by the
defence that the incident had not occurred on
the place described by the prosecution. It was
observed in the case reported as “Tajuddin vs.
Yousaf and 2 others” (PLD 1976 SC 234). It
was hardly realised that the site plan itself is
not a substitutive piece of evidence which
could be used to contradict or discredit the
unchallenged evidence of the two eye
witnesses. It is true that Farhan at whose
pointation, the site plan was prepared was not
produced at trial being won over, however,
the learned counsel for the appellant could not
show any judgment in support of his plea that
on this ground the site plan is to be ruled out
of consideration.

18. So far non-production of minor Uzaima
is concerned, we observed that he could not
be examined due to his immature
understanding as is reflected from the order

sheet dated 21.07.2020, hence, in our opinion,
16

it is neither fatal to prosecution case nor
disadvantages to it.
19. The record depicts that the appellant
alleged to have absconded after the incident
and SHO PW-13 finally arrested him on
10.02.2019. The warrant of arrest under
section 204 Cr.PC. entrusted to Constable
Wasil Khan could not be executed and he
effected service of proclamation under section
87 Cr.PC. When questioned at the trial as to
how, he would account for his abscondence,
after the occurrence till his arrest on
10.02.2019, he answered as under: -

“I am a_ poverty person for

earning my livelihood, I had

proceeded to Afghanistan in

illegal way and when I came to my

native village and learnt about

the occurrence, I surrendered

myself before the local police.

Besides in a sit in, I had satisfied

my father about my innocence, he

had agreed, however, my step

mother and brothers are bent

upon my false implication and my

conviction”
20. No doubt, on 10.02.2019, at the time of
arrest, a Kalashnikov, alleged to have used in
the commission of offence, was recovered
from personal possession of the accused,
however, in the absence of its matching report

with the crime empties, it is of no help to the

prosecution.
17

21. Turning to the applicability of section
34 Cr.PC, we have no hesitation in our minds
to hold that the appellant and his sister’s son
came to the crime scene duly armed with
deadly weapons ostensibly to use them as
preplanned. The nature of the weapon would
legitimately lead to the inference that they
were prepared to use them on_ the
complainant party. All the section 34 PPC
requires that accused is one of the
participator and the joint criminal action in
the course of which the offence was
committed. In this context reliance can well be
placed on the judgment reported as “Rasool

Bakhsh_vs. The State” (PLD 1970 SC 316)
wherein, it was held as under: -

“There is no doubt that to bring
a case within the ambit of
section 34, P. P. C. it is
necessary that some overt act or
acts must be established to lead
to the inference that the
participators in the crime acted
in pre-concert or under some
pre-arranged plan but this does
not mean that every participant
in the crime must be shown to
have committed the same kind of
act. It is sufficient to show that
they joined together in the
commission of a particular act,
for, then they must all be
deemed to have intended the
natural and inevitable
consequences of that act even if
some of them did nothing but
18

merely helped by their presence

in the commission of the act.

The question thus resolves itself

into this, namely; as to whether

the person sought to be made

constructively liable did do

anything with an intention to

co-operate in the offence, if so,

he is liable”
22. Emergence of the appellant and his
sister's son Abbas carrying fire arms, on the
crime scene and firing at the complainant
party and fleeing from the spot together. This
conduct indicates the existence of pre-concert
and they did share common intention in
committing the crime and as such, the
appellant cannot escape his liability with
regard to the commission of offence.
23. Coming to quantum of sentence, we
found that the prosecution failed to establish
motive as alleged in the crime report and it
was considered as mitigating circumstance for
awarding the lessor sentence of life
imprisonment which in our opinion is
sufficient to meet the ends of justice,
therefore, needs no interference.
24. Judging the case from all angles, we are
of the view that the prosecution has

succeeded in establishing the guilt of the

appellant beyond any shadow of doubt, his
19

conviction is based on proper appreciation of
evidence and is well founded, therefore, the
same is maintained, as a result, the appeal and

criminal revision fail and are dismissed

accordingly.
