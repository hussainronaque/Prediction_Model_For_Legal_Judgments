FAZAL SUBHAN, J.- Through instant criminal appeal under

section 417 Cr.P.C, the State Advocate General Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa has called in question the judgment/order dated
07.10.2019 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-
III/Model Criminal Trial Court (MCTC), Lakki Mwarat,
whereby the accused/ respondents were acquitted in case FIR
No. 526 dated 09.8.2015 registered under sections
302/324/148/149 PPC of police station Lakki District Lakki

Marwat.

2. Record transpires that the complainant Gul
Janan son of Sorat Khan took the dead bodies of deceased Rafi
Ullah (son), Mujib-ur-Rehman son of Naseeb Ahmad,

(grandson) and injured Saifulah, his other son, to City
Hospital, Lakki Marwat and reported at emergency room that
on the day of occurrence at about 05:30 a.m., he along with his
sons Rafi Ullah, Saifullah and grandson Mujib-ur-Rehman
were present in front of the Baithak of Yousaf Khan, his
brother, when in the meanwhile Munawar Khan, armed with
pistol, Safdar Khan, having SMG, Javed Iqbal, armed with
dagger, Saad Ullah, armed with 3x3 bore rifle and Farid Ullah,
armed with pistol, came and were passing in front of the
Baitakh and when they arrived near them, accused Munawar
Khan made firing upon Rafi Ullah with the intention to cause
his death and as a result he was hit, got injured and fell and at
the same time Javed Iqbal gave dagger blows to Rafi Ullah.
Due to firing they ran away, however, Saad Ullah ran after his
grandson Mujib-ur-Rehman and made firing upon him, who
also got hit and fell down while Munawar Khan and Farid
Ullah fired on Saif Ullah and due to their firing he also got
injured and fell down, whereafter all the accused left the spot.
When he attended the injured Rafi Ullah, his son and Mujib-
ur-Rehman, his grandson, they had already expired while Saif
Ullah sustained serious injuries. According to him the incident
was witnessed by him as well as injured son Saif Ullah and

motive for the occurrence was described to be dispute over
womenfolk. He, therefore, charged all the above named

accused for the commission of offence.

3. After registration of the case, investigation in the
case was carried out and initially the accused were absconding
and challan under section 512 Cr.P.C was submitted against
them. Later on the accused Farid Ullah, Javed Iqbal and
Munawar Khan were arrested and challan against them was
submitted. The learned trial Court summoned the accused from
jail, being in custody and after observing legal formalities
under section 265-C Cr.P.C, formal charge was framed against
them to which they did not plead guilty and claimed trial. In
order to prove its case the prosecution examined 10 witnessed,

the brief gist of prosecution evidence is as under:-

4. PW-1 is the statement of Arshad Ullah khan SHO,

who submitted complete challan on 16.9.2015.

5. PW Muhammad Usman ASI deposed that on
getting information of the occurrence he visited City Hospital
Lakki Marwat and on the report of Gul Janan, he prepared
murasila Ex.PW2/1 which was read over to him and after
admitting it correct, he thumb impressed the same as a token of
its correctness and forwarded the murasila to police station for

registration of case. He prepared injury sheets of both the
deceased Ex.PW2/2 and Ex.PW2/4 and their inquest reports
Ex.PW2/5 and Ex.PW2/6 respectively and referred the
deceased and injured for post mortem examination as well as

medical treatment.

6. Imtiaz Khan, ASHO Pezu was ASI police station

Mujib-ur-Rehman before the doctor as well as before the

police.

7. Statement of Gul Janan son of Surat Khan was
recorded as PW-6, who narrated the same story as reported by
him in his report. Similar statement was recorded by PW-7
Saif Ullah. Here it is to be mentioned that the cross-
examination of these witnesses were reserved after recording
their examination-in-chief, however, thereafter they failed to
appear to conclude their statements by offering themselves for
cross-examination for the reason that they stood charged in a

murder case and had absconding.
8. PW-8 is the statement of Dr. Umar Hayat, who
examined injured Saif Ullah son of Gul Janan and found the

following wounds:-
1. One fire arm entry wound on front of right leg size

whereof were placed on file as Ex.PW9/2 and Ex.PW9/10

along with his report Ex.PW9/11 to Ex.PW9/2.

10. PW-10 is the statement of Abdur Rahim, Retired
SI, who conducted investigation in the case and his detailed

statement reveals proceeding carried out by him during the
investigation, hence being already available on the file needs

no reproduction.

11. With these statements prosecution closed its
evidence. Statement of Inam Ullah No.83 P.S Lakki was
recorded as CW-1 and as per his statement he was entrusted
with verification notice of death of dead accused Munawar
Khan and according to him as per FIR No.790 dated 31.8.2019
udner sections 302/34 PPC of P.S Lakki Marwat the said
Munawar Khan has been murdered. His report was placed on
file as Ex.CW 1/2. Similarly, statement of Naab Khan ASI, P.S
Lakki Marwat was recorded as CW-2, to whom non-bailable
warrant of arrest of complainant Gul Janan and Saif Ullah eye
witness/injured were entrusted and according to him Gul Janan
has been charged and is absconding in case FIR 790 dated
31.8.2019 under sections 302/34 PPC of police station Lakki
Marwat. His report in this respect was placed on file as

EX.CW2/1.

12. Thereafter statement of accused Javed Iqbal and
Farid Ullah were recorded, wherein they pleaded innocence
and contended to have been falsely implicated in the case.
They both, however, declined to record their statements on

oath or to produce any defence evidence. The learned trial
Court after hearing arguments in the case through impugned
judgment acquitted the accused/ respondents on 07.10.2019
which judgment is now assailed by the State through instant

criminal appeal.

13. Arguments of learned AAG for State heard and
record gone through.
14. It is well settled law by now that the prosecution

who brings a charge against an accused in any criminal case
has to prove its case through cogent, reliable and conscious
inspiring evidence. It is added that where the charge relates to
capital punishment then standard of evidence is required to be
of high quality to connect the accused with the commission of
crime. Analyzing the present case on these principles it is
evident that complainant Gul Janan lodged the report in respect
of the murder of his son Rafi Ullah, grandson Mujib-ur-
Rehman and injuries to his other son Saif Ullah in the
occurrence at the hands of respondents and absconding co-
accused Safdar Munir and Saad Ullah. The complainant Gul
Janan and injured Saif Ullah were the two prime witnesses of
the prosecution, whose evidence was of much worth and value
for the reasons that both these witnesses have not only seen the

entire episode but in the same incident PW-7 Saif Ullah had
sustained injuries. The complainant Gul Janan was not only to
support the authenticity of the report lodged by him but he was
also to describe the event that took place on the relevant day
with all the facts relating to the death of deceased Rafi Ullah
and Mujib-ur-Rehman and injuries sustained by PW Saif
Ullah. These material witnesses appeared during the trial as
PW-6 and PW-7 and on 29.8.2019. Their examination-in-
chief was recorded and on perusal it is clear that their
statements are reiteration of the report lodged by PW Gul
Janan with some additions which need not to be discussed
here. The test of veracity of a witness lies in the cross-
examination. Article 132 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984
(Order) has described the mode and manner of examination of
a witness and cross-examination. The said provision is

reproduced below for better understanding:-

“132, Examination-in-Chief, ete.: (1) The
examination of a witness by the party who calls
him shall be called his examination-in-chief.

(2) The examination of a witness by the
adverse party shall be called his cross
examination.

(3) The examination of a _ witness,
subsequent to the cross-examination by the party
who called him, shall be called his re-
examination.”

The purpose of examination-in-chief is a mode of describing

the assertion of a witness in respect of a fact seen, observed or
-10-

came into his knowledge through any other source. Thus
examination-in-chief consists of revelation of material facts
deposed by a witness. On the other hand the right of cross-
examination of an adverse party is an inalienable right
contemplated in Article 132 (2) of the above Order. The
importance of cross-examination is to unearth the actual facts
from the witnesses. Its purpose is also important for the reason
that if a fact stated by a witness is not put to the test of cross-
examination then the same shall be deemed to have been
admitted. Reliance is placed on PLD 2011 SC 296. Thus right
of cross-examination is not a mere formality but a valuable
right available to the opposite side. In the case of Senator

Lt.Gen. (Rtd.) Saeed Qadir-Vs-The State, PLD 1997 Lahore

26, it was held that:-

“Tt is the cardinal principle of law that cross-
examination is the greatest legal engine ever
invented far discovery of truth, thus full
latitude, be given to the learned counsel, who
conducts the case in the trial Court to
exercise this legal right.”

Similarly, in case title Muhammad Javed-Vs-The State,

reported in 2001 MLD Karchi 1206, it was observed that:-

“The cross-examination has been held to be
the "great legal engine" ever invented for the
discovery of truth. The opportunity to cross-
examine a witness contemplated by the law
must be real, fair and reasonable. It is not an
-ll-

empty formality but a valuable right and best
method for ascertaining forensic truth.”

15. In the instant case complainant Gul Janan and PW
Saif Ullah appeared on 29.8.2019 and recorded their
examination-in-chief and their cross-examination was reserved
on the request of learned defence counsel. Their cross-
examination could not be recorded on the subsequent two
dates, however, on 16.9.2019 a report was submitted before
the trial Court that Munawar Khan, an accused facing trial in
the case, was murdered and an FIR No. 390 dated 31.8.2019
under sections 302/34 PPC of PS Lakki Marwat was
registered. A copy of the said FIR was also placed on file
which reveals that accused Munawar Khan was fired at by
accused Zahid son of Gul Janan and Gul Janan son of Sorat
Khan. After being charged in a murder case complainant Gul
Janan and PW Saif Ullah disappeared and despite warrants of
arrest their attendance before the trial Court for recording their
cross-examination could not be materialized, whereafter
prosecution closed its evidence. Thus the complainant Gul
Janan and PW Saif Ullah abstained from the Court to face the
brunt of cross-examination. When they have failed to put
appearance before the court and their cross-examination could

not be recorded then the requirements of Article 132 of the
-12-

Order has not been completed/complied which requires that
when an examination-in-chief of a witness is recorded then he/
they shall be examined by adverse party through cross-
examination. Due to abscondance of these two material
witnesses it may be safely held that prosecution has withheld
best evidence for proving its case beyond shadow of doubt. In

this respect reliance can be placed on the case of Muhammad

Shahzad _and_others-Vs-The_ State_and others, reported in

2023 P.Cr.L.J 1054 [Lahore], wherein it has been held that:-

“xvi) All the more, the best evidence which
could come either from the injured wife of
the deceased Mst. Shazia Bibi or from the
aforesaid Lumberdar, Head of Punchayat,
has been withheld. Mst. Shazia Bibi got
herself medically examined and her MLR
was exhibited as Exh.PB, PB/1 and PC; she
got recorded her statement under section
161, Cr.P.C. on 18.08.2015 but she being
the star/direct witness was not produced
before the learned trial Court, leading to
adverse inference against prosecution.”

In case titled Ghulam Qadir and 2 others-Vs-The State, 2008
SCMR 1221, the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as

under:-

“Best evidence has been with held without
any justifiable reason. Needless to add that if,
an injured witness himself does not appear to
charge an accused for his injury and the Court
is not satisfied with his disability or
incompetence or reasons for not appearing
then the conviction for his injury cannot be
-13-

recorded on the basis of other evidence under
Qisas, as held by this Court in Asghar Ali
alias Sabah v. The State 1992 SCMR 2088.”
Similarly, in case titled Asghar Ali alias Sabah and others-

Vs-The State and others, reported in 1992 SCMR_ 2088, the

apex Court has held that:-

“Under the Injunctions of Islam, if an injured
witness himself does not appear to charge an
accused for his injury and the Court is not
satisfied with his disability or incompetence
or reason for not appearing then the
conviction for his injury cannot be recorded
on the basis of other evidence under Qisas
provision. Qisas is a personal right and as it
now stands, if the person aggrieved therefrom
forgives it, and one way of forgiving the
wrong doer is not appearing in support of the
case against the wrongdoer, there will be no
Qisas.”

16. It is, therefore, held that in the absence of
complete evidence of the complainant Gul Janan and injured
Saif Ullah, the prosecution has failed to bring home the guilt of
the accused beyond reasonable doubt by withholding their best

evidence.

17. Though prosecution has examined witnesses, total
8 in number, including the investigation officer, medical
officer and the marginal witnesses of the recovery memos in
support of prosecution case, however, the basic foundation of
the case could not be established due to lack of material

witnesses of the case. The complainant Gul Janan was to prove
-14-

each and every aspect of the report lodged by him through FIR
Ex.PW3/1 as well as to prove the site plan Ex.PB and all its
contents and recovery memos Ex.PW10/1 and Ex.PW10/2,
however, he preferred to stay away from the trial which was
heavily dependent upon his statement than other material
collected during investigation was of no worth and value to the
prosecution case and in these circumstances the learned trial
Court was left with no other option but to acquit the

respondents in the case.

18. We have gone through the impugned judgment
and have found that it does not suffer from any illegality,
infirmity and is based on proper appreciation of evidence and
hold that the benefit of doubt was rightly extended to the
respondent, therefore, the impugned judgment, whereby the
respondent was acquitted is upheld and the appeal in hand

being bereft of merits is hereby dismissed in limine.
