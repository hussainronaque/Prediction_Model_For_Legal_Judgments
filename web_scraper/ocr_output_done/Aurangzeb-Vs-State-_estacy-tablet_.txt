ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, J:- Through this single order,
I, propose to decide the instant bail application and
connected Cr.Misc.BA No.191-P/2018, filed by petitioners
Aurangzeb and Malook, respectively, for their release on
bail in case FIR No.95 dated 28.11.2017, registered under
section 9 (c ) Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997
(the Act of 1997), in Police Station Anti Narcotics Force
(ANF), Peshawar.

2. The prosecution case as set forth in the FIR is that
on receipt of spy information qua trafficking of huge
quantity of Ecstasy Tablets by an afghan national, namely,
Malook through a motorcar bearing registration

No.ICT.510, Mehmood ul Hassan SHO alongwith other
ANF officials, on 28.11.2017 conducted a barricade in
front of General Hospital Ring Road, Peshawar, and at
1600 hours, intercepted the said vehicle. On query, its
driver disclosed his name as Malook, who on cursory
interrogation pointed out availability of two packets
containing Ecstasy tables in the secret cavities made in the
doors of the motorcar. Accordingly, the same were
recovered, on weighing each packet was found 500 grams.
On further interrogation, he disclosed the recovered tablets
to have been purchased from one Aurangzeb resident of
Gharib Abad Peshawar. House of the latter was
immediately raided and he was busted in front of his house
and on his pointation/discovery, 32 packets, containing
Ecstasy tables in different from and colours, total weighing
17600 grams, were recovered from beneath a bed lying in
the residential room of his house, hence, this case.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record perused with their able assistance.

4. The main thrust of the arguments of learned
counsel for the petitioners was that, on one hand, the
Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) having been not
equipped with the skill and equipments, by no stretch of
imagination was competent to examine the tablets and give
any opinion, while on the other hand, has not specifically
mentioned the percentage of contents ie.

Methamphetamine, Benzodiazepine, Phencyclidine and
Morphine in each tablet which was the mandatory
requirement of the Rules framed under the Control of
Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, hence, on this ground, the
case of the petitioners requires further probe and are
entitled to the concession of bail.

5. Any discussion on the competency of the FSL to
examine the samples of the recovered tablets and
authenticity or otherwise of its report in light of the rules
framed under the Control of Narcotic Substances Act,
1997, would amount to deeper appreciation, falling in the
domain of the trial Court, has been deprecated by the
Hon’ble superior Courts at bail stage. On tentative
assessment of the material on record, this court observed
that first on pointation of petitioner Malook Ecstasy tablets
were recovered from secret cavities of the motorcar being
driven by him, and then on his disclosure petitioner
Aurangzeb was arrested. Search of his house led to
discovery and recovery of a huge quantity of Ecstasy
tablets was recovered. Samples from the recovered tablets,
had been sent to the FSL, and as per report thereof, the
samples tablets were containing Methamphetamine
Benzodiazepine, Phencyclidine and Morphine, which
ingredients fall within the definition of controlled
substance and psychotropic substance. As per search of this
Court, Methamphetamine is an illegal drug in the same

class as cocaine and other powerful street drugs. It has
many nicknames i.e. meth, crank, chalk or speed being the
most common. Crystal meth is used by individuals of all
ages, but is most commonly used as a “club drug”, taken
while partying in night clubs or at rave parties. Its most
common street names are “Ice” or “glass”. It is a dangerous
and potent chemical and, as with all drugs, a poison that
first acts as a stimulant but then begins to systematically
destroy the body. Phencyclidine also known as angle dust
among other names, is a drug used for mind alerting
effects. It may result in images that seem real though are
not, distorted sounds, and violent behavior. As a
recreational drug, it is typically smoked, but may be taken
by mouth, snorted, or injected. As per analysis its adverse
effects may include seizures, coma, addiction and an
increased risk of suicide. Similarly, morphine is the most
abundant analgesic opiate found in opium and is a potent
pain reliever. The Drug is used in clinical pain relief but is
also used illicitly for recreational among drug users. It is
potentially highly addictive and can cause intense physical
dependence that leads to abuse of the substance. Witnesses
to the recovery proceedings, in their statements under
section 161 Cr.P.C., who on the face of record, has no ill
will or enmity with the petitioners, fully support the stance
of the seizing Officer.

6. For the foregoing reasons, the petitioners are prima

facie connected with the commission of offence
punishment of which falls within the Prohibitory clause of
section 51 CNS, Act, 1997, hence, I am not inclined to
exercise the discretion of bail in their favour. Accordingly,
both the petitions are hereby dismissed.

7. Needless to mention that observations of this Court
in the instant order are tentative in nature which shall not
prejudice/influenced the mind of the trial Court and the fate
of the case shall be decided on the basis of the available
evidence and material on record.
