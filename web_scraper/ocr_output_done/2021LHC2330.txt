Crl. Appeal No.615-J of 2014 2

3. Brief facts of the case as narrated in complaint (Ex.PB), on the
basis of which the formal FIR (Ex.PC), was chalked out are that
Amanat Ali complainant (PW-4), was resident of Old Rehmanpura,
Changa Manga. About 1 % months ago, the complainant got
contracted Nikah of his sister with one Muhammad Ramzan but the
rukhsati had not taken place. Accused persons, namely, Jahangir etc.
(named in the FIR) were annoyed from the said Nikah. On 25.04.2011,
at about 1.00 P.M., the complainant was not present in his house,
however, sisters of the complainant namely Mst. Zubaida (alleged
victim) and Mst. Abida Bibi (PW-9), were present there. In the
meanwhile Jahangir son of Muhammad Ilyas (co-accused since P.O),
while armed with pistol, Arif (co-accused since P.O) while armed with
pistol, Muhammad Jahangir son of Amir (co-accused since acquitted)
while armed with gun, Sughra Bibi (co-accused since P.O) and Allah
Rakhi (co-accused since P.O) along with two unknown accused while
armed with firearms came to the house of the complainant and entered
into the said house after knocking the door. Mst. Abida Bibi (PW-9)
tried to make noise but the accused persons threatened her and
wrapped ‘dupatta’ around her neck. The accused persons also tortured
Mst. Zubaida Bibi (alleged victim/PW-5). Both the sisters of the
complainant were taken to a room of the complainant’s house where
they searched an iron box and robbed 03-Tolas gold ornaments and
cash amount of Rs.50,000/- from the said box. The accused persons
also snatched 02-Tolas gold ornaments from Mst. Zubaida Bibi
(alleged victim). The accused persons thereafter abducted Mst.
Zubaida Bibi at gun point. Muhammad Ramzan (PW since given-up)
and Malik Muhammad Anwar (PW-10), attracted to the spot and saw
the accused persons while abducting Mst. Zubaida Bibi (alleged

victim) in a car.

Initially the FIR was lodged under section 496-A PPC but
subsequently on 27.04.2011, on the basis of statement of Mst. Zubaida
Bibi (alleged victim) recorded under section 164 Cr.P.C, beside
addition of further accused persons in this case, namely, Ghaffar alias

Kali (appellant), Iftikhar (accused since acquitted), Zulfiqar (accused
Crl. Appeal No.615-J of 2014 3

since acquitted) and Mansha (accused since P.O), offence under

section 376 PPC, was also added in this case.

4. The appellant was arrested in this case by the police and after
completion of investigation the challan was prepared and submitted
before the learned trial court. The learned trial Court, after observing
legal formalities, as provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1898 framed charge against the appellant and his co-accused on
03.07.2012, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In
order to prove its case the prosecution produced eleven witnesses.
Prosecution also produced documentary evidence in the shape of
Ex.PA to Ex.PO. The statements of the appellant and his co-accused
under section 342 Cr.P.C, were recorded, wherein they refuted the

allegations levelled against them and professed their innocence.

5. The learned trial Court vide its judgment dated 21.10.2014,
found the appellant guilty, convicted and sentenced him as mentioned

and detailed above, hence the instant appeal.

6. As per police report, the complainant of the case, namely,
Amanat Ali had died and notice of this case has duly been served on
his real brother, namely, Liaqat Ali who had been pursuing the instant
case but despite repeated calls no one appeared on behalf of the
complainant before this Court today. Even otherwise, it is a State case
and the learned Additional Prosecutor General for the State is ready to
argue the same, therefore, I proceed to decide the instant appeal after
hearing arguments of learned defence counsel for the appellant,
learned Additional Prosecutor General for the State and perusal of the

record.

7. It is contended by learned defence counsel for the appellant that
offence under section 376 PPC was punishable with death and the
same was triable by the Sessions Court but neither the appellant was
offered by the learned trial Court to cross-examine the prosecution
witnesses nor defence counsel at the State expenses was provided to

the appellant as required under Rule 1 Part C Volume 3 Chapter 24 of
Crl. Appeal No.615-J of 2014 4

the High Court Rules and Orders; that the right of cross-examination
on the prosecution witnesses was a very valuable right of the accused/
appellant in order to test the credibility of the said witnesses but fair
opportunity to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses has not been
provided to the appellant/accused; that the appellant was not named in
the FIR and accused person, namely, Jahangir son of Muhammad
Ameer nominated in the FIR, as well as, Iftikhar and Zufliqar, accused
persons implicated in this case through the statement of the alleged
victim, namely, Mst. Zubaida Bibi (PW.5) recorded under section 164
Cr.P.C., have been acquitted by the learned trial Court vide impugned
judgment on the basis of same prosecution evidence which has rightly
been disbelieved by the learned trial Court but the appellant has been
convicted and sentenced mainly due to the reason that he did not
cross-examine the prosecution witnesses; that the prosecution
evidence was highly doubtful and untrustworthy but the same has
wrongly been relied upon by the learned trial Court; that neither any
car or motorcycle nor any gold ornament or cash, mobile set or
weapon has been recovered from the possession of the appellant; that
no DNA test report has been produced in the prosecution evidence to
connect the appellant with the alleged offence; that the prosecution
miserably failed to prove its case against the appellant beyond the
shadow of doubt, therefore, this appeal may be accepted and the
appellant may be acquitted while setting aside the impugned
judgment. In support of his contentions, learned defence counsel for
the appellant has placed reliance on the judgments reported as
“Ghulam Rasool Shah and another Vs. The State” (2011 SCMR 735),
“Syed Saeed Muhammad Shah_and_ another Vs. The State” (1993
SCMR 550) and “Abdul Ghafoor Vs. The State” (2011 SCMR 23).

8. On the other hand, the learned Additional Prosecutor General
has supported the impugned judgment on the ground that the
prosecution has proved its case against the appellant beyond the
shadow of any doubt; that the evidence of prosecution witnesses is
trustworthy and reliable; that the prosecution case against the appellant

is supported by the medical evidence according to which the hymen of
Crl. Appeal No.615-J of 2014 5

the victim, namely, Mst. Zubaida Bibi (PW.5) was found to be
ruptured; that the appellant could not establish any mala fide on the
part of the prosecution witnesses for his false involvement in the
instant case; that there is no substance in the this appeal, therefore, the

same may be dismissed.
9. Arguments heard and record perused.

10. The detail of the prosecution case has already been given in
paragraph No.3 of this judgment, therefore, there is no need to repeat

the same.

11. Ihave noted that FIR was initially lodged under section 496-A
PPC against Jahangir son of Ilyas, Arif, Jahangir son of Muhammad
Ameer, Mst. Sughran Bibi and Mst. Allah Rakhi, co-accused
alongwith two unknown accused persons, with the allegation that on
25.04.2011 at about 1:00 P.M. (Noon), the above mentioned accused
persons forcibly abducted sister of the complainant, namely, Mst.
Zubaida Bibi (PW.5) at gun point while boarding her in a vehicle. It
was further alleged that the accused persons also robbed total five
tolas gold ornament and cash amount of Rs.50,000/- from the house of
the complainant at the time of occurrence. Consequently, FIR (Ex.PC)
was lodged against the above mentioned Jahangir accused persons etc.
Ghaffar alias Kali (appellant) was not named in the FIR. He alongwith
three additional accused was implicated in this case on the basis of
statement of the alleged abductee, namely, Mst. Zubaida Bibi (PW.5)
recorded under section 164 Cr.P.C. wherein she stated that after her
abduction by the above-referred Jahangir accused etc. she was taken
to a house situated in village Lakhan-ke near Sarai Chimba, where
Ghaffar alias Kali (appellant), Zulfiqar Dogar (co-accused since
acquitted), Iftikhar alias Pappu Shah (co-accused since acquitted) and
Mansha Dogar (co-accused since P.O.) committed rape with her, turn
by turn. It is noteworthy that three other accused tried in this case,
namely, Jahangir son of Muhammad Ameer, Zulfiqar Dogar and
Iftikhar alias Pappu Shah have been acquitted by the learned trial

Court. The remaining accused persons mentioned in the FIR (except
Crl. Appeal No.615-J of 2014 6

Jahangir son of Muhammad Ameer) were not tried in this case
because they were declared proclaimed offenders in this case. It is true
that neither any motorcycle nor any car or weapon of offence has been
recovered from the possession of the appellant. Likewise, it is also
true that neither any gold ornament nor any cash amount or mobile
phone set through which the complainant party was allegedly
threatened by the co-accused has been recovered from the possession
of the appellant. The argument of learned counsel for the appellant is
also correct that no DNA test report has been brought on the record by
the prosecution though the Medical Officer in the MLR of Mst.
Zubaida Bibi (PW.5) categorically mentioned that vaginal swabs
taken in this case had been sent to the office of Punjab Forensic
Science Agency, Lahore for DNA test. In-spite of all the above
mentioned facts, the appellant has been convicted and sentenced by
the learned trial Court because statement of Mst. Zubaida Bibi
(alleged victim/PW.5) was not cross-examined by the appellant or his
learned counsel and right of the appellant to cross-examine the said
Mst. Zubaida Bibi (PW.5) and other prosecution witnesses was
closed. The perusal of the record shows that on 27.09.2012, Ch.
Muhammad Sajid Wains Advocate submitted his Power of Attorney
on behalf of Ghaffar alias Kali (appellant) and Iftikhar alias Pappu
Shah (co-accused since acquitted). Perusal of order dated 07.03.2013
of the learned trial Court further shows that said learned counsel made
a statement before the Court on behalf of Iftikhar alias Pappu Shah
and Zulfiqar Ali, co-accused that he does not want to cross-examine
the prosecution witnesses, namely, Amanat Ali (PW.4) and Mst.
Zubaida Bibi (PW.5). It is further mentioned in the above-referred
order of the learned trial Court that learned counsel for Ghaffar alias
Kali (appellant) and Jahangir (co-accused since acquitted) did not
appear before the Court on the said date due to the strike of the
Lawyers, which means that there was some misunderstanding about
the appointment of the counsel in this case on behalf of the appellant
because Power of Attorney of above-referred Ch. Muhammad Sajid

Wains Advocate shows that he was also appointed as counsel on
Crl. Appeal No.615-J of 2014 7

behalf of the appellant. However, cross-examination on the above
mentioned prosecution witnesses on behalf of Ghaffar alias Kali
(appellant) and Jahangir (co-accused since acquitted) was reserved on
the said date by the learned trial Court. It is further noteworthy from
the perusal of the orders dated 16.09.2014 and 22.09.2014 that right of
cross-examination of the appellant on the prosecution witnesses,
namely, Mst. Abida Bibi (PW.9) and Malik Muhammad Anwar
(PW.10), as well as, on Amanat Ali (PW.4), Mst. Zubaida Bibi
(PW.5) and Niamat Ali (PW.11) was closed by the learned trial Court
on the above mentioned dates, respectively on the ground that Ghaffar
alias Kali (appellant) had not yet appointed his counsel in this case.
The above mentioned orders dated 16.09.2014 and 22.09.2014 read as

under:-

“16.09.2014

Present: Learned DDPP for state
Accused Ghaffar under police custody.
Accused Zulfigar, Iftikhar with their learned counsel
Muhammad Sajad Veins, Adv.
Accused Jahangir on bail without his learned counsel.
PWs Abida Bibi and Malik Muhammad Anwar are
present.
Learned counsel for complainant Pir Mansha Bodla,
Adv.

Evidence of PW-9 and PW-10 has been recorded and
completed by closing right of cross examination of accused Jahangir
and Ghaffar as accused Ghaffar did not yet appoint his learned
counsel whereas accused Jahangir showed his inability to produce his
defence counsel. No other PW is present. Now to come up for
remaining prosecution evidence on 19.09.2014. Remaining PW/I.0.

be summoned by SHO concerned.”

“22.09.2014

Present: Learned DDPP for state.
Accused Ghaffar under police custody.
Accused Zulfigar, Iftikhar with their learned counsel
Muhammad Sajad Veins, Adv.
Accused Jahangir on bail without his learned counsel.
PWs are present.
Learned counsel for complainant.

Evidence of PW-11 has been recorded and completed
by closing right of cross examination of accused Jahangir and Ghaffar

as accused Ghaffar did not yet appoint his learned counsel whereas
Crl. Appeal No.615-J of 2014 8

accused Jahangir showed his inability to produce his defence counsel.
Similarly, their right of cross examination on PW-4 and PW-S has also
been closed due to above said reason. No other PW is left to be
examined. Now to come up for closing the prosecution evidence and

statemernts of accused u/s 342 of Cr.P.C. on 24.09.2014.”

It is evident from the perusal of the above mentioned orders of the
learned trial Court that the right to cross-examine the prosecution
witnesses of the appellant was closed merely on the ground that he
(appellant) had not yet appointed his counsel in this case. Offence
under section 376 PPC is punishable with death or imprisonment
for life and the same is triable by the Sessions Court. Under Rule 1
Part C Volume 3 Chapter 24 of the High Court Rules and Orders, if an
accused is unrepresented in a Sessions case or he cannot afford to
engage a counsel, the Sessions Judge/Additional Sessions Judge is
bound to make arrangement to employ a counsel at government
expense for the said accused. The above mentioned rule reads as

under:-

*[1. Presiding Officer to report whether accused can afford
to engage counsel. If the accused is unrepresented in a
Sessions case and cannot afford to engage a counsel, the
Sessions Judge shall make arrangement to employ a counsel at
Government expense. Counsel in such cases should be
appointed well in time to enable him to study the documents
mentioned in section 265-C of the Code of Criminal

Procedure.”

It is, therefore, evident from the perusal of record that trial of the
appellant has been conducted and concluded in blatant and flagrant
violation of above-referred rule on the subject. If, the appellant was
unable to hire the services of a counsel in this case which was a
Sessions trial or counsel appointed by him refused to represent him or
to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses on his behalf, then it was
duty of the Court to provide him a counsel at the State expenses.
Moreover, it is by now well settled that a Court cannot come to just

and fair decision of the case unless the credibility of a witness is
Crl. Appeal No.615-J of 2014 9

tested on the touchstone of cross-examination. Cross-examination of
the prosecution witnesses is very valuable right of the accused. In the

case of “Ghulam Rasool Shah and another Vs. The State” (2011

SCMR 735), the Hon’ble Supreme Court was pleased to observe that
credibility of a prosecution witness cannot be tested unless he is
subjected to cross-examination. It was further held that even the cross-
examination conducted by an accused himself cannot be considered to
be substitute of cross-examination conducted by a counsel. The
relevant part of the said judgment is reproduced hereunder for ready

reference:-

10. Notwithstanding the afore-stated observation, we are of
the view that in a case of capital punishment a Court cannot
come to a just decision unless the credibility of the witness is
tested on the touchstone of cross-examination. Injustice is
likely to occur in a case where cross-examination on the
witnesses was not conducted either by the counsel provided
at State expenses on account of unwillingness of the accused
or by the accused themselves; Even, the cross-examination
conducted by the accused himself has not been considered to

be substitute of cross-examination conducted by a counsel.”

Likewise, in the case of “Abdul Ghafoor Vs. The State” (2011 SCMR
23), the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan set aside the judgment of

learned trial Court, as well as, of the High Court and remitted the case
to the Sessions Court while providing opportunity to the
accused/appellant of cross-examination on the prosecution witnesses
on the ground that if, the counsel engaged by the appellant sought too
many adjournments even then it was duty of the learned trial Court to
provide defence counsel at State expenses to the accused or could
have given last opportunity to the accused to make arrangement to
hire the services of another counsel. The relevant part of the said

judgment reads as under:-

“7, With immense respect to the learned Judges of the High
Court, we are persuaded to hold that it is the primary
responsibility of the court seized of a matter to ensure that

the truth is discovered and the accused are brought to justice.
Crl. Appeal No.615-J of 2014 10

If the learned trial Court found that the counsel engaged by
the appellant had sought too many adjournments, even then
he was not appearing, the court could either have directed
that a defence counsel be provided to the appellant at State
expense or could have given last opportunity to the appellant
to make alternate arrangements failing which the court
would proceed to decide the matter. This course was not
adopted by the learned trial Court and instead on 2-12-1999
gave a total surprise to the appellant by asking him to cross-
examine those witnesses for which obviously neither the
appellant had the requisite expertise nor he was prepared to
do so. In these circumstances and in view of the fair
concession given by the State, we find that the procedure
adopted by the learned trial Court is reflective of miscarriage
of justice and the appellant be provided one opportunity to
have the afore-referred witnesses cross-examined.

Consequently, this appeal succeeds on this short ground.”

Similar view was taken by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in
the case of “Syed Saeed Muhammad Shah and another Vs. The State”’
(1993 SCMR 550).

12. In the light of above discussion, this appeal is allowed and the
impugned judgment dated 21.10.2014 passed by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge, Chunian District Kasur is hereby set aside.
The case is remanded to the learned District & Sessions Judge, Kasur
who shall either proceed with the matter himself or entrust the same to
any other Additional Sessions Judge of his district. The appellant shall
be treated as under-trial prisoner. The learned trial Court shall provide
opportunity to the appellant to hire the services of a private counsel of
his own choice and in case of refusal of the appellant to hire a private
counsel then the appellant shall be given the choice to choose a
defence counsel from the list of defence counsel maintained by the
learned Sessions Judge, Kasur. The learned private counsel or defence
counsel appointed at State expense to represent the appellant in this
case, shall be provided three opportunities to cross-examine the
prosecution witnesses. As this is an old matter which pertains to the

year 2011 and the appellant is behind the bars from the last more than
Crl. Appeal No.615-J of 2014 11

nine years and five months, therefore, the learned trial Court shall
decide the matter within a period of thirty (30) days from the date of
receipt of attested copy of this judgment. The learned trial Court shall
decide the case afresh on its own merits without being influenced by
any observation made by this Court in the instant judgment or by any
observation made in the impugned judgment dated 21.10.2014 passed
by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Chunian.

13. The instant appeal is allowed in the above mentioned terms.
