2. Facts of the case shortly “are that on
06.4.2019 at 09:10 a.m., the complainant Habibullah
(PW-11) with the help of his relatives brought his injured
son Hizbullah (victim / deceased) in semi unconscious
condition to the Emergency Room of Civil Hospital,
D.I.Khan. He reported that at morning time, his son went
to the shop of one Iqbal for purchasing groceries. At about
07:30 a.m., his son-in-law Zubair (PW-7) rushed to his
house and informed him that the victim was fired at. He,
along with PW Zubair, rushed to the spot and saw the
victim besmeared with blood. His injured son informed
him that the appellant Saqib fired at him with his pistol.
The complainant stated that the appellant claimed what he
called to be in love with the victim. For this reason, he
added, the appellant would tease the victim. Further
highlighting the motive, the complainant informed that a
year ago, a complaint was made against the appellant.
However, the matter was patched up. The report of the
complainant was reduced in the shape of a Murasila
(Ex.PW-4/1) which culminated into registration of the
FIR (Ex.PA). Initially, the FIR was registered under
section 324 PPC. Later on the injured succumbed to his

injuries, therefore, section 302 PPC was inserted.

3. After the arrest of the appellant followed by
completion of investigation, challan was submitted
against him. Formal charge was framed to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution
examined fourteen (14) witnesses. At the conclusion of
the prosecution evidence, the appellant was examined
under Section 342 Cr.PC. He professed innocence and
false implication in the case. However, he neither wished
to be examined on oath, nor did he want to produce

evidence in defence. At the end of the trial, the learned
Page - 3 - of 16

trial Court convicted and sentenced the appellant/accused

as mentioned above vide the impugned judgment.

4, We have heard the arguments of the learned
counsel for the parties as well as learned Asstt: A.G.

representing the State and perused the record.

5. According to the initial report of the incident
(Murasila) the complainant Habibullah (PW-11/father of
the victim) was informed by Zubair (PW-7) that the
victim was fired at. The appellant was thus not nominated
in the Murasila as culprit. The ocular account was
furnished by PW-7, 11 and one Shah Nawaz (brother of
the complainant/PW-10). A close reading of the evidence
furnished by these PWs transpires that PW-11 was
informed by PW-7 at his home that the victim was fired
at. PW-11 had sent the victim out for buying some
commodities from the nearby shop of one Muhammad
Iqbal. PW-11 stated in his deposition before the Court that
PW-7 informed him that the appellant fired at the victim.
PW-7, when entered the witness box, did not name the
appellant having fired at the victim, nor was such
information disclosed by the PW-11 in the Murasila, as
noted above. The deposition of PW-7 reveals that at the
relevant time he was present in Shadi Khan Market in the
shop of a Tailor Master when he heard firing. As he came
out of the shop, he saw a crowd of people near the shop of
Iqbal. He found the victim in injured condition lying
across the road. He did not say in his examination-in-chief
that either he asked the victim himself or heard from
someone amongst the people present there that the
appellant fired at him. Rather, he stated that on seeing the
victim in injured condition, he immediately rushed to the
house of the PW-11, where he informed him about the
incident. His testimony further shows that he, along with

PW-11, rushed back to the place of the incident and it was

Ae

Page - 4 - of 16

at that time that he asked the injured victim about the
culprit, at which the latter replied that the appellant fired
at him. PW-10, in his examination-in-chief, said that the
deceased was coming from the shop of Iqbal towards the
road side, when he came at a distance of abut 10/15 paces,
in the meanwhile, from the other side, the appellant armed
with a pistol, came there and fired at him, as a result of
which, he was hit and the appellant ran away from the
place of the incident. He further stated that after seeing
the occurrence, he rushed towards the injured victim
where other people including Zubair (PW-7) also
attracted. His testimony further shows that PW-7 brought
PW-11 to the place of the incident.

6. It is established from the above that: firstly,
PW-11 and PW-7 were not the eye witnesses of the
incident. Secondly, while PW-7 was immediately
attracted to the spot where PW-10 was also present, PW-7
did not ask right at that time, nor did PW-10 inform him
of having seen the appellant while firing at the victim.
Thirdly, while PW-10 mentioned the presence of PW-7,
the latter remained absolutely silent about the presence of
the former. Fourthly, PWs-7 and 11 have contradicted
each other in such a way that PW-11 did not specifically
mention in the Murasila that PW-7 informed him that the
appellant was the culprit. PW-11 made improvement in
examination-in-chief of his deposition that PW-7
informed him in his house that the appellant has fired at
the deceased. PW-7, on the other hand, stated that he
asked the injured victim about the culprit when he was
back to the place of the incident, along with PW-11
(father of the deceased). All the three witnesses (PWs-7,
10 and 11) failed to positively support each other.

7. As stated above, if PW-10 had seen the

appellant having fired at the deceased, why he didn’t

Page - 5 - of 17

inform at least PW-7, let alone other people present there.
The purpose of the presence of the PW-7 near around the
spot in Shadi Khan Market may appear to be somewhat
justified because, as per his version, he was on 28 days
long leave during those days. However, the purpose of
presence of PW-10 is not clear in his statement. So, it is
shrouded in mystery for what purpose he was present
there, He is the real uncle of the deceased (brother of the
complainant). During cross-examination, he was
confronted with his statement recorded under section 161
Cr.PC. He recalled that in his 161 statement, he stated
before the 1.0 that father of the deceased (PW-11) came
back, along with Zubair (P W-7) and other relatives to the
spot. When asked about the presence of PW-7, he replied
that PW-7 had reached to the spot before his arrival there.
As observed above, PW-7 was present at the spot right at
the time of the occurrence but the latter, as noted above,
does not mention that PW-10 was also present and more
so, PW-10 was the eyewitness of the occurrence. In light
of the above discussion, material dents are visible in the
evidence of the prosecution. Firstly, the name of the eye
witness was not mentioned in the Murasila despite the fact
that the complainant came to know about the so called eye
witness—Shah Nawaz (PW-10). In Remat Ullah (2020)!
the name of the eye witness was not disclosed in the first
information report, which the Court considered fatal to the
prosecution. Secondly, the eyewitness did not state the
purpose of his presence on the scene of the incident.
Admittedly, he is the real uncle of the victim. There is no
doubt of his being a highly interested witness. In the
circumstances, possibility of the appellant being falsely
implicated cannot be ruled out. Guidance is derived from
Dalmir (1970),? wherein three eye witnesses were found

to be interested and their evidence not buttressed by

' Rehmat Ullah and another v. The State, (2020 YLR 103 Sindh).
2 Dalmir and another v. The State, (1970 SCMR 840).

Page - 6 - of 17

circumstantial evidence. Thirdly, many people got
attracted to the crime scene but neither anyone amongst
them came forward, nor did the 1.0 bother to examine
anyone as a witness. In a recent case of 20217, a number
of people had attracted to the spot and were present when
a murder was committed, but no one of them came
forward to support the prosecution case. Among others,
this omission was considered by the Court against the
prosecution. Fourthly, it looks quite unnatural on the part
of PW-7 (Zubair) that instead of lifting up the injured
victim for medical treatment, he simply rushed to his
house to inform his father. The factum of unnatural
conduct on the part of prosecution witnesses has been
held fatal umpteen times in numerous pronouncements.
Guidance can be taken from the judgment of the Supreme
Court in Zaheer Sadig case“. Reference may also be made
to the latest cases of Syed Ali Akbar? and Javed Khan’.

8. Yet another aspect worth noting in the
statement of PW-10 is that when the victim then injured
was lifted from the place of the occurrence, he was
initially taken to the P.S. Yarik from where he was shifted
to the hospital. Keeping in view the fact that the injured
victim disclosed to PW-7 that the appellant fired at him, it
follows that the victim in injured condition was in a
position to speak sensibly. The victim should have lodged
the report in P.S. Yarik. According to the statement of Dr.
Hissam-ud-Din (PW-3), when the injured victim was
brought to the hospital, he was found unconscious. It is
also in the evidence that while on the way to the hospital,
some mechanical defect occurred in the private vehicle in

which he was lying. He was thus shifted to another

(2021 YLR 48).

§ Zaheer Sadiq v. Muhammad Ijaz and others, (2017 SCMR 2007).

S Javed Khan v. The State and 2 others, (2023 PCrLJ 17 Peshawar).

Page - 7 - of 17

vehicle. It may be said that on the way to the hospital, the
condition of the injured victim grew from bad to worse,
leading to his unconsciousness and ultimately, his death.
In short, his shifting in the Yarik Police Station was a
proper opportunity for making report. In a 2019 case’, a
victim succumbed to injuries on the spot. A learned
Division Bench of this Court held that the complainant
should have lodged the report in the police station situated
on the way to hospital. The learned Bench read it from the
perspective of delay in lodging the report. The same
aspect is quite relevant in the context of making a direct
report in the shape of dying declaration to involve the

appellant.

9. The appellant was arrested on 06.4.2019, the
day of the occurrence. A .30 bore pistol was shown
recovered from his baithak on his pointation. Inspector
Saghir Gillani, the SHO of P.S. Yarik (PW-13) arrested
the appellant. As per his statement, the appellant made
pointation during what he called ‘cursory interrogation’.
He recovered the pistol vide a memo. In addition to one
Constable Muhammad Imran, a private person Sher
Akbar was cited as a marginal witness to the recovery
memo. The aforesaid Sher Akbar was examined as PW-9.
In his examination-in-chief, he deposed that the appellant
Saqib had murdered his cousin Hizbullah and he was
about to go to D.I.Khan. In the meanwhile, the appellant
in handcuffs was brought by the local police to the place
of the occurrence. The local police asked him to
accompany him to the baithak of the appellant. In his
baithak, the appellant pointed out the place where he had
concealed the .30 bore pistol. He stated that in respect of
the aforesaid pointation, he signed a blank paper. He

deposed that in his presence, nothing was handed over by

7 Qaizar v. Tariq and others, (2019 YLR 2115).

Page - 8 - of 17

the SHO to the ILO. On the request of the prosecution, he
was declared a hostile witness. He was, then, subjected to
cross-examination by the prosecution. Even while under
the cross-examination, he reiterated that he had signed a
blank paper. He was confronted with the recovery memo
on which he admitted his signature as correct. Though, he
declared incorrect a suggestion that he did not sign a
blank paper, in the next breath, he voluntarily stated that
he had signed a blank paper. He also denied a suggestion
that in his presence, the SHO gave to the 1.0 the aforesaid
alleged weapon of offence. In this respect, the deposition
of the DSP Circle Saghir Gillani (PW-13) is also worth
perusal. He, in his examination-in-chief, stated that on
tentative interrogation that the appellant pointed out the
place where he had allegedly concealed the weapon of
offence. When he took the appellant to his baithak, he
further added, a private person namely, Sher Akbar, came
there whom he cited as a marginal witness to the recovery
memo. Thus, it is established that the prosecution failed to
prove the recovery of weapon of offence. The above
appraisal of evidence led us to conclude that the recovery
of the weapon of offence is highly doubtful. In these
circumstances, the recovery has become inconsequential
especially when the ocular account has been disbelieved.
Reference may be made to cases of Zahid Mehmood’,
Muhammad Hanif alias Fouji? and Mst. Zarina’®. The
case of Agil Zaman alias Ageel,"' a recent one, is also
worth referring, wherein it was observed:

Even otherwise when ocular
account has been disbelieved, the
recovery and the expert report
however strong may be cannot be
a base for recording conviction.

10. The appellant made confession before the
Judicial Magistrate-I, D.I.Khan (PW-12). The order dated
08.4.2019 of the Judicial Magistrate shows that the
appellant was handed over to the Naib Court for sending
him to the judicial lock-up. In this respect, statement of
Sub-Inspector Azad/l.0 (PW-6) is worth perusal. He
partially investigated the case. The record shows that he
produced the appellant before the Judicial Magistrate for
recording his confessional statement. While under cross-
examination, he was asked as in which vehicle he took the
appellant to the Court of the Judicial Magistrate, for how
long he was stayed there and who took him to the judicial
lock after making the confessional statement. He tendered

his replies in the following words:

I produced the accused before the
competent Court for recording his
confessional statement through
official vehicle and it took about
an hour. I cannot tell exact time
when we reached the Court of
learned Magistrate. The accused
was handed over to me after 12
(ag minutes of our production of the
ce accused before the Court. The
accused had confessed his guilt
before the Court. The photocopy
of the confessional statement was
annexed with the judicial file.
Usually, it took 15-20 minutes in
shifting the accused from the
Court of JM to Jail. In the instant
case, we also spent about same
time while shifting the accused
from the Court of Magistrate to
Central Jail, D..Khan in the
company of 3-officials excluding
me.

From the above statement, it appears that the appellant
was handed over to PW-6 after recording his confessional
statement. It further reflects from the above statement that

the appellant was handed over to him after 12 minutes of

Page - 10 - of 16

his production before the Judicial Magistrate. He stated
that three other police officials accompanying him, shifted
the appellant to judicial lock-up after recording
confessional statement. The above referred replies
materially contradict the statement of the Judicial
Magistrate (PW-12), his order dated 08.4.2019 pertaining
to the judicial remand and the certificate he issued in
respect of the confessional statement. The certificate
shows that the appellant was produced before the Judicial
Magistrate at 01:30 p.m., he gave 30 minutes time to the
appellant for thinking over his decision to make
confessional statement, he started recording confessional
statement at 02:00 p.m. and finished it at 02:15 p.m. The
Judicial Magistrate, when entered the witness box,
admitted during cross-examination that in the application
submitted to him by the I. he got the appellant examined
from an authorized Medical Officer before recording of
the confessional statement. When asked, he could not tell
the exact time he consumed while explaining the
questionnaire to the appellant. He rather furnished a
general reply stating that sufficient time was consumed.
The appellant stated in his confessional statement that on
the day of the occurrence, he had used intoxicating drugs
and that while committing the offence he was under the
influence of the said drugs. The Judicial Magistrate was
asked about the intoxicating effect on him, to which he
replied in the negative. He denied a suggestion that he
spent 10 to 15 minutes in completing the whole
proceedings of recording of confession. He deposed that
he had granted one day physical custody of the appellant
to the LO.

11. When the appellant disclosed in his
confessional statement the fact that he was under the

influence of some intoxicating drugs at the time of the

Page - 11 - of 17

occurrence, the Judicial Magistrate should have found out
whether this fact was noted or, so to say, stated by the
appellant to the arresting police officer or the same police
officer himself came to know that he was intoxicated. In
his statement under section 342 Cr.PC, the appellant
retracted from his confession. In reply to question No.18,
he stated:

I never confessed anything before

any Court. I was produced before

the Court by the SHO and the 1.0

and after view minutes I was

handed over back to the same

police officer who managed to

shift me to the judicial lock-up.
The Judicial Magistrate was not cross-examined on this
aspect of the confessional statement and from his order
dated 08.4.2019, it is clear that he had handed over the
appellant to the Naib Court for his onward transmission to
the judicial lock-up. It is nevertheless very much clear
that the appellant somehow or the other was again given
into the hands of the I.0. We observe that the Judicial
Magistrate could not be blamed for this. However, as
discussed with reference to the statement of PW-6, it is
quite clear that the I.O managed to get back the appellant
into his control and custody. Thus, the police high-
handedness is apparent from the evidence, which has a
material bearing on the voluntariness of the appellant.
Here, it is imperative to state that when the very
voluntariness of a confessional statement becomes a
begging question and when ocular account is also
disbelieved then in the absence of any other confidence
inspiring evidence, it would not be safe to make such a
confessional statement a base for conviction. Reliance is
placed on Hashim Qasim case,'? wherein the Supreme

Court observed:

2 Hashim Qasim and another v. The State, (2017 SCMR 986).

Page - 12 - of 16

12. It is trite law that for accepting
a confession, two essential
requirements must be fulfilled i.e.
that_the confession was made
voluntarily, it was based on true
account of facts, leading to the
crime and the same was proved at
the trial. The superior courts have
also given strict guidelines for the
Magistrate, recording confession,
to be followed without any
exception which need not be
repeated herein, because long line
of authorities on this point is
already in the field.

Similarly, in the earlier case of Azeem Khan’, the
Supreme Court held:

14. The judicial confessions,
allegedly made by both the
appellants are the material piece
of evidence in the prosecution
hand, therefore, we would deal

A with the same in the first instance.
CS.

15. Keeping in view the High

< Court Rules, laying down a

\e binding procedure for taking

required precautions and

observing the requirements of the
provision of section 364 read with
section 164, Cr.P.C. by now it has
become a trite law that before
recording confession and that too
in crimes entailing capital
punishment, the Recording
Magistrate has to essentially
observe all these mandatory
precautions. The fundamental
logic behind the same is that, all
signs of fear inculcated by the
Investigating Agency in the mind
of the accused are to be shedded
out and he is to be provided full

3 4zeem Khan and another v. Mujahid Khan and others, (2016 SCMR 274).

Page - 13 - of 16

assurance that in case he is not
guilty or is not making a
confession voluntarily then in that
case, he would not be handed over
back to the police. Thereafter,
sufficient time for reflection is to
be given after the first warning is
administered. At the expiry of that
time, Recording Magistrate has to
administer the second warning
and the accused shall be assured
that now he was in the safe hands.
All police officials whether in
uniform or otherwise, including
Naib Court attached to the Court
must be kept outside the Court
and beyond the view of the
accused. After observing all these
legal requirements if the accused
person is willing to confess, then
all required questions formulated
by the High Court Rules should
be put to him and the answers
given, be recorded in the words
spoken by him. The statement of
accused be recorded by the
Magistrate with his own hand and
in case there is a genuine
compelling reason then, a special
note is to be given that the same
was dictated to a responsible
official of the Court like
Stenographer or Reader and oath
shall also be administered to such
official that he would correctly
type or write the true and correct
version, the accused stated and
dictated by the Magistrate. In
case, the accused is illiterate, the
confession he makes, if recorded
in another language i.e. Urdu or
English then, after its completion,
the same be read-over and
explained to him in the language,
the accused fully understand and
thereafter a certificate, as required

under section 364, Cr.P.C. with
regard to these proceedings be
given by the Magistrate under his
seal and signatures and the

accused shall be sent to jail on
judicial remand and during this
process at no occasion he shall be
handed over to any police
official/officer whether he is Naib
Court wearing police uniform, or
any other police official/officer.
because such careless

dispensation would considerably
diminish the voluntary_nature of

the confession. made by the
accused.

[...]

18. In our considered view, the
confessions of both the appellants
for the above reasons are of no
legal worth, to be relied upon and
are excluded from consideration,
more so, when these were
retracted at the trial. Confessions
of this nature, which were
retracted by the appellants, cannot
mutually corroborate each other
on the principle that one tainted
evidence cannot corroborate the
other tainted piece of evidence.
Similar_view was taken by this
Court in the case of Muhammad
Bakhsh v. The State (PLD 1956
SC_420). while in the case of
Khuda Bux v. The Crown (1969
SCMR 390) the confession made,
was held not voluntary because
the accused _in_ that case was
remanded back to the police after
making confession.

em

Even then if, for the sake of arguments, the confessional
statement is considered as true and voluntary, reliance on

it alone for conviction would not be possible. In other
Page - 15 - of 16

words, the remaining evidence such as ocular account and
the recovery of the weapon of offence have already
created material dents in the prosecution case which do

not substantiate the confessional statement.

12. We may touch upon the motive. In support
of the motive, the prosecution examined Akbar Ali Jan, an
THC of police station Cantt (CW-2), who produced copy
of an application submitted by the complainant to the
SHO on 22.3.2018. In the application, the complainant
voiced his grievance that the appellant was teasing the
victim when the latter goes to school. CW-2 deposed that
the application was assigned to him for consideration. He
stated that he was able to resolve the issue due to which
the complainant didn’t pursue the matter. To this effect,
he recorded a statement in the police station in the
presence of witnesses. Sher Akbar (PW-9) was one of the
witnesses of that statement. He remained silent on the
motive. Other witnesses were not produced. Despite all
this, motive as a double-edged weapon, could be used
either way. Where charge is not proved, it will strike at
the prosecution case. In the circumstances of the case
even if the motive is believed to be true, it also cannot be

considered sufficient proof of the charge.

13. It is of paramount importance to mention
that under the criminal administration of justice, the
benefit of every doubt arising out of the prosecution case
has to be resolved in favour of a person accused of a
criminal charge. The absolute principle of criminal
jurisprudence that prosecution and prosecution alone has
to prove its case against an accused beyond any
reasonable shadow of doubt. The benefit of every
inconsistency, loophole or contradiction which pricks the
judicious mind must be extended to the accused, not as a

matter of grace or concession, but as of right. Reliance is

Page - 16 - of 16

placed on the latest case of Ahmed Ali’? wherein the

Supreme Court held:

Even otherwise, it is well settled
that for the purposes of
extending the benefit of doubt to
an accused, it is not necessary
that there be multiple infirmities
in the prosecution case or several
circumstances creating doubt. A
single or slightest doubt, if found
reasonable, in the prosecution
case would be sufficient to
entitle the accused to its benefit,
not as a matter of grace and
concession but as a matter of
right.

14. For the foregoing reasons, this Court is of
the considered view that the prosecution has miserably
failed to prove its case against the appellant. Therefore,
this appeal succeeds and is allowed. Consequently, the
conviction and the sentence awarded by the learned trial
Court, vide impugned judgment, dated 27.02.2023, are set
aside and the appellant is acquitted of the charge while
extending him the benefit of doubt. He shall be released

forthwith if not required in any other custody case.

15. The above are the detailed reasons for our
short order of even date. i
