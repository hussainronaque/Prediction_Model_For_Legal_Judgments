DR. KHURSHID _JIOBAL, J.--- The respondent (Aqil
Muhammad), was tried by Additional Sessions Judge-V/Judge
Special Court, Bannu, for the offence under section 9(c) of the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 2019
(the Act 2019) read with 15-AA in case FIR No.599 dated
18.05.2022 of Police Station Kakki, District Bannu. He was
acquitted of the charges vide judgment dated 13.10.2022.

2. Facts, shortly, are that on 18.05.2022 at 10:00 hours,
complainant Asmat Ullah Khan, PASI, along with a police
contingent was present on duty. Meanwhile, he received spy
information regarding trafficking of narcotics by the
respondent-accused from Gambali. In response, he laid
barricade at the spot. After some time, the respondent-accused
reached there with a plastic shopper in his hand. He was
stopped and searched. Charas weighing 1025 grams were
recovered from the plastic bag. A .30 bore pistol with fit

magazine containing 05 live rounds was also recovered from
-2-

the fold of his trouser, regarding which no license was produced
on the spot. The contraband along with the pistol was taken into
possession vide recovery memo Ex.PW-2/1. The respondent-
accused was arrested and murasila was drafted, which was

converted in the shape of FIR.

3. After completion of investigation, challan was put for
trial against the respondent. Copies were supplied to him under
section 265-C Cr.P.C. Charge was framed against him, to which
he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution
examined a total of 07 witnesses and then closed its evidence.
The respondent recorded his statement under section 342
Cr.P.C, in which he denied all the allegations leveled against
him and professed innocence. However, he didn’t avail the
opportunity to record evidence in defence or to give statement
on oath within the meaning of section 340(2) Cr.P.C. The
learned trial Court after hearing arguments, acquitted the
respondent of the charges vide impugned judgment dated
13.10.2022. Hence, this appeal.

4. Arguments of Hafiz Muhammad Hanif, A.A.G for the
State, heard and record gone through.

5. The prosecution case is that the seizing officer received
spy information regarding trafficking of contraband by the
respondent-accused. In response, a barricade was laid where the
respondent-accused was caught red handed with 1025 grams of
Charas and an unlicensed pistol. The seizing officer being one
of the star witnesses was examined as PW-02. In his cross-
examination, he admitted that the spy information was received
at about 11:00 a.m. The time of the occurrence was shown as
09:40 a.m. So, when the occurrence had already taken place at

09:40 a.m, then how the information regarding involvement of
-3-

the respondent-accused in commission of the offence was
received to the seizing officer at 11:00 a.m. On the one hand,
the seizing officer was of the view that the respondent-accused
was trafficking contraband, whereas, on the other, he claimed
that the respondent-accused was busy in selling charas and that
a customer was also present with him. This stance of the seizing
officer is not only self-contradictory, but also negates what he
has mentioned in the FIR. PW-03 deposed that none told the
police contingent regarding selling of the narcotics by the
respondent-accused, yet the seizing officer claimed that he was
selling charas at the time of recovery. The marginal witness
(PW-02) not only contradicted the testimony of the seizing
officer, but also the contents of the FIR. The total quantity
shown recovered was 1025 grams, while the marginal witness
claimed it in his cross examination as 150/240 grams. Though,
the contradiction was termed a mistake by the Additional
Advocate General. However, the record is silent regarding any
application made by the prosecution for correction. In the
circumstances, the contention of the Additional Advocate
General holds no water. The marginal witness (PW-03) even
shown ignorance as far as the place of the recovery is
concemed. Needless to say, the marginal witnesses being
present on the spot are supposed to be aware of all the material
aspects of the case. However, in the case in hand, the marginal
witnesses even failed either to disclose the exact quantity
shown as recovered or the place of recovery. Again, the seizing
officer and the investigating officer are in conflict as regards the
time period which they spent together in connection with
completion of investigation. The former disclosed the time as

two hours, whereas, the latter as one hour.

6. The recovery was shown as having effected on
-4-

18.05.2022. But the sample separated from it, was sent to the
FSL on 24.05.2022. Thus, there is a delay of about 06 days in
sending the representative sample to the FSL. Relevant in this
regard is Rule 4(2) of the Control of Narcotic Substances
(Government Analysts) Rules, 2001, which provides for the
completion of such exercise within 72 hours of the recovery.
The delay caused has not been plausibly explained, so keeping
it in juxtaposition with the aforementioned facts and
circumstances, the same could be considered as fatal to the

prosecution case. This Court in the case of “State through

Advocate-General Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar Vs Javed
Iqbal” (2021 YLR 662 Peshawar) has held that:

“Tt is also an admitted fact that
recovery of contraband was made on
18.01.2008, the application for
sending the samples to chemical
examiner was drawn and handed
over to Asif constable (PW-5) on the
same day as admitted by him in his
cross-examination, however, it was
taken by hand in Forensic Science

Laboratory, Peshawar on 23.01.2008,
4 no reason what so ever was given by
the said prosecution witness for

retaining the samples with him for a

period of five (05) days, therefore,
the delay in taking the sample to the
laboratory is another important
defect in the prosecution case and
there is nothing on record to show
that the samples of chars remained in
safe custody during intervening
period. (i.e. 18.01.2008 to
23.01.2008) which makes the FSL
report highly doubtful and any doubt
arises in the links of the chain of
prosecution story, the benefit of the
same must go to the accused.”

7. As far as the recovery of pistol is concerned, suffice it to
-5-

say that it was effected in a populous area, but none from the
general public present was cited as a witness. Though, the
police officials are as good witnesses as others, but when
private persons were available, then an attempt should have
been made to ensure fair and transparency. Moreover, no arms
expert report was brought on record to confirm the working
condition of the weapon. Keeping in view this aspect of the
case vis-a-vis the contradictions and inconsistencies noted
above, we are clear in our mind that the prosecution has badly
failed to prove the charge against the respondent-accused

beyond any reasonable doubt.

8. It is well settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that
prosecution has to prove its case the person accused beyond
reasonable of doubt and if any inconsistency, loophole or
contradiction arises in the prosecution case, then its benefit has
to be extended to the accused, not as a matter of grace or
concession, but as of right. In case titled “Ahmed Ali and
another Vs The State” (2023 SCMR 781), it was held that:

“Even otherwise, it is well settled
that for the purposes of extending the

ly benefit of doubt to an accused, it is
not necessary that there be multiple
infirmities in the prosecution case or
several circumstances creating doubt.
A single or slightest doubt, if found
reasonable, in the prosecution case
would be sufficient to entitle the
accused to its benefit, not as a matter
of grace and concession but as a
matter of right.”

9. In the case of “State Vs Ahmed Omar Sheikh” (2021
SCMR_ 873), the apex Court held that the parameters to deal

with an appeal against conviction and an appeal against

acquittal are totally different. The reason is that acquittal carries
my -6-

double presumption of innocence and the same could be
reversed only when found blatantly perverse, illegal, arbitrary,
capricious or speculative, shocking or rested upon
impossibility. If there is a possibility of a contrary view, even
then acquittal could not be set aside. As on one hand, the
prosecution has badly failed to prove the charge against
respondent-accused, whereas, on the other, nothing as such
could be pointed out to prove that the impugned judgment is
perverse, illegal or arbitrary. The learned trial Court after
evaluating the entire record has taken into consideration all the
crucial aspects of the case and has arrived at a correct and just
conclusion that the prosecution case is doubtful and it does not

inspire confidence to support the charge.

10. For the above reasons, this criminal appeal is found

bereft of any merit. The same is, therefore, dismissed in /imine.
