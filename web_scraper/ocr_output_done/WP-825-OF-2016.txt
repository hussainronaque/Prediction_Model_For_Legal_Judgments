2. Brief and essential facts of the case are that
casc FIR No. 68 dated: 09.05.2016 under section
302/324/148/149 PPC at Police Station Banna Allai,
was registered by the petitioner against respondents

No. 6 and others.

3. It was reported by the petitioner that he along
with Fazal Ghafar (deceased) Ilyas Khan Durrani, and
Khanzada “Complainant Party” when reached at their
land near Mosuma Adda, Gohar Ali son of Sher Ali
respondent No. 6,  Gullu Kohistani, © Chappu
Kohistani along with scven others “Accused” armed
with weapons asked the Complainant Party — that
Accused, under the instructions of Professor Mukhtiar
Ali, directing the Complainant Party not to use the
thoroughfare/pedestrian track and if the Complainant
Party did not return back, the Accused will open fire

at them. During this time accused Gohar Ali opened

esnfixe at aval Ghafar (deceased), resultantly Fazal

Ghafar sustained firearm injury on his face from
Gohar Ali and another fire injury from Gulla, which
causcd his death. The accused surrounded the

Complainant Party and started indiscriminate firing.

4. At the time of registration of case, since
petitioner was already nominated in FIR No. 67 by
Muhammad Khan for firing at him, was arrested by
police. The place of occurrence and dispute has been

the use of thoroughfare in both the FIRs.

5. The perusal of medical report/autopsy of the
deceased [’azal Ghafar shows that deceased had
received entry wound on his mouth with an exit entry
and another entry and exit at the right deltoid muscle
region. It was further alleged that the occurrence was

also seen by the brother of Complainant.

6. On 23.05.2016, respondent No. 6 was
granted ad-interim bail before arrest by learned

Additional Sessions Judge.

7. Respondent No. 6 pleaded his
053,

innocence before the investigation officer and also

raiscd plea of Alibi. The investigation officer recorded
statements of various persons in support of the plca of
Alibi of the accused/respondents.' The investigation
officer found the Respondent No 6 innocent while
belicving his plea of defense qua other cvidence

collected by him during the course of investigation.

8. Not contended with the mode and
manner of investigation of local police, the present
petitioner filed an application to the compctent
authority for transfer of investigation. The said
request was ‘acceded to and investigation was
transferred to crime branch. Crime branch also
concurred with the investigation of the local police.
On 04.06.2016 investigation officer solicited the
opinion from the office of District Public Prosecutor
for deferment of arrest of respondent No. 6. [lowever,
the office of District Public Prosecutor did not give
any opinion as the application for bail before arrest

was pending before the competent court.

prosecution cvidence qua the defense . witnesses,

belicved the defense version and declared
Respondent No 6 innocent and accepted bails bonds
Va from respondent No. 6 on 6-6-2015 purportedly
under section 169 Cr. P.C, despite the fact that
respondent No. 6 was not in his custody. However,

while preparing the final investigation report under

section 173 Cr.P.C he did not mention the factum of
releasing Respondent No 6 on his personal bond. In
the said report he has stated to have deferred the-arrest

of respondent No 6 being innocent.

10. The learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the petitioner has stated that the
investigation officer has illegally allowed release of
respondent No. 6 against submitting bail bonds to the
investigation officer and further — stated _ that
investigation officer had no mandate under section
169 Cr. P.C to accept bail bond from respondent No.
6. On the other hand Icarned counsel appcaring on
behalf of respondent No. 6 stated that the findings of
investigation office are factually correct and _ this
Court has no jurisdiction to interfere in the

investigation of police.

11. Arguments heard and record perused.

12. Admittedly the respondent No. 6 has
been directly charged by the petitioner for the murder
of Abdul Ghafar (deccased) and the presence of
Complainant at the spot is further established by

registration of FIR No. 67, wherein, Muhammad

Khan has charged the petitioner/complainant for

firing at him.

13. Although, the investigation officer has
f
the mandate to uncarth the truth and collect the entire

evidence relating to the occurrence and provide the

investigation report in terms of section 173 of Cr.

P.C and also to state his opinion on the case, -

however, he has no authority to arrogate to himself
the role, and the function of adjudicating and to
evaluate the evidence of prosecution viz-a-viz that of
defense. However, the core issuc before us is as to
whether the investigation officer has rightly accepted
bail bonds from respondent No. 6 under section 169
of Cr. P.C. For sake of convenicncc, section 169
Cr.P.C is reproduced as under:-

Release of accused when cvidence

deficient: If, upon an investigation
under this Chapter, it appears to the
officer Incharge of police station, or to
the police officer making the
investigation that there is not sufficient
evidence or reasonable ground or
suspicion to justify the forwarding of the
accused to the Magistrate, such officer
shall, if such person is in custody, release

him on his executing a bond, with or

without sureties, as such officer may
direct, to appear, if and when sO
required, before a Magistrate
empowered to take cognizance of the
offence on a police report and to try the

accused or (send) him for trial.

The bare perusal of section 169 ibid lays down the
following circumstances for release of accused on
bonds ( personal or with sureties);

(i). That the evidence is insufficient or
there are reasonable grounds of suspicion to justify
the forwarding the accused to the Magistrate.

(ii) Insufficiency of evidence means inadequate
evidence to prove or support a finding.

(iii) the Investigation officer has no authority to

evaluate the evidence of prosecution viz-a-viz of

defense
(iv). The accused has to be in custody.
15. In the present case admittedly the

investigation officer while accepting the bail bond
from respondent No. 6, respondent No. 6 was not in
his custody. Furthermore, under section 173 of
Cr.P.C the investigation officer is required to state in
the said report, if the accused is released on bond
with or without sureties, apprising the magistrate of
such bond so that the Magistrate can pass order on

such bonds under section 173 (3) Cr.P.C. ‘The

investigation officer has prepared complete challan in
the present case, wherein the factum of release of the
accused on personal bond has not been stated, instead
it has been mentioned that the arrest of the
Respondent No 6 has been deferred. IIence, the
releasing of respondent No. 6 on bond when he was

not in custody is illegal and without lawful authority.

16. rom the aforesaid facts and law on
subject, we hold that the impugned action of the
investigation officer is arbitrary and has transgressed
and travelled beyond the scope of his jurisdiction
under section 169 Cr.P.C. The investigation officer
had no authority to arrogate to himsclf the function of
adjudication and do determine the nature of offence

and to give pre-trial verdict of innocence of accused.
