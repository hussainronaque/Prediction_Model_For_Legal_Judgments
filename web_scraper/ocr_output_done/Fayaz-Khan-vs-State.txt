2. Through the instant appeal, convicts Fayaz Khan

and Naseeb Khan and through connected Cr.A.
No.699-P/2011, convict Aslam Khan, have questioned
their conviction and sentences, whereas, complainant-
injured Halwadar Khan has filed Cr.R. No.25-P/2017,
seeking enhancement of sentences of the
convicts/respondents from life imprisonment to normal
penalty of death as provided for the offence.

3. Since, all the three matters are emanating from one
and the same judgment of the learned trial Court dated
13.10.2011; therefore, we propose to decide the same
through this single judgment.

4. The prosecution case as unfolded in First
Information Report (“FIR”) is that on 29.03.2009 at 2115
hours, complainant, namely, Hawaldar, a police Constable
(PW.3) reported to Saleem Khan S.J. (PW.8) in District
Headquarter (DHQ) hospital Noshera Kalan to the effect
that on the fateful night he and Constable Iqbal Jadoon
deceased, were on rider duty in ASC Colony, Nowshera.
At 2020 hours, they came across three young persons of
middle height duly clad/covered in shawls “Chadar’’ at
double road ASC Colony. No sooner, they commanded
them to stop, they (the three persons) opened fire at them

with their respective pistols, as a result, Constable Iqbal
Jadoon got hit and died at the spot, whereas he
(complainant) sustained firearm injuries. According to his
report, he can identify the three culprits, if brought before
him. Muhammad Saleem S.I (PW.8) recorded his report in
the shape of Murasila Exhs.PA/1 and prepared his injury
sheet Exh.PW.PM/2. He also prepared injury sheet and
inquest report Exh.PW.8/1 and Exh.PW.8/2, respectively,
of the deceased. He referred the injured to Medical officer
for examination and shifted the dead body to the mortuary
for postmortem examination. Dr. Abdul Jalil (PW.1)
conducted autopsy on the dead body of Iqbal Jadoon
deceased on 29.03.2009 at 8.55 p.m. He also examined the
injured complainant on the same date and time.

5. The task of investigation was handed over to Swab
Gul S.I. (PW.9), who proceeded to the spot and prepared
site plan Exh.PB. During spot inspection, he recovered 06
empties of 30 bore Exh.P.1, a spent bullet Exh.P.2, a
splinter of spent bullet Exh.P.3 and bloodstained pebbles
from the places of the deceased and injured, in presence of
witnesses vide recovery memo Exhs.PC. Vide recovery
memo Exh.PC/1 he took into possession the last worn
bloodstained uniform of deceased constable Iqbal Jadoon
having cut and bullet marks and bloodstained police
uniform of injured Hawaldar in presence of witnesses.
Similarly, vide recovery memo Exh.PC/2 he took into

possession 05 empties of 7.62 bore from the spot lying in
scattered condition. Through recovery memo Exh.PC/3 he
took into possession official motorcycle 125 Exh.P.17 on
which at the time of occurrence injured and the deceased
were riding/performing their duties. Remaining
investigation was conducted by Shakeel DSP (PW.10),
who on 04.04.2009, recorded statements of one Gul
Malook Khan a watchman (chowkidar) in the vicinity of
the place of occurrence and Gul Said under section 161
Cr.P.C. On 10.04.2009, the appellants were arrested by
Manzoor Khan SHO Police Station Nowshera Cantt and
were handed over to (PW.10), who obtained their two days
physical remand. During interrogation, appellant Fayaz led
the police to the place where he had kept his cloths and
chappal Exh.P.20, P.21 and P.22, worn by him at the time
of occurrence, which PW.10 took into possession vide
pointation/recovery memo  Exh.PW.10/7. On _ joint
pointation of all the appellants, the shawls (chadar) worn
by them at the time of occurrence were also recovered and
taken into possession vide recovery memo Exh.PC/3. The
30 bore pistol Exh.P.15 used by appellant Fayaz in the
instant case was recovered from him by the Seizing Officer
in case FIR No.291 PS Noshera Cantt, and the same was
handed over to PW.10 which he took into possession vide
recovery memo Exh.PC/6. Similarly, vide recovery memo
Exh.PC/6 he also took into possession 30 bore pistols

recovered from appellant Aslam and Naseeb in the
aforesaid FIR. He recorded statements of the PWs, placed
on file the FSL report Exh.PZ and _ application
Exh.PW.10/8 for identification parade of the appellants.

6. On 12.04.2009, injured complainant Hawaldar
recorded his statement under section 164 Cr.P.C. wherein
he charged the appellants for commission of the offence.

7. On completion of investigation, challan was
submitted against the appellant before the learned Anti-
Terrorism Court, where on the application of defence, the
case was transferred to the Court of learned Sessions
Judge, Nowshera vide order dated 09.02.2010 for trial of
the appellants. The above said order was assailed by the
complainant before this Court in Writ Petition
No.858/2010, which was allowed, consequently, the case
was remanded to the learned Anti-Terrorism Court, with
the direction that the question of jurisdiction be decided
after recording evidence of the prosecution. On conclusion
of trial, the learned Anti-Terrorism Court once again
transferred the case to the Sessions Judge, Nowshera, vide
order dated 28.06.2011, where fresh charge was framed
against the appellants and fresh trial commenced, but
learned counsel for the parties agreed to rely on the
evidence already recorded before the learned Anti-
Terrorism Court, hence, learned counsel for the parties

were heard and vide impugned judgment, the appellants
were convicted and sentenced, as mentioned in Para No.1
of the judgment, hence, these appeals and revision.

8. We have heard the exhaustive arguments of
learned counsel for the parties except counsel for appellant
Aslam who did not turn up despite service and date by
court. We have also perused the record, available evidence
and the impugned judgment of the learned trial Court.

9. Ocular account of the occurrence has been
furnished by injured complainant Hawaldar Khan (PW.3).
In his initial report he charged three unknown culprits,
without disclosing their features, however, described them
covered with shawl (Chadar). He while appearing as PW.3,
to some extent reiterated the same story set forth by him in
his initial report Exh.PA/1, however, he introduced certain
new events which do not find mention in his initial report
such as “that at the time of occurrence they were riding
on a motorbike which was being driven by Iqbal
Jadoon deceased and he was sitting behind him. Iqbal
Jadoon deceased told him that they would spend some
time in the ASC Colony because there were complaints
of theft and dacoity by gangs. I also made fire in myself
defence with my official Kalashnikov. Two accused
decamped/escaped towards southern side while one fled
away towards street”. In his initial report he has not
disclosed the aforesaid circumstances and this factum has

been admitted by him in his cross examination. He
deposed that the above mentioned circumstances/events
were disclosed by him in his supplementary statement
recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C. on 12.04.2009 i.e. after
a delay of more than 12/13 days of the occurrence as well
as after arrest of the appellants on 10.04.2009. It appears
from daily diary No.39 dated 10.04.2019 that Manzoor
Hussain SHO on 10.04.2009 at 1800 hours, on receipt of
spy information about presence of the appellants in a
ravine (khwar/Algadda) of Madina Colony, Nowshera,
along with other police officials rushed to the spot and
arrested the appellants. He allegedly recovered a 30 bore
pistol from folding of each of the appellants. The daily
diary (ibid) was sent to Police Station Nowshera Kalan for
registration of case under section 13 West Pakistan Arms
Ordinance against the appellants, however, record is silent
about registration of FIR on 10.04.2019 against the
appellants on the said daily diary. Neither in initial report
Exh.PA nor in supplementary statement, the injured
complainant has stated a single word as to how and by
whom he and the dead body of the deceased were shifted
to the hospital. In the supplementary statement he has also
not disclosed the source of information on the basis of
which he got satisfied about complicity of the appellants in
the commission of offence. No doubt, identification parade
of the appellants has been conducted through him but on

one hand, it has been conducted on 20.04.2009 i.e. on the
10" day of arrest of the appellants and on the other hand,
by then the appellants were already nominated by the
complainant in his supplementary statement recorded on
12.04.2019 by Investigating Officer Shakeel Khan
(PW.10). Besides, the factum of joint identification parade
of the appellants has been admitted by the complainant in
his cross-examination by deposing that all the three
appellant were standing in one row along with other
dummies 15/20 in number at the time of identification
parade. Similarly, the fact of joint identification parade of
the appellants has also been admitted by Muhammad Inam
Ullah Judicial Magistrate (PW.2), who had conducted
identification parade in sub-jail Nowshera.

10. During investigation one Malook and Gul Said
were introduced as Chowkidar in the vicinity of the place
of occurrence. The former had seen two persons wearing
black and grey clothes decamping from the spot. The latter
has been abandoned while the former has been examined
as (PW.4). Statement under section 161 Cr.P.C. of the said
Malook Khan had been recorded by the I.0. on 04.04.2009
i.e. after six days of the occurrence. He while appearing as
PW.4 deposed that:-

“T am working as Chokidar in plot situated at ASC colony.
I used to reside there in a room even at night time. I used
to be armed. On the night of occurrence at 8.00/8.30 p.m.

I heard report of fire shot. | woke up and sat in my
Charpai. | noticed that one/two persons were running an
they came across me, one was having grey clothes and the
other was having black colour clothes. The person who
was wearing grey clothes was having small beard and was
holding a rifle in his hand. | flashed the torch and saw
the person wearing black clothes was not moving
smooth. He was being obstructed by bushes, in fact he was
dwindling whereas the person in grey clothes was running
smoothly. I also made a few fire with my Kalashnikov
to scare the accused. I suspected them to be thieves. Later
on, I came to know that two police officials were shot. My
statement under section 161 Cr.P.C. was recorded in
which I have stated that whenever accused came before
me I can identify them. I was summoned to jail where I
identified two of the accused before the Magistrate and
superintendent of Jail, Peshawar”. (Bold and underlines
are for emphasis).

11. As per FIR, the occurrence has taken place on
29.03.2009, whereas statement of Malook Khan (PW.4)
under section 161 Cr.P.C. has been recorded by the I.O. on
04.04.2009. Record suggests that on the night of
occurrence Swab Gul SI (PW.9) proceeded to the spot,
prepared site plan and effected recoveries from the spot,
but he did not found PW Malook Khan there, however,
after six days, PW Malook emerged and recorded his
statement without giving any explanation as to why he
remained mum till 04.04.2009. Similarly, the I.Os of the

case has also not bothered to furnish any explanation as to
10

why PW Malook was not examined on the very first day of
the occurrence. Statedly, PW Malook Khan was
Chowkidar in Plot situated at ASC Colony, but hesitantly
he did not disclose the name of owner of the Plot nor
furnished any information about his master. No other
person from the vicinity of the crime spot has been
produced to substantiate that PW Malook was serving as
Chokidar near the spot during the days of occurrence. No
empty of the fire shots allegedly made by PW Malook
Khan has been taken into possession by the I.O. nor have
ever been produced by PW Malook Khan to the I.Os. In
cross-examination PW Malook Khan deposed that the
distance between him and the accused was about 2/3 paces
when he noticed them. He further deposed that when he
made fire on the culprits they were at a distance of 150
paces from him. This part of statement of PW Malook
Khan is also unbelievable, because if the three culprits
were so desperate and dangerous that they could not be
searched by police officer, rather they opened fire at the
police, then how an ordinary man would be so courageous
to dare putting flash light on their faces, in such a
foolhardy occasion. The culprits, whose hands were
coloured with the blood of police officials, would not have
spared PW Malook Khan. Surely PW Malook is neither an
eyewitness of the occurrence nor was in the know of firing

by the culprits on police officials, rather, as per his
11

statement at the crucial time he was sleeping and on report
of fire shot woke up and sat in his Charpai. He is also not
sure as to whether he saw one or two persons running and
came across him. According to his assertion, he noticed
one/or two persons from a distance of 2/3 paces and in
flesh light of his torch saw that person wearing black
clothes was not moving smoothly, while the other one
wearing grey clothes having small beard was carrying rifle
in his hand. In the initial report, the injured complainant
has categorically mentioned pistols in the hands of the
culprits on which they committed the crime. Not a single
word has been mentioned by the complainant about any
rifle in possession of the culprits. Since, 5 empties of 7.62
bore have also been shown recovered from the spot,
therefore, PW Malook in order to bring his testimony in
line with the spot position, stated about rifle in hand of one
of the culprits. The entire story fetched up by PW Malook
is neither believable nor appealable to a prudent mind.
Sparing of Chowkidar by the desperate vagabonds, who
purportedly have committed murder of a police official,
particularly, in a situation when the Chowkidar flashed his
torch on their faces from a distance of two/three paces, is
unbelievable and improbable. Neither the alleged torch
was produced by PW Malook to the I.O nor has the
prosecution bothered to make demand for its production,

which led one to draw inference that neither PW Malook
12

was present in the vicinity of the spot nor was he having
torch in his possession, rather his own statement is
sufficient to falsify and distort his fictional presence near
the spot. Moreso, in view of the above observations
question as to whether Malook was present near the place
of occurrence as Chowkidar, made fire from his
Kalashnikovs at the culprits and noticed two persons in
torch light, has remained shrouded in mystery, hence, his
evidence is not credible or worthy of credence. This PW
also has also admitted in his statement that he identified
the appellants in a joint identification parde conducted
inside the jail by the Judicial Magistrate.

12. Supplementary statement of complainant Hawaldar
and statement under S.161, Cr.P.C. of PW Malook Khan
being recorded after sufficient delay without any tangible
and plausible explanation, must vanish its sanctity, and
would not be held confidence inspiring.

13. Similarly, joint identification parade of the
appellants through the PWs (complainant and Malook
Khan) that two without attributed specific role by them to
each appellant, has no value in the eye of law, as per ratio
of judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled,
“Mian Sohail Ahmad and others Vs the State” (2019
SCMR 956). Identification parade is always held for two
purposes; one to establish identity of the culprits and

secondly to pinpoint the role played by each culprit in the
13

commission of offence. In case titled, “Hakeem and

others vs the State” (2017 SCMR 1546). it has been held
by the Hon’ble supreme Court that:-

“We have gone through the statements made by the
supervising Magistrates ic. PW.5 and PW.10 as
well as the proceedings of the test identification
parades and have straightaway noticed that in the
said parades the present appellants had not been
identified with reference to any role played by them
in the incident in issue. It has consistently been held
by this Court that such a test identification parade is
legally laconic and is of no evidentiary value and a
reference in this respect may be made to the case of
Khadim Hussain v the State(1985 SCMR 721),
Gulam Rasul and 3 others vs the State (1988
SCMR 557), Asghar Ali alias Sabah and others v
the State and others (1992  SCMR_ 2088),
Mehmood Ahmad and 03 others v the State and
another (1995 SCMR_ 127), Siraj ul Haq and
another v the State (2008 SCMR 302), Ghulam
Qadir and 02 others v the State (2008 SCMR
1221), Shafqat Mehmood and others v the State
(2011 SCMR_537), Sabir Ali alias Fauji v_ the
State (2011 SCMR 563) and Muhammad Fayyaz
v the State (2012 SCMR 522).”
The august Supreme Court in the judgment (supra) while

dilating upon the evidentiary value of the joint
identification parade of accused has held that :-

“This Court in case of Bacha Zeb v the State
(2010 SCMR) after relying upon earlier decision
of this Court in case of Lal Pasand v the State
(PLD 1981 SC 142), held that it would be
unreasonable to mix five accused person with
several other persons for the purposes of
identification as such a large number of persons

would only confuse the identifying witnesses
14

and the _proper_course_is to _have_separate
identification parade for each accused. Keeping
in_view the manner in which the identification

arade_was_held, such identification parade

cannot be relied upon...”. (emphasis supplied).

Similar view has been adopted by the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in a recent judgment, rendered in case titled, “Mian
Sohail Ahmad and others Vs the State and others”

(2019 SCMR 956) that:-

“Placing two or more suspects jointly in an
identification parade (or joint parade),
tarnished the homogeneity, sameness and
identicalness of the members of the parade
and defeat the very purpose of having a test
identification parade”.

14. Adverting to the positive FSL report Exh.PZ/2
about the 30 bore pistols allegedly recovered from the
appellants at the time of their arrest and the 06 crime
empties of 30 bore from the spot, record depicts that on
10.04.2009, all the three appellants have been shown
arrested by Manzoor Hussain SHO (now dead) at 1800
hours in the ravine (khwar/Algadda) of Madina Colony in
the limits of ASC Nowshera and 30 bore pistol without
number, has been shown recovered from folding of each of
the appellant vide daily diary No.39 dated 10.04.2009. The
said daily diary has been forwarded to the Police Station
Nowshera Cantt but amazingly no FIR has been registered
against the appellants in the said Police Station on

10.04.2009, rather FIR No.292 dated 12.04.2009 under
15

section 13 A.O. has been shown registered against the
appellants by said Manzoor Hussain SHO on the basis of
separate Murasila, wherein two Kalashnikovs have been
shown recovered on the pointation of appellants, namely,
Naseeb Khan and Aslam Khan. No private person has been
associated with the proceedings of arrest of the appellants
and alleged recovery of pistols from their possession.
Besides, arrest of the appellants from a ravine in the limits
of ASC, Nowshera also pinch a prudent mind because it is
not believable that culprits committing murder of police
would still prefer to remain in the surroundings of the
crime spot. Besides, recovery of 30 bore pistols without
number from folding of each of the appellants also seems
just filling in the blanks as such like pistols can easily be
managed/purchased from the Arms dealers available in
each and every market. Thus, recovery of the 30 bore
pistols from possession of the appellants and positive FSL
report Exh.PZ/2 in respect thereof is nothing but planted
and procured evidence on the part of police to strengthen
the prosecution case where one police constable has been
done to death and another was injured.

15. As regards recovery of two Kalashnikovs on the
pointation/discovery of appellants Naseeb Khan and Aslam
Khan, the same had been shown recovered from the fields,
which were allegedly thrown by them after commission of

the offence. On one hand, the alleged recovery has been
16

shown on joint pointation of the two appellants; while on
the other hand, no role of firing by Kalashnikovs has been
attributed to any of the accused by the complainant-
injured. According to report of injured Hawaldar the
culprits fired at them with their pistols. He has not stated a
single word about Kalashnikovs in the hands of any of the
culprits or using the same in the occurrence. As stated
earlier, since 05 empties of 7.62 bore have also been
shown recovered from the spot, therefore, the I.O. in order
to bring in line the case with spot position, has shown this
planted and fake recovery of Kalashnikovs on the
pointation of the appellants. For the sake of discussion, if
the appellants after commission of the offence were still
having in their possessions the crime pistols then it does
not appeal to a prudent mind that they would have thrown
the Kalashnikovs in the fields because Kalashnikovs being
automatic weapons were necessity needed for their
protection as compared to 30 bore pistols. In this view of
the matter, we are of the considered view that recovery of
Kalashnikovs on the pointation of the two appellants is
concocted and planted evidence on the part of Manzoor
Hussain SHO.

16. Recovery of blood stained pebbles, the last worn
bloodstained police uniform of the deceased and injured
constable, positive serologist report in respect thereof

coupled with autopsy report of the deceased and medico
17

legal report of the injured establish the crime spot to be the
same as alleged by the injured complainant and that they
have sustained firearm injuries, but it does not disclose the
names of culprits. An iota of evidence either direct or
circumstantial is not available on file to prove beyond
shadow of reasonable doubt, that appellants were the
perpetrators of the occurrence. Such pieces of supporting
and corroborative evidence are always taken into
consideration along with direct evidence and not in
isolation. In support, reliance can be placed in on the

judgments rendered by the Hon’ble apex court in Ijaz

Ahmed’s case (1997 SCMR 1279 and Asadullah’s case

(PLD 1971 SC 541). Besides, in case titled, “Saifullah vs

the State” (1985 SCMR 410), it has been ruled by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court that:-

“When there is no eyewitness to be relied

upon, then there is nothing, which can be

corroborated by the recovery”.

For the reasons discussed above, we are firm in our
view to hold that prosecution has miserably failed to prove
the guilt of the appellants through cogent and confidence
inspiring direct evidence or circumstantial evidence
making an unbroken chain, one end of which touch the
dead body of the deceased and another end the neck of the
appellants. The prosecution evidence is pregnant with

confusions and compounding statements of witnesses
18

belied by circumstances create serious doubts in the case,
benefit of which should have been extended to the
appellants but the learned trial Court by not appreciating
the evidence in its true perspective landed into the field of
error by holding the appellants guilty of the offence. As
per golden principle of benefit of doubt one substantial
doubt would be enough for acquittal of the accused.

17. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed, conviction and
sentences of the appellants/convicts recorded vide
impugned judgment dated 13.10.2011, are hereby set-aside
and they are acquitted from the charges leveled against
them. They be set at liberty forthwith, if not confined in
any other case.

18. On acquittal of the convicts, the connected Cr.R.
25-P/2017, titled, “Hawaldar Khan vs Fayaz Khan etc”,
has become infructuous, which is hereby dismissed.

18. These are the reasons of our short order of even
date, which is reproduced below:-

“For reasons to be recorded later, we allow
this appeal, set-aside the conviction and
sentences of the appellants, namely, Fayaz
Khan son of Noor Islam and Naseeb Khan
salias Shina son of Muhammad Rasool,
recorded by the learned trial Court/ASJ-II,
Nowshera under sections 302 (b), 324 and
