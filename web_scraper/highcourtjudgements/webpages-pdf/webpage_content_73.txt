Cr.Bail
Application No.S-195 of 2016
 
 
Mr. Hamayoon
Shaikh, Advocate for applicant.
Mr. Sardar
Ali Shah, APG.
 
 
Date of hearing            :         28.04.2016
 
                   
                                       ORDER
 
SHAHNAWAZ
TARIQ,J:- Through captioned post-arrest bail application,
applicant Abdullah has impugned order dated 01.02.2016, passed by the Court of
learned Additional Sessions Judge (H), Sukkur, whereby his earlier bail
application was declined.
2.      Relevant
facts mentioned in bail application are that complainant ASI Sanaullah Konhar
during patrolling at 2340 hours, intercepted four armed persons at link road
near village BasarMaitlo. There was encounter between police and culprits and
subsequently, applicant was apprehended in injured condition and one unlicensed
pistol along with 3 live bullets, was recovered from his possession, hence
instant FIR.
3.      Learned
counsel for applicant contended that applicant is innocent and has been falsely
implicated in instant crime by complainant due to ulterior motive; that allegedly
encounter continued for 10 minutes but none from police personnel sustained any
bullet injury nor police mobile sustained any kind of damage; that in fact
applicant was apprehended one day prior to lodgment of F.I.R. by local police
and his custody was handed-over to Police Station Jhangro, and police after
causing bullet injuries lodged instant false case; that there are series of
contradictions in F.I.R. and mashirnama of arrest and recovery, which have
created serious doubt regarding the truthiness of occurrence; that applicant
never remained involved in any criminal case.
4.      Learned
APG contended that applicant was apprehended at the spot in injured condition,
which reflects that encounter was occurred between police and culprits, hence
applicant is not entitled for grant of bail.
5.      Perusal
of material available on record reflects that allegedly police party
intercepted at 2340 hours, 4 armed culprits available on the link road near
village Basar Maitlo, where encounter was held between police party and 4
culprits for about 10 minutes with a short distance but none of the police
personnel sustained any bullet injury nor any scratch was caused to the police
mobile. Conversely, due to midnight police secured 10 empties of TT pistols, 8
empties of SMG and 8 empties of G-3 gun which also requires serious
consideration. Perusal of medical report reflects that applicant sustained 2
bullet injuries on the lower part of his leg. There is no criminal record of
the applicant nor he was previously convicted in any criminal case. Admittedly,
investigation has been completed and applicant is no more required further for
investigation, thus his further detention will not serve any useful purpose. Moreover,
applicant is behind the bars since last more than three and half months but
prosecution has failed to examine a single witness to substantiate the charge
against the applicant. It is significant to mention that all the 03 witnesses
are police officials and it was not difficult task for the prosecution to
procure their attendance as they are in service and still posted at their
concerned Police Station. Even there is no apprehension of tampering with the
evidence as all PWs are police officials.The offence u/s 353, PPC is bailable
and punishable for 2 years or fine. To ascertain the offence for attempt to
commit murder of the police, and built injuries sustained by the accused on the
lower part of his leg, requires serious consideration and further probe as none
of the police personnel sustained any injury, and it is for the learned trial
Court to thresh out the truth after recording the evidence being adduced by the
prosecution and defence during trial, thus accused could not be deprived from
the concession of bail mere on the ground that he sustained injuries during the
alleged encounter with police. Reliance is placed on the case of Moundar and
others v. The State (PLJ 1989 SC 1), Raja Muhammad Younus
v. The State(2013 SCMR 669) and Umer Hayat v. The State (2008 SCMR 1621).
6.      Considering
the above facts and circumstances, applicant has succeeded to make out his case
for grant of bail on the ground of further enquiry as contemplated u/s 497(2),
Cr.P.C. Consequently, applicant is enlarged on post-arrest bail subject to his
furnishing solvent surety in the sum of Rs.50,000/- and P.R Bond in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned trial Court.
7.      The
observations made above are tentative in nature and learned trial Court shall
decide the case strictly on merits.
