Being
aggrieved and dis-satisfied with the order dated 22.10.2012 passed by the Court
of Anti-Terrorism, Hyderabad, in crime No.16/2012, registered at P.S. Dhabeji,
under section 324, 353, 436, 147, 148, 149, 341, 342, 447, 504 PPC, whereby bail application of the
applicants was declined, the applicants have approached this Court, seeking
bail under section 497 Cr.P.C. subject to furnishing surety.
2.         The
precise prosecution story is that on the fateful date i.e. 25.07.2012 at 1600
hours, the above accused persons, in an attempt to restrain the Revenue
Officials from removing encroachments and seeking possession of subject land on
the directions of concerned Deputy Commissioner, assembled at National Highway
with weapons, danda and block etc. The accused persons obstructed the police
party from performing their duty and caused harassment and injury to them. It
has been further alleged that the highway was blocked by the accused persons,
whereas certain articles were burnt and the passers byes were also stopped,
which created terror in the public, whereas, police officials received
injuries. After shelling by the police, the accused disbursed, Highway was
opened and the encroachment was removed. Thereafter FIR of the incident was
registered at Police Station Dhabeji. 
3.         Learned
counsel for the applicants have submitted that the applicants are innocent and
have been falsely implicated in the instant crime, whereas a Constitutional
Petition i.e. C.P.No.D-599/2009 was earlier filed by the inhabitants of subject
land including above named accused persons in respect of subject land against
the official respondents, who were attempting to dis-possess the petitioners
from their homes without due process of law. Per learned counsel, restraining
order was passed against the District Administration and the Revenue
Authorities whereby they were directed to act strictly in accordance with law
and not to dis-possess the petitioners from the subject land without due
process of law. They were further directed that if any action for removal of
alleged encroachment or dispossession of the petitioner is required, proper
notices may be issued to each petitioner. Per learned counsel, no notice whatsoever
was ever issued to the petitioners who have been forcibly dispossessed from
their houses, whereas a contempt application in the above mentioned
constitutional petition has already been filed against official respondent. Per
learned counsel, in order to justify their illegal act, the respondents have
falsely implicated the above-named accused persons, whereas, neither any injury
has been caused to any one nor any recovery whatsoever has been effected from
the accused persons. Learned counsel further states that the houses of the
applicants have been demolished by the respondents without due process of law
on the one hand, whereas they have been implicated in this false case. Per
learned counsel, as per allegations stated in the FIR no cognizable offence has
been made out, and the matter requires further inquiry, whereas no private
witness of the alleged incidence or recovery has been shown, therefore,
applicants may be admitted on bail upon furnishing solvent surety. It is stated
that some of the accused persons are even deaf and dumb and of advanced age.
Photographs of the date of incidence have also been placed on record in support
of their contention. 
4.         Conversely,
learned APG and the counsel for the complainant, though could not controvert
the facts as stated hereinabove, however, opposed the grant of bail to the
accused persons as according to them the accused persons have been nominated in
the instant crime with specific role.
5.         We
have heard both the learned counsel for the applicants and the learned APG, and
have also perused the record. It appears that the contention of the counsel for
the applicants with regard to the possession of the applicants over the subject
land, filing of the Constitution Petition before this Court and the restraining
orders passed therein against the official respondents remained undisputed. It
has also come on record that the District Administration with the help of
police party has taken over the possession of the subject land and the house
built on such subject land appears to have been demolished during the police
action. From perusal of the contents of FIR and on tentative assessment of the
record, it is noted that the main common allegation against the above accused
persons is that they obstructed the police party from removing encroachments
and dispossessing the applicants from subject land, blocked highway, caused
harassment to the public and inflicted injuries upon the police personnel.
However, as per MLO report furnished by the prosecution, no bullet injury or grieves
hurt appears to have been inflicted upon any injured persons. No private
witness of the alleged incident and recovery have been associated by the police
nor any detail with regard to recovery of any empties from the place of
incident or any damage to police vehicles during the alleged incidence has been
given. Prosecution story, under the circumstance, cannot be considered free
from doubt, whereas the matter requires further inquiry. We are of the view
that the applicants have made out a case for grant of bail at this stage. Accordingly,
the applicants are admitted to bail subject to furnishing solvent surety in the
sum of Rs.50,000/- each and P.R. Bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of
the Nazir of this Court.
 
6.       Needless to observe that the observation made
herein are tentative in nature and shall not prejudice the merits of the case
which may be examined strictly in accordance with law and on the basis of
evidence on record. 
 
7.       However, it is clarified that if, the applicants
misuse the concession of bail in any manner, the learned trial Court shall be
at liberty to proceed against the applicants as per law.
