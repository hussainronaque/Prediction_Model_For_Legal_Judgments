The applicant is
seeking bail in Crime No.36/09 under Section 392, 34 PPC of Police Station
Khawaja Ajmer Nagri.
The allegation
against the applicant is that he along with other two co-accused robbed the
complainant.
Bail application
has been moved by the applicant before the trial Court which was rejected vide
order dated 13.02.2009.
The learned
counsel for applicant submits that the applicant was involved on the statement
of the co-accused and neither the identification parade of the applicant was
held nor the robbed article allegedly recovered from the applicant was
identified in presence of any Magistrate.
Learned counsel
further states that FIR was lodged with a delay of about one month without any
plausible explanation. Learned counsel then submits that keeping in view the
circumstances of the case the applicant is entitled to the concession of bail
on the ground of further enquiry.
 
Learned counsel has relied
upon the case of MUHAMMAD RAFIQ VS. THE STATE (1997 SCMR 412), HAFIZ ZAMEER
HUSSAIN VS. THE STATE (1994 P.Cr. L. J. 734) and ZAHID BUX VS. THE STATE (1995
P. Cr. L.J. 872).  
Learned counsel for the
State has opposed the bail and submits that the recovery of the robbed article
from the house of the applicant is sufficient to connect him with the
commission of the offence. He then submits that as per police papers the
complainant has identified the robbed article. He submits that in presence of
the recovery of robbed article no case of further enquiry is made out.
I have heard the learned
counsel for the parties and perused the record. The delay in lodging the FIR
has been explained and even otherwise the bail in a matter fallen under the
prohibitory clause cannot be granted only on the ground of delay in lodging the
FIR. The other co-accused has given the name of the applicant and his name is
appearing in the FIR. Furthermore on the pointation of the applicant the robbed
gold ornaments were recovered from his house from one Almirah. Recovery of the
robbed article prima-facie established the involvement of the applicant in the
commission of the offence and in presence of recovery the applicant cannot
claim that a case of further inquiry has been made out. At the bail stage
elaborate enquiry into the evidence available on record could not be made and
only tentative assessment of the material available on record is to be made to
see whether a prima-facie case for grant of bail is made out or not. As far as
the case law cited by the learned counsel for the applicant are concerned the
same have distinguishable facts. Even otherwise in criminal cases there is no
rule of universal application of case law and each case has to be decided on its
own merits.
In
view of the above, I find no merits in the bail application, which is
accordingly dismissed.
