Ali Raza Pathan, State counsel.
~~~
 
                        This
bail plea is pressed on the grounds that names of the applicants do not appear
in the F.I.R, at initial stage the culprits were being traced through foot prints
and sniffer dogs.  After 16-days of his arrest the applicant was implicated in
this case in further statement of the complainant.
 
                        It
is further contended by the learned counsel for the applicant that this case
was actually disposed under “A” class (untraced), by the investigating agency,
but due to malafides of police the applicant was involved after two years of
the incident and there is no other evidence except word of complainant narrated
in his further statement.
 
                        Learned
counsel appearing for the State has confirmed the above position and has no
objection for grant of bail.
 
                        In
view of above, the case of the applicant requires further probe and enquiry,
therefore, this bail application is allowed. The applicants shall be released
on bail on their furnishing solvent surety in the sum of Rs.200,000/- (Two lac)
each, and P.R bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of trial Court.
