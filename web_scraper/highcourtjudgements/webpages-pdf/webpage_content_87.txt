            Applicant
Munawar Ali is booked in Crime No.04/2012 under Sections 409, 420, 468, 471, 34,
109 PPC, P.S FIA, CBC, Karachi. Bail is sought on the ground that other
co-accused have been granted bail and the applicant, who was only acting as
janitorial staff has been denied bail by the trial Court.
            
From the contents of the FIR, it appears that the
applicant was working as janitorial staff in the bank, where his father was
Manager. The allegations against the applicant are that his father allowed him
to access to the accounts of the branch and the applicant played with the bank’s
BBO system by using his father’s password thereby making false & fake debit
entries which resulted in embezzlement of  Rs.3,831,750.40. This is sufficient
material on record to connect the applicant with the commission of the crime.
Bail application is, therefore, dismissed.
