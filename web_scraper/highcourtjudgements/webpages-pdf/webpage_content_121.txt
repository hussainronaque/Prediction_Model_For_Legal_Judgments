ORDER
 
SHAHNAWAZ
TARIQ,J:-   Through the captioned criminal bail
application, applicant Muhammad Ibrahim, has agitated the order dated
03.06.2015, passed by the Court of learned I-Additional Sessions Judge,
Naushehro Feroze, whereby his earlier bail application was declined in Crime
No. 256 of 2013, P.S Naushehro Feroze, for the offence punishable U/S 452, 324,
337-H(ii), 147, 148 and 149 P.P.C. 
2.         Relevant
facts as narrated in the F.I.R. are that on the fateful day, the applicant
along with his companion trespassed into the house of the complainant and he caused
bullet injuries to Mst. Paree, hence the instant F.I.R.
3.         Learned
counsel for the applicant contended that applicant is innocent and has been
falsely implicated by the complainant due to ulterior motive as parties are
already disputed with each other; that co-accused Ghulam Asghar to whom the
same allegations were attributed, was let-off by the police during the
investigation but complainant had not challenged the said approval of summary
by the Judicial Magistrate; that the bullet injury was caused on  non-vital
part of the body of the injured, which is punishable for seven years and does not
fall within the ambit of Prohibitory Clause of Section 497(2), Cr.P.C; that
co-accused Sikandar, Ghulam Hyder, Asghar, Ghulam Hussain and Muhammad Chuttal
have already been granted bail by the High Court vide order dated 20.10.2014; that
prosecution witnesses are interested and close relatives of the complainant,
hence question of tampering with the evidence does not arise. Learned counsel
for the applicant has relied upon the case laws reported in 2010 YLR 2889, 2001
P.Cr.L.J 125, 2012 YLR 1053, 2010 YLR 737, 2011 YLR 2657, 2001 P.Cr.L.J 1345,
1994 SCMR 20512011 SCMR 1392, 2008 SCMR 1621. 
4.         While
converting to the submissions made by the learned counsel for applicant,
learned counsel for complainant vehemently contended that all the case laws
cited by learned counsel for applicant are pertaining to the causing of
injuries and none of the case law is pertaining to section 452 P.P.C to commit trespass
into the house, as such case laws cited by learned counsel for applicant are
quite distinguishable. He further contended that from the averments of the
F.I.R, it is crystal clear that accused with pre-planning to commit the alleged
offence, trespassed into the house of the complainant as such provisions of section
324 P.P.C, are fully attracted. He has relied upon the cases reported in 2004
P.Cr.L.J 692, 2004 SCMR 772 and 2002 SCMR 442.
5.         Learned
APG supported the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for complainant and
contended that in case of any conflict in the injuries mentioned in the F.I.R and
medical certificate, it is for the Court to record the evidence of witnesses and
examine the material at trial, as deeper appreciation of material at bail stage
is not permissible.
6.         I
have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the material available
on record, which emanate that alleged incident was occurred inside of the house
of complainant at 0700 hours, whereby the present applicant has been attributed
a specific role of causing bullet injuries to Mst. Paree, who is also present
in the Court and is unable to stand and walk without the help of others. 
7.         In
the case of Muhammad Nawaz v. the State (2004 SCMR 772), the hon’ble Supreme
Court while dealing with plea of under section 337-F, 337-H, 337-A, 452 PPC has
observed as follows:-
“Accused
was armed with a fire arm weapon and he caused injury to the victim and kept on
firing. Neither the evidence at such stage could be appreciated, nor it could be
determined as to who was the aggressor. Accused was at liberty to move afresh for
grant of bail after some evidence was recorded in the case. Leave to appeal was
refused to accused accordingly.”
8.         It
is significant to mention that present applicant committed trespass into the
house of complainant, with preparation and armed with pistol, and caused fire
arm injury to the victim lady making her permanently disable. Moreover,
applicant disappeared from the scene after commission of the alleged offence
and remained fugitive from the law for a considerable time and surrendered
himself before the Court when his brother was granted pre-arrest bail by the
High Court of Sindh on the ground that no overt act was attributed to him. Indeed,
the incident occurred inside the house of complainant so naturally his family
member would be the witnesses of the incident as such their testimony could not
be discarded mere on the ground of their relationship with the complainant who
otherwise seems to be trustworthy. It is well settled that accused cannot claim
concession of bail as a matter of right even the alleged offence does not fall within
prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C. Reliance is placed on the case of
Muhammad Siddique v. Imtiaz Begum and 2 others (2002 SCMR 445).
9.         As
the sequel of the fact and circumstances referred supra, applicant has failed
to establish the case of further inquiry as envisaged in section 497(2) Cr.P.C.
Consequently, the instant bail application stands dismissed. However, the
learned trial court is directed to record the statement of the complainant,
injured and doctor within two months on the receipt of instant order and then
the applicant would be at liberty to repeat his bail application a fresh. 
 
10.       The
observations made supra are tentative in nature and the learned trial Court
shall decide the case strictly on merits.
