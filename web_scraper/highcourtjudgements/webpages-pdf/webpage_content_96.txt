1.         Urgency application is granted.
2.         Office objection is over ruled. 
3.         Exemption application is granted
for all just exceptions.
4.         Applicant/accused is present with his
advocate.  Though through this bail application, the applicant has prayed for
grant of pre-arrest bail but after hearing at some length, learned counsel for
the applicant is satisfied to convert this criminal bail before arrest
application into protective bail application. In view of his no objection, this
bail application stands converted into protective bail in FIR No.289/2013 under
Section 6/9-B-C CNS Act registered at Police Station Ittehad Town, Karachi. 
It
is argued by the counsel for the applicant that the case against the
applicant/accused is false and has been registered due to enmity. He has
further submitted that in fact the applicant wants to appear before the trial
Court to exercise his right of pre-arrest bail but all the time, the trial
Court is surrounded by the police personnel, therefore, is unable to appear
before the trial Court to exercise his right of pre-arrest bail.  
 
Without
touching upon merits and demerits of the case, the applicant is granted
protective bail for a period of ten (10) days commencing from today, subject to
furnishing surety in the sum of Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) and
P.R. Bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of Nazir of this Court. 
This
order shall cease to have effect on expiry of aforesaid period of ten (10)
days. In case the applicant fails to appear before the concerned Court the
surety amount will be forfeited.
 
This bail application stands
disposed of in the above terms.
