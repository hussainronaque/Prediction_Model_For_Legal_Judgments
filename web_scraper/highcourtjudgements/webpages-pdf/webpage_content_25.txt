For orders on MA No.
1008/08 U/A.
2.                 
For hearing.
 
13.08.2008.
                        Mr.
Noor Muhammad Soomro Advocate for applicant.
                        Mr.
Naimatullah Bhurgri, State counsel.
~~~~~
 
                        The learned
counsel for applicant contended that police has registered fake case against
applicant due to political enmity and there is allegation of recovery of 1450
grams of charas but admittedly only 250-grams were sent for analysis, whereas
there is no explanation regarding the remaining substances. The recovery is
alleged to have effected from highway road, but no private person has been
taken as mashir.  
 
                        The bail
application is opposed by the learned State counsel on he ground that he was
arrested at the spot and the recovery has been effected, out of which 250-grams
were sent for chemical analysis, which report is in positive.  He further
stated that  applicant is hardened criminal and he is involved in five other
cases of the same police station and he is facing trial, as such he is not
entitled for bail. 
 
                        The learned
counsel for applicant in rebuttal of above contention stated that the cases
which are pending in the court are arisen out from tribal enmity between Mahar
and Jatoi communities and he is not convicted in any case. He further contended
that in two cases applicant is on bail an in one case he has been acquitted and
another case is pending for compromise and could not be disposed of as the
court is lying vacant.
 
                        It is settled
principle of law that pendency of the cases cannot be ground for refusal of
bail, particularly when the case is of further enquiry, because every case is
to be seen on its own facts.  In the instant case the quantity alleged to be
recovered is 1450 grams, out of which 250-grams were sent for analysis and for
the remaining substances there is no explanation.  No private witnesses are
taken and when some tribal enmity is also alleged, as such the case of applicant
is of further enquiry.  He is therefore admitted on bail in the sum of
Rs.200,000/- and P.R bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of trial
court.
