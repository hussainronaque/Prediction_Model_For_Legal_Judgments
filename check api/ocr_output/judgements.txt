ORDER

Jamal Khan Mandokhail, J.- Facts in brief are that one Shakeel
Ahmed Abbasi (complainant) registered an FIR No. 500/2010
dated 13.08.2010 against the appellant for offences under sections
302, 324, 109, Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (‘PPC’) registered at
Police Station Murree, Rawalpindi. The complainant alleged that he
along with Raja Azhar Azeem while travelling in a Jeep, when
reached the place of occurrence, he saw the appellant having a
dagger in his hand, was quarreling with his brother, namely,
Muhammad Sabeel, (deceased). After inflicting three dagger blows
on the deceased, the appellant made good his escape, however,
subsequently he was arrested. The appellant was tried by the
Additional Sessions Judge, Rawalpindi (‘Trial Court’), and was
convicted and sentenced to death under section 302(b), PPC. The
appellant feeling aggrieved, filed an appeal before the High Court,

which was dismissed by means of the impugned judgment dated

a |
Cri. A. No. 577 of 2017 etc

17.03.2016. The appellant filed a petition before this Court,
wherein leave to appeal was granted on 20.11.2019, in the

following terms:

‘CRL. M.A. NO. 954 OF 2016

For the reasons mentioned in the application for
condonation of delay, same is allowed and the delay is
condoned.

JAIL PETITION NO.243 OF 2016

2. Learned counsel for the petitioner, inter-alia, contends
that according to FIR the complainant and the eye
witnesses took the deceased in injured condition to THQ
Hospital in their own jeep whereas the MLC negates the
stance of both the eye witnesses as according to the
same it was Rescue 1122 who brought the deceased in
injured condition to the hospital and there is no mention
of name of any of the alleged eye witnesses in the MLC;
that in order to suppress this material fact, the
prosecution did not produce the said MLC on record
through the said medical officer and the same was
brought by the defence while cross- examining the said
medical officer; that during investigation, the bus driver
and the conductor claimed before the 1.0. that the
occurrence took place in the bus and subsequently the
said driver was produced as D.W. and that there are
material contradictions in the statement of both the eye
witnesses.

3. In view of the above, leave to appeal is granted to re-
appraise the entire evidence.’

Criminal Appeal No. 577 of 2019

2. Arguments heard and have perused the record. The
prosecution’s case rests upon the statements of the complainant
and Raja Azhar Azeem, who appeared as PW-1 & PW-2 respectively
before the Trial Court. According to them, they were about 20
paces away from the deceased and the appellant, when they saw
both of them were altercating. In reply to a question, the
complainant stated that after 10 seconds, the appellant inflicted
first blow upon the deceased. Admittedly, the appellant was alone,
whereas, the complainant, PW-2 and the deceased were three in
numbers. Taking the words of the complainant that he and the
eyewitness were 20 paces away from the appellant, they could have
easily reached the appellant and overpowered him within few

seconds, but no attempt was made by them to avert the attack. It
Cri. A. No. 577 of 2017 etc

is hard to believe that life of the brother and uncle of PW-1 and
PW-2 respectively, was in danger, why they did not react
immediately? Had the complainant and his nephew been present
at the time and place of the occurrence, the appellant could have
been apprehended before causing any injury to the deceased.
Despite the fact that the complainant and his companion were 20
paces away from the appellant, they did not make any attempt to

catch hold of him, even after causing injuries to the deceased.

oi Moreover, the witnesses alleged that after the occurrence,
they boarded the injured in their jeep to take him to a hospital for
treatment and when they reached at Bansra Gali, the injured was
shifted to Rescue Van of 1122 for taking him to THQ Hospital
Murree. The natural reaction of the brother ought to have reached
the hospital immediately in order to save the life of the injured, but
the needful was not done. There was no justification in shifting the
injured from the jeep to the Rescue Van. To substantiate the
contention of the complainant, the statements of the Driver of the
Rescue Van was of utmost importance, but the IO did not record a
statement of any of the members of the van. By not recording the
statements of the driver or the other officials of the Van of Rescue
1122, the presumption would be that they might not be supporting
the contention of the complainant. Besides, for the sake of
arguments, if it is believed that the complainant and PW-2 boarded
the injured in the jeep, then the jeep and clothes of the
complainant and the witness must have been stained with blood.
Admittedly, no blood was collected from the jeep nor the blood
stained clothes of the witnesses were taken into possession by the
Investigation Officer (10) and no explanation in this behalf has
been advanced by the prosecution. The stance of the complainant
and the eye witness is not only improbable, but also got no support
from the record. The prosecution has failed to prove the presence
of the complainant and his nephew at the time and place of the

occurrence.

4. Another important aspect of the case is that Dr. Shahzad
Rasool conducted the postmortem of the deceased, who while
appearing as PW-10 before the Trial Court, submitted that rigor

mortis was developed and eyes of the deceased were semi opened.
Cri, A. No. 577 of 2017 etc

Considering the contention of the complainant that the injured was
immediately taken to the hospital for treatment in his jeep, then a
question arises as to how rigor mortis was developed and why eyes
of the deceased were not closed. The postmortem report, the
statement of the doctor and his opinion do not support the
contention of the complainant regarding immediate shifting of the
injured to the hospital. It is a settled principle of law that a
documentary evidence carries with it a presumption of truth,
therefore, there is no reason to disbelieve the postmortem report
and the statement of the doctor, which proves the fact that the
injured remained at the place of the occurrence for a considerable
long period of time. Had the complainant and PW-2 been present
at the place and time of the occurrence, the injured could have
been taken to the hospital, without loss of time and thereby, rigor
mortis could not have been developed. It is also worth noting that
in his cross examination, the doctor explained that the injuries
were lunar shaped, which means that probably, the injuries was
caused through lunar shaped weapon. On the contrary, the
complainant and the eye-witnesses alleged that the appellant
inflicted dagger blows on the deceased. Their statements regarding
nature of the injures sustained by the deceased and the weapon
used contradict the postmortem report and the statement of the
doctor. We are conscious of the fact that just because the
witnesses are related to the deceased, their testimonies cannot be
disregarded, however, it is also important that testimonies of such
witnesses have to be scrutinized with greater care and
circumspection. The facts discussed herein makes it clear that the
conduct of the witnesses was unnatural. It leads us to a
conclusion that presence of the witnesses at the time of the crime

was doubtful, as such the occurrence seems to be unseen.

Disclosure leading to recovery of crime weapon

5. In order to bring the case within the ambit of Article 40 of
the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, the prosecution must prove
that a person accused of any offence, in custody of police officer,
has conveyed an information or made a statement to the police,
leading to discover of new fact concerning the offence, which is not

in the prior knowledge of the police. Such information or statement
Crl. A. No. 577 of 2017 etc

should be in writing and in presence of witnesses. In absence of
information or statement from a person, accused of an offence in
custody of police officer, discovery of fact alone, would not bring
the case of the prosecution under the said Article. According to the
prosecution, a dagger used in the commission of the offence was
recovered on the disclosure and pointation of the appellant.
Surprisingly, the IO did not record the information received from
the appellant in writing, in presence of a witness, while he was in
police custody. The prosecution has failed to establish any
disclosure from the appellant, therefore, recovery of the dagger, in
the circumstances was immaterial. Even otherwise, the IO stated
that the recovery of the dagger was effected on the pointation of the
appellant, in presence of PW-5, who is also a nephew of the
deceased. According to the said witness, the dagger was wrapped
in a black colour shopper, but when it was presented before the
Trial Court, it was unsealed and was wrapped in a white colour
plastic. None of the recovery witness put any identification mark
upon it in order to exclude any possibility of foisting false recovery
or substituting the recovered one. The manner in which the dagger
was taken into possession and produced in the Court, creates
doubt regarding its recovery, therefore, the High Court has rightly
disbelieved it.

6. Without prejudice to the above, the appellant took a plea
that actually the occurrence had taken place in a bus. The driver
and conductor of the said bus appeared before the IO and recorded
their statements under section 161 Cr.PC. This fact was admitted
by the IO in his cross-examination, but surprisingly, their
statements were not found in the case file nor the witnesses were
produced before the court. The IO was supposed to gather and
collect every material evidence with regard to the occurrence and to
bring the real culprit before the Court. The record shows that the
1.0. did not collect the evidence properly. Some relevant evidence
was withheld without any reason. It seems that either the
investigation was conducted in a colourful and biased manner to
save the real accused or it was a result of incompetence of the IO.
The manner in which the investigation was conducted makes the

prosecution’s case highly doubtful, benefits whereof should have
Cri. A. No. 577 of 2017 etc

been extended to the appellant, but the needful was not done by

the fora below.

We There is another important aspect of the case that the
injured was shifted to the hospital at about 10:30 am and by that
time he was alive. He was under a treatment till 01:35 pm and
thereafter, succumbed to injuries. This fact was admitted by the IO
in his cross-examination. According to the prosecution, the FIR
was registered at 11:25 am, but surprisingly, section 302, PPC was
inserted in it and by that time, the injured was alive. This shows
that the FIR was actually registered after the death of the
deceased, but with malafide intention, time of its registration was
mentioned as 11:25 am in order to cover the delay in lodging the
FIR. The delay in lodging the FIR was a result of deliberation and
consultation, therefore, false involvement of the appellant cannot

be ruled out.

8. Motive for the crime as alleged by the complainant in the FIR
was dispute over some water issues between the appellant and the
deceased. At the same time, PW-5 in his statement before the
Court stated that a day before the incident, the appellant felt insult
by the hands of the deceased, which, according to him, was a
motive behind the occurrence. Though both the witnesses have
alleged different motives, but there is no evidence on the record to
prove either of the two, that is why the High Court has rightly
disbelieved it.

9. After disbelieving the recovery of the crime weapon and the
motive by the High Court, only the statements of PW-1 and PW-2
are left for consideration. As discussed above, their statements do
not get support from the available circumstantial evidence, rather
were contradicted by the other evidences. The conduct of the
witnesses throughout was unnatural, therefore, they were not
trustworthy. The prosecution has failed to establish its case
against the appellant Zafar Ali Abbasi beyond a reasonable doubt.
The fora below did not appreciate the evidence and the material
available on the record properly, hence came to a wrong
conclusion. Under such circumstances, the conviction and

sentence awarded to the appellant are not sustainable.
Cri. A. No. 577 of 2017 etc

10. Thus, these are the reasons of our short order dated

13.05.2024 which is reproduced herein below:

“For the reasons to be recorded separately, Crl. A.
577/2019 is allowed and Crl. P. 596/2016 is dismissed
on merit as well as being barred by time. The impugned
judgment dated 17.03.2016 passed by the Lahore High
Court and that of the learned Trial Court dated
27.04.2012 are set aside. The appellant-Zafar Ali Abbasi
is acquitted of the charges leveled against him and be
released from the jail forthwith, if not required to be
detained in any other case.”

Criminal Petition No. 596/2016

11. After accepting the appeal of the respondent convict and
setting aside the impugned judgment, this petition for

enhancement of sentence is dismissed.
