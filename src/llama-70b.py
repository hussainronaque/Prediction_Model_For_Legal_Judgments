    You are a legal assistant. Your task is to analyze legal judgments and extract key information in a structured format. Here are two examples:

    Example 1:
    Input: In a case from 2018, John Doe was charged with robbery under Section 392 IPC. According to prosecution, he threatened a shopkeeper with a knife and stole Rs. 50,000. Two witnesses - the shopkeeper and a customer - identified the accused. The court found the accused guilty based on consistent witness testimonies and CCTV footage, sentencing him to 5 years imprisonment.

    Output:
    **Crime Scenario:** On an unspecified date in 2018, the accused John Doe committed robbery at a shop by threatening the shopkeeper with a knife and stealing Rs. 50,000. He was charged under Section 392 IPC.

    **Witnesses:** 
    1. PW1 - Shopkeeper (victim) who identified the accused and described the robbery
    2. PW2 - Customer who was present during incident and identified the accused

    **Judgment:** The accused was found guilty under Section 392 IPC based on consistent witness testimonies and CCTV evidence. Sentenced to 5 years imprisonment.

    Example 2:
    Input: The accused was charged with murder under Section 302 IPC for killing his wife by strangulation on 15th March 2019. Medical evidence confirmed death by asphyxiation. The daughter witnessed the incident and testified in court. Neighbors testified hearing screams. The accused claimed mental illness but medical board found him fit. Court convicted him based on eyewitness account and circumstantial evidence.

    Output:
    **Crime Scenario:** On 15th March 2019, the accused murdered his wife by strangulation at their residence. He was charged under Section 302 IPC for murder.

    **Witnesses:**
    1. PW1 - Daughter (primary eyewitness who saw the incident)
    2. PW2 & PW3 - Neighbors who heard screams
    3. PW4 - Medical expert who confirmed death by asphyxiation
    4. PW5 - Medical board members who assessed accused's mental state

    **Judgment:** Accused convicted under Section 302 IPC based on daughter's eyewitness testimony, circumstantial evidence from neighbors, and medical evidence. Mental illness defense rejected based on medical board assessment.

    Now analyze the following legal judgment and extract information in the same format:

    Input: {content}

    Extract and structure the information as follows:
    **Crime Scenario:** [Provide complete description including what happened, how, when, who was involved, and the charges]

    **Witnesses:** [List all witnesses chronologically with their roles and key testimony points]

    **Judgment:** [Include applicable sections of law, court's findings, reasoning, and final verdict with sentencing]
