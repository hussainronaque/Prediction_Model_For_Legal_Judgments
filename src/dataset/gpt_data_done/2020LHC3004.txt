2016 by:

Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan, J:- This judgment shall
dispose of Criminal Appeal No.671 of 2016, filed by Saqib Ali

(appellant) against his conviction and sentence, as well as Criminal
Revision No.839 of 2016, filed by Muhammad Azam Butt
petitioner/complainant for enhancement of sentence awarded to
Saqib Ali (respondent of said criminal revision), from
imprisonment for life to death, as both these matters have arisen out
of the same judgment dated 09.03.2016, passed by learned

Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore.

2. Saqib Ali (appellant) along with his co-accused was tried in
case F.LR. No.905/2009 dated 17.11.2009, registered at police

Cri. Appeal No.671 of 2016 2
Crl. Revision No.839 of 2016

station Ghazi Abad, Lahore in respect of offences under sections
302/363/ 364-A/201 PPC. After conclusion of the trial, the learned
trial Court vide its impugned judgment dated 09.03.2016, has

convicted and sentenced the appellant as under: -

Under section 364-A PPC to imprisonment for
life.

Under section 302(b) PPC to imprisonment for
life. The appellant was also directed to pay
compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees one
hundred thousand only), to the legal heirs of
Hashir (deceased), as provided under section 544-
ACr.P.C and in case of default to further undergo
six months simple imprisonment.

Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C was also extended
to the appellant. Both the sentences of
imprisonment were ordered to run concurrently.

Through the same impugned judgment, the

appellant was acquitted from the charges under

Sections 364-A, 302(b) and 201 of PPC regarding

the abduction and murder of Muhammad Ahmad

(minor deceased) and disappearance of evidence

to the extent of said deceased whereas, co-accused

of the appellant, namely, Atif Zaman, Iftikhar

Alam and Mst. Ayesha were acquitted from all the

charges.
3. Brief facts of the case as given by Muhammad Azam Butt
(complainant/PW-5) in his complaint Ex.PA, on the basis of which
formal FIR Ex.PA/1 was chalked out, are that the complainant was
employed in the Daily Express News. On 16.11.2009, at about 6.00
p.m (evening), the children of the complainant namely Muhammad
Ahmed aged about 5 years, Muhammad Hashir aged about 3, were
playing with the brother-in-law of the complainant namely Saqib
Ashrafi alias Saqib Ali (appellant), who came to the house of the
complainant and stayed there for about 2 to 3 hours and thereafter
he (appellant) left the said house. After half an hour from the
departure of the appellant, the above mentioned children of the
complainant also disappeared from his house. The complainant

expressed his suspicion that his children had been abducted by

Saqib Ashrafi alias Saqib Ali (appellant) because he (appellant)
Cri. Appeal No.671 of 2016 3
Crl. Revision No.839 of 2016

used to pose himself as a fake “Peer” and entice the family
members of the complainant, therefore, the complainant forbade the
appellant from doing so and posing himself as a fake “Peer’’, due to
which he (appellant) abducted the children of the complainant,

hence the abovementioned FIR.

Initially the FIR was lodged under section 363 PPC. On
02.12.2009, the dead body of an unknown minor was found in a
canal situated within the area of police station Satto Katla, Lahore
whereupon FIR No.1420/2009, under section 302 PPC, was lodged
at police station Satto Katla against unknown accused persons.
Later on, the dead body of abovementioned unknown minor was
identified to be that of Muhammad Hashir (minor son of the
complainant), therefore, offences under sections 302/201 PPC, were

added in the instant case.

4. The appellant was arrested in this case by the police on
15.12.2009 and after completion of investigation the challan was
prepared and submitted before the learned trial court. The learned
trial Court, after observing legal formalities, as provided under the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 framed charge against the
appellant and his co-accused to which they pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. In order to prove its case the prosecution produced
sixteen witnesses during the trial. The statement of the appellant
under section 342, Cr.P.C was recorded, wherein he refuted the

allegations levelled against him and professed his innocence.

5. The learned trial Court vide its judgment dated 09.03.2016,
found the appellant guilty, convicted and sentenced him as

mentioned and detailed above.

6. It is contended by learned counsel for the appellant that the
appellant is absolutely innocent and he has falsely been implicated
in this case by the complainant being in league with the local
police; that the evidence of Muhammad Yaqoob, PW.3 who

allegedly saw the appellant and his co-accused while throwing two
Cri. Appeal No.671 of 2016 4
Crl. Revision No.839 of 2016

minor boys in the canal, is not worthy of reliance because the said
witness appeared before the police with considerable delay of two
months and six days from the date of occurrence; that the
circumstantial evidence produced by the prosecution is very weak
thus, the same is not worthy of reliance; that the dead body of
Muhammad Ahmad, deceased has not been recovered in this case
and the appellant has been acquitted from the charges of abduction
and murder of Muhammad Ahmad, deceased; that insofar as the
murder of Muhammad Hashir, deceased is concerned, according to
his postmortem examination report, there were five injuries on his
body but no weapon of offence has been recovered from the
possession of the appellant; that the alleged recoveries of last worn
clothes of the minor deceased, namely, Muhammad Ahmad and
Muhammad Hashir were not stained with blood and the said
recoveries were also rightly disbelieved by the learned trial Court;
that the evidence of last seen produced by the prosecution through
Roheel Ahmad, PW.11 and Atif Mehmood, PW.12 is not worthy of
reliance because they made their statements before the police with
the delay of one month and seventeen days from the occurrence;
that the prosecution evidence regarding the alleged pointation of the
place of occurrence by the appellant is also inconsequential because
nothing incriminating was recovered from the said place; that the
motive alleged by the prosecution has also not been proved through
any reliable evidence and the same has rightly been discarded by
the learned trial Court; that the prosecution evidence has been
disbelieved by the learned trial Court against Mst. Ayesha, Atif
Zaman and Iftikhar Alam, co-accused, therefore, the same evidence
cannot be believed against the appellant without independent
corroboration which is very much lacking in this case; that the
prosecution miserably failed to prove its case against the appellant
beyond the shadow of doubt, therefore, this appeal may be accepted

and the appellant may be acquitted from the charges.
Cri. Appeal No.671 of 2016 5
Crl. Revision No.839 of 2016

7. On the other hand, it is argued by the learned District Public
Prosecutor assisted by learned counsel for the complainant that the
prosecution has proved its case against the appellant beyond the
shadow of any doubt; that the co-accused of the appellant, namely,
Mst. Ayesha, Atif Zaman and Iftikhar Alam were not nominated in
the FIR or by the prosecution witnesses of last seen evidence,
namely, Roheel Ahmad, PW.11 and Atif Mehmood, PW.12,
therefore, their case is distinguishable from the case of Saqib Ali,
appellant and as such the acquittal of the said co-accused is of no
avail to the appellant; that convincing and reliable prosecution
evidence is available on the record against the appellant in the shape
of statement of Muhammad Yaqoob, PW.3, who saw the appellant
and his co-accused while throwing the minor boys in the canal; that
there is evidence of lastly seeing alive the minor sons of the
complainant in the company of the appellant which was produced
by the prosecution through Roheel Ahmad, PW.11 and Atif
Mehmood, PW.12; that last worn clothes and articles of both the
deceased boys were recovered on the pointation of the appellant and
the recoveries of the said clothes/articles have been proved by the
prosecution through Abdul Basit PW.4; that Muhammad Azam
Butt, complainant/PW.5 also proved the motive alleged in this case
that the appellant used to pose himself as a fake ‘Peer’ and he was
forbidden by the complainant, therefore, due to the said grudge, he
(appellant) committed the murder of his (complainant’s) two minor
sons; that the prosecution witnesses stood the test of lengthy cross-
examination but their evidence could not be shaken; that there is no
substance in this appeal, therefore, the same may be dismissed.
Learned counsel for the complainant while arguing Crl. Revision
No.839 of 2016, contends that Saqib Ali, respondent (appellant in
Crl. Appeal No.671 of 2016) has wrongly been awarded lesser
punishment by the learned trial Court whereas there was no
mitigating circumstance in his favour, therefore, he may be awarded

capital punishment.
Cri. Appeal No.671 of 2016 6
Crl. Revision No.839 of 2016

8. Arguments heard and record perused.

9. The detail of the prosecution case as set forth in the FIR
(Ex.PA/1) and in the complaint (Ex.PA) has already been given in
paragraph No.3 of this judgment, therefore, there is no need to

repeat the same.

10. As mentioned earlier, all the accused including Saqib Ali,
appellant have been acquitted from the charges of abduction and
murder of Muhammad Ahmad, minor deceased, however, Saqib
Ali, appellant has been convicted and sentenced only for the
abduction and murder of Muhammad Hashir, deceased, as

mentioned and detailed above.

11. Ihave noted that the prosecution has produced two types of
evidence in this case. The prosecution produced ocular account of
the occurrence through Muhammad Yaqoob, PW.3 and at the same
time, the prosecution has also produced circumstantial evidence in
this case through Abdul Basit (PW.4), Muhammad Azam (PW’5),
Roheel Ahmad (PW.11) and Atif Mehmood (PW.12). It is,
therefore, evident that the complainant party of this case was not
sure that as to whether they (complainant party) should produce
direct evidence in the shape of ocular account or to produce
circumstantial evidence in this case against the accused persons.
Insofar as the ocular account of the prosecution is concerned, I have
noted that the prosecution has produced Muhammad Yaqoob, PW.3
who had seen Saqib Ali, appellant and his co-accused while

throwing two minor boys in the canal.

Ocular_account/Evidence regarding throwing two minor
boys in the canal by the appellant and his co-accused.

The prosecution produced its ocular account through
Muhammad Yaooq, PW.3. He stated that on 16.11.2009, he was
proceeding from cavalry ground to Harbanspura, Lahore alongwith
his friend Tariq Hussain and when they were crossing Harbanspura

Bridge, they saw Saqib Ali, appellant, Atif Zaman and Iftikhar
Cri. Appeal No.671 of 2016 7
Crl. Revision No.839 of 2016

Alam, co-accused while throwing two minor boys in the canal. He
further stated that a girl was also sitting in the car alongwith Saqib
Ali, appellant and his co-accused at the time of occurrence.
Muhammad Yaqoob, PW.3 admitted during his cross-examination
that his statement was recorded by the police on 22.01.2010. It is
not understandable that if Muhammad Yaqoob, PW.3 had
witnessed the occurrence of a heinous crime and seen Sagqib Ali,
appellant and his co-accused while throwing two minor boys in the
canal on 16.11.2009 then as to why he remained mum till
22.01.2010 i.e. for a period of two months and six days from the
date of occurrence. Muhammad Yaqoob, PW.3 also stated in his
examination-in-chief that on the next day of occurrence, he visited
Police Station Ghazi Abad in connection with personal affair where
he identified all the accused persons of this case but even then he
did not make statement regarding the above mentioned fact to the
police on the said day and made his statement before the police for
the first time on 22.01.2010. No plausible explanation has been
given by the said witness for remaining mum for such a long
period. It is also noteworthy that the statement of Muhammad
Yaqoob, PW.3 is in conflict with the medical evidence produced by
the prosecution in this case. Dr. Liaqat Ali, APMO (PW.10)
conducted postmortem examination on the dead body of
Muhammad Hashir, deceased on 08.12.2009. According to his
opinion the time that elapsed between the injuries and death was
immediate and the time that elapsed between the death and
postmortem examination was six to twelve days meaning thereby
that the death of Muhammad Hashir, deceased took place between
26.11.2009 to 02.12.2009 whereas according to the statement of
Muhammad Yaqoob, PW.3, Muhammad Hashir, deceased was
thrown in the canal by Saqib Ali, appellant and his co-accused on
16.11.2009 and as such there is difference of ten days regarding the
date of death as given by Muhammad Yaqoob, PW.3 and the
Medical Officer (PW.16).
Cri. Appeal No.671 of 2016 8
Crl. Revision No.839 of 2016

12. Moreover, Muhammad Yagqoob, PW.3 did not state that he
saw Saqib Ali, appellant and his co-accused while throwing dead
bodies of the minors in the canal rather he stated that he saw the
appellant and his co-accused while throwing two children in the

canal. His examination-in-chief in this respect reads as under:-

“Stated that on 16.11.2009, I was proceeding to obtain an
installment from cavalry ground to Harbanspura at about
10:00/11:00pm alongwith Tariq Hussain, my friend. When
we were crossing Harbanspura Bridge, we saw a vehicle in
which a girl was sitting, we saw Sagqib, Atif and Iftikhar

accused present in the Court throwing two children in
the canal. Next day I visited Police Station Ghazi Abad in

connection with a personal affair, there was a panchait and
there we found out that panchait was regarding missing of
two children who allegedly were thrown in the canal.
There I identified all the three accused present in the Court.
I prior to that did not have any acquaintance with
complainant of the case and I told him what I saw the

preceding night.”

(Bold and underlining supplied for emphasis).

It is, therefore, evident from the statement of Muhammad Yaqoob,
PW.3 that he saw the appellant and his co-accused while throwing
two children in the canal and not their dead bodies. On the other
hand, according to the medical evidence furnished by Dr. Liaqat
Ali, APMO, PW.10, there were five injuries on the body of
Muhammad Hashir, deceased which were ante mortem and bones
under injuries No.1 to 4 were also found to be fractured meaning
thereby that Muhammad Hashir, deceased was murdered before
throwing his dead body in the canal but as mentioned earlier
Muhammad Yaqoob, PW.3 did not state that the appellant and his
co-accused threw the dead body of any minor in the canal or the

minors were thrown in injured condition in the canal and as such
Cri. Appeal No.671 of 2016 9
Crl. Revision No.839 of 2016

the evidence of Muhammad Yaqoob, PW.3 is in conflict with the
medical evidence of the prosecution. Under the circumstances, the
ocular evidence produced by the prosecution through Muhammad
Yaqoob, PW.3 is not worthy of reliance and the same has rightly
been disbelieved by the learned trial Court in paragraph No.26 of

the impugned judgment.

13. Insofar as the circumstantial evidence produced in this case is
concerned, it is by now well settled that in a case of circumstantial
evidence, utmost care and caution is required for reaching at a just
decision of the case. In such like cases every circumstance should
be linked with each other and it should form such a continuous
chain that its one end touches the dead body and other to the neck
of the accused but if any link in the chain is missing then its benefit
must go to the accused. In this regard, guidance has been sought
from the judgments of the Apex Court of the country reported as
‘Ch. Barkat Ali vs. Major Karam Elahi Zia and antoher’ (1992
SCMR 1047), ‘Sarfraz Khan Vs. The State’ (1996 SCMR 188) and
‘Asadullah and another vs. The State’ (PLJ 1999 SC 1018). In the

case of Ch. Barkat Ali (supra), the august Supreme Court of

Pakistan, at page 1055, observed as under:-

‘...Law relating to circumstantial evidence that
proved circumstances must be incompatible with
any reasonable hypothesis of the innocence of the
accused. See ‘Siraj vs. The Crown’ (PLD 1956
FC 123). Ina case of circumstantial evidence, the
rule is that no link in the chain should be broken
and that the circumstances should be such as
cannot be explained away on any hypothesis other
than the guilt of the accused.’

In the case of Sarfraz Khan (supra), the august Supreme

Court of Pakistan, at page 192, held as under:-

7....It is well settled that circumstantial evidence
should be so inter-connected that it forms such a
continuous chain that its one end touches the dead
Cri. Appeal No.671 of 2016 10
Crl. Revision No.839 of 2016

body and other to the neck of the accused thereby
excluding all the hypothesis of his innocence.’

Further reliance in this context is placed on the case of ‘Altaf
Hussain vs. Fakhar Hussain and another’ (2008 SCMR 1103)

wherein, at page 1105 it was held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court
as under:-
7....Needless to emphasis that all the pieces of
evidence should be so linked that it should give the
picture of a complete chain, one corner of which
should touch the body of the deceased and other

corner to the neck of the accused. Failure of one
link will destroy the entire chain.’

14. Keeping in view the parameters, laid down in the above-
mentioned judgments, I proceed to discuss separately, every piece

of the prosecution circumstantial evidence produced in this case.

15. The prosecution circumstantial evidence is based on the

following pieces of evidence:

i) Last seen evidence;

ii) Recoveries of last worn clothes and other
articles of both the deceased;

iii) Pointation of the place of occurrence by the
appellant;

iv) Motive;
v) Medical evidence.

i) Last seen evidence:

It is noteworthy that Muhammad Azam Butt, complainant
(PW.5) while lodging the FIR did not level the allegation that he
saw the appellant while taking away his two minor sons
(Muhammad Ahmad and Muhammad Hashir) out of his house. He
only alleged that on 16.11.2009 at about 6:00 P.M., Saqib Ali,
appellant, who was his (complainant’s) brother-in-law came to his

(complainant’s) house and kept on playing with his above
Cri. Appeal No.671 of 2016 11
Crl. Revision No.839 of 2016

mentioned sons. He (complainant) further stated that Saqib Ali,
appellant remained in his house for 2/3 hours and thereafter, he left
his house. After half an hour from the departure of the appellant
from the complainant’s house, the minor sons of the complainant
also disappeared from the said house. The complainant expressed
his suspicion that his sons were abducted by Saqib Ali, appellant. It
is, therefore, evident that the complainant had not seen the
appellant while taking away his minor sons from his house. The last
seen evidence was produced by the prosecution through Roheel
Ahmad, PW.11 and Atif Mehmood, PW.12. Both the above
mentioned witnesses stated that on 16.11.2009, Saqib Ali, appellant
brought one minor boy to the house of Roheel Ahmad, PW.11 so
that he may play with his goats and thereafter the appellant left the
above mentioned house, however, after sometime, Saqib Ali,
appellant came back to the said house and took the minor boy with

him.

Insofar as the evidence of Roheel Ahmad, PW.11 is
concerned, I have noted that cross-examination on the said
prosecution witness on behalf of Saqib Ali, appellant was reserved
on 06.07.2013. He appeared before the learned trial Court on some
subsequent dates of hearing but thereafter he statedly left for Saudi
Arabia, therefore, his statement could not be subjected to cross-
examination. His bail-able warrants of arrest were repeatedly issued
by the learned trial Court and eventually his non-bail-able warrants
of arrest were issued vide order dated 15.04.2015 but he did not
appear before the Court for cross-examination. There is no order of
the learned trial Court to close the right of cross-examination of
Saqib Ali, appellant on Roheel Ahmad, PW.11. It is by now well
settled that the statement of a witness which is not subjected to
cross-examination is inadmissible in evidence and the same is of no
legal effect, therefore, no benefit could be extended to the
prosecution on the basis of examination-in-chief recorded in this

case of Roheel Ahmad, PW.11. Reference in this respect is made to
Cri. Appeal No.671 of 2016 12
Crl. Revision No.839 of 2016

the cases reported as “Pir Mazharul Haq and others Vs. The State
through Chief Ehtesab Commissioner, Islamabad” (PLD 2005
Supreme Court 63) and “Jan Sher Khan Vs. The State” (2013
MLD 1554).

Insofar as the evidence of Atif Mehmood, PW.12 is
concerned, I have noted that the said witness stated that on
16.11.2009, he lastly saw Saqib Ali, appellant in the company of a
minor boy to whom he later on recognized with the help of his
snaps as Muhammad Hashir (deceased) but he made statement
before CIA Police on 02.01.2010. There is delay of one month and
seventeen days in making the statement of above mentioned
prosecution witness before the police. Learned counsel for the
complainant argued that Atif Mehmood, PW.12 was not known to
the complainant and he was resident of the locality of the appellant,
therefore, he had no information regarding the abduction or murder
of minor sons of the complainant and as such the above mentioned
delay in making the statement by Atif Mehmood, PW.12 before
CIA Police is not fatal to the prosecution case. There is no
substance in the above mentioned argument of learned counsel for
the complainant because I have noted that Atif Mehmood, PW.12
has admitted during his cross-examination that his affidavit Ex.DD
bears his signature. The perusal of affidavit Ex.DD shows that the
same was sworn by Atif Mehmood, PW.12. In the said affidavit,
Atif Mehmood, PW.12 deposed that Saqib Ali, appellant is
absolutely innocent. Atif Mehmood, PW.12 further deposed in the
said affidavit that Muhammad Azam Butt, complainant had lodged
a false and fabricated case against Saqib Ali, appellant regarding
abduction of his two sons. The backside of affidavit Ex.DD shows
that the same was issued on 19.11.2009. The perusal of the above
mentioned affidavit shows that Atif Mehmood, PW.12 was in the
knowledge of the occurrence on 19.11.2009 but he made statement
regarding last seen evidence before CIA police for the first time on

02.01.2010. Although, it is next argued by learned counsel for the
Cri. Appeal No.671 of 2016 13
Crl. Revision No.839 of 2016

complainant that Atif Mehmood, PW.12 has explained that
affidavit Ex.DD was got executed from him under the pressure of
‘Mohallahdars’ but the fact remains that the present occurrence
was in the knowledge of Atif Mehmood, PW.12 on 19.11.2009 but
he remained silent for a period of one month and thirteen days from
the date of swearing of his affidavit Ex.DD and made his statement
before the police for the first time regarding last seen evidence on
02.01.2010. He did not give any reason for remaining mum for
such a long period. Learned counsel for the appellant next argued
that Muhammad Azam Butt, complainant (PW.5) was a journalist
by profession and he was working in the daily Express News and
‘Express News Channel’, therefore, under his pressure, Atif
Mehmood, PW.12 was arrested in this case as a suspect who gave
false evidence of last seen against the appellant under the pressure
of the police and the complainant. The said contention of learned
counsel for the appellant is supported by the statement made by
Atif Mehmood, PW.12 during his cross-examination who candidly
conceded that on 02.01.2010 (the date when statement of the said
witness was recorded by the CIA police), he (PW.12) was in police
custody and being interrogated in this case. The relevant part of his

statement reads as under:-

“Tt is correct that on 02.01.2010, I was in police
custody and being interrogated in this case. My
‘Behnoi’ Tariq constable came at CIA staff only
to inquire why I was arrested. I was not guilty,
therefore, I was released. It is incorrect to
suggest that said Tariq was a Guarantor that I
shall depose in the Court according to the desire
of police. It is incorrect to suggest that to own
the guarantee of my ‘Behnoi’ Tariq, I deposed

falsely.”

It is, therefore, evident that Atif Mehmood, PW.12 was himself
interrogated in this case as a suspect and he was under police

custody when he made statement against the appellant on
Cri. Appeal No.671 of 2016 14
Crl. Revision No.839 of 2016

02.01.2010. I am, therefore, of the view that it is not safe to rely
upon the above mentioned evidence of last seen produced by the
prosecution through Roheel Ahmad, PW.11 and Atif Mehmood,
PW.12.

ii) Recoveries of last worn clothes and other articles of

both the deceased.

Abdul Basit, PW.4 is the witness of recovery of last worn
clothes of Muhammad Ahmad and Muhammad Hashir, deceased on
the pointation of Saqib Ali, appellant. He stated that on 28.12.2009,
Saqib Ali, appellant led to the recovery of pent (P-1), shirt (P-2),
Jogger (P-3), high neck T-shirt blue colour (P-4) belonging to
Muhammad Ahmad, deceased and also got recovered shoes (P-5)
and feeder (P-6) belonging to Muhammad Hashir, deceased which
were taken into possession vide recovery memo Ex.PC. As
mentioned earlier, according to the evidence of Dr. Liagat Ali,
APMO (PW.10), there were five injuries on the body of
Muhammad Hashir, deceased and bones under injuries No.1 to 4
were also found to be broken meaning thereby that multiple
grievous injuries were inflicted on the body of Muhammad Hashir,
deceased before his death which must have resulted into profused
bleeding but neither in the statement of Abdul Basit, PW.4 nor in
the recovery memo Ex.PC, it is mentioned that any of the above
mentioned recovered clothes/articles was stained with blood. It is
also noteworthy that the appellant has been acquitted from the
charges of abduction and murder of Muhammad Ahmad, deceased
by the learned trial Court and no appeal has been filed by the State
or the complainant against the acquittal of the appellant from the
said charges, therefore, the recovery of pent (P-1), shirt (P-2),
Jogger (P-3), high neck T-shirt blue colour (P-4) belonging to
Muhammad Ahmad, deceased allegedly recovered on the

pointation of Saqib Ali (appellant), is of no avail to the prosecution.

Insofar as the recovery of shoes (P-5) and feeder (P-6)

belonging to Muhammad Hashir, deceased is concerned, the said
Cri. Appeal No.671 of 2016 15
Crl. Revision No.839 of 2016

articles were not mentioned by the complainant in his complaint
Ex.PA. In complaint Ex.PA, the complainant alleged that his minor
son Muhammad Hashir, deceased was wearing trouser suite of sky
blue colour and pink jacket and although the said clothes have been
shown to be recovered in the recovery memo Ex.PC but the
recovery witness, namely, Abdul Basit (PW.4) while appearing in
the witness box did not state that any sky blue colour trouser suit or
pink jacket of Muhammad Hashir, deceased were recovered on the

pointation of the appellant.

In the light of above, the recoveries of shoes (P-5) and feeder
(P-6) of Muhammad Hashir deceased on the pointation of the
appellant are inconsequential for the prosecution. The learned trial
Court has also rightly disbelieved the prosecution evidence qua the
recovery of last worn clothes/articles of the deceased on the
pointation of the appellant in Paragraph No.29 of the impugned

judgment.

ili) Pointation of place of occurrence by the appellant.
Abdul Basit, PW.4 stated that on 28.12.2009, Saqib Ali,

appellant pointed out the place of occurrence of throwing
Muhammad Ahmad and Muhammad Hashir, deceased in the canal
but no incriminating material had been recovered on account of the
said pointation, therefore, the above mentioned piece of evidence is

not sufficient to convict the appellant.
iv) Motive

The prosecution evidence qua the motive has been produced.
through Muhammad Azam Butt, complainant (PW.5). He stated
that Saqib Ali, appellant was posing himself as a fake ‘Peer’ (Saint)
and he (appellant) used to entice his (complainant’s) family
members, therefore, he (complainant) forbade him from doing do
and due to the said grudge, the appellant committed murder of two
minor sons of the complainant. It is noteworthy that as per

prosecution case, it was Muhammad Azam Butt, complainant who
Cri. Appeal No.671 of 2016 16
Crl. Revision No.839 of 2016

forbade Saqib Ali, appellant from posing himself as a fake ‘Peer’
and enticing away his family members. It is not the prosecution
case that the minor children of the complainant, namely,
Muhammad Ahmad, aged about five years and Muhammad Hashir,
aged about three years, ever forbade the appellant from posing
himself as a fake ‘Peer’. If, for the sake of arguments the motive of
the prosecution is presumed to be correct then it was Muhammad
Azam Butt, complainant (PW.5) who should have been the prime
target of Saqib Ali, appellant because even, according to the
prosecution case itself, the appellant had no grudge against the
minors Muhammad Hashir and Muhammad Ahmad, therefore,
there was no reason with the appellant to commit their murder. It is
further noteworthy that Muhammad Azam Butt, complainant
(PW.5) also stated in his examination-in-chief that his family
members were enticed by the appellant while posing himself as a
fake ‘Peer’ but he did not name any such person who was enticed
away by the appellant. No family member of the complainant
appeared during the course of investigation or before the learned
trial Court in support of the above mentioned motive alleged by the
complainant. In the light of above, I hold that the motive alleged by
the prosecution has not been proved in this case and the same was
rightly disbelieved by the learned trial Court in paragraph No.25 of

the impugned judgment.

v) Medical evidence

The medical evidence in this case was produced by Dr.
Liaqat Ali, APMO (PW.10), who conducted postmortem
examination on the dead body of Muhammad Hashir, deceased on
08.12.2009. He noted five injuries on the body of Muhammad
Hashir, deceased and it was further observed that there were
fractures of bones under injuries No.1 to 4. According to his
opinion, the above mentioned injuries were ante mortem and
injuries No.1 to 4 were sufficient to cause death in the ordinary

course of nature. The time that elapsed between the injuries and
Cri. Appeal No.671 of 2016 17
Crl. Revision No.839 of 2016

death was immediate and the time that elapsed between the death
and postmortem examination was six to twelve days meaning
thereby that death of Muhammad Hashir, deceased took place
between 26.11.2009 to 02.12.2009. According to his opinion, the
injuries were inflicted on the body of Muhammad Hashir, deceased
by blunt means. As noted in Para No. 12(ii) of this judgment, there
was conflict between the medical evidence and the ocular account
of the prosecution produced through Muhammad Yaqoob, PW.3. It
is further noteworthy that according to the opinion of the Medical
Officer, the injuries on the body of Muhammad Hashir, deceased
were caused by blunt means but no weapon has been recovered
from the possession of the appellant. It is therefore, evident that the
medical evidence has not supported the prosecution case.
Moreover, it is by now well settled that medical evidence is a type
of evidence which tells about the probable time of death, the kind
of injuries, kind of weapon used in the occurrence but it would not
identify the assailant. Reliance in this respect may be placed on the
judgments reported as ‘Muhammad Tasaweer Vs Hafiz Zulkarnain
and 2 others’ (PLD 2009 SC 53), ‘Altaf Hussain Vs Fakhar
Hussain and another’ (2008 SCMR 1103) & ‘Mursal Kazmi alias
Qamar Shah and another Vs The State’ (2009 SCMR 1410).

16. Ihave considered all the aspects of this case and have come
to this irresistible conclusion that the prosecution evidence is full of
doubts. It is by now well settled that if there is a single
circumstance which creates reasonable doubt regarding the
prosecution case, the same is sufficient to give benefit of doubt to
the accused, whereas, the instant case is replete with number of
circumstances which have created serious doubts about the

truthfulness of the prosecution story.

In the case of, ‘Tarig Pervez Vs. The State’ (1995 SCMR
1345), the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, at page 1347, was

pleased to observe as under:-
Cri. Appeal No.671 of 2016 18
Crl. Revision No.839 of 2016

“Svecsuee The concept of benefit of doubt to an
accused person is deep-rooted in our country.
For giving him benefit of doubt, it is not
necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating doubts. If there is a
circumstance which creates reasonable doubt
in a prudent mind about the guilt of the
accused, then the accused will be entitled to
the benefit not as a matter of grace and
concession but as a matter of right.”

The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan while reiterating
the same principle in the case of “Muhammad Akram Vs. The

State” (2009 SCMR 230), at page 236, observed as under:-

“D3 ese It is an axiomatic principle of law
that in case of doubt, the benefit thereof must
accrue in favour of the accused as matter of
right and not of grace. It was observed by this
Court in the case of Tariq Pervez v. The State
1995 SCMR 1345 that for giving the benefit of
doubt, it was not necessary that there should
be many circumstances creating doubts. If
there is circumstance which created
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the
guilt of the accused, then the accused would be
entitled to the benefit of doubt not as a matter
of grace and concession but as a matter of
right.”

In the case of, “Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State” (2018
SCMR 772), the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, at page 778,

was pleased to observe as under:-

“Alia Needless to mention that while giving
the benefit of doubt to an accused it is not
necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating doubt. If there is a
circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in
a prudent mind about the guilt of the accused,
then the accused would be entitled to the benefit
of such doubt, not as a matter of grace and
concession, but as a matter of right. It is based
on the maxima, “it is better that ten guilty
persons be acquitted rather than one innocent

person be convicted”
Cri. Appeal No.671 of 2016 19
Crl. Revision No.839 of 2016

17. In the light of above discussion, I accept Criminal Appeal
No.671 of 2016 filed by Saqib Ali (appellant), set aside his
conviction and sentence recorded by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge, Lahore vide impugned judgment dated 09.03.2016
and acquit him of the charges under Sections 302(b) & 364-A PPC
by extending him the benefit of doubt. Sagib Ali (appellant) is in

custody, he be released forthwith, if not required in any other case.

18. Insofar the criminal revision i.e., Crl. Revision No.839 of
2016, filed by Muhammad Azam Butt (complainant) for
enhancement of sentence, awarded by the learned trial Court
against Saqib Ali (appellant) from imprisonment for life to death is
concerned, I have already disbelieved the prosecution evidence due
to the reasons mentioned in paragraph Nos.11 to 17 of this
judgment and Saqib Ali (appellant) has been acquitted by this Court
due to the reasons, mentioned therein, therefore, this criminal

revision being devoid of any force is hereby dismissed.
