Record by Mr. Afzal SI

SOHAIL NASIR, J. This criminal Appeal is directed against

judgment dated 18.08.2020 passed by learned Additional Sessions
Judge, Sohawa, District Jhelum on the basis of which Ghulam
Rasool (Appellant) was convicted under Section 302(b) PPC and
sentenced to life imprisonment. He was ordered to pay Rs. 300000/-
(three lacs) as compensation in terms of Section 544-A Cr.P.C to
the legal heirs of decease and in default thereof to further undergo
six months SI. Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C was also extended
to him. By way of same judgment Rukhsana Begum and Misbah
Bibi mother and sister of appellant having the role of abetment were
acquitted. The conviction is outcome of case FIR No. 117 (PE)
recorded on 02.08.2019 under Sections 302/311/109 PPC at Police
Station Domaili District Jhelum on the complaint of Muhammad
Iqbal/father of deceased (Pw-7) for the allegations of commission of
Qatl-e-Amd of Surayya Iqbal/wife of appellant.

2. Facts of the case are that Qamar Sultan SI (Pw-10) upon
receipt of information of the occurrence arrived at Pindori, where
Muhammad Iqbal (Pw-7) submitted an application (PG) and
maintained that he was retired from Army; he was employee as
security guard at Barkat Market Lahore; on that day (02.08.2019),

he received a telephone call from Muhammad Imran (Pw-8) that his
Criminal Appeal No.701 of 2020 2

daughter Surayya Iqbal was done to death by appellant; on this
information, he arrived there, where he found that dead body of
Surayya Iqbal was lying on a cot; he was told by Muhammad Imran
(Pw-8) and Haq Nawaz (Pw-9) that at about 07:30 am, they were
present outside the house of appellant, where they heard hue and
cry; they along with Khurram Shahzad (not produced) went inside
the house and saw that appellant was having an iron rod and trying
to assault Surayya Iqbal; the lady was running here and there in the
courtyard; they/the witnesses tried to sensitize the appellant, but of
no consequence; in the meantime, Surayya Iqbal entered in the room
and tried to bolt it but could not succeed; appellant gave repeated
blows with iron rod, which hit on different parts of the head of
Surayya Iqbal, who being injured fell on the cot and died there;
appellant while abusing had succeeded from there. The motive
alleged was family dispute between appellant and deceased and that
the appellant was having a suspicion on her. It was further alleged
that appellant committed the crime at the instance of his mother
Rukhsana Begum and sister Misbah Bibi alias Tayyaba.

3. Qamar Sultan SI, after his endorsement sent the complaint to
police station on the basis of which FIR (PE) was recorded by
Fayyaz Ahmad ASI (Pw-5).

4. During investigation, both female accused were arrested on
08.08.2019, whereas appellant was taken to task on 13.09.2019. On
conclusion of investigation report under Section 173 Cr.P.C
(Challan) was submitted in Court.

5. A charge under Sections 302/109 PPC was framed against
appellant and his co-accused for which they pleaded not guilty and
demanded their trial.

6. In support of its case, prosecution had produced Dr. Talia
Siddique (Pw-1), Saddam Hussain HC/Moharrar (Pw-2), Khalil
Ahmad Constable (Pw-3), Hasnat Ahmad (Pw-4), Fayyaz Ahmad
ASI/author of FIR (Pw-5), Asif Akhtar Naqash/draftsman (Pw-6),

Muhammad Iqbal/complainant (Pw-7), Imran Khan/eye witness
Criminal Appeal No.701 of 2020 3

(Pw-8), Haq Nawaz/eye witness (Pw-9) and Qamar Sultan SI
(Pw-10).

7. After the prosecution’s evidence was closed, appellant and his
co-accused were called for their examination under Section 342
Cr.P.C. Version of appellant was that he was falsely involved in this
case because Hasnat Ahmad son of complainant had divorced
his/appellant’s sister and for this reason complainant was inimical
towards him. Appellant opted not to appear in terms of Section
340(2) Cr.P.C however, he desired to produce defence evidence.
(The date of examination has been recorded as 17.02.2019, which in
fact as evident from order sheet is 17.02.2020).

8. Appellant moved an application for summoning of mobile
data of complainant and to produce it in his defence but that was
turned down vide an order dated 21.02.2020.

9. Learned counsel for appellant maintains that in this case the
most important evidence could be the CDR of complainant
Muhammad Iqbal and Imran Khan to establish that Imran had
informed the complainant about this occurrence but it was not taken
into possession; conduct of both eye witnesses was unnatural who
along with Khurram were present inside the house but they could
not restrain the appellant from assault to his wife who was having in
his hand only an iron rod; said unwanted conduct continued because
none of them bothered to inform the police about this occurrence;
they also appear to be chance witnesses as they could not give any
reason for their presence at crime scene; the children of appellant
and deceased were present at crime scene, but the Investigating
Officer did not bother to examine them who could be the best
witnesses of this case. He finally maintains that if the ocular account
is discarded, appellant cannot be convicted only on the reason that
he and his deceased wife were residing under one and the same roof
in the same house.

10. On the other hand learned DDPP contends, that two eye

witnesses of the occurrence were residing in the same area where
Criminal Appeal No.701 of 2020 4

this crime was committed by appellant; at the time of occurrence
appellant was supposed to be present in his house and nowhere else;
wife of appellant was found dead on the basis of physical violence,
but he did not bother to inform the police and he also disappeared
from crime scene; no enmity of the eye witnesses is there with
appellant therefore, question of false involvement does not arise;
medical evidence and recovery of iron rod are strong pieces of
evidence which corroborate the ocular account. She finally contends
that appellant has been convicted through a well reasoned judgment
which is not liable to be interfered.

11. HEARD.

12. Story started, when Imran Khan (Pw-8) informed Muhammad
Iqbal about this occurrence. Admittedly complainant was in Lahore
at that time. This information was given to him through a telephone
call by Imran Khan. Muhammad Iqbal in cross-examination
provided his mobile number 0342-4220742. He admitted that from
the record of concerned department mobile calls made to and
received from and location can be ascertained. According to him he
received call when he was present at Adda Thokar Niaz Baig, which
was at a distance of about 275 Kilometers from crime scene.

13. Qamar Sultan SI/IO (Pw-10), when asked in cross-
examination about CDR, he simply replied that he did not annex
mobile phone data either of complainant or Imran Khan to verify the
communication between them and to confirm their locations. It is
not understandable that when best available evidence through
modern device could be collected conveniently, why that was not
secured during the process of investigation? It was one of the
qualitative evidence in support of complainant’s version that Imran
Khan had informed him on telephone about the incident.

14. This risk was taken by appellant, when he moved an
application for summoning of CDR to be produced in his defence
but unfortunately he was unsuccessful. If the story given by

complainant was correct, then to contest that application was
Criminal Appeal No.701 of 2020 5

beyond imaginations. This clearly shows that there was something
wrong which prosecution was avoiding to be brought before the
Court.

15. The conduct of Imran Khan (Pw-8) and Haq Nawaz (Pw-9)
remained unnatural throughout on various reasons. Firstly, they
along with Khurram Shahzad were present in the house of appellant
and all they three were in a position to stop him for assaulting
Surayya Iqbal, but according to them they simply tried to sensitize
the appellant, with no positive result. Secondly occurrence took
place at 07:30 am but none of them ever bothered to inform the
police till the arrival of complainant Muhammad Iqbal who reached
there at 11:00/11:30 am. Even thereafter neither Muhammad Iqbal
nor they considered it necessary to call the police because Qamar
Sultan SI in his statement specifically said that he arrived at crime
scene on receiving information through Moharrar and none else.

16. Itis an admitted fact that Muhammad Iqbal complainant was
residing in the same locality where the occurrence took place but he
had to be in Lahore because of his employment there. In cross-
examination Muhammad Iqbal (Pw-7) replied that: -

“My wife Tasleem Kousar and my son
Hasnat along with other relatives were
already present at the place of occurrence
when I reached there.”

17. The conduct of real mother and real brother of deceased also
remained questionable as they too did not feel appropriate to inform
the Police for the reason best known to them.

18. Keeping in view what has been deliberated above, this Court
finds no difficulty now to declare Imran Khan and Haq Nawaz as
chance witnesses despite the fact that they were residing in the same
vicinity. House of Imran Khan (Pw-8) was at a distance of about
half kilometer from crime scene and of Haq Nawaz at about 250
meters from there. Although Imran Khan said that he was standing

in front of house of his sister that was opposite to crime scene, but
Criminal Appeal No.701 of 2020 6

he could not furnish any reason that why he came there on that day
at the given time and same infirmity is there in the statement of Haq
Nawaz who was also mum about the cause of his presence in front
of the venue of crime.

19. All three witnesses arrived at crime scene at a time when the

occurrence had almost started. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of

6

State through Advocate General _ Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa vs. Hassan Jalil & others 2019 SCMR 1154’ in

Pakistan in

such situation was pleaded to observe that: -

“Arrival of Noor Seema, PW at venue
exactly at a point of time when the
respondent allegedly did away with the
deceased, in itself is a circumstance that
reflects on the very genesis of the
prosecution case”

20. Same view finds support from ‘Muhammad Imran vs. The

State 2020 SCMR 857’ where it was observed that: -

“These contradictions, viewed in the
retrospect of arrival of the witnesses
exactly at a point of time when the
petitioner started inflicting blows to the
deceased with their inability to apprehend
him without there being any weapon to
keep them effectively at bay, cast shadows
on the hypothesis of their presence during
the fateful moments ”

21. The day of occurrence was the one when schools were closed
due to summer vacations and it was admitted by Haq Nawaz (Pw-9).
Ahmed Gul Nawaz (10% years) and Adil Gul Nawaz (9 years) were
the two sons of appellant and deceased beside another aged about
one year. Focusing the time of occurrence that was 07:30 am, they
were supposed to be present in their house and in this context
conduct of Qamar Sultan SI/IO has been found malafide and
dishonest. In cross-examination he responded as under: -

“IT do not know whether these three
children of deceased were present in the
house at the time of occurrence. I did not
Criminal Appeal No.701 of 2020 7

join these three children in my
investigation, volunteered that they were
minors. I had a meeting with these three
children during my investigation. None of
these children disclosed any fact about
this occurrence”

22. Investigation has been defined under Section 4(1)) of Cr.P.C

that is as under: -

“Investigation" includes all the
proceedings under this Code for the
collection of evidence conducted by a
police officer or by any person (other than
a Magistrate) who is authorised by a
Magistrate in this behalf

23. In ‘Mst. Sughran Bibi vs. The State PLD 2018 SC 595’
while referring the Police Rules, 1943 it was observed by the apex

Court that: -

“During the investigation the investigating
officer is obliged to investigate the matter
from all possible angles while keeping in
view all the versions of the incident
brought to his notice and, as required by
Rule 25.2(3) of the Police Rules, 1934 “Tt
is the duty of an investigating officer to
find out the truth of the matter under
investigation. His object shall be to
discover the actual facts of the case and to
arrest the real offender or offenders. He
shall not commit himself prematurely to
any view of the facts for or against any
person”

24. The duty of an Investigating Officer, therefore is to discover

the truth irrespective the fact that what the parties, rival to each

other, have the claims. Once evidence is collected, it is to be

produced before the Court who in due course after judicial scrutiny

of entire material has to arrive at a just decision of the case. Two

sons were the best witnesses of the occurrence. The Investigating

Officer advanced a lame excuse that they were minors. Law does
Criminal Appeal No.701 of 2020 8

not prohibit recording of statement of a minor unless there are
compelling circumstance to do otherwise. Therefore, most important
evidence in this case has been kept away from the Court deliberately
which has made adverse effects on prosecutions’ case.

25. The conduct of complainant is also found malafide and unfair
who involved Rukhsana Begum and Misbah Bibi on the allegations
of abetment but during investigation, he could not produce even an
iota of evidence against them.

26. Coming to the medical evidence, Dr. Talia Siddique (Pw-1)
had conducted the post mortem examination of deceased who found
four lacerated wounds on right ear, right tempro, left lateral head
and below left eye. It is settled principle of law that medical
evidence is at the most a confirmatory proof, which does not
identify the culprit. It simply indicates nature of injuries, kind of
weapon used, duration between injuries and death as well as
between death and post mortem. In ‘Hashim Qasim & another vs.
the State 2017 SCMR 986” the honorable Supreme Court of
Pakistan on this subject was pleased to hold that: -

“The medical evidence is _ only
confirmatory or of supporting nature and
is never held to be  corroboratory
evidence, to identify the culprit(s)”

27. Therefore, once ocular account of this is disbelieved, medical
evidence shall be of no consequence for prosecution.

28. Coming to recovery it too requires no detail discussion. On
spot inspection Qamar Sultan SI had taken into possession an iron
rod (P7) vide a memo (PK). During investigation, on 16.09.2019
according to prosecution, appellant led to the place of occurrence
and pointed that he had thrown the iron rod there. As this was not a
disclosure of any distinct fact because iron rod was already
recovered from there on 08.02.2019, hence this portion of evidence

shall also play no role in favour of prosecution. In ‘Naveed Asghar
Criminal Appeal No.701 of 2020 9

& 2 others vs. The State PLD 2021 SC 600’ about the value of
recovery in such circumstances it was held that: -

“Recovery of weapon of offence is only a
corroborative piece of evidence; and in
absence of substantive evidence, it is not
considered sufficient to hold the accused
person guilty of the offence charged. When
substantive evidence fails to connect the
accused person with the commission of
offence or is disbelieved, corroborative
evidence is of no help to the prosecution
as the corroborative evidence cannot by
itself prove the prosecution case”

29. On perusal of the statements of all relevant witnesses, this
Court finds no difficulty to hold that the motive has also not been
proved in this case. Appellant and his wife were residing together
for the last more than 10 years having three children and there is
nothing in evidence that earlier to the occurrence there was any kind
of dispute between them.

30. So prosecution remains only with the evidence that dead body
was found in a house where appellant and deceased were residing
under the same rood. The principles do not allow recording of
conviction on presumptions however strong may be. Prosecution in
all circumstances is under strict obligation to prove its case
independently but not at the strength of weakness of defence. In
‘Nasrullah alias Nasro vs. The State 2017 SCMR 724’ in similar
circumstances it was held: -

“Be that as it may holding by this Court
that some part of the onus lies on the
accused person in such a case does not
mean that the entire burden of proof shifts
to the accused person in a case of this
nature. It has already been clarified by
this Court in the case of Abdul Majeed v.
The State (2011 SCMR 941) that the
prosecution is bound to prove its case
against an accused person beyond
reasonable doubt at all stages of a
criminal case and in a case where the
Usman

Criminal Appeal No.701 of 2020 10

prosecution asserts presence of some eye-
witnesses and such claim of the
prosecution is not established by it there
the accused person could not be convicted
merely on the basis of a presumption that
since the murder of his wife had taken
place in his house, therefore, it must be he
and none else who would have committed
that murder ”

31. Same view finds support from ‘Arshad Khan vs. The State
2017 SCMR 564, Nazeer Ahmed vs. The State 2016 SCMR 1628
and Asad Khan vs. The State PLD 2017 SC 681’.

32. Concluding the discussion made above I hold that prosecution
has badly failed to prove its case beyond shadow of doubt,
therefore, this appeal is allowed. Impugned judgment dated
18.08.2020 is set aside. Ghulam Rasool appellant is acquitted from
the case. He is in custody and he shall be released forthwith, if not
required in any other case. The case property shall be dealt with in

the same manners as directed by learned trial Court.
