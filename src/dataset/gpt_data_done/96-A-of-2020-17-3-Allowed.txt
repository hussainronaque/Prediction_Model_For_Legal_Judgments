JUDGMENT

AHMAD ALI. Through the instant petition,
petitioner Aurangzeb alias Billu S/o Lal Akbar, seeks
his post arrest bail in case FIR No. 28 dated
13.05.1991 u/s 17(3) Haraba/512 Cr.P.C, P.S. Doonga
Gali, Abbottabad.

2. Brief facts of the case are that
Muhammad Anwar S/o Haji Ameer Alam reported the
matter to the local police of Police Station Doonga
Gali, Abbottabad that he runs carry van bearing No.
ADB-1875 Model 1990 as taxi. On the preceding night
at about 10:00 PM, he was present at Lari Adda,
Abbottabad. Meanwhile four unknown persons booked

him from Abbottabad to village Riala in lieu of Rs.
400/- as rent. He took them to Riala where, after
staying for a while, they returned towards Abbottabad.
In the way, they forcibly took him to Jungle where the
complainant was tied with a tree and wrapped a
chaddar on his mouth. All the four accused took away
the Suzuki carry van along with registration book,
driving license and CNIC of the complainant.
Complainant was untied by the locals a Fajar Azan
Vela who brought him to police station for the
registration of FIR, hence the instant case.

3. I have heard arguments of learned counsel
for the parties, learned AAG for the State and have
gone through the record.

4. Perusal of record reveals that the
accused/petitioner was not named in the FIR, rather
the complainant identified him through his
photograph, but the accused/petitioner could not be
arrested in the instant case till 11.11.2019. Pertinent to
mention here that the statement under Section 164
Cr.P.C of the complainant was recorded on
11.12.2019, after about 28 long years of the
occurrence wherein he charged the accused/petitioner
along with other co-accused, however, even after

arrest of the accused/petitioner and his sufficient
police custody, no incriminating recovery could be
effected from him nor he lead the police party to the
place of occurrence for the purpose of pointation.

5. Moreover, though the complainant was able to
identify the accused/petitioner in the identification
parade conducted by the learned Senior Civil Judge,
Abbottabad on 26.11.2019, but identification of the
accused/petitioner after lapse of about 28 log years
also creates a question which can only be resolved
after recording prosecution evidence. The offence for
which accused/petitioner stands charged, falls under
the prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C. but
except mere statement of the complainant, there is no
incriminating evidence against the accused/petitioner
to prima-facie connect him with the commission of
alleged offence at this stage.

6. Besides, the record is silent regarding
previous history of conviction or involvement of
petitioner in such like cases. Petitioner is behind the
bars since his arrest and no more required to the local
police for further investigation

7. So far as, contention of the learned
AAG in respect of long abscondence of the accused-

petitioner is concerned, same will hold no field in the
circumstances, when case of the accused, squarely
falls within the ambit of Sub-Section (2) of Section
497 Cr.P.C, calling for further probe. It is by now
settled that in any case falling within the above ambit;
the grant of bail must be considered as a rule and
refusal thereof is an exception. However, in the instant
case, no exceptional circumstance exists to refuse bail
to the accused, when the other circumstances,
tentatively are in his favour. Reliance can be placed on
case laws reported in 2018 MLD 125, PLJ 2017 SC
115, 2016 SCMR 1520, 2016 SCMR 1593, PLD
2012 SC 222, 2015 P.Cr.L.J 1005 & 2012 YLR
2090.

8. Moreover, it has been held time and again
by the august Supreme Court that bail does not mean
acquittal of accused but only change of custody from
Government agencies to the sureties, who on
furnishing bonds take responsibility to produce the
accused whenever and wherever required to be
produced. Reliance could be placed on case reported in
2008 SCMR 807 “Haji Muhammad Nazir Vs State”.
9. Before parting with this order, this court finds it
necessary to mention that all the observations recorded

above are tentative assessment just for the disposal of
bail petition and not intended to influence the mind of
trial Court, which is free to appraise the evidence
strictly in accordance with law and merits of the case
and; as per law laid down in (1996 SCMR 1845).

10. For what has been discussed above and on
tentative assessment of material available on file, a
case arguable for the grant of bail is made out.
Consequently, instant bail petition is allowed and the
petitioner, named above, is admitted to bail provided
he furnishes bail bonds to the tune of Rs.100,000/-
(One lac) with two sureties each in the like amount to
the satisfaction of learned Illaqa/Duty Judicial
Magistrate concerned, who shall ensure that the
sureties are local, reliable and men of means.
