ORDER

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANT, J.-Petitioner

Afridi Khan, seeks bail in case FIR No.530 dated

23.08.2015, registered under sections 302/34 PPC, in

Police Station Sarband, wherein he alongwith absconding

co-accused Mazhar and Inayat is charged for committing

the Qatl-i-amd of Muhammad Sagqib deceased son of

complainant Farash Khan on 23.08.2015 at 18.45 hours

near his house with firearm on a motive of land dispute.

2. Arguments heard and record perused.

3. Admittedly, complainant Farash Khan is not the

eyewitness of the incident while PW Mst. Gul Shajara and

Mst. Shabana the alleged eyewitnesses have specifically

assigned the role of firing at the deceased to absconding

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

co-accused Inayat, in their statements under section 161

Cr.P.C. Similar position has also been shown in the site

plan where the role of firing has been attributed to

absconding co-accused Inayat. The question of common

intention is a state of mind of an accused, which cannot be

determined without recording evidence, when he has not

actively participated in the crime, therefore, in the

circumstances common intention of the petitioner with the

absconding co-accused/ principal accused in_ the

commission of offence is yet to be determined during trial

after recording evidence. At the moment, on tentative

assessment of the material available on _ record,

participation of the petitioner in the commission of offence

requires further probe into his guilt. It is settled law that

bail may not be refused merely on the ground that accused

is directly charged in the F.I.R for a heinous offence, when

otherwise, he is found entitled for concession of bail

because mistaken relief of bail, can be repaired by

convicting the accused, if proved guilty at the trial, but no

proper reparation can be offered for his unjustified

incarceration, albeit, his acquittal in the long run.

4. For the above reasons, this petition is

allowed. Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he

furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two

local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like

amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial

Magistrate/MOD concerned.
