ORDER

Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, J.: According to the prosecution
respondent No. 1 and three others (Proclaimed Offenders) had

collectively fired at Zard Ali deceased and Asghar Jan complainant
(PW8) and had injured them. The medical evidence showed that all
the four injuries sustained by the deceased and the complainant
were of the same size and dimension and, thus, it could well be a
case of a single accused firing at and injuring the deceased and the
complainant. Asghar Jan complainant (PW8) had a motive to
falsely implicate respondent No. 1 and, thus, exaggeration by him
to the extent of respondent No. 1 could not safely be ruled out of
consideration. Liaqat Ali (PW9) was the other eyewitness produced
by the prosecution but we note that there was a visible

interpolation in the Murasila qua the said witness and, thus, it

could well be that he had been falsely introduced in this case as an
eyewitness. Apart from that Liaqat Ali (PW9) was a related and
chance witness who had failed to establish the stated reason for
his availability with the deceased through any independent
evidence. Apparently respondent No. 1 had no connection with the
alleged motive and during the investigation no weapon had been
recovered from his custody. For all these reasons the High Court
had concluded that the prosecution had failed to prove its case
against respondent No. 1 beyond reasonable doubt and we have
not been able to take any legitimate exception to the said
conclusion reached by the High Court. This petition is, therefore,

dismissed and leave to appeal is refused.
