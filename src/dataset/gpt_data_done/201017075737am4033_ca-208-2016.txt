JUDGMENT

Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, J.: Zakirullah appellant had
allegedly been apprehended while driving a tractor-trolley and from
some secret cavities of the said vehicle Charas Pukhta weighing 62
kilograms contained in 62 separate packets had been recovered
whereafter 62 samples taken from the recovered substance were
tested positive by the Chemical Examiner. With the said allegations
the appellant was booked in case FIR No. 511 registered at Police
Station Badaber, Peshawar on 28.05.2012 and after a regular trial
he was convicted by the trial court for an offence under section 9(c)

of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 and was sentenced

to imprisonment for life and to pay fine. The appellant challenged
his conviction and sentence before the High Court through an
appeal which was dismissed and his conviction and sentence
recorded by the trial court were upheld and maintained. Hence,

the present appeal by leave of this Court granted on 22.04.2016.

2. Leave to appeal had been granted in this case in order to
reappraise the evidence and with the assistance of the learned

counsel for the parties we have undertaken that exercise.

3. We have straightaway noticed that the Moharrir of the
relevant Police Station to whom the recovered substance had been
handed over for safe custody soon after its recovery had neither
been produced before the trial court as a prosecution witness nor
his statement under section 161, Cr.P.C. had been recorded by the
investigating officer and this was so confirmed by Liaqat Ali, S.I.
(PW3) before the trial court. The said investigating officer had also
deposed before the trial court that one Ihsan Ullah, F.C. had taken
the samples of the recovered substance to the office of the
Chemical Examiner for analysis and it is not denied that even the
said Ihsan Ullah, F.C. had not been produced before the trial court
as a prosecution witness and even his statement under section
161, Cr.P.C. had not been recorded during the investigation. The
name of Ihsan Ullah, F.C. did not even find any mention in the
report of the Chemical Examiner brought on the record of this
case. It is, thus, obvious that neither safe custody of the recovered
substance nor safe transmission of the samples of the recovered
substance had been established by the prosecution before the trial
court. It has already been held by this Court in the cases of Amjad
Ali v. The State (2012 SCMR 577) and Ikramullah and others v. The
State (2015 SCMR 1002) that in a case where safe custody or safe

transmission of the recovered substance or samples is not
established there it cannot be concluded with any degree of
certainty that the prosecution had succeeded in establishing its
case against an accused person. The case in hand is not different

4

from the above mentioned precedent cases in this respect.
