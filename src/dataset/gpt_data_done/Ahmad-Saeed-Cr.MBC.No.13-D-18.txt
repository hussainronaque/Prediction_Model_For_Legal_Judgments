SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- Through the instant petition
filed under Section 497(5) Cr.PC, the petitioner seeks
cancellation of post arrest bail of the respondents No.1 to
6 in case FIR No.279 dated 09.6.2017 registered under
Sections 411/379/427/447/506 PPC at Police Station
Paroa, District D.I.Khan.

2. It is argued by the learned counsel for the
petitioner that the accused/respondents have specifically
been charged in the FIR for commission of offence; that
there are reasonable grounds to believe that the accused
have committed a non bailable offence, therefore, they do

not deserve the concession of bail; that the bail granting

order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate is patently
illegal; that the learned Additional Sessions Judge without
considering the implicating material dismissed the
application for cancellation of bail, illegally, therefore,
warrants interference.

3. As against that, the learned counsel
representing the respondents No.1 to 6 argued that the
offence with which the accused/respondents are charged is
not covered by the restrictive clause of Section 497 Cr.PC;
that there is nothing on the record to show that the bail
granting order is perverse and patently illegal; that there is
no allegation of misuse of concession of bail and prayed
for dismissal of the petition.

4. Learned Asstt: A.G. representing the State

supported the contention of the learned counsel for the

respondents.
5. Arguments heard and record perused.
6. Perusal of the record reflects that the alleged

offence was committed on 28.5.2017, and report was
lodged by the complainant on 29.5.2017. There is
inordinate delay in lodging the report. The offence with
which the respondents are charged is not hit by the
restrictive clause of Section 497 Cr.PC.

7. It is now settled that bail in cases not falling

within the prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.PC, is a

rule and refusal thereof is an exception. In this respect
reliance may be placed on the cases of “Mst. Shezan
Sanaullah_Vs.__State” (2006 P Cr.LJ 522) and
“Muhammad Akram Vs. State” (2009 P Cr.LJ 497.
8. Moreover, neither the plea of misuse of the
concession of bail was taken nor urged before the Court.
There is nothing on the record to show that the impugned
orders are perverse or illegal or without jurisdiction. It is
settled law that when bail is granted by a Court of
competent jurisdiction on the basis of valid reasons, the
same cannot be recalled/cancelled until exceptional
grounds are established by the complainant/prosecution.
In this respect reliance is placed on “Mst. Riffat Munir
Vs. Naveed Zafar and another” (2016 P Cr.LJ 464).
Learned counsel for the petitioner failed to
point out that the bail granting order was either perverse or
disregard of settled principles for granting the bail or that
the discretion exercised in favour of the respondents is
injudicious.
9. For what has been stated above, the petition in

hand being bereft of merit is dismissed.
