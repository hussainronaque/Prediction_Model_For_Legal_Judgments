fine of Rs.25000/- (twenty five

he was ordered to further undergo 5
months and 15 days S.I.

2. It was directed that sentences of appellant shall run
concurrently and benefit of Section 382-B%, Cr.P.C% shall be
available to him. The conviction is ultimate result of the
prosecution that appellant has faced in case FIR* No. 82
(PC) recorded on 05.04.2020 under Section 9(c) of the Act at
Police Station Makhdoom Pur district Khanewal.

3. In brief prosecution’s case was that on 05.04.2020 at
about 03:40 pm, from the area of ‘Mouza Kot Abdullah’
appellant was arrested and from his possession Heroin
weighing 5324 grams and ‘Charas’ weighing 2680 grams were
recovered.

4. As evident from opening paragraph of this judgment,
appellant has been convicted on two counts, one for recovery
of Heroin and other for possessing the ‘Charas’. On

suspension of sentences file by appellant came up for hearing,
the following order was passed by this Court: -

“We have observed that in this case from the

grams and Charas weighing 2680 grams was

2. The legal question before us is that if more
than one kind of contraband is recovered from
an accused whether it shall be deemed to be a
single recovery of contraband as Section 9-C
of CNSA 1997 provides the punishment
without describing the nature and kind of
contraband.

3. We therefore, direct both the sides to assist
the Court on this legal proposition. For better
assistance and to arrive at an authoritative
decision we appoint Syed Muhammad Badar
Gillani Advocate as Amicus Curiae who is
present in Court and has been informed
accordingly.”

5. Syed Badar Raza Gillani learned Amicus Curiae%,
Mr. Khalid Iban-i-Aziz Advocate for ANF’, Mr. Ashfaq
Ahmad Malik Deputy Prosecutor General, Rana Muhammad
Asif Saeed and Mr. Tahir Hussain Khan Malazai Advocates
for appellant jointly contended that as under Section 9(c) of the
Act no distinction has been drawn with regard to variant of
material recovered from an offender and that the slab for
sentences are only with reference to quantity therefore, if an
accused is found in possession of more than one kinds of
contraband, that shall be deemed to be single recovery and
accused cannot be convicted for each kind separately.

6. HEARD.

7. To resolve the proposition involved, we have to examine
the scheme of the law. The Act was promulgated on 07" July,
1997 with a preamble to consolidate and amend the laws
relating to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and
control the production, processing and trafficking of such
drugs and substances. It was for that reason that by way of

Section 78 of the Act, The Opium Act, 1857 (XIII of 1857),

° It’s a Latin word that means "Friend of the Court"

7 Anti Narcotics Force
Criminal Appeal No.654 of 2020 4
Haider Ali vs. The State & another

The Opium Act, 1878 (I of 1878), The Dangerous Drugs Act,
1930 (II of 1930) and the Control of Narcotic Substances
Ordinance, 1997 (XLIII of 1997) were repealed and at the
same time under Section 76 the provisions of the Act were
stated to have effect notwithstanding anything contained in any
other law for the time being in force. It means that every case
with regard to narcotic drug, psychotropic substance or
controlled substance shall be governed under the provisions of
the Act.

8. For more effective discussions, Section 9 of the Act is
reproduced as under: -

“9. Punishment for contravention of Section
6, 7 and 8: Whoever contravenes the
provisions of Sections 6, 7 or 8 shall be
punishable with---

(a) imprisonment which may extend to two
years, or with fine, or with both, if the quantity
of the narcotic drug, psychotropic substance
or controlled substance is one hundred grams
or less;

(b) imprisonment which may extend to seven
years and shall also be liable to fine, if the
quantity of the narcotic drug, psychotropic
substance or controlled substance exceeds one
hundred grams but does not exceed one
kilogram;

(c) death or imprisonment for life, or
imprisonment for a term which may extend to
fourteen years and shall also be liable to fine
which may be up to one million rupees, if the
quantity of narcotic drug, psychotropic
substance or controlled substance exceeds the
limits specified in clause (b):

Provided that if the quantity exceeds ten
kilograms the punishment shall not be less than
imprisonment for life”

9. Plain reading of the above referred Section of law

provides the consequences in case of contravention of the
Criminal Appeal No.654 of 2020 5
Haider Ali vs. The State & another

provisions of Sections 6, 7 and 8 which for better

understanding are also reproduced as under: -

“

6. Prohibition of possession of narcotic
drugs, etc: No one shall produce,

manufacture, extract, prepare, possess, offer
for sale, sell, purchase, distribute, deliver on
any terms whatsoever, transport, dispatch, any
narcotic drug, psychotropic substance or
controlled substance, except for medical,
scientific or industrial purposes in the manner
and subject to such conditions as may be
specified by or under this Act or any other law
for the time being in force.

7. Prohibition of import or export of narcotic
drugs, etc: (1) No one shall---

(a) import into Pakistan

(b) export from Pakistan

(c) transport within Pakistan

(d) tranship any narcotic drug, psychotropic
substance or controlled substance save in
accordance with rules made under subsection
(2) and in accordance with the conditions of
any licence, permit or authorization for that
purpose which may be required to be obtained
under those rules.

(2) The Federal Government may make rules
permitting and regulating the import into and
export from Pakistan, transport within
Pakistan and transhipment of narcotic drugs,
Psychotropic _ substance or controlled
substances, and such rules may prescribe the
ports or places at which any kind of narcotic
drug, psychotropic substance or controlled
substance may be imported, exported,
transported within Pakistan or transhipped,
the form and conditions of licence, permit or
authorities by which such licences, permits or
authorization may be granted, the fees that
may be charged therefore, any other matter
required to have effective control of the
Federal Government over such import, export,
transportation and transhipment.

8. Prohibition on trafficking or financing the

trafficking of narcotic drugs, etc: No one
Shall---
Criminal Appeal No.654 of 2020 6
Haider Ali vs. The State & another

(a) organize, manage, traffic in, or finance the
import, transport, manufacturing or trafficking

of, narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances or
controlled substances; or

(b) use violence or arms for committing or
attempt to commit an offence punishable under
this Act.

10. In all the earlier quoted provisions of the Act, three kinds
of contraband have been shown as: -

> Narcotic Drugs
> Psychotropic Substances and
> Controlled Substances

11. All these kinds have been defined under Section 2 of the
Act as follows: -

“2(k) “controlled substance” means any
substance which may be used for the
production or manufacture of narcotic drugs
or psychotropic substance;

2(s) “Narcotic drug” means coca leaf,
cannabis, heroin, opium, poppy straw and all
manufactured drugs;

2(z-a) “psychotropic substance” means the
substance, specified in the Schedule to this Act,

and such substances as the Federal
Government may, by notification in the official
Gazette, declare to be a_ psychotropic
substance”

12. The study of Section 9 of the Act does not make any
distinction that in case of which variant (Narcotic Drugs,
Psychotropic Substances, Controlled Substances) what will be the
amount of punishment like we have noticed under Article 4 of
The Prohibition (Enforcement _of Hadd) Order, 1979 where in
case of specific quantity of intoxicant the punishment is similar
but once exceeds the punishment varies keeping in view the

kind of material. It is as under: -
Criminal Appeal No.654 of 2020 7
Haider Ali vs. The State & another

“4. Owning or possessing _intoxicant.
Whoever owns, possesses or keeps in his

custody any intoxicant shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term,
which may extend to two years, or with
whipping not exceeding thirty stripes, and shall
also be liable to fine:

Provided that nothing contained in this Article
shall apply to a non-Muslim foreigner or to a
non-Muslim citizen of Pakistan who keeps in
his custody at or about the time of a ceremony
prescribed by his religion a reasonable
quantity of intoxicating liquor for the purpose
of using it as a part of such ceremony:
Provided further _that_if the intoxicant in
respect _of which the offence is committed _is
heroin, cocaine, opium or coca leaf, and the
quantity exceeds ten grams in the case of
heroin or cocaine or one kilogram in the case
of opium or coca leaf, the offender shall be
punishable with imprisonment for life or with

imprisonment which is not less than two years
and with whipping not exceeding thirty stripes,

and shall also be liable to fine”’
(Emphasis applied)

13. “Neminem opertet legibus esse sapientiorem’ is a Latin
phrase that means “‘no man ought to be wiser than the laws” so
it cannot be said that while making the Act the legislatures were
not cognizant of the situation. If they had to limit the sentence
in the light of any specific material/kind they were supposed to
specify it clearly as has been observed under the provisions of
the Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979 (ibid).
Therefore, in case of various type of contraband no distinction
is there under Section 9 of the Act however the discretion has
been left at the court for quantum of sentence if quantity does
not exceed 10 kilograms, who keeping in view the kind of
recovered material, its effect on human lives and society or
other considerations as the case may be, has to ascertain the

amount of punishment and it is needless to say that sentencing
Criminal Appeal No.654 of 2020 8
Haider Ali vs. The State & another

is not an easy process but difficult stage for a judge and is an
attempt to juggle the objects of various sizes while walking on
a tight rope which is being shaken at both ends.

14. We, therefore, feel no difficulty to hold that in case of
recovery of contraband of more than one kind, it will be
considered single recovery against an offender with
accumulative weight.

15. The next question is with regard to determination of
period of imprisonment in view of sentencing policy’. The
legality of the Judgment passed in Ghulam Murtaza case is under
consideration before the Honourable Supreme Court of
Pakistan? which appears to have been suspended as evident
from copy of an order dated 31.08.2009 passed in Criminal
Appeal No. 218-L of 2009. For the sake of arguments, if it is
presumed that still the sentencing policy holds the field, even
then question is not difficult to be answered for the reason that
the said policy does not cover the proposition in hand, like in
the case of ‘Amphatamine’ (ICE), so it will be within the
discretion of the court to determine that what the quantum of
sentence has to be keeping in view the features of each case.
16. Coming to the merits of the case although various
contentions have been raised by learned counsel for appellant
like that chain of safe custody has been not been proved and
summoning of record of ‘Roznamcha’ of the Police Station
with reference to report dated 08.04.2020 but as the learned
trial court has committed serious illegality while convicting the
appellant on two counts therefore, all concerned to the matter
are in agreement that it is a case of remand. Therefore, this

Criminal Appeal is allowed. Impugned judgment is set_aside.

* Ghulam Murtaza & another vs. The State PLD 2009 Lahore 362

No. 905-L-2009
Criminal Appeal No.654 of 2020 9
Haider Ali vs. The State & another

The case is remanded back to the learned trial court with
direction to rewrite the judgment after giving a proper right of
hearing to both the sides by attending and responding all the
contentions to be raised by them and without being influenced

from its earlier judgment.
