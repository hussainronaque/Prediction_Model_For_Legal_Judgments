JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- The State through

Advocate General has filed the instant appeal against the
judgment and order dated 04.12.2019 passed by learned Judge,
Special Court/ Sessions Judge, Kohat, whereby the accused-
respondent Shahid Hussain, involved in a case FIR No. 211,
dated 03.08.2017 under section 9 (c ) CNSA of Police Station,
Usterzai, District Kohat, was acquitted.

2. Facts of the case, precisely, as obvious from the record,
are that on 03.08.2017 Abdur Rauf SHO, Police Station,
Usterzai, (PW-2) along with other police party was on patrol
duty of the Illaqa, when at 11.00 hours a person on seeing the
police party from a sufficient distance started running, who
was chased but he succeeded in his escape, however, during
search of the nearby area, the police recovered a_ plastic
envelope containing 3600 grams chars coupled with a mobile
set having V-Fone SIM as well as a Q model phone having
SIM No. 0336-9296277. The SHO drafted murasilla in this
respect, which was sent to the Police Station through constable
Akbar Khan for registration of case against an unknown

accused, consequently, the present case FIR, Exh.PA was
registered against an unknown accused. After registration of
the case, copy of the FIR was entrusted to Muhammad Azam
SI (PW-6), who visited the spot and prepared the site plan
Ex. PB at the instance of the complainant. He obtained CDR
data of SIM No. 0336-9296277 and on the basis of which the
present respondent was nominated as an accused. He was
arrested in the case and after completion of investigation;
complete challan was submitted before the Court of learned
Sessions Judge/ Judge, Special Court, Kohat, where, at the
commencement of trial, the prosecution produced seven
witnesses. On close of the prosecution evidence, the accused-
respondent was examined under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein
he denied the charges, professed innocence and stated to have
falsely been implicated in the case. He, however, wished to
produce no defence nor to examine himself on oath as required
under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. The learned trial court, on
conclusion of the trial, acquitted the respondent-accused, vide
judgment herein impugned.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4, Admittedly, neither the alleged illegal stuff has been
recovered from the direct possession of the accused-
respondent nor he is shown arrested on the spot. It is also
definite that neither his name is mentioned in the FIR nor his
feature is available in it. According to the prosecution story,
the SIM recovered from the spot was registered in the name of
accused-respondent, therefore, he was arrested in the case. The
Seizing Officer (PW-2) and marginal witness to the recovery

memo Exh.PW 1/1/ in their cross examinations categorically
stated that they were unable to see the face of accused-
respondent as his back was towards them, therefore, his
description and feature was not given in the Murasilla, thus,
the entire case of the prosecution is based on the CDR data of
SIM No. 0336-9296277. In the backdrop, it is to be seen as to
whether it was the accused-respondent, who had thrown the
subject articles, whether the SIM number was registered in his
name and whether the CDR data is sufficient for the
conviction of the accused.

5. Call detail record (CDR) is a data, which includes
information like, how many calls a person has made, to which
number, time and duration of calls and from which tower the
person received network while making the particular call. It is
secondary evidence which can be taken into consideration
provided the same is accurate and exclusion of any possibility
of tempering or manipulation. We have perused the record and
found nothing on record to show that the SIM relied by the
prosecution was registered in the name of the accused-
respondent. In the CDR data, marked as Exh. PW 6/5, though,
the particulars, i.e., SIM number, name of accused-respondent
with CNIC number coupled with FIR number of the case are
mentioned but it has neither been attested, endorsed, stamped
and signed by the responsible official of the concerned
Cellular Company nor the official, who had prepared/taken out
the same from the Computer, has been associated or produced
before the Court to testify that it was issued by him. There is
no explanation as to how the I.O obtained the CDR data

marked as Ex PW 6/5 from the concerned Cellular Company
as there is no application for obtaining the requisite data from
the Company, except the recovery memo Ex PW 6/1, in which
process too official of the concerned company has not been
associated. It is also interesting to note that the CDR data also
bearing the FIR number and name of the Police Station and if
it is printed out from the Computer then how FIR number and
police station are mentioned in it as the present case was
registered on 03.08.2017 while the CDR data is of dated
30.07.2017, therefore, such type of secondary evidence cannot

be relied upon. This court in a case titled Muhammad

Parvaiz vs. the State (2019 Y L R 2213) has observed that:-

“12, Regarding the CDR report, Ex. PW-14/5, which
has been given much weight by the learned trial Court in
respect of the guilt of the present accused/appellant to the
effect that allegedly the appellant and the acquitted co-
accused Mst. Musarrat Shaheen had communicated with
each other through their cell phones 38 times from
07.12.2015 to 09.12.2015. In respect of the C.D.R. data,
suffice it to say, that the same is of no importance to the
prosecution on various counts. As initially, it was the duty
of the prosecution to have received the C.D.R. with an
endorsement of the Cellular Company concerned, having
stamp and signature thereupon of the concerned authorized
officer, then while taking into possession the C.D.R.,
through a recovery memo, at least a concerned person
should have been associated from the Cellular Company to
independently prove the recovery or at least, recorded the
statement of representative of the Cellular Company to the
effect of issuance and receipt of C.D.R. but no such
evidence have been collected. The perusal of C.D.R. also
demonstrates that there is not even a single signature of
authorized officer of the said Company, thus, it cannot be
safely relied upon in any manner. Similar is the situation
regarding the cell No. 033244952582. There is no record
that the said cell number was registered in his name or

whose name the said Sim was registered.”
6. There are also glaring contradictions which create
reasonable doubt as to the happening of the event not in the
mode and manner as furnished by the prosecution. As per site
plan Exh.PB, the distance between point A, the place of police
mobile, and point B, the place of presence of the accused-
respondent at which he for the first time observed the police, is
500 paces. Abdur Rauf, the complainant (PW-2) in his cross
examination stated that the accused was seen from a distance
of 200/250 paces while Farid Khan, (PW-1), who was present
with the complainant at the relevant time and also marginal
witness to the recovery memo Exh.PW 1/1, stated that the
accused was seen from a distance of about 600/700 paces.
Similarly, both the above named witnesses stated in their
statements that the recovery of contraband was made from
landed property while the Investigating Officer stated that it
was made from the thoroughfare.

7. True, the FSL report regarding the recovered
contraband is in positive but the same too is of no avail to the
prosecution because the occurrence, as per record, took place
on 03.08.2017 while, the FSL report Exh.PZ reveals that the
samples were received by the Laboratory on 08.08.2017, after
the delay of five days. Sami Ur Rehman, Moharrir of the
concerned police station, (PW-3) in cross examination stated
that parcels No.1 to 3 were handed over to OII. He further
stated that he did not know as to when the I.O sent parcels No.
1 to 3 to the FSL. The prosecution has also failed to produce
the official, who had taken the samples to the Laboratory;

therefore, safe custody of the samples and delay in sending it
to the Laboratory, besides lack of the requisite protocol of the
test applied, is yet another uncertainty which further making
cricks in the prosecution story as the separated samples ought
to have been received by the FSL, within 72 hours of the
seizure as required by Rule 4(2) of the Control of Narcotic
Substances (Government Analysts) Rules, 2001. Hon’able the

Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of State through

Regional Director ANF v. Imam Bakhsh and others (2018

SCMR 2039) has observed that in a case where safe custody
of the recovered substance or safe transmission of samples of
the recovered substance is not established by the prosecution
there it cannot be held that the prosecution had succeeded in
establishing its case against the accused. Similarly, in the case
titled Khair-ul-Bashar v. the State (2019 SCMR 930), it was
held by the apex Court as under:--

"10. In the present case examination of the report of
the Government Analyst mentions the tests applied
but does not provide their results except a
concluding result, presumably of all the tests, which
is not sufficient. The Report also does not signify
the test protocols that were applied to carry out
these tests. Hence, the mandatory requirement of
law provided under Rule 6 has not been complied
with and, thus, it is not safe to rely on the Report of
the Government Analyst dated 18-02-2016. As a
conclusion, it is reiterated, that the Report of the
Government Analyst must mention (i) all the tests
and analysis of the alleged drug (ii) the result of the
each test(s) carried out along with the consolidated
result and (iii) the name of all the protocols applied
to carry out these tests.

Reliance is also placed on the case titled Qaiser Javed

Khan vs. The State through Prosecutor General Punjab,
Lahore and another, (PLD 2020 SC 57) wherein it has been
held by the Hon’able apex Court that:-

“8. The report of the Government Analyst in the
instant case does not specify the protocols of the
tests applied and thus does not meet the
requirements of the law as interpreted by this Court
in the cases of Amam Bakhsh and Khair ul Bashar
(supra). The said Report cannot be relied upon for

the conviction of the petitioner.”

8. We have perused the impugned judgment and found no
misreading or non-reading of the evidence and on the contrary
the evidence has been appreciated and assessed on the settled
principles of law by the Court below, thus, the learned trial
Court has rightly extended the benefit of doubt in favour of the
accused-respondent. It is well settled principle of criminal law
that it is for the prosecution to prove its case against the
accused beyond a shadow of a doubt and if there is any doubt
in the prosecution's case the benefit of such doubt must go to

the accused. Rel: Tariq Pervez v. The State (1995 SCMR

1345), Riaz Masih alias Mithoo v. The State (1995 SCMR
1730), Faheem Ahmed Farooqui v. The State (2008 SCMR
1572) & Hashim Qasim v. The State 2017 SCMR 986.

9. It would be also not out of place to mention here that
standard of appraisal of evidence in an appeal against acquittal
is different than an appeal against conviction, because accused
is presumed to be innocent in law and if after regular trial he is
acquitted he earns a double presumption of innocence and
heavy onus lies on the prosecution to rebut such presumption.

Hon’able the apex Court in the case of “Mst. Jallan_Vs.
Muhammad Riaz and other” (PLD 2003 SC _644) it was

observed that:-

“Once an accused had earned acquittal in his
favour, he enjoyed double presumption of
innocence and the Court while examining the case
of such accused must be very careful and cautious
in interfering with the acquittal order and normally
should not set aside the same merely for the reason
that some other view was also _possible---
interference, however, could be made in exercise
of powers conferred upon the Court under S.417,
Cr.P.C., if it was proved that the Court whose
judgment was under scrutiny had misread such
evidence”.

Reliance is also on the cases titled “Zaheer-ud-Din
Vs. The State” (1993 SCMR-1628), “Khan Vs. Sajjad and 2
others” (2004 SCMR 215), “Barkat Ali Vs. Shaukat Ali and
others” (2004 SCMR 249,. “Farhat Azeem Vs. Asmat Ullah
and 6 others” (2008 SCMR 1285), “Haji Payo Khan Vs. Sher
Baz and others” (2009 SCMR 803), “Muhammad Aslam Vs.
Sabir Hussain and others” (2009 SCMR 985),

10. So, in view of the above discussion, we do not propose
to draw a conclusion different from what the learned trial
Court has drawn and, hence, we do not feel hesitant to uphold
the acquittal of the respondent-accused, resultantly, the same is
maintained and, accordingly, dismiss the appeal in /imine.
