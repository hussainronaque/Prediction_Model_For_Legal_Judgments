MUHAMMAD NASIR MAHFOOZ, J:- Through
the instant appeal filed under section 17 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Consumer Protection Act, 1997 the
appellants have challenged the order dated 10.11.2016
passed by Consumer Court, Malakand Division at
Camp Court Daggar Buner whereby the complaint
filed by the present respondent under section 12 of the
ibid Act was accepted.

2. Perusal of the contents of the complaint
reveals that the present respondent is consumer of
electricity meter bearing No.362177 of Peshawar
Electricity Supply Company (hereinafter called as
PESCO) of Sub-Division Daggar, Buner. The said
electricity meter is installed at his house for fulfilling
his domestic electricity needs. The dispute is alleged

to have arisen from the monthly electricity bill of
February, 2014 wherein the meter reading is shown as
19083 and consumption of 14220 units which forced
him to contact the office of present appellants and in
pursuance thereof, one Wilayat Ali Line Man
inspected the meter and correctly recorded the said
units overleaf the concerned monthly bill and signed
the same on 26.02.2014. The said complaint was
registered as No.5740 dated 27.02.2014 and despite
his protest to the excessive billing he deposited the
electricity bill and thereafter several times raised same
objections but in vain, hence he was constrained to
file the subject complaint before the Consumer Court
concemed. It is further alleged that without any reason
they declared his meter as defective as the said meter
was neither tempered with nor there was any
allegations of theft of electricity or dishonest
abstraction of emergency.

3. Appellant submitted his reply and raised an
objection to jurisdiction of the consumer court and
contended that under section 26 of the Electricity Act,
Electric Inspector has got jurisdiction to entertain such
like matters besides denied the allegations leveled in

the complaint.
4. Appellant appeared as P.W.1 and produced
relevant record in support of his complaint. Electricity
bills for the month of February, March and April,
2014 are Ex.P.W.1/1 to Ex.P.W.1/3 respectively. In
the monthly bill of April, 2014 reading shows 200
units and the monthly bill is Rs.2074 thereafter the
bill of May, 2014 shows that the units columns are
left blank and in the status column defective code is
given with monthly bill of Rs.3768. A legal notice
issued by the appellants is Ex.P.W.1/5. Respondent
has also produced monthly bills for the months of
June and August, 2014 as Ex.P.W.1/8 and
Ex.P.W.1/9. Similar to the above bill the relevant
columns of reading are left blank but an amount of
Rs.5,215/- and Rs.9007/- have been charged against
the bill.

5. D.W.1, Assistant Lineman of PESCO Sub-
division produced Ex.D.W.1/3 to Ex.D.W.1/17
regarding relevant record from the office of
appellants. Ex.D.W.1/3 is shown to be laboratory
report dated 03.04.2015 of the PESCO regarding the
aforesaid meter but their record is silent _ that

how the meter was removed and why the said
laboratory report was not exhibited through its proper
custody i.e. official of the laboratory concerned.
Arguments heard and record perused.

6. The whole record is replete with the unilateral
and casual manner in which the appellants have dealt
with the grievances of the respondent without giving
it a serious consideration. As mentioned above, the
meter reading for the consumed units in the bill is
blank but still sufficient amount has been charged
against the electricity meter of the respondent. No
efforts to justify replacement of meter without
following proper procedure or to associate the present
respondent is a proof of blatant misuse of their
authority. Respondent has been treated
indiscriminately without properly addressing his
grievance by either issuing prior notice while
initiating any action as even during pendency of the
complaint of respondent the excessive billing is
proved from the monthly bill of February, 2015
wherein Rs.21,537/- is charged for 24 units consumed
as shown in the relevant columns and total cast of
electricity is 75. Learned counsel for the appellant

failed to sufficiently explain the said unilateral actions
displayed through the change of electricity meter and
charges made aginast electricity meter rather raised
flimsy objections to the jurisdiction of consumer court
but not pressed. From perusal of record even a man of
ordinary prudence can visualize the discriminatory
treatment meted to the respondent-complainant while
charging his electricity meter.
7. So far as the objection to jurisdiction of
consumer court is concerned, there is no doubt in this
fact that PESCO is a company performing functions
of distribution of electricity for the province of
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa which falls within the definition
of Services being a service provider and section 2 (c)
(ii) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Consumer Protection
Act, 1997 defines the word “consumer” as;
“(ii) hires any goods or services for a
consideration which has been paid or
promised or partly paid and partly promised
to be paid or under any system of deferred
payment including hire purchase and leasing
and includes any beneficiary of such
services.”
The word “service” is defined in clause (n) of
the said section which includes supply of electricity

inter alia other kind of services provided by different

entities to the exclusion of only that service which is
free of charge or under contract of personal service.
Since PESCO is admittedly a service provider of
electricity and the disputes arising during the supply
of electricity falls within the jurisdiction of consumer
court. Section 26, 26-A and Section 54-C of the
Electricity Act have different connotations which does
not include the subject matter but where there is
allegations of theft of electricity or any dishonest
abstraction or consumption of energy. It is an
admitted fact, that while supplying electricity to every
consumer Khyber Pakhtunkhwa an agreement form is
signed by the consumer with the PESCO whereas
section 26 (1) starts with the words “in the absence of
any agreement to the contrary” and section 26 (6)
provides for settlement of a dispute by electric
Inspector, where any difference or dispute arises
between a licensee and a consumer as to whether any
meter, maximum demand indicator or other measuring
apparatus is or is not correct. Under section 26-A of
the Electricity Act the matter will got to electric
inspector if there is a charge against consumer for the
dishonestly abstracted amount of energy. Moreover,

section 39 of the Electricity Act, provides procedure
for theft of energy. Section 54-C inter alia provides
for bar of jurisdiction for a court from discontinuing
supply of energy to any premises or requiring him to
restore supply by energy to such premises but this
section is subject to sub-section 1 of section 24
wherein issuance of prior notice is essential.

8. There is not a single document to show that
the appellants in general or any of the appellants in
particular has redressed grievance of the respondent in
black and white not to speak of giving detailed
reasons. Section 24-A of General Clauses Act binds
every public functionary to give detailed reasons and
pass a speaking order after deep analysis of any matter
that is brought before him. It is now a folkore that
public functionaries shall exercise their authority in an
arbitrary and fanciful manner.

9. In the present case, respondent/complainant
had not defaulted in paying any monthly electricity
bill at the time of institution of his complaint but he is
disputing the incorrect reading recorded in the
monthly electricity bill which does not commensurate
with his actual electricity consumed, the discrepancy

is proved from the documentary evidence produced
during the trial of this case. Though the consumer
court was only bound to determine the subject matter
of complaint in a summary manner but still he has
given complete opportunity of hearing to both the
parties to settle the controversy once and for all.

Reference is made to Water and Power

Development Authority and others Vs. Messers
Kamal Food (PVT) LTD Okara and others (PLD

2012 SC. 371) para 8 of the judgment is reproduced
as under;

“The above principle laid down in “Colony
Textile Mills Ltd. Multan” was cited with
approval in the subsequent judgment of this
Court in “Multan Electric Power Company
Ltd.” (ibid). It follows from the above case-
law that where the allegation against the
consumer of electrical power is of dishonest
consumption of energy through
manipulation of, or tempering with, the
metering equipment or other similar
apparatus, the Electric Inspector would still
have the authority to entertain reference
under section 26(6). In case the theft alleged
is by means other than the tempering or
manipulation of the metering equipment etc,
the matter would fall exclusively under
section 26-A of the Act, outside the scope of
powers of the Electric Inspector.

The objection to jurisdiction raised by the
learned counsel for the appellant has got no force thus
rejected and it is held that consumer court has rightly

allowed the complaint by giving sound reasons after
considering each and every aspect of the matter in
detail, thus calls for no interference by this court.
In the light of above, this appeal being bereft

of any merits is dismissed with no orders as to cost.
