judgment dated 30.3.2017 passed by the learned Bench of the Peshawar
High Court, in Writ Petition No.832-P of 2017, declining bail to him in
NAB Reference ‘and through the same judgment conceded bail to
Saibzada Alamgir, facing trial under same NAB Reference under scction

“According to him section 9(b) of the Ordinance ibid, is non

provision and all offences under the NAO, 1999, are made | ne bailable

and general provisions regulating pre-arrest or post-arrest bail or release

of person from ‘detention, suspension of sentence, in terms ‘of Section
426, 491, 497, 498, and 561-A ‘of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code,
1908 have been excluded in application. To support his contentions he
placed reliance on large number of cases from different High Courts and

of this Court reported as Mrs.Shahida_ Faisal and others versus

Federation of Pakistan and others (2001 SCMR 294) and Anwer Saifuallh

Khan versus The State and three others (2001 SCMR 1040), wherein it

has been held that jurisdiction of both the Accountability Court as well

Accountability Bureau Ordinance, (nao, 1999). Though in both :the ‘cited

page 1222 it was also observed that “validity of the National
Accountability Ordinance will be examined separately in appropriate

proceedings at appropriate stage”.

3. Challenge to the jurisdiction of High Court to concede bail to

persons facing reference for charged under the NAO, 1999. is not novel;
and has been agitated time and again since very inception of the NAO,

1999. Section 9 (b} ibid; prior to amendment read as follows:-

“All offences under this Order shall be non-bailable and
‘| : notwithstanding anything contained in sections (426,
fea ; ; 491), 497, 498 and 561-A or any other provision of the

Code or any other law for the time being in force no Court,

learned Special Prosecutor, NAB are based on ‘the exposition of un-

dated 10.8.2001 (PLJ 2001 Federal Statute 403), in Section 9(b) ibid;

after the words “no Court” words, “Including High Court” were omitted.

The amended provision, now read as follows:-

“All offences under the Order shall be non-bailable and
notwithstanding any thing contained in sections 426,491,

any other law for the time being in force no Court,** shall

NAO, 1999.

7. NAO, 1999 is a special statute, hybrid in nature, it is fusion
of criminal liability and civil obligations, enacted with an aim to take
effective measures for detection, investigation, prosecution and speedy

Amended provision of section 9(b) ibid; came up for

eration of this Court in the case of Muhammad Saeéd Mehdi versus

The: State_and_2 others (2002 SCMR 282) and at page 289, view

expressed by the full Bench of the Lahore High Court in the case of

Anwer Saifullah v. The State and four others wip 2000 Lahore 564) “that the

High Court had jurisdiction under Article 199 of thé Constitution to grant

bail to a person accused of an offence under NAB Ordinance in appropriate

cases in that the bar of jurisdiction there under being in the nature of

legislative enactment could not take away the jurisdiction of the High

4

Court under Article 199 of the Constitution” was approved. In another case

reported as Ch. Zufigar Ali versus The State (PLD 2002 Supre

546) in the concluding part of paragraph 8 at page 552 it was h
the amendment, the jurisdiction of the Accountability Court for

remained ousted, whereas after the omission of words “including the High

Court” the High Court has jurisdiction to grant bail in NAB cases under

Article 199 of the Constitution as held in the case of Khan Asfandyar Wali”

which view was also affirmed in the case of Abdul Aziz Khan. Niazi versus

The State through Chairman, NAB, Islamabad (PLD 2003 Supreme Court
668) in paragraph 7 at page 675, it was held that “the refusal of bail by
the High Court in its constitutional jurisdiction merely for the reason that
the concept of discretion. for grant of bail under Article 199 of the
Constitution of Islamic Republic ‘of Pakistan, 1973 is different to that of
under section 497/498 Cr.P,C is not proper. The discretion of High Court

under the Constitution and under ordinary law in bail matter is. based

almost on same principle.” This view was followed in the’ cas

‘Ghulam _Ali_ versus The State through _A.G., N.W.F.P., Peshati ir (2003

SCMR 597); wherein, this Court had the occasion to arnalyze‘the legal

implications of section 9(b) of the NAB Ordinance, 1999 as/ametided, at

page 602 of the cited judgment it was held “We may point out that the use

999, However, as held in above said Judgment (Ch. Zulfigar Ali supra) the power

off High Court for grant of bail in writ jurisdiction would be available and
an accused of an offence under NAB Ordinance, 1999 is at liberty to take
any ground for grant of bail on the basis of which bail can be granted
under section 497, Cr.P.C. The conclusion is that even after amendment in
section 9(b) of NAB Ordinance, 1999 the legal position regarding the
maintainability of a bail application under section 497, Cr.P.C in a case
under the Said Ordinance was not changed” at page 604 it was further

affirmed that “In amended section 9(b) of NAB Ordinance, 1 999, ‘except the

omission of words “High Court” no change was made, therefore, ‘the legal.

case of Chairman, National Accountability Bureau, Islamabad and another

[: versus Asif Baig Muhammad _and others ‘(2004 SCMR 91), this Court
*

declined to interfere in bail granting order passed by the High Court in

exercise of jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution, 1973.

Saifulah Khan (Supra) was successively followed and resonates in the

cases of Ch. Zulfigar Ali xp 2002 sc 546), ‘Muhammad Saeed ‘Mehdi (2002

6:8.2016 titled as Chairman NAB versus Bakht Zameen & another (in

P No.1542 of 2016), in all such cases bail was considered under
Article 199 and or Article 184 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973

10.. Contention of the learned Special Prosecutor, : NAB that

altoBethér: different’ Superior Courts extract jurisdiction under Article

2002 Supreme Court 1111).

11. While assuming jurisdiction under section 497 Cr.P.C
learned bench of the High Court, was influenced and has misconstrued
seciion 17 of the NAO, 1999 which makes the provisions of Cr.P.c
‘including procedure for session trial. (per chapter XX-A of the Cr.P.C)
applicable, unless otherwise, provided in the NAO, 1999 itself. Section
17 (c) ibid; librated the Accountability Court from the procedural and
technical trapping of Criminal Procedure Code, giving it authority not

only to “dispense with any provision of the Code” and at the -

invoke provisions of Cr.P.C, which are specifically excluded by virtue of
section 9(b). ibid; from application in cases triable under NAO, 1999 in
ostensible exercise of power under section 17(c} ibid; of the NAO, 1999.
Such enabling power of the Accountability Court were conditioned by
this ‘Court in the case tof Kran As fand ar Wali (PLD 2001 sc 607@ 926), “not

signing valid reasons.,” such exercise of discretion was also held to be

Cr.P.C regulating pre-arrest and post-arrest bail.

12. ¢ Judgment in the case of Muhammad Saeed Mehili (2002 SCMR
282) was not appreciate by the learned bench of the High Court in its true

«

perspective. In the judgment it was specifically observed that the “High
Court has jurisdiction to grant bail in NAB cases under Article 199 of ‘the
Constitution” relevant part of paragraph 8 of cited judgment is
reproduced in preceding paragraph 8 above and, perhaps attention of the
learned bench was also not drawn to the cases of Haji Ghulam Ali, supra.

(2003 SCMR 597} ‘a 602), Himesh Khan versus National Accountability Bureau (2015

scmr 1092 @ 1095) In view of the forgoing discussion, conclusion of the

learned Bench of the Peshawar High Court; as contained in paragraphs

12 to 15 of the impugned judgment to the effect ‘that Hig’

from the inquiry against the petitioner Olas Khan, sufficient and
reasonable documentary proof is available which makes out a
case, in term of Section 9 of the NAB Ordinance, 1999 against

the Petitioner is accused of pertains to a period prior to devolution. of the

Peshawar High Court declining bail to the Petitioner which is accordingly

consideration of reasoning set down in Paragraph No.20 of the impugned

no any direct allegation had (been) brought by the NAB, therefore, keeping ;
