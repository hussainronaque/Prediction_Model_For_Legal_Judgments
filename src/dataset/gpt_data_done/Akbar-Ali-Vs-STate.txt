JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- Petitioner

Akbar Ali, seeks bail in case FIR No.455 dated
04.08.2015, registered under sections 496-A/109 PPC, in
Police Station Charsadda.

2. According to report of complainant Anar
Gul, his wife Mst. Nabia (mother of his three children),
had developed relations with petitioner Akbar Ali and used
to remain with him on contact on mobile phone; that on
31.07.2015, on his return from the village mosque after
offering “Juma prayer” he found her missing and during
search came to know that she has been enticed away by
petitioner with the help of co-accused Inamullah and Bilal,
for the purpose of marriage, hence, this case.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. Record divulges that neither complainant nor
anybody else has furnished the ocular account of taking or
enticing away Mst. Nabia by the petitioner. Rather,
according to report of complainant, she had relation with
petitioner. There is no allegation of illicit intercourse
against the petitioner with Mst. Nabia. She has also been
arrayed as an accused in the case. Her medico legal report
qua sexual intercourse is in the negative while she has not
been recovered from the custody or detention of the
petitioner. To constitute an offence under section 496-A
PPC, there must be (i) taking or enticing away a woman by
a person (ii) the intention behind such taking or enticing
must be that of illicit intercourse with and (iii) there must
be her detention and concealment. As discussed above, on
the available record, I do not see the above essential
ingredients to constitute the offence under section 496-A
PPC. Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the
offence falls within the purview of S.496-B PPC which
deals with fornication, which is bailable and the petitioner
would be entitled to be release on bail. I disagree with the
argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner on the
ground that for an offence of fornication within the
meaning of S.496-B PPC, there must be a willful sexual

intercourse between a man and woman with each other,

who are not married to each other, but in the instant case,
nothing is on the record to show any sexual intercourse of
the petitioner with Mst. Nabia, therefore, it is yet to be
determined during trial as to which of the offence has been
committed. The petitioner has not confessed his guilt.
Investigation in the case is complete and he is no more
required for further interrogation, thus, keeping him behind
the bar would serve no beneficial purpose for the
prosecution.

5. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he
furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two
local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD, concerned.

7. For what has been discussed above, Suo motu
notice given to accused Shakir stands withdrawn. He is
admitted to bail on already existing bail bonds, on merits.
Since this court has already directed expeditious
conclusion of trial while dealing with the bail petition of
co-accused Farman, therefore, office is directed to send the
record to the quarter concerned within two days, positively.
