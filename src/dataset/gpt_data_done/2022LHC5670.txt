kill him besides receiving the money; according to
Ibrahim Yousaf, Usman disclosed that he was also
having the pictures of girls of their family and the
material in shape of photos and videos was in possession
of Zohaib.

5. Investigation of the case was started by Jamshed
Khan ASI (Pw-7) who on 27.07.2021 arrested Usman Ali
(appellant) and Muhammad Zohaib. During investigation
appellant and his co-accused got recovered mobile
phones those were sent to PFSA” for forensic

10. Ihave heard both the sides and with their valuable
assistance, I have also gone through the record of
learned trial court.

11. It will not be out of context to add here that
appellant was acquitted from the charges under Sections
367-A/377 PPC and Section 22 of the Act.

12. Prosecution’s case is that during investigation at
the instance of Usman Ali (appellant) his mobile phones
(P5 and P7) and of Muhammad Zohaib (P6) were taken
into possession vide three independent inventories
(PG, PF and PL). All devices were sent to the office of
PFSA for forensic examination from where considerable
and incriminating material in shape of videos and photos
were retrieved and sent to police on a Digital Video
Disk/DVD/CD (P14). The impugned judgment reveals
that conviction of appellant has been based on the said
material.

13. On scanning of record, it has been observed that
right of fair trial has been denied to appellant due to
following reasons: -

> Non-supply of copy of DVD/CD to
appellant in terms of Section 265-C,
Cr.P.C.

> Non-displaying the videos and photos
during the statements of any of the
prosecution witnesses.

> Non-displaying the videos and photos
while examining the appellant under
Section 342 Cr.P.C.

14. Supply of copies of evidence to an accused is a

valuable right. On omission of Chapter XXIII“ Cr.P.C

4 The trial before High Courts and Courts of Session (Sections 266 to 336)
Criminal Appeal No.395 of 2022
Usman Ali Vs. The State & another

under the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (XII of 1972)
as there was a vacuum therefore Chapter XXII-A”
Cr.P.C was inserted on the strength of same Ordinance,

which was further substituted by way of Code of
Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976 (XLIV of

1976)" while describing a comprehensive procedure
indicating all the steps in a criminal trial before High
Courts and Courts of Session. Besides many other
safeguards an important right of accused to receive the
copies of documents in terms of Section 265-C before
framing of charge and recording of evidence was
protected. For effective discussion said provisions is as

under: -

“265-C. Supply of statements and
documents to the accused: (1) In all

cases instituted upon police report,
copies of the following documents shall
be supplied free of cost to the accused
not later than seven days before the
commencement of the trial, namely: -
(a) the first information reports

(b) the police report;

(c) the statements of all witnesses
recorded under Sections 161 and 164;
and

(d) the inspection note recorded by an
investigation officer on his first visit, to
the place of occurrence and the note
recorded by him on recoveries made, if
any:

Provided that, if any part of a statement
recorded under Section 161 or Section
164 is such that its disclosure to the
accused would be inexpedient in the
public interest, such part of the
statement shall be excluded from the

'© PLD 1976 Central Statues 369 (Sections 265-A to 265-N)
Criminal Appeal No.395 of 2022
Usman Ali Vs. The State & another

copy of the statement furnished to the
accused.

(2) in all cases instituted upon a
complaint in writing-

(a) the complainant shall: -

(i) state in the petition of complaint the
substance of the accusation, the names
of his witnesses and the gist of the
evidence which he is likely to adduce at
the trial; and

(ii) within three days of the order of the
Court under Section 204 for issue of
process to the accused, file, in the Court
for supply to the accused as many copies
of the complaint and any other document
which he has filed with his complaint as
the number of the accused and

(b) copies of the complaint, and any
other documents which the complainant
has filed therewith and the statements
under Section 200 or Section 202 shall
be supplied free of cost to the accused
not later than seven days before the
commencement of the trial.”

15. Right to know by accused the case against him is
based on the principles of natural justice therefore the
wisdom behind the provisions is obvious that before

177 the accused must know that

commencement of tria
what the evidence against him prosecution intends to
produce so he has to be in a position to defend him
properly therefore the provisions of Section 265-C,
Cr.P.C has to be construed liberally that the copies of
every evidence oral or documentary should be made
available to him. Only the complete and fair disclosure
of entire evidence to be used against accused can ensure

a free and transparent trial. The scenario will not change

even if an accused has himself conceded to, the

"7 A trial is commenced on framing of charge (Haq Nawaz & others vs. The State & others 2000 SCMR 785)
Criminal Appeal No.395 of 2022
Usman Ali Vs. The State & another

omission to apply with the provisions of Section 265-
Cc”.

16. Coming to the effect of non-compliance of the
said provisions, it goes without saying that as it
jeopardizes the right of fair and impartial trial therefore
it vitiates the whole trial.

17. Learned counsel for complainant and learned Law
Officer for State jointly maintain that the provisions of
265-C, Cr.P.C, in cases upon police report, states only
about first information report, police report, statements
of all witnesses recorded under Sections 161 and 164
Cr.P.C, and the inspection notes recorded by the
investigating officer and as it does not cover any other
document therefore the learned trial court was under no
obligation to supply the copy of DVD/CD to appellant.
This argument has no force at all for the simple reason
that the documents mentioned in the provisions is a
minimum standard so if in addition thereto, there is any
other evidence to be produced by the prosecution
against an accused copy thereof must be supplied and
disclosed to him also. In Naveed Asif’s case’? the
honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan had observed
that, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 265-C,
Cr.P.C, the court is empowered to issue direction for
supply of the copies of statements or documents at
some other stage of the proceedings as well if the

dictates of justice so demand. The apex court in

' Naveed Asif vs. The State PLD 1988 SC 99
Criminal Appeal No.395 of 2022
Usman Ali Vs. The State & another

Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s case?” was pleased to hold that
where the police officer does not record the statement
of a witness as required by Section 161, Cr.P.C but
writes it in the diary maintained under Section 172,

Cr.P.C its copy should also be given to the accused.

18. Article 164 after insertion of its proviso?’ in the
Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (P.O No. X of 1984),
empowers the court to allow any evidence to be
produced that becomes available because of modern
devices and techniques and conviction on the basis
thereof is lawful. Therefore provisions of Section 265-
C, Cr.P.C cannot be read in isolation and now the
courts are under a statutory duty to supply the copies
of any such document at the relevant stage.

19. As mentioned earlier that the supply of copies in
terms of Section 265-C, Cr.P.C is not mere a formality
so prosecution cannot be allowed to give a surprise to
accused by producing an evidence for which he had no
earlier notice. The court seized with the trial is also
under obligation to ensure that none of such provisions
be compromised and no right is to be denied to accused.
20. In the case in hand admittedly copy of DVD/CD
at no stage of trial was supplied to appellant so as to
disclose him the nature of videos and photos. During the
examination-in-chief or cross-examination of any of the
thirteen witnesses produced by prosecution the videos
and photos were not displayed. It was the duty of

learned trial court to show the said material to accused

* Zulfikar Ali Bhutto vs. The State PLD 1979 SC 53
1 The proviso was inserted by way of Criminal Laws (Amendment) Act (IV of 2017)
Criminal Appeal No.395 of 2022
Usman Ali Vs. The State & another

at least at the stage of examination of Ibrahim Yousaf
(Pw-1) to enable the appellant to cross-examine him in
this context.

21. The learned trial court instead of following the
lawful procedure as mentioned above, adopted a novel
way and for that this Court cannot close the eyes. The
statements of all prosecution witnesses were recorded
and subsequent thereto on 22.04.2022 examination of
appellant was also made under Section 342 Cr.P.C. The
case was fixed for final arguments and after about a
month that was 26.05.2022 the learned trial court
directed the production one of the mobile phones which
was produced on 27.05.2022 and then the videos and
photos were seen inside the court room as evident from
an order dated 28.05.2022. To my mind this was a futile
exercise for a simple reason that the appellant at that
stage was having no opportunity at all to cross-examine
any of the witnesses in this regard. On 29.05.2022 it was
Sunday so on the very next working day that was
30.05.2022 the learned trial court convicted the
appellant relying on the said photos and videos.

22. Moving the discussions to the examination of
appellant under Section 342 Cr.P.C, the said provisions
is also reproduced as under for a fruitful discussion: -

“(1) For the purpose of enabling the
accused to explain any circumstances
appearing in the evidence against him,
the Court may, at any stage of any
inquiry or trial without previously
warning the accused, put such questions
to him as the Court considers
necessary, and shall for the purpose
aforesaid, question him generally on the
Criminal Appeal No.395 of 2022
Usman Ali Vs. The State & another

case after the witnesses for the
prosecution have been examined and
before he is called on for his defence.
(2) The accused shall not render himself
liable to punishment by refusing to
answer such questions or by giving
false answers to them; but the court
may draw such inference from such
refusal or answer as it thinks just.

(3) The answers given by the accused
may be taken into consideration in such
inquiry or trial, and put in evidence for
or against him in any other inquiry into,
or trial for, any other offence which
such answers may tend to show he has
committed.”

(4) Except as provided by subsection (2)
of S.340 no oath shall be administered
to the accused.”

23. <A carful perusal of the above quoted provisions
makes it clear that examination of an accused is not
mere a formality by the court but a mandate to enable
him/accused to explain any circumstances appearing
against him in evidence therefore every piece of
evidence which can be used against him for the purpose

of conviction is required to be put to him. This Court in
Mst. Zainab Bibi’s*” case while discussing the

importance of examination of accused under Section
342 Cr.P.C had observed as under: -

“Said examination of accused is based
on the principles involved in maxi
“Audi Alteram Partem” that means ‘no
one should be condemned unheard’.
These circumstances to be put to
accused are also called ‘incriminate
pieces of evidence’. The word
incriminating means “a material that
has harmful effect”. _ Therefore,

11

Criminal Appeal No.395 of 2022
Usman Ali Vs. The State & another

deviation from said duty shall render
the conviction invalid.”

24. The settled principles?* governing for
examination of accused under Section 342 Cr.P.C are as

under: -

i. The failure of the trial court to question
the accused about incriminating
material will amount to an infringement
of the provisions of Section 342 Cr.P.C.

ii. Where the circumstances appearing in
evidence against accused are not put
and his explanation is not taken
thereupon, it cannot be said that the
purpose of Section 342 Cr.P.C has
been fulfilled.

iii. It is not a mere formality, but is an
essential part of the trial that the
accused should be given notice of the
point or points which he must meet in
order to exonerate him.

iv. The court should not only point out to
the accused the circumstances
appearing in the evidence which
require explanation but it must out of
fairness to the accused exercise that
power in such a way that the accused
may know what points in the opinion of
the court require explanation and
failure or refusal on the part of the
accused to give the explanation will
entitle the court to draw an inference
against him.

v. The word ‘generally’ does not limit the
nature of the questioning to one or
mere questions of a general nature
relating to the case, but it means that
the questions should relate to the whole
case generally, and should not be

Criminal Appeal No.395 of 2022
Usman Ali Vs. The State & another

limited to any particular part or parts
of it.

vi. The word ‘generally’ does not mean
that the accused cannot be subjected to
a detailed examination by the court.

vii. The real object of Section 342 Cr.P.C
is not to subject the accused to a
detailed cross examination. It is, as a
matter of fact, inviting his attention to
the point or points in the evidence
which is likely to influence the mind of
the Judge in arriving at a conclusions
adverse to the accused, and before
such an adverse inference can be
drawn, the accused should be afforded
an opportunity to offer an explanation,
if he has any.

viii. Section 342 Cr.P.C is absolutely
essential in accordance with its terms,
and where this is not done, the
conviction might be quashed, or the
trial might be set aside.

ix. It is wholly against the provisions of
the Criminal Procedure Code or the
demands of natural justice that a
person should be convicted on the
basis of something, of which he was not
given any notice, and to which he was
never required to give his own reply.

25. Examination of appellant shows that questions
No. 17, 18 and 20 were about recoveries of mobile
phones whereas question No. 27 was about the reports
of PFSA. It does not reveal that the videos and photos
were displayed in the court and shown to appellant so as
to give him an opportunity for offering the explanations.
Learned counsel for complainant has frankly conceded
this omission on the part of learned trial court.

26. Articles 10-A of the Constitution of The Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 guarantees fair trial and

due process of law and is as under: -
Criminal Appeal No.395 of 2022
Usman Ali Vs. The State & another

“10-A. Right to fair trial. For the
determination of his civil rights
and obligations or in any criminal
charge against him a person shall be
entitled to a fair trial and due process”

27. The right of fair trial of an accused is universally

recognized in the light of Articles 10 and 11 of the

Universal Declaration of Human Rights**, that
guarantee that everyone is entitled in full equality to a
fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in
the determination of any criminal charge against him
and he shall have all the guarantees necessary for his
defense.

28. The honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan in

Naveed Asghar’s case** was pleased to observe that: -

“No matter how heinous the crime, the
constitutional guarantee of fair trial
under Article 10-A cannot be taken
away from the accused. ”

29. Components of right to fair trial and its

importance were well elaborated by the apex court in

Muhammad Bashir’s case”®, as under: -

“The Constitution of the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan prescribes
important safeguards against
depriving a person of his "life or
liberty" and with regard to arrest and
detention, which includes "the right to
consult and be defended by a legal
practitioner of his choice". The
Constitution also mandates a "fair
trial and due process". A person
arrested for an offence (1) must be
informed of the grounds of his arrest;

4 https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights
5 Naveed Asghar vs. The State PLD 2021 SC 600
°*Muhammad Bashir vs. Rukhsar & others PLD 2020 SC 334
Criminal Appeal No.395 of 2022
Usman Ali Vs. The State & another

(2) must be permitted to consult with
and be defended by a lawyer; (3) must
be provided with the information of
the offence he is charged for; (4) must
be provided with an opportunity to
cross-examine witnesses who depose
against him; (5) must _be given an

opportunity to explain the
circumstances disclosed in evidence

against him; and (6) must also be
provided an opportunity to produce

evidence in his defense. These are also
necessary ingredients to ensure the
fairness of a trial.”

(Emphasis applied)

30. This takes me to an ultimate view that because of
serious illegalities committed by the learned trial court,
appellant has been denied the constitutional guarantee of
fair trial therefore conviction recorded against him
cannot sustain.

31. Finally the most important question before this
court is the ultimate outcome of instant appeal that
whether it is a case of acquittal or remand for retrial? In
Muhammad Asif Ali Usama’ case?” while commenting
upon the duty of the trial court it was observed as
under:-

“There is no cavil to this proposition that
solitary purpose of judicial proceedings
in a criminal case is to discover the truth
and to arrive at a just decision of the
case. The word ‘Just’ is significant that
means ‘Right, Fair, Well founded’.
Therefore, every effort should be made
by the court that no aspect of the case is
to be left unattended, prior to declaration

7 Muhammad Asif Ali Usama vs. The State & another 2022 PCRLJ 59
Criminal Appeal No.395 of 2022
Usman Ali Vs. The State & another

of final verdict as was stated by Judge
Learned Hand”®. -

“A Judge is more than a moderator; he
is charged to see that the law is
properly administered and it is a duty

which he cannot discharge by

remaining inert??”

32. It was the duty of learned trial Judge to be vigilant
while supplying the copies of documents to appellant
under Section 265-C, Cr.P.C, to display the videos and
photos during the statement of the victim of the case and
also to show the same to appellant while examining him
under Section 342 Cr.P.C, hence prosecution as a whole
cannot be stated to be at fault. Therefore the case is liable
to be remanded back.

33. Resultantly, this criminal appeal is allowed.
Impugned judgment to the extent of conviction of Usman
Ali (appellant) is set aside and case is remanded back with
the following directions: -

i. The learned trial court shall supply the
copy of DVD/CD to appellant allegedly
having videos and __ photographs
retrieved from mobile phones by PFSA.

ii. After receiving the copy of DVD/CD, the
appellant, if desires, shall be allowed to
recall any of the prosecution witnesses
already examined for cross-examination
to this extent only.

iti. The appellant shall be examined again
under Section 342 Cr.P.C where he
shall be questioned on every
incriminating piece of evidence and
shall also be shown the videos and
photos enabling him to explain the same.

iv. As appellant has already been acquitted
from the offences under Sections 367-

taken thereto by the rivals therefore the
trial of appellant shall be confined to
under Sections 292-A/292-C PPC only.

34. As Syed Muhammad Ilyas, the learned Additional

while convicting the appellant, therefore the learned

ensure the decision of the case within a period of one

month from the date of receipt copy of this Judgment.
