JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT

Criminal Appeal No.1717 of 2010
(Taj Muhammad vs. The State)

JUDGMENT

Date of Hearing: 27.05.2021

Appellant by: Malik Jahanzaib Advocate.
State by: Mr. Irfan Zia, Deputy Prosecutor General.

Complainant by: Nemo

Sohail Nasir, J. Since morning repeated calls are made, but
none appeared on behalf of complainant despite the fact that file is
kept pending till 02:00 pm. Order sheets show that for the last five
consecutive dates no one from complainant side has pursued this
matter. This appeal is of the year 2010 and shown in the red
regular cause list where name of Mr. Shoaib Zafar Advocate for
complainant is also posted, so I proceed to decide it after hearing
learned counsel for appellant and learned Deputy Prosecutor
General for the State.

2. This criminal appeal is directed against judgment dated
27.05.2010, passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge,
Mianwali on the basis of which Taj Muhammad (appellant) was
convicted under Section 302(b) of Pakistan Penal Code (XLV of
1860) {PPC} and sentenced to imprisonment for life and to pay
Rs.2,00,000/- (two lacs) as compensation in terms of section 544-A
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, (Act V of 1898) (Cr.P.C) to
the legal heirs of deceased. Benefit of Section 382-B, Cr.P.C was
also extended to him. By way of same judgment Mst. Zareena
Afshan was acquitted from the charges.

3. Facts of the case are that on 26.10.2007, Muhammad
Ibrahim (Pw-9) while appearing in police station City Mianwali

made a statement that on that day at about 12:30 noon his son
Cri. Appeal No.1717 of 2010 2

Muhammad Shafiq (deceased) was present at Kala Bagh Chungi
on his Chingchi Rikshaw; Taj Muhammad armed with 30 bore
pistol along with an unknown person empty handed came there on
a motorbike; appellant raised a ‘lalkara’ that they were there for
taking the revenge of insult and made a straight fire which hit on
the right flank of Muhammad Shafiq, who fell down on the
ground; on hue and cry Muhammad Rafiq (Pw-10) and
Muhammad Hanif (not produced) arrived there; appellant and his
co-accused had escaped from crime scene. The motive alleged was
that the appellant had borrowed an amount of Rs.50000/- (fifty
thousand) from complainant and on demand for its return,
appellant was insulted by deceased.

4. Said statement was resulted into registration of FIR No.524
(PG), on 26.10.2007 under Sections 324/34 PPC. On the death of
Muhammad Shafiq in hospital, offence of Section 324 PPC was
converted to 302(b) PPC.

5. During investigation, complainant got his supplementary
statement recorded and maintained that while reporting the matter,
he had forgotten that an hour prior to the occurrence, Mst. Afshan
and Mst. Zareena daughters of Ghulam Hussain (sisters of
Appellant) hatched a conspiracy with their brother Taj Muhammad
regarding the murder of Muhammad Shafiq.

6. When the report under Section 173 Cr. P.C (Challan) was
submitted in Court, an objection was taken that Mst. Zareena
Afshan was one and the same lady and not two different
personalities. After an inquiry it was also held so.

7. In the process of investigation the unknown person was
nominated as Muhammad Iqbal, who was declared Proclaimed
Offender. It is important to mention here that after the decision of
the case, Muhammad Iqbal was also apprehended but acquitted in
2011 on the basis of compromise with legal heirs of deceased.

8. Appellant was arrested on 04.12.2007 and from his

possession a pistol 30 bore was recovered. Statement of
Cri. Appeal No.1717 of 2010 3

Muhammad Shafiq, the then injured, on 30.10.2007 under Section
161 Cr.P.C (PO) was recorded by the investigating officer and it
was claimed as dying declaration.

9. A charge under Sections 302/34 PPC, on 14.04.2009, was
framed against appellant and Mst. Zareena Afshan for which they
pleaded not guilty and demanded the trial, where after, in support

of its case prosecution had produced following witnesses: -

Pw-1 Muhammad Hayat ASI is author

of FIR.
Pw-2 Muhammad_ Shafiq is the
draftsman.

Pw-3 Sher Rasool HC is Moharrar.
Pw-4 Yakki Khan Constable had
executed the proclamation of Muhammad
Iqbal.

Pw-5 Muhammad Asif Constable got
conducted the post-mortem examination
of deceased.

Pw-6 Dr. _ Muhammad ___Faroog
performed the autopsy of deceased.

Pw-7_ Abdul Qayyum Constable had
deposited the parcel of blood-stained
earth in the office of Chemical Examiner.
Pw-8 Dr. Salah-ud-Din made initial
medical examination of Muhammad
Shafiq when he was injured.

Pw-9 Muhammad ___Ibrahim is
complainant and eye witness.

Pw-10 Muhammad Rafiq is also an
eye-witness.

Pw-1l1 Nasrullah Constable is the
witness to arrest of appellant and
recovery of pistol form him.

Pw-12 Ghulam Qasim ASI is the
investigating officer.

Pw-13 Dr. Maria had declared the
injured as fit to make statement.

10. Muhammad Hanif, Ghulam Fareed, Muhammad Yasin and
Ghulam Constable were given up being unnecessary. The learned
ADPP, after producing the reports of Chemical Examiner (PQ) and

Serologist (PR) had closed prosecution’s evidence.
Cri. Appeal No.1717 of 2010 4

11. In his examination made under Section 342 Cr.P.C, version
of appellant was as under: -

“In fact, few days prior to the
occurrence, the parents of the
deceased came in our house and
demanded the hand of my sister Mst.
Zareena Afshan, my co-accused for
deceased and on our refusal, parents
of deceased became annoyed and
when this fact came into the
knowledge of deceased who while
entering in our house tried to outrage
the modesty of my sisters. Meanwhile I
attracted there and gave slaps to the
deceased and the said quarrel was in
the knowledge of parents of the
deceased. Murder of deceased was
committed by some unknown persons
in mysterious circumstances as the
shirt of deceased was found torn and
this fact was noted by the IO during
investigation but they involved me due
to above said quarrel on suspicion. All
PWs are close relative and deposed
against me due to above said grudge.
Furthermore the alleged occurrence
took place in thickly populated area
and the prosecution failed to produce
any independent witness from the
vicinity to corroborate the prosecution
version.”

12. Appellant opted not to produce defence evidence or to
appear in terms of Section 340(2) Cr.P.C.

13. Learned counsel for appellant contended that credibility of
the alleged eye witnesses was found under serious doubts so much
so they were proved to be the false witnesses; they made material
improvements during their statements to bring their evidence in
line with the medical evidence; showing two females with different
names as sisters of appellant and claiming that they hatched the
conspiracy, was an ultimate blast with regard to truthfulness of the
witnesses for the reasons that Zareena Afshan was one and the
same lady; recovery of pistol being inconsequential could not be

considered as corroboration to the ocular account. He finally
Cri. Appeal No.1717 of 2010 5

contended that as prosecution has badly failed to prove its case
beyond shadow of doubt, therefore, learned Trial Court was not
justified to record the conviction.

14. On the other hand learned Deputy Prosecutor General for the
State argued that it was a broad daylight occurrence in the city
area, where appellant and his co-accused arrived and committed
the Qatl-e-Amd of Muhammad Shafiq by way of specific fire made
by appellant; misunderstanding about two personalities with
different names by eye-witnesses of the occurrence could not be a
reason to declare prosecution’s case doubtful; both eye-witnesses
during trial with consistency had narrated the manners of
occurrence and in cross-examination, defence was unable to shatter
their credibility; no enmity existed between the parties, so no
question for false involvement of appellant was there; no doubt
that eye-witnesses were related to deceased but, on this fact alone,
their testimony cannot be termed as unreliable; initial medical
examination and thereafter post-mortem examination of deceased
were strong corroborative pieces of evidence to the ocular account;
statement of Muhammad Shafiq, when he was in hospital in
injured condition, was recorded after seeking declaration of fitness
from the doctor, hence, it was a valid dying declaration; it is settled
principle of law that a person expecting his death cannot make a
false statement; recovery of pistol from the possession of appellant
was also a strong support to ocular account. Learned Law Officer
finally maintained that the learned trial Court had recorded valid
reasons for convicting the appellant, so impugned judgment
requires no interference.

15. Heard.

16. Prosecutions’ story with regard to occurrence is revolving
around the statements of Muhammad Ibrahim (Pw-9) and
Muhammad Rafiq (Pw-10). In FIR admittedly allegation is of

single fire by appellant and that is as under: -
Cri. Appeal No.1717 of 2010 6

Vat yg) Gas a8) iat Ata US (je Gotil 0g phil AS IUK j tae Cli
WS 8 a peg LEY iy og S.9 Unis onal ge LS oy a pty Gadd ee SB Cai Ly Luild
Even no firing in the air was alleged by any of the accused. At this
juncture, I will like to refer the statements of both the Medical
Officers. Dr. Salah-ud-Din (Pw-8) had performed the medical
examined Muhammad Shafiq when he was brought to hospital in

injured condition. He observed as under: -

“Two fire arm entry wounds on_ outer
surfaced of right abdominal wall 4 x 4 C.M
size of each. It was 29 CM from umbilicus
anteriorly and 10 C.M above right iliac
crest”

Dr. Muhammad Farooq (Pw-6), who conducted the postmortem
examination also observed as under: -

“A group of 2 fire arm entry wounds in
healing phase on the right outer surface of
abdomen, 29 CM lateral to umbilicus and 10
CM above right iliac crest”

17. Muhammad Ibrahim (Pw-9) and Muhammad Rafiq (Pw-10)
in their examination-in-chief made clever moves by saying that
“one or two fire shots with pistol were made by appellant and
those hit on Muhammad Shafiq”. Muhammad Ibrahim, on
confrontation from FIR, was found under improvement. When his
attention was drawn with specific contents recorded in FIR, he
made another move by adding that “as it was automatic weapon,
second fire might have been fired from pistol”. Similarly, on
confrontation from his statement recorded under Section 161
Cr.P.C, Muhammad Rafiq (Pw-10) was also responsible for the
improvements in this context as he had claimed earlier only one
fire.

18. There are two kinds of possible improvements by a witness
during trial. One relates to explain certain facts those are
immaterial in nature causing no damage to prosecution’s case. The
others are called deliberate, material and with a specific object,

which in all circumstances shall destroy the veracity of a witness.
Cri. Appeal No.1717 of 2010 7

It is a settled proposition by now that no reliance can be made on
the testimony of a witness who intentionally introduces
improvements in his statement so as to cover the lacunas or to
bring his testimony in line with other pieces of evidence.

19. In similar circumstances, when witnesses made
improvements to bring their statements in line with medical
evidence the honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan in “Sardar Bibi
& another vs. Munir Ahmad & others 2017 SCMR 344” was
pleased to hold as under: -

“As doctor, while conducting postmortem
examination, declared that the deceased
persons received bullet injuries hence for
the first time during trial, Falak Sher and
Sikandar were shown to be armed with
30 bore pistol and Munir being armed
with 7mm rifle. This willful and dishonest
improvement was made by both the
witnesses in order to bring the
prosecution case in line with the medical
evidence. In the FIR the complainant
alleged that fire shot of Falak Sher hit
Zafar Iqbal deceased on his chest and the
fire shot of Sultan Ahmed accused also
hit on the chest of deceased Zafar Iqbal.
According to doctor, there was only one
fire-arm entry wound on the chest of the
deceased Zafar Iqbal. In order to meet
this situation, witnesses for the first time,
during trial made omission and did not
allege that the fire shot of Sultan hit at
the chest of Zafar Iqbal, deceased. So the
improvements and omissions were made
by the witnesses in order to bring the
case of prosecution in line with the
medical evidence. Such dishonest and
deliberate improvement and omission
made them unreliable and they are not
trustworthy witnesses.”

20. The above view also finds support from “Syed Saeed
Muhammad Shah & another vs. The State 1993 SCMR 550”

where it was ruled that: -
Cri. Appeal No.1717 of 2010 8

“Secondly, statements of the witnesses in
the Court in which improvements are
made to strengthen the case of the
prosecution are not worthy of reliance. It
is held in the case of Amir Zaman v.
Mehboob and others (1985 SCMR 685)
that testimony of witnesses containing
material improvements are not
believable. Reference can also be made
to the cases of Haji Bakhsh v. The State
(PLD 1963 Kar. 805), Qaim Din and
others v. The State (1971 P Cr. LJ 229)
and Fazla and another v. The State (PLD
1960 Lah. 373)”

21. Same view was also taken by the apex Court in its latest
pronouncement (Muhammad Arif vs. The State 2019 SCMR 631).
22. Prosecution’s case was that Muhammad Shafiq was present
at crime scene on his rickshaw. Said rickshaw was not produced by
the complainant during investigation. Even its documents were not
placed for consideration before the Investigating Officer. Ghulam
Qasim ASI (Pw-12), in cross-examination, specifically replied that
he had not shown any rickshaw in rough site plan (PL). The same
position was there in the scaled site plan (PB). Circumstances
always play an important role in corroboration to the ocular
account. It is not the case of prosecution that someone had taken
the rickshaw from there, so the question till today is unanswered
that where that rickshaw is? This fact has also created serious dents
in prosecution’s story.

23. Although it was claimed that FIR was recorded promptly,
but I do not find so. The occurrence took place at 12:30 noon.
Police Station was at a distance of one kilometer from crime scene
that was in the city area. Muhammad Ibrahim after taking Medico
Legal Report of Muhammad Shafiq went to police station and FIR
was recorded. It means that prior to 01:45 pm, no one informed the
police about the occurrence. It is an absolute position and cannot
be questioned that priority for complainant was to save the life of

Muhammad Shafiq but this duty to inform the police could be
Cri. Appeal No.1717 of 2010 9

performed by two others, who being his near and dear were
accompanying the complainant.

24. Muhammad Ibrahim, in cross-examination, admitted that
when injured was taken to hospital, his clothes were smeared with
blood. Those clothes to my mind could be considered strong
corroborative piece of evidence to prove his presence at crime
scene but those were never produced before the investigating
officer.

25. Conduct of Muhammad Ibrahim and Abdul Hameed is
repeatedly under heavy clouds of uncertainty. On the same day,
Muhammad Ibrahim made a supplementary statement after
registration of FIR that: -

“He had missed that on the same day at
about 11:00 am Muhammad Shafiq had
gone to the house of Taj Muhammad and
demanded money form him; there was
also present Mst. Zareen and her sister
Mst. Afshan and all they quarreled with
Muhammad Shafiq; Mst. Zareen and
Afshan asked appellant to take revenge of
the said insult; he/complainant and
Muhammad Rafiq were also present and
they heard this conversation”

26. I have observed that while reporting the matter to police,
complainant was having all relevant information, therefore,
missing from memory an important incident of the same day in the
morning, was out of question, so this story was rightly disbelieved
by the learned Trial Court.

27. Since the females nominated by the complainant in his
supplementary statement were related to him therefore question of
misidentification or confusion does not arise. According to record
when incomplete Challan was submitted in Court, appellant was
placed in column No.3. During investigation it transpired that Mst.
Zareena Afshan was one and the same lady and not two
independent personalities. She was placed in column No.2. Second

Challan was submitted with the same status, however, name of
Cri. Appeal No.1717 of 2010 10

Mst. Zareena Afshan was not shown there. The learned Additional
Sessions Judge, on the application of complainant, had summoned
Mst. Afshan and Mst. Zareena to face trial. Mst. Zareena filed a
criminal revision before this Court against that order of
summoning, which was allowed and the learned Trial Court was
directed to hold an inquiry, whether Mst. Zareena Afshan were two
independent ladies with the name of “Zareena” and “Afshan” or it
was the name of one and the same lady as “Zareena Afshan”. On
conclusion of inquiry the learned trial Court found that Mst.
Zareena Afshan was one and the same lady and not two
independent personalities. Those findings of the learned Trial
Court remained unchallenged throughout.

28. If above was the position, then how in supplementary
statement, complainant and Muhammad Rafiq, in his statement
under Section 161 Cr.P.C (DA) categorically stated that they were
two females “Afshan Bibi” and “Zareena Bibi”? Despite this
unchallenged position that she was one and same lady, again
Muhammad Ibrahim and Muhammad Rafiq in their examination-
in-chief maintained that appellant with Mst. Zareena and Mst.
Afshan were present in the house.

29. The above referred facts and discussion made, therefore,
cannot restrain this Court to hold that both witnesses made false
statements in the Court so they cannot be relied upon.

30. Coming to story of motive, it is enough that prosecution was
under heavy burden to prove that at what date, time and place and
in what manners the appellant had borrowed the amount of
Rs.50000/- from complainant party, but this duty was not
discharged so without any further discussion it is held that motive
was not proved in this case.

31. This takes me now to the evidence of dying declaration. The
Phrase “Dying Declaration” means that: -

“A man will not meet his maker with a lie
in his mouth”!

' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying_declaration
Cri. Appeal No.1717 of 2010 11

“No one at the point of death is
presumed to lie”

32. In the law of evidence, adying declaration is testimony that
would normally be barred as hearsay but may be admitted as
evidence in criminal law trials because it constitutes the last words
of a dying person. The rationale is that someone who is dying or
believes death to be imminent would have less incentive to
fabricate testimony, and as such, the hearsay statement carries with
it some reliability.

33. Evidence of dying declaration is universally recognized. In
England and Wales? an original statement made by a dead person
is admissible under the statutory "unavailability" exception subject
to the Courts’ judicial discretion to exclude unreliable evidence.
34. In United States of America under the Federal Rules of
Evidence’, a dying declaration is admissible if the proponent of the
statement can establish that deceased’s statement was made while
under the genuine belief that his or her death was imminent and
that the statement relates to the cause or circumstances of what he
or she believed to be his or her impending death; statement must
relate to the circumstances or the cause of the his own impending
death.

35. The first use of dying declaration exception in American law
was in 1770 murder trial of the British soldiers responsible for
the Boston Massacre®. One of the victims, Patrick Carr, told his
doctor before he died that the soldiers had been provoked. The
doctor's testimony helped defense attorney John Adams to secure
acquittals for some of the defendants and reduced charges for the

rest.

? Nemo moriturus praesumitur mentiri

4 The Federal Rules of Evidence are a set of rules that governs the introduction of evidence at
civil and criminal trials in United States federal trial courts

5 The Boston Massacre was a deadly riot that occurred on March 5, 1770, on King Street in
Boston. It began as a street brawl between American colonists and a lone British soldier, but
quickly escalated to a chaotic, bloody slaughter. The conflict energized anti-British sentiment
and paved the way for the American Revolution. (https://www.history.com/topics/american-
revolution/boston-massacre)
Cri. Appeal No.1717 of 2010 12

36. In Canadian jurisdiction® (R. v. Nurse, 2019 ONCA 260) the
general principles on which evidence of dying declaration is
admitted are that declaration made in extremity: -

i. When the person is at the point of
death.

ii. When every hope of this world is
gone.

iii. When every motive to falsehood is
silenced, and

iv. The mind is induced by the most
powerful considerations to speak
the truth.

37. Dying declaration is also allowed as evidence in Indian
Courts, if the dying person is conscious of his or her danger, he or
she has given up hopes of recovery, the death of the dying person
is the subject of the charge and of the dying declaration, and if the
dying person was capable of a religious sense of accountability to
his or her Maker.

38. In Pakistan, dying declaration is the statement that is made
by the victim of homicide offence and it relates to his/her cause of
death. Under Article 46 of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat, (P.O No. X of
1984), it is a relevant fact when it is made by a person as to cause
of his death, or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction
which resulted in his death.

39. A dying declaration certainly is an important piece of
evidence, which possesses the sanctity on the reason that a dying
man is not expected to tell lie. But this is not an absolute rule, as
by now it is settled principle that dying declaration is a weak type
of evidence as it cannot be challenged in cross-examination,
therefore, the Courts have to evaluate its sanctity with great care
and caution and for that Court must keep in sight that: -

i. Whether the maker has _ the
physical capacity to make the
dying declaration?

6 https://www canlii org/en/on/onca/doc/2019/20190nca260/201 90nca260.html
Cri. Appeal No.1717 of 2010 13

ii. Whether the maker had
opportunity to identify the
assailant/assailants?

iii. Whether there was a chance of
misidentification on the part of
dying man in identifying and
naming the assailants?

iv. Whether it was free from
prompting from any outside
quarter; and?

v. The witness heard the deceased
correctly and whether _ this
evidence can be relied upon?

40. By applying the above tests and principles, now I proceed to
discuss the evidence of dying declaration produced by prosecution
in this case. It is the statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C (PO) that
has been claimed as dying declaration. It is in the statement of
Ghulam Qasim ASI that: -

“‘T went to DHQ Hospital Mianwali
where Muhammad Shafiq was admitted
in an injured condition and I was
informed that he was taken for operation.
On 27.10.2007 I again went to DHQ
Hospital, Mianwali and made the
application EX-PM, doctor opined that
he was not fit for statement. On
28.10.2007 I again went to DHQ hospital
Mianwali and sought the opinion of
doctor about the fitness of Muhammad
Shafiq to make the statement and doctor
gave negative opinion. On 30.10.2007 I
made application EX-PN and lady doctor
opined that Muhammad Shafiq was fit for
statement”

41. One of the considerations to appreciate the dying declaration
is that, it must be free from any outside promptness that means that
at the relevant time no one has to be there to influence the
deceased. Not only this, but also no one met him before his
statement. In the case in hand Ghulam Qasim ASI (Pw-12)
admitted in cross-examination that at the time of recoding of

statement of injured, Muhammad Ibrahim/complainant (Pw-9),
Cri. Appeal No.1717 of 2010 14

Muhammad Rafiq (Pw-10) and Muhammad Hanif were also
present there. This fact alone is enough to discard the evidence of
dying declaration.

42. Investigating officer recorded the statement after seeking
declaration from the lady Doctor, which means that she was
present in hospital at the relevant time. It was his duty to record the
statement in presence of lady doctor and then to obtain her
signatures in token of its correctness with a certificate also that
injured remained conscious throughout during his statement. In
“Mst. Zahida Bibi Vs. The State PLD-2006- SC-255” the facts
were identical with regard to dying declaration as in the case in
hand. Their Lordships were pleased to observe as under: -

“This is an admitted fact that the
statement of the deceased was not
recorded by the Sub-Inspector of police
in hospital in presence of the Doctor and
further neither any member of the
hospital staff was associated at the time
of recording the statement nor it was got
verified by any official of the hospital
that the statement was actually made by
the deceased. Be that as it may, the status
of such a statement would be hardly a
statement under section 161, Cr.PC and
not a dying declaration of the deceased.
This may be seen that the dying
declaration or a statement of a person
without the test of cross examination is a
weak kind of evidence and its credibility
certainly depends upon the authenticity
of the record and the circumstances
under which it is recorded, therefore,
believing or disbelieving the evidence of
dying declaration is a matter of judgment
but it is dangerous to accept such
statement without careful scrutiny of the
evidence and the surrounding
circumstances, to draw a_ correct
conclusion regarding its truthfulness.
The rule of criminal administration of
justice is that the dying declaration like
the statement of an interested witness
requires a close scrutiny and is not to be
believed merely for the reason that dying
Cri. Appeal No.1717 of 2010 15

person is not expected to tell lie. This is
the method of common knowledge that in
such circumstances in preference to any
other person, a Doctor is most
trustworthy and reliable person for a
patient to depose confidence in him with
the expectation of sympathy and better
treatment to disclose the true facts. In the
present case, in the manner in which the
statement of deceased was recorded by
the Sub-Inspector, would seriously reflect
upon its correctness and consequently,
could not be considered worthy of any
credit to be relied upon as dying
declaration.”

43. Even otherwise, the dying declaration was factually
incorrect on the following reasons: -

i. Muhammad Shafiq had alleged
sole fire by appellant whereas
through medical evidence it has
been established that he had
received two fire shots and same
was also maintained by two eye
witnesses.

ii. It is proved that Afshan Zareena is
one and the same lady whereas in
dying declaration he had stated
that they were two different
personalities.

44. The deliberations made above take me to a definite result
that the alleged dying declaration has not been proved by the
prosecution.

45. From the possession of appellant a pistol 30 bore was
recovered on his arrest. As no empty was found at crime scene,
therefore, recovery was inconsequential with no benefit to
prospection.

46. ‘Fiat Justitia’ is the motto of the Court. It is a Latin phrase,
which means ‘Let Justice be done’. Appreciation of evidence

involves weighing the credibility and reliability of the evidence
Cri. Appeal No.1717 of 2010 16

presented in the case. According to Jeremy Bentham’ ‘evidence’ is
any matter of facts, the effect, tendency or design of which is to
produce in the mind, a persuasion, affirmative or dis-affirmative,
of the existence of some other matter of fact. ‘Evidence’ means
and includes all statements, which the Court permits or requires to
be made before it by witnesses, in relation to matters of fact under
enquiry and all documents including electronic records produced
for the inspection of the Court. The standard of proof in Criminal
case is not the same as in the Civil. Importantly, in criminal case,
the burden of proving the guilt of an accused is upon the
prosecution. It must stand by itself. If there is a real and reasonable
doubt as to guilt, the accused is entitled to the benefit of doubt. The
law always requires that the conviction should be certain and not
doubtful.

47. The honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan in “Muhammad
Imran vs. The State 2020 SCMR 857” on the question of benefit
of doubt was pleased to hold that: -

“Tt is by now well settled that benefit of a
single circumstance, deducible from the
record, intriguing upon the integrity of
prosecution case, is to be extended to the
accused without reservation”

48. I have perused the impugned judgment and I feel no
hesitation to say that it is a bad judgment in the eyes of law. Every
finding recorded by learned Trial Judge is contradictory or
imaginary. It appears that at one stage he believed the presence of
eye witnesses but in later discussion he disbelieved them. The
findings on motive and dying declaration are also confusing as it is
difficult to understand that if he had stamped the correctness or not
on both the pieces of evidence. The learned Trial Judge was of the
view that it was a case of two fire shots and he himself assumed.
that second fire was made by Muhammad Iqbal the then

Proclaimed offender. The most astonishing position was that when

7 An English philosopher, jurist, and social reformer regarded as the founder of modern
utilitarianism
*Sharif*

Cri. Appeal No.1717 of 2010 17

learned trial Judge disbelieved the allegations of fire by appellant
and held as under: -

“As far as accused Taj Muhammad is
concerned, the prosecution has proved its
case against accused Taj Muhammad to
the extent that he was present at the time
and place of occurrence and grappled
with deceased Muhammad Shafiq with
co-accused and shared common intention
with his co-accused for the murder of
Muhammad Shafiq deceased”

49. Iam unable to understand that on the basis of what material
learned Trial Judge had drawn above opinion. If he had disbelieved
the presence of eye witnesses and held that it was a case of two fire
shots, then he was supposed to acquit the appellant. I, therefore,
find no difficulty to hold that the learned Trial Judge had convicted
the appellant on the basis of presumptions only.

50. Under Section 367 of Cr.P.C a judgment shall contain the
point or points for determination, the decision, thereon and the
reasons for the decision. The learned Trial Judge has made
complete deviation from the statutory provisions while writing the
impugned judgment.

51. A good judgment must base on deep critical analysis of all
the facts relevant to the case and not on external consideration. It,
in all circumstance, has to be transparent, unambiguous, and
intelligible. It is said that “a judgment should be transparent like
clean water so that people can understand it without any doubt
and probabilities”.

52. Resultantly, this Criminal appeal is allowed. Impugned
judgment dated 27.05.2010 is set aside. Appellant is acquitted from
the case. He is on bail. His surety is discharged from terms and
conditions of bail bonds.
