ORDER

.

Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, J.: After hearing the learned
counsel for the petitioner and going through the relevant record of
the case appended with this petition we have noticed that in the
FIR a collective allegation had been leveled against respondent No.
2 and his co-accused regarding jointly firing at Shahzad Khan
deceased and no specific injury to the deceased stood attributed to
respondent No. 2. Respondent No. 2 had been admitted to post-
arrest bail by the High Court mainly on the ground that his plea of
alibi stood prima facie established through some official record
confirming that on the date of occurrence the respondent was out
of the country. In these circumstances the exercise of jurisdiction
and discretion in the matter by the High Court has not been found

by us to be calling for any interference by this Court. This petition

is, therefore, dismissed and leave to appeal is refused.

2. Before parting with this order we would like to observe that
for allowing bail to respondent No. 2 the learned Judge-in-
Chamber of the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar had passed an
order spanning over as many as twelve typed pages which was
hardly called for in the circumstances of this case. We expect the |
learned Judge-in-Chamber of the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar
to be guided in this regard in future by the judgment passed by
this Court in the case of Muhammad Shakeel v. The State and
others (PLD 2014 SC 458). a
