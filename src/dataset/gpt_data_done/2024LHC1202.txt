No.19212/2019 and writ petition No45101/2019 (Ex. DC & Ex. DD

case was against them and why the PWs had deposed against them, Ghazanfar

Ali alias Manzoor (appellant No.1) made the following deposition: -

“I was involved in this case alongwith my family
members due to enmity of my uncle deceased Nawaz
alias Nawaz who had contracted second marriage
with one Musarrat. My uncle was murdered in fake

in this false case. Nothing has been recovered from
me. All the PWs are official witnesses in this case.
No independent piece of evidence is available on
record in order to connect me with the commission

Crl. Appeal No.67578 of 2019 9

Whereas Waris Ali (appellant No.3) made the following deposition: -

“I was involved in this case due to fake encounter of
my brother Nawaz alias Nawazu by the police. I am
resident of district Nanaka Sahib. My relative
namely Ishfaq is police tout. I have enmity with said
Ishfaq. Due to enmity I was involved falsely by the
police. In fact I was lifted by the police on 26.07.2019
and later on involved me in this false case. Nothing
has been recovered from me. All the PWs are official
witnesses in this case. No independent piece of
evidence is available on record in order to connect
me with the commission of offence or to verify the
prosecution case.”

9. After evaluating the evidence available on record in the light of
arguments advanced from both sides, the trial court found the prosecution
version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, resulting in the

appellants' conviction in the afore-stated terms.

10. We have heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for

the parties and have minutely perused the record on the file.

11. The entire prosecution case against the appellants, Ghazanfar alias
Manzoor, Pervaiz Alias Parwaz, and Waris Ali, rests on the oral evidence of
Muhammad Khalid 182/DC (PW-9), Saif Ullah SI. (PW-12)-complainant, and
Muhammad Akmal 2129/C (PW-13) who claimed to be eyewitnesses to the
incident which took place about 03:10 a.m. on 23.03.2019 wherein Zaheer
Abbas 2138/Constable received firearm injury on his back and exited from the
right side of his chest after passing through a sheet (Tarpaul) of the official
vehicle. Zaheer Abbas 2138/Constable (then injured) was shifted to the THQ
Hospital Sharaqpur Sharif. Later on, Zaheer Abbas, 2138/Constable, was
referred to Mayo Hospital, Lahore, where he succumbed to the injuries. As per
the prosecution case narrated in the written complaint (Ex.PH) and FIR
(Ex.PH/1), five unknown bandits armed with firearm weapons blocked the road
by planting a tree. They were standing there, and the road was also barricaded.
Their faces were visible in the light of the vehicle's headlights. On seeing the

police party, the accused fled towards “Bagh Amrud.” They took cover and
Crl. Appeal No.67578 of 2019 10

opened fire on the police vehicle indiscriminately, and the police did not get a
chance to retaliate. However, the police party made a few fire shots in self-
defense. Meanwhile, one of the robbers’ fire shot hit Zaheer Abbas,
2138/Constable, crossing the “Tarpaul” of the vehicle on the back and exiting
from the side of the chest. The robbers managed to escape towards the garden by
taking advantage of the darkness and opening fire. The narration of allegations
in the written complaint (Ex.PH) and FIR (Ex.PH/1), and later on deposed by
Muhammad Khalid 182/DC (PW-9), Saif Ullah SI. (PW-12)-complainant, and
Muhammad Akmal 2129/C (PW-13) reveals that unknown accused persons
committed the incident wherein, Zaheer Abbas, 2138/Constable lost his life. The
learned Additional Prosecutor General submitted that the prosecution witnesses
identified the appellants during the identification parade on 09.05.2019 and
29.07.2019, respectively. It cannot be disputed that in cases relating to unknown
accused/robbers, the prosecution witnesses! identification of the accused is the
main evidence. The prosecution has to satisfy itself that the witnesses were in a
position to identify the culprits, and before the identification parade, they were
not known to them. If the witnesses nominated the unknown accused before the
identification parade, the identification of the unknown accused during
identification proceedings by the witnesses should not be accepted. In the cases
of unknown accused, any claim that the witnesses identified the culprits for the
offence has to be examined by the Court carefully and diligently concerning the
circumstances of the particular case. Shehbaz Ali Inspector (PW-15)-the

investigating officer deposed during examination-in-chief that: -

“On 05.05.2019 I arrested accused Ghaznfar and
Pervaiz and muffled their faces and locked them

in the lockup of Police Station. On 06.05.2019
both the above said accused were sent to judicial
lockup for identification parade. On 07.05.2019 I
filed application for fixation of date of
identification parade proceedings to Magistrate
who fixed the date as 09.05.2019. On 09.05.2019

identification parade of accused Ghazanfar and
Pervaiz was conducted in District Jail

Sheikhupura in which PWs correctly identified
them .------------- On 25.07.2019 I arrested accused
Crl. Appeal No.67578 of 2019 11

Waris Ali and muffled his face. On 26.07.2019, I
sent_ the accused_to judicial remand for
identification parade. On 27.07.2019 I filed
application before the area Magistrate for
fixation of date of identification parade. On
29.07.2019 identification parade of accused
Waris Ali held at District Jail, Sheikhupura in
which PWs Saif Ullah, Muhammad Khalid and

Muhammad _Akmal correctly identified the
accused.”

During cross-examination, Shehbaz Ali Inspector (PW-15)-the investigating

officer, deposed that: -

66!

The accused were searched from the vicinity
and_periphery of the place of occurrence.
Complainant and PWs disclosed _to_me_the
names of accused persons.”

Muhammad Khalid 182/DC (PW-9) deposed during examination-in-chief that: -

66,

On _ inquiry by local police it came to the
knowledge that Waris Ali, Pervez, Ghazanfar
present before the Court, Imran, Allah Ditta and
Nawaz alias Riaz used to commit dacoity in this
area, hence they were nominated in this case.”

Muhammad Khalid 182/DC (PW-9) admitted during cross-examination that he
(PW-9) nominated the accused, but he could not make a satisfactory reply about
the source of information. The relevant portion of the testimony of Muhammad

Khalid 182/DC (PW-9) is reproduced hereunder: -

“On 26.03.2019 the accused were nominated. I
do not remember upon whose information the
accused were nominated. In my presence none
had_ named the accused. Again stated that the
LO had named the accused persons.”

Similarly, Saif Ullah S.I. (PW-12)-complainant deposed during examination-in-
chief that: -

“On 26.03.2019 iI got__ recorded my
supplementary statement in which I nominated

six accused persons namely Waris, Pervaiz alias

Parwaz, Ghaznfar, Allah Ditta, Imran and

Nawaz alias Riaz.”
Crl. Appeal No.67578 of 2019 12

Saif Ullah SI. (PW-12)-complainant also deposed during cross-examination

that: -

eo

Some _ spy had _ informed the names and
parentages of the accused persons.”

Muhammad Akmal 2129/C (PW-13) deposed during examination-in-chief that: -

eo

T nominated six accused persons namely Waris,
Pervaiz alias Parwaz, Ghaznfar, Allah Ditta

Imran and Nawaz alias Riaz. 1.O recorded my
statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C.”

Muhammad Akmal 2129/C (PW-13) also deposed during cross-examination
that: -

eo

had_named_the accused_in_ my _ statement
however, I_had not recorded the description of

accused persons in my statement recorded on
26.03.2019. I had not recorded the names of

from my own sources. We came to know about

the _accused_persons after_one day of the
occurrence.”

The deposition of Muhammad Khalid 182/DC (PW-9), Saif Ullah
S.I. (PW-12)-complainant, Muhammad Akmal 2129/C (PW-13), and Shehbaz
Ali Inspector (PW-15)-the investigating officer, reveals that the appellants were
named as accused on 26.03.2019 before the proceedings of identification parade.
Shehbaz Ali Inspector (PW-15)-the investigating officer also obtained non-
bailable warrants of arrest of the appellants. On perusal of the non-bailable
warrant of arrest Ex-PL, it reveals that the same was issued on 02.05.2019 by
mentioning the name, parentage, caste, and address of the appellant, Waris Ali.
Muhammad Mushtaq ASI (PW-10) also deposed during examination-in-chief
that: -

eo

Stated that on 02.05.2019 I was posted at Police
Station Shargpur Sharif, Sheikhupura. On the
same day, non bailable warrants of arrest_of
accused Waris Ali Ex.PL and Allah Ditta Ex.PM

were handed _over_to_ me by the I.O for
execution.”
Crl. Appeal No.67578 of 2019 13

The description of the unknown accused persons was not at all
mentioned in the FIR, nor was their description made in the statements of the
prosecution witnesses. In the circumstances, we have found _ that
improvement/contradiction in the prosecution evidence was brought to the
record by the defence. Muhammad Khalid 182/DC (PW-9) deposed during

cross-examination that: -

“I had recorded the physical features height,

weight, colour complexion and age etc. in my
statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. Confronted with

Ex.DA where it is not so recorded.”

Before discussing further evidence on record, it is necessary to note
that the defence taken by the appellants at the first point of time is set out in
Ex.PZ, and Ex.PAA, and later in Mark-A, Ex.DC, and Ex.DD, wherein the
defence of the appellants is one of the entire denials of the prosecution case
about the date of their arrest, and they have taken a specific stand that they were
in the illegal custody of the law-enforcing agency. Admittedly, Farhat Bibi,
mother of the appellants, Ghazanfar Ali alias Manzoor and Pervaiz alias Parwaz
filed W.P. No.19219 of 2019 titled “Farhat Bibi. Vs. Inspector General of Police
Punjab Lahore, etc.” on 01.04.2019 before Lahore High Court, Lahore under
Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 for the
recovery of Ghazanfar Ali alias Manzoor (the appellant No. 1), Parwaz Ali (the
appellant No.2), and her other sons and daughters from the illegal and unlawful
detention of police officials, which were taken into custody by the police
officers on 29.03.2019 and apprehension of fake police encounter was also
shown. After that, the Single Bench of this Court, vide order dated 01.04.2019,
directed respondents to produce the alleged detenues before this Court on
03.04.2019. After that, the case was listed for 03.04.2019, 09.04.2019,
22.04.2019, and 30.04.2019, but the alleged detenues were not produced, and
time was sought for their recovery. Ultimately, vide order dated 10.05.2019 (Ex.
DC), the court was informed about the arrest of the appellants, Ghzanfar Ali
alias Manzoor and Pervaiz alias Parwaz, alleged detenues on 05.05.2019, in case

FIR No.202/2019, registered at Police Station Sharaqpur Sharif, District
Crl. Appeal No.67578 of 2019 14

Sheikhupura. Mst. Farhat Bibi also filed another W.P. No.45101 of 2019 titled
“Mst. Farhat Bibi. Vs. Inspector General of Police and others” on 24.07.2019 for
the recovery of his brother-in-law (5:5), Waris Ali (the appellant No.3) and his
family members, who were stated to be taken into custody by the police officers.
The order dated 26.07.2019 (Ex. DD) passed by Single Bench of Lahore High
Court, Lahore, reveals that the S.H.O Police Station Sharqpur Sharif furnished a
report that the appellant-Waris Ali had been arrested on 25.07.2019 in case FIR
No.202/2019 registered at P.S. Sharqpur Sharif. Shahbaz Ali Inspector (PW-15)-
the investigating officer pleaded ignorance during his testimony about the filling
of a habeas petition/constitutional petition No. 19212/2019 on 01.04.2019 by the
mother of Ghazanfar Ali alias Manzoor (the appellant No. 1), Parwaz Ali (the
appellant No.2). On perusal of writ petition No.19212 of 2019 it reveals that
Farhat Bibi, mother of the appellants No.1 and 2, impleaded SHO police station
Sharaqpur, and DPO District Sheikhupura as respondents. It is out of our
imagination that the SHO police station Sharaqpur was unaware that the High
Court had directed police officers to recover and produce appellants No.1 and 2,
along with their family members, before the court. Whereas, during the
pendency of W.P. No.19219 of 2019 titled “Farhat Bibi. Vs. Inspector General
of Police Punjab Lahore, etc.” from 01.04.2019 till 10.05.2019, FIR No.220
dated 30.03.2019, registered under section 302, 395,511 PPC 13-2A/20/65 PAO
at Police Station Sharqpur Sharif, District Sheikhupura, about the murder of
Muhammad Nawaz alias Riaz, on the complaint of Abdullah Ali Yousaf
Inspector (given up being unnecessary) by his co-accused persons Ghazanfar Ali
alias Manzoor and Pervaiz alias Parwaz, (appellants No.1 & 2) etc. The police
officers, including Abdullah Inspector (given up being unnecessary), appeared
before Lahore High Court, Lahore, during proceedings of W.P. No.19219 of
2019, but they did not take the plea that the appellants were also required to
police in FIR No.202 dated 23.03.2019 and the detenues Ghazanfar Ali alias
Manzoor, Pervaiz alias Parwaz, and Waris etc. were also named in instant case
during investigation on 26.03.2019 and they are required to police. Shahbaz Ali
Inspector (PW-15)-the investigating officer deposed during cross-examination

that: -
Crl. Appeal No.67578 of 2019 15

“As per story of FIR the occurrence in which
Nawaz alias Riaz accused was murdered _ is
annexed with the challan. Again stated that
place of occurrence of case FIR No.220/2019 is

different from the place of occurrence of this
FIR i.e. 202/2019.------------- It_is not in m

knowledge that accused Nawaz, Ghaznfar,
Pervaiz, Serfaraz and Amjad were arrested on
night falling 29/30.03.2019 from Mouza Dhool

not in my knowledge that mother of accused

Ghaznfar and Pervaiz filed habeas/writ petition
No.19212/19 on 01.04.2019 before the Hon’ble

Lahore High Court, Lahore. I alongwith two
constables produced accused Waris in Hon’ble
Lahore High Court, Lahore on 26.07.2019.”

12. As per the prosecution version, prosecution witnesses, i.e.,
Muhammad Khalid 182/D.C (PW-9), Saif Ullah S.I. (PW-12), and Muhammad
Akmal 2129/C (PW-13), had identified the appellants-Ghazanfar Ali alias
Manzoor, Pervaiz alias Parwaz and Waris Ali during the identification parade
held on 09.05.2019 and 29.07.2019 respectively under the supervision of Hafiz
Muhammad Saleem Tahir Magistrate Ist Class, Sheikhupura (PW-18). The
deposition of Hafiz Muhammad Saleem Tahir Magistrate Ist Class (PW-18) and
the proceedings of the test identification parade (Ex. PZ & Ex. PAA) reveal that
prosecution witnesses i.e. Muhammad Khalid 182/D.C (PW-9), Saif Ullah SI.
(PW-12), and Muhammad Akmal 2129/C (PW-13) had identified the appellants-
Ghzanfar Ali alias Manzoor, Pervaiz alias Parwaz and Waris Ali in identification
parade. Hafiz Muhammad Saleem Tahir Magistrate 1“ Class (PW-18) has

deposed explicitly in his examination-in-chief that: -

“After sitting the suspect at position No.2 the
witness namely Muhammad Akmal 2129/C was
called who correctly identified the accused
Ghaznfar alias Manzoor by describing his role.
The objection of accused_was also noted down
that he remained in different Police Stations for
about 30 days in this regard his mother filed
Writ Petition before the Hon’ble Lahore High
Court, Lahore.--------------- All the dummies
have same features as were the accused Pervaiz

alias Parwaz. After sitting the suspect_with the

detention. He told that he has been detained for

After sitting the suspect _at_position No.2 the
witness namely Muhammad Akmal 2129/C_was
called who correctly identified the accused
Pervaiz alias Parwaz by describing his role. The
objection of accused _was also noted down that
he remained in different Police Stations for
about 30 days in this regard his mother filed

Writ Petition before the Hon’ble Lahore High
Court, Lahore. ------------- The objection _of

accused was also noted down that he remained

in detention at Police Station Sharqpur_for
about 08 days in this regard mother of his
cousin filed Writ Petition before the Hon’ble

Lahore High Court, Lahore. The objection of
accused was also noted down that he remained
in different Police Stations for about 30 days in
this regard his mother filed Writ Petition before
the Hon’ble Lahore High Court, Lahore.”

The objections raised by the appellants, Pervaiz alias Parwaz and
Waris Ali, were incorporated in the proceedings of the identification parade
(Ex.PZ) held on 09.05.2019. The objection raised by Waris Ali (the appellant
No.3) and recorded by Hafiz Muhammad Saleem Tahir, Magistrate Ist Class,
Sheikhupura (PW-18) in the proceedings of the identification parade (Ex.PAA)
on 29.07.2019, reads as under:-

“The suspect Waris Ali objected that the local
police detained him for 8 days in different
police station Sharagpur Shareef. My cousins
were arrested by the police. In result _of writ
petition filed in High Court. The police arrested
me and my cousins from our houses, then police
encountered my uncle and than locked me and
my _brother_in Jail. The local police falsely
implicated in the instant case. Police make my
pictures.”

The above objection raised by Waris Ali (the appellant No.3) got support from
the testimony of Abu Bakar 646/C (PW-1), which reads as under:-

“Stated that on 30.03.2019 I was posted at Police
Station Sharqpur Sharif, Sheikhupura. On the
Crl. Appeal No.67578 of 2019 17

same day, Adeel Subhani and I escorted the dead
body of Nawaz alias Riaz to the dead house of
THQ Sharqpur Sharif alongwith police papers for
postmortem examination test.”

Muhammad Boota A.S.I. (PW-11) deposed during his examination
in chief that on 30.03.2019, he received a complaint, which was sent to him by
Abdul Ali Yousaf Inspector (given up being unnecessary) for registration of
FIR, after that he (PW-11) chalked out computer generated FIR No.220/2019 at
Police Station Sharqpur Sharif, Sheikhupura (Ex. PP), (Ex. PP is also marked as
Mark-A). During cross-examination, Muhammad Boota A.S.I. (PW-11) deposed
that: -

“The accused persons of case FIR No.202/2019

and_220/2019 Police Station Shargpur Sharif are
the same and there is the connection between two

cases.”

Already apprehension of police encounter was shown that the
detenues would be murdered in a police encounter by Farhat Bibi, mother of the
appellants, Ghazanfar Ali alias Manzoor and Pervaiz alias Parwaz in WP.
No.19212 of 2019, titled “Farhat Bibi. Vs. Inspector General Police Punjab,
etc.” and on 30-04-2019, FIR No.220/2019 was registered at Police Station
Shargpur Sharif, District Sheikhupura about the murder of Muhammad Nawaz
alias Riaz, on the complaint of Abdullah Ali Yousaf Inspector (given up being
unnecessary), wherein it was alleged that on 30.03.2019 at 08:20 am. the
robbers were busy robbing people, seeing the police vehicle, they entered the
garden and started firing indiscriminately; when the firing of the accused
stopped, the garden was surrounded and checked; an unknown accused was
lying injured in the garden, who, on discovery, gave his name and address and
named his co-accused, who was shot by his co-accused persons Ghzanfar Ali
alias Manzoor and Pervaiz alias Parwaz etc. Muhammad Khalid 182/DC (PW-9)

deposed during cross-examination that: -

“Nawaz, one of the accused, was murdered on
30.03.2019. ---------- Nawaz accused was murdered

at_the same place where constable Zaheer
Crl. Appeal No.67578 of 2019 18

sustained injuries. Said Nawaz was brother _of
Waris accused.”

Coming to the facts of the instant case, as per the prosecution
version, the prosecution took the services of an official foot tracker. Muhammad
Khalid 182/D.C (PW-9) deposed that on 26.03.2019, he, alongwith Muhammad
Akmal 2129/C (PW-13) and Saif Ullah A.S.I (PW-12), joined the investigation
with Shahbaz Ali Inspector (PW-15)-the investigating officer. The official foot
tracker (Khoji) followed the footprints (Khura) traces, which led to Madhar
Sharif Graveyard Dera Mochian to locate the assailants of the occurrence on
23.03.2019. During cross-examination, Muhammad Khalid 182/D.C (PW-9)
deposed that: -

“We traced the accused by following their foot
traces. I also entered into the garden at 4:00 a.m.
There was Barseem (Shitala) crop in the garden.
Because of dew (Shabnam) their foot traces were
available. Khoji (foot tracer) reached at the place

of occurrence at _6/6:30 a.m. I remained at the

place of occurrence and did not company the foot
tracer.”

Saif Ullah S.I. (PW-12)-the complainant deposed during examination-in-chief
that: -

“The official foot tracer _(Khoji) followed the
traces of foot prints (Khura) which led to Madhar
Sharif Graveyard Dera Mochian.”

Saif Ullah S.I. (PW-12)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination
that:-

“Foot_tracer/Khoji_ reached at the place _of
occurrence after two hours. I alongwith so many
other_police officials joined foot tracer. Akmal,
Khalid and I were with the Khoji/foot_tracer.
There were Baseem/Shitala crop about 4/5 inches
high in the garden adjacent to the place of
occurrence. After the garden there was an open
field. We stopped after_a distance of about one
kilometer. I had not been told that who had

informed _Khoji/foot_tracer_about_the accused
ersons. ------------- When we reached at mattle
road_the foot prints of the dacoits were
untraceable. I alongwith PWs came back and the

Crl. Appeal No.67578 of 2019 19

foot _tracer_continued to search out the accused

persons. I remember _the names of accused
persons.”

Muhammad Akmal 2129/C (PW-13) deposed in his examination-in-chief that:-

“On 26.03.2019 I joined investigation before the
1.0. The official foot tracer _(Khoji) followed the
traces of foot prints (Khura) which led to Madhar

Sharif Graveyard Dera Mochian.” During cross-
examination, he (PW-13) admitted, “I_had not visited

the place of occurrence on 26.03.2019.”

Admittedly, the prosecution did not produce the official foot tracker
before the trial court to substantiate the plea that foot molds were taken. Only
the above-mentioned prosecution witnesses, i.e., Muhammad Khalid 182/D.C
(PW-9), Saif Ullah S.I. (PW-12)-the complainant, and Muhammad Akmal
2129/C (PW-13) deposed about the fact that services of official foot tracker were
obtained. Admittedly, the prosecution witnesses, i.c.. Muhammad Khalid
182/D.C (PW-9), Saif Ullah S.I. (PW-12)-the complainant, and Muhammad
Akmal 2129/C (PW-13), admitted that they named the accused as the culprits of
the incident that took place on 23.03.2019 at 09:10 a.m. Still, they failed to
disclose their source of information. After that, Shahbaz Ali Inspector (PW-15)-
the investigating officer, deposed that he tried to arrest the accused persons; he
(PW-15)-the investigating officer also got issued non-bailable warrants of arrest
of the accused named by the prosecution witnesses ic. Muhammad Khalid
182/D.C (PW-9), Saif Ullah S.I. (PW-12)-the complainant and Muhammad
Akmal 2129/C (PW-13) but could not arrest the appellants till 05.05.2019.
Whereas the order dated 10.05.2019 passed in W.P. No.19212 of 2019 (Ex. DC)
reveals that the appellants Ghzanfar Ali alias Manzoor and Pervaiz alias Parwaz
were arrested on 05.05.2019, whereas the order dated 26.07.2019 passed in W.P.
No.45101 of 2019 (Ex. DD) reveals that the appellant, Waris Ali was arrested on
25.07.2019. Admittedly, Farhat Bibi, mother of the appellants, Ghzanfar Ali
alias Manzoor and Pervaiz alias Parwaz, and sister-in-law of the appellant-Waris
Ali, on missing of the appellants, approached this Court through the

constitutional petitions for their recovery. It is admitted that during the pendency
Crl. Appeal No.67578 of 2019 20

of the above-mentioned writ petitions, the appellants' arrest was shown in the
record in case FIR No.202/2019 (Ex.PH/1). Under the circumstances mentioned
above, the identification parade lost its efficacy in the presence of the testimony
of Muhammad Khalid 182/D.C (PW-9), Saif Ullah SI. (PW-12), and
Muhammad Akmal 2129/C (PW-13) that they named the appellants along with
others as culprits of the incident that took place on 23.03.2019 as said
identification parade was conducted after the nomination of the accused on
26.03.2019 in the case. Identifying the accused persons already known to the
identifier is futile, and we cannot attach much value to such an identification

parade.

13. As far as recoveries of rifle 303 calibers (P-3), alongwith one crime
empty (P-4) from the chamber and two live bullets (P-5/102) from the magazine
on the pointing of Ghazanfar Ali alias Manzoor (appellant No.1), rifle 303
calibers (P-6), alongwith one crime empty (P-7) from the chamber and two live
bullets (P-8/102) from the magazine on the pointing of Pervaiz alias Parwaz
(appellant No.2) and positive report of FSL (Ex.PDD) are concerned, it does not
support the prosecution case as parcels of crime empties and other evidence
collected and secured by Waseem Abbas (PW-17)- Junior Forensic Scientist
along with other team members of PFSA from the crime scene on 23.03.2019
and sent to Punjab Forensic Science Laboratory, Lahore on 26.03.2019 by Zaka
Ullah ASI (PW-7) and deposited by Shahbaz Ali Inspector (PW-15)-the
investigating officer on 26.03.2019. The sealed parcel of rifle 303 calibers (P-3),
alongwith sealed parcel of one crime empty (P-4), recovered from the chamber
on the pointing of Ghazanfar Ali alias Manzoor (appellant No.1), and sealed
parcel rifle 303 calibers (P-6), alongwith sealed parcel of one crime empty (P-7),
recovered from the chamber on the pointing of Pervaiz alias Parwaz (appellant
No.2) on 24.05.2019 were handed over to Muhammad Awais 1604/HC (PW-6)
by Shahbaz Ali Inspector (PW-15)-the investigating officer. The same parcels
were handed over by Muhammad Awais 1604/HC (PW-6) to Shahbaz Ali
Inspector (PW-15)-the investigating officer, on 17.06.2019 for onward

transmission to the Punjab Forensic Science Laboratory, Lahore, and same, i.e.,
Crl. Appeal No.67578 of 2019 21

sealed parcel of rifle 303 calibers (P-3), alongwith sealed parcel of one crime
empty (P-4), sealed parcel of rifle 303 calibers (P-6), and sealed parcel of one
crime empty (P-7), were deposited by Shahbaz Ali Inspector (PW-15)-the
investigating officer on the same day, i.e., 17.06.2019 with the office of the
Punjab Forensic Science Laboratory, Lahore. The positive report of FSL (Ex.
PDD) of Punjab Forensic Science Laboratory, Lahore, reveals that the rifles 303
calibers (P-3 and P-6) matched with the cartridges submitted on 17.06.2019,
which were recovered from the chambers of rifles 303 calibers (P-3 and P-6)
recovered on the pointing of Ghazanfar Ali alias Manzoor and Pervaiz alias
Parwaz, the appellants. Admittedly, the crime empties sent to the Punjab
Forensic Science Laboratory, Lahore on 26.03.2019, were not matched with the
rifles 303 calibers (P-3 and P-6) recovered at the pointing of Ghzanfar Ali alias
Manzoor and Pervaiz alias Parwaz, the appellants, so the positive report (Ex.

PDD) is of no consequence.

14. The recoveries of rifle 7-MM (P-9) along with 03 live bullets (P-
10/1-3) on the pointing of Waris Ali, the appellant No.3, on 16.08.2019 is of no
consequence as the report of Punjab Forensic Science Laboratory, Lahore (Exh.
PFF) is only to the effect that the rifle 7-MM (P-9) allegedly recovered from the
accused/appellant was in mechanical operating condition. So, the recovery from

Waris Ali, the appellant, is of no consequence.

15. From the detailed discussion above, we are convinced that the
prosecution has failed to establish its case. The truth was seen buried under the
debris, and a different story was structured perhaps to lug the appellants into trial
under the serious offense. It is often said “that Fouler the crime higher the
decree of proof.” we have gone through the process of keen examination of the
entire material and found compelling reasons, as stated above, to disagree with
the conclusion recorded by the learned Judge Anti-Terrorism Court-II, Lahore
and also found that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the guilt of the
accused-appellants beyond reasonable doubt. Per the dictates of law, the benefit
of every doubt will be extended in favor of the accused. In the case of

“Muhammad Akram v. The State” (2009 SCMR 230), it is held as under: -
Crl. Appeal No.67578 of 2019 22

16.

filed by the appellants-Ghzanfar Ali alias Manzoor, Pervaiz alias Parwaz and
Waris Ali; as a result, whereof conviction and sentence recorded by the trial
Court vide judgment dated 28.10.2019 is set-aside, and the appellants are
acquitted of the charge in case F.I.R. No.202/2019 dated 23.03.2019, offences
under Sections 302, 353, 186, 148, 149 P.P.C and section 7 of Anti-Terrorism
Act, 1997 registered at Police Station Sharqpur Sharif, District Sheikhupura.

They (the appellants) are directed to be released forthwith, if not required in any

other case.

“The nutshell of the whole discussion is that the
prosecution case is not free from doubt. It is an
axiomatic principle of law that in case of doubt,
the benefit thereof must accrue in favour of the
accused as matter of right and not of grace. It
was observed by this Court in the case of Tariq
Pervez v. The State 1995 SCMR 1345 that for
giving the benefit of doubt, it was not necessary
that there should be many circumstances
creating doubts. If there is circumstance which
created reasonable doubt in a prudent mind
about the guilt of the accused, then the accused
would be entitled to the benefit of doubt not as a
matter of grace and concession but as a matter of
right.”

We, therefore, accept in toto Criminal Appeal No.67578 of 2019
