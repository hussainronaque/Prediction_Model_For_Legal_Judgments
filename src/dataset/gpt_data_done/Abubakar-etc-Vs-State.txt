JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.- Petitioners

(1) Abubakar and (2) Muhammad Ishaq, seek bail in case
FIR No.779 dated 12.08.2015, registered under sections
302/324/34 PPC, in Police Station Chamkani, Peshawar,
wherein they alongwith absconding co-accused are
charged for attempting at the lives of complainant
Muhammad Qasim, his son Danyal by firing at them, as a
result they sustained firearm injuries. Demand of amount
by the accused from the complainant party has been
alleged as motive behind the incident; that due to firing of
the accused, a passerby, namely, Akhtar Munir lost his life
while passersby, Ibrar and Suleman sustained firearm
injuries.

2. Arguments heard and record perused.

3. It appears from the record that about the same
incident FIR No.780 dated 12.08.2015 has been registered
on the report of Muhammad Abubakar (one of the
petitioner herein), wherein he besides charging other
accused, charged accused Qasim and Danyal (injured of
the instant case), for attempting at the lives of complainant
and his companions, causing injuries to passerby Sadaqat
and committing the murder of his brother Danish and a
passerby Akhtar Munir. Time, date and venue of
occurrence as well as the parties of both the FIRs are the
same, therefore, falls within the definition of cross-cases.
At the moment it is certain as to which party was aggressor
and which was aggressed upon as in such like cases self-
defence is a plausible plea, which is normally taken. In this
view of the matter, who attacked and who acted in self
defence, is a matter of further inquiry which is yet to be
determined during trial after recording evidence, however,
it makes the case of the petitioners arguable for the purpose
of bail. In this regard guidance may be derived from cases
titled, “Hamza Ali Hamza & others Vs The State” (2010 S C
M R 1219), “Muhammad Shahzad Siddique Vs The State &
another” (P L D 2009 S C, 58), “Shoaib Mehmood Butt Vs
Iftikhar-ul-Haq and 3 others” (1996 S C M R, 1845).

4. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.

Petitioners are admitted to bail provided each one of them

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

furnishes bail bonds to the tune of Rs.3,00,000/- with two
local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD, concerned.

Announced
