SOHAIL NASIR, J. For avoiding any confusion in

discussion to be made later on it is observed that “The Punjab Pure

Food Ordinance, (VII of 1960) {PPFO} was promulgated on nw"

March, 1960 in which certain amendments were made time to time.
It was6" July, 2011, when ‘The Punjab Food Authority Act (XVI of
2011) {PFAA} was also enforced. By way of its’ Section 58(1)

‘PPFO’ was repealed, however under Clause 3 some of the

provisions were declared to continue to remain in force. It is as

under: -

“The standards, safety requirements and
other provisions of the repealed
Ordinance or the rules made thereunder,
shall, to the extent of consistency with the
Act, continue to remain in force till the
standards, safety requirements are
prescribed under the Act”’

2. Later on‘ The Punjab Pure Food (Amendment) Act (VI of

2016) also came into field on 06" February, 2016 with the following

preamble: -

“Tt is necessary further to amend the
Punjab Pure Food, Ordinance (VII of
1960) to provide for more effective
enforcement of the law, rationalization of
punishments, and for other purposes”’

3. The amendments were made in Sections 2, 17, 21, 29, 30, 35
and Schedule of the ‘PPFO’. Sections 23, 23-A and 36 were
substituted, whereas Sections 35-A, 35-B, 3-C and 35-D were
inserted in the said Ordinance.

4. Therefore, right now ‘PF AA’ is an enforced legislation and at
the same time the standards, safety requirements and other
provisions of ‘PPFO’, to the extent of consistency with the
‘PFAA’,also holds the field.

5. Coming to the case, Muhammad Mukhtiar and Muhammad

' Court of a Magistrate exercising the powers under Section 30 Cr.P.C, established under

Criminal Appeal No.44 of 2018/BWP. 3

All sentences were ordered to run
concurrently. Benefit of Section 382-B,
Cr.P.C was also extended to the
appellants.

6. Feeling aggrieved from the judgment of learned Special
Court, appellants have approached this Court by filing the appeal
under Section 29-N of the ‘PPFO’.

7. Facts of the case, as evident from complaint (PA), are that Dr.
Zeeshan Rauf (Pw-1) received an information that Muhammad
Mukhtiar was running a factory of lemon bottles; taking benefit of
that business, he was also preparing misbranded/adulterated Cold
Drinks of ‘Coca Cola’, ‘Sprite’ and ‘Mirinda’ etc; Rana Muhammad
Saleem, Food Inspector (Pw-2) made bargain with Muhammad
Mukhtiar for purchase of different brands of the Cold Drinks where
after, on 24.05.2017, a raid was conducted at the factory where both
appellants were apprehended, however, one Muhammad Kashif was
succeeded to escape; there was one bag containing caps of bottles,
one bag of labels of Coca Cola, one bag of caps of different brands,
one bag of Citric Acids, 30 packs of Sprite and Coca Cola (one
litter), three packs of Sprite (1.5 liter) and 25 packs of Coca
Cola(1.5 liter). According to complaint the recovered material was
made into sealed parcels after separation of samples.

8. On the basis of above complaint FIR (PG) was recorded by
Muhammad Ilyas S.I (Pw-3) where after conclusion of investigation
resulted into submission of report (Challan)under Section 173
Cr.P.C in Court.

9. A charge under Sections 23-A/23-B/23-D/23-G/23-F of the
‘PPFO’ was framed against appellants on 28.09.2017, which they
pleaded not guilty and demanded their trial.

Rauf (Pw-1), Rana Muhammad Saleem (Pw-2), Muhammad Ilyas
S.I(Pw-3) and Muhammad Asghar Constable (Pw-4).

11. Both appellants were examined under Section 342 Cr.P.C
where they pleaded their innocence.

12. HEARD

13. There are serious questions of sealing, sampling and safe
custody thereof involved in this case. Under Section 20 of the
‘PPFO’ methods of taking samples is provided and that is as under: -

“(1)An Inspector after purchasing or
procuring or seizing any food with the
intention of submitting the same for analysis
shall, forthwith, divide the food in three
parts to be then and there separated and
each part shall be marked, sealed or
fastened in such manner as the nature of the
case will permit; and the person from whom
the sample is taken may, if he so desires,
also affix his seal or mark on each of the
three parts.

(2) An Inspector shall—

(a) ifrequired to do so, deliver one part to
the person from whom the article is
purchased or seized or the sample is taken;
(b) retain one part for future comparison;
and

(c) submit one part to the Public Analyst:
Provided that..................

14. In this case raid was conducted by Dr. Zeeshan Rauf, District
Officer (Health). Under Section 2(13) of ‘PPFO’ “Health Officer”
means: -

“The District Health Officer or the
Assistant District Health Officer and
includes a Medical Officer of Health, an
Assistant Medical Officer of Health of a
Local Authority, and any other person
appointed by Government to be Health
Officer for the purposes of this
Ordinance”’

15. Later on by way of an amendment” the words ‘District Health
Officer’ and the ‘Assistant District Health Officer’ were substituted
by ‘District Officer (Health)? and ‘Deputy Officer (Health)’.

2 Punjab Pure Food (Amendment) Ordinance, 2001 dated 21 December, 2001
Criminal Appeal No.44 of 2018/BWP. 5

Through the same Amending Ordinance, Clause (4) was inserted in
Section 16 of the ‘PPFO’ which says that the Health Officer and
Sanitary Inspector shall be ‘ex-officio’ Inspectors in respect of all
foods within the limits of their respective jurisdiction.
16. Therefore raid by Dr. Zeeshan Rauf District Officer (Health)
was in the capacity of an ex-officio Inspector.
17. It is also important to mention here in terms of Section 2(f) of
‘PFAA’ a Drink falls within the definition of ‘Food’.
18. Finally under Section 21 of the ‘PPFO’ the Public Analyst
upon receiving of sample of food shall as soon as possible analyze
the same and issue a report showing the result.
19. Position in the case in hand is otherwise. Dr. Zeeshan Rauf
(Pw-1) in his examination-in-chief simply stated that: -
Spas 3 Cull! Shy 26S dee 3) ail dros ObIS 59 5 Se
Ge es: Sas Ut ys) 5! ei Clee
20. Rana Muhammad Saleem/Food Inspector (Pw-2) did not state
a single word about preparation of any parcel of sample or
recovered Drinks. Relevant portion of his examination-in-chief is as
under: -

21. Similarly, Muhammad Ilyas S.I (Pw-3) also denied about
preparation of any parcel. He said that: -
Lea ES 3 ew 58 Cold) 3 as cee mad noche Ue ga yp ab ya”
22. Appellants have been convicted for keeping the adulterated
/misbranded material, on the basis of reports of “Government Public
Analyst Punjab Food Authority Multan’(PB & PC). For the sake of
arguments if it is presumed that provisions of Section 20 of the

‘PPFO’ were complied with by the Inspector in its letter and spirit,
Criminal Appeal No.44 of 2018/BWP. 6

still there is another challenge for prosecution that is proof of ‘chain
of safe custody’ of the parcels of samples. It is argued by learned
DPG that question of chain of safe custody shall be applicable only
in case of recovery of Narcotics. This argument is devoid of force.
To my mind for safe administration of justice, in every case where
prosecution relies on the report of an expert and demands conviction
on the basis thereof, it cannot deviate from the duty to establish the
chain of safe custody which means safe transmission of the alleged
material from spot of recovery till its’ receipt by the Government

Analyst. Therefore prosecution must prove that: -

i. Parcels were made at crime scene
in accordance with the procedure
prescribed by the law.

ii. Before dispatch of parcels of

samples to the Government Analyst,
those were kept in safe custody by
an authorized officer.

iii. Those were deposited by an official
in the office of Government Analyst.

23. This chain has to establish by producing all relevant witnesses
in the Court. It must be unbroken, unsuspicious, indubitable, safe
and secure. Any break in the chain will cast doubts on the safe
custody and authenticity of the Report of the Government Analyst.
24. The Drinksand other material were taken into possession on
24.05.2017. Reports of Government Analyst(PB and PC)show that
the samples were received personally in that office on
26.05.2017.But the statements of all witnesses are silent that during
the intervening period where those parcels remained? Who the
official was, he deposited those parcels in that office? Although Dr.
Zeeshan Rauf (Pw-1) stated that: -
AS Alse dies 9S Gud) Shy

But by whom, he was completely silent throughout his statement.
Even today prosecution has no answer about the one who had taken

the parcels to the office of Government Analyst.
Criminal Appeal No.44 of 2018/BWP. 7

25. Law has also prescribed the procedure for sending the
samples to an expert. Rule 50(3) of ‘The Punjab Pure Food Rules,
2011’ is the relevant Rule showing that how a sample has to be
forwarded to expert. It says as under: -

“The sealed container of one part of the
sample shall be forwarded to the Public
Analyst immediately but not later than the
succeeding working day by any suitable
means, along with a letter in Form 5
giving full particulars of the sample and

enclosing a clear impression of the seal
used for packing”. (Emphasized)

26. Prosecution has not produced Form 5 to show that how and in
what manners and by whom the samples were sent to that office?
The relevant columns of reports of expert with regard to ‘sealed
with’ is also blank. It means that there was no specific seal on any
of the parcel if was sent to Government Analyst.

27. It is surprising that on one hand Dr. Zeeshan Rauf (Pw-1)
claimed that he got dispatched the parcels to Government Analyst,
whereas, on the other hand Food Inspector Rana Muhammad
Saleem (Pw-2) stated that all material was handed over to police and
same was the stance of Muhammad Ilyas SI (Pw-3) and Muhammad
Asghar Constable (Pw-4).

28. No doubt that preparation of adulterated or misbranded
material is injurious to public health but for seeking conviction,
prosecution in all circumstances is under obligation to produce
evidence that must meet the standard of credibility and reliability. In

‘Abdul Majeed vs. The State 2011 SCMR 941’ it was held that: -

“The basic principle of criminal law is
that it is the burden of the prosecution to
prove its case against the accused beyond
reasonable doubt. This burden remains
throughout and does not shift to the
accused, who is only burdened to prove a
defence plea, if he takes one.”
Sharif.

Criminal Appeal No.44 of 2018/BWP. 8

29. Same view finds support from ‘Nasrullah alias Nasro_vs.
The State 2017 SCMR 724’.

30. The learned Trial Court completely ignored the infirmities
and inherent defects in prosecution’s case beside serious doubts
about manners of proceeding at crime scene. On the principles of
benefit of doubt the apex Court in ‘Muhammad Imran vs. The
State 2020 SCMR 857’ was pleased to hold that: -

“Tt is by now well settled that benefit of a
single circumstance, deducible from the
record, intriguing upon the integrity of
prosecution case, is to be extended to the
accused without reservation.”

31. Concluding the discussion made above this Criminal Appeal
is allowed. Impugned judgment dated 07.12.2017 is set_aside.
Appellants are acquitted from the charges. They are on bail. Their
sureties are discharged from the terms and condition of bail bonds.
Case property shall be dealt with, in the same manners as directed

by learned Trial Court.
