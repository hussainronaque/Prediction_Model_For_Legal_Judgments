JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- This criminal appeal

has been directed against the judgment/order dated 12.02.2020
passed by learned Judge, Special Court, Peshawar, whereby
accused-respondent Said Bahar, involved in a case FIR No.
121, dated 05.02.2018, under section 9 ( c ) CNSA was
acquitted of the charge.

2. As per prosecution story, Tariq Khan SI along with
other police contingent, on 05.02.2018, was present on
nakabandi laid at Karhano Check post when at 18.00 hours a
motorcar bearing registration No. LEA-10/4366, was stopped
for the purpose of checking. The driver of the motorcar
disclosed his name as Said Bahar while the front seater
disclosed his name as Rasool Khan. Search of the vehicle led
to the recovery of 12000 grams chars and 4000 grams heroin,
therefore, both the accused were arrested, resultantly, the

above referred case FIR was registered against them. After
completion of investigation, complete challan was forwarded
to the court where the accused Said Bahar faced the trial while
accused Rasool khan absented himself, therefore, proceedings
under section 512 Cr.P.C was initiated against him. After
commencement of the trial, the prosecution produced eight
witnesses. After closure of the prosecution evidence, accused
was examined under section 342 Cr.P.C wherein he stated that
he was, in fact, picked up by the local police from his house
and implicated him in the instant case as he was having
business dispute with different people. He in his defence also
produced Hamayun Khan as DW-1, Bahar Gul as DW-2 and
Hazbullah as DW-3. The learned trial Court after hearing the
parties acquitted accused Said Bahar from the charges while
accused Rasool khan was declared proclaimed offender vide

judgment dated 12.02.2020, hence, the instant appeal by the

State.
4, Arguments heard and record perused.
5. It is reflected from the record that the occurrence took

place at 18.00 hours on 05.02.2018 while the instant FIR was
registered on the same day at 19.10 hours. Muslim Taj, Head
constable, the marginal witness to the recovery memo,
Exh. PW 1/1, vide which the seizing officer recovered and
took into possession the alleged stuff, when appeared as PW-2
in the first line of his cross examination stated that they left the
Police Station at 08.40 P.M for the purpose of nakabandi and

remained on the nakabandi point for about two hours and
thereafter the subject vehicle arrived, meaning thereby the
subject vehicle was arrived at 10.40 p.m while the occurrence
as per contents of FIR was taken place at 1800 hours (06.00
p-m), while the Seizing Officer (PW-8) in his cross
examination totally belied the statement of the marginal
witness by stating that they had not left the Police Station for
Nakabandi rather the point of Nakabandi was a permanent
point and they were present on the place of nakabandi since
09.00 a.m. Besides the above disagreement in the statements of
Seizing officer and marginal witness of the recovery memo, it
cannot be ruled out that the entire process has been completed
by the police while sitting in the police station as obvious from
the statements of the prosecution witnesses because Imtiaz
Alam, the investigating officer, (PW-7) stated in his cross
examination that investigation of the case was entrusted to him
at 19.50 hours and he reached to the spot at 08.40 p.m while as
per statement of the Seizing Officer he was present at the spot
at the time of arrival of the I.O but his statement was not in
line with the statement of Moharrir of the police Station
namely, Muhammad Saeed (PW-6) who stated in his cross
examination that the parcels were handed over to him by Tariq
Khan at 08.00 p.m, meaning thereby the seizing officer at the
time of arrival of the I.O to the spot was not present there
rather he was in the Police Station. The perusal of evidence

produced by the prosecution leads one to the conclusion that
the occurrence has not been taken place in the mode and
manner as structured by the prosecution.

6. Moreover, Muhammad Saeed Moharrir as PW-6 stated
that Tariq Khan SI handed over to him the sealed parcels on
05.02.2018 who further handed over the same to Rifaz
constable on 06.02.2018 for onward transmission to the
Laboratory while Rifaz No. 5915 (PW-4) stated that the
samples were not handed over to him on 06.02.2018. Even
application for sending the samples to the laboratory has not

been drafted. Hon’able the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the

case of State through Regional Director ANF v. Imam
Bakhsh and others (2018 SCMR 2039) has observed that in

a case where safe custody of the recovered substance or safe
transmission of samples of the recovered substance is not
established by the prosecution there it cannot be held that the
prosecution had succeeded in establishing its case against the
accused.

7. Apart from the safe custody and safe transmission of
the samples, the FSL report does not bear the test protocols
that were applied to carry out these tests and in this respect in
the case titled Khair-ul-Bashar v. the State (2019 SCMR
930), it was held by the apex Court as under:--

"10. In the present case examination of the report of
the Government Analyst mentions the tests applied
but does not provide their results except a
concluding result, presumably of all the tests, which
is not sufficient. The Report also does not signify

the test protocols that were applied to carry out
these tests. Hence, the mandatory requirement of
law provided under Rule 6 has not been complied
with and, thus, it is not safe to rely on the Report of
the Government Analyst dated 18-02-2016. As a
conclusion, it is reiterated, that the Report of the
Government Analyst must mention (i) all the tests
and analysis of the alleged drug (ii) the result of the
each test(s) carried out along with the consolidated
result and (iii) the name of all the protocols applied
to carry out these tests.

Reliance is also placed on the case titled Qaiser Javed

Khan vs. The State through Prosecutor General Punjab,
Lahore and another, (PLD 2020 SC 57) wherein it has been

held by the Hon’able apex Court that:-

“8. The report of the Government Analyst in the
instant case does not specify the protocols of the
tests applied and thus does not meet the
requirements of the law as interpreted by this Court
in the cases of Amam Bakhsh and Khair ul Bashar
(supra). The said Report cannot be relied upon for
the conviction of the petitioner.”

8. The combined study of the evidence produced by the
prosecution would reveal that the prosecution has not been able
to prove its case against the respondent-accused beyond any
shadow of doubt against the accused-respondent, thus, he has
rightly been acquitted of the charge by the learned trial court
by extending him with the benefit of doubt.

9. Above all, there is no cavil with the proposition that the
scope of interference in appeal against acquittal is most narrow
and limited because in case of acquittal the presumption of
innocence is significantly added to the cardinal rule of

criminal jurisprudence that an accused shall be presumed to be
innocent unless proved guilty. Simple is that the presumption
of innocence is doubled and the courts shall be very slow in
interfering with such an acquittal judgment, unless it is shown
to be perverse, based in gross violation of law, suffering from
the errors of grave mis-reading or non-reading of the evidence.
9. Having thus considered the background of the case and
for the reasons discussed above, we do not feel inclined to
draw a conclusion different from what the learned trial court
has drawn and, hence, do not feel hesitant to uphold the
acquittal of the respondent-accused, resultantly, the same is
maintained and, accordingly, dismiss the appeal.
