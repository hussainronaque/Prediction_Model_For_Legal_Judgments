JUDGMENT
WIQAR AHMAD, J.- This order is directed to
dispose of this and the connected civil revision
bearing No. 387-A/2011 as both the petitions arise

out of same impugned order.

2. Petitioners of both the civil revisions
were plaintiffs in the suit for declaration to the
effect that property bearing Khasra No. 75 and 77
measuring 523 Kanals 19 Marlas situated within
the Revenue Estate of Banda Qazi, Abbottabad was

their exclusive ownership in the light of judgments
earlier passed by the Civil Court and maintained up
to august Supreme Court of Pakistan especially
when they had deposited compensation thereof in
the light of notification No. 25026/REV B/168 F
dated 20.12.1989 and thus defendants/respondents
had got no rights whatsoever, in the suit property.
Petitioners also challenged mutations No. 3976,
4037, 4046 and 4359 claiming that same were

ineffective upon their rights.

3. Defendants were summoned by the
civil court, who filed their written statement,
wherein they besides other legal and factual
objections, mainly asserted that the suit was hit by
principal of res-judicata. Learned trial Court
framed issues, recorded pro and contra evidence
and vide judgment and decree dated 08.12.2009,
dismissed the suit. Petitioners filed an appeal
against said judgment of learned civil Court, which
was also dismissed vide judgment dated 07.04.2011
of learned Additional District Judge-III,
Abbottabad. Feeling aggrieved  there-from,

petitioners have filed revision petitions before this
Court against concurrent findings of the two Courts

below.

4. I have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the petitioners in Civil Revision No.
326-A/2011 while learned counsel for the
petitioners in civil Revision No. 387-A/2011 did
not appear before the Court. Petitioners in said civil
revision again requested for adjournment but their
request was turned down as they had already
availed numerous opportunities but could not
produce their counsel for arguments. Arguments of
learned counsel for the respondents were also heard

and record perused.

5. Perusal of record reveals that plaint of
petitioners filed before the learned civil Court was
dismissed as being barred by principle of res-
judicata. In earlier suit filed by them bearing No.
221/1 of 1981, petitioner had prayed for grant of
decree in respect of 523 Kanals and 19 of land in
same Khasra numbers, claiming to be their
entitlement, arising out of their occupancy rights
earlier held over said area by their predecessors.

The learned civil Court after a full dress trial, had
found that they had not been entitled to ownership
of 523 Kanals 19 Marlas and their suit had been
decreed to the extent of 248 Kanals vide judgment
and decree dated 17.02.1988. Appeals were filed
against said judgment and decree which were
pending before the learned Additional District &
Sessions Judge, Abbottabad, when a development
took place outside the Court, on the basis of which
petitioners in the instant suit were claiming accrual
of fresh cause of action. Predecessor of the
petitioner had filed an application for allowing him
to deposit amount of compensation under Section 4
of the North-West Frontier Province Tenancy Act,
1950, in light of notification No. 25026/Rev IV/168
F dated 20.12.1989. The application was allowed
on 17.06.1990 which order was brought in evidence
of suit in hand as Ex PW-5/8. Petitioners claimed
that this factum of deposit of additional amount had
made them entitled to 523-Kanals 19 Marlas for
which they had claimed declaration for the second
time in the instant suit. It is admitted that basic
claim of petitioners was arising from their capacity

as occupancy tenants. On promulgation of NWFP
Tenancy Act, 1950, their predecessor had deposited
amount of compensation as required under Section
4 of the ibid Act. Vide judgment and decree dated
07.12.1953, they had been declared to have
acquired ownership of the land in respect of which
they were having possessory rights. Appeal had
also been filed there against and in the judgment in
appeal dated 06.03.1991 they had finally been held
to be owners in property in dispute to the extent of
248 Kanals and 7 Marlas. In the suit brought in the
year 1981, same claim has been upheld again on the
basis of earlier judgment and they had been
declared owners to the extent of 248 Kanals 7
Marlas which judgment had been upheld up to the
honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan, declaring
their entitlement to the extent of 248 Kanals 7
Marlas. In this respect a part of judgment of learned
Additional District Judge, Abbottabad dated
06.03.1991, in civil appeals No. 23/13, 24/13 and
25/13 of 1988, may be reproduced herewith being
relevant to the issue in hand;
“So far the contention advanced by

Gulzaman etc. regarding the grant of

decree to the extent of 248 Kanals 7 Mls is
concerned, has got some weight in it and
rightly so because the learned trial judge
as per judgment appealed against, on its
page 10 (discussion under issues 1, 6 and
8) has admitted their ownership to the
afore-said quantum but it appears that
while concluding his arguments he omitted
to grant even the admitted quantum of
their ownership by dismissing their claim
which has already been admitted and
decided in their favour and up-held in
judgment of appeal No. 60 dated
31.8.55(after the modification of the
shares) and appeal No. 33 decided on
211.57. Therefore, in view of his
discussion the learned trial judge was
supposed besides keeping intact the share
of heirs of Kala deceased (as per due
shares in the judgment delivered on case
file No. 229 decided on 7.12.53) he should
also have granted the decree in favour of
Gulzaman etc. to the extent of 248 kanals 7
Marlas.”

To same effect, judgment was delivered by this
Court on 20.04.1995 in Civil Revision No. 74 of
1991, and by the honourable Supreme Court of

Pakistan on 19.06.1996 in CP No. 543/95.

6. Learned counsel for the petitioners
contended that the suit in hand had been based

upon a cause of action which had accrued to
plaintiffs/ petitioners subsequently i.e. on
17.06.1990 for the reason that effect of subsequent
deposit of amount for getting additional rights of
ownership in land in which predecessor in interest
of petitioners had remained occupancy tenant, had
neither remained in issue nor same had been
decided by a competent court law. The subsequent
suit was, therefore claimed not hit by principle of

res-judicata.

7. Learned counsel for the respondents
submitted in rebuttal that it was during pendency of
the appeals in earlier suit filed by the petitioners,
that they had collusively deposited the amount of
compensation through an order, obtained from low
ranking revenue officer but even that deposit was
after the cut off date mentioned in “Qazalbash
Wagf & others Vs. Chief Land Commissioner,
Punjab, Lahore and others” reported as PLD 1990
SC 99 and therefore, suit of the plaintiff/petitioner

had rightly be held to be barred by law.

8. The learned civil Court while treating
the subsequent suit barred by law, has recorded the

following observations:-
“The previous suit Ex PW.5/2 was
between the same parties and upon the
same subject matter and _ the
controversy between the parties has
been decided upto the August Supreme
Court of Pakistan. The present suit
between the same parties and upon the
same subject matter is hit by the
principle of resjudicata. It is evident
from the record that the judgment of
Honourable Supreme Court of
Pakistan Ex PW.6/4 was passed on
19.6.1996 and the plaintiffs instead of
filing executing petition, instituted the
present suit on 192.1997 which is hit
by principle of resjudicata. In the
present suit the plaintiffs claim the
ownership of suit property on the basis
of judgment and decree and
notification No. 25026/RE B IV/168 F
Dated 20.12.1989 and order of
Collector dated 17.6.1990. The claim
of plaintiff on the basis of judgment
and decree has already been finalized.
As for as claim of plaintiffs on the
basis of notification and order of
collector is concerned, that claim was
available to the plaintiffs before
passing of judgment and decree of
learned Additional District Judge, Atd,
but, the plaintiffs neither agitated this
claim before the first appellate court
nor before the Honourable High Court

as well as August Supreme Court of
Pakistan till final decision dated:
19.6.1996. This claim of plaintiffs

,

operates as constructive resjudicata.’

The question before this Court in
instant proceedings is whether the factum of deposit
of additional compensation during pendency of
appeals in earlier suit, was clothing the petitioners
with a fresh cause of action and whether their
subsequent suit was not barred by principle of res-
judicata? In this respect it is important that in suit
filed in the year 1953 as well as in suit filed in the
year 1981, plaintiffs/petitioners or their predecessor
had claimed their entitlement to the extent of 523-
Kanals 19 Marlas. Core question in those suits were
determination of rights of plaintiffs in respect of their
entitlement to 523 Kanals 19 Marlas of the disputed
land. Establishment of right of ownership in both the
suits were subject to determination of certain
questions which included;

a. whether the respective plaintiffs in the case or their
predecessors have been occupancy tenants in the
property;

b. what was the extent and measurement of land in respect
of which they were found having rights as occupancy

tenants;
10

c. whether they had fulfilled the conditions of Section 04
of Tenancy Act, 1950 in the shape of deposit of

compensation?
9. The Courts while seized with claims of
petitioners and determination of these basic
questions, had finally held (in appeal), that they had
acquired ownership to the extent of 248 Kanals 7
Marlas and their claim to the extent of area beyond
said measurement had been turned down, in the
suits instituted by them in the year 1953. Same was
the case in the suit filed in the year 1981 when they
had brought another suit and same had been
decreed to said effect vide judgment dated
17.02.1988 of civil Court which order had been
maintained till august Supreme Court of Pakistan.
The core question for determination in instant suit
filed on 19.02.1997 was also same which is
apparent from the very heading of their plaint. As
stated earlier, their question of entitlement was not
only dependent on deposit of amount of
compensation under Section 4 of the Tenancy Act,
1950 but before that they were under obligations to
have established that they had been occupying the

land as occupancy tenants. All the three questions
11

had been determined by courts in two rounds of
litigations where-after, petitioners had been found
entitled to 248 Kanals and 7 Marlas land and their
claim to the extent of 523 Kanals and 19 Marlas

had not been allowed as prayed for.

10. Notification No. 25026/RE B IV/168 F
dated 20.12.1989 had in-fact been issued for giving
rights to those genuine occupancy tenants who had
been in possession of land and entitled for
acquiring ownership in light of Section 4 of the
Tenancy Act, 1950, but had not been able to
deposit the compensation in time. Said notification
was not at all applicable to the case of petitioners as
they had deposited the amount of compensation
earlier and had obtained ownership of the land
under their predecessor. This notification or factum
of deposit of amount in a surreptitious manner, on
the order of a revenue officer, was not sufficient to
give petitioners a fresh cause of action. The order
was obtained and amount of compensation was
deposited in a surreptitious manner for the reasons
that at that time their appeals were pending before

the Courts at Abbottabad where respondents had
12

been fully contesting the case with them for the last
almost a decade, but they had not made them party
to their application nor had the revenue officer
conducted any inquiry or had send notices to the
aggrieved persons. The Revenue officer had not
even tried to search record of his own office to
know whether or not the applicants before him had
been those persons who had not deposited the
amount of compensation as required under Section
4 of the Tenancy Act and whether or not they were
entitled to benefits under notification dated
20.12.1989. The Revenue Officer had not tried to
make himself aware of earlier litigation and its
culmination. He had also not bothered to know
whether or not any litigation was pending at the

relevant time.

11. At the time when the predecessor of
petitioners/plaintiffs was depositing the
compensation for acquiring the purported benefit of
notification dated 20.12.1989, their appeal was
pending before the District Courts. It is well
established principle that appeal is continuation of

the original suit. We can therefore, say with
13

reference to context of the case that their suit was
pending before the Court. If they had acquired any
additional interest or right in the property which
was in dispute before the Court, they could have
brought this fact on record by amending the suit or
could have withdrawn the suit with permission to
file fresh one. They had not chosen said course and
had rather kept the order and receipt of deposit of
compensation under the rug, continuing litigation
for same rights before the Courts. In same
litigation, not only District Courts but this Court as
well as august Supreme Court of Pakistan had
delivered its judgment finally determining that
petitioners were entitled to 248 Kanals and 7

Marlas of land.

12. Now the question is, whether the
plaintiffs were having the opportunity of raising
this new ground as additional ground of their
attack? The answer is that they had got full
opportunity of bringing this fact before the Court
and making it a ground of their attack. When they
had failed in doing so, the learned civil Court has

rightly held their subsequent suit barred by
14

principle of constructive res-judicata as per
Explanation 4 of Section 11 of the CPC read with

Order 2 Rule 2 CPC.

13. In the case of “State Bank of Pakistan
through Governor and another Vs Imtiaz Ali
Khan and others” reported as 2012 SCMR 280,
honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan has held
that if a party had not chosen to ask for a relief
which was available to it, same cannot be sought in
subsequent proceedings. Relevant findings of the

apex Court are reproduced as under:-

“Tt is well settled law that party once
approaching the Court for seeking
relief shall seek all the relief to which it
thinks is entitled to and if such relief,
even if available but not asked for,
cannot be claimed by filing a
subsequent legal proceedings as it
would fall within the mischief of
constructive res judicata. On_ this
ground as well the respondents were
not entitled to any relief as it has been
handed down to them through the

impugned judgment.”
Similarly, in the case of “Jubilee General

Insurance Co. Ltd. Karachi ys. Ravi Steel
15

Company, Lahore” reported as PLD 2020 SC 324

hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, has also held:-

“Indeed, in adversarial proceedings a
litigant has to cross the barrier of
limitation, before his rights are
adjudicated. Like Order II, Rule (2)
C.P.C. mandates the Plaintiff to include
the whole claim and seek all reliefs in a
suit to which he is entitled, where a
plaintiff omits to sue in respect of the
portion so omitted to claim any relief to
which he may be entitled, he cannot,
except by leave of the Court, afterwards
sue for any relief so omitted. Cumulative
effect of Order VI, Rule 4 C.P.C. read
with Order VIII, Rule 2 and _ other
enabling provisions, by same stroke
requires that the "defendant must raise"
in written statement and specifically and
particularly plead "all matters, which
show that the suit not to be maintainable
or that the transaction is either void or
voidable in point in law, and all such
grounds of defence as, if not raised,
would be likely to take opposite party by
surprise or would raise issues of facts
not arising out of the plaint as for
instance fraud, limitation, _ release,
payment, performance or facts showing
illegality. "(Order VII, Rule 2 C.P.C.)
plea of misrepresentation, fraud, breach

of trust, willful default or undue
16

influence, and in all other cases in which
particulars may be necessary" (Order VI,
R 4 ibid). These rules of prudence
require both the plaintiff and defendant
to plead all facts that may constitute
cause of action for any relief and for the
defendant which may constitute a defence
to specifically refute any claim on merits
as well raising specific defense
denouncing claim on the assertions of
fraud, limitation, release, payment,
performance or facts showing illegality.
Unless such particulars are specifically
pleaded in the plaint or in written
statement as a defence other party may it
be plaintiff or defendant would have no
opportunity to controvert the same, as
neither the issue could be framed nor,
evidence could ordinarily be allowed to
be raised or led at trial or attended in
further appeals or revisions as the case
may be. Failure to raise such plea at the
first opportunity (either in plaint or
written statement as the case may be) to
assert any right or claim any relief where
such rights and relief is founded on such
assertion or raising such plea as a
defence to contest and or controvert any
such claim may well amount and be
successfully be defeated on doctrine of
constructive res judicata, in subsequent

proceedings”.
17

14. Even where section 11 of the CPC is
not applicable stricto-senso, general principles of
doctrine of resjudicata may be pressed in service so
as to get rid of a suit whereby a party try to re-
agitate and reopen an already decided matter.
Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case
of “Muhammad Akhtar Vs. Abdul Hadi” reported
as 1981 SCMR 878, had applied the principle of
resjudicata to case of a tenant who had started
second round of litigation by filing a suit when in
first round of litigation, he had been adjudged as a
tenant while second party to the litigation as a
transferee and owner of the property in dispute in
said case. Further reliance in this respect may also
be placed on the judgment of honourable Lahore
High Court, in the case of “Shahzad Hussain Vs.

Hajira Bibi” reported as PLD 1990 Lahore 222.

15. Another aspect of the case was the
development of obtaining an order from EAC and
deposit of amount of compensation in compliance
thereof, had taken place in respect of the property
which was in dispute before District Court right at

the time. Such a development would also be
18

covered by principle of /is-pendens. The principle
of lis-pendens is based upon the principle of equity,
saying “ut lite pendent nihil innoveture”. The
maxim can be translated to the effect that nothing
new should be introduced during pendency of a
litigation. We also find said principle embodied in
Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1982

which read as;-

"During the pendency in any Court
having authority in Pakistan or
established beyond the limits of Pakistan
by the Central Government of any suit or
proceeding which is not collusive and in
which any right to immovable property is
directly and specifically in question, the
property cannot be transferred or
otherwise dealt with by any party to the
suit or proceeding so as to affect the
rights of any other party thereto under
any decree or order which may be made
therein, except under the authority of the
Court and on such terms as it may

impose.

Explanation:---For the purpose
of this section, the pendency of a suit or
proceeding shall be deemed _ to
commence from the date of the
presentation of the  plaint or the

institution of the proceeding in a Court of
19

competent jurisdiction, and to continue
until the suit or proceeding has been
disposed of by a final decree or order and
complete satisfaction or discharge of such
decree or order has been obtained, or has
become unobtainable by reason of the
expiration of any period of limitation
prescribed for the execution thereof by

any law for the time being in force."

16. Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, while
giving its judgment in the case of “Muhammad Ashraf
Butt Vs. Muhammad Asif Bhatti” (PLD 2011 SC 905),
has quoted a para from the judgment delivered in the case
of “Tilton V. Cofield, (93 U.S. 168, 23 L.Ed, 858)” and
held that rule of /is-pendens unambiguously prescribed that
rights of a party to suit, who ultimately succeeded in the
matter, were not to be affected in any manner whatsoever,
on ground of alienation and that the transferee of the
property would acquire titled to the property subject to
final outcome of the lis. Observations given in the case of
Tilton vs. Cofield, may also be reproduced hereunder with

benefit:-

"The doctrine of lis pendens is that
real property, when it has been put in
litigation by a suit in equity, in which it
is specifically described, will, if the
suit is prosecuted with vigilance, be

bound by the _ final decree,
20

notwithstanding any _ intermediate
alienation; and one who intermeddles
with property in litigation does so at
his peril and is as conclusively bound
by the results of the litigation,
whatever they may be, as if he had

been a party from the outset".
17. Similarly, hon’ble Supreme Court of
Pakistan, while giving its judgment in the case of
“Mst. Tabassum Shaheen Vs. Mst. Uzma Rahat
and others” reported as 20/2 SCMR 983, has also
held;-

“The afore-referred provision enshrines
the age old and well established principle
of equity that ut lite pendente nihil
innovetur (pending litigation nothing new
should be introduced) and stipulates that
pendente lite parties to litigation wherein
right to immovable property is in
question, no party can alienate or
otherwise deal with such property to the
detriment of his opponent. Any transfer so
made would be hit by this Section. The
doctrine by now is recognized both in law
and equity and underpins the rationale
that no action or suit would succeed if
alienations made during pendency of
proceedings in the said suit or action
were allowed to prevail. The effect of

such alienation would be that the plaintiff
21

would be defeated by defendants
alienating the suit property before the
judgment or decree and the former would
be obliged to initiate de novo proceedings
and that too with lurking fear that he
could again be defeated by the same trick.
The doctrine of lis pendens in pith and
substance is not only based on equity but

also at good conscience and justice.”

18. It is also necessary to be explained here
that operation of doctrine of pendent lite cannot be
held limited to a transaction of sale and purchase
only. Applicability of the general principle pendent
lite would also include other developments that take
place in respect of same property which is subject
matter of a dispute before the Court of law provided
such a development would have a substantial
bearing on decision of the case, had the matter been
brought to the notice of Court. The express wording
to Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1982,
wherein it is stated “the property could not be
transferred or otherwise dealt by any part to the suit
or proceedings so as to affect the rights of any party
thereto under any decree or order which may be
made therein” are significant in this respect,

particularly, the wordings “or otherwise dealt with”.
22

19. In the instant case, the order whereby
petitioner had been claiming ownership could not be
termed to be a transaction of sale but through said
order, the property which had been subject matter of
litigation directly, was tried to be dealt with
otherwise and same was not only without authority
of the Court, but had also been kept concealed
therefrom. The order so procured from the Revenue
Officer, as well as the compensation deposited in
accordance with said order, would therefore, also be
covered by wording “otherwise dealt with”. Same
would be squarely hit by doctrine of lis-pendens.

20. In the light of what has been discussed
above, this and the connected petition were found
divested of merits, which stand dismissed.
