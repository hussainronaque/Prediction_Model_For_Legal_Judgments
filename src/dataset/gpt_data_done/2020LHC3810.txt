Crl. Revision No.723

of 2013 by

Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan, J:- This judgment shall
dispose of Criminal Appeal No.1238 of 2013, filed by Raiyet Ali
(appellant) against his conviction and sentence, as well as Criminal
Revision No.723 of 2013, filed by Muhammad Yahya
petitioner/complainant for enhancement of sentence awarded to the
Raiyet Ali (respondent No.2), from imprisonment for life to death, as
both these matters have arisen out of the same judgment dated
27.06.2013, passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Chunian,
District Kasur.

2. Raiyet Ali (appellant) was tried in case F.I.R. No.381/2010
dated 17.09.2010, registered at police station Kangan Pur in respect of
Criminal Appeal No.1238 of 2013 &
Criminal Revision No.723 of 2013.

offence under section 302 PPC. After conclusion of the trial, the
learned trial Court vide its judgment dated 27.06.2013, has convicted

and sentenced the appellant as under: -

Under section 302(b) PPC to imprisonment for life. The
appellant was also directed to deposit an amount of
Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees two Lhundred thousand only), as
compensation in the bank account of the daughter of Mst.
Khursheed Bibi (deceased) and in case of default to
further undergo six months simple imprisonment.

Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C was also extended to the
appellant.

3. Brief facts of the case as given by the complainant Muhammad
Yahya (PW-1) are that the sister of the complainant namely Mst.
Khursheed Bibi (deceased) was married with Raiyet Ali (appellant) for
the last fourteen years and from the said wedlock, a daughter was born,
where-after the deceased remained issue-less, due to which Raiyet Ali
(appellant), was annoyed and he used to beat Mst. Khursheed Bibi
(deceased). The complainant party several times asked the appellant to
contract second marriage due to his desire of having more kids. Mst.
Khursheed Bibi (deceased), didn’t leave the house of the appellant for
the sake of her daughter. Raiyet Ali (appellant), was having illicit
relations with other women but even then Mst. Khursheed Bibi
(deceased), continued to live with the appellant just for the betterment
of her daughter. On the preceding night of registration of FIR i.e.,
17.09.2010, Raiyet Ali (appellant), committed the murder of Mst.
Khurhseed Bibi (deceased), either through strangulating her neck or
through some other way but he (appellant) told everyone that Mst.
Khursheed Bibi (deceased), died due to the electric shock. After
committing murder of Mst. Khursheed Bibi (deceased), Raiyat Ali
(appellant) informed his (appellant’s) brother and then his (appellant’s)

sister-in-law about the death of his wife due to the electric shock,
Criminal Appeal No.1238 of 2013 &
Criminal Revision No.723 of 2013.

however, he (appellant) did not tell this fact to the complainant party,
though the house of the complainant party was situated near to the
house of the accused (appellant). On coming to know about the
occurrence at 3.30 a.m, the complainant along with Hafiz Muhammad
Tariq (PW-2), Mst. Surraya Bibi daughter of Muhammad Younis,
Asghar and Mst. Surayya Bibi wife of Muhammad Yahya (PWs since
given-up), reached at the house of the deceased, where Mst. Khursheed
Bibi (deceased) was lying dead in naked condition in the bathroom.
The complainant party covered the dead body with a cloth and shifted
the same on a cot and while doing so, they noticed ligature mark

around the neck of the deceased, hence the abovementioned FIR.

On 22.09.2010, the complainant implicated Muhammad Aslam
(co-accused), while moving application (Ex.PB), with the allegation
that he (complainant), lodged the abovementioned case as his brother-
in-law Raiyat Ali (appellant), committed murder of her sister namely
Mst. Khursheed Bibi (deceased) through strangulating her neck but
before committing murder, he (appellant) took intoxicated tablets from
a fake doctor namely Muhammad Aslam (co-accused since acquitted)
and administered the same to Mst. Khursheed Bibi (deceased) and her
daughter Nadia Bibi, so that they could not offer any resistance. It was
further alleged by the complainant in his application (Ex.PB), that
Muhammad Aslam (co-accused since acquitted), is also involved in
commission of offence of murder of his sister as strip of intoxicated
tablets was found present in the dustbin, however, the learned trial
Court acquitted the said Muhammad Aslam (co-accused since
acquitted) while giving him the benefit of doubt vide the impugned
judgment dated 12.10.2012.

4. The appellant was arrested in this case by the police and after

completion of investigation the challan was prepared and submitted
Criminal Appeal No.1238 of 2013 &
Criminal Revision No.723 of 2013.

before the learned trial court. The learned trial Court, after observing
legal formalities, as provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1898 framed charge against the appellant to which he pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial. In order to prove its case the prosecution
produced eight witnesses during the trial. The statement of the
appellant under section 342, Cr.P.C was recorded, wherein he refuted

the allegations levelled against him and professed his innocence.

5. The learned trial Court vide its judgment dated 27.06.2013,
found the appellant guilty, convicted and sentenced him as mentioned

and detailed above.

6. It is contended by learned counsel for the appellant that there
was no eye-witness of the occurrence and the prosecution case is based
upon mere suspicions; that even there is no circumstantial evidence on
the record against the appellant and the prosecution witnesses namely
Muhammad Yahya complainant (PW-1) and Hafiz Tariq (PW-2),
merely expressed their suspicion against the appellant; that it was the
case of the prosecution that the appellant informed the complainant
party through a mobile phone while giving a false information
regarding the death of Mst. Khursheed Bibi, due to an electric shock
but neither the mobile phone of the complainant party nor the mobile
phone of the appellant has been taken into possession by the
investigating Officer; that even no data of the mobile phone numbers
mentioned by Hafiz Tariq (PW-2), has been taken into possession by
the Investigating Officer; that time of death of the deceased as given by
Lady Dr. Tasneem Naqvi (PW-5), does not coincide with the time of
death of the deceased, as given by the prosecution witnesses; that
according to the prosecution case, Raiyet Ali (appellant), made a
disclosure that he had first given some material to Mst. Khurshid Bibi

(deceased), which caused intoxication to her and thereafter the
Criminal Appeal No.1238 of 2013 &
Criminal Revision No.723 of 2013.

appellant committed her murder by strangulating her neck but visceras
of the deceased were not sent to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency
for detection of any material therein, which can cause intoxication; that
even otherwise the abovementioned prosecution evidence is based on
the alleged extra judicial confession of the appellant, while in police
custody, which is in-admissible in evidence; that the alleged recovery
of Dupatta (P-1), has been planted against the appellant in order to
strengthen the weak prosecution case; that according to Imran Shahid
1144/C (PW-6), Dupatta (P-1), was of common pattern, which was not
stained with any incriminating material, therefore, the alleged recovery
of Dupatta (P-1), from the possession of the appellant is of no avail to
the prosecution; that the motive as alleged by the prosecution against
the appellant has also not been proved in this case; that the prosecution
has miserably failed to prove its case against the appellant beyond the
shadow of doubt, therefore, this appeal may be accepted and the
appellant may be acquitted from the charge.

7. Learned Deputy Prosecutor General assisted by learned counsel
for the complainant, opposed this appeal on the grounds that the
prosecution has fully proved its case against the appellant beyond the
shadow of any doubt; that the prosecution witnesses namely
Muhammad Yahya complainant (PW-1) and Hafiz Tariq (PW-2),
being brother and maternal nephew of Mst. Khursheed Bibi (deceased)
had no previous enmity with the appellant to falsely implicated him in
this case; that substitution in such like cases is a rare phenomena; that
the dead body of Mst. Khursheed Bibi (deceased), was recovered from
the house of the appellant, therefore, it was duty of the appellant to
explain regarding the cause of death of the deceased but the appellant
neither lodged any FIR nor informed the police regarding the cause of
un-natural death of the deceased rather he fled away from the spot after

the occurrence and as such the conduct of the appellant has proved that
Criminal Appeal No.1238 of 2013 &
Criminal Revision No.723 of 2013.

he was guilty in this case; that the prosecution witnesses stood the test
of lengthy cross examination but their evidence could not be shaken;
that the prosecution case against the appellant is further supported by
the medical evidence, which shows the un-natural death of the
deceased by strangulating her neck and fracture of hyoid bone of the
deceased; that the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Yahya
complainant (PW-1) and Hafiz Muhammad Tariq (PW-2), are natural
witnesses in this case because they are residents of close-by houses,
which were situated near to the place of occurrence; that the
prosecution case against the appellant is further corroborated by the
recovery of weapon of offence i.e., Dupatta (P-1), on the pointation of
the appellant; that the motive as alleged by the prosecution has also
been proved through straightforward and confidence inspiring
evidence of the prosecution witnesses; that the prosecution has proved
its case against the appellant beyond the shadow of any doubt; that
there is no substance in this appeal, therefore, the same may be
dismissed. It is added by learned counsel for the complainant that there
was no mitigating circumstance in this case, therefore, while accepting
the Criminal Revision No.723 of 2013, filed by the complainant the
sentence awarded to the appellant by the learned trial Court may be

enhanced from imprisonment for life to death.

8. I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the
parties, as well as, the learned Additional Prosecutor General and
have also gone through the evidence available on the record with

their able assistance.

9. Since there is no direct evidence and prosecution case hinges on
the circumstantial evidence, therefore, utmost care and caution is
required for reaching at a just decision of the case. It is settled by now

that in such like cases every circumstance should be linked with each
Criminal Appeal No.1238 of 2013 &
Criminal Revision No.723 of 2013.

other and it should form such a continuous chain that its one end
touches the dead body and other to the neck of the accused. But if any
link in the chain is missing then its benefit must go to the accused. In
this regard, guidance has been sought from the judgments of the Apex
Court of the country reported as “Ch. Barkat Ali Vs. Major Karam
Elahi Zia and another” (1992 SCMR 1047), “Sarfraz Khan Vs. The
State” (1996 SCMR 188) and “Asadullah and another Vs. The State”
(PLJ 1999 SC 1018). In the case of “Ch. Barkat_Ali (supra), the

august Supreme Court of Pakistan, at page 1055, observed as under:-

“\.Law relating to circumstantial evidence that
proved circumstances must be incompatible with any
reasonable hypothesis of the innocence of the accused.
See ‘Siraj vs. The Crown’ (PLD 1956 FC 123). Ina
case of circumstantial evidence, the rule is that no link
in the chain should be broken and that the
circumstances should be such as cannot be explained
away on any hypothesis other than the guilt of the
accused.”

In the case of “Sarfraz Khan (supra), the august Supreme Court
of Pakistan, at page 192, held as under:-

“7...ct is well settled that circumstantial evidence
should be so inter-connected that it forms such a
continuous chain that its one end touches the dead
body and other neck of the accused thereby excluding
all the hypothesis of his innocence.”

Further reliance in this context is placed on the case of “Altaf
Hussain Vs. Fakhar Hussain and another” (2008 SCMR 1103)
wherein, at page 1105 it was held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court as

under:-

“7....Needless to emphasis that all the pieces of
evidence should be so linked that it should give the
picture of a complete chain, one corner of which
should touch the neck of the deceased and other corner
to the neck of the accused. Failure of one link will
destroy the entire chain.”
Criminal Appeal No.1238 of 2013 &
Criminal Revision No.723 of 2013.

Keeping in view the parameters, laid down in the above-
mentioned judgments, I will discuss each part of the prosecution

evidence, separately.

10. The prosecution case is based on the following pieces of
evidence:-

(i) | Circumstantial evidence produced by the prosecution
through Muhammad Yahya complainant (PW-1) and
Hafiz Muhammad Tariq (PW-2), on account of a false
information allegedly given by Raiyet Ali (appellant) to
the complainant party regarding the death of Mst.
Khursheed Bibi (deceased), due to electric-shock and
disappearance of Raiyet Ali (appellant) after the
occurrence.

(ii) Motive

(iii) Recovery of weapon of offence i.e., Dupatta (P-1), on
the pointation of Raiyet Ali (appellant), as well as,
recovery of dead body of Mst. Khursheed Bibi
(deceased), from the house of Raiyet Ali (appellant).

(iv) Medical Evidence.

(v) Evidence of extrajudicial confession of Raiyet Ali
(appellant) before Muhammad Yahya complainant
(PW-1), while in police custody.

11. @ Circumstantial evidence produced by the_prosecution

through Muhammad Yahya complainant (PW-1) and Hafiz
Muhammad _ Tariq (PW-2), on account _of _a_ false

information allegedly given by Raiyet Ali (appellant) to the
complainant party regarding the death of Mst. Khursheed

Bibi (deceased), due to electric-shock and disappearance of
Raiyet Ali (appellant) after the occurrence.

Insofar as the evidence of prosecution witnesses namely
Muhammad Yahya complainant (PW-1) and Hafiz Muhammad Tariq
(PW-2), is concerned, it is an admitted fact that both the
abovementioned witnesses are not the eye-witnesses of this case. They

are also not the witnesses of last seen evidence and their evidence is
Criminal Appeal No.1238 of 2013 &
Criminal Revision No.723 of 2013.

mainly based upon the suspicion against the appellant, which was
developed in the minds of above-referred prosecution witnesses due to
alleged false information given by Raiyet Ali (appellant) to the
complainant party regarding the cause of death of his wife namely Mst.
Khursheed Bibi (deceased), because of electric-shock and conduct of
the appellant subsequent to the occurrence as he (appellant) statedly
fled away from the spot after the occurrence and did not report the
matter to the police. It is noteworthy that Hafiz Muhammad Tariq
(PW-2), during his examination-in-chief stated regarding the
information given to him by Raiyet Ali (appellant) regarding the death
of Mst. Khursheed Bibi (deceased), due to electric-shock in the

following words:-

“At about 3.30 AM (night) accused Rayyat Ali telephonically
informed me about death of Khurshed Bibi by electric shock”

Furthermore, Hafiz Muhammad Tariq (PW-2), mentioned the cell
phone number of Raiyet Ali (appellant), as well as, his own cell phone
number during his cross examination, while appearing in the witness-
box. Relevant part of his statement in his cross examination reads as
under:-

“The cell phone number of Rayyat Ali at the relevant time
was 0300-6545733. My cell No. is 0302-6106180. I do not
remember as to whether I have given my cell No. as 0306-
4311127 to the police for the purpose of any contact with
me. My cell No.’s SIM is on my name. I got recorded the fact
of telephone call by Rayyat Ali accused on my cell phone,
giving information about the death of deceased. Confronted
with Ex.DA, where it is not so recorded. I got recorded in my
statements u/s 161 Cr.P.C that when I received the
information, we while going to the house of Rayyat Ali made
hue and cry and on hearing Muhammad Yahya complainant
andMst. Surrya Bibi (Mamani) came out and joined us.
Confronted with Ex.DA, where it is not so recorded”

It is, therefore, evident that Hafiz Muhammad Tariq (PW-2), has

given his own cell phone number, as well as, the cell phone number of
Criminal Appeal No.1238 of 2013 & 10
Criminal Revision No.723 of 2013. —

Raiyet Ali (appellant), during his cross examination but neither the
said cell phone sets were taken into possession by the Investigating
Officer nor their Data was collected by him, in order to establish that
any wrong information was given by Raiyet Ali (appellant), regarding
the death of Mst. Khursheed Bibi (deceased) to the complainant party.
It is further noteworthy that the above-mentioned fact regarding giving
information by Raiyet Ali (appellant) with regard to the cause of death
of Mst. Khursheed Bibi (deceased), due to electric-shock through
phone was not mentioned in the FIR or in the statement (Ex.DA) of
Hafiz Muhammad Tariq (PW-2), recorded by the police under section
161 Cr.P.C. Hafiz Muhammad Tariq was confronted with his previous
statement and the dishonest improvements made by him in this respect
were duly brought on the record. It is true that the dead body of Mst.
Khursheed Bibi (deceased) was recovered from the house of the
appellant and as per prosecution case, Raiyet Ali (appellant), did not
inform the police regarding the death of his wife namely Mst.
Khursheed Bibi (deceased) and he statedly fled away after the
occurrence but the abovementioned facts are not sufficient to convict
and sentence the appellant under the capital charge. The
abovementioned circumstances at the most may create a suspicion
against the appellant but it is by now well settled that suspicion how so
ever strong cannot take place of conclusive proof, which is required for
convicting and awarding sentence to an accused for a capital charge. In
the case of “Muhammad Jamshaid and another Vs. The State and
others” (2016 SCMR 1019), in paragraph No.3, of the judgment, the
Apex Court of the country was pleased to observe as under:-
3........d0t is trite that suspicion howsoever grave or

strong ¢ can never be a proper substitute for proof beyond
treasonable doubt required in a criminal case..
Criminal Appeal No.1238 of 2013 & 11
Criminal Revision No.723 of 2013. —

Similar view was taken by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in
the case reported as “Vijant Kumar and 4 others Vs. State through

Chief Ehtesab Commissioner, Islamabad _and_ others” (PLD 2003
Supreme Court 56).

12. ii) Motive.

According to the prosecution case as set forth in the FIR
(Ex.PA/1), the motive behind the occurrence was that only a female
child was born from the wedlock of Raiyet Ali (appellant) and Mst.
Khursheed Bibi (deceased), during the subsistence of their marriage for
fourteen (14) years due to which the appellant was unhappy with his
wife Mst. Khursheed Bibi (deceased). It was also alleged in the FIR
(Ex.PA/1) that Raiyet Ali (appellant) had illicit relations with the other
ladies and due to the abovementioned reason, he committed murder of
Mst. Khursheed Bibi (deceased). It is noteworthy that the prosecution
witnesses namely Muhammad Yahya complainant (PW-1) and Hafiz
Muhammad Tariq (PW-2), did not mention the above-referred motive
while appearing in the witness box and Hafiz Muhammad Tariq (PW-
2), only stated in his examination-in-chief that the attitude of Raiyet
Ali (appellant), was not cordial towards Mst. Khursheed Bibi
(deceased). He had not given any reason whatsoever for the
abovementioned attitude of the appellant with the deceased.
Muhammad Yahya complainant (PW-1), has conceded during his cross
examination that he had not mentioned the name of any woman with
whom Raiyet Ali (appellant) had illicit relationship. Relevant part of

his statement in this respect reads as under:-

“I did not mention the name of any woman, with whom
Rayyat Ali has alleged illicit relations during his marriage
time with my sister. It is incorrect that this fact is
unfounded and I do not have any cogent reference in this
regard”
Criminal Appeal No.1238 of 2013 & 12
Criminal Revision No.723 of 2013. —

He further admitted that he never convened any Punchait to
resolve the alleged issue of beating of Raiyet Ali (appellant) to Mst.
Khursheed Bibi (deceased) or to resolve the issue of illicit relations of
the appellant with any woman. Relevant part of his statement in this

respect reads as under:-

“No panchayiat was ever convened to resolve the issue of
beatings, given by the accused to my deceased sister as
well as his illicit relations with the different women of easy
excess”

Similarly Hafiz Muhammad Tariq (PW-2), conceded during his
cross examination that Raiyet Ali (appellant), never gave beating to his
aunt Mst. Khursheed Bibi (deceased), in his presence. Relevant part of
his statement in this respect reads as under:-

“Rayyat Ali never gave beatings to my aunt in my presence.
Volunteer, that she disclosed so to me”

Perusal of the statement of Hafiz Muhammad Tariq (PW-2),
shows that his statement was based upon hearsay evidence as he
himself never witnessed Raiyet Ali (appellant), while beating to his
wife Mst. Khursheed Bibi (deceased) and he stated that he was told by
Mst. Khursheed Bibi (deceased), regarding the abovementioned
motive. No woman was named by the abovementioned prosecution
witnesses with whom Raiyet Ali (appellant) had alleged illicit
relationship. It is also an admitted fact that Mst. Khursheed Bibi
(deceased) was living along with her minor daughter in the house of
Raiyet Ali (appellant), till her death. It is further noteworthy that no
family or civil suit filed by Mst. Khursheed Bibi (deceased), against
Raiyet Ali (appellant), was produced in the evidence to establish that
there was any matrimonial dispute between the parties. Both the
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Yahya complainant (PW-1)

and Hafiz Muhammad Tariq (PW-2), never stated that Mst.Khursheed
Criminal Appeal No.1238 of 2013 & 13
Criminal Revision No.723 of 2013. —

Bibi (deceased), came to the house of her parents due to any dispute
with the appellant. Keeping in view all the abovementioned facts, I
have come to this irresistible conclusion that the motive as alleged by

the prosecution has not been proved in this case.

13. (iii) Recovery of weapon of offence i.e., Dupatta (P-1),

on _the pointation of Raiyet Ali (appellant), as well as,
recove of dead body of Mst. Khursheed Bibi

(deceased), from the house of Raiyet Ali (appellant).

According to the prosecution case, Dupatta (P-1), was used by
the appellant for strangulating the neck of Mst. Khursheed Bibi
(deceased). According to the evidence of Lady Doctor Tasneem Naqvi
(PW-5), there was a bruise on the neck of Mst. Khursheed Bibi
(deceased). It is also noteworthy that as per prosecution case, the dead
body of Mst. Khursheed Bibi (deceased) was initially lying in the
bathroom of the house of appellant in naked condition, however, the
same was covered with a cloth by the ladies of the complainant party
and was put on a cot. In order to prove the recovery of Dupatta (P-1),
on the pointation of Raiyet Ali (appellant), the prosecution has
produced Imran Shahid 1144/C (PW-6), in the witness box. The said
witness has stated during his cross examination regarding the

abovementioned recovery as under:-

“I cannot describe the place, where “Petti” was lying as
well as room from where Dopatta P-1 was recovered,
however, Dopatta was of common pattern which was
easily available from the market. It is correct that P-1
Dopatta was not stained with mud, blood or soap”

It is evident from the statement made by Imran Shahid 1144/C
(PW-6), that he was even unable to describe the place, from where the
recovery of Dupatta (P-1), was effected. He was also unable to
describe the room where-from the said Dupatta (P-1), was recovered,

which shows that he never visited the place of recovery, therefore, he
Criminal Appeal No.1238 of 2013 & 14
Criminal Revision No.723 of 2013. —_—

was unable to describe the same. He has also admitted that Dupatta
(P-1), was of common pattern, which was easily available in the
market. He further conceded that Dupatta (P-1), was neither stained
with mud, blood or soap and as such no incriminating material was
available on Dupatta (P-1). Keeping in view all the abovementioned
facts and as Dupatta (P-1), was not stained with any incriminating
material and as Dupatta (P-1), was of common pattern, which is
available in almost every house, therefore, the said recovery is
inconsequential for the prosecution. Insofar as the recovery of dead
body of Mst. Khursheed Bibi (decease), from the house of Raiyet Ali
(appellant), is concerned, I have already given my findings in this
respect in paragraph No.11, of this judgment. The appellant cannot be
convicted and sentenced merely on the ground that he happened to be
the husband of the deceased. At the cost of repetition, it is observed
that by now it is well settled that in absence of other reliable and
cogent evidence, mere recovery of dead body of the deceased from the
house of an accused by itself is not sufficient to convict and sentence
him under the capital charge. In the case of “Nasrullah alias Nasro
Vs. The State” (2017 SCMR 724), in paragraph No.5, of the

judgment, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as under:-

J... ee1-..the accused person could not be convicted merely

on the basis of a presumption that since the murder of his

wife had taken place in his house, therefore, it must be he

and no one else who would have committed that

murder... ce”
Reliance in this respect may also be placed on the judgments reported
as “Nazir Ahmad Vs. The State” (2018 SCMR 787), “Asad Khan Vs.
The _ State” (PLD 2017 Supreme Court 681), “Nazeer Ahmed Vs.
The State” (2016 SCMR 1628), “Muhammad Jamshaid and another
Vs. The State and others” (2016 SCMR 1019) and “Abdul Majeed

Vs. The State” (2011 SCMR 941).

14. (iv) Medical evidence.

Insofar as the medical evidence of the prosecution is concerned,
I have noted that the same is also in-conflict with the ocular account of
the prosecution because the time of death of Mst. Khursheed Bibi
(deceased), as given by Lady Doctor Tasneem Naqvi (PW-5), does not
coincide with the time of death given by the prosecution witnesses
namely Muhammad Yahya complainant (PW-1) and Hafiz Muhammad
Tariq (PW-2). According to the prosecution case as set forth in the FIR
(Ex.PA/1), the complainant party received information regarding the
death of Mst.Khursheed Bibi (deceased), on the night of 17.09.2010 at
3.30 a.m. According to the statement of Lady Doctor Tasneem Naqvi
(PW-5), she conducted the postmortem examination of the dead body
of Mst. Khursheed Bibi (deceased) on 17.09.2010 and the time of
postmortem examination mentioned in the postmortem report (Ex.PF),
is 3.30 p.m. Lady Doctor Tasneem Naqvi (PW-5), stated that according
to her opinion, the probable time that elapsed between the injury and
death was immediate, whereas the probable time that elapsed between
the death and postmortem examination was 7 to 8 hours. As
postmortem examination was conducted on 17.09.2010, at 3.30 p.m,
therefore, according to the evidence of Lady Doctor Tasneem Naqvi
(PW-5), Mst. Khursheed Bibi (deceased), died approximately between
7.00 a.m to 8.00 a.m on 17.09.2010 but as mentioned earlier, in the
FIR (Ex.PA/1), it was alleged that on 17.09.2010, at 3.30 a.m, the
complainant party received the information regarding the death of Mst.
Khursheed Bibi (deceased). Even Muhammad Yahya complainant
(PW-1) and Hafiz Muhammad Tariq (PW-2), while appearing in the
witness box has categorically stated that they heard the news regarding
the death of Mst. Khursheed Bibi (deceased) at about 3.30 a.m (night).
It is, therefore, evident that time of death of Mst. Khursheed Bibi

(deceased), given by the abovementioned prosecution witnesses does
Criminal Appeal No.1238 of 2013 & 16
Criminal Revision No.723 of 2013. —

not coincide with the time of death of Mst. Khursheed Bibi (deceased),
as given by Lady Doctor Tasneem Naqvi (PW-5) and as such there is
conflict between the ocular account and the medical evidence of the
prosecution. Furthermore, it is by now well settled that medical
evidence is a type of supporting evidence, which may confirm the
ocular account with regard to receipt of injury, nature of the injury,
kind of weapon used in the occurrence but it would not identify the
assailant. Reference in this context may be made to the cases of
“Muhammad Tasaweer Vs. Hafiz Zulkarnain and 2 others” (PLD
2009 SC 53), “Altaf Hussain Vs. Fakhar Hussain _and_another”

(2008 SCMR 1103) and “Mursal_Kazmi_alias Qamar Shah and
another Vs. The State” (2009 SCMR 1410).

15. (vy) Evidence of extrajudicial confession of Raiyet Ali
(appellant) before Muhammad Yahya complainant
(PW-1), while in police custody.

Insofar as the alleged extrajudicial confession of Raiyet Ali
(appellant) before Muhammad Yahya complainant (PW-1), while
in police custody is concerned, it is by now well settled that
confession of an accused while in police custody is inadmissible in
evidence. Reliance in this respect may be placed on the judgment
reported as “Sajjan Solangi Vs. The State” (2019 SCMR 872),
wherein in paragraph No.3, of the judgment, the Apex Court of the

country was pleased to observe as under:-

3......60Sikandar Ali Malkani claimed that on
24.09.2003 petitioner Sajjan Solangi while in police
custody during interrogation made extra judicial
confession before him and the other witness but
admittedly under the Qanun-e-Shahahdat Order, 1984
the said disclosure under the custody before the police
in inadmissible whereas Muhammad Nawaz (PW-3)
who is also a witness of the said confession, did not
utter any word regarding such confession. The reliance

made by the Courts below on such inadmissible
evidence was unfortunate aspect of this case..........”

16. Ihave considered all the aspects of this case and have come to
this irresistible conclusion that the prosecution evidence is full of
doubts. It is by now well settled that if there is a single circumstance
which creates doubt regarding the prosecution case, the same is
sufficient to give benefit of doubt to the accused, whereas, the instant
case is replete with number of circumstances which have created
serious doubts about the truthfulness of the prosecution story. In
“Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State” (2018 SCMR 772), the Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan, at page 778, was pleased to observe as
under:-

“Asie Needless to mention that while giving the
benefit of doubt to an accused it is not necessary that
there should be many circumstances creating doubt.
If there is a circumstance which creates reasonable
doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of the
accused, then the accused would be entitled to the
benefit of such doubt, not as a matter of grace and
concession, but as a matter of right. It is based on the
maxima, “it is better that ten guilty persons be
acquitted rather than one innocent person be
convicted”

Similarly in ‘Tariq Pervez Vs. The State’ (1995 SCMR 1345),
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, at page 1347, was pleased to

observe as under:-

“Svecsuee The concept of benefit of doubt to an accused

person is deep-rooted in our country. For giving him
benefit of doubt, it is not necessary that there should
be many circumstances creating doubts. If there is a
circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a
prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then the
accused will be entitled to the benefit not as a matter
of grace and concession but as a matter of right.”

The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan while reiterating the
same principle in the case of “Muhammad Akram Vs. The State”

(2009 SCMR 230), at page 236, observed as under:-
*Aitazaz *

Criminal Appeal No.1238 of 2013 & 18
Criminal Revision No.723 of 2013. —

“D3 ese It is an axiomatic principle of law that in

case of doubt, the benefit thereof must accrue in

favour of the accused as matter of right and not of

grace. It was observed by this Court in the case of

Tariq Pervez v. The State 1995 SCMR 1345 that for

giving the benefit of doubt, it was not necessary that

there should be many circumstances creating doubts.

If there is circumstance which created reasonable

doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of the

accused, then the accused would be entitled to the

benefit of doubt not as a matter of grace and

concession but as a matter of right.”
17. In the light of above discussion, I accept Criminal Appeal
No.1238 of 2013 filed by Raiyet Ali (appellant), set aside his
conviction and sentence recorded by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge, Chunian, District Kasur vide impugned judgment dated
27.06.2013 and acquit him of the charge under Section 302(b) PPC by
extending him the benefit of doubt. Raiyet Ali (appellant) is in

custody, he be released forthwith, if not required in any other case.

18. Insofar the criminal revision i.e., Crl. Revision No.723 of
2013, filed by Muhammad Yahya (complainant) for enhancement of
sentence, awarded by the learned trial Court against Raiyet Ali
(appellant) from imprisonment for life to death is concerned, I have
already disbelieved the prosecution evidence due to the reasons
mentioned in paragraph Nos.11 to 15 of this judgment and Raiyet Ali
(appellant) has been acquitted by this Court due to the reasons,
mentioned therein, therefore, this criminal revision being devoid of any
force is hereby dismissed.
