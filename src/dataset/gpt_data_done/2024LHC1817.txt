COMPLAINANT BY: Nemo for the complainant.

MUHAMMAD AMJAD RAFIQ, J: Appellant, Rao

Humayun Wagas along with Rao Amir Aqash (since acquitted) was
tried by the learned Additional Sessions Judge/Judge MCTC, Lahore
in case FIR No.433 dated 12.05.2013 registered under sections
302/109/34 PPC at Police Station Sabzazar, Lahore and on
conclusion of trial, the learned trial Judge vide judgment dated
03.02.2021 while acquitting co-accused Rao Amir Aqash through the
same judgment convicted the appellant under section 302 (b) PPC
and sentenced him to imprisonment for life. The appellant was further
directed to pay Rs.5,00,000/- as compensation under section 544-A
Cr.PC to the legal heirs of Mustafa Ahmad (deceased), recoverable as
arrears of land revenue. In case of default, the convict was to undergo
further simple imprisonment for six months. Benefit of section 382-B
of Cr.PC was extended to the convict/appellant. Being aggrieved with
his above conviction and sentence, the appellant has filed this appeal.
2. According to the prosecution case set out in complaint Ex.PA

made by Mushtaq Ahmad complainant, he was present at his shop
Cri. A. No.10549 of 2021.

“Rehman Medical Store” along with his sons Mustafa and Nisar
Ahmad, when at about 11.50 am, accused namely Rao Amir (since
acquitted) and Rao Hamayoun (convict/appellant) came on Honda
125/CC Motorcycle, raised lalkara for teaching lesson for getting
their father arrested by the police and both started straight firing with
fire arm weapons. Mustafa got injured and fell down, whereas, Nisar
Ahmad saved his life while laying on ground. Injured succumbed to
injuries at the spot and the accused managed their escape.

It was alleged that on 11.05.2013 Rao Babar Ali had been
arrested by the police along with firearm on whose abetment such
occurrence was committed.

The complainant reported the matter to local police through a
written application (Exh.PA), upon which FIR (Exh.PE) was
registered. During the process, accused Rao Amir and Rao Humayun
remained absconders; later were declared proclaimed offenders and to
the extent of accused Rao Babar, report under section 173 Cr.PC was
submitted before the learned trial court and during trial proceedings,
on an application under section 265-K Cr.PC, he was acquitted of the
charge vide order dated 08.01.2018.

3. It is pertinent to mention here that during interrogation, it came
to light that Rao Amir and Rao Humayun had gone to Dubai, their
arrest was effected through Interpol on 26.03.2018 and adopting all
legal formalities, report under section 173 Cr.PC was submitted;
charge was framed against them to which they pleaded not guilty and
claimed to be tried.

4. At the trial, prosecution examined witnesses relating to ocular

account, medical evidence, arrest & recovery of pistol, investigation
Cri. A. No.10549 of 2021.

and abscondence. On close of prosecution evidence, statements of
accused under Section 342 Cr.PC were recorded wherein they denied
the prosecution version, however, did not opt to record statements
under Section 340(2) Cr.PC Ultimately, accused/appellant was
convicted and sentenced as detailed in the opening paragraph,
whereas, co-accused Rao Amir was acquitted.

5. Arguments heard. Record perused.

6. In support of ocular account, Mushtaq Ahmad/ complainant
and Nisar Ahmad entered appearance in the dock as PW-2 and PW-3.
Mushtaq Ahmad, PW-2 in his examination in chief narrated the
following story;

“Stated that the occurrence took place at Shah Noor when the sun
was about to set. My son was present in his shop. The polling was
on as it was election day. My son received injury and he fell down.
The persons scattered from the place of occurrence. The dispute was
about the maid. The injured was shifted to hospital and he
succumbed to the injuries. He received number of fire arms shots.
The postmortem examination was conducted upon the deceased and
we received the dead body of deceased and buried him.”

Such statement clearly shows that neither he mentioned the date and
time of occurrence nor nominated any accused. Name of deceased
was also not spoken, nor any role was assigned to any one for
committing murder. The deviancy from requirement of stating
particulars of charge against the appellant was also not attempted to
be justified. Such edition of statement in no case helps the
prosecution to substantiate the charges against the appellant.

7. Learned Additional Prosecutor General stated that complainant
was in advance age as being of 95 years, could not recollect the facts
after such a long time, therefore, not mentioning the name of accused
and other particulars is not fatal to the prosecution story.

8. It is observed that examination in chief of a witness is to be
Cri. A. No.10549 of 2021.

conducted by the Public Prosecutor who is required to follow the
pattern suggested as per international best practices so as to
facilitate and assist the witness to recollect the facts. The 17%
edition of a book titled “ADVOCACY” edited by Robert McPeake
printed by Oxford University Press explains that “examination in
chief is the process of eliciting evidence from your own witness and
is the first opportunity when the court has to assess the witness. A
strong impression made at that stage will give the witness
credibility and may withstand any attack in cross examination ”.

The aims of conducting examination in chief is usually three-fold;

(a) to establish your case or part of it through the evidence elicited
from the witness;

(b) to present the evidence so that it is clear, memorable and
persuasive;

(c) to insulate the evidence, insofar as possible, from anticipated
attack in cross examination.

To achieve such aim next step is the preparation which involves;

(i) _ selecting the order of witnesses;

(ii) selecting the order of evidence to be elicited from each witness.
It is preferable to start and finish your case with a witness who makes
a strong impression. Avoid calling your first witness whose evidence
is particularly vulnerable to cross examination and select which part

of his evidence is to be elicited first.

9. Though prosecutor is not authorized to ask the leading question
in examination in chief which is explained in Article 136 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 as “any question suggesting the

answer which the person putting in wishes or expects to receive is
Cri. A. No.10549 of 2021.

called a leading question”; however, it is subject to some
conditionalities as mentioned in Article-137 as under;

(1) Leading questions must not, if objected to by the adverse party,
be asked in an examination-in-chief, or in a reexamination, except
with the permission of the Court.

(2) The Court shall permit leading questions as to matters which are
introductory or undisputed, or which have in its opinion, been
already sufficiently proved.

First condition is objection of opposite party, if no objection is raised,
leading questions can well be asked, whereas on the objection of
opposite party, still there is a space to ask leading questions if the
Court permits. Court has been guided through the same provision to
grant permission if the question relates to matters which are
introductory or undisputed or which in the opinion of Court have

already been sufficiently proved.

10. Usually to avoid leading questions, prosecutors while conducting
examination in chief can use technique of five Ws, which means
formulating of interrogatories with “when, where, what, who, why”
and for seeking wide expression can ask the witness ‘to
describe/explain’ the fact he stated. The words may not be put into
the mouth of witness rather question must be framed in a sequence as
to extract the story of witness in his own words. Prosecutor is not
bound to conduct the examination in chief of witness in a sequence of
facts as mentioned in statements of witnesses recorded under section
161 Cr.PC rather it should be rearranged to create an impact by
abandoning the unnecessary details. KEITH EVANS in his book
“ADVOCACY IN COURT” (A Beginner’s guide) summarized the

task as follows;
Cri. A. No.10549 of 2021.

It is done by bearing in the mind the ‘one line of transcript’ rule,
breaking the thing down into the shortest questions eliciting the
shortest answers, and by analyzing out as you go along what building
bricks you in fact require in order to erect the structure of evidence
that you want from this witness. Broken down into the smallest
pieces, every story, just about, can be drawn out of a witness without
leading questions being used. But you often do have to break the
narrative down very finely.

11. Preparation of witnesses is an essential task for the prosecution
and it usually depends upon the status of witness as ordinary or
expert, and with further segregation as child, vulnerable, infirm,
incapacitated like deaf or dumb or old aged. Every sort is to be
attend accordingly and prosecutor, before presenting the witness in
the court, must have a meeting in order to apprise him about the
Court science, like appearance style, court decorum, manners and
attitude in response to questions asked by the prosecutor, defence
counsel and the Court. There are many techniques to follow for
conducting examination in chief of a witness. The main two
techniques were discussed by this Court in a case reported as

“MUHAMMAD RAMZAN Versus The STATE and others” (2023 P

Cr.L J 1156) as under;

“During examination-in-chief, two out of many techniques are most
popular to be allowed to follow by the prosecution i.e. (i)
signposting, and (ii) piggybacking. Signposting in fact is an indicator
to alert the witness to a particular part of his testimony e.g., telling
the witness that now some questions would be asked about his
status/work or questions about his relation with other witnesses and
so on; this bit-by-bit examination helps the witness to recollect the
facts clearly and it is permissible as per international best practices.
Piggybacking is a form of question arranged with the part of answer
given by the witness while using it as prefix to next question, e.g., if
a witness replied that accused made a fire shot which hit the
deceased; then by using technique of piggybacking, next question
can be framed like; “when the fire hit the deceased, how did he react
or what happened to him”. This technique also helps to produce a
conjunction in or symmetry to evidence. It is the domain of the court
to control question which a party wants to ask as per Article 143 of
QSO, 1984; therefore, court should remain vigilant while attending
such questions and decide its relevancy or admissibility then and
there; if a question is asked without reasonable ground, then court
can take proper action as required under Articles 144, 145 and 146
of QSO, 1984.”
Cri. A. No.10549 of 2021.

12. Apart from technique of signposting and piggybacking for
conducting examination in chief of a witness, there are in place
certain other suitable and practiced rules in every nook and corner
of the world in the Courts. In terms of ‘Form of questions’,

guidelines are as under;

(i) Do not lead (ii) Avoid wide question and ask
focused/specific/targeted questions (iii) Avoid long question and ask
short, simple questions (iv) Avoid compound questions and ask one
question at a time (v) one point at a time (vi) Have a dialogue and
ensure the questions follow on (vii) establish facts not conclusions
(viii) Avoid comment, build to a point.

For sequence or structure of questions, following rules are

followed;

(i) Help the witness to tell the story (ii) paint a picture (iii) Help the
Court to follow (iv) use the exhibits and photos (v) use of plans (vi)
avoid irrelevancies (vii) listen to the answers (viii) avoid quick fire
questions (ix) avoid interrupting (x) use piggybacking as cited above.

To have a control on the witness, techniques are as follows;

(i) Ask precise question (ii) know your material (iii) demonstrate
clear direction (iv) know where you are going (v) plan transition or
alternate questions

13. In the present case, prosecution has not attempted to elicit the
necessary facts from the mouth of complainant by using any of above
techniques, therefore, prosecution case is bereft of material necessary
to substantiate the charge. Learned Additional Prosecutor General
however, states that Nisar (PW-3) has deposed in support of
prosecution version and statement of single witness is sufficient to
substantiate the charge. There is no cavil to the proposition that
conviction can be recorded on the testimony of a single witness but it
is only in a situation when there is only one witness available at the
place of occurrence but when prosecution claims more witnesses at

the crime scene, then disbelieving the testimony of one or two in
Cri. A. No.10549 of 2021.

contrast to others, squarely helps the prosecution to stay and build
their abode on the testimony of single witness because in that
eventuality absence of corroboration stems so strong to fail the
prosecution case easily in terms of nonavailability of proof beyond
reasonable doubt while casting a serious doubt on that single
testimony. However, it has been observed that Nisar Ahmad (PW-3)
when entered appearance has entirely changed the complexion of
prosecution case by stating that though Rao Humayun and Rao Amir
came at the place of occurrence yet Rao Humayun was holding two
pistols in his hand but he did not state anything about firing made
separately by Rao Humayun or Rao Amir rather in a slipshod manner
stated that accused persons came to the shop on motorcycle and after
firing made their escape good from the place of occurrence, though a
little touch was given in terms that they fired upon his real brother
who was sitting on the chair. Such narration is so complex and based
on compound impression as not to accept it a clear story with safe
and sound effect that the accused/appellant is responsible for qatl-a-
amd of Mustafa Ahmad deceased, particularly when co-accused with
similar role stood acquitted on the same set of evidence. Thus, there
is no credible evidence available to substantiate the charge against the
appellant in terms of ocular account.

14. The above narration of PWs indicates that they were not
present at the place of occurrence and this fact further gets strengthen
from delayed postmortem examination which was conducted on next
day i.e., 13.05.2013 with a delay of 22 hours. Though PW-12, Dr.
Riasat Ali, Demonstrator Forensic Medicine & Toxicology, King

Edward Medical University, Lahore has observed that deceased
Cri. A. No.10549 of 2021.

sustained seven entry wounds with some exits on different parts of
his body but it is trite that medical evidence being confirmatory in

nature does not indicate the man responsible for causing such injures.

15. The recovery of pistol 9-mm is not helpful to the prosecution in
the sense that it did not match with the spent shells collected from the
spot. Thus, recovery is totally inconsequential losing its corroborative

effect in this case.

16. So far as the question that accused/appellant remained
absconder, there is plethora of authorities of superior Courts on this
point that mere abscondence of accused is not a conclusive proof of
the guilt of the accused. The value of abscondence depends upon the
fact of each case and abscondence alone cannot take the place of guilt
unless and until the case is otherwise proved on the basis of cogent
and reliable evidence, therefore, in view of the dictum handed down

in “RAHIMULLAH JAN Versus KASHIF and another” (PLD 2008

SC_298) mere abscondence would not be taken as a conclusive proof
of guilt of accused. If any other authority in respect of abscondence is

needed, reliance can also be placed upon “ZALEY MIR versus THE

STATE” (1999 AC 564) printed by NLR publication, wherein
abscondence of four years of the accused was not taken as a ground
for conviction of the accused and accordingly the conviction was set-

aside.

17. It is trite that when substantive evidence fails, investigation or
other material hardly supply want of evidence and it cannot be looked

into for the purpose of stretching anything favourable to the
Cri. A. No.10549 of 2021.

prosecution except one in the form of digital or forensic evidence,

which is not available in this case.

18. For what has been discussed above, I am of the firm opinion
that prosecution has not been able to establish the charge against the
accused/appellants beyond any shadow of doubt. In the case “NAJAF

ALI SHAH versus The STATE” (2021 SCMR_ 736), the Supreme

Court of Pakistan has held that for giving benefit of doubt to an
accused a single circumstance creating reasonable doubt in a prudent
mind about guilt of accused is sufficient to make him entitled to such
benefit. Here in this case as discussed above the prosecution has
squarely failed to bring home the guilt against the accused person.
Consequently, the instant appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment
of conviction and sentence is set-aside and the accused/appellant is
acquitted of the charges levelled against him. He shall be released
forthwith if not required in any other case or proceedings. Case
property, if any, be disposed of strictly in accordance with law,

whereas record of the learned trial court be sent back immediately.
