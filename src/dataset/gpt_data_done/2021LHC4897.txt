Crl. Appeal No.3873-ATA-15 (2)

2. Feeling aggrieved of his conviction and sentence, the
appellant has filed the instant criminal appeal.

3. The facts narrated in the First Information Report
(Exh.PB/1), are that on 13.05.2015 at 03:30 p.m.,_ the
complainant/respondent No.2 along with three other employees as well
as driver, in a Government vehicle, duly armed with weapons were
patrolling at Darbar Haider Saaien, when, on receiving secret
information, they raided at Lorry Adda Bus-stand Lahore, where three
persons were coming out of the Lorry Adda having parachute bags in
their hands. It is further stated that on pointation of the informer the
police succeeded to apprehend one of the three persons whereas two of
them escaped. After arrest, the apprehended accused disclosed the names
of his companions as Asad and Mubashir sons of Mehboob as
commanders of ‘Al-Qaida’. On search, one live hand-grenade, one
detonator, prima cord red coloured about 09-feet, 05-k.g. explosive
substance and three electric circuits were recovered from the accused. It
is also stated that the officials of Bomb Disposal Squad arrived at the
spot, analyzed the recovered articles and defused the hand-grenade
immediately. For forensic science analysis, ten grams of explosive
substance, small piece of prima cord and three grams substance from
hand-grenade were separated and rest of the articles were taken in
possession under seal, whereafter the complainant prepared a memo of

recovery.
Crl. Appeal No.3873-ATA-15 (3)

4. The accused-appellant on framing of formal charge pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial and the prosecution to substantiate the charge
examined as many as six witnesses. In the ultimate, he was convicted
and sentenced, as stated supra.

5. Learned counsels for the appellant inter alia contend that
the present case against the appellant was false inasmuch as from the
concocted story of police, the malafide is established from record. The
appellant had been picked-up by members of some agency regarding
which FIR No.75 dated 01.05.2015 (mark ‘B’) was got registered by
father of the appellant; it is also established from letter dated 07.05.2015
issued by the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances,
Directorate General Civil Defence, Islamabad, that regarding missing of
appellant direction was issued for registration of case and JIT to be
constituted for the purpose was directed to submit report before 20"
May, 2015. In such constrained circumstances, the respondent police in
order to avoid custody/presence of the appellant with them, involved him
in a case showing as a terrorist, which could easily be falsified by these
two documents, which have totally been ignored by the learned trial
Court saying that the same were afterthought. Further contend that the
respondent police did not offer or bring some independent witness at the
time of appellant’s alleged arrest reflecting from the FIR, shown from a
thickly populated area, i.e. Bus Terminal. In support of these

contentions, the learned counsels have placed reliance on “Jntekhab
Crl. Appeal No.3873-ATA-15 (4)

Ahmad Abbasi and others v. The State and others (2018 SCMR 495),

relevant portion whereof is as follows:-
“Attending to the first part, the very arrest of the
appellant/petitioners from the parking lot of Awan Service
Station with explosive laden vehicles appears to be highly
intriguing one. The heavy contingent of police raided the
premises, surrounded it from all four corners and during
the arrest, recovery and seizure proceedings not a single
public witness was associated. Even the owner,
caretaker/manager and particularly the watchman, who
was deputed for the look-after and care of the parked
vehicles to ensure that no vehicle parked inside is taken
away by unauthorized person, was not available or could
not be procured. The large contingent of police remained
on the crime scene for many hours but out of all these
persons, none was available. This mysterious circumstance
by itself would bespeak about the proceedings conducted
behind the blind curtain out of the sight of such persons.”
It is lastly contended that the appellant has nothing to do with the
commission of offence and the learned trial Court convicted and
sentenced the appellant erroneously; hence, the conviction and sentence
are liable to be set-aside.
6. On the other hand, supporting the impugned conviction, the
learned Deputy Prosecutor General submitted that the trial Court passed
the judgment strictly according to the prosecution evidence through
which it succeeded to prove the case against the appellant without any
shadow of doubt. Regarding the documents he contended that both these
documents have been rightly discarded by the learned trial Court saying
the same afterthought.
7. We have heard the arguments, examined the record with the

assistance of learned counsels for the appellant as well as the learned

Deputy Prosecutor General.
Crl. Appeal No.3873-ATA-15 (5)

8. The prosecution case revolves around the statements of
PW-1 and PW-2, who furnished the ocular account as the other official
witnesses were given-up. These witnesses do not seem to agree on the
time, distance and defusing of hand-grenade, allegedly recovered from
the appellant inasmuch as PW-1-complainant/Inspector in his complaint
(Ex.P-B/1) stated that he received spy information at 3.30 p.m. whereas
in his cross-examination he has given the evidence contrary to it saying
that,
“T had consulted with D.S.P CTD through my mobile
telephone set on his official land line telephone number
after receipt of spy information. This call was made by me
at about 01.45-03.00 pm.”

Aforesaid PW further stated in his cross-examination that, “the
distance between us and the accused was about 100-150 feet when we
saw the accused. In between us and the accused there were two busy
roads where buses and trucks ply usually.” PW-2 Hafiz Al-Mozaam Ali
has deposed in his cross-examination that, “when spy pointed out
towards the accused, the distance between us and the accused was about
15-20 feet.”

Both these witnesses are unanimous on the fact that they did not
encircle the Bus. PW-1 admitted in his cross-examination that the
accused facing trial did not try to run away and none of them tried to
chase two accused (since POs) who fled from there.

These two important witnesses are also unanimous on the fact that
the recovered articles were examined by the officials of PFSA and BDS,

who immediately defused the hand-grenade at the spot but report of the
Crl. Appeal No.3873-ATA-15 (6)

Bomb Disposal Commander, Ex.P-C, opined the hand-grenade with

detonating assembly alive and filled with explosive which could cause

damage to human life/property if used/blasted.

The above-noted contradictions in statements of two important

prosecution witnesses on material aspects make the prosecution story

full of doubts.

9.

Another aspect of the matter is that bare reading of the FIR

gives rise to a lot of questions in the mind of a man of ordinary

prudence, e.g.

i)

ii)

iv)

When the raiding party was consisting of five well-armed
persons, how they could not arrest the other two suspected
persons when they were not alleged to have any

ammunition/weapon;

Raiding party after receiving the spy information reached at
Bus Terminal with full preparation knowing that three
suspects were coming and further all the three were
carrying parachute bags full of explosive substance and they
travelled from Rawalpindi to Lahore and none of them was
noticed/checked by any other agency when they boarded or
alighted from Bus. Out of these three, two fled away and
the police could not make any effort to arrest those two
persons although it was alleged that all the three were
carrying bags full of explosive substance. Such narration in
the FIR itself is enough to cause a serious dent in the

prosecution story.

It is obvious that maker of FIR failed to give description or
even number of grenade, thus the manner of recovery is

doubtful.
Crl. Appeal No.3873-ATA-15 (7)

v) | The most depressed feature of the case is that the police
never remained worried about the other bolting suspects
who were carrying parachute bags full of explosive
substance as per FIR as the investigation file/record is silent
in this regard after passing of order dated 11.06.2015 by the
learned trial Court on request of I.0., whereby
proclamations u/s 87, Cr.P.C. were issued against
appellant’s co-accused namely Asad Mehboob and
Mubashar Mehboob sons of Mehboob Ali.

10. We are also of the view that significance/effect of the
specific documents, i.e. FIR No.75, dated 01.05.2015 and letter dated
07.05.2015 issued by the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced
Disappearances, Directorate General Civil Defence stipulating the
disappearance of the appellant much before registration of FIR dated
13.05.2015 in which the appellant has been convicted, cannot be
ignored. Since the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances
has issued specific direction for registration of case about disappearance
of the appellant and JIT was also entrusted inquiry and submission of
report before 20.05.2015, no option was left with the police/agencies
except to plant a false case against the appellant to continue the custody;
so much so, the story of carrying of explosive substance introduced in
the FIR also does not inspire confidence.

It is also astonished to notice that the raiding party did not have

any information regarding names of the three alleged accused coming
through a Bus from Rawalpindi to Lahore but at the time of recording

FIR, after apprehending the present appellant out of those three unknown
Crl. Appeal No.3873-ATA-15 (8)

persons, the names of other two persons have specifically been
mentioned along with their paternity and their address and despite these
details neither any effort was made by the investigating agency either to
collect any evidence regarding whereabouts or recovery of alleged
explosive substance from those suspected accused to make it part of the
record; this fact forced us to infer that not only the appellant but the two
other persons were also in custody of the police or any other agency
investigating the matter. These documents are enough to hold that the
appellant was in custody of the police or any agency and on account of
registration of case of his disappearance and direction to JIT for
submission of record constrained the police or any other agency to
involve the petitioner in the explosive substance case to maintain his
custody in a legal manner. In the case-law 2018 SCMR 495, referred to
supra by the learned counsel for the appellant, the honourable Supreme
Court being cognizant of such situation and circumstances, laid down as
under:-
“21. We are constrained to re-emphasize that this sacred
judicial obligation must be performed in a strict judicial
manner observing all safeguards and precautions as laid
down in the High Court Rules and Orders. Printed
proforma containing questionnaire is not to be used
because it amounts to filling the blanks and is not in accord
with the requirements of law and rules. In view of the
changing trend of investigation, particularly in sensitive
cases and keeping in view the phenomenon of forced
disappearance of people and because in some cases the
accused are not kept in the lock up of the notified police
station therefore, the following additional questions may be

put to accused person, when a situation of this nature
arises, which is as follows: -
Crl. Appeal No.3873-ATA-15 (9)

(i) | When and by whom you were arrested and from
which place?

(ii) Where you were kept during custody by the
police/investigating agency?

(iii) Whether previously you were produced before any
other Magistrate for recording confession and you
had refused to confess?

In such eventuality, this Court concludes that while ignoring these
important documentary evidence, the learned trial Court has committed
material illegality and irregularity.
11. Therefore, we are of the view that case FIR No.9 dated
13.05.2015 is false and in an effort to involve the appellant who was
otherwise illegally and unlawfully abducted and his custody was
concealed from his family and to legalize their act, this false case was
got registered. It is not out of place to mention here that, as per police
record, the appellant has no previous record nor he was ever convicted in
any criminal case.
12. Even otherwise, the appellant denied all the prosecution
allegations and piece of evidence while making his statement under
Section 342, Cr.P.C., in particular, when asked why this case was made
against him, he stated as under:-
“This false and fabricated case was registered against me
to show efficiency to the high ups of the police. Actually on
08.12.2014 at 06.30 am I was arrested by a number of
police officials wearing uniform and some without uniform.
To save the skin from illegal detention, this case was
registered against me. I alongwith my relatives Khurram
Shahzad and Mehboob Hussain were arrested on the same
day. About my abduction case FIR  No.75/15
dated:01.05.2015 u/s 365 PPC had been registered at P.S
Jatily District Rawalpindi. My father Aurangzaib submitted

an application on 07.05.2015 before commission of inquiry
against forced disappearances.”
Crl. Appeal No.3873-ATA-15 (10)

When on the basis of evidence produced, the prosecution has failed to
establish guilt against the appellant, his above statement would be
accepted in its entirety without requiring the proof under Article 121,

Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984. Reliance is placed on “Ali Ahmad and another

v. The State and others (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 201).

13. It is well settled principle in administration of criminal
justice that prosecution remains under heavy burden to prove the charge
against the accused beyond reasonable doubt, whereas in the instant case
it has failed to do so. For giving the benefit of doubt it is not necessary
that there should be many circumstances creating doubt. Single
circumstance creating reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt
of accused makes him entitled to its benefit as a matter of right and not

grace as held in the case of “Tariq Pervez v. The State” (1995 SCMR

1345), “Muhammad Akram VS The State” (2009 SCMR 230), “Nadeem

Hussain v. The State” (2019 SCMR 1290) and “Muhammad Mansha v.

The State” (2018 SCMR 772). Relevant portion from the later
pronouncement is as follows:-

“Needless to mention that while giving the benefit of doubt
to an accused it is not necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating doubt. If there is a circumstance
which creates reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the
guilt of the accused, then the accused would be entitled to
the benefit of such doubt, not as a matter of grace and
concession, but as a matter of right. It is based on the
maxim, “it is better that ten guilty persons be acquitted
rather than one innocent person be convicted.”

Resultantly, this appeal is accepted, the conviction and sentences

awarded through impugned judgment dated 23.11.2015 are set-aside and
Gull*

the appellant-Yasir Aurangzaib is acquitted of the charge. He is directed

to be released forthwith, if not required in any other case.
