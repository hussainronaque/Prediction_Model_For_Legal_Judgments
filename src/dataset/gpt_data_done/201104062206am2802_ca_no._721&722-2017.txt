JUDGMENT

Dost Musammad Khan, J.— The petitioners are

facing charge/charges u/s.18(g) read with section 24 of the NAO,
1999 in a Reference, filed against them and four others for
cheating a large number of persons through fake ‘documents of
ownership of land to purchase plots for residential purposes and in
this way they along with co-accused fraudulently received a huge
amount of Rs.109.55 million from different peoples, thus, they
were found to have committed corruption and corrupt practices as
defined u/s 9(c) (iti) (iv) (ix) & (xii), punishable u/s 10 of the NAO,
1999, ,

2. Although the trial in the case has commenced
however, learned Sr. ASC, Mr. Tariq Mehmood invileu our
attention to undeniable fact that one of the co-accused who played

similar role, namely, Col.(R) Muhammad Ajmal, was made
approver while three of the co-accused, who have played more
active role, have been granted bait. He also referred to the
judgment of this Court dated 14.11.2016 at pages 95 to 97 of the
paper book where leave petitions No.2433,2555 and 2994 of 2016,
filed by the three-accused were although dismissed on merits
however, directions were given to the NAB to complete the
investigation against the petitioners and all those including the
officials of the local revenue department, who have also played role
in this case, and forward it to the Accountability Court within 30
days, while the Accountability Court was directed to conclude the
trial within a period of three months positively, failing which the
petitioners shall be released on bail, if they furnish bail-bonds in
the sum of Rs.50,00,000/- (5 million) each with two sureties in the
like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court.

3. The learned Sr. ASC further contended that when the
ring leader has been granted bail on account of delay in the trial
and because apout 70 witnesses are to be examined by the NAB,
which shall, in all probabilities, have to consume a period cf more
than one year therefore, keeping in view the fact that the
petitioners are behind the bars for long period and when their case
is not distinguishable from that of the co-accused on the above
ground, rather is placed on better pedestal, hence they are entitled -
to the grant of the same.

4. Syed Ali Imran, learned DPG, NAB, present in Court
alongwith Mr. Ali Hassan, 1.0, could not controvert this factual
and legal position rather he disclosed that review petition was filed
against the above mentioned order of this Court, which too was

dismissed.

CP 875/17 & CP 1252/17 3

5. In view cf the facts and circumstances, not on merits
put on the ground of delay in the trial, the petitioners are found
entitled to grant of bail. Accordingly both the petitions are
converted into appeals and the same are allowed. The petitioners
are granted bail in the sum of Rs.50,00,000/- (5 millions) each,
with two sureties each to the satisfaction of the Trial Court with
further direction to the petitioners to deposit their original latest
passports with the Trial Court. ; —_
