ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI,_J.-__ Appellant

Ajmal aged about 41 years, was tried by learned Additional

Sessions Judge-I, Charsadda for committing the

Qatl-e-Amd of Baseer Ali deceased and on conclusion of

trial, vide impugned judgment dated 19.11.2012, he was

convicted under section 302 (b) PPC and sentenced to

undergo life imprisonment as well as to pay Rs.1,00,000/-,

further. Similarly, under section 13 of the Arms Ordinance,

he was convicted and sentenced to undergo 03 years R.I.

and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/- or in default thereof to

undergo 02 months S.I. further. Benefit of section 382-B

Cr.P.C. has been extended to him.

2. Through this appeal and Cr.A. No.617-P/2012,

appellant-convict has questioned his conviction and

sentences mentioned above. Since, both the appeals are the

outcome of judgments of the learned Trial Court dated

19.11.2012, in one and the same FIR No.1602 dated

21.11.2010, registered at Police Station Charsadda under

sections 302/324 PPC and section 13 of the Arms

Ordinance, therefore, we intend to dispose of the same

through this common judgment.

3. The prosecution case as unfolded in First

Information Report is that on 21.11.2010 at 1600 hours,

Akhtar Ali (PW.7), in company of dead body of his son

Baseer Ali deceased, reported to local police in casualty of

Charsadda hospital that Ajmal (appellant-convict herein)

had caused damage to his sugarcane crop; against which the

deceased complainant to appellant, but he started altercation

with the deceased; that after their separation, the appellant

rushed to his house, and attracted to the spot duly armed

with firearm and opened fire at them with the intention to

do them away, resultantly, the deceased got hit and died on

the spot, while he luckily remained unscathed. Altercation a

while before the incident over causing damage to the

sugarcane crop between the deceased and appellant, has

been alleged as motive behind the incident. Report of

Akhtar Ali complainant was recorded in the shape of

muraila Exh.PA/1 by Munir Khan SI (PW.3) on the basis of

which FIR mentioned above was registered. He prepared

injury sheet and inquest report Exh.PW.3/1 and

Exh.PW.3/2 of the deceased and shifted his dead body to

the mortuary for post mortem examination.

4. Dr. Jehangir Shah (PW.4) conducted autopsy

on the dead body of deceased Baseer on 21.11.2010 and

found the following injuries on his person:-

1. Firearm entry wound on left arm, exit not found.

2. Firearm entry wound 1/3 x 1/3 cm on left side

chest below axilla exit not found.

3. Firearm entry wound 1/3 x 1/3 cm on left chest,

exit not found.

4. Firearm entry wound 1/3 x 1/3 cm on left

shoulder, exit not found.

5. Abrasion on left shoulder 1‚Äù x 1 cm.

Thorax: Walls, ribs, cartilages, pleurae and left lung

damaged.

Abdomen: Healthy.

Opinion: In opinion of the medical Officer, deceased died

due to shock, heavy blood loss and injury to lungs caused

by firearm. X-ray advised which shows multiple pellets

inside chest and arm.

5. Rasheed Khan SI (PW.8) proceeded to the spot

and prepared site plan Exh.PB at the instance of

complainant Akhtar Ali. During spot inspection he

recovered 12 bore empty Exh.P.1 and took it into

possession vide recovery memo Exh.PW.1/1. Vide recovery

memo Exh.PW.1/2 he took into possession bloodstained

last worn garments of the deceased in presence of witness

and sent the same to the FSL for chemical analysis, report

whereof is Exh.PK. Appellant was arrested by Munir Khan

ASI on 21.11.2010 vide arrest card Exh.PW.8/3 and was

handed over to PW.8. He obtained physical custody of the

accused/appellant, interrogated him, and recovered 12 bore

shot gun No.109308 Exh.P.6 on his pointation vide memo

Exh.PW.2/1, prepared sketch of the place of recovery

Exh.PB/1. He sent the crime empty and recovered shotgun

to the FSL for analysis, report whereof is Exh.PK/1. On

24.11.2010, he produced the accused before the learned

Judicial Magistrate, where he recorded his confessional

statement. On completion of investigation, he handed over

the case file to the SHO, who submitted challan against the

accused/appellant.

6. On receipt of challan by the learned Trial Court,

appellant was charge sheeted to which he pleaded not guilty

and claimed trial. To prove its case, prosecution examined

as many nine witnesses. After closure of the prosecution

evidence, statement of appellant was recorded under section

342 Cr.P.C. wherein he denied the prosecution allegations

and professed his innocence. He, however, declined to be

examined on oath under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. or to

produce evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial, learned

Trial Court, after hearing both the sides, convicted and

sentenced the appellant as mentioned above.

7. Learned counsel for the appellant-convict argued

that impugned judgment of the learned Trial Court is the

result of misreading and non-reading of evidence available

on record; that actually it was complainant Akhtar Ali, who

on the day of occurrence, alongwith his deceased son and

other relatives first thrashed the appellant and thereafter

attempted at his life by firing at him, as a result, but he

luckily escaped, however, his wife Mst. Miana Gul

sustained injury on her right thigh due to firing of Akhtar

Ali complainant of the instant case, which occurrence has

been reported by her in the shape of FIR No.1603 of the

even date i.e. 21.11.2010 charging complainant Akhtar Ali

under section 324 PPC; that the learned trial Court has erred

in law while believing and relying upon the concocted story

of the complainant and disbelieving the genuine version of

the wife of appellant; that the incident has not taken place

in the mode and manner as alleged by complainant Akhtar,

but in the manner as alleged by wife of the appellant

Mst. Mina Gul in FIR No.1603 as well as by the appellant

in his confessional statement; that the learned Trial Court

though has taken into consideration the confessional

statement of the appellant, but not in its totality; that if the

confessional statement of the appellant is taken in its

totality, then the case of the appellant squarely falls within

the general exception of Section 100 PPC, as it was

complainant Akhtar Ali, his deceased son and other

relatives who thrashed the appellant, and thereafter Akhtar

Ali fired at him, but he luckily remained unscathed,

however, his wife sustained injury, whereafter the appellant

in his private defence to save his life and life of his wife,

reacted in self defence by making a single fire shot, which

resulted the death of the deceased; that the appellant has not

exceeded his right of private defence, as he has not repeated

the fire shot, but just to expel the assault of the complainant

party exercised his right of private defence, in the

circumstances, compelling him to do so, therefore, he has

not committed any offence and is liable to be acquitted.

8. Conversely, for the complainant contended that

appellant is directly and singularly charged for committing

the murder of the deceased in a promptly lodged report; that

being daylight incident and parties co-villagers inter-se,

question of mistaken identity does not arise; that there exit

no previous enmity or ill will between the parties, hence,

substitution of the real culprit by implicating the appellant

falsely does not arise to a prudent mind; that case FIR

registered on the report of wife of the appellant is just a

concocted story to counterblast the instant murder case; that

ocular account furnished by complainant is straight forward

and confidence inspiring and he being father of the

deceased, his presence on the spot was natural; that

prosecution has badly failed to create any dent in his

testimony; that ocular account is supported and

corroborated by medical evidence, positive FSL reports qua

crime empty and weapon as well as bloodstained articles.

Similarly, the voluntary confessional statement of the

appellant is also corroborated by the ocular evidence as

well as corroborative pieces of evidence mentioned above.

He contended that FIR No.1603 of the even date is just to

counterblast the genuine case of the complainant. He while

supporting the impugned judgment sought dismissal of the

appeals.

9. Learned AAG adopted the arguments of learned

counsel for the complainant.

10. We have given our anxious consideration to the

respective submissions of either side and perused the record

with their able assistance.

11. It appears from the impugned judgment that the

learned Trial Court has believed and relied upon the ocular

10

account of complainant Akhtar Ali (PW.7) as well as

confessional statement of the appellant coupled with

corroborative pieces of circumstantial evidence. Record

divulges the place of incident to be an open plot near

railway track of village Malak Abad. In the site plan

Exh.PB prepared at the instant of complainant, the deceased

has been shown at point No.1 and complainant at point

No.2. The inter-se distance of these two points, is 3 paces.

The appellant has been shown at point No.3-A at a distance

of 56 paces from deceased and complainant. PW Akhtar Ali

at point No.2 in close proximity of the deceased at point

No.1, does fall in fire line of the appellant at Point No.3-A,

but he has not received a single scratch, much less any

firearm injury, despite that the appellant has been assigned

12 bore shot gun, pellets of which spreads more in case of a

a long distance like the one in the instant case i.e. 56 paces.

Receipt of four entrance wounds on different parts of body

of the deceased, as a result of single shot, is proof of the

fact that the pellets had been spread. A cartridge of 12 bore

11

shotgun contains 9 pellets. If four pellets hit the deceased,

the remaining 5 pellets would have definitely hit the

complainant, had he been present with the deceased at a

distance of 3 paces as the deceased has not received pellets

injuries in shape of bunch, which means that the pellets of

the fire shot had been spread. This aspect of the case creates

serious doubt about the fairness and credibility of the

complainant that he has not come forward with truthful

account of the incident. Rather, he tried his level best to

suppress the real facts and the actual mode and manner of

the incident as well as concealed his own role in the

incident, therefore, the learned Trial Court has wrongly

believed and relied upon his testimony. He being

untrustworthy and incredible, we, therefore, straightaway

discard his testimony from consideration.

12. Now we are left with the confessional

statement of the appellant recorded by learned Judicial

Magistrate, recovery of 12 bore shot gun on his pointation,

positive FSL report about the crime empty and shotgun as

12

well as medical evidence in the shape of autopsy report of

the deceased. We have observed that the learned Trial court

has not taken into consideration the confessional statement

of the appellant in its entirety which is against the principle

laid down by the apex court in Bahadur Khan‚Äôs case

(PLD 1995 Supreme Court 336), wherein it has been held

by the Hon‚Äôble Supreme Court that ‚ÄúConfession has to be

read as a whole and not by relying only on the inculpatory
part of the statement‚Äù. Same view has been reiterated by the
Hon‚Äôble Supreme Court in ‚ÄúAllah Nawaz‚Äôs case (2009
SCMR 736), that confession of an accused is to be rejected or

accepted as a whole.

13. Before dilating the voluntariness and

evidentiary value of the confessional statement of the

appellant, we would like to first reproduce the same in

translated form of English:-

‚ÄúStated that on the day of occurrence my son
had gone to the field of complainant so as to

bring grass for the cattle and when he returned,

13

complainant came to me and _ complained

against the act of my son; on which I satisfied

him that my son will not repeat such like act;

that on the same day after ‚ÄúAssar prayer time‚Äù

Akhtar Ali complainant, his son, accompanied

by their relatives having sticks started thrashing

me. When I inquired about the reasons, they

replied as to why I have cut the grass from their

field; that complainant Akhtar Ali was armed

with gun, who called his son to remain away

from me so that he hit me with fire; on which I

run towards my house, but Akhtar Ali opened

fire at me, from which I escaped but my wife

got hit and injured. I infuriated so in order to

save my life and respect I picked my gun and

fired one shot, with which Baseer deceased got

hit and died. I myself then went to Police

Station and offered my arrest. I was compelled

for doing the above act because of compulsion

of my private defence and respect‚Äù.

14

The record of case FIR No.1603 dated 21.11.2010

registered under section 324 PPC at Police Station

Charsadda is also before us in connection with connected

Cr.A. No.619-P/2012, titled, ‚ÄúMst. Mina Gul Vs Akhtar

Gul‚Äù also fixed for today. The version of Mst. Mian Gul

complainant in the aforesaid case corroborates the

confessional statement of the appellant. The date, time and

parties of both the cases are one and the same, while the

site plans of the two cases slightly varies from each other.

According to report of complainant Mst. Mian Gul on the

fateful day her husband (the appellant), entered the house;

he was being chased by Akhtar Ali (complainant of the

instant case) duly armed with firearm; that Akhtar Ali

opened fire at him, but he luckily remained unscathed,

however, she got hit and sustained injury on her right

thigh. She further disclosed that her husband was beaten by

accused Akhtar Ali, his son and other relatives as a result

he was feeling pain in his body and had injury on his head.

The medico legal report of injured Mst. Mina Gul and

15

accused/appellant in the above-mentioned case,

corroborates the confessional statement of the appellant.

Same motive as alleged by the appellant, has been alleged

by her in report. It is borne out from the record that after

the incident, the appellant did not abscond rather he

himself went to Police Station alongwith his injured wife

and offered his arrest. Positive FSL report about single

empty of 12 bore shot gun and shotgun recovered on the

pointation of the appellant, further corroborates the version

of appellant qua single shot made by him. None recovery

of blood from the spot as alleged by the complainant of the

instant case, supplements the confessional statement of the

appellant that the occurrence has not taken place at the

place as alleged by complainant rather at the place as

shown by the appellant. While scrutinizing the entire

record of both the incidents, one thing is clear then crystal

that both the parties have tried their best to suppress and

concealed their acts because Mst. Mina Gul in her report

has not described the role of her husband after she

16

sustained injury and similarly, complainant of the instant

case Akhtar Ali also did not bother to disclose his role

played in cross case. However, in his confessional

statement, the appellant has furnished the true account of

the incident without minimizing his role and maximizing

the role of the other complainant party which squarely

brings the case in hand within the ambit of right of self

defence, which plea though has not been specifically taken

by the appellant in his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C.,

but spelt out from the peculiar facts and circumstances of

the case, particularly, from his confessional statement.

14. In light of the principles laid down by the

apex court in the judgment (supra), if we rely on the

confessional statement of the appellant, then the same

would be taken in its totality. True that appellant has not

specifically taken defence plea, but plea of self-defence is

clearly spelt out from his confessional statement, which

has also to be given weight as per the dictum of the

17

Hon‚Äôble Supreme Court laid down in case titled,

‚ÄúMuhammad Zaman Vs Dost Muhammad and others‚Äù

(1988 SCMR 388), that plea of self-defence is to be

accepted, though not raised specifically in statement

recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C. It has been further held

by the apex court that where from circumstances of case

right of self-defence can reasonably be spelled out for

accused, it cannot be denied to him. In case titled,

‚ÄúMuhammad Ishaq and another Vs the State‚Äù (PLD 1964

Peshawar 143), it has been observed by this Court that

plea of private defence, although not raised by accused,

receiving support from circumstances proved by

prosecution, accused shall be entitled to benefit of self

defence. There is nothing on the record to prove the

confessional statement of the appellant to be the result of

torture, coercion, inducement etc. Rather, from the

statement of learned Judicial Magistrate, it is established

that it was recorded in accordance with law after fulfilling

all the legal formalities, therefore, mere retraction of the

18

appellant from it in his statement under section 342

Cr.P.C., would not diminish its sanctity.

15. Under Section 97 PPC, every person has a

right subject to the restrictions contained in section 99 PPC

to defend his own body and the body of any other person

against any offence affecting the human body. Right of self

defence is recognized by law, but it is to be exercised if

circumstances so warrant. Every citizen is entitled to resist

attack and defend himself and his property when he or his

property is faced with danger and when immediately State

machinery is not readily available. Section 100 PPC

provides right of private defence where the assault could

either reasonable cause the apprehension of death, grievous

heart, rape, gratification of unnatural lust, kidnapping or

abduction or wrongful confinement. Principles are that

conduct of the accused during the whole transaction and

his presence at the spot should be bona fide, faultless and

devoid of elements of mens rea or actus reus, that there

19

should be a danger to the life of the accused or of grievous

bodily heart or a genuine apprehension to that effect that

the situation should be such that the accused is left with no

option of a safe exit.

16. Keeping in view the peculiar facts and

circumstances of the instant case discussed above, we are

firm in our view to hold the appellant was compelled to

exercise the right of self defence being in a state of panic,

keeping in view the assault of the complainant party, his

confrontation with his injured wife and strong danger and

apprehension to his life as well as the life of his wife. He

has not exceeded the limits while exercising the right of

self defence as nothing is on the record to prove second

shot on his part rather just to repel the attack of the

complainant party, he made a single shot, which

unfortunately, resulted in death of the deceased. The

appellant has not exceeded right of self defence, therefore,

20

his act does not fall within the ambit of any offence under

section 100 PPC.

17. Consequently, we while allowing both the

appeals, set aside the conviction and sentences of the

appellant recorded and awarded by the learned Trial Court

vide impugned judgments dated 19.11.2012, and hereby

acquit him of the charges leveled against him. He be set at

liberty forthwith, if not required in any other case.

18. These are reasons of our short order of even
date.
Announced.
