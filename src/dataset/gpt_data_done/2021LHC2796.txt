Appellant purchased plot No. 176 measuring
500 square yards situated at F-11/4, Islamabad
from Khan Afsar Khan (Pw-13). He made the
payment from joint account of him and his wife
No. 3921-2, ABL G-10 Markaz Islamabad. The
plot was transferred in the name of Sultan
Mehmood. Later on appellant sold the said
property to Mst. Rahat Ghafoor for a
consideration of Rs. 3.25 million in March,
2001. Its sale proceeds were deposited in the
joint account No. 5950-5, ABL G-10 Markaz
Islamabad that was a joint account of appellant
and his wife.

Appellant purchased plot No. 960, Sector G-
10/1 Islamabad in October, 1997 from
Muhammad Nazir for a consideration of 48200/-
US$ (Rs. 2123210/-). It was transferred in the
name of Mst. Anar Begum, the mother in law of
appellant. 32,000 US$ were paid through
cheque from the account of Sultan Mehmood
the brother in law of appellant and 16200 US$
were paid in cash. Thereafter, appellant
constructed a house on the said plot by spending
Rs.1.788 million.

Mst. Fozia Tariq (Pw-1) was the allottee of plot
No. 53, Sector G-11/2, Islamabad. In 1998
appellant purchased said plot for a consideration
of Rs. 26,00,000/- in the name of his wife
Ghulam Kalsoom where he constructed a house
by spending Rs. 2695024/-.

4. It was further asserted in complaint that all the bank accounts

except shown at Sr. No. | and 2 were opened in the year 1996 or 1997
while appellant was posted in NIH as Deputy Director Finance; in the said
accounts net credit entries of Rs. 9.937 million and US$ 3,15,542/-
respectively were made; if the conversation rate of US$ was taken to an
average of Rs. 40/- per dollar, amount of US$ 3,15,542/- in Pakistan
Rupees comes to 12,621,680/-. Hence, total currency was Rs.2,25 59,276/;
appellant received an amount of US$ 10,000/- in his account No. 5-
434686-107 City Bank, Karachi from contractor/supplier of NIH without
consideration; that the appellant did not declare his assets and he also did
not obtain permission from competent authority before sale and purchase

of the properties; the inherited property of appellant was only 2 Kanals and
Criminal Appeal No.1809-E of 2010 4

1 Marla; Sultan Mehmood brother in law of appellant was an illiterate and
poor man having a small baby cycle shop at Chakwal who was unable to
give any satisfactory explanation of his pecuniary resources in his bank
accounts whereas Maqsood Awan other brother in law of appellant was in
Saudi Arabia for the last ten years; from August 1994 to February 2001
appellant accumulated assets worth Rs. 2,25,59,276/- in his own name or
in the names of his wife and brothers in law disproportionate to his
legitimate and known sources of income which he could not reasonably
account for.

5. Ultimate version of NAB was that as appellant had committed the
offence of corruption and corrupt practices as defined in clause (v) of
Section 9 (A) of the Ordinance so he was liable to be punished under
Section 9 of the Ordinance and scheduled thereto.

6. It is important to add here that appellant during
inquiry/investigation was declared as a Proclaimed Offender and vide a
judgment dated 04.03.2004 passed by learned trial Court he was convicted
under Section 31-A of the Ordinance and sentenced to undergo three
years. He filed Criminal Appeal (8-E of 2006) in the Islamabad High
Court, Islamabad which was allowed vide a judgment dated 04.06.2009
and case was remanded to learned Trial Court.

7. On 06.08.2009 a charge under Section 10 read with 31-A of the
Ordinance was framed against appellant, who pleaded not guilty and
demanded his trial.

8. In support of its case prosecution had produced following
witnesses: -

No. 53 claimed that she had transferred the plot

produced declaration of assets of appellant.
Pw-22 Noreen Imran Manager City Bank,
Rawalpindi provided information about the

Pw-23 Mirza Muhammad Ashraf the Deputy
Director FIA is the investigating officer.
9. After prosecution’s evidence was closed, appellant was called for
his examination under Sections 342 Cr.P.C where entire incriminating
evidence was put to him. His ultimate version was that the assets were not
beyond his means; whatever the property was in his name that was from
his own income, and the amount which he received from his two brothers
in law settled abroad. Appellant did not opt to appear in terms of Section
340(2) Cr.P.C however he produced his brother in law Muhammad Ayyub
(Dw-1) and Muhammad Magqsood (Dw-2). He also came in witness box as
Dw-3.
10. Muhammad Ayyub (Dw-1) brother in law of appellant maintained
that he used to send money to appellant from abroad through different
people; he also sent the money to appellant through banks; purpose of
transferring the money to appellant was that they had joint family
business of property.
11. Muhammad Magsood (Dw-2) also maintained that he had been
working in Saudi Arabia from 1995 to 2008 and he used to send money to
appellant for joint family business of property.
12. Appellant as Dw-3 also claimed that in 1994 he was posted as
Deputy Director Finance in NIH; he was having no financial power in his
job description where he remained till 1997; he was doing part time joint
family business of sale purchase and construction along with his brothers
in law; in 1997 he proceeded on long leave till 23.02.2001; his brothers in
law were working in Saudi Arabia who used to send him money through
different channels which was used in the business and profit had to be
distributed proportionately.
13. Learned counsel for appellant contended that the accounts shown at

serial No. 1, 2 and 3 are in the name of appellant whereas account shown
Criminal Appeal No.1809-E of 2010 7

at serial No. 4 and 9 were joint with his wife and for remaining accounts
appellant had no concern; only credit entries have been shown and there is
no balance sheet of any of the accounts produced by prosecution;
accounts were spread over couple of years having small negligible
balance in the end which was seized by the NAB; certain amounts have
been counted more than once which shows poor performance of the NAB;
the assessment of plot No. 53 was made on prevailing market average for
the year 2002 and not the one when it was purchased; prosecution in all
circumstances had to prove the factum of misuse of authority or act of
corruption in order to constitute the offence for which it was completely
failed; mere possession of pecuniary resources of properties by itself does
not constitute an offence; the decision of the case had to be on the basis of
evidence and not on surmises and conjectures; there is no evidence with
the prosecution to establish the element of misuse of authority or any
other corrupt practices whereby the appellant accumulated the money of
his own benefit or built up the property through malpractices; appellant
was abroad and in his absence his wife provided all documents without
fail; the investigating officer conducted dishonest investigation, who did
not make an attempt to know all legitimate sources of income of
appellant; appellant joined the service in 1974 as a clerk and on the basis
of his hard work, he was promoted to BS-19 and during the service he
also went to UK, Singapore and Morocco where he lived a simple life and
saved considerable amount; brother in laws of appellant were admittedly
abroad since long and sending the money by them to their sister and
appellant was not an abnormality. He finally maintained that as
prosecution could not prove the allegations against appellant, therefore,
the conviction recorded by learned Trial Court cannot sustain.

14. On the other hand, learned Special Prosecutor for NAB argued that
in a case where there are allegations against a public servant of his living
beyond his means, the prosecution has to only prove on record his those
assets and immediately thereafter the onus is shifted to accused to prove
contrary and to account for satisfactorily; bank accounts produced by

prosecution are showing abnormal transactions and he was the only
Criminal Appeal No.1809-E of 2010 8

appellant who could furnish explanation in this regard but he was
completely failed; wife and mother in law of appellant were possessed
with no independent source of income therefore, appellant was under
heavy duty to show that he had no concern with those properties and that
his wife and mother in law were in a position to purchase said properties;
appellant also remained absconder when he proceeded abroad and did not
return therefore, his conduct is quite relevant and can be validly taken into
consideration in favour of prosecution. He finally contended that on the
basis of well reasoned judgment appellant has been rightly convicted by
the learned Trial Court.

15. HEARD

16. The learned Law Officer while referring Section 14(C) of the
Ordinance repeatedly contended that as presumption is against appellant
therefore, he has to account for in all circumstances about the assets those

which he had acquired. We do not find so, because on this proposition the

principles are absolute. In ‘Pir Mazhar ul Haq and others vs. The State
through Chief Ehtsab Commissioner Islamabad PLD 2005 SC _ 63’ it

was held as under: -

“In criminal cases the general rule is that the
accused must always be presumed to be innocent
and the onus of proving everything essential to the
establishment of the offence is on the prosecution.
All that may be necessary for the accused is to offer
some explanations of the prosecution evidence and
if this appears to be reasonable even though not
beyond doubt and to be consistent with the
innocence of the accused, he should be given the
benefit of it. The proof of case against accused must
depend for its support not upon the absence or want
to any explanation on the part of accused but upon
the positive and affirmative evidence of the guilt
that is led by the prosecution to substantiate
accusation. There is no cavil with the proposition
and judicial consensus seems to be that “if on the
facts proved no hypothesis consistent with the
innocence of the accused can be suggested, the
conviction must be upheld. If however, such facts
can be reconcile with any reasonable hypothesis
compatible with the innocence of the accused the
case will have to be treated as one of no evidence
and the conviction and the sentence will in that case
have to be quashed ”
Criminal Appeal No.1809-E of 2010 9

17. In ‘Khan Asfandyar Wali vs. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2001
SC 607 it was observed by honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan: -

“Be that as it may, the prosecution has to establish
the preliminary facts whereafter the onus shifted
and the defence is called upon to disprove the
presumption. This is also the consistent stand taken
by Mr. Abid Hassan Minto as well as the learned
Attorney General who adopted his arguments. This
interpretation appears to be reasonable in the
context of the background of the NAB Ordinance
and the rational of promulgating the same
notwithstanding the phraseology used therein. We
are also of the view that the above provisions do not
constitute a bill of attainer, which factually means
that by legislative action an accused is held guilty
and punishable. For safer dispensation of justice
and in the interest of good governance, efficiency in
the administrative and organizational setup, we
deem it necessary to issue the following directions
for effective operation of Section 14 (D).

(1) The prosecution shall first make out a
reasonable case against the accused charged
under Section 9(A) (VI and VID) of the NAB

(2) In case the prosecution succeeds in making
out a reasonable case to the satisfaction of
the Accountability Court, the prosecution
would be deemed to have discharged the
prima face burden of proof then the burden
of proof shall shift to the accused to rebut the
presumption of guilt”

18. Appellant has been convicted under Section 9(a)(v) read with
Section 10 and 31-A of the Ordinance. Taking into consideration his
conviction under Section 31-A of the Ordinance, which relates to
absconding to avoid the service of warrants, we have observed that the
only witness produced in this context by prosecution, is Abdul Majeed
Inspector (Pw-17) to whom non bailable warrants of arrest were entrusted
and he made the report accordingly. There is a difference between non-
appearance by avoiding the process of law and absconding. As
absconding, under the Ordinance, attracts the penal consequences
therefore prosecution must prove that the warrant was issued; a serious
effort was made for execution of warrant; statement of process server was

recorded by the Court; the Court thereafter was satisfied and it issued the
Criminal Appeal No.1809-E of 2010 10

proclamations in terms of Section 87 CrP.C and finally that the
proclamations so issued were duly executed and in this context statement
of process server was also recoded and then the Court being satisfied had
declared the accused as a Proclaimed Offender. Prosecution in this case
did not produce the officer to whom any proclamation was entrusted. In
these circumstances, we are compelled to hold that the absconding of
appellant in this case has not been proved by the prosecution and at the
most before us, we can say, it was a long disappearance on the part of
appellant. But said disappearance was not unlawful as it has been
established from prosecution’s evidence that appellant was abroad
pursuant to approval of Ex-Pakistan leave for three years by the
competent Authority.

19. Reverting our discussion to the conviction of appellant under
Section 9(a)(v) read with Section 10 of the Ordinance, we have observed
that only house No. 53, G-11/2 Islamabad has been forfeited besides
imprisonment and fine. In the complaint case of prosecution was
somewhat different. It was alleged that he purchased plot No. 176, F-11/4,
Islamabad in the name of his brother in law Sultan Mehmood for a
consideration of Rs. 3.25 million; he also purchased plot No. 960 in
Sector G-10/1 Islamabad in the name of his brother in law Sultan
Mehmood for a consideration of US$ 32000/-. So it means that to the
extent of purchase of plot No. 176, F-11/4 and plot No. 960, G-10/1
Islamabad, prosecution story has been disbelieved by the learned Trial
Court. Our observations get support from an important fact. After the case
was decided by the learned Trial Court, a caution was imposed by the
NAB on House No. 960 Street 26 Sector G-10/1, Islamabad. Mst. Anar
Begum, mother in law of appellant, who was also alleged as ‘Benamidar’,
filed a writ petition (1456 of 2011) in this Court challenging the action of
imposition of caution by maintaining that appellant had nothing to do with
that property. This Court while accepting the writ petition had observed as
under: -

“The final judgment revealed that House No. 960,
Street No. 26, Sector G-10/1, Islamabad, about
which caution notice was issued, was not forfeited
Criminal Appeal No.1809-E of 2010 11

in favour of the State. This shows that the
allegations levelled in the reference that this house
belongs to accused/convict and he has procured the
same through illegal means of corrupt practice was
not accepted. The learned ADPG, NAB, was asked
on 16.10.2012 to report if NAB has filed any appeal
against the said judgment. He has _ today
categorically stated that the judgment dated
29.06.2010 was not assailed by NAB although the
house in question was not confiscated to the State.
After conclusion of trial, this house cannot be kept
under caution. The judgment passed by learned
Judge, Accountability Court No III, has attained
finality. In the said judgment this house was not
forfeited so it cannot be kept under caution. The
petitioner being its owner has right to deal with it
as desired”
20. Therefore, we find no difficulty to hold that prosecution was
unsuccessful to establish many of the allegations leveled against appellant
in the reference. By not challenging the judgment of trial Court
prosecution is facing a serious challenge that how the impugned judgment
can be defended when most of the allegations have not been proved. The
principles to prove a case which we have referred earlier make the
position clear that prosecution must come before the Court in a fair and
transparent manner with the evidence that meets the requirements of
credibility. If the evidence is not credible, its reliability cannot be
demanded by the prosecution from the Court.
21. Therefore, now prosecution’s case is to the extent of Plot/House
No. 53, G-11/2 Islamabad that it was beyond the known sources of the
means of appellant. At this juncture we will also like to observe that in
view of the position discussed above now prosecution cannot ask to look
into the bank accounts of brother in laws and mother in law of the
appellant.
22. Statement of Dr. Muhammad Mumtaz Ali Raza (Pw-21), the
Section Officer of assets of Establishment division is very important for
us. He had brought the assets declaration of appellant and according to
those declarations the appellant had declare his assets as under: -

I. House and agricultural land in village Sakral
Chakwal valuing six lacs jointly owned by his
brother which was inherited property.
Criminal Appeal No.1809-E of 2010 12

Il. 800 CC Suzuki Car valuing one lac which he
had purchased.

Il. Jewelry gold valuing Rs.20000/- that was
inherited and purchased.

IV. Household goods. valuing Rs.100000/- that was
inherited and purchased.

V. Plot No. 53, G-11/2 Islamabad purchased for
Rs.9,00,000/-

VI. Personal loan Rs.1500,000/-.

23. How prosecution can say that appellant had not shown plot No. 53,
G-11/2, Islamabad in his assets declaration. Once this plot was declared in
assets declaration, it means that it was purchased with the approval of
competent Authority.

24.  Athar Saeed Dil (Pw-9) had brought the record from NIH and in
cross-examination he admitted that appellant had availed house loan and
car loan from the department and he was returning said loans in
installments on the basis of deduction from his salary.

25. Prosecution could not bring on record any evidence that in the job
description of appellant he ever remained connected with any financial
affairs so it cannot be claimed also that appellant made any corruption
during his long service.

26. An investigating officer is the most important witness in a case.
Prosecution had produced Mirza Muhammad Ashraf Deputy Director
(Pw-23) but he had conducted the investigation when appellant was not in
the field. The main investigating officer of the case was Niaz Ahmad
Assistant Director FIA who was given up by the prosecution on the reason
that he had died. In this regard there was only a report of process server,
who was never examined to confirm this fact. Even the learned trial Court
did not find it necessary to verify the death of Niaz Ahmad Assistant
Director FIA. For the sake of arguments, if it is believed that Niaz Ahmad
was no more in this world, the prosecution was under obligation to prove
his investigation to the extent of documents which he prepared through
secondary evidence. Even this request was not made. It is settled principle
of law that in case of non-production of investigating officer who is a

material witness, the conviction cannot sustain. ‘(Bashir Ahmad &
Criminal Appeal No.1809-E of 2010 13

another vs. The State & others 2019S CMR 1417)’

27. We have already observed that keeping in view special features of
this case there is no need to discuss that if the brothers in law and mother
in law of the appellant were ‘Benamidar’ as to their extent the other
properties have not been forfeited. In this background the statements of
Muhammad Ayyub (Dw-1) and Muhammad Magqsood (Dw-2) have
earned a great value because appellants’ version throughout was that his
two brothers in law were abroad from where they used to send the money
to him. It is also on record that appellant remained for a period of three
years in Canada so his version to have the savings cannot be thrown out
from consideration. In view of the principles which we have discussed
earlier about presumption, the appellant was under obligation to offer a
reasonable explanation although not beyond doubt. The word
‘reasonable’ does not mean that appellant has to prove his innocence by
producing the evidence of high quality or at the same yardstick which is
for the prosecution. It simply means ‘something that is logical and exhibits
good sense’.

28. Concluding what we have deliberated above, we hold that
prosecution has badly failed to prove its case beyond shadow of doubt
against appellant therefore this appeal is allowed. Impugned judgment
dated 29.06.2010 passed by the learned Trial Court is set aside. Appellant
is acquitted from the case. He is on bail. His surety is discharged from

terms and conditions of bail bonds.
