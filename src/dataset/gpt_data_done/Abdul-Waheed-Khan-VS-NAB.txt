ORDER

SYED ARSHAD ALI, _J:- By invoking the constitutional
jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199 of the
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the
Constitution), petitioner Abdul Waheed Khan, who is
behind the bars since 25.10.2016, in consequence of a
Reference No.14 of 2016, initiated by the National
Accountability Bureau (NAB) qua offence of cheating the
members of the public at large and depriving them from
their hard earned money on the pretext of payment of
exorbitant profit by investment in their business, seeks his
release on bail.

2. Accusations against the petitioner are that he along
with his brother/ co-accused Abid Nadeem (the Proprietor
of Allied International Money), having a business with the
name and style of M/S Allied International Money
Changer, Franchise currency booth, CNG _ Stations,
Exchange Company Pvt Ltd, situated in shop No.7 Feroze

Centre, behind Usmania Restaurant Blue Area, Islamabad,
2

fraudulently and dishonestly lured/induced/persuaded the
members of the public at large to invest money in their
business on a promise that they would be paid an
exorbitant profit, but neither any profit was paid to the
affectees nor was their principal amount returned. On the
complaints of the affectees twelve in number to NAB, an
inquiry was authorized by the DG NAB and on
confirmation of the allegations, was converted into
investigation and on completion of investigation, reference
was filed against the petitioner and his co-accused before
the learned Accountability Court, Peshawar, which is
pending trial.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record perused with their able assistance.

4. The accusations against the petitioner fall within
the mischief of section 9 (ix) and 9 (x) of the National
Accountability Ordinance, 1999 (the Ordinance),
punishment of which has been provided under section 10
of the Ordinance. However, before dialing upon the merits
of the case qua determination of prima facie complicity of
the petitioner in the commission of offence or otherwise, it
would be advantageous to first understand the true spirit of
section 9 (ix) and 9 (x) of the Ordinance and the intent of
the legislature behind its enactment, hence, for the sake of
convenience, we would like to reproduce the same as

under:-
“9, Corruption and Corrupt practices:

(a)A holder of a public Office, or any other
person, is said to commit or to have committed
the offence of corruption and corrupt practices:-

(ix) If he commits the offence of cheating as

defined in section 415 of the Pakistan Penal

Code, 1860 (Act XLV of 1960), and thereby

dishonestly induces members of the public at

large to deliver any property including money

or valuable security to any person; or

(x) if he commits the offence of criminal breach

of trust as defined in section 405 of the Pakistan

Penal Code, 1860 (Act XLV of 1860) with

regard to any property including money or

valuable security entrusted to him by members

of the public at large;”
5. The bare reading of section 9 of the Ordinance
depicts that cheating per-se is a crime under the Pakistan
Penal Code, but to attract the provisions of section 9 of the
Ordinance and to enable the NAB to assume jurisdiction in
the matter, the element of “inducing the members of the
public at large” is sine qua none so as to constitute the
offence under the Ordinance ibid. In this case, though the
NAB has taken cognizance on the basis of complaints of
various persons/affectees, but a look over the stance of the
affectees would reveal they have not denied their business

relation with the petitioner from a particular period of time

so much so that some of them have admitted the receipt of
4

profit in the business at the hands of the petitioner for a
considerable period. The grievance of the affectees is that
later on, the petitioner stopped the profit and refused to
return their principal amount too. At this juncture, I will
refer to the final Investigation Report, wherein some of the
affectees, namely, Sarwar Khan, Ghulam Muhammad,
Mian M.Akram and M.Alam Khan, have received rupees 9
million, 3 lacs, 02 millions and 4 Million, respectively, as
profit in the business.
6. We would also refer to cheating which has been
defined under section 415 PPC in the following words:-

“415.Cheating. Whoever, by deceiving any

person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces

the person so deceived to deliver any property

to any person, or to consent that any person

shall retain any property or intentionally

induce the person so deceived to do or omit to

do anything which he would not do or omit if

he were not so deceived, and which act or

omission causes or is likely to cause damage

or harm to that person (or any other person) in

body, mind, reputation or property, is said to

“cheat”.
7. Bare reading of section 415 PPC depicts that
unless it is established that the accused at the time of
inducing the person to invest with him had the intention
not to return the amount, the offence of cheating cannot be
said to have been committed, rather such eventualities may
lead to a civil obligation. If at any time, during trial or
subsequent period the accused refuses to pay the amount or

showed his inability to make the payment would not attract

the provision of section 415 PPC. Similarly, inability to
5

pay the outstanding liabilities may lead to certain
consequence under the Civil Law, as inability to pay, and
receiving investment with the intention not to re-pay, is
two different concepts, having different consequences. In
case titled, “Muhammad Alauddin Vs the State” (PLD
1959 Dacca 88), the Hon’ble Dacca High Court while
dealing with similar situation has held as under:-

“In order to constitute cheating it must be

established that someone is made to part with

some property on the promise of another to

return something in lieu thereof which the

latter had no intention to give. The initial

intention to deceive, therefore, must be

established in order to justify conviction for

cheating. The mere fact that the accused deny

transaction at the trial and refuse to return the

money does not necessarily show that they had

a criminal intent from the beginning. Their

denial may merely amount to the usual

mistaken attempt to protect themselves from

the result of the prosecution.”
8. Similarly, to constitute the offence of criminal
breach of trust, the element of entrustment of property or
money which is dishonestly misappropriated or disposed in
violation of any direction prescribed by law or the mode in
which such trust was to be discharged or in the context of
any contract etc, however, in an arrangement when one
person receives money or investment from another person
for carrying on business, this transaction per se will not
attract the entrustment of property as provided under
section 405 PPC, even if the said money received for a

particular business is invested or utilized for some other

purposes. In case titled, “Shahid Imran Vs the State and
6

another” (2011 SCMR 1614), it has been held by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court that:-
“The law clearly recognizes a distinction
between payment/investment of money and
entrustment of money or property as in the
former case the amount of money paid or
invested is to be utilized for some purpose
whereas in the later case that sum of money or
property is to be retained and preserved for its
return to the giver and the same is never
meant to be utilized for any other purpose..a
mere breach of a promise, agreement or
contract does not ipso facto attract the
definition of criminal breach of trust
contained in section 405 PPC and such a
breach is nor synonymous with criminal
breach of trust without there being a clear
case of entrustment”.
9. The material collected so far by the Investigating
Agency transpires that the twelve claimants/affectees have
either invested their amount in the business or have paid
money to the petitioner for a particular purpose. The
business of the petitioner in the shape of running CNG
Stations in various cities of the country, real Estate and
Money exchange, has not been denied either by the
prosecution or the affectees. On the face of record, it was
due to liquidity crush that petitioner remained unable to
repay the amount invested with him. In view of the above
circumstances, the dishonest intention of the petitioner to
induce the affectees fraudulently and dishonest so as to
deceive them, which are sine qua non for constituting the
offence, is yet to be determined during trial after recording

evidence, however, at the moment this aspect of the case

makes the case of the petitioner arguable for the purpose of
7

bail. Even otherwise in order to attract the provision of
section 9 of the Ordinance, and the NAB to assume
jurisdiction in the matter, it must be establish that infact
the public at large was dishonestly and fraudulently
induced to make investment with the intention not to repay
the same amount. Besides, the number of the
affectees/claimants in this case is twelve which does not
fall within the meaning of public at large in light of ratio of
judgment of the Hon’ble Apex Court in case titled, “Rafiq
Haji Usman Vs Chairman NAB and another” (2015
SCMR 1575). The relevant part of the judgment in this
report is reproduced below:-

“We are of the view that 13 persons would
hardly constitute Public in its literal and
ordinary sense; further more meaning of the
word large i.e. “considerable or relatively
great size, extent or capacity having wide
range and scope” does not bring 22 or 13
person as the case may be within its
concept and fold. Thus from this angle as
well as the said section seemingly perhaps
can be held not attracted to the instant case.
It is trite law that the provisions of law
which constitute criminal offences shall be
strictly constructed and applied, thus prima
facie we have not been persuaded by the
plea made by the learned Deputy
Prosecutor General that in such a case
section 9 (x) ibid shall be attracted.”

10. For what has been discussed above. This petition is
allowed.
11. These are the reasons for our short order of even

date which read as under:-

“For the reasons to be recorded later, this
writ petition for bail is allowed. Accused-
8

petitioner Abdul Waheed Khan son of
Mosam khan is admitted to bail provided
he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of
rupees ten millions (10.00 million) with
two sureties each in the like amount to
the satisfaction of learned Trial Court,
who shall ensure that the sureties are
local, reliable and men of means.”
