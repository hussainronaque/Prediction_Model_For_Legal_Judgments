ORDER

MANZOOR AHMAD MALIK, J. At the very outset, learned
counsel for the petitioner contends that he will not press this petition if the learned
trial Court is directed to decide the case in the shortest possible time as the
petitioner intends to raise the question as to whether the chemical/substance
allegedly recovered from him is a controlled substance or not within the purview
of Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997. The request made by the learned
counsel for the petitioner is reasonable. Learned Special Prosecutor has no
objection to the issuance of such direction. Therefore, the instant criminal petition
is disposed of as having not been pressed with a direction to the learned trial
Court seized of the trial of the petitioner to ensure the conclusion of trial of this
case within a period of three months from the receipt of this order, strictly in

accordance with law.
