JUDGMENT
MUHAMMAD IJAZ KHAN, J.- This order
is directed to decide the appeal filed by
appellant namely Bilal Ahmad against the
judgment of his conviction and sentence dated
12.10.2021 passed by the learned Sessions
Judge Malakand at Batkhela.
2. As per contents of FIR
complainant Naik Rehman, Post Commander
of Levy Post Hassan Khan Shaheed,
Alladhand along with other levy official laid a
barricade at Alladhand road near Sharab Dara

when in the meanwhile they stopped a

motorcar bearing No. 6432/Police coming

NAWAB (S.8) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
from Amandara side. Driver of the car
disclosed his name as Bilal Ahmad (the
appellant herein), while the person sitting in
its front seat has been identified as Shakeel
Ahmad. During search of the motorcar, the
levy officials recovered a white colour plastic
lying beneath the front seat on mate which
contained five packets of Chars total weighing
6000 grams, regarding which a separate FIR
No. 84 dated 12.09.2020 under section 9 (d) of
The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic
Substances Act 2019 has been registered at
Levy Post Alladhand District Malakand.
Further search of the accused/ appellant
namely Bilal Ahmad led to recovery of three
service cards of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Police Department. The appellant was arrested
on the spot and the motorcar was also taken in
possession. ‘Murasila’ was drafted which was
reduced into FIR No. 84 dated 12.09.2020
registered under sections 420, 468, 473 PPC at

Levy Post Alladhand District Malakand.

NAWAB (S.8) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
3. The accused was summoned by
the learned trial Court and charge was framed
against him, to which he pleaded not guilty
and claimed trial. The prosecution was invited
to produce its evidence, who accordingly
examined five (05) witnesses in support of
their case. Thereafter, statement of accused
was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C and on
conclusion of trial in the case, the
accused/appellant was convicted vide the
impugned order/judgment dated 12.10.2021 of
the Court of learned Sessions Judge Malakand
at Batkhela and was sentenced as follows;

“Under sections 420,468,471 PPC to
three years rigorous imprisonment
along with fine of Rs. 50,000/- (fifty
thousand), or in default thereof he
was ordered to undergo six months
simple imprisonment. The appellant
was also extended benefit of section
382-B Cr.P.C.

The appellant has now challenged
the aforesaid judgment by filing the instant
criminal appeal before this Court.

4, Arguments of learned counsel for
the appellant as well as learned Astt: A.G.

appearing on behalf of the State were heard in

NAWAB (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
2

considerable detail and the record perused
with their able assistance.

5. At the very outset it may be noted
that the evidence produced by the prosecution
in both set of allegations i.e. recovery of Chars
and recovery of forged service cards are
verbatim copy of each other and as such their
evidence qua the present set of allegation is to
be analyzed as under;-

6. It is the case of prosecution that
since the appellant namely Bilal Ahmad has
fixed a police number plate on his motorcar in
which he was boarded at the relevant time and
as the three service cards of the Police
Department were recovered from his pocket,
therefore, he has committed the offences
under sections 420, 468 and 473 PPC.

7. Before appreciating the evidence
it would be relevant to mention here that what
are the essential ingredients to constitute an

offence under sections 420, 468, 473 PPC;-

NAWAB {S.8) Mr, Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
An offence under section 420
PPC could be constituted when a person has
dishonestly induced another person;-

(i) To deliver any property to any person or;
(ii) To make, alter or destroy;
(a) The whole or any part of a valuable
security or;
(b) Anything which is signed or sealed
and which is capable of being converted
into a valuable security.

Similarly to constitute an offence
under section 468 PPC the prosecution has to
prove;-

(i) That the document is a forgery;

(ii) That the accused forged the document;

(iii) That he did as above intending that the
Jorged document would be used for the
purpose of cheating.

and the ingredients of section 473
PPC are;

(i) That the accused made or counterfeit the
seal, plate, etc., or that he had such seal
etc., in his possession, and he knew it to
be counterfeit;

(ii) That such seal, etc., was made in order
to produce impressions;

(iii) That he intended to use such seal, etc.,
for the purpose of committing forgery;

(iv) That such forger was punishable under
section 467.

8. Now keeping in view the

aforesaid essential ingredients for commission

NAWAB (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
of offences levied against the appellant the
prosecution has to prove that the appellant has
deceived them for delivery of any property or
part of it, however, it is not at all the case of
prosecution, even such nature of allegations
were not leveled by it what to say about the
proof of it. Similarly, prosecution is bound to
prove that what documents have been forged
by the appellant. It is an admitted fact that the
appellant is a police personal and he was
having service cards of Police Department
which were sent for verification and the same
were found as genuine, so, except allegation
prosecution has not brought on record any
evidence to substantiate their charge.
Similarly, prosecution has also to prove that
which counterfeit number plate has been made
by the appellant. It is the case of prosecution

that the appellant has affixed a number plate

NAWAB ($.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad ljaz Khan
7

of Police Department on his motorcar, which
is in a broader sense is not a counterfeit
number plate as the appellant is an employee
of Police Department and as such the
allegation would have at the most attract the
provision of section 473 PPC, had the
appellant not been an employee of Police
Department. It may be an offence under The
Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1965 but in no
way would attract the provision of section 473
PPC to the case of appellant.

9, It is and has been an admitted
fact that the appellant namely Bilal Ahmad is
an employee of the Police Department and
posted at the office of C.P.O Peshawar and
that his two out of the three service cards
recovered from him were verified during the
course of investigation and were found

genuine, therefore, in such eventuality when

NAWAB (8.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad jjaz Khan
the appellant is admittedly an employee of the
Police Department and when he was having
his service cards in his pocket then one fails
to understand that how he has committed an
offence as stated hereinabove. These
allegations should have been carrying some
weight had the appellant not been an
employee of the Police Department and he has
personated to be an employee. The service
cards recovered from him reflects his
designation as constable and computer
operator respectively. It was admitted by the
learned Astt: A.G. at the bar that the appellant
was initially appointed as a constable in the
Police Department, however, when he was
literate in computer, therefore, he was posted
at C.P.O Peshawar office as a computer
operator, therefore, all the cards recovered

from him bearing his correct designation i.e.

NAWAB (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad jaz Khan
of constable and computer operator and as
such on this score too, the service cards so
recovered from the appellant are genuine and
correct qua the factual position of his
designation and Department.

10. Similarly, fixing of a police
number plate on the motorcar which was
given to him on ‘Superdari’ too is not a false,
forged or counterfeit number plate as the
appellant is an employee of the Police
Department, however, fixing of such a
number plate on the motorcar may be an
offence under The Motor Vehicles Ordinance,
1965, which is not the case of prosecution but
by no stretch of imagination the provision of
section 473 PPC could be attracted, therefore,
on this score too the allegation made by the

prosecution appears to be misconceived and

NAWAB (8.8) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
does not constitute an offence within the
meaning of section 473 PPC.

11. As stated above that the appellant
is and was an employee of the Police
Department and even if the allegations made
by the prosecution are considered to be
correct the applicability of section 420 PPC
could not be attracted against the appellant as
it is not the case of prosecution that he has
dishonestly induced them for the delivery of
any property. Similarly, section 468 PPC too
could not be attracted against the appellant as
he has not committed any forgery for the
purpose of cheating. As stated above that all
his service cards and number plate reflect the
true position that he is an employee of the
Police Department, therefore, in such state of
affairs, it can safely be concluded that the

appellant has not at all committed an offence,

NAWAB ($.8) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-ll-

which may attract the penal provision of
sections 420, 468 and 473 PPC.

12. The statements of the PWs
recorded in this FIR as well as in the
connected FIR No. 84 dated 12.09.2020 are
the verbatim/ photo-state copies of each other
and all the PWs have not uttered a single word
that the appellant has either induced them for
the delivery of any property or that he has
committed any forgery to cheat them or he has
prepared any counterfeit plate/seal etc. as
during the course of investigation and the trial
all their allegations are turned out to be false,
therefore, in such state of affairs the impugned
conviction and sentence of the appellant could
not be sustained.

13. In view of the above, the case of
prosecution is misconceived qua the true
factual position with respect to official

position of the appellant being employee of

NAWAB. (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-12-

Police Department and his service cards and
police number plate affixed on his motorcar,
therefore, he is entitled for the lapses in the
prosecution evidence. It is not essential that
there should be many doubts in the
prosecution case, even a single doubt is
sufficient to extend its benefit to an accused
person as it is the cardinal principle of
criminal administration of justice that let
hundred guilty persons be acquitted but one
innocent person should not be convicted. In
the case of “Tariq Pervaiz v/s The State”

reported as 1995 SCMR_ 1345 , the Hon’ble

Apex Court has held that the concept of benefit
of doubt to an accused person is deep-rooted in
our country. For giving him benefit of doubt, it
is not necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating doubts. If there is a
circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in
a prudent mind about the guilt of the accused,
then the accused will be entitled to the benefit .
not as a matter of grace and concession but as a

matter of right. Reliance in this behalf can be

NAWAB (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad ljaz Khan
Nee

-13-

made upon the cases of “Muhammad Zamin

W/s The State & others” (2014 SCMR 749),

and Muhammad Akram v. The State (2009
SCMR 230). In the case of “Ghulam Oadir

& others v/s The State” reported as 2008

SCMR 1221 the Hon’ble Apex Court has also
held that it needs no reiteration that for the
purpose of giving benefit of doubt to an
accused person, more than one infirmity is
not required, a single infirmity creating
reasonable doubt in the mind of a reasonable
and prudent mind regarding the truth of the
charge-makers the whole case doubtful.
Merely because the burden is on the accused
to prove his innocence it does not absolve the
prosecution from its duty to prove its case
against the accused beyond any shadow of
doubt end this duty does not change or vary
in the case. A finding of guilt against an
accused person cannot be based merely on
the high probabilities that may be inferred

from evidence in a given case.

NAWAB (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-14-

14, For what has been discussed
above, this Court is of the firm view that the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove its
case against the accused/appellant beyond
reasonable doubt; therefore, his conviction
and sentence cannot be maintained.
Resultantly, while extending him the benefit
of the doubt, this appeal is allowed and the
impugned order/judgment of conviction and
sentence dated 12.10.2021 recorded by the
learned trial Court is set aside and
consequently the appellant is acquitted of the
all charges levelled against him. He be
released forthwith from the Jail, if not

required in any other case.

15. These are reasons for my short order

of even date.
