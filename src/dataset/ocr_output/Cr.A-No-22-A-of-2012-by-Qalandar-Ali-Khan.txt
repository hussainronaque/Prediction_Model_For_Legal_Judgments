3. The facts, as narrated in the FIR,
are that on 40.06.2010 at 02.00 AM,
Muhammad Iqbal Khan, ASHO PS Oghi,
while on patrol duty received information about
shifting of an injured to Civil Hospital, Oghi,
whereupon he reached’ there, where
Muhammad Riaz son of Ali Muhammad,
resident of Hari Gah, in injured condition,
accompanied by Anwar Khan, lodged report of
the occurrence that he came to Oghi bazaar in
connection with some private matter and while
on his way back to home, reached in front of
the house of Sher Bahadur son of Kala in
village Maira Kalan at about 23.30 hours. it

was dark and he called Sher Bahadur by asking
him for a torch. Meanwhile, Khawas son of
Ghulam Rasool, appellant/accused, cn BU
there and asked him as to why he came ow L_/
their village at night time, and fired at him
with 30 bore pistol from close range, as a
result whereof, he sustained injuries on his
abdomen and back and fell down. On his
alarm, Khawas decamped from the spot.
He informed Anwar Khan, his relative, on

¢ mobile phone, who came to the spot and
hifted him to the hospital. He stated that
there was no previous enmity; and charged
the  appellant/accused, Khawas, for
attempting at his life. The report was
recorded in the shape of ‘Murasila’
(Ex.PA/1) and the case was registered

9. Arguments of the learned counsel for
the appellant, learned State counsel assisted
by learned counsel for the legal heirs of
deceased/complainant heard, and _ record
perused with their assistance.

10. The entire prosecution case hinges on
the so-called dying declaration of the
complainant, which was incorporated in
Murasila (Ex.PA/1), reduced into writing by
Muhammad Iqbal Khan, Additional SHO
(PW-1). It may be observed at the very outset
that despite presence of PW Anwar Khan as
shown in the F.I.R at the time of lodging of
report by deceased Muhammad Riaz, then
injured, he did not sign / thumb impress the
report as -. rider. Likewise, no report of the
Medical Officer was obtained on the Murasila
showing the complainant fully conscious and

capable of making the report, in order to lend

sy,
credence to the report as a dying declaration.
Although the Medica! Officer (PW-2), later nhoy
tried to cover the deficiency / omission by
reporting on the injury sheet that the patient
was in shock but could talk consciously; but
the belated report of the Medical Officer would
hardly make up the deficiency / omission
when: neither there is a certificate by the
Medical Officer in support of the dying
declaration nor even presence of the Medical
' Officer at the time of report by the deceased,
hen injured, is established. The presence of
the Medical Officer at the relevant time is not
proved; as he stated that he was present in
the hospital when the injured was brought
there, but Muhammad Iqbal Khan, Additional
SHO (PW-1) categorically stated that the
doctor was not present at the time of report
and that the hospital staff told him that doctor
had been informed and further that he was
about to reach the hospital. He, however,
admitted that the doctor did not reach the
hospital in his presence, though,

Jeshawa. yn Court
Asbottaved Bench
auinonized Unger Seca75 Acts Ordarns
according to the PW, it might have taken him
30/45 minutes in drafting the Murasila and / Li/
preparing the injury sheet. Needless to say tO)
that the deceased, then injured; was under
shock, as he was seriously injured, and the
wound had been bleeding, as reported by the
Medical Officer, obviously, after the
occurrence at 23.30 hours on 09.06.2010 till
his medical examination at 02.10 AM on
10.06.2010, thus creating further doubt about
the capability of the deceased to remain
conscious and lodge report, giving therein
graphic details of the occurrence. In such a
situation, the so-called dying declaration was
to be accepted for the purpose of holding the
convict-appellant guilty of the offence, with
great care and caution, especially when
maker of the dying declaration is not
subjected to cross-examination.(2015 YLR-
624), (2015 MLD 690), (1999 P.Cr.L.J 707),

11. Being conscious of the onerous duty
of taking the so-called dying declaration with
care and caution, one also feels obliged to
look into the intrinsic value of the report of the
deceased (then injured). The deceased
alleged in his report that he had gone to Oghi
bazaar in connection with his personal work
and was returning home from Oghi bazaar
<.! and reached Maria Kalan at night time, i.e.
141.30 pm, and asked Sher Bahadur whose
house was situated on the road side for a
torch and in the meantime, Khawas, the
convict-appellant, reached there and asked
him about his presence in their village at night
time and then fired at him with his 30 bore
pistol from a close range, causing him injury
on abdomen and back side. The story
narrated in the FIR does not appeal to
common sense for multiple reasons. Firstiy,

midnight ie. 11.30 pm and asking SKer L oO
Bahadur, who was not present in his house, | 7 /
nor were his other family member except Mst.
Zakria. The statement of the deceased to the
effect that house of Sher Bahadur was
situated on the road side is not only belied by
the record but also by the site plan showing
the house situated on a path leading to the
house from the main road. The demand of
torch by the deceased from the house of Sher
Bahadur at midnight, when other inmates of
the house were not present and when there
were other houses nearby as well as on the
road from Oghi bazaar to the village, many
more pertinent questions were left
unanswered, more so,when the !.0 expressed
in his case diary dated 12.12.2010, brought on
record, suspecting intimate relationship
between the deceased and PW Zakria Bibi,
and the fact further augmented by twenty four
calls made by PW Zakria Bibi from her cell

side. é (
12. The FIR showed _ the decease © /
standing near the door outside the house, but
the site plan, prepared on the pointation of
PW Mst. Zakria, Mst. Khudeja and Anwar
Khan, shows the place of occurrence inside
the house, wherefrom |: = blood stained earth

aboratory as well as Firearms Expert,
thereby, confirming the scene of the

the one recorded in the FIR by the deceased-
complainant.
13. In her statements under section 161
and 164 Cr.P.C, the so-called eyewitness,
Mst. Zakria Bibi, mentioned the presence of
her aunt, Mst. Khudeja, in the house when her
other family members were away for
participation in the marriage ceremony cf a

co-accused Khan Shah as to who were my SS)
and what were they doing: but only Mst. . -
Zakria Bibi was produced and the said Mst.
Khudeja was abandoned for the reasons best
known to the prosecution. Anyhow, Mst.
Khudeja was the best available evidence, but
her statement before the Court was withheld
for undisclosed reasons, thereby creating a
serious doubt in the case of the prosecution,
x’ especially, when credentials of Mst. Zakria
Bibi were seriously jeopardized by the
defence. Besides, statement of Mst. Zakria
Bibi creates further serious doubts when she
claims identification of the accused in the
torch light, because availability of electricity
light is not denied, and further when she also
mentioned names of Khan Shah and another
unknown person (co-accused Muhammad
Sajid) on the roof of the house at the time of
occurrence, who were nowhere mentioned as
co-accused in the so-called dying declaration

14. it is also something beyond
comprehension that no one from the nearby Ap
houses, shown in the site pian, was attracted GL
to the spot despite noise, grappling between
the accused and the deceased, preceding the
occurrence, which, allegedly, attracted Mst.
Zakria and Mst. Khudeja, followed by firing in
the house, the inmates of which, excepting
Mst. Zakria, were away. On the other hand, in
the FIR, the deceased-complainant
specifically stated that he contacted PW
Anwar Khan on his cell phone who arrived at
the spot and removed him to the hospital.
Apart from the fact that contact of PW Anwar
Khan from the cell phone of the deceased was
never established from the cell data, his
presence in the hospital could also not be
proved through his signature / thumb
impression on the FIR besides the thumb
impression of the deceased-complainant in
order to substantiate case of the prosecution
and his statement before the Court. PW

deceased, but himself admitted that he would
not have gone to the spot had he not received a
call from the deceased on his cell phone. His Ue,
testimony is also not worthy of reliance when
he admits that the doctor was present in the
hospital when they reached there alongwith
the injured, whereas Muhammad Iqbal Khan,
Additional SHO stated that the doctor did not
reach the hospital in his presence, where he
stayed for 30/45 minutes for drafting Murasila
and preparing the injury sheet. The other two
co-accused, namely, Khan Shah and
Muhammad Sajid were acquitted of the
charges by the learned trial Court / Additional
Sessions Judge-ll, Mansehra, vide impugned
judgment dated 21.02.2012, and appeal
against their acquittal also stands disrmissed
vide this judgment, owing to lack of even an
iota of incriminating evidence against them.
Likewise, the convict-appellant also stands

15. Above all, the motive for the offence
remained shrouded in mystery. In the FIR,

the deceased-complainant categorically stated

that he had no previous enmity. According to”
the deceased-complainant, the convict-
appellant reached the spot when he had just
asked for torch from Sher Bahadur while
standing at the door of his house, and inquired
from him as to why he had come to the village
at night time and then fired at him with his 30
\ bore pistol. The important questions like how
the convict-appellant reached the spot
immediately after the deceased-complainant
had arrived there and had just asked for the
torch and why he got so annoyed with the visit
of the deceased-complainant to the village at
night time that he, allegedly, took his life,
without having any previous enmity or ill-will,
as stated by the deceased-complainant in his
so-called dying declaration, nevertheless,

remained unanswered. It may also be added

the purpose of his visit to the village at night

pistol, without disclosing the factum of. °
grappling of the convict-appellant and e IY
accused Khan Shah with him, which was not
only important part of the statement of PW
Mst. Zakria Bibi under section 164 Cr.P.C but
was also reiterated by the PW in her
statement before the Court. The non-
disclosure of motive for the offence, which,
indeed, took place in mysterious
circumstances tends to create serious dent in
the case of prosecution, the edifice of which
was raised on the dying declaration of the
deceased-complainant.

16. In view of the above © stated
discrepancies and glaring contradictions in the
case of the prosecution against the convict-
appellant, it was not safe to rely on the so-
called dying declaration of the deceased-
complainant in the absence of credible
corroborative ocular and _ circumstantial

evidence. Therefore, Criminal Appeal No.22-
20

A of 2012 is allowed and the conviction and
sentence of the appellant recorded vide
judgment of the learned trial Court / Addition
Sessions Judge-ll, Mansehra, Camp cout, S 2)
Oghi dated 21.02.2012 are set aside and the
appellant is acquitted of the charges leveled
against him. The appellant be set at liberty if
not required in any other case.

17. Resultantly, Criminal Revision No.10-
A/2012 by the father of deceased-complainant
for enhancement of the sentence awarded to
the appellant-accused, Khawas_ Rasool, is
dismissed.

18. The Criminal Appeal No.38-A of 2012
under section 417(2-A) filed by the father of
the deceased/appellant challenging the
acquittal of accused/Khan Shah and
Muhammad Sajid,is also dismissed.

These are the detailed reasons for
