seat as Sadam Hussain (the appellants). The Oil Tanker
was brought to Police Station and on search two plastic
sacks, one containing 11 packets of heroin, each packet
weighing1025 grams and another sack containing 16
packets of heroin, each weighing 1535 grams, was
recovered from its secret cavity. On personal search of
appellant Zia Ullah a Q-Mobile along with SIM, his

CNIC and cash amount Rs.5750/- were recovered
3

whereas from personal possession of appellant Saddam
Hussain, a Nokia mobile phone, CNIC and cash amount
of Rs.930/- were recovered. From switch Board of the
Oil Tanker Registration copy of the Oil Tanker in the
name of one Rauf was also recovered. Zardad Ali SHO
(PW.4), separated 05 grams from each packet as samples
for chemical analysis by the FSL and sealed the same in
parcels No.1 to 27. The remaining quantity of the heroin
was sealed in parcels No.28 and 29. He took into
possession the recovered heroin, Oil Tanker, its
registration and recoveries effected from personal
possession of the appellants vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.4/2 in presence of marginal witnesses, issued
arrest card of the appellants Exh.PW.4/3 and registered
case FIR Exh.PA against the appellants. He also
prepared sketch of recovery of heroin from oil Tanker
which is Exh.PW4/4.

3. Investigation of the case was entrusted to
Inayat Ali Amjid SHO (PW.2), who visited the spot and
prepared site plan Exh.PB at the pointation of the
Seizing Officer (PW.4), recorded statements of the PWs
under section 161 Cr.P.C., obtained physical remand of
the appellants, interrogated them and recorded their
statements under section 161 Cr.P.C. Vide application

Exh.PW.2/5 he applied to ETO concerned for obtaining
4
MRA report regarding the Oil Tanker and examined the
Tanker through FSL report whereof is Exh.PZ shows
tampering in its chassis number. He also placed on file
FSL report Exh.PZ/1 with regard to samples coupled
with various receipts regarding dispatch of samples to
the FSL along with attested copy of Register No.19.
During investigation Sabz Ali, Tauseef and Gul Akbar
were also made as accused in the case. In pursuance of
FSL report, he inserted sections 420/468/471 PPC in the
case and on completion of investigation, he handed over
case file to the SHO, who submitted challan against the
appellants under section 9 (c ) CNS Act, 1997 and
separate challan under sections 420/468/471 PPC.

4. On receipt of the challans by the learned trial
Court, the appellants were summoned. In the meantime,
co-accused Sabz Ali was also arrested, therefore,
supplementary challan were submitted against him.
After compliance of the provisions of section 265-C
Cr.P.C., the appellants were charge-sheet by the learned
trial Court under section 9 (c ) CNS Act, and sections
420/468/471 PPC, to which they pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. To prove the guilt of accused/appellants
the prosecution examined as many as six witnesses.
After closure of the prosecution evidence, statements of

the accused/appellants were recorded under section 342
5
Cr.P.C., wherein they denied the prosecution allegations
and professed innocence. They, however, declined to be
examined on oath under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. or to
produce evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial, the
learned trial Court after hearing both the sides convicted
and sentenced the appellants as mentioned above, hence,
these appeals.
5. Argument of learned counsel for the parties
heard and record perused.
6. In support of the prosecution case, Zardad
Khan Inspector/Seizing Officer appeared as PW.4. In
examination-in-chief, he reiterated the same version as
set forth by him in the FIR. He also exhibited the
recovered contraband heroin in parcel No.28 as Exh.P.1
and parcel No.29 as Exh.P.2, Oil Tanker SAI.249 as
Exh.P.4, and personal belongings of the appellants as
Exh.P.5 to Exh.P.8 as well as registration copy of the Oil
Tanker as Exh.P.10. He deposed that site plan Exh.PB
was prepared on his pointation by the I.O. and that he
handed over case property to Zakir Moharrir of Police
Station. In cross-examination he admitted that appellant
Saddam Hussain was sitting in front seat beside the
driver and appellant Zia Ullah was driving the vehicle.
7. Iftikhar Khan ASI is the marginal witness to

recovery memo Exh.PW.4/2, who while appearing as
6
PW.5 has furnished ocular account of the occurrence. He
deposed that on 09.05.2017 he along with Zardad Khan
SHO (PW.4) and other police officials was present in
Nakabandi at Police Patrol Pump Peshawar Rawalpindi
GT road. At 10.00 hours, an Oil Tanker bearing
registration No.SAI.249 was intercepted by them. Its
driver disclosed his name as Zia Ullah and the person
sitting beside him in front seat as Sadam Hussain
(the appellants). The Oil Tanker was taken to Police
Station where the Seizing Officer/complainant recovered
two plastic sacks from its secret cavity. One sack was
containing 11 packets of heroin, each weighing 1025
grams and another sack was containing 16 packets of
heroin each weighing 1535 grams. The Seizing Officer
separated 05 grams from each packet for chemical
analysis by the FSL and sealed the same in parcels No.1
to 27. The remaining packets of heroin were sealed into
parcels No.28 and 29 by affixing three seals of HK. On
personal search of appellant Zia Ullah, a Q mobile along
with SIM, his CNIC and cash amount of Rs.5750/- were
recovered whereas from possession of appellant Saddam
Hussain, a Nokia mobile along with SIM, his CNIC and
cash amount of Rs.930/- were recovered. Similarly, from
switch board of the oil tanker registration copy in the

name of Abdul Rauf was taken into possession. He
7

deposed that the Seizing Officer took into possession the
aforesaid narcotics, vehicle, its registration and personal
belongings of the appellants through recovery memo
Exh.Pw.4/2 in his presence as well as in presence of
another marginal witness Irshad Khan SI and to this
effect the recovery memo correctly bears his signature.
8. Saleem Khan No.492 (PW.6) deposed that
during the days of occurrence he was posted at Police
Station Nowshera Cantt. Zakir the then Moharrir handed
over him parcels No.1 to 27 containing samples along
with receipt No.336/21 on 10.05.2017 which he took the
same to the FSL and delivered receipt of endorsement to
Moharrir of the Police Station.

9. Inayat Ali Amjid SHO (PW.2), who has
conducted investigation in the case substantiated the
testimony of the Seizing Officer by deposing that after
registration of the case he proceeded to the spot and
prepared site plan Exh.PB at the pointation of the Zardad
Khan Inspector/complainant, recorded statements of the
PWs under section 161 Cr.P.C., placed on file MRA and
FSL reports Exh.PW.2/5 and Exh.PZ, respectively, in
respect of the Oil Tanker as well as placed on file FSL
report Exh.PZ/1 regarding the samples and receipts
No.336/21 and Exh.PW.2/7. Both, the Seizing Officer

and marginal witness to the recovery memo have been
8
subjected to taxing cross-examination, but nothing
beneficial to defence could be extracted from them
rather they remained stuck to their stance and
corroborated each other on all material aspects of the
occurrence such as the day, date, time and place of arrest
of the appellants and recovery of contraband from the
Oil Tanker in the mode and manner as alleged in the
FIR. The positive FSL report Exh.PZ/1 qua the samples
further supplements the prosecution case. The
prosecution has also proved the chain of circumstances
under which the samples were sent to the FSL right from
the spot till its receipt in the FSL. The defence failed to
point out any discrepancy in the testimony of the PWs.
Incriminating statements of the prosecution witnesses
recorded on oath are enough to prove recovery of huge
quantity of heroin from secret cavity of the Oil Tanker
which was in exclusive possession and control of
appellant Zia Ullah. A shred of evidence has not been
brought by the defence to show any enmity of the PWs
with the appellants. In this view of the matter, we are of
the considered view that prosecution through
overwhelming evidence has proved the recovery of huge
quantity of heroin from the oil Tanker which was in
exclusive possession and control of the appellant Zia

ullah being its driver.
9

10. The appellant Zia ullah failed to discharge his
burden by proving to the contrary in terms of section 29
of Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997. In the
cases registered under the CNS Act 1997, once the
prosecution prima facie established its case against an
accused, then under section 29 of Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 1997, the burden shifts upon the
accused to prove contrary to the plea of the prosecution.

11. As regards the role of co-appellant Saddam
Hussain, all the prosecution witnesses have admitted in
their statements that nothing incriminating was
recovered from his personal possession and _ that
appellant Saddam Hussain was sitting in front seat of the
vehicle. An iota of evidence has not been brought on
record by the prosecution to establish that appellant
Saddam Hussain was in conscious knowledge of the
concealed narcotics in oil Tanker or that he was dealing
in the business of narcotics. Nothing in black & white is
available on file to show previous involvement or
conviction of appellant Saddam Hussain in such like
cases. In this view of the matter, the learned trial Court
by holding appellant Saddam Hussain as guilty of the
offence under section 9 (c ) CNS Act, 1997 has landed

into the field of error.
10

12. So far as conviction and sentences of both the
appellants under sections 468 and 471 PPC are
concermed, on scrutiny of the record we did not find any
evidence to prove that tampering in chassis number of
the Oil Tanker was made by the appellants. The
registration of the vehicle was recovered by the seizing
officer from the dash board of oil tanker, which is in the
name of one Rauf. The investigation officer has not
bothered to investigate about the real owner of the
vehicle or about the person who made tempering in the
chassis number. In this view of the matter, conviction
and sentences of the appellants under the aforesaid
sections of law are not sustainable.

13. For what has been discussed above, instant
criminal appeal filed by appellant Zia Ullah against his
conviction and sentence u/s 9 (c ) CNS Act, 1997, being
meritless is hereby dismissed. Conviction and sentences
awarded to him by the learned trial Court under section
9 (c ) CNS Act, 1997, are maintained.

14. Connected Cr.A. No.491-P/2020, filed by Zia
Ullah and Cr.A. No.492-P/2020, filed by Saddam
Hussain, the appellants, against their conviction and
sentences under sections 468/471 PPC, are allowed and
both of them are acquitted from the charge under the

aforesaid offences.
11

15. Similarly, Cr.A. No.490-P/202, filed by
appellant Saddam Hussain, against his conviction and
sentence under section 9 (c ) CNS Act, 1997, is also
allowed and he is acquitted from the aforesaid charge.
He be set at liberty forthwith, if not confined in any
other case.

16. These are the reasons of our short orders of
even date placed in Cr.A. No.490-P, 491-P and 492-P
of 2020.
