SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J:- This criminal
appeal is directed against the judgment dated
14.10.2020 of the learned Additional District &
Sessions Judge/Model Criminal Trial Court,
Peshawar delivered in case FIR No.530 dated
03.07.2017 registered under _ sections
302/324/34 PPC at police station Pahari Pura,
Peshawar, whereby the appellant has been
convicted under section 302 (b) PPC and
sentenced to imprisonment for life as Tazir and
to pay Rs.400,000/- as compensation to legal
heirs of the deceased within the meaning of
Section 544-A Cr.P.C or in default whereof to
undergo six months SI. He has also been

convicted under section 324 PPC and
sentenced to undergo imprisonment for a
period of seven years RI with fine of
Rs.100,000/- or in default whereof to suffer 06
months SI. All the sentences were directed to
run concurrently while benefit of section 382-B
Cr.P.C. was extended to the convict.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on
03.07.2017, the complainant (P.W-3) in injured
condition along with Arif deceased (then
injured) reported the matter to the local police
in the Casualty of LRH, Peshawar to the effect
that he along with Usman were eating crush ice
from an Ice Seller at Ring Road Yousafabad,
meanwhile Arif came there and_ started
altercation with the Ice Seller. In the meantime,
father of the Ice Seller Shal Bacha (accused-
appellant) also came there duly armed with
firearm and the Ice Seller asked him to kill
them. On the direction of his son, Shal Bacha
started firing at them  resultantly; the
complainant and Arif got hit and sustained
multiple firearm injuries. The report was
reduced in form of Murasila (Ex.PA/1) and sent
to police station on the basis of which FIR

(Ex.P.A/2) was registered initially under section
324/34 PPC, but later on injured Arif
succumbed to his injuries, hence, section 302
PPC was added therein.

3. On arrest of the appellant and completion
of investigation, complete challan was
submitted before the court of competent
jurisdiction. The accused was charge sheeted
to which he did not plead guilty and claimed
trial. As such the learned trial court was
pleased to direct the prosecution to produce its
evidence. In order to prove its case,
prosecution produced and examined as many
as 14 witnesses, whereafter statement of the
accused was recorded wherein he professed
his innocence but did not opt to record his
statement under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. On
conclusion of trial, the learned trial court held
him guilty and as such he was convicted and
sentenced, whereagainst he has filed the
instant appeal.

4. The learned counsel for parties as well
as the worthy Additional Advocate General,
were heard at length and with their valuable

assistance the record was scanned through.
5. The tragic incident occurred on
03.07.2017 where one Arif lost his life and the
complainant Shabbir Rehman got seriously
injured. Both the complainant and_ the
deceased then injured were rushed to the
hospital where the matter was reported to P.W-
05 who drafted the Murasila (Ex.PA/1)
prepared the injury sheets and the injured were
referred to the doctor for their medical
examination. The complainant was examined
by the doctor at 1818 hours and it was
thereafter that he reported the matter at 1845
hours. It is pertinent to mention that out of the
injured, the injured Arif succumbed to the
injuries and on his death section 302 PPC was
added. The investigation officer after getting
copy of the FIR, visited the spot and on
pointation of the eyewitness Usman prepared
the site plan. During spot inspection, the
investigation officer collected blood stained
earth from the divider in the middle of the road
where the complainant and the deceased at the
time of eating crush ice, were sitting. The
investigation officer also collected 05 empties

of .30 bore pistol from point “B” situated near
the place assigned to the accused-appellant.
The accused were arrested and _ from
possession of the convict-appellant a .30 bore
pistol was taken into possession whereas from
possession of his other son namely, Sardar
Badshah a licensed .30 bore pistol was
recovered. The pistols collected from the
accused were sent to the laboratory along with
the recovered empties, where it was opined
that none of the empty was fired from the pistol
recovered from the personal possession of the
appellant. The trial commenced which ended in
the conviction of the appellant.

6. The learned trial court considered the
material aspects of the case and _ after
application of its judicial mind to the evidence
recorded, convicted the appellant. As in the
instant case one person lost his life and the
other got seriously injured, so this court deems
it appropriate to re-visit the entire case and to
judge as to whether the presence of the
eyewitness and the injured complainant is
established from the record of the case and as
to whether the injuries on the person of the

complainant are by itself sufficient to hold the
appellant responsible for the death of the
deceased. True that in the instant case we
have an injured eyewitness, but it is not the rule
of thumb that under all circumstances an
injured eyewitness will tell nothing but the
whole truth. In order to avoid miscarriage of
justice we deem it desirable to scan through
the record once again and to re-assess the
findings rendered by the learned trial court.

7. The points for determination before this
court are as to whether the incident occurred in
the mode, manner and at the stated time; as to
whether the complainant along with the
eyewitness was present at the place of incident
with the sole purpose to eat the crush ice; as to
whether the parties were known to each other
prior to the occurrence and that the
complainant succeeded in_ identifying the
accused, who actually participated in the
episode and the accused who was selling the
crush ice; as to whether the witnesses
remained consistent qua involvement of the
appellant and another in the incident and as to
whether the medical evidence is in harmony

with the eyewitness account. There is no denial
to the fact that the incident occurred at the
stated place, as therefrom, during spot
inspection the investigating officer collected
blood and also 05 empties of .30 bore pistol. In
the unfortunate incident, the complainant
received injuries on his body, whereas the
deceased was done to death for the sole
reason that an altercation took place between
the deceased and the accused. The learned
counsel for the appellant submitted that the
parties were not known to each other and that
the incident did not occur in the manner as has
been portrayed; that neither the handcart,
which was used for selling of the crush ice, was
taken into possession, nor the utensils used for
the purpose were collected by the investigating
officer. True that the name of the co-accused
i.e. crush seller was not known to the
complainant, rather the name of the co-
accused was known to him and as such at the
time of report the Ice Seller was charged by
using the word “crush ice-seller’ whereas the
convict appellant was charged as_ Shal
Badshah son of unknown. No ambiguity is left

that the convict-appellant was known to the
complainant as well as to the eyewitness and
he was specifically charged by name for the
murder of the deceased and it later on come to
knowledge that the name of the crush ice-seller
was Sardar Bacha and as such when father of
the deceased recorded his statement under
section 164 Cr.P.C he named the crush ice
seller, as Sardar Bacha and the convict-
appellant as Shal Badshah. The defence
wanted to reap the harvest of the created
uncertainly, regarding the name of the accused
charged, but we are not convinced, as
admittedly, both the parties were the residents
of village Yousaf Abad, a village that is lying
adjacent to the place of incident. Another
alarming aspect of the case is the arrival of the
deceased after the complainant, when the
eyewitness had already started eating crush
ice. The report tells that the deceased arrived
later to the arrival of the complainant and the
eyewitness, and on his arrival he altercated
with Sardar Bacha (crush ice-seller) and in turn
the accused Sardar Bacha asked his father to
kill. The approach of the deceased Arif after the

arrival of the complainant and eyewitness, to
the place of incident, suggests that the place of
incident was lying adjacent to the place of
residence of the complainant party and that in
routine the complainant party used to visit the
place. Had it not been so, the deceased Arif
would have no knowledge regarding the
presence of the complainant and eyewitness at
the place of incident and there was hardly an
occasion for him to come to the spot. The
circumstances further tell that the co-accused
Sardar Bacha was known to the deceased as
well as to the complainant and the eyewitness,
as on arrival to the spot the deceased Arif
started querling with him. When the parties had
not already altercated and when soon after his
arrival the deceased started querling with the
crush ice seller, no ambiguity is left that either
the deceased attracted to the spot with a pre-
occupied mind or they had a previous grudge
against one another. Much was_ voiced
regarding identity of the accused and the inter-
se relationship of the complainant party and the
accused, but the record tells that when the
complainant was examined as P.W.03, he

categorically stated that the accused had a
10

shop in the premises and when the shop of the
accused near the house of the complainant
party is admitted, on record then no ambiguity
is left that the parties were known to each
other. The defence could not convince as to
what prompted the complainant to charge the
accused for commission of the offence and that
what mala fide the eyewitness and the
complainant had against the convict-appellant.
The defence right from the beginning till the
end could not build up a case which would
suggest that either the incident did not occur in
the mode and manner, or the real facts were
twisted by the complainant and the eyewitness.
True that some minor discrepancies are lying
on the surface of record and equally true that
the eyewitness Usman was not believed by the
learned trial court, but we cannot ignore that
this case has its peculiar characteristics, which
need appreciation, strictly in light of its
characteristics and the manner in which the
incident occurred. As the defence could not
point out any previous ill-will between the
parties, so this court is not ready to accept that

the accused were substituted and that the real
11

culprits were let off. The uncertainty regarding
the identity of the accused, pointed out by the
learned counsel for the appellant, compelled us
to go through the relevant part of the
statements of the witnesses and as such we
visited the same. No ambiguity is left that the
incident occurred near village Yousaf Abad and
that both the complainant party and the
accused were the residents of the same village.
As the accused and the complainant party,
except the appellant were of the same age so it
appeals to a prudent mind that there might
have taken altercation between the accused
Sardar Bacha and the complainant party and
the father i.e. the appellant who was present
near the place of incident could not resist the
same and fired at the complainant and the
deceased.

8. The injured were rushed to the hospital
soon after the incident, where the matter was
reported by the complainant, who too, was in
injured condition. The bona fide of the
prosecution can be gauged from the fact, that
soon after arrival to the hospital, complainant

did not make the report rather he was
12

examined by the doctor at 1818 hours and his
medico legal certificate was prepared. The
complainant was examined as (P.W-03) who
stated that on his arrival to the hospital he was
in miserable condition and was examined by
the doctor and it took him 30 minutes to regain
his senses and after he turned stable, he
reported the matter. The time of report and the
time of examination of the injured, by the
doctor, confirm, the statement of the
complainant regarding this particular aspect of
the case. True that while reporting the matter,
the complainant could not tell the name of the
co-accused Sardar Bacha rather, used the
word crush ice-seller but his father’s name was
duly mentioned. Had the prosecution mala fide,
then instead of using the word “crush ice seller”
the complainant would have collected the real
name of the co-accused and would have
named him, instead of using an ambiguous
term for his identity. It is evident from the
record that the accused was running the
business of selling crush ice and the handcart
finds mention in the site plan and from adjacent

to the place of accused 05 empties of .30 bore
13

pistol were taken into possession. As on one
hand, the accused were also the residents of
village Yousaf Abad and they had the place of
business adjacent to their village, so no
ambiguity is left that the exact name of the co-
accused was easily ascertained. Another
important aspect of the case is the subsequent
arrival of the father of the deceased namely,
Badam Gul, who recorded his 164 Cr.P.C
statement and he also supported the case of
the complainant and charged both, i.e. convict-
appellant and the acquitted co-accused by
name. As the matter was promptly reported
and that the injured were duly examined by the
doctor, who confirmed the injuries on their
bodies, so the time of arrival to the hospital, the
time when the matter was reported and the
time when the injured were examined by the
doctor are in harmony. We cannot ignore that
the complainant who himself got injured in the
incident, is not a relative of the deceased, and
that he had no interest to falsely implicate the
accused, that too, for the benefit of the
deceased and his father, rather the record tells

that he being the natural witness deposed
14

consistently and categorically. True that the
injuries on the person of an injured witness are
not by itself sufficient to hold an accused
charged, responsible for commission of the
offence, but equally true that when the injured
has no mala fide to charge and when the
prosecution could not succeed in proving him
an interested witness, then his statement can
be taken into consideration and that the stamp
of injuries on his body can validly be
considered as a token of his presence on the
spot, at the time of the incident. As in the
instant case the complainant received injuries
and so his presence on the spot cannot be
doubted. We are benefited from the case titled
“Khadija Siddique Vs Shah Hussain” (PLD
2019 SC 261) which reads as follows:-

“The ocular account of the said
occurrence had been furnished
before the trial court by three
eye-witnesses namely Riaz
Ahmed complainant (PW5),
Khadija Siddiqui (PW6) and Sofia
Siddiqui (PW7) out of whom the
last two witnesses had the stamp
of injuries on_ their bodies
vouchsafing their presence at the

scene of the crime at the relevant
15

time. The said eye-witnesses had
consistently pointed their
accusing fingers towards
respondent No. 1 as the sole
perpetrator of the _ alleged
offences and ostensibly they had
no earthly reason to falsely
implicate respondent No. 1 in a
case of this nature or to
substitute him for the actual

culprit.”

9. It was voiced by the defence that in fact
the matter was reported by father of the
deceased i.e. Badam Gul, when his attendance
was procured but the record is silent regarding
this particular aspect of the case and the
investigation officer could not bring on record
his interest to let off the real culprits and to
substitute the innocent persons, that too, for
the death of his real son. As in the instant case
the real father of the deceased also appeared
before the learned trial Court and supported the
stance of the complainant, so it does not
appeal to a prudent mind that a real father
would substitute innocent persons for the death
of his son, by letting free the actual culprits.

The situation in hand has been highlighted in
16

case titled “Agil Shah Vs The State (2023
SCMR 831)” which reads as follows:

“Learned counsel for the petitioner
could not point out any plausible
reason as to why the complainant has
falsely involved the petitioner in the
present case and let off the real
culprit, who has committed murder of
her mother and sister. Substitution in
such like cases is a_ rare
phenomenon. The medical evidence
available on the record further
corroborates the ocular account so
far as the nature, time, locale and
impact of the injuries on the person
of the deceased and injured is
concerned. Even otherwise, it is
settled law that where ocular
evidence is found trustworthy and
confidence inspiring, the same is
given’ preference over’ medical
evidence and the same alone is
sufficient to sustain conviction of an

accused.”

The peculiar circumstances of the
present case must be tested on the touchstone
other than the ordinary mode, and as in case in
hand the defence could not bring on record
another theory, so the one advanced by the
complainant will hold the field and can happily

accepted. True that the learned trial court did
17

not accept the statement of the eyewitness and
that his testimony was excluded from
consideration, but equally true that even if the
statement of the eyewitness is taken out of
consideration, even then the prosecution is left
with an injured and disinterested eyewitness,
who reported the matter, and stood the test of
searching cross-examination whose credibility
could not be shaken. As the complainant is
enjoying the status of an independent witness,
so this court is confident in holding that in case
the eyewitness is disbelieved, even then the
statement of this witness is sufficient for
holding the appellant responsible for the
injuries caused and murder committed. As the
quick succession of events left a little room for
the prosecution to consult, so we are confident
in holding that the prosecution succeeded in
establishing its charge against the appellant,
the issue in hand has been answered in case
titled “Khadija Siddique and another Vs
Shah _Hussain_and_another (PLD 2019
Supreme Court 261)” which reads as follows:-

“The ocular account of the said

occurrence had _ been __ furnished
18

before the trial court by three eye-
witnesses namely Riaz Ahmed
complainant (PW5), Khadija Siddiqui
(PW6) and Sofia Siddiqui (PW7) out of
whom the last two witnesses had the
stamp of injuries on their bodies
vouchsafing their presence at the
scene of the crime at the relevant
time. The said eye-witnesses had
consistently pointed their accusing
fingers towards respondent No. 1 as
the sole perpetrator of the alleged
offences and ostensibly they had no
earthly reason to falsely implicate
respondent No. 71 in a case of this
nature or to substitute him for the

actual culprit.”
10. It was argued that the medical evidence
does not support the eyewitness account and
that the injuries caused to both, the deceased
and the complainant could not be caused from
such a long distance, but the defence forgot
that the deceased received only one entry
wound on his back and the rest on his chest.
The places where the deceased and the
complainant were sitting, at the time of incident,
when taken into consideration, no ambiguity is
left that the injuries were caused from the
places assigned to the accused. The doctor

was cross-examined on this particular aspect of
19

the case who also remained consistent
regarding the dimension of injuries and the
number of accused involved in the episode.
The doctor has rightly explained that the
dimensions were different for the reasons that
some of the injuries are caused on the soft
parts of the body, whereas some on hard, and
in such eventuality, the size of injuries may
vary. There is no cavil with the proposition that
medical evidence is confirmatory in nature and
that in presence of the confidence inspiring
eyewitness account, the same plays a little
role. As in the instant case the complainant
remained consistent in respect of the incident,
the number of accused and the manner in
which the report was made, so the medical
evidence is in harmony with the eyewitness
account and the same has rightly been relied
upon by the learned trial court.

11. True that the motive remained shrouded
in mystery, and that the prosecution could not
produce independent witness in that respect,
but equally true that it was because of that
uncertainty, that the learned trial court was

pleased to convict the appellant to life
20

imprisonment instead, of awarding the normal
penalty of death. The atmosphere does
suggest that the incident occurred due to timely
altercation and no pre-occupied mind, so the
learned trial court was justified to convict the
appellant in the stated manner. There is no
denial to the fact that absence or weakness of
motive would be fatal to the prosecution, but in
exceptional circumstances, which are missing
in the instant case. When the incident is
otherwise proved and when_ witnesses
remained consistent on material aspects of the
case, then the weakness or absence of motive
would be only a determining factor to determine
the quantum of sentence, which the learned
trial court was pleased to determine.

12. The cumulative effect of what has been
stated above leads this court nowhere but to
hold that the prosecution has succeeded in
bringing home guilt against the appellant and
the impugned judgment is suffering from no
irregularity or inherent defects which would call
for interference. The impugned judgment is well
reasoned and the learned trial court fully

appreciated the evidence on file, which calls for
21

no interference. The instant criminal appeal,

being bereft of any merit, is hereby dismissed.
