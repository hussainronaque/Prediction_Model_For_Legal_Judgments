JUDGMENT

Date of hearing: 24.09.2018
Petitioner (s) by Mr. Khizar Hayat Khazana, Advocate.
Complainant by Mr. Azizur Rehman, Advocate.

State by Mr. Rab Nawaz Khan, AAG.

WAQAR AHMAD SETH, CuJ.- Petitioners, Zareen

Muhammad son of Faqir Muhammad & Nazeer Muhammad

son of Zareen Muhammad, seek bail in case FIR No. 409

dated 26.08.2014 under Sections 302/324/34 PPC registered

at Police Station Katlang Mardan on the grounds of statutory

delay.

2. As per contents of FIR, the complainant party

was present at the place of occurrence, in the meanwhile,

petitioners appeared duly armed with deadly weapons and

started firing at them, as a result of which, complainant

Muhammad Shoaib sustained injuries while Awais, Nauman

and Sajjad were hit and died on the spot. The occurrence was
-2-

witnessed by Gohar son of Dawa Khan and other persons

present on the spot. Motive is stated to be that prior to the

occurrence, an altercation was taken place in between

accused Qasim and complainant party in playground of

cricket.
3. Arguments heard and record perused.
4. Undisputedly, speedy and fair trial is the

fundamental right of every accused person. The policy of

criminal law is to bring accused person to justice as speedily

as possible so that if he is found guilty he may be punished

and if he is found innocent he may be acquitted and

discharged. Before the insertion of Article 10-A in the

Constitution, all the rights regarding expeditious and fair trial

were already available in the Constitution and Criminal

Procedure Code etc. The guiding principle for the grant of

bail on the ground of inordinate delay was laid down by the

Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of Riasat Ali_vs. Ghulam

Muhammad and the State. (PLD 1968 SC 353), wherein it

has been held that “delay in prosecution of accused amounts

to abuse of process of law and is a valid ground for bailing
3-

out accused, however, delay in prosecution of each case as a

ground for bail is to be weighed and judged, in each case on

its merits”.

”

The third proviso of section 497(1) Cr.P.C. was,

later on, introduced through Ordinance No. LXXI of 1979,

which reads as under:-

“Section 497.---(1) When........++++
PHOVIdC...... ccc cceecesereeceecseeees
PrOVIdC...... ccc ccevcececceceeveeeeees
Provided further that the Court shall, except
where it is of the opinion of the court that the
delay in the trial of the accused has been
occasioned by an act or omission of the
accused or any other person acting on his
behalf, direct that any person shall be released
on bail.

(a) Who, being accused of any offence not
punishable with death, has been detained
for such offence for a continuous period
exceeding one year or in case of a
woman exceeding six months and whose
trial for such offence has not concluded;
or

(b) Who being accused of an offence
punishable with death has been detained
for such offence for a continuous period
exceeding two years and in case of a
woman exceeding one year and whose
trial for such offence has not concluded.

Provided, further that the provisions of the

foregoing proviso shall not apply to a

previously convicted offender for an offence

punishable with death or imprisonment for life
or to a person who , in the opinion of the

Court, is a hardened, desperate or dangerous

criminal or is accused of an act of terrorism

punishable with death or imprisonment for life.
-4-

The bare reading of above referred provisos

would make it clear that it is a statutory right, which is earned

by an accused person for his post arrest bail where he has

been detained continuously exceeding two years for an

offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life and

whose trial for such an offence has not concluded, provided

he, in the opinion of the court, is not a hardened, desperate

and dangerous criminal or is an accused of an act of terrorism

punishable with death or imprisonment for life or previously

convicted person for an offence punishable with death. The

word “shall” means that where statutory period is complete,

the delay is not on the part of the accused and where his case

does not fall under any of the categories of the fourth

proviso, then the Court is left with no choice but to release

him on bail. Time and again, it has been held by the Apex

Court that if a case on statutory delay in the conclusion of

trial is made out then, as a rule, bail should not be refused.

The object behind this view is that any accused person is

acquitted at the end of the trial then there is no compensation

for the wrong caused to him due to his long confinement in
-5-

prison while, on the other hand, in case if he is convicted

then he has to be rearrested and put behind the bars to serve

out his sentence and in that case no prejudice would be

caused to the prosecution/complainant.

6. In the case in hand, petitioners were arrested on

08.09.2015 and since then they are behind the bars for the

last three years (03), whereas four (04) PWs have been

examined so far while thirteen (13) PWs are remaining, and

there is no likelihood of its conclusion in near future, hence,

the petitioners have earned the right of their release on bail

on the ground of statutory delay as provided in third proviso

(b) of section 497 (1) Cr.PC. Moreover, there is also no delay

in conclusion of trial on part of the petitioners as reflects

from the order sheets of the learned trial Court.

7. In view of the above, the petition in hand is

accepted and the accused-petitioners are admitted to bail

provided each of them furnishes bail bonds to the tune of Rs.

4,00,000/- with two sureties each in the like amount to the

satisfaction of Alaqa/Duty Magistrate, who shall ensure that

the sureties are local, reliable and men of means.
