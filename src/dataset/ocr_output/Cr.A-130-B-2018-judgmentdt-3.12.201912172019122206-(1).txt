2. According to contents of F.LR, it is mentioned
that complainant Farman Ali Shah, on 04.02.2015 at 17.15
hours, alongwith his nephew injured Uman Ali Shah, in the
emergency room of civil hospital, Bannu, reported the matter
to Shalil Khan ASI (PW-2), that he alongwith his nephew
Uman Ali Shah had gone to the house of their relative and
were on the way back to their home riding on motorcycle
driven by Uman Ali Shah, while the complainant was sitting
on pillion and when reached link road near the house of Sabz
Ali situated at Kotka Muhibbullah, at about 16.30 hours, the
convict/ appellant Arsalan already present there signaled to
stop, when Uman Ali Shah stopped the motorcycle the
convict/ appellant immediately pulled out .30 bore pistol from
the fold of his shalwar and tried to snatch, motorcycle, mobile

and motorcycle, which was resisted by Uman Ali Shah, at
which the convict/ appellant fired at him, as a result of which
Uman Ali Shah hit, sustained severe injuries and fell down.
The convict/ appellant snatched Nokia Mobile-C-3, Laptop
and Motorcycle superstar and decamped from the spot on the
said Motorcycle. Complainant being disable could do nothing.
The complainant immediately shifted the then injured to the
hospital, where his report was reduced in shape of Murasila
(Ex: PW2/2). Mr. Shalil Khan ASI vide his application
(Ex:PW2/1) sought opinion from the doctor regarding the
capability to speak the injured, but he was opined to be
unconscious and unable to talk. He prepared injury sheet
(Ex:PW2/3). Sent the injured to the doctor under the escort of
constable Bakhtiar Ali No.427 (PW-05) Sent the Murasila to
the Police Station, through constable Muhammad Akram
No.134, where the contents of Murasila were incorporated in
shape of F.LR (Ex:PW3/1) by Hashim Ali Khan ASI (PW-3)
and copy of the same was sent to the Mirdaraz Khan SI (PW-
12), who visited the spot and prepared site-plan (Ex:PB) on
the pointation of complainant. Took into possession blood
stained pebbles from the place of the then injured vide memo
(Ex:PW6/1) and four empties of .30 bore vide memo
(Ex:PW6/2). The injured during his treatment at LRH
Peshawar, succumbed to the injuries. He also prepared

recovery memo regarding bloodstained garments of the
4

deceased vide memo (Ex:PW 6/3). On the day of occurrence
i.e. 04.02.2015 the S.H.O Saadullah Khan (PW-5), arrested
the convict/ appellant and recovered snatched articles vide
memo (Ex:PW5/2) and crime weapon, for which F.I.R No.79
was registered against him. Regarding snatched articles
identification parade was conducted on 06.02.2015 by Mr.
Yjaz-ul-Haq Judicial Magistrate, Bannu (PW-10), while crime
empties and recovered crime weapon were sent to F.S.L. and
its report (Ex:PK) which was in positive was placed on file.
After completion of investigation complete challan was

submitted against the convict/ appellant.

3. Accused was produced in custody before the
learned trial Court. After complying formalities under section
265-C Cr.P.C., he was charge-sheeted, to which he pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution in order to prove
guilt produced and examined witnesses and _ closed
prosecution evidence. Learned trial Court recorded statement
of accused under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he professed his
innocence, neither he wished to produce defence evidence nor
opted to be examined on oath as provided under section
340(2) Cr.P.C. Learned trial Court, after hearing arguments of
learned counsels for the parties, vide impugned judgment

dated 10.07.2018, convicted and sentenced the appellant and
3

sent murder reference for confirmation of his death sentence.

Hence, the instant criminal appeal as well as murder reference.

4. Arguments of learned counsels for the parties
heard and the record gone through with their valuable

assistance.

5. The unfortunate incident occurred on 04.02.2015
at 1630 hours, when the complainant alongwith the deceased
was on his way back from the house of his relative Jehanzeb
Khan. The accused/appellant, while standing on the roadside,
signaled Uman Ali Shah to stop, who stopped, the accused
forwarded and took out .30 bore pistol from the folds of his
Shalwar and tried to snatch the laptop and mobile from the
deceased, the deceased being a young boy offered resistance,
so the accused opened firing which hit the deceased on
various parts of the body and fall down. The accused took the
laptop and mobile of the deceased and decamped by using the
motorcycle of the deceased. The injured was rushed there and
then to the hospital, where the complainant reported the

matter to the police.

6. At the very outset, learned counsel for the
defence stressed that the appellant was innocent and falsely
implicated; that there was no motive to commit the offence;

that the complainant was not present with the deceased and
6

that the arrest and recoveries were fabricated and planted and

lastly he questioned the sentence awarded.

7. We heard the learned counsel with patience, the
record reveals that the deceased was brutally murdered that
too for the sake of a laptop and mobile phone and the
complainant reported the matter with promptitude to the local
police when the deceased was injured and unconscious. The
complainant narrated the incident as he saw and the arrival
soon after the incident with injured to the hospital excluded
the chances of consultation and deliberation and false charge.
The learned counsel pointed out that the injured was brought
by the local police to the hospital as the name of the
complainant figures nowhere in the medico-legal report but
his this submission gained no ground as the deceased in
injured condition was rushed to the hospital and at 05.10 p.m
he was placed before the doctor. The report was made by the

complainant well within 45 minutes of the occurrence.

8. The complainant was examined as PW-6 and he
was cross-examined at length, but the defence could not
succeed to bring anything favourable from his mouth. He was
never questioned and never suggested that the charge was
brought against the accused owing to some previous grudge.
The complainant from the very beginning stated that there was

no motive.
In case titled Saeed and 2 others Vs. The State

(2003 SCMR 747), it was held that:-

“The evidence of eye-witnesses was not
suffering from any material defect or
contained any describable contradiction
and discrepancy to create a slight doubt
regarding the guilt of the petitioners. We
find that motive in the present case was not
shrouded in mystery as contended by the
learned counsel and in any case, the
weakness and insufficiency of motive or
absence of motive in such-like cases,
cannot be considered as a _ mitigating
circumstance for lesser penalty’.

9. The purpose of the accused was manifest from the
fact that soon after the occurrence he fled on motorcycle of the
deceased and took away the laptop and mobile Nokia of the
deceased. The accused was so hardened that at 08.00 p.m, he
was arrested from guava garden and the snatched articles were
recovered from his possession. The prosecution went with the
investigation honestly and the defence could not point out any
dent or mala fide. The complainant produced the registration of
the motorcycle and also the purchased receipts of both the
laptop and Nokia mobile. The prosecution was so careful that
even identification parade was arranged, where all the
recovered articles were got identified from the complainant
that too before the Judicial Magistrate. The Magistrate was
examined as PW-10, who was put to searching cross-

examination but nothing adverse could be extracted from him.
8

10. The Investigating Officer recovered blood-stained
pebbles and four empties of .30 bore from the spot. At the time
of arrest .30 bore pistol was also recovered from possession of
the accused, which was sent alongwith the recovered empties
to F.S.L for chemical analysis and the report was received in

positive, which corroborate the prosecution story.

In case titled Nizamuddin Vs. The state

(2010 SCMR 1752), it was held that:-

“6. Coming to the question of delay in
sending crime weapon and crime empties,
admittedly, the crime empties were
recovered on the day of incident and
the crime weapon was recovered on
17-7-1996. It appears that the same were,
however, sent to Chemical Examiner on
24-7-1996 with considerable delay but
such delay shall not, in the facts and
circumstances of this case, overweigh the
ocular evidence found in line with and
supported by the medical evidence”.

11. The deceased, then injured, when reached to the
hospital was unconscious and the scribe submitted application
to the doctor for his opinion regarding the capability to talk,
which was endorsed by the doctor noting that the injured was
unconscious. The deceased then injured was referred to
Peshawar and was hospitalized in Lady Reading Hospital, but
he lost the battle of his life on the next day i.e. on 05.02.2014,
and after the postmortem examination the dead-body was

brought back to the village. The seat of injuries supported the
9

stance of the complainant as the deceased had received the
firearm injuries from his front and so the medical was in

harmony with the ocular account.

In case titled_Nizamuddin Vs. The state (2010
SCMR 1752), it was held that:

“Thus we do not find any conflict in
between ocular and medical evidence
which, rather is corroborative on date,
time of the incident' and the seat of injury.
Learned counsel took a plea in his
arguments that the eye-witnesses were
interested witnesses. There is no denial
that the complainant is brother of the
deceased while two other eye-witnesses,
namely, Sakhawat Hussain and
Muhammad Sharif are their cousins but, it
is well-settled that mere relationship does
not hold a witness interested to a party
and we find nothing to hold them so. On
the contrary we find their ocular evidence
unbiased, consistent in material aspects
and more so reliable”.

12. The deceased was a young boy and was near to
complete his education and was the hope for his family. The
brutal act of the appellant has choked the very hopes of a poor
father. Though the learned counsel lastly focused on the
quantum of sentence, but the brutal act of the accused
deserves no leniency, as the prosecution has successfully
proved the case against the accused and the normal penalty
provided for the offence of gatl-e-amd is death. After
assessing the prosecution case from all angles, we come to the

safe conclusion that the judgment of the trial Court is based
oe

10
on proper appreciation of evidence and is well reasoned,

hence warrants no interference.

13. Resultantly, this appeal being devoid of merits is

dismissed and the murder reference is answered in positive.
