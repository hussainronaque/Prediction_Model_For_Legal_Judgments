MUHAMMAD NAEEM
VERSUS

THE STATE AND ANOTHER
JUDGMENT

Date of hearing: 13.6.2017

Appellant-petitioner by M/S Noor Gul Khan Marwat and Tehsin
Alamdar Advocate.

Respondent Mr. Adnan Ali AAG for State and Mr. Saifur Rehman
Khan Advocate for complainant

MUHAMMAD AYUB KHAN, J.- This judgment shall dispose
of instant Cr.A.No.77-D/2016 and Cr.Rev.No.27-D/2016 as both
these arise out of same judgment dated 19.8.2016, passed by
learned Sessions Judge, D.I.Khan, in case FIR No.293 dated
10.3.2015 registered under Section 336 PPC at Police Station
Cantt, D.I.Khan, whereby, after trial, appellant Muhammad
Naeem was convicted and sentenced as under:-

“Under Section 336 PPC: To undergo
three years Rigorous Imprisonment and to

pay Arsh of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees one lac)

Imran/*
or in default thereof, in view of Section 337-
X PPC, he shall be kept in jail and dealt
within the same manner as if sentenced to

Simple Imprisonment until Arsh is paid in

full:

Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.PC was
extended to the appellant and his period of
detention as under trial prisoner was
ordered to be counted towards his

substantive punishment.”

2. Against his conviction and sentence, the

appellant has filed instant Cr.A.No.77-D/2016, while

complainant Muhammad Adnan has filed Cr.Rev.No.27-D/2016

for enhancement of sentence awarded to the appellant with

prayer to enhance the amount of Arsh.

3. On 21.02.2015 at 1015 hours, complainant

Muhammad Adnan (PW-7) reported to Fazal Hussain Shah

ASHO (PW-2) at Emergency Room of Civil Hospital, D.I.Khan

that on the eventful day he while riding on his motorcycle was

going to the machine/mill of one Amjid Karlu for grinding

wheat. When he reached opposite Ice Factory, Link Road near

New Bannu Chongi at 1000 hours, appellant Muhammad Naeem

armed with dagger also came there. The complainant forbade the

Imran/*
appellant of his wandering in the street due to which he became

furious and attacked the complainant with dagger, as result he

sustained injury on his left arm. On hue and cry, Noor Sultan

(PW-8) came there and rescued the complainant and witnessed

the occurrence. Motive for the occurrence is stated to be money

dispute. The report of the complainant was reduced into writing

in shape of Murasila (Ex.PA/1), on the basis of which above

referred FIR (Ex.PA) was registered.

4. After completion of investigation, challan was

submitted against the accused before the learned trial Court. He

was charge-sheeted. To it he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

Prosecution in order to substantiate charge against the accused,

examined eight (08) witnesses. Thereafter, statement of accused

was recorded under Section 342 Cr.PC wherein he professed

innocence. However, he neither wished to be examined on Oath

as required under Section 340(2) Cr.PC nor wanted to produce

evidence in his defence. On conclusion of trial, the learned

Sessions Judge, D.I.Khan convicted and sentenced the appellant

as mentioned above vide impugned judgment dated 19.8.2016,

hence, the appellant filed appeal against his conviction and

Imran/*
sentence while the complainant filed revision for enhancement of

sentence awarded to the appellant with prayer to enhance the

amount of Arsh.

5. I have heard valuable arguments of learned

counsel for the parties as well as learned Asstt: A.G. for State

and scrutinized the record with their assistance.

6. The record reveals that the instant occurrence has

taken place in a broad daylight at 10:00 a.m. The complainant

charged single accused in a promptly lodged FIR at 10:15 a.m.

for giving dagger blow to him due to which he sustained injury

on his left elbow. The injured/complainant Muhammad Adnan

has reiterated his version in his statement recorded as PW-7 as

given in the Murasila/FIR. During taxing cross-examination

nothing favourable to the accused could be brought on record.

PW-8 Noor Sultan has rescued the complainant and also

witnessed the occurrence. He deposed that on the day of

occurrence at 10:00 a.m. he was present near the spot and in the

meanwhile accused gave a dagger blow to the complainant. He

rushed to the spot and rescued the complainant. He remained

consistent qua events of the occurrence. He was examined by the

Imran/*
police after sometime of the occurrence. He is mohalladar of the

complainant and knows the accused prior to the occurrence. On

thorough scrutiny and appraisal of evidence, statements of PW-7

and PW-8 are found truthful and confidence inspiring. The

defence failed to shatter their depositions and to point out any

contradiction in their statements. From the evidence available on

record, it transpired that the prosecution has been able to bring

home charge of dagger blow against the appellant. As far as the

quantum of sentence is concerned, Section 337-N PPC being

relevant is reproduced below:-

“337-N. Cases in which qisas for hurt
shall not be enforced.
(1)

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Chapter in all cases of hurt, the
Court may, having regard to the kind of hurt
caused by him in addition to payment of
arsh, award ta’zir to an offender who is a
previous convict, habitual or hardened,
desperate or dangerous criminal, [or the
offence has been committed by him in the

name or on the pretext of honour].

Imran/*
[Provided that the ta’zir shall not be
less than one-third of the maximum
imprisonment provided for the hurt caused if
the offender is a previous convict, habitual,
hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal
or if the offence has been committed by him

in the name or on the pretext of honour. ]

There is nothing on record that the accused is

previous convict, habitual or hardened, desperate or dangerous

criminal, therefore, in the light of above reproduced section of

law, the award of three years imprisonment as Ta’zir vide

impugned judgment dated 19.8.2016 to the appellant is legally

incorrect so the same is set aside.

7. The ocular testimony is also fully corroborated

by the medical evidence. To this effect, Dr. Farmanullah, District

Headquarter Teaching Hospital, D.I.Khan was examined as

PW-6. On 21.02.2015 at 10:30 am. he examined the

injured/complainant and according to his report/MLC Ex.PW-6/1

he found a sharp wound of about 3” x 2” on the medial aspect of

left elbow. He exhibited discharge slip of the victim as Ex.PW-

6/2. According to it ‘multiple arterial/venous branches actively

bleeding, main branch artery was intact. Ulnar nerve completely

Imran/*
traumated at elbow level, median nerve epineurium lacerated,

hemostasis secured by ligation of arterial/venous branches, ulnar

nerve explored and repaired’. The nature of injury was ‘Ttlaf-i-

Salahiyat-i-Udw’. The medical evidence and the ocular account

are in juxtaposition with each other. Today complainant/victim

was present in the Court. He was called and asked to come to the

rostrum and found that his left hand was not working. Learned

Asstt: A.G. also checked it and confirmed that the left hand of

the victim was not functional. Discharge slip of the complainant

Ex.PW-6/2 reveals the nature of injury as ‘Itlaf-i-Salahiyat-i-

Udw’. Permanent impairing of the power of one hand is

established. Since the complainant has lost his one hand,

therefore, under Section 337-R PPC the complainant/victim is

entitled to Arsh equivalent to one-half of the diyat amount. In

year 2015, when the occurrence took place, the diyat amount was

Rs.19,23,843/- (Rupees one million nine hundred twenty three

thousand and eight hundred forty three), therefore, its one-half

i.e. 9,61,921.5 (Rupees nine lac sixty one thousand nine hundred

twenty one and five paisa) to be paid by the appellant to the

complainant/victim in lump sum. In case of non-payment of Arsh

Imran/*
amount the appellant shall be kept in jail and dealt within the

same manner as if sentenced to Simple Imprisonment until Arsh

is paid.

8. In light of what has been discussed above, both

the Cr.A.No.77-D/2016 and Cr.Rev. No.27-D/2016 stand

disposed of accordingly.

Announced.
