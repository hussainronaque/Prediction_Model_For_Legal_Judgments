2. Precise facts of the case are that
Aurangzeb Asad Advocate, the complainant on
29.10.2010, through a written application
addressed to SHO Police Station Mirpur,
Abbottabad lodged report Ex PW-16/1 wherein he
has narrated that on the fateful day, he alongwith
his family came from Mansehra to Abbottabad to
meet his relative Abdur Rasheed Tanoli whose
house is situated at Jinnah Abad, Javed Shaheed
Road, Abbottabad. At 07:00 PM, his son
TalalAsadwho was then aged about 16/17 years
and student of 1* Year in Abbottabad Public
School, told him that he was going to meet his
friend. Hence, he left to meet his friend in Suzuki
Jimny Jeep unregistered (applied for). When till

08:30 PM, his son did not return, then he tried to
contact him on his mobile No. 0300-9118800 but
found the same not responding. Resultantly, he
along with Abdur Rasheed Tanoli went out to find
him and when they reached at Iqbal Road, and
went to the house of his friend Ibrahim Rana, who
told them that TalalAsad (abductee) had come to
see him but then had left at 07:30 PM and even he
forgot to collect his mobile phone from the
dashboard of the Jeep, he disclosed his mobile
No.as 0331-5743008. He further disclosed that he
had been calling him on his mobile, however, the
same was not responding. They then decided to
search him out. When they reached near Sethi
Mosque, they found their Jeep parked there
abandoned on the road side. There were some
people and cart carriers (labourer) who told them
that a boy who was driving the jeep was abducted
by some people in a corolla car. He found the keys
of the jeep on the road.

3. His report was incorporated in the
FIR Ex PW-11/1. The investigation was assigned
to Fazal-ur-Rehman Khan Inspector (PW-20). The
investigating officer visited the spot, where he

found the Jeep driven by the abductee. On the
pointation of complainant, he prepared site plan Ex
PW-20/1 and took the Jeep in his possession
through recovery memo Ex PW-8/1 in presence of
the marginal witnesses. On the same day he
handed over the vehicle to the complainant vide
Sapurd Nama Ex PW-16/2.

4. On the following day, i.e. 30.10.2010,
the complainant recorded his statement under
Section 161 Cr.P.C. wherein he disclosed that the
abductor had demanded Rs. 50 million as ransom
for the release of his son TalalAsad from Cell No.
0300-9118800 which was in use of TalalAsad. In
view of such a statement, investigation Officer
added Section 365-A PPC in the FIR vide memo
Ex PW-20/2.

5. On 02.11.2010, two teams were
constituted for the search of abductee TalalAsad
headed by Additional SHO Tariq (not produced as
a Prosecution Witness). The purpose behind
constitution of the teams was to conduct inquiry
about the persons who were residing as tenants in
the vicinities of Small Industrial Estate, Iqbal
Town etc. In this connection when they were

conducting door to door inquiry, when reached
street No. 2, Iqbal Town near Small Industries,
they knocked at the door of a house. A boy opened
the door and when they were inquiring about the
owner of the house, Abdul Hafeez SI (PW-14)
noticed three persons on the roof of the house who
were trying to escape. Accordingly they chased
them and succeeded to apprehend one of them
namely accused PirNoroz Ali while the other two
fled away. On search of accused PirNoroz Ali, he
recovered a 30 bore pistol bearing No. 3140 FF
along with a magazine loaded with six live rounds
(P-4) from his trouser fold. He also recovered a
keychain (P-5), having two keys from his pocket.
He prepared recovery memo Ex PW-2/1 in
presence of the marginal witnesses. The team then
took the accused to that house and on his
pointation found/recovered the abductee TalalAsad
confined therein and chained with an iron cot.
Accordingly abductee TalalAsad was recovered
and in this regard, he prepared recovery memo Ex
PW-2/2. According to the said recovery memo,
abductee TalalAsad was fastened with a cot in a
room of the housewhich was in possession of

accused (absconding) AbidAfridi. There was no
female inmate in the house. The abductee was
found blind-folded. The arrested accused PirNoroz
Ali Shah was having swelling on his left hand and
ankle, therefore, he was also taken to hospital and
was medically examined by doctorWaqar Iqbal
CMO, DHQ Hospital, Abbottabad PW-19.

6. Investigation officer Fazal-ur-Rehman
reached at the spot and accused PirNoroz Ali Shah
along with pistol and live rounds were handed over
to him, which were already sealed in a parcel. He
prepared the Card of arrest of accused PirNoroz
Ali Shah Ex PW-20/3. On the pointation of Abdul
Hafeez ASI, he also prepared the sketch Ex PW-
20/4 of the house from where the abductee was
recovered. Healso recovered household articles,

Nikah Nama P-19 BeenishSajid from the house.

Since, the Section of law was changed to 365-A
PPC from 365 PPC, therefore, the investigation
was transferred to Ali Akhtar Khan Inspector,
Counter Terrorism Department. He recorded the
statement of abductee TalalAsad under Section
161 Cr.P.C at the police Station. Vide application

Ex PW-21/1, he produced accused PirNoroz Ali
before the Court on 03.11.2010 and obtained his
five days police custody. During investigating
accused PirNoroz Ali disclosed the names of co-
accused involved in the commission of offence.
According to the rent agreement, ( recovered from
the house ) the house from which the abductee was
recovered was rented out to ZahidHafeezAbbasi
(absconding accused), on 05th September, 2007.
On 08.11.2010, on expiry of the custody of
accused PirNoroz Ali, he vide his application Ex
PW-21/2 requested for further police custody of
the accused and consequently obtained seven days
further custody of the accused.

7. On 11.11.2010, accused AttiqueUllah
was arrested as depicted from his card of arrest Ex
PW-21/5. He was produced before the Judicial
Magistrate on 12.11.2010 with request for police
custody. The learned Judicial Magistrate was
pleased to grant 11 days of police custody of
accused AttiqueUllah. Accused PirNoroz Ali Shah
was produced before Judicial Magistrate for
recording his confessional statement on
12.11.2010 and on the said date, he made a

confession. Accused AttiqueUllah was again
produced before the Judicial Magistrate on
22.11.2010 for his further custody which was
granted by the learned Judicial Magistrate and
ultimately on 26.11.2010, accused
AttiqueUllahalso confessed his guilt before
Judicial Magistrate.

8. On 21.11.2010, accused Adam Khan
alias Faisal was arrested who was produced before
the Judicial Magistrate on 22.11.2010 and the
investigation officer requested for 15 days physical
custody of the said accused which was granted by
the judicial Magistrate vide order dated
22.11.2010. On 05.12.2010, the said accused
Adam Khan alias Faisal was again produced
before the Judicial Magistrate for further custody.
The learned Judicial Magistrate was pleased to
grant further custody of 03 days. On 08.12.2010,
accused Adam Khan alias Faisal also confessed his
guilt before the Judicial Magistrate. It is also the
case of prosecution that the aforesaid accused had
also made pointation, while in police custody,of
the place of occurrence and the manner and mode
through which the offence was committed by

them. On 23.12.2010, the identification parade of
accused AttiqueUllah and Adam Khan alias Faisal
was conducted by the learned Judicial Magistrate
in the jail premises. In the said Identification
Parade, the abductee PW-18, identified accused
AttiqueUllah and Adam Khan alias Faisal as
accomplice in the crime.

9. After completion ofinvestigation,
complete challan was submitted through Public
Prosecutor before the learned Judge Anti-
Terrorism Court, Hazara Division, Abbottabad.
Accordingly the accused were summoned from
jail. After compliance of Section 265-C Cr.P.C. the
learned Court framed charge on 30.10.2011, to
which all the accused did not plead guilty and
claimed trial. The prosecution produced 21
witnesses whereas Sher Dil Mad Moharrir
appeared as CW-1 who produced the daily diary
pertaining to report No. 10 dated 21.10.2010
showing the departure of Ali Akhtar Khan
Inspector PW-21. After conclusion of the trial, the
statement of the accused was recorded under
Section 342 Cr.P.C. wherein they again denied the

charges, retracted from the confession recorded by
10

them and stated that the same was the result of
torture and was not voluntary.

10. After hearing arguments of learned
counsel for the parties, the learned trial Court vide
impugned judgment dated 21.12.2012, convicted
the appellants under Section 365-A PPC and
sentenced them to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment
for life, ordered confiscation of their movable and
immovable property in favour of the state and also
ordered confiscation of motorcar bearing
registration No. LZJ-0808 used in the commission
of crime, in favour of the state. Benefit of Section
382-B Cr.P.C. was extended in favour of the
appellants-convicts.

11. Learned counsel appearing on behalf
of the appellants-convicts has argued that the
prosecution has failed to connect the appellants-
convicts with the commission of offence. Indeed
the present appellants-convicts were made
scapegoat. The alleged confession of the
appellants-convicts is neither voluntary nor true as
evident from the contents of the alleged confession
coupled with other evidence of the prosecution on

which they have made out their case against the
11

present appellants-convicts. He has further argued
that the appellants-convicts were twice given in the
custody of police and at the time of alleged
confession, no notice was given to the appellants-
convicts that if they do not confess their guilt, their
custody will not be given to the police. The
appellants-convicts remained in the custody of
police for more than fifteen days and the learned
Magistrate has recorded the confession in haste
and in slipshod manner without fulfilling the legal
and procedural requirement for obvious reasons.
Regarding the identification parade, the learned
counsels for the appellant-convicts have argued
that since the appellants-convicts remained in
police custody for more than fifteen days in the
police station and it is also evident that the lockup
where they were kept was exposed to the persons
visiting the police station and it is also in the
evidence that the complainant as well as the
abductee had also visited the said police station
during the investigation of the case, hence, the
appellants-convicts were seen by the complainant
and abductee before the identification parade ,

therefore, the identification parade which was
12

conducted after considerable delay, was
meaningless. Even otherwise, in the identification
parade, no role was specified regarding the
accused so identified. They lastly argued that the
circumstantial evidence do not support the case of
prosecution and prayed for acquittal of the
appellants-convicts.

12. M/S Mustafa Khan Swati and learned
Additional Advocate General, while controverting
the arguments of the learned counsel for the
appellants-convicts have argued that the
prosecution has established the involvement of the
appellants-convicts in the case and since there was
no enmity or malafide of the complainant to
substitute the present appellants-convicts for the
alleged real culprits, therefore, their conviction in
the present case are based on proper evidence.
They further argued that the prolonged custody
with the police of the appellants-convicts will not
vitiate the confession, which was otherwise
established to be true and voluntary.

13. Heard: The entire edifice of the
prosecution case against the appellants-convicts

rests on the raid conducted by the police officials
13

on the house which was in possession of
AbidAfridi(absconding accused) wherefrom not
only the abductee TalalAsad was recovered but the
accused PirNoroz Ali was also arrested who during
investigation disclosed the names of co-accused. In
support of the raid which was conducted on
02.11.2010, the prosecution has produced PW-2
Mazhar Khan and Abdul Hafeez SI PW-4. PW-2
while appearing in the Court has stated that on
02.11.2010, two teams were constituted for the
search of abductee TalalAsad. Both were headed
by Additional SHO and when they reached street
No. 2 Iqbal Town, they knocked at a door
belonging to AbidA fridi(absconding
accused).There they saw three persons, who were
running from the house and were chased as a result
of which PirNoroz Ali Shah accused was arrested,
whereas Abdul Hafeez Khan SI who was also the
member of raiding party appeared as PW-14. He
has narrated in his statement that on 02.11.2010,
the SHO constituted a police party for the recovery
of abductee TalalAsad. He was member of the said
team and the purpose of this team was to conduct

inquiry about persons who were residing as tenants
14

in the locality of Small Industrial Estate Town.
When they reached street No. 2 Iqbal Town near
Small Industries, they knocked at the door of a
house. A boy opened the door and when they
inquired from him about the owner of the house,
he (the PW) noticed that three persons on the roof
of the same house were trying to escape. On being
chased, only accused PirNoroz Ali was arrested,
whereas the other two co-accused made good their
escape. He has also stated in his report that the
raiding party was headed by Tariq Khan SI
whereas the member of the said raiding party was
Mazhar LHC, Fangraish constable, Mir Afgan
LHC, Amir constable and Zohra lady constable.
The prosecution neither produced Tariq Khan
Additional SHO who was allegedly leading the
team nor the SHO of the police station to establish
that indeed a team was constituted for the said
purpose. Even the lady constable was not produced
to record her statement regarding entry into the
house. What has irked this Court that despite the
fact that daily diary regarding the departure of
Akhtar Ali on 05.05.2011, was produced, but the

daily diary of the Police Station Mirpur has not
15

been produced to establish the constitution and
departure as well as arrival of the raiding team. In
order to establish the movement of police officials
through confidence inspiring evidence, the
production of daily diary of the police Station
showing the departure, constitution of raiding
team, its members and subsequent arrival, was a
material piece of evidence in favour of
prosecution. Indeed the daily diaries are
maintained under the erstwhile Police Rules 1934.
Under Rule 28.48 it is mandatory for every police
official to make entry of his departure, arrival and
all proceedings conducted between the intervening
period of departure and arrival. Non-production of
the daily diary has caused serious doubts in the
prosecution case regarding the mode and manner
of raid. (Abdul Sattar& others Vs. The State 2002
PCr.LJ 51, Atta Ullah Vs. The State 2017 PCr.LJ
1992). Apart from that, — irreconcilable
contradictions are floating on the surface of record
and are evident from the statements of PWs
regarding the mode and the manner of the raid.
PW-14 Abdul Hafeez SI has stated that when they

knocked at the door of the house, a boy opened the
16

door and at that time he noticed three persons on
the roof of the house. What happened to the said
boy, whether he was arrested and interrogated or
he also escaped from the spot, is a mystery.
Although the said witnesses have stated that they
chased the escaping accused, however, the lady
constable was there and the natural reaction of the
police party would have been to first arrest the boy
who opened the door. Likewise, PW-2 disclosed in
his statement that TalalAsad abductee, at the time
of recovery was blind folded with black coloured
cloth, he unfolded the cloth and upon inquiry he
disclosed his name as TalalAsad. Similarly, PW-2
in his statement has also stated that one black
coloured piece of cloth which was tied on the eyes
of the abductee was also taken into possession.
However, when the abductee himself appeared as
PW-18, he has stated in his cross-examination that
at the time when he was recovered by the police,
his eyes were not covered. The sketch Ex PW-20/4
shows that accused PirNoroz Ali was arrested from
place “F” which is a street at the back of the house,
whereas on the left and right of the raided house,

there are further houses and no street has been
17

shown connecting the street from frontside of the
raided house with the street falling at the back of
the said house from where accused PirNoroz Ali
was arrested. It has not been mentioned that how
did the police reached at point “F” to arrest
accused PirNoroz Ali. Although the prosecution
has stated that accused PirNoroz Ali was arrested
because while jumping from the house, he
sustained injury on his ankle and left hand,
therefore, he was unable to run and was
apprehended. In this regard they have also
produced doctor Wagar Iqbal CMO DHQ
Hospital, Abbottabad who has stated that on
02.11.2010, he examined accusedNoroz Ali Shah
brought by Abdul Hafeez ASI and he found
swelling on his left ankle with scratches on the left
ankle joint and scratches on the back of left hand
with swelling. However, in his cross examination,
he has stated that he has examined PirNoroz Ali
accused at 10:00 PM and he has not given the
duration of the injuries. He has also confirmed that
there is a possibility that the injuries might have
been caused with blunt weapon/object. Hence, the

injury on the body of accused PirNoroz Ali Shah,
18

is of no help for prosecution. It is also on the
record that the raiding party remained on spot for
sufficient time, they waited for the arrival of the
investigating officer, however, during this entire
time period, they have not associated anyone from
the neighborhood as a marginal witness to the
search of the house and the pointation allegedly
made by PirNoroz Ali Shah leading to the recovery
of abductee. True that insisting upon the
prosecution that in all circumstances, while
conducting search of a house, association of
independent witnesses from public is _ not
warranted, as association of private witnesses
during search depends upon the varying
circumstances of the case. It would be unrealistic
to say that the provision of Section 103 of Cr.P.C.
should be complied with in all circumstances,
irrespective of the fact whether it is practically
possible to apply, however, it does not absolve the
prosecution to at-least come forward with
reasonable justification that an effort was made to
cite the private witnesses from the locality which is
thickly populated. Even in this case, the

prosecution has not bothered to produce Tariq
19

Khan Additional SHO who was allegedly heading
the raiding party and the lady constable who was
present on the spot to ensure that the search and
recovery was made in the manner and mode as
narrated by the prosecution. In view of the above
facts the prosecution has remained unsuccessful in
establishing the manner and mode of the recovery
of the abductee as a result of search conducted by a
team and arrest of the accused PirNoroz Ali Shah.

14. Now adverting to the confession of
the appellants-convicts. The confession which has
been retracted by the appellants-convicts must be
established by the prosecution that the same was
true, voluntary, inculpatory and in line with the
other prosecution evidence and in cases where
there are more than one accused who have made
the confession, the said confession is not mutually
contradictory. It is also well settled that mere long
custody of the accused making confession with the
police per-se is no ground to disbelieve their
confession when otherwise the said confession on
the face of it appears to be true, voluntary and is
supported by the circumstantial evidence. In the

present case, accused PirNoroz Ali Shah was
20

arrested on 02.11.2010. Initially five days custody
was given to police and he was produced on
08.11.2010 for further custody of seven days and it
was on 12.11.2010, when he made the confession.
In his confessional statement, he has stated that
accused Mushtaq (absconding) and AttiqueUllah
de-boarded the abductee from his jeep. Similarly,
accused AttiqueUllah was arrested on 11.11.2010.
He was produced before the Magistrate on
12.11.2010 and the learned Magistrate granted 11
days police custody. After completion of custody,
he was again produced on 22.11.2010 before the
learned Magistrate who was pleased to grant
further custody of seven days and it was on
26.11.2010, he made the confession. In his
confessional statement, he stated that he and
Khanzaib (absconding accused)  de-boarded
abductee TalalAsad from his Jeep. Accused Adam
Khan alias Faisal was arrested on 21.11.2010. He
was produced before the magistrate on 22.11.2010
for physical custody, who was pleased to grant 15
days custody of the accused to the police. On
completion of said period of custody, he was again

produced for further custody on 05.12.2010 which
21

was again granted and finally he confessed his
guilt on 08.12.2010. He has stated that Mushtaq
and AttiqueUllah had de-boarded abductee from
the vehicle. Abductee TalalAsad appeared before
the Court as PW-18. Despite the fact that he had
identified the accused in Court as well as in the
identification parade which was conducted on
23.12.2010, however, he did not utter a single
word about the role of accused AttiqueUllah, who
according to his confessional statement de-boarded
him from his jeep at the time of his abduction. In
the circumstances when the accused PirNoroz Ali,
before making confession remained in the custody
of police for 10 days, accused AttiqueUllah
remained in custody for 15 days and accused
Adam Khan alias Faisal remained in police
custody for 18 days. Hence, the judicial Magistrate
was duty bound to have provided sufficient time to
the aforesaid accused before recording their
confession. The certificates provided by the
judicial officer along with the confession statement
of the accused shows that only 30 minutes were
given to each accused for thinking before

recording their confessional statement. In such
22

circumstances, when the accused remained in the
custody of police and at two occasions they were
produced before the Magistrate who granted their
further custody to the police, 30 minutes time to
the accused for thinking does not appear to be
sufficient time as the record is completely silent
that earlier when the accused were produced
before the Judicial Magistrate, under what
circumstances further custody was given to police
and why they did not confess their guilt at that
occasion. In such like situation the august Supreme
Court of Pakistan in “Azeem Khan Vs. Mujahid
Khan (2016 SCMR 274)” while disbelieving the
confession has laid that:-

“Keeping in view the High
Court Rules, laying down a
binding procedure for taking
required precautions — and
observing the requirements of
the provision of section 364
read with section 164, Cr.P.C.
by now it has become a trite
law that before recording
confession and that too in
crimes entailing capital
punishment, the Recording
Magistrate has to essentially
observe all these mandatory
precautions. The fundamental
logic behind the same is that,
all signs of fear inculcated by
the Investigating Agency in the
mind of the accused are to be
23

shedded out and he is to be
provided full assurance that in
case he is not guilty or is not
making a confession voluntarily
then in that case, he would not
be handed over back to the
police. Thereafter, sufficient
time for reflection is to be given
after the first warning is
administered. At the expiry of
that time, Recording Magistrate
has to administer the second
warning and the accused shall
be assured that now he was in
the safe hands. All police
Officials whether in uniform or
otherwise, including Naib
Court attached to the Court
must be kept outside the Court
and beyond the view of the
accused. After observing all
these legal requirements if the
accused person is willing to
confess, then all required
questions formulated by the
High Court Rules should be put
to him and the answers given,
be recorded in the words
spoken by him. The statement of
accused be recorded by the
Magistrate with his own hand
and in case there is a genuine
compelling reason then, a
special note is to be given that
the same was dictated to a
responsible official of the Court
like Stenographer or Reader
and oath shall also be
administered to such official
that he would correctly type or
write the true and correct
version, the accused stated and
dictated by the Magistrate. In
case, the accused is illiterate,
the confession he makes, if
recorded in another language
i.e. Urdu or English then, after
24

its completion, the same be
read-over and explained to him
in the language, the accused
fully understand and thereafter
a certificate, as required under
section 364, Cr.P.C. with
regard to these proceedings be
given by the Magistrate under
his seal and signatures and the
accused shall be sent to jail on
judicial remand and during this
process at no occasion he shall
be handed over to any police
Official/officer whether he is
Naib Court wearing police
uniform, or any other police
Official/officer, because such
careless dispensation would
considerably diminish _ the
voluntary nature of _ the
confession, made by the
accused.”

15. Only providing 30 minutes to the accused to
think over about their voluntary decision to make
confession is highly insufficient as it does not
appeal to a prudent mind that in 30 minutes time,
fear of police whichha engrained in their mind due
to the prolonged and repeated custody of police

had vanished just in 30 minutes

We have also before us the press clipping (though
not established) that accused Adam Khan alias
Faisal had voluntarily surrendered before the
police and has stated in press conference that he

was compelled to surrender as their women folk
25

were arrested by the police. In our considered
view,we are not convinced that the confession of
all accused(s) is voluntary and true, resultantly the
confessions of all the appellants-convicts have no
evidentiary/legal worth to be relied upon and
accordingly excluded from consideration, more
particularly when the appellants-convicts have not
only retracted the confession at the trial but the
same are also self-contradictory on material points.
16. Now moving to the identification
parade of the accused. Holding of identification
parade indeed is not the requirement of law but
one of the method to test the veracity of the
evidence of an eyewitness who has had an
occasion to see the accused and claims to identify
him. The sole purpose of identification is to ensure
that an innocent person, either deliberately or by
mistake is not involved in a case. Although
identification process is not a legal requirement,
however, when necessary, it is the duty of the
Court to examine that all possible steps were taken
for holding fair identification parade and the
witness at their own correctly picked up the

culprit. In the present case, accused AttiqueUllah
26

was arrested on 11.11.2010. He remained in police
custody till 26.11.2010 and during this period he
was produced before the Magistrate for custody.
Similarly accused Adam Khan alias Faisal was
arrested on 22.11.2010 and remained in police
custody till 08.12.2010. It is also in the evidence of
the prosecution that the lock up was exposed to the
public who would visit the police station. Although
the investigation officer has stated that he had
given notice to the accused to cover their faces,
however, there is no record that the accused had
actually covered their faces and they were not seen
by the abductee during their custody with police.
Why their identification parade was postponed till
23.12.2010, is an unanswered query which indeed
has irked the conscious of this Court. The abductee
TalalAsad in his examination-in-chief has stated
that he was called in police station after two days
of his recovery for identification of the accused,
whereas in cross examination he has stated that
after 25/26 days, he was called by the police for
identification of accused in jail. As per record, the
abductee was recovered on 02.11.2010, whereas

the accused Atiq was arrested on 12.11.2010 and

Adam was arrested on 02.10.2010 and the
identification parade was conducted on 23.12.2010
after the delay of one month. In the identification
parade (which was reduced into writing by the
judicial Magistrate Ex PW-5/4)no role of the
accused have been specified. It is by now settled
law that during identification parade, if the accused
was identified without reference to any role played
by him in the incident the same was of no
evidentiary value (Hakeem Vs. The State, 2017
SCMR 1546, Muhammad Yameen Vs The State
2009 SCMR 84, ArifMasih Vs. The State PLD
2001 SC 398, Lal Pasand Vs The State PLD 1981
SC 142).

17. It is for that reason, that when
abductee appeared before the Court as a witness as
PW-18, he has assigned role of each of the three
accused in his statement which indeed is an
improvement and otherwise inadmissible in
evidence (Javed Khan Vs. The State 2017 SCMR
524). Thus the identification parade is of no legal
worth to connect accused AttiqueUllah and Adam
Khan alias Faisal in the alleged commission of

offence.

18. Regarding the pointation of scene of
occurrence by the accused, suffice it to mention
that alleged places of occurrence were already
known to the police and during the said process
nothing new has been recovered or discovered.
Even otherwise, when we have disbelieved the
confession and the manner and mode of recovery
of the abductee, then pointation of the crime scene
by the accused during custody and that too without
any further incriminating recovery or discovery is
of no legal consequence.

19. The demand of ransom by the
accused/ appellants-convicts or on their behalf has
also not been established at the trial. The
complainant had informed the police on the
following day of occurrence that from the cell
phone No. 0300-9118800 which was in use of his
son, a demand of Rs. 50 million as ransom was
made, however, the police has failed to collect the
call data from the relevant cellular company to
establish telephonic call from the mobile number
which was in use of abductee to the mobile
number of the complainant. In this regard, even the

abductee TalalAsad has also confirmed/admitted in
29

his cross examination that in his presence the
accused did not call his father for ransom,
however, he has stated that they did mention many
times to him in clear words that he was abducted
for ransom. The lapse on behalf of the prosecution
to have retrieved/collected the call data is
sufficient to disbelieve the demand of ransom.
(Mst. Mehboob Bibi & others Vs. The State-2017
SCMR 1835)

20. In view of the above, and the
established principle of law of evidence that
benefit if so creeps from the evidence must be
given to the accused as a matter of right and not as
a matter of grace and thus the doubts as stated
above in the prosecution evidence being enough to
discard the whole prosecution case, (Mohammad
Akram Vs State 2009 SCMR 230, Muhammad
Zaman Vs The state and others 2014 SCMR
749),Cr. Appeal No. 03-A of 2013, J. Cr. A. no.
165-A of 2013 and Cr. A No. 166-A of 2012 are
allowed and conviction and sentence of the
appellants-convicts recorded by the learned Judge
Anti Terrirosm Court, Abbottabad dated

21.12.2012 is set aside and they are acquitted of
30

the charge/charges leveled against them and be set
at liberty forthwith, if not required/wanted in any
other case. While Cr. R No. 05-A of 2013, stands
dismissed.

21. These are the reasons for our short
order of even date.
