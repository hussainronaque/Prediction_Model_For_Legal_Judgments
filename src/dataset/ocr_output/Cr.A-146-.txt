JUDGMENT

Dr. Khurshid Iqbal, J.-

1. This appeal is directed against the
judgment dated 19.05.2022 of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge/Model Criminal Trial Court, Malakand
at Batkhela, whereby he convicted the appellant/
accused and sentenced him with benefit of section

382-B, Cr. P.C., as under:

i. Under section 9 (d) of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 2019, to undergo seven
(07) years rigorous imprisonment along
with fine of Rs. 10,00,000/- or in default
thereof, he was ordered to undergo
simple imprisonment of six (06) months;

2. On 27.09.2021, Muhammad Kamran, an

be smuggled from Peshawar to Swat in a motorcar
(VXR_ Alto), bearing registration No. LEA-139.
Pursuant to such information, he, alongwith other
police officials laid a barricade at Ronda road, Pul
Chowki, near Riaz fish shop. At about 17:00, hours,
the aforesaid motorcar coming from Peshawar side was
signaled for the purpose of checking. The person
sitting in the driver seat disclosed his name as Javed
s/o Ajab Khan, a resident of Bara Jan Khan Kalay,
District Khyber Agency. During search of the
motorcar, the complainant recovered six packets of
charas (total weighing 7320 grams) from its secret
cavities. The complainant/seizing officer separated
10/10 grams charas from each packet for chemical
examination, sealed it in parcels No. 1 to 6 and the
remaining in parcel No. 7. He prepared a memo of the
recovery, drafted the murasila and arrested the
appellant/accused. He forwarded the murasila to the
Police Station through driver Wahid Alam No. 5702

(PW-5) for registration of the case.

3. The complainant also conducted
investigation of the case. During investigation, he
prepared the site plan (Ex PB), obtained five days
police custody of the appellant/accused and medically

examined him. He also sent the parcels No. 1 to 6,

containing samples of charas, to the FSL through
Nasar Khan DFC No. 5407 (PW-2) and placed on file
a receipt thereof. He recorded statement of the
appellant/accused u/s. 161, Cr. P.C. He produced the
appellant/accused for recording his statement u/s.
164/364, Cr. P.C. but he refuted, due to which he was
sent to judicial lock-up. He received the FSL report,
(Ex PW 3/5) and placed the same on the case file.
Attested copy of Register No. 19 (Ex PW 1/2) and
attested copies of daily diaries (Ex PW 1/3 and Ex PW

farmed against him, to which he pleaded not guilty and

claimed trial.

5. The prosecution examined as many as five
(05) PWs. Thereafter, statement of the appellant/

6. After hearing arguments of the learned
Dy.P.P., for the State and learned counsel for the
appellant/accused, the learned trial Judge vide the
impugned judgment dated 19.05.2022, convicted the
appellant/accused and sentenced him as mentioned in

para-1 of this judgment.

7. I have heard arguments of learned counsel
for the appellant, as well as the learned Assistant

Advocate General, for the State and perused the record.

8. In order to bring home the charge, the
prosecution was bound to prove the recovery of the
contraband charas, its safe custody and transmission to
the FSL and the report of the FSL. As regards, the
recovery, the prosecution examined IHC Muhammad
Kamran and IHC Iqbal Hussain (PWs 3 and 4). The
evidence of these PWs precisely is that on 27/09/2021,
the personnel of the Levy Check Post of the river
Swat’s bridge connecting Malakand and Dir Lower
district (locally called Pull Sokai) received spy
information that huge narcotics was going to be
smuggled. Led by PW3, a contingent of the personnel
included IHC Iqbal Hussain and driver Wahid Alam
(PWs 4 and 5). They laid barricade there. At 1700
hours, an Alto VXR car bearing # LEA-139, coming

from Peshawar was stopped across the main Peshawar-

-5-

Swat road, where, according to the site plan (ExPB),
Riaz fish shop was situated at the North and Said
Muhammad fish shop, at the South. The person
disclosed his name as Javed son of Ajab Khan, a
resident of Bara District Khyber (appellant). PW3
checked the car and found six packets of charas in a
secret cavity behind the speed meter. He weighed each
packet. Three of the packets were found to be of the
same weight: 1250 grams. The other three were 1230,
1220 and 1120 grams each. The total stuff came out to
be 7320 grams. PW3 prepared the memo of the
recovery which was signed by PW4 and one Fazal
Hadi No. 5419. After weighing the packets, he
separated 10 grams from each packet as representative
samples, put them and the remaining stuff in parcel #
7, putting on each parcel a seal bearing initials “NR”.
PW3 also recorded a report of the incident in the shape
of a murasila. He sent the murasila to the Levy Post
through PWS. MHC Javaid Khan (PW1) received the
murasila in the Levy Post and registered the instant
case. PWs 4 and 5 confirmed that they witnessed the
recovery proceedings. PWs 3, 4 and 5 furnished direct
evidence to the recovery proceedings with all the
details referred to above; PW3 confirmed that he

seized the contraband charas and PWs 4 and 5 verified

that recovery and PW4 further substantiated the

recovery memo as its marginal witness.

9. They were awesomely cross-examined,
most notably from the perspective of existence of
different restaurants near around the place of the
incident. PW3 couldn’t say that on the road from Swat,
Sheen Ghar Hotel is situated towards the West of the
place of the incident and that the same road till the
Malakand Inn Hotel, is lying North-South. He admitted
that near around the Said Muhammad fish shop, there
are other shops. He could not state that near Said
Muhammad fish shop there is also a butcher shop. The
spot is the main junction at which roads to Swat, Dir,
Chitral and Malakand separate at the end of the Swat-
Peshawar-Islamabad motorway. Quite near to the
Junction, the river Swat runs in the North. There are
many shops and restaurants. A police official could not
be expected to know in greater detail the restaurants
and shops there. The main issue was their presence on
the spot; which was not successfully shattered. He
admitted that he didn’t check other vehicles, explaining
that the spy information was about the car of the
appellant/accused only. It appears from the cross-
examinations of the PWs that private persons were not

associated with the recovery proceedings.

10. I shall now come to the issue of safe
custody and transmission of the contraband charas.
Evidence shows that the contraband charas was taken
to the Levy Post by PW3, the seizing officer/
complainant. PW1 received murasila only from the
hand of PWS. A couple of points seem to be in order in
this regard. First, PW3 who also conducted
investigation stayed on the spot. The DDs of his
departure from and arrival back in the Levy Post,
shows that PW3 stayed on the spot of the incident for
03 hours. So, when back to the Levy Post, he took it
with himself. PW3 was not cross- examined to the
effect that he might have manipulated the quantity of
the contraband charas. Second, PW1 received the
iy contraband charas in sealed condition, entered the
Ke parcels in Register # 19 and then, handed over the
samples to DFC Nasir Khan for it transmission to the
FSL. DFC Nasir Khan (PW2) furnished evidence of
the fact that he received the samples for their
transmission to the FSL. The report of the FSL reflects
his belt number as 5427, instead of 5407. This
obviously appears to be an accidental mistake. On
return from the FSL, his statement was recorded by
PW3. Thirdly, the samples were sent to the FSL on

28/09/2021, the next day of the incident within the

Abdul Saboohi* (3.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHIO IOBAL
-8-
prescribed period. Fourthly, the report of the FSL is in

positive.

11 The conclusion of the above discussion is
that the prosecution has successfully proved recovery
of the contraband charas against the appellant/
accused. The prosecution witnesses straightforwardly
substantiated the recovery of the contraband charas
from the car he was driving at the time the Levy
contingent apprehended him. During their lengthy
cross-examinations, they remained unfaltering. No
mala fide or false implication was pleaded on their

part. It is pertinent to refer relevant case law.

11. In the case of Faisal Shahzad vs. The

State reported as 2022 SCMR 905 [Supreme Court

of Pakistan], it was held:

“All these witnesses have narrated the
prosecution story in natural manner and
remained consistent throughout and their
testimony could not be shattered by the
defence despite lengthy cross-examination.
The said witnesses had no enmity with the
petitioner to falsely implicate him in the
present case.”

12. In Liaquat Ali_and another vs. The

State reported as 2022 SCMR 1097 [Supreme Court

of Pakistan], the august Court observed:

“This Court in a number of judgments has
held that testimony of police officials is as
good as any other private witness unless it is
proved that they have animus against the

Abdul Subooki* (3B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Or. KHURSHID (OBAL
9.

accused. However, no such thing could be
brought on record by the petitioners in this
case. This Court has time and again held that
reluctance of general public to become
witnesses in such like case has become
judicially recognized fact and there is no way
out to consider statement of official as good
witnesses, as no legal bar or restriction has
been imposed in such regard. Police officials
are as good witnesses and could be relied
upon, if their testimony remains un-shattered
during cross-examination.”

13. Similarly, in Rehmat Gul vs. The State
2022 P.Cr.L.J 10 [Peshawar], the honourable Court

was of the view that:

“No doubt, the PWs are police officials but
nothing in black & white is available on file to
show their ill-will or enmity with the
appellant to falsely implicate him in case.”

14, Another relevant case is of Muhammad
Faisal_vs. The State reported as 2022 YLR 1163

[Sindh]. Its relevant paras read:

“13. [...]

(a) That the arrest and recovery was made on
the spot and the appellant was caught red
handed with the narcotics by the police whose
evidence fully corroborates each other in all
material aspects as well as the prosecution
case. It is well-settled by now that the
evidence of a police witness is as reliable as
any other witness provided that no enmity
exists between them and the accused and in
this case no enmity has been suggested
against any of the police PW’s and as such
the police had no reason to falsely implicate
the appellant in a false case. Thus we believe
the police evidence which is corroborative in
all material aspects. In this reliance is placed
on Ijaz Ahmed v. The State (2009 SCMR 99).
[...]

(h) That although no Independent mashir was
associated with the arrest and recovery of the
appellant it has come in evidence that no

office wIK
(V7

-10-

private person was prepared to become an
independent mushir at the time of arrest and
recovery despite being asked. Even otherwise
section 103, Cr.P.C. is excluded for offenses
falling under the Control of Narcotics
Substances Act, 1997 by virtue of section 25
of that Act. In this respect reliance is placed
on the case of Muhammad Hanif v. The State
(2003 SCMR 1237).”

15. In light of the above re-appraisal of the
evidence of the prosecution and the legal principles
laid down in the case law, I uphold the conviction and
sentence passed by the Jearned Additional Sessions
Judge/Model Criminal Trial Court, Malakand at
Batkhela, against the appellant/accused. Hence, the

instant appeal is dismissed.
