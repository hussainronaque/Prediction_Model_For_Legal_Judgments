Wis

QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- The State

through Advocate General, Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar, preferred _ this
appeal under section 25 ATA against the
judgment/order dated 11.01.2017 of the
learned Judge, Anti Terrorism Court-ll,
Peshawar, whereby, the accused/respondent,
Sarfara Khan, was acquitted of the charges

under sections 5 Explosive Substances Act/15
AA/7 ATA levelled against him vide FIR
NO.24 dated 29.01.2016 registered in Police
Station CTD, Peshawar.

2. According to FIR in the case, acting on
a prior information about transportation of
explosive material from tribal territory to
settled area for using the same in terrorist
activities, the complainant/SHO Police Station
C.T.D, Peshawar, Sardar Hussain, laid a
barricade on the main Jamrud road near
Police Post, Jamrud, and on the pointation of
the informer a person sitting on a seat near
the rear door of Mazda bus was found
carrying a black colour shopping bag in his lap
which was checked and two hand grenades
and a pistol (Makrob) were recovered from the
said shopping bag, and the person disclosing
his name as Sarfaraz Khan son of Ravail
Khan resident of Tauheed Abad, Wazir Bagh,
presently Madina Town, PP Munmraiz,
Nowshera, was arrested and case was
registered against him, leading to

investigation; and on completion of
investigation, complete challan was submitted
to the learned trial Court/Judge ATC,
Peshawar, where the accused/respondent
was formally charged under sections 7 (ff)
ATA, 5 Explosive Substances Act and 15 AA,
to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed
trial.

3. During trial, the prosecution examined
as many as seven PWs, before statement of
the accused/respondent was recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein, he refuted
allegations of the prosecution against him,
and also produced defence’ evidence
comprising Nazir Ahmed, Bailiff Sessions
Court, Peshawar (DW-1) and Wagar Ali,
record keeper, Human Rights Cell, Peshawar
High Court, Peshawar (DW-2), besides
recording his own statement on oath under
section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. Having heard learned
counsel for the accused/respondent and
learned DPP, the learned trial Court/Judge,
Anti Terrorism Court-ll, Peshawar, rendered

the impugned judgment dated 11.01.2017,
thereby acquitting the accused/respondent:
hence the instant appeal by the State through
the Advocate General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
Peshawar.

4. The learned trial Court/Judge, Anti
Terrorism Court-ll, Peshawar, acquitted the
accused/respondent, mainly, on the grounds
that there were contradictions on material
aspects of the case in the statements of PWs
comprising officials of Police/CTD, Peshawar,
which, when placed in juxtaposition with
statement on oath of the respondent/accused
and defence evidence proved the fact that the
alleged recovery was not made in the mode
and manner as alleged in the case by the
prosecution. Moreover, the non production of
AlG, BDU, Special Branch, damaged the
otherwise weak case of the prosecution beyond
repair. Besides, the alleged recovery was shown
from the bus, but neither the driver or conductor
of the bus nor passengers travelling in the bus
were examined by the prosecution to lend

credence to the alleged recovery.
5. The perusal of the record would show
that the complainant SHO/Inspector Sardar
Hussain, (PW-4) and marginal witness Wajid
Constable No.1494 (PW-6) contradicted each
other with regard to the time of their departure
from the Police Station, as the former
mentioned the time as 05:30 AM, while
according to the latter it was 06:30 AM when
they left the Police Station; and_ their
statements were also not consistent with
respect to presence of the informer; because,
according to the complainant/Inspector, the
informer accompanied the police party from
the Police Station, while the marginal witness
mentioned this fact that the spy informer came
to the spot after Nakabandi and that only the
police contingent under the supervision of
complainant/Inspector left the P.S for the spot
situated on main Jamrud road; which,
however, could not be exactly recalled by the
marginal witness (PW-6).

6. The learned trial Court/Judge, Anti

Terrorism Court-ll, Peshawar, was of the view,
and rightly so, that the opinion/report of the
AIG, BDU, Special Branch, with respect to the
explosive material was not admissible unless
the BDU expert was examined in the Court
and subjected to cross examination; therefore,
the non production of AIG, BDU, Special
Branch, Peshawar, had made case of the
prosecution bereft of incriminating evidence.
Besides the case was rendered further weak
by not citing and, as such, not producing any
independent witness from the general public
or driver/conductor of the Bus wherefrom the
alleged recovery was made, especially when
evidence of the prosecution was comprising
statements of the Police/CTD officials, who
were not only highly interested, but also could
not inspire confidence in view of material
contradictions in their statements before the
Court.

7. Besides, though not bound to prove his
innocence, yet through his own statement on
oath and also production of evidence

comprising a witness from the Human Rights
Cell of the High Court and bailiff of the
Sessions Court, the respondent/accused
brought material on record indicating his
arrest by the Police/CTD staff prior to the
alleged recovery from his possession.

8. There was, as such, nothing on record
to warrant conviction of the
respondent/accused, hence making the
impugned Judgment of the learned trial
Court/Judge, Anti Terrorism Court-ll,
Peshawar, unexceptionable. The appeal is,

therefore, dismissed in /imine.
