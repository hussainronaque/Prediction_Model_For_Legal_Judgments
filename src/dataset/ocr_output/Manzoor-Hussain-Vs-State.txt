JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, _J.- This

common judgment shall dispose of the instant bail petition,
filed by petitioner Manzoor Hussain and connected
Cr.Misc.BA No.1685-P/2015, filed by petitioner Farman
Ullah, as both are arising out of one and the same FIR
No.746 dated 15.08.2015, registered under sections
302/109/34 PPC and S.15 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act,
2013, Police Station Mathra.

2. According to report of complainant Bukhari
Shah, on the fateful evening petitioner Farman Ullah took
his son Hassan Shah alongwith him in a motorcar; that on
the report of fire shots in the vicinity at 9.30 p.m., he
contacted petitioner Farman Ullah to inquire about his son,
who disclosed their presence in LRH, Peshawar; that at

morning, he alongwith his co-villagers went towards the

direction of firing, where he found the dead body of his
son. On 20.08.2015, complainant in his statement under

section 164 Cr.P.C. also charged petitioner Manzoor

Hussain.
3. Arguments heard and record perused.
4. It appears from the record that petitioner

Manzoor has not been named in the FIR, rather, he has
been named by petitioner Farman Ullah in his statement
under section 161 Cr.P.C., on the basis of which,
complainant also charged him in his statement under
section 164 Cr.P.C. Admittedly, as per ratio of judgments
of the Apex Court in cases titled, “The State Vs Syed
Abdul Qayum” (2001 SCMR 14) and “Raja
Muhammad Younas Vs the State” (2013 SCMR 669),
under Article 38 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984,
admission of an accused before police could not be used
as evidence against co-accused. Besides, a 30 bore pistol
as a crime weapon has been attributed to petitioner
Manzoor, but on the one hand, the alleged pistol has not
been recovered on his pointation as the same had been
produced by one Ihsan Ullah before the I.O, while on the
other hand, no FSL report in respect thereof is available on
file. Besides, in absence of direct evidence qua murder of

the deceased by petitioner Manzoor, pistol and crime

empties being corroborative pieces of evidence,
evidentiary value of the same, is yet to be determined
during trial alongwith other strong circumstances of the
incident. In view of the above, reasonable grounds exist
which require further probe into the guilt of petitioner
Manzoor Hussain. Moreso, petitioner Manzoor Hussain is
a regular student of B.SC (Hons) in Agriculture University
of Peshawar as per record of the University annexed with
the petition.

5. As regard the involvement of petitioner
Farman Ullah, no doubt, he has been named by
complainant in the FIR directly that it was he who on that
evening took the deceased alongwith him in a motorcar,
but in absence of any direct evidence regarding murder of
the deceased by him, mere fact that the deceased was seen
in his company by the complainant, by itself would not be
sufficient to connect him with the commission of offence.
Besides, the incident has been reported with a considerable
delay on next day of the incident at 07.50 a.m. for which
no explanation, much less plausible, has been furnished by
the complainant. On tentative assessment of the material
available on record, participation of petitioner Farmanullah
in the commission of offence also needs further probe into

his guilt.

6. For the reasons discussed above, I am inclined
to exercise the discretion of bail in favour of the petitioner.
According, both the petitions are allowed. Petitioners are
admitted to bail, provided each one of them furnishes bail
bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two local, reliable
and resourceful sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial Magistrate/MOD,
concerned.
