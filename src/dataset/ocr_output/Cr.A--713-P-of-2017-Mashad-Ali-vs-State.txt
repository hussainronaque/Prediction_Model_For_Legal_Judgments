Arms Ordinance (ibid), Police Station Usterzai Kohat.
Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. has been extended to the
appellant.

2. The State through Advocate-General Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar, has filed connected Cr.R. No.
17-P/2018, seeking enhancement of sentence of the
convict/respondent from life imprisonment to normal
penalty of death as provided for the offence of murder.

3. As, both the matters are emanating from one and
the same judgment of the learned trial Court dated
26.10.2017, therefore, are being decided through this single
judgment.

4. The prosecution case as set forth in First
Information Report is that on 21.06.2013 at 2230 hours,
Maroof Ali, in injured condition in emergency room of
DHQ KDA hospital Kohat made report to Tahir Khan ASI
(PW.2) to the effect that on the fateful day he along with
his uncle, namely, Nawaz Ali (PW.11), was present near
the house of Nawaz Ali, situated in village Usterzai Payan,
when at 2120 hours, Mashad Ali (the appellant-convict)
along with Haider Ali (now dead), Waqar Ali and Qasid
Ali (acquitted co-accused), duly armed with firearms came
there and started abusing them and when his uncle Nawaz
Ali (PW.11), forbade them, Mashad Ali (the appellant)

opened fire at him (Maroof Ali), as a result, he got hit. Co-
accused, attacked PW Nawaz Ali, but he luckily remained
safe. A dispute over a shop has been alleged as motive
behind the occurrence. Besides Nawaz Ali the occurrence
is also stated to have been witnessed by Matloob Hussain.
Report of the injured was recorded by Tahir Khan ASI
(PW.2), in the shape of Murasila Exh.PA on the basis of
which FIR mentioned above was registered against the
accused. PW.2 prepared injury sheet Exh.PW.2/1 of the
injured and referred him for medical examination.

5. Dr. Rehman Afridi (PW.1) medically examined the
injured on 21.06.2013 at 10.10 p.m. and observed a firearm
entry wound on right side of his lower chest. According to
(PW.1), the injured was haemodynamically _ stable,
however, was complaining of dyspnoea. The injured was
referred to Tertiary Hospital Peshawar for further
management. On 07.07.2013, the injured succumbed to
injury. Muhammad Ashfaq MO (PW.8) conducted autopsy
on his dead body and opined the cause of his death to be
the aforesaid firearm injury damaging vital organ of the
deceased.

6. Hashmat Ali ASI (PW.10) conducted investigation
in the case, he proceeded to the spot and prepared site plan
Exh.PB at the pointation of eyewitness Nawz Ali. During
spot inspection he secured bloodstained earth Exh.P.1 from
the place of the injured and a 30 bore empty shell Exh.P.2

from the place of the appellant. In the meanwhile, one
Matloob Hussain produced 30 bore pistol Exh.P.3 which
according to him was snatched by him from possession of
the appellant after commission of the offence. The I.O.
took the pistol into possession vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.6/1 and added section 13 A.O in the case. Vide
recovery memo exh.PW.9/1, he took into possession the
bloodstained last worn garments of the deceased then
injured brought by Muntazir Ali LHC, sent the same along
with blood secured from the spot to the FSL and 30 bore
pistol along with crime empty, reports whereof are Exh.PZ
and Exh.PZ/1, respectively. On death of the injured, he
prepared his inquest report Exh.PW.10/11 and added
section 302 PPC in the FIR.

7. On arrest of the appellant and co-accused Wagar
Ali and Qasid Ali, challan was submitted against them
before the learned trial Court, where they were formally
charge sheeted to which they pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. To prove its case, the prosecution examined
as many as thirteen witnesses. After closure of the
prosecution evidence, statement of the accused were
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein they denied
the prosecution allegations and professed innocence. They,
however, declined to be examined on oath or to produce
evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial, the learned
trial Court, after hearing both the sides convicted and

sentenced the appellant as mentioned above, however,
acquitted co-accused Wagar Ali and Wasid Ali vide
judgment dated 26.10.2017, impugned herein.
8. We have given our anxious consideration to the
arguments of learned counsel for the parties and perused
the record with their able assistance.
9. The prosecution case hinges upon the dying
declaration of the deceased then injured Maroof Ali; ocular
account furnished by Nawaz Ali (PW.11); medical
evidence furnished by Dr. Rehman Afridi (PW.1) and Dr.
Muhammad Ashfaq (PW.8), coupled with circumstantial
evidence in the shape of recovery of blood from the spot
from the place of the deceased, his bloodstained garments,
positive serologist report Exh.PZ in respect thereof and
positive FSL report Exh.PZ/1s about the crime empty taken
from the spot and the crime pistol recovered from the
appellant by Matloob Hussain.
10. We would take first the dying declaration of the
deceased then injured Maroof Ali. Sanctity is attached to a
dying declaration because a dying man is not expected to
tell lie; however, it requires close scrutiny and
corroboration and if the Court is satisfied about
genuineness and truthfulness of the dying declaration, it
can be acted upon without any corroboration.

In this case the dying declaration of the deceased
then injured Maroof Ali has been recorded in the shape of

Murasila Exh.PA by Tahir Khan ASI (PW.2). It has been
categorically mentioned in the dying declaration/Murasila
Exh.PA by its author (PW.2) that at the time of making
report the deceased then injured was fully conscious. The
dying declaration bears the thumb impression of the
deceased then injured as well as signature of its author. The
factum of orientation and consciousness of the deceased
then injured at the time of making report can also be
gathered from the testimony of Dr. Rehman Afridi (PW.1),
who medically examined the deceased then injured on
21.06.2013 at 10.10. p.m. He deposed that the deceased
then injured was haemodynamically stable. Both, the
author of Murasila and the medical Officer have been
subjected to cross-examination by the defence but nothing
was brought from their mouth that the deceased was not
capable to make statement/report. Both the PWs have
established the factum of consciousness of the deceased
then injured and his capability to talk and make statement.
The dying declaration of the deceased then injured has
been recorded on 21.06.2013. After medical examination
of the deceased then injured in DHQ KDA, Kohat, he was
referred to Peshawar. The deceased then injured remained
alive till 07.07.2013 and as per opinion of Muhammad
Ashfaq MO (PW.8), who conducted autopsy on the dead
body of the deceased, the firearm entry wound on right side
of lower chest of the deceased then injured damaging vital

organs i.e. liver, resulted into the death of the deceased. In
view of the statement of author of Murasila and the
medical Officers coupled with the fact that the deceased
then injured remained alive till 07.07.2013 i.e. for more
than fifteen days of the occurrence, we are firm in our view
to hold that he was fully conscious, well oriented in time
and space and capable to make a statement/report. The
dying declaration Exh.PA reveals that the deceased then
injured has directly charged the appellant with specific role
of firing at him, with which he got hit and sustained injury.
11. The dying declaration of the deceased then injured
has been corroborated by PW Nawaz Ali in his statement.
He while appearing as PW.11 in the witness box deposed
as under:-

“Stated that on the day of occurrence I along with
deceased Maroof Ali was present on the spot meanwhile
the accused facing trial came duly armed and started
abuses; upon which, I forbade them not to abuse us, and
the accused Mashad Ali opened firing at the deceased
due to which, he got hit and fell down while the other
accused attached at me. With the intervention of
neighbours, I was separated from the other accused.
Meanwhile, Matloob Hussain came from backside and
snatched pistol from accused Mashad Ali which was
later on produced to the I.0. before me. The injured was
brought to LRC Usterzai. After first aid the deceased
then injured was referred to KDA hospital where he
reported the matter to local police and from there he was
referred to Peshawar for further treatment and I came
back to the village. The local police came there and
prepared site plan at my pointation and also recovered
the bloodstained earth and empties from the spot. The
1.0. recorded my statement under section 161 Cr.P.C.

The motive for the occurrence was a dispute over a shop.
The injured expired at North West Hospital, Peshawar. I
charge the accused facing trial for commission of the
offence.”

PW Nawaz Ali has been subjected to length and taxing
cross-examination, but nothing beneficial to defence could
be extracted from his mouth. He corroborated the dying
declaration of the deceased then injured and remained
consistent with the version set forth by the deceased then
injured in his dying declaration. He corroborated the dying
declaration on all material particulars of the occurrence i.e.
the day, date, time and place of occurrence as well as the
role of the appellant and that of co-accused. Like deceased
then injured, PW Nawaz Ali also charged the appellant
with specific role of firing at the deceased then injured. No
doubt, he is the uncle of the deceased then injured but on
the sole ground of his close relationship with the deceased,
his testimony cannot be discarded because he has furnished
a straightforward and confidence inspiring testimony
corroborated by circumstantial evidence in the shape of
recoveries and supported by medical evidence. It is well
established principle of law that testimony of a witness
which is trust worthy and inspiring confidence cannot be
discarded on mere ground of his close relation with the
deceased. A close relative, if proved to be the natural and
truthful witness of the occurrence, cannot be termed as
interested witness. Statement of a witness on account of

being interested can only be discarded if it is proved that
he/she has ulterior motive on account of enmity or any
other consideration. No evidence whatsoever has been
brought by the defence to prove any enmity or grudge of
PW Nawaz Ali with the appellant. In support of the above
findings reliance may be placed on case titled, “Khizar
Hayat Vs the State” (2011 SCMR 429), case, titled
“Saeed Akhtar and others Vs the State” (2000 SCMR
383) and case titled, “Amal Sherin and another Vs the
State through A.G.” (PLD 2004 Supreme Court 371).
12. Medical evidence furnished by Dr. Rehman Afridi
(PW.1) who initially examined the deceased then injured
and Dr. Muhammad Ashfaq (PW.8) who conducted
autopsy on the dead body of the deceased, supports the
ocular account furnished by PW Nawaz Ali and the dying
declaration of the deceased then injured.

13. | Recovery of blood from the place of the deceased
then injured, his last worn bloodstained garments coupled
with positive Serologist report Exh.PZ in respect thereof
corroborate the dying declaration of the deceased then
injured and ocular account of PW Nawaz Ali. The
testimony of PW Nawaz Ali and Hashmat Ali ASI
(PW.10), the Investigation Officer, are in line with each
other on the point that the crime pistol recovered from
possession of the appellant at the spot by Matloob
Hussain was produced to the I.O. at the spot, who took the

same in his possession in presence of PW Nawaz Ali,
10

which along with the crime empty was sent to the FSL,
report whereof Exh.PZ/1 is in positive. No doubt, PW
Matloob Hussain has been abandoned by the prosecution,
but the testimony of the above named PWs being in line
with each other, his non-production would not be fatal for
the prosecution case so as to make it a case of acquittal.
Admittedly, PW Matloob Hussain is the co-villager of the
parties and we are mindful of the fact that in such like
cases people do avoid to give statement in favour of any
party, particularly, against the accused due to fear of
enmity. Even otherwise, in the case in hand, the
ocular/direct evidence furnished by PW Nawaz Ali, is
trustworthy and confidence inspiring, therefore, in such
circumstances, there would hardly be significance of any
corroboration from recovery of pistol. The august
Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled, “ Muhammad
Ehsan Vs the State” (2006 SCMR 1857), while dilating
upon a similar proposition was pleased to hold:-

“That if the court is satisfied about the
truthfulness of direct evidence available on
record, requirement of corroboration is not of
much significance”.

14. For what has been discussed above, the
prosecution have proved the guilt of appellant upto the hilt
through dying declaration of the deceased then injured
corroborated by testimony of eyewitness Nawaz Ali,

supported by medical evidence as well as_ the
11

circumstantial in the shape of recoveries discussed above,
hence, the learned trial Court has rightly held him guilty of
the offence to which no exception can be taken. Since, an
iota of evidence has not been brought on record to prove
the motive advanced by the prosecution, therefore, the
learned trial Court was justified by not awarding capital
sentence to the appellant. In this regard reliance can be
placed on the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
case titled, “Ghulam Muhammad and another vs the
State” (2017 SCMR 2048), wherein it has been held that:-
“It is well settled by now that once the
prosecution alleges _a_ motive and fails to

prove the same during the trial, the same can

be taken as a mitigating circumstance while

deciding the quantum of sentence of the

convict. Therefore, Criminal Appeal No.73-L of

2009 is partly allowed and the sentence of death

awarded to Wazir Ali appellant is altered to

imprisonment for life”. (emphasis supplied).
Similar view has been taken by the Hon’ble apex Court in
case titled, “Haq Nawaz vs the State” (2018 SCMR 21
while placing reliance on the judgment rendered in cases of

Ahmad Nawaz vs the State (2011 SCMR 593), Iftikhar

Mehmood and another Vs Qaiser Iftikhar and others (2011

SCMR_1165), Muhammad Mumtaz vs the State and

another (2012 SCMR 267), Muhammad Imran @ Asif vs

12

the State (2013 SCMR 782), Sabir Hussain alias Sabri Vs

the State (2013 SCMR 1554), Zeeshan Afzal alias Shani

and another Vs the State and another (2013 SCMR 1602),

Naveed alias Needu and others vs the State and others

(2014 SCMR_ 1464), Muhammad Nadeem Wagas_ and

another vs the State (2014 SCMR 1658), Muhammad Asif

vs Muhammad Akhtar and others (2016 SCMR 2035) and

Qaddan and others vs the State (2017 SCMR 148). The

relevant parts i.e. Para No.3 and 4 of the judgment (supra)
are reproduced below:-
“After hearing the learned counsel for the parties
and going through the record we have observed
that the High Court had categorically concluded
that the motive set up by the prosecution had not
been proved by it. The law is settled _by now
that if the prosecution asserts a_motive but
fails to prove the same then such failure on
the part of the prosecution may react against

a_sentence of death passed against _a convict

For what has been discussed above this
appeal is dismissed to the extent of appellant’s
conviction for the offence under section 302 (b)
PPC, but the same is partly allowed to the extent
of his sentence of death on the charge of murder

which sentence is reduced to imprisonment

for life.”(emphasis supplied).

15. For what has been discussed above, this appeal and
the connected Cr.R. No.17-P/2018, being meritless are

hereby dismissed.
