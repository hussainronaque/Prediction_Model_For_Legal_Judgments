JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- At a trial held by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge/Judge Model Criminal
Trial Court, Swabi, accused Naseer Muhammad, having
been found guilty of committing murder of Asim and
Shabir Hussain deceased, has been convicted under section
302 (b) PPC and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for
life on two counts and to pay Rs.2,00,000/-, to legal heirs
of each deceased, as compensation in terms of section
544-A Cr.P.C., and in default thereof to undergo 06 months
S.I. in case FIR No.315 dated 17.04.2016, under sections
302/324/34 PPC, Police Station Kalu Khan, District Swabi.
Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. is extended to him.

2. The Naseer Muhammad convict, has filed the

instant criminal appeal against his conviction and sentence,
whereas, Asif, the petitioner/complainant has filed the
connected Cr.R. No.176-P/2019, seeking enhancement of
sentence of the convict/respondent from life imprisonment
to normal penalty of death as provided for the offence.

3. As both the matters are the outcome of one and the
same judgment of the learned trial Court dated 28.06.2019,
therefore, are being decided through this single judgment.
4. On 17.04.2016 at 10.10 A.M, complainant Asif, in
company of dead body of his brothers, namely, Shabir
Hussain and Asif deceased made report to Iftikhar ASI
(PW.2) in civil hospital Kalu Khan to the effect that his
brother Shabir Hussain deceased was serving in Frontier
Constabulary (FC). On the fateful day he (complainant)
along his brothers, namely, Kifayat Ullah (PW.11) and
Asim deceased, accompanied Shabir Hussain deceased to
see off him as he after availing his leave was leaving for
the place of his posting at Mohmand Agency Nawgai. At
08.30 a.m. when they reached the field of Anwar Sher,
their uncle, namely, Saqi Muhammad (now dead) and
cousin Naseer Muhammad (the appellant), emerged and
opened fire at them, as a result, Shabir Hussain deceassed
got hit and died at the spot. In order to save their lives,
complainant along with his brothers Asim and Kifyat
Ullah, started running towards the nearby hill. They were
chased by the accused and the moment they arrived at

Arhat of Rehmat Babu, the accused fired at them, as a
result, Asim got hit and died on the spot, whereas, he and
PW Kifayat Ullah luckily remained unscathed. Motive
behind the occurrence is that accused Saqi Muhammad was
suspecting Asim deceased for having illicit relation with
his wife, namely, Mst. Zahida. Report of complainant was
recorded by Iftikhar ASI (PW.2) in the shape of Murasila
Exh.PA/1, who also prepared injury sheets and inquest
reports of the deceased Exh.PW.2/1 to Exh.PW.2/4,
respectively and sent the Murasila to Police Station on the
basis of which FIR Exh.PA was registered against the
accused. He shifted the dead bodies of the deceased to the
mortuary, where Dr. Fazli Junaid (PW.10), conducted
autopsy on 17.04.2016. He noticed firearm entry wound
measuring 4 x % inch on left side of neck of Shabir
Hussain deceased with corresponding exit on right side of
his face. Similarly, he observed a firearm entry wound
measuring /% x % inch on left side ear with charring marks
having corresponding exit of 1x1 inch on back scalp of
Asim deceased and opined that the aforesaid injuries
resulted in death of the deceased.

5. Khalid Iqbal SI (PW.9) conducted investigation in
the case, who on receipt of copy of FIR proceeded to the
spot and prepared site plan Exh.PB on the pointation of
complainant and PW Kifayat Ullah. During spot inspection
he secured bloodstained earth from the places of Shabbir

Hussain and Asim deceased vide recovery memos
Exh.PW.4/1 and Exh.PW.4/5, respectively. Vide recovery
memos Exh.PW.4/2 and Exh.PW.4/5, he took into
possession one 30 bore crime empty from the first place of
occurrence and likewise a crime empty of the same bore
from the second place of occurrence. Similarly, through
recovery memos Exh.PW.4/3 and Exh.PW.4/6, he took
into possession the last worn bloodstained garments of the
deceased. He sealed all the above mentioned articles into
parcels in presence of marginal witnesses of the recovery
memos, produced Mst. Zahida wife of Saqi Muhammad
before the learned Judicial Magistrate where she recorded
her statement under section 164 Cr.P.C. and sent the
bloodstained articles to the FSL report whereof is Exh.PK.
He also sent the two crime empties of 30 bore to the
FSL for safe custody vide receipt No.314/21-K, initiated
proceedings under section 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. against the
accused. After arrest of the accused he produced them
before the judicial Magistrate for obtaining their custody.
During interrogation, on the pointation/discovery of Saqi
Muhammad, he recovered a 30 bore crime pistol vide
pointation memo Exh.PW.7/3. He prepare sketch of the
place of recovery of pistol as Exh.PC. He added section 15

KP Arms Act, 2013 in the case. Vide application marked

6

‘D” he sent the crime empties alongwith the recovered

crime pistol to the FSL, report whereof is Exh.PK/1. On

completion of investigation, he handed over case file to the
SHO, who submitted challan against the appellant before
the learned trial Court. During trial, accused Saqi
Muhammad was murdered, resultantly, proceedings against
him were abated. On conclusion of trial of the appellant, he
was convicted and sentence as mentioned above.

6. We have heard the arguments of learned counsel
for the parties and perused the record with their valuable
assistance.

7. As per contents of FIR, the occurrence consists of
two episodes. The first episode has been shown in the field
of one Noor Sher, where Shabir Hussain deceased has been
done to death. The second episode has been shown in the
Arhat of Rehmat Babu, situated near the hill of village
Adina, where Asim deceased has been shown done to
death. The two crime spots have been shown/indicated in
the site plan Exh.PB as Part-A and Part-B, respectively.
The inter-se distance between the two crime spots has been
shown as one Kilometer in the site plan Exh.PB. The said
distance has also been admitted and disclosed by PW
Kifayat Ullah in his statement recorded as PW.11. In the
Murasila and FIR, the time of first episode has been shown
as 8.30 a.m., however, the time of second episode has not
been given therein. The occurrence has been reported by
complainant Asif at 10.10. a.m. ie. after a delay of 01
hours and 40 minutes. The distance between the place of

first episode and the Police Station has been shown as 4/5
Kilometers. According to statement of Kifyat Ullah
(PW.11), who poses himself to be the eyewitness, the
distance between the crime spot and Civil Hospital Kalu
Khan is 02 Kilometers and between the spot and Civil
hospital as one Kilometer. He has deposed that after the
occurrence many people attracted to the spot and that the
dead body of deceased Shabbir Hussain was taken to the
hospital prior to the dead body of Asim being shifted by
co-villagers. Deceased Asim was brought to the hospital
after 10/20 minutes of deceased Shabbir Hussain. No
explanation, much less plausible, has been furnished by
complainant Asif and PW Kifayat Ullah to cover up the
delay of 1 hours and 40 minutes whereas it transpired from
record that distance of two kilometers can easily be
covered, even by foot, within 30 minutes. Complainant
Asif in support of his FIR did not appear in the witness
box. Admittedly, FIR is not a substantive piece of evidence
unless its contents are affirmed on oath by its maker and
the maker thereof is subjected to cross-examination. The
delay in lodging FIR has not been explained either in the
FIR or by PW Kifayat Ullah which cast serious doubt
about presence of PWs at the spot at the time of
occurrence. Thus, possibility of procuring the complainant
and PW Kifayatullah who are brothers of the deceased and
thereafter lodging the report after due consultation and

deliberation cannot be ruled out of the consideration.
Guidance in this regard can be derived from the judgment
of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan rendered in case
titled, “Akhtar Ali and others v. The State” (2008
SCMR 6).

8. complainant Asif has been abandoned by the
prosecution because he is absconding in a criminal case,
wherein he is charged for murder of co-accused Saqi
Muhammad. This fact has also been confirmed by Kifyat
Ullah (PW.11) in the very first part of his cross-
examination by deposing that “it is correct that accused
Saqi Muhammad was released on bail and was done to
death. It is correct that my brothers Aisf and Arif are
charged for the murder of Saqi Muhammad”. Similarly,
Mst. Zahida widow of accused Saqi Muhammad, who had
recorded statement under section 164 Cr.P.C., to the extent
of motive part of the prosecution case, has also been
abandoned by the prosecution.

9. The only evidence believed and relied upon by the
learned trial Court is the testimony of Kifyat Ullah
(PW.11), who pose himself to be the eyewitness of the
occurrence coupled with circumstantial evidence in the
shape of recoveries, mentioned above and medical
evidence in the shape of autopsy report and statement of
the medical Officer.

10. Kifayat Ullah while appearing as PW.11 deposed

that he is the real brother of Shabbir Hussain and Asim
deceased. The former was serving in Frontier Constabulary
and had come to his house on leave. On 17.04.2016, as
Shabbir Hussain on expiry of his leave was leaving to
report in his office at Nawagi Mohamand, so he along with
Asif and Asim accompanied him. When they reached the
field of Anwer Sher Khan, in the meanwhile, the appellant
along with co-accused Saqi Muhammad (now dead),
appeared from the wheat crops and opened fire at them, as
a result, Shabbir Hussain got hit and died on the spot. He
along with his brothers Asif and Asim started running
towards the mountain so as to rescue themselves, but the
accused chased them and opened fire at them when they
reached Archat of Rehmt Babo, as a result, his brother Asif
deceased got hit and died on the spot, whereas, he and
complainant Asif luckily remained unscathed. He reiterated
the same motive as set forth in the FIR. During cross-
examination PW Kifayat Ullah was confronted with his
statement recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C. by the
defence. While replying to certain questions of defence PW
Kifayat Ullah dishonestly improved his statement so as to
bring it in line with the prosecution case. Relevant part of
his statement to this effect is reproduced below:-

“T had stated in my statement to the police that the
occurrence took place on 17.04.2016 (confronted not
so recorded). I have stated in my statement that
accused came out from the wheat crops (confronted

not so recorded). I had stated in my statement to
police that one day prior to the occurrence, an
altercation took place between the accused and
deceased Asim regarding motive (confronted not so
recorded).

Perusal of site plan Exh.PB (Part-I) reveals that PW
Kifayat Ullah and Asif complainant were at a distance of
8 to 10 feet from the two deceased and at a distance of 14
to 16 feet from the accused. As per version of PW
Kifatullah during the first episode the accused emerged in
their front and opened fire at them, as a result, Shabbir
Hussain deceased got hit and died at the spot. Medical
evidence contradicts the aforesaid statement of PW Kifyat
Ullah because as per mortem report deceased Shabbir
Hussain has sustained firearm entry wound on left side of
his neck having corresponding exit on his face. In the
situation as disclosed by PW Kifayat Ullah the deceased
should have received the fire arm entry wound from front
to back. PW Kifyat Ullah and complainant, during the first
episode has not received any injury despite the fact that
they were in the direct firing range of the accused.
Besides, when accused had direct motive with deceased
Asim deceased why Shabbir Hussain was targeted in the
first episode. To this effect no explanation has been
furnished by the prosecution. Neither complainant in his
report nor PW Kifayat Ullah has disclosed about the
weapon of offence used by the accused in the commission

of offence. Rather “firearm” which is a wider term and
10

covers all type of firearms has been purposely used in the
initial report. Had the PWs been present at the spot with
the deceased at the time of occurrence they would have
specifically disclosed about the bore of the weapon. As
stated earlier, the site plan has been prepared at the instant
of complainant and PW Kifayat Ullah. According to them
the distance between the first place of occurrence and the
second crime spot is about one Kilometer. Chasing of PW
Kifyat Ullah and complainant Asif by the accused upto one
Kilometer seems quite beyond the comprehension of a
prudent mind, particularly when the accused were having
firearms. PW Kifyat Ullah in cross examination deposed
that distance between the field of Anwar Sher and field of
Rehamt Babu (the two crime spots) is one Kilometer and
that while going from the field of Anwar Sher to the field
of Rehmat Babu, one has to pass through village Abadi and
fields/Arhat. He deposed that so many persons were
present at the time when they were running from spot
(Part-A to spot Part-B) but he cannot tell their names as by
then they were in hurry and fear. No independent witness
has been examined by the I.O. to substantiate aforesaid
statement of PW Kifayat Ullah. The version of PW Kifyat
Ullah is not less than an action movie. Keeping in mind the
natural human conduct, particularly, of brothers, first the
complainant and PW Kifayatullah would not opted to run

from the spot leaving the dead body of their deceased
11

brother, and secondly, if for the sake of arguments it is
presumed that their lives were also precious and they tried
to save themselves, then at least they had the option to take
shelter in any house of the Abadi falling in between the
two crime spot. PW Kifayat Ullah further deposed that his
sleeves and hands were smeared with the blood of
deceased and he had shown the same to the I.O. Khalid
Iqbal (PW.11), however, PW.11 has not uttered a single
word in this regard. In the second episode if the accused
were chasing deceased Asim, the deceased should have
received the firearm entry wound from back to front but
autopsy of the deceased contradicts the statement of PW
Kifayat Ullah. Deceased Asim has received single firearm
entry wound on left side ear with charring marks. The
distance between deceased Asim and accused in the second
episode has been shown as 10 to 12 feet and from such
distance charring marks cannot be caused, particularly,
when the weapon of offence is 30 bore pistol. The medical
evidence produced by the prosecution was forcefully
pleaded to support and corroborate the testimony of the
purported eye-witness by the prosecution but the same is
quite contrary to the ocular account of the purported
eyewitness. It is settled that in the event of variation in
ocular and medical evidence, ocular evidence has to be

believed but when the ocular account itself is inconsistent,
12

contradictory and not confidence inspiring, then no reliance
could be placed there-upon.

11. For what has been discussed above, we are firm in
our view to hold that PW Kifyat Ullah being brother of the
two deceased was not present at the spots at the time of
occurrence rather his presence was procured within 01
hours and 40 minutes of the occurrence which also caused
the aforesaid delay in lodging FIR.

12. As regards circumstantial evidence in the shape of
recovery of blood from the crime spots the last worn
bloodstained garments of the deceased coupled with
positive Serologist report in respect thereof and the medical
evidence, the same though confirm the crime spots to be
the same as alleged by the prosecution and that the
deceased have been done to death with firearm, but never
tell the name(s) of culprit (s)/killer (s). Such pieces of
evidence are always taken into consideration along with
direct evidence and not in isolation. Similar, is the case of
abscondence of the appellant. There is no cavil to the
proposition, that abscondence may constitute corroborative
evidence against a person accused for an offence.
However, when there is no direct evidence against an
accused or the evidence produced is not reliable or
trustworthy to convict a person for a capital charge, then

abscondence, even if for a prolonged period, would be of
13

no legal avail to the prosecution's case, as the people do
abscond whether they were charged falsely or otherwise.
13. Adverting to another corroborative piece of
evidence i.e. recovery of 01 crime empty of 30 bore each
from the two spots. Khalid Iqbal (PW.9) has deposed that
he sent both the empties to the FSL for safe custody vide
receipts Mark A and Mark. B soon after the occurrence, but
astonishingly, when dead co-accused Saqi Muhammad was
arrested, on his pointation a 30 bore crime pistol was
recovered vide memo Exh.PW.7/3, the I.O. again sent two
02 empties of 30 bore to the FSL along with the pistol. In
cross-examination PW.9 has admitted it correct that he had
not recorded statement of any person who had brought
back the empties from FSL which he had sent for keeping
in safe custody. As per FSL the two empties of 30 bore
sent later on along with the pistol recovered from dead
accused Saqi Muhammad, have been fired from the same
pistol. This piece of the prosecution evidence being highly
doubtful would not advance the prosecution case,
particularly, when the direct evidence of the prosecution
has been disbelieved and the alleged pistol has not been
recovered from the appellant.

14. In view of the above, we have no hesitation to
conclude that prosecution has miserably failed to prove the
guilt of appellant through cogent and confidence inspiring

direct or circumstantial evidence. Rather, the prosecution
14

case is pregnant with doubts, benefit of which should have
been extended to the appellant but the learned trial Court
by not appreciating the evidence in its true perspective
reached to an erroneous conclusion by holding the
appellant guilty of the offence. It is well settled principle of
law that for recording conviction strong evidence of
unimpeachable character is required. It is golden principle
of criminal justice that finding of guilt against accused
must not be based on probabilities to be inferred from
evidence but must rest surely and firmly on tangible and
concrete evidence; otherwise, the golden rule of benefit of
doubt would be reduced to naught. The Courts by means of
proper appraisal of evidence must be vigilant to dig out
truth of the matter to ensure that no injustice is caused to
either party. It is cardinal principle of administration of
criminal justice that prosecution is bound to prove its case
beyond any shadow of doubt. If any reasonable doubt
arises in the prosecution case, benefit of the same must be
extended to the accused not as a matter of grace or
concession, but as a matter of right. Likewise, it is also
well embedded principle of criminal justice that there is no
need of so many doubts in the prosecution case, rather any
reasonable doubt arising out of the prosecution evidence,
pricking the judicial mind would be sufficient for acquittal

of the accused.
15

15. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed. Conviction and
sentence of the appellant recorded by the learned trial
Court is hereby set aside and the appellant is acquitted of
the charge leveled against him. He be set at liberty
forthwith if not confined in any other case.

16. On acquittal of the appellant/convict, connected
Cr.R. No.176-P/2019, has become infructuous which is
hereby dismissed.

17. These are the reasons of our short order of even
date, which is reproduced below:-

“For reasons to be recorded later, we allow this
appeal, set-aside the conviction and sentence of
appellant Naseer Muhammad, recorded under
sections 302 (b) PPC on two counts, by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge/Judge Model
Criminal Trial Court, Swabi vide judgment
