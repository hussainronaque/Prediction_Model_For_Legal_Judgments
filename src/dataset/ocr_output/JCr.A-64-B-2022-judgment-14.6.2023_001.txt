HEARING:

4. We have heard Icarned counsel for the partics at length
and perused the evidence available on the record with their able
assistance.

REAPPRAISAL OF EVIDENCE:

5. | We propose to reappraise the prosecution evidence in the
following parts.

A, Ocular account

6. We shall begin with the ocular account, as the
prosecution case primarily depends on this kind of evidence. It
was furnished by the complainant Sher Wali Khan and Ms.
Qasim Jana, the injured mother of the deceased Umer Daraz.
(PWs 8 and 9). In their respective statements recorded as
examinations-in-chicf, they restated the prosecution story
almost in the same details as it was stated as first information in
the murasila recorded in the DIIQ hospital in Bannu. Key
aspects on which they were cross-examined pertains to: the
relation of the appellant with the deceased and the injured Gul
Qasim Jana at time of the incident, the purpose of the
complainant and of the injured Ms. Mala Bibi in the house of
the deceased; and, the moment of death of the deceased; and the

motive.
7. From their cross-cxamination, it is reflected that the
appellant is the son-in-law of Ms. Gul Qasim Jana as Ms.
Shaheena, her daughter is his wife. At the time of the incident,
Ms. Shahcena was not present in her house. The complainant is
the brother of late Gul Sharifullah Khan, husband of Ms. Gul
Qasim Jana and father of the deceased Umer Daraz and
Arsalan. Le lives separately. Ife visits their house daily. Ms.
Mala Bibi is an afghan woman, residing in their neighbourhood.
She fetches water from a water pump in their house. On the
eventful night, an altercation ensued between the appellant, Ms.
Gul Qasim Jana and Umer Daraz. During the altercation, the
appellant took out his pistol and opened fire which hit Umer
Daraz, Ms. Gul Qasim Jana and Ms. Mala Bibi. As a result of
the firing of the appellant, Umer Daraz died on the spot and the
two women injured. The appellant also fired at himself in order
lo create a cross version of the incident. He charged the
complainant Sher Wali Khan for firing at him. His case was
registered on the basis of FIR No.399 on 23.06.2016 U/S 324,
PPC. We will examine the cross case later in this judgment in
greater details. The motive of incident was that Ms. Gul Qasim
has another daughter by the name Ms. Amreena Bibi. The
family had some dispute regarding the aforesaid Ms. Amreena.
The time of the incident was not challenged in the cross

examination. Ilowever, the complainant was asked about his
reading of watch for the purpose of time. He replied that he
can’t understand watch reading. However, in reply to another
question, it was rather confirmed from him that the incident
took place in the month of Ramadhan, and the tawarch prayer
was finished at that time. Ile specifically stated that the time of
the incident was 21:30 hours. Hence, the defence failed to
create a material dent about the time of the incident. It is,
however, important to note that regarding the presence of Ms.
Amreena Bibi, both the PWs were not in unison. ‘The
complainant stated that Ms. Amrcena is residing in Karachi and
that she was not present at the time of incident. Ms. Gul Qasim
Jana contradicted the complainant, stating that Ms. Amreena
was present in the house at that time. The appellant in his
judicial confession stated that Ms. Amrecna was present and
that he fired at her with criminal intention, and not at all others.
We will dilate upon this aspect of the case later in this
judgment. Of great significance is the fact that the presence of
the appellant at the place of the incident, indeed, couldn’t be
disputed. ‘The complainant denied a suggestion that he was not
present on the spot. ‘This suggestion, too, is factually wrong for
the reason that the appellant in his cross report charged him for
allegedly firing at him.

8. At the behest of the complainant, Inspector ITidayat-ur-

Rahman, Investigating Officer (IO/PW12), prepared the site
ly

plan (ExPB). As depicted in the site plan, the house, where the
incident took place, is situated north-south, having its main
entry gate in the north; a washroom linked to the northern wall,
having opening towards south; two rooms with their doors
opening, toward north; and in the extreme south, there is small
vacant place. The incident took place in the courtyard. The
complainant and Arsalan were at points | and 5, near the
eastern wall; Ms. Gul Qasim Jana, the deceased and Ms. Mala
Bibi were respectively at points 3, 2 and 4; whereas the
appellant was at point 6. The deceased faced all the three from
north toward south; in front of him. ‘The complainant and
Arsalan were towards his right side in the cast. The 1.0
collected blood from the place of the deceased only, two
empties of .30 bore pistol from the place of the appellant: point
‘A’ near point 6, his place of presence, which he sealed in two
parcels. ‘The deceased, at point 2, happened to be his direct
target, which obviously resulted in his death. The appellant was
at a distance of 5 fect, 9 inches from the deceased; 6 feet 4
inches and 5 feet, 11, inches from the injured Gul Qasim Jana
and Ms. Mala Bibi, respectively. ‘he complainant was not
cross examined from the perspective of the site plan. The 1.0
was somehow cross examined. Ile admitted having recovered
no blood from the places of the injured women. He denied a

suggestion that point ‘A’ has been written in different ink.
Rather, he offered an explanation that he has given details of
point ‘A’ at the back of the site plan. Ms. Amreena Bibi was
shown in the site plan. It follows that she was not present at the
place of the incident. It has been held umpteen times that when
ocular account is natural, truthful, convincing, reliable, and
confidence inspiring, then it alone is sufficient to sustain
conviction. Reference can be made to Muhammad Irfan _v.
State (2018 PCr.LJ 1319), Muhammad Akhtar v. State (2009

YLR_ 1092), State vy. Muhammad Sarwar (2007 YLR 74), liaz

Ahmad v. State (2007 PCr.LJ 1249) and Shabbir Ahmad alias

Shabbira v. The State (2003 PCr.LJ 1023).
B. Medical evidence
9. Coming to the medical evidence, we noted above that the
hy We deceased was directly in the line of the fire by the appellant.
lhe complainant stated that after having been hit with the shots
fired by the appellant, Umer Daraz. breathed his last on the spot.
Ms. Gul Qasim Janan supported his stance. Dr. Inamullah, the
Medical Officer (PW6) in his post-mortem (PM) examination
report noted that the time between injury and death was 03 to
05 minute. Hence, the medical evidence fully proved that the
deceased died on the place of the incident. The PM report
demonstrates that two firearm entry wounds with two exit
wounds were found on the dead body of the deccased. The

respective sizes of entry and exit wounds were the same: 4 X %
and 1/3 X 1/3, respectively. While under cross examination, the
Medical Officer admitted his inability, being not a forensic
expert, to state within how much distance the deccased was hit.
The respective sizes of the entry and cxit wounds, referred to
above, were got restated from him under cross examination.

10. ‘The injured Ms. Gul Qasim Jana and Ms. Mala Bibi were
medically examined by Lady Doctor Rozina Aman whose
statement was recorded twice: as PW1 and PW 14. The former
was injured on her abdomen. In her latter statement, Dr. Rozina
Aman stated that the original medico legal report of Ms. Gul
Qasim Jana was misplaced. She produced carbon copies of the
report and discharge slip. She stated that the particulars of the
injured Ms. Gul Qasim Jana were visible and readable in the
carbon copy of the report, but the sct of the injurics were found
blank in the carbon copy. However, her statement candidly
proves that Ms. Gul Qasim Jana was injured and admitted in the
hospital and that her discharge slip shows her endorsement. It
follows that both the women were injured, treated in the
hospital and discharged. However, the exact seats of injuries of
Ms. Gul Qasim Jana couldn’t be verified from the carbon copy
of her medico legal report.

11. In the medical evidence, an important element cropped
up from the medico legal report of the appellant. Dr. Shah

Baray, (CW1), a Medical Officer in the Women & Children
-10-

Hospital, noted 07.30 pm as the time of examination of the
appellant on 23/06/2016. Learned counsel for the appellant
emphasized that 07.30 pm, as the time of examination of the
appellant is materially doubtful. Be that as it may, the FIR he
lodged against the complainant shows 21:30 hours as the time
of the incident. The injury shect available on the record of the
cross case doesn’t show the time of examination of the injuries
on the appellant. Hlowever, the same was surely prepared at the
time of recording of the FIR, which is 21:30 hours, and never
07.30 am. The same is, thus, surely a clerical mistake. ‘The
medical evidence is in consonance with the ocular account as
regards the nature, locale, time and impact of the injuries on the
person of the deceased. Thus, the medical evidence lends
complete support to the ocular account. In similar
circumstances, the Supreme Court in Muhammad Abbas and
another v. The State (2023 SCMR 487), has considered the
medical evidence in favour of the prosecution.
C. Recoveries

12. We would now advert to the recoveries. During the spot
inspection, the 1.0 recovered blood stained carth from the place
of the deceased and two emptics of .30 bore pistol from the
place of the appellant. One Constable Sadullah # 1792 (PW4)
collected blood stained Qameex of the deceased from the

Medical Officer which he handed over to the LO. SHO Abdul
-ll-

Majid Khan (PW143) arrested the appellant on 23.06.2016, the
day of the incident and recovered from his possession the .30
bore pistol bearing # 777, which being unlicensed, a separate
criminal case FIR # 106 was registered against him on
25.06.2016 under section 15-AA. Constable Naqibullah # 105
is one of the marginal witnesses of the memo vide which the
pistol was recovered. ‘Ihe ISI. reports of the aforementioned
recovered articles, most notably of the pistol and the two
empties, were returned as positive. The report clearly states that
two crime empties were fired from the .30 bore pistol # 777, the
blood stained carth and Qameez. As the appellant was under
treatment in the hospital, SHO Abdul Majid arrested him who
made a cross report in the Police Station. The positive FSI
report lends full support to the prosecution case. When ocular
account is reliable and duly supported by medical evidence as is
the case before us, then the positive SL report can safely be
considered in favour of the prosecution. Reference may, for
example, be made to Imran Mehmood _v. The_State_ (2023
SCMR 795), Asim Shahzad v. The State (2014 MLD 893) and
Ghulam Hussain v. The State (2013 PCr.LJ 789).
D. Confession

13. The appellant recorded judicial confession before
Judicial Magistrate Mr. Amir Ali Afridi (PW4). There are two

material aspects of the confession. Firstly, PW4 recorded the
-12-

statement of the appellant through the Computer Operator of his
court what he called under his supervision, and not under his
own handwriting. In the certificate he appended to the
confessional statement, he mentioned that the statement was
recorded under his supervision. In his deposition, he mentioned
the designation of the official who wrote it, but he didn’t
mention the name of the official. He didn’t endorse this fact
himself. Secondly, after recording the statement, he handed
over the appellant to the police officials; not to the Naib Court
of his court while sending on judicial remand to jail. Even if we
don’t believe, as the trial Court did, the confession as a piece of
evidence, the question is can we ignore the cross case he
registered against the complainant. liven otherwise, as held
Imran Mehmood _yv. The State (2023 SCMR_ 795), if the
confessional statement of the appellant is excluded from
consideration, there is sufficient matcrial available on the
record in the shape of ocular account duly supported by medical
and circumstantial evidence to sustain conviction. We next
propose to discuss the cross case (IIR # 399).
E. The cross case

14. ‘The medical report of the appellant in the cross case
shows one fire arm entry wound on his Icfi leg at middle on the
medial side of “ X % size, with an exit on the lateral side, and

of 1/3 X 1/3 size. Charring marks were found on the entry
u

-13-

wound. During investigation, Sher Wali Khan was found
innocent and appellant was found to have caused a self inflicted
injury on his left leg. On the direction of the trial Court, fresh
challan against the appellant under section 337-11, PPC, was
submitted. I lowever, at the time of final judgment, it found that
mens rea being missing in the case, it acquitted the appellant
under section 249-A, Cr.PC. Irrespective of the factum of
acquittal, it is fully established that the appellant registered the
cross case in which his injury was found as self inflicted and
the complainant Sher Wali Khan was found innocent. In his
statement under section 342, Cr.PC, the appellant was
confronted with the cross case. Astonishingly, he denied having
registered that case. He furnished contradictory replics: terming
the allegation in the murasila as incorrect and based on mala
fide, on the one side, and stating that he was injured as a result
of firing made by the complainant, on the other. Ile even
termed incorrect the motive being dispute over womenfolk. It
follows that the appellant, to the extent of the cross case, didn’t
offer honest replics. Hence, the appellant himself established
his presence on the place of the incident by registering the cross
case,

CONCLUSION AND THE VERDICT:

15. The conclusion of the above reappraisal of the

prosecution evidence is that the incident took place inside the
-14-

house of the complainant party; the presence of the
complainant, the deceased and both the injured and of the
appellant is fully established. The cross case further strengthens
the presence of all of them. The complainant and the injured
Gul Qasim Jana furnished ocular account of the incident which
is direct, firm, categorical and confidence inspiring. ‘hey were
not substantially shattcred during cross examination. ‘The non-
examination of the injured Ms. Mala Bibi is not damaging to
the prosecution case. The reason is that she was a stranger; an
afghan woman who perhaps avoided to involve herself in the
family dispute between the partics. Morcover, prosecution has
produced all the material witnesses in order to bring home the
guilt of the appellant. In the case of Haq Nawaz v. The State
(2000_SCMR_785), the prosecution had cxamined the
complainant, besides two other cye witnesses, mentioned in the
FIR. Ifowever, it did not produce an injured witness. The
defence agitated this aspect before the Supreme Court. While
considering the plea, the Supreme Court held that non-
production of the injured witness or other eye witnesses named
in the FIR was of no consequence, as the prosecution was not
bound to examine all the witnesses cited in the case. In the
peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the presence of

Ms. Amreena also has no negative impact on the prosecution
-1[5-

case. The reason is that the occurrence of the incident has been
duly and materially proved.

16. For the aforesaid reasons, we are firm in our view that
the learned trial court has evaluated the evidence on file in its
true perspective and has come to a correct conclusion, which is
unexceptionable. The conclusions drawn and reasons given are
cogent and convincing which find complete support from
record of the case. These are neither arbitrary nor perverse or
fanciful. Learned counsel for the appellant could not point out
any material to interfere with the impugned judgment.
Consequently, this appeal being devoid of any merit, is hereby
dismissed.
