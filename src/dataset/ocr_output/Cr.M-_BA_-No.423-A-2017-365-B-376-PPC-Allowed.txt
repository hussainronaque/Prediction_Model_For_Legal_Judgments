SYED MUHAMMAD ATTIQUE SHAH, _J.-

Accused-petitioner, Abdul Hameed, seeks his post
arrest bail in case FIR No.45 dated 17.01.2017 under
sections 365-B/376/34 of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860
registered at Police Station Kot Najibullah, District
Haripur.

2. The allegations against the present
accused/petitioner alongwith other co-accused, as per
narration in the F.I.R. is that on 21.12.2013 at 8.30
AM, he has abducted Mst. Rimsha Bibi, complainant
and committed rape with her.

3. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
parties heard and record perused with their valuable

assistance.
4 Perusal of record would reveal that
initially one Mst. Fozaia Bibi, stepmother of present
complainant has charged Mst. Hajra, Waqar and
Waaas for the abduction of Mst. Rimshah. However,
after her recovery, she recorded her first statement
before Judicial Magistrate-IV, Peshawar on
04.01.2017, wherein, she stated that she had left her
house three years before and was residing with her
friend, who has now refused to look after her and
stated that she be sent to Dar-ul-Aman due to threats
from her family, however, she did not charge anyone
in her statement. Thereafter, on 17.01.2017, she
lodged the present F.I.R in Police Station Kot
Najibullah against Mst. Razia Bibi, Ihsan Ullah,
Bismillah residents of Umar Khan Kallay Lachi Kohat
and one Shoaib resident of Haripur for her abduction
and commission of rape with her. The present
petitioner was neither charged in the F.I.R by the
present complainant nor in her earlier statement
recorded before the Magistrate on 04.01.2017. She
has neither given features of the accused/ petitioner in
the F.I.R nor she claimed that she could identify the
present petitioner if he would come in front of her.
She again recorded her statement on 20.02.2017

before Judicial Magistrate, Haripur under section 164
Cr.P.C and charged the present accused/petitioner
alongwith one Umar Ghani for committing rape with
her at different occasions, where they allegedly kept
her for three years. No identification parade of the
present accused/petitioner was conducted by the
police/prosecution. | Nothing incriminating _is
forthcoming on record of the case to prima facie
connect the present accused/petitioner with the
commission of alleged offence except divergent
versions of the present complainant. Moreover, mere
heinousness of an offence is not sufficient to refuse
bail to an accused when otherwise a case for grant of
bail is made out. Thus, in view of conflicting
statements of alleged abductee, the case of the
accused/petitioner becomes one of further inquiry in
the present circumstances of this case and therefore he
is held entitled to be released on bail.

5. The investigation in the case is
complete, as supplementary challan has been
submitted against the present accused/petitioner
and he is no more required to the police or

prosecution for further investigation.
6. The observations rendered hereinabove,
would not affect the mind of the trial Court in any
manner whatsoever, during trial of the case.
7. Consequently, this bail application is
accepted and the accused-petitioner is admitted to
bail, subject to his furnishing bail bonds in the sum of
Rs.100,000/- (Rupees One Hundred Thousands) with
two sureties, each in the like amount, to the
satisfaction of the ///aqa/Duty Magistrate, Haripur.
Above are the detailed reasons for short

order of this Court of even date.
