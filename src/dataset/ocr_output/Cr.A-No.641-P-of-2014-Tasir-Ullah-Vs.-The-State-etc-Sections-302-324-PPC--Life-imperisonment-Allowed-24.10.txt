directed against the judgment/order dated

convicted under section 302 (b) PPC and
sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for life;

and also directed to pay compensation of
Rs:100000/-under section 544-A Cr.P.C to the
legal heirs of the deceased, failing which, he

Cr.P.C. The appellant was, however,
acquitted of the charge under section 324
PPC, vide the same impugned judgment/order

dated 31.05.2014.

2. The case was registered in Police
Station Battagram, Charsadda, vide FIR
No.396 dated 28.08.2012 under sections
302/324 PPC on the report of Munir Khan,
complainant, who had brought the dead body
of his brother, Mehar Sayyab, to the Police
Station with the help of his co-villagers and
reported at 22:00 hours on 28.08.2012 to the
effect that he and his brothers Mehar Sayyab,
deceased, and Farhad Gul were proceeding
towards Sreekh Chowk from their home and
when reached the scene of occurrence, they
noticed the presence of their cousin, Tasir
Ullah son of Momin Khan, duly armed with

pistol, and opened fire at them on their sight,
causing the death of his brother, Mehar
Sayyab Gul, whereas they escaped unhurt.
The motive for the occurrence was cited as
quarrel earlier at evening time between the
accused/appellant and sister of the
complainant, Mst. Hina Bibi, married to
Sameen brother of the accused/appellant. The
occurrence was shown to have’ been
witnessed by the complainant and his brother
Farhad Gul. The complainant charged the
accused/appellant for the Qatl-i-amd of his
brother Mehar Sayyab and _ ineffectively
attempting at his life as well as at the life of his

brother Farhad Gul.

3. Following report of the complainant,
the deceased, Mehar Sayyab, was referred to
Battagram Hospital for autopsy, where the
Medical Officer (PW-2) conducted
Postmortem examination of the deceased and
found the following firearm injuries;
“1. There was firearm entrance wound
about 1/3 inches in diameter on left

cheek.
. There was firearm exit wound about 1/2
inches in diameter on the upper part of
right side of the neck.

. There was firearm entrance wound
about 01 inch in diameter on the lower
part of the thoracic spine with charring +
tears present in clothing.

. There was firearm exit wound about 1/2
inch in diameter about 02 inches below
and one inch medial to right nipple,
corresponding to wound No.3.

. There was firearm entrance wound
about 03 inches above and 03 inches
lateral to wound No.3 on the back of left
side of the chest and half inch in
diameter.

. There was firearm exit wound about 1/2
inch in diameter on the right side of the
mid part of the sterna. Tears present
and corresponding to wound No.5.

. Laceration about 2 x 2 inches on the
right side of the forehead, laceration

about 1 % x 01 inch on the root of the
nose and laceration about 2 x 1 %

inches in length and width respectively

each present on right cheek.”
In the opinion of the Medical Officer, “the
cause of death was injury to vital organ (liver,
lung and heart) accompanied by and
contributed to by injury to thoracic spine and
spinal cord caused by firearm leading to
shock, cardiopulmonary arrest and death’.
The probable time between injury and death
was shown in the PM report (EX.PW2/1)
within 15 minutes; and between death and

postmortem about 03 hours.

4. The investigation was entrusted to
Ikramullah Khan S.| (PW-9), who proceeded
to the spot, inspected the spot and prepared
the site plan (EX.PB). During spot inspection,
besides securing blood from the place
assigned in the site plan to the deceased,
Mehar Sayyab, the 1.0 also recovered four
empty shells of 30 bore from the place
assigned in the’ site plan to the

accused/appellant and an energy saver bulb
25 Volts shown lit on the spot at the time of
occurrence. The blood stained earth secured
from the spot and blood stained garments of
the deceased were dispatched to the FSL for
opinion of the chemical examiner, who found
the same as human blood and of the same
group. Likewise, opinion of the Firearms
Expert with regard to four 30 bore crime
empties was that the crime empties were fired
from one and the same 30 bore weapon. The
accused/appellant, initially, remained at large,
and was proceeded against under sections
204 and 87 Cr.P.C; but was, later, arrested on
14.03.2013; and a pointation memo was
prepared by the I.O on 16.03.2013, without
any recovery or discovery in consequence of
the so-called pointation of the
accused/appellant, who also refused _ to
confess his guilt when produced before the
Judicial Magistrate on the expiry of police
custody for a couple of days. After completion

of investigation, the local police submitted
complete challan against the

accused/appellant to the learned trial Court.

5. The learned trial Court framed formal
charge under sections 302 and 324 PPC, to
which the accused/appellant pleaded not

guilty and claimed trial.

6. In order to prove its case against the
accused/appellant, the prosecution produced
the following thirteen PWs, namely:-

PM examination of the deceased and

furnished P.M report (EX.PW2/1);

complainant and also prepared injury
sheet and inquest report (EX.PW3/1 and

marginal witness to the recovery memo
(EX.PW4/1), whereby, the |.0 took into
possession blood stained garments of

the deceased;

Fazal Subhan S.| (PW-5), conducted
partial investigation in the case after

arrest of the accused/appellant;

Saeed Khan Inspector (PW-6),

under section 512 Cr.P.C after
completion of investigation, and also
arrested the accused/appellant on
14.03.2013 and issued his card of arrest

(EX.PW6/1);

Mst. Hina Bibi (PW-7), sister of the

deceased, Mehar Sayyab;

Khan Sayyab (PW-8), is marginal
witness to the recovery memos of blood

stained earth, four empties of 30 bore
7.

and one electric bulb energy saver 25

volts recovered from the spot by the 1.0;

Ikramullah Khan S.I (Rtd) (PW-9),

conducted investigation in the case;

Munir Khan (PW-10), is complainant in

the case;

Farhad Gul (PW-11), is the eyewitness;

Amanullah DFC (Rtd) (PW-12), was
entrusted with service of warrant of
arrest under sections 204 Cr.P.C and

proclamation 87 Cr.P.C; and

Liagat Ali Inspector (PW-13), also
conducted partial investigation in the

case;

After prosecution closed its evidence,

statement of the accused/appellant was

recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein,

he refuted allegations of the prosecution

levelled against him, but declined to be

examined on oath or produce defence
evidence, followed by hearing of arguments of
learned Deputy Public Prosecutor for the
State assisted by learned counsel for the
complainant and that of learned counsel for
the accused; and, then, by the impugned
judgment dated 31.05.2014, whereby, the
accused/appellant was convicted under
section 302 (b) PPC and sentenced to
rigorous imprisonment for life, with direction to
pay compensation of Rs:100000/- under
section 544-A Cr.P.C to the legal heirs of the
deceased, failing which, to further six months
S.l; hence the instant Jail Criminal Appeal by
the appellant against his conviction and the
sentences awarded to him by the learned trial

Court.

8. Arguments of learned counsel for the
appellant, and learned AAG heard. Brother of
the complainant was present, but he preferred
to be represented by the learned AAG.

Record perused.
9. In the report/FIR lodged in the Police
Station by the complainant after 1 ”% hours o
the occurrence, the accused/appellant was
charged for firing at the deceased brother of
the complainant, namely, Mehar Sayyab, in
the presence of the complainant as well as his
other brother, namely, Farhad Gul, while they
were, reportedly, proceeding towards Sreekh
Chowk; however, the purpose of proceeding
towards Sreekh Chowk was not mentioned in
the FIR; and, lateron, explained by way of
improvements in the statements of the PWs to
the effect that the shops of the complainant,
the eyewitness and the deceased were
situated there; but the site plan does not show
their shops situated anywhere either in the
Sreekh Chowk or in that direction. The
occurrence took place at 08:30 PM on
28.08.2012, but no source of light was
mentioned in the FIR. However,
improvements in the statements of the PWs
were also made in this regard by showing an

electric bulb (energy saver) lit on the wall of
the house of Yousaf Shah. The said Yousaf
Shah was not examined as PW to lend
credence to the assertions of PWs in this
regard: and also strengthen version of the
prosecution regarding occurrence taking place
in the close proximity of the house and hujra

of Yousaf Shah.

10. The FIR was lodged by the brother of
the deceased and another brother of the
deceased and the complainant, namely,
Farhad Gul was cited as an eyewitness; but
neither the complainant nor his other brother,
Farhad Gul, received a single firearm injury
despite the site plan showing them in the line
of firing, which caused three firearms entry
wounds besides a laceration to their deceased
brother. On the other hand, motive for the
occurrence was mentioned as_ quarrel
between their sister married to brother of the
accused/appellants, namely, Sameen, earlier
at evening time; therefore, targeting one out of

three brothers, and sparing two others to
become complainant and eyewitnesses in the
case is something beyond comprehension.
Even the motive could not withstand cross
examination of the defence, as Mst. Hina Bibi,
sister of the complainant, deceased and the
eyewitness, categorically stated that the
accused/appellant did not quarrel with her on
the day of occurrence nor she had lodged the
report regarding that, as it was a family
matter. It may also be added here that Mst.
Hina Bibi had not given any statement to the
police in the case, according to her own
admission in her statement in the Court; but
she was, nevertheless, produced in the court
as PW-7, and she narrated a different story of
a quarrel taking place between her husband,
Sameen, and the accused/appellant on
account of the latter being jobless; and that
her intervention in the quarrel caused her
firearm injury on her right hand and thereafter
the accused/appellant, allegedly, also fired at
her brothers, resulting in the murder of her

brother, Mehar Sayyab.
11. The FIR lodged in the police station
was only signed by the complainant, Munir
Khan, but the so-called eyewitness Farhad
Gul also claimed to have reported the matter
to the police and his signature obtained on
that report, which is contrary to the factual
position, as the FIR does not bear his

signature even as a rider.

12. The blood stained earth collected from
the spot was dispatched to the FSL for
chemical analysis along with blood stained
garments of the deceased, but were received
in the FSL after about 13 days of the
occurrence on 10.09.2012: and, likewise, the
four empty shells collected from the spot by
the |.0 during spot inspection on 29.08.2012
were received for opinion of the Firearms
Expert in the FSL, Peshawar, after
considerable delay on 24.09.2012, making
both the reports of chemical examiner and
Firearms Expert hardly of any evidentiary

value for the case of the prosecution.
13. In the FIR, only the appellant has been
charged as the single accused for the qatl-i-
amd of deceased Mehar Sayyab, and report
of the Firearms Expert also shows all the four
30 bore crime empties fired from one and the
same 30 bore weapon, besides the site plan
showing the deceased and the
accused/appellant facing each other; but the
postmortem examination of the deceased
creates serious doubts about the FIR, site
plan and report of the Firearms Expert by
showing three different dimensions of three
entry wounds found on the dead body of the
deceased i.e. firearm entry wound No.1 of the
size and dimension of 1/3 inches on left
cheek, firearm entry wound No.3 about 01
inch in diameter on the lower part of the
thoracic spine with charring + tears present in
clothing, signifying firing from close range, and
firearm entry wound No.5 of the size and
dimension of 03 inches above and 03 inches

lateral to wound No.3 on the back of left side
of the chest and half inch in diameter. As
such, the different sizes and dimensions of the
three firearm entry wounds from different
directions and presence of charring + tears on
wound No.3 and 6 would not only suggest
firing by more than one person but also
negate the version of prosecution regarding
commission of offence by only one person i.e.
the appellant. The duration of 15 minutes
shown between injury and death in the
postmortem report would also raise question
about instantaneous death of the deceased

on the spot as alleged by the complainant.

14. Neither weapon of offence nor
anything incriminating was
recovered/discovered in consequence of the
so-called pointation made by _ the
accused/appellant, therefore, the pointation
memo prepared by the I.O is of no value for
the prosecution case. The appellant/accused
also did not record confessional statement

when produced by the police before the
Judicial Magistrate after expiry of two days

custody.

15. There are, indeed, contradictions in the
statements of the PWs, as Silwer Khan ASI
(PW-3) stated that he first reduced report of
the complainant in the shape of FIR and
thereafter prepared injury sheet and inquest
report of the deceased, without giving detail of
injuries on the person of the deceased on the
injury sheet; while, to the contrary,
complainant Munir Khan (PW-10) stated in his
statement before the Court that first the local
police prepared the injury sheet etc and then

reduced his report into writing.

16. In the wake of above stated scenario,
the absconsion of the accused/appellant
would be of no help to the case of
prosecution, being not only a corroborative
piece of evidence, but also not established in
the light of statement of Amanullah (Rtd) DFC
(PW-12), who failed to annex CNIC copies of

the attesting witnesses, prepare sketch of
house of the accused and also houses of the
attesting witnesses, who were neither Nazim

nor Councilors of the locality.

17. In the face of so much discrepancies,
contradictions and fatal improvements in the
case of the prosecution, there was no
justification for recording judgment/order of
conviction and awarding punishment of
imprisonment for life to the appellant. Besides,
the appellant was acquitted of the charge of
attempt at the life of the complainant and his
brother and eyewitness Farhad Gul, under
section 324 PPC vide the same impugned
judgment dated 31.05.2014, obviously, by
disbelieving their testimony, which, therefore,
could not be relied upon for conviction of the
appellant and award of sentences to him on

the basis of such discredited evidence.

18. Consequently, the appeal is accepted,
and while setting aside the impugned
judgment dated 31.05.2014 as well as

conviction and sentences awarded to the
appellant there-under, the appellant is
acquitted of the charge of qatl-i-amd of the
deceased; and he be set free, forthwith, if not

required in any other case.

Announced.
