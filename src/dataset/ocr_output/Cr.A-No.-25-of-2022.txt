14. Arguments heard and _— record
perused.

15. Before dilating upon merits of the
case, it seems beneficial to consider
whether any offence under section 17/18
read with section 22 of the Act is being
made out against the appellant. For that
purpose sections 17, 18 and 22 are
reproduced herein below: -

Section 17. Unlawful emigration, etc.-

himself or for any other person, any
money or other valuable thing, shall be
punishable with imprisonment for term,
which may extend to fourteen years, or

16. From the above provision, it 1s
abundantly clear that any person who
emigrate or depart or attempt to emigrate
or depart or causes or assist or attempts to
cause or assist any person to emigrate or
depart, in contravention of this Act, is to be
punished under section 17 (2) (b)(c) of the

11

which may extend to 14 years, for offence
of fraudulent inducement to emigrate.
Section 22 of the Act relates to the offence

of providing or securing to or for any
person employment abroad, being overseas
promotor or non-promotor, who receive or
attempt to reccive etc shall be punished to
imprisonment. which may extend to
fourteen years or with fine or with both.

17. In the present case, prosecution has
produced overwhelming evidence of the
persons who are direct effectees of the
false pretext of providing emigration and
job at Doha Qatar. Complainant Syed
Kazim Ali Shah recorded his detailed
statement and he was offered the job of
G.M petroleum Qatar, and in licu thereof,
the appellant and his wife had received
total amount of Rs. 65,00,000/- from him.
Similarly, other private witnesses were
also deceived and deprived of their money
on the pretext of work visas but they were

provided open visas. Syed Lutf Ali Shah
12

r/o Haripur, is among those persons, to
whom the appellant promised to provide
work visa and for that consideration, the
appellant received from him Rs. 300,000/-,
Rs. 310,000/- and Rs.1,00,000/- at
different occasions. Waleed Rizwan son of
Mushtag Ahmed was also promised by the
appellant for providing him work visa for
the post of Public Administrator in Qatar
and received handsome amount. Syed
Nasim son of Mazoor Ilussain resident of
Village Kamil Pur, Rehana, Tehsil &
District, Haripur was also deprived by the
appellant from an amount of Rs. 4,00,000/-
on the same pretext. All these affectecs
including complainant are residents of
District Haripur, while the appellant is
resident of Karachi, who came from
Karachi to District Haripur at Affaq Hotel
and conducted interviews of said persons.
Thus, the complainant and other private
witnesses/effectees have specifically
nominated the appellant for the offences

charged for.
13
18. Apart from the above oral evidence
of effectees, to prove the version of
complainant party, PW-6 Muhammad
Khalid Mayo SI/PS, FIA, investigating
officer, has brought on record sufficient
material in shape documentary evidence,
particularly Ex PW-6/14, Ex PW-6/16 and
ex PW-6/18. It is proved on record that the
appellant operate account No. 627873-
99330102064239, his wife Iffat Ghias
operates account No. 99330102998125,
and from time to time amounts were sent
to these accounts from the accounts of
Sumra Zafar, wife of complainant holding
account No. 000214280582. Ex PW-6/16
consists of number of deposit slips of
Meezan Bank, which clearly depicts that
wife of complainant Sumra Zafar as well
as other effectees have deposited millions
of rupees in the accounts of appellant and
his wife. Likewise, the Ex PW-6/18 also
reveals the payments of different amounts
through Western Union in favor of

appellant by the wife of complainant.
14

Similarly, complainant Syed Hasnain
Kazmi also send Rs. 2,00,000/- and Rs.
1,00,000/- in the account of appellant
through direct deposits from the Meezan
Bank G.T Road, Haripur vide Ex PW-6/16
and duly received in the account of
appellant. These are undeniable
documentary proof, which were obtained
through proper channel and brought on
record during investigation by — the
investigating officer, which could not be
shattered by the appellant.

19. Complaint was filed before Vederal
Investigation Agency on Ist June, 2019,
but despite issuance of summons, the
appellant did not joined inquiry, and even
after registration of case, the appellant
remained absconder for unexplained long
time. Similarly, his wife is — still
absconding, who has been declared
proclaimed offender by the competent
Court of law.

20. Not only the appellant is charged

in the present case but another criminal
case has also been registered against him at
Karachi vide FIR No. 307 dated:
30.04.2020 under section 489-F PPC at
Police Station, Share Faisal, wherein, the
complainant narrated that appellant had
received Rs. 6,60,000/- from him in order
to send his son to Qatar on work visa but
failed to do so and on demand for return of
said amount, the appellant issued two
cheques of Bank Al-Meezan,Gulshin-c-
Jauhar, Karachi, which were dishonored on
their presentation.

20. More-so, the complainant party
belongs to Haripur, while the appellant and
absconding accused are residents of
Karachi, therefore, no question of ill-will
on the part of complainant party or false
implication of appellant and his wife arises
in the case. It is argued by learned counsel
for appellant that the prosecution has not
produced Mst. Sumra Zafar, whose
account was used for transfer of amounts,
and presumption under Article 129 (g) of

Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, would
16

arise in favour of appellant, however,
except the fact that money was transferred
through her account, she did nothing in the
case. More-so, her husband has appeared
and has fully endorsed the sending of
amounts from her account. It is worth
mentioning that record Ex PW-6/18 was
brought on record without objection,
hence, transactions made from account of
Mst. Sumra Zafar have gone unrebutted,
hence, the objection of her non-
examination at this stage, when no
objection was raised at the time of
exhibition of such documents is not fatal to
the present case, especially, when
complainant has appeared and_ asserted
transactions by him directly into the
account of appellant through deposit slips.
21. ‘Thorough and careful examination of
the evidence on record shows that the
prosecution has successfully proved its
case against the appellant beyond any
shadow of doubt through reliable and

convincing oral as well as documentary
{

i

evidence and therefore, the convictions and
sentences recorded by learned _ trial
court/Special Judge Court [E:migration, KP,
Peshawar/Camp Court, Abbottabad are
based on proper appreciation of the
evidence on record, which cannot be
reversed or altered, which are hereby
maintained. At the same time, the quantum
of sentence is in line with the charge and
need no to be enhanced.

22. For what has been discussed above,
this appeal alongwith Cr. R No. 16-A/2022
are hereby dismissed, accordingly.

Announced.
