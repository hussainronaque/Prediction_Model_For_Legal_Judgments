3. | There is a similar relief for the grant
of bail in Cr.M B.A. No. 315-M of 2017
preferred by Umar Zeb accused/Petitioner, after
hearing learnec. counsel for the Petitioner,
learned counsel for brother of the deceased
Bahader Zeb and learned ~A.A.G for the State,
record with their valuable assistance gone

through.

4. The Petitioner being complainant
was present in his house with the corpus of his
brother Mahmood Zeb lying on the cot, reported
in the manner that on the doomful day his
deceased brother Mahmood Zeb was awaken by
his mother to offer fajr prayer in the mosque.
The deceased went out for offering prayer in the
mosque. The then complainant now
accused/Petitioner was busy in ablution, when
in the meanwhil e, at the relevant time on 04.45
hours he heard fire shots and when the
complainant went outside, he found his brother
lying dead in the thoroughfare near the house of
Ibrahim. But at that time there was no clue as to

who has killed his brother, therefore, no one
was charged even on account of suspicion. The
occurrence was unseen and un-witnessed. Later
Mst. Badshah Anwar mother of the deceased
recorded her statement before the learned
Judicial Magistrate under section 164 Cr.P.C
and thereby named the complainant/Petitioner
to have killed his son. Application for recording

statement of mother of the deceased was moved
on 15.04.2017 : and the said statement was
recorded on even date. Besides there is
statement of another PW brother of the
deceased and complainant inter se by the name
of Bahader Zeb recorded on 03.05.2017 under
narration of certain facts leading to involvement

of the’ Petitioner for the murder of his brother

Mahrnood Zeb. .

5. ; In the, case in hand, there is no one
named as to who has caused the murder of
deceased Mahmood Zeb, but upon implication
of the accused/Petitioner Umar Zeb by his own
mother when got arrested, he has recorded his
confessional statement before the Court: of

learned Judicial Magistrate-II Timergara Dir

Lower on 19.04.2017. This confessional
statement coupled with the recovery of crime
weapon on his pointation lead to an inference
that the Petitioner is cunning person by nature
who can be charged for causing disappearance
of evidence to screen himself from legal
punishment, thereby prima facie he is himself
responsible for the murder of his own brother

Mahmood Zeb.

6. On the ground of compromise if at
all his mother resiled from her previous
staternent recorded under section 164 Cr.P.C
and now does not charge the accused/Petitioner
still another brother of the deceased namely
Bahader Zeb is strongly opposing the grant of
bail in his favour. In this behalf the dictum
reported as PLJ 2000 Cr.C. (Lahore) 890
"Uz-Zaman, J._Mst. Zubaida Khanum vs
Muhammad Irshad Hussain and 2 others can
safely be referred, where all the Legal Heirs
have not forgiven the Petitioner, thus the benefit

of partial compromise cannot be extended at

statement of. the Petitioner, in the given
circurnstances who has tried to screen off
himself from committing the murder of his
brother when ample evidence is available in the
shape of confession and recovery of weapon of
offence. The case judgment cited as “Mst.

Zaheera Bibi vi the State and another" 2012

MLD 480 (Peshawar) may be referred to.

Besides in view of the judgment reported as

2014YLR_1771__(Supreme Court (AJ&K)
"Ameer Qaba'_vs_ State__of AJEK", the
Petitioner cannot be extended the concession of
bail because of his own conduct even if

tentatively assessed at bail stage.

7. In view of this report screening of
involvement of the  accused/Petitioner,
recording of his confessional statement and
recovery of weapon of offence on his
pointation, he does not deserve to be enlarged

on bail. Hence, this petition stands dismissed.
