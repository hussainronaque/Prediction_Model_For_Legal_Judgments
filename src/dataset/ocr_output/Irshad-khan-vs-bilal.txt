JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- Through this criminal
appeal, Irshad Khan, the appellant-complainant, has
questioned the order dated 24.06.2019, passed by the
Sessions Judge/Child Protection Court/Judge Juvenile
Court, Peshawar, whereby his application for transfer of
case/trial of accused/respondent, namely, Bilal from the
Court constituted under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child
Protection & Welfare Act, 2010, to the Juvenile Court
* under the Juvenile Justice System Act, 2018, has been
a ( turned down.
2. Facts in brief forming the background of the

instant appeal are that appellant is complainant of case FIR
No.775 dated 21.05.2016, registered under sections
302/324/34 PPC, at Police Station Chamkani, wherein he
besides co-accused has charged accused/respondent Bilal
for committing murder of Muhammad Naeem deceased, an
attempt to commit murder of Irshad Khan, Muhammad
Iqbal and Ashfaq and causing firearm injuries to
Muhammad Iqbal.
3. After arrest of the accused/respondent Bilal and
completion of investigation, he being a juvenile, challan
under the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000 was
submitted against him before the learned Juvenile
Court/Additional Sessions Judge-X, Peshawar on
05.10.2017, where he was formally charge sheeted on
05.10.2017 to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed
trial. The trial was in progress, when in the meantime,
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act,
2010, was promulgated, consequently, vide an
administrative order No.1655-73 dated 15.03.2019, of
learned Sessions Judge, Peshawar, all criminal cases
registered under the Child Protection & Welfare Act, 2010
and Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000 and Juvenile
Justice System Act, 2018, were entrusted to the Court of
‘ / Additional Sessions Judge, Peshawar, constituted as a
al special Court under the Child Protection & Welfare Act,
2010. The complainant/appellant submitted an application

to the learned trial/Special Court for transfer of the case to
i

the Juvenile Court, but the same was dismissed vide order
dated 24.06.2019, hence, this appeal.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record perused.

5. The only legal point in this case for consideration
and determination is whether accused/respondent Bilal,
who at the time of occurrence was below eighteen years of
age i.e. a juvenile, is to be tried by the Juvenile Court
constituted/established under section 4 of the Juvenile
Justice System Act, 2018 (to be referred hereinafter as the
“Act of 2018”) vide notification No.SO(Judl)/HD/Gen/P-
312/2020/Vol.I-I:- dated 29.01.2020, or the Special Court
constituted/established under section 15 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010
(to be referred hereinafter as the “Act of 2010”)?

6. Admittedly, both, the Act of 2010 and Act of 2018,
are having the status of Special Laws. The former is the
Provincial Legislation, whereas, the latter is enacted by the
Federal legislator. Preambles of both the Acts reveal that
these are dealing with child/children but in two different
situations. The Act of 2018, provides for criminal justice
system and social reintegration of juveniles, whereas, the
Act of 2010, has been enacted to provide care, protection,
maintenance, welfare, training, education, rehabilitation
and reintegration of “children _at_ risk” in the Khyber

Pakhtunkhwa. Under the section 2(h) of the Juvenile
Justice System Act, 2018 “Juvenile” means, a child who
may be dealt with for an offence in a manner which is
different from an adult while the purpose, aim and object
of the Act of 2010, is the protection, welfare, training,
education, rehabilitation and reintegration of the children

who are at risk and not accused, therefore, the same cannot

be stretched in such a way so as to give shelter to a
juvenile who is accused of an offence. “Child at risk” has
been defined under section 2(1)(e) of the Act of 2010, in

the following words:-

“Child at risk” means a child in need of
protection, who

(® is at risk, including an orphan, child with
disabilities, child of migrant workers, child
working and or living on the street, child in
conflict with the law and child living in
extreme poverty.

(ii) Is found begging; or

(iii) Is found without having any home or
settled place of abode or without any ostensible
meaning of subsistence; or

(iv) Has a parent or guardian who is unfit or
incapacitated to exercise control over the child;
or

(v) Lives in a brothel or with a prostitute or
frequently visits any place being used for the
purpose of prostitution or is found to associate
with any prostitute or any other person who
leads an immoral or depraved life; or

(vi) Is being or is likely to be abused or
exploited for immoral or illegal purposes or
gain; or

(vii) Is beyond the parental control; or (viii) Is

imprisoned with the mother or born in jail;
(ix) Has lost his parents or one of the parents
and has no adequate source of income; or 4

(x) Is victim of an offence punishable under
this Act or any other law for the time being in
force and his parent or guardian is convicted or
accused for the commission of such offence; or
(xi) Is left abandoned by his parent or parents
as the case may be, which will include a child
born out of wedlock and left abandoned by his
parent;

7. After going through preambles of both the Acts

(ibid) coupled with the meaning of “child at risk” under
section 2(e) of the Act of 2010 and “Juvenile” under
section 2(h) of the Act of 2018, it can be safely held that in
the instant case accused/respondent Bilal, being a juvenile,
does not fall within ambit of “Child at risk” rather, comes
within the meaning of juvenile under the Juvenile Justice
System Act, 2018. Had the appellant/complainant of the
instant case was a victim child within the meaning of
section 2(e) of the Act of 2010, and the accused/respondent
a Juvenile accused, then the case of the accused was to be
tried by the Court established under the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Child & Welfare Protection Act, 2010, but in
the case in hand, the situation is contrary. Here the
complainant/appellant is neither minor nor child, rather the
accused-respondent is a juvenile, obviously complainant
cannot be held as a “child at risk”, therefore, the
accused/respondent is to be tried by the Juvenile Court

established/constituted under section 4 of the Juvenile
6

Justice System Act, 2018. In essence any offence
committed by a juvenile or adult against a “child at risk” ,
shall be triable by the Court established under the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection & Welfare Act, 2010, while
an offence committed by a child against an adult shall be
tried by the Court created under the Juvenile Justice
System Act, 2018. The findings of the learned trial Court
in the impugned order are thus misconceived.

8. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed. The impugned
order of the learned trial court dated 24.06.2019, is hereby
set-aside. The case/trial of accused Bilal is withdrawn from
its diary and entrusted to the Special Court
established/constituted under the Juvenile Justice System
Act, 2018 for onward proceedings. The worthy Sessions
Judge, Peshawar, is directed to do the needful.

9. The Additional Registrar (Judicial) of this Court
shall circulate copy of this judgment amongst the Sessions
Judges/Juvenile Courts/and Courts established under the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act,

2010, in the entire Province for guidance.
