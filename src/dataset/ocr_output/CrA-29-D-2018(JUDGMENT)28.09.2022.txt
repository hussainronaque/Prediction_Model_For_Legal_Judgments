complainant, has called in question, acquittal of Abdul
Wahab, respondent/accused, through the subject appeal,
under Section 417(2-A) Cr.PC, whereof, the learned
Sessions Judge, Tank, on conclusion of trial of the
respondent/accused, charged in case FIR No.133, dated
15.6.2011, under Sections 302/34 PPC, of police station
Mullazai, Tank, recorded acquittal of the accused by

extending him the benefit of doubt.

Ghaffar Khan the then SHO police station Mullazai, Tank
with his team, including Aslam Khan HC, and Abdul
Wahab ATS/FC Police Force, District Tank. It was
averred that on 24.5.2011, he alongwith Rafiullah son of
Pasham Khan, Azad Khan and Adam Khan sons of
Mohibullah had gone to the landed property of his uncle
Ghaffar Khan for thrashing wheat crop and had overnight
stayed. Early in the next morning, after finishing the
work, they were proceeding to their houses. At about
sunrise time, they reached near their houses. The local
police was present there. The respondent/accused Abdul
Wahab and co-accused Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Aslam
Khan asked them to ‘hands up’, at which his nephew
Rafiullah tried to run away due to fear. The said three
accused started firing at Rafiullah as a result of it, he was
hit and died on the spot. Thereafter, the accused took the
dead body of Rafiullah alongwith them. The deceased was
empty handed and was not required in any criminal case
to the local police. The appellant/complainant and L.Rs of
deceased Rafiullah, made their every effort for
registration of proper criminal case but in vain and left
with no option but to approach the learned Ex. Officio
Justice of Peace/Sessions Judge, Tank, for appropriate
remedy. Application in this regard was floated and
accepted vide judgment & order, dated 14.6.2011,

alongwith co-accused Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Aslam
Khan were arrested and on completion of investigation,
challan was drawn and routed through the relevant

prosecution branch followed by sent up for trial.

4. On commencement of trial, copies of the
evidence (oral & documentary) delivered to the
respondents/accused. The accused were confronted with
the statements of allegations through formal charge, they
denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty and claimed

trial.

5. The prosecution to bring home charge
against the accused, recorded the account of 06 witnesses
and closed its evidence. At the conclusion of prosecution
evidence, the accused were examined under Section 342
Cr.PC. They professed innocence and false implication in
the case. However, neither they wished to be examined on
Oath as required under Section 340(2) Cr.PC nor wanted
to produce evidence in their defence. On conclusion of
trial, the learned trial Court/Sessions Judge, Tank, after
hearing both the sides, acquitted the respondent/accused

Abdul Wahab vide impugned judgment, dated, 22.3.2018.

6. It is worth mentioning that by the same
judgment, dated, 22.3.2018, co-accused Abdul Ghaffar

Khan and Aslam Khan were convicted under Section
-4-

302(b) PPC and sentence for life imprisonment with
payment of Rs.5,00,000/- as compensation under Section
544 Cr.PC to the legal heirs of the deceased or in default,

thereof, to suffer imprisonment for 06 months.

7. Needless to highlight, the convicted accused
approached this Court through an appeal bearing
Cr.A.No.13-D/2018 against their conviction & sentence,
it was accepted, vide order dated 11.9.2018, on the basis

of compromise, and consequently they were acquitted.
8. Arguments heard. Record perused.

9. The version of appellant/complainant is that
on 24.5.2011, he alongwith his nephews, Rafiullah son of
Pasham Khan, Azad Khan and Adam Khan sons of
Mohibullah had gone to the landed property of their uncle
Ghaffar Khan for thrashing wheat crop and have
overnight stayed there. On the next morning, in the early
hours, the threshing process concluded and they were
proceeding to their houses. At the fateful time about the
sunrise, when they reached near their houses, contingent
of the local police was noticed and_ the
respondent/accused Abdul Wahab and convicted co-
accused Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Aslam Khan were
commanded to ‘hands up’. Rafiullah, nephew of the

complainant attempted to run away due to fear. The police

party (accused) started firing at Rafiullah, as a result of it;

he was hit and died on the spot.

10. The post-mortem report (Ex.PM) of the
deceased speaks of a single entry & exit wound of 1/3” x
1” in diameter on his person. The I.O secured 19 crime
empties of 7.62 bore vide recovery memo Ex.PW-6/3
from the scene of occurrence, whereof, at the fateful time,
the police party has been shown to be present and
reflected in the site plan. During proceedings in
application under Section 22-A(6) Cr.PC, submitted by
the appellant/complainant before learned Ex. Officio
Justice of Peace, the accused had submitted their reply. In
para-7 of the said reply, it is averred that the
respondent/accused Abdul Wahab was posted in ATS
squad, he was having RPG rifle and no firing was made
from it. All the arms and ammunition issued to the
respondent/accused were correctly deposited in the

quarter concerned.

i. Daily diary No.18, dated 25.5.2011, of
police station Mullazai, Tank, and statement of Razaullah
Moharrir are part.& parcel of the case. It reveals that at
the relevant time, date and place of occurrence, Abdul
Ghaffar Khan SHO (convicted accused), Naqeebullah
ASI, Muhammad Aslam HC No.186 (convicted accused),

Constable Raees Khan No.88, Constable Zia-ud-Din

3S

-6-

No.48, Constable Hikmatullah No.376, Constable Shaukat
No.6516, Constable Majaz No.6483 and _ Driver
Hikmatullah No.363, members of police party were
present on the ‘scene of occurrence. However, the
investigation is silent about the presence of respondent/
accused at the fateful time on or around the scene of
occurrence. An iota of evidence has neither been collected
nor furnished during the trial which could prima facie
even. remotely speak of the presence of the
respondent/accused on or around the scene of occurrence
and have direct or indirect nexus with the commission of
offence. So much so, name of respondent/accused Abdul
Wahab does not find its mention even in the daily diary
and on this score alone the Court can safely observe that
the prosecution has been failed to substantiate through
cogent & worth reliable evidence not only the actual
presence of the respondent/accused on or around the
scene of occurrence but also his active and due

participation in the incident/commission of offence.

12. In the circumstances, the evidence so
collected during the investigation followed by furnished
during the trial is absolutely silent about the presence of
an accused person on or around the scene of occurrence,
what to say of his due participation in the commission of
offence, loud and clear his due involvement in the

incident with specific role and has not been substantiated,
oy

-7-

during the trial, the Court is left with no option but to give
him the benefit of doubt not as a matter of grace but as a
matter of right. For the good reason that benefit of doubt
is not a grace but right of the accused and it is not
necessary that there should be many circumstances
creating doubts, even a single circumstance, creating
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of
accused, makes him entitled to its benefit, not as a matter
of grace & concession but as a matter of right. Reference

is made to the case "Muhammad Akram y, State" (2009

SCMR 230).

13. Even otherwise, the order of acquittal cannot
be interfered with because the presumption of innocence
of the accused is further strengthened by acquittal. The
golden thread which runs through the web of
administration of justice in criminal cases is that if two
views are possible on the evidence adduced in the case,
one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to
his innocence, the view which is favourable to the
accused should be adopted. The paramount consideration
of the Court is to ensure that miscarriage of justice is
prevented. A miscarriage of justice which may arise from
acquittal of the guilty is less than the conviction of an
innocent. In a case where admissible evidence is ignored,
a duty is cast upon the appellate Court to re-appreciate the

evidence in a case where the accused has been acquitted,

-8-

or the purpose of ascertaining as to whether the accused
committed the offence or not. The principle to be
followed by this Court considering the appeal against the
judgment of acquittal is, to interfere only when there are
compelling and substantial reasons for doing so. If the
impugned judgment is clearly unreasonable, only then it is

a compelling reason for interference.

14. Above all, at the bar, neither any illegality,
material irregularity, jurisdictional defect in the impugned
judgment of learned trial Court has been highlighted nor
substantiated which could call for interference of the
Court in the impugned judgment of the learned trial
Court. It can safely be observed that the occurrence has
not taken place in the mode & manner so alleged and

attempted to be presented by the prosecution.

15. Consequently, this appeal having no merit

and substance stands dismissed.
