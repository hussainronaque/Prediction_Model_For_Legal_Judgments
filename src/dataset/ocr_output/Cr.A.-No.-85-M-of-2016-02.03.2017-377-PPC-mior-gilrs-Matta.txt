11. In order to deliver findings, it is extremely
important to refer to the applicability of section 376
PPC under which the charge has been framed. The
term 'Rape' has been defined under section 375 PPC,
which reads as under:

375. Rape.. A man is said to commit rape
who has sexual intercourse with a woman
under circumstances falling under any of the
five following descriptions,

(i) against her will,

(ii) without her consent,

(iii) with her consent, when the consent has
been obtained by putting her in fear of death
or of hurt,

(iv) with her consent, when the man knows
that he is not married to her and that the
consent is given because she believes that the
man is another person to whom she is or
believes herself to be married.

(v) with or without her consent when she is

under sixteen years of age.

12. This offence is punishable under section

376 PPC whereby if the contents of the rape are proved

would entail punishment with death or imprisonment

for either description for a term which shall not be less
“Nawab”

-10-

than ten (10) years or more than twenty-five (25) years

and shall also be liable to fine.

13. In order to constitute the offence of rape it

is necessary that there shall be penetration to constitute

sexual intercourse. In this case, Mst. Nabia, the victim

who is of very tender age likely to touch 9 years has

been examined by the female Medical Officer PW-7

Dr. Nadia WMO. Her statement would reveal that

there have been vaginal and perennial tears that have

already been stitched and the hymen has _ been

perforated and injured. Although the said lady Medical

Officer has been subjected to cross-examination at

length by the defence but this fact has not been denied

that even certain questions the answers of which are

given in her cross-examination would lead to an

inference that in-fact Mst. Nabia was subjected to

sexual intercourse in a very harsh manner leaving

behind stitched hymen being perforated and injured. In

juxta position, when the statement of PW-10 Lady Dr.

Naseem Begum who has earlier examined Mst. Nabia
“Nawab”

-1ll-
the complainant, the operation was conducted in the
form of operation notes, whereby stitching of vaginal
tears and procedure has been adopted deep vaginal tear
stitched with catgut No. 1/5 2™ degree tear stitched
with catgut No. 1/5. Hymen was absent vagina was
dilated.

14. It is now absolutely without any coloring
being found that Mst. Nabia was subjected to sexual
intercourse not only mere penetration to the hymen
was even found coupled with this brutal incident has
resulted into stitching that the procedure being
adopted.

15. Although, the Medical Officer PW-10
Dr Naseem Begum has been cross-examined to the
extent that such like injury can be caused when a girl
falls on the ground as has been stated by the said Mst.
Nabia to her mother. The Medical Officer PW-10 Dr.
Naseem Begum deposed during cross-examination that
there are many things that can cause a girl hymen to

tear other than intercourse, but in the case in hand, it is
“Nawab”

-12-

out of question to determine that the procedure being

adopted can be the result of a simple fall on the

ground. Therefore absolutely under section 375 PPC an

offence of rape has been committed with Mst. Nabia

which is punishable under section 376 of the Pakistan

Penal Code.

16. It is as next contended that that there is a

delay in lodging of the first information report which

would cast serious doubts in the prudent mind about

implication of the accused for an ulterior motives. In

this case the occurrence of subjecting minor girl Mst.

Nabia to sexual intercourse is said to have been taken

place at 7.30 A.M on 16.5.2015 and the matter was

reported at 14.30 hours on 18.5.2015 while the FIR

was chalked-out at 15.30 on the same day. Yes there is

delay of almost 55 hours which is covered round about

2 days. Yet there are reasons to believe that by the time

when Mst. Nabia was not examined by the Medical

Officer on 16.5.2015, but at the relevant time it could

not be said with certainty that Mst. Nabia was
“Nawab”

-13-

subjected to any forceful sexual intercourse as because

of fear she was unable to disclose this fact even to her

mother. The statement of Mst. Fazilat, PW-6 would

suggest that when her daughter came from Madrassa at

an unusual time her clothes and feet were stained with

blood. By that time she was then rushed to Medical

Officer who then on examination found her to be

subjected to sexual intercourse. Therefore in such a

situation it is very obvious that even if report has been

lodged with delay it will not bring complications and is

otherwise be not beneficial for an accused who has

been charged with offence the punishment of which

would entail to death penalty or imprisonment for

either description for a term which shall not be less

than ten years or more than twenty-five years and shall

be also liable to fine.

17. While developing his arguments learned

counsel for the accused/Appellant referred to medical

jurisprudence, whereby duration of retaining of semen

in vagina. Motile spermatozoa in the vagina of a living
“Nawab”

-14-

woman can be found over 100 hours after sexual

intercourse and non-motile spermatozoa as far as long

as 17 days. Spermatozoa may even survive longer in

the vagina of a dead woman. Yet FSL report for the

suspected liquid specimen of Mst. Nabia swab utilized

during the examination, report in respect of which has

been given in negative (Liquid specimen negative for

human semen in P1). So mere on this score alone

would not be a ground for acquittal as it is not

necessary that the accused/Appellant Abdul Haq might

have discharged inside the vagina, as there are reason

to believe in perforating of the hymen by the time

minor Nabia might have being unable to resist extreme

pain which has left the accused/Appellant to have

discharged outside. Thereby when the swabs were sent

for chemical analysis result of which have been found

in negative.

18. Apart from evidentiary value of the

solitary statement of the victim, conviction can be

awarded in rape/Hudood cases, on the sole testimony
“Nawab”

-15-
of the victim subject to the condition that the statement
of the victim must inspire confidence. In the case in
hand a minor girl of very tender age was subjected to
sexual intercourse as at the first instance she tried to
hide this fact from her mother that is why she
asserted to have fallen on the ground from a tree and
then later on disclosed the name of the
accused/Appellant to have subjected her to sexual
intercourse. Thereafter she was taken to the hospital
for medical checkup, thus how can a minor child of
the age of 9 years can mala fidely charge the accused
for such a heinous offence when she being tortured
for the sexual intercourse and the accused/Appellant
has been duly charged by the said minor Mst. Nabia
during her cross-examination-in-chief, so with all
probabilities she is believed to be a truthful witness.

19. Above all, learned counsel for the
accused/Appellant is of the view that there are

reasons to believe that the accused/Appellant is not
“Nawab”

-16-
behind such a heinous offence of committing sexual
intercourse with a minor girl Mst. Nabia. When he
recorded his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C with
regard to question No. 12 ( Atte Gs oly Gk 25 LS
$ 9%) he replied ( ALS 1255 CS alll caya ge Ue -U L Ge
(us WS chy Abs ts oly ile 4: SS ol -¥/), but in
respect of the question No. 13 Gat-% Us tlie 5) ai US)
(S98 al WS Ui he responded (U4 Gs). The
statement on oath of the accused/Appellant would
reveal that on the first instance he denied charges
leveled against him and posed innocence by
submitting the allegation against him is based on
false footing and it has been manipulated by the
complainant-party in order to grab money from him.
Had accused/Appellant been charged for such
offence on account of demand of money, the demand
must have been specific for certain amount which has
not been stated in the examination-in-chief. So, the

statement of the accused/Appellant Abdul Haq on
“Nawab”

-17-
oath is also not confidence inspiring thus leaving
room for his substantiated implication in the case in
hand.

20. Therefore, there is no persistence in this
appeal which is hereby dismissed. The findings of
the learned Court of Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi
Zila Qazi/Judge Juvenile Court Matta Swat are
absolutely decorously delivered for the sentence as
awarded.

Announced.
