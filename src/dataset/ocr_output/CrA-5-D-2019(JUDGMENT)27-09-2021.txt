| SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- Impugned here in
this appeal is the judgment dated 03.12.2018, rendered
by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Paharpur,
whereby the appellant was convicted under section
302(b) of Pakistan Penal Code and sentenced to life
imprisonment with Rs.50,000/-, (Fifty Thousand) as
compensation to be paid to the legal heirs of deceased
in terms of section 544-A Cr.P.C. or in default thereof,
to further undergo six months simple imprisonment.
He was further convicted under Section 404 PPC and
sentenced to suffer three years rigorous imprisonment

with a fine of Rs.5,000/- or in default thereof, to
-2-
further suffer seven days simple imprisonment. Both
the sentences were ordered to run concurrently,
however, Benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C was also
extended to the convict. The complainant Muhammad
Ameer, being aggrieved from the impugned judgment
has also filed Cr.R. No. 04-D/2019, for enhancement
of sentence of appellant. Since both the matters are the
outcome of one and the same judgment, therefore,
same are to be decided through this common
judgment.

2. The prosecution story as disclosed in the
first information report, registered on the basis of
murasila, is that on 29.01.2017 at 14:30 hours,
complainant Muhammad Ameer (PW-7), while
present with the dead-body of his son Ghulam Abbas,
reported the matter on the spot to Fazal Hussain Shah
ASHO (PW-1), to the effect that his son Ghulam
Abbas used to ply Qingqi Rickshaw from village
Bangrri to Nowshehra Morr; that on 26.01.2017, at
moming, his afore-named son took his Qingqi
Rickshaw from the house to earn his livelihood but
did not return till evening; that they searched for him
and also contacted on his cellular phone but with no

response as his cell phone was off; that after three
-3-
days, one Malik Zubair Jai informed them that the
dead body of his son was lying in his fields, in
response whereof, he rushed to the spot where he
found the dead body of his son Ghulam Abbas, with
blood oozed from his nose and mouth, his hands were
fastened behind with rope and another rope was also
tied around his neck. He charged unknown accused
for commission of the offence. Subsequently, during

investigation the accused were charged.

3. Since one of the accused was juvenile,

therefore, separate challans were submitted against
them before learned trial Court where at the
commencement of trial, the prosecution produced and
examined as many as fourteen witnesses, whereafter,
statement of the accused under section 342 Cr.P.C,
was recorded wherein he professed innocence and
false implication, however, neither he wished to be
examined on oath as provided under section 340(2)
Cr.P.C, nor opted to produce defence evidence.
Learned trial Court, after hearing arguments from both
the sides, vide the impugned judgment dated
03.12.2018, convicted the appellant and sentenced
him, as mentioned in the earlier part of the judgment,

which has been assailed by the appellant through the
-4-
instant appeal, whereas the complainant has filed the
connected criminal revision for enhancement of
sentence.

4. We have heard learned counsel
representing the appellant, Additional Advocate-
General assisted by learned private counsel at length
and with their valuable assistance, the record was
gone through.

5. The deceased a poor rickshaw driver left
his house for his livelihood, but did not return. His
family searched him in the area but could not succeed.
It was on 29.01.2017, when the complainant i.e. father
of the deceased received information regarding the
death of his son, whose dead body was left abandoned
in the fields of one Malik Zubair Jai. On receiving
information, the complainant reached to the spot
where he found the dead body of his deceased son
with a rope tied around his neck and his hands
fastened behind, with clotted blood on his face and
marks of violence on his body. The information was
received by the local police, who attracted to the spot
and the matter was reported by the complainant. The
complainant, while reporting the matter, disclosed that

it was on 26.01.2017, that his son (the deceased) left
-5-
the house with his Qingqi Rickshaw to earn
livelihood. As the incident was un-witnessed, so the
report was made against the unknown accused. The
injury sheet and inquest report were prepared and the
dead body was dispatched to the hospital for
postmortem examination. The Investigating Officer
attracted to the spot where he prepared the site plan
and also effected recoveries from the place of incident
including clotted blood, one pair of boot black in
colour, belonging to the deceased alongwith a sock.
The Investigating Officer also secured the foot and
boot prints from the spot with the help of plaster of
paris. He also received the postmortem report
alongwith injury sheet and inquest report of the
deceased, one plastic rope stained with blood, one
blood stained blue colour shirt and a bunyan of brown
colour, stripe printed, having brown colour, belonging
to the deceased.

6. The Investigating Officer kept on
investigating the case where he arrested different
suspects and it was on 08.02.2017, that the appellant
surfaced as accused when a mould collected from the
spot matched with his foot while in police lockup.

After gaining personal satisfaction, the complainant
-6-
charged the appellant/convicts on 08.02.2017, by
recording his statement under section 164, Cr.P.C.
The appellant/convicts were taken into.custody and it
was on their pointation that the Qingqi Rickshaw was
recovered from Tank, having been parked in the shop
of one Zia ur Rehman. The matter went on
investigated and it was during the investigation that
the appellant/ convicts, allegedly disclosed that how
the rickshaw was snatched and the deceased was done
to death. During the process of investigation, the
Investigating Officer initially recorded statements of
two witnesses, namely Sher Nawaz son of Ayaz Khan,
resident of Basti Ali Abad, Paharpur and also of one
Ajab Khan son of Abdullah Khan, resident of village
Abizar, District Tank, alongwith Zia ur Rehman son
of Mutee Ullah, resident of Ladha, Kanigurram,
Tehsil Ladha, South Waziristan Agency, in respect of
the incident and the recovery of the Qingqi Rickshaw.
Sher Nawaz was examined under Section 164, Cr.P.C.
before the Court of Judicial Magistrate, where he
stated that while on his way back in his Qingqi
Rickshaw from Paharpur to village Rangpur, when he
reached to Paharpur Adda, there he saw Irfan Ali and

Rizwan, who asked him to accompany them to
-7-
’ District Tank to repair and modify their rickshaw. He
further stated that while leaving for Tank, he called
his relative Ajab Khan, to arrange dinner for them,
they spent night over there and early in the morning
they proceeded towards Tank from village Abizar.
The colour of the rickshaw was replaced with green
from yellow by a painter at City Tank, therefore, they
went to the shop of a cushion maker, as they were
short of money, they parked their rickshaw in the said
shop, the accused returned to their village, whereas he
remained with Ajab Khan, at village Abizari, and
thereafter, came back to Paharpur. He further stated
that after 12/13 days, he was summoned by the local
police in connection of the murder of the deceased and
snatching of Qingqi Rickshaw, and he in the company
of local police, proceeded to City Tank, where-from
the said Qingqi Rickshaw was recovered by the local
police from the shop of Zia ur Rehman PW. Ajab
Khan, who recorded his statement under Section 164,
Cr.P.C. confirmed the events narrated by Sher Nawaz,
before the Court of Judicial Magistrate. The
Investigating Officer also recorded the statement of
PW Zia ur Rehman, under section 161, Cr.P.C, and

thereafter, was produced before the Court of Judicial
-8-
Magistrate to record his statement under section 164,
Cr.P.C, where he stated that he runs the shop of
cushion maker, in the name of “Ma Sha Allah Burki
Autos” at Tank City; that the convicts/appellant
alongwith Sher Nawaz, came to his shop alongwith
Qingqi Rickshaw for changing its cushions, he
estimated the cost as Rs.5650/- and changed the
cushion. The accused paid him Rs.1000/- and
promised the remaining to be paid after few days. He
further stated that he refused to honour the request of
the appellant/convicts and it was after 13/14 days, that
the police alongwith the accused and PW Sher Nawaz,
came to his shop and asked about the rickshaw, which
he handed over. The accused after their arrest faced
trial and was convicted by the learned trial Court vide
the impugned judgment. The learned trial Court dealt
with the matter comprehensively and as the entire case
against the accused is based on circumstantial
evidence, so the facts of the case were minutely dealt
with. The learned trial Court mainly relied upon the
recovery of the rickshaw, identification of the .
appellant/convicts and the last seen evidence. In order
to assess, as to whether the approach of the learned

trial Court is based on proper appreciation of
-9-
evidence, and that the learned trial Court applied its
judicial mind to the facts and circumstances of the
case, we deem it appropriate to re-assess the available
evidence, so that miscarriage of justice could be
avoided. There is no denial to the fact that the incident
went un-witnessed and that it was on collecting
evidence from different sources that the
appellant/convicts were implicated in the matter.
Keeping in view the peculiar circumstances of the
case, we deem it appropriate to assess different
aspects of the case and to see as to whether the
prosecution has succeeded in weaving different events
into an organic whole which turned the basis for
conviction. There is no denial to the fact that in case
of circumstantial evidence, the prosecution is under
the bounden duty to create a chain, that too, a well
connected net, so that one end will touch the body of
the deceased and other the neck of the accused, if that
coherence is lacking, then in that eventuality,
conviction cannot be awarded. The obligations in case
of circumstantial evidence is higher than those cases
where the witnesses come forward and depose.

7. To begin with, the incident went

un-witnessed. The moot questions to be determined by
-10-
this Court are, as to whether the incident occurred in
the mode, manner and at the stated time; and as to
whether the recoveries effected from the spot were
sufficient to connect the appellant/convicts with
commission of the offence; and as to whether the
rickshaw, allegedly recovered from the shop of one
Zia ur Rehman, was proved to be the ownership of the
deceased and as to whether the identification parade
was conducted strictly in accordance with the
procedure provided under the High Court Rules and
Orders as well as in the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984.

8. The record tells that initially the
Investigating Officer collected different suspects from
the surrounding area and that it was one of the
appellant whose foot matched to the mould collected
from the spot by the tracer. The police official who
collected the foot prints from the spot with the help of
plaster of paris was examined as PW-2, who stated
that soon after the recovery of the dead body he was
informed and directed to reach the place of incident
where on arrival he found hundreds of people present
there, alongwith the police officials including the

Investigating Officer. This is surprising to note that
-ll-
when a good number of people were present there,
how the tracer could collect and separated the one
which matched with the foot of the appellant. If we
admit that a host of people was present there, then
"instead of one, the tracer should have collected
numerous and in that eventuality it was incumbent
upon the Investigating Officer to invite those people
to identify their foot prints with those collected from
the spot, but the Investigating Officer did not take
pain to indulge in such an exhaustive exercise and this
lack of interest on part of the Investigating Officer
reacted upon the veracity of the collected evidence
from the spot.

9. The Investigating Officer though collected
evidence in respect of the Qingqi Rickshaw allegedly
snatched by the accused/appellant, but he failed to
collect its registration book and even he could not
collect any independent witness to confirm its
ownership. Neither father of the deceased nor any
other person produced the relevant documents before
the Investigating Officer. It is still a mystery as to
whether in fact the deceased owned and used to ply a
rickshaw. We are surprised to note that when the

accused were arrested and their statements under
-12-
section 164, Cr.P.C. were recorded, the accused
Rizwan, who was elder to Irfan, stated that while on
the way his younger brother complained of immoral
activity by the deceased and that it was for that
purpose the deceased was killed. If we say yes, to
what the accused stated before the Investigating
Officer, then the only purpose if any was to take
revenge and not to snatch the rickshaw. We are yet to
know that when PW Sher Nawaz was not on visiting
terms with the appellant, then what prompted him to
accompany the appellant and his brother to District
Tank and that what special interest he had to arrange
dinner for them in the house of his relative PW Ajab
Khan. Sher Nawaz was produced as PW-9. He stated
that PW Ajab Khan was his brother-in-law and during
the days of occurrence he used to ply a rickshaw and it
was because of his plying rickshaw in the vicinity that
he knew the name of the accused Irfan, whereas the
name of the co-accused Rizwan was disclosed to him
by the local police. He further stated that it was after
12/13 days, when the local police approached him in
respect of the incident. We are surprised to know that
how the local police came to know that this PW had

accompanied the accused for taking their rickshaw to
-13-
Tank. He further stated that though his statement was
recorded by the local police but he did not mention the
registration number of the snatched Qingqi Rickshaw.
Ajab Khan was examined as PW-10, who stated that
he also accompanied the appellant to Tank Bazaar,
where they visited the shop of Zia ur Rehman, a
cushion maker and that it was after 12/13 days that the
local police contacted him in respect of the incident.
This witness was cross-examined on material aspects
of the case, where he admitted that neither he
disclosed the registration number of rickshaw to the
Investigating Officer, nor the accused were known to
him, rather these were the accused who disclosed their
names to him. When this specific portion of his
statement is placed in juxtaposition with that of PW
Sher Nawaz, it surprises us that when PW Ajab Khan
was in the knowledge of the names of the accused as
these were disclosed to him by the accused while
staying at his home, then why PW Sher Nawaz did not
explain the same and that why it was through the local
police that he came to know the name of one of the
accused as Rizwan. The cushion maker Zia-ur-
Rehman was examined who stated that the rickshaw

was brought by the accused for replacing the cushions
-14-
and that it was due to deficiency of amount that the
same could not be replaced and that after some 13/14
days the local police alongwith the accused and PW
Sher Nawaz came to his shop and asked about the
rickshaw. The record is clear that none of these
witnesses were either on visiting terms with the
accused or they were previously known to them, but
the Investigating Officer did not take pains to request
for the identification parade of the accused through
these witnesses. We cannot ignore that the local police
allegedly recovered the rickshaw on joint pointation of
the accused and law is clear that the recovery effected
on joint pointation of the accused is inadmissible in
evidence and cannot be relied upon.

In case titled ‘The State through P.G.

Sindh and others Vs. Ahmed Omar Sheikh and

others’ it was held that:

“This single piece of evidence could
not be more than circumstantial
evidence, and would not alone, suffice
to prove that accused was guilty of
committing criminal conspiracy to
abduct deceased for ransom”.

10. The entire prosecution case rests upon the
identification parade conducted through Amir

Abdullah, who was examined as PW-13. We are to
-15-
see as to whether the said witness is independent and
as to whether he had seen the accused at the time of
travelling with the deceased in his rickshaw. There is
no denial to the fact that PW Amir Abdullah is the
close relative of the deceased and he hails from
District Bhakkar (Punjab). This witness was examined
as PW-13, where he stated that on 26.01.2017, while
present near village Hazara at ‘Maghrib Qaza Wela’
he saw the Qingqi Rickshaw of deceased Ghulam
Abbas, coming from Nowshehra Morr alongwith two
unknown persons. He further stated that one of them
was driving the rickshaw whereas, the other was
sitting on the rear seat with the deceased, on query he
was told that they were going to village Kotla on a
special trip. This witness explained that on the
following day, he came to know regarding missing of
Ghulam Abbas alongwith his rickshaw. He further
stated that it was on 29.01.2017, that he came to know
regarding the death of the deceased and as such, he
attended his funeral ceremony. We are yet to know
that when the witness had seen the deceased, that too,
in company of accused on 26.01.2017, what stopped
him to convey the same to the father of the deceased,

either on the day when he lastly saw the deceased with
-16-
the accused or on 29.01.2017, when he came to know
regarding the death of the deceased. When this
witness had not contacted father of the deceased and
had not shared his information with him, then how the
local police came to know that this PW was the person
who lastly saw the deceased in company of the
accused and that how the local police reached to his
house at Bhakkar and recorded his 161, Cr.P.C.
statement on 02.02.2017. During cross-examination,
he disclosed that he was informed by the complainant
on 14.02.2017 to reach Central Prison D.I.Khan to
attend the identification parade and that on the
following day he reached there. The prosecution is to
explain that whether this PW had lastly saw the
deceased in the company of the accused and as to
whether while making his statement, he disclosed the
physical features of the accused/appellant. His
conduct is not above board, as his presence, at the
time when he lastly saw the accused and deceased
together, is not established on the record. Even this
witness could not explain the purpose of his presence
and even the Investigating Officer did not collect
information from the place where this witness used to

work. The accused remained in constant custody with
-17-
police and even when father of the deceased reached
D.1.Khan and recorded his 164, Cr.P.C. statement, that
too, on the day when the accused were arrested, the
presence of the identifier with the complainant at the
time of charging the accused cannot be ruled out.
Even no precautions were taken by the Investigating
Officer to conceal the visibility of the accused from
the complainant and the identifier. As the complainant
and others constantly used to visit the police station,
where the accused were confined, so the possibility
cannot be excluded of their having been seen by the
witnesses prior to the identification parade. In such a
situation, the identification parade so conducted has
no evidentiary value, that too, through an interested
witness.

In case titled ‘Mian Sohail Ahmad_and
others Vs. The State and others’ (2019 SCMR 956),
it was held by the apex Court that:

“After the test identification parade,
the Court must verify the credibility of
the eye-witness by assessing the
evidence on the basis of the factors or
estimator variables discussed above.
Identification of an accused, therefore,
becomes a two-step process. First, the
suspects undergo a test identification
parade and second, the credibility of
the eye-witness is assessed by weighing
the evidence in the light of the
estimator variables”.
- 18 -

In the said judgment it was further held

that:- ,
66. "Last seen" evidence is merely a
circumstantial evidence, and that too a
weak type of evidence, which alone
cannot sustain the weight of a capital
punishment, and would require other
independent corroborative evidence to
effect conviction. In a case of murder,
where the prosecution case rests on
"last seen" evidence, then
corroboration would be required from
other circumstantial evidence; each
piece of such evidence would have to be
proved to complete the chain, stemming
from the accused being "last seen"
with the deceased, leading to his
death”.

11. The record tells that one Ghulam Hussain,
who finds mention in the calendar of witnesses and
was the person who allegedly saw the deceased in the
company of the accused was not produced during trial
and even he was not invited to participate in the
identification parade. We cannot ignore that he was an
independent witness. The non-production of PW
Ghulam Hussain, helps us in forming an opinion that
he was not ready to support the false claim of the
complainant. The other three witnesses namely Sher
Nawaz, Ajab Khan and Zia ur Rehman were the best
witnesses if the accused were put to identification
from these witnesses, but the Investigating Officer did
not take into consideration this material aspect of the

case.
-19-
12. It was stressed that the statements recorded
by the above mentioned witnesses provided strong
support to the prosecution story and that their
statements alone are sufficient to award conviction.
We are not persuaded with what the learned counsel
for the appellant submitted, as it is on record that none
of these witnesses were either on visiting terms with
the accused or the accused were known to them prior
to their arrest, so their statements cannot be taken to
connect the accused with commission of the offence,
that too, in absence of an identification parade
conducted from them. Had the accused been identified
from these witnesses, then the situation would have
been different. True, that the rickshaw in question was
allegedly taken into possession from the shop of the
cushion maker, situated at Tank, but without having
been identified, the statements of the witnesses cannot
be relied upon. The conduct of PW Sher Nawaz is not
natural, as he admitted during his cross-examination
that the accused were not previously known to him,
then what compulsion he felt to accompany the
appellant to the house of his relative, and thereafter, to
Tank to repair the snatched rickshaw. The cumulative

effect of the above-stated circumstances helps us in
-20-
forming an opinion that a conscious attempt was made
by the Investigating Officer to connect the accused
with commission of the offence and the conduct of the
Investigating Officer is not above board as it was he
who disclosed the name of accused Rizwan to the
witnesses.

13. The prosecution despite hectic efforts
could not succeed in creating a chain and that no
reliable evidence was produced in that respect, more
particularly the ownership of the snatched rickshaw
has not been established on record. In such situation,
this Court is left with no other option but to hold that
the prosecution could not succeed in bringing home
guilt against the appellant. The impugned judgment is
suffering from inherent defects and the reasons
advanced therein do not appeal to a prudent mind,
what to say to the judicial mind of this Court, calls for
interference. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed, the
conviction and sentence awarded to the appellant by
learned trial Court vide the impugned judgment is set
aside and the accused/appellant is acquitted of the
charges levelled against him. He be set free, forthwith,
if not required to be detained in jail in connection of

any other criminal case. Since we have set aside the
-21-
impugned judgment and acquitted the accused, so in
such eventuality the connected criminal revision for
enhancement of the sentence, bearing No.04-D of
2019 cannot proceed further, being bereft of merit is,
therefore, dismissed.

14. Above are the detailed reasons of our short
order of even date.
