JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.-

My this common judgment shall dispose of the

instant bail petition, filed by petitioner Sultan

Zeb for his release on bail in case FIR

No.8/2013, registered under sections

409/420/477-A/109 PPC and Sections 3 and 4

Anti Money Laundering (AML) Act, 2010, in

Police Station FIA, Peshawar and connected

Cr.Mise.BCA  Nof.1157-P/20134, _ titled,

“Muslim Commercial Bank Limited Vs

Anwar Zeb etc”, filed by Muslim Commercial

Bank/petitioner for cancellation of post arrest

bail of respondent-accused Anwar Zeb, in the

aforesaid FIR, granted by learned Judge Special

Court (Offences in Banks) Khyber

Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar vide order dated

25.07.2013.

2. The prosecution case is that complainant

Pir Tahir Muhammad, Branch Manager MCB,

Limited Topi Branch, District Swabi, through

his written complaint dated 02.01.2013, reported

to local police qua — embezzlement/

misappropriation of huge amount from the

aforesaid Bank by Cashier Anwar Zeb

(petitioner herein) through flying entries/ illegal

transactions from the accounts of various

customers to his personal joint Account titled

Zahir Shah/ Anwar Zeb No.030102010051555;

that to conceal his illegal activities, he also

changed the position of CCTV Camras of the

Bank. The complainant was referred to FIA on

which inquiry was conducted. Later on, during

audit process, amount of Rs.34.355 million was

found embezzled through flying entries from

one account to the other without any voucher,

cheque or instrument etc followed by transfer of

the same to account of Zahir Shah and

Anwarzeb, which amount has been withdrawn

by accused/respondent Anwar Zeb from the said

account, hence, The Director FIA Khyber

Pakhtunkhwa Hayatabad vide Ref.Gen/2 dated

28.01.2013, recommended for registration of

FIR against Anwar Zeb and others involved in

the commission of misappropriation of the huge

amount of different customers from the bank,

hence, this case.

3. The instant bail petition was argued

from both the sides on merits, however, in

connected Cr.Misc.BCA No.11557-P/2013, a

preliminary legal objection was raised by

learned counsel for the respondent-accused

regarding its maintainability that since the

matter falls within the ambit of the Offences in

Respect of Banks (Special Courts), Ordinance,

1984, and the same being a special law dealing

with the offences relating to Banks, having

overriding effect over the general law as

provided under S.12, provisions of section 497

(5) cannot be invoked, therefore, the bail

cancellation application being not maintainable

is liable to be dismissed straightaway.

4. Conversely, learned DAG and learned

counsel for the petitioner contended that though

there is no specific provision for cancellation of

bail under the Offences in Respect of Banks

(Special Courts), Ordinance, 1984, but at the

same time there is no bar in having recourse to

the provision of general law in the Ordinance

ibid when the Special Law is silent on a point;

that Cr.P.C. is applicable as there is no specific

bar or prohibition of provisions of $.497 Cr.P.C.

in Offences in Respect of Banks (Special

Courts) Ordinance (IX of 1984). They

contended that this court has power to hear and

dispose of the bail cancellation on merits.

5. After hearing the respective submissions

advanced from both the sides on the aforesaid

legal point, I am of the view that Criminal

procedure Code, 1898, though is meant

primarily to regulate the investigation, inquiry

and trial under the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 in

terms of S.5 (1) Cr.P.C., but it stipulates an

exception in terms of S.5 (2) Cr.P.C. Mandate of

S.5 (2) Cr.P.C. is that persons who are

proceeded against under the Special Law, shall

be dealt with and their cases inquired into,

investigated and tried according to the procedure

laid down in the said Special law, but in a

situation where an enactment provides a special

procedure only for some matters then such

matters would be dealt with according to the

procedure laid down in the said Special Law, but

where, the Special Law is silent on any matter,

the provisions of Criminal Procedure Code 1998

shall apply. Control of Narcotic Substances Act,

1997, is a Special Law and S.51 of the Act ibid,

deals with the matter of bail, but has been held

by the august Supreme Court in case titled,

“The State through Deputy Director Anti

Narcotic Force Karachi Vs Syed Abdul

Qayum” that despite prohibition contained in

S.51 of Control of Narcotics Substances Act,

1997, the Sessions Court and the High Court had

the powers to grant bail as applicability of

S.496, 497 and 498 Cr.P.C. has not been totally

barred in respect of cases under the said Act.

Same is the view of the Apex Court in case

titled, “Gul Zaman Vs the State” (1999

SCMR 1271). Same is the position in the case

in hand, if the Offences in Respect of Banks

(Special Courts) Ordinance, is silent qua

cancellation of bail, provision of section 497

Cr.P.C. can be invoked. Accordingly, the

preliminary objection of the learned counsel for

the accused/respondent being not sustainable, is

hereby turned down.

6. Now coming to the merits of the case. It

appears from the record that respondent-accused

Anwar Zeb, who has been granted bail on the

sole ground of non-recording of statement of

Chowkidar of the Bank by the learned Trial

Court, was the cashier of the bank during the

days of incident and a huge amount of

Rs.34.355 million has been embezzled through

flying entries from one account to the other of

various customers, without any voucher, cheque

or instrument etc followed by transfer of the

same to his account, and later on, withdrawing

the same from his account

No.030102010051555. As regard petitioner

Sultant Zeb, he is uncle as well as father-in-law

of accused/respondent Anwar Zeb and sufficient

evidence has been collected during investigation

that petitioner Sultan Zeb had has spoiled

sufficient money in gambling, which amount

had been obtained by him from different people,

and respondent-accused Anwar Zeb in order to

save the skin of his uncle/ father-in-law cheated

the bank/ embezzled a huge amount in millions

through Flying entries. On tentative assessment

of the material on record, the connivance of both

the accused with each other is visible, hence,

they are prima facie connected with the

commission of offence. The learned Trial Court

has erred in law while granting bail to

accused/respondent Anwar Zeb.

6. No doubt, besides merits, petitioner

Sultan Zeb has also agitated for his release on

bail on medical ground i.e. being a chronic heart

patient, but he has not annexed any document to

show previous history of his disease nor has

been examined by the Standing Medical Board.

During the course of arguments, learned counsel

for the petitioner was confronted with the

aforesaid ground, but he did not request for

examination of the petitioner through a Standing

Medical Board, therefore, in absence of any

authentic report qua illness of the petitioner by

any Standing Medical Board or any report from

the concerned Jail authorities about deficiency

of proper treatment to meet the requirement of

illness of the petitioner, therefore, any findings

of this court on this ground would be premature.

7. Accordingly, the instant petition of

petitioner Sultan Zeb being without merits

stands dismissed while connected Cr.Misc.BA

No.1157-P/2013, is accepted. Impugned_ bail

granting order dated 27.05.2013 is hereby

re-called. Accused/Respondent Anwar Zeb

present in the Court is taken into custody and

sent to Judicial Lockup. His sureties are

absolved from liability of bail bonds.
