JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- At a trial

held by learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Swabi,
appellants (1) Faqir Said (2) Taimur Said and
(3) Daud Said, were found guilty of committing the
Qatl-e-Amd of deceased Fazal Mehmood, thus, vide
judgment dated 27.09.2011, each of them was convicted
under section 302 (b) PPC and sentenced to undergo
life imprisonment and to pay Rs.50,000/-, as compensation

to LRs of the deceased in terms of $.544-A Cr.P.C. or in

default thereof to undergo 06 months S.I. further. Benefit of

S.382-B Cr.P.C. has been extended to them.

2. Through the instant appeal, the appellants have

questioned their conviction and sentences, while connected

Criminal Revision Petition No.184-P/2011,

titled, “Behramand Vs Fagqir Said etc”, has been filed by

petitioner Behramand for enhancement of sentence of the

convicts from life imprisonment to normal penalty of death.

Since both, the appeal as well as the revision petition, are

stemming out from one and the same judgment of the

learned Trial Court dated 27.09.2011, therefore, we intend

to dispose of the same through this common judgment.

3. The epitome of the prosecution case is that on

01.03.2010 at 1305 hours, Fazal Mehmood deceased then

injured reported to Safdar Khan ASI (PW.11), in Kalu

Khan hospital Swabi, that on the fateful day, he alongwith

his brother Farman Ali, was present in front of his house,

when in the meantime at 1245 hours, Daud Said, Faqir Said

and Taimur Said sons of Purdil, residents of village

Tarlandi Mohallah Shakai (appellants-convicts herein),

came there; that on his query qua their visit to their village,

the appellants got infuriated and opened fire at him with

their respective pistols with the intention to commit his

Qatl-e-Amd, as a result he got hit and sustained injuries.

After commission of the offence, the appellants decamped

from the spot. Previous ill will has been alleged as motive

behind the incident. Report of the deceased then injured

was taken down by Safdar Khan ASI (PW.11), in the shape

of murasila Exh.PA/1, endorsed by Dr. Jamal Khan and

verified by Farman Ali (PW.7). He prepared injury sheet

Exh.PW.5/1 of the injured and referred him to Medical

Officer for examination. After administration of first aid,

the deceased then injured was directed to be shifted to

Mardan hospital, but he succumbed to injuries on the way

therefore, PW.11, prepared his inquest report Exh.PW.5/4

and shifted his dead body to the mortuary for postmortem

examination.

4. Dr. Ajmal Khan Medical Officer (PW.5), on

initial examination of the deceased then injured on

01.03.2010 at 1.05 p.m., found the following injuries on his

person:-

1. Firearm entry wound about ’2 MM in diameter
on the epigastrium.

2. Firearm exit wound about 1 mm in diameter on
back.

3. Firearm entry wound about 2 mm in diameter on
right lower chest wall.

4. Firearm exit wound about 1 mm in diameter on
the back .

5. Firearm entry wound about 2 mm in diameter on
the abdomen.

6. About 1-2 mm lacerated wound on the abdomen

(skin deep).

The patient was fully conscious in time, space and person.

He was oriented. Because of non-availability of expert

surgeon, patient was referred to DHQ hospital Mardan.

Nature of Injuries: firearm-dangerous.

Weapon used: firearm.

Probable duration between injuries: 2 to 01 hours.

On expiry of the deceased then injured, the same

Medical Officer, on the same day at 1.45 p.m., conducted

autopsy on his dead body and found the same wounds on

his person as referred above.

Opinion:

According to opinion of the doctor, cause of

death of the deceased was firearm injuries to his vital

organs like lever and major blood vessels leading to shock

and death.

Probable time between injuries and death has been given as

1 to 2 hours while between death and postmortem as | to 2

hours.

6. Namir Khan SI (PW.8) conducted investigation

in the case. He proceeded to the spot and during spot

inspection recovered four empties of 30 bore vide recovery

memo Exh.PC. He also took into possession a phial

containing spent bullet sent by doctor, extracted from the

dead body of the deceased at the time of autopsy, alongwith

his bloodstained clothes vide recovery memo Exh.PC/1,

prepared site plan Exh.PB at the instant of eyewitness, and

recorded statements of the PWs under section 161 Cr.P.C.

Accused-appellant Taimur Said was arrested by Sultan

Mehmood Khan ASI near GHS Mansabdar on Mardan

Swabi road alongwith 30 bore pistol with loaded charger

containing 6 live rounds and a separate case under

sectionl3 of the Arms Ordinance, was registered against

him. Similarly, Khalid Iqbal ASI arrested accused-appellant

Faqir Said on the same day of incident i.e. 01.03.2010 at

1540 hours near Shaheed Baba village Mansabdar and

recovered from his possession 30 bore pistol No.C.9040

with loaded charger containing 4 live rounds, issued his

arrest card Exh.PW.1/1. Both the accused-appellants named

above, were handed over to Namir Khan SI alongwith the

recovered pistols from them, which he took into possession

by him vide recovery memos Exhy.PW.8/3 and

Exh.PW.8/4. During interrogation, both the appellants

disclosed about the recovered pistols to be the crime

weapons, therefore, I.O. sent the same to the FSL alongwith

crime empties vide application Exh.PW.8/8, report whereof

is Exh.PL/1. He initiated proceedings under sections 204

and 87 Cr.P.C. against absconding co-accused/appellant

Daud Said and after completion of investigation submitted

challan against the accused. Later on, accused/appellant

Daud Said was also arrested; therefore, supplementary

challan was submitted against him.

7. The learned Trial Court on receipt of the

challans, formally charge sheeted the appellants, to which

they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To prove its case

prosecution examined as many as eleven witnesses. After

closure of the prosecution evidence, statements of the

appellants were recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C.,

wherein they denied the prosecution allegations and

professed their innocence. They, however, declined to be

examined on oath under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. or to

produce evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial, learned

trial Court after hearing both the sides, convicted and

sentenced the appellants, as mentioned above.

8. Learned counsel for the appellants argued that

appellants are innocent and have been falsely implicated in

the case on mere suspicions; that the occurrence is unseen

and PW Farman Ali being real brother of the deceased is a

procured witness; that keeping in view injuries on vital

parts of the body of the deceased, it cannot be believed that

he was able to talk, therefore, his alleged initial report being

a fictitious and fabricated document, learned Trial Court,

has wrongly considered the same as a dying declaration;

that the charge has been exaggerated as three real

brothers/appellants have been implicated while the incident

seems to be the doing of single person and that who was

that single person, the prosecution has badly failed to prove

the same; that recovery of alleged crime weapons from the

two appellants is highly doubtful and the same has been

planted against them, therefore, positive FSL report in

respect thereof would not advance the case of the

prosecution; that nothing incriminating has been recovered

from possession of appellant Daud Said; that in such like

cases, the Court is always required to seek corroboration

qua each accused, but no such evidence has been brought

on record; that in absence of direct evidence, mere

recovery of blood from the spot, bloodstained garments of

the deceased coupled with serologist report and autopsy

report of the deceased, being only confirmatory and

corroborative pieces of evidence would not be sufficient to

prove the guilt of the appellants; that the impugned

10

judgment being against the law, facts and evidence

available on record, is therefore, liable to be set aside.

9. Conversely, learned AAG assisted by learned

counsel for the respondent contended that all the appellants

have been directly charged by the deceased then injured in

his dying declaration, recorded in accordance with law in

presence of Medical Officer, PW Farman Ali as well as

Safdar Khan ASI (PW.11) the author of the report; that all

these PWs have proved in their statements that the deceased

then injured at the time of making report was fully

conscious, well oriented in time and space and able to talk;

that being a broad daylight incident, took place near the

house of the deceased then injured, question of mistaken

identity does not arise and presence of PW Farman Ali with

the deceased at the time of incident does appeal to a prudent

mind; that not a single suggestion has been put on the above

named PWs by the defence to question the condition of the

deceased then injured that he was unable and incapable to

11

make a statement/talk; that dying declaration of the

deceased then injured is corroborated by ocular account

furnished by Farman Ali PW.7, arrest of the two appellants

on the same day alongwith crime weapons, positive FSL

report qua the empties and recovered pistol from their

immediate possession, positive Serologist report qua the

blood recovered from the spot and bloodstained garments of

the deceased; that mere non-recovery of crime weapon from

appellant Daud Said would not exonerate him from the

commission of offence as he after the incident went into

hiding and destroyed the prosecution evidence, therefore,

he cannot get premium of his unexplained noticeable

abscondance. They contended that the learned Trial Court

by properly evaluating and appreciating the evidence, has

reached to a right conclusion by holding the appellants guilt

of the offence to which no exception can be taken. They,

however, added that when the guilt of the appellants was

proved upto the hilt and there was no mitigating

12

circumstance, the learned Trial Court ought to have

awarded them normal penalty of death. They sought

dismissal of the appeal and requested for enhancement of

sentence of the appellants.

10. We have given our anxious consideration to

the respective arguments of learned counsel for the parties

and learned AAG for the State. Record perused with their

able assistance.

11. It is cardinal rule in the law of evidence that

the direct evidence is the best evidence, having great

probative force, as it is original, positive and is pregnant

with fresh and firsthand knowledge. Law makes great

emphasis on the production of direct evidence and it is

mandatory to rely upon the same if forthcoming. The word

“direct” is opposed to mediate or alternate or what is

technically called hearsay or second hand knowledge.

Principles of necessity have successfully been able to carve

its way to get admissible derivative or second hand proofs

13

to be receivable in evidence. Article 46 of the Qanun-e-

Shahadat Order, 1984 is one of the most important Article,

making way to the use of hearsay evidence. It provides

cases in which statement of relevant fact by a person who is

dead or cannot be found is relevant. According to this

Article, statements written or verbal, of relevant facts made

by a person who is dead or who cannot be found, or who

has become incapable of giving evidence or whose

attendance cannot be procured without any amount of delay

or expense which under the circumstances of the case

appears to the Court unreasonable, are themselves relevant

fact. It is an established rule of evidence that hearsay

evidence is not admissible but this Article is an exception to

the said rule.

12. We would like to first take the initial report of

the deceased then injured Fazal Mehmood Exh.PA/1, so as

to determine whether the same has been recorded in

accordance with law and can be termed as a dying

14

declaration, and if yes, to what extent it finds corroboration

qua each accused. Dying declaration is a statement of

deceased person as to his cause of death when he is at the

point of death. Sanctity is attached to a dying declaration

because a dying man is not expected to tell lies, but being

weak kind of evidence, it required close scrutiny and

corroboration. Some of the well known tests for

determining the genuineness of dying declaration are

whether it rings true, whether the dying man was capable of

making it, whether it was free from outside prompting and

was not inconsistent with other evidence, facts and

circumstances of the case. Dying declaration is a

substantive piece of evidence and if the Court is satisfied

about its genuineness, it can be acted upon without any

corroboration. Dying declaration where possible should be

recorded by a Magistrate, and if Magistrate is not available,

injured should be examined by a medical Officer to

ascertain fact that he was fit to make statement. To find out

15

truth or falsity of a dying declaration a case is generally

considered in all its physical environment and

circumstances. It is necessary to find out how far the

evidence or its different parts fit in with the circumstances

and possibility that can safely be deducted in a particular

case. Therefore, in order to pass the test of reliability, a

dying declaration has to be subjected to a very close

scrutiny, keeping in view the fact that such statements are

made in absence of an accused, which has no opportunity of

testing the veracity of the statement by cross examination.

But once the Court comes to the conclusion that dying

declaration is the truthful version as to the circumstances of

the death, conviction can be recorded on such dying

declaration alone.

13. It appears from the record that incident took

place at 12.45 p.m. near the house of deceased then injured

situated in village “Doob Lakhtai” Kalu Khan, which has

been reported with promptitude at 1.05 p.m. i.e. one hour

16

and 05 minutes, eliminating possibility of consultation and

deliberation. Dr. Ajmal Khan Medical Officer (PW.5), who

examined the deceased then injured at first instance at 1.05

p-m. has clearly mentioned in medico legal report of the

deceased then injured that he was fully conscious in time,

space, and person and well oriented. Farman Ali (PW.7),

rider of report of the deceased then injured in his statement

categorically stated that deceased then injured was fully

conscious and able to talk at the time of report. Similar is

the statement of Safdar Khan ASI (PW.11), the author of

report. He has mentioned in clear words in murasila report

Exh.PA/1 about consciousness of the deceased then injured

at the time of report. The report of the deceased then injured

bears the endorsement of Medical Officer, who examined

the injured. In cross examination Medical Officer (PW.5)

deposed that report of the deceased then injured bears his

attestation which means that it was drafted in his presence.

These three PWs have been subjected to cross-examination

17

by the defence but failed to create any dent in their

testimony. They all are consistent with each other on the

point of consciousness of the deceased then injured and his

ability to talk at the time of report. Not a single suggestion

has been put by the defence on these PWs to question the

condition of the deceased then injured that he was unable

and incapable to talk at the time of report because of his

injuries. Rather from the statement of these PWs,

particularly, medical Officer, it has been squarely

established that deceased then injured was fully conscious,

in time, space and in person as well as oriented and was

capable to talk and make statement. The report of the

deceased then injured has been reported in presence of

Police Officer, Medical Officer and PW Farman Ali in

accordance with law coupled with the fact he was fully

conscious to make a_ statement, therefore, we are firm in

our view that report of the deceased then injured can be

held as a “Dying declaration”.

18

14. The next moot question before us would be as

to what extent the dying declaration of the deceased then

injured get corroboration from other circumstances of the

case. Since, for single deceased three accused have been

charged, therefore, corroboration qua each accused would

be the essential criteria. The ocular account furnished by

PW Farman Ali, corroborates the dying declaration of the

deceased. No doubt, he has not sustained any injury in the

incident but it is equally true that it is not the case of the

prosecution that the accused also fired upon him. All the

appellants are specifically charged for firing at the

deceased. The incident took place in front of house of the

deceased then injured, therefore, presence of PW Farman

Ali, being brother of the deceased, at the time of

occurrence with the deceased does appeal to mind. As per

autopsy report of the deceased, he sustained three firearm

entrance wounds and a lacerated wound while three

appellants, who are brothers inter-se, have been charged

19

for the occurrence. The dimension of all the entrance

wounds is one and the same i.e. % mm, but since one and

the same weapon i.e. 30 bore pistol has been attributed to

all the appellants, therefore, we cannot hold these injuries

to be the job of single person, particularly, in presence of

positive FSL report qua the crime empties and two pistols

recovered from appellants Faqiar Said and Taimur Said,

who were arrested on the same day of occurrence, which

squarely corroborates the dying declaration and ocular

account to prove the participation of the two appellants

Faqiar Said and Taimur Said in the commission of offence.

The recovery of blood from the spot, bloodstained

garments of the deceased coupled with positive Serologist

report confirm the crime venue as alleged by the

prosecution. The recovery of pistols from immediate

possession of both the appellants has been squarely proved

by the prosecution through cogent and confidence inspiring

20

evidence of the PWs, who have no enmity or ill will with

the appellants to falsely implicate them.

15. As regard the role of appellant Daud. Albeit,

he too has been charged directly by the deceased then

injured and PW Farman Ali, but no crime weapon has

been recovered from his direct or indirect possession nor

has he confessed his guilt before competent court of law,

nor any other incriminating article to prove his

participation in the commission of offence has been

recovered from his possession or on his pointation.

Therefore, this aspect of the case create doubt about the

participation of appellant Daud Said in the commission of

offence and to his extent doubt arises that the deceased

then injured and PW Farman Ali, have exaggerated the

charge. However, on this sole ground we cannot throw

away the entire dying declaration of the deceased then

injured corroborated by ocular/direct evidence of Farman

Ali, rather the principle of sifting grain from the chaff

21

would be the best course to be adopted in the case, as by

now the principle of falsus in uno falsus in omnibus, has

been done away with. Rather the Courts while appreciating

evidence, apply the principle of sifting the grain from the

chaff. This principle has been laid down by the apex Court

in case titled, “Tawaib Khan and another Vs the State”

(PLD 1970 Supreme Court 13) in the following words:-

“The maxim ‘falsus in uno falsus in

omnibus” has all along been discarded by the

Courts in this country. Similarly, the rule that

the integrity of a witness is indivisible,

despite its normal virtue has not been

endorsed by the superior Courts of this

country without reservation and cannot be

accepted as one of universal applications. In

the last analysis, as stated in some of the

eminent judicial decisions, “the grain has to

22

be sifted from the chaff’ in each case, in

light of its own particular circumstances.

This principle has been reiterated by the apex Court in case

titled, “Bakka Vs The state” (1977 SCMR 150), as

follow:-

“The principle falsus in uno falsus in omnibus

has long since ceased to be applied by the

Courts in this country, and they have always

endeavored to separate the grain from the

chaff’.

The same principle has been observed by the Hon’ble

Supreme Court in plethora of judgments in various cases,

some of which are referred as titled, “Muhammad

Haleem and G.Safdar Shah.JJ Khairu and another Vs

the State (1981 SCMR 1136, “Ghulam Sikandar and

another Vs Mamaraz Khan and others” (PLD 1985

Supreme Court 11), “Irshad Ahmad Vs The State”

(PLD 1996 Supreme Court 138), “Sarfaraz alias Sappi

23

and 2 others Vs the State” (2000 SCMR 1758) and

“Ziaullah Vs the State” (1993 SCMR 155).

16. For what has been discussed above, we are

firm in our view that the evidence available on record is

sufficient only to prove the murder of the deceased by

appellants Faqir Said and Taimur Said, while participation

of the appellant Daud Said in the commission of offence

has not been proved through confidence inspiring

evidence.

17. The next point for consideration is what

should be the quantum of sentence to be awarded to the

guilty appellants, to meet the ends of justice. It appears

from the evidence that it was the deceased then injured

who asked the appellants as to why they had come to their

village, which resulted in the present incident. Probably

the incident would not have occurred if the deceased did

not inquire from the appellants, therefore, the incident

seems to be a sudden flare up between the deceased and

24

the appellants, without any premeditation and plan, as such

considering this aspect of the incident as a mitigating

circumstance, the sentence awarded by the learned Trial

Court would be sufficient to meet the ends of justice.

18. Accordingly, this appeal is partially allowed.

We while extending benefit of doubt, to appellant Daud

Said, set aside his conviction and sentence recorded and

awarded by the learned Trial Court vide impugned

judgment and acquit him of the charge leveled against him.

He be set at liberty forthwith, if not required in any other

case. To the extent of appellants Faqiar Said and Taimur

Said, this appeal stands dismissed. Their conviction and

sentence recorded by the learned Trial Court vide

impugned judgment dated 27.09.2011 are maintained.

Announced.
