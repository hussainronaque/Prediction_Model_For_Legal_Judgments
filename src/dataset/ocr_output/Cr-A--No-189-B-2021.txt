SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- Nazar Khan alias Nan,

the appellant, has called in question the judgment dated
30.10.2021, rendered by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-I, Bannu, whereby the appellant has been convicted
under section 302 (b) PPC, and sentenced to death with
fine of Rs.500,000/- (five lac) to be paid to the legal heirs of
deceased. The amount of fine on realization shall be paid to
the legal heirs of deceased, as compensation UIS 544-A
Cr.P.C, in default the convict shall undergo six months SI.
Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C was extended to the
convict/appellant. Murder Reference No. 04-B/2021 has
also been sent by the learned trial Court under section 374

Cr.P.C, for its confirmation or otherwise, hence, we intend
-2-

to decide both the matters through the instant common
judgment.

2. Brief facts of the case as per contents of F.ILR
are that, on 21.01.2011 the complainant Adnan Khan while
accompanying the dead-body of the deceased Khalid Khan
reported the matter, in the D.H.Q, Hospital Bannu, to the
local police to the effect that, he along with Khalid Khan
(deceased) had visited Murghi Mandai, Bannu to purchase
household articles, that in the meanwhile the accused Nazar
Khan alias Nan and Umar Fayaz armed with .30 bore
pistols attracted to the spot. Nazar Khan alias Nan fired at
the deceased Khalid Khan with the intention to kill, who
after receiving firearm injuries died on the spot. The
accused decamped from the spot after commission of the
offence, thus, the F.I.R ibid.

3. After concluding investigation, the prosecution
submitted challan against the accused. Learned
trial Court after compliance of section 265-C
Cr.P.C, formally charge sheeted the accused/appellant, to
which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The
prosecution produced and examined as many as 09
witnesses, whereafter, the accused was examined under
section 342 Cr.P.C. The appellant neither opted to be
examined on Oath under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C, nor wished

to produce evidence in defence. After hearing arguments,
“ee

-3-

the learned trial court vide the impugned judgment, dated
30.10.2021, convicted the appellant and sentenced him, as
mentioned above. Hence, the instant criminal appeal.

4. It was on 21.01.2011 at 08:45 AM when the
deceased and others visited Murghi Mandi Parady Gate
Bannu, when in the meanwhile the accused/appellant along
with another duly armed with .30 bore pistols attracted to
the spot, where out of the two, the convict/appellant started
firing at the deceased, who after receiving fire-arm injuries
got injured and died on the spot. The deceased was shifted
to civil hospital Bannu, where the matter was reported in the
shape of murasila and thereafter the injury sheet and inquest
report were prepared and dead-body was sent to the doctor
for PM examination. The investigating officer after
receiving copy of F.I.R visited the spot and on the
pointation of the eye-witness prepared the site-plan. During
spot inspection the investigating officer collected blood-
stained earth from the place of the deceased and two empties
of .30 bore from the place of the appellant. The collected
empties were sent to the fire-arms expert to ascertain as to

whether the same were fired from one or different weapons.
-4-
The report was received in positive with an opinion that the

same were fired from one weapon.

6. The appellant was arrested on 15.05.2019, and on
conclusion of the trial the learned trial Court was pleased to
convict him vide the impugned judgment. The learned trial
Court dealt with the matter comprehensively and after
applying its judicial mind to the evidence on record
convicted the appellant. This being the Court of appeal is
under the obligation to go through the collected evidence
and to ascertain as to whether the learned trial Court fully
appreciated the available evidence on file and that the
reasons provided for conviction of the appellant find
support from the evidence available on file. There is no
denial to the fact that out of the accused charged, the role of
effective firing has been attributed to the appellant, so in
essence single accused is charged for the murder of the
deceased. True that in case of a single accused substitution
is a rare phenomenon, but equally true that the same is not
the rule of thumb. As in case of single accused the Courts
are under obligation to apply extra care while assessing the
evidence on file, so that miscarriage of justice could be
avoided.

7. The learned counsel for the appellant submits

that the prosecution did not succeed in bringing home guilt
-5-

against the appellant; and that the incident did not occur in
the mode, manner and at the stated time. It was extensively
argued that the medical evidence does not support the case
of the prosecution and the seat of injuries on person of the
deceased belies the stance of the complainant. It was lastly
submitted that the prosecution case suffers from inherent
defects which can only and only be read in favour of the
appellant. Contrarily, the learned counsel representing the
complainant along with Asstt: Advocate General, submitted
that the matter was promptly reported which excludes the
possibility of consultation and deliberation. They further
submitted that the ocular account could not be shattered
despite lengthy cross-examination and that the medical
evidence fully supports the stance of the complainant. It
was argued that the motive alleged has been proved on
record and that the learned trial court was fully justified to
convict the appellant. They concluded their side on
submitting that the impugned judgment is well reasoned,
which calls for no interference.

8. Heard and record perused.

9. This Court is to see as to whether the incident
occurred in the mode, manner and at the stated time; and as
to whether the complainant was present at the time of
incident and as to whether the prosecution succeeded in

bringing home guilt against the appellant. The unfortunate
-6-

incident occurred in the local bazaar, known as, Murghi
Mandi Bazar, where the complainant along with the
deceased had come to purchase household articles to
prepare “Sobart”’, in the night. The record tells that yet the
deceased and the complainant were to purchase, when in the
meanwhile the accused attracted to the spot and fired at the
deceased. The deceased was shifted to the hospital where
the matter was reported. We are to ascertain from the record
that as to whether the incident occurred in the mode,
manner and at the stated time. We are to collect from the
available evidence the role played by the appellant and the
charge brought against him. There is no denial to the fact
that the complainant and others reached to the place of
incident at 08:45 AM and after receiving fire-arm injuries
the deceased was shifted to the hospital where the matter
was reported at 09:15 AM. The time spent between the
injuries caused and report made excludes the possibility of
consultation and deliberation, and it further confirms that
the complainant was present at the time of incident. The
site-plan prepared at the instance of the complainant
confirms the respective places assigned to the complainant,
the deceased and the accused as well. The recoveries of
empties from the spot along with blood-stained earth lend

support to the case of the prosecution.
-7-

10. Soon after reaching to the hospital, the matter
was reported and it was the complainant along with another
who identified the dead body of the deceased to the local
police at the time of preparation of the inquest report. Not
only at the time of report, but also at the time of
postmortem examination, it was the complainant along with
another, who identified the dead body of the deceased. The
presence of the complainant at the time of incident and soon
thereafter is established from the record and the defense
could not succeed in convincing us other-wise. It was
argued that had the complainant been present on the spot
instead of the deceased he would have been the prime
target, as it was he who was involved in the blood feud. An
attempt was made to convince that the respective places
assigned to the parties and the injuries received by the
deceased do not find support from the site-plan. The record
was gone through where we did not come across any
substantial material which could disclose the involvement
of the complainant in blood feud with the appellant and
even the record is silent in that respect. In order to
appreciate this particular aspect of the case, the prosecution
has placed on file copy of F.ILR No.119 dated 07.07.2009
under section 324/34 P.P.C, Police Station, Basia Khel,
Bannu. The motive F.I-.R was registered by one Nazar Khan

son of Gul Sarwar, where four accused namely, Raziq s/o
-8-

Rahmani, Gul Khan, Gham Nawaz Khan s/o Aziz Khan and
Am Nawaz Khan s/o Gul Khan, are charged. Though the
name of the deceased did not figure in the said F.I.R, but
one of the accused namely Raziq is the real brother of the
deceased and the possibility cannot be excluded that it was
the previous episode which claimed the life of the deceased.
11. The collected empties were sent to the fire-arms
expert wherefrom a report was received in positive, with an
opinion that the same were fired from one weapon. As in
the incident the effective role was assigned to the appellant,
so the laboratory report confirms the stance of the
complainant to a greater extent. The site-plan prepared on
pointation of the complainant fully supports the case of the
prosecution and the recoveries of empties ‘with it’s
positively report strengthens the prosecution case to a
greater extent. True that positive laboratory report is a
supportive piece of evidence and the same can be pressed
into service only and only when strong evidence is available
on file. In the present case the prompt report and direct
ocular account leaves no ambiguity that the prosecution is
well equipped with the required evidence and in the like
circumstances the positive report received from the
Laboratory fully supports the prosecution case and the same

can be taken into consideration.
-9-

12. It was agitated time and again that the medical
evidence does not support the case of the prosecution and
that the conflict between the two will benefit none, but only
the appellant. In order to ascertain this particular aspect of
the case, we with the help of learned counsel for the parties
went through the site-plan. The site-plan depicts the
respective places of the deceased, the eye-witness and the
accused, including the appellant. The inter-se distance
between the deceased and the appellant leaves no ambiguity
that the deceased was fired by the accused/appellant while
present at Point-3. In order to appreciate this particular
aspect of the case, we deem it essential to go through the
statement of the doctor, who was examined as PW-6. The
doctor explained the nature of injuries in the following
manner:-

Wounds:

1. One FAI entry wound on posterior part of right

lower skull size % x 1/4.
2. One FAI exit wound on right parietal region of
skull size%x%.

3. FAI entry wound on posterior aspect of skull

mid at lower part size 4x“.
13. It was argued with vehemence that the medical
evidence does not support the ocular account and that both

are in conflict. Our attention was brought to the injury
-10-

received on skull, where we observed that the bullet
travelled from down to upward. An attempt was made to
convince this Court that the firing was not made in the
mode and manner. We are not ready to accept to what the
learned counsel for the appellant submitted, as head is not
the static part of the body and human being reacts
differently in different circumstances. The possibility
cannot be excluded that on noticing the presence of accused
duly armed, the deceased would have reacted by changing
his position and while doing so received the injury on his
skull. We are not only to see the conflict between the
medical evidence and ocular account, rather we are to go
through the attending circumstances of the case, coupled
with statements of the witnesses recorded before the trial
court as in that eventuality this court will be in a better
position to appreciate this particular aspect of the case. We
cannot forget, and so is settled that medical evidence is
confirmatory in nature and in presence of direct, confidence
inspiring and trust worthy ocular account the same has little
role to play. In the present case as the complainant
succeeded in establishing his presence on the spot and his
testimony could not be shattered, so it is the ocular account
which would prevail instead of the medical evidence. True
that, when the ocular account fails then it is the medical

evidence which steers the wheel. The complainant remained
-ll-

consistent on material aspects of the case and the defence
failed to discredit his veracity. Our attention was invited to
the fact that the postmortem was conducted at 10:35 PM,
after a considerable delay, and that the same alone is
sufficient to discard the prosecution story. The learned
counsel representing the appellant fell in error, as in fact the
time of examination of the dead body was 10:35 AM and
not 10:35 PM. In order to resolve the controversy, the
opinion of the doctor is of prime importance, where the
time between injury and death is given as | to 3 hours. It is
pertinent to mention that soon after preparation of the
inquest report the dead body was handed over to one Imran
Shah (constable), who escorted the same to the doctor for
postmortem examination, and no prudent mind would
accept that the same was produced to the doctor after 24
long hours. This plea of the appellant cannot be accepted
and as such the same is discarded. As the complainant
succeeded in establishing his presence on the spot at the
time of incident and thereafter, so his evidence is not only
trustworthy but confidence inspiring as well, the same
cannot be discarded, even if, there were minor discrepancies
in the prosecution case. In case titled “Sharfuddin_alias
Sharfu and another Vs. The State”(2022 YLR 324), it is

held that:
-12-

The minor discrepancies pointed out
by the learned counsel are not helpful
to the defense because with the
passage of time such discrepancies
are bound to occur. The occurrence
took place in broad day light and both
parties knew each other so there was
no mistaken identity and in absence of
any previous enmity there could be no
substitution by letting off the real
culprit specially when the appellant
alone was responsible for the murder
of the deceased. The evidence of two
eye-witnesses was consistent, truthful
and _confidence-inspiring. The
medical evidence fully supports the
ocular account so far the injuries
received by the deceased, time which
lapse between the injury and death
and between death and postmortem.

14, The motive was stated to be the blood feud
between the parties and that several persons lost their lives
from both the sides. In order to substantiate its stance the
prosecution placed on file the motive F.I-R where brother of
the deceased namely Raziq was charged along with others.
This was agitated time and again that when complainant
was the prime target and that when he was present at the
time of incident then instead of the deceased he would have

been the actual target but his escaping unhurt strengthens
-13-

the belief that the incident did not occur in the manner and
at the stated time. It was further submitted that once the
motive is alleged and the same is not proved then it is the
prosecution to suffer.-As the alleged motive has been
proved on record and the investigating officer collected
documentary evidence in that respect, so we lurk no doubt
in mind that the prosecution has been succeeded in proving
the motive. If we admit for a while that the prosecution
failed to prove the motive then the same can be pressed into
service for limited purposes i.e. for determining the
quantum of sentence and nothing more keeping in view the
peculiar circumstances of this case.

15. The appellant soon after the incident went into
hiding till his arrest on 15.05.2019. The appellant could not
explain his long abscondance. True that abscondance alone
is not sufficient to burden an accused with the liability, but
equally true that the same can be taken into consideration in
favour of the prosecution provided, the prosecution
succeeds in bringing home guilt against the accused
charged. As the prosecution succeeded in proving its case
against the appellant through confidence inspiring
witnesses, so the long unexplained abscondance can be
taken an additional ground to favour the prosecution.

16. As the prosecution succeeded in bringing home

guilt against the appellant, so this Court is to determine as
-14-

to whether the awarded sentence is justified and is in
accordance with law. As the appellant has been convicted to
death sentence, so this Court is under the obligation to
reassess the already assessed evidence to ascertain as to
whether the awarded sentence is legally correct and as to
whether the learned trial court had no alternative to go for a
lesser sentence. The record tells that both the deceased and
the appellant during the days of incident were aged about
22/23 years, an age where it is hard to resist the emotions,
temptations and the surrounding influences. We lurk no
doubt in mind that the prosecution could not succeed in
bringing on record the exact cause of the incident, rather
previous blood feud was projected to be the cause of death
of the deceased. True that on record brother of the deceased
was charged in the motive F.LR, but equally true that the
prosecution could not bring on record concrete evidence in
that respect to exclude any other hypothesis. As the
complainant, the deceased and the appellant were nearly of
the same ages, the possibility cannot be excluded that it was
a chance encounter which led to the death of the deceased.
The record is silent that what happened a little earlier to the
incident which claimed the life of the deceased. As the
complainant stated that at the time of incident, both the
accused i.e. the appellant and his co-accused were duly

armed with .30 bore pistols and that it was from the fire
-15-

shots of the appellant that the deceased lost his life. Had the
cause of death been the blood feud, then in that eventuality
the complainant would have also received fire arm injuries
and the co-accused would have also resorted to firing, but
the situation tells another story and the created mystery
could not be resolved till the end. This court is to take into
consideration the attending circumstances of the case for
awarding sentence. There is no denial to the fact that on one
hand there are minor discrepancies in case of the
prosecution, whereas on the other the prosecution could not
convince that it was the previous blood feud between the
parties which claimed the life of deceased. When the
prosecution is uncertain regarding the exact cause of death,
then the same can be pressed into service to assess as to
whether the appellant was rightly convicted. We are
conscious of the fact that when the prosecution succeeds in
bringing home guilt against an accused charged, then the
normal penalty is death, but in case in hand the
discrepancies in the prosecution case and the uncertain
cause of death leads this court to hold that the awarded
sentence is a bit harsh and the same needs interference, as is

held in case titled “Mst. BEVI Vs. Ghulam Shabbir and

another” (1980 SCMR 859) where it is held:

“The question of sentence undoubtedly

present a complex problem. On the one
-16-

hand the prosecution asserted a
definite motive for Ghulam Shabbir
respondent to murder the
deceased—either as a hired assassin or
without payment a mere obligation on
the asking of Ghulam Abbas acquitted
accused. The failure of this part of the
prosecution cast even (if the acquittal
of Ghulam Abbas is considered to be
on benefit of doubt) can be pressed in
service by Ghulam Shabbir when
considering the question of sentence.
On the other hand, if the assumed
motive- ii kept in view ht is guilty of an
unprovoked cruel act of murder, It has
been held in some cases that the
principle underlying the concept of
benefit of doubt can in addition to the
consideration of question of guilt or
otherwise, be pressed also in matter of
sentence. As a definite motive was
asserted against the respondent and the
same has failed, keeping in view all the
circumstances of this case, it would not
be necessary to impose the capita’
punishment. Therefore while finding
him guilty; under section 302, P. P. C.
he is sentenced to transportation for
life should be awarded as

compensation.”

17. We, in order to avoid miscarriage of justice
deem it appropriate to reduce the awarded sentence from

death to imprisonment for life under section 302 (b) P.P.C.
-17-

The instant Criminal Appeal is partially allowed, the
impugned judgment is modified by maintaining the
conviction and reducing the sentence from death to life
imprisonment, while rest of the sentence shall remain intact.

As the criminal appeal has partially been allowed
and the appellant is convicted and sentenced under section
302 (b) P.P.C, is reduced, to life imprisonment, the Murder

Reference No._04-B/2021 is answered in negative.
