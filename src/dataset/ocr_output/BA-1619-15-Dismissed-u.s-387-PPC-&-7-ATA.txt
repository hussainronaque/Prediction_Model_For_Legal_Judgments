(Judicial Department)

Cr.M (BA) No. 1619-P/2015.
JUDGMENT
Date of hearing. 12.10.2015.

Petitioner (Abdur Rahman) By Syed Akbar Ali Shah, Advocate.
State By Mr. Mujahid Ali Khan, AAG.

Complainant. By Mr. Afroz Ahmad, Advocate.

QAISER RASHID KHAN, J. The accused-
petitioner, Abdur Rahman, seeks bail in case FIR No. 70
dated 14.7.2015 under sections 387 PPC/ 7 ATA, Police
Station CTD, Peshawar after being declined the said
relief by the learned Judge Anti-Terrorism Court-III
Peshawar on 5.9.2015.

2. Facts in brief leading to the instant petition are
that the complainant made a written application to the
local police stating therein to have received threatening
calls on his cell phone No.0333-9141385 from mobile
Nos.0335-8377791 and 0331-8153412 by posing
themselves to be members of Tehreek-e-Taliban Bara

and had demanded a huge amount, hence the FIR ibid.

3. Learned counsel for the accused-petitioner

contended that no mobile call was ever made to the

complainant by the accused-petitioner demanding any

amount and that none of the two mobile numbers i.e.

0335-8377791 and 0331-8153412 belong to him nor the

same had ever remained in his use. His next contention

was that the accused-petitioner has been involved on the

mere statement of his co-accused who happens to be his

cousin and from whom various SIM numbers and

mobile sets were recovered and that the case of the

accused-petitioner being one of no evidence, therefore,

he is entitled to bail. He lastly contended that the

complainant present before the court does not charge the

accused-petitioner for the alleged threatening calls and

thus on this score too, he is entitled to bail when there is

no likelihood of the conviction of the accused-petitioner

during trial.

4. The complainant alongwith his counsel stated that

they do not charge the accused-petitioner.

5. The learned AAG on his turn strongly opposed

the bail petition and contended that the accused-
3

petitioner is directly linked with the commission of the

offence which is not only heinous in nature but is also

non-compoundable and hence he is not entitled to be

released on bail.

Arguments heard and available record perused.

6. It was on the written application of the

complainant whereby he stated to have received

threatening calls from mobile Nos. 0335-8377791 and

0331-8153412 with a demand of three crore rupees from

him through instalments when the local police spurred

into action and after holding inquiry under section 156

(3) Cr.P.C made a major breakthrough in the arrest of

co-accused Ghani-ur-Rehman. His arrest not only led to

the recovery of mobile sets and various SIM numbers

including SIM  No.0331-8153412 from which

threatening calls were made to the complainant but he

also pointed an accusing finger at the accused-petitioner

being his cousin and accomplice. It was thereafter when

one Fazal Hadi recorded his statement under section 164

Cr.P.C on 12.8.2015 who on the one hand claimed the

ownership of SIM No. 0335-8377791 from which the
4

first threatening call was made to the complainant but

also that the said SIM was taken from him by the

accused-petitioner and did not return the same to him.

The complainant has charged the accused-petitioner

alongwith his co-accused by name for holding out

threats to him as well as demanding huge amount from

him while recording his statement under section 164

Cr.P.C.

7. This court is fully conscious of the fact that the

complainants in like manner matters mostly take a U-

turn as they cannot afford to face persons of the ilk of

the accused-petitioner in a court of law as still bigger

and grave threats are hurled to them. Of late, this

phenomenon of giving threatening calls to the ordinary

but affluent people and demanding huge amounts from

them has attained a menacing proportion and thereby the

perpetrators of such crimes have made the lives of the

ordinary people miserable by giving them sleepless

nights and this in a way has become a lucrative business

for such faceless people.

8. Taking a tentative assessment of the available

record, the accused-petitioner is prima facie linked with

the commission of the offence which is not only heinous

but is also against the society at large dis-entitling him

to the concession of bail.

For the reasons stated above, this bail petition

being meritless stands dismissed.

Before parting with this order, it is directed that

any observations recorded in this order, being purely

tentative in nature, should in no way prejudice the

proceedings before the learned trial Court where the

case be decided on its own merits after recording

evidence.
