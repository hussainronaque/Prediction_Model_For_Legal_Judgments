learned trial Court whereby she has prayed for
enhancement of the sentences awarded to appellants.
Both the cases, being inter connected and arising out
of the same judgment, are decided together through
this judgment.

2. The report was lodged by complainant
Mst. Amina Bibi (PW-8) on 25.07.2019 at 13:00
hours in Civil Hospital Yar Hussain to the effect that
on the same day she was present inside her house.
On hearing noise she came out and saw that the
present appellants duly armed with weapons were
altercating with her son Ibne Amin during which
they fired at him as result whereof he was hit and
died on the spot. She further stated in her report that
the occurrence has been witnessed by Fazal Aman
(PW-9) whereas the motive behind the occurrence
was mentioned as land dispute.

3. Report of the complainant was recorded
in shape of Murasila on the basis whereof formal
FIR was registered against both the appellants. The
dead body was examined by Dr. Ertaza Ajmal
(PW-01). His findings incorporated in the

postmortem report (Ex.PM) are as under:

Condition of subject: A young man of
about 25/26 years old is brought to me

wearing white qamees shalwar and banyan.

excessive bleeding from skull due to
firearm.

4. The appellants initially remained
absconders and later on they moved petitions for
their pre-arrest bail, as such, they were symbolically
arrested on 11.09.2019. After completion of
investigation, challan against them was put in Court
and they were formally charge sheeted for the
offence. On their not pleading guilty to the formal
charge, prosecution produced twelve witnesses in
support of the allegations against the appellants and

closed the evidence. When examined u/s 342,

Cr.P.C, the appellants once again denied the charge
leveled against them, however, they neither
produced any witness in their defence nor opted to
be examined on oath in terms of section 340(2),
Cr.P.C. On conclusion of trial, the learned trial
Court vide impugned judgment convicted and
sentenced the appellants in the manner already noted

in the earlier part of this judgment, hence, this

appeal.

5. Arguments heard and record of the case
was perused.

6. Prosecution has examined complainant

Mst. Amina Bibi (PW-8) and Fazal Aman (PW-9) as
eye witnesses of the occurrence. The former is
mother while the latter is paternal cousin of the
deceased. Since both the eye witnesses are closely
related to deceased, therefore, their testimony needs

to be thrashed out with great care and caution.

As per statement of the complainant,
while present in her house, she came out on hearing
noise and saw both the appellants altercating with
her son during which they started firing at him with
their Kalashnikovs as result whereof her son

sustained injuries on his body and died on the spot.

According to the site plan, the distance between the
spot and house of the complainant is 384 feet. She is
admittedly a parda nasheen lady of 50/51 years of
age and is not only in habit of using glasses meant
for weak eye sight but was also not in the habit of
coming in front of the public without wearing
veil/covering sheet. The first claim of the
complainant regarding hearing of the noise from a
distance of 384 feet does not appeal to prudent mind
more particularly when she was inside the boundary
of her house. She also admitted in her cross-
examination that usually she does not come out of
her house in commotion, as such, her contention that
she came out of her house on that particular
occasion cannot be accepted being contrary to her
customary habit. Though in response to a question
of the defence counsel she explained that she came
out of her house after wearing the covering sheet
which her daughter was already holding in her hands
but this explanation of the complainant, being
repellant to reason, is mere a lame endeavor for
bringing her statement in line with the evidence
collected during the course of investigation, On

keeping the statement of complainant in

juxtaposition with the site plan and Murasila/FIR, a
clear disparity can be seen among the mentioned
three pieces of evidence with regard to the place of
occurrence. According to Murasila, the complainant
mentioned the place of occurrence as ~ex UI! a)
lay Ouwe yh aily but contrary to above, in the site plan
the deceased has been shown on Point No.2 which is
the ridge between the land of one Gohar Rehman
and the non-metaled thoroughfare leading to his
house. It is important to note here that father name
of the deceased is also Gohar Rehman but the person
named as Gohar Rehman in the site plan is another
person as verified by Abdullah (PW-6) during his
cross-examination. Even otherwise, the I.O has
specifically mentioned the land of complainant in
the site plan as ex U5! ~2I!, hence, in this regard
there remains no ambiguity. Keeping in view the
contradictions between the site plan, statement of the
complainant and Murasila, it can safely be
concluded that complainant was not present at the
time of occurrence otherwise she would have
mentioned the exact place of occurrence in her
report. In addition to above, complainant stated in

her examination that after hearing noise she came

out of her house and kept walking on the path in
between her two fields right in front of her house
and when reached to the middle thereof the
appellants fired at her son. Although Point-1A
assigned to complainant in the site plan falls in-
between her two fields but LO Shehzad Khan S.I
(PW-10) denied existence of any path between the
two fields of complainant rather stated that there is a
path between the fields of appellants and
complainant. Thus, the statement of complainant
gets no corroboration from the site plan. It is also
noteworthy that according to complainant, she had
attended her son soon after the occurrence and her
clothes and covering sheet got stained with his blood
but the I.O has not taken into possession her blood-
stained garments to lend support to her above
narrations. No doubt, her testimony could not be
discarded on the sole ground that she is closely
related to deceased and as per golden principle laid
down by the apex Court for appreciation of evidence
of such witness, it is not the question of enmity or
relationship but the intrinsic value of the statement

of prosecution witness which is required to be

considered. Keeping in view the above

inconsistencies inter se the statement of complainant
and other circumstantial evidence on record, her
presence on the spot at the time of occurrence is
highly doubtful, therefore, her testimony cannot be
safely relied upon against the appellants/convicts.
Guidance is sought from Mst. Sughra Begum and
another Vs. Qaisar Pervez and others (2015 SCMR

1142). The august Supreme Court held in the said

judgment that:

8. It is cardinal principle of justice that
ocular account in such cases plays a decisive
and vital role and once its intrinsic worth is
accepted and believed then the rest of the
evidence, both circumstantial and
corroboratory in nature, would be required
as a matter of caution. To the contrary, once
the ocular account is disbelieved then no
other evidence, even of a high degree and
value, would be sufficient for recording
conviction on a capital charge therefore, we
have to see the probative value of the ocular
account in light of the facts and
circumstances of the case.

Z The other eye witness Fazal Aman
appeared in the witness box as PW-9 and claimed
that he had witnessed the present appellants
committing murder of the deceased through firing.
This witness, being resident of Mohallah Barees in
village Yar Hussain situated at a distance of about
04 kilometers from village Shaheeda as per
statement of the complainant, is a chance witness

because he has not established his presence on the

spot with reasons. Though complainant has stated
that house of this witness is situated adjacent to her
house but in this regard too she has not spoken the
gospel truth as neither the I.0 has shown the house
of PW Fazal Aman in the site plan nor the said
witness himself has explained before the Court the
very purpose for which he had come to village
Shaheeda from Mohallah Barees Yar Hussain on the
day of occurrence. He stated before the trial Court
that he was present in the field of complainant at the
time of occurrence but he has been shown at Point-5
in the site plan which is the junction of two roads
leading to Yar Hussain and Dagai towards west and
north respectively while towards south is the
thoroughfare leading to the house of one Gohar
Rehman. He admitted his presence on the road the
existence of which he had earlier denied during his
cross-examination. He has not only recorded a self-
contradictory statement but his narrations are also
not supported by site plan. The eye witness also
stated that altercation between deceased and
appellants continued for 5/6 minutes during which
he watched them from a distance of 30 feet but did
not interfere in their altercation and remained silent

spectator. Similarly, though he claims to have

Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ishtiag Ibrehim

{CA No. 712-P/2020 Riaz and another Vs. The State and another)
-10-
shifted the dead body to hospital but he did not
identify the deceased before the doctor nor produced
his clothes allegedly stained with the blood of
deceased to Investigating Officer. The above
unusual conduct of the eye witness casts further
doubt on his presence on the place of occurrence at
the relevant time. Thus, PW Fazal Aman is mere a
chance witness and he has failed to establish his
presence on the spot at the time of occurrence.
Although evidence of a chance witness cannot be
discarded on the sole ground that he happened to be
at the place of incident incidentally but prosecution
has failed to bring on record convincing evidence to
establish his presence on the spot at the relevant
time, therefore, his testimony cannot give any
foundation for conviction of the appellants. Reliance
in this regard is placed on Muhammad Ashraf alias
Acchu Vs. The State (2019 SCMR 652) wherein the
august Supreme Court observed that:

Concocted evidence provided by chance
witnesses---Where the Court reached a
conclusion that the eyewitnesses were chance
witnesses; they had not witnessed the
occurrence and the prosecution story was
concocted by the prosecution witnesses, then
the case of the accused merited plain
acquittal.

8. In addition to above, not only the

statements of both the eye witnesses are suffering

Tajamuves*| {0.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak

from glaring contradictions but they have also
dishonestly improved their statements recorded
during investigation. They do not agree in their
statements regarding the place of residence of PW
Fazal Aman and in this regard the complainant has
tried to suppress the fact that the said PW is resident
of Barees Yar Hussain. She also stated during the
trial that her son had got out of the house on the
phone call of appellant Riaz, however, the FIR is
lacking her above narrations. Similarly, she duly
specified the crime weapons as Kalashnikovs when
appeared before the trial Court though in the FIR she
had stated that the appellants had fired at the
deceased with firearms/o+*i ~L.), Similar dishonest
improvements were made by PW Fazal Aman with
regard to time of occurrence, nature of the weapons
and verification of the complainant’s report when he
was duly confronted by defence counsel with his
statement u/s 161, Cr.P.C, Thus, the improvements
so made by both the eye witnesses, being deliberate
and dishonest, casts further doubt on their veracity.
Reliance is placed on the judgment of the Hon’ble
apex Court in the case titled Akhtar Ali and others
Vs. The State (2008 SCMR 6) wherein it was held

that:

Hon'ble Me, Justice iste tbrahion

(Cr.A No. 712-P/2020 Riaz and another Vs. The State and another}
-12-

When a witness improves his version to
strengthen the prosecution case, his improved
statement subsequently made cannot be
relied upon as the witness has improved his
statement dishonestly, therefore, his
credibility becomes doubtful on the well-
known principle of criminal jurisprudence
that improvements once found deliberate and
dishonest cast serious doubt on the veracity
of such witness.

a Another aspect of the case which
intrinsically makes the prosecution story unbelievable
is the time of report and the time of examination of the
dead body in hospital coupled with admission of the
complainant that police had arrested 5/6 accused on
the spot soon after the occurrence. According to
Murasila, the occurrence took place on 25.07.2019 at
12:00 hours which was statedly reported on the same
day at 13:00 hours. The doctor conducted postmortem
at 12:50 P.M i.e ten minutes prior to lodging of the
report. According to author of Murasila namely Imtiaz
Khan ASI (PW-2), he reached hospital at 13:00 hours,
recorded the report and prepared the injury sheet as
well as inquest report of the deceased and thereafter
referred the dead body to doctor under the escort of
police official for post-mortem. PW-2 must have
consumed some time on preparation of the mentioned
three documents, then how the doctor could conduct
the postmortem without intimation of police in shape

of injury sheet and inquest report. Thus, the times

‘Hon’ble Mr, Justice ishtlaa tbrahim

{Cr.A No. 712-P/2020 Riaz and another Vs. The State and another)
-13-
mentioned by both the doctor and author of Murasila
in their respective reports appear to have been
mentioned fictitiously. It appears that police recorded
the report after conducting preliminary investigation
and the complainant nominated the present appellants
after consultation and deliberation. Our _ this
apprehension is further substantiated by duration of
death of two hours as mentioned by the doctor in the
postmortem report. On calculating the said duration of
death of the deceased from the time of postmortem i.e
12:50 P.M, the occurrence must have taken place at
10:50 A.M which has dishonestly been suppressed by
prosecution. Most importantly, the complainant has
admitted arrest of 5/6 accused by police on the spot
soon after the occurrence meaning thereby that police
had visited the spot soon after the occurrence and it
appears that by that time complainant had no
knowledge about the assailants, as such, the report
was willfully delayed by police by concealing the real
facts and preliminary inquiry was conducted
whereafter the complainant charged the present
appellants after speculation and deliberation. Though
preliminary inquiry by itself is not a sufficient ground
for disbelieving the prosecution story but in such

situation presence of the eye witnesses becomes

Tajamul/es*| (0.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak
Hon‘hie Mr, Justice Ishtiag brahim

(Cr.A No, 712-P/2020 Riaz and another Vs. The State and another)
-14-
doubtful and the Courts are required to scrutinize the
evidence with great care and caution for arriving at a
fair conclusion. Reliance is placed on “State through

Advocate General _N.W.F.P Peshawar Vs. Shah

Jehan” (PLD2003_ SC_70) wherein it has been held

that:-

“The delay in lodging the F.I.R. has not been
explained plausibly, which shows that it was
lodged after preliminary inquiry/
investigation, deliberation and consultation,
and the complainant (P.W.8) was called for
from his village Dinpur, which was at a
distance of about three miles from the house
of the respondent”.

10. _ Although as per postmortem report the
deceased died due to excessive bleeding from the
firearm injuries he sustained on his person in the
same occurrence but the said report alone cannot
establish the charge against the appellants when
otherwise the prosecution has failed to bring home
their guilt through trustworthy and reliable ocular
account. Even otherwise, according to medical
evidence the deceased has sustained 03 entry
wounds; one on his right eyebrow while the
remaining two inlet wounds were found on middle
of the right ear which can further be clarified from
the pictorial annexed with the postmortem report

(Page-44 of the record) . Though the doctor has not

Talamul/Ps"| (0.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak

{(Cr.A No. 712-P/2020 Riaz and another Vs. The State and another)
-15-
mentioned the dimension of the entry wounds,
however, when both the appellants were allegedly
armed with Kalashnikovs and they made firing at the
deceased, it can safely be held from the recoil of the
weapons and the distance between the appellants and
deceased that it was a one man job and one weapon
has been used in the commission of the offence.
Likewise, the locale of the said injuries and direction
of the inlet and exit wounds also suggest that it was
the doing of one person which can be clarified from
postmortem report Ex.PM and pictorial appended
with it. Hence exaggeration of the charge by
complainant and false implication of innocent
persons in the case cannot be ruled out in the

mentioned circumstances.

il. As regards recovery of the crime
weapons Kalashnikovs on pointation of the
appellants, as per FSL report Ex.PK/2 the same have
not matched with the five empties of 7.62 bore
recovered from the spot. Similarly, the earlier FSL
report Ex.PK/3 regarding the crime empties showing
the same empties to have been fired from different
weapons is also of no avail to prosecution in absence

of trustworthy direct and circumstantial evidence.

12. Coming to the motive part of the case,
though complainant has disclosed the motive as land
dispute with the appellants but except placing on file
the revenue record as Ex.PW-12/4, she has produced
no evidence to this effect rather she admitted that no
suit is pending regarding the alleged disputed
property. It is in her statement that the appellants
had purchased the land adjacent to her land,
however, she denied the suggestion her annoyance
over the said purchase by appellants and their false
implication in the case. In the mentioned situation
when the appellants were purchasers of the land
adjacent to the land of complainant, the motive is
naturally attributable to complainant side and not to
the appellants to kill the deceased rather their false
implication by complainant in view of the said
motive cannot be ruled out because it is a settled
principle that motive is a double-edged weapon
which cuts both sides as observed by the august
Supreme Court in the case titled Muhammad Ashraf
and 2 others Vs. The State (1998 SCMR 279) in the
following words.

Motive is a double-edged weapon, as while it
may be a sufficient reason for commission of
the offence by the accused, it can equally
serve as a reason for the false involvement of
the accused in the crime,

(Cr.A No, 712-P/2020 Riaz and another Vs. The State and another)

13. Although the appellants have remained
absconders for about 1 % months but prosecution
has badly failed to prove the charge against them
through ocular account and other circumstantial
evidence of convincing nature, therefore, their
conviction cannot be recorded solely on the ground
of their abscondence which has always been
considered by superior Courts as corroborative
evidence. Reliance is placed on Basharat_and
another Vs. The State (1995 SCMR 1735) wherein it
was held that:

After disbelieving the alleged motive,
exclusion of the ocular evidence and the
rejection of the incriminating recovery, there
remains circumstance of abscondence of
Ghulam Mustafa which per se is not
sufficient for conviction under section 302,
P.P.C.

14. The prosecution case is suffering from
many inconsistencies and infirmities sufficient to
create serious doubts in prudent mind regarding
involvement of the appellants in commission of the
offence, therefore, their conviction and sentences
recorded by trial Court in the impugned judgment
cannot be maintained in the — circumstances.
Resultantly, this appeal is allowed, the impugned
judgment is set aside and appellants are acquitted of
the charge so leveled against them by prosecution.

They be released forthwith from jail if not required
