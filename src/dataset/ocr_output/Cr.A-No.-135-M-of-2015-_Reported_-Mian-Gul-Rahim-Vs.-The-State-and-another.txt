HAIDER ALI KHAN, J.- Through this single

judgment we intend to dispose of the instant appeal as

well as the connected criminal revision petitions

bearing Cr.R No. 44-M/2015 and Cr.R No. 07-M/2016

preferred by the State and widow of the deceased,

respectively for enhancement of the sentence awarded

to the appellant/convict. All the matters arise from one

judgment dated 15.6.2015 of the learned Additional

Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi, Swat at Kabal,

delivered in case FIR No.408 dated 05.9.2014,

[Cr.A No. 135-M of 2018 Mian Gul Rahim Vs. The State and another]
registered under section 302 PPC, at Police Station

Kanju, District Swat.

2. Vide the impugned judgment, the learned

trial Court has convicted the appellant/convict herein

namely Mian Gul Rahim under Section 302(c) PPC

and sentenced him to 14 years rigorous imprisonment

with payment of Rs.200,000/- as compensation to the

LRs of the deceased or in default thereof he was

ordered to suffer further six months S.I. The appellant

has challenged the above conviction through the instant

appeal.

3. The State as well as widow of the

deceased, being aggrieved of the lesser punishment

awarded to the appellant/convict, have filed the

connected revision petitions bearing Cr.R No. 44-M/

2015 and Cr.R No. 07-M/2016, respectively, whereby

they have prayed for enhancement of the sentence of

the appellant/convict.

[Cr.A No. 135-M of 2018 Mian Gul Rahim Vs. The State and another]
4, Precise and relevant facts of the

case are that on 05.9.2014 at the time of Maghrib

prayer the complainant Shamas Khan reported to the

local police at Casualty Ward of Saidu Sharif Hospital

to the effect that at the relevant time he alongwith

Ibrahim Khan was going for performance of Maghrib

prayer and when they reached near the lumberyard

(J6 558), they saw his brother Asghar Khan (deceased)

and accused Mian Gul Rahim having a scuffle because

of hand-cart/push-cart; that in the meanwhile the

accused Mian Gul Rahim caused a knife stab at the

right side of the neck of his brother Asghar Khan with

which he got seriously injured and the accused

decamped from the spot; that the injured Asghar Khan

succumbed to his injury while he was on the way to the

hospital. The occurrence was reported by the

complainant to have been witnessed by him and

Ibrahim Khan whereas the motive behind the

occurrence was stated to be a dispute over a hand-cart.

[Cr.A No. 135-M of 2018 Mian Gul Rahim Vs. The State and another]
Report of the complainant was recorded in

shape of Murasila Ex.PW-10/1 which was later on

incorporated in FIR, Ex.PA. The accused was arrested

and challan was submitted against him in the Court

after completion of the investigation. The trial Court

framed formal charge against the accused to which he

pleaded not guilty and claimed the trial whereafter the

prosecution produced as many as ten witnesses in order

to bring home guilt to the accused. After recording the

prosecution evidence, statement of the accused under

section 342, Cr.P.C was recorded wherein he again

claimed his innocence, however, he felt no need to

produce any evidence in his defence nor he opted to be

examined on oath under Section 340(2), Cr.P.C. At the

conclusion of the trial, the trial Court found the

accused guilty of the charge and sentenced him as

mentioned in Para No.2. Being aggrieved, the

appellant/convict has preferred the instant appeal

whereby he has challenged his conviction whereas the

[Cr.A No. 135-M of 2018 Mian Gul Rahim Vs. The State and another]
State as well as widow of the deceased have filed their

respective revision petitions seeking enhancement of

the punishment awarded to the appellant/convict, all

the matter being inter connected are being disposed of

through this single judgment.

5. Learned counsel for the appellant/convict

contended that the impugned judgment is based on

conjectures and surmises as well as the same is against

the law and facts on the record; that the learned trial

Judge did not appreciate the evidence in its true and

legal perspective and drew a wrong conclusion without

application of judicial mind which resulted in gross

miscarriage of justice to the appellant; that the

prosecution evidence is suffering from _ serious

contradictions and dents, hence, the case against the

appellant/convict has not been proved beyond

reasonable doubt but the learned trial Court did not

consider the same and convicted the appellant through

[Cr.A No. 135-M of 2018 Mian Gul Rahim Vs. The State and another]
the impugned judgment which is not legally

sustainable.

6. As against the above, learned counsel for

the complainant as well as the learned A.A.G

appearing on behalf of the State argued that the

prosecution has successfully proved the allegation

against the appellant/convict through convincing and

confidence inspiring evidence but the learned trial

Judge did not consider the same and awarded lesser

punishment to the appellant without any legal

justification. They prayed that appeal of the

appellant/convict be dismissed whereas by allowing

the connected revision petitions, the sentence awarded

to the appellant/convict be enhanced in accordance

with law.

7. We have heard the arguments advanced by

learned counsel for the parties as well as that of the

learned A.A.G appearing on behalf of the State and

perused the record in light of their valuable assistance.

[Cr.A No. 135-M of 2018 Mian Gul Rahim Vs. The State and another]
8. Perusal of the record would reveal that the

prosecution has examined three witnesses namely

Shamas Khan (complainant), Sajjad and Ibrahim Khan

as PW-2 to PW-4 respectively who had witnessed the

occurrence. The statements recorded by the

aforementioned eye witnesses reveal that they have set

forth a true account of the occurrence and depicted the

incident in the manner in which it actually occurred.

Learned counsel for the appellant/convict argued that

the two witnesses namely Shamas Khan (PW-2) and

Ibrahim Khan (PW-3) are interested witnesses being

closely related to the deceased besides the prosecution

has not established their presence on the spot. There is

no denial to the fact that the mentioned two eye

witnesses and the deceased are closely related inter se,

however, the evidence of an interested witness cannot

be discarded merely on the ground of his close

relationship with the deceased provided the same is

duly corroborated by an independent source. In the

[Cr.A No. 135-M of 2018 Mian Gul Rahim Vs. The State and another]
present case the prosecution has produced the third eye
witness namely Sajjad as PW-3 who is an impartial and
independent witness and has fully supported the
prosecution version. By comparing the statements of
the three eye witnesses it becomes abundantly clear
that they are consistent in their deposition on material
points and their testimony has not been shattered
despite lengthy cross-examination. Learned counsel for
the appellant also contended that the name of PW
Sajjad has not been mentioned by the complainant in
the FIR and he was later on introduced, hence, a
dishonest improvement was made in the prosecution
case. Admittedly, PW Sajjad is son of Ala Khan who
is owner of the lumberyard/ (63% J4) where the
occurrence took place, hence, his presence on the spot
cannot be doubted mere on the ground that his name
was not mentioned in the FIR. Moreso, the said witness
has been cross-examined at length but nothing

favourable to the appellant has been extracted from his

[Cr.A No. 135-M of 2018 Mian Gul Rahim Vs. The State and another]
mouth. Thus, in the estimation of this Court, the eye

witnesses have produced a trustworthy account of the

occurrence and there is nothing on the record in

rebuttal to belie their statements.

9. In addition to the above, the statements of

the eye witnesses are fully corroborated by the

postmortem report and statement of Dr. Abdullah Khan

(PW-1) who conducted the postmortem on_ the

deceased. Moreso, weapon of the offence has been

recovered on pointation of the appellant/convict and

blood stained pieces of wood have also been collected

by the I.O from the spot. On analyzing the remaining

material on the record in light of the statements of the

eye witnesses, a clear picture of the occurrence

emerges in a prudent mind that undoubtedly the

appellant/convict is directly involved in the murder of

the deceased. Furthermore, learned counsel for the

appellant/convict also referred to certain contradictions

in the statements of the prosecution witnesses and also

[Cr.A No. 135-M of 2018 Mian Gul Rahim Vs. The State and another]
-10-

pointed towards the fact that the hand-cart being the

cause of the occurrence, has not been taken into

possession by the local police. No doubt, there are

minor discrepancies in the prosecution case and the

hand-cart has not been seized up by the local police,

however, the above facts are not fatal to the

prosecution case keeping in view the remaining

evidence available on the record being worth reliance

and sufficient for bringing home guilt to the appellant .

10. It was also the contention of the learned

counsel for the appellant/convict that the alleged

motive as depicted by the prosecution has not been

proved. It is well settled that motive cannot be sine qua

non for bringing home guilt to an accused and it is

enough to determine factum of intention which can be

gathered from facts and circumstances of the case. If

guilt of an accused stands proved in light of statements

of the eye witnesses then absence of the motive or

failure on the part of the prosecution to prove the same

[Cr.A No. 135-M of 2018 Mian Gul Rahim Vs. The State and another]
-l1ll-

does not adversely affect the ocular account produced

by the witnesses. Reliance in this regard is placed on

2010 SCMR 1090 and 2009 SCMR 523.

11. Now adverting to the stance of the learned

counsel for the complainant and the learned A.A.G.

that the trial Court has awarded lesser punishment to

the appellant/convict despite the fact that no mitigating

circumstances prevail in the present case. The learned

trial Judge has held that the murder was the result of

sudden fight over a hand-cart dispute, no previous

enmity was there inter se the parties and the

appellant/convict gave a single stab to the deceased.

The above facts were taken as _ mitigating

circumstances by the learned trial Court and the

appellant was convicted under section 302(c) PPC by

awarding him punishment of fourteen years rigorous

imprisonment. No doubt, mitigating circumstances

mentioned by the learned trial Court can be considered

for avoiding the capital punishment of death sentence

[Cr.A No. 135-M of 2018 Mian Gul Rahim Vs. The State and another]
-12-

but not in the case of awarding punishment under

section 302(c) PPC keeping in view the attending facts

and circumstances of the present case. Record shows

that the present case is that of a single accused who has

been charged for inflicting knife blow to the deceased

which proved fatal and caused the death of the

deceased. It is also noticeable that the occurrence

originated from a petty matter and there is no evidence

of premeditation on the part of the appellant/convict,

therefore, the Court in such like circumstances should

not lose sight of the principle of proportionality and

should avoid the award of capital punishment to an

accused. But in the present case the learned trial Court

has penalized the appellant/convict under Section

302(c) PPC which is not fair just keeping in view the

mode and manner in which the appellant/convict

inflicted knife injury to the deceased. Since, proof of

the sort specified in Section 304 PPC is not available in

the present case and the mitigating circumstances are

[Cr.A No. 135-M of 2018 Mian Gul Rahim Vs. The State and another]
-13-

available for avoiding death sentence to the

appellant/convict as discussed above, therefore, in

estimation of this Court Section 302 (b) PPC would be

the right section under which the appellant/convict

should be convicted by enhancing his sentence to

imprisonment for life as ‘tazir’.

12. In view of the above discussion, the

instant appeal, being devoid of merits, is dismissed, the

connected Cr.R No. 44-M/2015 preferred by the State

is allowed and the impugned judgment of the learned

trial Court is modified by enhancing sentence awarded

to the appellant Mian Gul Rahim in terms that his

conviction is converted from Section 302 (c) PPC to

Section 302(b) PPC. Resultantly, the sentence awarded

to the appellant/convict of fourteen (14) years rigorous

imprisonment is enhanced to rigorous imprisonment

for life and the compensation of Rs.200,000/- (rupees

two hundred thousand) enhanced to Rs.600,000/-

(rupees six hundred thousand) to be paid by the

[Cr.A No. 135-M of 2018 Mian Gul Rahim Vs. The State and another]
-14-

appellant/convict to the legal heirs of the deceased in

terms of Section 544-A, Cr.P.C or in default thereof

the same shall be recovered as arrears of land revenue.

Benefit of Section 382-B, Cr.P.C is extended to the

appellant/convict. The trial Court is directed to issue

modified jail warrant in respect of the appellant/convict

and transmit the same to the Superintendent Jail where

the appellant is confined. The criminal revision petition

bearing Cr.R No. 07-M/2016 preferred by widow of

the deceased stands dismissed for having become

infructuous.
