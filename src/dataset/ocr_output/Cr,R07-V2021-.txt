JUDGMENT

MUSARRAT HILALL, J- This criminal revision petition
is directed against the order dated 03.10.2020 passed by
the learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, Swabi at Lahor,
whereby application moved from defence side for
transposition of the entire evidence earlier recorded in
previous trial of the acquitted co-accused was allowed.
Aggrieved therefrom, petitioner has filed the instant

criminal revision petition.

2. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended
that the impugned order dated 03.10.2020 is not

sustainable as the same was made on the application of
Cy

accused-respondent and was allowed with the consent of
the Public Prosecutor in absence of the petitioner and his
counsel which has come as a surprise to the petitioner;
that before making the impugned order, notices were not
issued to the witnesses already examined in the earlier
judicial proceedings, therefore, the order dated
03.10.2020 shall be set aside and the trial Court be
directed to first summon the witnesses and then proceed

with the trial.

3. As against that, learned counsel for accused-
respondent contended that the evidence recorded at the
earlier judicial proceedings is very much admissible in
the subsequent proceedings; that on the arrest of
absconding accused, the statement recorded under
Section 512 Cr.P.C does not stand wipe off; that accused
is a similarly circumstanced person, therefore, not
transposing the evidence recorded in the earlier
proceedings would amount to treating a person in a
similar situation in a dissimilar manner. Learned counsel

further contended that the impugned order does not suffer
from any infirmity; hence, the instant criminal revision

petition deserves to be dismissed.

Arguments heard and record perused.

Section 512 Cr.P.C is designed to meet a

definite purpose and that is, to preserve the evidence

against the absconding accused. The ibid Section reads as

follows:-

512, Record of evidence in absence of
accused. (1) If it is proved that an accused
person has absconded, and that there is no
immediate prospect of arresting him the Court
competent to try or send for trial, to the Court of
Session or High Court such person for the offence
complained of may, in his absence, examine the
witnesses (if any) produced on behalf of the
prosecution, and record their depositions. Any
such deposition may, on the arrest of such
person, be given in evidence against him on the
inquiry into, of trial for the offence with which
he is charged, if the dependant is dead or
incapable of giving evidence or his attendance
cannot be procured without an amount of delay,
expense or inconvenience which, under the
circumstances of the case, would be
unreasonable,

A plain reading of the above quoted provision

shows that when a person has absconded and there is no

immediate prospect of his arrest and the offence for

which he is charged is punishable with death or

imprisonment for life, the Court may examine the witness
produced by the prosecution and record his deposition
and when the accused is arrested, then at the stage of
trial, if any of such witnesses are not available being dead
or cannot be found or is incapable of giving evidence or
his attendance cannot be obtained without an amount of
delay, expenses or inconvenience, and when the matter is
between the same party, then the statements recorded
under Section 512 Cr.P.C may be accepted in the

evidence.

5. In the instant case, three accused were
charged for the murder of one Muhammad Ismail, the
brother of the petitioner and also causing injuries to his
father. An FIR to this effect was registered against Ibrar,
Iftikhar and Nigar (sons of Mehr Dil) on 15.09.2017,
under Section 302/324 PPC. Iftikhar and Nigar faced trial
and were acquitted by the learned trial Court on
27.11.2019 and the accused-respondent was proceeded
under Section 512 Cr.P.C. An appeal against the
judgment dated 27.11.2019 has been admitted by this

Court on 08.03.2021 for regular hearing.
6. After remaining absconder, the accused-
respondent was arrested after three years, whereafter his
case was submitted before the learned trial Court for trial.
On 03.10.2020, the accused-respondent submitted an
application before the learned trial Court for transposition
of the entire evidence recorded in the trial of co-accused
which was allowed by the learned trial Court on the same
date, not being objected by the Public Prosecutor. Neither
the complainant, the most aggrieved person in the case
nor his counsel was in attendance. Perusal of the order
dated 03.10.2020 reveals that the same has been allowed

without assigning any reason.

7. Article 47 of Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order,
1984 mandates how the statements of witnesses recorded
in one judicial proceedings can be admissible in
subsequent judicial proceedings. For ready reference, the

said Article is reproduced as under:-

47. Relevancy of certain evidence for
proving, in subsequent proceeding the
truth of facts therein stated. Evidence given
by a witness in a judicial proceeding, or before
any person authorized by law to take it, is
relevant for the purpose of proving, in a
subsequent judicial proceeding, or in a later
stage of the same judicial proceeding, the truth
of the facts which it states, when the witness is
dead or cannot be found, or is incapable of
giving evidence, or is kept out of the way by the
adverse party, or if his presence cannot be
obtained without an amount of delay or expense
which, under the circumstances of the case, the
Court considers unreasonable.

Provided that--

The proceeding was between the same
parties or representatives-in-interest;

The adverse party in the first proceeding
had the right opportunity to cross-examine;

The questions in issue were substantially
the same in the first as in the second proceeding.

A plain reading of the aforementioned Article
indicates that the evidence given by any witness in an
earlier judicial proceedings would be relevant for the
purpose of its proving in proceedings at a later stage

provided that;

i __the witness is dead
ii, Or cannot be found
iii. Or incapable of giving evidence
iv. Or is kept out of the way by the adverse party

v. Or if his presence cannot be obtained without any
amount of delay or expenses

8. While allowing the application dated
(03.10.2020, none of conditions mentioned in the ibid
Article were satisfied before transposition of the

statements recorded under section 512 Cr.P.C. It appears
that while allowing the application of the accused-
respondent, only the acquittal of co-accused was taken
into consideration. If the decision was to be based on
previous evidence without satisfying the conditions
mentioned in Article 47 of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order,
1984, then accused should not have been arrested and

should have been acquitted in absentia.

9. In a judgment passed by august Supreme
Court in case titled â€˜State through Advocate General
.Vs. Farman Hussain and others reported in PLD 1995
SC 1, the Apex Court held that in the absence of any
direct evidence, the mere declaration that "delay and
unnecessary adjournment" would be involved in
procuring the appearance of witness was not sufficient
for satisfying the relevant condition of section 33 of the
Evidence Act (Article 47 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984)
which is to the effect that it should have been proved that

the witness could not be found.

10. There is no indication in the impugned order
dated 03.10.2020 as to how the learned trial Court

satisfied itself about the ingredients of the law on the
subject before allowing the impugned order. Not even a
whisper. After the arrest of the absconding accused, if
such witnesses are alive, available and capable of giving
evidence then the statements recorded under Section 512

Cr.P.C cannot be utilized as substantive evidence.

11. In view of the above, the order dated
03.10.2020 is a queer and made in haste, therefore, the
same is set aside. The learned trial Court is directed to

proceed with the case strictly in accordance with law.
