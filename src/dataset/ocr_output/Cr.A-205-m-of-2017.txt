of 2017 filed by the appellant against his
conviction and sentence dated 26.09.2017 of the
Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge-
l/Izafi Zila Qazi Buner at Dagger.
2. The complainant namely Mst.
Rashida (PW-4) lodged a report on 27.12.2015
at 23:00 hours at her home which was reduced
into writing by Muhammad Khalid Sub
Inspector police station Gagra (PW-3). In
pursuance - thereof FIR No. 1141 dated
28.12.2015 was registered under section 302

NAWAB O8 Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
PPC at Police Station Gagra. District Buner.
Muhammad KhalidKhan, SI (PW-3) received
“information of the occurrence that a lady had
been killed, whereafter : he proceeded to the
place of occurrence i.e. house of the deceased
namely Mst. Wahida Naz wife of Luqman Shah.
Met. Rashida wife of Fazal Wahid reported the .
matter to the police official that the deceased
was her sister who had married to one
Fazal Aziz resident of Deena, District Swabi.
Out of the said wedlock ‘a son namely
Jamal Said aged about 16/17 years had been’
born. Due to strained relationship the lady got
divorced, whereafter she remained at her
mother’s house for % years. The deceased then
contracted another marriage with one Luqman
Shah son of Sultan Shah resident of Swabi.
From the said wedlock five (5) children were ©
born. The husband of the deceased was stated to
have left the village for earning livelihood in
District Swabi about nine or ten days before the
date of occurrence. The house of the
complainant was also stated to be situated near

the house of the deceased. The complainant has

NAWAB OB Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
further stated in her report that she had been
sleeping along with her other family members
"in her house that their neighbor Zawar Khan
came and disclosed that her sister had been fired
at and resultantly killed by some unknown
person. She rushed to her sister’s house and
found her lying dead there. No one was named
in the FIR and the complainant added that they
have no enmity with anyone.

3. Investigation in the case was
underway that a kid namely Marwa aged about
9/10 years, daughter of Luqman Shah as well as
deceased got her statement recorded under
section 161 as well as 164 Cr.P.C, naming the
accused/appellant for causing murder of her
mother. The husband and brother of the deceased
namely Luqman Shah and Gul Said got their
statements recorded on 29.01.2015 and
03.02.2016, wherein they also charged the
accused/appellant for commission of the offence.
4. The accused was later on arrested
and a pistol was also recovered from him which
was sent to the FSL along with the empties

shown recovered in the case for checking as to

NAWAB OB Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
whether it had been fired from the recovered
pistol or not. In this respect, the FSL report was
received in positive.
5. After submission of complete
challan, charge was framed against the accused,
to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
The prosecution examined as many as nine (9)
witnesses, whereafter, statement of the accused
was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C. On
conclusion’ of the trial in-the case, the
accused/appellant was convicted vide judgment
dated 26.09.2017 of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-11 Buner at Dagger and was
sentenced as follows;

“Under section 302 (b) PPC to life
imprisonment along with compensation
of Rs. 500,000/- under section 544-A (2)
Cr.P.C, or in default thereof to suffer six
(6) moths simple imprisonment. The
appellant was also extended the benefit
of section 382-B Cr.P.C.”

The accused/appellant impugned
his conviction and sentence through the instant
appeal. |
6. Learned counsel for the
appellant/convict submitted ‘in his arguments

that the accused was charged with a delay of 32

NAWAB DB Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
days after consultation and due deliberations.
He further added that the source of satisfaction
stated by the witnesses was not believable. He
submitted further that motive for the killing
could not be proved and there had been no
evidence against the appellant/convict, but
despite that he has been convicted and
sentenced to life imprisonment.

7. Learned counsel for the
complainant stated in rebuttal that the
complainant had got no ill-will or ulterior
motive towards the appellant and that he has
been charged after due satisfaction. He added
further, that the recovered pistol as well as
empties recovered from the spot had a matching
report, which establish the case against the
appellant/eonvict and he had therefore been
rightly convicted for the commission of the
offence.

8. The learned Astt: A.G. adopted the
arguments of learned counsel for the
complainant and supported him in_ his

arguments.

NAWAB DB Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
9. We have heard arguments of
learned counsel for the parties, learned Astt:
A.G. appearing on behalf of the State and
perused the record.

10. The most important evidence in
the case in hand is the statement of the child
witness namely Marwa daughter of Luqman
Shah examined as PW-6. At the time of
recording of her statement her age was 9/10
years. The learned trial Court had put certain
questions to her and had satisfied itself
regarding understanding of the child vis-a-vis
her capability for deposing as witness. In her
examination-in-chief she stated that she had
gone to her neighbor’s house for bringing
‘Lasay’ (ot) one day before the date of
occurrence. She met the accused Asad Shah in
the street, who handed her a piece of paper
inscribed with his mobile phone number and
told her that it should: be handed over to her
mother. She accordingly brought the said piece
of paper and handed over to her mother i.e. the
deceased then alive, who replied that she did not
want to talk to any stranger. The

NAWAB DB Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
appellant/convict was stated to have entered their
house one day before the occurrence at Jsha time
and was told by her mother that her husband was
not at home and he should therefore immediately
leave the house and should not throw stones at the
door of their house. The witness have added
further, that on the night of occurrence she woke
up on the sound of firing ‘and called the
neighbours, who informed her aunty namely Mst.
Rashida. She found her mother dead, whereafter,
the police came and took her to the police station.
She charged the accused Asad Shah for the
murder of her mother.

11. This child who was presented as star
witness of the prosecution against the appellant
had not seen the occurrence. The motive narrated
by this witness is also of such a nature that do not
seem to be that much potent to have compelled
the appellant to kill the deceased. Even otherwise
the statement of a child witness is to be accepted
with great care and caution. The Hon’ble Supreme
Court of Pakistan in the case of “Ulfat Hussain
ws The State” reported as “2010 SCMR 247”

held as follows;

NAWAB OB Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
“Accused was convicted by Trial Court

under S§. 302 (6) P.P.C and was

sentenced to death, which sentence was
maintained by High Court. Plea raised

by accused was that his conviction was

based upon sole testimony of child

witness, which was neither corroborated

by medical evidence nor with weapon of
offence. Though in principle, conviction

could be based upon testimony of an

intelligent and understanding child

witness but Courts had generally

preferred to adopt settled principle of
prudence and rule of care attached to

sole testimony of child witness despite

child’s intelligent deposition. No

evidence was available on record to

corroborate testimony of child witness as

medical evidence and recovery of
weapon of offence did not furnish

required support. Appeal was allowed

accordingly.

In this regard, further reliance can

also be placed on the judgments reported as

“PLD 1995 Supreme Court 1, 1985 P Cr. LJ
2500 (Lahore), 2013 P Cr. LJ 708 (Peshawar)
and 2017 P Cr. LJ 509 (Karachi).

12, Beside this witness the other
witness namely Luqman Shah, husband of the
deceased who was examined as PW-5 was
neither available in house nor was witness to
any of the circumstance in the case except the
recovery of a piece of paper whereupon mobile
number of the appellant had been inscribed. The
complainant namely Mst. Rashida was also

examined as PW-4 but she was also neither the

NAWAB DB Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
eye-witness nor had witnessed any of the
circumstance except the recovery memo Ex.
PW-5/1, vide which the dead body of the lady
was handed over to her. She had named the
accused/appellant in her statement recorded in
the Court, however she had failed to name him
in her first report nor had ever recorded any
statement thereafter, during “the course of
investigation.

13. Now coming to the circumstantial
evidence relied upon by the prosecution it is
enumerated as follows;

i. recovery of pistol 30 bore from the
accused/appellant and .supporting FSL
report;

i, recovery of a piece of paper whereupon
mobile number of the appellant had been
inscribed;

Empties recovered from the spot
had not been sent to the FSL earlier. Same were
lying in the police station and were sent to ‘the
FSL along with the pistol on 29.01.2016,
wherefrom a matching report Ex, PW-7/27 has

-been received. The empties -were recovered

NAWAB DB Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Atl
Mr. Justice Wigqar Ahmad
-10-

from the spot vide recovery memo Ex. PW-2/1
on 28.12.2015. Keeping it in the police station
and then sending the same to FSL along with
pistol dilutes the force of the said recovery and
the matching report of the FSL. Reliance in this
respect, is placed'on the judgment in the case of

“Israr_Ali_v/s The State” reported as “2007

SCMR_525” wherein the Hon’ble Apex Court

observed as follows;

Crime empty was not sent tothe expert
immediately after taking into possession and
the weapon of offence was recovered from
the convict/appellant after his arrest as borne
out from the statement of P.W.16. P.W.15
Muhammad Arshad had taken possession of
Crime-empty Exh.P.7 vide memo. Exh.P.H.
on 10-10-1999, His statement is silent to
whom he had given the said memo. P.W.14
Muhammad Akhtar. stated in his
examination-in -chief that Muhammad
Arshad S.-I, handed over to him sealed
parcel containing crime-empty for safe
custody in the Malkhana. This fact was not
mentioned in his statement which was
recorded by Investigating Officer under
section 161, Cr.P.C. thrice on 10-10-1999
and 23-10-1999 as evident from cross-
examination which is to the following effect:-

"I narrated to the Investigating
Officer that parcel containing crime
empty was handed over to him by
Investigating Officer confronted with
Exh.D.C. where it is not so
recorded."

It was also admitted by him in cross-
examination that he did not state before the
Investigating Officer in his statement
Exh.D.C. that the parcel containing crime
empty was handed over to Khadim Hussain

NAWAB DB Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
. Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-ll-

P.W.A. He also admitted that he did not send
crime empty to expert till 1-12-1999,
Khadim Hussain’ P.W.4 stated in
examination-in-chief that he received parcel
containing empty bullet on 3-11-1999 from
Muhammad Akhtar P.W.14. He handed
over to Muhammad Ramzan for onward
transmission in the office. of Forensic
Science Laboratory. P.W.16 Khalid Rauf
arrested appellant on 5-12-1999. He also got
recovered the pistol from him on his
pointation. Thereafter he had handed over
pistol to P.W.4 Khadim Hussain. This type
of recovery of crime empty does not provide
strong corroboration qua the prosecution
version :

Further reliance in this respect is
also placed on the judgment of Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of
“Jehangir_v/s_ Nazar Farid and another”
reported as “2002 SCMR 1986”.

So far as the recovery of piece of
paper recovered in the case in hand is
concerned. Same has also been sent to FSL for
comparison with handwriting of the. appellant,
report in the said respect was exhibited in the
evidence as PW-7/24. The handwriting expert
found the two as matching which fact was
incorporated in the report of the FSL mentioned
above. It is important however that the
handwriting expert has not been examined in the
evidence. His examination was necessary, as

report of handwriting expert has not been

NAWAB OB Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
included

-12-

in those technical experts whose

statement or report has been held admissible per

se under section 510 Cr.P.C. The Hon’ble Karachi

High Court in the case of “Kaka Kishanchand v/s

The State” reported as “PLD 2003 Karachi 618”

observed as follows;

“34, From the above provision of law,
it is clear that this provision is
applicable in a case of report of
Chemical Examiner, Assistant
Chemical Examiner, . Serologist,
Finger-print and Fire-arm Expert
appointed by Government or of the
Chief Chemist of Pakistan Security
Printing Corporation Limited. If any
report is issued by the above named
officers in respect of various fields of
sciences mentioned in it then their
report can be produced in evidence
without calling them and can be used
as evidence in any inquiry or trial or
other proceedings under Criminal
Procedure Code. The Court is also
empowered to examine such person if
it is found necessary in the interest of
justice.

33. The handwriting science is a
completely different field and a
different science than the above
mentioned categories of science. As
such, the provisions of section 510,
Cr.P.C are not applicable in the case
of report of officers in respect of field
of science other than those mentioned
in the section. The trial Court has
misconstrued and misinterpreted the
said section. The above view is
supported by cases Zamir Hussain v.
Crown appellant Agha Wazir Abbas.”

The Hon’ble Lahore High Court in

the case of “Qasim Ali Malik_v/s The State”

reported as

“2012 P Cr.LJ 124” also expressed a

NAWAB OB Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All ~

Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-13-

similar view in Para 11 of the judgment, which is
reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

“Bare reading of the above quoted
provision of section 510, Cr.P.C.
makes it crystal clear that report of
the Handwriting Expert does not
figure in this provision and thus the
same is neither per se admissible nor
it can be read in evidence until and
unless proved in the manner
prescribed under Article-78 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984,
Point No.(ii) therefore is answered
accordingly.”

Since handwriting expert has not
been examined in the case in hand, therefore the
prosecution cannot rely on his opinion given in
the report of the FSL.

14. There has not been direct evidence
available with the prosecution..The prosecution -
has also failed to establish the case through
circumstantial evidence as they relied upon a
weaker type of evidence without netting the chain
from start till the end. Confidence inspiring
evidence is missing with the prosecution. Benefit
of doubt has to go to the appellant/convict as he
cannot be handed down a sentence of capital
punishment on the basis of such weaker type of

evidences. Reliance in this respect is placed on

the judgment of Hon’ble Apex Court in the case

NAWAB DB Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
i

olf

-14-

of “Fayaz_ Ahmad v/s The State” reported as

“2017 SCMR 2026”.

15. For what has been discussed
above, the appeal in hand is allowed by
extending the benefit of doubt to the
accused/appellant. He is resultantly acquitted of
the charge. These are reasons for our short order
.of even date which read as follows;

° For reasons to be recorded later, we
allow this appeal, set-aside the
judgment of conviction dated
26.09.2017 passed by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-l/zafi Zila
Qazi Buner at Dagger in case FIR No.
1141) dated 28.12.2015 registered
under section 302 PPC ‘at police
station Gagra District Buner and
resultantly acquit the appellant namely
Asad Shah son of Rizwan Shah of the
charges levelled against him. He be
released forthwith if not required in
any other case.”’
