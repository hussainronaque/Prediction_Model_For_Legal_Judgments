(Judicial Department)

Cr.MBA No. 1118-P/2020.
Taufiq Said Vs The State.

JUDGMENT
Date of hearing. 07.05.2020.

Petitioner(s) by: Mr. Abdul Rashid Pirzada Advocate.

State by: Ms. Sophia Noreen Advocate.

KeKK
IKRAMULLAH KHAN, J:- Through the instant bail

petition, petitioner Taufeeq Said seeks his release on bail in
case FIR No. 971 dated 25.12.2019, registered under Section
9-D KP CNSA 2019, at Police Station Choora, Mardan, wherein
he is charged for possessing three packets of Charas total
weighing 3330 grams, which was recovered by local police
from his possession.

2. I have heard learned counsel for petitioner,
learned AAG for the State and gone through the available
record.

3. Perusal of record reveals that petitioner was

arrested red handed on the spot while having a plastic bag in

his hand, which on search led to the recovery of 3330 grams
Charas. The prosecution case is duly corroborated by the
marginal witnesses present on the spot coupled with the
positive report of FSL, according to which the contraband
recovered from possession of petitioner was Charas, which
prima facie link the petitioner with the commission of
offence.

4. The main plea of learned counsel for petitioner is
that at the time of registration of present FIR i.e, 25.12.2019,
the local police was not authorized to search, seize or arrest a
person under Section 28 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control
of Narcotics Substances Act 2019 rather the powers were
vested in the “Authorized Officer” which has been defined in
Section 2(e) of the Act as under:-

“Authorized Officer” means,

i, An officer of the Directorate General and
below the rank of Sub Inspector,
authorized by the Director, or

ii. A_Police Officer/official not below the
Regional Police Officer.”
5. No doubt at the time of registration of the instant
case the local police was not empowered with the search,
seizure and arrest under Section 28 of the Act ibid, but later

on 315t January 2020, after promulgation of Khyber

Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotics Substances (Amendment)
Ordinance, 2020, a new sub-section 3 was added after sub-
section 2 of Section 59, whereby it was provided that:

“)all the actions taken, proceedings
commenced and things done by the
Department or Police from 4th September
2019 till the commencement of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa_ Control of Narcotics
Substances (Amendment) Ordinance 2020,
shall be deemed to have been validly taken,
commenced and done under this Act.”

6. Keeping in view the above provision of law, it is
clear that all the action done and proceedings conducted by
local police from 4‘ September 2019 till 31st January 2020
have been given protection however the instant case has
been registered on 25.12.2019, which also comes during the
above period of 4% September 2019 to 31* January 2020, so
the petitioner cannot take benefit of Section 28 of KP CNSA
2019 at this stage, as all the actions done during above period
by local police has been declared legal under the newly
amended Ordinance 2020. Learned counsel for petitioner has
relied upon the judgment of this Court rendered in Writ
Petition No.7254-P/2019, decided on 17.1.2020, where it was
held that the local police had no jurisdiction under Section 28
of the KP CNSA 2019 and allowed bail to the petitioner of that

case. Admittedly, at the time of disposal of the above writ

petition on 17.1.2020, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of
Narcotics Substances (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, was not
in field which was lateron promulgated therefore, the
petitioner of that petition was rightly allowed bail by this
Court at that time, however, now the newly promulgated Act
is in field whereby protection has been given to the action
and proceedings of local police, therefore, petitioner cannot
take benefit of the referred judgment of this Court at this
stage.

7. Apart from above, petitioner has also been
charged in other criminal cases of same nature, the copies of
those FIRs are available on file, which depicts that petitioner
is habitual offender and dealing in narcotics business. The
prosecution has collected sufficient material against
petitioner, which prima facie connects him with the
commission of a heinous offence falling under the prohibitory
clause of Section 497 Cr.PC, therefore he is not entitled to the
concession of bail. Hence this bail petition being devoid of
merit is dismissed. However, the prosecution/ SHO
concerned is directed to submit complete challan against the

petitioner before the learned trial Court within a fortnight

positively and thereafter the learned trial Court is expected to
conclude the trial expeditiously.
