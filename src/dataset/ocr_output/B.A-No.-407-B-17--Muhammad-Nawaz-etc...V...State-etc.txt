ABDUL SHAKOOR, J.--- Through this common

judgment, I intend to dispose of instant BA # 407-B

of 2017, connected B.A # 408-B / 2017, and BA

No.409-B / 2017, respectively, filed by Mohammad

Nawaz, Tauseef Ahmad and Sikandar Khan

petitioners / accused, being outcome of one and the

same FIR # 196 dated 02.6.2017 registered U/Ss-

302/324/34 PPC, at PS, Tajori District Lakki

Marwat. The petitioners / accused were declined bail

by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, Lakki
(S.B) Justice Abdul Shakoor
Marwat vide orders dated 05.7.2017 and 23.6.2017,

hence, approached this court for the concession of

bail.

2. Short relevant facts of the prosecution

case as set out in the FIR are that Nadir Khan

complainant along-with dead bodies of his son Abbas

Khan and nephew Dil Jan on 02.6.2017 at 21:30

hours reported the matter to police in injured

condition to the effect that his niece namely,

Mst:Shamshada Bibi is married to Tauseef and

about three months ago relations between the spouses

became strained. On the eventful day he along-with

his son Abbas Khan and nephew Dil Jan were going

to the house of his niece situated at Ghulam Khel

Adamzai in order to reconciliate the matter. On

reaching near the house of said Tauseef at about

18:45 hours Tauseef, Mohibullah sons of Nawaz

Khan, Muhammad Nawaz s/o Mir Ghafar and

Sikandar s/o Muzzafar residents of Ghulam Khel

(S.B) Justice Abdul Shakoor
Adamzai duly armed with Kalashni-kovs came out of

the Baitak of Tauseef and on seeing the complainant

party, all the four accused fired at them with

intention to kill, as a result of which, Abbas Khan

and Dil Jan got hit and fell down on the ground while

the complainant received injury in his head. Accused

after commission of the crime fled away from the

spot. Abbas Khan died on the spot while Dil Jan

injured succumbed to his injuries on the way to

hospital. Motive as disclosed in the report was

dispute over women-folk. The accused were charged

for the commission of crime. Thus, the accused were

booked in the ibid FIR.

3. Learned counsel for petitioners /

accused contended that the orders of the learned

lower court are capricious, perverted, against facts,

law and is against the settled norms of august courts

in administration of criminal justice; that the story of

FIR is highly doubtful and the petitioners / accused

(S.B) Justice Abdul Shakoor
are innocent and have been falsely charged; that no

specific role of firing has been attributed rather a

general role of firing has been attributed to all the

accused; that the circumstantial evidence in shape of

blood stained earth, recovery of empties from the

spot and blood stained garments also falsifies the

complainant’s version; that complainant has not

come forward with clean hands and he_ has

suppressed the factum of counter version as given in

FIR No. 197 of the even date U/S-324/34 PPC; that

site-plan, medicolegal and PM reports and FIR

contradicts each other; Learned counsel for

petitioners stressed much that the present case is a

cross case of case FIR No.197 of the even date and

Police Station registered under Section. 324/34 PPC

lodged by one Mohibullah being complainant against

the complainant party of the instant case FIR No-

196; that it is not ascertainable that who was

aggressor and who was aggressed upon; that the

(S.B) Justice Abdul Shakoor
above all suggests the case of petitioner / accused

one of further inquiry.

4. Conversely, the learned Addl: A.G

appearing on behalf of State duly assisted by the

private counsel for respondent / complainant

vehemently opposed the arguments of learned

counsel for the petitioners / accused by arguing that

mere lodging an FIR against the complainant party of

the instant case as counter blast does not make the

alleged incident as cross-version for the purpose of

bail of petitioners / accused; that the petitioners /

accused are directly charged for the commission of

the offence wherein two persons have lost their lives

and the complainant got injured which comes under

the Prohibition contained under Section. 497 Cr.P.C;

that the medical evidence, motive, recoveries support

the prosecution case, thus, petitioners / accused are

not entitled for the concession of bail at this stage.

(S.B) Justice Abdul Shakoor
5. Arguments of learned counsel for the

parties as well as of learned AAG for the State heard

and record gone through with their valuable

assistance.

6. Perusal of record reveals that the

accused / petitioners are directly charged by name in

the initial murasila report as well as in the FIR for the

commission of offence; in the light of the motive so

introduced and the fact of relationship between the

parties who are co-villagers, question of mis-

identification does not arise at all. The accused /

petitioners have been attributed effective role of

firing at the two deceased and the injured

complainant. Moreover, the offence also falls within

the ambit of prohibition contained U/S-497 Cr.P.C.

7. Mere floating counter version in shape

of cross case FIR # 197 dated 02.6.2017, in the

circumstances shall not be ground for grant of bail,

reliance is placed on case titled " Nasir Muhammad

(S.B) Justice Abdul Shakoor
Wassan and another V. The State (1992 SCMR

501)"

8. Tentative assessment of the available

record shows that the accused / petitioners have

directly been charged in the initial report for heinous

offence, as a result of which two persons have lost

their lives while the complainant himself received

Fire-arm injuries. The punishment provided for the

offences falls within the restrictive clause of Section.

497 Cr.P.C. Recoveries from the place of occurrence,

Post Mortem reports of the deceased persons and

medicolegal report of the injured prima-facie

connects the petitioner / accused with the

commission of offence. The motive has also been

well explained for the alleged occurrence, and there

is no chance of mis-identification as the parties are

not only co-villagers but also relative inter-se. Much

has been argued before this court from either side,

but discussion on all these points would amount to

(S.B) Justice Abdul Shakoor
deeper appreciation of evidence at bail stage which

has always been deprecated by the Hon’ble Superior

Courts.

9. The mere registration of cross case

would not furnish the court a valid ground for

extending the benefit of concession of bail to the

accused who other-wise on the basis of available

record appears to be prima-facie connected with the

crime which falls within the Prohibitory clause of

Section. 497 Cr.P.C. As already hinted hereinabove

that complainant have assigned the specific role to

the accused persons for causing death to one of his

son and nephew and injured himself severely with

lethal weapon. In this view of the matter prima-facie

opinion of further inquiry in favour of petitioners /

accused being not possible, thus, question of further

inquiry would not arise at all mere on the registration

of the cross case vide FIR No. 197. In this regard

reference can be made to Hafiz Khuda Bakhsh V.

(S.B) Justice Abdul Shakoor
State (PLD 1988 Supreme Court 413), Arbab Ali V.

Karnosi & others (1985 SCMR 195), Shahadat Ali

V. Mubarak Shah and another (PLD 1986 Supreme

Court 347) and Mst: Bashiraan Bibi V. Nissar

Ahmad Khan (PLD 1990 Supreme Court 83).

10. For what has been discussed

hereinabove, the petitioners / accused have failed to

make out a case for the indulgence of this court to

extend them the benefit of concession of bail, thus,

this petition being without any substance is hereby

dismissed.

Announced.
