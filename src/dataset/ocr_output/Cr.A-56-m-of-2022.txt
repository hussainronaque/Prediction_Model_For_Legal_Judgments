Dr. Khurshid Iqbal, J.-

1. The Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi
Zilla Qazi of Tehsil Warri, in District Dir Upper,
tried Said Afzal (appellant) on the charge of
possessing an unlicensed arm (Kalashnikov)
punishable u/s. 15 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Arms Act, 2013 (KP AA). By his judgment
dated 23.02.2022, he convicted the appellant to three
years rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs.10,000/-,
in default of payment of fine, he was further ordered
to undergo one month simple imprisonment. He was
extended the benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. The
appellant challenged his conviction before this

Court.

2. Facts shortly are that Inspector
Attaullah Khan (also the SHO) of Police Station (PS)
Jaggam in Tehsil Warri of District Dir Upper, got
spy information that Said Afzal (appellant) and his
brother Naseeb Rawan, were present in their house.
Both the accused were Proclaimed Offenders in a
case FIR # 64, dated 18.04.2015 u/ss. 506/427/34,
PPC. The information about their presence in their
house created an opportunity for the local police to
arrest them. Inspector Attaullah Khan, thus, led a
police and rushed to the house of the accused. As the
police party reached there, it saw both the accused
armed with Kalashnikov were running away. As a
result of a successful chase, the police party arrested
them. Each accused had a Kalashnikov, a magazine
loaded with 50 rounds and 20 rounds in pocket,
which are taken into possession vide recovery
memos (Ex:PW7/2 and 7/3). The incident was
recorded in the form of a murasila (Ex:PW5/1) on

the spot. The murasila was converted into the FIR.

3. Final report of investigation (Challan)
against the appellant as well as the absconding
co-accused was put for trial before the trial Court.

Charge was framed against them, to which, they

Bakht Sher Ali Khan/Stenographer 5-8) HON RU: URSHID |

3
didn’t plead guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution
examined a total of Nine (09) witnesses and then
closed its evidence. The appellant as well as other
co-accused recorded their statements u/s. 342,
Cr.P.C, in which though they denied all the charges
leveled against them and professed innocence,
however, they didn’t avail the opportunity to record
evidence in defence; or to give statements on oath.
During the course of trial, co-accused Nasib Rawan
was on exempted from personal appearance.
His exemption was recalled. However, he failed
to appear. So, proceeding u/s.512, Cr.P.C were
commenced against him. After hearing arguments of
learned counsel for the appellant and learned APP
for the State, the appellant was convicted u/s.15 AA,
and sentenced him in the terms mentioned above

vide impugned judgment dated 23.02.2022.

4, Arguments of counsel for the appellant
and A.A.G for the State heard and record gone

through.

5. Inspector Attaullah (PW7) prepared
separate memos of recoveries made from both the

accused. The contents of each memo, except names

of the accused and numbers of the Kalashnikov,

‘Bakht Sher Ali Khan/Stenographer (5.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr, KHURSHID IOBAL

4
are the same, including most notably its marginal
witnesses. Each memo was signed by four witnesses.
Two of them, constable Iqbal No.592 (PW3) and
constable Rahman Uddin No. 663 (PW8) were
police officials and two others, namely,
Sher Muhammad Khan and Ali Khan (PW6), were
private persons. The statement of Ali Khan, recorded

in examination-in-chief reads as under:

UU Out ee Suk aes”

ek Sndbhe dtp tel cp Siz

ere AL 6O eye TM AL

UE Lele & Us tas Sir ride

“eu curLudid
6. The two police officials no doubt
supported the recovery. However, in the light of the

‘

above statement of the private prosecution witness,
the recovery stands not proved. The Seizing Officer
(PW7) and the two constables (PWs-3 and 8)
referred to Ali Khan and the other private witness,
namely, Sher Muhammad Khan. There is a settled
Judicial opinion that police officials are as much

good witnesses as any other. However, in the case

in hand, this view could not be subscribed to.

Bakbt Sher Ali Khan/Stenographer GB) HON'BLE MB. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL

Had PW Ali Khan not been examined then the
evidence of the police officials could have been

worthy of credit.

7. PW Ali Khan was neither cross
examined by the defence counsel nor was he
declared as a hostile witness by the prosecution. This
single statement alone is sufficient for the acquittal
of the appellant. A negative inference could be
drawn in respect of the non-production of Sher
Muhammad Khan, the other private witness of the
recovery to the effect that had he been produced,
he, too, would have not supported the prosecution
version. Constable Iqbal (PW3) confirmed his
signature on the recovery memo as its marginal
witness. He also deposed that he obtained the
signatures and thumb impressions of one Rahman-
ud-Din and other private witnesses. The murasila
shows that lady constables also included in the
police personnel. But their presence was not shown
in the site plan. His deposition shows that the places
of presence of the lady constables at the crime scene

were not shown in the site plan.

8. The case properties were not produced

in evidence before the trial Court. The PWs

Bakhu Sher Ali Khan/Stenographer (5B) HON" G URSHID fOBAL
6
categorically admitted this material aspect of the

case. For example, Constable Iqbal (PW3) stated:

9 aw oe bec Seow,”

eR V ESI

9. Similarly, ASI Ziaullah (PW4), the
Moharrir of the Police Station, who received the case

property, also admitted this fact as follows:

NPN 238 ol Se syn”

“err Kobo NL beet poK ie

10. The same was the statement of ASI

Samiullah (PW5) and the Seizing Officer (PW7).

11. Non-production of the case property in
evidence by the prosecution has come up for judicial
consideration in many cases before the higher courts.
Reference may be made to a few rulings as in the
case of Gul Dast Khan v. The State (2009 SCMR
431), the non-production of case property was
considered a material dent in the prosecution case.
Other cases are Muhammad Khan and another y.
The State through Arman Gul, S.H.O. and another,
(2016 MLD 1850) [Peshawar High Court] and Ali
Asghar Lashari v. The State, 2019 PCr.LJ Note 53

[Sindh (Hyderabad Bench)].

Bakht Sher Ali Khan/Stenographer @.B) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID [OBAL

12, AS] Ziaullah (PW4) though stated in his
examination-in-chief that after receipt, he made
entries in respect thereof in the relevant register
(No.19). But the relevant extract was not produced.
Armourer Wajid Ullah No.193 (PW1) did not
mention in his statement that the case property was
sealed when it was produced before him. He stated
only this much that on 08.04.2016 he opened the
Kalashnikov, which he examined in front of the
Investigating Officer and constable Bahramand. ASI
Ziaullah could not answer a question regarding the

Seals put on the parcels containing the case property.

13. Inspector Attaullah (PW7) admitted that
the D.Ds in respect of departure from and arrival
back into the Police Station were not produced. In a
case like this one, notably for the reason that the case
has been registered on the report of the police
official, non-production of DDs would be fatal for
the prosecution case. Reference may be made to the
cases Ghulam Mustafa alias Mushtaq Ali _v. The
State (2013 P Cr. L.J 860) [Sindh], and Wahab Ali
and_another_v, The State (2010 P Cr. LJ 157)

[Federal Shariat Court].

14. Finally, I shall advert to the confession of
the appellant recorded by a Judicial Magistrate
on 07.04.2016, the next day of the occurrence. The
confessional statement of the appellant and other
relevant documents such as questionnaire and
certificate pertaining to fulfilment of procedural
formalities coupled with the statement of the
Judicial Magistrate (PW9) would show that the
accused was produced for confessional statement
at 01:30 pm. They were given 30 minutes time to think
over his willingness to confess their guilt. As per the
certificate, the confessional statement of the appellant
was recorded at 01:30 pm, but in reply to the last
question, the Judicial Magistrate noted that 30 minutes
from 01:30 pm to 02:00 pm was given to the appellant
to seriously think over his decision to record
confession. His statement was supposed to be recorded
after 02:00 pm, instead of 01:30 pm. It is thus clear
that the 30 minutes time given to the appellant for
thinking is not proved. In his application dated
07.04.2016 for recording confessional statement of the
appellant, the I.0 stated that the appellant was arrested
yesterday. The Judicial Magistrate put question No.8 to
the appellant regarding the duration of his custody with
the police. The appellant replied that he remained
in police custody for one day. In order to fully ensure

Bakht Sher All KhawStenoprapher @.8) PBLE ICE Dr. KHURSHID JOBAI
9

that the appellant was voluntarily confessing to his
guilt, the Judicial Magistrate could have demonstrably
endeavoured to discover as to which time exactly the
appellant was arrested. Then, the Judicial Magistrate
did not record as to whether both the appellant and the
co-accused were made to sit at one and the same place
in the Court Room or not. Such an entry was necessary
in order to ascertain that the appellant individually got
an opportunity to seriously think over the warning of
the Judicial Magistrate. In such circumstances,
the Judicial Magistrate fulfilled the procedural
requirements in a mechanical fashion. The appellant
was a proclaimed offender in a 2015 criminal case,
which means that he was under a constant threat of his
arrest by the police. Had the Judicial Magistrate
perused the record of the case, he would have
definitely come across this aspect of the case viz-a-viz
the voluntariness of the appellant to confess to his
guilt. It needs no emphasis that in order to be believed
doubtlessly, a confession must be voluntary and true.
In Hashim Qasim and another _y. The State
(2017 SCMR 986), the Apex Court observed:

“It is trite law that for accepting a

confession, two essential

requirements must be fulfilled i.e.

that the confession was made

voluntarily, it was based on true

account of facts, leading to the crime
and the same was proved at the trial.

Bakht Sher Ali Khan/Stenographer (3.8) HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID 1OBAL
10

The superior Courts have also given
strict guidelines for the Magistrate,
recording confession, to be followed
without any exception which need
not be repeated herein, because long
line of authorities on this point is
already in the field.”

In Azeem Khan_and another v. Mujahid Khan and

others (2016 SCMR 274), it was held:

“Keeping in view the High Court
Rules, laying down a_ binding
procedure for ‘taking required
precautions and _ observing the
requirements of the provision of
section 364 read with section 164,
Cr.P.C. by now it has become a trite
law that before recording confession
and that too in crimes entailing
capital punishment, the Recording
Magistrate has to essentially observe
all these mandatory precautions. The
fundamental logic behind the same is
that, all signs of fear inculcated by
the Investigating Agency in the mind
of the accused are to be shedded out
Va and he is to be provided full
assurance that in case he is not guilty
or is not making a_ confession
voluntarily then in that case, he
would not be handed over back to the
police. Thereafter, sufficient time for
reflection is to be given after the first
warning is administered. At the
expiry of that time, Recording
Magistrate has to administer the
second warning and the accused shall
be assured that now he was in the
safe hands. All police officials
whether in uniform or otherwise,
including Naib Court attached to the
Court must be kept outside the Court
and beyond the view of the accused.
After observing all these legal
requirements if the accused person is
willing to confess, then all required
questions formulated by the High

Bakht Sher Ali Khan/Stenographer (.B) HON‘BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr, KHURSHID JOBAL

11

Court Rules should be put to him
and the answers given, be recorded
in the words spoken by him. The
statement of accused be recorded by
the Magistrate with his own hand
and in case there is a genuine
compelling reason then, a special
note is to be given that the same was
dictated to a responsible official of
the Court like Stenographer or
Reader and oath shall also be
administered to such official that he
would correctly type or write the
true and correct version, the accused
stated and _ dictated by the
Magistrate. In case, the accused is
illiterate, the confession he makes, if
recorded in another language i.e.
Urdu or English then, after its
completion, the same be read-over
and explained to him in the language,
the accused fully understand and
thereafter a certificate, as required
under section 364, Cr.P.C. with
regard to these proceedings be given
by the Magistrate under his seal and
signatures and the accused shall be
sent to jail on judicial remand and
during this process at no occasion he
shall be handed over to any police
official/officer whether he is Naib
Court wearing police uniform, or any
other police official/officer, because
such careless dispensation would
considerably diminish the voluntary
nature of the confession, made by the
accused.”

16. By a Cr.M No.327-M/2022, counsel for
appellant sought acquittal of co-absconding accused.
An absconder cannot be given the benefit of his
absence. Whatever the merits are, his case could
only be considered after his surrender to lawful

authority.

Bakht Sher Ali Khan/Stenographer 8) HON'BLE MA. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL

17. The conclusion of the above discussion

is that the prosecution has failed to prove the charge
against the appellant beyond reasonable shadow of
doubt. There are more than one material doubts, as
discussed above in the prosecution case. Even a
single reasonable doubt is sufficient for acquittal of

an accused person. Reliance is placed on the case

of Najaf Ali Shah vs. The State (2021 SCMR 736)

wherein it was held as infra:

“It is a well settled principle of law that
for the accused to be afforded this right
of the benefit of the doubt it is not
necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating uncertainty and if
there is only one doubt, the benefit of the
same must go to the petitioner.”

18, The same principle was reiterated in the

case of “The State through P.G. Sindhand others

versus Ahmed Omar Sheikh and others, reported as

2021 SCMR 873.

“It is settled since centuries that benefit
of doubt automatically goes in favour of
an accused. Even if a single circumstance
creates reasonable doubt in a prudent
mind regarding guilt of an accused then
the accused shall be entitled to such
benefit not as a matter of grace and
concession but as a matter of right and
such benefit must be extended to the
accused person(s) by the Courts without
any reservation.”

19. As sequel to the above reappraisal of
evidence, the instant appeal succeeds. Resultantly,
it is allowed. Consequently, the conviction and
sentence awarded to the appellants by the trial Court
vide judgment dated 23.02.2022 is set aside and the
appellant is acquitted from the charge. Furthermore,
the appellant is on bail, therefore, he and his sureties

are absolved from the liability of bail bonds.
