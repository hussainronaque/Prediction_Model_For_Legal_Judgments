SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- The appellants Lais Khan &

Abdullah have called in question the judgment dated
21.09.2020, authored by learned Additional Sessions Judge,
Banda Daud Shah, District Karak, whereby the appellants Lais
Khan & Abdullah have been convicted under section 302(b)
P.P.C read with section 34 P.P.C and sentenced to life
imprisonment each with Rs.1,00,000/- (one lac) compensation
under section 544-A Cr.P.C. to the legal heirs of deceased or in
default thereof, to undergo six months simple imprisonment.
The benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C has also been extended to
the convicts.

The complainant Mst Razmina has also filed
Criminal Revision, bearing No.30-B of 2020 for

enhancement of sentence awarded to the appellants. Since both
-2-

the matters are the outcome of one and the same judgment,
therefore, we intend to dispose of the same through this
common judgment.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on 10.07.2016 the
complainant Mst. Razmina alongwith her deceased husband
and sister-in-law (Mst. Shaida Bibi) alongwith kids were
proceedings to the relatives towards village Makori in a
Dotson pickup, when they reached near Dalun (Charaee), at
1630 hours, accused appeared there. Accused Abdullah was
duly armed with Kalashnikov while accused Lais Khan was
empty handed. The complainant and her sister-in-law were in
the front of seat of the Dotson while deceased (Imtiaz Ahmed)
alongwith kids were present in the rear portion of the Dotson.
Soon the vehicle reached near the accused, the accused
Abdullah signaled to stop, and the vehicle was stopped.
Accused Abdullah called the deceased to deboard from the
Dotson pickup. On this the complainant and Mst. Shaida Bibi
deboarded from the vehicle and proceeded towards the
accused. The deceased was immediately come on Paidan
(lex) of the vehicle. Meanwhile, accused Abdullah saw
towards his father/accused Lais Khan wherein his father
commanded his son/accused Abdullah to kill the deceased
whereas he fired upon the deceased. Resultantly, the deceased

fell down in the pickup. Complainant and Mst. Shaida Bibi
-3-

tried to overpower the accused Abdullah but he aimed his
Kalashnikov over them and due to fear they stopped. The
accused after commission of offence decamped from the spot.
Motive behind the occurrence was stated that accused
Abdullah had divorced the sister of deceased. Deceased
succumbed to his injuries on the way to civil hospital Teri.

3. Fazal Subhan ASHO (PW-9) reduced report of the
complainant in shape of F.I.R (Ex: PA), obtained the thumb
impression of the complainant on it, prepared injury sheet and
inquest report of the deceased and sent him to the doctor under
the escort of Constable Zahid Ullah (PW-2).

4. After completion of investigation, prosecution
submitted complete challan against the accused Lais Khan on
14.12.2016, while the accused Abdullah remained absconder.
After complying with the provision under section 265-C Cr.P.C, the
accused facing trial Lais Khan was charge sheeted on
19.01.2017, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
Proceedings u/s 512 Cr.P.C was initiated against accused
Abdullah vide order dated 19.01.2017 and the prosecution was
allowed to produce evidence against the absconding accused
also. Statements of some of the witnesses were recorded but
subsequently, co-accused Abdullah was arrested and
prosecution submitted supplementary challan against him.

After complying with the provision under section 265-C
-4-

Cr.P.C, accused Abdullah formally charge sheeted to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution was
invited to produce its evidence. The prosecution to prove its
case produced and examined as many as 11 witnesses, where
after, the accused were examined under section 342 Cr.P.C,
where they professed innocence and false implication,
however, they did not wish to be examined on oath as provided
under section 340(2) Cr.P.C, nor opted to produce defence
evidence. After hearing arguments from both the sides, the
learned trial Court vide impugned judgment dated 21.09.2020,
convicted the accused and sentenced them, as mentioned
above, hence, this appeal and the connected criminal revision.
5. The learned counsel for the parties alongwith Addl:
Advocate General representing the State were heard at length
and with their valuable assistance the record was gone through.
6. The tragedy occurred on 10.07.2016 at 16:30
hours, when the deceased along with his family, including the
complainant, Mst. Shaida and their kids were travelling in the
Datsun/ pickup to village Makori to visit the house of their
relative. The report tells that when the vehicle reached to the
place of incident the accused / appellants were present there,
signaled the driver to stop the vehicle. When the vehicle
stopped the complainant along with the eye-witness rushed

towards the appellants, when in the meanwhile the appellant
-5-

Lais Khan commanded his son to kill the deceased, who
opened fire at the deceased, who after receiving the firearm
injury fell down from the vehicle. It was further alleged by the
complainant that they rushed towards the appellant to catch
hold of them but being empty handed they could not succeed
and the accused/ appellants decamped from the spot. While on
their way, to hospital the deceased breathed his last, eventually
the dead-body was taken to Police Station Teri, where the
matter was reported to one Fazal Subhan ASHO, who was later
on examined as PW-09. After the report was penned down, the
injury sheet and inquest report were prepared where after the
dead-body was dispatched to the hospital under the escort of
Zahidullah No.752, who was examined as PW-01.

7. The learned trial Court on conclusion of the trial
convicted and sentenced the appellants as stated above, but this
court is to see as to whether the learned trial Court applied its
judicial mind to the facts and circumstances of the case and that the
prosecution evidence was fully appreciated. True that the matter
was reported by the complainant posing herself and another, as the
eye-witnesses and equally true that blood-stained earth along with
an empty of 7.62 bore were recovered from the spot, but this Court
is to see as to whether the prosecution proved its case to the hilt and
as to whether the witnesses could prove their presence on the spot at
the time of incident. This court is under the bounden duty to assess

and reassess the available evidence on file and to apply its judicial

-6-

mind to the material collected on file, so to avoid miscarriage of
justice.

8. This court is to see as to whether the witnesses could
establish their presence on the spot at the time of incident and as to
whether the testimony of the witnesses is confidence inspiring. The
complainant was examined as PW-04, who stated that on the day of
incident they arranged to visit the house of their relative at village
Makori, and for the purpose a datsun/pickup was arranged and so
the family including kids boarded in the vehicle, where the
deceased with his kids sat in the rear portion of the pickup, whereas
the complainant along with the eye-witness took the front seat. It
was for the prosecution to establish that what led the women to
occupy the front seat with an unrelated driver and that why the
deceased chose for himself the rear portion of the vehicle, as in
Pashtoon society this practice is not respected, that too when no
relation exists between the driver and the complainant. We are to
see as to whether the incident in issue occurred in the mode, manner
and at the stated time and also the presence of witnesses at the time
of incident. The investigating officer assigned different places to the
appellants, the eye-witnesses and the deceased but surprisingly no
place was assigned to the driver, and even the site-plan is silent in
this respect. We cannot ignore that the complainant stated that soon
after the incident they deboarded the vehicle and rushed towards the
appellant, whereas the driver was still inside the vehicle, but when
the Investigating Officer recorded the statement of the driver under

section 161 Cr.P.C, he told another story and stated that when he
-7-

reached to the place of incident, he saw the appellants, who
signaled him to stop and so he surrendered. He went on to say that
as he was all in fear so on coming down from the vehicle, he fell
down to the ground to avoid personal harm, on the other hand the
complainant and the eye-witness remained silent on this particular
aspect of the case. It is pertinent to mention that the Investigating
Officer produced the driver before the court of Judicial Magistrate,
who recorded his 164 Cr.P.C statement, where he stated that he
could witness the appellant Abdullah only at the time of incident
and did not observe the presence of Lias Khan. The contradiction
between the statements leads us nowhere but to hold that the
witnesses went in conscious attempt to bring their testimony in line
with the material on record and their this conscious attempt has
created dents in the prosecution case beyond repair. Both the
witnesses categorically stated that the accused/ appellant Lais Khan
commanded his son to kill the deceased, and on hearing the noise
the deceased emerged from the rear portion of the pickup, who was
fired at by the accused/ appellant Abdullah. The complainant and
the Investigating Officer did not support each other on this
particular aspect of the case, as the Investigating Officer stated that
the deceased afier receiving firearm injury fell to the ground and so
blood was recovered from point No.4, whereas the complainant
stated that the deceased did not fell to the ground rather after
receiving firearm injury he fell in the rear portion of the Datsun/
pickup. This major contradiction between the two has increased our

anxiety to search for independent corroboration, this is again
-8-

alarming that the Investigating Officer when realized what the
complainant stated he improved his statement and stated that the
deceased fell in the rear portion of the vehicle after receiving
firearm injury. If we admit what the witnesses stated then
prosecution will have to explain that how the blood stained earth
was recovered from point-‘B’, which is situated on the road. When
the complainant appeared as PW-04, she was particularly
questioned as to whether while placing the deceased in the Datsun/
pickup her hands were besmeared with blood to which she
categorically denied by offering an abnormal explanation, that as
the deceased did not fell to the ground so the witnesses did not
touch his body and in the said condition he was shifted to the Police
Station, her this explanation lacks confidence as she being the wife
of the deceased and when the deceased received firearm injury he
fell to the ground and these were the witnesses and none else who
should have placed his body in the vehicle and in that eventuality
her hands and clothes must have been besmeared with blood. We
are yet to know that when the dead-body was taken to Police
Station Teri in the Datsun/pickup driven by the driver who too was
present at the time of incident, what precluded the scribe to ask for
his signature as a rider to the report and that why his statement was
not recorded, despite the fact that the registration number of the
vehicle finds mention in the report. The prosecution is still to travel
a long way to prove the charges against the appellants as well as
their presence at the time of incident and at the time of report. None

of the witnesses including the driver finds mention in the columns

-9-

of identification both in the inquest as well as post mortem reports,
rather two witnesses from the village finds mention there. We are
still searching for an answer that how the co-villagers were
informed who were attracted to the Police Station at the time of
report and identified the dead-body before the police and afterwards
before the doctor at the time of post mortem examination. We
cannot ignore that it was the complainant who stated that soon after
the incident no one attracted from the village to the spot and that
these were the witnesses and the driver who took the deceased to
the Police Station. The record is silent that how and from what
source the co-villagers attracted to the Police Station despite the
fact that neither the deceased nor the witnesses were in possession
of mobile phones. We are still looking for an answer that how Eid
Muhammad father of the deceased reached to the hospital as none
of the witnesses got connected with him and that he reached to
Police Station after 30-minutes of arrival of the dead-body. The
scribe who was examined as PW-09 categorically stated that soon
after arrival of dead-body to the Police Station the matter was
reported at 18:30 hours, but he failed to explain that when Eid
Muhammad was not present at the time of arrival of the dead-body
to Police Station and also at the time of report then how his
signature was obtained as a rider, when the report had already been
made. PW Fazal Subhan could not account for, that when the
driver along with eye-witness Mst. Shaida was present in the Police
Station at the time of report, why none out of the two was asked to

verify the report as allegedly these were the witnesses who were
-10-

present at the time of incident and report as well. The dead-body
was examined by the doctor at 08:35 p.m. and after post mortem
prepared the post mortem report, where he mentioned the time
between injury and death as “instantaneous” and between death and
post mortem as “within four hours”. The statement of the
complainant on this particular aspect of the case is worth perusal,
where she stated that the deceased then injured after receiving
firearm injury survived for long 20-minutes and it was on the way
to hospital that he breathed his last. She further stated that after
receiving the firearm injury they remained on the spot for 10/15
minutes and thereafter started for the hospital, we do not agree with
what she stated, if the deceased was alive after receiving firearm
_ injury it would have been the prime duty of the witnesses to rush to
the hospital instead of waiting for long 10/15 minutes with no
purpose, on the spot, whereas PW-05 when appeared before the trial
Court she contradicted what the complainant stated, by stating that
the deceased soon after receiving firearm injury fell down and died
on the spot. PW-05 further stated that they rushed towards the
hospital without loss of time. The conflict between the witnesses
and the way they explained their presence on the spot leaves this
court nowhere but to hold that the witnesses were not present on the
spot, when the deceased was done to death. Guidance can be taken
from the judgment reported as, "Liaqat Hussain and others Vs Falak
Sher and others" (2003 SCMR 611(a), wherein it has been held:-

"(a) Eye-witnesses including the
complainant had failed to furnish a

plausible and acceptable explanation

-ll-

for being present on the scene of
occurrence and were — chance
witnesses---Prosecution case did not
inspire confidence and fell for short of
sounding probable to a man of
reasonable prudence”

9. We are anxious to know that when father of the
deceased was present at the time of report what precluded him to
accompany the dead-body of his son to the hospital for post mortem
examination and he hurriedly went to the spot, his this conduct
speaks nothing but mala fide and an inference can be drawn
regarding his absence at the time of report and thereafter. The
complainant stated that after making the report she along with the
other witnesses reached to the spot along with the Investigating
Officer in his official vehicle, but when the Investigating Officer
was examined on this particular aspect of the case, he stated that
when he reached to the spot, the complainant, eye-witness, Eid
Muhammad and other people were present on the spot. The
witnesses went in conflict throughout and their this inconsistency
caused great damage to the prosecution case. We are still struggling
hard to know as to whether the complainant was present at the time
of incident and these were the witnesses who took the deceased to
Police Station to report the matter. When both the documents i.e.
the first information report and the inquest report are placed in
juxtaposition, it surfaced that the complainant while reporting the
matter specifically mentioned the weapon used as Kalashnikov

whereas in the relevant column of inquest report the word ~»Lasl"'

-12-

"'Gwdti! has been mentioned. Another intriguing aspect of the case is
that the inquest report does not bear the F.LR number and sections
of law, had the complainant been present and reported the matter on
her very arrival to the Police Station then this discrepancy would
. not have occurred, but what can be gathered from that the
complainant and the eye-witness were not present at the time of
incident and even at the time of report, rather the deceased soon
after his death was taken to the Police Station by the co-villagers
and it was on later arrival of the complainant the report was made
whereas the injury sheet and inquest report had already been
prepared. This court feels no hesitation to hold that the preliminary
investigation was conducted and thereafter the report was made.

10. The Investigating Officer visited the spot, recovered
blood-stained earth along with an empty of 7.62 bore and on
pointation of the eye-witnesses the site-plan was prepared. The
record tells that the blood-stained earth was recovered from point
‘B’ where initially to the Investigating Officer the deceased after
receiving firearm injury fell down, though the Investigating Officer
soon thereafter changed his version by stating that the deceased did
not fall to the ground after receiving the fatal shot. We are to see as
to which of the witness was telling the truth and which not, and in
order to ascertain as to whether in fact the deceased did not fall to
the ground it was essential for the Investigating Officer to recover
the vehicle but he did not take the pains. Despite the fact that the
registration number of the vehicle finds mention in the report and

even it was the vehicle which was used for transporting the

-13-

deceased to Police Station but even then it was not taken into
possession which tells otherwise. If the statement of the driver is
. taken into consideration regarding the ownership of the vehicle
where he stated that the vehicle belong to one Munawar Din and
even this fact was mentioned in his 164 Cr.P.C statement, but the
Investigating Officer did not associate the said Munawar Din with
the process of investigation. This lack of interest on part of all
concerned leads us nowhere but to hold that either the incident did
not occur in the mode and manner or that no blood was found in the
vehicle and in order to wriggle out from the glaring contradiction
the Investigating Officer chose to conceal this material piece of
evidence without realizing the fact that his this concealment will
spoil the prosecution case.

11. The Investigating Officer recorded the statement of
the driver under section 161 Cr.P.C after three days of the
occurrence and his this belated statement has reduced the
evidentiary value of the statement of this witness. Though the driver —
was produced before the court of Judicial Magistrate where his
statement under section 164 Cr.P.C was recorded, but thereafter he
did not turn up, so was not produced during the trial and was
abandoned. The driver was an important witness and his non-
production tells otherwise, had he been present at the place of
incident he would have come to the Court of law to depose against
the appellants. In situation in hand no other inference can be drawn

but that if was produced he would have not supported the

-14-

prosecution case. Article 129 (g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,

1984, caters for the situation.

In case titled Tahir Khan Vs. The State (2011 SCMR
646), wherein it is held that:

“13. In the present case as observed above,
the clouds over the veracity of the
prosecution version began hovering with the
substitution of the initially nominated
persons in the F.LR. and also that
complainant did not appear as a witness. It
assumes relevance as he (Ghulam Hussain),
Sultan Mehmood and Ghulam Abbas were
given up by the prosecution and not
produced. The only possible conclusion is
that the prosecution sensed the risk of
producing them that they might not support
the said version. Their production thus was
withheld leaving doubts spreading all
around”.
12. The medical evidence does not support the
prosecution case, rather both contradicted each other when the
doctor was examined as PW-03, he stated that the deceased
received a single firearm injury and that the entry and exit wounds
were through and through. It is important to note that the deceased

at the time of receiving firearm injury was standing in the rear

-15-

portion of the vehicle at a considerable height whereas the appellant
was standing on the road, and in such eventuality the direction of
fire should have been from down to upward, but the opinion of the
doctor tells otherwise and it can safely be concluded that the
incident did not occur in the manner as narrated. True that medical
evidence is confirmatory in nature and it cannot outweigh the ocular
account provided it springs from unimpeachable source, which is
not the case in hand and this conflict between the two belies the
stance of the prosecution, more particularly regarding their presence
at the place of incident. The situation has beautifully been done by
the apex Court in its reported case, titled “Akhter Saleem and

another Vs the State and another” (2019 MLD 1107), it is held
that:

“12.The above factors, material
contradictions between ocular and
medical evidence create serious doubts
in the happening of alleged occurrence
and it is well settled law that even a
single doubt, if found reasonable, would
entitle the accused person to acquittal
and not a combination of several

doubts.”

13. The motive was stated to be the strained relations
between the accused and sister of the deceased which culminated
into a divorce and that it was the sense of revenge which led the
appellants to kill the deceased. The Investigating Officer did not

record the statement of the divorced lady i.e. sister of the deceased

-16-

and even her name did not figure throughout. The Investigating
Officer did not visit the house of deceased in order to inquire about
the strained relations between the two and even the sister of the
deceased did not come forward to confirm the stance of the
complainant. The prosecution failed to establish motive on record
that too in a situation where the cause of death was only and only
the strained relations between the husband and wife. The
Investigating Officer did not examine independent witnesses in this
respect and as such the motive alleged could not be proved. There is
no cavil to the proposition that once the prosecution alleges a
motive it is under the obligation to prove the same, failing which no

one else but the prosecution will suffer.

In case titled “Muhammad Ashraf alias Acchu Vs

The State" (2019 SCMR 652 Para-7), wherein it has been held. -

"7, The motive is always a double-
edged weapon. The complainant Sultan
Ahmad (PW9) has admitted murder
enmity between the parties and has
also given details of the same in his
statement recorded before the trial
court. No doubt, previous enmity can
be a reason for the appellant to commit
the alleged crime, but it can equally be
a reason for the complainant side to
falsely implicate the appellant in this

case for previous grouse."

14. The learned counsel representing the complainant

stressed hard and hard that the appellants remained absconder for

-17-

sufficient long time and that they could not explain their willful
absence and that this factor alone is sufficient to prove the guilt of
the accused. We are afraid that the learned counsel went in error as,
there is no cavil to the proposition that abscondence by itself is not
sufficient to prove guilty an accused rather it is a circumstance
which can aid to favor the prosecution if the prosecution succeeds
in proving in case through cogent and confidence inspiring
evidence which is not the case in hand.

In case titled “Muhammad Sadiq Vs. State (2017
SCMR 144), it is held that:

“The fact that the appellant absconded
and was not traceable for considerably
long period of time could also not be
made sole basis for his conviction
when the other evidence of the
prosecution is doubtful as it is riddled
with contradictions.”

15. The basic principle of criminal administration of
justice is that prosecution is under bounden duty to prove its case
beyond any shadow of doubt and if any reasonable doubt arises in
the prosecution case, the benefit of the same must be extended to
the accused not as a grace or concession, but as a matter of right,
the wisdom behind the same is that, lest no innocent be punished. In
view of unbelievable prosecution story, unnatural conduct of
witnesses and their presence, contradiction among the statements of
complainant, doctor and the Investigating Officer, whole edifice of
prosecution case has razed to the ground, which benefits only and

only the appellants. This Court reaches to an inescapable conclusion

-18-

that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case against
accused/appellants, resultantly the instant criminal appeal is
allowed, the impugned judgment of conviction is set aside and the
accused/ appellants are acquitted of the charges. They be released
forthwith if not required to be detained in connection of any other
criminal case. As the appeal against conviction has succeeded, so
the criminal revision No.30-B of 2020 for enhancement of sentence
has lost its utility stands dismissed.
