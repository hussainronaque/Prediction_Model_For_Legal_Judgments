Meaga Coase pL

1 found this case unique & serious in its nature as

the petitioner has challenged the chastity and self-respect
of Holy Prophet Muhammad see; therefore, in the light of

above mentioned “Quran Verse” coupled with reference

from “Hadiths” it is crystal clear that after the Holy
Prophet Muhammad/lyé there will be no one on the
earth who “can” or “will” call himself “oat” OF “vest”;

therefore, the assertions made by the accused/petitioner
is totally unbelievable/incredible and should be dealt with
iron hands, rather he deserve more than that because he
is found guilty of apostasy. /

9. Thus, in view of the above discussion there is no
room left for considering the request/application of
accused/petitioner for the grant of bail. The sections of
law are well imposed which contains major penalties,
therefore accused/petitioner deserves no leniency, hence

in this scenario bail petition in hand is hereby dismissed.
