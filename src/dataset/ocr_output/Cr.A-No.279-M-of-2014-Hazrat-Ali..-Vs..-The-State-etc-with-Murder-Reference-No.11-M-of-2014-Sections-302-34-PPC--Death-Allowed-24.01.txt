QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J-. This single judgment
shall dispose of both the criminal appeal No.279-
M/2014 and murder reference No.11-M/2014, as both
the criminal appeal and murder reference pertain to the

same case vide FIR No.455 dated 13.12.2006 under
sections 302/34 PPC Police Station, Saidu Sharif,
Swat.

2. The aforementioned FIR was registered on
the basis of murasila sent to the Police Station by
scribe of the murasila , Zar Bakht Khan ASI, Police
Station Mingora, who was reportedly busy in the
investigation of a case of Police Station, Mingora,
under sections 324/34 PPC in the casualty of Saidu
Sharif Hospital, where complainant, Muhammad Ali,
reported to him that he alongwith his brothers Anwar
Ali, Rehmat Ali and Suliman son of Rahamdil were
present in the casualty of Saidu Sharif Hospital where
they had brought injured Farhad Ali, Hamayun and
Gohar Ali, when the appellant, Hazrat Ali son of
Jamshed armed with 30 bore pistol, Rahat Ali son of
Hazrat Ali and Jamshed residents of Makanbagh
armed with Kalashnikovs came there to the casualty of
Saidu Sharif Hospital, and Hazrat Ali, the appellant,
opened fire on his brother Anwar Ali with pistol,
causing firearm injuries on different parts of his body,
thereby causing instantaneous death of his brother,
Anwar Ali. The accused made good their escape after

the occurrence. The motive for commission of the
offence was cited as the earlier attempt at their lives by

firing of the accused, Hazrat Ali, Jamshed, Rahat Ali

and Javed in the Continental Plaza, Makanbagh,
causing firearm injuries to Farhad Ali, Hamayun and

Gohar Ali. The occurrence was stated to have been

witnessed by his brother Rehmat Ali and Suliman son

of Rahamdil, Saifullah Khan son of Nadar Khan and

Afsar Ali son of Sher Afzal residents of Aman

Kot/Rahim Abad and other scores of people present on

the spot at the time of occurrence. All the three

aforementioned accused were charged in the FIR by
the complainant.

3. The Post Mortem report of deceased Anwar

Ali (EX.PW4/1) revealed the following;

“A young man with clean shaved wearing black

Shalwar Qamese, tea colour coat, grey colour Jarsy,

black Pajama and black banyan.

1. Entry wound 05 above inf angle at Rt scapula 8mm
in size. This bullet recovered from Lt side 6 above
the Lt iliac crest 1 Lat to spine.

2. Entry wound 1 above the mid clavicle Rt side. Exit

3-1/2 above from Lt iliac crest and 3 Lat to midline.
3. Entry medial side of the Rt knee. Bullet recovered 4
below the pattala.
The lat Edge of the vertebrae at the level of bullet

recovered was fractured.”

The probable time that elapsed between injury and
death, according to the medical officer, was less than
06 hours and between death and Post Mortem one
hour, approximately.

4. The |.0 started investigation with proceeding
to the spot, inspecting the spot and securing blood
from the place assigned to the deceased in the site
plan, and also recovering two empty shells of 30 bore
from point ‘A’ in the site plan, shown close to point-3,
assigned to the appellant. The co-accused, Jamshed,
was arrested on the day of occurrence i.e. 13.12.2006,
whereas the appellant as well as co-accused Rahat Ali
remained at large and were proceeded against under
sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C; and, challan was
submitted against them under section 512 Cr.P.C,
simultaneously, at the time of submission of complete
challan against the arrested accused, Jamshed. The
10 also placed on file a copy of FIR No.2525 dated

13.12.2006 under sections 324/34 PPC Police Station
Mingora, Swat, pertaining to the occurrence which
allegedly took place earlier in the Continental Plaza,
referred to in the instant FIR No.455 of the even date.
The blood secured from the spot through cotton and
blood stained garments of the deceased, handed over
to the |O by the complainant, were sent for chemical
analysis to the FSL, and result there-from was
received in the affirmative. The 1.0 also took into
possession a tube light from outside the X-ray room on
18.12.2006. A phial containing two spent bullets
recovered from the dead body by the Medical Officer
was also taken into possession by the |.0 on
27.12.2006. After collection of the aforesaid evidence
by the 1.0, and completion of investigation, complete
challan was submitted to the trial Court, where
accused Jamshed was formally charged under section
302/34 PPC, leading to commencement of trial and
recording of prosecution evidence; including
statements of the complainant; eyewitness, Saifullah
Khan; Medical Officer who conducted Post Mortem
examination of the deceased; the Investigation Officer

and other formal official witnesses; where-after the
prosecution closed its evidence; and statement of the
accused was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C.

5. Thereafter, the learned trial Court/Additional
Sessions Judge/lIzafi Zilla Qazi-lll, Swat, heard
arguments of learned counsel for both the sides and
learned APP; and acquitted the accused facing trial,
while declaring both the absconding accused i.e. the
appellant and Rahat Ali as proclaimed offenders vide
judgment/order dated 18.06.2011. The order of
acquittal of the co-accused i.e. Jamshed was not
assailed before the appellate forum, therefore, his
acquittal order in the case attained finality.

6. Likewise, the absconding accused, Rahat Ali
son of the appellant, was formally arrested on
20.02.2013, after he secured ad-interim pre-arrest bail.
After submission of challan against him to the trial
Court, and conclusion of trial, he was also acquitted of
the charges by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-
Ill/izafi Zilla Qazi, Swat, vide judgment/order dated
30.01.2013; which was, though, assailed through
appeal before this Court; but the appeal was

dismissed vide judgment/order of this Court dated
23.10.2013. Therefore, his acquittal in the case also
attained finality.

7. The appellant, Hazrat Ali, was formally
arrested in the case on 20.02.2013, after he also
secured ad-interim pre-arrest bail, and challan was
submitted against him, leading to framing of formal
charge under sections 302/34 PPC, to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. During trial, a total
of 11 PWs were examined, including the complainant
(PW-1), the eyewitness Saifullah Khan (PW-9), the |.O
(PW-8) and the medical officer (PW-4), who conducted
post mortem examination, besides other official
witnesses; where-after, the prosecution closed its
evidence; and statement of the appellant/accused was
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he
pleaded innocence, but declined to be examined on
Oath under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C or produce defence
evidence. Thereafter, the learned trial Court/Additional
Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi-ll, Swat, heard
arguments of both the sides and rendered the
impugned judgment/order dated 25.11.2014, whereby,
the appellant/accused was convicted under section

302 (b) PPC and sentenced to the penalty of death as
Tazir for causing the death of Anwar Ali, and also
made him liable to pay compensation under section
544-A Cr.P.C to the tune of Rs: 20,00,000/-(two
million) to the legal heirs of deceased Anwar Ali, with
direction that the compensation shall be recoverable
from him as arrears of land revenue, but owing to want
of property, the appellant/accused shall further suffer
S.| for 06 months; hence the instant appeal.

8. Arguments of learned counsel for the convict-
appellant, and learned AAG assisted by learned
counsel for the complainant heard; and _ record
perused.

9. In the FIR three persons of the same family,
father Jamshed, his son, the appellant Hazrat Ali, and
son of the appellant, Rahat Ali, were charged by the
complainant, Muhammad Ali, for the Qat/-i-amd of his
brother Anwar Ali, in the furtherance of common
intention of all the three accused named in the FIR.
The two co-accused, namely, Jamshed and _ his
grandson Rahat Ali have already been acquitted of the
charges by the learned trial Court vide judgment dated
18.06.2011, in respect of co-accused Jamshed, and

vide judgment dated 30.01.2013 relating to co-accused
Rahat Ali. The judgment of the learned trial Court
dated 30.01.2013 in regard of co-accused Rahat Ali
was assailed by the complainant, but the appeal was
dismissed by this Court in /imine vide judgment/order
dated 23.10.2013. No doubt, the role assigned to the
appellant is a bit different from the two acquitted co-
accused, as the appellant was charged for effective
firing with his pistol and causing the death of deceased
Anwar Ali, while the acquitted two co-accused were
charged for their armed presence on the spot while
sharing common intention of Qatl-i-amd of the
deceased with the appellant; but the fact remains that
the same evidence of the prosecution was disbelieved
with regard to sharing of common intention of all the
three accused, and when there is nothing on the
record to suggest that the murder was premidated, the
same evidence is to be closely scrutinized while
determining effective role of Qafl-i-amd of the
deceased imputed to the appellant.

10. It is an admitted fact that the parties were not
even known to each other before the alleged
commission of offence of attempt at the lives of the

complainant, Muhammad Ali, and his companions,
Farhad Ali, Gohar Ali, Hamayun, Rehmat Ali, Anwar Ali
and Suliman in Continental Plaza, allegedly, by the
appellant, Hazrat Ali, Rahat Ali and Jamshed earlier at
18:30 hours vide FIR No.2525 dated 13.12.2006,
Police Station, Mingora, Swat. Even motive for the
commission of the offence, admittedly, developed in
the Continental Plaza when Chowkidar of the Plaza,
namely, Javed son of Karam Ali stared at the
complainant, and exchange of hot words with him led
to grappling with the complainant, resulting in alleged
firing by the appellant and other two co-accused in the
said case as well as in the instant case. It may not be
out of place that there are some very important and
critical aspect of the case, which are, indeed,
noteworthy for just and proper decision of the case.
Firstly, the motive for commission of both the offence
i.e. attempt at the life of the complainant and others in
the first case and even Qatl-i-amd of deceased Anwar
Ali in the second murder case under section 302 PPC
is the same i.e. staring by Chowkidar of the
Continental Plaza at the complainant, exchange of hot
words between them, their grappling with each other

and attempt at the life of complainant and his
companions by all the same three accused named in
both the FIRs, meaning thereby that there was no
fresh motive for commission of Qaitl-i-amd of brother of
the complainant namely Anwar Ali, because in both the
cases victims as well as accused are the same; and, in
between, no reaction or revenge for the first
occurrence is attributed to the complainant side to
provide a motive to the accused party to enact such a
grave offence of murder, where in the first episode
they had allegedly resorted to firing on the non vital
parts of bodies of the injured-victims. Secondly, the
complainant in both the cases i.e. Muhammad Ali
escaped unhurt in both the cases, although motive in
both the cases is attributed to him. Thirdly, in both the
cases the complainant party fell victim to the alleged
aggression of the three accused, belonging to the
same family, and there is nothing on the record to
indicate any loss suffered by the accused, even in the
first case of attempt at the lives of the complainant and
his companions so as to discern even a remote motive
on the part of the accused to enact the second more
grave offence of Qatl-i-amd of deceased Anwar Ali,

that too, after taking the risk of commission of the
offence in the midst of not only of a sizable number of
police personnel but also staff of the hospital, patients
and other attendants.

11. As state above, the complainant did not
receive a single scratch during the commission of both
the offences, and presence of the other eyewitness
namely Saifullah Khan son of Nadar Khan (PW-9) is
also not proved beyond doubt, as there is nothing on
the record to show as to how he got information about
the first occurrence and how and when he reached the
casualty in order to be present at the time of lodging
report by the complainant to the police about the first
occurrence, and then remained present there during
the second occurrence, resulting in the murder of
Anwar Ali deceased, but also remaining unhurt like the
complainant, despite alleged several fire shots by the
appellant, causing three entry wounds on the body of
the deceased. In any case, he can at best be regarded
as chance witness. It is an admitted fact that the
hospital is a busy place, and not only guarded at
several points by the police, but hospital staff, patients
and attendants of the patients remain present in the

hospital, particularly at the casualty side, round the
clock. There are three gates leading from the main
Saidu Mingora road to the casualty ward, one is the
main gate at the road side, then another gate for
parking etc and a third gate in front of the casualty
ward; but it is strange and beyond imagination that the
appellant and other co-accused armed with
Kalashnikovs were neither noticed at any of the above
stated points nor large number of police officers
witnessed the occurrence despite their presence at the
scene of occurrence at the relevant time. It is, indeed,
unbelievable; and, otherwise, can be regarded serious
lapse on the part of the police to have not made the
security more vigilant after the first occurrence of firing
in the Continental Plaza, causing firearm injuries to the
companions of the complainant, who were, then,
brought to the casualty of Saidu Sharif Hospital. It is
also something beyond comprehension that even if not
noticed at the time of entering the hospital, all the three
accused, astonishingly, escaped notice of everyone
present there in the casualty of the hospital, after
commission of the offence, while carrying their
weapons, including Kalashnikovs by the two co-

accused. The explanation to all these unlikely
situations was furnished by the |.O Mir Abdullah
Inspector (PW-8) who stated that he did not record
statements of other persons present there as they
were not ready to depose falsely in favour of baseless
report of the complainant. There is also another
noticeable contradiction in his statement with regard to
his presence in the casualty of Saidu Sharif Hospital at
the time of occurrence, because he stated in his
statement before the Court that copy of FIR and
murasila were received by him in the casualty of the
hospital and further that he reached casualty of the
hospital after receiving information about the
occurrence in the casualty of Saidu Sharif Hospital
after 07:00 PM, whereas the occurrence reportedly
took place at 19:10 hours i.e. 07:10 PM. The absence
of names of complainant and the other eyewitnesses in
both the inquest and P.M reports would bring their
alleged presence on the spot at the time of occurrence
under serious doubt especially when best available
evidence of police officers, Hospital staff and people
present on the spot at the time of occurrence was

withheld.
12. The Post Mortem report shows all the three
entry wounds on the upper side of the body of the
deceased, while the corresponding exit wounds on the
lower part of the body; thus, according to the Medical
Officer (PW-4), suggesting bullets travelling from the
upper side of the body to the lower part and that entry
wound No.1 was not on hard surface of the body so as
to give rise to the presumption that the bullet might
have change its course after hitting hard surface of the
body. He positively responded to the suggestion that if
both the assailant and victim were in standing
condition, such like wounds could not be caused. The
prosecution case, on the other hand, is that both the
appellant and the deceased were in standing position
at the time of occurrence. Even if argument of the
prosecution to the effect of the deceased falling on his
knees after receiving the first bullet fired by the
appellant is accepted, the location of all the three exit
wounds on the lower part of body of the deceased
would falsify the said presumption.

13. Notwithstanding several explanations
furnished on the part of the prosecution regarding the

presence of sufficient light at the time of occurrence so
as to facilitate identification of the actual culprit, the
fact remains that no source of light was either
mentioned in the FIR or in the site plan, despite the
occurrence having taken place at 07:10 PM in the
month of December, probably at Esha time; and the
belated taking into possession of the tube light by the
1.0 on 18.12.2006, would hardly be of any help to the
case of prosecution, which had initially and all along
been claiming commission of the offence in the
daylight. Having said that promptly lodged FIR and
abscondance of the appellant could hardly overshadow
discrepancies and improvements in the prosecution
case.

14. In the circumstances, stated here-in-above,
there was hardly any incriminating evidence to warrant
conviction of the appellant, and award of capital
punishment to him, rather case of the prosecution was
replete with sufficient doubts and _ contradictions,
warranting acquittal of the appellant.

15. As such, the appeal is accepted, and the
impugned judgment of the learned _ trial
Court/Additional Sessions Judge/lIzafi Zilla Qazi, Swat,

dated 25.11.2014, together with conviction of the
appellant and sentences awarded to him, vide the
impugned judgment, are set aside. Consequently, the
appellant is acquitted of the charges levelled against
him; and be set at liberty, forthwith, if not required in
any other case.

16. The murder’ reference No.11-M/2014,
forwarded by the learned trial Court under section 374

Cr.P.C is, accordingly, answered in the negative.

Announced.
