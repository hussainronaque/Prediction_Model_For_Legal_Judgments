ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J: - Accused-petitioner

Khalid son of Fateh Muhammad, involved in case vide

FIR No. 298 dated 27.04.2017 under section 302/324/34

PPC registered at police station Agha Mirjani Shah

(Yakatoot) Peshawar, has knocked the door of this Court

for his release on bail which was refused to him by

learned Additional Sessions Judge-III Peshawar vide

order dated 18.07.2017.

2. FIR reveals that local police after receiving

information regarding the occurrence rushed to LRH

casualty where injured / complainant namely Tariq

reported the matter to them to the effect that pistol of

accused-petitioner was stolen for which brother of
complainant Tahir was nominated and it was settled that

the amount of pistol would be paid to accused-petitioner.

On the day of occurrence complainant, alongwith

deceased Tahir and Sharif Khan were coming to their

home and when reached to the place of occurrence

accused-petitioner alongwith absconding co-accused Arif

were present there and on seeing the complainant party

started altercation with them and thereafter made firing at

them from their respective weapons, resultantly from the

fire short of accused-petitioner complainant and deceased

Tahir were hit and from the fire short of co-accused Arif,

Sharif was hit and died, hence the present FIR.

3. I have gone through the record with the valuable

assistance of learned counsel for the parities, as well as

that State counsel.

4. Deep appreciation at bail stage is neither

permissible nor advisable, though learned counsel

representing accused-petitioner stressed hard on merits of

the case by producing various judgments of apex Court

as well as of this jurisdiction, but discussing merits of the

case at this stage, would prejudice the case of either side.

Record suggests that accused-petitioner has directly been
nominated in the FIR by the complainant for the murder

of deceased Tahir, Sharif Khan and injuries upon his

person with a motive which has not been denied/negated.

Besides this, the medico legal report i.e Postmortem

reports of both the deceased fully supports the version of

prosecution /complainant coupled with the site plan and

the recoveries in the shape of empty shells, blood stained

etc, which on the face of record substantiates the charge

against the accused-petitioner. Sufficient material is

available on file which could prima facie connects the

accused-petitioner with the commission of offence and

exclude the plea of further inquiry. The grant of bail as of

right under section 497(2) Cr.PC is possible only when a

finding is rendered that there are not reasonable grounds

for believing that the accused has committed the

particular offence. When there is hesitation to record

such a findings, one explanation might be that it is not

possible. It is true that the higher court might discover the

material is sustain such a finding being recorded.

Nevertheless, it would be more advisable, in order to

show that the mind is applied to this aspect, to at least

mention it. Without such a finding the remark that it is a
case of further inquiry is least helpful. Who can deny that

further inquiry is also possible rather necessary in all

those case, where bail is refused because of the

prohibition contained in section 497 (1) Cr.PC. The

relevant context of further inquiry in section 497 (2)

Cr.PC is the existence of reasonable grounds that the

accused has not committed the offence. When a Court is

not conscious is convinced of this aspect, mere further

inquiry is of absolutely no avail to the accused for bail

under section 497 (2).

5. Question of Ballistic Expert qua empty

shells that these were fired from one weapon is

concermed, in this respect it is stated that in the presence

of direct evidence much weight could not be attached to

opinion of Ballistic Expert, because it is well settled that

expert evidence, may be medical or that of a Ballistic

Expert is entirely corroborative in nature and shall not

have bearing on direct or other circumstantial evidence,

as in the instant case, which is definite, forthright and at

the same time creditworthy. Confirmatory evidence is not

of much significance. It cannot, at any rate, outweigh the

direct evidence unless it is for any reasons deficient in
quality. Guidance is derived from 1991 SCMR-60,

titled Ghulam Mehdi versus the State. The offence,

with which the accused-petitioner is charged, squarely

falls within the prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.PC,

thus disentitling the petitioner to the grant of bail.

6. For the reasons recorded hereinabove this

bail petition being bereft of legal substance is hereby

dismissed.

7. Needless to mention here that the assessment made

hereinabove are tentative in nature and shall not prejudice the case

of either side during trial.
