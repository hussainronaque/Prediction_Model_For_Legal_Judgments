REKKKKEKRKRERKRERER

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- This appeal calls in question the
judgment dated 22.06.2022 of the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-III, Kohat, whereby appellant has been convicted under
Section 4 of Elimination of Custom of Ghag Act, 2013 and
sentenced to Seven (7) years rigorous imprisonment and a
fine of Rs. 500,000/- (Five Lac), in default of payment
whereof simple imprisonment for six months. He was also
adjudged guilty under Section 506 PPC and sentenced to
rigorous imprisonment for two (02) years & a fine of Rs.
10,000/- (Ten thousands) or in default thereof to undergo
simple imprisonment for one month. Both the sentences were
ordered to run concurrently. Benefit of Section 382-B Cr. PC

was also extended to the accused.

2. Briefly stated the prosecution case as set up in Crime
No.1056 dated 22.06.2022 registered at Police Station City
Hangu is that the complainant Haneef Khan (PW.7) submitted
an application to the SHO of P.S City Hangu for registration

of FIR against the accused under Section.4 of the Elimination
of Custom of Ghag Act, 2013; as per the contents of
application the Nikah of his sister Mst. Inaz Begum was
solemnized with the respondent/accused on 12.11.2011,
however, later on due to domestic issues, their relations
discontinued. To resolve the dispute Jirgas were constituted,
however, failure of jirgas to settle the matter between the
parties amicably, the dispute was brought before the Family
Judge, Kohat. After a full dressed trial, the matrimonial tie
between appellant and Mst. Inaz Begum was dissolved on the
basis of Khula vide judgment and decree dated 16.11.2016. It
was stated in the application that since then his sister is
residing in the house of the complainant and
accused/appellant has raised objection/voice on second
Nikah/marriage of her sister. It was alleged in the petition that
many people asked the hands of his sister, however, due to his
open declaration that she is still his legally weded wife, the
people refrained from taking her hand in marriage because of
that declaration, and to restrain him from giving hands in
marriage to anyone, he issued threats to him and his family
members. On the basis of the said application, the police
initiated inquiry under Section 157 (1) Cr.PC. The inquiry
was conducted by Sher Zaman ASI (PW2). He proceeded to
the spot, prepared site plan Ex.PB. He also recorded
statement of PWs under Section 161 Cr. PC, and ultimately, it
culminated in registration of ibid FIR. The date and time of
occurrence was neither disclosed in the application nor in the
crime report, however, the crime was reported on 06.08.2019

at 12.00 noon.
3. After registration of the case, the investigation was
entrusted to Nazeer Bad shah ASI (PW-3). He proceeded to
the spot and summoned the complainant. On reaching the
spot, the complainant also came there. He discussed the site
plan Ex. PB with the complainant who relied upon the site
plan, already prepared by the Inquiry Officer. He also
summoned the witnesses to the spot who also relied upon the
statements already recorded by the Inquiry Officer under
Section 161 Cr.PC. On 01.09.2019, he searched for the
accused/appellant in his house, in this respect, he prepared the
search memo, which is Ex.PW3/1. The accused was arrested
by Sher Zaman ASI on 01.09.2021. On return to the P.S, the
card of arrest (Ex.PW2/1) of the accused was handed over to
him. He also issued Parwana for the addition of a section of
the law against the accused, Ex.PW.3/2. On 02.09.2019, he
produced the accused before the Illaqa Magistrate for
obtaining Physical custody of the accused vide application
Ex.PW 3/3, which was refused. He recorded the statement of
accused under Section 161 Cr. PC in the Court Premises,
thereafter, the accused was sent to Judicial Lockup. After
completion of investigation, he handed over the case file to
the SHO, Fazal Muhammad (PW1) for submission of the

complete challan.

4, The accused was put to trial. After compliance of
Provisions of Section 265-C Cr. PC charge was framed on
02.11.2019 to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
In order to prove its case prosecution examined as many as

seven (7) witnesses.
5. Before the trial Court appellant in his statement
recorded under Section 342 Cr. PC has taken the defence that
the parties profess Figa Jafria, and according to him the
decree of the Court is not effective according to his faith.
Appellant has further stated that he is innocent. It was pleaded
by him that procedure for Talaq as provided in Figa Jafria has
not been complied with, therefore, the decree of Khula by
Court is legally not effected. In this respect, he produced copy
of the appeal filed by Mst: Inaz Begum in the Court of
District Judge, Kohat, wherein in the prayer clause, she
clearly stated that direction may be given to respondent that
khula/Tanseekh-e-Nikah may be granted to her according to
Fiqa Jafria through Alim-e-Din. The attested copy of the
appeal, order sheet, judgment and decree sheet were produced
as Ex. D-1 consisting of 15 pages. According to him, the
application submitted to SHO on 01.08.2019, and Talaq
Nama which was produced by the complainant is dated
02.01.2021 meaning thereby that Mst. Inaz Begum was

legally his wife till 02.01.2021, as per his belief.

6. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that both
the parties profess Fiqa Jafria. According to him, no doubt,
vide judgment and decree dated 16.11.2016 marriage between
the appellant and Mst Inaz Begum has been dissolved on the
basis of khula, however, as per his religious belief
matrimonial tie between the parties could only be broken
unless talaq is pronounced, after recitation of sigha in
presence of two witnesses. He further argued that now
matrimonial tie has been broken between the appellant and

Mst. Inaz Begum, as per his religious belief is no more wife
of the appellant. He lastly argued that he posed himself to be
husband of Mst. Inaz Begum under his religious belief,
therefore, his case does not fall within the ambit of Section 4
of the Elimination of Ghag Act, and prayed for outright

acquittal of the accused/appellant.

7. As against that the learned counsel for the
respondent/complainant and learned AAG representing the
State jointly argued that despite a valid decree of the
dissolution of marriage from the Court of competent
jurisdiction, the appellant posed himself to be the husband of
Mst. Inaz Begum, and refrained the people from taking hands
of the sister of the complainant in marriage, therefore, he was
rightly convicted by the learned trial Court and prayed for

dismissal of the appeal.

8. I have heard arguments of the learned counsel for the
parties and have examined the record with their valuable

assistance carefully.

9. The leading facts of the case are the appellant
contracted marriage with Mst. Inaz Begum on 12.11.2011 and
admittedly, the marriage was solemnized according to Shia
law/Figa Jafria, and matrimonial tie between the parties
existed till 02.01.2021, as per appellant’s belief, when
matrimonial tie between the parties was dissolved as per Shia
law/Figa Jafria, on the said date, however, it was contended
by the complainant party that their marriage was dissolved by
way of Khula vide judgment and decree dated 16.11.2016 of
the learned Judge Family Court, Kohat and thereafter, claim

of the appellant that Mst. Inaz Begum (sister of the
wd

complainant), is still his legally weded wife is illegal. I find
from the record that he was put to criminal prosecution on the
allegation that despite dissolution of marriage on the basis of
khula by the court of competent jurisdiction, he posed her to
be his legally weded wife by raising Ghag. The defence plea
of the appellant was that, both the parties profess Figa Jafria
and marriage was also solemnized according to Shia/Figa
Jafria Law, and he was under the bonafide impression that his
marriage could only be dissolved in accordance with Shia
Law, thus claimed her to be his wife, because as per the law
governing their sect it was necessary that the divorce had
been pronounced and recited in Arabic words, reciting the
specific Khutba-e-Talaq in presence of two witnesses as well
as presence of wife is necessary, which was not done,
therefore, dissolution of marriage by way of khula was not in
accordance with Shia Law and he was under the bonafide
and strong belief that Mst. Inaz Begum is still his wife.
However, after following the aforesaid procedure, his
marriage was dissolved on 02.01.2021, where-after, he has
got no concern with Mst. Inaz Begum. In the light thereof, the
real questions for determination before me would be whether
it is the requirement of a valid talaq under the Shia Law/Fiqa
Jafria that it shall have no effect unless it is pronounced
strictly in accordance with Shia Law, in Arabic Words in
presence of two adult male witnesses and the wife, and if
presence of wife cannot be procured then the husband can
pronounce talaq in specific Arabic words, which is known as
Khutba-e-Talaq in presence of two adult male witnesses and

the same can be reduced into writing and forwarded to wife or
it may be intimated to her thrice and whether the appellant
posed himself to be husband of Mst. Inaz Begum as his
legally wedded wife under his religious belief and bonafide
impression. Whether mens rea is lacking in the instant case,
whether the act of the appellant falls within the definition of
Ghag as provided by the Elimination of Custom of Ghag Act,
2013 and whether conviction and sentence of the appellant
under Section 4 of the Elimination of Custom of Ghag Act,

2013 is illegal and not warranted by law.

10 In this case, it would be appropriate to first examine
the requirement of talaq in Figa Jafria/Shia Law. Since it was
vigorously pleaded by the appellant that the law of Fiqa Jafria
relating to talaq has not been followed. Under the Shia /Fiqa

Jafria Law, the following are four conditions of a valid talaq;

i) Presence of the wife.

ii It must be uttered/pronounced orally.

(iii) In the presence and hearing of two male
witnesses who are Muslim and approved

probity and

iv) Recital of sigha of talaq.

11. It is, however, not necessary that nor it has been
provided that anywhere in the text of shia/fiqa jafria that
divorce must be pronounced in presence of “Imam”. The only
mandatory requirement for a valid talaq is that must be orally
pronounced in Arabic in the presence and hearing of two
“Aadil” witnesses. In this context reference may be to the
case reported as Dilshada Masood Vs. G.G Mustafa (AIR
1986 J&K 80). In this behalf reference may also be made to

the following cases/books on the subject: -

In the case reported as Syed Ali Nawaz

Gardezi_v. Lt. -Col. Muhammad Yousuf (P L D
1963 Supreme Court 51), the August Supreme Court
of Pakistan in paragraphs Nos.32 and 37, appearing

at pages 72 and 74, observed as under: -

“The alleged talaq could at best be described as
talaq bidat, which is not recognized as valid by Shia
law (See Baillie's Digest of Muhammadan Law,
Part 11, p.118, Taybjils Muhammadan Law, Third
Edition, Sections 136-142, Mulls's Muhammadan
Law, p.662, Fifteen Edition, Amir Ali's
Muhammadan Law, Fourth Edition, Vol.11,
p.533). These text-books writers, moreover, are
unanimous in stating that according to Shia
doctors, the talaq must be orally pronounced by the
husband, in the presence of two witnesses and the
wife, in a set form of Arabic words. A written
divorce is not recognized, except in certain
circumstances which do not exist in the present
case. The learned trial Judge took the view that
Exh.D.1, even if it was executed by the
complainant, was not effective in law to separate
the two spouses because of these provisions of the
Shia Figh. The Appellate Bench of the High Court
regarded the provisions of the Shia Figh with
regard to the presence of witnesses and the
necessity of an oral pronouncement of divorce, as
merely rules of evidence which could be
disregarded. The law being, however, laid down in
categorical terms, it is open to question whether the
view taken by the Appellate Bench can be
sustained. The learned Judges do not appear to
have adverted to the point that the alleged talaq was
in the heretical form (Talaqul Bidat) which the
Shia dispensation of Islamic Law does not
Sanction."

"Coming next to the important section 7 itself, it
seems to us that the Legislature had attempted to
incorporate the Islamic Law provisions with regard
to the two forms of "Talag-usSunnat", viz., "Talaq
Ahsan" and "Talagq Hasan", as Sar as may be, in
this section. The first of them is that form in which
a single pronouncement of divorce is made during
@ period of menstrual purity, no intercourse having
taken place during that period, and is followed by a
period of Iddat. The second is one in which the first
pronouncement made in similar circumstances is
followed by two further pronouncements in
succeeding period, no intercourse taking place at
any time during the three periods. Such a divorce
becomes irrevocable on the third pronouncement.
Whether the result achieved is in strict conformity
with Islamic Law is a question which does not fall
within the province of this Court to determine by
reason of Articles 5 and 6 of the Constitution. The
section clearly contemplates a machinery of
conciliation whereby a husband wishing to divorce
his wife unilaterally, may be enabled to think better
Of it, if the mediation of others can resolve the
differences between the spouses. The talaq
Pronounced is to be ineffective for a period of 90
days from the date on which notice under
subsection (1) of this section is delivered to the
Chairman and this period is to be utilized for the
attempt at reconciliation. Subsection (6) makes it
clear that even if talaq has become effective under
the previous subsections, the Spouses would not be
prevented from re-marrying, without an
intervening marriage with a third person, unless
such termination is effective for the third time. All
that the section requires is that the marriage in
question should be dissolvable by means of a talaq
and it does not seem necessary to adopt the narrow
construction contended for on behalf of the
respondent, that the wife mentioned in the section
must necessarily be a Pakistani. citizen. To suggest,
as Mr. Mahmud Ali has done, that unless she is
such a citizen she would have no right to appoint
Arbitrator on her behalf, under section 2(a) of the
Ordinance, appears to beg the question. 11

In the case reported as Maryam Bano Vs Hussain Ali
(1984 C L C 1961 Karachi), the case related to a husband and
wife both Muslims belonging to Shia Asna Ashari Sect. Husband
divorced his wife by a divorce deed witnessed by two witnesses,
copy of which was sent to Chairman Union Committee for
confirmation. Reconciliation proceedings having failed divorce

was declared by the Chairman as effective after expiry of 9(-
10

days. The validity of the said divorce was challenged by the wife
by filing a Constitutional Petition, wherein it was observed by a
learned Single Judge that under Shia Law a husband can divorce
his wife by pronouncing Talaq in her presence in Arabic in a
prescribed manner. In this regard reference was made to Arsenals
"Muslim Law as administered in British India" who has
commented as follows:

"Under Shia Law, a Talagq is of no effect unless it

is pronounced,
(L) Strictly in accordance with Sunna.
(2) In Arabic terms.

(3) In the presence of at least two adult male
witnesses."

12. It was thus held by the learned Single Judge that "Talaq
pronounced by respondent No.1 was not valid as it did not comply
with the legal requirements prescribed by Shia Law. If a Shia is
unable to pronounce Talaq in presence of his wife in the
prescribed manner, then it can be pronounced in presence of two
male witnesses and communicated to her in writing. There is
nothing on record to show that the respondent No.1 was incapable
to pronounce divorce in the prescribed form before his wife, or
that Talaq was at all pronounced in the prescribed form and
manner before the witnesses.As Talaq was not validly pronounced
by the respondent No.1 the entire proceedings under section 7 and
the order passed by respondent No.2 are without lawful authority

and without jurisdiction".

13. The case reported as Azharul Hassan Naqvi vs Hamida
Bibi alias Eshrat Jahan (1987 CLC 1041), related to Shia
spouses. The trial Court on basis of evidence led by parties
reaching conclusion that pronouncement of divorce made by

husband on wife did not conform to requirements of Shia law
Gi,

11

inasmuch as it was not heard by two Adil males and, therefore,
lady could not be said to have ceased to be his wife. The finding
of fact was upheld by the Appellate Court. Interference was also

declined by High Court in constitutional jurisdiction.

14, In in this behalf reference may be made to the case

reported as Mst Basra Vs Abdul Hakim and 2 others (PLD

1986 Quetta 298) the wife asserted that her husband pronounced
Talaq three times at her parents’ residence. Family Court, for
cogent reasons, disbelieved wife's witnesses and highlighted
material discrepancies in their statements in its judgment which
was concurred by the Appellate Court. Finding of Family Courts
that Talaq was not proved was maintained, in the circumstances
by a Division Bench of the High Court of Baluchistan as it was
not found based on misreading of evidence or contrary to

evidence on record.

15. The case reported as Naheed Fatima Vs Amir Azam
Rizvi (PLD 1987 Kar. 670) pertains to Shia spouses. It was held
by a learned Single Judge of this Court that the Talaq must be
pronounced by husband orally and in presence of two competent
witnesses. The divorce communicated in writing was not valid
under Shia law unless husband was physically incapable of
pronouncing it orally. However, the learned Court dismissed the
petition on the ground that there was laches of six years in

invoking constitutional jurisdiction by the wife.

In this behalf reference may also be made to Baillie's

Digest of Mohammadan Law, pp.113-117, it states that: -

"Repudiation cannot be effected by writing, nor in
any other language than the Arabic when there is
ability to pronounce the words specially appointed,
nor by signs except where the party is unable to
speak. If he is dumb, repudiation may be effected
by any signs sufficiently indicative of his purpose.
12

And, though it cannot be given in writing by one
who is present and able to pronounce the proper
words, yet if he is unable to do so and writes them
fully intending repudiation, it takes effect and is
quite valid."

"The fourth pillar of repudiation is Testimony;
and it is necessary that two witnesses should be
present and hear the repudiation given, whether
they are called upon to attest it or not. It is a
condition essential to the validity of a Talag that the
witnesses should hear the actual words. So, that if
they are merely present, repudiation does not take
effect, though all other conditions are complied
with."

16. In Mulla's Mahomedan Law, Baillie has been quoted as
above, for Shia Law and it states that "A divorce must be
pronounced orally in the presence of competent witnesses and a
Talaq communicated in writing is not valid unless husband is

incapable of pronouncing it orally.

Ameer Ali in his book on Mohammedan Law, Vol. 1,

page 444, writes that: -

"Under the Shia Law, it is further
necessary that there should be two reliable
witnesses present at the time of repudiation to hear
the words in which it is pronounced, or in the case
of a dumb individual, to see the writing or the signs
in which it is expressed. Not only must the
witnesses be present atthe time, but they should
understand the nature of the act and hear the
distinct wording of the repudiation. If they be
unable to testify to the exact character of the Talaq,
or the words or signs used, it is invalid, although all
other conditions may have been duly complied with.

It is a further condition under the Shiah doctrines
that the witnesses should be present together. The
Shia Law is so strict in the matter of repudiation
and throws so many obstacles in the way of a
dissolution of marriage by this process, that it
declares that, if one of the witnesses should be
present at one stage and the other at another stage
of the proceeding, the Talaq would not be valid.
When they testify to the acknowledgment by the
wife of a repudiation, it is not necessary that their
testimony should be concordant, or relate to one
and the same time, or ‘be given together’. Yet says
the Shara’a, 'if one should testify to the fact of
repudiation and 801 the other to the
Acknowledgment of it, their testimony would 1094
not be admissible’.
13

When a Talaq is pronounced in the
presence of witnesses, it takes effect only when the
appropriate words are employed. Ifa husband were
to repudiate his wife first without witnesses and

then in their presence, the former proceeding
would count for nothing. The dissolution
would come into effect only from the date of the
second Talag if valid. 11

In Al-Sharia, Vol.11 by S.C. Sir car, pp.399-400, it

is stated that:

"Divorce cannot be effected in writing nor in any
other language than the Arabic, when there is
ability to pronounce the (Arabic) words especially
appointed, nor by signs except where the party is
unable to speak. So, -

If the husband is dumb, divorce may be
effected by any signs indicative of his purpose.

Though divorce cannot be given in writing by one
who is present and able to pronounce (the proper
words), yet, being unable to speak, if he (the
divorcer) writes them, thereby intending divorce, it
is valid and effective.

Some Doctors are of opinion that divorce
takes place by writing if the husband were absent
from his wife, but this opinion is not to be relied

upon.

K.N. Ahmed in his book, Muslim Law of
Divorce, referring to Wasilat al-Najat, Abul Hasan
al-Mustafa, Najaf, 1364 A.H., p-370, at page 33

writes as under: -

"Presence of two trustworthy male witnesses at the
time of divorce is an essential condition under the
Shia Law. They should be present together at that
time. A Full Bench of the Lahore High Court has
expressed the view that ‘the rule regarding the
presence of two witnesses is a rule of evidence
which stands replaced by the Evidence Act. The
Supreme Court of Pakistan did not approve of the
view and stated in its judgment that 'the law,
however, being laid down in categorical terms, it is
open to question whether the view taken by the
Appellate Bench can be sustained. It may be noted
that the view expressed by the High Court requires
reconsideration, The rule regarding presence of
witnesses is certainly not a rule of evidence, but
oh

14

belongs to the substantive Shia Law of divorce and
is an essential part of the same. Under the Shia
Law, a divorce pronounced in the absence of
witnesses shall be invalid. It is stated in Shari’ah
al-Islam that the hearing of the pronouncement of
divorce is an essential condition for the validity of
the divorce. The Shia Law is so strict in the matter
that it has laid down that in the absence of
witnesses no divorce shall be effected even if all the -
other conditions are satisfied, nor shall a divorce be
effected if only one witness be present or the two
witnesses ‘present are not just and reliable. The
Shia jurists rely on their interpretation of the verse
of Surah al-Talaq (LXV: 2) which enjoins the
presence (of two witnesses at the time of divorce.
Thus, the Shia law is more strict in the matter of
divorce than the Sunni Law.

Saksena in his book on Muslim Law, p.113,
states that:

"Under the Shia law, talaq in writing or by signs is
not allowed, unless the husband is unable to
pronounce the formula of divorce and unless the
document is written or the signs made with the
intention of Talaq and in the presence of two male
witnesses.”

It has been further stated that:

"The Shias insist on the presence of two Muslim
witnesses of approved probity at the
pronouncement, which must be in proper form and
in Arabic terms, if possible, and there must be
intention to dissolve the union."

In Jamilal-Jafri, Vol. 11, page 9. Lahore,

(Urdu translation) it is stated as under: -

In "A Code of Muslim Personal Law,"
Volume I written by His lordship Mr. Justice Tanzil-
ur-Rehman, learned counsel relied on at page 338
which is as under:

"Shi’ah Law prescribes a particular formula for
the pronouncement of divorce. If that is not
employed, divorce would be ineffective. Thus,
according to Shi’ah Doctors, the Talaq must be
orally pronounced by the husband, in the presence
of two witnesses and the wife in a set form of
Arabic words except where it is established that the
husband is incapable of pronouncing the talaq in
the manner mentioned above. PLD 1963 SC 51;
1963() PSCR 356; 15 DLR (SC) 9). It will be
noticed that it is not with regard to proof of divorce
that the Shilah law insists on two witnesses but to
the very act of divorce and, therefore, the matter
does not relate to proof only. It is a part of
substantive law PLD 1962 (W.P.) Lah. 558; PLD
1965 Kar.185.
15

17. For the discussion made hereinabove, I am of the
considered opinion that the appellant was under firm belief that
divorce has not taken place between the spouses, unless, procedure
of talaq as provided under Shia law/Figa Jafria was followed, and
under this belief, as pleaded by him, he posed himself to be
husband of Mst Inaz Begum and refrained the people from taking
her hand in marriage.

18. Turning to other points, it is reflected from the record that,
the prosecution before the learned trial Court heavily placed
reliance upon the evidence of PW.3 (1.0). PW. 4 Mst. Inaz Begum
and PW. 7, complainant/Muhammad Haneef, brother of Mst. Inaz
Begum. During cross-examination, PW-3 admitted that during
inquiry proceedings, Fatwa from Moulana Sabeel Hussain Mazahri
was produced, which is available on the file and according to Figa

Jafria Talaq/Khula is not completed unless and until,

Ont Cutt Sw G ee L os ee LY Sw

19. PW.4 and PW.7 admitted that the parties belong to Figa
Jafria and procedure for Talaq/Khula, provided in the Figa Jafria as
discussed in the preceding para was not adopted. It seems that for
this very reason, Mst Inaz Begum P.W.4, in Para No.5 and 8 of the
memo of her appeal stated as below: -

20. This clearly demonstrates that she herself had not accepted
the decree of Khula/dissolution of marriage due to non-adoption of
procedure of Talaq as provided under Shia Law/Figa Jafria. It is
also worth mentioning that Haneef Khan (Complainant) PW.7, on
20.03.2021, got recorded his statement and stated that he does not
want to prosecute the accused and has got no objection, if he is
acquitted of the charges.

21. It is by now settled that in every criminal act (crime) has
three stages, the first one is mens rea, the second stage is
preparation and the third stage is the decisive step taken thereto i.e,
completion of the criminal act, but above all intention/mens rea is
the most essential part of a crime, therefore in every crime it is a
matter of high importance that the intent and act must concur to
constitute an offence. True that an intention may be inferred from
the act of the accused person, but the manifestation must provide
clear link therewith. There is no evidence on record whatsoever, to
disclose that the appellant posed himself to be husband of Mst Inaz
Begum with malafide intentions rather he was under belief that
talaq has not taken place between the parties as as per shia
law/Figah Jafria, till proper procedure was followed on 02.01.2021.
It is the golden principle of criminal jurisprudence that an accused
cannot be held guilty for a crime on the basis of probabilities,
presumption, conjectures and summaries and that no one shall be
construed into crime without concrete legal proof. In this context,
reliance can well be placed on the judgments reported as State vs

M._Idrees Ghauri (2008 SCMR 1118) and_Federation of

Pakistan Vs Hazoor Bukhsh and 2 others (PLD 1983 FSC 255).

22. ‘In my view, the defence plea of the appellant is more
plausible and convincing and he while acting in good faith claimed
himself to be husband of Mst Inaz Begum till matrimonial tie
between the parties was dissolved in accordance with Shia
Law/Figa Jafria on 02.01.2021, is based on truth and that his act
does not fall within the ambit of Section 4 of the Elimination of
Ghag Act, 2013 and his conviction, and sentence under the said
section of law is factually and legally not maintainable being not
based on proper appreciation of evidence on record.
23. So far as conviction and sentence recorded under Section
506 PPC is concerned, the same was also bad for want of proof.
24. In consequence to what has been discussed hereinabove, the
conviction and sentence awarded to the appellant vide impugned
judgment dated 22.06.2022, is set aside and he is acquitted of the
charges levelled against him with a result this appeal is allowed. He
be set at liberty forthwith if not required to be detained in any other
case.

These are detailed reasons of my short order of even date.
