                     -----------------
                     ORDER
 
SHAHNAWAZ
TARIQ,J:- Through captioned post arrest bail application,
applicants Sajid alias Sajjan and  Muhammad Usman alias Dado have impugned
order dated 28.08.2014, passed by the Court of learned Ist Additional Sessions
Judge, Khairpur, whereby their earlier bail application was declined.
2.     Necessary
facts pertaining to instant case are that complainant Hidayatullah lodged F.I.R.
that accused Muhammad Usman alongwith one unidentified culprit attempted to
snatch his motorcycle from him, but culprits fled away towards katcha path,
however in the meantime police mobile reached there and they all chased
culprits on foot. Complainant informed his co-villagers through cell-phone and
they duly armed also accompanied with complainant party. Subsequently, accused
Sajid, Sabir and Sadiq duly armed came there and accused persons rushed towards
the village of complainant and made firing upon the police party and during
encounter Sabir and Sadiq were murdered on the spot, whereas Muhammad Usman was
apprehended in the injured condition but accused  Sajid succeeded to flee away,
hence instant FIR.
3.     Learned
counsel for the applicants contended that  applicants are innocent and have
been falsely implicated in the instant case by complainant as applicants were
called by complainant party for a Faisla and during said proceedings,
complainant party committed murder of both the deceased and caused injuries to
applicant Muhammad Usman; that police has not lodged FIR regarding alleged
encounter held between the culprits and police, but complainant being a private
person in his personal capacity, has lodged instant FIR; that complainant
examined each and every injury of both the deceased and injured and also
checked all the weapons recovered from the spot which were smelling; that FIR
has been lodged in shape of memo of inspection of dead-bodies and inspection of
wardat, which was not mandate of complainant; that applicant Usman was arrested
on 07.08.2014, while applicant Sajid was apprehended on 17.08.2014, and since
then they are behind the bars, but prosecution has failed to examine a single
witness to prove its case before learned trial Court; that during alleged
encounter none from police party sustained injury nor any damage was caused to
police mobiles, hence the offence under Section 324, PPC is not made out from
the contents of FIR, whereas offence under Section 393 PPC is punishable upto
07 years and offence under Section 353, PPC is bailable and punishable upto 02
years; that both applicants are not previously convicted. Learned counsel has relied
on 2014 MLD 414, 2014 MLD 11 and 2014 P.Cr.L.J 1106.
4.     While
controverting above submissions, learned APG contended that applicant Usman was
apprehended on the spot in injured condition after the encounter held between
the culprits and police, in which two culprits were murdered at the spot.
Learned APG candidly submitted that applicant Sajid was neither present at the
spot when co-accused had attempted to snatch motorcycle from complainant nor
was arrested on the spot after encounter.
5.     Learned
counsel for complainant also supported the arguments advanced by learned APG
and contended that both the applicants are dangerous criminals and involved in
many cases but they are absconding from their cases; however no detail of such
cases, has been placed before this Court in support of his contentions.   
6.     Perusal
of material available on record and consideration of arguments advanced by the
parties emanate that admittedly accused Sajid was not apprehended by the police
at the spot after alleged encounter and even he had not participated in the
alleged offence for attempt to snatch the motorcycle from complainant,
therefore, his involvement requires serious consideration.
7.     Indeed,
during the alleged encounter neither any police person sustained any bullet
injury nor any scratch was caused to police mobile, as such there remains a
case of ineffective firing against present applicants, hence the offence
punishable under Section 324, PPC requires further inquiry and it is for
learned trial Court to thresh out the truth at trial after recording evidence
of P.Ws, while offence under Section 393 PPC is punishable upto 07 years and it
is well settled that while considering the question of bail, the Court has to
consider the minimum aspect of the sentence provided for the offence in the
schedule. Conversely, during the alleged encounter Sabir and Sadiq were killed,
and applicant Muhammad Usman was arrested in injured condition and one un-licensed
empty TT pistol was not recovered from his specific possession but same was recovered
from the place of wardat near from him.
8.     Furthermore,
applicants are behind the bars for the period more than 14 months but
prosecution has failed to examine a single witness to substantiate the charge
against applicants. After conclusion of investigation, Challan has also been
submitted before the trial Court, hence they are no more required further and further
detention of applicants will not serve any useful purpose. Moreover, there is
no apprehension of tampering with prosecution evidence as main witnesses are
police officials, and even no one can be detained for an indefinite period.
9.     Considering
the above circumstances, I am of the considered view that applicants have
succeeded to make out a case for grant of bail on the ground of further enquiry
as envisaged under Section 497(2), Cr.P.C. Consequently, applicants are admitted
to post arrest bail subject to their furnishing solvent surety in the sum of
Rs.100,000/- each and P.R. Bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of
learned trial Court.
10.   The observations made above are tentative in nature and
learned trial Court shall decide the case strictly on merits.
