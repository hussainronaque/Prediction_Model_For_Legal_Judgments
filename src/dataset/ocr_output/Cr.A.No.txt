8. The main question before this court is that

what would be proper sentence of self defence and
-9-

also whether in the circumstances of the present
case accused has succeeded his right of self
defence or not.

9. Adverting to the question that would be proper
sentence, it is upto courts to consider on case to
case basis as to which of the three clauses under
section 302 PPC is applicable in view of the
circumstances forming background of the offence.
The question herein arose before apex Court in case
titled The State Vs Muhammad Hanif and 05 others
reported as 1992 SCMR 2047, the question so
devised for resolution was as under:-

“Whether the requirement of section
302 (c) PPC has to be proved by the
prosecution as a_ requirement of
substantive law or has to be proved by
the accused as an exception?”

The apex court while making
discussion in the context of the above
question observed that:-

The exact words of section 302 PPC
make it clear that there is no exception
provided therein. What is provided as
substantive law and the prosecution
has to prove every part of it i.e.
whether it is a gatl i amd liable to qisas,
whether it is qatl i amd not liable to be
qisas, or whether it is qatl | amd liable
to tazir...... Muhammad Hanif has
taken a plea of grave and sudden
provocation which is not available to
him now as section 300 PPC has been
substituted by a new section 300 PPC
and the exceptions contained in the old
section have been deleted. The
definition of qatl i amd has been given
in the new section 300 PPC. Any how
it serves as the mitigating
circumstance in favour of Muhammad
Hanif. Another fact that he taken
revenge of the murder of his brother
-10-

Khursheed is also an_ extenuating
circumstance which goes in his favour.
| find Muhammad Hanif guilty under
section 302 (c) PPC and award him ten
years rigorous imprisonment.
Muhammad Hanif accused is also
directed to pay Rs.25,000/- as arsh to
the heirs of the deceased, in default of
the payment of the said amount, he
shall further undergo __ rigorous
imprisonment for two years.”

The apex Court while deciding another titled
Ali Muhammad vs Ali Muhammad and other PLD
1996 Supreme Court 274 and held that the
exception available under the repealed chapter are
now to be dealt with under section 302 (c) PPC. The
relevant para of the judgment is replicated for
convenience:-

“But keeping in view the majority view
in Gul Hassan case PLD 1989
Supreme Court 633, there should be
not doubt that the cases covered by
the excpetions to the old section 300
PPC read with old section 304 thereof,
are cases which were intended to be
dealt with under clause c of the new
section 302 of the PPC.”

In another case tilted Azmatullah vs the State
reported as 2014 SCMR 1178, the apex court
discussed the exception to the erstwhile section 300
PPC and observed as under:-

“Leave to appeal had been granted in
this case to consider as to whether the
circumstances of this case attract the
provision of section 302 (b) PPC or of
section 302 (c) PPC. A bare perusal of
the FIR, the statement made by the
eyewitnesses before the learned trial
court and finding recorded by the
learned courts below clearly show that
-ll-

there was no background of any ill will
or bitterness between the appellant
and his deceased brother that the
incident in issue had erupted all of a
sudden without any premeditation
whatsoever. The medical evidence
shows that the deceased had received
on blow of a churry on his chest
whereas another blow was received by
him on the out aspect of his left upper
arm. The doctor conducting the
postmortem of the dead body had
categorically observed that both the
injuries found on the dead body of the
deceased could be a result of one blow
of churry. These factors of the case
squarely attract exception 4 contained
in the erstwhile provisions of section
300 PPC. It has already been held by
this court in the case of Ali Muhammad
vs Ali Muhammad and another PLD
1996 Supreme Court 274 that the
cases falling in the exception contained
in the erstwhile provisions of section
300 PPC now attract the provision
section 302 (c) PPC.”

10. The appellant has taken specific plea of self
defence and even otherwise if accused has not
taken plea of self defence in his statement recorded
under section 342 Cr.P.C but if the circumstances of
the case and the evidence so produced reflect that
the accused acted in self defence the benefit can be
extended to him. In this regard reliance is placed on
the case tilted Ghulam Farid vs The State reported
as 2009 SCMR 929, wherein it has been held that:-

“The appellant did not raise this plea

during trial either in his statement

under section 342 Cr.P.C or at the time

when the prosecution witnesses were

subjected to cross examination. There

is no bar to raise such plea despite

having not taken the said plea
specifically during trial and the court
-12-

can infer the same from the evidence

led during trial if the same is tenable.

However, to justify such an inference in

favour of the accused who stands

convicted on a murder charge and

sentenced to death, his conduct during

the occurrence should fall within the

parameters of right of private defence

as codified in the Pakistan Penal

Code.”
11. Though the appellant acted in his defence but
has exceeded that what was required for his
defence. The accused should have warned the
deceased through aerial shot instead of directly firing
upon the deceased. No doubt the accused has not
repeated and only one fire shot has been made
which hit the deceased on his right thigh. It is also
admitted that accused has divorced his wife and
having no male issue and only two daughters with
whom he was residing in his house. Complainant as
well as the eyewitness PW-11 during course of cross
examination admitted to be correct that there was no
previous enmity between them meaning thereby that
if the deceased had not entered in the house of
accused no offence would have taken place. The
record depicts that deceased has himself committed
illegal tress pass in the house of accused. Appellant
was living with his two daughters and the illegal tress
pass of the deceased annoyed the

accused/appellant and thus resulted in the present

occurrence. Moreover, the fire was made at the non-
-13-

vital part of the deceased and after making firing
from shotgun the accused has got three more live
cartridges but he did not make any fire on the vital
part of the deceased though the deceased was at
the mercy of the accused for sufficient time. All the
facts lead this court to the conclusion that the
accused/appellant has exercised his right of self
defence, therefore, in our view the sentence of
fourteen years is excessive and sentence of 10
years will meet ends of justice in the circumstances
of the case.

12. For what has been discussed above, this
appeal is partially allowed and the impugned
judgment of the learned trial court is modified to
extent of ten years instead of fourteen years while

rest of the judgment of the learned trial court is

maintained.
Announced.
