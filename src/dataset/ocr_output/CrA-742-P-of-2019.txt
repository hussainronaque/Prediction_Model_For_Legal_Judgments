JUDGMENT

LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- This criminal
appeal is directed against the judgment
dated 28.05.2019 delivered in case FIR
No.355 dated 26.02.2018 u/s 9 (c) of the
Control of Narcotics Substances Act, 1997
of Police Station Faqir Abad, Peshawar,
whereby each of the appellant has been
convicted and sentenced to 14 years RI and
fine of Rs.50,000/- each or in default
whereof to further suffer six months SI each

with benefit u/s 382-B Cr.P.C.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on
26.02.2018 Noor Haider Khan SHO (PW-3)
was on routine gusht alongwith other police
contingent when he_ received a_ spy
information regarding the smuggling of chars
from FATA to Punjab. In order to foil the bid,

he arranged a Nakabandi on the spot. In the
meanwhile, a motorcar bearing
No.RIW/5841 arrived there, which was
stopped. The driver disclosed his name as
Javed while the front seater turned out to be
Fazal Noor and the rear seater as Yaseen.
From personal possession of the above
persons, 3 pistols of 30 bore alongwith live
rounds were recovered. Besides, on search
of the vehicle, 10 packets of chars
concealed in its secret cavities too were
taken out. On the strength of ibid recoveries,
case FIR was registered against them. On
completion of investigation, case was put in
court, which indicted the accused to which
they pleaded not guilty. In order to prove its
case, prosecution examined 7 witnesses,
whereafter statements of the accused were
recorded. On conclusion of the trial, the
learned trial court, found them guilty u/s 9 (c)
of the Control of Narcotics Substances Act,
1997 and sentenced them as mentioned

above.

3. Arguments heard and record gone

through.

4. Pronounced aspect of the case is that

the murasila Ex.PA/1 was drafted by PW-3
and then handed over it to one Riwayat
Khan for its taking to the Police Station so
that formal FIR be lodged but said Riwayat
Khan has not been produced by the
prosecution as its witness. So the very chain
of the occurrence starting from the spot has
not been established, which was must. It
also reveals from cross-examination of
PW-4 that the murasila Ex.PA/1, recovery
memo Ex.PW3/1 and card of arrest
Ex.PW3/2 were also handed over to said
Riwayat Khan by complainant of the case
(PW-3). In such like circumstances,
production of Riwayat Khan as prosecution
witness was necessary. His non-
examination has caused serious cracks in
the prosecution case benefit of which must

go to the appellants.

5. The prosecution has also not
produced extract from the relevant Register,
which is kept at Police Malkhana for entering
therein the recovered and sent contraband.
Production of extract from the ibid Register
was material so that it could be ascertained

that the prosecution version regarding safe
custody of the case contraband was

corroborated by the relevant record.

6. Another important aspect of the case
is that the samples and rest of the parcels
have thereon the monogram of SK but there
is no evidence on the case file to show that
on whose name monogram SK was and
whether any official by the name of SK was
ever posted in the Police Station
Faqir Abad or not. Ibid aspect of the case

also has damaged the prosecution case.

7. Further noticeable aspect of the case
is that neither the recovery has been
effected from personal possession of the
appellants nor same was taken out of the
vehicle on their pointation, which aspect of
the case also caused dents in the

prosecution case as to its accuracy.

8. Thorough and careful examination of
the entire case record would show that the
prosecution has not proved its case against
the appellants beyond any reasonable
doubt, which is hallmark of criminal law for
which the impugned judgment cannot be

sustained.
9. For what has been discussed above,
this appeal is allowed, convictions and
sentences of the appellants are set aside.
They are acquitted of the charges levelled
against them. They be set at liberty

forthwith, if not required in any other case.

10. Above are the detailed reasons of our
short order of even date, which is as

follows:-

“For the reasons to be recorded later, this
appeal is allowed. The convictions &
sentences of the appellants, namely, (1)
Javed s/o Zahir Shah (2) Fazal Noor s/o Fida
Muhammad (3) Yaseen s/o Hazbullah,
recorded by the learned Sessions Judge,
Peshawar vide impugned judgment dated
28.05.2019 in case FIR No.355 dated
26.02.2018 registered at Police Station Faqir
Abad Peshawar are set aside and they are
acquitted of the charges levelled against
them. They be released forthwith, if not

required in any other case”.
