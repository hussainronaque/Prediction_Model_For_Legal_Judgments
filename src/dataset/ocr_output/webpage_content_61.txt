                                      -----------------------

 
 
 
MUHAMMAD IQBAL
MAHAR, J:   This bail application is directed against the order
dated 6.4.2009 passed by learned Vth Court of Additional Sessions Judge,
Karachi-South, in Crime No.80 of 2009 for the offence under Section 365-B PPC
registered at PS Baloch colony, Karachi.
 
          Precisely,
the prosecution story is that on 20.2.2009 the sister of complainant, namely,
Mst. Shamim Akhter aged about 13/14 years had disappeared to whom he and his
family members were searching her subsequently came to know that applicant/accused
Muhammad Akhter had abducted her. The complainant went to police station where
he registered the FIR on 24.2.2009 at 0135 hours.
 
          The
learned counsel for applicant/accused contends that the complainant is not an
eye-witness of the incident and nor any eye-witness has been cited by him in
his FIR, the FIR is delayed by four days. He further contends that the abductee
has contracted marriage with one Irfan Shadeed and he has placed on record an
affidavit of Mst. Shamim Akhter sworn before Assistant Commissioner, Sudhnoti,
Azad Kashmir, in which she has stated that she has not been abducted by any
person but she has contracted marriage with her own accord with Irfan Shadeed.
The learned counsel has also filed a copy of Nikanama, therefore he contends
that there are two versions and the applicant is entitled for the concession of
bail. In support of his contention he has relied upon the cases of AMIR HAYAT
VS. THE STATE (1999 P.Cr.L.J. 1529), BABER RAHMAN VS. THE STATE (2009 P.Cr.L.J.
75) and SUHAIL VS. THE STATE AND ANOTHER (2009 P.Cr.L.J. 312).
 
          The
learned counsel appearing for the State concede to the grant of bail and
contend that the abductee is sui juris and she has contracted marriage with her
own free-will. 
 
          On the
other hand learned counsel appearing for the complainant vehemently opposed the
bail application and supported the impugned order. In support of his contention
he has relied upon the cases of MUHAMMAD AKBAR VS. THE STATE (1987 MLD 3125)
and SHAH FEROZ RIND VS. THE STATE (2009 P.Cr.L.J. 409).
 
          I have
heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the material
and case law cited by the learned counsel for the parties.
 
          A
perusal of case papers shows that the incident is unwitnessed one as none has
seen the abduction of Mst. Shamim Akhter. In this case the star witness is Mst.
Shamim Akhter who has not only furnished her affidavit before Assistant
Commissioner, Sudhnoti, Azad Kashmir, but today the I.O. has also submitted
copy of 164 Cr.P.C. statement of abductee recorded by First Class Magistrate of
Mang, Azad Kashmir, in which she has denied her abduction by any person and has
stated that she has contracted marriage with her own free-will with Irfan
Shaheed and the case is falsely registered by her brother. The facts of case
law relied upon by the learned counsel for complainant are distinguishable to
the present case. In view of two statements of abductee I am of the considered
view that the case is one of further enquiry, therefore I allow this
application and grant bail to the applicant/accused subject to his furnishing
solvent surety in the sum of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees one lac) with P.R. bond in
the like amount to the satisfaction of learned trial Court.
 
          These are the reasons of short order passed on
27.5.2009.
