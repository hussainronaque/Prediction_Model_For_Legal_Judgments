JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, J:- At a trial held by learned
Trial Court/Additional Sessions Judge-II, Kohat, accused
Rehmat alias Kaku, having been found guilty of
committing the ‘Qatl-e-Amd’ of Naushad Khan deceased
and attempting at the life of Irshad Khan complainant
(PW.10), vide judgment dated 18.06.2015, has been
convicted and sentenced as under:-

Under section 302 (b) PPC:- Death as Ta’azir to
be hanged by the neck till declare dead and to pay

Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation in terms of section
544-A Cr.P.C. to the LRs of the deceased and in
default thereof to undergo 06 months SI. further.

Under section 324 PPC:- To undergo 05 years
imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/- or
default thereof to undergo 06 months SI. further.

Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. has been
extended to him.

2. By way of this appeal, Naushad alias Kaku, the
convict, has questioned his conviction and sentences, while
learned Trial Court has sent Murder Reference No.10 of

2015, in terms of section 374 Cr.P.C, for confirmation of

death sentence of the convict. Since, both the matters arise
out from one and the same judgment of the learned Trial
Court dated 18.6.2015, hence, we, propose to decide the
same through this common judgment.

3. The prosecution case, as unfolded in First
Information Report Exh.PA, is that on 16.06.2012 at 08.00
hours, complainant Irshad Khan (PW.10), in company of
dead body of his brother Naushad Khan deceased, reported
to Ashiq Hussain ASI (PW.5), in emergency Unit of
Divisional Headquarter Hospital (DHQ) KDA, Kohat, that
on the fateful day he along with the deceased was busy in
construction work in their house, situated near Parade
ground Madina Masjid Mohallah Charbagh Jungle Khel,
when at 06.20 hours, appellant Rehmat alias Kaku, duly
armed with firearm, came there and opened fire at them, as
a result, the deceased got hit and ran towards the nearby
house of Dilbar Khan for taking shelter, but was chased by
the appellant and no sooner he entered the house of Dilbar
Khan, the appellant once again opened fire at him,
consequent whereupon, he got hit and fell on the ground.
After commission of the offence, the appellant decamped
from the crime scene. The deceased then injured was being
shifted to the hospital by the complainant, but succumbed
to the injuries on the way. Motive behind the crime is that
the deceased had cordial relations with the
opponent/enemy of the appellant, on which the appellant

was annoyed. In addition to the complainant, the incident
is stated to have been witnessed by PW Abdullah (now
dead).

4. Ashiq Hussain ASI (PW.5) recorded the report of
complainant in the shape of Murasila Exh.PW.5/1 which
was verified by Abdullah (PW.4). He sent the Murasila to
Police Station through Constable Maqsood No.1392, on
the basis of which, FIR (Exh.PA) bearing No.461 dated
16.06.2012 under sections 302/324 PPC, was registered
against the appellant in Police Station Jungle Khel, Kohat.
He also prepared injuries statement and inquest report of
the deceased and shifted his dead body to the Mortuary for
autopsy under the escort of Constable Ibrahim No.3369.

5. Dr. Younas Nadim Medical Officer, DHQ Hospital
KDA, Kohat conducted postmortem examination on the
dead body of the deceased on 16.06.2012 at 07.20 a.m.,
and observed the following injuries on his person, vide PM

6. Munawar Khan SJ. (PW.9) conducted
investigation in the case. He proceeded to the spot and
prepared site plan Exh.PB on the pointation of complainant
as well as obtained the snapshots of the crime scene
Exh.PW.9/1 to Exh.PW.9/3. During spot inspection, he
secured blood Exh.P.3 though cotton from the place
allotted to the deceased, 03 empties of 7.62 bore Exh.P.4
from point No.4, and 12 empties of the same bore Exh.P.5

from Point 4A (the places allotted to the appellant in the
site plan), vide recovery memo Exh.PW.4/1. He took into
possession the last worn bloodstained garments of the
deceased Exh.P.1 and P.2, vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.1/1, having cut marks, sent by the doctor from the
hospital through constable Ibrahim. As the appellant was
avoiding his lawful arrest, therefore, he initiated
proceedings under sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. against him
vide applications Exh.PW.9/5 and Exh.PW.9/6. He sent the
bloodstained articles to the FSL, report whereof is Exh.PZ,
recorded statements of the PWs under section 161 Cr.P.C.
and on completion of investigation, handed over the case
file to SHO, who submitted challan against the appellant in
terms of section 512 Cr.P.C. before the learned Trial
Court, where after recording evidence of the prosecution,
the appellant was declared as Proclaimed Offender and
perpetual warrant of arrest was issued against him.

7. Appellant was arrested by police of District Swabi
in another criminal case, so Sadda Khan ASI (PW.8), after
compliance of the requisite legal formalities, proceeded to
District Swabi and arrested the appellant on 18.09.2013,
shifted him to District Kohat, obtained his three days
physical custody, interrogated him and recorded his
statement under section 161 Cr.P.C. After completion of
necessary investigation, supplementary challan was
submitted against him before the learned Trial Court where

he was formally charge sheeted under sections 302 and
324 PPC, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed Trial.
To prove the guilt of the appellant, prosecution examined
as many as eleven witnesses while the statement of PW
Abdullah recorded on 02.10.2012 during proceedings
under section 512 Cr.P.C. as (PW.4), was transposed to the
trial of the appellant. On closure of the prosecution
evidence, statement of the appellant was recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein he denied the prosecution
allegations and professed his innocence. He, however,
declined to be examined on oath under section 340 (2)
Cr.P.C, or to produce evidence in defence. On conclusion
of trial, the learned Trial Court, after hearing both the
sides, convicted and sentenced the appellant as mentioned
above, hence, this appeal.

8. Learned counsel for the appellant argued that
appellant is innocent and has been implicated falsely in the
case on mere suspicions; that escape or let off the
complainant Irshad Khan does not appeal to a prudent
mind and is a strong circumstance to make his presence on
the spot at the time of incident highly doubtful; that
autopsy of the deceased at 7.20 a.m. before making report
at 8.00 a.m., proves the incident to have been reported after
preliminary investigation, deliberation and consultation
after procuring the complainant and PW Abdullah, so
medical evidence belies the prosecution case; that site plan

Exh.PB also negates the ocular account, wherein the
deceased has been shown at point No.1 and the appellant at
point No.4 at the time of first episode of the firing, but no
blood has been secured from point No.1 where the
deceased allegedly got hit and ran towards the house of
Dilbar Khan; that similarly no trail of blood has been
noticed by the I.O. inter se points No.1 and 1A; that
appellant has not confessed his guilt before the competent
Court of law nor has any crime weapon been recovered
either from his direct or indirect possession; that the
alleged crime empties have not been sent to the FSL,
therefore, it is still uncertain as to whether the incident is
the doing of one or more than one persons; that no
construction material and instruments have been taken into
possession from the spot nor shown in the site plan to
support the ocular account. He contended that the learned
Trial Court while over-sighting the above-mentioned
crucial aspects of the case has arrived at erroneous
conclusion by holding the appellant guilty of the offence.
He submitted that for recording conviction in a capital
charge, evidence of unimpeachable character, corroborated
by strong independent circumstances is the requisite
criteria, which is missing in the instant case; that the above
referred circumstances, creates serious doubt in the
prosecution case, benefit of which should have been
extended to the appellant, but the learned Trial Court being

influenced due to singular and direct charge of the
appellant, convicted and sentenced him. He lastly
submitted that the impugned judgment being against the
law, facts and principles of appreciation of evidence in
criminal cases, is liable to be set at naught.

9. Conversely, learned A.A.G. assisted by learned
counsel for the complainant, contended that appellant is
directly and singularly charged for commission of the
offence; that being a broad daylight incident and the
parties well known to each others, question of mistaken
identity does not arise; that there exists no reason that the
complainant will charge innocent person by letting off the
real culprit; that occurrence has taken place at 6.20 a.m.
and both the eyewitnesses shifted the deceased to the
hospital at 7.00 am and this fact by itself has been
established by the defence by putting a question to Ashaq
Hussain ASI (PW.5) (the author of the Murasila), to which
he replied in these words “that he got information about
6.30 a.m. and reach the hospital at about 7.00 a.m. and
report was made at 8.00 a.m.”; that Dr. Younas Nadim
conducted autopsy on the dead body of the deceased at
7.20 a.m.; that injury sheet and inquest report, which are
usually prepared before autopsy, bears the signature of
complainant Irshad Khan and this fact justify his presence
in the hospital at 7.00 a.m.; that escape of complainant
Irshad or his let off by the appellant, does appeal to a

prudent mind, because the appellant had motive only with
10

the deceased and not with the complainant; that non-
availability of trail of blood from point No.1 to point A.1,
is also justifiable because the inter-se distance between the
two places is only 13 paces and the deceased after
receiving injury at point No.1, rushed at the spur of
moment towards Point A.1, and would have covered this
short distance within seconds; that bullet marks on the gate
of the house of Dilbar Khan and recovery of blood from
inside the said house near the main gate coupled with
recovery of 3 crime empties from Point No.4 and 12
empties from point No.4A (the places allotted to accused
in the site plan), corroborates the ocular account; that same
dimension of all the entrance wounds on the person of the
deceased squarely prove the incident to be the doing of
single person for which the appellant has been directly
nominated by the eyewitnesses; that the ocular account
furnished by PWs Irshad Khan and Abdullah, is
trustworthy, confidence inspiring and corroborated by
strong circumstances of the occurrence; that the impugned
judgment being well reasoned and based on _ proper
appreciation of evidence, is not open to any interference by
this Court. They lastly, submitted that there exists no
mitigating circumstance to call for lesser sentence, hence,
the learned Trial Court was justified to award the appellant

the maximum sentence provided for the offence. They
11

sought dismissal of the appeal and requested for
confirmation of death sentence of the appellant.

10. We have heard the exhaustive arguments advanced
at the bar by learned counsel for the parties and perused
the record/evidence with their valuable assistance.

11. It is well-settled principle of dispensation of justice
in criminal cases that guilt against an accused must rest
surely and firmly on the evidence produced in the case and
plain inferences of the guilt may irresistibly be drawn from
the evidence. Prosecution must produce best kind of
evidence to establish accusations against the accused, but
at the same time, the prosecution has no obligation to
produce a good number of witnesses, because it has an
option to produce as many witnesses, which in its
consideration are sufficient to bring home the guilt to the
accused, because it is the quality of evidence and not the
quantity, which is considered in dispensation of justice in
criminal cases. In this view of the matter, the testimony of
a single witness, if rings true, worthy of credence and
validated by circumstantial evidence would be sufficient
for recording conviction. It has also been settled by the
apex Court through numerous pronouncements _ that
conviction in a criminal case can be recorded even on the
statements of eyewitnesses alone, without there being any

corroboration, provided their evidence inspires confidence.
12

12. In this case the ocular account has been furnished
by Irshad Khan Complainant (PW.10) and PW Abdullah
(now dead) and whose statement recorded under section
512 Cr.P.C. as (PW.4), has been transposed to the trial of
the appellant.

13. Complainant Irshad Khan while appearing as
PW.10 reiterated the same episode as narrated by him in
his initial report. He has been subjected to taxing
cross-examination, but nothing beneficial to defence could
be extracted from his mouth and remained stuck to his
stance on every aspect of the incident. By putting certain
questions to this witness, the defence itself has confirmed
some crucial aspects of the incident. In replies to questions
of defence, PW Irshad Khan disclosed that at the time of
firing he was in the knowledge of time i.e. 6.20 a.m.; that
the distance between the spot and the hospital is two
kilometers and they reached the hospital within 15
minutes; that he and PW Abdullah shifted the deceased to
the hospital, so if 15 minutes are added with 6.20 a.m. the
complainant reached the hospital at 6.35 a.m. The replies
of PW Irshad are in line with testimony of Ashiq Hussain
ASI (PW.5) and Dr. Younas Nadim, who conducted
autopsy on the dead body of the deceased. In reply to a
question of defence, PW Ashiq Hussain ASI (Author of the
Murasila) stated that he received information about the

occurrence at 6.30 a.m. and reached the hospital at 7.00
13

a.m. According to Dr. Younas Nadim (PW.3), he
conducted autopsy on the dead body of the deceased at
7.20 a.m. The injury sheet and inquest report of the
deceased, which are always prepared before postmortem,
bears the signature of PW Irshad Khan. The above facts,
appearing from the testimony of the above PWs, squarely
establish the presence of PWs Ashiq Hussain ASI and
Irshad Khan in hospital at 7.00 am. The factum of
presence of the complainant before 07.00 a.m. is further
supplemented by autopsy conducted on the dead body of
the deceased at 7.20 a.m. definitely, after preparation of the
injury sheet and inquest report, which clearly proves that
the occurrence was reported to PW.5 before postmortem,
injury sheet and inquest report. The time of report shown
as 8.00 a.m. by PW.5 in the Murasila is surely the
negligence on his part for which the complainant shall not
be set at a disadvantage. Though, the complainant in his
statement before the Court has followed the time of report
mentioned by PW.5 in the Murasila, but only for such an
action, his integrity cannot be suspected nor his statement
be discarded in toto, rather those portions of his statement
can be taken into account which find corroboration from
other independent evidence. Credibility of the complainant
and liability of the accused, are to be adjudged on the basis
of entire evidence on record. Mere an omission, inadvertent

or deliberate, on the part of a police official, cannot be
14

based for adverse inference against the prosecution.
Statement of the complainant was read with care and
caution, which fully supports the prosecution case and his
deposition furnishing trustworthy incriminating evidence,
against the sole accused, having no motive to falsely
involve him in the heinous offence of murder. In this view
of the matter, we am firm in my mind that neither any
preliminary investigation has been conducted nor has the
report been lodged after consultation and deliberation. The
negligence of the Author of Murasila, particularly, when
complainant was nonprofessional having no knowledge of
the legal complications and consequences of scribing of
late report, would not be sufficient to discard his testimony,
whose presence at the spot at the time of occurrence is
otherwise squarely proved. He being the real brother of the
deceased his presence with the deceased in construction
work is quite natural. The unscathed of PW Irshad Khan
from the firing of the appellant or his let off by the
appellant, does appeal to a prudent mind for the simple
reason that appellant had motive only with the deceased
and not the complainant, so the deceased was his only
prey. In regard to the non-recovery of blood at point No.1
and no trail of blood from point No.1 to point 1A, it is
observed from the site plan that there is distance of only 13
paces inter-se the two places which is easily coverable in

the spur of eye, particularly, when there is a threat of life. It
15

is also not strange to believe that the deceased while
covering a short distance of 13 paces in a few seconds,
blood would not have reached/fallen on the ground, for the
reason that on one hand, it appears from the record that in
the first volley, when the deceased was hit, he
spontaneously rushed towards the house of Dilbar, while
on the other hand, the clothes of the deceased have been
recovered dyed in human blood; manifestly indicates that
the blood; if any, oozed from the wound of the deceased in
such short span of time, must have been absorbed by the
worn clothes of the deceased. Blood from the house of
Dilbar Khan i.e. point 1A, has been recovered through
recovery memo by the I.0., which corroborates the ocular
account. Similarly, 03 empties of 7.62 bore from point
No.4, allotted to the appellant, wherefrom he fired at the
deceased for the first time and recovery of 12 empties of
the same bore, from point 4A, i.e. the place wherefrom he
fired at the deceased for the second time coupled with the
bullet marks on the main gate of the house of Dilbar Khan,
substantiate the ocular account of the eyewitnesses. As
regards non-recovery of the construction material and
instruments and not showing the same in the site plan the
same would not be fatal for the prosecution case as
according to PW Irshad Khan he had shown such materials
to the I.O., but he did not point out the same in the site

plan, which amounts to negligence of the I.O. It has been
16

held by the worthy Sindh High Court in case of “Nawab
Ali Vs the State” (2014 P Cr L J 885), complainant,
should not suffer for the fault of prosecution or mistake of
the investigating Officer in properly noting-down the facts,
while in discharge of his duties and functions. If such
discrepancy was allowed to supersede the direct ocular
account, it would result in allowing the culprits safe
passage by managing/arranging such discrepancies, which
could well be claimed to be protected by prosecution to be
bona fide mistake/errors. The only contradiction about time
of report in this case which otherwise, have been justified
from the record is trivial in nature and would not damage
the prosecution case. The word “Contradiction” used in
criminal administration of justice, means those conflicts in
the evidence of the witnesses which touches and disturbs
the root of the charge. Minor contradictions are bound to
creep by lapse of time and such minor discrepancies in the
statements of the PWs are inbuilt proof of the truthfulness
because a human being is not expected to furnish a tape-
recorded statement.

14. Any defect or omission on the part of any police
official during investigation of the case by itself, would not
be a ground for acquittal of the accused. If primacy is given
to such designed or negligence of the police officials or to
the omissions or lapses by perfunctory actions or

contaminated conducted of the police Officer, the fate and
17

confidence of the people in the criminal administration of
justice, would be eroded. Where there had been any
negligence or omission on the part of the police officials,
which resulted in a defective investigation, there is a legal
obligation on the part of the Court to examine the
prosecution evidence, dehors such lapses, carefully to find
out whether the said evidence is reliable or not and to what
extent it is reliable and as to whether such lapses effected
the object of finding out the truth. Therefore, an omission
or negligence on the part of the police officials, while
recording the FIR would not be the solitary reason for
judicial scrutiny in a criminal trial and the conclusion of
the trial in the case cannot be allowed to depend solely on
the probity of investigation.

15. From the above, it is manifest that omissions or
lapses, on the part of the police officials, cannot be a sole
ground for acquittal of an accused, in view of any defect or
negligence of the Investigating Agency, because doing so,
would tantamount to play in the contaminated hands of the
author of Murasila and Investigation Officer, rather, the
Court should circumspect and be careful in evaluating the
prosecution evidence. In such eventuality, the eyewitness
account cannot be brushed aside on the sole ground that
the author of Murasila has mentioned the time of report as
8.00 am which is after the time of conducting autopsy. As

discussed in the preceding Paragraph of the judgment, it
18

does not create any doubt in the prosecution case, rather
prima facie is an omission or negligence on the part of the
police official. There is no cavil to the proposition that
benefit of doubt is to be extended to the accused, but that
doubt should be such, which may inherently affect the
prosecution case and pricks the mind of the Court about
genuineness of the allegations. Mere artificial or any
hypothetical doubts should not be made basis for acquittal
of accused. It is also settled by judicial pronouncements
that the accused shall be considered as a beloved child of
the Court, but at the same time, the aggrieved party is also
not to be treated as an alien, as it is he who approaches
the Court for redressal of his grievance against aggression
of accused instead of taking the law in his hands. It is he
who being oppressed by aggressor, put the matter before
the Court for justice. If in a genuine case, the grievance of
such a victim is not redressed, the people must get
frustrated from the judicial system and would turn wild for
lynching, and such a situation would become more
alarming. The penal laws carry multi dimensional impact
at different levels. First and foremost is to punish the
culprit and to pacify the victim. The punishment so
inflicted acts as a deterrent to the criminals and resultantly
it brings about peace and tranquility and transforms the

society into civilized one.
19

16. Adverting to the statement of eyewitness
Abdullah, his statement had been recorded on 02.10.2012,
in proceeding under section 512 Cr.P.C. against the
appellant. Prior to arrest of the appellant, the said PW was
murdered, therefore, his testimony was transposed to the
trial of the appellant. The order qua transfer of statement of
this witness has attained finality, as the same order has not
been questioned before any competent forum. By virtue of
Article 47 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984, evidence
given by a witness in a judicial proceeding or before any
person authorized by law to take it, is relevant for the
purpose of proving the same in a subsequent judicial
proceeding or in a later stage of the same judicial
proceeding, the truth of the facts which it states, when the
witness is dead or cannot be found or is incapable of
giving evidence. The aforesaid article has been inserted in
the Statute to meet such like situation. Similarly, section
512 Cr.P.C. provides three eventualities for preservation
and transfer of statement of witnesses, during abscondence
of accused i.e. if the deponent is dead or incapable or
giving evidence or his attendance cannot be procured
without an amount of delay, expense or inconvenience,
which under the circumstances of the case, would be

unreasonable. Section 512 Cr.P.C. provides a special rule
20

of evidence which is an exception to the general rule that
all evidence in a criminal case shall be taken in the
presence of the accused or his counsel when his personal
appearance is dispensed with. Purpose to preserve the
important evidence till the time accused is arrested. Object
of section 512 Cr.P.C. is to exclude the possibility of loss
of evidence at the time the accused is arrested and such
statements are considered as substantive evidence. The
statement of PW Abdullah has remained unchallenged
wherein he while narrating the entire episode has not only
substantiated the stance of the complainant, but has
charged directly the appellant for commission of the
offence. He has also verified his signature over the report
of complainant

17. No doubt, PW Irshad Khan is the real
brother of the deceased and PW Abdullah is his real
cousin, but it is now almost a fashion that public is
reluctant to appear and depose before the court, especially
in criminal cases and the cases for that reason itself are
dragged for years and years. By now it is a well-
established principle of law that testimony of a witness
otherwise inspiring confidence cannot be discarded on the
ground that he being a relative of the deceased. A close
relative who is a very natural witness cannot be termed as
interested witness. The term “interested” postulates that

the person concerned must have some direct interest in
21

seeing the accused person being convicted somehow or
the other either because of animosity or for some other
reasons. Not needed to emphasize that mere relationship
of PW Irshad Khan with the deceased would not detract
from his veracity, as he had absolutely no motive of his
own to involve the appellant falsely by letting off the real
assassinator of his brother. Guidance in this regard can be
derived from case titled, “Saeed Akhtar and others Vs
the State” (2000 SCMR 383). In case titled, “Amal
Sherin and another Vs the State through A.G.” (PLD
2004 Supreme Court 371), the Hon’ble Supreme Court
while dilating upon the evidentiary value of statement of
related witnesses observed as under:-

“The trial Court was not justified to reject
eyewitness account furnished by
complainant Khan Amir PW and Hakim Gul
PW merely on the ground of being related
and interested particularly when appellants
had not been able to establish on record that
the above mentioned witnesses had
nourished any grudge or ill will against them
and deposed with a specific motive”.

18. For the reasons discussed above, I entertain no
amount of doubt about the presence of eyewitnesses on the
spot at the time of occurrence as well as their credibility
and truthfulness. In support of the findings, reliance may
be placed on the judgment of the Hon’ble apex Court in

case titled, “Amal Sherin and another Vs the State
22

through A.G. NWFP” PLD 2003 Supreme Court 371),
wherein it has been held that:-

“Conviction in a criminal case can be
recorded even on _ the statement of
eyewitnesses alone without there being any
corroboration provided their evidence
inspires confidence”.

Similar view has been reiterated by the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in case titled, “Mst. Sughara Begum and another
Vs Qaisar Pervez and others” (2015 SCMR 1142) in
these words:-

“That ocular account in case of ‘Qatl-e-
Amd’ plays a decisive and vital role and once
its intrinsic worth is accepted and believed
then the rest of the _ evidence, both
circumstantial and corroboratory in nature, is
required as a matter of caution, but to the
contrary, once the ocular account is
disbelieved, then no other evidence, even of a
high degree and value, would be sufficient for
recording conviction on a capital charge,
therefore, probative value of the ocular
account is to be seen in light of the facts and
circumstances of each case”.

19. Deriving wisdoms and _ guidance from the
principles laid down by the August Apex Court in cases
Amal Sherin and another and Mst. Sughara Begum
(supra), we, while accepting the intrinsic worth of the
ocular account furnished by PWs Irshad Khan and

Abdullah, hold that learned Trial Court while convicting
23

the appellant, has committed no wrong. The findings of the
learned Trial Court are well reasoned and based on proper
appreciation of evidence.

20. Now the moot question for determination would be
the quantum of sentence to be awarded to the appellant to
meet the ends of justice. On the face of record and
evidence, the occurrence has not taken place in the spur of
moment. Coming of the appellant to the spot duly armed
with lethal weapon, firing at the deceased on one occasion
and chasing him till the house of Dilbar Khan and doing
him away there, squarely proves his prior intention to do
the deceased away. The conduct of the appellant
demonstrated by him at the time of incident, leaves no
room for any mitigating circumstance to warrant lesser
sentence. The learned Trial Court has, therefore, rightly
awarded him the normal penalty of death to which no
exception can be taken. Similarly, the punishment awarded
to the appellant under section 324 PPC by the learned
Trial Court is also justified. The impugned
judgment of the learned Trial Court being
well reasoned and based on proper appreciation of
evidence on record is not open to any interference by this
Court in its appellate jurisdiction.

21. Accordingly, this appeal being meritless is hereby

dismissed and Murder Reference No.10 of 2015, sent by
24

the learned Trial Court in terms of Section 374 Cr.P.C. is
hereby answered in the Affirmative.
