respect of an offence of double murder
committed at the vicinity of village Lantoor,
therefore, he, along with other police party

complainant/SHO found the dead body of the

female deceased, Mst. Rabia as well as that of
male deceased, Hazrat Ali, lying in a pool of
blood, in the landed property situated adjacent
to the house of co-accused, Muhammad Saeed.
Both the deceased were done to death through
firearms as they have received multiple injuries
on different parts of their bodies. At the spot,
the complainant/SHO came to known that on
the instigation of the co-accomplice,
Muhammad Saeed, both the deceased were
killed by the accused/appellant, Saddam
Hussain, on the alleged pretext of honour. The
event was reduced into in writing in the shape
of Murasila’ (Ex. PA/1) followed by the ibid
FIR (Ex. PW-1/1) registered against the
accused/appellant & other co-accused at P.S

concerned,

3. Upon arrest of the
accused/appellant & other co-accused followed
by completion of the investigation, challan was
drawn and was sent- up for trial to the learned
trial Court. Accused were confronted with the

statements of allegations through a formal

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan

charge-sheet to which they pleaded not guilty

and claimed trial.

4, To substantiate the guilt of the
accused, the prosecution furnished its account
consist of the statements of twelve (12)
witnesses. The accused were confronted with
the evidence so furnished through statements of

accused within the meaning of section 342

Cr.P.C.

5. On conclusion of the proceedings/
trial, in view of the evidence so recorded and
the assistance so rendered by the learned
counsel for the accused/appellant and learned
counsel for the complainant/learned State
counsel, the learned trial Court arrived at the
conclusion that the prosecution has successfully
brought home charge against the appellant/
accused through cogent & worth reliable
evidence, as such, the accused/appellant,

Both the sentences were ordered to run concurrently,
however, the accused/appellant has been acquitted U/S
311 PPC.

The accused/appellant has also been extended the
benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C,

The co-accomplice, Muhammad Saeed, has been
acquitted of the charges leveled against him, by
extending him the benefit of the doubt.

6. It obliged the appellant/accused to
approach this Court through the subject

criminal appeal.

7, Learned counsel for the accused/
appellant as well as the learned Astt: A.G
have been heard at a length and the record

gone through with their valuable assistance.

8. At first & foremost instance, it
shall be kept in mind that the subject
occurrence of murder of both the deceased is
an unseen event, on all counts. It is part of the
record and as evident from the contents of the
‘Murasila’ followed by the FIR that the
complainan/SHO, Lal Bahadar Khan,
proceeded to the place of occurrence, pursuant
to receipt of prior information in respect of an
offence double murder committed at the
vicinity. At the spot, the complainant/SHO

came to know that both the deceased i.e. Mst.

‘Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-5-
Rabia and Hazrat Ali were killed by the

accused/appellant, Saddam Hussain through
firearm, on the alleged instigation of his father
ie. the co-accused, Muhammad Saeed. The
offence was alleged to have been committed
on the pretext of honour. It is part of the
record that the female deceased, Mst. Rabia
was the wife of the accused/appellant,
Saddam Hussain. The prosecution has also
produced one Lal Khan, the father of the
deceased lady Mst. Rabia. He appeared in the
witness-box as PW-4. In his  cross-
examination, he stated that his house is
situated in village Loainel, whereas, the
occurrence took place at the vicinity of village
Lantoor and the distance between the two
villages is 02 kilometers. He also deposed in
his examination-in-cross that he is not an
eyewitness of the occurrence. Apart from the
aforesaid PW, the prosecution could not
produce any other witness qua the ocular-
account of the occurrence, therefore, in all

probabilities, the unfortunate incident of the

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
-6-

murder of both the deceased could be termed

a “blind murder”.

9. The occurrence in the subject
case is unseen & un-witnessed, as referred to
above, and the case of the prosecution against
the appellant/accused is mainly based on the
fact that he was not only the husband of the
female deceased, Mst. Rabia but his initial
conduct & demeanor was dubious &
suspicious in nature. The accused/appellant
and his father i.e. the co-accomplice,
Muhammad Saeed have neither lodged the
report of the subject occurrence to the local
police nor have they participated in the ritual
proceedings of the deceased lady Mst. Rabia.
No doubt, Hon’ble Apex Court has held in its
judgment rendered in case titled “Saeed Ahmad
v/s The State” reported as 2015 SCMR 710 that
with regard to vulnerable members of society,
such as children, women and the infirm, who
were living with the accused or were last seen
in his company, the accused ought to offer
some explanation of what happened to them. If

instead he remains silent or offers a false

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
-7-

explanation he casts a shadow upon himself.
But it has also been noted therein that it did not
mean that the burden of proof had shifted on to
the accused as it is for the prosecution to prove
its case. Ratio of the judgment of Saeed Ahmad
Supra cannot however be applied to the case in
hand for the reason that prosecution have not
been able to discharge its onus as explained
above. Initial burden of proof always lies on the
prosecution, which though may get shifted to
accused under Article 122 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order 1984, under circumstances
justifying such shifting of burden, but in the
case in hand, it is noticeable that prosecution
has not been able, even to discharge its initial
burden of proof. Hon’ble Supreme Court of

Pakistan in the case of “Nasrullah alias Nasro

w/s The State” reported as 2017 SCMR 724 had
observed, in this respect;

“ It has been argued by the learned counsel for

the complainant that in the cases of Arshad
Mehmood v. The State (2005 SCMR 1524) and
Saeed Ahmed v. The State (2015 SCMR 710) this
Court had held that where a wife of a person or any
vulnerable dependent dies an unnatural death in the
house of such person then some part of the onus lies
on him to establish the circumstances in which such
unnatural death had occurred, The learned counsel
for the complainant has maintained that the stand
taken by the appellant regarding suicide having been
committed by the deceased was neither established
by him nor did it fit into the circumstances of the

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan

-8-

case, particularly when the medical evidence
contradicted the same. Be that as it may holding by
this Court that some part of the onus lies on the
accused person in such a case does not mean that
the entire burden of proof shifts to the accused
person in a case of this nature. It has already been
clarified by this Court in the case of Abdul Majeed v.
The State (2011 SCMR 941) that the prosecution is
bound to prove its case against an accused person
beyond reasonable doubt at all stages of a criminal
case and in a case where the prosecution asserts
presence of some eye-witnesses and such claim of
the prosecution is not established by it there the
accused person could not be convicted merely on the
basis of a presumption that since the murder of his
wife had taken place in his house, therefore, it must
be he and none else who would have committed that
murder.”

A somewhat similar findings have
also been recorded by Hon’ble Apex Court in its
judgment in the case of “Nazeer Ahmad v/s The
State” reported as 2016 SCMR 1628, which are
reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

“It may be true that when a vulnerable dependant is
done to death inside the confines of a house,
particularly during a night, there some part of the
onus lies on the close relatives of the deceased to
explain as to how their near one had met an
unnatural death but where the prosecution utterly
Jails to prove its own case against an accused person
there the accused person cannot be convicted on the
sole basis of his failure to explain the death. These
aspects of the legal issue have been commented upon
by this Court in the cases of Arshad Mehmood v.
The State (2005 SCMR 1524), Abdul Majeed v. The
State (2011 SCMR 941) and Saeed Ahmed v. The
State (2015 SCMR 710).”

Likewise, in the case of

“Muhammad Jamsheed and another v/s The

State_and_ others” reported as 2016 SCMR
1019, Hon’ble Apex Court had observed that
suspicion howsoever grave or strong could

never be a proper substitute for proof, beyond

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-9-

reasonable doubt, required in a criminal case. In
context of the case in hand, the prosecution has
not been able to bring on record any ocular
evidence which could connect the accused/
appellant with the murder of both the deceased
nor there is any sort of circumstantial evidence
against the appellant in the field except the
recovery of weapon of offence i.e. Kalashnikov.
The said recovery of weapon of offence is also
doubtful in a sense that the crime empties
recovered from the spot vide recovery memo,
Ex. PW-2/2 dated 01.07.2020 have not been
sent to the FSL earlier and were sent and
received in the FSL on 08.07.2020 after
recovery of the weapon of offence vide
recovery memo, Ex. PW-6/2 dated
06.07.2020. A matching report of the FSL, Ex.
PW-12/12, in such circumstances, cannot be
relied upon. Hon’ble Apex Court in somewhat
similar situation in the case of “Israr Ali v/s

The State” reported as “2007 SCMR 525” has

discarded such a report of matching of empty,

by observing as;

Crime empty was not sent to the expert
immediately after taking into possession and

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-10-

the weapon of offence was recovered from
the convicVappellant after his arrest as borne
out from the statement of P.W.16. P.W.15
Muhammad Arshad had taken possession of
Crime-empty Exh.P.7 vide memo. Exh.P.H.
on 10-10-1999, His statement is silent to
whom he had given the said memo. P.W.14
Muhammad Akhtar — stated in his
examination-in -chief that Muhammad
Arshad S.-I. handed over to him sealed
parcel containing crime-empty for safe
custody in the Malkhana. This fact was not
mentioned in his statement which was
recorded by Investigating Officer under
section 161, Cr.P.C. thrice on 10-10-1999
and 23-10-1999 as evident from cross-
examination which is to the following effect:-

"I narrated to the Investigating
Officer that parcel containing crime
empty was handed over to him by
Investigating Officer confronted
with Exh.D.C. where it is not so
recorded,"

Tt was also admitted by him in cross-
examination that he did not state before the
Investigating Officer in his statement
Exh.D.C. that the parcel containing crime
empty was handed over to Khadim Hussain
P.W.4. He also admitted that he did not send
crime empty to expert till 1-12-1999,
Khadim Hussain P.W.4_— stated in
examination-in-chief that he received parcel
containing empty bullet on 3-11-1999 from
Muhammad Akhtar P.W.14. He handed
over to Muhammad Ramzan for onward
transmission in the office of Forensic
Science Laboratory. P.W.16 Khalid Rauf
arrested appellant on 5-12-1999. He also got
recovered the pistol from him on his
pointation. Thereafter he had handed over
pistol to P.W.4 Khadim Hussain. This type
of recovery of crime empty does not provide
strong corroboration qua the prosecution
version

Further reliance in this respect may
also be placed on the case of Apex Court reported
as 2008 SCMR 707, whereby, it was held that
crime empties allegedly found at the place of

occurrence were retained in police station and

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
Ss

-ll-

were sent to FSL, along with the crime weapons,
12 days after the recovery of alleged weapons.
Delay had destroyed the evidential value of such
piece of evidence and the recoveries could not
offer any corroboration to the ocular testimony.
Even otherwise, when substantive evidence
fails to connect the accused person with the
commission of offence or is disbelieved,
corroborative evidence is of no help to the
prosecution as the corroborative evidence
cannot by itself prove the prosecution’s case.
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan while
giving its judgment in case titled “Muhammad
Afzal alias Abdullah and others vs. The State
and others” reported as 2009 SCMR 639 has
also expressed almost a similar view in para-12

of its judgment, which is reproduced hereunder

for ready reference;

“After taking out from consideration the ocular
evidence, the evidence of identification and the
medical evidence, we are left with the evidence of
recoveries only, which being purely corroboratory
in nature, in our view, alone is not capable to bring
home charge against the appellant in the absence
of any direct evidence because it is well-settled that
unless direct or substantive evidence is available
conviction cannot be recorded on the basis of any
other type of evidence howsoever, convincing it
may be.”

Hon’ble Supreme Court of

Pakistan in its judgment rendered in case titled

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
&S

-12-
“Imran_Ashraf_& 7 others v/s The State”
reported as 2001 SCMR 424, has also observed;
“Recovery of incriminating articles is used for
the purpose of providing corroboration to the
ocular testimony. Ocular evidence and
recoveries, therefore, are to be considered
simultaneously in order to reach for a just
conclusion."

In support of same ratio, further
reliance may also be placed on the judgment
reported as 2007 SCMR 1427.

10. As far as the medical evidence is
concerned, needless to highlight that the
medical evidence may confirm the direct or
ocular account, if any, with regard to the set of
injuries, kind of weapon allegedly used in the
commission of offence and at least the nature
of injuries, however, in the subject case when
the occurrence is undoubtedly unseen & un-
witnessed then evidentiary value of
medical evidence qua the guilt of the appellant
as a sole piece of corroboratory evidence
cannot be given much weight. Reliance in this
regard is placed on the case titled “Abdul

Rashid v/s The State” reported as 2019 P Cr.

LJ 1456, whereby it has been held that;-

“The medical evidence in this case has been
furnished by PW-4 Dr. Nasreen Ahmad Tareen,
Medical Officer, who has confirmed the unnatural
death of deceased. However, the fact remain that
medical evidence is only used for confirmation of

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
Ss

-13-

ocular evidence regarding seat of injury, time of
occurrence and weapon of offence used, etc. but
medical cvidence itself does not constitute any
corroboration qua the identity of accused person to
prove their culpability. Reliance in this regard can

be placed on the case of “Muhammad Sharif &
another v/s The State” (1997 SCMR 866).

In context of the subject case, the
medical evidence has been furnished by Dr.
Muhammad Yaseen, PW-9. In the opening line of
his cross-examination, he stated that no internal
postmortem or autopsy of the dead bodies of the
deceased could be conducted in the case in hand.
In the same breath, he also stated that in his
reports he has not mentioned the names of the
identifiers of the dead bodies of the deceased,
therefore, the medical evidence, if any, is of no
use for the prosecution qua the guilt of the
accused/appellant. Same was the case with other
circumstantial evidence produced in the case in
hand.

11. In view of the above, when
neither any direct nor any circumstantial
evidence is available on the face of the record,
as such, the case of prosecution is full of doubt
all-around; therefore, the accused/appellant has

to be extended its benefit.

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
Ss

-14-

12. It is well settled, it is not essential
at all to place reliance on multiple doubts
coupled with multiple grounds to extend the
benefit of doubt to an accused, even a single
worth reliable doubt is sufficient enough to
extend its benefit to an accused person as it is
the cardinal principle of criminal administration
of justice that let hundred guilty persons be
acquitted but one innocent person should not be
convicted. In the case of “Tarig Pervaiz v4 The
State” reported as 1995 SCMR 1345 , the Apex
Court has held as under;-

That the concept of benefit of doubt to an accused
person is deep-rooted in our country. For giving him
benefit of doubt, it is not necessary that there should
be many circumstances creating doubts. If there is a
circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a
prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then the
accused will be entitled to the benefit not as a matter
of grace and concession but as a matter of right.

Further reliance is placed on the

case law cited as “Daniel boyd (Muslim
name Saifullah) vs_the State” reported as
1992 SCMR_196”, where the following
observations were recorded by the Apex

Court;-

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
52

-15-

Nobody is to be punished unless proved guilty on
the basis of reliable or true evidence. Benefit of
every reasonable doubt is to go to the accused.

This view also reflects in the
judgment of the apex Court titled as

“Ghulam Qadir and 2 others vs the State”

reported as 2008 SCMR 1221, wherein it

was observed that:-

"Benefit of doubt. Principle of applicability. For
the purpose of benefit of doubt to an accused, more
than one infirmity is not required. Single infirmity
creates reasonable doubt in the mind of a
reasonable and prudent person regarding the truth
of charge, makes the whole case doubtful. "

In support of the same rational,
further reliance is placed on the judgment of

the august Supreme Court of Pakistan cited as

“Muhammad Zaman _vs,_the State” (2014
SCMR 749), wherein it was held that;-

Even a single doubt if found reasonable, was
enough to warrant acquittal of the accused.

13. For what has been discussed
above, this Court is of the firm view that the
prosecution has failed to prove its case against
the accused/ appellant, Saddam Hussain
beyond reasonable doubt, as such, his

conviction cannot be maintained. Resultantly,

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. justice Shahid Khon
; 2

-16-
while extending him the benefit of the doubt

the subject criminal appeal is allowed and the
impugned order/judgment of conviction and
sentence dated 03.06.2021 recorded by the
leared trial Court is set aside and
consequently the appellant named above is
acquitted of the charges leveled against him.
He be released forthwith from the Jail, if not

otherwise required.

14, These are reasons for our short
order of even date. t
