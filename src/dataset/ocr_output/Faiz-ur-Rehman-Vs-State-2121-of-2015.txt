JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- Petitioner

Faiz ur Rehman, seeks bail in case FIR No.218 dated
31.08.2015, registered under section 302/311 PPC, in
Police Station Yar Hussain Swabi, wherein he is charged
by Gul Rehman (his father), for committing the murder of
his sister Mst. Azra with firearm.

2. At the very outset, learned counsel for the
petitioner stated at the bar that the deceased being
un-married is survived by her father Gul Rehman and
mother Mst. Ranra Jan, who both have effected
compromise with the petitioner by waiving their rights of
Qisas and Diyat. To this effect, learned counsel referred to
their joint statement recorded before the learned lower
court on 26.10.2015.

3. In view of the joint statement of LRs of the

deceased coupled with the fact that the offence is

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

compoundable, the compromise is accepted and the
petitioner is directed to be released on bail subject to his
furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
learned Illaqa Judicial Magistrate/MOD concerned.

4. Before parting with the judgment, I deem it
appropriate to mention here that $.311 PPC, has wrongly
been inserted by the police in the FIR, because the said
section provides punishment as Taâ€™azir for the offender
with whom the LRs of the deceased compound the offence
or they waived their rights of Qisas and Diyat, if the
learned trial Court keeping in view the facts and
circumstances and if the principle of Fasa fil Arz is
attracted, may award him punishment as Ta,azir.
Therefore, insertion of $.311 PPC on the very first day of
registration of FIR, without any compromise is
unwarranted.

5. The Additional Registrar (Judicial ) of this
court is directed to send copy of this judgment to the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-I Lahor Swabi for
guidance and learned Sessions Judge Swabi who shall
circulate the same among Additional Sessions Judges, of
the District.
