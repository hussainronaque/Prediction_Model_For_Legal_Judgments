QAISER RASHID KHAN, J. Through the

instant appeal, the appellant has questioned the
judgment of the learned Additional Sessions Judge-IJ,
Mardan dated 25.4.2014 whereby the vehicle of the
appellant was confiscated to the State.

2. Briefly stated facts leading to the instant appeal
are that pursuant to prior information on 14.6.2013, a
Suzuki Mehran Motorcar No. ICT HH-502 Islamabad
was intercepted by the local police which was driven by
accused Abdul Muhammad at the relevant time while
his co-accused Zarin was sitting on the front seat.
During search of the vehicle and on opening the petrol
tank of the motorcar, 8 packets of Charas Pukhta each
weighing 1000 grams, were recovered. The accused
were arrested and the motorcar was taken into
possession as case property by the local police vide case

FIR No.352 dated 14.6.2013 under section 9 (c) CNS
Act, Police Station Toru  Mardan. Before the
commencement of trial, the appellant applied to the
learned trial court for its return on superdari but his
request was turned down vide judgment dated
18.9.2013. At the trial held before the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-II/ Judge Special Court
Mardan, each of the accused was convicted under
section 9 (c) CNSA for jointly possessing 8000 grams
Charas and sentenced to six years R.I. and to pay a fine
of Rs.30,000/- each or in default to suffer further six
months S.I with benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C and the
motorcar was also confiscated in favour of the State vide
judgment dated 25.4.2014. Appeal preferred
thereagainst before this court was allowed and the
judgment impugned therein was set aside but to the
extent of acquittal of the accused only and the order
regarding confiscation of the vehicle was maintained
vide judgment of this court dated 24.9.2014 in Cr.A No.
274-P/2014, hence this appeal.

3. Learned counsel for the appellant argued that the
vehicle in question is the sole ownership of the appellant
and there is no rival claimant of the same; that the
learned trial court has committed serious illegality by
not complying with the provisions of sections 32 and 33
of the CNSA; that the appellant was unaware regarding

use of the vehicle in the commission of the offence and
that the vehicle has been parked in the Police Station in
the open sky and its condition is deteriorating day by
day. Therefore, the appellant has prayed for return of the
vehicle being the bonafide owner of the same.

4. The learned AAG appearing for the State
supported the impugned judgment on almost the same
grounds mentioned therein.

Arguments heard and available record perused.

5. The appellant seeks the return of Suzuki Mehran
motorcar claiming to be its bonafide owner. As detailed
above, from the same very vehicle being driven by
Abdul Muhammad and accompanied by his co-accused
Zarin, 8 KGs of Charas were recovered and the vehicle
was thus impounded on 14.6.2013. Before the
commencement of the trial, the appellant had applied for
return of the vehicle on superdari but his request was
turned down by the learned trial court on 18.9.2013. The
said order was not challenged by the appellant in appeal
before this court and has thus attained finality. After the
commencement of trial, the appellant did not submit any
application before the learned trial Judge in order to
associate himself with the trial so as to unearth the truth
or at least for the purpose of the custody of the vehicle
till the trial was concluded and through the impugned

judgment besides the conviction and sentence of the
accused, the vehicle in question was also confiscated to
the State.

6. The argument of the learned counsel for the
appellant that the appellant had no knowledge about the
trial proceedings which finally culminated in the
confiscation of his vehicle stands totally belied in view
of the earlier application submitted by the appellant for
the custody of vehicle followed by its dismissal by the
learned trial Judge. Thus the appellant can neither feign
nor plead ignorance about the proceedings that went on
before the learned trial court. Moreover, for all practical
purposes, the appellant was stranger to the proceedings
before the learned trial court as the vehicle is not
registered in his name and he is merely brandishing
some bargain receipt in his hand on the basis of which
he is laying claim over the vehicle. The argument
regarding want of knowledge about the trial proceedings
in respect of the vehicle is only available to the
registered owner of the vehicle who in the present case
has not surfaced todate. Of late, it has been noticed in a
good number of narcotics cases that the registered
owners always prefer to stay in the background and it is
always some bargain receipt holder or a person with an
open transfer letter who lodges a claim for the custody
of the vehicle before the learned trial Judge. Likewise in

many instances it has been observed that such receipts
or for that matter the open transfer letters are procured
with a degree of finesse so as to side track the
investigation in the case on the one hand and to secure
the release of the vehicle on the other. The mafias
engaged in the narco trade sitting on the sidelines have
adopted various devices for the smooth running of their
lucrative illegal business and the same also includes
securing the release of the vehicles involved in narcotics
smuggling which though belong to them but are
registered in the names of their small minions.
7. Another interesting or rather intriguing aspect
which has caught the attention of this court is that the
appellant did not challenge the impugned confiscation
order dated 25.4.2014 before this court till the acquittal
of the accused on 24.9.2014 in Cr.A No. 274-P/2014
and thereafter thought it fit to express his grievance
against the confiscation order by filing this time-barred
appeal on 2.12.2014. The same speaks volumes for the
conduct of the appellant and his alleged claim over the
confiscated vehicle.

In view of the foregoing discussion, this appeal
being meritless and hopelessly time-barred stands
dismissed.
