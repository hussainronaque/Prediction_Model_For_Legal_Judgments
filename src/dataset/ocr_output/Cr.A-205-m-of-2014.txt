Case No. 11/7 of the year 2013 decided by the Court

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
ss

of learned Additional Sessions Judge-II/Izafi Zila
Qazi Buner.

2. Facts of the prosecution case as
deciphered from the contents of First Information
Report (Ex. PA) are that complainant Israr while
shifting the corpus of his deceased brother Zarsheed
to the police station on 04.9.2011 at 13:00 reported
that on the doomful day he was present in the
sawmill of one Hazrat Islam situated within the local
limits of Gharib Abad Jangai. In the meanwhile, the
accused/Appellant Askar Ali duly armed with pistol
came there and without saying anything started firing
at his brother Zarsheed as a result of which he was
hit on different parts of his body and died at the spot.
In addition to the complainant, the occurrence was
stated to be witnessed by Behroz and so many other
persons present at the spot. At the time of lodging of
the report, the complainant shown total ignorance in
respect of the motive being unaware.

3. Since the accused/Appellant soon after the
occurrence was avoiding his lawful arrest, therefore,
the proceedings under section 512 Cr.P.C was
carried out against him on 30.4.2012 by producing

the relevant witnesses of prosecution from PW-1 to

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
23s

PW-9 before the Court of learned Sessions
Judge/Zila Qazi Buner.

4. Upon arrest of the accused/Appellant and
conclusion of investigation, complete challan has
been submitted against him before the Court of
learned Sessions Judge/Zila Qazi Buner on
22.02.2013, wherein after fulfillment of codal and
legal formalities he was charge-sheeted by the
learned Trial Court on 27.02.2013. Since the
asservations levelled therein were not acceptable to
him, therefore, he posed innocence and __ thereby
claimed trial.

5. In a full dressed trial, the prosecution
examined Dr. Sher Zaman Khan Medical Officer as
PW-1 who has conducted postmortem examination
of the deceased and submitted his report as Ex. PM-
1, Muhammad Shah Khan SHO as PW-2, Perwaiz
Khan Constable bearing No. 79 as PW-3, Akhtar
Rahman official of Frontier Constabulary bearing
No. 706 as PW-4, Sher Shah as PW-5, Mudasar Shah
as PW-6, Israr as PW-7 who is complainant and
alleged eyewitness of this case, Ali Zar Shah as PW-

8 who is another alleged eyewitness of the

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
-4-

occurrence, Ghulam Khan SI as PW-9, Ajmal Khan
ASI as PW-10 and Lal Said Shah Khan as PW-11.

6. At the end upon conclusion of evidence of
the prosecution, statement of accused/Appellant Ali
Askar was recorded u/s 342 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, thereby posed innocence and stated to
have falsely been implicated in the case. He,
however, appeared in his own defence as DW-1 and
recorded statements of Shah Jehan as DW-2 and
Hazrat Islam as DW-3, who is the owner of sawmill
wherein the allegedly occurrence took place. After
hearing arguments of learned counsel for the parties
at length the decision under conviction for the
sentences was delivered.

7. Having heard arguments of learned
counsel for the accused/Appellant, learned counsel
for the complainant and learned State counsel, record
was gone through with their able assistance.

9. In the light of thorough and valuable
arguments addressed at the Bar by learned counsel
for the parties including learned State counsel and in
view of the dictums of the superior Courts relied
upon by each of the party in respect of their
divergent claims, the first and the foremost question
which is to be determined by this Court is the
presence of the alleged eyewitnesses of the
occurrence i.e. PW-7 Israr the complainant/brother
of the deceased Zarsheed and PW-8 Ali Zarshah at
the venue of crime i.e. sawmill of one Hazrat Islam
(DW-3)? As per statement of PW-7 the complainant
of this case on the day of occurrence he was present
in the sawmill of Hazrat Islam when at the relevant
time the accused/Appellant Askar Ali came there

duly armed with pistol and without uttering a single

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim.
Fi.

word from his mouth started indiscriminate firing at
his deceased brother. Due to which he was hit on
different parts of his body and died instantaneously.
The occurrence in addition to this PW was stated to
have been witnessed by many other persons present
at the spot. Here for the first time this PW introduced
a specific motive which is stated to be procurement
of 'Batta' (extortion of money through force) by the
present accused/Appellant Askar Khan from the
people of the locality and the deceased Zarsheed
was vociferously opposing this act of the
accused/Appellant, therefore he was done to death.
During cross-examination when this PW _ was
confronted with the fact that he did not advance the
motive at first instance in the First Information
Report, he in an unequivocal terms clearly admitted
that he was not aware of the motive at the time of
lodging of the report and later on the police was
informed in respect of the same. There is no cavil
with this legal proposition that motive by itself is not
a substantive piece of evidence but when a party
specifically claimed certain fact in shape of motive
then it is boundan duty of such party to prove the

same on all counts. In context of the present case, the

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
-8-

complainant who is real brother of the deceased
raised serious allegation in shape of procurement of
extortion money by force locally known as "Bhatta"
by the accused/Appellant then he is under an
obligation to prove the same, otherwise, it would
come under the category of improvement being not
advanced at first instance at the time of lodging of
the First Information Report. When in this regard
evidence of the prosecution is delved deep into not
even a single reference has been found via which an
inference could be drawn that the accused/Appellant
has ever received 'Batta' money from any inhabitant
of the locality and mere assertion at belated stage on
behalf of the complainant being related witness to
the deceased could not be considered as motive in
context of the present case. Thus, it can be said with
certainty that the prosecution on all counts failed to
prove the factum of motive with regard to
procurement of 'Bhatta' by the accused/Appellant.

10. Now coming to the introduction of another
alleged eyewitness of the occurrence Ali Zarshah
(PW-8). This revelation also came into existence in
the cross-examination of PW-7 Israr for the first time

in the following manner:-

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
=9s

SVL soso Lb k tashas pose e SUP 4 a"
sar rp AbSoleL tule S ful ~ZRY
"Bs
It is to be noted that no clue whatsoever of

this important prosecution eyewitness has been
found in the First Information Report, rather this
disclosure has come to surface with considerable
delay. In ordinary parlance how it is possible that the
complainant would forget the name of an eyewitness
being standing with him witnessing the murder of his
real brother. In such like situation as prevailed in the
present guidance can be derived from case law cited
as 2008 SCMR 158 '"' Muhammad Khalid Khan V/S

Abdullah and others", wherein it has been held:-

Testimony of eye-witnesses including the
complainant did not inspire confidence,
who were chance witnesses and they had
not reasonably explained their presence at
the spot at the’ relevant  time---
Complainant though had introduced two
eye-witnesses, yet had produced only one--
-Names of the newly-added eye-witnesses
were mentioned in the F.ILR., which had
been disclosed to the Investigating Officer
after some weeks of the occurrence---Eye-
witnesses being admittedly inimical
towards the accused, unimpeachable
evidence was required to corroborate the
yo, ocular testimony for sustaining
he conviction, which was lacking in the case-
--Said grounds which found favour with
High Court in passing the judgment of
acquittal were neither fanciful nor
conjectural and the same were backed by
the material on record---Crime empties
though secured from the spot were not
even sent to Forensic Science Laboratory
for comparison---Motive also was not
explicit and was rather vague---Leave to

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
-10-

appeal was declined to complainant in
circumstances.

Keeping in sight the above rational in
mind it is basic principle of administration of
criminal justice that if a witness is trustworthy and
reliable then conviction can safely be based on his
evidence but in the eventuality if such witness is
unreliable his evidence cannot be utilized for the
passing of conviction against an accused. At the
same breath, if we look into the testimony of other
alleged eye-witness Ali Zarshah, who has been
introduced by the complainant later on in order to fill
the loop-holes of his case. This PW though deposed
the same story as advanced by the complainant in the
FIR followed by his statement before the Court. Yet
during cross-examination when he was confronted
with his statement recorded under section 164 Cr.
P.C. about mentioning of name of complainant Israr
in his statement who asserted with utmost certainty
that his name has been mentioned in the statement.
Yet when the said statement was observed before the
learned trial Court it did not find mention the name
of complainant. So an inference could be gathered
from such attitude of this alleged eyewitness that

both the PWs (eyewitnesses of the occurrence) might

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan

oe

= Tis

have not seen the occurrence in the mode and
manner as advanced by the prosecution. Especially
when the other important witness of prosecution the
alleged owner of the sawmill Hazrat Islam (DW-3)
did not support the version of prosecution.

11. Likewise, the another eyewitness namely
Behroz though recorded his statement in the previous
proceedings conducted under section 512 Cr. P.C as
PW-6, however during regular trial this important
prosecution witness was abandoned being won over
for reasons best known to the complainant-party.
Thus, it is also settled principle of law that if a best
evidence is available with the party and the said
party fails to produce the same before the Court then
a presumption under Article 129 (g) of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 can be drawn that had the said
evidence been produced before the Court it would
have been unfavourable to the said party. Such

presumption can fairly be drawn in the present case

nee that had PW Behroz (the alleged eyewitness)

produced in the Court he would have not supported
the prosecution case. Non-examination of the
material witnesses has materially affected the

prosecution case. Keeping in sight the same analogy

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Pe We

reliance has been placed on “Lal Khan v/s The

State, reported in 2006 SCMR 1846, wherein it

has been held:-

“non-production of most natural
and material witness of the
occurrence would strongly lead to
an inference of prosecutorial
misconduct, which would not only
be considered a source of undue
advantage for prosecution but
also an act of suppression of
material facts causing prejudice

to accused”

It was further held under the same

judgment in citation (d):-

“Act of withholding of most
natural and a material witness of
occurrence would create an
impression that had such witness
been brought into witness box, he

might not have supported the

prosecution and in such
eventuality the prosecution must
Lo not be in a position to avoid
_
\ consequence”.
12. It is further evident from bare perusal of

the evidence put-forth by the prosecution in respect
of guilt of the accused/Appellant that except the
statement of the complainant Israr PW-7 there is

uncertainty about presence of rest of the eyewitnesses

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
a3

i.e. PW-8 Ali Zarshah being introduced later on as
his name was not mentioned in the FIR by the
complainant and the other alleged eyewitness Behroz
was abandoned during regular trial. So in such
circumstances, sole testimony of brother of the
deceased Israr PW-7 would come under the category
of interested/chance witness. In support of such plea
reliance can safely be placed on PLJ 2012 Cr. C

Lahore) 875 (D.B.) (Multan Bench Multan

"Muhammad Ishfaq_ and others V/S State _and

others". The relevant citation therein speaks of:-

"It is settled principle of criminal
jurisprudence evidence of a witness who was
inimical to the accused and a chance
witness, as matter of caution and for safe
administration of justice cannot be believed
unless corroborated by independent,
unimpeachable and trustworthy source.

'"" Eye-witnesses were interested being
closely related inimical and chance
witnesses, therefore, they could not be
believed without strong corroboration.

"' It is well settled principle that if inimical,

interested witnesses were disbelieved qua

some of accused, they cannot be believed

against other accused without some strong
1» and independent corroboration available on
(bh? record."

If presence of the alleged eyewitnesses
PW-7 Israr complainant/brother of the deceased and
Ali Zarshah PW-8 are ousted then it would be an

unseen occurrence. In such scenario reliance has

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
2 TAs

been placed on 1997 P_ Cr. LJ 2075 "Muhammad
Anwar vs The State", wherein it has been held:-

Appreciation of evidence---Presence of

eye-witnesses at the time and place of
incident had not been established
beyond doubt and the occurrence was
an un-witnessed one. Other
incriminating connected evidence like
strong motive, recovery of blood-stained
dagger and medical evidence, in the
circumstances, could not be collectively
or individually sufficient to form basis
of conviction of accused---Accused was
acquitted on benefit of doubt
accordingly.

At all side by side the veracity of
prosecution witnesses statements are not alone to be
considered for to bring home charges. It is equally
important to appreciate the defence evidence. DW-3
Hazrat Islam has however whisked off the presence
of these prosecution witnesses including the
complainant Israr who had come to Police Station
after abandoned PW Behroz reached the Police
Station much earlier one hour. Had these witnesses
were present on the spot there would have never

been a gap of one hour between the two prosecution

witnesses. In all probabilities the witnesses of the

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
-15-

prosecution who posed to be of ocular account they
themselves exclude each other presence on the spot.

13. There is no need to reiterate this universal
principle of administration of criminal justice that
once the ocular account does not support the version
of prosecution in its totality then there come a turn of
corroborative or circumstantial evidence. In this case
medical evidence has been furnished by PW-1
Dr. Sher Zaman Khan Medical Officer, who has duly
submitted his report as Ex. PM/1. Yet during cross-
examination he deposed that ''the dead _body was

brought to the hospital at 12:45 pm and at the same

time I started examination in presence of police".

When this narration of the concerned Medical
Officer was put in juxta position with the contents of
First Information Report lodged at 13:00 hours on
the same day at Police Station Nawagai wherein the
complainant Israr stated that after shifting of corpus
of his deceased brother to the police station he
reported the matter to the local police. Here the
question arises, that the Medical Officer would have
definitely consumed sufficient length of time on
conducting postmortem examination of corpus of the

deceased then how it is possible that in such a short

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
=16%

span of time the body of deceased was shifted from
the hospital to the police station where as stated
earlier the report was lodged by the complainant in
presence of corpus of his deceased brother at exactly
13:00 hours. Even otherwise, this situation has been
somehow overcome by the complainant Israr PW-7
by deposing during his cross-examination in the

following manner:-

WFP Purves i ged"

Yet there remained uncertainty to some
extent to the effect that the postmortem of the
deceased might have been carried out even before
lodging of the report in the concerned police station.
14. No doubt there is abscondence on the part
of accused/Appellant and even proceedings under
section 512 Cr. P.C. were carried out against him
during his absence. Yet it is almost settled principle
of law that abscondence by itself is not sufficient

eo ~ proof of guilt of an accused it ought to be
corroborated by other supporting evidence, which

element is missing in the present case. In this respect

plea reliance can be placed on 2009 SCMR_ 803

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim.
= IT's

Ld

'"Haji_Paio_ Khan V/S_ Sher Biaz_and_others",

wherein it has been held:-

"Abscondence of accused is a
supporting evidence of his guilt and it
may be consistent with the guilt or
innocence of accused, which is to be
decided keeping in view the overall

Sacts of the case.

Same view has further been affirmed in
case law cited as PLD 2004 Peshawar 20 "' Ali Raza
V/S Fazal Wahid" . The relevant citation (f) of the
Judgment opines:

"" Abscondence is the weakest type of
corroboratory evidence and where the
ocular evidence is disbelieved it alone

cannot form a basis for conviction.

In search of the same analogy reliance can

further be placed on 2012 MLD 1448 (Peshawar) "'
Muhammad _ Ashraf V/S__ Javed _and_another",
wherein it has been held:-

po " When ocular testimony had not been
| ~ considered worthy enough, then the
importance of abscondance of accused
as a corroborative evidence, would be

diminished."

In the case in hand too, where the direct or

ocular-version is not of such caliber to be relied upon

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
er

= 18:

mere abscondence of the accused/Appellant alone
would be of no worth. It is to be noted here that in
this part of the country the people do abscond not
because they have committed an offence but due to
fear of the police coupled with lack of awareness
from law of the land.

15. Whereas the factum of benefit of doubt is
very much clear that if there exist a reasonable
ground to believe that the accused/Appellant has not
participated in the commission of crime then there is
no need of numbers of circumstances to prove the
innocence of accused even a single circumstance
creating reasonable doubt is sufficient for the
acquittal of the accused. In this regard guidance is
derived from the judgment cited as 2015 P Cr.LJ
554 (Peshawar) “ Sahibzada_vs_the State and 2
others”.

16. In the above backdrop, we after
reappraisal of entire evidence are of the firm view
that the prosecution case against the accused/
Appellant has not been proved beyond reasonable
doubt and the judgment of learned trial Court is
based on wrong appreciation of evidence and the law

on the subject. Hence, we accept this appeal and set-

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
= 19s

aside the impugned judgment of conviction rendered
by the learned trial Court. Ergo, the
accused/Appellant is acquitted of the charges leveled
against him. He is in custody and be set free if not
required in any other case.
