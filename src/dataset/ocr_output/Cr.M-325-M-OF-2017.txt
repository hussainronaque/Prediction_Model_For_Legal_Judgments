- to meager amount of Rs. 300/+, Rs. 400/- and

Rs.1,000/- in all such cases approximately.

4. The Murasila \ed to lodging of the |

First Information Report would reveal that the

Khadoo on motorcycle wiren he was alighted.

which, 10 grams were separated fo: chemical
analysis while the rest 1440. grams were sealed
into another pa-cel. Motércycle was taken in
possession and this accused/Petit:oner was

arrested.

5. The quantity even if ‘t is 1450
grams Chars, thc samples sent were found Chars
by the Forensic Science Laboratory report, yet it
is a border line -xase. The Petitioner was refused
bail by the lesrned trial Court mere on the
ground that he was previcus convicl, but at the
time when this bail order was catried-out the

FSL report was-not availa'‘sle‘on the -ecord. The

furnished by the learned AAG. for the State.
There had never been a dressed trial ever
conducted by the Court having jurisdiction The
orders of the learned trial Court were mere
delivered on the basis of pleading the guilt by
the Petitioner which is a practice generally
conducted by Courts to whisk off from lengthy

trials.

6. The Petitioner is entitled to the

. concession of bail. Hence he is asked to furnish

bail bonds in the sum of Rs: 100,000/- (Rupees
one lac) with “wo sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Trial
Court/MOD, who shall ensure that the sureties

are local, reliable and men of means.
