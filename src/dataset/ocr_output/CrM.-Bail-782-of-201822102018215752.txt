SYED MUHAMMAD  ATTIQUE

Accused-petitioner, Muhammad Aslam, after having
been refused bail by the learned lower Court in case
FIR No.179 dated 20.09.2018 under sections 322/427
PPC, Police Station Komila, has approached to this
Court for the same relief by filing the instant bail
petition.

om The allegation against the accused
petitioner, as reveals from the report of Sultan Shah,
complainant is that the accused/petitioner caused
‘Qati-bis-Sabab’ of deceased Sher Ali on 20.09.2018

at 02.00 at night.
Ww

Arguments of the learned counsel for the
partics heard and record perused with their valuable
assistance.

4. Perusal of record would reveal that no
doubt one Sher Ali, driver of Truck No.1734/GLTE
lost his life in the incident, however, in view of
peculiar facts and circumstances of the case,
especially the statement of Muhammad Niaz, second
driver of truck, coupled with affidavit of one of the
legal heir of deceased Sher Ali submitted before the
Court showing his no objection regarding release of
accused/petitioner on bail, the role attributed to him
requires further probe by the learned trial Court
regarding his culpability in the commission of *Qat/-
bis-Sabab’ or otherwise of the deceased, after
recording evidence of the prosecution. Moreover,
punishment provided under section 322 PPC is
payment of Diyat only. It has been observed by this
Court in Mir Aman’s case (2010 YLR 1930) that:-

“The law on the point is silent as to
whether the punishment of ‘Diyat’
would fall under the prohibitory
clause of section 497, Cr.P.C. or
not. At this stage of the case,
without entering into the deep
merits of the case, one cannot be
kept in jail for a matter which still
requires further probe as to whether
it was an offence of ‘Qatl-i-khata’/
fee)

‘Qatl-bis-sabab’ or an intentional

act of the accused. In this view of

the matter, this Court is of the view

that accused charged in such like

situation would be entitled to the

concession of bail under section 497

(2) Cr.P.C on the point of further

inquiry.”
Therefore, at the moment, this Court considers that,
prima facie a case of ‘further inquiry’ into the guilt of
the accused/petitioner is made out, as contemplated in
subsection 2 of section 497 Cr.P.C.
5. The observations rendered hereinabove
being tentative in nature, would not affect the mind of
the trial Court in any manner whatsoever, during trial
of the case.
6. Consequently, this bail application is
accepted, accused-petitioncr, Muhammad Aslam 1s
admitted to bail, subject to his furnishing bail bonds in
the sum of Rs.200,000/- (Rupees two lacs), with two

sureties cach in the like amount, to the satisfaction of

the Ilaga/Duty Judicial Magistrate, Kohistan.
