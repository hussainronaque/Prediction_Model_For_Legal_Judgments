JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT

Cr.Misc./BA. No. 1044-P/2017.

Muhammad Ishaq _vs. The State
JUDGMENT
Date of hearing: 23.6.2017.
Petitioner: (M.Ishaq) by Mr. Daris Khan, advocate.

State by Mian Arshad Ahmad Jan, AAG.

RK

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J. - The petitioner has been
arrested in case FIR No.294 dated 14.4.2017 registered under
Section 489-F PPC at Police Station, Shaheed Gulfat Hussain,
Peshawar for dishonour of thirty cheque amounting to

Rs. 24,00,000/-. He was arrested in the present case on

19.4.2017.
2. Arguments heard and record perused.
3. The learned counsel for the accused/petitioner

contends that the offence does not fall within the ambit of
prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C. and that he is behind
the bar since 14.4.2017, therefore, he is entitled for the
concession of bail. The learned Additional Advocate General
appearing on behalf of the State assisted by the learned
counsel for the complainant contended that the offence in

which the petitioner is charged is non-bailable and that the
accused/petitioner is a habitual offender, therefore, does not
deserve the concession of bail.

4. Perusal of the record reveals that the maximum
punishment provided under section 489-F PPC is three years
or with fine or with both, which does not fall within the
prohibition contained in section 497 Cr.P.C. when the offence
is punishable with imprisonment or with fine or with both, the
accused/petitioner is entitled to be released on bail because, if
at the conclusion of the trial, he is only sentenced with fine,
the period as under trial prisoner due to refusal of bail shall
amount to a case of double jeopardy, thus, keeping in view the
law laid down in case titled “Zafar Iqbal_vs. Anwar_and
others” (2009 SCMR-1488) ordaining that where a case falls
outside the prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C. the
concession of granting bail must be favourably considered and
should only be declined in exceptional cases.

5. For the aforesaid reasons, this petition is
accepted and the accused/petitioner is admitted to bail
provided he furnishes bail bonds to the tune of Rs.3,00,000/-
(Rupees three lac) with two sureties each in the like amount to
the satisfaction of the learned Illaqa/Judicial Magistrate
concerned, who shall ensure that the sureties must be local,

reliable and men of means.
