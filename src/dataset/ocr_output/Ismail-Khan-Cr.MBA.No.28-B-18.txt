Cr.MBA.No.28-B/2018
Ismail Khan alias Ismail ...Vs...The State and another
JUDGMENT
Date of hearing: 15.02.2018
Appellant-petitioner: By Anwar-ul-Hagq, Advocate.
Respondent: State By Shahid Hameed Qureshi.

Addl: AG.

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- Through this petition the
petitioner Ismail Khan alias Ismail has sought post arrest
bail in case FIR No.202 dated 09.6.2017 registered under
Sections 302/34 PPC at Police Station Tajori, District
Lakki Marwat.

2. It is, inter alia, argued by the learned counsel
for the petitioner that the petitioner has falsely been
implicated in the instant case; that the counter version
vide FIR No.203 dated 09.6.2017 under Section 324/34
PPC has been recorded at Police Station Tajori, District
Lakki Marwat against the complainant party, and it is yet
to be determined that who is aggressor and who has been
aggressed upon and who acted in self defence. In support

of his contention he relied on the judgment of this Court

Imran P.S./* (S.B.) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
-2-

in Cr.MBA.No.273-B/2017 rendered in counter FIR
No.203 dated 09.6.2017, wherein the accused Aurangzeb
was granted bail merely on the ground that a counter
version vide FIR No.202 dated 09.6.2017 under Sections
302/34 PPC was registered against the accused party,
therefore, the petitioner is also entitled for bail.

3. On the other hand, the learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the complainant argued that the
petitioner has specifically been charged for committing
murder of the brother of the complainant; that the post-
mortem report supports the contention of the complainant;
that the version recorded vide FIR No.203 cannot be
termed as cross version of the occurrence, the same is
false and concocted one, and cannot be given weight at
this stage; that after commission of the offence the
accused remained at large for quite sufficient time,
therefore, he is not entitled to be released on bail.

4. The learned Addl: A.G. representing the State

supported the contention of the learned counsel for the

complainant.
5. Arguments heard and record perused.
6. Perusal of the record reveals that the petitioner

has specifically been charged in a promptly lodged FIR
for committing murder of the brother of the complainant

by means of firearm. The version of the complainant, site

Imran P.S./* (S.B.) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J

plan and post-mortem report, if placed in a juxtaposition,
the same are consistent, inter alia. The post-mortem report
of the deceased reflects that he had sustained single bullet
injury on the back side of his head in occipital region and
its exit wound on left side of front of face in maxillary
region. After commission of offence the petitioner
remained at large for a period of more than 05 months and
was arrested on 16.11.2017.

7. Adverting to the cross version recorded in FIR
No.203 dated 09.6.2017 registered under Sections 324/34
PPC at Police Station Tajori, District Lakki Marwat, the
mere registration of cross version cannot be accepted as it
is not sufficient for the grant of bail, particularly, when
the genuineness of the cross version is yet to be
established at trial stage. In this respect reference can well
be made on the case reported in 2012 YLR 1761.

8. Moreso, investigation in the case has been
completed and the trial is likely to commence soon. The
tentative assessment of the record suggests that on the
face of it, there exists reasonable ground to believe that
the petitioner has committed the offence which falls
within the prohibition contained in Section 497 Cr.PC.

9. For what has been discussed above, there
being no merit in the petition in hand, it is hereby

dismissed. However, the prosecution is directed to submit

Imran P.S./* (S.B.) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J

challan against the accused within a period of fortnight
and the learned trial Court is directed to conclude the trial
within a period of 04 months positively.

Announced.
