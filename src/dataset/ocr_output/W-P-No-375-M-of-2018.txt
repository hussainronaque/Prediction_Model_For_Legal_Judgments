CONSOLIDATED
JUDGMENT

MOHAMMAD __IBRAHIM__KHAN, _J.-

Through this singled-out judgment, we
propose to decide this writ petition bearing
No. 375-M/2018 as well as the connected writ
petitions bearing Nos. 378-M,379-M,380-
M,381-M,382-M,383 M,384-M,3 85-M,389-
M,390-M,391-M,392-M,393-M,394-M,395-

M,396-M,405-M,406-M,407-M,413-M 414-
M and 425-M of 2018 as common questions
of law and facts are involved in all these

connected writ petitions.

2. Allegations against the
Petitioners in all these connected writ
petitions are that they are involved in selling
of drugs/narcotics being habitual drug
peddlers and indulged in other Anti-State
activities in their respective localities.
Therefore, the learned Deputy Commissioners
concerned of their respective Districts in the
capacity of District Magistrates had issued

their detention orders in exercise of powers

Nawab** | DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan

Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
conferred upon them under Section 3 of the
Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance,
1960, so, as consequence thereof they have
been detained in jail. The Petitioners being
aggrieved have challenged their detention
orders issued by the learned ‘Deputy
Commissioners concerned through these

connected Constitutional petitions.

3. Learned counsel for the
petitioners argued that bogus and frivolous
reports have been furnished to Deputy
Commissioners Dir Upper, Shangla and Swat
by the concerned police of respective Districts
and on its basis the impugned orders have
been issued against the Petitioners without
any rhyme and reason. They further
contented that against majority of the
Petitioners alternate remedies have already
been availed by the local police in shape of
First Information Reports, so their detention
under the Maintenance of Public Order
Ordinance, 1960 is without any legal authority

and the present detention orders of the

Nawabt* | pp: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan

Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
por

Petitioners by the learned District Magistrate
concerned amount to "double jeopardy". They
added that not even an iota of evidence is
available in support of the allegations leveled
against the Petitioners. They argued that
liberty of a citizen is protected and guaranteed
by Constitution of Pakistan which cannot be
curtailed under the garb of 3 M.P.O without
legal justification. Learned counsel concluded
that the impugned orders being against law
and without any legal authority be set aside
and the Petitioners be released from jail with

immediate effect.

4. On the other hand, learned A.A.G
appearing on behalf of the official
Respondents submitted that most of the
Petitioners are drug peddlers/ suppliers and
have remained involved in drug trafficking
which is adversely affecting the young
generation of our society in particular. He
further submitted that Petitioners have
repeatedly been warned by local police to

mend their ways but they are not ready to quit

Nawab** | DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan

Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
these activities, therefore, their detention by
District Magistrate in exercise of their powers
under Section 3 MPO is in accordance with

law.

5. Having heard arguments of
learned counsel for the Petitioners and
learned A.A.G appearing on behalf of the
official Respondents, available record of each
petition was delved deep into with their

valuable assistance.

6. Before delivering any findings in
respect of the issue in question it would be
more appropriate to reproduce section 3 of the
West Pakistan Maintenance of Public Order
Ordinance 1960, on the basis of which the
impugned detention orders of the Petitioners
in all these connected writ petitions have been

issued, it reads:-

" 3. Power_to arrest and detain
por suspected ___ persons. ()
Government, if satisfied that with a
view to preventing any person from
acting in any manner "prejudicial
to public safety or the maintenance
of public order", it is necessary so

Nawab** | DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
to do, may, by an order in writing,
direct the arrest and detention in
such period as may be specified in
the order, and Government, if
satisfied that for the aforesaid
reasons it is necessary so to do,
may, subject to the other
provisions of this section, extend
from time to time the period of
such detention [for a period not

exceeding six months at a time]."

In the light of above-quoted
provision of law the first and foremost reality
of all these connected matters which need to
be clarified that the asservations of the
Respondents that majority of the Petitioners
are involved in drug peddling activities being
suppliers coupled with the fact that they are
indulged in Anti-State activities are not
appealable to prudent mind for simple reason
that there is nothing on record in black &
white in shape of an iota of evidence which
could justify issuance of these detention
orders under Section 3 of the Maintenance of
Public Order Ordinance, 1960. Even
otherwise, the powers bestowed upon the

learned Deputy Commissioners in the

Nawab** | DB: Mr. Justice Mubammad Ghazanfar Khan

Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
capacity of District Magistrates are not
ordinary in nature and on all counts it come
within the category of "special powers". So
before passing order under section 3(1) of
West Pakistan Maintenance of Public Order,
1960, the authority is required to satisfy itself
that the activity of a person directed to be
detained is prejudicial to the society or
maintenance of public order and mere oral
allegation or recommendation of the local
police in shape of letters/reports without any
proof against a person is not sufficient to
make it basis of issuance of detention order

under the above-referred provision of law.

7. We have thoroughly perused the
impugned orders and found that the same have
been rendered by the learned Deputy
Commissioners Dir Upper, Swat and Shangla
without satisfying themselves with regard to
requests of local police and prima facie orders
of detention were passed without considering
the material available before them, which is

against the mandate and spirit of West

Nawab** | DB: Mr, Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan

Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Pakistan Maintenance of Public Order
Ordinance, 1960. Therefore, the impugned

orders are nullity in the eye of law.

8. Apart from above, detention
warrants of the Petitioners before us in
different petitions would divulge that they can
even be prosecuted under the respective laws
enacted for the commission of offences. In
most of the cases the detenues/Petitioners can
be prosecuted under the Control of Narcotic
Substances Act or under the ordinary sections
of law within the purview of Pakistan Penal
Code or for that matter under Anti Terrorism
Act. Now, the law is very much settled that
powers under 3 MPO are to be exercised
where there is imminent apprehension and
that too based on some solid grounds i.e.
when “a person is acting or is about to act in

@_manner prejudicial to public safety or the

maintenance of public order”. In our humble
view, all these connected matters pertain to
different spheres and do not qualify the above

mentioned criteria as envisaged by the ibid

‘Nawab** | DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan

Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
-10-

Ordinance rather as stated earlier, the
detenues/Petitioners can be prosecuted under

the relevant laws.

9. In support of similar ratio
reliance can be placed on an unreported
judgment of this Court decided on 16.01.2018
delivered in W.P No.24-M/2018 titled as

“Suliman Khan Vs. Govt. of KPK and others”

, wherein it has been enunciated:-

“Petitioner has been detained in
jail on the ground that he is
habitually involved in narcotics
related activities which are
adversely affecting the society
especially the young generation of
the area but no evidence in
support of the said allegations is
available before us. Whether the
same allegations can be
considered as a “valid ground”

for detaining a person in exercise

\ wo of powers under Section 3 of the

West Pakistan Maintenance of
Public Order Ordinance, 1960 or
not, is the crucial point which
needs determination by _ this
Court. The expression ‘ground’

has been defined in Black’s Law

Nawab**

DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
-ll-

Dictionary according to which
‘ground’ means ‘a foundation or
basis, points relied upon; for
example ‘ground’ for bringing
civil action or charging criminal
defendant or foundation for
admissibility of evidence. For the
purpose of Section 3 of the
Ordinance, ‘ground’ means
factual constituent of the grounds
on which the subjective
satisfaction of the authority
issuing the detention order is
based. In the present case, the
petitioner has been detained on
the ground that he is a drug
peddler and is not ready to stop
the said activities being harmful
and injurious to the public but
neither any documentary
evidence is available on the case
file to this effect nor the learned
A.A.G. could assist this Court
that what is the specification of
the charge against him and in
what manner the local police
warned him to give up the
narcotic related activities or
other bad habits. In our view,
mere allegations against the

petitioner regarding his

‘Nawab** | DB:

Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
-12-

involvement in drugs promotion
in the area without supportive
evidence or proof is not a valid
ground for issuance of an order
against him under Section 3 of

the Ordinance ibid.
10. It must be inculcated in an
unequivocal terms that detention order
tentamounts to curtailing fundamental rights
of liberty of a citizen guaranteed by the
Constitution and perhaps due to this reason
the legislature in their know-how vested such
powers with the Deputy Commissioners who
are expected to be unbiased as compared to
the police agency and in this way the Deputy
Commissioners are not supposed to react on
the report of the police agency until and
unless they satisfy themselves about the
correctness of the same and are supported by

tangible material.

11. Last but not the least, it would be
in the fitness of things to give reference of
this Court consolidated judgment dated
22.01.2018 rendered in W.P. No. 37-M of

2018 titled "Muhammad Imad V/S_ Govt: of

Nawab** | DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan

Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
-13-

KPK & others", wherein on the basis same
rational as highlighted above seventeen (17)
connected writ petitions have been accepted
accordingly. Para 7 of the ibid judgment

speaks of:-

"Detention warrants of the
petitioners before us in different
petitions would show that they
can be prosecuted under the
respective laws enacted for the
commission of offences. In most
of the cases the detenues can be
prosecuted under the Control of
Narcotic Substances Act, Forest
Act as well as under Prohibition
of Hadd Order, 1979. Now the
law is settled that powers under 3
MPO are to be exercised where
there is imminent apprehension
and that too based on some solid
grounds i.e when “a person is
acting or is about to act in a
manner prejudicial to public
we? — safety or the maintenance of
public order”. In our view, all
these cases do not qualify the
above mentioned criteria as
provided by the ibid Ordinance

rather, as discussed above, the

Nawab** | DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
ot

pll®

-14-

detenues can be prosecuted under

the relevant laws."

12. In the above backdrop, we are
of the unanimous view that the impugned
orders have been rendered without lawful
authority, therefore, upon acceptance of all
these Constitutional petitions, _ the
impugned orders are set aside and the
Petitioners of all these connected matters
be released from jail forthwith if not

required in any other case.
