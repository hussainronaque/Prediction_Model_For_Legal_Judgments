high rate of return and thereby deprived innocent people from
their hard earned money. Similarly, petitioner Waseem Zeb Khan
has been arrested on 20.05.2021 by the NAB authorities on the

“Numeera Pink.SEC
Oct 7, 2020

Asslam-o-Alaikum,

I hereby inform you that a website was launched at oct
2019 and they were collecting funds from local peoples
and offering them upto 21% profit monthly. They were
taking funds from Public as they are registered in SECP
under the name SPACE CONSTRUCTION SMC
PRIVATE LIMITED and people invested upto 2 Billion
PKR just in one year. Now these guys are using one more
company namely PSLASH, they are saying that it’s our
second company. I am afraid as they are also getting
documents from the public such as CNIC/Passport and the
latest utility bills or bank statements. May be these
documents they are using in SECP. I have attached
screenshots and their official pages and websites which
they are using for “Looting” Pakistani people. One of our
resources confirms this website is running by Muhammad
Taimoor s/o Fazal Elahi (12101-4114318-5) or Afnan
Malik. He has 2 passports under both names, so I request
Writ Petition No.2658-P/2021

you to check this matter instantly and take proper action to
save our Pakistani Public............... This software
company Ashlar running all of its illegal businesses
software by sources we acknowledged that they are
partner as well. I have also submitted this complaint to
FIA and cyber police.

It was reported to National Accountability Bureau (NAB)

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that owners/management of online website,

namely, M/S www.pslashuk.com has cheated the public at large
on the pretext of investment in the said company under the guise
of high rate of monthly returns. The NAB authorities taking
cognizance of the matter authorized an inquiry on 01.02.2021,
which on confirmation of the allegations, was converted into
investigation on 15.06.2021. During investigation it was unearth
that in the year 2019, the petitioner Muhammad Taimur through a
fake female face-book ID, namely, Rabia Batool, approached and
lured the general public to invest money in the aforesaid online

business. The name of the website was www.earnbitcoin.com

which, later on, was converted into www.offerslash.com then to

www.payslashuk.com and finally www.pslashuk.com. The

investors were also lured to promote the said business and
convince other people for investment so as to generate more
investments under their account, hence, forming a tree/pyramid.
In this way thousands of people invested millions of rupees in the

aforesaid fake online business. During investigation, mobile

phones, having SIM No.0315-6488013 was recovered from
possession of petitioner Muhammad Taimur and during
interrogation Binance Apps was opened with a code applied by
the petitioner himself where two email IDs, with user names
Rabiabatool 123@gmail.com and Afnan Malik

123098@gmail.com were found, verification codes of which

were also opened by the petitioner and the same were found
already signed-in in the said cell phone. Access to the message
inbox was also made wherefrom pictures of two gmail

accounts Le. Rabiabatool123098@gmail.com and

afnanmalik123098@gmail.com were procured by the I.O. and

placed on file. On opening of the said Binance Apps its deposit
ID was noted as 0x371419690871d7046e9022b16562ee6eb98da9b,
picture of which was also procured by the I.O.. Similarly, pictures
of deposit and withdrawal Binance account having history of
transactions since 02.10.2019 to 22.04.2021 and 28.10.2019 to
02.05.2021, respectively, has also been placed on file. The
Banking App of Meezan and UBL already installed in the mobile
of the petitioner Muhammad Taimoor was also opened which
revealed accounts having title Muhammad Taimur A/C. Nos.
26010103655784 at D.I. Khan Branch and 02080104678208 at
DHA Phase-IV, Branch Lahore. Transactions history along with

Another Mobile Model Samsung, having IMEI.
Writ Petition No.2658-P/2021

352682/50/349217/4, shown recovered from possession of
petitioner Muhammad Taimoor, was having Biance ID with user

name afnanmalik123098@gmail.com. Its deposit ID was noted as

0x09¢35ff3e205£22953f8c1 15d42b6148cf3975d81. The deposit
and withdrawal history of transactions since 17.09.2019 to
14.11.2020 and 30.09.2019 to 24.05.2021, respectively, has also
been placed on file. The documentary evidence gathered by the
Investigation Officer and as discussed above, prima facie show
petitioner Muhammad Taimur to be the owner of the aforesaid
fake IDs. One Muhammad Muzammal Ikram has been examined
under section 164 Cr.P.C., wherein he has stated that in
September 2020, one of his friend namely, Ahmad Nazir asked
him for working with him in a project/website of Muhammad
Taimur alias Afnan Malik regarding its debugging/improvement
and it was decided that he will be paid Rs.40000/- per month as

salary. The name of the website was www.payslashuk.com which

was later on changed to www.pslashuk.com. Petitioner

Muhammad Taimur used to give him task on daily basis
regarding debugging in the website usually through his whatsapp
number i.e. 0347-8787873 and he used to make necessary
changes in the website live on the said server. He stated that he
worked with petitioner Muhammad Taimur on his website

www.pslashuk.com for two months only. Ahmad Nair has also

recorded statement under section 164 Cr.P.C. wherein he has
categorically stated that he worked for petitioner Muhammad

Taimur for his website, namely, www.payslashuk.com and

Writ Petition No.2658-P/2021

www.pslashuk.com in lieu of salary worth Rs.80,000/- per

month. On tentative assessment of the material on record, as
discussed above, the aforesaid IDs/website prima facie seems to
be that of petitioner Muhammad Taimur. It is manifest from
record, most particularly, from recovery memo of cell phones that
the passwords of the two gmail accounts and binance IDs are still
in possession of the petitioner and only he can operate the mail
and accounts from his binance IDs. In case of his release on bail
he will not only diminish all the evidence collected by the NAB
but also turned the tide of hopes of numerous affectees. Yet there
is another aspect of the case that petitioner Muhammad Taimur
and his wife have invested a significant amount in Turkey, where
they have been allowed residence permit under the “Investor
Citizenship Program”. Needless to mention that the minimum
amount required for residence permit at Turkey is to invest 5 lac
US dollars for three years in a Turkish Bank along with a fixed
assets investment listed by Ministry of Industry of Turkish
Government. Nothing is available on file to show the money trail
of the amount invested by petitioner in the Turkey.

5. Record divulges that initially complaint was registered on
24.08.2020 with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) by one
Salman against petitioner Waseem Zeb under the allegation that
the complainant has invested an amount of rupees sixty one lac
fifty thousand in  an_ online business Company

(www.pslashuk.com) but after sometimes the website was shut

down whereas its CEO Waseem Zeb was front man of the fake
Writ Petition No.2658-P/2021

online Company Rabibatool. The FIA could not move forward
and the case was closed for lack of evidence. Subsequently,
complaints from different investors poured. Second complaint
was filed with PTA in September 2020, but both the Agencies
could not save a large number of victims. Petitioner Waseem Zeb
posing himself as a CEO of the said fake Company fully
facilitated co-accused Muhammad Taimur in raising significant
funds by depriving unsuspected real estate, digital and foreign
currency investors under the guise returning profit at a high rate.
In the month of November, the Company Account went off-line
and a notification reading as “System is hacked” was posted
instead. According to prosecution the company thrice changed its
name i.e. from Bitcoin to Payslash and lastly to Pslash. During
investigation sufficient documentary evidence has been collected
by the I.O. against petitioner Waseem Zeb which shows that he

joined www.palashuk.com in September 2019 as an investor and

then managed to attract large number of users for investments in
the said scam and got higher ranks in the company due to huge
investments under his down line. Record depicts that he is the
only person who was able to achieve the rank of senior Director
in the fake company with investment of Rs.2000 million under
his down line.

6. Sufficient documentary evidence has been brought on
record by the I.O. which prima facie show petitioner
Muhammad Taimur as master mind of the mega scam,

who is the creator/owner of website, namely,
Writ Petition No.2658-P/2021

www.earnbitcoin.com,www.offerslash.com, | www.paysalashuk.com

and www.pslashuk.com and that he with the connivance and
collusion of co-accused Waseem Zeb Khan, induced innocent
people for investment in the fake company and thereby deprived
them from their hard earned money worth rupees millions. Both
the petitioners are prima facie connected with the commission of
offence, hence, they are not entitled to the concession of bail.

7. Accordingly, this and the connected Writ Petition
No.2622-P/2021, titled, “Waseem Zeb Khan vs NAB”, being
meritless are hereby dismissed.
