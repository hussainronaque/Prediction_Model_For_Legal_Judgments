brothers were residing with his father Sultanat
Khan (appellant) in the same house. There was
a dispute over the residential house and other
property between the father and sons. The
complainant had erected walls of under

alleged that on the night before the occurrence
the appellant demolished the wall of the cattle-
shed and at the morning of the day of
occurrence when the complainant and his wife
Mst. Rahat Bibi (deceased) saw the
demolished wall the former asked the
appellant that why he had done so on which
the appellant got enraged, picked up the
Kalashnikov and fired at both of them as a
result the complainant sustained injury on his
right shoulder whereas Mst. Rahat Bibi was
hit on different parts of her body and died on
the spot. The occurrence was stated to have
been witnessed by his brother Shabir Ahmad
and other neighbours. A dispute over the
property was mentioned as motive of the

occurrence.

3. S.H.O Habib Shah Khan (PW-7)
recorded the report in shape of Murasila
Ex.PA/1 and sent the same to police station as
special report on the basis of which
Muhammad Hassan No. 65 (PW-3) registered
formal F.I.R (Ex.PA). The S.H.O prepared the
inquest report Ex.PW-7/2 and injury sheets
Ex.PW-7/1 and Ex.PW-7/3 of the deceased
and injured complainant respectively. The
injured was medically examined by Dr. Bahr-
e-Karam S.M.O (PW-2) on the same day at

with the following observations.

“A minor bleeding wound situated on
right shoulder. The bullet tangentially
passed over right shoulder and the
differentiation between entry and exit
wound is not possible. The burnt skin
around the wounds indicates that the
wound is caused by bullet. Simple
FAY”,

Similarly, post-mortem on the
deceased was conducted by Lady Dr. Noon

regard have been placed on record as Ex.PK

and Ex.PZ.

6. The appellant was formally
arrested in injured condition on 21.10.2014
while he was brought back from Abbotabad

Medical Complex. It is noteworthy that he had
SB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

(JCr.A No. 233-M of 2016 Sultanat Khan Vs. The State and one other)
Tajamul/Ps*

also lodged a report on 20.10.2014 which was
recorded vide Daily Diary No. 11 on the same
day which is available on record as Ex.PW-
7/5 whereas his injury sheet is Ex.PW-7/7

with report of the doctor who examined him.

Zz After completion of
investigation, challan was submitted in Court
where the appellant was tried in due course.
After recording of prosecution evidence, the
appellant was examined under Section 342,
Cr.P.C wherein he pleaded innocence and
denied all the allegations leveled against him
by prosecution, however, he did not wish
either to produce evidence in his defence or
record his statement on oath. At conclusion of
the trial, the learned trial Court found the
appellant guilty of the charge and vide
judgment dated 12.11.2016 sentenced him in
the manner already mentioned in Para-1 of
this Judgment. Hence, this appeal.

8. Learned counsel or the appellant,

inter alia, contended that according to the

medical report charring marks were present on

SB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr, Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

(JCr.A No. 233-M of 2016 Sultanat Khan Vs. The State and one other)
TejamulPs*

the body of the deceased who was shown at a
distance of 16 feet from the appellant in the
site-plan, therefore, the tattooing marks on the
deceased as a result of firing of the appellant
from such a long distance were not possible.
He continued that in fact the deceased was hit
by firing of her husband who was present very
close to her i.e at distance of 3 feet per site-
plan but this vital aspect of the case has not
been considered by the learned trial Court. He
next argued that there is no convincing and
independent evidence against the appellant to
connect him with the offences. He further
argued that the statements of PWs, the site-
plan and medical report are contradictory inter
se on material points which have made the
prosecution case doubtful but this aspect of
the case got no attention of the learned trial
Court. He maintained that nothing
incriminating has been recovered from
possession of the appellant and the alleged
recovery of the crime weapon has been
effected from the house wherein the appellant

and his sons were jointly residing, therefore,

SB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr, Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim

(JCr.A No. 233-M of 2016 Suitanat Khan Vs. The State and one other)
‘Tajamul/PS*

the same was wrongly attributed to the
appellant, as such, this piece of evidence has
no evidentiary value. Learned counsel added
the appellant also lodged a report vide Madd
No. 11 dated 20.10.2014 wherein he charged
his sons including the complainant and two
other persons for causing him injuries. He
argued that the learned trial Court ignored this
aspect of the case while awarding capital
punishment to the appellant. Learned counsel
concluded that the impugned judgment is
against the law and evidence on record,
therefore, needs to be set aside and outright
acquittal be granted to the appellant in the

interest of justice.

9. As against that learned A.A.G.
vehemently supported the impugned
conviction and sentence and contended that
the direct as well circumstantial evidence
available on the record against the appellant is
trustworthy and reliable which proves the guilt
of the appellant beyond any doubt. He further
contended that the learned trial Court has

appreciated the prosecution evidence

-10-

according to the settled principles leaving no
room for interference by this Court, therefore,
the judgment of the trial Court be maintained
and this appeal be dismissed. It is pertinent to
mention that complainant is present before the
Court and he had already appeared before the
learned Additional Registrar of this Court on
04.05.2017 and did not wish to engage a
private counsel rather relied upon the

arguments of learned A.A.G.

10. We have considered _ the
submissions of learned counsel for the
appellant and learned A.A.G. and gone
through the record in light of their valuable

assistance.

il. Admittedly, the appellant and
complainant are father and son inter se while
the deceased is wife of the complainant. After
the death of the complainant’s mother, the
appellant remarried and from then onward the
relations between the issues of the first wife
and appellant became strained. On the night

before the day of occurrence, as narrated by

complainant, the wall of his cattle-shed was
demolished by the appellant which resulted
into the present tragedy. The submissions of
learned counsel for the appellant with regard
to tattooing marks on the body of deceased
and injured in view of the site-plan, would be
immaterial in circumstances of the case as the
relation between the parties is such that the
contradictions in medical evidence and ocular
account are of no benefit to the appellant and
that’s too for securing his acquittal. The
complainant has himself sustained injuries in
the same occurrence and his presence on the
place of occurrence at the relevant time is very
much established because both the parties
were residing in the same crime house. The
venue of occurrence and even the motive is
admitted, so, we cannot subscribe to the
submissions of learned counsel that the

appellant is entitled to his outright acquittal.

12. The main question before this
Court is what would be the proper sentence in
the circumstances of the case when the

appellant also lodged a report vide Daily

Diary No. 11 dated 20.10.2014 (Ex.PW-7/6)
when he was arrested and was also medically
examined and certain blunt injuries were
found on his body sustained by him in the
same occurrence. Moreso, the conduct of the
appellant is also considerable as after the
occurrence he was present in his house and
when the police came his report was recorded
and he was referred for medical treatment. The
complainant party has suppressed the injuries
sustained by the appellant and so is the Madd
report (Ex.PW-7/6) of the appellant which is
also silent about the casualties of the other
side. Above are the crucial facts and
circumstances of the case compelling us to
reconsider conviction of the appellant under
Section 302(b) P.P.C as well as the quantum
of sentence awarded to him by the learned trial
Court. The question whether conviction of the
appellant under Section 302(b) P.P.C in the
attending circumstances of the case is legally
correct or not, before making any discussion
on the point, let Section 302 P.P.C be

replicated for the sake of convenience.

“302. Punishment of  qatll-i-amd.
Whoever commits atl-i-amd shall,
subject to the provisions of this Chapter
be;

(a) Punished with death as gisas;

(b) Punished with death or imprisonment
for life as ta’zir having regard to the
facts and circumstances of the case, if
the proof in either of the forms
specified in section 304 is not
available; or

(c) Punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may
extend to twenty-five years, where
according to the injunctions of Islam
the punishment of gisas is not
applicable”.

Adverting to the question that
what would be the proper sentence that should
be awarded to the appellant in light of the
above provisions and keeping in view the
circumstances of the ‘occurrence. It is upto the
Courts to consider on case to case basis as to
which of the three clauses under Section 302
P.P.C is applicable in view of the
circumstances forming background of the
offence. The question under consideration
herein for the first time arose before the
Hon’ble apex Court in the case titled “The
State V/s. Muhammad Hanif and 05 others”
(1992 SCMR 2047), the question so devised

for resolution was as under.

SB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

(JCr.A No. 233-M of 2016 Suitanat Khan Vs. The State and one other)
-14-

“whether the requirement of section
302(c), P.P.C. has to be proved by the
prosecution as a _ requirement of
substantive law or has to be proved by
the accused as an Exception?”

The apex Court while making
discussion in the context of the above question

observed that:

“The exact words of section 302, P.P.C.
make it clear that there is no Exception
provided therein. What is provided is a
substantive law and the prosecution
has to prove every part of it i.e,
whether it is a ‘Qatl-i-amd' liable to
Qisas, whether it is “Qatl-i-amd' not
liable to Qisas, or whether it is Qatl-i
amd liable to Ta'zir-------- Muhammad
Hanif has taken the plea of grave and
sudden provocation which is not
available to him now as section 300,
P.P.C. has been substituted by a new
section 300, P.P.C. and the exceptions
contained in the old section have been
deleted. The definition of Qatl e-i-Amd
has been given in the new section 300,
P.P.C. Any how it serves as a
mitigating circumstance in favour of
Muhammad Hanif. Another fact that
he has taken revenge of the murder of
his brother Khurshid is also an
extenuating circumstance which goes
in his favour. I find Muhammad Hanif
guilty under section 302(c), P.P.C. and
award him ten years' rigorous
imprisonment. Muhammad Hanif
accused is also directed to pay.
Rs.25,000 as Arsh to the heirs of the
deceased, in default of the payment of
the said amount, he shall further
undergo rigorous imprisonment for
two years."

The Hon’ble apex Court, while

deciding a case containing the same issue,

TajamuvPs* SB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan

(JCr.A No. 233-M of 2016 Suitanat Khan Vs. The State and one other)
TajamuyPs*

-15-

rendered another judgment in the case titled

“Ali Muhammad V_Ali Muhammad and another”

(PLD _1996_ SC 274) and held that the

exceptions available under the repealed

chapter are now to be dealt with under Section
302 (c) PPC. The relevant para of the

judgment is replicated for convinience:-

“But keeping in view the majority view
in Gul Hassan case PLD 1989 SC 633,
there should be no doubt that the cases
covered by the exceptions to the old
section 300 PPC read with the old
section 304 thereof, are cases which
were intended to be dealt with under
clause (c) of the new section 302 of the
P.P.C”,

In the case titled “Azmat Ullah
Vis. The State” (2014 SCMR 1178) the august

Supreme Court discussed the exceptions to the
erstwhile Section 300 PPC and observed as

under:-

“Leave to appeal had been granted in
this case to consider as to whether the
circumstances of this case attract the
provisions of Section 302(b) PPC or of
section 302(c) PPC. A bare perusal of
the F.LR., the statements made by the
eye-witnesses before the learned trial
Court and the findings recorded by the
learned Courts below clearly show that
there was no background of any ill-will
or bitterness between the appellant and
his deceased brother and that the
incident in issue had erupted all of a
sudden without any premeditation
whatsoever. The medical evidence

SB: Mr, Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr, Justice tshtiag Ibrahim

(JCr.A No. 233-M of 2016 Suitanat Khan Vs. The State and one other)
TajamuvPs*

-16-

shows that the deceased had received
one blow of a churri on his chest
whereas another blow was received by
him on the outer aspect of his left
upper arm. The doctor conducting the
post-mortem of the dead body had
categorically observed that both the
injuries found on the dead body of the
deceased could be a result of one blow
of churri. These factors of the case
squarely attract Exception 4 contained
in the erstwhile provisions of Section
300, P.P.C. It has already been held by
this Court in the case of Ali
Muhammad V. Ali Muhammad and
another (PLD 1996 SC 274) that the
cases falling in the exceptions
contained in the erstwhile provisions of
section 300, PPC now, attract the
provisions of section 302(c), P.P.C”.

13. No doubt, the appellant has not
taken the plea of self defence neither in his
Madd report nor in his statement under
Section 342, Cr.P.C but it is by now settled
that if an accused have not specifically taken
the plea of self-defence but the circumstance
of the case and the prosecution evidence
suggest that the accused has acted in his self-
defence, its benefit can be extended to him.
The record transpires that the appellant
sustained multiple injuries mostly on his head
in the same occurrence. He was medically
examined by doctor and even he reported the

matter to local police vide Madd No. 11. The

SB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan

-17-

stamps of injuries on the person of the
appellant who being alone at the relevant time
in rivalry of his sons and the factor of
suppression of real facts of the occurrence by
both the sides are the circumstances
suggesting the act of firing by the appellant to
have been committed in exercise of his
defence the benefit of which can be extended
to him irrespective of the fact that he did not
Specifically take that plea during trial.
Reliance is placed on “Ghulam Farid V/s. The
State” (2009 SCMR 929) wherein it has been

held that:-

“The appellant did not raise this plea
during trial either in his statement
under section 342, Cr.P.C. or at the
time when the prosecution witnesses
were subjected to cross-examination.
There is no bar to raise such plea
despite having not taken the said plea
specifically during trial and the Court
can infer the same from the evidence
led during trial if the same is tenable.
However, to justify such an inference
in favour of the accused who stands
convicted on a murder charge and
sentenced to death, his conduct during
the occurrence should fall within the
parameters of right of private defence
as codified in the Pakistan Penal
Code”.

In the case titled “Munshi Ram

and _ others V/s. Delhi_Administration” (AIR

SB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr, Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

(JGr.A No. 233-M of 2016 Sultanat Khan Vs. The State and one other)
TajamulPs*

-18-

1968 SC 702), the question whether an
accused can get benefit of the circumstances
showing that he acted in his defence though he
did not take that plea specifically, the

Supreme Court of India held that:-

“It is well-settled that even if an
accused does not plead self-defence, it
is open to the court to consider such a
plea if the same arises from the
material on record ------. The burden of
establishing that plea is on the accused
and that burden can be discharged
by showing preponderance of
probabilities in favour of that plea on
the basis of the material on record”.

The same view was followed in the

case tiled “Gottipulla_ Venkata Siva
Subrayanam_& ors vs. State of Andhra
Pradesh_& anr” (AIR 1970 SC_1079) and
certain leading principles were laid down
during elaborate discussion on the point of
private defence. The relevant part of the
judgment is as under:-

“The fact that the plea of self-defence
was not raised by accused No. 10 and
that he had on the contrary pleaded
alibi does not in our view, preclude the
Court from giving to him the benefit of
the right of private defence, if, on
proper appraisal of the evidence and
other relevant material on the record,
the Court concludes that the
circumstances in which he found
himself at the relevant time gave him
the right to use his gun in exercise of

SB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr, Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

(JCr.A No, 233-M of 2016 Sultanat Khan Vs. The State and one other)
TajamuPs*

-19-

this right. When there is evidence
proving that a person accused of killing
or injuring another acted in the
exercise of the right of private defence
the Court would not be justified in
ignoring that evidence and convicting
the accused merely because the latter
has set up a defence of alibi and set
forth a plea different from the right of
private defence. The analogy of
estoppel or of the technical rules of
civil pleadings is, in cases like the
present, inappropriate and the Courts
are expected to administer the law of
private defence in a practical way with
reasonable liberality so as to effectuate
its underlying object, bearing in mind
that the essential basic character of this
right is preventive and _ not
retributive”.

14. We are conscious of the fact that
though the appellant acted in his defence but
has exceeded than what was required for his
defence. This fact is evident from medico-
legal reports of both the deceased and injured
complainant according to which the
complainant received one bullet on his
shoulder whereas the deceased sustained
multiple firearm injuries on her body. In the
opinion of this Court, the act of firing by the
appellant in his defence, discernible from
circumstances of the case, as well as the
relationship between the parties are the factors
which can be considered for conviction of the

appellant under section 302(c) P.P.C instead

of Section 302(b) P.P.C but since he has
exceeded his right of self-defence, therefore,
in our view the sentence of 14 years will meet
the ends of justice in the circumstances of the

case.

15. For what has been discussed
above, this appeal is partially allowed, the
impugned judgment dated 12.11.2016
rendered by the learned Sessions Judge/Zilla
Qazi, Shangla Camp Court at Swat, in case
FIR No. 424 dated 20.10.2014 under
