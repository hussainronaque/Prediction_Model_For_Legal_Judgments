All the sentences were ordered to run concurrently.
Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C was extended to the appellants.
2. The legal heirs of both the deceased moved Cr.R.
No.09-B/2019 for enhancement of sentence, whereas Cr.A.
No.35-B/2019 has been filed against acquittal of co-accused.
Since all the matters are the outcome of one and the same
judgment, therefore, we intend to decide the same through this
common judgment.
3. Brief facts of the case as divulged from the FIR,
registered on the basis of murasila, are that on 24.11.2015 at
18:30 hours, the complainant Asmat Ullah (PW-6), in injured
condition, reported the matter at civil hospital, Bannu to the
local police to the effect that on the eventful day he alongwith
son Sifatullah and other relatives, PW Waqif Khan, Abdullah
Noor, Asad Yar, Mujeeb (deceased) and Naqib Ullah Khan
(deceased), after offering Maghrib prayer in the village Masjid,
were proceeding to their houses, when they reached near the
house of accused Farzand Ali, it was at about 17:30 hours, there
accused Yousaf Ali, Farzand Ali, absconding co-accused Rifat
Ullah & Taimoor Khan, armed with Kalashnikovs, whereas

absconding co-accused Suleman and Roman, armed with pistol
-4-
and Kalakov, on the conspiracy of accused Rukhsar Ali,
launched murderous assault on the complainant party by firing at
them with their respective weapons, as a result of firing of all the
accused, the complainant, Sifatullah, Wagif, Abdullah Noor,
Asad Yar, Mujeeb Khan and Naqibullah Khan sustained firearm
injuries, while Mujeeb Khan and Naqibullah succumbed to their
injuries on the spot. Accused decamped from the spot towards
their houses where they made firing as a result of which one of
their own companions was hit. Complainant party could do
nothing being empty handed. Motive for the occurrence was
stated to be a dispute over landed property, hence, the F.I.R ibid.
4. After completion of investigation, prosecution
submitted challan against the accused; Farzand Ali, Yousaf Ali
and Rukhsar Ali, whereas rest of the accused remained fugitive
from law and after recording statement of SW, they were
declared as Proclaimed Offenders and perpetual non-bailable
warrants against Rifatullah, Suliman, Roman & Taimoor Khan
were issued. At the commencement of trial, the prosecution
produced and examined as many as eleven witnesses,
whereafter, the accused were examined under section 342
Cr.P.C, wherein they professed innocence and false implication,
however, neither they opted to be examined on oath as provided
under section 340(2) Cr.P.C, nor produced defence evidence.

After hearing arguments, the learned trial Court vide impugned
-5-
judgment dated 11.02.2019, convicted the accused/appellants
and sentenced them, as mentioned above, whereas accused
Rukhsar Ali was acquitted of the charges. Hence, the instant

criminal appeal and the connected criminal revision.

5. We have heard learned counsel for the appellants,
the learned A.A.G for the State assisted by learned counsel for
the complainant at length and with their valuable assistance, the

record was gone through.

6. The appellants after their arrest faced trial before
the learned trial Court and on conclusion of the trial, they were
convicted and sentenced as mentioned above. There is no denial
of the fact that the learned trial Court dealt with the matter
comprehensively and after applying its judicial mind to the
collected evidence, convicted the appellants. True, that the
learned trial Judge took pain to appreciate the available record
but this Court is too under the obligation to re-assess the already
assessed evidence and to see; as to whether the findings given by
the learned trial Court were substantial to convict the appellants
and as to whether the reasons advanced for awarding sentence
are fully justified. This being the Court of appeal is under
obligation to apply much care and caution, so that, miscarriage
of justice could be avoided. True that in the incident two persons

lost their lives, whereas five got injured, but equally true that it is
-6-
not the number of casualties, to play a decisive role in convicting
the appellants, rather these are the witnesses and their veracity
which is of prime importance, more particularly, in a case if
proved the award would be capital punishment, and when life
and liberty of the citizens are involved then extra care is needed,
as a hasty approach will help to convict the innocent and acquit

the guilty.

7. The incident occurred when the complainant and
others after performing their Maghrib prayer reached near the
house of one Farzand Ali, the accused who were already present
duly armed started firing at them which resulted into injuries on
witnesses and death of the deceased. The deceased then injured
were hurriedly shifted to the hospital where the matter was
reported to the local police who reached to the hospital after
arrival of the dead-bodies and the injured. After drafting
murasila the injury sheets and inquest reports of the injured as
well as the deceased were prepared, whereafter dead-bodies were
sent to the doctor for postmortem examination. The injured were
referred to the doctor for medical examination, who were
examined and their medico legal certificates were prepared. The
Investigating Officer, after receiving copy of the F.I.R, reached
to the spot at 08:30 PM and on pointation of one Inam Ullah,

prepared the site plan. Blood-stained earth was collected from
-7-
places of the deceased and the injured witnesses and also 51
empties of different bores alongwith two spent bullets were taken
into possession. The recovered empties were sent to the Firearms
Expert in order to ascertain as to whether those were fired from
one or different weapons. The report was received in positive
mentioning the same were fired from different weapons. On the
day of incident, one of the appellant namely Yousaf Ali was
arrested from his house in injured condition, who was examined
by the doctor and his physical custody was requested from the
Court of Judicial Magistrate, which was granted and it was on
the following day of the incident when he led the police party to
his house who recovered a Kalashnikov on his pointation. It is
pertinent to mention that the Kalashnikov taken into possession
from the house of the appellant was sent to the Firearms Expert
alongwith the collected empties. The report was received in
positive where seven out of the collected empties matched with

the weapon.

8. The moot question to be determined is as to
whether the witnesses were present at the time of incident and
that the incident occurred in the mode, manner and at the stated
time. Yes, in the incident five received injuries whereas two lost
their lives, but it is not the number of casualties to determine fate

of the accused charged, rather the Courts of law must walk ahead
-8-
to ascertain as to whether the incident occurred as was portrayed
and as to whether the number of accused was not exaggerated. In
the episode as many as six accused are charged, whereas in all
seven injures are inflicted on the dead bodies of the deceased as
well as the injured witnesses. This Court is to see and the
prosecution is to establish that all the accused had a common
interest in the episode and that they attracted to the spot after
making preparation for the purpose. The complainant was
examined as PW-6, who stated that after performing Maghrib
prayer when they reached near the house of appellant Farzand
Ali, the accused including the appellants were present duly
armed, who fired at them which resulted into injuries on bodies
of the injured witnesses and into the death of the deceased. He
further stated that after receiving firearm injury he took shelter in
a nearby house whereas the people of locality arranged vehicles
and the dead bodies alongwith the injured were shifted to the
hospital. The complainant is to establish his presence on the spot
and so the eyewitness. The site plan depicts that soon after
receiving firearm injuries, the complainant took shelter in a
nearby street where the Investigating Officer observed blood on
the wall just behind the complainant. The report was made at
18:30 hours in the hospital, whereas the incident occurred at
17:30 hours. It is important to note that the doctor, who

examined the injured while preparing their medico legal
-9-
certificates, mentioned the time of examination as 6:03 PM. The
scribe was examined as PW-3, who stated that on receiving
information, he alongwith others reached to the hospital where
the dead bodies and injured had already arrived. He further stated
that on his arrival to the hospital the matter was reported by the
complainant, whereafter, the injury sheets and inquest reports
were prepared and under the escort of PW-3, the injured were
shifted to the doctor for their medical examination. PW-3 was
examined, who stated that he alongwith the scribe was on gasht
when at 6:10 PM, they received information, after receiving
information they rushed to the hospital where the complainant
reported the matter and after doing the needful he accompanied
the injured to the doctor for medical examination. We are
surprised to note that on one hand, the information was received
at 6:10 PM, whereas on the other the doctor examined the
injured at 6:03 PM, when the matter by then had not been
reported. True that in case of injured witnesses the prime duty is
to save their lives on priority instead of waiting for arrival of the
concerned police official to report, but as in the instant case it
was the scribe who stated that first the matter was reported in the
shape of murasila, thereafter, he prepared the injury sheets and
inquest reports followed by shifting the injured to the doctor for
their medical examination. If we go with what the scribe

submitted, then all the three i.e. the complainant, scribe and the
-10-
doctor do not support one another on this particular aspect of the
case. The doctor who conducted autopsy on the dead body of the
deceased was examined as PW-1, who confirmed that one of the
deceased was examined at 8:30 PM, whereas the other at 9:30
PM. The postmortem report depicts the time between injury and
death as 20 minutes to 01 hour in case of deceased Naqib Ullah.
This opinion of the doctor further falsifies the statement of the
complainant. If we admit that the incident occurred at 17:30
hours and the report was made at 18:30 hours, then in that
eventuality, the time between injury and death in case of
deceased Naqib Ullah does not lend support to the prosecution
version. The prosecution is to answer that when the deceased
survived for long one hour, what precluded them to shift the
deceased then injured to the hospital to save his life. This can be
interpreted in two different ways, either the complainant after
receiving firearm injuries was shifted to the hospital after a
considerable delay or the deceased Naqib Ullah, after receiving
firearm injuries left the spot in injured condition. The
circumstances do tell that the matter was reported after
consultation and deliberation. The witnesses are not in unison on
this particular aspect of the case and their this conflict puts us on

guard to re-assess the already assessed evidence.
-ll-
9. The Investigating Officer, after receiving copy of
the F.I.R, reached to the spot at 8:30 PM and on pointation of
one Inam Ullah, the site plan was prepared. The prosecution is to
tell that when Inam Ullah was present in the hospital, as it was
he who identified the dead body before the police at the time of
report and before the doctor at the time of postmortem
examination, it was he who received the dead bodies after
postmortem examination. The record tells that the postmortem
examination was completed at 9:30 PM and that right from
beginning till end, Inam Ullah was shown present in the hospital.
It surprises us that how could he be present on the spot at the
same time. The Investigating Officer was examined as PW-10,
who stated that on reaching to the spot many people were
present, out of them one came forward, whose hands and clothes
were besmeared with blood and introduced himself as Inam
Ullah and claimed to have seen the incident. On one hand, the
explanation rendered by the Investigating Officer does not
appeal to a prudent mind and on the other, the name of this
witness was neither mentioned in the calendar of witnesses nor
his statement was recorded. The statements of the witnesses in
respect of arrival of the dead-bodies alongwith injured witnesses
to the hospital and their subsequent examination by the doctor
when read in juxtaposition with report made by the complainant,

the same contradict each other and in turn damaged the
-12-
prosecution case beyond repair, more particularly, affected
veracity of the witnesses. When such is the state of affairs, then

one must look for independent corroboration.

10. The witnesses went in conflict regarding the mode
and manner of the incident. The complainant stated that after
performing Maghrib prayer when they reached near the house of
appellant Farzand Ali, the accused duly armed started firing at
them which resulted in injuries to the injured witnesses and
caused the death of the deceased. The site plan was gone through
to judge as to whether the same supports the stance of the
witness but the same does not, as the incident occurred a little
ahead from the house of the appellant Farzand Ali, and by then
the complainant side had already passed through the accused.
Considering statement of the other witness where he disclosed
that the moment, they passed through the accused they were fired
at, but the medical evidence does not support the complainant on
this particular aspect of the case, as in that eventuality the
deceased should have received entry wounds from their back,
which is not the case in hand. The circumstances do not support
the statements of the witnesses and we cannot ignore that men

may tell a lie but the circumstances do not.

11. While reading the postmortem reports and

medico legal certificates, it tells that each of the deceased
-13-
received a single firearm injury and such was the case with
injured. If all the accused duly armed would fire with the only
intention to kill, the situation would have been different with
multiple injuries to all the victims. We cannot ignore that all
injuries on injured witnesses landed on non-vital parts of their
bodies, had the intention was to kill, then the accused would
have easily eliminated their targets, but the circumstances
suggest that it was the doing of a single person. It troubles to
accept that the injured and accused were not accompanied from
mosque by the co-villagers, had they performed Maghrib prayer,
many co-villagers would accompany, absence of co-villagers can
only be translated in the other way. The complainant went on
suppressing of facts as by the time when the Investigating
Officer attracted to the spot, he observed many people including
Inam Ullah, who posed himself to have seen the incident, but the
complainant did not mention his presence on the spot at the time
of incident. The witnesses astonished us when they disclosed that
after firing at them, all the accused went inside the house of
Farzand Ali, inside the house they fired as a result of their firing
one of the appellant i.e. Yousaf Ali got injured. The complainant
never ever stated regarding the source of his information in
respect of the injury caused to Yousaf Ali. This disclosure on
part of the complainant twisted the prosecution story and we are

not hesitant to hold that in fact there was cross firing between the
-14-
parties which resulted into injuries from both the sides. When the
complainant admitted injury on person of the appellant and when
nothing was brought on record to convince that the same was
self-inflicted, we can form the only and only opinion that the real
facts were suppressed. It was argued that the appellant Farzand
Ali instituted a private complaint regarding the injury caused to
Yousaf Ali, where he charged numerous persons from the
complainant side but the same was dismissed as withdrawn. The
learned counsel tried to convince us that that act of instituting a
private complaint and its subsequent withdrawal has helped the
prosecution in bringing home guilt against the appellants. We are
not persuaded with what the learned counsel for the complainant
submitted, as law is settled that to invite conviction for an
accused charged the incriminating piece of evidence must be put
to him, especially when his statement under section 342, Cr.P.C.
is to be recorded, failing which the same cannot be pressed into
service against the accused charged. Law is settled that every
incriminating piece of evidence must be put to the accused
charged, failing which the same loses its evidentiary value, and

the present case is no exception.

12. The medical evidence does not get support from
the eyewitness account and even the site plan failed to

substantiate the claim of the witnesses. True that medical
-15-
evidence is confirmatory in nature and in case of confidence
inspiring eyewitness account, the same cannot overshadow the
trustworthy eyewitness account but in case in hand the witnesses
could not establish their presence on the spot and went in conflict
on material aspects of the case, in such eventuality the
importance of medical evidence cannot be ignored and the
conflict between the two has damaged the prosecution case
beyond repair. The dimension of injuries on bodies of the
deceased and injured witnesses are nearly the same and
possibility cannot be excluded that it was the doing of a single

man.

13. In the incident, two unfortunate persons lost their
lives, whereas five others received single firearm injuries on
their bodies. Two of the injured witnesses were abandoned
holding them unnecessary and one other could not be examined
being abroad, so at present we are faced with four injuries and
six accused. There is no cavil with the proposition that when an
injured fails to appear in support of his charge, no conviction can
be recorded in respect of the injury caused. The prosecution is to
show that which out of the six accused were responsible for the
remaining injuries, as the number of injuries do not
commensurate with the number of accused. If the prosecution

would succeed in bringing on record the common object for
-16-
which all the accused assembled at the place of incident, then the
number of accused and the number of injuries caused would not
play a vital role, but here when the prosecution could not
succeed in proving the common object and common interest of
the accused to eliminate the complainant side, in the like
situation it gains importance to specify that which of the accused
caused what injury, which the prosecution failed to specify. We
are to determine that which of the accused caused which of the
injury, but in absence of substantial evidence on this material
aspect of the case, we are unable to fish out the real culprits, and
even the complainant, who being the eyewitness, failed to
specify. Law is settled that benefit of doubt when arises must be
credited to the accused charged. We are not reluctant to apply the

same principle to the benefit of all convicted.

In case titled Mukhtasir_ and 5 others. Vs. The

State and another (2017 P.L.R 419) it was held that:-

“From the above assessment of evidence it is
discernable that the charge made by the
complainant party is exaggerated, as seven
number of one family have been implicated on
the strength of the motive which is more
tempting than blood feud. Reliance is placed
on the case titled “Muhammad Zaman. Vs.
The State and others (2014 SCMR 749)
wherein it is held that:- “The number of
assailants in the circumstances of the case
appears to have been exaggerated”.
-17-
In case titled “Munir Ahmed and others Vs. The

State and others” (2019 SCMR 2006), it was held by the apex

Court that:-

“Notwithstanding the magnitude of loss of

lives, the totality of circumstances,

unambiguously suggest that the occurrence

did not place in the manner as is alleged in

the crime report; argument that number of

assailants has been hugely exaggerated, as

confirmed by the acquittals of the co-

accused with somewhat identical roles,

though without specific attributions, is not

entirely beside the mark and in retrospect

calls for caution. It would be unsafe to

maintain the convictions”.
14. The record tells that out of five injured witnesses,
three were not produced and another important witness namely
Inam Ullah, on whose pointation the site plan was prepared, was
neither mentioned in the calendar of witnesses, nor produced
before the Court despite the fact he claimed to have witnessed
the incident. The conduct displayed by the prosecution by not
producing the most important witnesses has further damaged the
prosecution case and an inference can easily be drawn that the
abandoned eyewitnesses were not ready to support false claim of
the complainant, in the circumstances, Article 129(g) of the
Qanune-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, can happily be pressed into
service. In case titled Tahir Khan Vs. The State (2011 SCMR

646), wherein it was held that:-
-18-

“13. In the present case as observed above,

the clouds over the veracity of the

prosecution version began hovering with the

substitution of the initially nominated

persons in the F.LR. and also that

complainant did not appear as a witness. It

assumes relevance as he (Ghulam Hussain),

Sultan Mehmood and Ghulam Abbas were

given up by the prosecution and not

produced. The only possible conclusion is

that the prosecution sensed the risk of

producing them that they might not support

the said version. Their production thus was

withheld leaving doubts spreading all

around”.
15. It was stressed time and again that soon after his
arrest, the appellant Yousaf Ali led police party to his house
wherefrom the weapon of offence was recovered which matched
with seven empties out of empties collected from the spot. It was
argued that this valid piece of evidence is sufficient to implicate
the appellant in the tragedy. True that after his arrest, a
Kalashnikov was allegedly recovered from house of the
appellant on his pointation, but neither the Investigating Officer
nor all concerned could collect any evidence on record to
substantiate that the house in question was the sole ownership of
the appellant. It has not been clarified that the room wherefrom
the weapon of offence was recovered was in exclusive
possession of the appellant. Even the record is silent regarding
the safe custody of the weapon and its safe transmission to the

Firearms Expert for analysis. Another intriguing aspect of the

case is that on the day of incident, the house of the appellant was
-19-
searched but nothing incriminating was recovered. It is for the
seizing officer to tell that once they failed to recover despite
thorough search, that too, on the day of incident, how they
succeeded in recovering the same on the following day. The
recovery of the weapon on pointation of the appellant is
shrouded in mystery and the prosecution could not succeed in
resolving the same, in such eventuality, this piece of evidence
has lost its efficacy and cannot be taken into consideration, that

too, to convict the appellants.

16. The motive was stated to be landed property
dispute between the parties and in that respect Rukhsar Ali, the
acquitted co-accused had registered an F.I.R under section 324
P.P.C against the complainant of the present case. The
complainant was cross examined on this particular aspect of the
case, who disclosed that the motive was between him and the
acquitted co-accused. When the appellants had nothing to do
with the motive, then what gathered them with the acquitted co-
accused to kill the deceased. The Investigating Officer did not
record statements of independent witnesses in support of motive
alleged by the complainant. True that absence or weakness of
motive alone is not a sufficient cause to disbelieve, but keeping
in view the peculiar circumstances of the present case, that too,

when the sole purpose was landed property dispute, then the
-20-
prosecution was under obligation to prove the same, failing
which none else but the prosecution would suffer. In case titled

“Nadeem Ramzan Vs the State (2018 SCMR 149), it is held

that:-

“It has been held by this Court in many cases

that if the prosecution asserts a motive but

fails to prove the same then such failure on

the part of the prosecution may react against

a sentence of death passed against a convict

on a capital charge and a reference in this

respect may be made to the cases of Ahmad

Nawaz v. The State (2011 SCMR 593)”
17. The cumulative effect of what has been stated
above brings this Court to an inescapable conclusion that the
prosecution miserably failed to bring home guilt against the
appellants and that the incident did not occur in the mode,
manner and at the stated time. The impugned judgment is
suffering from inherent defects and the learned trial Judge
misdirected himself in law and on facts of the case, which calls
for interference. The instant criminal appeal is allowed the
impugned judgment is set aside and the appellants are acquitted
of the charges, they shall be released forthwith if not required to
be detained in connection with any other criminal case. Since we
have set aside the impugned judgment of conviction, therefore,
the connected criminal appeal No.35-B of 2019 and criminal

revision No.09-B of 2019, are hereby dismissed for having

become infructuous.
