JUDGMENT

Cr.MQP No.61-M/2016.
Date of hearing 10.02.2017.
Rahmat Bar Khan Vs Daulat Khan etc

Petitioners by Mr. Aziz Ahmad Advocate

Respondents by Mr. Asghar Ali Advocate
alongwith Sabir Shah AAG.

IKRAMULLAH KHAN, J-. Through the instant petition,

petitioner Rahmat Bar Khan, seeks quashment of order dated
21.3.2016 rendered by learned Judicial Magistrate Timergara,
whereby in light of application u/s 4C(1) of KPK Prosecution
Services (Constitution, Functions and Powers) Act, 2005 (Act)
submitted by District Public Prosecutor Dir Lower, at
Timergara, the respondents involved in case FIR No.350 dated
10.7.2015 u/s 337-A(ii), F(iv)/34 PPC, Khall, were discharged
by learned Judicial Magistrate, Timergara.

2. In essence, respondents were charged by complainant

for causing injuries to him and his son Jehanzeb by giving them
sharp edged article/weapon blows as well as hitting them with
stones.

3. I have heard arguments of learned counsel for the
parties and gone through the record.

4. Perusal of record reveals that during pendency of bail
before arrest application of respondents, in the Court of learned
Sessions Judge/Zilla Qazi, Dir lower, the complainant Rehmat
Bar Khan and his son Jehanzeb (injured) had submitted a deed
Ex.PA in respect of compromise with the respondents and on
the back of the same, their joint statement was also recorded
wherein they had stated that the matter between the parties
has been patched up through elders of locality and that they
have got no objection on confirmation of ad interim pre-arrest
bail of respondents as well as their acquittal during trial, so on
the basis of said compromise, the learned Sessions Judge, had
confirmed the bail before arrest of respondents.

5. Since the matter had been patched up between the
parties and the offences were compoundable in nature
therefore, the District Public Prosecutor Dir Lower at
Timergara, withheld the prosecution on the basis of
compromise by exercising his powers under Section 4-C(i) of

KPK Prosecution Service (Constitution, function and powers)
Act 2005, who also submitted application before the learned
trial Court for discharging the respondents. The learned Judicial
Magistrate, being agree with the opinion of District Public
Prosecutor while allowing application u/s 4-C(i) of the Act ibid,
discharged the respondents from the charges leveled against
them. Being dissatisfied from the same, petitioner/complainant
has preferred the instant quashment petition.

6. Admittedly, the matter had been patched up between
the parties through elders of locality and to this effect joint
statement of complainant and injured Jehanzeb is available on
file, according to which, they had expressed their no objection
on the confirmation of bail before arrest of respondents as well
as their acquittal during trial. The offence is compoundable in
nature and once a compromise always a compromise unless it
is brought on record that the same was effected through any
influence, coercion or force. If the petitioner/complainant was
aggrieved from the said compromise being not effected with his
consent, then he should have filed a _ bail cancellation
application against the said order but no such application has
been moved nor the complainant pointed out any illegality or
irregularity in the impugned order of learned Judicial

Magistrate, Timergara, thereby allowing the application u/s 4-
C(i) of the Act, filed by learned District Public Prosecutor.
Section 4-C(i) of KPK Prosecution Service (Constitution,
Function and Powers) Act, 2005, reads as under:-

4(c) in respect of compoundable
offences, other than those which
are punishable by death or life
imprisonment, the Director General
Prosecution, and in respect of
compoundable offences punishable
with imprisonment for seven years
or less, the District Public
Prosecutor, may-

(i) withhold prosecution — if
reasonable ground exists to believe
that the offence is compoundable;
provided that if the offence is not
compounded within a period of one
month, a report shall be lodged in
the court of competent jurisdiction
for prosecution and trial; or”

7. In view of contents of above provisions of law, it
is clear that the District Public Prosecutor has been empowered
to withhold the prosecution if the offence is compoundable,
carrying punishment upto 7 years, who may also apply to the
Court for discharge of such accused. Moreover, when the
complainant party had expressed their no objection on the
acquittal of respondents on the basis of compromise effected
between the parties, then they cannot resile from their such
deposition, who failed to point out any coercion, influence or

force used by respondents for compelling them to compromise
the matter with the respondents. Hence, the learned District
Public Prosecutor has rightly withheld the prosecution followed
by learned Judicial Magistrate, by discharging the respondents,
which needs no interference by this Court. Consequently, the
instant petition being devoid of any merit is dismissed.
