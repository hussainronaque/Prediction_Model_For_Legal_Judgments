JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- At a trial

held by learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Mardan,

appellant Rehman Ullah, having been found guilty of

committing the murder of Muhammad Islam and Mian Said

Ghani deceased, has been handed down death sentence on

two counts under section 302 (b) PPC and also to pay

Rs.2,00,000/-, as compensation in terms of $.544-A Cr.P.C.

to LRs of the two deceased, recoverable as arrears of land

revenue or in default thereof to undergo 06 months S.I.

further. Benefit of $.382-B Cr.P.C. has been extended to

him.

2. Through the instant appeal, appellant-convict

has challenged his conviction and sentence. The learned

Trial Court has sent Murder Reference No.13 of 2013, for

confirmation of death sentence of the convict in terms of

S.374 Cr.P.C. Both being the outcome of one and the same

judgment of the learned Trial Court, therefore, we propose

of dispose of the same through this common judgment.

3. The prosecution case as unfolded in First

Information Report is that on 02.02.2011 at 17.30 hours,

complainant Muhammad Inam (PW.8), in company of

dead body of his deceased brother Muhammad Islam and

his farmer Mian Said Ghani, reported in Police Station

Rustam, District Mardan that on the eventful day he

alongwith the above named two deceased and his brother

PW Siraj Munir, was present in his field known as “Drey

Pulay Wand”, that the two deceased were busy in

ploughing the field while he alongwith PW Siraj Munir,

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

was sitting near them on a “Pulla’”/ ridge of the field,

when in the meantime at 16.30 hours, Rehman Ullah

(appellant-convict herein), alongwith absconding

co-accused Abid, duly armed with firearms, came there

and opened fire at the two deceased, as a result, both got

hit and died on the spot. The accused decamped from the

crime venue after commission of the offence. Motive

behind the incident was that little before the incident;

deceased Muhammad Islam, thrashed the younger brothers

of the accused on the ground that they were damaging his

crop by cutting the same. In addition to complainant the

incident is stated to have been witnessed by his brother

PW Siraj Munir.

4. Report of the complainant was recorded by

Fazal Elahi Bacha SHO (PW.10) in the shape of FIR

Exh.PA No.111 dated 02.02.2011 under sections 302/34

PPC Police Station Rustam. He prepared injury sheets and

inquest reports of the two deceased Exh.PM/1 to Exh.PM/4

and shifted their dead bodies to the mortuary for
postmortem examination.

Y hours.

6. Munir Khan SI (PW.9), proceeded to the spot

and prepared site plan Exh.PB on the pointation of

eyewitnesses. During spot inspection he secured blood

Exh.P.1 from the place of the deceased and 7 empties of

222 bore Exh.P.2 from the places of the accused vide

recovery memo Exh.PW.8/1. Vide recovery memo

Exh.PW.8/2, he took into possession small bundle of

“Shaftal crop” Exh.P.4 allegedly cut down by brother of

the accused. He also took into possession the last worn

bloodstained garments of the deceased vide recovery

memo Exh.PW.8/3, sent by doctor from hospital after

postmortem examination of the deceased. Vide application

Exh.PW.9/2, he sent bloodstained articles to the FSL

report whereof is Exh.PW.9/3. He also sent the empties for

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

safe custody to the FSL. Since, the accused were avoiding

their arrest, therefore, he initiated proceedings under

sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. against them, recorded

statements of PWs under section 161 Cr.P.C. and after

completion of investigation handed over case file to the

SHO, who submitted challan in terms of $.512 Cr.P.C.

against the accused. Appellant was later on arrested.

Nooran Shah Khan SI (PW.5) obtained his physical

remand, interrogated him and recorded his statement under

section 161 Cr.P.C. After completion of necessary

investigation, he handed over case file to the SHO, he

submitted supplementary challan against him on

12.10.2011.

7. On receipt of challan by the learned Trial Court,

accused/appellant was summoned and formally charge-

sheeted under section 302 PPC, to which he pleaded not

guilty and claimed trial. To prove its case, prosecution

examined as many as ten witnesses. After closure of the

prosecution evidence, statement of the appellant was

recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he denied the

prosecution allegations and professed his innocence. He,

however, declined to be examined on oath or to produce

evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial, the learned

Trial Court, after hearing both the sides, convicted and

sentenced the appellant as mentioned above.

8. The main thrust of the argument of learned

counsel for the appellant was that the incident is unseen

and PWs Muhammad Inam and Siraj Munir being real

brothers of deceased Muhammad Islam and tenants of

deceased Mian Said Ali Shah, are highly interested and

procured witnesses, who badly failed to establish their

presence on the spot at the time of incident through some

strong physical circumstances of the incident that’s why

their testimony is suffering from material contradictions

and discrepancies creating serious doubts in the

prosecution case; that let off of the PWs the brothers of

deceased Muhammad Islam having common motive and

doing away with innocent person Mian Said Ghani by the

appellant does not appeal to a prudent mind; that site plan

does not support the ocular version, as neither any

ploughing instrument nor the filed allegedly ploughed have

been shown therein; that no ploughing instrument has been

taken into possession in support of the ocular version; that

medical evidence also negates the ocular account and

indicates that the charge has been exaggerated as

dimensions of all entrance wounds on the person of the

two deceased are one and the same, which proves the

incident to be the doing of single person; that empties

recovered from the spot has been shown sent to the FSL,

but no FSL report in this regard is available on file, from

which it can be determined as to whether these have been

fired from one or more than one weapon; that mere

recovery of blood, empties, bloodstained garments of the

deceased, positive Serologist report and postmortem

reports, coupled with abscondance of the appellant, which

otherwise, he has denied the same in his statement under

section 342 Cr.P.C., in absence of substantive evidence,

10

being only corroborative and confirmatory pieces of

evidence, would not be sufficient enough to prove the guilt

of the appellant. He contended that the prosecution

evidence is pregnant with doubts, benefit of which is to be

extended to the appellant.

9. Conversely, learned AAG for the State assisted

by learned counsel for the complainant contended that

appellant is directly charged alongwith absconding

co-accused for committing murder of two deceased, in a

promptly lodged report, eliminating the possibility of

concoction and fabrication; that being a day light incident

and parties well known to each other, question of mistaken

identity does not arise; that there exists no previous ill will

or serious enmity between the parties therefore it does not

appeal to a prudent mind that complainant would substitute

the real culprits by implicating innocent persons; that

ocular account furnished by PWs is straightforward,

trustworthy and confidence inspiring and they have

successfully established their presence on the spot with the

11

deceased at the time of incident and defence failed to

create any dent in their testimony; that medical evidence,

site plan, recoveries from the spot, the bloodstained

garments of the deceased with positive FSL report coupled

with noticeable unexplained abscondance of the appellant,

squarely corroborate the ocular account, therefore, the

learned trial Court was justified by holding the appellant

guilty of the offence. They contended that the impugned

judgment being well reasoned and based on_ proper

appraisal of evidence, is not open to any interference by

this Court.

10. We have given our anxious consideration to the

respective arguments advanced at the bar from either side

and perused the record carefully.

11. It is well settled principle of law that for

recording conviction strong and corroborative evidence of

unimpeachable character is required and that the findings of

guilt against accused must not be based on probabilities to

be inferred from evidence, rather, findings must rest surely

12

and firmly on the evidence of unimpeachable character,

otherwise, the golden rule of benefit of doubt would be

reduced to naught. It is settled law that a witness who

claims himself to be the eyewitness of the occurrence, must

prove his presence on the spot and shall satisfy the mind of

the Court qua his presence through some _ physical

circumstances or corroborative evidence.

12. Taking the case in hand at the touch stone of the

principles referred above, we have to evaluate the ocular

account furnished by Siraj Munir (PW.7) and Muhmmad

Khan (PW.8). Thrashing the younger brother of the

appellant by deceased Muhammad Islam on the ground of

damaging the crop of his field, has been advanced as

motive behind the incident. Complainant has _ not

specifically mentioned “Shaftal crop” in his report,

however, later on, the I.O. has taken some “Shaftal”

allegedly cut down by the brother of the deceased. The

crime venue has been shown the fields known as “Darey

Pulay”. The two deceased have been shown in the site plan

13

Exh.PB at points No.1 and 2, while PWs Siraj and

Muhammad Inam at points No.5 and 6. The appellant has

been assigned point No.3 and absconding co-accused point

No.4. The distance inter-se the deceased and the accused

has been shown round about 7 paces, while between the

PWs and accused as 18 to 20 paces. The stance of the PWs

is that the appellant alongwith absconding co-accused came

to the spot and opened fire at the two deceased, resultantly;

they got hit and died on the spot. The crucial aspect which

disturb our mind is that if the appellant had got annoyed on

thrashing of his younger brother by deceased Muhammad

Islam, their target should have been Muhammad Islam

deceased and his other two brothers i.e. PWs Inam and Siraj

Munir, only, and not deceased Mian Said Ghani Shah, but

astonishingly it is not the stance of the PWs that they were

also fired at but this version of the PWs is unbelievable

because no assailant, in such eventualities, would take a

risk to leave evidence behind him or to let off the real

brothers of the person being done to death by them in their

14

presence so as to leave a risk of taking vengeance behind or

the ocular evidence. Both the PWs have not furnished any

justification as to why they were spared by the accused and

why deceased Mian Said Ali, who had no motive

whatsoever with the appellant, was done to death. This

aspect of the case create serious doubts about the presence

of the PWs. Had they been present on the spot, the

assailant/ assailants who committed the two murders, would

not have spared them. Both in cross-examination admit that

they can differentiate between different kinds of weapons,

but none of them has specifically mentioned about the kind

of weapon used in the commission of offence, rather, a

general word “firearms”, has been used by them, which

speaks about their non-availability on the spot at the time of

incident. Had they been there, they would have disclosed

the specific kinds of weapons the accused were allegedly

having in their possession. It has been specifically

mentioned by complainant in his initial report that they

being empty handed did not chase the accused, but

15

contradicting his version PW Siraj Munir in his statement

recorded during proceedings under section 512 Cr.P.C.

deposed that they chased the accused after commission of

the offence. He was confronted with his statement but he

denied his earlier version which amounts to dishonest

improvement. Complainant Muhammad Inam (PW.8)

deposed that he was having a shop in his village during the

day of occurrence and on the day of occurrence the same

was being run by his servant. He has not produced the said

servant to substantiate his stance, in absence of which it can

be safely held that he was present in his shop at the time of

incident. Both the PWs have deposed about availability of

the ploughing instrument on the spot, but no such

instrument whatsoever has been shown in the site plan or

taken into possession by the I.O. during spot inspection to

substantiate their version. Similarly, the area allegedly

being ploughed by the two deceased has also not been

shown in the site plan Exh.PB. Munir Khan SI (PW.9) in

cross-examination deposed that though he noticed

16

ploughing machine on the spot, but did not consider it

necessary to take the same in possession. The explanation

furnished by him does not appeal to our mind because if he

was so conscious to collect the “Shaftal” allegedly cut

down by the brother of the appellant, then if any ploughing

machine was there on the spot, he would have definitely

shown the same in the site plan and would have taken it into

possession. The non-recovery of ploughing machine from

the spot cast serious doubts in the prosecution story.

13. In view of the above discussion, we are firm in

our view that the occurrence has not taken place in the

mode and manner as alleged by the PWs, posing themselves

to be the eyewitnesses of the incident. The peculiar facts

and circumstances of the incident discussed above clearly

speak about non-presence of the two PWs on the spot at the

time of incident. Both have badly failed to establish their

presence on the spot at the time of incident with the

deceased through some strong physical circumstances of

the incident, therefore, the learned Trial Court has wrongly

17

believed and relied upon their testimony. Their testimony

being shaky and scanty suffering from material

contradictions, discrepancies and negated by the medical

evidence as well as the peculiar facts and circumstances of

the case, cannot be believed. It has been held by the

Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled, “Basharat and

another Vs the State” (NER 1996 Criminal Supreme

Court 26) that “evidentiary value of eyewitnesses in case

where there is no judicial certainty or circumstantial

guarantee about presence of eyewitnesses on spot, but

there are cogent reasons to doubt that eyewitnesses were

present on spot and had seen occurrence, then in such

case, there would be no option but to exclude the ocular

evidence from consideration”.

Similarly, in case titled, “Mst. Shamshad Vs the

State” (NLR 1998 Criminal Supreme Court 385) the

august apex Court held as under:

“Eye-witnesses would be unreliable when

they were not present at scene of

18

occurrence and account given by them is

found to be unnatural”.

Taking guidance from the judgment of the august apex

Court (Supra), we exclude the testimony of the alleged

eyewitnesses from consideration.

14. The recovered crime empties have

allegedly been sent to the FSL, but no FSL report regarding

the fact that whether these have been fired from one or

more than one weapon is available. The one and the same

dimensions of entry wounds on the person of two deceased

speak about the occurrence to be the doing of single person,

therefore, in the circumstances, corroboration qua each

accused to prove his guilt is the essential requirement of the

law, which is lacking in the instant case. Besides, crime

weapon has neither been recovered from the direct or

indirect possession of the appellant nor on his pointation

nor has he confessed his guilt before the competent Court of

law, therefore, mere recovery of empties, blood from the

spot, bloodstained garments of the deceased and positive

19

Serologist report in respect thereof, coupled with the

autopsy reports, being corroborative and confirmatory

pieces of evidence, in absence of direct evidence would not

be sufficient to prove the guilt of the appellant. In this

regard guidance can be derived from Riaz Ahmed’s case

(2010 SCMR 846). As per the dictum of the apex Court,

corroborative evidence is meant to test the veracity of

ocular evidence. Both corroborative and ocular testimony is

to be read together and not in isolation. Wisdom in this

regard may be derived from Ijaz Ahmed’s case (1997

SCMR 1279 and Asadullah’s case (PLD 1971 SC 541).

It has been held by the apex Court in case titled, “Saifullah

Vs the State” (1985 SCMR 410), that when there is no

eyewitness to be relied upon, then there is nothing, which

can be corroborated by the recovery. Similarly, in case

titled, “Riaz Masih Vs the State” 1995 SCMR 1730, the

honourable apex Court held that recovery of crime weapon

by itself is not sufficient for conviction on murder charge.

20

The same view has been expressed by the apex Court in

Saifullah’s case (1985 SCMR 410).

15. It is borne out from the record that

proceedings under section 512 Cr.P.C. had been initiated

and completed against the appellant, which on the one

hand, he has denied the same in his statement under

section 342 Cr.P.C. while on the other hand, it is settled

law that abscondence alone, cannot be a substitute of real

evidence. It has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court

in Farman Ali and others’ case (PLD 1980 SC 201) that

abscondence by itself would be of no avail to prosecution

in absence of any other evidence against the absconding

accused. Mere abscondence of accused would not be

enough to sustain his conviction. Reference in this regard

can also made to case titled, “Muhammad Vs Pesham

Khan (1986 SCMR 823).

16. For what has been discussed above, we have

reached to an irresistible conclusion that prosecution has

miserably failed to bring home the guilt of appellant

21

through cogent and confidence inspiring evidence beyond

shadow of reasonable doubt. The prosecution evidence is

pregnant with doubts and as per golden principle of benefit

of doubt one substantial doubt would be enough for

acquittal of the accused. The rule of benefit of doubt is

essentially a rule of prudence, which cannot be ignored

while dispensing justice in accordance with law.

Conviction must be based on unimpeachable evidence and

certainty of guilt and any doubt arising in the prosecution

case, must be resolved in favour of the accused. The said

rule is based on the maxim that “ it is better that ten guilty

persons be acquitted rather than one innocent person be

convicted” which occupied a pivotal place in the Islamic

Law and is enforced strictly in view of the saying of the

Holy Prophet (PBUH) that the “mistake of Qazi (Judge)

in releasing a criminal is better than his mistake in

punishing an innocent”. Guidance in this respect may

also be derived from the judgments of the Hon’ble

Supreme Court in case titled, *Muhammad Khan and

22

another Vs the State” (1999 SCMR 1220) and case

titled, “Muhammad Ikram Vs the State” (2009 SCMR

230).

17. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed. Conviction

and sentences of the appellant recorded and awarded by

the learned Trial Court vide impugned judgment dated

13.12.2013, are hereby set aside and he is acquitted of the

charges leveled against him. He be set at liberty forthwith,

if not required in any other case.

18. Accordingly, death sentence of the appellant-

convict is not confirmed and the Murder Reference No.13

of 2013, sent by the learned Trial Court is thus answered in

the Negative.

Announced.
