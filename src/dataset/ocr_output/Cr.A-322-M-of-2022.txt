2. Reportedly, the complainant/IHC,

Ubaid Khan along with his official colleagues of
levy force (named in the FIR) were present on
crime scene and arranged an _ improvised
“Nakabandi”. At the fateful time, a motorcar
bearing registration No. J-4876, driven by the
accused/appellant (Javaid Khan), on its arrival at
the Nakabandi point, it was signal to stop and its
due search led to the recovery of narcotics as
“ICE” net weighing 500 grams (lying in a plastic
bag beneath the front seat of the car). The event
was reduced into in writing in the shape of
‘Murasila’ (Ex. PA/1) followed by FIR No. 88
(Ex. PA) dated 14.10.2021 registered against the
accused/ appellant, U/S 11 (b), K.P CNSA, Act,
2019 at P.S, Fazal Subhan Shaheed (Thana),

District Malakand.

3. Upon arrest of the accused/appellant
followed by preliminary investigation on the spot,
after drawl of sample from the relevant plastic bag,
sealed the same in separate parcels as well as the
remaining stuff and the ‘Murasila’ was sent to the

P.S concerned.

4. On completion of the investigation,
challan was drawn and was sent-up for trial to the
learned trial Court. Accused was confronted with
the statement of allegations through formal charge-
sheet to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed

trial.

5. To substantiate the guilt of the
aceused/appellant, the prosecution placed
reliance on the account six (06) PWs. The
accused was confronted with the evidence so
furnished through statement of accused within the

meaning of section 342 Cr.P.C.

6. On conclusion of proceedings in the
trial, in view of the evidence so recorded and the
assistance so rendered by the learned counsel for
the accused/appellant and the learned State
counsel, the learned trial Court arrived at the
conclusion that the prosecution has successfully
brought home charge against the appellant/
accused, Javaid Khan, through cogent & worth
reliable evidence, as such, the accused was
convicted & sentenced (as highlighted in the

proceeding Para of this judgment).

Nawad (5B) HON!

7. It obliged the appellant/accused to

approach this Court through the subject criminal

appeal.

8. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
accused/appellant as well as the learned Astt: A.G for
the State have been heard at a substantial length and

the record gone through with their valuable assistance.

9, Needless to highlight that in the
subject case, the law of the land was set in motion
when the complainant/IHC, Ubaid Khan (PW-4),
with other levy personnel laid a_ picket
(“Nakabandi”). The levy officials halted a
motorcar bearing registration No. J-4876 for the
purpose of checking. Due search of the subject
motorcar led to the recovery of narcotics as “ICE”
net weighing 500 grams, lying in a plastic bag
beneath the front seat of the car. Out of which, 5
grams was separated for the chemical analysis of
the FSL and sealed in parcel No. 1, whereas, the
remaining stuff i.e. 495 grams was sealed in parcel
No. 2. The accused as well as the motorcar were
taken into possession at the spot. The accused and

the case property were handed over to PW-3, driver

Nawab GB) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN
5-
Fazal Hussain (No. 5246) for its onward delivery to

the police station concerned.

10. It is hard fact that in the subject event
it was the complainant/IHC, Ubaid Khan (PW-4),
who has conduct all the proceedings on the spot Le,
recovery of the contraband, separation of the
sample, preparation of parcels, drafting of the
‘Murasila’, recovery memo, arrest of the accused

and sending the ‘Murasila’ to the police station,

however, it is interesting to note that even

subsequently all the investigation has been carried &
conducted by PW-4 himself. He handed over the
‘Murasila’ to PW-3, Fazal Hussain, driver for its
transmission to the police station for registration of
the case, on his return he delivered the copy of the
FIR for the purpose of further investigation to
PW-4, Ubaid Khan. The complainant thereafter
prepared the site plan, (Ex. PB) with all its put-
notes on the pointation of the alleged eyewitnesses
and recorded their statements U/S 161 Cr.P.C. The

stuff sealed in a parcel, the motorcar and the

Nawab @.B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN
-6-

accused under the escort Duty-Police-Officer with
his team were transmitted to the police station. The
said PW produced the accused before the
concerned Court for taking his judicial custody. He
also drafted the application for sending the samples
to the F.S.L with the directions to D.F.C Nafees
Muhammad to take the same to the F.S.L and thus
right from the very registration of the FIR till the
completion of challan and submitting the same to
the learned trial Court all the proceedings have
been carried out by the seizing officer, Ubaid
Khan, IHC (PW-4), therefore, in the given facts &
circumstances, it is to be seen that as to whether the
complainant/IHC under the law on subject was
competent enough to carry & conduct the
preliminary investigation on the spot or the Station
Police Officer (SHO) of the P.S was authorized to
depute a police officer competent under the law on

subject to carry the investigation accordingly.

11. There is no denial at all that the
complainant of a criminal case is always interested
in success of his case which he has been registered
against an accused person, as such, it cannot be
denied that the complainant has every interest to
bring home charge against an accused person in
view of the evidence so collected during the
investigation and on this score alone the seizure &
arrest of an accused person has been allocated to
the preventative police force, whereas, the
investigation is carried & conducted by the
Investigation Agency on the only ground to ensure
free, fair & transparent investigation so that to
avoid a remote chance biased attitude of the
Investigation Officer to ensure by hook or crook

the case as successful.

12. Other than it in the case in hand, the
complainanv/IHC, Ubaid Khan (PW-4) has acted as
a complainant, as a witness as well as an

Investigating Officer. Under the law a complainant

Neweh 6.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN
-8-

and an accused person are considered to be two
opponents/rivals, as such, they are contesting
parties, supporting their respective pleas/claims,
whereas, the role of an Investigating Officer is to
unearth the truth, an Investigating Officer cannot
be expected to be a party in the case and that is
what the relevant law on subject speaks. Rule No.
25.2 (3), Police Rules, 1934 as well as Article 18,
Police Order, 2002 being relevant for the present

controversy are reproduced below;-

25.2 (3) Within the limits of his charge he is
the chief investigating officer, and as such he shall
conduct all investigations in persons, so far_as
circumstances permit, His responsibility in this
matter must be carefully maintained. Should it be
necessary, owing to the absence of the sub-
inspector or any other cause, for a subordinate to
undertake an investigation, the sub-inspector shall
satisfy himself by perusing the case diary and
questioning the investigating officer that the
investigation has been fully and properly
conducted, shall remedy what is defective, and take
over the investigation as soon as he is free to do so,
except in a case originally investigated by an
assistant sub-inspector where he will be guided by
rule,

Article 18. Separation of investigation function.-

(1) There shall be separation of investigation from
other functions of the Police,

(2) Subject to clause (3), the District Investigation

Branch shall investigate, under the supervision of the
Head of District Investigation Branch, all cases
registered in the District.

Nawab (@.B} HON‘BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN
-9-

(3) The Provincial Police Officer may notify the
offences which shall be investigated by the
investigation officer in the police station under the
supervision of the officer-in-charge of the police
station and if an offence in a case is required to be
investigated by the District Investigation Branch
then the entire case shall be investigated by the
District Investigation Branch.

(4) The District Investigation Branch, other than in
the Capital City District or a City District, shall be
headed by a police officer not below the rank of a
Superintendent of Police and shall consist of such
other police officers as the Provincial Police Officer
may determine.

The ibid rules mandates that an
Investigating Officer is duty bound to dig-out the
truth & actual facts of the case and he should not
be guilty of a partisan approach. If the aforesaid
yardstick is applied to the case of the
accused/appellant then it is an admitted fact
floating on the surface of the record that the
complainant by acting as an Investigating Officer
could not be expected fairness and transparency
especially when the appellant in his statement
recorded U/S 342 Cr.P.C has alleged a specific plea
of malafide involvement of the levy officials, in

particular the complainant of the subject event.

13. It is also relevant to mention here that
in the recent past the trend of acting by the
complainant as an Investigating Officer in narcotics
cases have been deprecated & discouraged by this
Court as well as by various Courts of the country
and it was seriously observed that “a complainant
could not be an Investigating Officer, as such an
act/practice goes a long way to defeat the very
abject of a fair, honest and transparent

investigation”. In case titled “State through

Advocate General, Sindh v/s Bashir and others”

reported as PLD 1997 Supreme Court 408, the

Apex Court has held as under;-

The Investigating Officer is as important witness for the
defence also and in case the head of the police party also
becomes the Investigating Officer, he may not be able to
discharge his duties as required of him under the Police
Rules.

Likewise, in case titled “Fahad v/s

The State” reported as 2022 P Cr.LJ 279, the

same rational was reiterated by the Sindh High

Court in the following words;-

It is also pertinent to mention here that in this case —
complainant/ SIP Muhammad Khan had not only

Nawab (6-8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN
Sle

-11-

lodged FIR but also conducted investigation of the case
himself as well as he himself took the case property for
Chemical Examination. In our view it is/was not
appropriate that the person who is complainant of a
case could investigate the same case and took the
narcotic item for report because in order to keep all
fairness of thing the rule of propriety demands that it
must be investigated by an independent officer but not
by the complainant himself.

Similarly, in case titled “Zeenat Ali
v/s The State” reported as 2021 P Cr. LJ 1294 it

was held by Islamabad High Court that;-

In the present case the complainant had himself
conducted the investigation of the case, however, the
person who was complainant of the case in order to keep
all fairness of thing could not investigate the same case,
which must be investigated by an independent officer
but not by the complainant himself. Investigation by
complainant while functioning as Investigating Officer is
a biased investigation.

14, It is part of the record that in the
subject case the investigation has been carried out
by Ubaid Khan, IHC (PW-4), who is below the
rank of Sub-Inspector. For ready reference Section

2 (e) (ii), K.P, CNSA Act, 2019 is reproduced

below;-

(ii) a police officer/official not below the rank of Sub-
Inspector, authorized by the Regional Officer;

However, in the case in hand, the
aforesaid mandatory provision has not been
complied with, therefore, on this alone, the
impugned conviction & sentence is also not

maintainable in the eyes of law.

“Neves ———‘(.B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN

15. It is well settled, it is not essential at
all to place reliance on multiple doubts coupled
with multiple grounds to extend the benefit of
doubt to an accused, even a single worth reliable
doubt is sufficient enough to extend its benefit to
an accused person as it is the cardinal principle of
criminal administration of justice that let hundred
guilty persons be acquitted but one innocent
person should not be convicted. In case titled

“Tariq Pervaiz v/s The State” reported as 1995

SCMR 1345 , the Apex Court has held as under;-

That the concept of benefit of doubt to an accused
person is deep-rooted in our country. For giving him
benefit of doubt, it is not necessary that there should be
many circumstances creating doubts. If there is a
circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a
prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then the
accused will be entitled to the benefit not as a matter of
grace and concession but as a matter of right.

Further reliance is placed on the case

law cited as “Daniel boyd (Muslim_name
Saifullah) vs __ the State” reported as

1992, SCMR_196”, where the following

observations were recorded by the Apex Court;-

Nobody is to be punished unless proved guilty on the
basis of reliable or true evidence. Benefit of every
reasonable doubt is to go to the accused.

Newb ($B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN
-13-

This view also reflects in the

judgment of the apex Court titled as “Ghulam

Qadir_and 2 others vs the State” reported as

2008 SCMR 1221, wherein it was observed that:-

"Benefit of doubt. Principle of applicability, For the
purpose of benefit of doubt to an accused, more than one
infirmity is not required. Single infirmity creates
reasonable doubt in the mind of a reasonable and
prudent person regarding the truth of charge, makes the
whole case doubtful. “

In support of the same rational,
further reliance is placed on the judgment of the

august Supreme Court of Pakistan cited as

“Muhammad Zaman _vs._the State” (2014

SCMR 749), wherein it was held that;-

Even a single doubt if found reasonable, was enough to
warrant acquittal of the accused.

16. For what has been discussed above,
this Court is of the firm view that the prosecution
has failed to prove its case against the accused/
appellant, Javaid Khan beyond reasonable doubt,
as such, his conviction cannot be maintained.
Resultantly, while extending him the benefit of
the doubt the subject criminal appeal is allowed

and the impugned order/judgment of conviction

& sentence dated 24.09.2022 recorded by the

learned trial Court is set aside and consequently —

of the charges leveled against him. He be

required.

17. These are reasons for my short order

of even date.
