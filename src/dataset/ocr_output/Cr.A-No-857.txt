CONSOLIDATED
JUDGMENT

WIQAR AHMAD, J.- My this judgment is directed
to dispose of Criminal Appeal No. 857-P of 2019 filed
by the accused/appellant against his conviction and
sentence awarded vide judgment dated 26.06.2019 of

the Court of learned Sessions Judge/ Zila Qazi Buner

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
at Dagger and Criminal Revision No. 62-M of 2019

filed by the complainant for enhancement of the

conviction and sentence awarded to
accused/respondent.
2. FIR in the case was registered on the

basis of ‘Murasila’ sent by Mian Hussain Shah ASI
(PW-3) on 23.05.2018 wherein he has stated, that he
rushed to the emergency room of DHQ hospital
Dagger on receiving information of the arrival of
the injured, where he found the injured namely
Shah Haroon son of Muhammad Zaman, Mujeeb-ur-
Rehman son of Amir Zada Khan and Shams-ul-
Islam son of Gul Roz Khan residents of Bampokha
lying on the hospital beds in injured condition. One
of the injured namely Shah Haroon (complainant)
reported the matter to the police officer that sister of
the accused namely Shaukat Ali had been engaged to
his son namely Nawaz Sharif. The said engagement
was broken later, due to the development of some
misunderstanding between the parties. The accused
Shaukat Ali and son of the complainant was stated to
have been exchanging hot words on the said issue in

the street that the complainant heard the noise and

Nawab (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
came out of his house. Both were separated by the
complainant along with the other neighbors
namely Mujeeb-ur-Rehman and Shams-ul-Islam
(the other two injured/persons). After some time, the
accused namely Shaukat Ali was alleged to have
appeared over the wall of his house and to have
started firing upon the complainant as well as the
other two (2) injured with the intention to kill them.
The complainant received firearm injuries on chest
and right arm, while Mujeeb-ur-Rehman was stated
to have received injuries on left hand, left shoulder
and right hand, whereas Shams-ul-Islam was stated
to have got injured on chest and left side of belly.
Motive for the occurrence was stated to be the
dispute over women-folk. The complainant charged
the accused for the commission of the offence. His
report was also seconded by the other two injured
namely Mujeeb-ur-Rehman and Shams-ul-Islam by
affixing their thumb impressions on the ‘Murasila’.
Later on, FIR No. 878 dated 23.05.2018 was
registered against the accused/appellant under

sections 324, 337-D, 337 F (i), 337 F (iii) PPC read

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
with section 15 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Arms
Act 2013 at the police station Jowar District Buner.
3. Investigation started in the case wherein
the accused/appellant was arrested on 23.05.2018.
Five (5) empties of 7.62 bore was also stated to have
been recovered from inside the house of the
complainant near the place assigned to him in the
site plan. Another noticeable development in the
investigation was that the weapon of offence was
also recovered from the accused and same was sent
to the FSL for matching it with the empties
recovered in the case. The report in said respect was
received in positive. Complete challan was put in
court after completion of investigation and trial
commenced in the case. On conclusion of
proceedings in trial, the accused/appellant was
convicted and sentenced as follows;

e U/S 324 PPC to five (5) years rigorous imprisonment
along with fine of Rs. 30,000/-, or in default thereof to
suffer three (3) months simple imprisonment.

e U/S 337-D PPC to five (5) years rigorous
imprisonment on two counts along with fine in shape
of compensation of Rs. 200,000/- (two hundred
thousand) for each injured, in default thereof, to suffer
six (6) months simple imprisonment. The same fine
shall be recoverable as land revenue and till its
recovery the accused shall remain in jail as civil
prisoner.

e U/S 337 F (i) PPC to one year rigorous imprisonment
along with fine as Daman of Rs. 10,000/- for each

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
injured, or in default thereof to suffer one month
simple imprisonment.

e U/S 337 F (iii) PPC to one year rigorous
imprisonment along with fine in shape of Daman of
Rs. 10,000/- for each injured, in default thereof to
suffer one month simple imprisonment.

¢ U/S 15 A.A to three (3) years rigorous imprisonment
along with fine of Rs. 10,000/-, or in default thereof to
suffer one month simple imprisonment.

e All the sentences shall run concurrently.

The appellant was extended the benefit of section 382-
BCr.P.C.

4, Feeling aggrieved from his conviction
and sentence, the accused/appellant has filed appeal
before this Court while the complainant has also
filed Criminal Revision No. 62-M of 2019 for
enhancement of the sentences awarded to accused.

5: Learned counsel for the
accused/appellant referred to various pieces of
evidences, recorded in the case and submitted that
the prosecution have failed in proving the case
against accused/appellant. He particularly laid stress
on the fact that the other eye-witnesses particularly
the two injured/eye-witnesses have been abandoned
and the only statement of the complainant was not
sufficient to prove the case against the
accused/appellant beyond reasonable doubt. He
further stated that the recovered empties had not

been sent to the FSL earlier and same have been sent

Nawab (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigqar Ahmad
to the FSL after recovery of the weapon of offence
and therefore the report of the FSL would be of no
help to the prosecution. The learned counsel also
added that since the other two injured had not
appeared before the Court for recording their
statements, therefore conviction of the
accused/appellant for causing injuries to them was
unlawful. He further submitted that motive had not
been proved by the prosecution also.

6. Learned counsel for the complainant
submitted during the course of his arguments that the
accused/appellant was named in a promptly lodged
FIR and the prosecution have been successful in
proving the case against him beyond any shadow of
doubt through direct as well as corroboratory
evidence. He also prayed for enhancing of the
sentence by allowing the Criminal Revision No. 62-
M of 2019.

Ts The learned Astt: A.G. added that not
only the direct evidence but the corroboratory
evidence in the shape of recovery of Kalashnikov,

blood stained earth and a matching FSL report were

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
sufficient to prove the case against the
accused/appellant beyond any shadow of doubt.

8. I have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the parties including learned Astt: A.G.
for the State and perused the record.

9, Charge was framed in the case on
27.08.2018, whereafter the prosecution led its
evidence. Beside the formal witnesses,
Mian Hussain Shah ASI, who had recorded the first
report was examined as PW-3. In his examination-
in-chief, he had narrated the story of lodging of the
report, obtaining the certificates of consciousness of
the complainant as well as the other injured/
eye-witnesses, (which were also exhibited in his
statement) and regarding the recording and affixation
of thumb impressions of the witnesses on the
‘Murasila’. Nothing prejudicial to the case of
prosecution could be brought out from the mouth of
this witness during the course of cross-examination
except that the ‘Murasila’ had not been in his
handwriting. He had also stated that the injury sheets
as well as the consciousness certificates were not in his

handwriting, he had however quickly added that same

Nawab __(S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
were filled by his colleague and these documents bore
his signatures also. He denied the suggestion that all
the documents had not been drafted in his presence.
The ‘Murasila’ may have been drafted on his
dictation which is not that much material so as to
cause prejudice to the case of the prosecution.
Lodging of report in the hospital have even
otherwise been proved in the statement of the
complainant as well as the supporting evidence in
this respect. Dr. Asad Ullah Khan, Medical Officer,
who had examined the injured in the case was
examined as PW-4. In his statement, he has
reproduced the detail description of the injuries
found on the persons of the three (3) injured. He was
cross-examined at length but nothing beneficial to
the accused could be extracted from this witness.
One constable Iftikhar Ahmad who had been
marginal witness to the recovery memo Ex. PW-7/1
was examined as PW-7. The most important piece of
document that was exhibited in his statement was
Ex. PW-7/6, vide which the Investigating Officer
had recovered the weapon of offence (Kalashnikov)

along with a magazine having 03 live rounds of 7.62

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
bore, on the pointation of the accused/appellant.
Nothing prejudicial to the case of the complainant in
the cross-examination of this witness could be
extracted from his mouth. One Gul Roz Khan was
examined as PW-8. This witness stated in his
examination-in-chief that the occurrence took place
on 7" of Ramadan about 5/6 minutes prior to the
opening of fast (°5s)). He stated that after hearing
fire shots, he came out of his house but found no one
present in the street, however someone shouted that
his son had been hit with firing and had been in the
house of their neighbor. He found his son in the
house of Liaqat while lying on a bed (ty),
whereafter he was taken to the DHQ hospital Dagger
and admitted for treatment, where he had also gone
through various surgical procedures but his life was
fortunately saved. He also stated that his statement
was recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C by the local
police, in the hospital on the following day. This
witness was not cross-examined by the counsel for
accused despite having the opportunity to do so. In
the site plan blood has also been recovered from the

same place where Liaqat, son of PW-8 was stated by

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
==

him to have taken refuge. The spot of occurrence,
time and date of occurrence, shifting of the injured to
the hospital and lodging of the report etc seems to be
admitted that is why this witness was not opted to be
cross-examined by the counsel for the accused. The
complainant was examined as PW-9 on 16.02.2019
to the extent of his examination-in-chief. After
recording his statement in the Court, the witness fell
down on the ground and was shifted to the hospital,
therefore cross-examination could not be recorded
on him that very day. He was subsequently cross-
examined on 13.05.2019. The learned counsel for the
appellant, agitated the fact that the complainant had
stated that his house was situated at a distance of
about half kilometer from the place of occurrence, so
how had he been able to hear the noise of heated
debate of his son with the accused/appellant. In this
respect, it is important to be noted that exchange of
hot words between the accused and son of the
complainant was an episode which preceded the
crime. In the FIR as well as in the examination-in-
chief the complainant have expressly stated that he

came out and separated the accused and his son with

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
sls

the help of the other two injured as well. That was
the reason that the son of the complainant namely
Nawaz Sharif had not been cited as eye-witness in
the FIR as well as in the site plane. He had also
stated in the FIR that after some time, the accused
appeared from behind the wall of his house and
started firing at the injured. This is clear from the
evidence of prosecution that there was some
timegape between the incident of exchange of hot
words and the commission of the offence. The said
circumstance, cannot therefore be construed
adversely to the case of the prosecution. This injured
eye-witness has fully stood the test of cross-
examination and no contradiction in respect of the
material particulars of the case could be brought in
the cross-examination of this witness. This PW was
an injured witness, who had fully supported the case
of the prosecution. PWs Nawaz Sharif and
Malak Aman were being abandoned as unnecessary.
Investigating Officer of the case was examined as
PW-10. Nothing beneficial to the accused has been
brought out from the mouth of this witness also. He

has successfully deposed in respect of conducting

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
~12 -

investigation in the case particularly recovery of the
weapon of the offence and sending the same to FSL
for the purpose of matching it with the empties
recovered in the case. The Investigating Officer has
stood firm in the course of cross-examination and no
material contradiction could be brought out from his
mouth. The remaining PWs were _ thereafter
abandoned as either been unnecessary, or won ever,
or having effected compromise on 16.05.2019. In
respect of abandoning of the other PWs, the learned
counsel for the appellant argued that an adverse
inference shall be drawn under Article 129 (g) of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 from  non-
appearance of the injured eye-witnesses in the case,
but the circumstances of the case tells that the actual
dispute existed between the accused and the
complainant and the other injured received injuries
just because of their misfortune, when they were
present at the time of occurrence at the spot. In such
circumstances, when deposing against the
accused/appellant may have resulted in perpetuation
of the enmity, it is understandable as to why they

had not appeared before the Court for testifying

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
zi13)s

against the appellant. From the site plan as well as
statement of PW-8 it is also clear that they were
neighbors of the accused/appellant and in such
circumstances their non-appearance cannot be
construed fatal to the case of prosecution. Even
otherwise, it has been settled by the Hon’ble Apex
Court that if the prosecution succeeds in proving a
case against an accused by producing reliable
evidence, then it cannot be burdened or deemed
bound to produce all the evidence at its disposal.
Reliance in this respect is placed on the case

“Khushi_Muhammad v/s The State and another”

reported as “1983 SCMR 697”, wherein the Hon’ble
Apex Court held as follows;

“13. The learned counsel also laid stress on the
fact that although Gul Muhammad Inspector
Police had introduced a new and different version
of the same case through his report under section
173, Cr.P.C, against 6 persons, five of whom are
not mentioned as accused in the F.I.R, yet the
prosecution did not produce and examine the
witnesses cited in support thereof. This
contention overlooks the fact that it is well
established that it is not incumbent upon the
prosecution to produce each and every witness in
the calendar of witnesses and it can drop or not
examine any witness that it does not consider
necessary.”

In support of same ratio further reliance
can also be placed on the judgments reported as

“2007 SCMR 1519 and 2012 YLR 737.

Nawab (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad

10. Though the weapon of offence was
statedly recovered from the accused/appellant but FSL
report showing that the empties sent by the
Investigating Officer had been fired from the same
weapon, may not be entirely relied upon for the reason
that there has been substantial delay in sending the
empties as well as weapon of offence to the FSL for
analysis and report. Empties were recovered in the
case on 23.05.2018. The accused was arrested and
Kalashnikov was recovered on his pointation on
25.05.2018, but same could not be swiftly dispatched
to the FSL and it had been sent there on 28.05.2018.
This delay could not be sufficiently explained in the
evidence of prosecution. The prosecution has however
proved their case through direct evidence and this
delay in sending of the weapon of offence and empties
to the FSL would not per se, reflect adversely on the
case of the prosecution.

11. The contention of learned counsel for the
appellant that the prosecution has not been able to
prove motive in the case, is not holding any water.
The complainant while deposing as PW-9 had stated in
his examination-in-chief about the existence of the

motive, which statement could not be shattered during

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-15-

the course of cross-examination. As such, the
existence of motive has also been successfully
proved in the case in hand. Regarding the contention
of learned counsel for the appellant, that the
conviction recorded for causing injuries to the other
two injured in the case was unlawful, it is important
to be noted that the prosecution have proved the
causing of injuries to all the three eye-witnesses in
view of the statements of the doctor PW-4, the
statements of witnesses i.e. PW-8 and PW-9
as well as the Investigating Officer PW-10. The
other two injured eye-witnesses could not be
produced in the Court, for establishing the fact that
they had pardoned the accused and that they had not
wanted to prosecute him further. From mere non-
appearance as witness in the case, it could not be
presumed that they had pardoned the accused under
the law. The conviction of the accused/appellant on
the said score was also lawful and do not suffer from
any illegality.

12. For what has been discussed above, the
appeal in hand is found to be without force and same

is according dismissed.

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
“6 <=

13. So far as Criminal Revision No. 62-M
of 2019 filed by the complainant for enhancement of
the sentence is concerned, circumstances of the case
show that the accused/appellant was first offender
having no criminal history before the occurrence.
Heated debate had also taken place before the
occurrence, therefore in such circumstances, I find
the sentences awarded to the accused/appellant by
the learned trial Court as reasonable and justified,
which warrant no interference. Criminal Revision
No. 62-M of 2019 is also dismissed accordingly.
