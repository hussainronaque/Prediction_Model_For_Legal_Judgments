ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J:-This single judgment in
the instant criminal appeal by convict/appellant,
Muneeb Hassan, is also directed to dispose of
Criminal Revision No.119-P/2018, under section 439
Cr.P.C for enhancement of the sentence of life
imprisonment awarded to the convict/appellant and
Criminal Appeal No.862-P/2018 filed by appellant
Abdul Qayum against acquittal of co-accused
Muhammad Ibrahim as both the criminal appeals and

criminal revision pertain to the same case vide F.LR
No.79 dated 07.12.2012 under sections 302/34 PPC
registered in Police Station Parmoli, District Swabi.

2. It is the case of prosecution that Tariq Ahmad
ASI on receiving information regarding the
occurrence rushed to Civil Hospital Kalu Khan
where complainant Abdul Qayum present with his
deceased maternal uncle Aurangzeb reported the
matter to the police to the effect that he alongwith his
maternal uncle Aurangzeb (deceased), Ayaz son of
Wisal and Tahir son of Khan Sher his co-villagers,
after Asar prayer were present in front of the Hujra
of deceased Aurangzeb situated in Mohallah Choora
Khel Village Shewa and were busy in gossiping, in
the meantime, at about 16:05 hours, accused Yasir
son of Noor-ul-Basar (absconding co-accused),
Muneeb son of Abu-Al-Hassan and Ibrahim son of
Mugtadir his co-villagers duly armed with firearms
came there and all the three accused started firing
upon deceased Aurangzeb with the intention to
commit his gatl-i-amd, as a result whereof he was hit
and injured. They took the deceased then injured to
the hospital Kalu Khan but on the way he succumbed
to his injuries. Motive behind the occurrence was

stated to be previous blood feud enmity between the
r™

parties. Beside the complainant the occurrence was
witnessed by Ayaz and Tahir. Hence, the case was
registered against the accused for the commission of
the offence.

3. After registration of the case, complete challan
was submitted in the Court. Accused Ibrahim applied
to the Court for his bail before arrest which was
recalled on 19.12.2012. Accused Muhammad
Ibrahim was summoned, who appeared before the
Court on bail. Statement of Muhammad Iqbal DFC
recorded as SW-1. In the light of the statement of the
DFC proceedings under section 512 Cr.P.C were
initiated against absconding co-accused Muneeb
Hassan and Yasir. Accused Muhammad Ibrahim
appeared before the Court on 29.03.2013 and
formalities of section 265-C Cr.P.C was complied
with. Formal charge against accused Muhammad
Ibrahim was framed to which he pleaded not guilty
and claimed trial.

4. During trial, accused Muneeb Hassan was also
arrested by the local police in the present case. The
prosecution submitted supplementary challan against
him. Accused Muneeb Hassan was produced in

custody and the provision of section 265-C Cr.P.C
oN

was complied with. Joint charge against accused
Muhammad Ibrahim and Muneeb Hassan was
framed to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed
trial. The prosecution was directed to produce its
evidence. In support of its case, the prosecution
produced and examined thirteen (13) witnesses.

5. After prosecution closed its evidence,
statements of the accused were recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein, they refuted allegations
of the prosecution. Accused Muneeb Hassan did not
opt to be examined on Oath nor desired to produce
evidence in his defence while accused Muhammad
Ibrahim wished to be examined on Oath and also
produce evidence in his defence. Therefore, the
statement of accused Muhammad Ibrahim was
recorded under section 340(2) Cr.P.C whereas
statements of Noor Hussain and Ayaz Ali were
recorded as DW-1 and DW-2. Having heard
arguments of learned APP assisted by learned
counsel for the complainant and learned counsel for
accused, the learned trial Court/Additional Sessions
Judge-I, Swabi, rendered the impugned judgment
dated 29.09.2018, whereby, appellant Muneeb

Hassan was convicted u/s 303(b) PPC for committing
murder of Aurangzeb (deceased) and sentenced to
undergo imprisonment for life as Ta’zeer. He shall
also be liable to pay compensation under section
544-A Cr.P.C to the tune of Rs.300,000/-(rupees
three lacs) to the legal heirs of the deceased. The
same shall be recoverable as arrear of land revenue
and in default of payment of such compensation the
convict shall suffer further S.I for six (06) months.
Benefit of section 382 (B) Cr.P.C was also extended
to appellant Muneeb Hassan, hence criminal appeal
for his acquittal by convicted accused/appellant, and
criminal revision for enhancement of the punishment
of sentence by the petitioner. The learned trial Court
acquitted co-accused Muhammad Ibrahim by giving
him the benefit of doubt, hence criminal appeal
No.862-P/2018 was filed by appellant/complainant
Abdul Qayum for setting aside the impugned
judgment and the conviction of acquitted co-accused
Muhammad Ibrahim.

6. Arguments of learned counsel for the
appellant and learned AAG assisted by learned
counsel for the complainant heard; and record gone

through with their valuable assistance.

7. Admittedly there is intense enmity between the
parties which was alleged in the F.LR and as well as
during trial by the PWs. The witnesses are closely
related to the deceased. Complainant Abdul Qayyum
(PW-10) is the nephew while Tahir Zaman (PW-11)
is the paternal cousin of the deceased Aurangzeb.
They are closely related to the deceased. They can be
well regarded as interested witnesses. They are
locked in blood feud since long therefore their
testimony is to be taken with great care and caution.

8. It is the case of prosecution that on the
eventful day at 16:05 hours they were present in front
of the Hujra of the deceased and were busy in
gossiping, in the meantime, appellant Muneeb
Hassan alongwith the acquitted co-accused
Muhammad Ibrahim and the absconding co-accused
Yasir came there duly armed with firearms and
started indiscriminate firing at the deceased, as result
whereof the deceased got hit and sustained injuries.
If we look at the site plan the Hujra of the deceased
has been shown comprising of rooms, veranda and
courtyard as well. There was no occasion for the
deceased and the PWs to be present in the

thoroughfare for the purpose of chatting when the
gate of the Hujra is quite closed to the point on which
the deceased has been shown to be present at the
time of occurrence. Otherwise when they are locked
in such intense enmity the presence of the deceased
and the PWs for the above referred purpose is not
appealing to prudent mind. If we have a look at the
site plan the deceased has been shown on one side of
the road while the complainant and PWs have been
shown at the other side of the road. If they were
present for the purpose of gossiping then they should
have been closed to each other instead of standing at
a considerable distance from each other. Another
feature of the case is ages of the PWs and the
deceased. The deceased was aged about 75/76 years
and the complainant Abdul Qayum (PW-10) is aged
about 47/48 years while PW Tahir Zaman (PW-11) is
aged about 38 years. They are from different age
groups and their assemblage at that point of time for
the purpose of gossiping is also repellent to common
sense keeping in view the difference in between their
ages. The house of the complainant is situated at a
distance of 300/400 meters from the Masjid as well
as from the Hujra of the deceased where they offered

Asar prayer before the occurrence. Likewise, the
dy

Mosque is also available closed to the house of
another eyewitness Tahir Zaman (PW-11) and he has
stated that he normally perform his prayer in the
Mosque of “Awan” which is near to our house and
he used to perform his prayers in routine over there.
The prosecution has tried to show the presence of
these PWs at the relevant time but in our view the
same has not been proved for the reason that both the
witnesses are residing far away at a considerable
distance from the Hujra of the deceased. The
complainant has further stated that they were present
in Hujra from noon time till Asar time while on the
contrary Tahir Zaman (PW-11) has stated that he was
present in the Hujra of the deceased since morning.
None from the Mosque even the Pesh Amam has
been examined only to prove the presence of the
PWs alongwith the deceased at the time of Asar
prayers, at least to the extent of their presence of the
PWs to be present at the time of Asar prayers. The
story of the prosecution on which the entire
superstructure of the prosecution case was erected
appears to be falls and does not stand to reason.
Indeed the prosecution story must be natural,

coherent and shall not lead to any other interpretation
for the reason that otherwise both the witnesses are
residing in different houses situated in same village
but away from the place of occurrence. Allegedly the
report was made within 45 minutes of the occurrence
but it is in the statement of Tahir Zaman (PW-11)
eyewitness that it consumed three hours from the
occurrence till lodging of the FIR. Therefore, the
time of the report as alleged by the prosecution
seems to be incorrect and that is why inspite of the
fact the deceased was dead. He was not taken to the
police station and was shifted to Civil Hospital Kalu
Khan. Therefore, we hold no hesitation in holding
that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the
presence of the PWs. Reliance is placed on
“MUHAMMAD _IRSHAD and_another..Vs.. THE

STATE” (1999 SCMR 1030), wherein it is held that;

“It is evident from these circumstances that
the complainant party was inimically disposed
towards the appellant. The eye-witness
examined by the prosecution are closely
related to one and other and rule of prudence
required that there should have been some
independent corroboration available for
placing implicit reliance on their testimony
but the same is lacking and it would be highly
unsafe to act upon the uncorroborated
testimony of eye-witness examined by the
prosecution, particularly when it is full of
material contradictions”
10

9. The above statements show that the occurrence
had not taken place in the mode and manner as put
forth by the prosecution. The above statements are
full of contradictions and improvements, are not
confidence inspiring and trust worthy. The
prosecution has been miserably failed to establish the
presence of complainant (PW-10) and eyewitness
(PW-11) at the spot. It seems that the occurrence is
un-witness one. Reliance is placed on 1999 SCMR
1220, titled “Muhammad Khan & other..vs..The
State”, wherein it is held that;

“It is axiomatic and universally recognized
principle of law that conviction must be founded
on unimpeachable evidence and certainty of guilt
and hence any doubt that arises in the
prosecution case must be resolved in favour of the
accused. It is, therefore, imperative for the Court
to examine and consider all the relevant events
preceding and leading to the occurrence so as to
arrive at a correct conclusion. Where the
evidence examined by the prosecution is found
inherently unreliable, improbable and against
natural course of human conduct, then the
conclusion must be that the prosecution failed to
prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It would be
unsafe to rely on the ocular evidence which has
been moulded, changed and improved step by step
so as to fit in with the other evidence on record. It
is obvious that truth and falsity of the prosecution
case can only be judged when the entire evidence

and circumstances are scrutinized and examined
11

in its correct perspective. It is unfortunate that
neither the trial Court nor the High Court
thoroughly studied the record so as to reach
correct conclusion, rather they dealt with the
matter in a very cursory manner which naturally
resulted in miscarriage of justice. As noted above,
the eye-witness account in this case is so
unreasonable and inherently improbable that no

amount of corroboration can rehabilitate it”

Further reliance is placed on “Mst, SUGHRA
BEGUM and another..Vs.QAISER PERVEZ and
others” (2015 SCMR 1142).

10. In this case three persons are charged for
effective firing at the deceased with firearms. During
the spot inspection 18 empties of Kalashnikov were
secured from point-A shown in the site plan which
has been shown in front of the accused. The
investigation officer has admitted that Kalashnikov
ejects its empties towards its right side. When three
persons are charged for firing without specifying the
role of each accused and when the empties were not
sent to the expert by the investigating officer. It can
be safely assumed that it is doing of one man by
looking into the dimension of the injuries i.e. all the
entry wounds are of 1/4 x 1/4 inches in size. It

appears to be doing of one person. In this regard
12

reliance is placed on “titled Farman Ali and 03

others...Vs...The State” (PLD 1980 Supreme
Court 201), It is an admitted position that an
ordinary magazine of Kalashnikov accommodates 30
rounds. Another words a single person equipped with
Kalashnikov can inflict as many as 30 firearm
injuries.

11. The Investigation Officer (PW-13) recovered
18 empties of 7.62 bore from the spot but he has not
sent the same to the FSL for opinion that whether it
was fired from one or different weapons. PW-13 in
his cross examination stated that “J have not sent the
empties to the FSL in order to find out that whether
they were fired from one weapon or from different
weapons either of the same bore or of different
bores.” The non sending of the alleged crime empties
to the FSL makes the same as doubtful and same
cannot be relied upon for purpose of conviction.
Moreso, this Piece of evidence is a corroborative
one and in a case where direct evidence fails,
corroborative piece of evidence is of no avail as in
the instant case direct evidence of PWs have already
been disbelieved. In a case titled “Ghulam Akbar

and another v. The State” (2008 SCMR 1064) it

was observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that
law required that empty recovered from the spot
should be sent to the laboratory without any delay,
failing which such recovery evidence is not free
from doubt and could not be used against the
accused. Though the trial Court has held that the
appellant has remained absconder and that the
abscondance was taken as additional evidence against
the appellant. Yet another co-accused Yasir is also
absconding. He is still at large. So abscondance alone
in our view would not be sufficient enough to hold an
accused responsible for the commission of the offence
when otherwise the substantive evidence has been
disbelieved against him.

12. The other accused/respondent namely .
Muhammad Ibrahim in Criminal Appeal No.862-
P/2018 was acquitted by the learned trial Court on the
plea of Alibi which was taken by him at the earliest
and the same was believed and he was extended the
benefit of doubt. He has also produced defence
witnesses namely Noor Hussain as DW-1 and Ayaz
Ali as DW-2.

13. The prosecution has failed to prove the

presence of the PWs. We have disbelieved the
presence of the PWs on the spot at the relevant time
and the mode and manner of the occurrence,
therefore, Muhammad Ibrahim has rightly been
acquitted by the learned trial Court. The plea of Alibi
accused/respondent Muhammad Ibrahim also
indicates that the witnesses are not truthful and
confidence inspiring.

14. There is a background of blood feud between
the parties. It appears from the record that an
attempt has been made to implicate as many persons
as possible in the crime and the prosecution has
thrown its net too wide. Where innocent persons
were found to have been dishonestly implicated in
crime the Court was entitled to acquit even those
accused who were not proved to have been falsely
implicated. Reliance is placed on “ZAAB DIN and
another Vs. The STATE” (PLD 1986 Peshawar .
188). Per tendency of social set up of this Country
too, at times, people do charge innocents person of
the family amongst the guilty persons for different
reasons. By no viewpoint, the ocular, circumstantial
as well as the medical evidence would suggest that
the crime was doing of all the accused. In this

regard, reliance is placed on the case of “Sohni_Vs.
Bahaduri_etc” (PLD 1965 SC 111), wherein the

august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held that;

“In this case the village where the occurrence
took place was torn by faction and therefore,
false implication of innocent persons cannot be
altogether ruled out. Furthermore, according to
Doctor Muhammad Yamin Khan out of the 9
injuries found one Maulo deceased 2 were
contused wounds, 1 incised wound, I was
abrasion and the rest were contusions. Death was
due to the shock and compression of brain
caused by blood clots due to fracture of skull
which was caused by injuries Nos. 1 and 2 that
were found on the deceased. Most of the
remaining injuries were on the leg of the
deceased. In view of the number and nature of
injuries one may legitimately ask whether this
could possibly have been the result of assault by 6
accused persons or that they could have been
easily caused by two or three persons. Viewing all
the circumstances we are satisfied that the High
Court was right in insisting on some
corroboration of the evidence of the
eye-witnesses connecting the accused with the
crime. As such corroboration was lacking, the
High Court was justified in giving the benefit of
doubt to the accused persons.

15. Needless to say that because of the exaggerated
number of culprits in the case and attributing them
same role of indiscriminate firing at the deceased, the
available prosecution evidence would not be sufficient
to identify the guilty persons by separating the
innocents while the prosecution has failed to discharge
its burden of proving the case against all accused in the
alleged mode and manner. In other words, finding of
truth is impossible in circumstances of the case and

therefore the famous legal maxim relating to the
16

criminal justice would well fit here that “it is better
that ten guilty persons be acquitted rather than one
innocent persons be convicted’. Hon’ble Supreme

Court of Pakistan in the case of ‘Muhammad Zaman

Vs. The State and another’ (2014 SCMR 749) has

acquitted accused Muhammad Zaman who alongwith
16 persons were charged for murder of two deceased
persons besides causing injuries to PWs. Relevant

portion of said judgment reads as follows:

“...The number of assailants in the
circumstances of the case appears to have
been exaggerated. It seems that most of the
persons including the respondents have been
charged because of previous enmity. The
tragedy may have been enacted by Mukhtar
who has gone into hiding or Munawar who
has been acquitted because the deceased
Shabbir was alleged to have illicit relations
with their sister, but many who have no
visible nexus with this part of the story have
also been roped in. It is so because it is
customary in this part of the country to
throw wide the net of implication to rope in
all those who could possibly pursue the case
or do something to save the skin of the one
who is innocent or who is actually
responsible for the commission of the crime.
The Court, therefore, is required to exercise
much greater care and circumspection while
appraising evidence.”

16. This Court too through judgment rendered in

the case of “Malak Amir Sultan and two others Vs.

The State and another” (2018 MLD 1635, Peshawar)

has acquitted three real brothers who were charged for

murder of a single deceased by holding that:
17

“....ZAt reflects that it is the job of one person
but in order to throw the net wide, the
number of accused has been exaggerated as
three brothers and two unknown accused
have been charged.....”

17. It is a cardinal principle criminal justice that the
benefit of even a slight doubt is to be extended in
favour of the accused. In this regard reliance is placed
on the case of “Fazal Muhammad Vs. Zia ul Hag and
another” [2016 PCr.LJ Note 30 (Peshawar)],

wherein it has been held by this Court that;

“Prosecution was bound to prove its case
beyond any reasonable shadow of doubt; if
any reasonable doubt would arise in the
prosecution case, benefit of the same must be
extended to accused, not as a grace or
concession, but as a matter of right. Better to
acquit hundred culprits, than convicting one
innocent soul. Acquitting by error, would be
better than conviction by error.”

18. In views of above and considering overall
circumstances of the case, criminal appeal No.846-
P/2018 filed by appellant-convict, namely, Muneeb
Hassan is accepted; and the impugned judgment dated
29.09.2018 of the learned trial Court, together with
conviction of the appellant-convict and sentences
awarded to him, is set aside; and appellant-convict
Muneeb Hassan is acquitted of the charges. He be set

free, forthwith, if not required in any other case.
19. Consequent upon acceptance of the criminal
appeal (Cr.A No.846-P/2018) and acquittal of
appellant-convict, namely, Muneeb Hassan, Criminal
Revision No.119-P/2018 by petitioner for enhancement
of the sentence and Criminal Appeal No.862-P/2018
filed by appellant/complainant Abdul Qayum against
acquittal of respondent/accused Muhammad Ibrahim

are dismissed.
