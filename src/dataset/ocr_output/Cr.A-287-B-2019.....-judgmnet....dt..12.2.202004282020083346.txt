KK
SAHIBZADA_ ASADULLAH,_J.- This appeal is
directed against the judgment dated 14.9.2019, rendered
by learned Sessions Judge, Bannu, in case FIR No.269
dated 30.11.2010, under Sections 302/324/34 PPC,
police station Ghoriwala, District Bannu, whereby the
appellant Safid Ullah has been convicted under Section
302(b) PPC and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for
life. He was also held liable to pay Rs.8,00,000/- lacs as
compensation to the legal heirs of deceased Barkat Ali in
terms of Section 544-A, Cr.P.C. or in default thereto to
further undergo four months simple imprisonment,
similarly, accused Imran Ali Shah has been convicted
under Section 324 PPC and sentence to suffer seven

years rigorous imprisonment and was also held liable to
-2-

pay fine of Rs.1,00,000/- or in default thereof to further
undergo two months simple imprisonment. Benefit of
Section 382-B, Cr.P.C. was extended to both the

convicts.

2. Brief history of the prosecution case, as
reflected from the FIR Ex. PW 4/1, registered on the
basis of murasila Ex. PW 3/1, is that on 30.11.2010,
complainant Adnan Ali Khan (PW-5), in injured
condition, at about 2150 hours, brought the dead body of
his brother Barkat Ali Khan to Civil Hospital, Bannu and
lodged a report to Miran Shah S.J (PW-3) to the effect
that on the same night he was present in his house when
his brother Barkat Ali Khan informed him that accused
Safaid Ullah and Imran had snatched some articles from
him, so he wanted to make a complaint to their parents;
that complainant (PW-5), Barkat Ali Khan and one Dil
Robaz Khan (PW-6) proceeded towards the house of
accused, however, at about 2030 hours, when they
reached near the house of one Rizwan, there accused
Safaid Ullah and Imran emerged in their front, accused
Safaid Ullah made firing at Barkat Ali, whereas accused
Imran fired at complainant (PW-5). As a result of firing
of the accused, they both were hit and got injured. The
accused decamped from the spot after commission of the
offence. While shifting both the injured to the hospital,

Barkat Ali succumbed to his injuries on the way. PW-3
-3-

also prepared injury sheet Ex. PW 3/2 and inquest report
Ex. PW 3/3 of the deceased, injury sheet Ex. PW 3/4 of
injured complainant PW-5 and thereafter, sent the dead
body to the mortuary for postmortem examination, where
Dr. Khalid Mehmood (PW-7) conducted autopsy on the
dead body of the deceased, whereas injured PW was
medically examined by Dr. Muhammad Ismail PW-9.

3. Initially, the accused absconded, therefore,
proceedings under Section 512, Cr.P.C. were conducted
against them. After arrest of the accused and completion
of investigation by Muhammad Hanif S.I. (PW-8),
complete challan was submitted against them to the
Court of learned Sessions Judge, Bannu, where at the
commencement of the trial the prosecution produced and
examined as many as twelve (12) witnesses, whereafter,
accused were examined under section 342, Cr.P.C.,
wherein they denied the allegations, professed innocence
and stated to have falsely been implicated in the present
case, however, neither they opted to be examined under
section 340(2), Cr.P.C., nor wished to produce evidence
in their defence. The learned trial Court, on conclusion of
the trial, convicted the appellants vide impugned
judgment dated 14.9.2019, and sentenced them as
mentioned above, hence the instant appeal.

4. Arguments heard and record perused.

5. It is the case of prosecution that on the
eventful night the complainant was present in his house
when his brother Barkat Ali Khan informed him that
accused Safaid Ullah and Imran had snatched some
articles from him, so he wanted to make a complaint to
their parents, he in the company of his brother Barkat Ali
Khan and one Dil Robaz Khan (PW-6) proceeded
towards the house of accused, while proceeding to the
house of the accused/appellants, it was at 2030 hours,
when in front of the house of one Rizwan, the parties
came across. On seeing them, the accused/appellant
Safaid Ullah made firing at Barkat Ali, whereas accused
Imran fired at complainant (PW-5). As a result of firing
of the accused, they both were hit and got injured,
wyhereas, Barkat Ali, on his way to the hospital lost his
life. In the instant case, since the ocular account of the
incident was furnished by the complainant (PW-5) and
Dil Robaz Khan (PW-6), therefore, it is important to re-
appraise their evidence for the purpose of sifting the
grain from chaff and seeking independent corroboration
from other reliable evidence.

6. While scanning the evidence of complainant
PW-5, we found that his testimony is in line with the FIR
and fits with the circumstances of the case. Though he
faced the rigors of lengthy cross-examination, but

nothing favourable to the accused could be extracted.
-5-

The learned counsel for the defence stressed that the
prosecution did not bring on record the description of
snatched articles and the purpose was to register a
complaint to their parents in this respect and to him,
when the articles taken were not proved on record, then
the purpose to kill does not appeal to a prudent mind. He
further contended that how the accused came to know
that the complainant was coming towards their house and.
that why the appellant approached them where in fact it
was the complainant side to resort to aggression, as it
was them to settle the scores. The learned counsel further
contended that the inter se distance between the
assailants/appellants and the deceased was more than SiX
paces and the wounds carrying charring marks belies the
story of the prosecution and it was lastly contended that
how the witnesses identified the accused when the
darkness had prevailed. The contentions of the learned
counsel for the defence that it was the complainant side
to settle the score, is not appealable as the matter was not
that grave to urge the complainant side to go and revenge
rather this was an attempt on the part of the complainant
to go and register the complaint and if possible to recover
the articles taken. The place of occurrence is established
as the Investigating Officer recovered blood stained earth
from the place of the deceased and even the spot could -

not be disputed. Yes, the time of occurrence is 2030

-6-

hours and there is the possibility that darkness was
prevailed, but when PW Dil Robaz was examined, he
stated that at the time of occurrence, an electric bulb was
installed on the adjoining house which facilitated him to
identify the accused, even the prosecution could not
dislodge this stance of the witness. This is admitted on
record that the parties are co-villagers and were known to
one another and the inter se distances between the two
sides were not so great to exclude the possibility of
identification. The complainant has given specific role to
both of accused and the stance of the learned counsel for
the defence that one of the wound on person of the
deceased was having charring marks and that the inter se
distance between the parties belie the story of the
prosecution. This is on record that both the sides were
approaching one another and we cannot exclude the
possibility that the deceased received one fire entry
wound from the distance given in the site plan and the
other when they came further close to the deceased.

7. The learned counsel for defence contended
that the eyewitness namely Dil Robaz was not present on
the spot and even his presence on the spot is not
appealable as he was not connected with the alleged
motive and that he was a chance and procure witness.
The prosecution witnesses were thoroughly cross-

examined, but the defence could not succeed to discredit
-7-

their testimony and to doubt their presence on the spot.
Dil Robaz was examined as PW-6 and he explained that
his house and that of the complainant are connected with
a small door and by the time he came to the house of the
complainant when the incident was narrated by the
deceased to his brother and he too accompanied them to
agitate the matter with the parents of the appellants. The
defence could not establish otherwise. Nothing could be
brought from the mouth of this witness in favour of the
appellants despite searching cross examination and even
no mala fide was suggested in respect of false
implication of the accused. The accused were specifically
charged and the role of firing was attributed to both of
the appellants. The deceased and injured were rushed to
the hospital where the matter was reported to the local
police without loss of time and the shifting to the hospital
was so sudden which occasioned no chance of
consultation and deliberations to the complainant for
bringing a false charge.

In case titled Syed Azhar Hussain Shah and
another Vs. The State and others (2019 SCMR 33. 7), it
was held that:

As regards the merits of the case of the
appellant we have found that the
occurrence in this case had taken place
in broad daylight, an FIR in that
respect had been lodged with sufficient
promptitude and the appellant had been

named in the FIR as the principal
perpetrator of the alleged offences and

-8-

firearm injuries on the thigh, penis and

below the belly of the victim had been

attributed to him therein. The eye-

witnesses produced by the prosecution

included the injured victim namely

Syed Ahsan Raza Shah (PW1) and the

ocular account furnished by the victim

and Syed Muhammad Raza (PW2) was

consistent and the same had found full

support from the medical evidence.
8. Dr. Khalid Mahmood M.O. (PW-7)
conducted autopsy on the dead body of deceased Barkat
Ali, on 30.11.2010 at 1015 hours. In his opinion, the
deceased died due to FAI to larynx and trachea and
major vessels of neck leading suffocation and death. He
pen down the probable duration between injuries and
death, within forty minutes and between death and
postmortem, 1-3 hours.
9. Muhammad Hanif S.J (PW-8) had
investigated the case after receipt of FIR. He prepared
site plan Ex. PB on the pointation of eyewitness Dil
Robaz. He secured blood through cotton from the place
of deceased Barkat Ali and sealed the same in parcel
No.1, prepared recovery memo Ex. PW 8/I in presence
of marginal witnesses. He conducted house search of the
accused vide memo Ex. PW 8/2 which is correctly signed
by him. He stated that he was present on the spot when
the postmortem documents and MLC report were
produced by constable. He examined the PWs. He

verified the site plan from complainant and no changes

were made therein. To this effect he gave a note with red

-9-

ink on the site plan Ex. PW 8/3. He sent the blood
secured through cotton to FSL and obtained the report
Ex. PK. He placed on the list of legal heirs of deceased
Ex. PW 8/6 on the file.

10. After scanning the entire evidence, this Court
came to the conclusion that the prosecution has
established its case to the hilt against the appellant
Safaidullah, as the witnesses remained consistent on all
material aspects of the case though the trial Court while
appreciating the evidence on file drawn a different
conclusion in respect of the accused Imran Ali Shah, by
awarding lesser sentence. We are eager to scan the
evidence as to whether the findings of the trial Court
were correct in that respect or that the trial Court fell into
error by taking another view, though in FIR, section
302/324/34 PPC were inserted and charge against the
appellant was framed under the captioned sections of
law, but the trial Court keeping in view the specific
charge of the appellants bifurcated the case and
sentenced one of the accused under section 302 PPC,
whereas the other under section 324 PPC. In order to
reach a correct conclusion, we deem it appropriate to see
the contents of the FIR and the role played by each
accused to determine as to whether the accused share
common intention or not. It has never been the case of

prosecution that the accused/appe!lants had come with

-10-

the intention to commit the murder of the deceased, as
none of the party was of the knowledge that the other
was coming with intention to kill rather this was a chance
encounter where both the appellants were charged with
specific injuries on persons of the deceased and the
complainant. The approach of the trial Court was correct,
but the trial Court failed to appreciate the evidence
against the accused Imran Ali Shah, as this was the
prosecution to prove the charge against him. The
prosecution was supposed to establish on record the
injury on the person of the complainant by producing the
concerned doctor who examined the injured and prepared
his medico legal report. We are surprised to see that in
this particular case, a deviation was made from the
established practice as the prosecution could not
establish on record that who was the doctor who
examined the complainant in the hospital. The medico
legal report has been exhibited as Ex. PW 9/1, from one
Dr. Muhammad Ismail, who was examined as PW-9,
who stated that “on 30.11.2010, Dr. Qamar Zaman was
on emergency duty but due to some inevitable
circumstances, he was not on duty and instead of him, I
was assigned to perform emergency duty”. The
statement of this witness surprised us that if he was the
witness who examined the injured in the hospital and

prepared the medico legal report, why on the medico

-ll-

legal report, he put his signature “For Dr. Qamar
Zaman’, Had he prepared the medico legal report and
examined the injured himself, he would have stated that
it was he who examined the injured and prepared his
medico legal report and would have put his signature
thereon. This witness was cross examined where he
stated that “Except the direction by MS Sher Jan for
issuance of discharge slip and OPD chit, I have not
signed any documents today produced by me before the
Court’. This witness further stated that he did know that
whether the patient was examined prior to his report or
not. The prosecution submitted challan, but in the
calendar of witnesses PW-9 Dr. Muhammad Ismail find
mention nowhere and it surprises that how the
prosecution came to know that this was the doctor who
examined the complainant at the time when he was
brought to the hospital. The defence went on to say that
the complainant Andaz Ali was serving in the hospital
and that PW-9 was his close relative. Keeping in view
the conduct of PW-9, this Court reaches nowhere that the
injury on the person of the complainant has not been
established and even the medico legal report could not
lead this Court to hold that in fact the complainant was
injured and that he was examined by the doctor in the
hospital. While assessing the role of the co-accused

Imran Ali Shah and his specific charge for the injury

-12-

caused on person of the complainant, it can safely be
hold that the charge against the co-accused/Imran Ali
Shah has not been established beyond reasonable doubt
and even otherwise the trial Court hold both the

appellants responsible for the injuries specified to them

by excluding the common intention.

In case titled Manzoor_Ahmed Shah_Vs.

State (2019 SCMR 2000), it was held that:-

“The alleged recoveries affected from the
appellants during the investigation were
legally inconsequential because no crime-
empty had been secured from the place of
occurrence connecting the recovered
firearms with the alleged offences. In the
absence of proof of the alleged motive
sharing of common intention by the present
appellants with their co-convict namely
Mubarik Ali for the purposes of killing two
persons and injuring two others in the
present incident has been found by us to be
quite suspect. It appears that something
had happened at the spot leading to the
present occurrence and it could well be
that in such a sudden occurrence every
accused person might have been
responsible for his own individual act. In
these circumstances, particularly when
there is no evidence available regarding
sharing of common intention by the present
appellants with their co-convict namely
Mubarik Ali, we have found it difficult to
sustain the convictions and sentences of the
appellants vis-a-vis the murder of Kashifa
Bibi who had not been harmed by the
present appellants at all”.

In case titled Qudratullah Vs. State (2017

PLD Peshawar 5), it was held that:

“Leaving apart the arguments advanced
at the bar as any discussion thereon may
prejudice the case of co-accused, suffice
it to say that the appellant was charged
-13-

for sharing common intention with
absconding co-accused in the commission
of crime, but no overt act towards
commission of the offence has been
attributed to him as no evidence
regarding his active participation in the
crime is available on the file. Insofar as
theme of section 34, P.P.C. is concerned,
it deals with the acts done by several
persons in furtherance of common
intention. Neither it is a punitive section,
nor does enact a rule of evidence but
mainly relates to joint liability. It simply
means that if two or more persons
intentionally commit an offence jointly
which amounts to as if each of them had
committed it individually and they will
have to share the consequences jointly
subject to the proof that at the relevant
time each one of them remained involved
in the commission of the offence e.g. mere
presence at the spot ipso facto would not
be sufficient to hold a person vicariously
liable and sufficient evidence should be
available to prove the factum of sharing
common intention even prior to the
commission of offence. It must be proved
that the offence was committed in concert
pursuant to the prearranged plan. The
inference of common intention should
never be reached unless it is a necessary
inference deducible from the
circumstances of the case. All that is
necessary is either to have direct proof or
prior concert, or proof of circumstances
which necessarily lead to that inference
or the incriminating facts must be
incompatible with the innocence of the
accused and incapable of explanation on
any other reasonable hypothesis.

The overall assessment of the prosecution
case brings this Court to conclude that the prosecution
has miserably failed to bring home charge against
accused Imran Ali Shah.

11. For the reasons mentioned hereinabove, this

appeal is partially allowed, the impugned judgment of

Na

wy

-14-

conviction dated 14.9.2019, rendered by learned Sessions
Judge, Bannu to the extent of Imran Ali Shah is set aside,
however, to the extent of respondent No.2, Safaidullah is
maintained, consequently, appellant Imran Ali Shah is
acquitted of the charges levelled against him. He be set-
at-liberty forthwith, if not required in any other case.

12. Above are the detailed reasons of our short
order of the even date.
