State-NAB (by)___ Syed Azeem Dad. ADPG

MUSARRAT HILAL J.- This criminal appeal is
directed against the judgment dated 17.03.2018 delivered
by Judge, Accountability Court-III, Peshawar in
Reference No.05 of 2016, whereby appellant, Ayaz-ul-
Haq, has been convicted and sentenced under Section 9
(a) (ix) (x) punishable under Section 10 of the National
Accountability Ordinance, 1999 to undergo seven years
R.I and fine of Rs.15 Millions in default whereof he shall
further undergo 02 years S.I. It is also directed by the
learned Judge, Accountability Court that the amount of

fine is to be recovered under Section 33 (a) of NAO,
1999. Benefit under Section 382-B Cr.P.C. was extended

to him.

2. Brief facts of the case are that Reference
dated 16.12.2015 (Ex.PW-14/35) forwarded by Director
General NAB, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was based on the
investigation Report dated 13.12.2015 (Ex.PW-14/34)
compiled by I.O and Assistant Director Muhammad
Shafique. According to the investigation report, NAB
authorities received complaints from victims, and
accordingly an inquiry vide order dated 24.03.2015 was
ordered by DG, NAB, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa against the
nominated accused Ayaz-ul-Haq and others. In the
inquiry, accused was found allegedly involved in
collection of money under the garb of mudariba business
and for the purpose lured people to handover their money
on the promise that they shall be given exorbitant profit
at the rate of Rs.4000/- to Rs.5500/- per month per lakh
on the investment which payment of profit was stopped
after few months. The detail of claims against the

accused is as under:-
Amount of investment

Name and Parentage of Claimant
Fida-Ullah S/O Muhammad Tayab | Rs.58,50,000/-

Muhammad Farooq S/O Qari | Rs.3,00,000/-
Abdul Nasir

Muhammad Nazeef S/O Syed | Rs.10,00,000/-

Riaz Muhammad S/O Aqiq Ahmad | Rs.4,00,000/-

Inam-Ullah S/O Abdul Wahab

Roshan Khan S/O Ziarat Gull

Total

Rs.4,00,000/-

Rs.5,00,000/-

Rs.84,50,000/-

The investigation report concludes that the accused was

running the whole affair illegitimately based on fraud
and dishonestly thus depriving claimants of their hard
earned savings amounting to Rs.8.45 millions
constituting an offence u/s 9 (a) punishable u/s-10 of the

Ordinance.

3. After completion of investigation, the
appellant was charge sheeted to which he did not plead
guilty and claimed trial. At the trial, in order to prove its
case, the prosecution examined 15 witnesses in all. The
appellant, at the close of prosecution evidence, was
examined under Section 342, Cr.P.C, who denied the
allegations leveled against him. After hearing arguments,

learned trial Court, vide judgment dated 17.03.2018,
impugned herein, convicted and sentenced the appellant
as mentioned above. Feeling dissatisfied, the appellant
has preferred the instant appeal.
Arguments heard and record perused.

4. The accused-appellant has been charged by
the NAB on the allegation of corruption and corrupt
practices as defined under Section 9 of the National
Accountability Ordinance, 1999.

In order to see how this case has arisen, some
necessary facts need to be stated. The accused-appellant
was allegedly involved in collection of money under the
garb of mudariba business after luring or enticing people
to hand over their money to the accused on the promise
that they would get exorbitant monthly profit and after
giving the due profit for some months, the same was
stopped and thereby fraudulently
misappropriated/embezzled an amount of Rs. 84,50,000/-
of the claimants namely, Fida Ullah, Muhammad Farooq,
Muhammad Nazeeb, Riaz Muhammad, Inam Ullah and

Roshan Khan.
5. Under Section 9(a)(ix) of the National
Accountability Ordinance, 1999, if a person commits the
offence of cheating as defined in Section 415 of Pakistan
Penal Code, 1860 and thereby dishonestly induces
members of the public at large to deliver any property
including money or valuable security to any person.
Similarly, Section 9(a) (x) says that if any person
commits the offences of criminal breach of trust as
defined under Section 405 of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860
with regard to any property including money or valuable
security entrusted to him by members of the public at
large.
6. In the instant case during the course of trial,
the prosecution has examined 15 witnesses in all. The
most important of them are PW-3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, the
complainants. All these witnesses in their statements
claimed that the accused induced them to invest in the
mudariba business which according to him was free of
interest, purely Islamic and in accordance with sharia.

The accused also promised that they would be paid
exorbitant monthly profit, however, after paying profit
for 5/6 months and in some of the cases for 7 months, the
accused stopped payment of monthly profit and on
demand, he started giving lame excuses for the return of
principal amount. The witnesses also admitted in their
cross examination that mudariba contract was signed by
Inamullah accused and the complainants and that the role
of accused-appellant was that of ‘Wasi’ and that there
was no advertisement neither on T.V nor in newspaper or
in any other form alluring the complainants to invest in
the mudariba business of the accused.

7. The word “Induce” means to influence
someone to do something while “inducement” has been
defined as allurement. To make a person criminally
accountable, it must be proved that an act, which is
forbidden by law, has been caused by his conduct and
that the conduct was accompanied by two essential
elements of crime, namely actus reus and mens rea.
Keeping in view the legal provision and definition

formulated, let us appreciate the deposition of PW-3, 4,
5, 6 & 7 to see as to whether the ingredients of the
offence allegedly committed by the accused have
primarily been fulfilled satisfactorily?

Muhammad Nazeef, the complainant, was
examined by the learned trial Court as PW-3. In his
examination-in-chief, the witness deposed that:

“Accused, claiming to be a qualified Mufti
and a teacher in a madrassa at Rawalpindi,
also belonged to the district Batagram and
induced the general public including himself
to invest in the mudariba business of accused
in the year 2012. According to the witness
accused claimed his business to be free of
interest, purely Islamic and in accordance
with Sharia. Accused promised the witness
for profit of Rs. 4000/- to Rs. 5000/- per
month per lac of investment and he thus
invested Rs. 10,00,000/- with the accused. He
stated to have received the profit for 5-6
months which was reinvested with the
accused. According to him accused stopped
payment of profit subsequently and, when
demanded of the principal amount, started
delaying tactics for different dates. The
witness stated to have filed application with
the NAB authorities alongwith copy of CNIC
(Ex.PW 5/1) at Pages 62 to 64 of the
Reference. He highlighted payment receipt
and mudariba agreement (Ex.PW 5/2) at
Page 65 and 66 of the Reference containing
signatures of the accused Ayazul Haq as
recipient of Rs. 2,00,000/- and Rs.8,00,000/-
(Rs.10,00,000/- in toto) from the witness.
Copy of mudariba agreement dated
01.05.2012 at page 66 of the Reference
contains name of accused Ayazul Haq duly
printed on the Form as Wasi for Mudarib
(his brother Inam Ullah). An affidavit in
respect of above mentioned application was
also furnished by the witness to the NAB
authorities and the same (Ex.PW 5/3) is at
Page 67 of the Reference. He stated to have
been examined by the case IO as well.

In his cross examination, the witness
disclosed himself to be a retired teacher
receiving Rs. 26000/- as monthly pension and
not doing any job for having invested his
money in the mudariba business. He
conceded that mudariba contract at page 66
of the Reference did not contain signatures of
the accused. He refuted the suggestion of
making a false statement and admitted that
no advertisement on TV, Newspaper or in
any other form was done regarding the
mudariba business. He told that it was co-
complainant Qari Muhammad Farooq who
informed him about the mudariba business
and that he invested the money on separate
occasions. To a question he stated to might
have received profit for 7/8 months and that
the same was reinvested whenever received.
With regard to the profit he never issued any
receipt or acknowledgment”.

Since the statements of the remaining PWs are
ditto copy of each other with regard to the allegations
against the accused-appellant, therefore, the same need
not be reproduced here. The witnesses with the exception
of one or two, have admitted at trial and has also been
held by the learned trial Court in para-11.3 of the

impugned judgment dated 17.03.2018 that some of the
mudariba nama were signed by the accused-appellant as
‘Wasi’ a guarantor, however, while going through the
record we find that there is no undertaking by the
appellant that in case Inamullah, the principal accused

fails to abide by the terms of the agreement, he would
satisfy the claim of the complainants. It is not disputed
that an agreement between accused Inamullah (not before
the Court) and the PWs individually arrived and agreed
upon certain terms of investment of an amount. The
margin of the profit was also fixed by them. The agreed
profit was paid to the PWs for some months, the receipts
whereof were exhibited in the Court and are available on
the file. It has been noted that the accused, as per the
statements of complainants, failed to pay the monthly
profit and when the PWs demanded their principal
amount, there was no denial on the part of the accused
Inamullah, however, the matter was delayed on one
pretext or another, whereafter complaints were made to

NAB for the recovery of the amount.

8. In view of the facts discussed hereinabove,
we are of the considered view that the allegations in the
complaint and the documents placed on record by the
complainants, if taken on their face value, do not disclose
dishonest intention in the mind of the accused at the
inception nor the act of cheating the complainants,
having signed the mudariba nama. Thus the ingredients
of Section 9(a)(ix) (x) are not made out. Upon a fair and
ordinary construction of the complaint the matter appears
to be a civil matter rather than a criminal one.
9. In Rafiq Haji Usman .Vs. Chairman, NAB
and another (2015 SCMR 1575) while dealing with a
prosecution under Section 9 of the NAO, held that:-

“In case of entrustment, money/property

received is to be retained for return to the

giver at a later time as opposed to a promise
or contract where invest is made or money is
paid for the purpose of fulfillment of a
specific agreed upon purpose/contract---
Where money/property, in such a case, has
been entrusted to a person, using such
amount/property for any other purpose
would not attract the penal consequences of
S.405 PPC.

10. In the instant case, out of six, five claimants

submitted an application to NAB for taking action
11

against the accused-appellant for inducing public at large.
The word “public” includes any class of the public but
that class must numerically be sufficient to designate the
public at large. While defining the term ‘public at large’,
the august Supreme Court in case titled “Rafiq Haji
Usman .Vs. Chairman, NAB and another (2015 SCMR

1575), held as under:-

“We are of the view that 13 persons would
hardly constitute public in its literal and
ordinary sense; furthermore meaning of the
word large i.e. "considerable or relatively
great size, extent or capacity having wide
range and scope" does not bring 22 or 13
persons as the case may be within its
concept and fold. Thus from this angle as
well the said section seemingly perhaps can
be held not attracted to the instant case. It
is trite law that the provisions of law which
constitute criminal offences shall be strictly
construed and applied, thus prima facie we
have not been persuaded by the plea made
by the learned Deputy Prosecutor General
that in such a case section 9(x) ibid shall be
attracted”.

11. As evident from the material available on
the record and in the light of illuminating judicial
pronouncements of the august Supreme Court, it is
concluded that mere violation of agreement/contract does

not ipso facto attracts the definition of cheating and
12

criminal breach of trust and would not attract the penal
consequences.

As far as the question of limitation is concerned,
the august Supreme Court in case titled “Mian
Muhammad Nawaz Sharif .Vs. the State (PLD 2009
Supreme Court 814) held that:-

“Circumstances which prevented the
petitioner from filing the petition, in the
present case, against the conviction and
sentences were indeed extraordinary and

could be considered to be sufficient cause
to extension of time.”

12. Consequently, this appeal is allowed and the
appellant’s conviction and sentences under Section
9(a)(ix)(x) of the NAO are set aside. He is acquitted of
the charge leveled against him. He shall be released from

jail forthwith if not required in any other case.

13. Above are the reasons for the short order of

even date.
