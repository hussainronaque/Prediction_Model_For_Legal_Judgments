SYED MUHAMMAD _ ATTI

Petitioner Zahid Sultan has applied to this Court for
his release on bail in case FIR No. 433 dated
20.04.2018 under section 9 (c) of the Control of
Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, 15 KPK Arms Act,
2013 registered against him at Police Station
Havelian, Abbottabad, wherein he is charged for

possessing 3437 grams charas alongwith 30 bore

pistol.

2 Arguments heard and record available gone
through.

3. A cursory glance on record of the case would

reveal that no doubt 3437 grams charas alongwith
30 bore pistol were shown to have been recovered
but admittedly the recovery was not effected from
personal possession of the accused/petitioner rather

it was shown to have been recovered from the
i)

alleged residential room of the house of the
accused/petitioner. There was prior information
regarding selling of narcotics by the present
accused/petitioner and local police obtained search
warrant from Magistrate regarding the search of
house of present accused/petitioner, whereby the
learned Magistrate directed the local police to search
the place/house in presence of elders of locality but
no private and independent person was associated
with the alleged recovery. Furthermore, the above
search warrant was issued by concerned Magistrate
on 18.04.2018 under Article 22 of the Prohibition
Order (Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979 and it
was specifically mentioned therein that the search
warrant would be effective for twenty four hours.
Since raid was conducted on 20.04.2018, the search
warrant issued by the Magistrate ceased to have any
effect after lapse of twenty four hours, therefore, its
evidentiary value would be determined by the
learned trial Court after recording evidence of the
prosecution. Moreover, the Judicial Magistrate was
not competent to issue search warrant in the cases to
be registered under the provisions of Narcotic
Substances Act, 1997, rather it was Special Court,

who could issue such warrant under the provisions
i)

of CNSA, 1997. This Court in case titled ‘Rehmat

Zaman _ and another Vs. The State’ (2008 MLD

1589), has held that

“Perusal_of the record reveal that
the search warrant, dated 22.3.2008
in_this case _was_issued by the
Judicial Magistrate. Under the law
search has to be conducted strictly in
accordance with section 20 of the
Control of Narcotic Substances Act,
1997 and it is the Special Court who
has_to_issue the search warrant to
any violation of this provision of law
will make the search illegal.”

In another case titled ‘Abrar Hussain
Vs. The State’ (2011 YLR 238), it was held
that:-

“Section 20 of Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 1997 connotes that
Special Court, alone, _can__ issue
warrant forthe search of any
building, place, premises or
conveyance in which it has reason to
believe that contraband mentioned in
the_section_is_kept_or_concealed.
Subsection (i) of the said section is
thus restricted _and_deals_ primarily
with apprehension of offender which
would, obviously, be followed by his
culpability, on_the_one_hand_and
provisions for_raid, search, on_the
other, but the Magistrates muchless
Judicial Magistrates have_not_been
invested with such powers. The said
jurisdictional__error___cannot___be
ignored. It is now well established
that before such an_action is justified,
the existence or otherwise of _the
power is to be ascertained so_as to
perform _it within permissible limits
failing which the very action together
‘with super-structures built thereon
would crumble.”

4. Likewise, on record there is no previous
conviction of accused/petitioner regarding his
involvement in such like cases and finally the
investigation in the case is also complete and
accused/petitioner is no more required to the local
police for further investigation. Moreover, the report
of FSL is also not available on file, without which it
cannot be determined that the recovered stuff was
actually charas or something else. It is pertinent to
mention here that on the same day, time and from
the same house, local police of police station
Havelian also recovered 2232 grams charas and
case FIR No. 434 dated: 20.04.2018 was also
registered against brother of present
accused/petitioner.

In view of the above and on_ tentative

nN

assessment of the available record, this Court is of
the view that the petitioner has made out a case
arguable for the purpose of bail as his case falls
within the ambit of further inquiry gua his guilt.

6. Consequently, this bail petition is allowed and
it is directed that the accused-petitioner be released
on bail, subject to his furnishing bail bonds in the
sum of Rs.1,00,000/- with two sureties each in the

like amount to the satisfaction of the learned Illaqa /
n

Duty Judicial Magistrate, who shall ensure that the
surcties are local, reliable and men of means.
7. Above are the detailed reasons of my short

order of even date.

Announced.
