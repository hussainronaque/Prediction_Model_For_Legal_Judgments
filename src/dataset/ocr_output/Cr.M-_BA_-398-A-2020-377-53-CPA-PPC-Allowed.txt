AHMAD ALI, J.- Accused/petitioner, Umair
Shoukat, seeks his post arrest bail in case F.ILR
No.1002 dated 31.12.2019 under section 377 of
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, read with section 53 of
Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010, registered
at Police Station Sarai Saleh, District Haripur.

2. Brief facts of the case, as narrated in
the F.I.R. lodged by Muhammad Rafique son of
Muhammad Farid to the police on 31.12.2019 at
19.20 hours alongwith his son/victim, Waqas, aged
about 10/11 years, which was recorded in shape of
‘Murasila’, are that when he came back home, he
found his son Waqas weeping. On query, he told

that at about ‘Namashan Wella’, Umair son of
Shoukat took him to ‘Kassi? and committed
sodomy with him. Consequently, the above
mentioned F.I.R was registered against the

accused, who was arrested in the instant case on

31.12.2019.
3. Arguments heard. Record perused.
4. Perusal of record reveals that the

accused-petitioner has been directly charged in the
F.ILR. However, the Medical Officer observed that
there was no clear sign of penetration of penis.
However, the FSL report qua human semen on the
‘shalwar’ and ‘Qameez’ of the victim are in
negative, while that of ‘shalwar’ and ‘Qameez’ of
accused/petitioner are in positive. The Honourable
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of ‘Kashmir
Khan Vs. The State’ (Criminal Petition No.302
of 2020) decided on 09.04.2020 has observed
that:-

“To establish the offence of sodomy,
the carnal intercourse is essential
ingredient which is not spelled out in
the instant case as there is sufficient
room to conclude that perhaps the
carnal intercourse was not established
during the curse of investigation as the
medical report is not supportive in
nature, by this Court qua the culpability
of the petitioner in the aforesaid crime
and that would be resolved by the
learned trial Court after recording of
evidence. From the perusal of record
and the law on the subject, we are of
the opinion that the petitioner has
squarely made out a case falling under
section 497(2) Cr.P.C. the question
regarding applicability of other offence
in the said crime would be resolved by
the learned trial Court before it. ”

Record shows that the date of birth as per ‘Bay’
Form of the accused/petitioner is 30.08.2002, as
such, he is to be considered and treated as a
juvenile offender being under the age of 18 years.
The definition of ‘child’ is provided in section 2
(b) of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance,

2000, which reads:

‘Child’ means a person who at the time of
commission of an offence has not attained
the age of eighteen years.”

The case was_ registered against the
accused/petitioner on 31.12.2019, thus, his age on
the day of registration of case was 17 years, 4
months, as such, he was under the age of 18 years
thus, the provisions of Juvenile Justice System
Ordinance, 2000 shall be attracted to the case of
accused/petitioner. The offence under section 377
PPC is punishable with imprisonment for life or
with imprisonment of either description for a term
which shall not be less than 02 years nor more than
10 years and also liable to fine and similarly under
section 53 of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa_ Child

Protection and Welfare Act, 2010, the maximum
punishment extendable to 14 years is provided.
Thus, the lesser of two punishments is to be taken
into consideration at bail stage.

5. This Court, in the interest of justice,
finds it necessary to have a look at the provision of

164-B Cr.P.C, which reads as under:-

“164-B DNA Test.-(1) Where an offence under
section 376, section 377 or section 377-B of the
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (Act SLV of 1860) is
committed or attempted to have been committed
or is alleged to have been committed, Deoxyribo
Nucleic Acid (DNA) — samples, where
practicable, shall be collected from the victim
with his or her consent or with the consent of his
or her natural or legal guardian and the accused
during the medical examinations conducted
under section 164-A within optimal time period
of receiving information relating to commission
of such offence.
(2) The DNA samples collected under sub-
section (1) shall at the earliest be sent for
investigation to a forensic laboratory where
these shall be properly examined and preserved:
Provided that confidentiality of such
examination shall at all time be observed.”

Apparently, no compliance with the above
provision of law has been made because no
samples for DNA tests have been obtained either
from the accused-petitioner or victim despite the
fact that the word “shall” is used in the said
provision, making its applicability mandatory. The
prosecution must keep in mind this aspect while
dealing with such like offences in the best interest

of the accused as well as the victim.
6. Pertinent to mention here that the
accused-petitioner is minor/juvenile and is behind
the bars since his arrest. The purpose of the
Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000 read with
amended Act, appears to be that accused of tender
age saved from humiliation of jail who being at the
age of learning can also not be mixed up with other
criminals in jail and they can be made useful
citizen of the country in their future life. This court
is forfeited to seek guidance from case law laid
down in 2004 YLR 2879. Sages down the ages
have generally perceived an accused person,
before establishing of his guilt beyond reasonable
doubt as the darling of a Criminal Court, and if
such an accused person happens to be a child, then
the romance about him usually receives a further
sympathetic boost. Moreover, investigation in the
case is complete and accused-petitioner is no more
required to the prosecution for the very purpose,
therefore, his further incarceration in jail will serve

no useful purpose.

7. So far as the confessional statement of
accused/petitioner is concerned, the confession

could not be recorded in the manner as ordained by
the august Apex Court in ‘Hashim Qaism’s case’

(2017 SCMR 986) and relied upon in (2018
P.Cr.L.J 1465), thus, the veracity of the
confessional statement of the accused/petitioner
would be seen by the learned trial Court after

recording evidence of the prosecution.

8. Apart from the above, it has been held
time and again by the august Supreme Court that
bail does not mean acquittal of an accused but only
a change of custody from Government agencies to
the sureties, who on furnishing bonds take
responsibility to produce the accused whenever
and wherever required to be produced. Reliance
could be placed on case reported in 2008 SCMR
807 “Haji Muhammad Nazir Vs State”.

9. Before parting with this order, this
court finds it necessary to mention that all the
observations recorded above are tentative
assessment just for the disposal of bail petition and
not intended to influence the mind of the trial
Court, which is free to appraise the evidence
strictly in accordance with the law and the merits

of the case.
10. Consequently, this bail application is
allowed and accused-petitioner, Umair Shoukat, is
admitted to bail provided he furnishes bail bonds
in the sum of Rs.200,000/- (Two lacs), with two
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction
of I/laqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate, concerned, who
shall ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and
men of means.
