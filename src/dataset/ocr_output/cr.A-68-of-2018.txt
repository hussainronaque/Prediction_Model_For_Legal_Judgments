2. Appellant faced trial in case FIR No. 908

(Ex.PW-11/1) dated 27.08.2014 under sections 302,
341, 427, 34 PPC registered at Police Station Dir,
District Dir Upper, on the basis of ‘Murasila’ (Ex.
PW-5/1) sent by Rahat Khan SHO (PW-5) on
27.08.2014, wherein he has stated that the local police
received information that a murder had taken place in
village Muhammad Amin Kalay. On receipt of such
information a_ police party headed by Khaista
Muhammad Sub Inspector Investigation proceeded to
the village, where they found dead body of Alim Khan
in his house. Complainant namely Shakirullah who
was son of the deceased, was present there and lodged
report of the occurrence in the presence of one

Nawab (0.8.) Hon‘bte Mr. ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
es

Muhammad Haroon Khan son of Mohd. Hakim Khan,
cousin of the complainant. He stated in his report that
his father namely Alim Khan had been going to look-
after his carriage truck parked in Dir Bazar through a
motorcar being driven by driver namely
Malak Azam. When the motorcar reached the mosque
at village Shahi Bagh on 11:30 A.M, it was stopped by
accused Naseeb Khan son of Dost Muhammad Khan,
Khan Bacha son of Muhammad Sardar, Munasib ‘son
of Zareef Khan, who had already been present there.
They started indiscriminate firing on his father who
got injured as a result of firing of appellant namely

Naseeb Khan and died at the spot. The occurrence was

" stated to have been witnessed by driver of the vehicle

namely Malak Azam, Muhammad Baz Khan and
Muhammad Jan all residents of village Muhammad
Amin Kalay. Previous blood feud was stated to have
been constituting motive for commission of the
offence. Delay in lodging of report was stated to have
been due to the area being hilly and far away from the
police station, as well as due to lack of knowledge
about the legal know-how. \

3. Since accused were avoiding their lawful

arrest initially, therefore proceedings under section 512

Nawab = (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Ishtlaq [brahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
Cr.P.C were initiated against them and they were
declared proclaimed offenders by learned Sessions
judge Dir Upper vide his judgment dated 28.08.2015.
4. On completion of _ investigation,
supplementary challan was submitted against
appellant before learned trial Court. After compliance
of proceedings of 265-C Cr.P.C, charge was framed
against him on 28.03.2018, to which he pleaded “not
guilty”: and claimed trial. Prosecution produced as
many as twelve (12) witnesses, whose statements were
recorded and placed on file. On conclusion of
proceedings in the case, accused was examined under
section 342 Cr.P.C. Learned trial Court convicted and
sentenced the appellant vide impugned judgment dated
28.03.2018, as stated earlier.

5. Feeling aggrieved from his conviction
and sentences, accused/appellant has filed the instant
appeal before this Court while complainant has also
filed connected Criminal Revision No. 18-M of 2018
for enhancement of the sentences awarded to
accused/respondent.

6. Learned counsel for appellant read the
relevant evidence, so as to assist this Court in

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
reappraisal of the evidence. He thereafter contended
that there has been extra-ordinary delay in lodging of
report, which not only established that report of the
occurrence had been lodged with consultations and
deliberations, but also indicated that the prosecution
witnesses had not been present on the spot at the
time of commission of the offence, otherwise they
would have taken the deceased to the hospital or
would have lodged a timely report of the occurrence
in police station. He further added that no blood has
been recovered from the vehicle despite the fact that
the deceased was stated to have received multiple
injuries inside the motorcar. He also referred to a
number of contradictions in the statements of two
eyewitnesses recorded as PW-7 and PW-8 and
argued that prosecution have not been able to prove
commission of the offence in the mode and manner
as stated in first report of the occurrence. Regarding
recovery of six empties of 7.62 bore from the spot,
the learned counsel submitted that the recovered
empties had not been sent to the FSL for
comparison, as no matching FSL report is available

on file. In order to bolster his submissions, the

Nawab = (0.8) Hon’ble Mr. Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
learned counsel placed reliance on judgments
reported as 1995 SCMR_ 1345, 2012 SCMR 428,

PED 2019 Supreme Court 64, 2003 YER 927
(Karachi), 2013 YLR 543 (Sindh), 2019 YLR 1073
(Peshawar), 2019 YER 2082 (Islamabad) and 2020
PCr. LJ 202 (Peshawar).

7. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of
complainant submitted in rebuttal that the spot of
occurrence was situated in a far of place, therefore
happening of delay in lodging report of the
occurrence was quite natural. Learned counsel
further added that the eyewitnesses have been totally
independent witnesses having no ill-will to depose
falsely against the appellant, and therefore their
statements could not be discarded, merely for the
reasons that minor contractions have occurred
therein. They further added that the statements of
both the eyewitnesses were quite natural and through
their statements the prosecution have been able to
prove case against the appellant beyond reasonable
doubt. In support of their assertions, learned counsel
placed reliance on judgments reported as 2001

SCMR_177, 2002 _SCMR_ 334, 2003 SCMR_ 522,

Nawab (0.8.) Hon'ble Mr. Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigqar Ahmad
2004_SCMR_ 1185, 2006 SCMR 161, PLD 2007

Supreme Court 71, 2007 SCMR 1 014, 2017 SCMR
1976 and 2010 YER 1125 (Lahore). Learned

counsel appearing on behalf of State adopted
arguments of learned counsel for the complainant
and supported the impugned judgments.

8. We have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the parties, learned counsel appearing on
behalf of State and perused the record.

9. . Perusal of record reveals that first report
of the occurrence has not only been lodged with an
unexplained delay but a preliminary investigation
had also taken place before lodging of the report.
The time of occurrence has been mentioned as 11:30
A.M on 27.08.2014 while the time of report has been
shown as 15:45 P.M on said date. FIR has then been
registered on the basis of ‘Murasila’ at 18:20 P.M on
27.08.2014. Distance of the place of occurrence from
police station has been shown as 12/13 kilometers.
First report of the occurrence has been lodged with
delay of four hours and 15 minutes. Such a delay has
been tried to be explained by the complainant in the

‘Murasila’ by stating, that spot of occurrence had

Nawab = (0.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Ishtlaq Ibrahtm
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
(®

been a far of place from the police station, as well as
less acquaintance with the legal know-how. None of
the explanations given above appears to be correct.
Cousin of the complainant namely Muhammad
Haroon has been examined as PW-2, who has stated
in his cross-examination that police had reached
their home at 01:30 P.M. Similarly, the complainant
namely Shakirullah while deposing in Court as PW-
6 has also stated in his cross-examination that dead

body of deceased had been brought to their house at

12:30 or 01:00 P.M. He has also stated that he had

heard fire shots. PW-7 namely Malak Azam who has
claimed to be an eyewitness of the occurrence has
stated in his cross-examination that police had
arrived at the spot on 02:35 P.M for the first time. In
such circumstances, when the police had arrived at
the spot then further delay, occurring in lodging of
first report of the occurrence could not be explained
by the prosecution. Both the explanations for delay
given in first report of the occurrence cannot
therefore be considered for the reason that police had
arrived on the spot at 01:30 P.M, they were also

having legal know-how, then why had the .

Nawab = (0.B.) Hon'ble Mr. tshtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
complainant failed in lodging report of the
occurrence. In such circumstances, delay would
naturally be fatal to the case of prosecution, as it was
not only delay simplicitor but preliminary
investigations has also been taken before lodging of
first report of the occurrence. Hon’ble Apex Court in
its judgment rendered in the case of “Iftikhar

Hussain and others v/s The State” reported as 2004

SCMR_1185 has treated such issues in the case of
prosecution in the following manner;

“It is a case in which. F.LR. has been registered after
consultation and conducting preliminary investigation. If
both these witnesses in fact had witnessed the incident, there
was no occasion to cause delay in lodging of F.LR. It is
significant to note that delay in lodging F.I.R. under section
154, Cr.P.C. is condonable keeping in view the facts and
circumstances of each case particularly in those cases
where the accused persons have not been nominated in the
F.LR, and the names of the witnesses who have seen the
incident have also not been mentioned but where the
complainant is fully aware about the culprits and the names
of the witnesses are also known to him then if delay in
lodging F.L.R. is caused, it creates heavy duty upon the
prosecution to explain the same satisfactorily otherwise the
prosecution case would become doubtful.

10. The two PWs, whose statements has been
recorded as PW-7 and PW-8 have also been carrying
contradictions and discrepancies, regarding
material aspects of the case. Malak Azam, whose
statement “was recorded as PW-7 has stated
in his examination-in-chief that he had been driving

the vehicle carrying the deceased then alive namely

Nawab = (0.8.) Hon'ble Mr. tshtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-10-

Alim Khan as a passenger along with other
passengers. This witness has stated, in his cross-
examination that he had left the spot of occurrence
for his own house, after the occurrence. He also
stated that Muhammad Baz Khan and Muhammad
Jan (PW-8) had also gone with him in his vehicle to
their village. The other PW namely Muhammad Jan
has however stated, in his cross-examination, that
dead body of the deceased had been dispatched from
the spot of occurrence towards home at 12:00 P.M
(noon), and that he along with the other PW Malak
Azam (PW-7) and Muhammad Baz Khan had
accompanied the dead body. He also added that they
had been carrying the dead body in a cot (tls), on
foot. PW-7 has also stated, further ahead in his
cross-examination, that the dead body of deceased
had been taken by police from the spot to police
station. While in earlier part of his cross-examination
he had stated that the dead body had been taken by
people of the village to house of the deceased. All
these contradictions are material in nature and have
been regarding such aspects of the case, which in

normal circumstances, are not supposed to be

Nawab = (0.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-ll-

forgotten by a PW who have seen the occurrence or
was present there. These contradictions have created
doubt regarding presence of both these PWs on the
spot and to have seen the occurrence, Reliance in
this respect is placed on judgment of Hon’ble Apex
Court given in the case of “Muhammad Imran v/s
The State reported as 2020 SCMR 857, wherein it
has been held;

“Ocular account had been furnished by the witnesses who
were found out of tune with one another; they were
discrepant on the manner and mode of their arrival at the
crime scene; and there was no unanimity amongst them
on the passage they took to take the deceased to the
hospital. Such contradictions, viewed in the retrospect of
arrival of the witnesses exactly at a point of time when the
accused started inflicting blows to the deceased with their
inability to apprehend him without there being any
weapon to keep them effectively at bay, cast shadows on
the hypothesis of their presence during the fateful
moments.

Substantial doubts have been lurking in
the case, prosecution have therefore failed to prove
case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.
11. So far as judgments of Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan relied upon by learned
counsel for complainant and reported as 2001 SCMR

177 and 2017 SCMR_1976, are concerned, there is

no doubt that abscondence of the accused had been

taken as a corroboratory circumstance in the case,

Nawab (D.8.) Hon‘ble Mr. ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-12-

but when the prosecution have failed to prove case
against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt,
abscondence as a corroboratory piece of evidence
would lose its significance. The other judgments

reported as PLD 2007 Supreme Court 71, 2007
SCMR_1014 and 2010 YLR 1125, lays down that

occurring of minor contradictions in the statements
of PWs is natural, which may be ignored, but
contradictions in the case in hand have been found
material, said judgments are therefore of no help to
the case of prosecution. The other judgments

reported as 2005 SCMR 522 and 2006 SCMR 261

have not been of any help to the case of complainant
or prosecution as well. Benefit of even a single
doubt is to be extended to the accused wherever
reasonably found in case of prosecution, as held by
the Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of “ Mst, Asia
Bib v/s The State and others” reported as PLD 2019
Supreme Court 64.

12. In light of what has been discussed
above, accused/appellant is extended benefit of
doubt and resultantly acquitted of the charge of

commission of the alleged offence by setting aside

Nawab = (D.B.) Hon’bie Mr. Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-13-

the impugned judgment dated 28.03.2018 of the ©
Court of learned Additional Sessions-II Dir Upper.
The appeal in hand is allowed in above terms.
Criminal revision No. 18-M of 2018 filed by
complainant has become infructuous and same is

- accordingly dismissed.

13. These are reasons for our short order of
even date.
