PW-6 at Khwaza Khela hospital about the
murder of his nephew Hasham Khan and
causing injury through dagger blows upon the
body of other injured Izaz by the present
juvenile accused/appellant Arif Hussain and
other co-accused Tariq Hussain. The motive
behind the occurrence was disclosed to be that
both the accused used to tease the deceased
Hasham Khan. In view of the report of
complainant the ‘Murasila’ Ex. PW-4/1 was
drafted which culminated into FIR, Ex. PA
being registered against the accused/appellant
and other co-accused at PS concerned on

08.11.2014.

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
3. Investigation of the case was
entrusted to Muhammad Umar, ASI, PW-13
who has stated that on 08.11.2014 at about
20:00 hours the Muharir of the police station
concerned informed him in respect of the
occurrence which took place in Khwaza Khela
Bazar, therefore, he rushed to the Khwaza
Khela hospital where Qibla Alam Khan,
ASHO, PW-6 handed over to him the
‘Murasila’. During investigation, he has taken
into possession blood stained garments of the
deceased Hasham Khan having on front two
corresponding cuts of dagger vide recovery
memo Ex. PW-10/1, which was sealed in
parcel No. 1 Ex. P-4. He has also taken into
possession blood stained garments of the
injured Izaz having dagger blows cuts on back
side vide the said recovery memo Ex. PW-
10/2. He has also prepared site plan Ex. PB on
the pointation of the eye-witnesses. He has
collected blood from the spot through ‘Gatta’/
~& and white tissue paper from the places of

the deceased and the injured vide recovery

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
memos Ex. PW-8/1 and Ex. PW-8/2
alongwith one pair of a Chappal black colour
of the deceased Hasham Khan vide recovery
memo Ex. PW-8/3. During investigation, on
pointation of the accused Tariq Hussain the
police recovered the weapon of offence i.e.
blood stained dagger (Ex. P-9), which was
taken into possession by the Investigation
Officer and in this regard he prepared
pointation memo Ex. PW-13/5 alongwith
recovery sketch Ex. PW-13/6. The recovered
articles were sent to FSL vide application Ex.
PW-13/8. He has also prepared the list of legal
heirs of the deceased Ex. PW-13/11 and as per

sections 201 PPC and 13 A.O. were added
against the accused through addition memo
Ex. PW-13/12. He has also placed on record
the FSL report Ex. PW-13/13.Upon
completion of the investigation, complete
challan was forwarded to the SHO concerned

for onward submission.

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
4. During the course of trial, the
prosecution examined as many as 17
witnesses whose statements were recorded and
placed on file. On closure of the prosecution
evidence, accused was examined under section
342, Cr.P.C, wherein he denied the charges,
claimed innocence and stated to have falsely
been implicated in the case.

5; On conclusion of the trial, the
learned Additional Sessions Judge/Judge
Juvenile Court Khwaza Khela Swat, convicted
and sentenced the accused/appellant, vide the
judgment impugned herein, hence, these
connected matters.

6. The learned counsels appearing
on behalf of the appellant have argued that the
prosecution before the lodging of FIR has
conducted a preliminary inquiry as allegedly
the complainant Rahmat Ali, PW-1 was not the
eye-witness of the occurrence and in the FIR
the person who informed him about the
occurrence i.e. Mohsin Khan, PW-2 was not

mentioned. Furthermore, have argued that the

NAWAB/PS* — DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
allegations in the FIR made by the
complainant was never endorsed either by PW-
2 Mohsin Khan or the injured/witness Izaz
Khan, PW-3. Next argued that the alleged
injured/witness Izaz Khan despite the fact that
at the relevant he was conscious did not
register the FIR in person and furthermore he
has not mentioned the name of Mohsin Khan,
PW-2, the alleged eye-witness of the
occurrence in his examination-in-chief,
therefore, he is not a truthful witness. They
have further argued that the alleged
independent witnesses i.e. shopkeepers of the
Bazar were not examined by the prosecution
and have further stated that the mode and
manner of the offence was introduced later.
They have also contested the arrest of the
appellants and have also attacked the recovery
of alleged dagger i.e. the weapon of offence
being result of the joint pointation of both the
accused having no independent corroboration.
They have further drawn the attention of the

Court to the overwriting on the ‘Murasila’

NAWAB/PS* DB: ‘Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
as well as in the FIR and the medical report
and have also argued that although it is
mentioned that there were light, however, no
attempt was made by the prosecution to place
on record the alleged source of light i.e. bulb.
They have lastly argued that the mode and
manner of the occurrence does not suggest that
both the accused were allegedly sharing the
common intention as the occurrence took place
at the spur of the moment.

Ts Conversely, the learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the complainant has
argued that the FIR is only meant to set in
motion the law and the complainant who is not
an eye-witness of the occurrence is not
required to provide minute details of the
incident in the FIR. He has further argued that
the time, date, mode and manner of the offence
were successfully established by the
prosecution through an independent witness
Mohsin Khan, PW-2 and the injured/witness
Izaz Khan, PW-3 and despite lengthy cross-

examination of the aforesaid witnesses by the

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
defence there is no major discrepancy in their
testimony to disbelieve them. He has further
argued that indeed it is a quality of the
evidence which is required for prosecution to
establish the guilt of the accused and not the
quantity of the evidence.

The learned Astt: Advocate
General appearing on behalf of the State has
also supported the contentions of the learned
counsel for the complainant.
8. We have heard arguments of the
learned counsel for the accused/appellant,
learned counsel for the complainant and
learned Assistant Advocate General appearing
on behalf of the State and have gone through
the record of the case with their able
assistance.
9. According to the prosecution
story, the offence was committed at about
19:00 hours in a thickly populated area i.e. the
market/Bazar of Khwaza Khela and in front of
Anwar hotel. True, that the complainant

Rahmat Ali, PW-1 is not the eye-witness to

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-10-

the occurrence and at the relevant time he was
not available at the place of occurrence,
however, he had lodged the FIR at Khwaza
Khela hospital at 19:35 hours, where he did
not mention that on whose information he had
narrated the mode and manner of the
occurrence. He also did not mention the name
of PW-2 Mohsin Khan in his first information
report, however, in our humble view, this
omission would not render the entire
prosecution case doubtful for the reason that
the complainant has frankly conceded that he
was not an eye-witness to the occurrence.
Therefore, he has only set the prosecution case
in motion being the uncle of deceased Hasham
and the injured/witness Izaz who at the
relevant time were of the age 14 and 16 years
respectively as per their injury sheets.

10. The mode and manner of the
occurrence has been narrated by PW-2 Mohsin
Khan and injured/eye-witness Izaz Khan, PW-
3 to the effect that at the relevant time the

deceased Hasham Khan and injured Izaz were

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-ll-

going towards the house of their grandfather,
however, at ‘Isha Vela’ at about 7:00 P.M
when they reached near Anwar hotel, there the
convicts Arif and Tariq both sons of Dost
Muhammad Khan emerged and Tariq the
convict got-hold of Hasham Khan and Arif
Hussain had inflicted dagger blows at Hasham
Khan. In order to save his brother, the injured
Izaz got-hold of Arif, in the meanwhile, Tariq
released Hasham deceased and took the
dagger from Arif and had inflicted a dagger
blow at his back (Izaz).

11. In support of the prosecution
case, Izaz Khan appeared as PW-3 who has
narrated the aforesaid story in his Court
statement. Although, he has not mentioned
about the presence of the eye-witness Mohsin
Khan, PW-2 in his examination-in-chief,
however, in cross-examination in response to
a query of the defence he has fully explained
the incident by mentioning Mohsin not only to
have seen the occurrence but has stated that

the said Mohsin and some other persons had

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
em iets

taken him to the hospital. Furthermore, the
presence of Mohsin at the spot is also
established from the medical evidence which
clearly mentions that the then injured now
deceased Hasham was brought by Mohsin and
was identified by Qibla Alam, ASHO at 7:30
P.M. on 08.11.2014.

12, The said eye-witness Mohsin
Khan appeared as PW-2 who has fully
supported the case of prosecution. The said
Mohsin Khan is not related to the complainant
and works as police constable and has not
only justified his presence at the spot but the
medical report also established the presence of
Mohsin to have brought the then injured now
deceased Hasham to the hospital. Therefore,
Mohsin Khan is indeed a natural and an
independent eye-witness. The defence has not
given even a remote suggestion to him
regarding his interest in the prosecution of the
appellants. Thus, in the circumstances, for the
only reason that the complainant did not

mention his name in the FIR will not lead to

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
2] 9%

an inference that he was not available at the
spot. In this regard, reliance is placed on the

judgment of august Supreme Court of

6

Pakistan titled “Muhammad Mushtaq v/s The

State” (PLD 2001 Supreme Court _107)”,
wherein it was held by that:- “Eyewitness
although was not named in the F.I.R, yet he
was a natural witness to whom no enmity or
ulterior motive was attributed for false
involvement of accused in the commission of
the offence and his deposition was found to
be true.”

This view further reflects in the
judgment of the august Supreme Court of
Pakistan titled “Muhammad Basharat v/s The
State” reported as 2003 SCMR 554”, wherein
it was observed that:- “Eye-witnesses were
the natural witnesses of the occurrence and
their testimony inspired confidence. Fact that
the eye-witness had not been named in the
F.LR was not by itself sufficient to discard

his testimony. Ocular evidence’ was

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
-14-

corroborated by medical evidence. Leave to
appeal was refused to accused accordingly.”

Even this Court in case law titled
“Tftikhar Ali v/s The State (1998 P Cr. LJ
2022 Peshawar)”, has held that:- “Non-
mention of the names of eye-witnesses in the
FIR and the site plan was not fatal as the
FIR was not made by an eye-witness or
relative of the deceased and the site plan was
not a substantive piece of evidence.”

Thus, there exist no occasion to
disbelieve the evidence of PW-2 Mohsin
Khan, more particularly in circumstances that
despite the lengthy cross-examination by the
defence he remained consistent and firm in his
testimony. Even he has exactly mentioned the
places where at the relevant time the
complainant-party as well as the accused-
appellants were present.

13. Izaz Khan, PW-3 the injured/eye-
witness has also supported the prosecution
case. Since he has sustained injury on his

thigh and was immediately shifted to the

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-15-

hospital where his injury-sheet was prepared
and was further shifted to Saidu Teaching
Hospital for further treatment. Thus, the
presence of this injured/PW at the spot is also
established. In the circumstance, it cannot be
believed that the present appellant was
substituted for the real culprits. In this regard,
reliance is placed on the judgment of august
Supreme Court of Pakistan titled “Abdul Rauf
and_ others v/s Mehhi Hassan and others”

(2006_SCMR_ 1106)”, wherein it was held

that:- “Presence of eye-witnesses who had
received fire-arm injuries at the place of
occurrence at the relevant time was not open
to any doubt. None of the eye-witnesses was
shown to have any motive or ill-will to
maliciously implicate the accused in the
case.”

This ratio has further been
affirmed by the august Supreme Court of
Pakistan in case titled “Muhammad Waris v/s

The State (2008 SCMR 784)”, wherein it was

held that:- “Eye-witness had explained their

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr, Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
a

-16-

presence at the place of occurrence at the
relevant time and thus, they were natural and
independent witnesses of the incident.
Medical evidence was not destructive of the
ocular testimony.”

14, The medical evidence furnished
by Dr. Khairun Nabi, PW-11 is also in line
with the prosecution case. According to the
medical report, the then injured now deceased
Hasham Khan in a critical condition was
brought to the hospital on 7:30 P.M on
08.11.2014. According to the medical report,
he has sustained the following injuries:-

e External Appearance:

> Mark of ligature on neck and
dissection:- Nill

> Condition of subject: fresh

1) 1 cut wound with sharp instrument

across the chest over sternum (Bone).

Cutting the sternum and 02 ribs and

cutting the heart lower boarder (3.5” in

length and deep to heart).

2) Cut wound on left side of chest near to

apex 1-1/2” in length and 3 cm deep.

e Walls, Ribs and cartridges:- 2 ribs cut

(6-7) right side.

Plura:- Left side cut.

Right lung:- cut

Pericardium and heart:- both cut.

Injury of chest:- 2 ribs and sternum

cut.

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
=F:

e Patient was brought to casualty before
expiry. He died on the table of
casualty.

¢ Cause of death:- direct injury to heart
internal and external bleeding.
The cause of death of deceased

Hasham Khan was also confirmed by the

doctor.

15. Similarly, the presence of the
appellant/convict Arif Hussain on the spot is
further established from his medical report
which was exhibited as 12/1 through Dr.
Muhammad Ali, PW-12 who had examined
him at 09:45 P.M. on 08.11.2014. Thus, it
appears that the appellant has also sustained
injuries during the scuffle which further
supports the prosecution case. As the injured
Izaz has stated in his statement that
Arif Hussain had inflicted dagger blows at his
brother Hasham Khan, he got-hold of him, in
the meanwhile, the accused Tariq Hussain
released his brother and took the dagger from
Arif Hussain and inflicted dagger blow at his

back.

‘
16. Moving on further to the

objection of the learned counsels for the
appellant regarding overwriting on the
‘Murasila’, FIR and the medical report of the
injured/eye-witness Izaz. According to the
prosecution case, the offence was committed
at 19:00 hours, whereas it was reported at
19:35 on the same day i.e. 08.11.2014 and the
FIR was registered at 20:20 hours on the same
date. Although, the overwriting appears on the
‘Murasila’ relating to the time of occurrence
and the time of report. This overwriting prima
facie appears that probably initially the time of
occurrence was written as 07:00 and the time
of report as 07:35, later it was made as 19:00
and 19:35 to bring it in conformity with the
conventional standard of mentioning the time
in FIR. However, this overwriting does not
effect the prosecution case, because the time
of report and registration of FIR has been
mentioned without any overwriting.
Furthermore, the time of examination of the

then injured now deceased Hasham also

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
afO%s

appears in the medical report is 7:30 P.M.
Therefore, this overwriting is inconsequential

and does not appear to be the result of

manipulation. Moreover, PW-6 Qibla Alam
Khan, ASHO who has drafted the ‘Murasila’
when was confronted with the same situation
of overwriting who have fully explained the
same in his cross-examination. Hence, this
objection is also overruled.

17. The learned counsels for the
appellant have also attacked on the recovery
weapon of offence ie. dagger, which was
recovered vide recovery sketch memo Ex.
PW-13/5 on the pointation of both the accused
i.e. Arif Hussan accused/appellant in the
instant appeal and Tariq Hussain
accused/appellant in the connected appeal in
presence of its marginal witnesses. The
recovery has been conducted on the joint
pointation, which prima facie is illegal,
however, this recovery is only a corroborative
piece of evidence and it is settled law that

when the eye-witnesses remained firm and

NAWAB/PS* DB: ‘Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
c

«90

straight-forward in their testimony before the
Court then they do not require further
corroboration from circumstantial evidence. In
this regard, wisdom is derived from the

judgment of the august Supreme Court of

Pakistan titled “Shafgat Ali and others v/s
The State” (PLD 2005 Supreme Court 288)”,

wherein it was observed that:- “If a witness
has furnished wholly reliable evidence, It is
bound to be accepted even without
corroboration, whereas halfly _ reliable
evidence needs strong corroboration for its
acceptance.”

18. The learned counsels for the
appellant have also referred to certain minor
discrepancies in the evidence of prosecution
witnesses, however, on the major point they
remained consistent and with the passage of
time it is very natural that the witnesses may
not be unanimous on minor narrations.

19. As far as the objection of the
learned counsels for the appellants that

allegedly the occurrence has taken place at

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-21-

7:00 P.M and the bulb i.e. source of light was
not recovered by the Investigation Officer
through recovery memo. However, it is a
matter of record/evidence that the offence has
committed in Bazar/market in front of a hotel
and in the normal course of business in Bazar
the presence of light i.e. bulb cannot be ruled
out.

20. During the course of arguments,
learned counsels for the appellant also prayed
for acquittal of the accused on account of his
juvenility, but it is settled law that juvenility
of an accused/person alone is not sufficient for
his/her acquittal, as each case has to be
decided in view of its peculiar facts and
circumstances keeping in view the gravity of
the offence being committed by the accused.
In context of the present case, the appellant
has been assigned specific role of causing
dagger blows upon the vital parts of body of
the deceased. Mere fact that at the time of

offence the appellant was below the age of 18

NAWAB/PS* DB: ‘Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-22-

years is no ground for further reduction of
sentence.

21. In view of the above, we have
come to un-escapable conclusion that the
prosecution has established its case beyond
any shadow of doubt against the present
appellant as well as the co-convict Tariq
Hussain and the conviction and sentence
recorded by the learned trial Court through the
impugned judgment is based on correct
appreciation of evidence, which do not call for
any interference.

22. In view of the above discussion,
we do not find any merit in the appeal on the
question of guilt of the accused/appellant,
therefore, the judgment of conviction and
sentence recorded by the learned trial Court is
maintained and this appeal is dismissed
accordingly.

23. Since the motive for the offence
has not been established and the appellant at
the time of offence was juvenile, therefore, the

award of capital punishment of death is not

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
=23-

warranted in the circumstances of the case,
hence, the criminal revision for enhancement
preferred by the complainant/petitioner is also
dismissed being devoid of any merit.
