CrM BA No. 75-D of 2017

JUDGMENT
Date of hearing 16.03.2017
Appellant-petitioner Malik and another by Mr. Sana Ullah Khan
Gandapur Advocate.
Respondent State etc by Mr. Adnan Ali Assistant A.G and M/S
Saifur Rehman Khan and Inam Ullah Khan Kundi Advocate for
Complainant.
MUHAMMAD AYUB_ KHAN, J.- Through the instant
petition, the petitioners Malik and Gul Bahram seek their
release on bail in case FIR No.516 dated 29.8.2010
registered under sections 302/34 PPC at police station,
Tank, District Tank as their such request was turned down
by learned Sessions Judge, Tank vide order dated

14.02.2017.

2. The prosecution story, in brief, is that on
29.8.2010 at 0730 hours, the complainant Sher
Muhammad (now deceased) lodged the report at
Emergency room of Civil Hospital, Tank to the effect that
at ‘subh-vela’, he was present in his land, when in the
meanwhile, petitioners fired at him with their respective

Kalashnikovs from the ‘burj’ of Gul Zaman. He got
-2-

injured and fell down. Motive for the occurrence was

stated to be disputed over land.

3. The learned counsel for the petitioner
vehemently contended that two accused are charged in the
report for firing and none of them is charged for specific
injury; that nothing incriminating was recovered either
from possession of the petitioners or at their pointation;
that absence of petitioners for quite some time was not
intentional and even on this ground alone, bail cannot be
refused to them. The learned counsel argued that the
material on record creates doubts in the prosecution case
and such benefits can be given to the petitioners at bail
stage. In support of his contentions, the learned counsel
relied on the cases of Dildar_Ali. Vs. The State (1999
SCMR_ 1316), Yasin and 3 others. Vs. The State_and
another (PLD 2001 Peshawar 144), Sher Zaman alias
Alamsher. Vs. The State (1992 P.Cr.L.J 409 Peshawar),
Zaigham Ashraf. Vs. The State and others (2016 SCMR
18), Muhammad Aslam. Vs. The State and others (2016
SCMR 1520), Ikhtiar_and 2 others. Vs. The State and
another (2016 Y L_ R_ 2443), Muhammad Sarwar alias
Bao. Vs. State and another (PLJ 2016 Cr.C_ (Lahore)
483), Amrez_and_ others. Vs. The State_and_another

2016 P.Cr.L.J_ Note 49 Lahore), Siraj. Vs. The
-3-

State and another (2016 P.Cr.L.J Note 36 Peshawar),
Rehmanullah. Vs. State and another (PLJ_ 2016 Cr.C
Peshawar 908) and Aziz Khan. Vs. State_and_another
(2016 SCMR 1792).

4, On the other hand, the learned Law Officer
representing the State assisted by learned counsel for
legal heirs of deceased refused the arguments of learned
counsel for the petitioner and strongly opposed the bail

application.

5. I have considered the arguments of learned

counsel for the parties and have gone through the record.

6. It is well settled law that at bail stage, deep
appreciation of record is not advisable and tentative
assessment of the record has to be made. Keeping in view
this principle, I would avoid discussion on deep merits of
the case. On tentative assessment, the petitioners are
directly charged in the FIR by the deceased then injured
himself. The postmortem report showing two entry
wounds, ocular evidence and motive for commission of
offence prima facie support the version of prosecution.
Moreover, the petitioners remained fugitive from law for
sufficient long time i.e. for more than seven years which

is sufficient to disentitle them for the grant of bail. All
-4-

these factors, on tentative assessment, connect the
petitioners with the commission of offence entailing
capital punishment, therefore, I am not inclined to release
them on bail. The case law relied upon by learned counsel
for the petitioners proceeds on different facts and
circumstances and is of no help to him. In the judgments
reported as PLD 2001 Peshawar _144, 2016 P.CrL.J
Note 49 Lahore, 2016 P.Cr.L.J_ Note 36 Peshawar and
PLJ 2016 Cr.C Peshawar 908, appeals were disposed of
and benefit of doubt was extended and at bail stage,
benefit of doubt is immaterial as it could only be found in
the evidence recorded during trial. In the case of Zaigham
Ashraf. Vs. The State and others (2016 SCMR 18), the
petitioner had taken the plea of alibi whereas no such plea
has been taken by the petitioners in the instant case. In the
case of Muhammad Sarwar alias Bao. Vs. State _and
another (PLJ 2016 Cr.C Lahore 483), the petitioner was
reported to be equipped with 12 bore pump action but did
not make any fire nor raised lalkara, thus his case was
held to be of further inquiry whereas in the instant case,
both the petitioners are charged for effective firing. In the
case of Aziz Khan. Vs. The State (2016 SCMR 1792), it
was observed that if on tentative assessment, dying
declaration and other material on record creates

reasonable doubt in a prudent mind, its benefit is to be
-5-

given to accused but in the instant case, as stated earlier,
the dying declaration finds support from ocular and
medical evidence. In the case of I[khtiar and 2 others. Vs.
The State (2016 YLR 2443), role of firing at the deceased
had been specifically attributed to absconding co-accused
and the petitioners therein were attributed the role that
they while aiming their weapons at the complainant,
warned him not to move and later on when the
complainant tried to apprehend absconding co-accused
after murder of his son, accused persons opened fire at the
complainant which proved ineffective whereas in the case
in hand, both the petitioners are specifically charged for
firing at the deceased. In the cases of Muhammad Aslam.
Vs. The State and others (2016 SCMR_ 1520) and Sher
Zaman _ alias Alamsher. Vs. The State (1992 P.Cr.L.J
Peshawar 409), it was held that abscondence alone would
not be hurdle in the way of bail to an accused if his case
falls within the ambit of further inquiry whereas the
instant case does not fall within the purview of further
inquiry. In the case of Dildar Ali. Vs. The State (1999
SCMR_1316), pre-arrest bail was confirmed on the
ground that case of the petitioner required further inquiry
whereas no element of further inquiry exists in the instant

case.

7. For the reasons mentioned above, the instant
petition being bereft of merit and substance is hereby
dismissed.
Announced.
