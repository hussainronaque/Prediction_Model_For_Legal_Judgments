ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, J:- At a trial held by learned
Juvenile Court/Additional Sessions Judge-III, Swabi,
accused Jabir Ali Shah, having been found guilty of
committing murder of Amjad Ali Shah deceased, has been
convicted under section 302 (b) PPC and sentenced to
undergo imprisonment for life and to pay Rs.1,00,000/-, as
compensation to legal heirs of the deceased in terms of
section 544-A Cr.P.C. and in default thereof to undergo 06
months simple imprisonment vide judgment dated
23.09.2017, in case FIR No.552 dated 05.08.2014,
registered under sections 302/34 PPC at Police Station
Swabi. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. has been extended
to him.

2. Against his conviction, convict Jabir Ali Shah, has

filed the instant appeal whereas complainant Babar Ali
Shah has filed Cr.R. No.131-P/2017, seeking enhancement
of sentence of the convicts.

3. Since, the appeal and the revision are arising out
from one and the same judgment dated 23.09.2017 of the
learned trial Court, therefore, are being decided through
this common judgment.

4. The prosecution case, as unfolded in First
Information Report/FIR (Exh.PA) is that on 05.08.2014 at
2225 hours, complainant Babar Ali Shah (PW.12) with the
help of his co-villagers brought the dead body of his father
Amjad Ali Shah deceased to Bacha Khan Medical
Complex (BMC), Shah Mansoor, and reported to Fazal
Miraj SI (PW.4) to the effect that on the night of
occurrence he along with his mother, namely,
Mst. Shaheen Akhtar and the deceased, was present in their
house, situated in village Panj Pir when at 2110 hours,
someone knock at the door of their house. The deceased
went outside to see the knocker and he followed him. The
moment the deceased came out from the house, accused
Adil Bacha, Sahid and Jabir Ali Shah (appellant),
emerged. Out of them, accused Sahid opened fire at the
deceased with his pistol, as a result, he got hit and died at
the spot. After commission of the offence, the accused
decamped from the spot. Motive behind the occurrence is
that the deceased was annoyed on the friendly relationship

of his son appellant Jabir Ali Shah with co-accused Sahid
and Adil Bacha. Report of the complainant was reduced
into writing in the shape of Murasila Exh.PA/1 by Fazal
Miraj SI (PW.4), who also prepared injury sheet and
inquest report of the deceased Exh.PW.4/1 and
Exh.PW.4/2, respectively, and shifted his dead body to the
mortuary for postmortem examination.

5. Dr. Syed Muhammad Kashif (PW.9) conducted
autopsy on the dead body of the deceased on 05.08.2014 at

09.50 p.m. and found the following injuries on his person:-

1. Firearm entry wound below neck (midline of
back).
2. Firearm exit wound on left axilla (bullet extracted

and handed over to police).

Firearm entry wound on right cheek (mid).
Firearm exit wound behind the right ear.
Two firearm entry wound on right cheek.
Firearm exit wound near the second bullet.

Firearm entry wound on top of skull.

on nuw FY

Firearm exit wound on back of skull (occipital
region).

9. Firearm entry wound on left eyebrow.

10. Firearm exit wound near right mandible below
cheek.

According to his opinion, firearm injuries
sustained by the deceased on his head, led to his unnatural
death. Probable time between injury and death has been
opined by him as 2 to 5 minutes whereas between death

and postmortem as % hours.
6. Ghani Said Khan Inspector (PW.13), conducted
investigation in the case, who proceeded to the spot and
prepared site plan Exh.PB at the pointation of the
complainant. During spot inspection, he took into
possession bloodstained pebbles from the place of the
deceased vide recovery memo Exh.PW.6/1 and two
empties of .30 bore lying in scattered position vide
recovery memo Exh.PW.6/2. Vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.6/3, he took into possession the last worn
bloodstained garments of the deceased and a spent bullet
extracted from the body of the deceased by the medical
officer vide recovery memo Exh.Pw.3/1. He sent the
bloodstained articles to the FSL, report whereof is Exh.PK.
Similarly, he sent the empties to the FSL for safe custody
vide application Exh.PW.13/2. Accused Jabir Ali and Adil
Bacha, arrested by SHO Sher Afsar, were handed over to
him, who obtained their two days police custody, recorded
their statements under section 161 Cr.P.C. and produced
them before the learned Illaqa Judicial Magistrate vide
application Exh.PW.10/1, where, both recorded their
confessional statements. He initiated proceedings under
section 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. against accused Sahid. On
01.01.2015, accused Sahid was arrested. He interrogated
him and recorded his statement under section 161 Cr.P.C.
On completion of investigation he handed over case file to

the SHO for submission of challan against the accused.
7. Since, accused Jabir Ali Shah was a juvenile,
therefore, separate challan under the Juvenile Justice
System Ordinance was submitted against before the
learned trial Court, where he was charge sheeted to which
they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order to prove
its case, the prosecution examined as many as thirteen
witnesses. After closure of the prosecution evidence,
statement of the appellant was recorded under section 342
Cr.P.C. wherein he denied the prosecution allegations and
professed innocence. He, however, declined to be
examined on oath under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. or to
produce evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial, the
learned trial Court, after hearing both the parties, convicted
and sentenced the appellant as mentioned vide judgment
impugned herein.

8. We have heard the exhaustive arguments of
learned counsel for the parties and perused the record with
their valuable assistance.

9. To prove the guilt of appellant, the prosecution has
relied upon the ocular account of the alleged
eyewitness/complainant Babar Ali Shah (PW.12), the
confessional statements of accused Adil Bacha, Jabir Ali
Shah, medical evidence and recoveries from the spot
positive Serologist report. The learned trial Court believing
the aforesaid evidence has recorded conviction of the

appellants. To concur or disagree with the view of the
learned trial Court, we will reappraise the evidence relied
upon by the prosecution.

10. According to FIR, the occurrence has taken place
in the month of August at 2110 hours i.e. (09.10 p.m) and
by such time the dark completely prevails. Complainant
Babar Ali Shah (PW.12), neither in his report/FIR nor in
court statement has uttered a single word about the source
of light in which he identified the accused and this fact has
also been admitted by the Ghani Said Khan Inspector
(PW.13)/Investigating Officer. In the site plan Exh.PB, the
deceased is shown at point No.1 and complainant at point
No.2 and distance between these two points is given as
6 feet. Similarly, accused Sahid, to whom the specific role
of firing has been attributed, is shown at point No.3, which
is at a distance of 16 feet from point No.2 i.e. the place of
complainant. Accused Jabir Ali Shah and Adil Bacha, have
been shown at points No.4 and 5, respectively, which are at
a distance of 21 and 26 feet, respectively, from the place of
complainant at point No.2. As discussed above, about
darkness of night, the site plan Exh.PB, is also silent about
availability of any source of light at the spot as no light of
lamp has been taken into possession by Ghani Said Khan
Inspector (PW.13), rather, he in his statement has admitted
that no source of light was disclosed to him by the
complainant. In the foot notes of the site plan Exh.PB it has

been categorically mentioned by the I.O. that the spot was
inspected and site plan was prepared with the help of
headlights of vehicle and torch. In absence of any tangible
and concrete evidence to prove the availability of light on
the spot at the time of occurrence, we are firm in our view
to hold that identification of the assailants from the
distances of 16, 21 and 26 feet, was next to impossible,
what to speak of identifying firing of a particular person
hitting the deceased. This sole ground is sufficient for
discarding the testimony of complainant that he is not a
truthful witness, however, for safe administration of justice
we would like to scrutinize his testimony.

Complainant poses himself to be the eyewitness of
the occurrence. It is in the prosecution evidence that
appellant Jabir Ali Shah is the step brother of complainant.
In cross-examination, complainant disclosed that he has
five paternal Aunts, namely, Mst. Bas Nama, Mst. Gul
Hamida, Mst. Irshada, Mst. Asia and Mst. Bakht Safa, who
all have grown up sons and that his above named aunts
have never demanded their shares in the property of the
deceased. By taking summersault in the next breath he
admitted that his above named paternal aunts has instituted
a civil suit in respect of their share in the property of the
deceased wherein he had submitted cognovit in their
favour. He further disclosed that the said suit is still
pending in the civil Court Swabi wherein appellant Jabir

Ali Shah along with his brothers Hasan, Jehangir and their
mother Mst. Shaheen are also defendants and they have
denied the claim of his paternal Aunts. He further disclosed
that, after second marriage of his deceased father with Mst.
Shaheen Akhtar, his mother Mst. Raveda (first wife of the
deceased) was expelled by the deceased along with her
daughter Mst. Marwa, therefore, they were residing in the
house of his maternal grandfather, however, he was
residing with his deceased father. Blowing hot and cold in
the next breath deposed he stated that “I lived in the
house of my maternal grandfather for three years till
the death of my deceased father”. He deposed that after
the occurrence they were shifted to a nearby house situated
near the house of the deceased on account of Jirga
decision. He admitted that during the days of occurrence
Mst. Shaheen Akhtar (second wife of the deceased) along
with her sons Jehangir and Hassan was residing with the
deceased. He deposed that the distance between the house
of his maternal grandfather and the deceased can be
covered within 2/3 minutes. Both the houses are situated in
different streets. He admitted it correct that a mosque is
situated near the house of his maternal grandfather wherein
he used to each Islamic education to children after Maghrib
prayers. The circumstances disclosed by the complainant
clearly prove that after second marriage by the deceased
with Mst. Shaheen Akhtar, the complainant along with his

mother and sister was expelled from the house by the
deceased, therefore, they were residing in the house of his
maternal grandfather. Besides, the complainant used to
teach Islamic education to the children in a Mosque
situated near the house of his grandfather. In this view of
the matter, presence of the complainant in the house of the
deceased is beyond the understanding of a prudent mind
because if the relation of the deceased were so strained
with mother of the complainant that she along with
children was expelled from the house then living of the
complainant in the house of his father does not appeal to a
prudent mind. In this view of the matter, the complainant
falls within the category of chance witness. The hon’ble
Supreme Court in case titled, “Mst. Rukhsana Begum
and others vs Sajjad and others” (2017 SCMR 596), has
explained the meaning of a “chance witness”, in the
following words:-

“Chance witness” was one who, in the normal

course was not supposed to be present on the

crime spot unless he offered cogent,

convincing and_ believable explanation

justifying his presence there”.
No explanation, much less plausible has been furnished by
the complainant so as to justify his presence in the house
of the deceased. Rather sufficient circumstances have been

disclosed by the complainant in his statement on the basis
10

of which his presence in the house of the deceased cannot
be believed by any stretch of imagination.

11. Adverting to the confessional statements of
accused Adil Bacha, the same is exculpatory. He has
shown complete ignorance about his involvement in the
murder of the deceased. He disclosed that on the night of
occurrence he was informed by accused Sahid through a
text message to reach the house of accused Adil Bacha for
chit chat. After sometime, he reached his house and they
both left for the house of appellant Jabir Ali Shah on a
motorbike, where the motorbike was parked at some
distance from the house of appellant Jabir Ali Shah and he
was told by accused Sahid to guard the motorcycle and
wait for him. Accused Sahid went towards the house of the
deceased and after sometime he (Adil Bacha) heard the
report of fire shots and noticed accused Sahid along with
appellant Jabir Ali Shah running towards him. He inquired
from them as to whether someone has fired at them or they
have fired at someone. In response he was told not to talk
and they all proceeded to Darra Petrol Pump on the same
motorbike, where Jabir Ali Shah was informed by someone
about murder of his father on mobile call. No active role
has been given by accused Adil Bacha to himself or to the
appellant Jabir Ali Shah in the commission of offence.
Similarly, he has also not disclosed about the role of other

co-accused.
11

As regards confessional statement of appellant
Jabir Ali Shah, he has stated therein that he had
friendly/love relationship with accused Sahid on which his
deceased father was annoyed and used to beat him. Having
embarrassed from the attitude of his father, he along with
accused Sahid made a plan for committing the murder of
the deceased and on the night of occurrence he told
accused Sahid on phone call to visit his house along with
pistol, who accordingly reached there along with accused
Adil Bacha. According to the scheme, accused Adil Bacha
was directed to stand near the motorcycle and wait for
them, whereas, he and accused Sahid went towards the
door of the house of deceased. He knocked at the door on
which the deceased came out and accused Sahid opened
fire at him, as a result, he got hit. They both rushed towards
the motorcycle and decamped from the spot.
12. Thorough perusal of the confessional statements of
both the appellant and accused Adil Bacha reveals that
both are contradictory with each other on material facts.
According to the statement of accused Adil Bacha when he
along with accused Sahid reached the spot he was directed
to stand near the motorbike and wait for him. He has not
uttered a single word about arrival of appellant Jabir Ali
Shah at the parking place of motorcycle, whereas,
according to Jabir Ali Shah when accused Sahid and Adil

Bacha reached the spot, he meet them, prepared plan and
12

directed accused Adil Bacha to wait for them near the
motorcycle and he alongwith Sahid went towards the house
of the deceased. Again according to statement of appellant
Jabir Ali Shah he told Sahid on phone to bring pistol,
whereas, Adil Bacha who accompanied Sahid to the spot
has not uttered a single word about availability of any
pistol with accused Sahid. Besides, confessional statement
of Jabir Ali Shah is not corroborated by any other strong
evidence. The I.O. has not brought on record, record of text
message sent by accused Sahid to accused Adil Bacha.
Similarly, he has also not procured record of the alleged
call of accused Sahid made to accused Adil Bacha on the
night of occurrence in respect of their visit to the house of
appellant Jabir Ali Shah for chit chat. Similar is the case of
the call of appellant Jabir Ali Shah made by him to accused
Sahid to bring a pistol along with him. The motorcycle
used in the commission of offence has also not been
recovered. Accused Sahid who had been given specific role
of firing at the deceased has not recorded any confessional
statement. For the sake of arguments if the confessional
statement of appellant Jabir Ali Shah is taken into
consideration, the same can only be used as a circumstance
against appellant Sahid, that too, subject to its strong
corroboration by other independent pieces of evidence and
its proof during trial, which is missing in the instant case.

No crime weapon has been shown recovered from from
13

accused Sahid. The two crime empties of .30 bore
recovered from the spot, though have been sent to the FSL,
but only for the purpose of safe custody. There is no FSL
report as to whether these have been fired from one or
more than one weapon.

13. Yet there is another aspect of the case which
further damages the prosecution case. The confessional
statements of the accused have been recorded by Ijaz ur
Rehman Judicial Magistate (PW.10), who in cross-
examination disclosed that appellant Jabir Ali and accused
Adil Bacha were produced before him on 11.08.2012 and
on that very day they did not volunteer to record their
confessional statements. Two days physical custody of the
accused was granted and on 13.08.2014 i.e. expiry of
custody both the accused were produced before him at
12.30 pm through a single application. He admitted it
correct that he has not mentioned that at the time of
recording statement of appellant Jabir Ali Shah, accused
Adil Bacha was made to sit outside the court and similar is
the position when the statement of accused Adil Bacha was
being recorded. He admitted it correct that in the respective
certificates of the accused Adil Bacha and Jabir Ali Shah,
he has not specifically mentioned that he read over to
them their confessional statements in Pashto or so
explained. Ghani Said Khan Inspector (PW.13), who

produced the accused before the learned Judicial
14

Magistrate for recording their confessional statements
admitted it correct that on the first day of their production
the appellants were not ready to confess their guilt,
therefore, their two days physical remand was obtained.
According to the I.O. he produced both the acused for
recording their confessional statements at 11.00 am and
both remained inside the court room till 3.00 p.m.
Statement of the I.O is contradictory with the statement of
Ijaz ur Rehman Judicial Magistrate (PW.10). According to
him the accused were produced before him by the I.O. at
12.30 p.m. and he recorded their statements at 1.45 p.m.
Confessional statements of accused recorded by the
Magistrate, in light of the peculiar facts and circumstances
discussed above being involuntary and result of torture as
well as suffering from mandatory procedural irregularities
is the most suspicious piece of evidence in the whole case,
besides having been retracted. It might be right that
retracted confession, if corroborated by independent
evidence of reliable nature, can be made basis for
conviction on a capital charge, but it must be subject to
thorough judicial scrutiny. It is trite law that for accepting a
confession, two essential requirements must be fulfilled i.e.
the confession was made voluntarily, it was based on true
account of facts, leading to the crime and the same was
proved at the trial. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in case

titled, “Azeem Khan and another Vs Mujahid Khan and
15

others” (2016 SCMR 274) has given strict guidelines for
the Magistrate, recording confession, to be followed
without any exception, which for the sake of convenience
and ready reference are reproduced below:-

“Before recording confession and that too in crime
entailing capital punishment, the recording
Magistrate had to essentially observe all the
mandatory precautions (laid down in the High Court
Rules and Orders). Fundamental logic behind the
same was that, all signs of fear inculcated by the
investigating agency in the mind of the accused
were to be shed out and he was to be provided full
assurance that in case he was not guilty or was not
making a confessional voluntarily then in that case
he would not be handed over back to the police.
Thereafter, sufficient time for reflection was to be
given after the first warning was administered. At
the expiry of such time, recording Magistrate had to
administer the second warning and the accused shall
be assured that now he was in the safe hands. All
police officials whether in uniform or otherwise,
including Naib Court attached to the Court must be
kept outside the court and beyond the view of the
accused. After observing all these legal
requirements if the accused person was willing to
confess then, all required questions as formulated
by the High court Rules and Orders should be put to
him and the answers given, be recorded in the
words spoken by him. Statement of accused should
be recorded by the Magistrate with his own hand
and in case there was a genuine compelling reason
then, a special note was to be given that the same
was dictated to a responsible official of the Court
like stenographer or reader and oath shall also be
administered to such official that he would correctly
type or writ the true and correct version. In case, the
accused was illiterate, and made a confession,

which was recorded in another language i.e. Urdu or
16

English, then the same should be read-over and
explained to him in the language he fully
understood, and thereafter a certificate, as required
under section 364 Cr.P.C. with regard to these
proceedings should be given by the Magistrate
under his seal and signatures and the accused shall
be sent to jail on judicial remand and during this
process at no occasion he shall be handed over to
any police official/officer whether he was Naib
Court wearing police uniform or any other police
official/officer, because such careless dispensation
would considerably diminish the voluntary nature of
the confession, made by the accused.”

14. The above mentioned strict guidelines of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court have not been followed by the
learned Judicial Magistrate at the time of recording the
confessional statement. In this view of the matter, the
confessional statement of the appellant which on one hand
is exculpatory and on the other hand, not corroborated and
proved during trial, is of no legal worth, therefore, is
excluded from consideration in light of the ratio of
judgment (supra) of the Honble Supreme Court.

15. Recovery of blood from the spot, the last worn
bloodstained argument of the deceased, positive Serologist
in respect thereof coupled with postmortem of the
deceased, though confirm the unnatural death of the
deceased with firearm at the spot as alleged by the
prosecution, but never tell the names of the culprit (s).
Such pieces of supporting and corroborative evidence are

always taken into consideration along with direct evidence
17

and not in isolation. In support, reliance can be placed in
on the judgments rendered by the Hon’ble apex court in
Ijaz Ahmed’s case (1997 SCMR 1279 and Asadullah’s
case (PLD 1971 SC 541) and case titled, “Saifullah vs
the State” (1985 SCMR 410)

16. For what has been discussed above, we have no
hesitation to hold that the prosecution has miserably failed
to prove the guilt of the appellant through cogent and
confidence inspiring direct or circumstantial evidence. The
prosecution case is pregnant with doubts benefit of which
should have been extended to the appellant but the learned
trial Court by not appreciating the evidence in its true
perspective arrived at a wrong conclusion by holding the
appellant guilty of the offence. As per golden principle of
benefit of doubt one substantial doubt would be enough for
acquittal of the accused. Under principle enunciated by the
august apex court of the country through different
pronouncements, by now it is settled law that conviction
must be based on unimpeachable evidence and certainty of
guilt and any doubt arising in prosecution case must be
resolved in favour of the accused.

17. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed, conviction and

sentences of the appellant recorded by the learned trial
court vide impugned judgment are hereby set aside and he
is acquitted from the charges leveled against him. He be set

at liberty forthwith, if not confined in any other case.
18

18. On acquittal of the appellant, connected Cr.R.
No.131-P/2017, titled, “Babar Ali Shah vs the State and
others” has become infructuous which is hereby dismissed.
19. These are the reasons of our short order of even
date, which is reproduced below:-
“For reasons to be recorded later this appeal is
allowed, resultantly, conviction and sentences
of appellant, namely, Jabir Ali Shah, recorded
by the learned Judge Juvenile Court/
Additional Sessions Judge-III, Swabi under
section 302(b) PPC vide judgment dated
23.09.2017, in case FIR No.552 dated
05.08.2014, under sections 302/34 PPC,
Police Station Swabi, are hereby set-aside.
The appellant is acquitted from the charge in
the cited case. He be set at liberty forthwith, if
not confined in any other case.
