Date of hearing 10.10.2017

Petitioner: By Anwar-ul-Hag Advocate.

Respondent : State by Shahid Hameed
ureshi, Addl: AG, Others By Muhammad
Rasheed Khan Dhirma Khel and Salah-ud-Din

Marwat, Advocate.

ABDUL SHAKOOR, J.- Through this single

judgment we intend to decide the instant Cr.A No.

32-B / 2014 along-with connected Cr.A No.36-B /

2014, and Cr.R No. 13-B / 2014 as both the

appeals and revision petition have arisen out of the

same judgment and FIR and questions of facts and

law in all the cases are identical.

2. Brief relevant facts of the case as set

out in the FIR are that complainant Hayatullah on

25.10.2016 reported the matter to police to the

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor
-2-

effect that on the eventful at morning time he

along-with his son Amjidullah started from their

village Khoidad Khel on Motor cycle, which was

driving by his son while complainant was sitting

behind him. Near the maize crop of one Yousaf

Khan the path was damaged and complainant

started proceeding by feet while his son was riding

on motor cycle. At about 07:00 hours, in front of

maize crop of Yousaf Khan, accused /appellant

duly armed with Kalashni-kov along-with his co-

accused namely-Abid Khan duly armed with riffle,

were present, who aimed his riffle at son of

complainant saying to stop and the accused Noor

Kamal alias Shahid made firing at him with

intention to commit his murder as a result whereof

the son of complainant got hit and fell down. The

complainant could did nothing being empty

handed and took shelter in ditches “Kurajaat”. The

accused fled away from the crime scene. The

complainant on attending his son found that he

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor
-3-

succumbed to his injuries. Motive for the offence

was disclosed to be dispute over women folk.

3. After completion of investigation

complete challan under section 512 Cr.P.C against

the accused was put in Court as they were

absconding by then. On 23.11.2010

accused/respondent Abid Mir was arrested, and on

completion of necessary investigation,

supplementary challan was submitted against him

for trial. During trial of the accused Abir Mir

appellant Noor Kamal was also arrested. Copies

under section 265-C Cr.P.C were delivered to them

and thereafter they were formally charge sheeted,

to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

4. Trial Ocommenced and the

prosecution in order to prove its case produced as

many as eleven witnesses. After closure of the

prosecution evidence, statements of the accused

were recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein

they pleaded innocence; however, neither they

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor
-4-

wished to produce evidence in defence nor to be

examined on oath under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C.

After conclusion of the trial, the learned trial Court

after hearing arguments of the learned public

prosecutor, assisted by learned counsel for the

complainant and learned counsel for the accused,

acquitted the respondent / accused namely-Abid

Mir while convicted and sentenced the appellant

Shahid Mir alias Noor Kamal in the following

terms:-

1- Under section 302 (b) PPC, as Tazir
the appellant was awarded with the sentence
of life imprisonment alongwith payment of
Rs.1,00,000/- to the legal heirs of deceased
Amjadullah as compensation U/S.544-A
Cr.P.C, and in default whereof he shall
further suffer six (06) months SI. However
benefit of Section. 382-B Cr.P.C, was

extended to appellant / accused.

5. Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of

the learned trial Court, Shahid Amir alias Noor

Kamal, appellant impugned the same through

filing instant Cr. Appeal No. 32-B/2011 while the

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor
-5-

complainant preferred a Criminal Appeal No. 36-B

/ 2014 against acquittal of accused Abid Mir and

Criminal Revision No. 13-B / 2014 _ for

enhancement of the sentences awarded to the

accused / convict.

6. Learned counsel for the accused/

appellant argued that the prosecution has failed to

prove presence of the complainant on the spot, at

the time of occurrence. He next argued that the

complainant is interested eye-witness his statement

is neither corroborative, nor confidence inspiring,

hence could not be relied upon. He further argued

that occurrence has not taken place at the time and

in the mode and manner as alleged by the

prosecution. He vehemently argued that the alleged

case property i.e. the Motorcycle has been taken

into possession by the I.O after many days of the

occurrence. He went on to say that medical

evidence contradicts the version of the

complainant and prosecution has failed to prove

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor
-6-

the motive, as alleged in the FIR. His further

argument was that the FSL reports were produced

at belated stage. He lastly argued that prosecution

has badly failed to bring home charge against the

accused/ appellant, hence, he deserves acquittal

and reversal of conviction and sentence awarded

through impugned judgment of learned trial Court.

7. On the other hand learned A.A.G

assisted by learned counsel for the complainant

vehemently rebutted the arguments advanced by

learned counsel for the accused/ appellant by

contending that report has been lodged promptly

and there is no question of mis identification, as it

is broad day light occurrence and the parties are

well known to each other being relatives and

resident of the same village. They next argued that

solitary statement of complainant is credible and as

such is sufficient to record conviction. Their next

argument was that ocular account is supported by

medical evidence, evidence of recoveries from the

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor
-7-

spot, FSL report coupled with abscondence of

accused. They lastly argued that the prosecution

has proved its case up to the hilt and learned trial

court has rendered a well reasoned judgment

whereby convicted and sentenced the accused/

appellant, which need no interference except that

punishment for the offence provided has not been

awarded to its maximum, which he deserve. They

prayed for dismissal of appeal filed by

accused/appellant, acceptance of criminal revision

for enhancement of sentence and criminal appeal

filed by the complainant against acquittal of co-

accused Abid Mir.

8. Arguments of learned counsel for the

accused/ appellant and learned A.A.G representing

the state assisted by learned counsel for

complainant heard and record perused with their

valuable assistance.

9. Ocular account in this case was

furnished by the sole eye witness/ complainant

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor
-8-

PW-09, Hayatullah, who is father of the deceased,

therefore, his testimony needs to be appreciated

with absolute care and caution. There is no denial

that interestedness or disinterestedness is not the

yardstick for believing or disbelieving a witness,

rather intrinsic worth or inherent merit of the

testimony of a witness is to be considered. In order

to believe an interested witness, first the

prosecution has to satisfy the Court regarding

presence of the witnesses at the spot and secondly

whether he is credible truthful witnesses and

thereafter conviction can be based on testimony of

interested witness, if same is corroborated by some

strong corroborative piece of evidence. Reliance is

placed on case titled “Haroon alias Harooni Vs

the State and another” (1995 SCMR_ 1627) and

“Haji Rab Nawaz Vs Sikandar Zulgarnain and 7

others” 1998 SCMR 25), wherein it is held that:

“One salutary principle laid down
by this Court in this behalf and

which is now firmly established is,

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor
-9-

that in a case involving capital
punishment, the Courts will not
base conviction of an accused
solely on the testimony of interested
witness unless such evidence finds
corroboration by some _ other
independent and unimpeachable
nature of evidence or circumstance
in the case. This rule of prudence
though not statutory in nature, has
been followed by Courts so
consistently through years that it
has come to be recognized almost
as a rule of law. The departure
from this rule is to be found rarely
and in very exceptional
circumstances of a case. Therefore,
to say that the evidence of an
interested witness is to be accepted
solely on the ground that it
remained unshaken during cross-
examination is not a_ correct

proposition.”

10. Complainant Hayatullah appeared before the

court and examined as PW-09, he in his cross examination

stated that:

“The accused did not make firing at
me. I took shelter in KurrajatI had
shown the place to the IO where I
took shelter. (Confronted not so

shown in the site plan). If the accused

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor
-10-

want to kill me, it was easy for them
to commit my murder. No one was
present there, who could rescue me
from the accused.”

11. According to first information report

Ex:PA, the motive behind the occurrence was dispute

over women folk, meaning thereby that both the

deceased and the complainant were having equal enmity

with the accused, but strange enough that the accused

fired at the deceased and left the complainant to depose

against them. The complainant admits in his cross

examination that if the accused wanted to kill him they

could easily kill him and no one was present to rescue

him. In view of this admission of PW-9/ complainant a

clear inference can be drawn that the complainant was

not present at the spot.

12. According to site plan Ex:PW11/1, at the

crime spot there were maize crop and kurrajat. The

complainant admits that he had taken the shelter in

kurrajat. If there was maize crop and kurrajat, the

accused could conceal themselves there and without

showing their identity could accomplish their target of

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor
-ll-

killing the son of complainant. Meaning thereby that the

incident has not been occurred in the mode and manner

as alleged by the complainant.

13. In the occurrence the motorcycle in

question was not taken into possession during spot

inspection, rather it was produced after many days of the

occurrence. Hence, this fact could not corroborate to the

version of prosecution that at the time of occurrence, the

complainant and deceased were riding on motorcycle.

14. Circumstances of the case and intrinsic

worth of statement of witness would determine the

veracity and his credibility. The statement of sole eye

witness cannot be relied upon in absence of any

corroboration. In such eventuality, on the basis of sole

uncorroborated testimony of eye-witness no conviction

can be based.

15. When ocular account of complainant is not

believed then the recoveries, medical report, FSL report and

site plan are not material and do not furnish justification for

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor
-12-

holding that the accused /appellant has committed the

offence.

15. It is the centuries old principle of

administration of criminal justice that prosecution is bound

to prove its case beyond any shadow of doubt. If any

reasonable doubt arises in the prosecution case, the benefit

of the same must be extended to the accused not as a grace

or concession, but as a matter of right lest no innocent be

convicted and punished.

16. The learned trial Court has erred in law by

convicting appellant on the basis of weak type of evidence

of PW-9, which was not corroborated by circumstantial

evidence. It would not be safe to maintain conviction on the

basis of such shaky and scanty evidence. Learned trial court

on one hand believed the evidence for convicting the

appellant while on the other hand disbelieved the same

evidence for the acquittal of co-accused, (against which the

complainant filed criminal appeal No.13-B/2014). Both the

accused, as discussed above, deserve acquittal, but learned

trial court erred in law by acquitting one and convicting

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor
-13-

other, hence, the impugned judgment is liable to be set at

naught.

17. Above are the reasons of our short order of the

even date, which is reproduced herein below:

“For the reasons to be recorded
later, the instant Criminal appeal is
accepted, the impugned judgment of
conviction and sentence dated
17.02.2014, passed by learned
Sessions Judge, Lakki Marwat is set
aside and consequently the appellant
Shahid Amir alias Noor Kamal is
acquitted of the charges leveled
against him. He be set at liberty
forthwith if not required in any other
case. Connected Cr. A No.36-B/2014
and Cr.R_ No.13-B/2014 stand
dismissed.”
