thereof to suffer further six months S.J. Benefit u/s

382-B, Cr.P.C was extended to him.

2. According to the initial report made by
complainant Aman Ullah Khan (PW-11) recorded
through Murasila (Ex.PW-11/1) on 16.06.2016 at
04:30 hours in emergency ward of D.H.Q Hospital
Timergara, he was present in his house after taking
sehri; on hearing fire shots, he came out of his house
and saw his brother Adam Khan lying in injured
condition. His niece Mst. Samania Bibi (PW-12)
(daughter of the deceased), who was present near her
injured father, informed him that her uncle Muheeb
Ulah (the present appellant) caused injuries to her
father through firing. The motive behind the
occurrence was stated to be domestic quarrels. The
complainant further informed the police that the
occurrence has been witnessed by Mst. Samania

Bibi and other inmates of the house.

3. After recording report of the
complainant, Sher Zada Khan S.I (PW-17) prepared
injury sheet (Ex.PW-17/1) of deceased then injured
and also obtained certificate (Ex.PW-14/3) from
Dr. Imdad-ul-Haq (PW-14) who was on duty in the

casualty room at the relevant time. According to the

Tofamul/Ps*

OB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag ibrahim
‘ble Mr, i ar Ahm:

said certificate, the doctor opined that the deceased
then injured was unable to talk. After examining the
deceased then injured, the doctor gave the following
findings in his report Ex.PW-14/1 on the injury

sheet.

Adam Khan S/O Haidar Khan was brought to’
Emergency Room on 16.06.2016 at 4.09 A.M as
firearms injury case. ‘

1. An entrance of about 3 mm’ on left perinatal of
the scalp with mild bleeding and crush bones.

2. An exit wound of about 6 mm? with averted
edges on the right side of the temporal region at
the same level of entry wound. The exit wound
contained brain contents and broken bones.

GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) was 3/15 (E-1, V-1,
M-1) with constricted left pupils.

Patient was referred to Peshawar with paramedical
cover but was died in the way.

Nature of Trauma: FAI.
Nature of injury: Homicidal.

Cause of death: Damage to the brain caused by
firearm.

Time of death: 08:45 A.M.

As I have finished my shift of duty at .
08:00 A.M and I did not act any call for the post-
mortem of the said deceased, as such, post mortem
was not conducted by me.

4. The matter was initially investigated by
Fazal Ghafoor Khan SI (PW-13). During spot
inspection, he prepared site plan Ex.PW-13/1 on
pointation of Mst. Samania Bibi (PW-12). He
recovered two crime empties of 7.62 bore as well as
blood-stained earth from the spot and secured the
same through recovery memo Ex.PW-13/5 and

Ex.PW-8/1 respectively. He also took into

possession torn clothes of the deceased vide
recovery memo Ex.PW-13/3 and took six
photographs of the dead body and place of
occurrence which are available on the record as
Ex.PW-13/6. Since the appellant was absconder,
therefore, the LO moved application for issuance of
warrant 204 consequent upon which non-bailable
warrant of arrest Ex.PW-16/1 was issued against the
appellant, however, he could not be arrested,
therefore, proclamation u/s 87, Cr.P.C (Ex.PW-16/3)

was issued against him on 23.06.2016.

5. After arrest of the appellant on
06.09.2016 by SHO of P.S Balamabat, further
investigation in the case was conducted by Noor
Ghani Khan SI (PW-4) who received two CNICs
(Urdu and English version) with passport, an
affidavit and mobile phone from Muharrir of P.S
Balamabat which had been recovered from the
appellant at the time of his arrest. He also recovered
a Kalashnikov, the alleged crime weapon, with nine
rounds on pointation of the appellant from the house
of one Rehan Gul. The recovery memo in this regard
is Ex.PW-4/3, pointation memo is Ex.PW-4/4
whereas the sketch of recovery is Ex.PW-4/5. The

weapon alongwith the crime empties were sent to

F.S.L, the non-matching report received in this

regard from the lab is Ex.PW-4A/1.

6. After completion of investigation
supplementary challan was put in Court against the
appellant. On commencement of trial, he was
confronted with the formal charge, however, he did
not plead guilty and opted to face the trial, hence,
the prosecution produced and examined as many as
eighteen witnesses in support of its case against him
and closed the evidence. When examined u/s 342,
Cr.P.C, the appellant once again denied the
allegation of prosecution by claiming innocence. He
recorded his own statement on oath in terms of
section 340(2), Cr.P.C as DW-1 wherein he raised
the plea of alibi by narrating that at the relevant
night of the occurrence he was in Kashmir in
connection with earning his livelihood, however, he
did not produce any witness in support of his above
version. On conclusion of trial, the learned trial
Court found him guilty of the charge and sentenced
him in the manner already discussed in the earlier

part of this judgment, hence, this appeal.

Zz. We have paid our anxious consideration

to the arguments advanced by learned counsel for

the parties including the learned counsel
representing the State and perused the record with

their able assistance.

& Complainant Aman Ullah Khan
(PW-11) is admittedly not an eye witness of the
occurrence as he had attracted to the spot after
hearing the fire shots, however, Mst. Samania Bibi
(PW-12) claims to have witnessed the appellant
firing at her father. According to her, she was
carrying water in ewer for her father for the purpose
of ablution and while going in front of him towards
the washroom situated outside of the main gate, the
appellant fired at her father and she identified him in
the light of bulbs. The credibility of this witness is to
be adjudged in light of evidence regarding two
crucial points i.e her presence on the spot at the time
of occurrence and her claim that she had identified

the appellant at night time.

According to the injury sheet and
photographs of the deceased on record, the deceased
was a healthy man of 49/50 years of age. There is no
evidence on the record to suggest that he was an
infirm or ailing person and was depending on others

in carrying out his ‘routine activities including

Tajamul/Ps*

DB: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim.
Hon’ble Mr, Justice Winer Ahmad

-7-

carrying of water to washroom for making ablution.
Thus, there is no logic in the prosecution version
that the eye witness was performing a job for her
father which he could easily accomplish without the
help of his daughter. Even otherwise, the eye
witness was a young girl of 25/26 years at the time
of occurrence; the washroom is situated outside of
the main gate and a thoroughfare is also passing in
front of the house of deceased. In the mentioned
setup, the stance of the eye witness that despite of
her fair sex and young age she was leading her
father at mid night outside of her house for a pity job
also seems ludicrous keeping in view the general
temperament of the people of the society. Thus, the
reason mentioned by the eye witness regarding her
presence near her father is not believable. Moreso,
the L.O has also failed either to take the ewer in
possession through a recovery memo or assign any
point to it in the site plan to prove the aforesaid

version of the alleged eye witness.

Close perusal of the statement recorded
by the eye witness further shows that she had woke
up at 02:30 A.M but exactly the same time has been
shown as the time of occurrence in Murasila. She

admitted in her cross-examination that after washing

-8-

her face and hands she had taken the sehri which
would have obviously consumed some time then
how it was possible for her to accompany her father
at 02:30 hours for the purpose of taking water for
him to washroom. No doubt, photographic
narrations of the occurrence from a witness cannot
be expected more particularly when he/she records
statement after two years of the occurrence,
however, the events and time mentioned by the eye
witness in her statement do not coincide with the
contents of murasila vis-a-vis the time of
occurrence, hence her presence on the spot with her
father at the time of firing is doubtful, therefore, her
statement cannot be relied upon for maintaining |

conviction of the appellant.

9 Even otherwise, if it is presumed for a
while that the alleged eye witness was present on the
spot even in that eventuality the identification of the
appellant by her at midnight is an important aspect
of the case which needs cautious attention by this
Court. The time of occurrence is 02:30 A.M at
midnight and according to prosecution, the alleged
eye witness had identified the appellant in light of
electric bulbs installed in the surrounding but the 1.0

neither took any bulb from any place around the

Tofamut/rs+|

OB: Hon’ble Mr, Justice Ishtiag (brahins

Hon'ble Mr, Justice Winar Ahmad

-9-
place of occurrence nor he assigned any point to a
single bulb in the site plan to support the above
claim of the PW. Thus, the prosecution has badly
failed to prove the source of light on or near the
place of occurrence to corroborate the assertion of
the alleged eye witness regarding identification of
the appellant in the pitch dark, therefore, her
testimony to this effect, being suspect evidence, is
also not believable. Wisdom is drawn from the
judgment of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan

in the case of Muhammad Arshad Vs. The State

(PLD 1995 S.C 475). The principle laid down in the

said judgment is as follows.

The principle to be extracted from the
decided case thus is that the evidence of
visual identification is one of the categories of
“suspect evidence’ and that ordinarily it is not
safe to convict on the basis of such evidence
without a corroboration. Indeed, — in
exceptional circumstances, that is, where the
evidence of visual identification is of
exceptionally good quality, such as, where the
offender was known to the witness, there was
sufficient light, the witness had had an
unobstructed view of the offender and there
was a dialogue between the witness and the
offender, the evidence may be acted upon.

No doubt, in the present case the eye
witness is closely related to the appellant and there

was possibility of his identification by the eye

Tajamul/Ps*;

OB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag (brahim:
‘I u ¢ Ama:

-10-
witness through his voice, however, there is no
evidence on the record to prove that prior to the
occurrence the appellant had either talked with the
deceased or with the eye witness, therefore, her
claim with regard to identification of the appellant in
the mentioned circumstances does not inspire

confidence. Further reliance is placed on Haroon

Shafique Vs. The Stateand others (2018 SCMR 2118)
and Abdul Hayat Vs. The State (2011 MLD 886

’ Peshawar).

10. In addition to above, the assailant
chose the nocturnal time for killing the deceased to
conceal his identity and for that purpose he must
have taken all necessary precautions in view
whereof it was not so easy for the eye witness to
identify him in the mode and manner she has
narrated in her statement. In other words, if the
statement of the eye witness is believed it would
mean that the assailant had willfully exposed his
identity to her at the time of firing. If that was the
aim of the assailant he would have never chosen the
night time for committing the crime rather he would
have committed the same in broad daylight. In
addition to that, it is also in the evidence of

prosecution that the deceased had enmities and

.1l-
disputes with other people in the area. So, keeping in
view the time as well as mode and manner of the
occurrence, identification of the appellant by the eye
witness is doubtful. Reference in this regard is made
to the judgment of this Court in the case of

Muhammad _Arif Vs.State and another (PLJ 1999
Cr.C (Peshawar) 579 (DB) wherein it-was held that:

“The occurrence had taken place at 0600
hours i.e one hour before the sun-rise time. It
is a matter of common observation that one
hour before sun-rise time is always pitch
dark. The said time was chosen by the
assailant only and only in order to conceal his
identity. That is why he fired from behind
causing all the three inlet wounds at the back
side of the body which also contained
charring marks”.

Thus, looking at the attending
circumstances of the present case through the prism
of the above-referred case law, identification of the
appellant by the alleged eye witness Mst. Samania
Bibi is not free from doubt, the benefit of which

must be given to appellant as per well settled

principle of criminal justice.

il. Coming to circumstantial evidence of
the case, no doubt, death of the deceased per medical
evidence was the result of firearm injury on his

head, however, the medical evidence by itself cannot

Talamuyes|

oB: Hon'ble Mr, Justice ishtiag Ibrahim.
Ne Mr, i,
-12-
prove that the said firearm injury was caused to
deceased by the present appellant. Moreso,
according to the site plan, the eye witness has been
shown at Point No.3 falling between the deceased
and appellant. The appellant has been shown at Point
No.2 near the southern wall of the washroom which
is not visible from Point No. 3 because of the
intervening corner of the washroom between them.
The 1.0 has taken photographs of the place of
occurrence but no photo is available on record to
show all the points ie 1, 2, 3 & A at the same time
to confirm visibility of Point No.2 from Point No.3
assigned to the appellant and eye witness
respectively in the site plan. Similarly, the direction
and locale of entry and exit wounds on the head of
deceased are also not supported by site plan.
Furthermore, according to F.S.L report Ex PW-4/7,
the alleged crime weapon recovered on pointation of
the appellant/convict is not matching with the two
crime empties recovered from the spot. Thus, the
different pieces of circumstantial evidence, being in
conflict with each other, do not support the

prosecution version.

12, The complainant has alleged the motive
behind the occurrence as the domestic quarrels but
prosecution has not produced any evidence in
support of the said motive. No doubt, absence or
weakness of motive by itself is not a proof of
innocence of an accused, however, this shortcoming
of the case in addition to other evidence of doubtful
nature brought on the record is sufficient to create

further suspicion in the story of prosecution.

13. - Although the appellant has remained
absconder for almost three months but abscondence
per se is not a proof of his guilt. It is settled law that
conviction of an accused cannot be based only on his
abscondence when otherwise the prosecution fails to

prove its case through direct and circumstantial

. evidence of unimpeachable character. Reliance is

placed on the judgment of the august Supreme Court
of Pakistan in the case titled “Muhammad Sadig V/s.
The State” (2017 SCMR 144) wherein it was held

that:

“The fact that the appellant absconded
and was not traceable for considerably -
long period of time could also not be made
sole basis for his conviction when the
other evidence of the prosecution is
doubtful as it is riddled with
contradictions”.

OB: Hon'ble Mr. tustice Ishtlaq (brahim.
Hon'ble Mr, Justi im:

14. For what has been discussed above,
prosecution has failed to prove its case against the
appellant beyond shadow of reasonable doubt,
therefore, his conviction and sentence by the trial

through the impugned judgment cannot sustain.

Resultantly, this appeal is allowed, judgment of the
trial dated 22.11.2018 is set aside and appellant
Muheeb Ullah son of Haidar Khan is acquitted of the

charge in the present case. He be released forthwith

from jail if not required in any other case.
