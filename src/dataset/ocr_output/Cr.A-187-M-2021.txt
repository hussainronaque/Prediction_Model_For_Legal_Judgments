2. Necessary facts of the case are that the

complainant, Wahid-ur-Rehman (PW-2), reported the
matter to the local police in Police Station Chakdara
that on 16.09.2019, he, alongwith his father and other
family members, was present in his house. At about
10:30 hours, on hearing noise outside his house, he
came out and saw a man who was forcibly setting his
minor daughter aged about 4/5 years on a motorcycle,
while she was weeping. When he shouted, the man fled
away from the spot and left the minor girl alongwith
the motorcycle. The complainant and his father chased
him and caught hold of him with the help of
co-villagers. On checking his CNIC, he was identified
Zakir Khan son of Said Raziq, a resident of Ouch
Shargi, Koz Palow (CNIC # 15302-2190807-5),
now appellant before us. The occurrence besides him,
was statedly witnessed by Amir Zaman son of
Abdul Mateen Khan and Hidayatullah son of
Muhammad Nabi. He charged the appellant for
abducting his minor daughter, namely,
Mst. Khalor Bibi, for sexual abuse, on which,

the aforesaid FIR (Ex:PA) was lodged.

3. On completion of investigation, challan
was submitted against the appellant Zakria Khan
before the learned trial Court, who was supplied copies

HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL

from the relevant record u/s. 265-C, Cr.PC. Charge

was farmed against him, to which he pleaded not guilty

and claimed trial.

4. The prosecution examined as many as
eleven (11) PWs and thereafter, statement of the
appellant/convict was recorded u/s. 342, Cr.PC,
wherein he denied all the allegations leveled against
him by the prosecution and professed innocence. He
also recorded his statement on oath u/s.340(2), Cr.P.C.
However, he did not opt for producing evidence

in defence.

5. After hearing arguments of the learned
A.P.P, for the State, and learned counsel for the parties,
the learned trial Judge vide the impugned judgment
dated 30.06.2019, convicted the appellant Zakria Khan
and sentenced him as under:

i, U/s.364-A read with section 511, PPC, to
undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10
years and also imposed a_ fine
R.100,000/- (rupees one lac);

ii. U/s. 53, CPA, to undergo ten years
rigorous imprisonment and imposed
fine of Rs.100,000/- (rupees one lac).

However, benefit of section 382-B,

Cr.P.C., was extended to the appellant/convict.

6. Being aggrieved, the appellant preferred

the instant appeal Cr.A No.187-M/2019 for his
acquittal in the case while the respondent/complainant
filed a revision petition Cr.R No.43-M/2019 for

enhancement of sentences awarded to the appellant.

7. We have heard arguments of learned
counsels for the appellants/accused, learned counsel

for the complainant as well as the learned Additional

Advocate General, for the State and perused the record.

8. The crucial aspect of the case in hand is
that the minor girl, namely, Mst. Khalor Bibi, aged
about 4/5 years, the victim of the crime was not
examined in the manner as required. She was produced
for evidence at the trial on 18.02.2021. The trial Court
recorded an observation that she was found not capable
of giving evidence. Probably the learned trial Court
found her too young to record her testimony. She was
the star witness of the prosecution. In spite of the fact
that on observation she was not found capable as a
witness, we believe that the learned trial Court should
have gone further before simply abandoning the crucial
exercise as part of the trial. Subject to the conditions
laid down in Articles 3 and 17 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 (Q.S.O), there is no bar on the

competency of a child to be a witness irrespective of

‘Bait Sher altiStenographer (0.8) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL
5
e his/her age. A close reading of the above referred

provisions evinces that a witness, including most
particularly, a child in the personal context must pass
what is known as the “rationality test”, which means
the capacity and intelligence of a witness to understand
the question put to him and the ability to rationally

respond to question. In the case of Raja Khurram Ali

Khan_and 2 others vs Tayyaba Bibi_and_ another,
reported’ as PLD 2020 Supreme Court 146 [Supreme
Court_of Pakistan], our Supreme Court has observed
that as compared to our judicial approach, Courts in
other jurisdictions are more interactive with child
witnesses during recording of their entire evidence.
The Court has referred to a 1993 case, in which, the
Canadian Supreme Court designed three pronged
\y criteria of the capacity to observe (including
interpretation), recollect and communicate. The
relevant para of the judgment may be reproduced as
under:
“46. In other common law jurisdiction, the
Courts are more inter-active with the child
witnesses during the recording of their entire
evidence, Justice McLachlin, speaking for the
Canadian Supreme Court in the case of R. v.
Marquard [1993] 4 S.CR. 223, has explained
with precision the competency of the child

witness, by stipulating the following criteria for
testing the same in terms:

-+(I) the capacity to observe (including

interpretation); (2) the capacity to
recollect; and (3) the capacity to
communicate... The judge must satisfy

Bohhs Sher al/Stenographer (0.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM
JON’BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. ID JOBA
6

\ him or herself that the witness possesses
these capacities. Is the witness capable
of observing what was happening? Is he
or she capable of remembering what he
or she observes? Can he or she
communicate what he or she remembers?
The goal is not to ensure that the
evidence is credible, but only to assure
that it meets the minimum threshold of
being receivable. ......Generally speaking,
the best gauge of capacity is the witness's
performance at the time of trial...
[T]he test outlines the basic abilities that
individuals need to possess if they are to
testify. The threshold is not a high one.
What is required is the basic ability to
perceive, remember and communicate.
[once] This established, deficiencies of
perception, recollection of the events at
issue may be dealt with as matters going
to weight of the evidence.”

9, Our Supreme Court urged the Courts to
follow the above referred approach and _ strongly
advised for compliance of the directions given in paras

49 and 50, which are reproduced as below:

“49. In other jurisdictions, we note that great
care is taken to ensure that such child
witnesses are able to depose their testimony
at ease. By taking measures in the court
room to lessen their stress and anxiety of
court-room appearances in such a tender
age. Such measures include child witness aid
in testifying, screens in court rooms, closed
courtrooms and counsellor aid before and
after recording of evidence, which needs to
be adopted and practiced in our jurisdiction
in cases wherein a child victim is to appear as
a witness. In this regard, we expect the
respective governments to take appropriate
legislative and administrative measures for
ensuring the much needed protection and
facilitation of child witnesses.

Bokkt Sher AlUStenographer (6.8) z CE MUHAMMAD NAEEM
HON BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID JOBAL

50. As for the presiding trial Court judges,
they should take appropriate steps during
the court proceedings to ensure that the
child witnesses depose their testimony with
cease, and that too, in a_ stress-free
environment. In cases where the child
witness is unable to depose in the court
room, and his evidence is ‘necessary’ to find
the truth, and it has a ring of ‘circumstantial
trustworthiness’, then courts, as practiced in
other common law jurisdictions, may
consider in appropriate cases, allowing out-
of-court evidence, as an exception to the
‘hearsay rule’. Wigmore, a notable American
scholar on the law of evidence, in his book
Wigmore on Evidence, Volume 5 (Chadbourn
rev. 1974), identified two considerations,
which may serve as an exception to the
‘hearsay rule’: ‘a circumstantial probability of
trustworthiness, and a necessity for the
evidence.”

10. In the case in hand, the learned trial judge
did not take a pain to ensure the victim speak to the
Court. We believe and expect the trial Court judges to

follow these guidelines in such like cases.

11. We may here add a perspective from the
UK’s Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act, 1999
(text of the law at Attps://www legislation. gov.uk/
ukpga/1999/23/content, last accessed on 12/03/2023).
The law provides that all persons irrespective of age
are competent to give evidence. However, the witness
must be able to understand the question put to him as a
witness and he/she give answers to questions which
can be understood. It means a witness must be able to
understand the question and the answer given must be

capable of being understood (Section 53).

Bekht Sher aldStenographer (.8) HON BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr, KHURSHID JOBAL

12. The law further provides that in criminal

proceedings, a child under the age of 18 at the time of
hearing is eligible for assistance on the ground of age
[S. 16 (1) (a)]. The time of hearing means the stage in
the trial when the court has to make a determination
for the purpose of special measures direction under

section 19(2).

13. Once the court has determined that a
witness is eligible for assistance [a child by virtue of
section 16 (1) (a)], it must then determine that any one
or more special measures would be likely to improve

the quality of evidence given by the witness.

14. The special measures the law provides
are:

e Screening witness from accused
e Evidence by live link

e Evidence given in private

* Removal of wigs and gowns

e Video recorded evidence in chief,
cross-examination or re-examination

e Examination of witness through intermediary
Aids to communication (sections 23-30).

15. The purpose of the law is to help
disadvantaged witnesses, such as, children under the
age of 18, and those suffering with mental disorder or
otherwise has significant impairment of intelligence

and social functioning. The law lays down a host of

Bett Sher AlUStenographer (0.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAGEM ANWAR
ON" ICE Or. KHURSHID IOBAl
9
special measures which a court may employ to

improve the quality of such vulnerable witnesses.
Often a child abuse case hinges on the evidence of just
one witness, as the victim of a crime. The special
measures per the law helps make such witness to give
better evidence and more confidently in a milieu of
juvenile justice. Perhaps, it may be more helpful to
follow the observations of the above referred
observations of the Supreme Court as another best

practice example.

16. Coming to the remaining ocular account,
the same comprises of the deposition of Amir Zaman
Khan (PW1) and Wahid-ur-Rehman, the complainant/
father of the victim (PW2), respectively. The
deposition of PW2/complainant would reveal that on
the day of occurrence (16.09.2019 at 10:30 am), while
he was present in his house alongwith his father,
he heard noise. When came out of his house, he saw
that the appellant had forcibly made his daughter,
the victim, sit on the motorcycle and she was shouting.
When he asked him, the appellant left the motorcycle
and tried to run away from the scene. His father and
other residents also came out and took hold of him
after having been chased. He alleged that the appellant
was abducting the victim for sexual assault.

Bakht Sher alifStenographer (0.8) HON’BL! JUSTICE MU AMM. FY NI
JON'BL! USTIC! It
10
PWI1 rather furnished a shorter deposition in his

examination-in-chief, which shows that on the day of
the occurrence, while he was going to purchase some
grocery items from a shop in village Adam Dherai, he
got attracted on the noise, saw that the appellant was
abducting the victim on his motorcycle. The appellant
was chased by him, the father and grandfather of the
victim and other residents of the village and taken hold
of him alongwith the motorcycle. The cross
examination of PW2 divulges that when he came out,
he saw that the motorcycle of the appellant was not in
started condition and the victim was sitting on the
motorcycle and at that time, no other person was there.
The cross examination of PW1 shows that when he
reached to the spot, he saw the victim sitting on the
motorcycle and the appellant not sitting there but was
trying to run away. The deposition further shows that
when he reached the spot, he saw that the appellant
was sitting on the motorcycle and was trying to run
away. That the victim was sitting on the front part of
the motorcycle. The appellant was not holding her and
she was weeping. It is, thus, doubtful as in which mode
and manner both the PWs witnessed the occurrence.
The circumstances show that the appellant could easily
run away even while successfully abducting the victim
while sitting on the motorcycle. PW1, in one breath

deposed that when he reached, the appellant was not

Bathe Sher audStenographer —_ (0.5) HONBLE MB, IUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAFEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Or, KHURSHID IOBAL
11
sitting on the motorcycle and was trying to decamp. In

the next breath, he stated that when he reached, the
appellant was sitting on the motorcycle and was trying
to decamp. Then, if the victim was sitting on the
motorcycle and weeping and not in clutches of the
appellant, she was surely to fell down if the appellant

was trying to run away on the motorcycle.

17. The site plan of the occurrence depicts
that the house of the complainant party to the west and
a vacant house of one Muhammad Iqbal, to the east of
the public thoroughfare, which turns towards west. The
aforesaid public path of village Adam Dherai at points
3A, Al and 4A in the south turns towards west.
Towards the south of the public path, the open fields of
the village are shown. The site plan does not depict the
house of the PW1. It is doubtful as to whether he is a
resident of the same locality and how he suddenly got
attracted to the spot. The prosecution contended that
there were so many other residents of the village who
successfully overpowered the appellant and took him
to the Police Station alongwith the motorcycle, but no
other witnesses were examined as witnesses of the

occurrence,

18. Regarding the allegation of abduction for
the purpose of sexual assault, PW1 remained silent

except the statement of PW2 (complainant), there is no

Bakkt Sher Au/Stenographer (D.8) Ni!

BLE MR. iM MAO NAEEI
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID [OBAL

12
other evidence of the prosecution. Moreover, the

Investigating Officer (PW10) did not record the
statement of the victim. He did not verify the site plan
from the victim. The I.O did not confirm whether the
victim was capable to record her statement. He did not
record statements of the owners of the nearby fields

depicted in the site plan.

19. We would now advert to the previous
involvement of the appellant and a family suit his wife
filed against him due to his implication in the present
case and her application that she wants divorce from
him because of his habit of abducting children. MHC
Abbas Khan (PW6), after having recorded the report of
the complainant in the shape of the FIR, inquired from
the Police Station of Ouch about the Appellant. He was
informed that another FIR No.340 dated 17.06.2018
u/ss. 364-A, PPC read with 53 CPA in that Police
Station was registered against him, in which, he was

stated to have been released on bail.

20. After having been examined uw/s.342,
Cr.P.C, the appellant availed opportunity of recording
his statement on oath u/s.340(2) of the Cr.P.C. In his
statement on oath, while denying the charge, he
deposed that on the eventful day, he was in Chakdara

Bazar in connection with preparing a photo of his own

Bakht Sher Al/Stenographer (D.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MUNAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL
13
that was required to be annexed with his application

for employment in the rescue 1122. He stated that there
was a CCTV camera in front of the shop. He further
deposed that he was also purchasing Kheer (pudding)
for his daughter from a milk shop, for which purpose
he entered in the shop and when he came out, found his
motorcycle missing. While he was standing there, the
complainant came there and started an altercation with
him, at a result of which, he was taken to the Police
Station. He complained that the CCTV photage was
not obtained by the I.O despite his repeated requests
and rather he was brutally beaten as a result of which
he became ill. In this respect he also produced copies
of his medical treatment comprising of 25 pages. The
statement further shows that when he came to know
that his motorcycle was missing, he made a cellular
call from his SIM No.0344-9773642 to his home but
the CDR was not obtained despite his repeated
requests. He admitted that legally he can have more
than one SIMS of his mobile phone. He also deposed
that he has been implicated in the case due to his
political affiliations. While under cross examination,

he stated that he holds a master degree in Physics,

Bakht Sher Al/Stenographer (0.8) HON'BLE U |AEEM.
HON'ALE MR. JUSTICE Br, KHURSHID IOBAL
14
working as a clerk in the Deputy Commissioner office

and that he is under the legal bar not to take part in
politics. He admitted having made no report regarding
missing his motorcycle. He stated that he does not
know a village, Adam Dherai. He stated that he was
acquitted in the previous criminal case u/s. 364-A,
PPC. Regarding the family suit, he admitted that the
same was filed against him, but later on, his wife
withdrew it. He produced photocopy of the
compromise deed dated 11.02.2020 Ex:PW/D1. The
aforesaid document shows that his wife had withdrawn
the family suit and denied from having made any
application that the appellant was involved in

abduction of children.

21. On the strength of above reappraisal of
evidence, we have reached to the conclusion that the
prosecution has failed to bring home the charge against
the appellant beyond any shadow of doubt. At the trial,
the victim as not examined at all. While there could not
be no gainsaying the face the victim was observed as a
witness, the Court did not make a demonstrable
endeavour to establish it. The I.O did not a Medical

Doctor about her exact age and her prudence and

HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dy. KHURSHID JOBAL

15
rationality to stand as an efficient witness. Then, no

independent witness was brought forward by the
prosecution despite the fact that a mob chased the
appellant. The efforts of the complainant party that the
appellant’s wife sought dissolution of marriage due to
his alleged involvement in abduction of children,
having disproved badly, suggest some mala fide. It is a
settled law that even a single reasonable doubt is
sufficient to record acquittal. In the case of Khalid
Mehmood alias Khaloo vs The State, reported as 2022

SCMR 1148, wherein it was held as infra:

“It is a settled law that single
circumstance creating reasonable
doubt in a prudent mind about the
guilt of accused makes him entitled to
its benefits, not as a matter of grace
and concession but as a matter of
right. The conviction must be based
on unimpeachable, trustworthy and
reliable evidence. Any doubt arising in
prosecution's case is to be resolved in
favour of the accused and burden of
proof is always on prosecution to
prove its case beyond reasonable
shadow of doubt. However, as
discussed above, in the present case
the prosecution has failed to prove its

case beyond any reasonable shadow

of doubt.
Rakht Sher Ai/Stenographer {0.8} HON'BLE MR. [USTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr, KHURSHID JOBAL
Y

16

Similarly, in the case of Najaf Ali Shah vs. The
State (202]_ SCMR_ 736), the august Supreme Court

has observed that:

“It is a well settled principle of law that
for the accused to be afforded this
right of the benefit of the doubt it is
not necessary that there should be
many circumstances creating
uncertainty and if there is only one
doubt, the benefit of the same must
go to the petitioner.”

And the same principle was reiterated in the case,

The State through P.G. Sindh and others versus
Ahmed Omar Sheikh and others, reported as 2021

SCMR 873.

“It is settled since centuries that
benefit of doubt automatically goes in
favour of an accused. Even if a single
circumstance creates _ reasonable
doubt in a prudent mind regarding
guilt of an accused then the accused
shall be entitled to such benefit not as
a matter of grace and concession but
as a matter of right and such benefit
must be extended to the accused
person(s) by the Courts without any
reservation.”

22. Resultantly, we allow the instant appeal
Cr.A No.187-M/2019 by setting aside the impugned
judgment dated 30.06.2021 of the learned Additional

Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi/Judge Child Protection

Bakht Sher AlilStenographer (0.8) HON'BLE MR, [JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE Dz, KHURSHID JOBAL
17
Court, Dir Lower at Chakdara and acquit the appellant

of the charges leveled against him. He shall be released
forthwith from the jail, if not required in any other
case. Whereas, the connected Cr.R No. 43-M/2019,
filed by the respondent/complainant Wahid-ur-Rehman
for enhancement of convictions/sentences awarded
to the appellant being became infructuous, stands

dismissed.

23, These are the reasons of our short order of

the even date.
