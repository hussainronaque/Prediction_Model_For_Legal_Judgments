AHMAD ALI, J.- Accused/petitioner, Kaleem Anwar,
seeks his post arrest bail in case F.I.R No.208 dated
14.09.2018 under sections 302/324/109/427/417/34 of
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, read with section 15 AA
KPK registered at Police Station Beer, Haripur.

2. The allegations against the accused/
petitioner are that on 14.09.2016 at ‘Namashan Wella’,
he alongwith acquitted co-accused committed ‘Qatl-i-
Amd’ of Ali Asghar and Malik Iftikhar Khan and caused
injuries to Maqsood-ur-Rehman and ineffective firing
upon the complainant, Hafeez-ur-Rehman.

3. Arguments heard. Record perused.

4. Perusal of record would reveal that

accused/petitioner, Kaleem Anwar alongwith co-accused
Naeem Anwar, Waseem Anwar, Faheem Anwar,
Nadeem Anwar is directly charged for commission of the
offence at the instance of their father, Muhammad
Anwar. The role attributed to the present accused/
petitioner in the commission of the offence is that of
committing murder of Malik Iftikhar Khan. All the co-
accused having similar role, particularly, co-accused
Naeem Anwar have already been acquitted by the learned
trial Court after extending benefit of doubt to them vide
judgment dated 16.12.2019. The alleged recovery of
‘kalashinkov’ from possession of the accused/petitioner
after four years would be seen by the learned trial Court
after recording evidence. Mere abscondence is no
ground to refuse bail to the accused/petitioner,
particularly, when it calls for further inquiry. It has been
held in the case of ‘Ehsan Ullah vs. The State’ (2012
SCMR 1137) that ‘/t is settled law that in a case calling
for further inquiry into the guilt of an accused person
bail is to be allowed to him as a of right and not by way
of grace on concession and in such a case mere
absconsion of the relevant accused person may not be
sufficient to refuse bail to him.’ This Court considers that
accused/petitioner cannot be kept in jail when his role is
at par with that of acquitted co-accused and his guilt is to

be adjudged by the learned trial Court on the same
evidence on the basis of which co-accused were
acquitted. This Court in the case titled ‘Naseer Vs. The
State_and_ another’ (2019 P.Cr.L.J Note 136) has
observed as under:-

“Thus in a situation where the acquitted co-
accused, namely, Basheer, charged with a
similar and identical role in the FIR by the
complainant/deceased as that of the accused-
petitioner and on the same set of evidence, he
was acquitted of the charge in appeal, then such
acquittal per se takes the case of the
accused/petitioner to one of further enquiry,
notwithstanding the fact that he remained
absconder for a sufficient long time. It needs no
reiteration that if an accused is otherwise held
entitled to the concession of bail, then
abscondence alone shall not come in his way.”

Thus, in view of the above, since identical role ascribed
to accused/petitioner by the complainant, requires
‘further inquiry’ into his guilt qua commission of the
offence, as envisages in subsection 2 of section 497
Cr.P.C, he is entitled to be released on bail in the peculiar
facts and circumstances of the case.

5. Before parting with this order, this court
finds it necessary to mention that all the observations
recorded above are tentative assessment just for the
disposal of bail petition and not intended to influence the
mind of trial Court, which is free to appraise the evidence

strictly in accordance with law and merits of the case in

view of law laid down in (1996 SCMR 1845).
6. For the reasons mentioned above, this bail
petition is accepted and accused/petitioner is admitted to
bail provided he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of
Rs.200,000/- (Rupees Two lacs) with two sureties each in
the like amount to the satisfaction of [/laqa/Duty Judicial
Magistrate, concerned, who shall ensure that the sureties
are local, reliable and men of means.

7. Above are the detailed reasons for short
order of this Court of even date.

Dt. 11-05-2020.
