QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- In the instant
criminal appeal, the convict/appellants, Aitbar
Shah, Bawar Shah and Gulzar sons of Hajab
Shah, Lal Bahadar son of Mugqadar Shah and

Sher Zamin son of Aitbar Shah, assailed
judgment dated 04.08.2016 of the leaned trial
Court/Additional Sessions Judge-l, Swabi,
whereby, all the five appellants were
convicted under section 302 (b) PPC and
sentenced to death as Ta’zir on two counts for
the Qatl-i-amd of deceased Qaiser and
Munaris Khan, and also made liable to pay
compensation under section 544-A Cr.P.C to
the tune of Rs:500000/- to the legal heirs of
the two deceased, recoverable from them as
arrears of land revenue; and, owing to want of
property, to further S.I for six months. In
addition to the sentence of death, the
appellants were also convicted under section
324 PPC for attempting to commit qatl-i-amd
of the complainant, Falak Sher, and PWs
Naser and Ajmal; and sentenced to undergo
imprisonment for a period of three years and
fine of Rs:20,000/- and in default of payment
of fine to simple imprisonment for six months.

The execution of death sentences awarded to
the convict/appellants were made subject to

confirmation of this Court; and in this regard, a
murder reference (No.14/2016) was also sent
to this Court.
2. The case under sections
302/324/148/149 PPC vide FIR No.633 dated
15.04.2012 was initiated on the report of Falak
Sher, complainant, lodged in Police Station
Kalu Khan, Swabi, where he had brought the
dead bodies of his father Manaris Khan and
cousin Qaiser in a Datsun Pickup; and
reported about the occurrence which took
_ Place at 1800 hours on 15.04.2012 when the
omplainant along with both the deceased, his
ncle Ajmal and another cousin namely Naser
were returning from Jirga held in the Hujra of
Mian Said and were reportedly fired at by the
appellants and the absconding co-accused,
Gul Zamin, with their deadly weapons,
resulting in the death of Manaris and Qaiser;
while the complainant and the other PWs
mentioned in the FIR escaping unhurt. The
motive for the offence was mentioned as their
joint enmity with Wajid etc, with whom the

complainant party was going to enter into
compromise to the annoyance _ of
appellants/accused mentioned in the FIR.

3. After registration of the case,
investigation was conducted by the local
police, and on completion of investigation,
complete challan against the appellants was
submitted; and,at the same time,challan under
section 512 Cr.P.C was also submitted
against the absconding co-accused, Gul
Zamin; leading to commencement of trial, and
after compliance with the mandatory
rovisic = of section 265-(C) Cr.P.C, to
raming of formal charge against the
appellants/accused facing trial under section
148 PPC, section 302 PPC read with section
149 PPC and section 324 PPC read with
section 149 PPC, to which _ the
appellants/accused facing trial pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial; whereafter as many as
twelve PWs were examined by the
prosecution. After prosecution closed its
evidence, statements of the

appellants/accused facing trial were recorded
under section 342 Cr.P.C; wherein, they,
though, denied allegations of the prosecution
against them, but declined to be either
examined on oath or produce defence
evidence; and after hearing learned SPP for
the State, assisted by learned counsel for the
complainant, and learned defence counsel,
the learned trial Court/Additional Sessions
Judge-|, Swabi, recorded a detailed judgment,
whereby, the appellants/accused were
convicted and awarded the sentences
, mentioned hereinabove; hence the instant
ppeal.

4. After learned counsel for the
convict/appellants had argued the appeal at
greater length, the learned AAG pointed out
that the learned trial Court/Additional Sessions
Judge-!, Swabi, had not recorded any findings
either of conviction or of acquittal in respect of
charge against the appellants under section
148 PPC, which was legal infirmity making the
impugned judgment dated 04.08.2016 liable to

be set aside.
5. Although, learned counsel for the
appellants, having thoroughly argued the
case, initially resisted the objection on the
ground that the appellants had already
endured the agony of protracted _ trial,
therefore, remand/sending back the case to
the trial Court would serve no other purpose
but to add to the predicament of the
appellants who are behind the bars since
long; yet there was consensus that the
* impugned judgment dated 04.08.2016 failed
O meet the mandatory requirements of
section 367 Cr.P.C owing to omission on the
part of the learned trial Court/Additional
Sessions Judge-!, Swabi, to record findings on
the charge under section 148 PPC.

6. Needless to say that all the
appellants/accused were distinctly and
separately charged under section 148 PPC for
‘rioting’ while armed with deadly weapons,
carrying the penalty of imprisonment upto
three years or with fine or with both; but,

contrary to the express mandatory provision of
section 367 Cr.P.C, the learned trial Court
failed to even advert to this charge, what to
speak of recording either acquittal or
conviction. of the appellants under section
148 PPC, thus creating scope for
remand/sending back of the case for rewriting
the judgment after hearing learned counsel for
both the parties.

7. Consequently, the appeal is partially
accepted, and the impugned judgment dated
04.08.2016, as well as conviction and
entences awarded to the appellants, are set
aside; and the case is remanded/sent back to
the learned Sessions Judge, Swabi, with
consent of learned counsel for the parties and
learned AAG, for decision afresh/rewriting of
the judgment after providing opportunity of
hearing to both the parties. The murder
reference No.14/2016 is answered in the
negative; and the office is directed to send
record of the case along with a copy of this
judgment/order, forthwith, to the Court of

learned Sessions Judge, Swabi, for the
needful as early as possible in order to
mitigate sufferings of both the parties.

8. Before parting with the judgment/order,
we are constrained to observe that not only
the parties endured the rigours of trial but the
Court also had to take the pain of conducting
trial and recording a detailed judgment, which
has been nullified owing to a legal infirmity in
the judgment; certainly, avoidable with little
more care and pain on the part of the learned
trial Court. We, therefore, deem it appropriate
to guide the learned trial Courts to exercise
extra care and caution and take cognizance of
all relevant facts and legal provisions
applicable to the case while deciding a case,

especially involving capital punishment.
