REESE
JUDGMENT

REKKKEK

IJAZ ANWAR, J. Through instant bail application,
accused petitioner Zia-ur-Rehman son of Latif Khan seeks his
release on bail in case FIR No. 33 dated 11.02.2023 under
section 11-C KPCNSA, 2019 registered at Police Station
Landi Kotal, District Khyber.

2. In the instant case, accused petitioner is charged
for recovery of 06 packets ICE, each weighing 500/- grams
total 3000 gram lying in vehicle “Fielder” bearing registration
No. SR 55 being driven by him.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that in
the instant case, arrest and seizure of the alleged contraband
was effected by an Assistant Sub-Inspector. According to him,
the said official is not authorized officer within the meaning of
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic Substances Act,
2019 (hereinafter to be referred as “the Act’) as defined in

Section 2(e) of “the Act” and as such, the arrest and seizure, so
made, is against the law. He further contended that the
accused, in his statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C, has given
another version of the occurrence, as such, this case has
become one of further inquiry. He placed reliance on the case
titled “Raza and another Vs. The State (PLD 2020 SC
523)” and a recent judgment of the apex Court passed in
Criminal Petition No.885 of 2022 decided on 23.08.2022,
whereby, bail was granted to an accused on the only ground
that in terms of Section 2(c) of “the Act”, only Sub-Inspector
is authorized to search/stop, inspect any vehicle or seize the
narcotics. He also referred to an interim order of the apex
Court granting ad-interim pre-arrest bail in Criminal Petition
No.09-P of 2023 on 20.02.2023.

4. On the other hand, the learned AAG,
representing the State, argued that it is not mandatory that only
officer not below the rank of Sub-Inspector can effect search,
seizure and arrest, without warrant. He relied upon an order of
this Court passed in Cr.M. (BA) No.1540-P/2020 decided on
29.06.2020, wherein, such issue is elaborately dealt with.

5. Arguments heard and record perused.

6. It is pertinent to mention here that this
controversy also remained a contesting issue before the
superior Courts after the promulgation of the Control of
Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 (hereinafter to be referred as

“the Act of 1997”), because, in “the Act of 1997”, an officer,
not below the rank of Sub-Inspector, was authorized to make
search, seizure or arrest etc.

7. This issue has recently been decided by a Single
Bench of this Court in Cr.M. (BA) No.1540-P/2020 decided
on 29.06.2020 through an elaborate judgment. The purpose of
referring to the said judgment is that in the said case, almost
the entire relevant case law of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of
Pakistan was referred and relied upon. Para-6 to 9 of the
judgment dated 29.06.2020, being relevant, are reproduced as
under:-

“6. The Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 (Act
XXV of 1997) (to be referred hereinafter as the Act of
1997), was enacted and promulgated in the year 1997,
and made applicable throughout the Pakistan. The
Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the year 2019,
enacted and promulgated the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Control of Narcotics Substances Act 2019 (Act No.XXXI
of 2019), vide notification dated 4" September, 2019,
extendable to the whole of the Province of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, and under section 59 thereof, the Act of
1997 was repealed but only to the extent of cultivation,
possession, selling, purchasing, delivery and
transportation etc within the Province to the extent of the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. For the sake of convenience and
ready reference section 59 of the Act of 2019, is
reproduced below:-
“59. Repeal and Savings:- (1) The Control of
Narcotics Substances Act, 1997 (Act No.XXV of
1997), to the extent of cultivation, possession,
selling, purchasing delivery and transportation etc
within the Province, to the extent of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa is hereby repealed.”
7. The thread bare reading of section 59 of the Act of
2019 depicts that though the Act of 1997 has been
repealed but only to the extent of cultivation, possession,
selling, purchasing, delivery and transportation etc,
within the province of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
however, it does not speaks specifically about repealing
of rest of the provisions of the Act of 1997.
8. Perusal of both the enactments would reveal that
section 21 of the Act of 1997, is analogous to a great
extent with section 28 of the Act of 2019, as both speak
about the power of entry, search, seizure and arrest of
accused without warrant. For the sake of convenience and
ready reference, section 21 of the Act of 1997 is
reproduced below:-
21. Power of entry, search, seizure and arrest
without warrant. — (1) Where an officer, not
below the rank of Sub-Inspector of Police or

equivalent authorized in this behalf by the
Federal Government or the Provincial

Government, who from his personal knowledge
or from information given to him by any person is
of opinion that any narcotic drug, psychotropic
substance or controlled substance in respect of
which an offence punishable under this Act has
been committed is kept or concealed in any
building, place, premises or conveyance, and a
warrant for arrest or search cannot be obtained
against such, person without affording him an
opportunity for the concealment of evidence or
facility for his escape; such officer may:-

(a) enter into any such building, place,
premises or conveyance;

(b) break open any door and remove any other.
obstacle to such entry in case of resistance;

(c) seize such narcotic drugs, psychotropic
substances and controlled substances and other
materials used in the manufacture thereof and any
other article which he has reason to believe to be
liable to confiscation-n under this Act and any
document or other article which he has reason to
believe may furnish evidence of the commission
of an offence punishable under this Act; and

d) detain, search and, if he thinks proper, arrest

any person whom he has reason to believe to have
committed an offence punishable. under this Act.
(2) Before or immediately after taking any action
under sub-section (1), the officer referred to in
that sub-section shall record the grounds and basis
of his information and proposed action and
forthwith send a copy thereof, to his immediate
superior officer. (Bold and underline supplied
emphasis).
I deem it appropriate to reproduce section 28 of
the Act of 2019, for facility reference and
comparison with section 21 of the Act of 1997,
which read as under:-

28. Power of entry, search, seizure and

arrest without warrant.---(1) Where an

authorized officer, who from his personal
knowledge or from information given to him
by any person, is of the opinion that any
narcotic substance is kept or concealed in
any building, place, premises, dwelling
house or conveyance and warrant for the
search or arrest cannot be obtained from the

Special Court against such person without

affording him an opportunity for the
concealment of evidence or facility for his
escape, such officer may-

(a) enter into any such building, place,
premises, dwelling house subject to the
proviso of sub-section (1) of Section 27 of
this Act;

(b) break open any door and remove any
other obstacle to such entry in case of
resistance;

(c) seize such narcotic substances,
methamphetamine and other materials used
in the manufacturing thereof and any other
article or documents which he has reason to
believe to be liable for confiscation or may
furnish evidence of the 4 commission of an
offence punishable under this Act; and

(d) search and, if he thinks proper, arrest any
person whom he has reason to believe to
have committed an offence punishable under
this Act.

(2) Before or immediately after taking any
action under sub-section (1), the authorized
officer, mentioned in sub-section (1), shall
record the grounds and basis of his
information and take immediate necessary
action and forthwith send a copy of the same
to the Director or as the case may be to the
Regional Police Officer”.

The word “Authorized Officer” has been
defined under section 2(e) of the Act of 2019, which
means:-

(i) An Officer of the Directorate General, not
below the rank of Sub-Inspector,
authorized by the Director; or

(ii) A Police Officer/official not below the
rank of Sub-Inspector, authorized by the
Regional Police Officer.

9. Section 21 of the Act of 1997 (almost ditto copy
of section 28 of the Act of 2019), has remained the
point of discussion before the august Supreme Court
of Pakistan in different cases. Useful reference can be
made to case titled, “Muhammad Younas and
others vs Mst. Perveen alias Mano and _ others”
(2007_SCMR_393), wherein the august Supreme
Court was pleased to hold that arrest of accused in
possession of narcotics by a Police Officer below the
rank of | Sub-Inspector would not vitiate the
prosecution case, rather the competent Court would
proceed to determine the guilt or innocence of the
accused on the basis of evidence, irrespective of the
manner in which he is brought before the court. The
relevant portion of the judgment (supra) is reproduced
below:-

“The other argument of the learned counsel for

the respondent No.1 as to the violation of the
provision of section 21 and 22 of the Act needs
to be dealt with. Ordinarily, only an officer of
the rank of Sub-Inspector or equivalent or
above may exercise the powers of arrest and
seizure of narcotics. But this is not an
absolute rule. There may be cases of extreme
urgency requiring prompt action, where an
accused _is caught with narcotics in_his
possession by a Police Officer _of a lower
rank. Can it be said that such Police Officer
should just let him go with the narcotics? The

answer would certainly be in the emphatic
“No”. The guilt or innocence of an accused

does not depend on the question of competence
or otherwise of a Police Officer to investigate
the offence. A trial of an accused is not vitiated
mere on the ground that the case has been
investigated by an officer who is not authorized
to do so unless a contrary intention appears from
the language of a statute. The competent Court
would proceed to determine the guilt or
innocence of an accused on the basis of the
evidence produced before it irrespective of the

manner in which he is brought before it. A

somewhat similar view was taken in the cases of

“Mr. Abdul Latif Vs GM Paracha and others”

(1981 SCMR 1101), “State through Advocate

General Sindh Vs Bashir and others” (PLD

1997 SC 408), “The Crown vs Mehar Ali” (PLD

1956 FC 106), “ MS.K Ibrat Vs_ the

Commander in chief, Royal Pakistan Navy and

others” (PLD 1956 SC 264), “Ahmad Khan Vs

Rasul Shah and others” (PLD 1975 SC 66 at

page 81, 88and 151-152), “Muhammad and

others Vs the State” (1984 SCMR 954) and “the

State vs Sohail Ahmed and 04 others” (PLD

1990 FSC 29). We may however observe that in

a proper case, a Police Officer, if guilty of

deliberate usurpation of power and violation of

a statute may render himself liable to

disciplinary or penal action or both in

accordance with law. The purpose of enacting
protective provisions of sections 21 and 22 of
the Act seems to be that normally the cases of
narcotics being of serious nature should be
handled by more responsible Police Officer.

(emphasis supplied).

In case titled, “The State vs Abdali Shah”, (2009
SCMR_291), it has been held by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court that:-

“Even the provisions of sections 20 to 22 of

CNSA__ being directory, _ non-compliance

thereof would not be a ground for holding

the trial/conviction bad in the eyes of law. On

this ground the conviction of the appellant
cannot be set aside. Reference in this behalf
can be made to the case of Fida Jan v the State

2001 SCMR 36; State through AG Sindh v

Hemjoo 2003 SCMR 881, Karl Johan Joseph v

the State PLD 2004 SC 394 and Muhammad

Younas v Mst. Perveen alias Mano and others

2007 SCMR 393, wherein it is observed that

where provisions of CNSA are directory in

nature, non-compliance of the same is not fatal”.

(emphasis supplied).

Similarly, while dilating upon the provision of
section 21 of the Act of 1997, the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in case titled, “The State Vs Abdali Shah”
(2009. SCMR_ 291), made the following
observations:-

“Tt would be seen that a huge quantity of 52

Kgs of chars was allegedly recovered from the

Taxi beside which the respondent was standing

while closing its dickey. It is not possible that

the police would foist such a huge quantity of
charas upon him, It appears that the learned

High Court has relied heavily upon the

technical aspect of the seizure _and_arrest

which in our opinion are misconceived as in
the fist place no raid was carried out by the
police personnel but the respondent
apprehended during normal patrol duty. As
such the provisions of section 21 are not
applicable. Even otherwise, it cannot be
expected that upon apprehension of the
accused the police party would go in search
of the officer who is entitled to arrest the
accused being an ASI. At the most, this was
an_irregularity which was curable under
section 537 Cr.P.C. as held by this Court in

case of Muhammad Hanif (supra). (emphasis
supplied)”.

8. Recently too, a two members Bench of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case titled “Syed
Zulfigar Shah Vs. The State through Advocate General,
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Peshawar (2022 SCMR 1450)/(C.P.
No.518 of 2022 decided _on 07.06.2022)”, while considering

the effect of Section 27 of “the Act”, held that “the relevant
provisions are not mandatory in nature so as to vitiate the

whole proceedings” and thus, declined the relief of bail.
9. In the case titled “Fida Jan Vs. The State
(2001 SCMR 36)”, a three members bench of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan held that “the provisions of Section
20 of the CNSA of 1997 are directory in nature, and
conducting the raid, without obtaining a search warrant, would
not in itself suffice to vitiate the trial. The apex Court further
held:-

“6. We have considered the implication of
section 20 of the Act. It appears that the law
givers have coached this section of law in such
manner that it does not place a mandatory
obligation upon the Investigating Agency to
obtain search warrants from the Special Judge
before conducting a raid....[From the language
employed in a statute it can be gathered
whether it is mandatory or directory in its
nature. We have noticed that in section 20 of
the Act word "may" has been used with
reference to obtaining search warrants by the
agency who intended to effect search of a
house, place, premises or conveyance etc. It is
also known principle of interpretation of statute
that word "may" sometimes can be used as
"shall". But perusal of section 20 of the Act
suggests that law has not _ prescribed
consequences of conducted search without
obtaining the warrants from Special Court.
Thus, we are of the opinion that it is directory
in nature, therefore, depending upon facts and
circumstances of each case if the Investigating
Agency has not obtained search warrants from
Special Judge before conducting raid in a
house for the recovery of narcotics, this reason
alone would not be sufficient, to vitiate the
trial”.

Similarly, a three-member Bench of the apex Court in the

case titled “The State Vs. Hemjoo (2003 SCMR 881)” held

that non-compliance of the provisions of Section 20 of the

CNSA of 1997 cannot be a norm, rather it may be condoned,
only in some exceptional circumstances, justifying such non-
adherence. The apex Court held:-

“The combined study of sections 20 and 21 of the
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 would show
that only in exceptional cases in which the search
warrant cannot possibly be obtained before conducting
the raid, an officer authorized in this behalf can proceed
for conduct of raid without the warrant but this power
cannot be allowed to be used in every case in the normal
circumstances”.

A similar view was also expressed in the case titled
“Arshad Mahmood Ys. The State (PLD 2008 SC 376)”.

Similarly, a larger bench of the Hon’ble Supreme
Court of Pakistan in the case titled “Zafar Vs. The State
(2008 SCMR 1254)” approvingly referred to the cases of Fida
Jan and Muhammad Younas for making the observations that
the provisions of Sections 20 to 22 of the CNSA of 1997 are
directory, and that neither can the non-compliance of the said
provisions be a ground for holding the trial or the conviction
awarded to an accused bad in the eyes of law nor can the
conviction be set aside on this ground. The provisions of
section 20 & 22 of the CNSA, 1997 are pari materia to section
27 & 29 of the CNSA, 2019 regarding which the apex Court
has already held it as directory and not mandatory.
10. In all the above referred judgments, I find that
the determination pertaining to the above relevant provisions
of law has already been made by the Larger Benches of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan and have decided this

issue conclusively. This Court, in view of the reported cases
10

titled “Qaiser_and another Vs. The State (2022 SCMR
1641), Hasnain Raza and another Vs. Lahore High Court,
Lahore and others (PLD 2022 SC 07) and Messrs Cherat
Cement Co. Ltd. Nowshera and others Vs. Federation of
Pakistan and others (PLD 2021 SC 327)”, is thus bound by
the judgments of the Larger Benches of the apex Court.

11. I am, thus, clear in my mind that power to entry,
search, seizure and arrest without warrant by an officer below
the rank of Sub-Inspector if made would not vitiate the case
nor it can be made a ground for the grant of bail.

12. Now coming to the merits of the case. Perusal
of record would show that the accused petitioner has been
arrested red handed and recovery of huge quantity of ICE has
been effected from the vehicle being driven by him who, at the
relevant time was present all alone in the vehicle. Thus he
cannot dispute his conscious knowledge regarding
concealment/presence of the narcotic substance in the vehicle.
Copy of the relevant page of register No. 19 is available on
record verifying safe custody of the case property/samples. In
order to confirm the nature/type of psychotropic substance,
samples were separated from all the packets and sent to the
FSL for chemical analysis. The FSL has furnished its positive
report confirming the samples to be “Methamphetamine”. No
malafide, ill will or grudge has been shown against the police

for falsely involving the petitioner in the instant case nor is it
*Muhammadullah*

11

possible for the police to plant such a huge quantity of ICE
which is, by far the most expensive drug.

13. Thus the data available on record prima facie
connects the accused petitioner with the commission of the
offence punishment whereof falls within the prohibitory clause
of section 497 Cr.P.C disentitling him to the concession of

bail. Resultantly, this bail application is dismissed.
