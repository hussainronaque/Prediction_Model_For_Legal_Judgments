M.A.
No. 6146 of 2013 is allowed. 
Learned
counsel representing the applicant Afzal @ Meer, who is booked in Crime No. 19
of 2013 P.S. Keenjhar Lake registered under section 324,337A9ii), 147, 148,
149, 114 & 504 PPC, submits that the applicant has falsely been implicated
in this case. It is contended by learned counsel for the applicant that
co-accused Irfan son of Ali Asghar has already been granted interim pre-arrest
bail by this court in Cr.Bail Application No. 939 of 2013. It is next contended
that the offence does not fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497
Cr.P.C. except section 324 which is not applicable in the facts and
circumstances of the present case and same has been applied by the police at
the instance of complainant party. Learned counsel further submitted that the
applicant intends to surrender before the trial court but having apprehension
of his arrest, humiliation and disgrace by the police, approached this court
for interim relief of bail. 
 
Without
adverting to the merits/demerits of the case, the applicant is admitted to interim
pre-arrest bail on his furnishing solvent surety in the sum of Rs. 100,000/-
(Rupees one lac only) and P. R. Bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of
the Nazir of this court. 
 
To
come up on 20.9.2013, on which date the matter is already fixed, for
confirmation or otherwise. Notice be also issued to complainant and Prosecutor
General, Sindh for the said date.
