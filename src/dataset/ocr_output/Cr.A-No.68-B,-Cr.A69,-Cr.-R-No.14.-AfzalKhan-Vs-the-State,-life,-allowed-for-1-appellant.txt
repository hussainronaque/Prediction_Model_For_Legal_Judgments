ABDUL SHAKOOR, J.- This Criminal Appeal

No.68-B/2015, has been filed by  convicts/

appellants, the connected Criminal Appeal No.69-

B/2015 filed by complainant Qadir Khan against

acquittal of accused under section 324 PPC, and

Criminal Revision No.14 -B/2015 for enhancement

of sentence of appellants. All the three appeals and

revision petition arise from the impugned judgment

dated 06.05.2015 of learned Additional Sessions
-2-

Judge-I], Lakki Marwat, whereby the accused/

appellants involved in case FIR No. 631 dated

28.11.2013 under sections 302/324/34 PPC, Police

Station Naurang, District Lakki Marwat, were

convicted under sections 302 (b) PPC and sentenced

to imprisonment for life alongwith compensation

Rs.200000/- under Section 544-A Cr.PC or in default

whereof to further undergo six months SI, however,

benefit of section 382-B Cr.PC extended to the

accused/ appellants.

2. Since both appeals and criminal revision

are the outcome of one and the same occurrence/

F.I.R as well as impugned judgment, therefore, these

are being disposed of by way of this single judgment.

3. The story of prosecution as narrated in

the FIR, mentioned above, is that on 28.11.2013 at

1255 hours, the complainant Qadir Khan alongwith

deadbody of his son Adnan reported the matter to the

local police in the Emergency Room of Civil
-3-

Hospital, Naurang, to the effect that some 4 months

prior to the instant occurrence, a scuffle had taken

place amongst sons of Afzal Khan and Adnan son of

the complainant. At 12.55 hours, the complainant

alongwith his son Adnan Khan were on the way from

Naurang towards their village in Qing Qi Rikshaw,

when they reached near the village road they

deboarded from Qing Qi rikshaw and started towards

their village. Adnan was ahead,while complainant

was at some paces behind. In the meanwhile accused

Afzal Khan duly armed with Kalashnikov alongwith

his son Alamgir, Armed with Kalashnikov and

Zeeshan armed with double barrel 12 bore rifle,

already standing there. They shouted upon them to

stop and all of them started firing upon them

simultaneously with the intention to commit their

Qatl-e-Amd as a result of which son of the

complainant Adnan was hit and fall to the ground,

while the complainant luckily escaped unhurt.

Accused decamped from the spot after the
-4-

occurrence. During shifting of injured Adnan to the

hospital, he succumbed on the way.

4. Najeebullah THC (PW-2) reduced the

report of the complainant, in shape of murasila

(Ex:PA). It was read over and explained to the

complainant, who after admitting it to be correct

thumb impressed the same in token of its correctness,

whereafter, he prepared the injury sheet Ex:PW 2/1

and inquests report Ex:PW 2/2 of the deceased

Adnan and referred for Post mortem under the escort

of Abdul Qayum FC No.456 (PW-1), while sent the

Murasila to the Police Station through Constable

Zakir Khan No. 6501, where on the basis of which

F.I.R as Ex: PA/1 was registered against the accused

under sections 302/324/34 PPC.

5. Investigation started in the case and on

its completion, challan was submitted to the Court of

learned Additional Sessions Judge-II, Lakki Marwat.

Learned trial Court delivered the copies of relevant
-5-

documents to accused in compliance with provision

of section 265-C Cr.PC and charge was framed

against them, to which they did not plead guilty and

claimed trial. In order to prove the charge against the

accused, the prosecution produced and examined as

many as eleven (09) PWs. On conclusion of

prosecution evidence, statements of accused were

recorded, wherein all the accused professed their

innocence, however, neither they wished to be

examined on oath as provided under section 340(2)

Cr.PC nor opted to produce defence evidence. After

hearing arguments of learned counsel for the parties,

the learned trial court vide impugned judgment dated

06.05.2015 convicted the accused/ appellants under

section 302(b) PPC, while acquitted under section

324/34 PPC. The appellants filed this Cr.A No.68-B

of 2015, challenging their conviction, while the

complainant Qadir Khan filed Cr. Revision against

enhancement of sentence under section 302 (b) PPC,

and Cr. Appeal against acquittal of accused/
-6-

appellants under section 324/34 PPC. Hence, all the

three appeals and revision petition are going to be

decided through this common judgment.

6. Learned counsel for appellants argued

that the instant case hinges upon the statement of

sole eye-witness, who is father of the deceased,

hence, being interested witness his testimony cannot

be relied upon. He next argued that there is no

circumstantial evidence, which may support or

corroborate the statement of sole eye-witness. He

went on to say that complainant failed to establish

his presence on the spot, while matter is also reported

to the Police with inordinate and unexplained delay.

His next argument was that ocular account

contradicts the medical evidence and site plan. He

lastly argued that learned trial Court has given

weight to the absconsion and recoveries, which are

also not proved under the legal parameters. He

concluded his arguments by saying that prosecution

has miserably failed to establish his case against the
-7-

accused/ appellants, hence, the impugned judgment

requires reversal.

7. On the other hand learned A.A.G

representing the State assisted by learned counsel for

the complainant, vehemently rebutted the arguments

advanced by learned counsel for the accused/

appellants and contended that the accused/

appellants are charged directly by name for

committing brutal murder of son of the complainant

before his eyes. They next argued that the accused/

appellants have not successfully achieved his target

rather also attempted at the life of complainant. They

pressed their vehemence on the argument that the

prosecution has fully established presence of sole eye

witness of the occurrence beyond any doubt and his

testimony is fully corroborated by medical evidence

and site plan, which is gone unshaken in their

lengthy cross-examination. They supported their

previous argument by saying that the recoveries of

crime empties from the place of accused remained
-8-

unshaken and positive FSL report in this respect

coupled with other circumstantial evidence are in

line with the prosecution version as put forth by the

complainant. Their contention was that unexplained

abscondance of accused/ appellant for sufficient time

is a step forward towards their guilt. They lastly

argued that the learned trial court has committed

error by not convicting the accused under section

324/34 PPC, as once the case has been proved

against the accused/ appellants, then they should

have been punished for the offence under section

324/34 PPC. They requested that on acceptance of

criminal appeal No.69-B/2015 and Cr. R No.14-

B/2015, the convict/appellants may have been given

condign punishment by enhancing the sentence and

convicting under section 324/34 PPC.

8. We have heard arguments of learned

counsel for the appellant, learned A.A.G representing

the State and learned counsel for the complainant and
-9-

gone through the record with their valuable

assistance.

9. Perusal of the record reveals that, as per

contents of FIR accused/ appellants Afzal Khan and

Alamgeer Khan have been attributed the role of

firing at the deceased as well as ineffective firing at

the complainant with their Kalashnikov, while the

accused/ appellant Zeeshan Khan has been attributed

the role of firing with 12 bore rifle.

10. The occurrence has been witnessed by

Qadir Khan, father of the deceased, who just after the

occurrence took the then injured to the hospital and

within 25 minutes of the occurrence in emergency

room of Civil Hospital, Naurang reported the matter

to the local police. The time consumed in lodging the

report, cannot be termed as delay, hence, it cannot be

said that the matter was reported after consultation

and deliberation.
-10-

11. The complainant alleged in his first

information report (Ex:PA/1) that his son, the then

injured during shifting to hospital succumbed to the

injuries. The Doctor, who conducted Post mortem of

the deceased opined in his report (Ex:PW 5/1), time

between injury and death as 10 to 20 hours, which

also support version of the complainant.

12. First information report is a most

important document in a criminal case which

furnishes the clue of the possible truth of the

allegation against the accused and also causes a firm

impression of the prosecution case. It is a statement

which is made soon after the occurrence, when the

memory of the informant is fresh, who shows

himself to be present on the scene. In the instant

case, the complainant Qadir Khan, father of the

deceased is the only eye witness of the occurrence,

therefore, the witness can legitimately be termed as

interested witness and statement of this witness is to

be looked into with great care and caution.
-ll-

Undoubtedly the statement of interested witness

which even for that matter inimical witness can be

taken into consideration but the rule of appraisal is

that the same is supported by some _ strong

corroboration from some independent source. In

order to believe a witness, first the prosecution has to

satisfy the Court regarding presence of the witness at

the spot and secondly whether he is credible truthful

witness and thereafter conviction can be based on

testimony of inimical witness, if same is

corroborated by some strong corroborative piece of

evidence.

13. In the instant case, son of the

complainant has been done to death before the eyes

of his father, who is no doubt interested witness, but

substitution in such like cases is rare phenomena. It

is not attractive to a reasonable mind that how a

father of deceased would get free the real culprit and

charge an innocent person without showing any false

motive.
-12-

14. Appearing as PW-8, Qadir Khan

complainant of the case has stated in support of his

stance as narrated in his initial report Ex.PA/1. He

was subjected to lengthy and taxing cross-

examination by the learned counsel for the

convict/appellants but nothing could be extracted

from his mouth which could diminish the probative

worth of his testimony. Moreover, the statement of

the witness on account of being interested witness

can only be discarded if it is proved that an interested

witness has ulterior motive on account of enmity or

any other consideration. In absence of any reason

leading to show that for some ulterior motive or an

enmity, the statement can be relied upon. In this

regard, reference can be made to the case of

Muhammad Ehsan..Vs..State (2006 SCMR 1857)

wherein while considering the plea raised by accused

that evidence of widow of deceased could not be

relied upon because she was interested witness being

related to deceased, it was held that she was widow
-13-

of deceased would not by itself sufficient to held that

she was interested witness as she had no enmity with

the accused and even if deceased had enmity with

accused it would not have any serious affect upon the

credibility and reliability of the testimony of widow.

15. Admittedly and as urged by counsel for

the appellants, abscondence of an accused can never

remedy the defect in the prosecution case, that

abscondence of accused by itself has no value in the

absence of any other evidence, that abscondance can

be used as corroborative piece of evidence which

cannot be read in isolation but has to be read

alongwith substantive piece of evidence. Reliance is

placed by learned counsel for the appellant on the

case law titled Rohtas Khan..Vs..The State (2010

SCMR 566).

16. There is no two opinion about the

proposition that abscondance of the accused by itself

is not sufficient to prove his guilt but can be taken as
-14-

a corroborative piece of evidence. In the cases of

Muhammad Arshad..Vs..Qasim Ali (1992 SCMR

814), Pir Badshah..Vs..The State (1985 SCMR

2070) and Amir Gul..Vs..The State (1981 SCMR

182), it was observed by their Lordships that

conviction on abscondance alone cannot be

sustained but so far as the case under consideration

is concerned, here the position is altogether different

as the version of prosecution is duly corroborated by

medical evidence, recoveries affected from the place

of convict/appellant, motive behind the occurrence

and other attending circumstances of the case and

all these facts, when taken together, lends support

from the ocular account of PW Qadir Khan. Rel:

Mst. Roohaida..Vs..Khan Bahadur _and_ another

1992 SCMR _ 1036 aiser__Khan _ and

others..Vs.. The State and others (2009 SCMR 471

and Mir Afzal Khan..Vs..The State (2011 SCMR

171).
-15-

17. According to post mortem report, the

deceased received firearm injuries, while one goes

through the size of injuries, which are %" and 1/3", it

pricks the conscious of the Court that these injuries

can only be caused through the fireshots of

Kalashnikovs. Accused/ appellants Afzal Khan and

Alamgir have been given the role of firing with

Kalashnikovs, while accused/ appellant Zeeshan has

been given the role of firing with 12 bore rifle,

hence, it is obvious that the deceased has not been

done to death by the fire shot of accused/ appellant

Zeeshan, nor the complainant received any firearm

injury, hence, a serious doubt creates in the case of

prosecution to the extent of participation of accused/

appellant Zeeshan in the alleged offence, hence,

under the safe administration of justice, the case of

accused/ appellant Zeeshan is on different footing. It

is cardinal principle of criminal administration of

justice, that if a single reasonable doubt in the

prosecution case is created, the accused should have
-16-

been extended its benefit, therefore, in the instant

case benefit of reasonable doubt is extended to the

accused/ appellant Zeeshan.

18. Once the case has been proved against

the accused/ appellants for commission of murder of

deceased on the basis of statement of complainant,

father of the deceased, then its allied offence,

attempting at the life of complainant is also proved,

but learned trial court erred in law by acquitted the

accused/ appellants from the charge under section

324 P.P.C, hence the accused/appellants Afzal Khan

and Alamgeer also deserve to be convicted and

sentence under section 324 PPC.

19. As a corollary to what is discussed

above, we partially accept this Cr. A No.68-B of

2015 filed by accused/ appellants by acquitting the

accused/ appellant Zeeshan from the charges. He be

set at liberty forthwith if not required in any other

case. Cr. ANo. 69-B/2015 is partially allowed to the
-17-

extent of accused/ respondents Afzal Khan and

Alamgeer Khan, they are convicted under section

324/34 P.P.C, and sentenced to ten years RI each

with fine Rs.100000/- each or in default whereof to

further undergo to six month SI. Benefit of section

382-B Cr.PC extended to them. The sentences under

section 302(b) P.P.C and 324 P.P.C, shall run

concurrently. Resultantly, Cr. Rev. No.14-B of 2015,

stands dismissed.

Announced.
