asked for the following relief that; -

“On acceptance of this writ petition,

2. The laconic relevant facts of the case are that
petitioner was serving as Secretary Housing,

Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since 22.02.2012.

A.&.AWAN
On 02.05.2013 he was transferred and posted as
Member (General) Provincial Inspection Team (BPS-20)
and lastly posted as Officer on Special Duty (0.S.D) in
the Provincial Government Establishment Department.
That Chairman NAB vide letter No. NAB’s U.O.P. File
No. 3-2(2)/ Inq-21/ KP-II/ IM-II/ NAB/ 2013 dated
03.10.2014 authorized the Director General NAB
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to conducted inquiry against the
Zaki Ullah petitioner within the meaning of section
18(c) NAO 1999 into a case pertaining to acquisition of
land in Moza Darwaza, Nathiagali by the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa House Authority. Thus the petitioner was
booked as one of the co-accused and was arrested on
23.05.2014 as per allegation that he being Secretary
Housing, in connivance with other accused persons
caused colossal loss to Government Exchequer in
acquisition of land in Moza Darwaza Nathiagali over
Rs. 400 Million and have received an amount of Rs. 02
Cror 10 lac, as illegal gratification from accused
Muhammad Asif/Navid Qadir and caused loss to
Government Exchequer, thus was arrested on

in due course of process was allowed and petitioner
was admitted to bail subject to furnishing of Bail

00085165-03 and A/C No. 0898-79272874-03 so
maintained by the petitioner and stopped further

7. In nutshell the above quoted letter is a freezing
order whereby the proceeds of bank account owned by
the petitioner has been blocked under the garb of
section-23 of the NAO, 1999 and as such it would be

imperative to read sections 12 & 23 of the NAO, 1999,

which reads as under:-

Section-12.

Section-23.

“The Chairman NAB or the Court
trying an accused for an offence
as specified under this Ordinance,
may, at any time, if there appear
reasonable grounds for believing
that the accused has committed
such an_ offence, order the
freezing of his property, or part
thereof, whether in his possession
or in the possession of any
relative, associate or person on
his behalf.”

(a) Notwithstanding anything
contained in any other law for the
time being in force after the
Chairman NAB has initiated an
inquiry or investigation into any
offence under this Ordinance,
alleged to have been committed
by an accused person, such
accused person or any relative or
associate of such accused person
or any other person on his behalf,
shall not transfer by any means
whatsoever or, create a charge on
any property owned by him or in
his possession, while the inquiry,
investigation or proceedings are
pending before the NAB or the
Court; and any transfer of any
right, title or interest or creation
of a charge on such property shall
be void.

(b) Any person who transfer, or
creates a charge on property in
contravention of sub-section (a)
shall be punishable with rigorous
imprisonment for a term, which
may extend to three years and
shall also be liable to fine not
exceeding the value of the
property involved.

Provided that such transfer of any
right, title or interest or creation
of a charge on such property shall
not be void if made with the
approval of the Court, subject to
such terms and conditions as the
Court may deem fir.

8. The plain reading of above quoted section would
show that it’s only the chairman NAB who can order
for freezing. If at all, we go to section 34(A) of the
NAB Ordinance, 1999 which talks of delegation of
powers in this respect the Chairman NAB may, by an
order in writing, delegate any of his powers to and
authorize performance of any offence function by, an
officer of the NAB as he may deem fit and proper,
subject to such conditions, if any, as may be specified
in the order, for carrying out the purposes of this
Ordinance.” There is nothing on record showing that
the two officials, who have signed the impugned letter
dated 10.6.2014 were authorized in this respect by an
order in writing under section 34(A) of the NAO, 1999.
In the case of The State through prosecutor General
Accountability, NAB, Islamabad versus Babar Ali
Kharal, reported in PLD-2008, Lahore-347, it has been

held as under:-

----Ss, 12 & 32---Freezing of
property---Procedure---Principles--
-Appeal to High Court against the
judgment passed by Accountability
Court vide which application for
return of vehicles and jewellery
etc had been accepted---
Maintainability---Provisions of S.12,
National Accountability Ordinance,
1999 dealing with freezing of
property, were self sufficient and
exhaustive provisions of law which
had conferred powers on NAB
Authorities for the purpose of
freezing / seizing, attachment etc.
of property of accused or any party
thereof, whether in his possession;
or possession of his relative,
associate or person on his behalf---
Said provision however had placed
certain obligations on the
Authorities to mandatory that if
any property was frozen/seized by
the NAB Authorities, the order had
to be passed by the Chairman NAB
for freezing / seizure of the same,
which was non-existent in the
present case---Even if an order of
seizure/frozen, attachment = or
prohibition was passed by the
Chairman NAB, that would remain
enforced for a_ period not
exceeding 15 days unless
confirmed by the Court where the
reference against accused was
sent, but in the present case, there
was no confirmation by the court
concerned regarding the said claim
/ seizure by the NAB Authorities---
Retaining property of respondent
was in absolute violation of proviso
to S. 12(iv) of National
Accountability Ordinance, 1999 as
it could not be left at the
discretion of NAB Authorities that
they could choose according to
their wishes any provision of law
and apply same for their own
benefit or to justify their illegal
actions to deprive an individual of
his property---Even otherwise the
Legislature in its wisdom had
prohibited right of appeal against
an interlocutory order and
impugned order was not final in
nature as reference was still
pending with NAB; appeal by NAB,
was dismissed being incompetent
in circumstances.
9. Since, under section 12 of the NAB Ordinance,
which provides for freezing of property, the Chairman
National Accountability Bureau alone or the Court
trying an accused, are conferred upon jurisdiction and
competence by law to issue a freezing order and there
is nothing on record regarding delegation of power on
the relevant day of the impugned order, the impugned
order seems to be illegal, unlawful and void.

10. In view of above, this writ petition is allowed as

prayed for.
