\, Tajamul (S.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
\ (Cr ANo. 124-M of 2017 12.09.2019 acquittal appeals atfowed 279 accident)
emanate from one and the same judgment
dated 17.04.2017 rendered by the learned
Sessions Judge/ Zilla Qazi Malakand (Camp
Court at Dargai) in case F..R No. 60 dated
08.04.2014 registered under sections 279, 320,
337-G, 427 PPC at Levy Post Sakhakot
District Malakand, whereby the accused/
respondent Saram son of Bacha was acquitted
of the charges.

2. As per prosecution story, on
08.04.2014 Fazal Akbar, IHC PS Sakhakot
(PW-10), had received information that an
accident took place at Muskan Fashion Hotel
near Sakhakot Toor Pull (Bridge). When the
said IHC along with other levy officials

reached at the spot where they found the

_wreckage of three motorcars and two

motorcycles. On query, they were informed
that on 08.04.2014 a motorcar bearing
No. MQ-796, black colour driven by Saram
(accused/respondent) coming from Shergarh
heading towards Dargai when at about 19:45

hours reached at the place of occurrence, due

to rash and negligent driving hit two
motorcycles owned by Irshad son of Ghulam
Muhammad and Yousaf Khan (deceased) son
of Dildar along with two other motorcars
parked in the parking area of the said hotel.
Due to the said accident, Muhammad Yousaf
and Ghausor Rehman received serious
injuries. Later, Muhammad  Yousaf
succumbed to the injuries in the hospital.
Thus, Murasila, Ex. PA/1 was drafted, on the
basis of which FIR ibid Ex. PA was registered
against the accused/respondent at PS
concerned.

3. Upon arrest of the
accused/respondent and subsequently on
completion of the investigation, complete
challan was submitted against him before the
Court of learned Sessions Judge Malakand,
where at the commencement of the trial, the
prosecution has examined as many as ten (10)
witnesses whose statements were recorded and
placed on file. On closure of the prosecution

evidence, accused was examined under. section

(“Cr.PC”), He denied the charges, claimed
innocence and stated to have falsely been
implicated in the case.

4, On conclusion of the trial, the
learned trial_-~— Court acquitted the
accused/respondent Saram vide the judgment
impugned herein. Hence, these connected
matters.

5. Arguments heard and record of
the case was perused with the able assistance
of learned counsels for the parties including
learned Astt: Advocate General appearing on
behalf of the State.

6. Prosecution has examined ten

recovery memo Ex.PW-3/2 whereby the I.O
took into possession the damaged Hunda

also the marginal witness of recovery memos

Yousaf had come to the hotel at Toor Pul for
eating fish; they were standing in the parking
of the hotel when at 07:45 evening time
black colour motorcar XLI No. QM-796,
being driven by accused Saram, hit them
with his car due to which they sustained
serious injuries. This witness further deposed
that the accused also caused damage to
motorcycles and motorcars by striking the
same with his car due to rash and negligent
driving. He charged the accused for causing
him injuries.

Nowsherwan (PW-5) was
attracted to the spot on hearing the collision
and reached there after 5/6 minutes of the
occurrence. He deposed that he had seen the
accused on the day of occurrence and his car
was damaged due to rash driving of the
accused. He charged the accused for causing
damage to his car.

Muhammad Zahoor appeared as

PW-6. He stated that he was busy in eating

fish in the hotel near Toor Pul when the
occurrence took place resulting into injuries
to two persons and causing damage to his car
as well another car parked in the hotel. He,
however, did not charge the accused for the
reason that he had effected compromise with
him regarding the damage to his car in the
accident. |

PW-7 is Muhammad Irshad, a
co-villager of the accused. On his arrival to
the spot after the accident, he saw Yousaf
laying on the ground while accused Saram
and another person were standing near the
car.

Hazrat Yousaf (PW-8) is not eye
witness of the occurrence, however, he
charged the accused for causing death of his
brother Yousaf Khan through rash driving.

Amir Zaman Khan _ Naib
Subedar (PW-09) conducted investigation in

the case.

prepared the injury sheets of the injured
persons and made addition of section 320
P.P.C in the case vide memo Ex.PW-10/3

7. The learned trial Court has
acquitted the accused respondent on the
ground that nobody has witnessed him while
driving the vehicle, however, I do not find
myself in consonance with such findings of
the learned trial Court keeping in view the
evidence available on record. I am conscious
of the fact that when an accused is acquitted
by competent Court of law then there is
double presumption of innocence in his
favour. However, this rule cannot be applied

where the findings of the trial Court are

perverse, ridiculous and are not based on
proper appreciation of evidence. In this
regard wisdom can be derived from the
judgments Ghulam Sikandar and another
V/s. Mamaraz Khan and others (PLD 1985
SC 11), Khadim Hussain V/s. Manzoor
Hussain Shah and 3 others (2002 SCMR
261) and Munawar Shah V/s. Liaquat
Hussain and others (2002 SCMR 713).

8. In the present case, the
occurrence has taken place in the parking of
a hotel and the crime scene narrated in the
site plan clearly exhibits the high speed of
the vehicle. According to the site plan
(Ex.PB), the vehicle which was being driven
by the accused/respondent had hit a VXR
car, a GLI car, two motorcycles and also
thereby caused serious injuries to two
persons present on the spot. True that the site
plan is not a substantive piece of evidence
but the panoramic view of the crime scene

based on the observations of the

the purpose of appreciating evidence.

Reference can be had to “Jgbal Shah V/s.

The State” (1998 P Cr. L J 1177
[Peshawar].

9. The time of occurrence is 19:45
hours which was very promptly reported at
20:00 hours on the same day whereby the
present accused/respondent was directly
charged. Although the accused/respondent
was not previously known to the injured
witness PW-4 and other witnesses PW-5 and
PW-6 who have seen the occurrence,
however, in this regard the statement of
PW-7 is worth perusal as, according to him,
the accused Saram is his co-villager and was
known to him. Prosecution has examined
Ghaus-ur-Rehman as PW-4, who sustained
injuries in the occurrence. This PW stated in

his examination-in-chief that:

Attested copy of order dated
22.04.2019 passed by learned Judicial
Magistrate, Dargai, is available on the record
which transpires that the present accused had
applied for custody of the vehicle on
superdari by dint of his claim being owner
and last possessor of the motorcar. Pursuant
to the said order, the motorcar No. MQ 796/
Islamabad was: handed over to accused/
respondent vide receipt dated 22.04.2014
which is available on record as Ex.PW-9/2.

In view of the above referred evidence, the

“prosecution has been able to prove that

PW-4 had sustained injuries while Yousaf
Khan had died as a result of the accident
which had happened by the car of
accused/respondent. The doctor who have
examined the injured and the deceased has -
appeared as PW-4 and confirmed the death
of Yousaf Khan and injuries on the body of
the injured victim. However, the record is

not clear that the occurrence had taken place

(CrA No, 124-M of 2017 12.09.2019 acquittal appoals allowed 279 accident)

due to rash and negligent driving of the
accused respondent. The word ‘rash’ as
defined in Advanced Law Lexicon (se
Edition) means ‘acting without due
consideration or regard to consequences’
while the word ‘negligence’ has been
defined as ‘failure to use the care that a
reasonable and prudent person would have
used under the same or similar
circumstances’. However, for reaching at a
fair and just conclusion, all the surrounding
or attendant circumstances must be taken
into account which may affect the standard
of care reasonably required in a particular
case. The close perusal of the testimony of
the PWs in the present case though sufficient
to establish that the accused respondent was
driving the car at the relevant time but it is
not convincing enough to prove that he was
driving the car rashly and negligently. In
such circumstances, the said act of the

accused respondent amounts to Qatl-i-Khata

Tajamul (S.8} Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
(Cr.A No, 124-M of 2017 12.09.2019 acquittal appeals allowed 279 accident}
-14-

as defined and explained w/s 318 of the
Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and he cannot be
held guilty of the offence u/s 320 P.P.C.

10. The scheme of culpable
homicide not amounting to murder which is
indeed Qatl-i-Khata has been provided w/s
318, 319 and 320 P.P.C. For ready reference

the said provisions are reproduced as under:-

“318. Qatl-i-khata. Whoever,
without any intention to cause the
death of, or cause harm to a person,
causes death of such person, either by
mistake of act or by mistake of fact, is
said to commit gatl-i-khata.

319. Punishment for qatl-i-khata.-
Whoever commits gatl-i-khata shall
be liable to Diayat.

Provided that, where gatl-i-khata-is
committed by any rash or negligent
act, other than rash or negligent
driving, the offender may, in addition
to Diyat, also be punished with
imprisonment of either description for
a term which may extend to five years
as ta’azir.

320. Punishment for qatl-i-khata by
rash or negligent driving. Whoever
commits gatl-i-khata by rash or
negligent driving shall, having regard
to the facts and circumstances of the
. case, in addition of Diyat, be punished

Tajamul ($.B} Hon’bte Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
{Cr.ANo. 124-M of 2017 12.09.2019 acquittal appeals allowed 279 accident)
-15-

with imprisonment of _ either
description for a term which may
extend to ten years”.

Bare reading of the above
provisions would reveal that the essential
and basic punishment u/s 319 P.P.C is Diyat
only, however, according to the proviso to
said section when the said act of Qatl-i-
khata is result of rash and negligent act other
than rash and negligent driving then the
accused, if found guilty, shall be punished,
in addition of Diyat, with imprisonment
which may extend to five years. Similarly, if
Qatl-i-khata is committed with rash and .
negligent driving then the convict, in
addition of Diayt, may also be punished with
imprisonment which may extend to 10 years
u/s 320 P.P.C. Thus, the rationale behind the
aforesaid three provisions of law is that even
if the accused is charged for rash and
negligent act thereby causing gatl-i-khata of
a person and the prosecution could not

establish the element of rash and negligence
in the act or omission of the accused then the
accused will not be entitled to acquittal but
he may be held guilty of the offence of Qati-
i-khata as provided u/s 319 P.P.C. I am also
conscious of the fact that the accused at the
trial was charged u/s 320, P.P.C and his
conviction u/s 319 P.P.C at appellate stage
would obviously amount to alteration in his
charge, however, this occasion has been
taken care of by section 237, Cr.P.C which
empowers the Court to convict an accused
for an offence although for which he was not
charged. The only exception to this rule is
that for offence of which the Court is
convicting the accused should not be greater
than the offence for which he was charged.
In this regard reliance is placed on

“Jehanzeb Khan V/s. The State” PLD 1963

(W.P) Peshawar 145.

(Cr.A No, 124-M of 2017 12.09.2019 acquittal appeals allowed 279 accident)

11. Upshot of the above discussion
is that the evidence on record discloses the
offence of accused respondent punishable
u/s 319, P.P.C and the learned trial Court has
reached at a wrong conclusion by acquitting
him in the case. Resultantly, both these
connected criminal appeals bearing
No. 124-M and 127-M of 2017 are allowed
and accused/respondent Saram son of Bacha
is convicted under section 319 PPC to pay
Diyat to the legal heirs of deceased Yousaf
Khan son of Dildar Khan. He is also
convicted u/s 337-G PPC and sentenced to

pay Daman of-an amount of Rs.300,000/-

(rupees three lacs) to injured Ghausor

Rehman son of Sher Zaman. Regarding the
said quantum of Daman, the injured Ghaus-
ur-Rehman has not produced any certificate
or document regarding the expenses incurred
by him on his treatment, however, keeping
in view the injury on his body i.e complete

fracture of right femur at shaft region and the

- 18 -

anguish caused to him due to the said
accident, the amount of Rs.300,000/- appears
to be an appropriate amount of Daman
payable to him. The accused/respondent be
taken into custody and may be kept in Jail
until the payment of Diyat and Daman.
However, he may apply to the learned trial
Court for his release on bail in terms of
sections 331/337-Y P.P.C.

short order of the even date.
