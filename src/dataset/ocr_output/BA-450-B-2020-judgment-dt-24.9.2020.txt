SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.-- The petitioners after having been
booked in case F.I.R No. 154 dated 13.03.2020 applied for his post-
arrest bail before the court of Sessions Judge, Lakki Marwat, which
was declined vide order dated 27.08.2020. Feeling aggrieved the
petitioners approached this Court through the instant bail petition.

2. The alleged precise facts of the prosecution case, as
per contents of F.LR, are that on 13.03.2020 at 1810 hours, the
complainant Gul Nawaz Khan made a report to the local police in
Emergency Room City Hospital, Lakki Marwat, alleging therein
that on the eventful day, ic. 13.03.2020, he along with his cousin
Barkat Wali son of Wali Khan his co-villager was present near
Kabir Gravyard, while his other cousin Mirza Ali Khan was also
walking there; that at about 1745 hours, Fidaullah and Taj Ali sons

of Amir Khan r/o Mohallah Surki Khel, Saeed Khel, presently
-2-

Michan Khel (petitioners herein) came there on motorcycle duly
armed with Kalashnikovs; that accused stopped their motorcycle
and started firing with their respective weapons upon Mirza Ali
Khan, with the intent to commit his Qatl-e-Amd, as a result of
which he (Mirza Ali Khan) was hit and fell down and thereafter the
accused/petitioners also made firing upon the complainant and his
companion Barkat Wali, with intent to commit their Qatl-e-amd,
however, they luckily escaped unhurt; that after the occurrence the
accused/ petitioners fled away from the spot on motorcycle; that
when the complainant along with his cousin Barkat Ali attended
Mirza Ali Khan, he had expired. Motive behind the occurrence was
stated to be previous blood feud. On the report of complainant Gul
Nawaz, murasila was drafted and sent to Police Station, on the basis
of which instant F.I.R was registered.

3. Learned counsel for the parties along with Asstt:
Advocate General, were heard at length, and with their valuable
assistance the record was gone though.

4, The incident occurred on 13.03.2020 where the
deceased was fired at who got injured and later on succumbed to his
injuries in the hospital, which led to a charge against the petitioners.
One Gul Nawaz Khan is the complainant of the case with one
Barkat Wali as the eye-witness and the motive was stated to be
previous blood feud. It is pertinent to mention that on the same day
i.e. 13.03.2020, one Shafgatullah Khan PASI, recorded Daily Diary
No.13, where he stated that on 13.03.2020, he was informed
regarding a drug peddler busy in selling narcotics in the area and on

information he reached there and arrested the accused, who along
-3-

with the contraband was sent to the Police Station and was still
present in the area, when he received the information regarding the
present occurrence and as such he rushed to the spot, which was
adjacent to Kabir graveyard and found one person lying injured,
who was there and then shifted to City Hospital, Lakki, and that
later on his name surfaced as Mirza Ali Khan advocate. The Daily
Diary further tells that he went after the accused and found them
running, who were chased, commanded to stop but they did not and
an encounter took place between the parties, which lasted for 20-
minutes and he also requested reinforcement which was provided in
the shape of rider squad; and that ultimately the accused/ petitioners
were arrested and recoveries of two Kalashnikovs and ammunition
were effected from their possession.

5. The two stories, one narrated by the complainant
when he reported the matter in City Hospital Lakki and the other
which we have in the shape of Naqal Mad No.13 dated 13.03.2020
tells in a different way. The police official who reached the place of
the incident found only the deceased then injured lying on the
ground, but no one was found present at the place of incident at the
time when he reached there. Had the complainant and the eye-
witness been present there, they would have reported the matter on
the spot and would have charged the petitioners for the murder of
the deceased and ineffective firing upon them, but they did not,
whereas on the other hand in Naqal Mad No. 13 the complainant and
eye-witness did not find mention. The learned counsel representing
the petitioners strongly objected and stated that Daily Diary No.13,

cannot be taken into consideration at this stage as it amounts to

-4-

deeper appreciation of evidence, but we cannot welcome his this
submission, as at bail stage the courts of law have not been
prohibited to go through the available record as bail applications
cannot be heard and decided in vacuum, even otherwise DD No.13
needs no interpretation rather a cursory glance tells of what
Shafgatullah ASI observed and did on the spot. The two documents
ie. the report made by the complainant and the Daily Diary when
placed in juxtaposition it tells of two different stories, one with the
complainant and eye-witness who witnessed the incident and the
other a competent police officer with no affiliation to either side
who narrated what he saw. Though we are conscious of the fact to
avoid any comment upon the status of the document but this Court
can consider the theme of both the documents for the purpose of
bail. The record further tells that two empties of 30 bore were
recovered from the place of incident and on arrest of the petitioners
after chase and encounter weapons were recovered from their
possession, which were later on dispatched to the Forensic Sciences
Laboratory along with the recovered empties for comparison where
a negative report was received. We are conscious of the fact that
while hearing bail applications tentative assessment is warranted
with strong dislike for deeper appreciation of evidence, but we
cannot ignore that bail matters cannot be decided in vacuum and

that is what the apex Court has held in case titled “Zaigham Ashraf

Vs the State and others’ (2016 SCMR 18).

“9, To curtail the liberty of a person is a
serious step in law, therefore, the Judges

shall apply judicial mind with deep thought

x

-5-

for reaching at a fair and proper conclusion
albeit tentatively however, this exercise shall
not to be carried out in vacuum or in a
flimsy and casual manner as that will defeat
the ends of justice because if the accused
charged, is ultimately acquitted at the trial
then no reparation or compensation can be
awarded to him for the long incarceration, as
the provisions of Criminal Procedure Code
and the scheme of law on the subject do not
provide for such arrangements to repair the
loss, caused to an accused person, detaining
him in Jail without just cause and reasonable

ground.”
6. Having said this, the tentative assessment of available
record takes this Court to hold that the petitioners have been
succeeded in making out a case for bail, being one of further
inquiry, resultantly, this bail petition is allowed and the accused/
petitioners are admitted to bail, subject to furnishing bail bonds
amounting to Rs. 300000/-(three lac) each with two sureties each in
the like amount to the satisfaction of Trial Court / MOD concerned.

Above are the detailed reasons of my short order of
the even date.
