SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.--- This criminal
appeal is directed against the judgment dated 26.04.2019,
in Sessions Case No.58/SC of 2016, passed by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-II, Lakki Marwat, whereby the
appellant Ikramullah involved in case F.IL.R No. 466 dated
29.12.2014 registered at Police Station Ghazni Khel, Lakki
Marwat was convicted under section 302(b) P.P.C and
sentenced to death, with compensation Rs.200000/-(two
lacs) under section 544-A Cr.P.C, or in default to further
undergo six months imprisonment. MR No.4-B of 2019
has also been sent by the learned trial Court, hence, this

judgment shall decide both.
2. The prosecution story, in brief, is that on
29.12.2014 at 1730 hours, complainant Shafiullah brought
the dead-body of his brother Sadam Hussain with the help
of co-villagers in a private datsun, to the Police Station
Ghazni Khel, and reported the matter that he alongwith his
brother Sadam Hussain were present at the place of
occurrence for watching volleyball match; that he was
sitting on the ground, whereas his brother Sadam Hussain
was sitting at top of the said Band. Meanwhile at about
16.30 hours accused Ikramullah duly armed with
Kalashnikov appeared and both the deceased and the
accused went in altercation, where after accused
Ikramullah Khan started firing at his brother, as a result of
which he was hit and fell down, while the accused
decamped from the spot. When the complainant attended
his brother he was breathing his last. Motive for the
occurrence alleged by the complainant was exchange of
hot words/ altercation between the accused and the
deceased a few days prior. The report of complainant was
reduced in shape of F.I.R Ex: PA by Ghaos Ullah Khan
ASI (PW-04), who prepared injury sheet Ex: PW-4/] and
inquest report Ex: PW 3/2, of the deceased and handed
over the same alongwith dead-body of deceased to
constable Munawat Khan No. 22 (PW-03) who escorted it
to RHC Titar Khel, where Dr. Matiullah M.O. (PW-01)
conducted post mortem of the deceased. Zeri Gul ASI,

PW-10 investigated the case, who on receipt of copy of
F.1.R proceeded to the spot, prepared site-plan (Ex: PB),
secured blood stained earth from the place of deceased
alongwith two empties of 7.62 bore, which were taken into
possession vide recovery memo Ex: PW 9/1. He also took
into possession blood stained garments of the deceased
vide recovery memo Ex:PW 9/2, post mortem report Ex:
PM, F.S.L. reports Ex: PW 10/4 and 10/5, regarding the
crime empties and blood stained earth and placed the same
on file. He after recording statements of witnesses and
conducting further necessary investigation submitted the
case file to Abdul Hakim SHO, Police Station Ghazni Khel
(PW-01), for submission of complete challan, which was
accordingly submitted on 10.01.2015, proceedings under
section 512 Cr.P.C. were initiated and ultimately the
appellant was declared as proclaimed offender vide order

dated 26.01.2016.

3. The accused Ikramullah was arrested on
11.05.2016 and after completion of necessary investigation
supplementary challan was submitted against him on
25.05.2016, by Haider Ali Shah S.H.O. (PW-8) and the
case was entrusted to the learned trial Court. The
formalities provided under section 265-C Cr.P.C were
complied with. Charge was framed against the appellant on
30.08.2016, to which he did not plead guilty and claimed
trial. The prosecution in order to prove guilt of the accused
produced and examined as many as ten (10) witnesses. On

close of prosecution evidence statement of accused was
4

recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he professed
his innocence, however, he neither wished to be examined
on oath as provided under section 340(2) Cr.P.C, nor opted
to produce evidence in his defence. After hearing
arguments of learned counsel for the parties, the learned
trial Court vide impugned judgment dated 26.04.2019
convicted and sentenced the accused to death, hence the

instant criminal appeal alongwith murder reference.

4, The learned counsel for the parties alongwith
Addl: Advocate General representing the State were heard
at length and with their valuable assistance the record was

gone through.

5. It was on 29.12.2014, that the complainant
reported the matter to the local police in Police Station
Ghazni Khel regarding the death of the deceased that on
eventful day it was at 1630 hours, when the deceased was
present on Lorra Band (raised surface) when the appellant
approached there and after altercation he resorted to firing
which hit the deceased, who fell on the ground and died
after some time. The complainant stated in his report that
he alongwith the deceased were watching volleyball match
near the place of occurrence. The place of occurrence is
situated at a distance of 2 and a half kilometre from the
Police Station and is surrounded by vacant / barren lands,
and to its east there is a ravine, whereas to the west at a
distance of 54 feet from the said band the complainant

disclosed his presence and watching volleyball match. It is
pertinent to mention that ‘Lorrah Band’ has a height of 12
feet with a 10 feet width where the deceased at the time of
incident was shown all alone and was done to death. We
are surprised to see that when the complainant was present
on the ground watching volleyball match, what led the
deceased to go up and watch the match from such a long
distance, when his brother (complainant) was present on
the ground. We are yet to see that wherefrom the appellant
approached and how the complainant witnessed his coming
to the spot and heard the altercation between the two. The
distance between the deceased and the appellant is given as
15 feet and it is in the evidence that an altercation started
between the two and thereafter the appellant resorted to
firing. The complainant was examined as PW-10, who
stated that when the convict/ appellant attracted to the spot,
he started altercating with the deceased and the altercation
went on where after the appellant started firing on the
deceased. The distance between the deceased and the
appellant is given as 15-feet and if the appellant started
altercation then instead he should have come much closer
to the deceased but this long distance excludes the
possibility of the two having altercated. The complainant
stated that a few days earlier the deceased and the appellant
had altercated with each other and that the previous
episode was the motive which attracted the convict/
appellant to the site of occurrence to settle the score. If the

present incident was the aftermath of previous altercation
6

then instead of entering into altercation the assailant soon
on arrival would have fired upon the deceased, had he
come with the intention. It is in the evidence that soon after
the fire was made the complainant rushed to the deceased
and found him struggling between life and death, but he
lost the battle. The time between injury and death is given
as 20-40 minutes, whereas the deceased was put in the
datsun for Police Station when he breathed his last. This is
an element of surprise that when the complainant soon
after the incident attracted to the deceased and so the other
people, who were watching the volleyball match then why
they did not immediately shifted the injured to the hospital
to save his life; and that why all arrangements were made
when the deceased breathed his last. The conduct displayed
by the complainant is not only strange but abnormal as
well, that no immediate efforts were made to save the life
of the deceased by shifting him immediately to the hospital
when there were still chances to survive. The presence of
the complainant on the spot is yet a mystery as the scribe,
who was examined as PW-04, stated that the dead-body
was brought by 7/8 co-villagers, but he did not utter a
single word regarding presence of the complainant with the
deceased. The report was made in the Police Station which
was taken down by one Ghousullah Khan ASI, who was
examined as PW-04, who stated that he prepared the injury
sheet and the inquest report and admitted that he did not

put the F.L.R number and sections of law there on, which
indicates that these documents were prepared when the
dead-body was brought to Police Station by the co-
villagers and that by then the F.J.R was not registered. Had
the F.1.R been registered, then definitely the inquest report
would bear the F.I.R number as well as the sections of law.
The presence of the complainant is further doubted that
despite presence in the Police Station, he did not identify
the dead-body of the deceased to the police at the time of
preparation of inquest report, and so before the doctor at
the time of post mortem examination, rather we find one
Aneesullah and Raheemullah, who identified the dead-
body before the police and the doctor. Both the
complainant and the scribe are not in harmony as the
complainant stated that it was he who accompanied the
dead-body from the spot to Police Station, but contrary
when the scribe was examined as PW-04, he stated that the
dead-body was brought to the Police Station by 7/8 co-
villagers and he did not mention presence of the
complainant at the time of arrival of the dead-body. The
presence of the complainant is further doubted when he
stated that after the report was made the dead-body was
sent to the mortuary under the escort of one constable
Munawar whereas he was directed by the police officials to
go home. We are surprised that what urgency was there
that the complainant was directed to go home instead
accompanying the dead-body to the mortuary for post

mortem examination. The conduct displayed by the
&

complainant on leaving for home from the Police Station is
not natural and even it has questioned his veracity to a
greater extent, that how a brother could leave the dead-
body of his real brother unattended. The complainant did
not identify the dead-body of his brother before the police
at the time when the inquest report was prepared and
thereafter, had he been present in the Police Station when
the police was preparing the inquest report, he would have
been figured in the column of identification. Another
intriguing aspect of the case is that the complainant stated
that after making report he left for home on his motorcycle,
whereas nowhere on record he was shown in possession of
a motoreyele, it was in a datsun pick up that he alongwith
others allegedly brought the dead-body of his brother to the
Police Station, the statement of the complainant in this
respect tells nothing but that he was present in his house
and that it was after receiving information from Police
Station regarding the incident that he rushed to the Police

Station and thereafter the report was made.

In case titled “Muhammad_Ashraf alias
Acchu Vs the State” (2019 SCMR 652), wherein it is held

that:

“It is well settled that benefit of slightest
doubt must go to an accused and in a case
where the Court reaches a conclusion that
eye-witnesses were chance witnesses; they
had not witnessed the occurrence and the

prosecution story is concocted by the PWs,
then the case of the accused merits plain

acquittal.”
6. Aneesullah was examined as PW-07, who
stated that he was watching a football match at a distance
of some 500/550 meters from the place of occurrence and
that it was at 1630 hours when on hearing of the incident
he rushed to the spot and reached there at 1640 hours. He
further stated that on reaching there he found the
complainant alongwith Raheemullah present. The
complainant stated that the incident was also witnessed by
Junaid, Irfanullah, Raheemullah, Hanifullah and one Bilal.
Surprisingly, Raheemullah who identified the dead-body
before the police and the doctor was abandoned despite the
fact that he too was stated to be the eye-witness of
occurrence. Withholding of the best available evidence
speaks nothing but that had he been produced he would not
have supported the charge of the complainant against the
conviet/ appellant and this is what Article 129(g) of the

Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 caters for.

In case titled, “Riaz Ahmad Vs the State”

(2010 SCMR 846), wherein it is held that:

“One of the eye-witnesses Manzoor
Hussain was available in the Court on
29-7-2002 but the prosecution did not
examine him, declaring him as
unnecessary witness without realizing
the fact that he was the most important,

only serving witness, being an eye-
10

witness of the occurrence. Therefore,
his evidence was the best piece of the
evidence, which the prosecution could
have relied upon for proving the case
but for the reasons best known, his
evidence was withheld and he was not
examined. So a presumption under
Illustration (g) of Article 129 of Qanun-
e-Shahadat Order, 1984 can fairly be
drawn that had the eye-witness Manzoor
Hussain been examined in the Court his
evidence would have been unfavourable

to the prosecution.”

7. The Investigating Officer visited the spot and
on pointation of the complainant blood was secured from
the place of the deceased alongwith two empties of 7.62
bore. The Investigating Officer was examined as PW-10,
who stated that he reached to the spot at 06.40 p.m. and he
called the complainant on his mobile phone to reach the
spot, who accordingly approached and the needful was
done on his pointation. The Investigating Officer stated
that he did not record the statements of any independent
person in this repard and even he did not try to trace the
persons who were engaged in playing the volleyball match
at the time of incident. This is astonishing that the
complainant stated that some five others besides him
witnessed the occurrence and he also mentioned their
names but the Investigating Officer did not take the pains
to record their statements and this lack of interest on part

of the Investigating Officer as well as the complainant tells
il

nothing but that the murder was unwitnessed; and that no
volleyball match was in progress at the time of occurrence.
This factor finds support when the complainant stated in
his Court statement that he alone was watching volleyball
match and when he realized the blunder, he improved his
statement and stated that they all were five. There is no
denial to the fact that a volleyball team is consisting of 12
players, six playing on each side then how in all there were
five persons. The complainant on each step tells nothing
but lie. Though the complainant stated that the datsun was
arranged by one Irfanullah, but even the Investigating
Officer did not record his statement, the overall impact
which can be gathered from, is that the complainant was
later on procured and that it was after the preliminary
investigation that the report was made. Admittedly,
Raheemullah who identified the dead-body was present
with the deceased in the Police Station but even he did not

sign the report of the complainant as rider.

8. We know that prosecution is not bound to
setup motive in every case but once it is alleged and not
proved, then ocular account is required to be scrutinized
with great caution. It has been held in the case titled
"Hakim Ali Vs. The State" (1971 SCMR-432), that the
prosecution though not called upon to establish motive in
every case, yet once it has setup a motive and failed to
establish, the prosecution must suffer consequences and

not the defence. The above view has been reiterated in the
=k

12

case of "Amin Ullah Vs, The State" (PLD 1976 SC 629),

wherein, it has been observed by their lordships, that
motive is an important constituent and if found by the
Court to be untrue, the Court should be on guard to accept
the prosecution story. It was again re-enforced by the
august Supreme Court in the case of "Muhammad Sadiq
Vs. Muhammad Sarwar" (1997 SCMR 214). Again on
the same principle, case laws titled Noor Muhammad Vs.
The State and another" (2010 SCMR_997) and "Amin
Ali and another Vs. The State" (2011 SCMR-323) can

also be referred.

9. The learned counsel for the appellant
vehemently argued that the appellant remained absconder
for sufficient long time, but mere absconscion of accused
is not conclusive guilt of an accused person; it is only a
suspicious circumstance against an accused that he was
found guilty of the offence. However, suspicions after all
are suspicions, the same cannot take the place of proof, the
value of absconcion, therefore, depends on the facts of
each case. In case titled 'Liaqat Hussain and others Vs

Falak Sher and others" (2003 SCMR 611(a), wherein it

has been held:-

"(a) Eye-witnesses including the
complainant had failed to furnish a
plausible and acceptable explanation
for being present on the scene of
occurrence and were chance

witnesses---Prosecution case did not

4

13

inspire confidence and fell for short
of sounding probable to a man of
reasonable : prudence---Abscondence
of accused in such circumstances
could not offer any useful
corroboration to the case of

prosecution"

10. After thoroughly evaluating the evidence
available on file this court reaches to an inescapable
conclusion that the prosecution has miserably failed to
prove its case against accused/appellant. Resultantly, this
appeal is, therefore, allowed, the conviction and sentence
of the appellant recorded by the learned trial court is set-
aside and he is acquitted of the charge by extending him
the benefit of doubt, he shall be released forth with from
jail, if not required to be detained in connection with any
other case. The connected Murder Reference No.4-B of
2019 is answered in negative.

11. Above are the reasons of our short order of

the even date.
