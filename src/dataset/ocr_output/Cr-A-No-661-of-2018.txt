the sentences were ordered to run concurrently.
Benefit of section-382-B Cr. PC was extended to
the appellant.

2. Laconic facts of the prosecution case are that on
23.07.2014 at 18:15 hours the complainant Fazal Wajid s/o
Fazal Rehman reported the matter to the local police at

RHC Yar Hussain to the effect that on the day of
\

occurrence at the relevant time he along with his father,
brother and cousin Fazle:Raziq along with other relatives
after offering Asar prayer, came out of the Masjid and were
present in front of their house, when in the meanwhile, his
uncle Fazal Khaliq along with his son namely Fazal
Nadeem duly armed cam: out of their house and suddenly
started firing upon them. Resultantly, father of the
complainant namely Fazal Rehman and his brother Fazal
Ahmad got hit seriously and became unconscious, whereas,
the complainant and his cousin escaped unhurt. Motive for
the offence was disclosed to be a money dispute with the
accused. Report of the complainant was reduced into
writing in the shape of murasila, on the basis whereof the
instant case FIR was reg’stered against the accused. Later
on Fazal Ahmad succumbed to the injuries.

3. Initially, the accused were absconding, however,
after their arrest and completion of investigation, challan
against them was submitt2d before the trial Court. Formal
Charge was framed against them to which they did not

plead guilty and claimed trial.
4. The prosecution, in order to prove its case, produced
as many as thirteen as) witnesses and on closure of
prosecution evidence, the accused were examined under
Section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein they denied the prosecution
version. They neither wished to be examined on oath
within the meaning of section 340(2) Cr.PC, nor desired to
produce evidence in their defense. On conclusion of trial,
after hearing the learned counsel for the parties and
appraisal of evidence available on the file, the learned trial
Court vide impugned judgment dated 07.07.2018 convicted
and sentenced the appellant Fazal Khaliq, as described in
the opening paragraph of the judgment.

5. Feeling aggrieved from his conviction and sentence,
the appellant has approac1ed this Court by filing Criminal
Appeal No.661-P/2018 with the prayer that the impugned
judgment may be set aside and he may be acquitted from
the charges leveled against him. Fazal Wajid complainant
being not satisfied fro’ the impugned judgment, filed
Criminal Revision No.96-P/2018 for enhancement of

sentence awarded to the appellant. The complainant also
filed Criminal Appeal No.722-P/2018 against acquittal of
co-accused Fazal Nadeem;

6. We have heard arguments of the learned counsel for
the parties and perused the record carefully with their
valuable assistance.

7. In the unfortunate tacident, one lost his life, whereas,
the other got seriously injured. The matter was reported by
the complainant in RHC Yar Hussain, Tehsil Lahor, in the
shape of murasila. The scribe after drafting the murasila
prepared the injury sheet,and inquest report and thereafter
the injured was referred to the doctor for his medico legal
examination, whereas, the deceased was taken to the doctor
for post mortem examination. The Investigating Officer,
after receiving copy of the FIR visited the spot and on
pointation of the eye witnesses prepared the site plan.
During spot inspection the Investigating Officer collected
blood through cotton and also 10 empties of 7.62 bore, five
each, from the respective places of the accused charged.
The appellant Fazal Khaliq was arrested and from his

personal possession, a Kalashnikov along with four spare
chargers, a bandolier with 150 live rounds without license,
were taken into possession and thereafter a case vide FIR
No.170 dated 13.07.2015 under section 15-AA / 13 of
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013 was registered
against the appellant. It is pertinent to mention that the
Investigating Officer, who was investigating case FIR
No.333 under section . 302/324/34 PPC, took into
possession the weapon of offence. Both, the Kalashnikov
recovered from personal possession of Fazal Khalig
appellant and empties collected from the spot were sent to
the firearms expert for opinion, as to whether the collected
empties were fired from the recovered weapon. This is
pertinent to mention that a report was received in positive,
with the explanation that all the collected empties were
fired from the recovered weapon. The co-accused namely
Fazal Nadeem was also arrested in the instant case and as
such both the appellant and the acquitted co-accused were
charge sheeted and the trial commenced. On
commencement of the trial, the accused/appellant Fazal

Khaliq was convicted and sentenced vide the impugned
judgment, whereas, the co-accused was acquitted from the
charges. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant approached this
court through the instant criminal appeal, whereas, the
respondent / complainant approached this court in the
connected criminal appeal against acquittal. Interestingly,
the prosecution too did not feel satisfy with the awarded
conviction also approached this court through the
connected criminal revision bearing No.96-P of 2018 for
enhancement of conviction awarded to the appellant.

8. _ As in the instant case one of the accused has been
convicted for life imprisonment, whereas, the co-accused
has been acquitted of the charges, so this court is to see as
to whether the approach of the learned trial court was
correct in that respect and as to whether the learned trial
judge fully appreciated the evidence available on file. As
two similarly placed accused met different treatment from
the learned trial court, that too, on the basis of the same
collected evidence and recorded statements, so this being
the court of appeal is under obligation to see as to what led

the trial court to reach to such a conclusion and this court is
further to see that whether the approach of the learned trial
judge is correct in that respect, more particularly, when the
learned trial court was swayed only and only with the
positive report in respect of the recovered weapon, from the
personal possession of the convict/appellant. As the
relationship between the patties is too close, so in order to
avoid miscarriage of justice, we deem it essential to scan
through the record once again, with the valuable assistance
of learned counsel for the parties. True that in the present
case, we have an injured 2ye witness, and equally true that
he charged both the convicted and acquitted accused for the
offence in hand, but it is not the rule of universal
application that whenever an injured witness appears before
the court of law, then no other presumption can be drawn,
but that he would be telling the truth. If the courts of law
would travel with this concept in mind, then on one hand,
the criminal jurisprudence will suffer, whereas, on the
other, the possibility of miscarriage of justice cannot be
excluded, so in the circumstances, both the learned trial

court as well as this court must be conscious enough to
i
apply its judicial mind strictly, in accordance with the

evidence collected and statements recorded,

9. The moot questions for determination before this
court are as to whether the incident occurred in the mode,

é

manner and at the stated time; as to whether the
complainant and eye witness were present on the spot at the
time of incident; as to whether the prosecution succeeded
in proving the motive on record and as to whether the

accused was arrested in. the mode and manner and the

weapon was recovered from his possession.

Tome =H > ~- The--record—tells -that--the—unfortunate—incident--—--- —
occurred just in front of the houses of the parties, where
one of the party ie. the complainant, witnesses and the
deceased came out of the mosque and the other i.e. the
accused from their house and on seeing the complainant
party, the accused started firing at them and that from the
firing made by the accused the witness got injured and the
deceased lost his life, whereafter both the injured and the
deceased were rushed to the hospital for treatment and

management. We are to see as to whether the witnesses
remained consistent on material aspects of the case and as
to whether the statement of the complainant is running in
harmony with that of eye witness. In order to appreciate
this particular aspect of the case, we deem it essential to go
through the statements of the witnesses. It is an undoubted
fact that out of the firing made, one got injured and the
other lost his life. It is further evident from the record that
both the parties are closely related to each other, but this
aspect of the case alone is not sufficient to hold the accused
responsible for the tragedy, but without having been
influenced from this aspect of the case, we deem it essential
to ascertain from the record as to whether the incident
occurred in the manner as was portrayed. The learned trial
Court, on one hand, acquitted the co-accused, whereas, on
the other, on the same set of evidence, convicted the
appellant. We are to determine as to whether the incident
was preplanned and the «ccused, charged, attracted to the
spot to execute the plan. We are yet to see as to whether the
coming together of the accused is a sufficient circumstance

to convince this court that both the accused charged fired at
11

the deceased and the injured with common intention. For
this particular purpose, we are to revisit the entire record to
ascertain as to what led to the present tragedy and as to
what prompted the accused charged to eliminate the
complainant party. As both the parties are closely related
and that nothing was brought on record that apart from the
alleged motive, they ever nourished a grudge against each
other, so in particular ciscumstances of the present case,
this court is under the obligation to see as to whether the
same could be a cause for the accused to do away with the
complainant party and as to whether the prosecution could
succeed in bringing on record that there was preplanning
and consultation between the accused charged. In order to
appreciate this particular aspect of the case, we deem it
essential to go through the site plan prepared by the
investigating officer. The site plan was prepared on the
instance of the eye witnesses, where both the accused as
well as the complainant party have been assigned their
respective places. It is pertinent to mention that the inter-se

distance between the accused charged and the complainant
12

as well as the deceased is shown as 3 to 4 paces. In order to
assess the common intention on part of the accused, it is a
must for this court to take into consideration the act
performed by the accused;a little before the incident and at
the time of incident. There is no denial of the fact that
according to the complainant, both the accused i.e. the
convict appellant and the acquitted co-accused were armed
with sophisticated weapons. We are surprised to see that
when the accused were having the common intention and
that when they were in possession of deadly weapons, then
what precluded them to eliminate the abandoned eye
witness, the injured witness and the deceased as well, but
this particular aspect of the case is indicative of the fact that
neither the accused came to the spot with a common
intention nor the purpose was to eliminate the complainant
side. We cannot ignore that the deceased received a solitary
injury on his forehead and the injured witness a single
lacerated wound. When the intention was to do away with

the complainant side then there was hardly an occasion for

the witnesses to escape urhurt, as the assailants were in full
13

é
control of the situation, that too, having sophisticated
weapons in their possession. When the prosecution failed
to convince this court regarding the preplanning,
premeditation and preconcert on part of the accused, then

j
we lurk no doubt in mind that the incident occurred at spur
of the moment. When the common intention is not
established from the record, then every accused is to be
held responsible for his individual act and in that
eventuality, this is for the prosecution to tell that which of
the accused caused which injury. The august Supreme

Court of Pakistan in the case of “Magsood Pervez alias

Billa and another Vs The State (2000 SCMR 1859) has

held that:

“It is clear that evidence on record is
not sufficient to come to 4a
conclusion that the appellants had at
any stage common intention with the
principal accused to commit the
murder. In the absence of the
common intention the appellants
would be liable for their individual
act which they committed in the
episode. We thus hold that the

prosecution -has not been able to
14

prove beyond any reasonable doubt
the common intention of the
appellants alongwith the main
accused to commit the murder of
Hakim Ali in furtherance of pre-
planned design. Thus we extend the
benefit of doubt to the appellants and
acquit them of the charge of murder
and while accepting their appeal to
that extent modify the impugned
judgment.”

11. During spot inspection, the investigating officer
collected 10 empties, 5 each from the place of each
accused. The collected empties were sent to the firearms
expert along with the recovered weapon from possession of
the convict appellant, wherefrom a report was received in
positive. It is pertinent to mention that the site plan was
prepared on the pointation of the witnesses and it was in
their presence, that the empties were collected from the
places assigned to the accused, but the laboratory report
tells that all the 10 empties were fired from the recovered
weapon. This particular aspect of the case has shaken the
very foundation of the prosecution case to a greater extent.

If we believe that the empties collected were fired from the
15°

recovered weapon, then in that eventuality, we are to accept
that it was the doing of a single accused, but as the
recoveries were effected from two different places, then the
!
laboratory report, in itself, goes against the prosecution
case and even the report, so tendered, by the firearms
expert has belied the story narrated by the complainant.
The complainant while reporting the matter charged both
\
the convict/appellant ani the acquitted co-accused for
general role of firing, with no specification, as to which of
the accused caused which of the injury. The prosecution
could not succeed in proving that who out of the two
should be held responsible for which of the injury, as the
injured received a lacerated wound, whereas, the deceased,
a fatal shot. As both the injuries carry different
punishments and in case of individual liability, every
accused charged is to be: held responsible for the act he
committed, so this is for the prosecution to tell that which
injury was caused by the appellant and which, by the

acquitted co-accused. When such is the state of affairs, this

court is not hesitant in hclding that the evidence failed to
16

convince that it was the convict/appellant, who fired the
fatal shot and in such evehtuaity, this court cannot restrain
itself from extending the benefit of doubt to the
convict/appellant, as the law is settled that benefit of doubt,
if arises, must be extended to the accused charged. In this

respect, reliance could al3o be placed on judgment of the

Apex Court in case titled “The State through P.G. Sindh

and others Vs_ Ahmed Omar Sheikh and others” (2021

SCMR 873) wherein it was held that:

“Even if ¢ single circumstance
create reasonable doubt in a
prudent mind regarding guilt of an
accused then the accused shall be
entitled to such benefit not as a
matter of grace and concession but
as a matter of right and such
benefit must be extended to the
accused person(s) by the Courts

without any reservation.”

12. The complainant while reporting the matter disclosed
that besides him, the incident is witnessed by one Fazle
Raziq and other people’ of the locality, but when the
complainant and the injured eyewitness were examined

before the trial court, they deviated from the previous
é

stance and stated that apart from the complainant, the
eyewitness, the deceased and the injured, no other person
was present on the spot. This is the case of the prosecution
that soon after performing Asar Prayer, they came out of
the mosque and were busy in chitchat, when the incident
occurred. If we accept that in fact, the incident occurred
soon after Asar Prayer, then numerous co-villagers must
have been present in the: thoroughfare, but the witnesses
made a willful attempt to deny their presence for the simple
reason that no one was ready to support the claim of the
complainant. This is interesting to note that one Fazal
Raziq was cited as the eyewitness, but he was not produced
before the trial court, despite the fact that the complainant,
in his report, stated that he was also fired at by the accused.
No plausible reasons are available on record as to why PW
Fazal Raziq was not procuced, so in such eventuality, we
are constrained to form an opinion that he was not ready to
support the stance of the complainant and had he been

produced, he would have disclosed the real facts before the

court of law. When the: best available evidence is not
18

produced then an inference can be drawn that had he been
produced, he would have not supported the claim of the
complainant, so this court is constrained to draw an
inference adverse to the prosecution. Article 129 (g) of the
Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 caters for the situation.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court in one of its judgments

reported as “Lal Khan Vs The State” (2006 SCMR 1846)
was pleased to hold that:

“The prosecution is certainly not
required to produce a number of
witnesses as the quality and not the
quantity of the evidence is the rule
but non-production of most natural
and material witnesses of
occurrence, would strongly lead to
an inference of prosecutorial
misconduct which would not only be
considered a source of undue
advantage for possession but also an
act of suppression of material facts
causing prevudice to the accused.
The act of withholding of most
natural and a material witness of the
occurrence would create an
impression that the witness if would
have been brought into witness-box,

he might not have supported the
ad

prosecution and in such eventuality
the prosecution must not be in a

position to avoid the consequence.”

13. The record tells that during spot inspection, the
investigation officer collected from the spot 10 empties of
7.62 bore, but the same were not sent to the laboratory
either for safe custody or. for ascertaining the fact that the
same were fired from one or different weapons, but the
same were sent to the laboratory by the time when the
weapon of offence was allegedly recovered from
possession of the convici/appellant. As on one hand, the
prosecution could not bring on record as to where the
empties were lying from the date of its recovery till the
arrest of the appellant and on the other, the recovered
weapon along with the. empties were received to the
laboratory after a considerable delay, then we lurk no doubt
in mind that the prosecution could not succeed in proving
the safe custody of both the empties and the weapon. This
is interesting to note that’ at the time of arrest, it was one
Khalid Iqbal Khan, who took into possession the

Kalashnikov from the possession of the appellant and in
20

that respect, an FIR under section 15-AA was registered
and the same was sealed into a parcel by the investigating
officer. As one of the parcel was sealed by Khalid Iqbal
Khan ASI and the other by Muhammad Khan, who affixed
the monogram of M.K, but the laboratory report discloses
that all the three parcels were having the monograms in the
name of M.K i.e. Muhammad Khan, the Investigating
Officer. This uncertainty regarding sealing and affixing
monograms is a factor which has disturbed the veracity of
the collected evidence to a greater extent and as such, this
piece of evidence has lost its efficacy. When the
prosecution failed to prove on record the safe custody of
the collected weapon and recovered empties, and when the
recovered empties were not sent to the laboratory soon after
its recovery for ascertaining the fact that the same were
fired from one or different weapons, no other opinion can
be drawn, but that this piece of evidence is lacking
credence, that too, when the prosecution could not
convince regarding its safe custody. There is no cavil to the

proposition that firearms expert report is not a
21

corroborative piece of evidence, rather it is a circumstance,
which can be pressed into service, only and only, when the
prosecution otherwise succeeds in bringing home guilt
against the accused charged.

14. The motive was advanced as a dispute over an
outstanding amount, which the injured witness spent on the
trial of the convict / appellant, but neither the complainant
could produce independent evidence in that respect nor the
Investigating Officer took pain to collect any oral or
documentary evidence in that regard and in such
eventuality, the prosecution could not succeed in
establishing the alleged motive. When the injured
eyewitness was examined on this particular aspect of the
case, he stated that several Jirgas were convened to resolve
the dispute, but the Jirgas could not succeed. Neither the
complainant could mention the names of the Jirga
members, who undertook the task to resolve the differences

.

between the parties in respect of the outstanding amount,
nor the Investigating Officer could trace out the local elders

to record their statements in that respect. The lack of
22

interest on this particular matter both, by the complainant
and the Investigating Officer, has rocked the very
foundation of the prosecution case. True that weakness or
absence of motive is not the sole determining factor to
ascertain the veracity of the prosecution case, but equally
true that when the prosecution case is the only outcome of
the alleged motive, then, under those circumstances, the
prosecution cannot be absolved of its liability to prove the
same. In case, the prosecution in the circumstances could
not prove the alleged motive, then it is the prosecution to
suffer. As, the cause of death was the outstanding amount
between the parties, so the failure of the prosecution to
convince that in fact, the amount was outstanding will put
the prosecution at the losing end. The Apex Court in its
judgment reported as “Muhammad Ali Vs The State”

(2017 SCMR 1468) has held that:

“The motive set up by the
prosecution was the only factor
which could have propelled the
appellant into aggression against the
deceased and with failure of the

prosecution ; to prove the alleged
23

motive there was no earthly reason
left with the appellant to do away

with the deceased who was a lady.”
Similarly, in the case of “Muhammad

Ilyas Vs Ishfaq alias Munshi_and_ others (2022
YLR 1620), it was held that:

“It is well settled that once a motive
is set up it is imperative for the
prosecution to prove the same. On
failure whereof adverse inference
can be dawn against the
prosecution. Reference is made to
the cases of Muhammad Khan vy.
Zakir Hussain PLD 1995 SC 590
and Hakim Ali v .The State 1971
SCMR 432.”

14. True that the accused/appellant remained
absconder for sufficient long time, but abscondence alone
is not sufficient for holding an accused guilty, rather it is a
circumstance which can be weighed against the accused
charged, but only when the prosecution otherwise succeeds
in proving its case. As the prosecution failed to bring home
guilt against the accused charged, by producing trustworthy
and confidence inspiring witnesses, so this piece of

evidence cannot be pressed into service to favour the
24

prosecution. Reliance could also be placed on 2008 SCMR

1549 (Muhammad Yaqoob Vs Manzoor Hussain) wherein

it was held that:

“Insofar as the abscondence of
respondent is concerned, it may be
stated that mere absconsion is not
conclusive proof of guilt of an
accused person. It is only a suspicious
circumstance against an accused that
he was found guilty of the offence.
However, suspicions after all are
suspicions. The same cannot take the
place of proof. The value of
absconsion, therefore, depends on the
facts of each case. The courts have
admitted it is a supporting evidence of
the guilt of accused. The absconsion
of the accused may be consistent with
the guilt or iinocence of the accused,
which is to be decided keeping in view
overall facts of the case.”

15. The cumulative effect of what has been stated
above leads this court to an irresistible conclusion that the
learned trial court fell into error while handing down the
impugned judgment and as such, misdirected itself both on
facts and in law. The impugned judgment is suffering from

inherent defect which calls for interference. The instant
25

criminal appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment is set
aside and the appellant is acquitted of the charges. He shall
be released forthwith, if not required to be detained in
connection with any other criminal case.

16. As the appeal against conviction is allowed and the
impugned judgment has been set aside, so the criminal
appeal filed by the respondent/complainant against
acquittal of co-accused as well as the criminal revision
bearing No.96-P/2018 filed by the respondent/petitioner for
enhancement of the sentence awarded to the appellant, have
lost the efficacy and the same are dismissed as such.

17. The above are the detailed reasons for our short
order of even date.
