default thereof-to undergo-further six months S.I.
each. Appellant Dilawar was further convicted u/s
13 A.O and sentenced to one year R.I with fine of
Rs.2000/- or to suffer further seven days S.I. in case
of non-payment of fine whereas their co-accused

were acquitted of the charge.

zZ. Abstract of the prosecution case is that
on receiving information regarding murder in village
Anghapur, Muhammad Irshad Khan SHO (PW-6)
rushed to the house of appellant Noor Rehman and
found the dead body of a lady aged 24/25 years who
was slaughtered and lying in pool of blood.
Complainant Hazrat Rehman (PW-5), who was
present with the dead body, reported to S.H.O that
deceased Mst. Bakhtia was his sister who was
married to Abdur Rehman son of Gul Zaman some
seven years ago and the wedlock had resulted into
birth of two children. Husband of the deceased was
staying in Malaysia for earning livelihood whereas
the deceased and her children were residing in the
same house with her brother-in-law Noor Rehman,
one of the appellants/convicts. On the same day,
ladies of the house of appellant Noor Rehman came
to his house complainant and informed him that they

have been ousted by the present appellants from the

house whereas-the deceased had remained alone
there, thus, they apprehended threat to her life. The
complainant alongwith his uncle Zareef went to the
house of deceased where they found her slaughtered
body on a cot whereas the appellants had decamped
from the spot. While disclosing the motive, the
complainant stated that both the appellants were

suspecting the deceased to be of immoral character.

3. Report of the complainant was reduced

“into Murasila (Ex.PA/1) which was later converted

into formal F.I.R (Ex.PA). The appellants were
arrested on 28.07.2011. The matter was initially
investigated by Balezar Khan S.I (PW-8) who
visited the spot of occurrence, prepared site plan and
took into possession blood from the spot and blood-
stained garments of the deceased. On his transfer,
the task of remaining investigation was assigned to
Sher Muhammad Khan S.I (PW-7) who recovered
the crime weapons i.e a blood-stained dagger and 30
bore pistol on pointation of the appellants. He also
produced the appellants before concerned Magistrate

who recorded their confessional statements. During

_the course of investigation it also came to light that

co-accused Muhib Gul, being involved in illicit

relations with the deceased, had prepared her nude

video and published it through’ the other co-accused
Bahr-ul-Islam and Hamid Hassan. Thus, section 322
P.P.C was added in the F.LR and the above named
co-accused were accordingly charged in the case. It
is noteworthy that on the same allegation, another
case vide F.L.R No. 369 dated 19.07.2011 u/s 354-A/
249/34 P.P.C was also registered against the

aforesaid acquitted co-accused at P.S Daggar.

4. After completion of investigation,
challan was put in Court and all the accused
including the present appellants were formally
indicted for the offence to which they did not plead
guilty and opted to face the trial. Prosecution
produced ten witnesses in support of its case and
closed evidence. When examined u/s 342, Cr.P.C,
the accused once again denied the allegation of ©
prosecution, however, they neither produced any
witness in their defence nor. opted to be examined on
oath in terms of section 340(2), Cr.P.C. On
conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court through
the impugned judgment acquitted the co-accused
whereas convicted the present appellants as

discussed above, hence, this appeal.

5. We have heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the appellants as well as learned A.A.G.
for State and perused the record with their able

assistance.

6. It is matter of record that legal heirs of
the deceased have effected compromise with the
present appellants at trial stage. When the case came
up for hearing before this Court on 27.02.2018,
learned counsel for the appellants drew the attention
of this Court towards the compromise between the
parties. It was also noticed by this Court that the
appellants were behind the bars in the present case
since 2011 and ultimately they were convicted by
trial Court on 29.01.2014 against which the present
appellants preferred appeal on 24.02.2014, however,
the appeal could not be decided despite lapse of four
years. Thus, this Court vide order dated, 27.02.2018
suspended the conviction and sentence of the

appellants and directed them to be released on bail.

Zz. During the course of arguments on

03.09.2019, it surfaced from the record that the

“murder in the present case, having been allegedly

committed on the pretext of honor, is non-

compoundable in terms of section 345, Cr.P.C,

os: Hon'ble Mr. Justice (ghtlaq Ibrahim

however, the aforesaid bar was introduced through
Criminal Law (Amendment) (Offences in the Name
of or on Pretext of Honor) Act, 2016 and later on
extended to PATA. Thus, the main question which
arose at that juncture was that as to whether the said
Act can be applied to the present case which was
committed prior to the enforcement of the Act. For
resolution of the said controversy, M/S Aurngzeb,
Sabir Shah, Masood-ur-Rehman, Barrister Asad-ur-
Rehman, Jehanzeb Buneri and Aziz Ahmad Hashmi
Advocates were appointed as amicus curie who
assisted this Court regarding the applicability and
retrospective effect of section 311 P.P.C read with
section 345, Cr.P.C. Thereafter, record of the case
was sent to trial Court for confirmation of
compromise with directions to submit a detailed
report before this Court which has already been

received.

8. Admittedly, the clog on compromise in
honor killing cases was introduced through Criminal
Law (Amendment) (Offences in the Name or on
pretext of Honor) Act, 2016. Prior to that the offence
of honor killing was compoundable though of course
with permission of Court, however, thereafter the

ibid Amendment Act, 2016 was brought restricting

Hon‘ble Me, Justice Wiger Ahmad
TalamuyPs*

-7-

.compromise in honor -killing cases. The moot

questions before this Court are whether the said
Act would have retrospective effect on the present
case and what would be the relevant date of
composition of the offence in question. The
relevant date of composition of offence, in our
view, would be the date on which the occurrence
took place. In the present case the occurrence of
alleged honor killing took place in 2011 and by
that time the said offence was compoundable albeit
with permission of Court, therefore, the bar of
compromise introduced through the Amendment
Act, 2016 cannot be made retrospectively
applicable to this case. Reliance is placed on

Muhammad Arif and another Vs. The State and

another (1993 SCMR 1589). The august Supreme

Court of Pakistan, after making elaborate
discussion on the issue with special reference to
Article 264 of the Constitution read with section 6
of the West Pakistan General Clauses Act, 1956,

observed that:

From the above cited cases, it is evident that
there is judicial consensus that where a law is
repealed, it will not inter alia affect any
investigations, legal proceedings or remedy in
respect of any right, privilege, obligation,

oB: Hon’ble Mr, Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamnul/PS*

-8-

liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment,
and any such investigation, legal proceeding
or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and any such penalty, forfeiture or
punishment may be imposed as if the law had
not been repealed. This is so, inter alia,
because of section 6 of the General Clauses
Act, 1897 (which corresponds to section 4 of
the West Pakistan General Clauses Act,
1956), in the absence of any contrary
intention manifested in the relevant statute.

Certainly, the bar to compound the
offence so introduced in the Amendment Act, 2016
would take away certain rights of the present
appellants available to them under the existing law.
The established rule in such eventuality is that every
statute which takes away or impairs vested rights
enjoyed by a person under the existing law must be
presumed to be intended not to have retrospective
effect. Although the said rule is not applicable in
matters of procedure, however, if a statute deals
together with rights and procedure at the same time
then the Courts must prefer the construction to
protect the existing rights under the old procedure.
Reliance is placed on “Asif Ali Zardari Vs. The

State” (1993 PCr.LJ 781 Karachi) wherein it was

held that:

The consensus, therefore, appears to be that
unless such an intention has been expressed
in a statute or the same can be clearly
gathered by necessary intendment, no statute

pe: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ishtiag brahim
Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Wicsr Ahmad
Tamuyes*|

-9-

is to be construed so as to operate
retrospectively and take away vested or
substantive rights. There being a
presumption that the legislature could not
have intended to enact what is unjust, a
statute cannot be given retrospective
operation so as to impair existing rights,
whether they be contractual or vested rights,
or those acquired under a statute. The same
presumption would apply in case of statutes
creating a new obligation or a new disability
or imposing a new duty. However, since no
person has a vested right in the course of
procedure, any alteration in the procedure
must operate retrospectively, unless a
different intention can clearly be spelt out
from the statute itself. Where the rights and
procedure are dealt with together by a
statute such construction must be preferred
whereby existing rights are dealt with in
accordance with the old procedure and new
rights are dealt with by the new procedure.
The same rule should equally apply to rights
which have purely accrued under a statute.
However, as was held in Adnan Afzal's case,
if in the process of change of law any existing
rights are affected or the giving of retroactive
operation causes inconvenience or injustice,
then the Courts will not even in the case of
procedural statute, favour an interpretation
giving retrospective effect to the statute.

Thus, keeping in view the facts and
attending circumstances of the case, we deem it fair
and just to grant permission to compound the

offence and accept the compromise so effected by

the parties in the present case.

. 9. The learned trial Court has sent the file

of compromise proceedings to this Court according

to which the deceased is survived by her father

Sharif Khan, - mother Mest. Sahib Rana (died
afterwards), husband Abdur Rehman and two minor
children namely Azman (son) and Mst. Sahiba
(daughter). After death of Mst. Sahib Rana, her three
sons namely Afsar Khan, Hazrat Rehman and Aziz-
ur-Rehman and one daughter Mst. Asma also
descended the deceased as her legal heirs. Learned
trial Court has recorded joint statement of major
legal heirs of the deceased namely Sharif Khan

they have exhibited the compromise deed on

convicts by waiving their right of Diyat. Statement
of husband of the deceased was recorded by learned
trial Court through video link after confirming his
identity through Mr. Shah Hassan Khan Advocate,
Mushtaq Khan son of Karimullah and Hamid Khan
s/o Saifur Rehman in the open Court and to this
effect their joint statement was also recorded.

the local elders namely Ghani Bahadar and Umar
Rehman was recorded who have verified the
genuineness of the compromise. Joint share of both
the minor legal heirs namely Azman and Mst.
Sahiba amounting Rs.1,003,500/- (Rs.669,000/- for
the male child and Rs.334,500/- for the female child)
deposited by the present appellants to the trial Court
has been invested in profitable account /scheme
through Accountant of the Court of learned Sessions

Judge, Buner.

10. Report of the learned trial Court shows
that major legal heirs of the deceased have effected a
genuine compromise with the present appellants
without any pressure whereas interests of the minor
legal heirs have been protected through deposit of
their share in Diyat amount in profitable account.
Resultantly, this appeal is accepted on the basis of
compromise, the impugned judgment is set aside and
appellants Noor Rehman and Dilawar are acquitted
of the charge in case F.ILR No. 359 dated 16.07.2011
to the extent of offences u/s 302/322/34 P.P.C.

of appellant Dilawar u/s 13 A.O is maintained,
however, the sentence awarded to him under the said

offence is reduced to already undergone. The
