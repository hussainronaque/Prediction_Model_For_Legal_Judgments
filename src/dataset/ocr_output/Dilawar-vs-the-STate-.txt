JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, J:- This appeal has been filed
by appellant Dilawar son of Baghi Gul, against the
judgment dated 10.09.2016, of learned _ trial
Court/Additional Sessions Judge-V, Nowshera, whereby he
has been convicted under section 302(b) PPC and
sentenced to death and also to pay Rs.2,00,000/-, as
compensation to legal heirs of Sartaj deceased, in terms of
section 544-A Cr.P.C. and in default thereof to undergo 06
months S.I. in case FIR No.1023 dated 10.09.2016
registered under section 302 PPC at Police Station
Nowshera Kalan. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. has

been extended to him.
2. The learned trial Court has sent Murder
Reference No.15 of 2018 under section 374 Cr.P.C. for
confirmation of death sentence of convict Dilawar.

3. Since both the matters are the outcome of one and
the same judgment of the learned trial Court dated
25.05.2018, are being decided/answered through this
common judgment.

4. On 10.09.2016 at 1930 hours, complainant Qasim
Ali (PW.6), in company of dead body of his maternal
uncle, namely, Sartaj deceased reported to police in DHQ
hospital Nowshera Kalan to the effect that on the fateful
day he along with the deceased was on the way to the
playground for watching a volleyball match and at 1800
hours, when reached in front of house of Darakhshan near
the graveyard of village Kheshgi Payan, the appellant duly
armed with pistol suddenly emerged and opened fire at the
deceased, as a result, the deceased got hit on various parts
of his body and died there and then. After the occurrence,
the appellant decamped from the crime scene. Motive
behind the occurrence is stated to be that appellant was
suspecting the deceased that he has received his head
money. Report of complainant was incorporated in to
Murasila (Exh.PW.9/3) by Zainoor Shah ASI (PW.9)
which was verified by Mst. Muskan (widow of the
deceased). PW.9 prepared injury sheet and inquest report

of the deceased Exh.PW.9/1 and Exh.PW.2, respectively,
and shifted dead body of the deceased to the mortuary for
autopsy. He sent the Murasila to Police Station on the basis
of which FIR (Exh.PA), was registered against the
appellant by Bashir Ahmad SI (PW.4). Dr. Tariq Shah
CMO DHQ Hospital Nowshera Kalan (PW.2), conducted
autopsy on the dead body of the deceased on the same day
07.30 p.m. and opined the cause of death as result of
firearm injuries to his brain, heart and lungs vide PM report
Exh.PW.2/1. The probable time between injuries and death
has been opinion as “sudden”.

5. Fazal Muhammad Khan SI (PW.8) conducted
investigation in the case, he proceeded to the spot and
prepared site plan Exh.PW.8/1 on the pointation of
complainant Qasim Ali. During spot inspection he secured
bloodstained sand Exh.P.1 from the place of the deceased
and a 30 bore crime empty Exh.P.2 from the place of the
appellant, giving fresh smell of discharge vide recovery
memo Exh.PW.8/2. Vide recovery memo Exh.PW.8/3, he
took into possession the last worn bloodstained garments
of the deceased. He sent the bloodstained articles to the
FSL for chemical analysis and the crime empty for safe
custody and placed on file the Serologist report Exh.PZ,
initiated proceedings under section 204 and 87 Cr.P.C.
against the appellant, recorded statements of PWs u/s 161
Cr.P.C. and on completion of investigation handed over

case file to SHO for submission of challan u/s 512 Cr.P.C.
against the appellant. On 10.10.2016 he arrested the
appellant vide arrest card Exh.PW.8/10 and on his
pointation/discovery recovered a 30. bore pistol
No.KL556/1976 from a box inside his house, vide recovery
memo Exh.PW.9/12. He prepared the sketch of house of
the appellant and placed on file Fard Jambandi
Exh.PW.8/16 regarding ownership of the house of the
appellant, sent the crime pistol to the FSL for analysis
whereas the crime empty has already been sent to the FSL.
He placed on file the FSL report in this regard as Exh.PZ/1
which is in positive. After completion of investigation he
handed over the case file to SHO, who submitted challan
against the appellant before the learned trial Court.

6. On receipt of challan by the learned trial Court, the
appellant was formally charge sheeted to which he pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial. To prove guilt of the appellant,
the prosecution examined as many as nine witnesses. After
closure of the prosecution evidence statement of the
appellant was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein
he denied the prosecution allegations and professed
innocence. He, however, declined to be examined on oath
under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. or to produce evidence in
defence. On conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court,
after hearing both the sides, convicted and sentenced the

appellant, as mentioned above.
7. We have given our anxious consideration to the
arguments of learned counsel for the parties advanced at
the bar and perused the record with their valuable
assistance.

8. It appears from FIR (Exh.PA) that the occurrence
has taken place on 10.09.2016 at 06.00 p.m. which has
been reported at 07.30 p.m. by complainant Qasim Ali
(PW.6), wherein he has directly and singularly charged the
appellant for murder of the deceased. As per prosecution’s
evidence during the days of occurrence PW Qasim Ali was
a student of 9"" class, meaning thereby that he was about
13/14 years old. A young boy of 13/14 age, who had never
came across such like incident and had not yet seen the ups
and downs of the life, could not be expected to cook a false
story of murder of his maternal uncle and charge an
innocent person by substituting the real culprit. Perusal of
his report/FIR reveals that PW Qasim Ali has not
exaggerated the charge despite the fact that he could have
easily charged the appellant for an attempt at his life. His
deposition contains a ring of truthfulness and demonstrates
his straightforwardness. The appellant is the co-villager
and neighbor of PW Qasim Ali and was well known to him
prior to the occurrence. Being a broad daylight occurrence,
question of mistaken identity does not arise. Qasim Ali
while appearing in the witness box as PW.6 reiterated the

same story as set forth by him in his initial report and once
again charged the appellant singularly for murder of the
deceased. He stood firm by stating that site plan was
prepared at his pointation by the Investigating Officer. He
has been subjected to lengthy and taxing cross examination
but nothing beneficial to defence could be extracted from
his mouth. He remained stuck to his stance on each and
every material aspect of the incident. A look over his cross-
examination would reveal that many un-explained material
facts have been explained through him by the defence itself
making strengthen the prosecution case. Replying to
questions of defence, PW Qasim Ali has deposed that
deceased along with family was residing at Karchi,
however, two days prior to the occurrence he along with
his family had come to their house and was staying with
them in their house; that he along with the deceased left
their house at 5.40 P.M. for watching volleyball match;
that inter-se distance of his house and the crime spot can be
covered by foot within 15 to 20 minutes; that they might
have reached the place of occurrence within 15 to 20
minutes; that after the occurrence he rushed to his house
and informed his mother and maternal aunt who also
reached the spot; that some 40 minutes were consumed in
arranging vehicle for shifting the dead body of the
deceased during which period the dead body remained at
the spot. This part of statement fully corroborate the time

of occurrence as well as the time of report as advanced by
him in the FIR and leaves no room for consultation and
deliberation. Presence of PW Qasim Ali with the deceased
at the time of occurrence was quite natural as the deceased
was his maternal uncle and had visited along with his
family to the house of PW Qasim Ali and stayed there for
two days prior to the occurrence. As a routine observations
nephews/kith and kin do feel pleasure to visit with their
beloved uncles outside home for excursion. Leaving house
by PW Qasim Ali alongwith deceased for volleyball match
is quite natural . His his presence and proceeding to the
playground with his maternal uncle/deceased being natural
does appeal to a prudent mind as in our society after “Assar
prayers” times people do approach the playgrounds for
refreshment, playing or watching different physical games.
The defence has miserably failed to shatter the testimony
of eyewitness Qasim Ali, which otherwise is natural,
trustworthy and confidence inspiring, corroborated by
strong circumstantial pieces of evidence i.e. recovery of
bloodstained sand from the place of the deceased at the
spot, his last worn bloodstained clothes coupled with
positive Serologist report Exh.PZ in respect thereof.
Similarly, the medical evidence i.e. autopsy report wherein
the medical Officer has observed so many firearm injuries
on the person of the deceased and opined his cause of death

to be the result of firearm injures.
9. Fazal Muhammad Khan SI (PW.8) arrested the
appellant on 10.10.2016 and on his discovery recovered a
30 bore crime pistol No.KL556/1976 from a box lying in
residential room of his house. The said crime pistol
Exh.P.4 was sent to the FSL for analysis whereas the
empty already sent to the FSL for safe custody. The FSL
has furnished its report Exh.PZ/1, according to which the
30 bore crime empty has been fired from the crime pistol
recovered on the pointation/discovery of the appellant. This
strong piece of circumstantial evidence further corroborates
the ocular account of PW Qasim Ali. No reason and
circumstance has been brought on record by the defence so
as to remotely suggest substitution and false implication of
the appellant in the case. Admittedly, substitution of real
culprit charged directly and singularly is a rare
phenomenon in the system of criminal justice. Reference in
this regard can be made to case titled, “Allah Ditta Vs the
State” (PLD 2002 Supreme Court 52) and case titled
“Muhammad Iqbal Vs the State” (PLD 2001 Supreme
Court 222.

10. No doubt, PW Qasim Ali is the nephew of the
deceased who appeared as a solitary eyewitness, but it will
not advance the case of defence because the general public
in rural areas, always feel reluctant to depose against the
culprits due to fear of earning enmity etc. It is well

established principle of law that testimony of a witness
which is trust worthy and inspiring confidence cannot be
discarded on mere ground of his close relation with the
deceased. A close relative, if proved to be the natural and
truthful witness of the occurrence, cannot be termed as
interested witness. Statement of a witness on account of
being interested can only be discarded if it is proved that
he/she has ulterior motive on account of enmity or any
other consideration. No evidence whatsoever has been
brought by the defence to prove any enmity or grudge of
PW Qasim Ali with the appellant. Reference in this regard
can be made to case titled, “Khizar Hayat Vs the State”
(2011 SCMR 429). Thus, mere relationship PW Qasim Ali
with the deceased would not detract his veracity, as he had
absolutely no motive of his own to involve the appellant
falsely by letting off the real culprit. Reliance in this regard
can be placed on the judgments of the august apex court in
case, titled, “Saeed Akhtar and others Vs the State”

(2000 SCMR_ 383). In case titled, “Amal Sherin and

another Vs the State through A.G.” (PLD 2004 Supreme

Court 371), the Hon’ble Supreme Court while dilating
upon the evidentiary value of statement of related
witnesses has ruled as under:-

“The trial Court was not justified to reject
eyewitness account furnished by
complainant Khan Amir PW and Hakim Gul
PW merely on the ground of being related

and interested particularly when appellants
10

had not been able to establish on record that
the above mentioned witnesses had
nourished any grudge or ill will against them
and deposed with a specific motive”.

11. The next point for determination is that whether
conviction can be recorded in a capital charge on the basis
of solitary statement of an eyewitness? the answer is in the
affirmative provided the solitary eyewitness is true,
trustworthy, confidence inspiring and his testimony is
corroborated by strong circumstantial evidence because
what is required by the court is the determination of
veracity and credibility of a witness and not the numbers
and relationship. It is the quality and not the quantity of the
evidence which matters for the Court in criminal
dispensation of justice. By virtue of Article 17 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, in financial matters, two
male or one male and two female witnesses, have been
made the requirement of law to prove the financial
obligations, whereas, in all other matters including
criminal, there is no such obligation, which clearly
suggests that a single witness is sufficient to prove a fact.
Wisdom may be derived from Zar Badadar’s case (1978
SCMR_ 136), case titled, “Muhammad Ahmad_ and
another Vs the State and others”(1997 SCMR 839), case
titled, Muhammad Mansha Vs the State” (2001 SCMR

199), case titled, “Dildar Hussain Vs Muhammad

Afzaal alias Chala and 3 others” (PLD 2004 Supreme
11

Court 663), case titled, “Farooq Khan Vs the State”
(2008 SCMR 917).

12. For what has been discussed above, we have
reached to irresistible conclusion that prosecution has
successfully proved that appellant has committed murder
of the deceased Sartaj on the day, date time and place with
a 30 bore pistol as alleged by the prosecution and
substantiated through cogent and confidence inspiring
ocular evidence, supported by medical evidence and
corroborated by strong circumstantial pieces of evidence.
In this view of the matter, the learned trial Court has
rightly held him guilty of the offence, to which no
exception can be taken.

13. So far as the quantum of sentence awarded by the
learned trial Court to the appellant is concerned, on
thorough scrutiny of the evidence, we are of the considered
view that the motive advanced by the prosecution does not
seems true. In fact something happened prior to the
occurrence which has been kept concealed by the
complainant party, most particularly, family honour and
modesty. It transpired from the prosecution evidence that
the deceased was permanent resident of Kheshgi Payan and
a few months prior to the occurrence he has shifted his
abode to Karachi, whereas, two days prior to the
occurrence he along with his wife, namely, Mst. Muskan

had come to the house of his sister i.e. (mother of PW
12

Qasim, Ali). Record depicts that deceased had not willfully
abandoned his residence from village Kheshgi, rather he
was forcibly expelled by the elders of the locality from the
village. In such an undisclosed situation, wisdom may be
derived from judgment of the august apex Court rendered
in case titled, “Ghulam Muhammad and another vs the
State” (2017 SCMR 2048), wherein it has been held that:-
“It is well settled by now that once the
prosecution alleges _a_ motive and _ fails to
prove the same during the trial, the same can

be taken as a mitigating circumstance while

deciding the quantum of sentence of the

convict. Therefore, Criminal Appeal No.73-L of

2009 is partly allowed and the sentence of death

awarded to Wazir Ali appellant is altered to

imprisonment for life”. (emphasis supplied).
Similar view has been taken by the Hon’ble apex Court in
case titled, “Haq Nawaz vs the State” (2018 SCMR 21
while placing reliance on the judgment rendered in cases of

Ahmad Nawaz vs the State (2011 SCMR 593), Iftikhar

Mehmood and another Vs Qaiser Iftikhar and others (2011

SCMR_1165), Muhammad Mumtaz vs the State and

another (2012 SCMR 267), Muhammad Imran @ Asif vs

the State (2013 SCMR 782), Sabir Hussain alias Sabri Vs

the State (2013 SCMR 1554), Zeeshan Afzal alias Shani

and another Vs the State and another (2013 SCMR 1602),

13

Naveed alias Needu and others vs the State and others

(2014 SCMR_ 1464), Muhammad Nadeem Wagas_and

another vs the State (2014 SCMR 1658), Muhammad Asif

vs Muhammad Akhtar and others (2016 SCMR 2035) and

Qaddan_ and others vs the State (2017 SCMR 148). The
relevant parts i.e. Para No.3 and 4 of the judgment (supra)
are reproduced below:-

“After hearing the learned counsel for the parties
and going through the record we have observed
that the High Court had categorically concluded
that the motive set up by the prosecution had not
been proved by it. The law is settled by now
that if the prosecution asserts a motive but
fails to prove the same then such failure on
the part of the prosecution may react against
a_sentence of death passed against _a convict

4. For what has been discussed above this
appeal is dismissed to the extent of appellant’s
conviction for the offence under section 302 (b)
PPC, but the same is partly allowed to the extent

of his sentence of death on the charge of murder

which sentence is reduced to imprisonment

for life.”(emphasis supplied).

14. Deriving wisdom from the judgments (supra) of
the august apex Court and placing reliance thereupon, we
while maintaining conviction of appellant/convict under
section 302(b) PPC, reduce his sentence from death_to
imprisonment for life. However, his sentence to the extent

of compensation and period of imprisonment in default of
14

payment thereof, shall remain intact along with benefit of
section 382-B Cr.P.C.

15. With the above modification in the sentence of the
convict Dilawar son of Baghi Gul, his appeal is disposed
of accordingly, whereas, Murder Reference No.15 of
2018, sent by the learned trial Court is answered in the

negative.
