JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTL, J.- This appeal

is directed against the judgment dated 31.03.2012, rendered

by learned Additional Sessions Judge-II, Charsadda,

whereby she convicted and _ sentenced appellant

Muhammad Karim under section 302( b) PPC to undergo

life imprisonment and to pay _ Rs.3,00,000/- as

compensation to LRs of the deceased in terms of $.544-A

Cr.P.C. or in default thereof to undergo 06 months S.I.

further. Benefit of $.382-B Cr.P.C. has been extended to

him.

2. The prosecution case as unfolded in First

Information Report Exh.PA is that on 26.11.2010 at 02.15

hours, Abdul Ghafar deceased then injured reported to local

police in Charsadda hospital, that on the fateful night, at

1.20 a.m., the moment he came out from his house, situated

in village Kala Dhand Payan, Muhammad Karim

(appellant-convict herein), already ambushed there, opened

fire at him, as a result he got hit on left side of his abdomen.

Motive behind the occurrence as disclosed by him is that

the appellant was ejected from a house by landlord, for

which he was suspecting him. Report of injured was

recorded in the shape of murasila Exh.PA/1 by Munir Khan

ASI, on the basis of which FIR No.582 dated 26.11.2010

under section 302 PPC at Police Station Umarzai was

registered against the appellant. He prepared injury sheet of

the injured Exh.PW.1/1 and referred him for medical

examination.

3. Dr. Iraq Shah DHQ hospital Charsadda (PW.6),

examined the deceased then injured on 26.11.2010 at 02.15

hours and observed as under:-

Fully conscious well oriented in time and date.

1. Firearm entry wound on the left lower abdomen
measuring 1.5 x 1 cm.

2. Exit left side lower posterior abdomen measuring
1.5 x 2.5 cm.

He was referred to LRH, Peshawar for

specialized treatment and surgeon opinion.

Injured Abdul Ghafar, later on, succumbed to the injures in

LRH Peshawar, wherefrom his dead body was shifted to

DHQ hospital Charsadda for post mortem examination.

Munir Khan ASI (PW.1), prepared inquest report of the

deceased Exh.PW.1/3.

On 26.11.2010 at 04.30 a.m. he also conducted

autopsy on the dead body of deceased Abdul Ghaffar and

found the same injuries as observed by him at the time of

initial examination of the deceased who was then in injured

condition.

Opinion: According to his opinion the deceased died due to

firearm injuries, internal sever bleeding followed by shock.

4. Hazrat Ullah Khan SI (PW.9) proceeded to the

spot and prepared site plan Exh.PB on the pointation of

Abdul Sattar. During spot inspection he recovered and took

into possession a 30 bore empty shell Exh.P.1, vide

recovery memo Exh.PW.5/1. Vide recovery memo

Exh.PW.5/2, he took into possession the last worn

bloodstained garments of the deceased and sealed the same

in parcel, recorded the statements of PWs under section 161

Cr.P.C., sent the bloodstained garments of the deceased to

the FSL report whereof is Exh.PZ while report in respect of

the empty is Exh.PZ/1. After arrest of the accused/appellant

on 27.11.2010, he obtained his physical custody,

interrogated him and recorded his statement under section

161 Cr.P.C. On completion of investigation, he handed over

the case file to SHO, who submitted challan against the

accused/appellant.

5. On receipt of challan by the learned Trial Court,

accused/appellant was summoned and formally charge

sheeted to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To

prove its case, prosecution examined as many as eleven

witnesses. After closure of the prosecution evidence,

statement of the appellant was recorded under section 342

Cr.P.C., wherein he denied the prosecution allegations and

professed his innocence. He, however, declined to be

examined on oath or to produce evidence in defence. On

conclusion of trial, learned Trial Court, after hearing both

the sides, convicted and sentenced the appellant, as

mentioned above, hence, this appeal.

6. The main thrust of arguments of learned

counsel for the appellant was that the learned Trial Court

while considering the report of the deceased then injured as

a dying declaration, blindly relied on the same, squarely

over sighting the crucial aspect of identification in the dark

hours of the night. He contended that no source of light in

which he identified the appellant has been disclosed by the

deceased then injured in his report nor any such source has

been observed by the I.O. on the spot nor taken into

possession during spot inspection, therefore, the

identification of the assailant being highly doubtful, the

learned Trial Court erred in law while recording the

conviction, on surmises and conjectures, therefore, the

impugned judgment is liable to be reversed.

7. Conversely, learned AAG while supporting the

impugned judgment sought dismissal of the appeal.

8. We have heard the respective submissions

advanced from both the sides and perused the record

carefully.

9. It appears from the impugned judgment that the

learned Trial Court has recorded the conviction and

sentence of the appellant on the sole dying declaration of

deceased then injured. We do agree with the learned Trial

Court that sanctity is attached to the dying declaration

because a dying man is not expected to tell lies, but being

weak kind of evidence it required close scrutiny and

corroboration. While dealing with the question of dying

declaration the Court has to judge it from certain points.

Some of the main tests for determining the genuineness of

the dying declaration are:-

* Whether the maker had the physical capacity to
make the dying statement.

*, Whether the maker had_ opportunity to
recognize the assailant/ assailants.

*, Whether there were chances for mistake on

the part of dying man in identifying and
naming the  assailant/ assailants.

*, Whether it was free from prompting from any
outside quarter ; and

* Whether the witness who heard the deceased
making his statement, heard him correctly and

whether their evidence can be relied upon.

Hence, in order to pass the test of reliability, a dying

declaration has to be subjected to a very close scrutiny,

keeping in view the fact that the statement has been made in

the absence of the accused, who had no opportunity of

testing the veracity of the statement by cross-examination.

Admittedly, if once the Court comes to the conclusion that

the dying declaration was the truthful version as to the

circumstances of the death and the assailant of the victim,

there is no question of further corroboration.

10. It appears from the record that incident took

place in the month of October 2010 at odd hours of the

night at 1.20 a.m. In light of statement of Dr. Iraq Shah,

who examined the deceased then injured at first instance

and Munir Khan ASI (PW.1) who recorded his report, we

entertain no amount of doubt about capability of the

deceased then injured to talk and about his consciousness.

The only disturbing question is that whether the deceased

then injured was in a position to identify the assailant at the

time of incident? A look at the report of the deceased

then injured reveals that he has not uttered a single word

about the any source of light whether electric or natural

(moon light), in which he identified the appellant.

Similarly, in the site plan Exh.PB nowhere around the

crime venue any source of light has been shown or taken

into possession by the I.O. during spot inspection. Had

there been any source of light, the IO. would have

definitely mentioned the same in the site plan or the

deceased then injured would have specifically disclosed the

same in his dying declaration. In the site plan deceased then

injured has been shown at Point No.1 and the appellant as

Point No.2, at a distance of 15 paces, which is a

considerable distance and in absence of any source of light,

identification of the assailant from such a distance, is next

to impossible. Besides, it does not appeal to our mind that

an assailant who selects the odd hours of the night, would

commit any stupidity to disclose his identity before his

target. The learned trial Court while stating the points of

test for determination of a dying declaration at S. No.(d) has

specifically mentioned one of the essential points that

“whether there is any doubt about the identity of the

accused”, but squarely ignored the same in light of the

10

peculiar facts and circumstances of the case discussed

above. The learned Trial Court has not furnished any

reason, much less plausible, in support of point of

identification, rather has given much stress on the physical

condition of the deceased then injured that he was capable

to talk, in light of statement of the doctor and author of his

report. We do not find any piece of evidence, much less

solid and convincing to remove our serious reservations

about identification of the appellant by the deceased then

injured in the dark hours of the night.

11. For the reasons discussed above, we are firm

in our view that though deceased then injured was in a

position to talk, but not in a position to identify the

assailant. Thus, if identification of the assailant is excluded

from consideration, the whole edifice of the prosecution

case shall crumble to the ground. No other direct evidence

is available with the prosecution. Mere recovery of blood

from the spot, bloodstained garments of the deceased

11

coupled with the report of Serologist and autopsy report,

being corroborative pieces of evidence, would not be

sufficient to bring home the guilt of the appellant. The

identification of the appellant being highly doubtful, cast

serious doubts in the prosecution case, benefit of which

would be extended to the appellant not as a matter of grace

or concession but as a matter of right. The rule of benefit of

doubt is essentially a rule of prudence, which cannot be

ignored while dispensing justice in accordance with law.

Conviction must be based on unimpeachable evidence and

certainty of guilt and any doubt arising in the prosecution

case, must be resolved in favour of the accused. The said

“c

rule is based on the maxim “ it is better that ten guilty
persons be acquitted rather than one innocent person be
convicted” which occupied a pivotal place in the Islamic
Law and is enforced strictly in view of the saying of the

Holy Prophet (PBUH) that the “mistake of Qazi (Judge) in

releasing a criminal is better than his mistake in punishing

12

an innocent”. Wisdom in this regard can also be derived

from the judgments of the apex court in case titled,

”*Muhammad Khan and another Vs the State” (1999

SCMR 1220) and case titled, “Muhammad Ikram Vs the

State” (2009 SCMR 230). The learned trial Court has not

evaluated the dying declaration of the deceased then injured

in its true perspective and thus reached to an erroneous

conclusion by holding the appellant guilty of the offence.

12. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed. Conviction

and sentence of the appellant recorded and awarded by the

learned Trial Court vide impugned judgment dated

31.03.2012, are set aside and he is acquitted of the charges

leveled against him. He be set at liberty forthwith, if not

required in any other case.

These are reasons of our short order of even date.
