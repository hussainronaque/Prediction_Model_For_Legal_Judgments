Date of hearing 16.11.2022.
Petitioner/s (Rizwan Saeed Mughal) by
M/s. Shahayar Tarig and Taimur Khan,
Advocates.

Respondent/s (Appellate Election
Tribunals & another) by Sardar Ali

Raza, AAG and nemo for respondent No.
3.

FAZAL SUBHAN, J. Through this
petition filed under Article 199 of the
Constitution of Islamic Republic of
Pakistan, 1973, the petitioner Rizwan
Saeed Mughal, has invoked the jurisdiction
of this Court with the following prayer: -

“That on acceptance of

instant writ petition, — the

orders impugned be declared

void, without jurisdiction,

unlawful and of no legal effect

any other relief which this

Hon’ble Court deem fit and

proper may also be granted to
the petitioner in the best
interest of justice”.
2. Brief but relevant facts of the instant
writ petition are that petitioner alongwith
other candidates filed their respective
nomination papers to contest the election
on the seat of Chairman Tehsil Council,
Ghazi. That respondent No. 3 (Mohammad
Qasim Shah) also filed his nomination
papers for the above seat. That at the time
of filing nomination papers by respondent
No.3, petitioner raised objections and also
filed application for rejection of
nomination papers disqualification of
respondent No. 3 to contest the election on
the ground of his dual nationality,
however, the application was dismissed by
respondent No. 1. Likewise, his appeal
preferred against the decision of Returning
Officer was also declined by learned
Appellate Tribunal, hence, he presented

this writ petition.
3. | Arguments of learned counsel for the
petitioner and learned AAG heard and
record perused.

4. It is the contention petitioner that as
per Local Government Act, 2013 as well as
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Local Council
(Conduct of Elections) Rules, 2021,
respondent No. 3 having dual nationality
holder is not qualified to contest the
election of local government, but despite
that his nomination papers were accepted
by Returning Officer, however, learned
counsel for petitioner failed to point out
specifically that what provision or rule bars
the respondent No.3 from contesting the
election of local government as no such
provision is provided in the ibid Act/Rules.
5. For considering the assertions of the
petitioner, which is based on the question
of dual nationality of the petitioner, we are
of the considered view that the relevant
laws governing the Conduct of election to

the local government is the Local
Government Act, 2013 (Act), and The
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Local Councils
(Conduct of Election) Rules, 2014 (Rules).
By virtue of section 78 of the Act, criteria
has been set forth for a person to be a
candidate and elected as member to the
local council, which includes District
Council, Tehsil Council, Town Council,
Village or neighborhood Council, as the
case may be, as defined in section 2(m) of
the Act. The question involved in the
matter in hand only relates to the dual
nationality, therefore, section 78(a) of the
Act is relevant, which is reproduced below
for convenience: -

Qualifications for candidates and
elected members-- (1) A person shall
qualify to be elected or to hold an
elective office or membership of a
local council, if he-

(a) is a citizen of Pakistan;

6. The said provision not only speak of
qualification of a person to be eligible and

competent to be a candidate but at the same
time, any person, not having the said
qualification, is rendered disqualified to be
candidate or elective member of local
council.

7. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Local
Council (Conduct of Election) Rules,
2014, in rule 55 also provide grounds of
declaring election of returned candidate to

be void in the following conditions: -

Grounds of declaring election of returned
candidate void.---(1)_ The Tribunal shall
declare the election of the returned candidate
to be void if it is satisfied that-

(a) the nomination of the returned candidate
was invalid; or

(b) the returned candidate was not, on the
nomination day, qualified for, or was
disqualified from, being elected as a
member; or

(c) the election of the returned candidate has
been procured or induced by any corrupt
or illegal practice; or

(d) a corrupt or illegal practice has been
committed by the returned candidate or his
election agent or by any other person with
the connivance of the candidate or his
authorized agent.

(2) The election of a returned candidate
shall not be declared void on the ground-

(a) that any corrupt or illegal practice has
been committed, if the Tribunal is satisfied
that it was not committed by or with the
consent or connivance of that candidate or
his election agent and that the candidate
and the election agent took all reasonable
precautions to prevent its commission; or

(b) that any of the other contesting candidates
was, on the nomination day, not qualified
for or was disqualified from, being elected
as a member.
8. Rule 55 (b) of the Rules provides a
method and mechanism, that even if a
candidate already returned to a local
council on the day of nomination was
proved to be not qualified of being elected
as a member, his election may be declared
void.

9. While arguing before us, learned
counsel for petitioner consistently made
reference to Art 63 of the Constitution,
with special reference to clause (1) (c)
thereof, and submitted that in view of said
clause in respect of disqualification would
apply to the case of respondent No. 3, but
we are not convinced with the above
assertion, for the reason that Article 63 of
the Constitution mainly relates to the
disqualification of membership of Majlis-
e-Shoora (Parliament), while on the other
hand, the qualification or for that matter,
the disqualification to be derived
therefrom, to the candidates of local

council, is characterized in section 78 of
the ibid Rules. As opposite to the said
Rule, Rule 78-A, has prescribed the
grounds for disqualification of member but
it nowhere has provided disqualification of
a member on the ground of dual
nationality. Thus, the provision in respect
of disqualification described for a member
of parliament cannot be imported to
candidate or elected member of the local
council. In this respect guidance is derived
from the case of Zahid Iqbal-Vs-Hafiz
Muhammad Adnan reported in 2016
SCMR, 430, wherein, it was held that: -

“Tt is neither the duty nor the
function of the Court to read
into or delete any word and
or provisions in an
enactment, unless specifically
adopted or imported by
reference. Courts do not
legislate but interpret statute
according to their ordinary
and plain meaning and do not
import and or supply word or
provisions from "any other
law", no matter how laudable

and desirable it may appear
to be. In this view of the
matter, disqualification
prescribed under "any law"
or even in "The Constitution"
unless as noted above are
specifically made applicable
or adopted by reference,
specially penal and or
castigatory provisions
contained in "any law"
cannot be imported, read into
or inflicted on a person who
put forth his candidature to
be elected as a Member or to
hold an elected office of
Punjab Local Government
but his qualification and or
disqualification for any office
of the Punjab Local
Government is to be
adjudged strictly under the
provisions of "the Act, 2013"
only.”

10. When similar matter came up before
this Court in the case of Malik Muhammad
Nawaz-Vs-Government of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa and others, in WP. No. 287-
A/2022, it was held therein that: -

Without prejudice to above stated

reasons, Section 231 of the
Election Act, could not be pressed
into service as same was specific
in its import and aimed at
providing qualifications — and
disqualifications for members of
Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) or
Provincial Assembly. Same was
not a provision related to Local
Bodies Election. Election Act, on
the other hand, has provided a
specific provision i.e. sub-Section
(2) of Section 229 of the Act,
wherein it is specifically mentioned
that qualifications and
disqualifications of a candidate in
Local Government Elections or a
member of Local Government
would be decided under the
applicable Local Government Law.
The applicable law in the case in
hand is Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
Local Government Act, 2013,
particularly, its Section 78.

11. In view of the above discussion, we
hold that provision of Article 63 of the
Constitution cannot be imported to the
Local Government Act, 2013 as amended
up to date. The Act does not provide any
provision for disqualification of a person

having or acquiring dual nationality,
10

therefore, respondent No. 3 cannot be
disqualified on this score. Resultantly, this
writ petition being devoid of any merits, is
dismissed.
