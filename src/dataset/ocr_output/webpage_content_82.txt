the dead bodies were taken to their village where relatives of complainant
party also came there. After sun set time both the deceased were buried. The

                     Before approaching this
court, the applicant/accused had filed bail application before the learned
trial court but the same was dismissed vide order dated 25.6.2008.
                      Mr. Aziz-ur-Rehman
Akhund learned counsel for the applicant states that:
(1)   applicant is
shown to have armed with K.K but no empty was recovered from the spot, which
shows that applicant was not present on pot and had not participated in the
commission of offence.
(2)   From the
contents of FIR it has been added by complainant that he had lodged FIR after
consultation with his relatives therefoe false implication of applicant/accused
is not ruled out.
(3)   There is
general allegation of participation of the accused/applicant and no injury by
use of fire arm has been attributed to the applicant/accused.
 
He has drawn my attention my attention towards copy of counter 
FIR No.74/2008
lodged by accused party at P.S Mehrabpur in respect of the same incident having
been lodged at 1900 hours on 14.4.2008 in the said FIR it has been alleged that
deceased Irshad and Manzoor Hussain were killed by Allah Wassayo (Complainant
of this FIR) with his rifle. As per learned advocate it is yet to be determined
by the trial court that both deceased died due to fire arm injuries caused by
accused party or the complainant party himself. He has relied upon the
following case law:-
1)      2001
YLR 2584.
2)      2001
YLR 2595.
3)      2006
P.Cr.L.J 629.
 
                 Learned AAG has opposed the bail plea saying that
name of the applicant/accused appears in the FIR and the role of firing
assigned to him.  His presence on spot
has been established. This is a double murder case and applicant/accused was a
member of unlawful assembly.
