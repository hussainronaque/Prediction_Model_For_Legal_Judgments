JUDGMENT

SYED ARSHAD ALL J.- Durre Shehwar, the petitioner is
facing trial before the learned Accountability Court-I,
Peshawar in a Reference No. 04/2017 wherein she is accused
of corrupt and corrupt practices.

Through the instant petition, the petitioner has
called into question the Authority of Director General NAB to
grant pardon to the alleged accomplice and subsequently the
order of the learned Accountability Court-I Peshawar dated
27.03.2021 whereby her objection on the depositions of two
witnesses i.e. PW-16 Tabbasum & PW-17 Shazia Bano, who
were granted pardon by the DG NAB, was dismissed.

2. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioner has argued that in National Accountability
Ordinance, 1999 (“Ordinance”), the Chairman of the National
Accountability Bureau (“Bureau”) exercises certain statutory
functions under the Ordinance, some of his authority is

person/office specific i.e. to say that the said authority has to
be exercised by himself whereas in certain cases while
exercising he can delegate his authority keeping in view the
tenure of the section allowing him to delegate the said
authority. In this regard, he has referred to certain powers of
Chairman NAB like the power to freeze property under
Section 12 of the Ordinance; to apply to the Court for transfer
of the case under Section 16-A of the Ordinance; to grant
pardon under Section 26 of the Ordinance; and issuing
direction for filing of appeal under Section 32 of the
Ordinance are his exclusively powers which he cannot
delegate as the said provision of law do not authorize him to
delegate the said powers to any other officer of the Bureau.
However, certain provisions of Ordinance do authorize the
Chairman to delegate these powers to any officer of the NAB.
In this regard, he has referred to Section 18(c) of the
Ordinance which clearly envisages that these powers can be
exercised by the Chairman NAB or an officer of the NAB duly
authorized by him. He next contended that Section 34-A of the
Ordinance authorizing the Chairman NAB, to delegate his
powers, is applicable to only those provisions of the
Ordinance where it is expressly provided that the Chairman
NAB can delegate his powers to an officer of the NAB and
thus, the provision of Section 34-A cannot be stretched to an
extent authorizing the Chairman NAB to delegate his powers
to an officer of the NAB when it is not provided in the Section
empowering the Chairman NAB to do a particular function,
therefore, granting pardon to PW-16 and PW-17 by _ the
Director General NAB is contrary to the scheme of the
Ordinance. The learned counsel, in support of his arguments,

has placed reliance on the judgment of the Apex Court in the
case of Muhammad Rafiq"

T
2019 SCMR 846
3. On the other hand, the learned ADPG
representing the NAB while rebutting the arguments of
learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that under
Section 34-A of the Ordinance, the competent authority has
issued a Notification dated 30.10.2015 whereby the Chairman
NAB has delegated certain statutory powers to various officers
mentioned in the said Notification to be performed by them
and the pardon granted by the Director General NAB is in
accordance with the said Notification, therefore, the impugned

order of the learned Accountability Court is in accordance

with law.
4. Arguments heard and record perused.
5. National Accountability Bureau (“NAB”) has

been established under Section 6 of the Ordinance. Similarly,
the appointment, tenure and terms & conditions of the
Chairman NAB have been provided under Section 6 of the
Ordinance. Section 6(b) (iv) of the Ordinance envisages that
the Chairman NAB may delegate any of his powers to, and
authorize performance of any of his functions by, any officer
of the NAB as he may deem fit and proper, for carrying out
the purposes of the Ordinance. For ease reference, Section
6(b) (iv) of the Ordinance is reproduced as under:-

“6. National Accountability Bureau:-

(A) oe cee cee ten cee tte tence

(b) Chairman National Accountability Bureau:

(iv) — The Chairman, NAB may delegate any of his
powers to, and authorize performance of any of his
functions by, an officer of the NAB as he may deem
fit and proper, subject to such conditions, if any, as

may be specified in the order, for carrying out the
purposes of this Ordinance”.

Similarly, Section 34-A of the Ordinance,
authorizes the Chairman NAB to delegate his authority to any
office of the NAB. The said Section reads as under:-
“34-A, Delegation of Powers.- The Chairman NAB
may, by an order in writing, delegate any of his
powers to and authorize performance of any of his
functions by, an office of the NAB as he may deem
fit and proper, subject to such conditions, if any, as
may be specified in the order, for carrying out the
purposes of this Ordinance”.

6. The Chairman being head of the Bureau has been
cloathed with certain powers under the Ordinance in respect of
investigation, filing of the Reference and other matter
ancillary for the purpose of inquiry and investigation. Certain
provisions of the Ordinance, as mentioned above, it is
specifically mentioned that these powers are to be exercised
by the Chairman NAB or an officer authorized by the NAB
whereas in certain provisions it is only mentioned that the said
powers are to be exercised by the Chairman NAB. For ease
reference let us refer to the relevant provisions:

12. Power to freeze property:- (a) The Chairman
NAB or the Court trying [an accused] for any
offence as specified under this Ordinance, may at
any time, if there appear reasonable grounds for
believing that the accused has committed such an
offence, order the freezing of his property, or part
thereof, whether in his possession or in the
possession of any relative, associate or person on
his behalf:

18. Cognizance of offences: (a) The Court
shall not take cognizance of any offence under this
Ordinance except on a reference made by [the
Chairman NAB or an officer of the NAB duly

authorized by him].
Cc. Where the Chairman NAB, or an officer of

the NAB duly authorized by him is of the opinion
that it is or may be necessary and appropriate to
initiate proceedings against any person he shall
refer the matter for inquiry or investigation.”

19. Power to call for information: The Chairman
NAB or [an officer of the NAB duly authorised by
him] may, during the course of an inquiry [or
investigation] [of an offence under _ this
Ordinance] :-

(a) call for information from any person for the
purpose of satisfying himself whether there has
been any contravention of the provisions of this
Ordinance or any rule or order made thereunder.
24, Arrest:- (a) The Chairman NAB shall have the
power, at any stage of the inquiry and investigation
under this Ordinance, to direct that the accused, if
not already arrested, shall be arrested.

26. Tender of a pardon:- (a) Notwithstanding
anything contained in the Code, at any stage of
[inquiry, investigation or trial] the Chairman NAB
may, with a view to obtaining the evidence of any
person supposed to have been directly or indirectly
concerned in or privy to any offence, tender a full
or conditional pardon to such a person on condition
of his making a full and true disclosure of the whole
of the circumstances within his knowledge relating
to the said offence including the names of the
persons involved therein whether as principals or
abettors or otherwise.

32. Appeal and revision:- (a) Any [person
convicted or the Prosecutor General Accountability,
if so directed by the Chairman NAB] aggrieved by
the final judgment and Order of the Court under
this Ordinance may, within ten days of the final
judgment and order of the Court prefer an appeal to
the High Court of the Province where the Court is
situated;

[Provided that no appeal shall lie against
any interlocutory order of the Court]
(b) All Appeals against the final Judgment and
Order filed before the High Court will be heard by
a Bench of not less than two Judges constituted by
the Chief Justice of the High Court shall be finally
disposed of within thirty days of the filing of the
Appeal.
[() No_ revision shall lie against any
interlocutory order of the Court.]

7. It is the main emphasis of the learned counsel for
the petitioner that the law-makers have intentionally drawn a
distinction between the powers to be exercised by the
Chairman NAB himself whereas certain powers can be
delegated by him only when in a particular section it has been
specifically provided for example Section 18, which envisages
that a Reference can be filed before the Court by the Chairman
NAB or an officer authorized by him. Whereas the power of
Chairman NAB to grant pardon under Section 26 of the

Ordinance cannot be delegated to any other officer of the
NAB as it is established principle of law that a delegatee
cannot some delegate his powers. We do not find ourselves in
consonance with the assertions of the learned counsel for the
petitioner for the obvious reason that it is clearly envisaged
under Sections 6(b) (iv)/34-A of the Ordinance that the
Chairman NAB can delegate his authority/power to any
officer of the NAB. The said delegation has been notified
through Notification dated 30.10.2015, according to the said
Notification, power under Section 26 to tender pardon has
been delegated to DG Operations NAB HQ and DGs Regional
NAB with certain conditions. The said paragraph reads as
under:-

the extent indicated below for carrying out the purposes of the

nN

If we accept the arguments of learned counsel for the
petitioner to read Section 26 of the Ordinance in isolation
without any recourse to the internal aid provided in Section
6(b) (iv) and 34-A of the Ordinance, it would render the said
provision redundant.

8. The history of the National Accountability
Bureau Ordinance and amendment would show that in the
original Statute, the Chairman NAB was not authorized to
delegate his power/authority, however, under Section 6 (b)
(iv) and Section 34-A were added through Ordinance
No. XXIV of 2000 and Ordinance No. XXXV of
2001respectively, whereby the Chairman was authorized to
delegate his authority to other officer of NAB. It is further
established principle of law that even in one Statute the
subsequent amendment being later in time would be given
preference over the original text in the Act. Therefore, the
powers to delegate which were introduced subsequently under
Section 6(b) (iv) and Section 34-A of the Ordinance would be

given full meaning being the golden rule of interpretation.

Therefore, the combined reading of Sections 6 (b) (iv), 26 and
34-A of the Ordinance would show that the Chairman NAB
has the authority to delegate the power of granting pardon to
the Director General NAB which has been done through
Notification (SRO) dated 30.10.2015 . It would be pertinent to
note that the legality of this SRO has not been challenged
before this Court.
9. It is trite law that a statute is passed as whole and
not in sections and it may well be assumed to be animated by
one general purpose and intent. It is thus not safe to adopt the
process of etymological dissection and after taking words out
of their context and applying definitions given by
lexicographers to proceed to construe the statute on the basis
of such definitions. Parliamentary enactments must be
construed as a whole and their meaning attributed to the words
should, as general rule be inspired by the context and the
nature and object of the subject matter, for the words may be
enlarged or restricted to harmonize with the provisions of
statute’.

Similarly, M. Farani in his Interpretation of
Statutes has stated that a statute must be read as a whole; the
conventional method of ascertaining the intention of the
legislature after reading the statute as a whole in more likely to
lead to discovery of its true intent and is always a safer rule to
follow. A statute must be read as a whole and all parts made
consistent with one another if possible, each portion throwing
light, if need be, on the rest. Whenever it is possible to do so,
it is the duty of the court to construe provisions which appear
to conflict so that they harmonise, it is legitimate and even

necessary to adopt the rule of liberal construction so as to give

2
N.S. Bindra, The Interpretation of Statutes and G.C Act, 4th edn, p-33
meaning to all parts of the provision and to make the whole of
it effective and operative’.

In order to discover the intention of the
Legislature the enactment should be read as a whole. This
general rule of construction is applicable to all statutes alike, is
spoken of as construction ex vis-ceribus actus, i.e. within the
four corners of the Act. This rule of construction has
frequently been recognized and acted upon by courts of law

from Coke’s time down to the present day. It has been said*:

“The key to the opening of every law is the reason
and spirit of the law, it is the animus imponents, the
intention of the law-maker expressed in the law
itself, taken as a whole. Hence to arrive at the true
meaning of the particular phrase in a statute, the
particular phrase is not to be viewed detached from
viewed in its context in the statute; it is to be viewed
in connection with its whole context, meaning by this
as well the title and preamble and the purview or
enacting part of the statute”.

10. On harmonious interpretation of different
provision of Statutes and to avoid redundancy of one provision

of law by another provision, the Indian Supreme Court in the

case of Sultana Begum vs. Prem Chand Jain_ (AIR 1997
Supreme Court 1006) has laid the following rules:-

“On a conspectus of the case law indicated above,

the following principles are clearly discernible:

(1) It is the duty of the Courts to avoid a head on
clash between two Sections of the Act and to
construe the provisions which appear to be in
conflict with each other in such a manner as to
harmonise them.

(2) The provisions of one Section of a statute cannot
be used to defeat the other provisions unless the
Court, in spite of its efforts, finds it impossible
to effect reconciliation between them.

(3) It has to be borne in mind by all the Courts all
the time that when there are two conflicting
provisions in an Act, which cannot be
reconciled with each other, they should be so
interpreted that, is possible, effect should be
given to both. This is the essence of the rule of
“harmonious construction”.

3
M. Farani, The Interpretation of statutes, chapter 4, p-54

Craies, Statute Law, p-98
10

(4) The Courts have also to keep in mind that an
interpretation which reduces one of the
provisions as a “dead letter” or “useless
lumber” is not harmonious construction.

(5) To harmonise is not to destroy any statutory
provision or to render it otiose”’.

Thus, the assertions of the learned counsel for the
petitioner that Section 26 of the Ordinance would be read in
isolation and not in juxtaposition with Section 34-A of the

Ordinance are without any legal force.

11. Moving on to the judgment of the Apex Court in
Muhammad Rafig’s case_ (supra). The Apex Court in Para-10
of the said judgment has discussed the impact of Section 18(g)
as well as Section 32 of the Ordinance. The issue before the
Apex Court was that the authority to file a reference by an
officer other than Chairman NAB and appeal under Section 32
of the Ordinance. A similar SRO was referred by the Apex
Court in the said judgment, which was issued on 13.06.2006,
according to the said SRO and even under the SRO issued on
30.10.2015, the Chairman NAB has never delegated his
powers under Section 32 of the Ordinance to any officer of the
Bureau to direct the filing of appeal, therefore, for filing an
appeal, it is the Chairman NAB himself to direct the
Prosecutor General to file the appeal and in absence of any
delegation no officer can exercise the said authority, therefore,
the judgment of the Apex Court is clearly distinguishable and

does not apply to the present case.

12. In view of the above, we hold that the authority
exercised by the Director General granting pardon to the two

witnesses is intra vires and thus, the impugned order does not
11

call for interference. Resultantly, this petition having no merit,

which is accordingly, dismissed along with Interim Relief.
