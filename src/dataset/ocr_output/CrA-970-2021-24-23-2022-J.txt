to the occurrence, a house situated in Mohallah Majian, owned by

to be paid after delivery of possession. As per version of
complainant, the house was in possession Fazal Qadar alias
Bashy, Fazal Hussain alias Patay (appellants-convicts), Fazal
Karim alias Kaney and Bilal (absconding co-accused), therefore,
whenever he (complainant) demanded delivery of possession of
the house to Iqbal Hussain, the accused would start
braw//altercation with him and he faced the said situation on so
many occasions prior to the occurrence.

On 27.06.2015 complainant Muhammad Iqbal (PW.16)

hence, prosecution was invited to adduce evidence. On

statement to the effect that they rely on the evidence of
prosecution and statements of accused already recorded in by the
learned Anti-Terrorism Court, Peshawar. On conclusion of trial,
the learned trial Court after hearing both the sides, convicted and
sentenced the appellants as mentioned above.

10. | We have heard the exhaustive submissions of learned
counsel for the parties advanced at the bar and perused the record
and evidence with their valuable assistance.

11. It appears from record that this untoward incident has
taken place on 27.06.2015 at 1720 hours in Mohallah Majian
near Ziarat Shah Rasool Baba, Peshawar, which has been
reported by complainant Muhammad Iqbal (PW.16) at 1805
hours, wherein he has directly charged appellants Fazal Qadar

and Fazal Hussain along with absconding co-accused Fazal
12
Cr.A. No.970-P/2021
With M.R. No.2] of 2021

Karim and Bilal for committing murder of his four daughters,
namely, Mst. Rani, Mst. Samreen, Mst. Rugia and Mst. Farhana
deceased and an attempt at his life and the life of his grandson
Ubaid Ali (PW.15) with firearms. According to his report,
besides him, the incident is witnessed by his injured grandson
Ubaid Ali (PW.15). A dispute over possession of the house has
been advanced as a motive behind the occurrence. The
complainant and PW Ubaid Ali have furnished ocular account of
the occurrence.

12. Complainant Muhammad Iqbal while appearing as
PW.16 deposed that prior to the occurrence he had purchased a
house to Iqbal Hussain from one Fida Muhammad in lieu of sale
consideration of rupees forty lacs. He stood surety/middle man in
the said bargain. Out of the total sale consideration, rupees
twenty lacs were paid to Fida Muhammad, owner of the house,
whereas the remaining amount was promised to be paid in three
months and thereafter possession of the house shall be handed
over to Iqbal Hussain. The house was in possession of the
accused and Iqbal Hussain was demanding its possession from
him or to return the amount of rupees twenty lacs already paid by
him. Whenever he (complainant) demanded possession of the
house from the accused they use to start altercation with him. On
the fateful day on his demand of delivery of possession of the
house, the accused started quarreling with him in presence of

Tbrar and Shabbir, who separated them. On the commotion his
13
Cr.A. No.970-P/2021
With M.R. No.21 of 2021

daughters, namely, Mst. Ruqia, Mst. Rani, Mst. Samreen and
Mst. Farhana along with his grandson Ubaid Ali attracted to the
spot for rescuing them from the aggression of the accused, but
the accused opened fire at them, as a result, his daughters and
grandson got hit, who were shifted to the hospital where death of
his daughters was confirmed by the lady doctor. He charged the
appellants and the absconding co-accused for commission of the
offence. He stated that site plan was prepared at his instance by
the 1.0.

13. Injured Ubaid Ali is a child witness aged 13 years.
Before recording his statement, certain questions were put to him
by the learned trial Court, who after giving its rational answers
was examined as PW.15. He deposed that on the fateful day he
along with his father and brothers had visited the house of his
maternal grandfather, namely, Muhammad Iqbal (complainant).
At about 05.00 p.m. an altercation took place between his
maternal grandfather and the accused, on which he along with his
mother Mst. Farhana and maternal aunts, namely, Mst. Samreen,
Rugayia and Rani came out from the house. During altercation
the accused drew their pistols and started firing at them, as a
result, he, his mother and his aunts named above got hit.

14, Both the above-named eyewitnesses, have been subjected
to lengthy and taxing cross-examination, but nothing beneficial to
defence could be extracted from their mouths. Both remained

consistent with each other on the mode and manner of the
Cr.A. No.970-P/2021
With M.R. No.21 of 2021

occurrence and have charged the appellants and absconding co-
accused Fazal Karim and Bilal for commission of the offence. As
per site plan Exh.PB, the occurrence has taken place in a street,
situated in front of house of the complainant. In this view of the
matter, presence of the complainant and PW Ubaid Ali is quite
natural. Besides, Ubaid Ali being injured witness his presence at
the spot cannot be excluded. He being a child witness has
furnished a straightforward ocular account of the occurrence and
has corroborated the testimony of complainant on all material
aspects of the incident. We are mindful of the fact that PW Ubaid
Ali is not merely a witness who has seen the occurrence, but he
has also received firearm injury at the hands of the accused. The
occurrence has been reported by complainant with promptitude
ie. within 45 minutes, eliminating the possibility of consultation
and deliberation on his part in charging the accused. In the
circumstances there is no compelling reason for discarding the
ocular account of above named witnesses or warranting false
implication of the appellants. Even otherwise, no reason exists to
be believed that a father has charged innocent persons for murder
of his four daughters by letting of the real culprits. Similarly, it
also does not appeal to a prudent mind that a child aged 12/13
years, will charge innocent persons for murder of his real mother
and three maternal aunts. Recovery of blood from the places of
four deceased (daughters of the complainant) and that of injured

Ubaid Ali and the last worn bloodstained garments of the
15
Cr.A. No.970-P/2021
With M.R. No.21 of 2021

deceased as well as that of injured coupled with positive
Serologist report Exh.PZ/3 corroborate the ocular account
furnished by complainant and PW Ubaid Ali and prove the place
of occurrence to be the same as alleged by them.

15. Record depicts that appellants were arrested by Riaz Ali
Inspector (PW.11), who recovered a 30 bore pistol No.37000841
with three magazines and bandolier containing eleven live rounds
of the same bore from appellant Fazal Hussain alias Pattay and a
30 bore pistol without number with two chargers and a bandolier
containing 07 live rounds of the same bore from appellant Fazal
Qadar vide recovery memo Exh.PW.10/1 and the pistols and
ammunitions etc are Exh.P.8 and Exh.P.9. In this regard separate
FIR was registered against the appellants. The said pistols being
the weapons of offence in the instant case were taken into
possession by the I.O. through recovery memo. Both the pistols
along with 12 crime empties of 30 bore were sent to the FSL and
as per FSL report Exh.PZ/1 eight crime empties out of the twelve
matches with the crime pistols recovered from the appellants.
The mentioned pieces of circumstantial evidence coupled with
positive FSL report Exh.PZ/1 further corroborates the ocular
account furnished by the eyewitnesses.

16. In his initial report the complainant has stated that some
three months prior to the occurrence a house situated in Mohallah
Majian, owned by one Fida Muhammad (PW.8), was sold out to

one Iqbal Hussain on his assurance and guarantee. Out of the sale
16
Cr.A. No.970-P/2021
With M.R. No.21 of 2021

consideration an amount of rupees twenty lacs was paid by Iqbal
Hussain, whereas, the balance amount was promised to be paid
after delivery of possession of the house. As the house was in
possession appellants Fazal Qadar alias Bashy, Fazal Hussain
alias Patay and Fazal Karim alias Kaney and Bilal (absconding
co-accused), therefore, whenever he would demand delivery of its
possession, the appellants along with absconding co-accused
would started brawl/altercation with him and he (complainant)
faced the said situation on so many occasions prior to the
occurrence. To prove the motive, prosecution has examined
Jameel Ahmad Deed Writer as PW.7. He deposed that on
05.03.2015, he executed a sale deed in between Fida Muhammad
and Iqbal Hussain which is Exh.PW.7/1 and extract of the
relevant register is Exh.PW./7/2. Similarly, Fida Muhammad,
owner of the house, while appearing as PW.8 deposed that he was
owner of the house which he sold out to Iqbal Husain in lieu of
sale consideration of Rs.40,50,000 vide sale deed Exh.PW.7/1.
An amount of rupees twenty lacs was paid to him as down
payment and balance amount was promised to be paid within two
months. Fazal Hussain alias Patay was the middle man in the said
transaction and had received the commission. After expiry of the
stipulated period, possession of the house was returned to him as
the balance amount was not made to him. From the statement of
Jameel Ahmad Deed Writer (PW.8) and Fida Muhammad

(PW.8), the motive alleged by the complainant is proved upto the
17
Cr.A. No.970-P/2021
With M.R. No.2] of 2021

hilt that there was dispute on delivery of possession of a house.
Due to non-payment of the remaining amount the house was
returned to Fida Muhammad. In this view of the matter, the
prosecution has proved motive behind the occurrence through
cogent and confidence inspiring oral and documentary evidence.

17. Medical evidence in the shape of autopsy reports of the
deceased, medico legal report of injured PW Ubaid Ali coupled
with statements of Dr. Samuel Pervaz (PW.9) and statement of
Dr. Yasmeen Orakzai (PW.14), who have examined the injured
and conducted postmortem examination on the dead body of the
deceased, support ocular account of the prosecution’s case. As
per autopsy reports, deceased Mst. Farhana had received five
firearm entrance wounds with corresponding exist on vital parts
of her body. Three firearm entrance wounds with corresponding
exit were noticed on the person of deceased Mst. Rugia.
Similarly, as per autopsy report of deceased Mst. Rani she had
sustained five firearm entrance wounds on various parts of her
body whereas as per postmortem report Mst. Samreen deceased
she had sustained three firearm entrance wounds with
corresponding exist. The unnatural death of all the deceased has
been opined by the Lady doctor due to firearm injures. The
numbers of firearm entrance wounds on the person of each
deceased speak about the brutality of the appellants/accused as to

how they have dealt with the ladies deceased.
18
Cr.A. No.970-P/2021

With MR No.2] of 2021

18. On reappraisal of the prosecution’s evidence we are firm
in our view to hold that complainant Muhammad Iqbal (PW.16),
has proved his presence at the spot at the time of occurrence
through his testimony corroborated by strong circumstantial
evidence and supported by medical evidence as discussed above
as well as motive. The argument of learned counsel for the
appellants that as no firearm injury has been sustained by the
complainant, therefore, he was not present at the scene of
occurrence, is not tenable in light of ratio of judgment of Hon’ble
Supreme Court in case titled, Noor Muhammad Vs the State
and another” (2006 SCMR 1958), wherein identical argument
has been dealt with by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Para No.9
of the judgment which is reproduced below:-

“Relative to the contention that presence of two
eyewitnesses namely Niaz Muhammad and Pervez Khan
is highly doubtful as in spite of indiscriminate firing by
the petitioner and two absconding accused they did not
receive any injury is without any substance. It is not the
first case of its kind wherein some of the persons who
were under attack by the opposite party did not receive
any firearm injury whereas others received one or more
f / than one firearm injuries. There cannot be a
presumption or rule that all the persons who were under
attack from firearms ought to have received injuries and
the mere fact that some of them did not receive injuries
would not make their presence at the place and time of

incident doubtful. This contention is also devoid of force
19
Cr.A. No.970-P/2021
With M.R. No.21 of 2021

and is repelled. In support of the above proposition
judgment in the case of Mehboob Sultan and 02 others

vs the State 2001 SCMR 163 is referred.”

19. As regards injured PW Ubaid Ali, he having stamp of
firearm injury on his person, his presence at the spot cannot be
doubted. When he was examined by the Medical Officer he
noticed him conscious and oriented in time and space. It is settled
law that evidence of the stamped witness must be given due
weightage as his presence on the place of occurrence cannot be
doubted. His statement is generally considered to be very reliable
and it is unlikely that he has spared the actual assailant in order to
falsely implicate someone else. The testimony of
an injured witness has its own relevancy and efficacy as he has
sustained injuries at the time and place of occurrence and this
lends support to his testimony that he was present at the time of
occurrence. Thus, the testimony of an injured witness is accorded
a special status in law. Such awitness comes with a built-in
guarantee of his presence at the scene of the crime and is unlikely
to spare his actual assailant(s) in order to falsely implicate
someone. Convincing evidence is required to discredit an
injured witness. In the instant case as stated earlier the testimony
of injured PW Ubaid Ali is corroborated by strong circumstances
evidence and supported by medical evidence, therefore, the same
is sufficient for recording conviction of the appellants.

20. It is proved from the prosecution evidence that the

occurrence has not taken place at the spur of moment, rather
20

With M.R. No.21 of 2021

there was a controversy between complainant and the accused on
delivery of possession of a house sold by Fida Muhammad to
Iqbal Hussain. The complainant and accused party were middle
men in the bargain. Rupees twenty lacs were paid by Iqbal
Hussain to Fida Muhammad and the remaining sale consideration
was agreed to be paid within three months. The complainant was
demanding delivery of possession of the house for Iqbal Hussain.
It has been categorically mentioned by the complainant in his
initial report that prior to the occurrence whenever he demanded
delivery of possession of the house from the accused, the accused
would start altercation with him, meaning thereby that the
accused had already made up their mid for the occurrence.
Arrival of the accused with deadly arms to the spot and the
numbers of firearm injuries sustained by four deceased daughters
of the complainant prove the intention and premeditation of the
accused. In this view of the matter, there exists no ground to
warrant lesser punishment then the one already awarded by the
learned trial Court to the appellants to which no exception can be
taken except with slight modification in the sentence of fine
imposed upon the appellants under section 324 PPC which
instead of its payment to the complainant and injured Ubaid Ali
shall be deposited by the appellants in favour of the State as fine
under section 324 PPC.

21. The learned trial Court has appreciated the

evidence in its true perspective and has arrived at a right

With M.R. No.21 of 2021

conclusion by holding the appellants guilty of the offence to
which no exception can be taken. Similarly, keeping in view the
peculiar facts and circumstances of the case coupled with the
brutality demonstrated by the appellants, the sentence of death
already awarded by the learned trial Court to the appellants shall
meet the ends of justice.

22. For the reasons discussed above, this appeal stands
dismissed. Murder Reference No.21-P of 2021 sent by the
learned trial Court is answered in the affirmative, resultantly, the

death sentences of the appellants-convict are hereby confirmed.
