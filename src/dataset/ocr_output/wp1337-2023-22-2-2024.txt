JUDGMENT.

ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, _J.- Through this common
judgment, we propose to decide the instant and the

connected Writ Petition No.1338-P_of 2023, both filed

by Amjid Ali IHC (Incharge Police Post Shahab Khel),
the petitioner, against the judgment(s) dated 28.03.2023,
passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge-XVIII,
Peshawar, whereby the petitioner was convicted under
section186 PPC and sentenced to undergo imprisonment till
rising of the court and to pay rupees two hundred as fine.

2. Resume of facts forming the background of instant
writ petitions are that one Taj Gul and Sadiq Ahmad,
filed applications under section 491-A Cr.P.C. before the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-XVIII Peshawar
against SHO Police Station Badh Ber Peshawar and

others for production of Mubasir Khan (brother of the
former) and Hamza Khan (son of the latter), before the
learned ASJ-XVIII, who were allegedly illegally detained
by SHO Police Station Badh Ber Peshawar. The learned
ASJ-XVIII directed Baillif of the court to visit Police
Post Shahab Khel Badh Ber and recover the detenues. In
compliance with the court order (ibid) when Bailif of the
coutt visited the said Police Post, the petitioner who was
serving as IHC there restrained him from inspection of
the Police Post thereby flouting the court order,
consequently, he was served with a notice to file reply as
to why he shall not be proceeded under the law of
contempt. The petitioner filed reply, however, the same
being unsatisfactory, the learned ASJ-XVIII convicted
and sentenced him vide orders dated 28.03.2023, hence,
these writ petitions.

3. Main thrust of arguments of learned counsel for
the petitioner was that subordinate courts lack
jurisdiction to try the offence of contempt of court being
the exclusive domain of the superior courts, therefore,
conviction of the petitioner being coram non judice is
liable to be set aside.

4. The worthy AAG while referring to section 4(3) of
the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003 contended that
learned trial court was within its competence to lay hands
on the matter of contempt which was punishable under

Pakistan Penal Code rather the jurisdiction of High Court
was ousted due to the bar contained in section 4(3) of the
Ordinance ibid.

5. Since question of distinction of jurisdiction of
superior courts and subordinate courts is involved in the
matter, therefore, it would be advantageous to understand
the scheme of contempt law. The definition of term
“Contempt” has been provided under section 3 of the
Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003 which reads as
follows:

“Whoever disobeys or disregards any order,
direction or process of a Court, which he is
legally bound to obey; or commits a willful
breach of a valid undertaking given to a Court;
or does anything which is intended to or tends to
bring the authority of a Court or the
administration of law into disrespect or
disrepute, or to interfere with or obstruct or
interrupt or prejudice the process of law or the
due course of any judicial proceedings, or to
lower the authority of a Court or scandalize a
Judge in relation to, his office, or to disturb the
order or decorum of a Court, is said to commit
"contempt of Court". The contempt is of three
types, namely, the "civil contempt", "criminal

contempt" and "judicial contempt.".
ip fi ip

According to 17 CJS, (a complete statement of entire
American Law is developed by all reported cases).
Contempt has also been defined as a willful disregard or
disobedience of a public authority. In its broad sense, a
contempt is a disregard of, or disobedience of the rules or

orders of a legislative or judicial body or interruption of
va

legislative or judicial body or interruption of its
proceedings by disorderly behavior or insolent language
in its presence or so near thereto or to disturb its
proceedings or to impair the respect due to such body
(Peters vs Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Cm. Pl. 76
NE 2d 412,13 CJ P4 Notes). In its restricted and more
usual sense, the contempt comprehends a despising of an
authority, justice or dignity of a court (Burtrum vs Smith
206 SW 2d, 558, 357, MO 134). It may be civil or
criminal, direct or constructive and maybe defined as a
disobedience to the court by acting in opposition to its
authority, justice and dignity. The phrase “contempt of
court” is generic, embracing within its legal signification,
a variety of different acts. It is regulated by constitution
and statutes but sometime supersede the common law. It
signifies not only a willful disregard or disobedience of
the court orders but such conduct as tends to bring the
authority of a court and its administration of law into
disrepute or in some manner to impede the due
administration of justice.

6. Section 3 of the Contempt of Court Ordinance,
2003 classifies three types of contempt, namely, Civil
Contempt, Criminal Contempt and Judicial Contempt.
While clause (a) (b) & (c) of section 2 of the Ordinance,
2003 provide definition of all the three types of contempt

in the following way:
C

(a) “Civil contempt” means the willful flouting
or disregard of,---
(i) An order, whether interim or
final, a judgment or decree of a
Court;
(ii) A writ or order issued by a
Court in the exercise of its
Constitutional Jurisdiction;
(iii) An undertaking given to,
and recorded by, a Court;
(iv) the process of a Court;

(b) “Criminal contempt” means the doing of any
act with intent to, or having the effect of,
obstructing the administration of justice;

(c) “Judicial contempt” means the canalization
of a Court and includes personalized
criticism of a Judge while holding office;

In general, again according to “CJS 17 Contempt”, apart
from civil and criminal contempt, in some jurisdiction
statutes recognize and preserve the fundamental
distinction between the two in substance but not in the
name. The contempt may be direct or constructive. In
addition to term constructive as an antithesis of direct the
courts and statutes have used such word as indirect. The
direct contempt is one which is committed in the
presence of the court and the indirect are those which are
committed outside the premises of the court, either a civil
or criminal contempt may be direct or indirect. It is
important to note ,that formerly in the court of equity
contempt were classified as ordinary and extra ordinary.
Reference can be made to US vs Anonymous CC2I1F761.
A direct contempt of court has been defined as
contempt committed in the presence of the court while it

is in session. It takes place at the very presence of the
~

¢

judge making all of the elements of the offence matters
within his personal knowledge. It consists of any conduct
which tends to embarrass or obstruct the court in the
administration of justice or tends to bring the
administration of law into disrepute. The acts occurring
in judge’s chamber when the court is not duly constituted
or in session do not constitute contempt under a statute
providing that disorderly contemptuous of insolent
conduct towards a judge while holding a court shall
constitute contempt. A constructive, indirect or
consequential contempt is one committed outside the
court; it is an act done at a distance which tends to
belittle, degrade, obstruct, interrupt or embarrass the
court and the administration of justice. The constructive
contempt in legal definition is not an obstruction but it
must subvert justice where judge has not full personal
knowledge of every element of the contempt and its
demonstration depends on the proof of facts of which the
court would have no judicial notice, the contempt is held
to be indirect. A doubt as to whether contemnor has been
guilty of a direct or indirect contempt should be resolved
in favor of constructive contempt especially where a

criminal contempt is charged.
7. Common definition of criminal contempt is that it
is the conduct that is directed against the dignity or
authority of the court or a judge, acting judicially. It is an
act obstructing the administration of justice which tends
to bring the court of justice into disrepute or disrespect. It
may arise in the cases of a criminal action in special
proceedings or in civil and private litigations.
Distinguishing from civil contempt, in general contempt
of court for which punishment is inflicted for the primary
purpose of vindicating the public authority are
denominated criminal, while those in which enforcement
of civil rights and remedies is the ultimate target of the
punishments are denominated as civil contempt. The line
of demarcation is between the acts constituting civil and
criminal contempt is very indistinct. The confusion in
attempts to classify civil and criminal contempt is due to
the fact that there is contempt in which both elements
appear. Contempt may be neither wholly civil nor
altogether criminal, may partake of the characteristics of
the both. The major factor in determining whether
contempt is civil or criminal is the purpose for which the
power is exercised. Contempt is civil when the
punishment is whole remedial, serves only the purposes
of complainant and is not intended chiefly as a deterrent

to offences against the public. The polar concepts are
“Punitive Vs Remedial”. Whether or not a fine or
imprisonment imposed? is not a distinguishing test.

8. Civil contempt consists in failing to do something
ordered to be done by a court in a civil action for the
benefit of an opposing party therein and is therefore an
offence against the party in whose behalf the violated
order is made, if however, the contempt consists in doing
a forbidden act injurious to the opposite party, the
contempt may be considered criminal. Likewise, refusal
to perform an act, the conduct demonstrated is derogatory
to the authority or dignity of the court. There is no
doctrine of anticipatory contempt.

9. After going through the basic concept and
definitions in the foregoing discussion the relevant
provisions of Constitution and statutes must be
explained. Article 204 of the Constitution confers
powers on the Supreme Court and High Courts of the
Provinces to punish any person who commits contempt
of the court and judges. It is also worth mentioning that
powers of the superior courts are restricted to punish the
contempt of superior courts exclusively but subsection
(2) of section 4 of the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003
also confers powers on the respective High Courts to punish
contempt committed in relation to any court subordinate to it.
Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003, regulates the powers

and procedure of superior courts to punish the
« CF

contempt according to mandate of Article 204 of the
Constitution and jurisdiction of subordinate courts is
excluded. Meaning thereby that the offences covered
under section 3 of the ordinance, 2003, are exclusively
triable by the Superior Courts and jurisdiction of
subordinate courts is excluded. However, under
subsection (3) of section 4 which is a disabling clause,
contempt of the subordinate courts which is punishable
under the Pakistan Penal Code, the High Courts cannot
assume the jurisdiction. It follows that in case of
contempt of subordinate courts which are not punishable
under the provisions of Pakistan Penal Code, it is for the
High Court to try the contemnor. It is also worth
mentioning that the contempt of Court Ordinance is a
special law which prescribes its own mechanism for trial
of contemnors which is not meant for proceedings before
the subordinate courts. Rather for the subordinate courts
the procedure has been laid down under sections 476 to
487 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Since there is no
ambiguity with respect to applicability of contempt of
court ordinance, 2003, that is the exclusive domain of
superior courts but with only exception to the subsection
(3) of section 4 of Ordinance, 2003. It is to be
emphasized that the subordinate courts while proceeding
with the trials of contemnors under the provisions of

Criminal Procedure Code also must bear in mind the
10

guidelines provided under Volume III, Chapter 8, Part-A
& B of the High Court Rules and Orders. In determining
the jurisdiction of subordinate courts in dealing with
contempt triable under subsection (3) ibid, pre-requisite
of section 195 Cr.P.C shall be fulfilled.

10. Clauses (b) & (c) of subsection (1) of the section
195 Cr.P.C. have enlisted the list of offences under
Pakistan Penal Code for trial of which procedure is
prescribed under sections 476 to 487 Cr.P.C. The list of

offences is tabulated as under:

§.193 | Giving or fabricating false evidence in a judicial proceeding.

Giving or fabricating false evidence in any other case.

Giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to cause any person to
$.194 | be convicted of capital offence.

If innocent person be thereby convicted and executed.

S. 195 | Giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to procure conviction of
an offence punishable with transportation for life or with imprisonment

for 7 years or upwards.

Using in a judicial proceeding evidence known to be false or fabricated.

False statement made in any declaration which is by law receivable as
evidence.
Using as true any such declaration known to be false.

False personation for the purpose of any act or proceeding in a suit or
criminal prosecution, or for becoming bail or security.

S.206 | Fraudulent removal or concealment, etc. of property to prevent its
seizure as a forfeiture, or in satisfaction of a fine under sentence or in
execution of a decree.

Claiming property without right, or practicing deception touching any
right to it, to prevent its being taken as forfeiture, or in satisfaction of a

fine under sentence, or in execution of a decree.

11

Fraudulently suffering a decree to pass for a sum not due, or suffering
decree to be executed after it has been satisfied.

False claim in a Court of Justice.

Fraudulently obtaining a decree for a sum not due or causing a decree to
be executed after it has been satisfied.

8.211 | False charge of offence made with intent to injure.

If offence charged be punishable with imprisonment for 7 years or
upwards.

If offence charged be capital, or punishable with transportation for life.

S.228 | Intentional insult or interruption to a public servant sitting in any stage
of a judicial proceeding.

11. It is also not out of context to mention here that
according to clauses (b) & (c) of subsection (1) of section
195 Cr.P.C. only the offences against public justice and
those relating to documents given in evidence are to be
prosecuted by the subordinate courts. Needless to
mention that other offences of contempt of lawful
authority of public servants under sections 172 to 188
PPC to be dealt with under the ordinary procedure laid
down for the trial of other criminal cases. Thus, a line of
distinction has been drawn between the cases of
contempt relating to courts and public servants. For trials
of the former a special procedure has been envisaged
under chapter XXXV of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
however it must be kept into mind that the pre-condition
of written complaint by the authority concerned for

offences of both types of contempt and perjury is
Pa
a

¢ ¢

12

common. Again, it is not to be over emphasized that the
subordinate courts are required to adhere to the procedure
prescribed in Chapter-XXXV of Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898 which contemplates special procedure in
proceedings of offences affecting the administration of
justice subject to pre-condition contained in section 195
Cr.P.C. and modus operandi under this chapter is further
divided in two categories. The first category caters for
the cases which either do not fall within the definition of
direct contempt or in some cases though contempt is
committed directly but the court chooses not to try the
contemnor itself. For the first category of cases summary
procedure of trials provided in chapter XXII is prescribed
to the exclusion of subsection (2) of section 262 Cr.P.C.
and quantum of punishment which court may impose is
also provided under subsection (2) of section 476 Cr.P.C.
In the latter category of cases only the offence under
section 228 PPC is covered which is committed in
presence of court. It is also relevant to mention that term
“Court” covers civil, Revenue and Criminal court. In this
category of cases the court trying the contemnor cannot
pass sentence beyond fine of rupees 200 and in default
whereof shall entail simple imprisonment of one month.
If the court considers that the accused person should be
imprisoned other than in default of payment of fine or

that a fine exceeding rupees 200 should be imposed upon
13

him, then after recording the facts constituting the
offence and statement of accused may forward the case to
Magistrate having jurisdiction. Otherwise, a court in
whose presence the contempt is committed may take the
offender into custody and at any time before rising of the
court on the same day may take cognizance of the
offence and punish the contemnor there and then.
However, record of the proceedings shall be maintained
in the manner prescribed under section 481 Cr.P.C.
Section 482 Cr.P.C. contemplates forwarding of cases to
other courts when it is considered that the case should not
be dealt with under section 480 Cr.P.C. In other cases, as
discussed earlier the procedure prescribed under sections
476-A and 485 Cr.P.C. is to be adopted. It may not be
over emphasized that cases relating to contempt of public
servant under no stretch are covered under chapter
XXXV of the Cr.P.C.. Section 484 Cr.P.C. also provides
for discharge of offenders on tendering of apology but
discretion will lie with the court in accepting or rejecting
the apology. Another important feature of the procedure
must not lose sight into determination of forums as courts
and subordinate courts and categories of courts which
may pass the sentence or to which appeal will lie. In this
respect, provisions of section 476 Cr.P.C. are self-
explanatory. Nevertheless for the purposes of

proceedings the Registrar or Sub-Registrar appointed
14

under the Registration Act, 1908 are also covered within
the definition of Civil Court within the meaning of
section 480 and 482 Cr.P.C. as provided under section
483 Cr.P.C. The only exception to the proceedings under
chapter XXXV is section 487 Cr.P.C. which for the sake
of convenience and ready reference is reproduced
below:-

S. 487. Certain Judges and Magistrates not to
try offences referred to in Section 195 when
committed before themselves: (1) Except as
provided in Sections 476 _, 480 and 485 no Judge
of a Criminal Court or Magistrate, other than a
Judge of a High Court, shall try any person for
any offence referred to in Section 195, when
such offence is committed before himself or in
contempt of his authority, or is brought under his
notice, as such Judge or Magistrate in the course
of a judicial proceeding.

(2) [Omitted by taw Reforms Ordinance XII of
1972]

It is also pertinent to mention that there is no distinction

of Civil, Criminal and Revenue Court with regard to trial
of criminal contempt. So far as other civil contempt are
concerned, these are to be dealt with under the relevant
statutes and in no manner these have any relevance to the
contempt enumerated in Contempt of Court Ordinance,
2003 or Cr.P.C. which may be differentiated from the
other contempts except in cases of civil contempt of
grave nature wherein a reference can be sent by the

subordinate courts to the High Court.
15

12. It is cardinal principle of law that when law require
a particular thing to be done in a particular manner, it
shall be done in that particular manner and not otherwise.
Keeping in view this principle, it is obligatory for the
subordinate courts that in choosing of modus operandi
for cognizance and trial of contempt matters they shall
have complete knowledge and familiarity with the
requirements of law particularly in assessing the gravity
of the offence and selection of modus operandi. It is also
to be kept in mind that while dealing with the contemnors
any benign attitude can be construed upon the weakness
of the courts. For guidance, wisdom can be drawn from
the judgments of august Supreme Court of Pakistan in
case of Irshad Ahmad vs The State (Reported in 1992
SCMR 1229), Case of Haji KhawarSaleem (Reported in
2000 SCMR 1856), case of Rab Nawaz vs The State
(Reported in 2011 SCMR 1485), and case of State vs
Abu Syed Muhammad Idrees Ali Sikandar (Reported in
PLD 1965 SC 677). From Indian jurisdiction, AIR 1954
SC_102 may _also_be referred. The other relevant

judgements are; 1971 PCr.LJ 621, 1991 PCr.LJ 2067,
1985 PCr.LJ 360, 1990 PCr.LJ_ 1736, 1995 PCr.LJ
1307, 2000 PCr.LJ 1329, 2008 YLR 459 and 2003 MLD
613.

13. Now coming to the factual and legal aspects the

instant case, it is manifest from record that it was an
16

indirect contempt which was committed at a considerable
distance from the court by the petitioner and under no
canon of law the same was covered under section 228
PPC. It appears that the learned trial court was cognizant
of its jurisdiction under subsection (3) of section 4 of the
Ordinance, 2003 but at the same time it has misconceived
the provisions of section 228 PPC which only provided
for contempt committed in the presence of the court. The
learned trial court also found the accused guilty of
commission of offence under section 186 PPC and the
provisions of said sections has also been reproduced in
the impugned order which too was illegally proceeded
under section 228 PPC despite being not amenable to
section 476 Cr.P.C. Nevertheless, the learned trial court
passed the sentence of imprisonment under section 228
PPC, in which only fine of rupees two hundred can be
imposed and no sentence beyond fine can be passed.
Thus, without moment’s hesitation it can be held that the
order of the learned trial court suffers from gross
illegality and in utter disregard of the law on the subject.
Hence, the same is not sustainable.

14. As necessary corollary to above, the judgment(s)
of the learned trial court are hereby set aside and the
matters are remanded back to the learned trial court with
the direction to re-decide the same after strict adherence

to the procedure discussed hereinabove. Parties are
17

directed to appear before the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-XVIII, Peshawar on 25.04.2024

15. The worthy Additional Registrar (Judicial) of this
court shall send copy of this judgment to Sessions Judge
of each District of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, who shall
onward circulate its copy among the courts of his/her
respective district.
