Cr.R No.24-B of 2015.
JUDGMENT

Date of hearing 09.12.2015

Appellant-Petitioner: Wasi__Ullah_ By Mr.

Faroog Khan _ Sokari,
Advocate.

Respondent: By Sultan Mehmood

Khan, Avocate, State By
Saif ur Rehman, Addl:
A.G.

IKRAMULLAH KHAN, J.--- Through the instant

Criminal Revision Petition, the petitioner Wasiullah

has called in question the impugned order dated

25.06.2015, rendered by the learned Additional

Sessions Judge-III, Bannu, whereby prosecution was

allowed for recording statement of Junaid

Khan/respondent No.2 while objection raised by

counsel for defence with regard to non-recording of

said statement was turned down.
2. Learned counsel for petitioner contended

that the impugned judgment is against law, as the

statement of the proposed witness had not been

recorded, by the investigation officer, under section

161 Cr.P.C and as such, when copies of statement of a

witness is not provided to an accused, in view of the

provision contained in section 265 (C) Cr.P.C, no such

person would be examined as witness during course of

trial, but the learned trial court below has not properly

appreciated the law in this respect and had exercised a

jurisdiction not vested in him by allowing the proposed

witness to record his statement, thereby fell in error of

law, which has occasioned not only patent illegality

but also gross miscarriage of justice.

3. On the other hand, learned counsel for the

respondent and learned AAG, on behalf of the state,

while vehemently refuted the grounds raised by

learned counsel for petitioner, argued that the

impugned judgment is based on correct appreciation of

law, as the witness namely Junaid Khan, who was an
injured PW, could not recorded his statement, during

course of investigation, being unable to talk and was

under treatment in the hospital. Next argued that not

only the provision contained in section 265(F)(2)

Cr.P.C under section 540 Cr.P.C, conferred ample

power and jurisdiction upon the trial court to call and

summon any person remained acquainted with the

facts of the case and is able to give evidence for the

prosecution but also the High Court rules, empower

the trial court to summon any person as a witness,

remained acquainted with facts of the case, in strive of

dispensation of criminal justice.

4. I have heard learned counsel for the

parties in light of law and facts on record.

5. It is mandatory provision of law

envisaged there-under 265(C) Cr.P.C, that apart from

(a), (b) and (d), the statements of all witnesses

recorded under section 161 and 164 Cr.P.C in view of

clause (c) of section 265(C) Cr.P.C, shall be supplied
to the accused, free of cost not later than seven days

before the commencement of the trial.

6. In case in hand, which is admitted fact, as

the petitioner had raised no objection in this regard

that copies of all the documents as mentioned in

section 265(C) Cr.P.C were not supplied to the

petitioner free of cost, however, copy of statement of

the injured PW was not supplied. It is also admitted

fact that no statement of the injured PW was recorded

during course of investigation under section 161

Cr.P.C, therefore, it could not be presumed that the

learned trial court had not fulfilled the requirements of

law as envisaged thereunder section 265 (C) Cr.P.C

which reads as:

“265 (C) 265C. Supply of statements
and documents to accused. (1) In all
cases instituted upon police report,
copies of the following documents shall
be supplied free of cost to the accused
not later than seven days before the

commencement of the trial, namely:

(a) the first information report,
(b) the police report;

(oc) the statements of all witnesses
recorded under sections 161 and
164, and

(d) _ the inspection note recorded by an
investigating officer on his first
visit to the place of occurrence and
the note recorded by him on
recoveries made, if any:
Provided that, if any part of a
statement recorded under section
161 or section 164 is such that its
disclosure to the accused would be
inexpedient in the public interest,
such part of the statement shall be
excluded from the copy of the

statement furnished to the accused.

7. As the statement of the injured PW was

not recorded , therefore, the contention of the learned

counsel for petitioner that the injured PW could not be

examined as a witness on the only ground that he had

not recorded his statement in view of section 161

Cr.P.C is not conceivable and liable to be dismissed.

The non-availability of statement of a witness who had

not recorded its statement could not be considered to
be a violation of the provision of section 265(C)

Cr.P.C and likewise the law does not place any

embargo on examination of a person during course of

trial, either in favour of prosecution or accused, who

had not recorded his statement under section

161Cr.P.C.

8. A person though well cited a witness in

the FIR and the report under section 173 Cr.P.C but his

statement was not recorded there under section 161

Cr.P.C could not be equated with a person who was

neither cited as a witness nor his statement was

recorded during course of investigation.

9. Witnesses whose names appear in the list

of witnesses, annexed with the report under section

173 Cr.P.C submitted before the trial court and once

the prosecution is allowed to lead its evidence, no

special permission is required, for producing each and

every witness, thereafter, from the trial court.

However, if the prosecution or the court in view of

section 265 (F)(2) Cr.P.C, desires to produce a person,
not already cited as a witness, in calendar of witnesses,
then the permission, in this regard from the trial court
become necessary.

10. The provision contained in section 265
(F)(2) and 540 Cr.P.C, is not applicable to the
attending facts and circumstances of the case. The
provision contained in section 26(F) (2) Cr.P.C is in
additional to section 265 (C)(1) Cr.P.C which reads as:

“265 (F)(1) If the accuses
does not plead guilty or the
court in its discretion does not
convict him on his plea, the
Court shall proceed to hear the
complainant (if any) and take
all such evidence as may be
produced in support of the

prosecution.”

11. Subsection (1) of section 265-(F) Cr.P.C,
as mentioned hereinabove, has made it mandatory
upon the court to take all such evidence as may be
produced in support of the prosecution and as such,
there is no any restriction on the prosecution to

produce evidence of its choice or to apply for
permission of the court while sub-section (2) of section

265(F) Cr.P.C would be invoked if a person remained

acquainted with the facts of the case is desired to be

summoned through Courts, who was not produced in

the first instance, by the prosecution, under sub-section

(1) of section 265 (F) Cr.P.C, which shall be subject to

grant of permission by the Court. In view of subsection

(3) of section 265(F) Cr.P.C, the witness mentioned in

sub-section (2) ibid may be refused by the court to

summon any such witness, if it is of opinion that such

witness is being called for purpose of vexation of

delay or defeating the ends of justice. But the court has

given no choice to refuse to examine any witness

produced by prosecution, in view of sub-section 1 of

section 265(F) Cr.P.C.

12. The provision contained in section 540

Cr.P.C is more exhaustive and conferred vast

jurisdiction upon the court, even to examine a witness

not summoned as a witness in the case or examine any

person in attendance if his evidence appears to the
court, essential to the just decision of the case, which

reads as:

540.- Power to summon
material witness or examine
persons present. Any Court may,
at any stage of any inquiry, trial
or other proceeding under this
Code summon any person as a
witness, or examine any person
in attendance, though not
summoned as a_ witness, or
recall and re-examine any
person already examined; and
the Court shall summon and
examine or recall and_ re-
examine any such person if his
evidence appears to it essential

to the just decision of the case”

13. In strive of and to arrive at just and fair

decision, the trial court has conferred with ample

power to examine any person as a witness in the case,

irrespective of the fact whether, his statement under

section 161 Cr.P.C was recorded during course of

investigation or not.

14. In “Nekam Deen V. The State through
Advocate General and 15 others” (PLD 2006

Supreme Court (AJ &K) 43) in para 24 it is held as:

“24.The procedure visualized
by Chapter XX or XXII-A of
Cr.P.C. as the case may be,
ensures a fair trial not only
for the accused but also to
the prosecution as well as for
the complainant. The
provisions in the _ chapters
have dispelled the age old
impression that the accused
is the special child of the
law. The Court is given a
discretion under subsection
(2) of section 265-F_ to
summon any person’ who
appears to the Court to be
acquainted with the fact of
the case and able to give
evidence for the prosecution.
Thus, the above regulatory
provisions are not for the
accused only, but for the
prosecution and complainant
as well. These ensure that
justice Should be done
between all the parties before

the Court i.e. the
-ll-

complainant who moved the
machinery of law, the
investigating agency who
conducted the _ investigation
and collected the evidence,
the prosecution who conducts
the prosecution on the basis
of evidence collected by the
investigating agency and the
accused who is the ultimate
sufferer or winner, as_ the
case may be. The right of all
the parties for fair trial is
ensured”.

15. The judgment cited by learned counsel for
petitioner “Shahbaz Masih Vs. The Satate” (2007
SCMR 1631) with utmost respect could not be applied
to the facts and circumstances of the case in hand, as
not only the name of injured PW Junaid was well
mentioned in calendar of witnesses by the prosecution
but he was also cited as an injured person in the FIR.
16. Keeping in view, the aforementioned
reasons, no other exception, could be taken, but the
one, held by learned trial court below, therefore, this
revision petition is dismissed accordingly.
