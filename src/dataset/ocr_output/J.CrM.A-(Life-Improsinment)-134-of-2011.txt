SYED MUHAMMAD _ATTIQUE __SHAH, _J:-
Appellant-convict Akhtar Zaib alias Kala Muna S/o
Fagir Muhammad has filed instant appeal against the
conviction and sentence passed against him by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-II, Mansehra,
Camp Court at Oghi, vide judgment dated 12.07.2011
in case FIR No. 34 dated 21.01.2009 under Section
302/34 PPC of Police Station Oghi, District Mansehra,
whereby the appellant-convict was convicted under
Section 302-B PPC and sentenced to life

imprisonment with fine of Rs. 200,000/- and in default
to undergo six months SI. Benefit of Section 382-B
Cr.P.C has been extended to him.

2. Muhammad Iqbal Khan ASHO was on
Gusht, when he received information that an unknown
dead body is lying in the forest of village Chakal
Payen. On such information, he rushed to the spot,
found a dead body smeared in blood, having a wound
on head. He conducted search of the dead body but
could not recover any identity of the deceased. He
prepared injury sheet and inquest report of the
deceased and sent the dead body for postmortem
examination. He started inquiry under Section 174
Cr.P.C. during course of which the photographs of the
deceased were published in newspaper. During
inquiry, Muhammad Arif (PW-2) came and stated that
the dead body was of Muhammad Ameen S/o
Muhammad Taj deceased who was his paternal cousin
and 15/16 days prior, he left the house along with Kala
alias Muna and did not return. On the basis of
publication as well as rumours, they inquired and also
identified the photographs of the deceased who has

been murdered by Kala alias Muna. On the basis of
said statement of PW-2, FIR was registered against
appellant-convict.
3. Initially appellant-convict was
absconding, however, he was arrested in the instant
case on 01.11.2009 who was produced by Ali Akbar
SI (PW-7) before the court on 02.11.2009 and he
obtained two days police custody of the appellant-
convict. PW-7 prepared site plan Ex PC on the
pointation of accused and on 04.11.2009, produced
him vide application Ex PW-7/7 for recording his
confessional statement. Appellant-convict confessed
his guilt and disclosed the names of his co-accused
Munawar and Taj Feroz who were also arrayed as
accused in the instant case.
4. Dead body of deceased was examined by
Dr. Niaz Muhammad (PW-9). According to his report
Ex PW-9/1, he found the following injuries on the
body of deceased:-

“1. A big longitudinal wound

extending from parietal region

of head to the occipital region.

The wound was gapping in

appearance and the skull bones

were broken into pieces. Brain

matter was present in small
amount and was noted outside
the wound. Size of wound was 6

inches x 3 inches cavity deep.

2. Right thigh was swollen

and underlying femur bone was

fractured with crackling sound

noted.

3. Bruises of brown colour

were noted on the chest, legs

and thighs and whole body.”
5. During course of investigation Khalid
Khan SI (PW-14) recovered axe from the house of
accused through recovery memo Ex PW-11/1 having
some suspicious blood on it, which was sent to FSL
and report of FSL Ex PW-14/6 revealed that the axe
contained human blood. After completion of
investigation, prosecution submitted complete challan
for trial of the accused.
6. After supplying copies to the accused in
compliance of Section 265-C Cr.P.C. the learned trial
Court framed charge against the accused to which they
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution
was thus asked to produce its evidence. In order to
prove its case against the accused, prosecution
produced and examined 14 PWs and closed its
evidence. The learned trial Court recorded statements

of the accused under Section 342 Cr.P.C. After hearing

arguments of learned counsel for the parties, the
learned trial Court convicted the appellant-convict
under Section 302-B PPC and sentenced him to
undergo life imprisonment. He was further ordered to
pay fine of Rs. 200,000/- and in default to further
undergo SI for six months. Benefit of Section 382-B
Cr.P.C. was extended to him. However, co-accused

Munawar and Taj Feroz were acquitted of the charge.

Ia

Arguments heard and record perused.

8. The prosecution case rests on
circumstantial evidence as there is no eyewitness of
the occurrence. In order to reach to the neck of culprit
from the murder of the deceased through said chain of
circumstances, the prosecution is equipped with:-

i. Recovery of blood from the spot.
ii. Recovery of axe from the house of appellant-
convict.

iii. Report of FSL.

iv. Confessional statement of the appellant-
convict.
v. Motive.

vi. Oral as well as medical evidence.

9. We would first take the confessional
statement of the accused and its evidentiary value. The

only piece of evidence which prevailed before the
learned trial Court to convict the appellant was his
confessional statement before Judicial Magistrate and
the recovery of crime axe from his house. It is settled
law that confession must not only be voluntary but it
must also be true. In order to ascertain the truthfulness
of confession, it must be visualized and examined in
juxtaposition with the other evidence of the
prosecution. For such comparison we would like to

reproduce the confessional statement of the accused:-

10. The appellant-convict in his confessional
statement has not disclosed any clear motive which
prompted them to commit the murder of the deceased,
rather he stated that after selling his property, the
deceased had asked them to do a business with the sale
proceeds. When the deceased was ready to do a joint
business from the sale proceeds of his property, what
was the reason for killing him? is a question which
finds no answer on record. Moreover, the postmortem
report of the deceased reveals that he had only one
injury on his head, while the appellant-convict in his
confessional statement stated that three injuries with
the blows of axe were inflicted to the deceased, first
by Munawar, second by Taj Feroz and third by the
appellant-convict. The appellant convict also states in
his confessional statement that Rs. 200,000/- were
taken out from the pocket of deceased by Taj Feroz,
out of which Rs. 80,000/- were paid to him, however,
during course of investigation, said amount could not
be recovered from any of the accused. He also states
in his confessional statement that after the occurrence,

they went to the house of Taj Feroz who asked him to
take along the axe and thereafter, the appellant-convict
left for Peshawar. He never stated that prior to leaving
for Peshawar, he had visited his house and left the axe
there. The entire facts disclosed by the appellant-
convict in his confessional statement are contradictory
to the evidence available on record.

The case can be looked from another
angle. As per record, the appellant-convict was
arrested in the instant case on 01.09.2011 in injured
condition, he was produced before the court with
prayer of police custody and two days police custody
was granted. He was also got examined through
medical officer and his medical report is available on
file as Ex PW-9/D-1. However, PW-12, while
appearing in the witness box stated that he was
unaware as to whether the accused had any apparent
injury on his body or not. In Ex PW-12/1, ie. the
questionnaire put to accused prior to recording his
confessional statement shows answer to question “Do
you have any apparent injury?” as “No”. Moreover, as
per Ex PW-12/2, the accused was produced before the
learned Judicial Magistrate (PW-12) at 01:30 PM for

recording his confessional statement. After putting the
questions mentioned in the questionnaire, the accused
was given time of 30 minutes to think over his
confession, however, interestingly the confession
statement of the accused was concluded at 01:45 PM.
All this shows that accused was not given proper time
nor any satisfactory measures were adopted prior to
recording the confession of the accused and the same
was recorded in cursory manner. Therefore, the
confessional story of the accused does not appear to be
true and voluntary. Indeed it completely belies the
prosecution story. Regarding the voluntariness of the
said confession, suffice it to mention that the same was
recorded on fourth day of his arrest. In “Muhammad
Parvez and others Vs The State (2007 SCMR 630)”,
the apex Court has held that confessional statement
recorded with a delay of four days, could not be made
basis for conviction of the accused.

11. There is no cavil to the proposition that
conviction can be awarded to the accused on the basis
of sole confession, however, for that the confession
must be voluntary, true, without any inducement, fear
and coercion. In “Manjeet Singh Vs. The State (PLD

2006 SC 30)”, the august Supreme Court held that:-
10

“There is no rule of criminal
administration of justice that
the Court having found the
retracted confession voluntary
and true, must also look for the
corroboration and in absence
of corroborative evidence
conviction cannot be
maintained. The retraction of a
judicial or extra-judicial
confession itself is not an
infirmity to be considered
sufficient to withhold the
conviction because the
evidentiary value of a
confession is not diminished by
mere fact that it was retracted
by the maker at the trial and
thus the independent
corroboration from other
source direct or
circumstantial, cannot be
insisted in every case as a
mandatory rule rather the rule
of corroboration is applied as
abundant caution and in a case
depending entirely on the
confessional statement of a
person or only of the
circumstantial evidence, this
rule is applied more
cautiously.”

12. In the circumstance and the manner and
mode, the confession of the appellant-convict was
recorded which was subsequently retracted, as a rule
of caution, it must be supported by some
connecting/corroborative evidence. “State Vs Wagar

(1992 SCMR 950), Nazir Hussain Vs The Crown
11

(1969 SCMR 442) , Habib Ullah Vs The State (1971
SCMR 341) and Staet Vs. Minhun (PLD 1964 SC
813)”.

13. The prosecution claims corroboration
from recovery of crime weapons i.e. axe. As alleged
by the prosecution, the crime weapon allegedly
recovered contained human blood as per Serologist
report Ex PW-14/6, however, despite the fact that the
blood stained garments and blood recovered from the
spot were also sent for examination, there is nothing
regarding matching or grouping of the blood on the
crime weapon with the blood on the clothes of the
deceased as well as blood recovered from the spot.
Therefore, this missing chain would obviously benefit
the accused.

14. Moreover, the recovery of alleged crime
weapon i.e. axe was shown from the house the
accused. Admittedly appellant-convict was not present
at the time of alleged recovery. The IO who allegedly
recovered the axe, had raided the house of the accused
in absence of any lady constable. No one from the
family of the accused had come forward to disclose

that the axe belonged to the appellant-convict, nor the
12

investigating officer could bring on record any
documentary evidence showing that the house
wherefrom the alleged axe was recovered, was of
appellant-convict. The marginal witness to memo Ex
PW-11/1, Nasir Zaman during cross examination
stated that he resides in Karachi and had come to the
village due to the occurrence. He also disclosed that
the accused along with his family members were
residing in the said house and such like axe is usually
available in each house of the village. Thus the
prosecution failed to establish that the recovered axe
was actually the crime weapon in the instant case.

15. Admittedly the parents of the deceased
had died prior to his murder, while he was neither
married nor having any brother and sister. PW-2, Arif
is the cousin of the deceased and was also his legal
heir. The occurrence allegedly took place on
06.01.2009. According to PW-8, the relatives of the
deceased had visited police station on 16.01.2009 and
had identified the deceased to be Muhammad Ameen
through his photographs and clothes etc. however, the
statement of Muhammad Arif under Section 164

Cr.P.C was recorded on 20.01.2009 on the basis of
which FIR was registered on 21.01.2009. There is
nothing on record to suggest as to why from
16.01.2009 till 21.01.2009, Muhammad Arif was not
produced before the court for recording his statement
under Section 164 Cr.P.C. Keeping in view the said
delay in recording statement under Section 164
Cr.P.C. the probability of prior consultation and
deliberations cannot be ruled out. Moreover, PW-1
Qamar Zaman and PW-2 Muhammad Arif, both are
the cousins of the deceased. PW-1 deposed during
cross examination that the other property of the
deceased is in possession of one Aurangzeb while PW-
2 deposed that the deceased had disposed of his entire
property. PW-2 further deposed during cross
examination that they were informed by one Arshad a
Suzuki driver that deceased and accused had travelled
together in his Suzuki prior to occurrence. Neither the
statement of said Arshad was brought on record during
investigation, nor this stance get support from the
material available on record. Similarly, the deceased
had joint property with PW-1 and PW-2, while the
accused had no joint property with the deceased. The

deceased was willing to do joint business with accused
14

from the sale proceeds of his property, as such the
motive advanced by the prosecution is not appealing
to a prudent mind, as there is nothing on record that
the accused wanted to grab the money of deceased or
deceased was not willing to pay something to the
accused out of sale proceeds of his property.

16. In the circumstances when the alleged
confessional statement of the appellant-convict not
only belies the mode and manner of the occurrence as
narrated by the prosecution, but the said confession is
not corroborated by any other material evidence, then
we are afraid that such confessional statement has
been wrongly considered for passing conviction
against the accused. The testimony of oral PWs as well
as the witnesses of recovery and pointation etc. are
contradictory to each other. The report of FSL does not
suggest that the blood found on the allegedly
recovered axe was of the same group of blood
recovered from the place of deceased. The statement
of Arshad Suzuki driver, who had allegedly last seen
the deceased in the company of accused, was not

recorded. So the prosecution could not built up a chain
15

of circumstantial evidence, leading to the conviction
of accused.

17. In view of the above, we hold that the
prosecution has failed to prove its charge against the
appellant-convict as well, beyond any shadow of
doubt, therefore, while accepting this appeal, we set
aside the impugned conviction and sentence passed
against the appellant/convict and acquit him in this
case. He be set free forthwith, if not required in any
other case/crime.

18. These are the reasons for our short order
of the even date.
