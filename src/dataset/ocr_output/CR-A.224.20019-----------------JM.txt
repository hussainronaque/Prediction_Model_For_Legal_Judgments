S_M_ATTIQUE SHAH, J:- Through this
judgment, we shall also decide
Cr.R.No.120-P/2018 titled “Abdul Akbar
Vs. Hamid etc.” as both the cases have
emanated from same judgment dated
25.09.2018 of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-l, Swabi delivered in
case FIR No.1209 dated 19.11.2016
registered under sections 302/324 PPC
read with section 15 of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013 at police
station Swabi, District Swabi whereby the
appellant has been convicted under
sections 302 (b) PPC and sentenced to
imprisonment for life as Tazir. He has also
been directed to pay compensation of
Rs.300,000/- to the legal heirs of the
deceased in terms of section 544-A
Cr.P.C or in default whereof to further
suffer simple imprisonment for six
months. The learned trial court also
convicted the appellant under section 15
of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act,

2013 and sentenced him to undergo one
year RI with fine of Rs.5,000/-. In default
of such payment, he shall further undergo
one month SI. However, benefit of section
382-B Cr.P.C was extended to the
appellant. Both the sentences were
ordered to run concurrently.

2. According to the prosecution’s
case, on 19.11.2016 complainant Abdul
Akbar (P.W.6) brought the dead body of
his son Taugeer Ahmad (deceased) to the
DHQ Hospital, Swabi and reported the
matter to the local police in the Casualty
to the effect that on the night of
occurrence he along with his deceased
son Tauqeer was proceeding to their
house from Mosque and when. they
reached to the place of occurrence, the
accused-appellant, armed with pistol, was
standing in front of his shop. On seeing
them, he started firing at them with his
pistol with the intention to kill them, as a
result whereof his son Tauqeer Ahmed
got hit and died on the spot while he
escaped unhurt. Motive for the
occurrence was stated to be altercation

between his deceased son and the
accused-appellant having taken place in
the morning. On _ the report of
complainant, present case was registered
against the accused-appellant.

3. After arrest of the accused-
appellant and completion of investigation,
challan against the appellant was
submitted before the learned trial Court,
which indicted him for the offence to
which he pleaded not guilty. In order to
prove its case, prosecution examined 09
witnesses, whereafter statement of the
accused was recorded wherein he
professed his innocence. After conclusion
of trial, the learned trial court while
appreciating the evidence in its wisdom
had found the appellant guilty of the
charge and; whilst recording _ his
conviction sentenced him as mentioned
above, whereagainst he has filed the
instant appeal.

4. Heard. Record perused.

5. Perusal of record reveals that
accused-appellant has directly been
charged by complainant (P.W-6) in the
promptly lodged FIR (Ex.PA) _ for
committing Qaitl-e-Amd of his son
Taugeer Ahmad. Prosecution in support
of its case produced its star witness
complainant of the case as (P.W-6) who
deposed before the court quite in line with
what he stated in his report/Murasila
(Ex.PA/1). According to the complainant,
at the relevant time and date he along
with his deceased son Taugeer Ahmad
after performing of /sha prayer were
proceeding to their home when in the
meanwhile, the accused-appellant,
standing in front of his shop armed with
pistol, fired at them resultantly, his son
sustained firearm injuries and died on the
spot whereas he escaped unhurt. He
further stated that he had recognized the
accused-appellant in the light of a bulb lit
outside the shop of the accused-
appellant. This P.W was cross-examined
at length, however, nothing beneficial
could be extracted from his mouth to
support the case of the accused-
appellant. The evidence furnished by the
complainant gets ample corroboration

from medical evidence, which shows that
the deceased had received two firearm
wounds. Record reflects that the 1.0 of
the case Sajjad Khan, SI (P.W-8) has
secured from the spot 02 empties of .30
bore pistol (Ex.P-01), emitting fresh smell
of discharge, which were sealed into a
parcel vide memo (Ex.P.W.3/1). He also
secured blood from the spot and sealed it
into parcel vide memo (Ex.P.W.3/2). He
also received blood-stained clothes of the
deceased consisting of Qameez (Ex.P-2),
Shalwar (Ex.P-3), Banyan (Ex.P-4),
waistcoat (Ex.P-5) having 03 bullet marks
through FC Saadat and the same were
sealed in parcel vide memo (Ex.P.W.3/3).
He also recovered and; secured one
energy saver bulb (Ex.P-05) from the front
of the shop of the accused facing trial
installed above the door of shop vide
memo (Ex.P.W.3/4), which was lit at the
time of the occurrence. He has also
placed on file postmortem report (Ex.P.M)
of the deceased after its receipt. It is
worth mentioning that the accused-
appellant was arrested on even date i.e.

19.11.2016 and; crime weapon was also
recovered upon his pointation i.e. .03 bore
pistol from his residential house by the 1.0
vide recovery memo (Ex.P.W.8/7) who
has also prepared sketch of the place of
recovery (Ex.P.W.8/8). The case of the
prosecution is also supported by medical
evidence in shape of postmortem report
(Ex.PM) and in support of the same
prosecution recorded the statement of
(P.W-2) Dr.Siraj Hussain who has
affirmed the firearm wounds on the
person of the deceased. The cause of
death of the deceased has been shown
as injury to heart leading to heart failure. It
is worth mentioning that the occurrence
has been shown taken place at 19:50
hours whereas the report has been
lodged by the complainant at 20:10 hours
within 20 minutes of the occurrence at
hospital, which can be well regarded as a
promptly lodged report which was
reduced into Murasila (Ex.PA) thereby
ruling out the element of consultation and;
deliberation being a genuine document
free from manipulation. No doubt, the

occurrence is of nocturnal, albeit, not only
the complainant (P.W-6) has stated in the
Murasila Ex.PA/1 that he recognized the
accused-appellant in the light of bulb lit in
the front of his shop at the time of
occurrence, but the 1.0 (P.W-8) also
secured the said bulb through recovery
memo (Ex.P.W.3/4), therefore, question
of misidentification does not arise in the
attending circumstances of the case.
Besides, in the occurrence a_ single
accused has been nominated for
commission of offence, therefore,
possibility of his substitution is also out of
consideration in view. of _ settled
proposition that substitution in case of a
single accused is a rare phenomenon.
Arshad Beg Vs. The State (2017 SCMR
1727).

6. Admittedly, the prosecution
has relied upon the sole testimony of
P.W-6 (complainant) qua oral account,
however, in criminal cases as per the
settled principle of law it is the quality of
the evidence not quantity which is
determining factor qua the guilt of the

accused-appellant when such testimony
is found confidence inspiring, is sufficient
to sustain conviction. Superior courts
have consistently held that as a general
rule the court can and may act on the
testimony of a single witness provided he
is wholly reliable. Indeed there is no legal
impediment in convicting a person on sole
testimony of a single witness. In fact, it is
not the number, the quantity, but the
quality of the evidence adduced by the
prosecution that is material. It is the long
established and; time honoured principle
that evidence has to be weighed and not
counted. jaz Ahmed Vs. The State
(2022 SCMR 1577), Niaz-ud-Din Vs. The
State (2011 SCMR 725) and Ehsan Vs.
The State (2006 SCMR 1857). When
tested upon the ibid principle this court
found the testimony of P.W-6 consistent,
coherent, confidence inspiring, reliable,
free from improvements and
contradictions and; thus has a ring of
truth, therefore, the same is sufficient for
maintaining conviction of the accused-

appellant.

7. Coming to the contention of
the learned defence counsel that the
empties were not sent to the FSL after its
recovery, rather the same were sent after
the recovery of crime pistol on the
pointation of the accused-appellant and;
therefore, its positive report is of no
support to the case of prosecution. Given
that the same has not been sent
separately, however, suffice it to state that
the same would not effect the case of the
prosecution as of now it is well settled that
if the prosecution remained successful in
proving its case through ocular account of
unimpeachable character, then
circumstantial evidence, if not proved,
would not effect the case of the
prosecution. In the case in hand, the
prosecution remained successful in
proving its case beyond reasonable doubt
through evidence of unimpeachable
character, therefore, the accused-
appellant was rightly convicted by the
learned trial court.

8. Moving towards the contention

of the learned counsel representing the
11

appellant that though motive was alleged
by the prosecution, however, same could
not be proved by it by forwarding
evidence in this respect. It is settled that
existence or non-existence of motive, its
proving or non-proving by the prosecution
is not fatal to the prosecution case when
the case is otherwise proved from ocular
and; medical evidence. Waras Khan Vs.
The State (2011 SCMR 387). Therefore,
the contention of the learned counsel
representing the appellant is unfounded.
Indeed, it is well settled that whenever the
prosecution successfully establishes its
case through ocular account, which is
duly supported by the medical evidence to
the extent of nature of injuries or cause of
death with reference to the time of
incident, the other corroborative piece of
evidence loses its significance, substance
and value for prosecution to prove the
guilt of accused.

9. Judged from each and every
angle after reappraisal of the evidence
and; material available on record of the

case, we arrived at a conclusion that the
12

prosecution remained successful _ in
proving its case against the appellant
through cogent, reliable and confidence
inspiring evidence of unimpeachable
character, therefore, the learned trial court
while convicting and; sentencing the
appellant has arrived to a just conclusion,
which findings require no interference by
this court in its jurisdiction under section
410 Cr.P.C.

10. In view of what has been
discussed above, this appeal being
devoid of any merit, is dismissed and;
consequently the impugned judgment of
learned trial Court dated 25.09.2018 qua
conviction and sentence of the appellant,
is maintained.

11. So far as the criminal revision
for enhancement of the sentence is
concerned, suffice it to state that while
awarding the sentence of life to the
accused-appellant, the learned trial court
has rightly exercised its discretion in the
attending circumstances of the case to

which no exception could be taken,
hence, the criminal revision too is

dismissed.
