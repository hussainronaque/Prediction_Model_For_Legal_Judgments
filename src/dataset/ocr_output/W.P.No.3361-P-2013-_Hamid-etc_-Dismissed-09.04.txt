W.P.No. 3361-P of 20013

JUDGMENT
Date of hearing: 09.04.2015.
Appellant:
Respondent:

MAZHAR ALAM KHAN MIANKHEL, CJ.- Petitioners,

Hamid and Imtiaz, have filed instant writ petition for declaring the

order dated 18.12.2013 of Justice of Peace, Shabqadar, as illegal

and have prayed that the SHO Police Station Shabqadar be directed

not to register an FIR against them, which has been ordered to be

registered on the application of respondent No.1 Syed Sikandar

Shah under Section 22-A Cr.P.C. Similarly, respondent No. 1

(hereinafter called respondent No.1) has also filed Writ Petition

No.3054-P/2013 against the petitioners and three other persons

praying therein to declare the detention of his brother Syed

Rohullah Shah at the hands of petitioners as illegal and unlawful.

As common questions of law and facts are involved in both the

petitions, therefore, we propose to decide both the petitions

through this single judgment in Writ Petition No.3361-P/2013.
2. The allegation of respondent No.1 in his writ petition is

that the petitioners, who are in the Police Department, alongwith

others illegally detained his brother, therefore, he may be rescued

from the clutches of petitioners because his brother being a Hafiz-

e-Quran and law abiding citizen has not at all been involved in any

criminal act and his detention is thus quite illegal and without any

lawful cause. It may be mentioned here that respondent No.1 had

also filed an application under Section 22-A Cr.P.C. before the

Justice of Peace against the petitioners and others for registration

of a case against them for the illegal confinement/abduction of his

brother. The said application was accepted/allowed by the Justice

of Peace vide order dated 18.12.2013 and the SHO Police Station

Shabqadar was directed to register an FIR against the petitioners

and others under the relevant sections of law. The petitioners,

feeling aggrieved of the order of Justice of Peace, filed the instant

writ petition on 23.12.2013 but till 31.12.2013 the SHO of the

concerned Police Station had not registered the case as on the said

date this Court issued directions that no adverse action be taken

against the petitioners.
3. The petitioners in their reply to the writ petition of

respondent No.1 has denied to have illegally confined or abducted

the brother of petitioner. On the other hand, the learned Justice of

Peace has ordered for registration of a case against the petitioners

etc.
4. Arguments heard and record perused.
5. The learned Additional Sessions Judge as Justice of

Peace, in exercise of his powers under Section 22-A, Cr.PC, has

directed the SHO to register the FIR against the petitioners and

others as a cognizable offence seemed to have been committed by

the petitioners. A look at the order of the Justice of Peace would

reveal that the same has been passed in accordance with law,

keeping in view the allegations leveled against the petitioners

leading to a cognizable offence committed by the persons

mentioned therein and the SHO of the concerned Police Station

was bound under the law to register a case under the relevant

sections of law. Even otherwise the questions urged by the learned

counsel for the petitioners, being contentious, are essentially one of

fact, requiring recording of evidence, with which the Court
competent to try the petitioners can deal either during the trial or

through an application under Section 249-A or 265-K of the Cr.PC.

6. It is by now settled law that any order passed by the

Justice of Peace is not a judicial order and is of administrative and

ministerial in nature. It has just to issue an appropriate direction to

the police authorities on a complaint by any aggrieved person

regarding non-registration of criminal case as provided in Section

22A(6)(i) of Cr.P.C. It has nothing to do with the veracity and

truthfulness of the allegations leveled in the complaint/application.

If the facts and circumstances so alleged prima facie confirm the

commission of a cognizable offence and the local police, whatever

the reasons may be, is reluctant and avoiding the registration of an

FIR, then it has to issue such directions only. After registration of

the case, investigation in the case is the sole job of the concerned

police and the Justice of Peace has got no concern whatsoever with

the same. Since our society in general and the police in particular

also have a misconception regarding arrest of an accused after

registration of the criminal case and generally this authority is very

brutally misused so, we would also like to observe that the law on

the issue is also well settled and established. Arrest of an accused
is not a statutory compulsion during investigation of the case

provided the accused is cooperative with police during

investigation. This aspect of the law has very elaborately been

discussed in Mukhtiar Hussainâ€™s case reported as 2015 SCMR

1763. So, mere registration of case would not be a ground for

arrest of the accused during investigation. If the accused is proved

innocent during investigation, he can be dealt with in accordance

with the provisions of Section 169 and Section 173(3) of Cr.P.C

and the complainant can also be dealt-with under Section 182

Cr.P.C.

7. So far as the facts of the connected writ petition are

concermed, although the petitioner has asserted that the detenue is

in the illegal confinement of respondents but respondent No.3 in

his written reply has stated that when the alleged incident took

place, he was under suspension and moreover he was neither

posted in P.S Battagram nor in PS Shabgadar and similar is the

stance of respondent No.4, as he too in his written reply has stated

that he has no concern with the alleged incident and that he never

remained posted either in PS Battagram or in PS Shabqadar. In

view of such categoric rebuttal by the respondents, the matter
becomes a contentious one, which cannot be determined by this

Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction; hence, the same cannot be

issued. As the Justice of Peace has already ordered registration of a

case against the petitioners, which order was stayed under the

orders of this Court so, the SHO of the concerned Police Station is

directed to register a case against the petitioners under the relevant

sections of law by ensuring the protection of rights of both the

parties before him as discussed above.

8. We have gone through the impugned order as well as the

record appended with the petitions and found no jurisdictional

defect in it, which could justify interference of this Court in

exercise of constitutional jurisdiction, therefore, both the writ

petitions are hereby dismissed with no order as to costs.
