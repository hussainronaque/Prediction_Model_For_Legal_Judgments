QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:-Noor Muhammad,
appellant, preferred this appeal against the
judgment/order dated 26.05.2011 of the
learned Sessions Judge, Kohat, whereby, he
was convicted under section 302 (b) PPC and
sentenced to imprisonment for life, and also to

pay Rs:100000/- as compensation to the legal
heirs of the deceased, within the meaning of
section 544-A Cr.P.C, or in default thereof to
undergo six months S.I, while extending him

the benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C.

2. The case FIR  No.708 dated
12.12.2010 under sections 302 PPC, Police
Station, Jungle Khel, Kohat, was registered on
the report of Gul Muhammad, complainant,
who reported to police in the emergency room
of KDA Hospital, Kohat, that he was running a
cloth shop in Mian Khel Bazaar and was
present in his shop when at 20:00 hours on
the eventful day i.e. 12.12.2010 he was asked
by his brother, Faiz Muhammad, on his cell
phone to reach home and when he reached
there he came to know that his brothers i.e.
the appellant/accused and deceased Haji Gul
had a quarrel with each other and the former
had stabbed the latter with knife blows,
causing serious injuries to Haji Gul, who was
brought to the hospital and was lying there
unconscious and not in a position to record

statement, therefore, the complainant lodged
the report and charged the appellant for the
commission of offence; while stating, at the
same time, that there was no motive for the

commission of the offence.

3. The deceased Haji Gul, then injured,
was medically examined at 08:00 PM and the
Medical Officer found two grievous injuries
caused by sharp weapon on the body of the
deceased, then injured, i.e. one incised wound
of about 2 X 1/2 cm on the posterior surface of
right chest at the level of thoracic vertebrae,
and another incised wound of about 2 1/2 X
1/2 cm on the left buttock. The injured later
succumbed to the injuries and was subjected
to postmortem examination. The investigating
officer inspected the spot, but could neither
recover blood from the spot nor anything
incriminating during spot inspection on the
pointation of the eyewitness. The
accused/appellant was arrested on the
following day of the occurrence i.e.
13.12.2010; and at the time of his arrest, the

knife, allegedly used as weapon of offence,
was recovered from his possession. On
14.12.2010, the accused/appellant was
produced before the learned Judicial
Magistrate-Il, Kohat, and he recorded his
confessional statement. The widow of the
deceased, Mst. Asma Bibi, also charged the
appellant/accused for commission of the
offence in her statement under section 164
Cr.P.C on 15.12.2010. After completion of
investigation, complete challan was submitted
against the accused/appellant to the learned
trial Court, where the accused/appellant was
formally charged under section 302 PPC and
also under section 13 A.O, to which he

pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

4. During trial, the prosecution examined
as many as 12 PWs, including, Investigation
Officer, Saif-ur-Rehman S.1 (PW-1); Medical
Officer, Doctor Saleemullah (PW-3); Aqeeq
Hussain SHO, Police Station, Jungle Khel
(PW-4); Bakhtiar Khan S.l/Additional SHO
(PW-7); Mst. Asma Bibi, widow of the

deceased (PW-9); Complainant Gul
Muhammad (PW-10); and the learned Judicial
Magistrate-Il, Kohat, Muhammad Ghayas
Khan (PW-12), besides formal PWs. After
prosecution closed its evidence, statement of
accused/appellant was recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C. Although, he denied
allegations levelled against him by the
prosecution, but declined to be examined on
oath or produce defence evidence. After
hearing arguments of learned PP for the State
and learned defence counsel, the learned trial
Court/Sessions Judge, Kohat, rendered the
impugned judgment dated 26.05.2011,
thereby, convicting the appellant/accused and
awarding him the sentences, as mentioned

hereinabove; hence the instant appeal.

5. Arguments of learned counsel for the
convict-appellant and learned AAG heard. The
complainant, present in the Court during
hearing of the appeal, stated at the bar that he
would by relying on the arguments of learned

AAG. Record perused.
6. It is evident from the FIR that
complainant was not an eyewitness, and was
informed about the occurrence on his cell
phone by his other brother, namely, Faiz
Muhammad. However, the said Faiz
Muhammad was- abandoned by _ the
prosecution “being won over”. The widow of
the deceased Haji Gul, Mst. Asma _ Bibi,
recorded her statement under section 164
Cr.P.C, during investigation, on 15.12.2010
i.e. after three days of the occurrence, and
also after arrest of the appellant/accused on
13.12.2010 and his recording confessional
statement on 14.12.2010, wherein, she
narrated the story of quarrel of the
appellant/accused with his brother and her
deceased husband, leading to the occurrence;
but when appeared in the Court as PW-9, she
admitted this fact that at the time of
occurrence she was present in her house,
while quarrel took place in another house and
further that she was not present at the spot at

the time of quarrel and the occurrence.
According to her statement, she went to the
hospital after 4/5 hours of the occurrence and
that she came to know about the occurrence
after 4/5 hours of the occurrence and that her
statement was recorded by the police on the
third/fourth day of the occurrence which was
tutored to her by her first cousin namely Atta
Ullah. She admitted that the 1.0 and her
cousin Atta Ullah told her eight to ten times to
give statement under section 164 Cr.P.C, with
further admission that they had charged the
accused on suspicion. She admitted as
correct that somebody else had committed the
offence and that the accused/appellant had
satisfied them on Holy Quran that he was
innocent. Likewise, the complainant, Gul
Muhammad, admitted this fact that he had
lodged the report at the instance of police and
that he did not know anything about the
occurrence and also was unaware who killed
his brother. Like widow of the deceased, he
was Satisfied that the accused/appellant was

present with them in the hospital during the
whole night, and was arrested by the police
from the hospital, and further that the
accused/appellant was charged by them
under the pressure of police, and that he had
no objection if accused was acquitted of the

charge.

7. Obviously, the PWs belonging to the
same family, the complainang being real
brother and PW Mst. Asma Bibi, widow of the
deceased, having exonerated the
appellant/accused of the charge coupled with
absence of independent ocular evidence to
bring home charge against the
appellant/accused, left the prosecution case
bereft of incriminating evidence; but the
learned trial Court was largely influenced by
the confessional statement of the
appellant/accused and alleged recovery of
blood stained knife from the possession of the
appellant/accused at the time of his arrest to
record a_ guilty verdict against the

appellant/accused. The confession was,
however, retracted by the accused/appellant
in his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C,
who claimed to have satisfied the entire family
including widow of the deceased about his
innocence on Holy Qur’an. The statement of
the appellant/accused, when placed _ in
juxtaposition with aforementioned statements
of the PWs, this fact becomes clear that the
local police had played a crtical role in
bringing charge of gatl-i-amd of his brother on
a petty issue against the appellant/accused.
Even otherwise, a retracted confession was of
no help to the prosecution case unless
corroborated by other ocular = and
circumstantial evidence. The only
corroborative piece of evidence i.e. recovery
of blood stained knife from possession of the
appellant/accused at the time of his arrest
also became doubtful in view of the fact that
the knife, allegedly, recovered from the side
pocket of the accused/appellant was _ not
mentioned besmeared with blood, and the

chemical examiner could not confirm grouping
of blood on the knife and blood stained
garments of the deceased, Aqeeq Hussain
SHO, Police Station, Jungle Khel (PW-4)
stated that the recovered knife was “visibly
besmeared with blood” and F.C Zar Badshah
No.111 (PW-5), marginal witness to the
recovery memo (Ex.PW4/2), showed
presence of private persons at the time of
arrest of the appellant/accused, while the
seizing officer (PW-4) contradicted him by
saying that no private person, except the
police personnel was present at the time of
arrest of the accused. As such, the so-called
corroborative piece of evidence having been
shattered, as stated hereinabove, the
retracted confessional statement lost its
evidentiary value, if any, against the
appellant/accused, further making case
against the appellant/accused bereft of
incriminating evidence against him. In

view of above stated scenario there was
nothing on record to justify conviction of

appellant/accused.
8. Consequently, the appeal is accepted,
and the impugned judgment of the learned
trial Court as well as conviction and sentences
awarded to him are set aside. The appellant is
acquitted of the charge levelled against him by
the prosecution; and he be, accordingly, set

free, forthwith, if not required in any other

case.
Announced.
