JUDGMENT

aot

AHMAD ALI, J. Through the instant petition, the

accused-petitioner (Akhtar Khan), seeks his post
arrest bail in case FIR No.40/2019 dated 06.11.2019,
under sections 10/11 PECA 2016 r/w 109 PPC, PS,
FIA/CBC Peshawar,

2. Allegations against the petitioner are that he
was found involved in sharing broaden hate speech
and fake information against Government Institutions
of Pakistan through his facebook/twitter accounts.
After thorough investigation, FIR ibid was registered
against the accused. He is behind the bars in the
instant case since his arrest, hence the present petition
for bail.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties

heard and record perused.
4. Without dilating upon the merits of the case,
which may prejudice the case of either party during
trial, suffice it to say that the offences, for which the
petitioner is charged, are under sections 10 & 11 of the
Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, which are
punishable with imprisonment or fine or both, in the
circumstances the accused shall be entitled to bail as of
right because, if at the trial, he is only sentenced with fine,
the period as under trial prisoner due to refusal of bail

would amount to a case of ‘double jeopardy’. Reference is

made to the case of “Sher Ahmad Vs State reported in
PLD 1993 Peshawar 104 and “Ameer Ullah Vs the
State”__2012_P.Cr.L.J_1858. It is an established

principle that for the purposes of grant of bail, the
lesser sentence is taken into account. Reliance is
placed on case reported as "Mustafa Ali v. State"
(2014 P.Cr.L.J 1464), "Tariq Bashir v. The
State" (PLD 1995 SC 34) & “Muhammad Hayat
Khan Vs the State & another” (2019 P.Cr.L.J

472).

5. Even otherwise, the complaint in the instant
case was made after four months of the occurrence
which has taken place on 02.02.2019. The record
further reveals that under the identity created on

Social Media which purportedly is in the name of
the petitioner, material has been put up which is
though derogatory and anti-State and tantamount to
maligning the State Institutions and is deplorable,
however, the actual usage of the Social Media on
Facebook and Twitter etc. by petitioner is a question
of evidence which can only be done at the trial
stage, hence, the case against the petitioner is also
one of further inquiry as provided under Sub-Section

(2) of Section 497 Cr.P.C.

6. The accused-petitioner is no more required for
the purpose of investigation. Besides, there is nothing
on record regarding his previous involvement in such
like criminal activities coupled with the fact that he is
serving as a lecturer in the Abdul Wali Khan
University, which has also tilted scales of justice in
favour of bail rather than jail. Reliance can be safely
placed on 2012 SCMR 573.

7. Moreover, it has been held time and again by
the august Supreme Court that bail does not mean
acquittal of accused but only change of custody from
Government agencies to the sureties, who on
furnishing bonds take responsibility to produce the
accused whenever and wherever required to be

produced. Reliance could be placed on case reported
in 2008 SCMR 807 “Haji Muhammad Nazir Vs

State”.

8. Before parting with this order, this court finds it
necessary to mention that all the observations
recorded above are tentative assessment just for the
disposal of bail petition and not intended to influence
the mind of trial Court, which is free to appraise the
evidence strictly in accordance with law and merits of
the case and; as per law laid down in (1996 SCMR
1845).

9. In view of the forgoing discussion and on
tentative assessment of material available on record, a
case arguable for the grant of bail is made out
Resultantly, this petition is allowed and the accused-
petitioner, named above, is admitted to bail, provided
he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs.100,000/-
with two sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of learned IIlaqa Judicial/ Duty Magistrate
concerned, who shall ensure that the sureties are local,
reliable and men of means.

10. Above are the detailed reasons of short order of
even date.
