SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- This judgment shall dispose
of Cr.A. No.308-B of 2019, filed by Abdur Rehman against his
conviction and sentence, Cr.A. No.326-B of 2019, filed by Bibi
Asia against acquittal of accused Saira Parveen and the connected
Cr.R. No.62-B of 2019, filed by Bibi Asia for enhancement of
sentence awarded to convict Abdur Rehman. Since all the matters
have arisen out of one and same impugned judgment, therefore, I
intend to decide all the connected matters through this single

judgment.

2. The appellant and acquitted co-accused
Mst. Saira Parveen faced trial in sessions Case No.38/VII of

2018-19 before learned Sessions Judge, Karak and vide judgment
2
dated 10.10.2019, the appellant Abdur Rehman was convicted
under Section 324 PPC for attempting at the lives of complainant
Fazal Karim, injured Mst. Bibi Asia and Abid Karim, and was
sentenced to imprisonment for three years R.I. with fine of
Rs.20,000/- on three counts or in default thereof to undergo six
months S.I. He was also convicted under section 337-F(v) PPC
and sentenced to pay Rs.2,00,000/- as Daman to injured
Mst. Bibi Asia, to be paid in lump sum in equal monthly
installments during the remaining period of awarded sentence or
in default thereof, to be dealt with under section 337-Y(ii) PPC.
Benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. was extended to the
convict/appellant. Whereas, co-accused Mst. Saira Parveen was

acquitted of the charges.

3. The prosecution story as divulged from the first
information report (F.I.R.) Ex. PA, registered on the basis of
murasila Ex. PA/1, in brief, is that on 09.9.2016 at 18:25 hours,
complainant Fazal Karim alongwith his injured daughter
Mst. Bibi Ayesha/Bibi Asia (PW-7), made report to Qismat Khan
ASI (PW-9), in the Emergency Room of Civil Hospital, Karak, to
the effect that on the day of occurrence, his son Abid Karim
(PW-8) was going on a motorcycle to Chungi No.2, meanwhile,
accused Abdur Rehman intercepted him and started altercation,

upon which he came out of his house and asked the accused that
SS

what was wrong with him to which the accused replied that his
son was staring at him; that he (complainant) made him
understand but he became annoyed and voiced towards his
house for bringing the weapon, upon which his wife co-accused
Mst. Saira Parveen brought the weapon and handed it over to him
with which the accused started firing at his son, resultantly, his
daughter (PW-7), who by then came out of the house was hit on
her right thigh and sustained injury, whereas the complainant and
his son fortunately escaped unhurt. Besides the complainant, the
occurrence is stated to be witnessed by his son PW Abid Karim.
Motive.for the offence is stated to be an altercation prior to the

occurrence. Hence the FIR (ibid).

4. On completion of the investigation, complete
challan was submitted against the accused to the trial Court
where at the commencement of trial, the prosecution produced
and examined as many as eleven witnesses, whereafter, accused
were examined under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein they denied
the allegations and professed innocence, however, neither they
opted to be examined on oath in terms of Section 340(2), Cr.P.C.,
nor produced evidence in their defence. The learned trial Court
after hearing arguments of learned counsel for the parties vide
judgment impugned herein, convicted the appellant and

sentenced him, as mentioned in the earlier part of the judgment,

4
whereas co-accused Mst. Saira Parveen was acquitted of the
charges. The convict/appellant has preferred instant
criminal appeal against his conviction, while Bibi Asia has
moved Cr.A. No.326-B of 2019 against acquittal of
co-accused Mst. Saira Parveen, alongwith connected
Cr.R. No.62-B of 2019 for enhancement of sentence awarded to

the convict Abdur Rehman.

5. The learned counsel for the parties alongwith the
Addl: A.G. were heard at length and with their valuable

assistance, the record was gone through.

6. No doubt, for the incident in issue, the appellant is
singularly charged with no previous blood feud or animosity and
the substitution is a rare phenomenon, but this Court is to see as
to whether the incident happened in the manner as projected and
at the stated time. This Court is to see as to whether the
complainant came forward with the whole truth. Though the
learned trial court dealt with the matter comprehensively, yet, I
feel the need to reassess the collected evidence and statements
recorded, to ascertain as to whether the learned trial Court was

correct in its approach and that no other view was possible.

7. The unfortunate incident was stated to be the

outcome of an altercation between PW Abid Karim and the

appellant, which occurred a little earlier and explained by the
complainant while reporting the matter. The report tells that on
hearing commotion, the complainant came out of the house and
heard an exchange of hot words between the two and that on
inquiry the appellant disclosed that PW Fazal Karim was staring
at him: The prosecution is to prove as to whether the incident
occurred in the mode, manner and at the stated time. The
complainant could not be examined owing to his earlier death,
but instead PW Abid Karim alongwith injured appeared in
support of their claim. Abid Karim was examined as PW-8, who
stated that on the day of incident he was on his way to Chongi
No.2, when intercepted by the accused, after altercation the
accused demanded weapon from the house which was brought by
the co-accused and the appellant fired at them which resulted into
injury of Mst. Aysha Bibi. In the site plan, the witnesses are
given different points and so to the accused. The site plan was
prepared on pointation of the complainant which depicts that all
the three were standing together at the time of altercation, but
soon thereafter they receded to point 1A, 2A and 3A, respectively.
It was further disclosed that when the appellant approached point
No.3A;-he was provided with a Kalashnikov by the co-accused,
who then fired at the complainant and PW Abid Karim, which hit

the injured PW, who by then after leaving her house had reached

to point No.4. The prosecution is yet to explain that when the
complainant and PW Abid Karim had already receded to point
1A and 2A, what kept the injured moving to reach the allotted
place and that why instead, Abid Karim with whom the appellant
had an axe to grind, Mst. Aysha was targeted. The complainant
while reporting the matter disclosed that after gaining possession
of the. weapon, the appellant started firing at them. The
complainant disclosed that the firing continued till the victim
came out of the house and received the injury. We are yet to
know that how within seconds the situation worsened to an extent
that the appellant was all out to kill. I am still searching for an
answer that despite weapon in possession, how the complainant
and his son escaped unhurt. The witnesses contradicted each
other on material aspects of the case. The injured was examined
as PW-7, who stated that burst firing was made, whereas
according to complainant the firing was sporadic. If I accept what
the injured stated, then this Court is to believe that the appellant
after firing the initial rounds did not keep on firing, and if the
complainant is to be believed, then what a courage the lady had
to walk towards the appellant and for what purpose. PW-7 stated
that after receiving firearm injury, the complainant without loss
of time put her in a motorcar and left for the hospital, but her

stance was contradicted by PW Abid Karim in the following

7
words “After hitting of my sister, I at once rushed towards my
house while my father also came to the house. After 4/5 minutes
we came out of our house and attended the injured”, but the
injured stated otherwise, “After sustaining injury I laid down on
the ground and my father took me in his laps”. When both the
witnesses are read together, it leaves no room to doubt that they
fully contradicted each other. What impression can be gathered
from, is that PW Abid Karim was not present at the stated time,
had he been present on the spot, he would have attended the
injured instead of rushing to the house and attending the injured
after 4/5 minutes of the occurrence. It does not appeal to a
prudent mind that a real father and real brother would leave their
daughter and sister unattended by taking shelter in the house. The
prosecution is still to answer that why PW Abid Karim did not
accompany the injured to the hospital alongwith his father and
that why he did not verify the report. The Investigating Officer
visited the spot and on pointation of the complainant the site plan
was prepared and nothing has been mentioned regarding presence
of the eyewitness i.e. PW Abid Karim at the spot. Had he been
present on the spot at the time of spot inspection, the
Investigating Officer would have mentioned his name as well.

In case titled “Basharat Ali Vs. Muhammad

Safdar and another” (2017 SCMR 1601), it was held that:-

“Keeping in view the above bulk of
contradictions in the statements of the
PWs., the prosecution's story cannot be
believed and that too when the same has
been disbelieved to the extent of all the
acquitted co-accused as such Respondent
No.1 has rightly been acquitted by the
High Court through the impugned
judgment. In criminal cases if material
contradictions are found in the statements
of the witnesses the benefit thereof would
go to the accused party. Resultantly, this
appeal, having no merit, is hereby
dismissed”.

8. . The incident occurred at 18:25 hours, whereas. the
matter was reported in the emergency room of Civil Hospital
Karak at 19:30 hours and the injured was examined by the doctor
at 7:15 PM. The prosecution is to tell that who accompanied the
injured to the hospital and that what time the injured arrived to
the hospital. Two of the witnesses confirmed that the injured
reached to the hospital at 6:30 PM. It surprises that why the
report was delayed till 19:30 hours and that how the injured was
examined at 7:15 PM, the time when no report was made and
injury sheet prepared. The prosecution is to tell that who out of
the two i.e. the doctor or the scribe was telling a lie. The doctor
was examined as PW-4, who stated that the injured was brought
by the father and denied to receive the injury sheet at the time of
examination of the injured in the following manner, “On
09.9.2016 the injured Aisha aged about 17 years daughter of
Fazal ‘Karim resident of Chungi Karak accompanied by her

father Fazal Karim was brought before me at 7:15 PM”. The

9
doctor was cross-examined on this particular aspect of the case to
know as to whether the injured was escorted by a constable
alongwith the injury sheet, the doctor explained as, “The injured
was brought at 7:15 PM. We only receive injury sheet alongwith
the injured from police. It is correct that the column pertaining to
number and date of police docket/constable is blank”. The scribe
was examined as PW-9, who contradicted to what the doctor
stated, the relevant portion of his cross-examination reads as,
“When I reached Civil Hospital, the injured was lying in the
emergency ward. When I handed over the injury sheet to the
doctor, then the medical examination of the injured was started”.
If I admit what the scribe stated, then by the time when the
injured was examined no report was made and no injury sheet
was prepared. The doctor further surprised when she stated,
“At the time of preparation of MLC report the injured was not
present”. The explanation given by the doctor casts serious
doubts regarding examination of injured by the doctor and it is
still to be answered that how in the absence of the injured the
Medico-legal Certificate could be prepared. The matter does not
end here, rather the prosecution is still to tell that why the injured
did not report the matter and that why it was the father who opted
for the same, despite the fact that the injured was fully conscious

and such is her statement, “J know senses/conscious and
10
unconsciousness. I was in my senses in the Hospital”. The
dishonesty of the scribe is evident when he stated, “The injured

was unconscious at the time of report by her father”.

9. The Investigating Officer visited the spot and
collected five empties of 7.62 bore which were allegedly sent to
the Forensic Science Laboratory to ascertain as to whether the
same were fired from one and the same weapon. It is pertinent to
mention that the Investigating Officer wrote an application to the
concerned authorities in that respect on 17.9.2016, whereas the
same were received to the laboratory on 10.11.2016, with the
delay of two months. The Investigating Officer is yet to explain
that why the application was not written on the date when the
empties were collected and that why the empties were not sent
there and then. Though the report of Chemical Examiner is in
positive, but the record is silent regarding its safe custody in the
intervening period. This was essential for the prosecution, more
particularly, for the Investigating Officer to examine Moharrir of
the concerned Police Station alongwith the official who took the
same to the laboratory for its analysis but none of them was
examined and this laxity on the part of the Investigating Officer
travels deep to the roots of the prosecution case and as such, this
piece of evidence cannot be taken into consideration and is

outrightly rejected. The situation has further been clarified by the

11

apex Court in its case titled “Ghulam Akbar and another Vs.

The State” (2008 SCMR-1064.

10. So far as abscondence in the instant case is
concerned, it is not denied that abscondence alone cannot be a
substitute for real evidence because people do abscond though
falsely charged in order to save themselves from agony of
protracted trial and also to avoid duress and torture at the hands
of police. In the instant case, abscondence is meaningless,
because it can neither remove defects of the oral evidence, nor is
by itself sufficient to bring guilt home to the accused. Ref:
“Muhammad Sadiq Vs. State” (2017 SCMR 144). Needless to
say that abscondence is a corroborative piece of evidence and in
cases where direct evidence fails, corroborative piece of

evidence is of no avail and the present case is no exception.

11. There is no denial to the fact that the co-accused
has been acquitted of the charges which has been questioned
before this Court through Cr.A. No.326-B of 2019, where the
learned counsel for the complainant submitted that the findings
of the trial Court are based on conjectures and surmises and that
the learned trial Court went in error while acquitting the accused
who shared common intention with the appellant. It was further

submitted that it was the co-accused who provided the appellant

12
with the Kalashnikov which resulted into the injury on person of
the vicfim, had she not provided the weapon, the result would
have been otherwise. True, that the co-accused has been
acquitted of the charges and equally true that she is charged for
sharing common intention, but the prosecution could not succeed
in proving the charges against the acquitted accused, as
nothing was brought on record that it was no one else but
Mst. Saira Parveen, who provided the Kalashnikov. The record
is silent regarding the presence of the respondent before the
firing was made and at the time of altercation. The Investigating
Officer, who prepared the site plan on pointation of the
complainant did not mention presence of the co-accused at the
scene of occurrence and even no substantial evidence was
produced on record that either she had nexus with the motive or
that the situation was such which compelled her to facilitate her
husband, rather in such eventuality, she instead of providing a
Kalashnikov to kill, would have restrained the appellant to go to
such an extent, as it is nothing but natural that women folk, more
particularly, a wife in all possibilities would avoid misfortunes
to her family. As the accused has been acquitted of the charges
and she earned the presumption of double innocence to her

credit,-so to upset the same extraordinary circumstances are

13
needed which are lacking in the instant case. The instant

criminal appeal is bereft of merit stands dismissed.

12. The cumulative effect of what has been stated
above, leads this Court nowhere but to hold that the prosecution
could not succeed in bringing home guilt against the appellant
and the evidence produced suffers from inherent defects and
lacking confidence, in such eventuality, this Court is fully
convinced that the appellant has been succeeded in making out a
case for indulgence of this Court. Resultantly, the appeal in hand
is allowed, the conviction and sentences awarded to the
appellant are set-aside and he is acquitted of the charges levelled
against him. As the appellant is on bail, therefore, his sureties
are discharged from the liability of bail bond. As the appeal

against conviction has succeeded, so the criminal revision for

JUDGE

enhancement of sentence has lost its efficacy, is dismissed.
