criminal appeal, the appellant Sameen Khan has impugned the order

dated 23.02.2015, passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-
i

—-ViSudge Special Court, Nowshera, whereby the petition for the

‘release of Truck bearing Registration No. C-9258 on Superdari was

refused.

2. Brief facts of the case are that the Truck bearing
registration No. C-9258 was taken into custody by the local police
after recovery of charas weighing 94 Killograms and accused

Fazalullah was arrested vide case FIR No. 47/2010 under section 9

&
(C) CNSA 1/w 2(S) 16, 156(1) (8) (89) Customs Act, 1969, Police
Station Customs Investigation and Prosecution Branch, Customs
House’ Peshawar. The Jeamed Special Court Nowshera on
conclusion of trial convicted the accused -Fazalullah, declared co-
accused Muhammad Tariq as proclaimed offender and ordered that
‘the case property including the Truck in question shall remain intact
till the arrest of absconding co-accused, while on appeal the sentence
of accused Fazalullah was reduced to already under gone. The

320% Court, Noshera, which was refused on 23.02.2015, hence, the instant

appeal.

3. ‘Learned counsel for the appellant argued that he is

bonafide purchaser of the truck in question and is tlus ostensible

owner who has no connection with the commission of alleged crime.

He further argued that there is no other rival claimant of the same.

He went on to say that the condition of Truck is deteriorating day by
v | day. He further added that it is not known as to when the absconding

accused Tariq would surrender or arrested for which the Truck

Sener
cannot be kept in custody for indefinite period. He lastlv argued that
the Truck in question is the only source of income for the appellant
and his family and he shall undertake to produce the same before the
Court as and when required, if given the truck on Superdari to him.

4. . 7 : On the other hand learned State counsel opposing the
arguments advanced by learned counsel for appellant contended that

huge quantity of narcotics has been recovered from the Truck and

+ co-accused Tariq is still! absconding and is the case property. He

including the Truck shall remain intact till the arrest and trial of

absconding co-accused Tariq. He further argued that ownership of

appellant is not above board, hence, he is not entitled for release of

Truck on Superdary to him.

5. : Arguments heard and record perused.

6. ; Perusal of the record reveals that admittedly two
me accused namely Fazalullah and Tariq have been charged for

transporting the huge quantity of narcotics from Peshawar to down
area through Truck in question. During trial one of the accused

namely Fazalullah has been convicted and. co-accused Muhammad
Tariq has been declared as proclaimed offender and the case
property including the Truck was ordered to be kept intact till the
arrest of absconding co-accused, while on appeal the sentence of
accused Fazalullah was reduced to already under gone. In given
situation, section 74 of the Control of ‘Narcotics Substances Act
provides a bar on release of any such vehicle, which is reproduced as
under:

“74, Application of other laws-If an offence
T STE Binishable under this Act is also an offence in any

XAMINER other law for the time being in force, nothing in that

hawar High Cour,

29 FER 26 faw shalt prevent the offender from being punished

under this act:

Provided that nothing contained in section 523

of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of

1989), or any other provisions of the said Code or any

other law for time being in force, the custody of

narcotic production or manufacture of such drugs or

A. substances or any conveyance used in import, export
¥ . transport or transshipment thereof or for commission
of an offence under this act, shall not be given on

custody to the accused or any of his associate or

( relative or any private individual till the conclusion of

_ the case.”
7. Perusal of above provision of law provides that, where
trial is pending and it is yet to be decided whether said vehicle was
liable for confiscation or otherwise and any conveyance used in
transportation of narcotics, shall not be given in custody to the
accused or any of his associate or relative or any private individual
"till the conclusion of the case. As in the instant case huge quantity of
narcotics has been recovered from the Truck in question, the co-
accused Tariq is still absconding and the trial against him has not yet

been concluded and further the appellant is father of accused

8. os | Moreover, the appellant alleged in his application that

he is bonafide purchaser of the Truck in question, but he has not

annexed any lawful proof in this respect. Iqrarnama placed on file

wn shows that the same has been purchased by his son Fazalullah who
s was accused in the instant case and transfer letter placed on record
Ue also shows the name of origirial owner namely Sardar Hussain,
whereas no name of purchaser has been mentioned in it, hence, the

appellant cannot be termed as owner of the vehicle unless declared

so by competent court of law. The appellant has failed to establish
his ownership as well, hence, he is not entitled for custody of Truck
on Superdari.
‘For the reasons discussed above, the instant appeal
being bereft of merits is dismissed.
