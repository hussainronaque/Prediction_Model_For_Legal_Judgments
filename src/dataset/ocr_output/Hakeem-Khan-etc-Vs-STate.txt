JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, _J.- This

common judgment shall dispose of the instant bail petition,
filed by petitioners 1. Hakeem Khan, and 2. Seraj as well
as connected Cr.Misc.BA No.1785-P/2015, filed by
petitioner Mst. Shazia, as both are arising out of one and
the same FIR No.305 dated 17.08.2015, registered under
sections 302/109/34 PPC and S.15 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Arms Act, 2013, wherein the petitioners are charged for
committing the murder of Mst. Rihayat Bibi with firearms.
2. Arguments heard and record perused.

3. This untoward incident took place on
17.08.2015 at 11.00 hours, inside the house of the
Mst. Rihayat Bibi deceased, situated in village Adizai.
None of the petitioners is charged in the initial report.

Neither complainant nor anybody else has come forward to

furnish the ocular account of the incident. Petitioners were
nominated as accused by complainant Arab Khan in his
statement recorded under section 164 Cr.P.C. on
03.09.2015, after a delay of about 16 days. The source of
the basis of which he got satisfied qua complicity of the
petitioners in the commission of offence, has not been
disclosed by him. None of the petitioners has confessed
their guilt before competent court of law. No incriminating
evidence whatsoever is available at this stage to connect
the petitioners with the commission of the offence. The
authenticity and evidentiary value of a corroborative piece
of evidence in the shape of recovery of 7 MM rifle as a
crime weapon, allegedly recovered on the pointation of
female petitioner Mst. Shazia on 04.09.2015, from the
crime room, after a delay of about 17 days, despite visit of
the said room by the I.O. on the very first day of the
incident, is yet to be determined during trial in light of
other circumstances of the case. On tentative assessment of
the material available on record, reasonable grounds exist
which make the case of the petitioners arguable for the
purpose of bail. Besides, petitioner Mst. Shazia, as per her
medical examination on 04.09.2015, was conceived of
seven months, so on this ground too, as per the dictum laid

down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled,

“Mst. Nusrat Vs the State” (1996 SCMR 973), she is
entitled to be released on bail.

4. For the reasons discussed above, both the
petitions are allowed. Accused/petitioners are admitted to
bail, provided each one of them furnishes bail bonds to the
tune of Rs.3,00,000/- with two local, reliable and
resourceful sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of learned IIlaqa Judicial Magistrate/MOD,
concerned.

Announced
28.10.2015.

7. For what has been discussed above, Suo motu

notice given to accused Shakir stands withdrawn. He is

admitted to bail on already existing bail bonds, on merits.
Since this court has already directed expeditious
conclusion of trial while dealing with the bail petition of
co-accused Farman, therefore, office is directed to send the
record to the quarter concerned within two days, positively.
