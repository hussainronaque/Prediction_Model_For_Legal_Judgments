IKRAMULLAH KHAN, J.- On the allegation that petitioner
had illegally invested the General Provident Investment Fund
and Pension Fund in risky business of Stock Exchange
Commission of Pakistan, the Bureau of Ehtesab Commission
initiated an inquiry against the petitioner under the Provisions
of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ehtesab Commission Act, 2014. In
this regard, Call-up notice was issued to the petitioner in term
of section 13 (b) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ehtesab
Commission Act, 2014. Petitioner apprehending his arrest
instead of participating in the proposed inquiry filed the
instant constitutional petition with the following prayer:-

“On acceptance of this Writ Petition, may
kindly hold, direct and declare:-

(i) That after closure of the case by

National Accountability Bureau after
extensive probe and Final Inquiry
against the petitioner, now the
initiation of afresh inquiry, probe and
investigation by the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Ehtesab Commission on
the same allegations is _ illegal,
overlapping, harassment, without
lawful authority, without jurisdiction,
abinitio void and said afresh enquiry,
probe and investigations are liable to

be set aside and quashed;

(ii) That the respondents No.1 to 5 (i.e.
Khyber Ehtesab Commission) should
also refrain from arresting/detaining,
humiliating and harassing _ the

petitioner; and

(iii) Any other remedy and _ relief,
considered just and appropriate in
favour of the _ petitioner, not
specifically prayed may also be
granted, if deemed fit and appropriate

in the circumstances of the case.

2. Learned counsel for petitioner based his whole

arguments in order to get the desired relief on the following
grounds:-

A. That the matter in issue had already been

inquired, investigated by a competent

Agency (NAB), whereby, the petitioner
was exonerated and the inquiry was closed
/ dropped;

B. — That no person shall by twice punished for
the same allegations;

C. That initiation of 2" inquiry by Ehtesab
Commission on _ allegation already
investigated by NAB is _ illegal,
unconstitutional, malafide, whimsical,
capricious, arbitrary and abuse of power;

D. That initiation of inquiry by the Ehtesab
Commission against the petitioner is
violation of constitutional rights of
petitioner guaranteed under Articles, 4, 9,
10A, 13, 18 and 25 of the Constitution of
Pakistan, 1973;

E. That respondents could not initiate fresh or
2" inquiry against the petitioner in view of
explicit bar envisaged thereunder section

403 Cr.P.C.

3. Respondents were put on notice, they filed their
comments, whereby, raised numerous legal objections over
the maintainability of the writ petition. While learned DPG
appearing on behalf of Ehtesab Commission argued that the
petition in hand is pre-mature only call up notice has served

upon the petitioner in order to record his statement and the
commission has not yet decided to make the petitioner an
accused or launch prosecution, however, petitioner is bound to
appear before the concern authority in order to facilitate the
inquiry and as a right, defend his acts, if he so desire, while
the closure of investigation by NAB or even any finding in
regard to innocence of petitioner by no stretch of imagination
attract either the provisions of Article-13 of the Constitution
of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 or the provisions

contained in section 403 Cr.P.C.

4. We have heard learned counsel for the parties in

light of law and facts on available record.

5. The record reveals that petitioner was served
with call up notice dated 30.6.2016 in order to procure his
attendance before Ehtesab Commission but petitioner did not
avail the opportunity to appear in person before the
commission, however, made representation through its duly
nominated representative and the respondents issued a
questionnaire to petitioner, in order to know the contention of
the petitioner insofar as the allegations in regard to illegal
investment of public fund in risky business was concerned.
The record further reveals that petitioner was Chief Executive
of Pearl Securities Limited and he was the person, exclusively
empowered to invest the Government money, which the

petitioner invested in his own establishment, being Financial
Advisor appointed by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Government

for the purpose of the above mentioned funds.

6. Prior to resolve the legal proposition raised by
both the parties, we would like to express our opinion at this
stage, to refrain ourselves to discuss and give any findings in
regard to the allegations or subject matter of inquiry, initiated
against the petitioner by respondents less it would prejudice
case of either party, however, we confine ourselves only to
answer, the proposition of law agitated by petitioner, in order
to set aside the process of inquiry initiated by respondents

Ehtesab Commission.

7. The provisions contained in section-22 of the
NAB Ordinance, 1999 (NAB Ordinance) confers exclusive
jurisdiction upon the Chairman NAB to inquire into and
investigate any suspected offence, which appears to him on
reasonable grounds to involve an offence under the NAB
Ordinance, while clause (h) of section (18) of the NAB
Ordinance, empowers the Chairman NAB or Deputy
Chairman NAB or any other authorized officer in this regard,
if a complaint is inquired into and investigated by NAB and it
is concluded that the complaint received was prima facie,
frivolous or has been filed with intent to malign or defame
any person, may refer the matter to the court and if the

complainant is found guilty, he shall be punished with
imprisonment for a term, which may extend to one year or

fine or with both.

8. We thoroughly perused the record and also
confronted learned counsel for petitioner that whether the
provisions contained in clause (h) of section 18 of the NAB
Ordinance is complied with before closing the inquiry by the
NAB but there was no satisfactory answer from him and even
no any court order is available on record that the provision of
section 18 (h) of the NAB Ordinance had followed while

exonerating the petitioner.

9. The provisions contained in sub-section (c) of
section-9 of the NAB Ordinance explicitly and in
unambiguous terms explain that “if after completing the
investigation of an offence against a holder of public office or
any other person, the Chairman NAB is satisfied that no
prima facie case is made out against him and the case may be
closed, the Chairman NAB shall refer the matter to the
concern court for approval and for the release of the accused,

if in custody”.

10. Keeping in view the above mentioned provision
of law, that if a person (public office holder or any other
person) against whom, the NAB, thereafter inquiry or
investigation, as the case may be, had closed its inquiry or

investigation in regard to a specific allegation or had found
the complaint, if any, false in both eventualities, the Chairman
NAB or other authorized person, shall place the
report/findings of such inquiry or investigation before the
Accountability Court and it would the court to discharge an
accused and to close the inquiry. In such an eventuality, the
provisions contained in section 403 Cr.P.C. as well as the
provisions contained in Article-13 of the Constitution of
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 shall apply to save, such
an accused from double jeopardy while mere initiation of
inquiry and its closure by a person not competent to do so,
could not resolve an accused from his responsibility to be
inquired into, serious allegations of financial loss to the
exchequer. The provisions contained in section 403 Cr.P.C, if
reproduced would be read as:-

“S.403.___ Persons once convicted _ or
acquitted _not_to_be_tried_for_the same
offence. (1) A person who has once been
tried by a Court of competent jurisdiction
for an offence and convicted or acquitted of
such offence shall, while such conviction or
acquittal remains in force, not to be liable to
be tried again for the same offence, nor on
the same facts for any other offence for
which a different charge from the one made
against him might have been made under
section 36, or for which he might have been

convicted under section 237.
(2) A person acquitted or convicted for
any offence may be afterwards tried for any
distinct offence for which a separate charge
might have been made against him on the
former trial under sections 235, subsection
(1).

(3) A person convicted of any offence
constituted by any act causing consequences
which together with such act, constituted a
different offence from that of which he was
convicted, may be afterwards tried for such
last-mentioned offence, if the consequence
had not happened, or were not happened, or
were not known to the Court to have
happened, at the time when he was
convicted.

(4) A person acquitted or convicted of
any offence constituted by any acts may,
notwithstanding such acquittal or
conviction, be subsequently charged with,
and tried for any other offence constituted
by the same acts which he may have
committed if the Court by which he was first
tried was not competent to try the offence
with which he is subsequently charged.

(5) Nothing in this section shall affect the
provision of section 26 of the General
Clauses Act, 1897, or section 188 of this
Code.

11. And likewise, the provisions of Article-13 of the

Constitution, if reproduced would be read as under:-
“Article-13. Protection against double

punishment and _ self-incrimination. No

person-

(a)

shall be prosecuted or punished for

the same offence more than once; or

(b) — shall, when accused of an offence, be
compelled to be a witness against
himself.”

12. The letter dated 2.7.2014 communicated to the

petitioner by the NAB, reads as:-

The subject case was inquired against under the provisions
of National Accountability Ordinance (NAO)1999, on
following allegation (s):-

“TIlegally, invested General Provident Investment Fund &
Pension Fund amount in risky businesses and caused loss to
Exchequer”

Based on the findings of Final Inquiry Report and the
recommendation of RBM held on 27" June, 2014, the

13. The above mentioned letter by no stretch of
imagination be considered as an legal instrument as there is no
description of approval of the court to close the inquiry
against the petitioner, while once a case is inquired or
investigated, as the case may be, it would be closed in term of
section 9 (c) of the NAB Ordinance by the Accountability

Court.

14. The provisions contained in section 35 of the
Ehtesab Commission have no any bearing on instant case as
Ehtesab Commission is independently sanctioned the inquiry
against the petitioner while no any other inquiry is pending
with NAB at the moment. For convenience, we have to
reproduce, sub-section 3 of section 35 of the KPK Ehtesab
Commission Act, 2014 which reads as:-

“If jurisdiction over the inquiry or
investigation of a suspected offence is
assumed by an agency of the Federal
Government, the Director General shall
meet with the relevant officers of such
agency and determine whether the
Commission or such agency has proper
jurisdiction over the matter; provided that in
making such determination, the Director
General shall take into regard the following

factors:
11

(a)The stage of inquiry or investigation
being conducted by the Commission at
the time of assumption of jurisdiction by
Federal Agency;

(b) Territorial location from where evidence
has been collected during the inquiry or
investigation; and

(c)Place of residence of prosecution
witnesses who are to testify against the

accused.

While sub-section-4 of section-35 of the ibid Act, read as:-

“Following a determination based on the
factors mentioned in sub-section (3), the
Director General shall make a
recommendation to such agency of the
Federal Government with regard to exercise
of jurisdiction over the matter in the interest
of effective prosecution and _ crime
prevention and the decision of the agency of
the Federal Government in the matter shall

be final and binding.

15. As discussed hereinabove, there is no inquiry or
investigation pending before the NAB, therefore, the
provisions of sub-section 3 and 4 of section 35 of the Ehtesab
Act, having no bearing on inquiry initiated by Ehtesab
Commission against petitioner.

16. To summarize the legal proposition, the KPK
Ehtesab Commission is not restricted by any provisiona of

law either by NAB Ordinance or KPK Ehtesab Commission
12

Act, 2014 to inquire or investigate matters, which is not
pending before any Federal Agency, however, in case of
inquiry by both Federal and Provincial Agencies, at the same
time the provisions of section 35 (3) of the Ehtesab Act, 2014
shall come into play. While sub-section (1) of section 35 of
the Ehtesab Act, 2014 confers exclusive jurisdiction upon the
Director General to order an inquiry or investigation into any
incident or an act or omission of a person or accused that
reasonably appears to constitute an offence under the Ehtesab

Act, 2014.

17. For the reasons mentioned hereinabove, this
petition having no merits stands dismissed, accordingly.

Announced.
Dated: 06.02.2018.
