IRSHAD ALI SHAH - J;- It is
alleged that the applicant with one more culprit obtained rupees Fifty Lacs
from complainant Ahsanullah for appointment of his son Tufail Ahmed in public
service and on account of their failure to do the needful, they returned such
amount in shape of cheques and cash of rupees Ten Lacs, those cheques were
bounced when were presented before the bank having jurisdiction, subsequently,
they also stole Car of the complainant, for that the present case was
registered. 
2.         The applicant
on having been refused post arrest bail by learned             Additional
Sessions Judge, Ratodero, has sought for the same from this Court by way of
instant application u/s 497 Cr.PC.
3.         It is
contended by learned counsel for the applicant that the applicant being
innocent has been involved in this case falsely by the complainant, otherwise
he has nothing to do with the alleged incident. By contending so, he sought for
release of the applicant on bail on point of further inquiry.
4.         Learned Addl.P.G
for the State and learned counsel for the complainant have opposed to release
of the applicant on bail by contending that he is vicariously liable for the
commission of incident. 
5.         I have considered the
above arguments and perused the record. 
6.         The FIR of the incident
has been lodged with delay of about 16 months and such delay having not been
explained plausibly could not be overlooked. No cheque is issued by the
applicant in person. The offence alleged against the applicant is not falling
within prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.PC. The case has finally been
challaned and there is no allegation of tampering with evidence on the part of
applicant. In these circumstances, a case for grant of bail to the applicant on
point of further inquiry obviously is made out. 
7.         In view of above, the
applicant is admitted to bail subject to his furnishing solvent surety in the
sum Rs.30,000/- and P.R bonds in the like amount, to the satisfaction of the
learned trial Court. 
8.          The instant
criminal bail application is disposed of accordingly.                    

                                                                                                     JUDGE
