JUDGMENT

RKEKK

SHAHID KHAN, J. The appellant (Abdur

Rahim) has called in question the judgment
of learned Additional Sessions Judge/Child
Protection Court/Judge, Juvenile Court,
Peshawar, dated 16.03.2022, delivered in
case FIR No.1128 dated 17.11.2019 u/s 366
PPC 50/53 Child Protection & Welfare Act,
Police Station, Tehkal, (Peshawar), whereby
he was convicted and sentenced as under: -
U/s 377-PPC read with 377-B PPC &
53 Child Protection & Welfare Act, 2018,
for a period of five years (05) SI with fine of
Rs. 10,00,000/- (Ten lac) or 06 (Six) months

SI in default with benefit of section 382-B
Cr.P.C. However, on completion of three
(03) years of sentence of imprisonment, the
remaining two (02) years period of
imprisonment would be suspended as per
Section 15-C of JJSA, 2018, subjected to
good conduct on probation on furnishing
bonds to the sum of Rs:50,000/- to the
satisfaction of Probation Officer.

2. Facts in small compass are that
complainant Mst. Zarghuna reported the event to
the local police in terms that on the fateful date,
day & time, her daughter Manahil, aged about
04 years went out for playing, however, on her
return as weeping to home at 11:00 hours and on
query she complained of pain on her stomach.
She opted for urination but was weeping of
feeling severe pain in her stomach. The
complainant while changing her clothes, noticed
the sign & symptoms of rape with her minor
daughter. She was shifted to hospital for medical
aid and the event was registered through proper
FIR against the unknown person.

3. On the next day, on due satisfaction

that the child victim is competent enough to
record her statement, she was produced before
the Judicial Magistrate and after due
satisfaction, her statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C,
whereof, the appellant-accused, Abdur Rahim
was nominated for the commission of offence.
4. After collection of the requisite
evidence, substantive, circumstantial & medical
followed by completion of investigation,
complete challan against the appellant-accused
was drawn and sent up for trial to the Court of
competent jurisdiction/Child Protection
Court/Judge Juvenile Court/Addl: Sessions
Judge, Peshawar.

5. Appellant-accused put his
appearance before the learned trial Court and
copies of the evidence (oral & documentary)
were delivered u/s 265-C Cr.P.C. The accused
was formally charged u/s 376/337-B PPC read
with 53 Child Protection & Welfare Act, 2010,
however, it was altered as u/s 377/377-B PPC
read with 53 Child Protection & Welfare Act,
2010, to which he did not plead guilty and
claimed trial. The prosecution, in order to prove
its case against the appellant, examined 11 PWs.

Thereafter, the appellant-accused was examined
under section 342, Cr.P.C, wherein he professed
innocence and false implication. After hearing
the arguments, the learned trial Court convicted
and sentenced the appellant-accused as
mentioned above vide impugned judgment dated
16.03.2022.

6. Learned counsel for the appellant-
accused is focal & consistent on the preposition
that the story of the prosecution is based on the
account of a minor/child victim and on face of
the record the same being not confidence
inspiring, therefore, the learned trial Court while
placing reliance on the subject evidence has
fallen in error. Added, there is no tangible
evidence to boost & support the version of the
minor child/alleged victim and to base
conviction on the solitary statement of a child
witness is unwise. The victim being well
conversant to the appellant-accused as her next
door neighbor, not to disclose his name &
identity at the very first instance is Mystery and
the learned trial Court to place reliance on the
same has fallen in error. Further added, to
nominate the appellant-accused for the

commission of offence after due delay speak
about the consultation & deliberation, as such, it
reduced the intrinsic worth of the very first step
of the subject event. Also added, drafting of
Murasila in the hospital, KTH, followed by its
transmission to P.S Tehkal being against the
prevailing practice also speak of the malafide on
part of the investigation agency. Likewise,
knowingly, the appellant-accused is a juvenile
and opt to produce him before the ordinary
Court also speak of malafide of the investigation
agency. The learned trial Court has fallen in
error to rely upon the dishonest investigation
and the evidence so collected in this regard.
Further added, the learned trial Court was
conscious of the dishonest improvement made
by the victim during the trial and it also amounts
to erroneous conclusion of trial of the appellant-
accused. The case of the prosecution is full of
surmises & conjectures coupled with the
evidence so collected is full of contradictions,
therefore, the learned trial Court has fallen in
error to place reliance on the evidence not of the
standard to be relied upon. Concluded, the
appellant-accused deserve as a matter of right

the benefit of the contradictions & omissions in
the case of the prosecution and the learned trial
Court while reliance on the same has fallen in
error, as such, on acceptance of the appeal in
hand the appellant-accused deserve acquittal.

7. As against it, the learned AAG
assisted by private counsel for the complainant
argued that the circumstantial evidence coupled
with the medical evidence and above all the
substantive evidence boost & support each
other. During the investigation involvement of
the accused facing trial in the commission of
offence did surface and the evidence so
furnished as account of victim Manahil as PW-4
followed by her mother Mst. Zarghuna
(complainant) as PW-5 have nominated the
appellant-accused for the commission of the
offence. Added, the medical evidence
substantiated that minor-victim Manahil was
subjected to illicit act and no good ground does
exist to substitute the actual culprit for the
appellant-accused. The appellant-accused being
the next door neighbor, therefore, question of
misidentification or false implication does not
arise at all. The circumstantial evidence as

garments of the victim coupled with the medical
evidence boost & support the prosecution’s case
and the learned trial Court on due appraisal of
facts & circumstances coupled with the evidence
so furnished during the trial, has arrived at the
just conclusion of the event. The appellant-
accused has rightly been found guilty followed
by his conviction.

8. The learned trial Court has
appraised the oral evidence so furnished by the
prosecution, whereof, neither material
contradictions nor infirmity has been surfaced
which could be made as base of an even slight
doubt to the set of allegations confronted the
appellant-accused.

9. The oral evidence finds its positive
support from the circumstantial evidence as
garments of the victim coupled with the medical
evidence as its speak loud & clear of act of
sodomy has been committed with the child
victim.

10. For what has been discussed above,
the Court has arrived at the conclusion that
impugned judgment of the learned trial Court is
based on proper appraisal of facts &

circumstances coupled with the evidence so
recorded. It does not suffer from any illegality,
irregularity, misreading or non-reading of
evidence, therefore, does not need any
interference of this Court. Resultantly, the
subject appeal, being bereft of merits, stands
dismissed.
