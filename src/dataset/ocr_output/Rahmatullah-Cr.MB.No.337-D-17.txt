JUDGEMENT

Date of hearing: 10.11.2017.
Appellant-petitioner by M/S Saifur Rehman Khan, Muhammad

Abid and Faroog Akhtar Khan Advocates.

Respondent by Mr. Adnan Ali Khan A.A.G

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- Through this single order I am
proceeding to decide the instant Cr. MBA.No.337-D/2017, filed by
the petitioner Rahmatullah and the connected Cr.MBA.No.338-
D/2017, filed by the petitioner Rafiullah as both have sprung out
of one and the same case crime report No.13 dated 26.4.2017
registered under Sections 324/353/148/149 PPC read with
Sections 3/4/5 of the Explosive Substances Act/ 7 of Anti-
Terrorism Act, 1997 and 15 of Arms Act at Police Station C.T.D,

D.I.Khan.

2. Prosecution case, as set forth in the crime report, is
that on 26.4.2017 at 1130 hours, complainant Salimullah Khan,
SHO Police Station Gomal University, D.I.Khan alongwith

Sajawal Khan ASHO and other police officials including QRF and

Imran/*
-2-

staff of Police Lines, carried out search and strategic operation in
the area, and after performing their duty, they were coming back
towards the police station via Jhauk Ladho to Kat Shahani.
Wilayat Khan DFC, Constable Javed Iqbal, Constable Mazhar and
Constable Muhammad Ramzan were aheard of them on two
motorcycles, while the remaining police nafri was coming behind
them in official vehicle, when they reached on metaled road Kat
Shahani near graveyard, atl130 hours, they saw six unknown
terrorists, who were present on the road side and had parked their
motorcycles there. On seeing the police coming near towards
them, they started indiscriminate firing, as a result of which
Wilayat Khan DFC and Constable Javed Iqbal received firearm
injuries. Resultantly, the police party also opened fires in self
defence, which continued for quite some time. The terrorists also
threw hand grenades on the police party. Out of six terrorists, four
fled away by taking advantage of nearby bushes and shrubs while
the remaining two continued their firing by taking refugee near the
tube-well belonging to one Salim. On their demand, army
personnel, QRF and CTD staff with APC attracted to the spot
alongwith other vehicles, ultimately, both the terrorists blew
themselves. One 9 MM pistol with fitted magazine and 05 live
cartridges with one live hand grenade was recovered from one of
the terrorists while one 9 MM pistol with fitted magazine and 14

live rounds were recovered from the second one. The three

Imran/*
-3-

motorcycles parked on the spot were also taken into possession by

the police party, hence, the instant FIR was registered.

3. Both the accused/petitioners were arrested in case
FIR No.461 dated 22.10.2016 under Section 15 Arms Act of
Police Station Gomal University, D.I-Khan and were formally

arrested in the instant case on the same day.

4. The learned counsel for the petitioners urged with
vehemence that sufficient incriminating material connecting the
petitioners with commission of alleged offence is lacking, which
aspect of the matter has been ignored by the learned lower Court,
which resulted in serious miscarriage of justice as no prima facie
case is made out against the petitioners. It is next contended that
the case falls within the ambit as contained in Section 497(2)
Cr.P.C, being a case of further inquiry; the relief prayed for on
behalf of petitioners could not have been declined because the
petitioners have been implicated through supplementary statement
of Allah Wasaya got recorded on 21.6.2017, under Section 164
Cr.P.C, wherein it was stated that Matiullah and Kashif Jamal
alias Khalid (both were killed in police encounter), Umer Farooq

and Rehmatullah were fast friends.

5. The learned A.A.G, representing the State, seriously
controverted the view point as advanced at bar by the learned

counsel for petitioners with the submission that sufficient material

Imran/*
-4-

connecting the petitioners with the alleged offence is available,
which has rightly been scrutinized tentatively and the impugned
order, being free from any ambiguity, does not call for
interference. In order to substantiate the said contentions, he read
out the supplementary statement of Allah Wasaya. He also
contended that the matter does not fall within the ambit of further
inquiry, in view of sufficient incriminating material, which has
come on record. He also referred the provision as enumerated in
Section 21-D(4) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, with the
submission that facility of bail cannot be extended in favour of the
petitioners in view of restriction placed by the Anti Terrorism Act

1997 itself.

6. I have carefully examined the respective contentions
as agitated on behalf of the petitioners and for the State in the light
of the relevant provisions of the law and record of the case. Let
me mention here at the outset that sufficient incriminating material
is lacking prima facie connecting the petitioner with the
commission of the alleged offences. There is no denial to the facts
that the alleged offences are heinous in nature, but the question is
as to whether sufficient incriminating material connecting the

petitioner with the alleged offences is available or not.

7. It may be kept in view that presumption of innocence

of accused is always paramount irrespective of the heinousness of

Imran/*
-5-

alleged offences. The learned A.A.G could not point out any
incriminating material on the basis whereof it could be opined that
prima facie case is made out against the petitioners except the
statement of Allah Wasaya wherein he stated that the petitioners
and accused Kashif Jamal alias Khalid and Matiullah were fast
friends of his son namely Umer Farooq and the petitioner
Rehmatullah and that there was a general rumor that his son and
other companions were involved in the terrorist activities while his
son and relative Muhammad Javed had left the motorcycle on the
spot. The mobile data, which too does not disclose that the
petitioners had contact with the terrorists at the time of

occurrence.

8. The learned A.A.G was asked time and again to show
as to whether mobile data, collected by the police, reveals that the
accused were in contact with the terrorists at the time of
commission of offence, but he remained answerless. The learned
A.A.G was also asked, if any other incriminating material was
available against the petitioners or otherwise, but no satisfactory
answer could be given. As a result of tentative and careful
examination of the above collected material, I am inclined to hold

that no prima facie case is made out against the petitioners.

9. Adverting to the main contention of the learned

A.A.G that the case does not fall within the ambit of the Section

Imran/*
-6-

497 (2) Cr.P.C, which being without substance cannot be taken
into consideration. It is well settled law by now that “where there
is no prima facie case against the petitioner and evidence on
record is vague and sketchy and the Court considers it necessary
that further inquiry may be held in the matter, it may enlarge the
petitioner on bail.” Reliance can be placed on the case of
“Muhammad Sadique Vs State” (PLD 1985 SC 182). It is worth
mentioning that where prosecution versions leaves much to be
inquired into, the bail can be granted by invoking the provisions as
enumerated in Section 497(2) Cr.P.C, and concept of further
inquiry can be pressed into service. In this respect reference can
be made to the case of “Falak Shah Vs The state” (1979 SCMR
103). Reliance can also be placed on the case of “Najeeb Gul Vs
Khalid Khan _” (1989 SCMR 899). I have no hesitation in my
mind while holding that the case of petitioners falls within the
ambit of further inquiry as at the moment sufficient incriminating
material is lacking connecting the petitioners with the commission
of alleged offence. Moreso, it is not known that how alleged

offence was abetted or facilitated by the petitioners.

10. I have also adverted to the provision contained in
Section 21-D(4) of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997, which is

reproduced herein-below for reference.

“S.21-D(4). In exercising its powers in
relation to a person seeking bail under

Imran/*
-7-

this Act, the Court shall have regard to
such of the following considerations (as
well as to any others which it considers
relevant)-

(a) the nature and seriousness of the
offence with which the person is

charged;
(b) the character, antecedents,
associations and community ties of the
person;

(c) the time which the person has already
spent in custody and the time which he is
likely to spend in custody if he is not
admitted to bail; and

(d) the strength of the evidence of his
having committed the offence.”

11. A careful analysis of the above reproduced section
would reveal that it is free from any ambiguity and accordingly
the learned A.A.G was asked as to how it can be made applicable
to the petitioners, but no answer could be given except that
petitioners were responsible for abetment and instigation, but no
evidence could be pointed to substantiate the said allegation. It has
been noticed with great concern that the case against the accused
was registered on 26.4.2017, but challan has not yet been

submitted against them.

12. In the light of what has been discussed above, I am
inclined to accept these petitions. Resultantly, both the petitions in
hand are allowed and the petitioners Rahmatullah and Rafiullah
are directed to be released on bail subject to their furnishing bail
bonds in the sum of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees five lacs) each, with

two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of

Imran/*
-8-

Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate. The sureties must be local,

reliable and men of means.

13. Above are the detailed reasons of my short order of

even date.

Announced.
