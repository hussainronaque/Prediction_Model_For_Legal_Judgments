JUDGMENT

ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- This criminal appeal under
Section 24 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 2019 (“Act of 2019”) read with
section 410 Cr.P.C., filed by Qasam Khan, the
appellant, is directed against the judgment dated
27.02.2021, rendered by learned Additional Sessions
Judge-II District Khyber, whereby he has convicted the
appellant under section 9 (d) of the Act of 2019 and
sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for
life and to pay a fine of rupees five lac and in default
thereof to further undergo one year simple
imprisonment, in case FIR No.12 dated 18.01.2020,

registered under section 9 (d) of the Act of 2019 at
Police Station Jamrud District Khyber. Benefit of
Section 382-B Cr.P.C. has been extended to him.

2. The prosecution’s case as per contents of First
Information Report (“FIR”) Exh.PW.8/1 is that on
receipt of spy information about smuggling of
narcotics through a Suzuki Van bearing Registration
No.LEC.3209-Lahore from Bara Khyber towards
Jamrud, on 18.01.2020 Naimat Khan ASI (PW.2)
along with other police officials conducted Nakabandi
at Inzaro check-post and at 1415 hours intercepted the
said Suzuki Van. On query, its driver disclosed his
name as Qasam Khan (the appellant). On search of the
vehicle, the complainant ASI, recovered 15 packets of
chars from the secret cavities made in the vehicle, each
weighing 01 Kilogram, total 15 Kilograms. He
separated 05 grams from each packet as sample for
chemical analysis by the FSL and sealed the same into
parcels No.1 to 15. He also sealed the remaining
quantity into a separate parcel No.16 and thereafter
took the same into possession along with the vehicle
vide recovery memo Exh.PW.1/1 in presence of its
marginal witnesses. He issued arrest card of the
appellant Exh.PW.2/2, drafted Murasila Exh.PW.2/1
and sent the same to Police Station on the basis of
which FIR Exh.PW.8/1 was registered against the

appellant and handed over the case property along with
samples to Moharrir of the Police Station of safe
custody in Malkhana of the PS. On completion of
investigation by Aziz Khan ASI (PW.5), Muhammad
Akbar SHO (PW.4), submitted complete challan
against the appellant before the learned trial Court.

3. On receipt of challan, the appellant was
summoned by the learned Trial Court and formally
charge sheeted under section 9 (d) of the Act of 2019,
to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To
prove its case, the prosecution examined as many as
eight witnesses. After closure of the prosecution’s
evidence, statement of the appellant was recorded
under section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein he denied the
prosecution’s allegation and professed his innocence.
He, however, neither wished to be examined on oath
under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. or to produce evidence in
defence. On conclusion of trial, the learned trial court,
after hearing both the sides convicted and sentence the
appellant as mentioned in the initial paragraph of this
judgment, hence, this appeal.

4. Learned counsel for the appellant argued that as
the Seizing Officer of this case is Assistant
Sub-Inspector (ASI), therefore, he was not competent
to arrest without warrant and conduct the search and
seizure as under sections 28 and 30 of the Act of 2019,

only an “authorized Officer” has been empowered to
do so; that under section 2(e) (ii) an “Authorized
Officer” means a Police Officer not below the rank of
sub-Inspector, authorized by the Regional Police
Officer, therefore, the entire proceedings conducted by
an ASI in this case are nothing but nullity in the eye of
law. On merits, he contended that prosecution’s
evidence is pregnant with doubts benefit of which
should have been extended to the appellant but the
learned trial court by over sighting the above important
aspects of the case has erred in law by holding the
appellant guilty of the offence, hence, the impugned
judgment is liable to be set aside.

5. Conversely, the worthy AAG supported the
impugned judgment and contended that provisions of
sections 28 and 30 of the Act of 2019 being directory
in nature, non-compliance thereof would not be a
ground for holding the proceedings bad in the eye of
law. He requested for dismissal of the appeal.

6. We have heard the arguments of learned counsel
for the parties and perused the record with their able
assistance.

7. Before dilating upon merits of the case in light of
the evidence available on record, we deem it
appropriate and necessary to answer the first legal
argument advanced by the learned counsel for the

appellant in respect of incompetency of Seizing
Officer/ASI to make search, seizure and arrest without
warrant. It may be noted that Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 1997 (“Act of 1997”), was
promulgated in the year 1997 and made applicable and
extendable throughout Pakistan. Subsequently, in year
2019 the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa enacted
and promulgated the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of
Narcotics Substances Act 2019 (“Act of 2019”), vide
notification dated 4th September, 2019 and the same
was made applicable and extendable to the Province of
the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Though under section 59,
the Act of 1997 has been repealed but only to the
extent of cultivation, possession, selling, purchasing,
delivery and transportation etc within the Province of
the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which read as under:-
“59. Repeal and Savings:- (1) The

Control of Narcotics Substances Act,
1997 (Act No.XXV of 1997), to the
extent of cultivation, possession,
selling, purchasing delivery and
transportation etc within the
Province, to the extent of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa is hereby repealed.”
8. Section 59 (ibid) does not provide specifically

about repealing of rest of the provisions of the Act of
1997. Sections 21 and 23 of the Act of 1997 are similar
to a great extent with sections 28 and 30 of the Act of
2019, as both speak about the power of entry, search,

seizure and arrest of accused without warrant and
power to stop and search conveyance by an authorized
Officer. For the sake of convenience and ready
reference, the aforesaid sections of the two statutes are
reproduced below for comparison:-

Control of Narcotics Substance Act 1997

21. Power of entry, search, seizure and arrest
without warrant. — (1) Where an officer, not

below the rank of Sub-Inspector of Police or
equivalent authorized in this behalf by the
Federal Government or the Provincial
Government, who from his personal knowledge

psychotropic substance or controlled 5
substance in respect of which an offence
punishable under this Act has been committed is
kept or concealed in any building, place,
premises or conveyance, and a warrant for arrest
or search cannot be obtained against such,
person without affording him an opportunity for
the concealment of evidence or facility for his
escape; such officer may:-

(a) enter into any such building, place, premises
or conveyance; { b) break open any door and
remove any other Obstacle to such entry in case
of resistance;

(c) seize such narcotic drugs, psychotropic
substances and controlled substances and other
materials used in the manufacture thereof and
any other article which he has reason to believe
to be liable to confiscation-n under this Act and
any document or other article which he has
reason to believe may furnish evidence of the
commission of an offence punishable under this
Act; and

(b) Detain, search and, if he thinks proper,

arrest any person whom he has reason to believe
to have committed an offence punishable. under

this Act.

(2) Before or immediately after taking any

and basis of his information and proposed action

and forthwith send a copy thereof*, to his

immediate superior officer.

23. Power to stop and search conveyance:-

has reason to suspect that any conveyance is, or

is about to be, used for the transport of any

narcotic drug, psychotropic substance or

controlled substance in respect of which he

suspects that any provision of this Act has been,

or is being, or is about to be, contravened at any

time, stop such conveyance or, in the case of

any aircraft, compel it to land and;

(a) Rummage and search the conveyance or part
thereof;

(b) Examine and search any good on or in the
conveyance; or

(c)If it becomes necessary to stop the
conveyance, he may use all reasonable force
for stopping it.

Sections 28 and 30 of KP Control of Narcotics

Substances Act, 2019.

28. Power of entry, search, seizure and
arrest without warrant.--(1) Where an
authorized officer, who from his personal
knowledge or from information given to him by
any person, is of the opinion that any narcotic
substance is kept or concealed in any building,
place, premises, dwelling house or conveyance
and warrant for the search or arrest cannot be
obtained from the Special Court against such
person without affording him an opportunity for
the concealment of evidence or facility for his

escape, such officer may-
(a) enter into any such building, place, premises,
dwelling house subject to the proviso of sub-
section (1) of Section 27 of this Act;

(b) break open any door and remove any other
obstacle to such entry in case of resistance;

(c) seize such narcotic _—_ substances,
methamphetamine and other materials used in
the manufacturing thereof and any other article
or documents which he has reason to believe to
be liable for confiscation or may furnish
evidence of the commission of an offence
punishable under this Act; and

(d) search and, if he thinks proper, arrest any
person whom he has reason to believe to have
committed an offence punishable under this Act.
(2) Before or immediately after taking any
action under sub-section (1), the authorized
officer, mentioned in sub-section (1), shall record
the grounds and basis of his information and take
immediate necessary action and forthwith send a

may be to the Regional Police Officer”.

“§.30. Power to spot and search conveyance:-
An authorized Officer, may, if he has reason to

suspect that any conveyance is or is about to be

used for the transportation of any narcotic

substance, at any time, stop such conveyance
and:-

a) Search and examine the conveyance, person
and good or part thereof laying in such
conveyance;

b) Seize the narcotic substances recover during
search and arrest the accused; and

c) If it becomes necessary to stop the
conveyance, he may use all reasonable for
stopping it.

9. “Authorized Officer” under section 2(e) of the

Act of 2019, which means:- (i) An Officer of the
Directorate General, not below the rank of Sub-
Inspector, authorized by the Director; or (ii) A Police
Officer/official not below the rank of Sub-Inspector,
authorized by the Regional Police Officer, or (iii) An
officer or official of the ANF, not below the rank of
Sub-Inspector, authorized by the Regional Director.
Sections 21 and 23 of the Act of 1997 are almost ditto
copy of sections 28 and 30 of the Act of 2019. Section
23 of the Act of 1997 similar to section 30 of the Act
of 2019, remained the issue of discussion before the
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in various cases
including case titled, “Muhammad Younas and others
vs Mst, Perveen alias Mano and others” (2007 SCMR
393), wherein it has been held by the Hon’ble supreme
court that arrest of accused in possession of narcotics
by a Police Officer below the rank of Sub-Inspector
would not vitiate the prosecution case, rather the
competent Court would proceed to determine the guilt
or innocence of the accused on the basis of evidence,
irrespective of the manner in which he is brought
before the court. Relevant part of the judgment (ibid) is
reproduced below for ready reference:-

“The other argument of the learned counsel
for the respondent No.1 as to the violation of
the provision of section 21 and 22 of the Act

needs to be dealt with. Ordinarily, only an
10

officer of the rank of Sub-Inspector or
equivalent or above may exercise the powers
of arrest and seizure of narcotics. But this is
not an absolute rule. There may be cases of
extreme urgency requiring prompt action,
where an accused is caught with narcotics in
his possession by a Police Officer of a lower
rank. Can it be said that such Police Officer
should just let him go with the narcotics? The
answer would certainly be in the emphatic
“No”. The guilt or innocence of an accused
does not depend on the question of
competence or otherwise of a Police Officer
to investigate the offence. A trial of an
accused is not vitiated mere on the ground
that the case has been investigated by an
officer who is not authorized to do so unless
a contrary intention appears from the
language of a statute. The competent Court
would proceed to determine the guilt or
innocence of an accused on the basis of the
evidence produced before it irrespective of
the manner in which he is brought before it”.

A somewhat similar view was taken in the

cases Of “Mr. Abdul Latif Vs GM Paracha

and others” (1981 SCMR 1101), “State
through Advocate General Sindh Vs Bashir
and others” (PLD 1997 SC 408), “The Crown
vs Mehar Ali” (PLD 1956 FC 106), “ M.S.K

Tbrat Vs the Commander in chief, Royal
11

Pakistan Navy and others” (PLD 1956 SC
264), “Ahmad Khan Vs Rasul Shah and
others” (PLD 1975 SC 66 at page 81, 88and
151-152), “Muhammad and others Vs the
State” (1984 SCMR 954) and “the State vs
Sohail Ahmed and 04 others” (PLD 1990
FSC 29). We may however observe that in a
proper case, a Police Officer, if guilty of
deliberate usurpation of power and violation
of a statute may render himself liable to
disciplinary or penal action or both in
accordance with law. The purpose of
enacting protective provisions of sections 21
and 22 of the Act seems to be that normally
the cases of narcotics being of serious nature
should be handled by more responsible

Police Officer.

In case titled, “The State vs Abdali Shah”, (2009
SCMR 291), it has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme

Court that:-

“Even the provisions of sections 20 to 22 of
CNSA being directory, non-compliance
thereof would not be a ground for holding the
trial/conviction bad in the eyes of law. On this
ground the conviction of the appellant cannot
be set aside. Reference in this behalf can be
made to the case of Fida Jan v the State 2001
SCMR 36; State through AG Sindh v Hemjoo
2003 SCMR 881, Karl Johan Joseph v the
State PLD 2004 SC 394 and Muhammad
Younas v Mst. Perveen alias Mano and others
2007 SCMR 393, wherein it is observed that
where provisions of CNSA are directory in
12

nature, non-compliance of the same is not
fatal”.

While dilating upon the provision of section 21 of the

Act of 1997, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled,

“The State Vs Abdali Shah” (2009 SCMR 291), was
pleased to observe as under:-

“Tt would be seen that a huge quantity of 52
Kgs of chars was allegedly recovered from the
Taxi beside which the respondent was
standing while closing its dickey. It is not
possible that the police would foist such a
huge quantity of charas upon him. It appears
that the learned High Court has relied heavily
upon the technical aspect of the seizure and
arrest which in our opinion are misconceived
as in the first place no raid was carried out by
the police personnel but the respondent
apprehended during normal patrol duty. As
such the provisions of section 21 are not
applicable. Even otherwise, it cannot be
expected that upon apprehension of the
accused the police party would go in search of
the officer who is entitled to arrest the accused
being an ASI. At the most, this was an
irregularity which was curable under section
537 Cr.P.C. as held by this Court in case of
Muhammad Hanif (supra).
10. Similar is the view of the Hon’ble four

Members Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case
titled, “Zafar Vs_the State” (2008 SCMR_ 1254,

wherein it has been held that the provisions of sections
20 to 22 of the CNSA being directory, non-compliance
thereof would not be a ground for holding the

trial/conviction bad in the eyes of law.
13

11. In view of the law settled by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in the judgments (supra), we are firm
in our view to hold that mere non-compliance of the
provisions of sections 28 and 30 of the Act of 2019
would not vitiate the proceedings and trial, and such
non-compliance cannot be made a sole ground for
acquittal of an accused.

12. Coming to merits of the case, record depicts that
Niamat Khan ASI (PW.2), Seizing Officer of the case
and Sohrab ud Din Constable (PW.1), marginal
witness to recovery memo Exh.PW.1/1, have furnished
ocular account of the occurrence. Both have furnished
the story of the arrest of the appellant from vehicle
bearing registration No.LEC.3209 and recovery of
huge quantity of chars in 15 packets from secret
cavities of the vehicle being driven by the appellant at
the relevant time. They also exhibited the recovered
contraband narcotics as Exh.P.1 and vehicle as Exh.P.2
before the learned trial court. Despite lengthy and
taxing cross-examination nothing beneficial has been
extracted from their mouths. They have remained stuck
to their stance and have corroborated each other on ail
material aspects of the occurrence such as the day,
date, time and place of arrest of the appellant and
recovery of narcotics from secret cavities of the

vehicle being driven by the appellant at the relevant
14

time as well as the proceedings conducted at the spot.
Their testimony is further supplemented by positive
FSL report Exh.PW.5/6.

13. Prosecution has also proved the chain of safe
transmission of the samples from the spot to the FSL
through the testimony of Niamat Khan ASI (PW.2),
Israrullah Khan HC (PW.3), Tahir Moharrir (PW.6)
and Rafi Ullah Moharrir (PW.7). The above named
witnesses have also been cross-examined by the
defence but nothing of the sort could be extracted from
them so as to make the transmission of the samples
from the spot to the FSL as doubtful or that during the
period of its transmission the same were interfered
with or tampered. No doubt, PWs are the police
officials but they are competent witnesses like any
other independent witness and their testimony cannot
be discarded merely on the ground that they are the
police employees unless and until any ill will or
enmity with the appellant is proved against them.
Nothing in black & white is available on file or even
otherwise suggested by the defence in their cross-
examination that they had any ill will or enmity with
the appellant. In this regard reliance is placed on case
titled, “Muhammad Azam Vs the State (PLD 1996
SC_67), “Muhammad Hanif _Vs_ the State 2003

SCMR_1237), “Riaz Ahmad Vs the State 2004
15

SCMR_988) “Naseer Ahmad Vs_the State 2003
SCMR_1361)_and_ “Zafar _Vs_the State” (2008
SCMR 1254),

14. On reappraisal of the evidence we have reached
to an irresistible conclusion that all the prosecution’s
witnesses have deposed in line to support the
prosecution’s case. They have passed the test of
lengthy cross-examination but the defence failed to
make any dent in the prosecution story or to extract
any material contradiction fatal to the prosecution case
in the testimony of the PWs. The prosecution has been
successful to bring home the guilt of the appellant to
the hilt by placing ocular account, recovery of
narcotics material, the chemical examiner report
Exh.PW.5/6. The learned counsel for the appellant has
not been able to point out any error or law in the
impugned judgment and the same being exceptionable,
is not open to any interference by this court.

14. Accordingly, this appeal being meritless stands

dismissed.
