MOHAMMAD IBRAHIM KHAN, J:-.The chronicle
events under implication of petitioner Imdad Ullah in
case FIR No.470 dated 30.07.2022 under Section 11-B
KP CNSA 2019 (Act), registered at Police Station
Nisatta District Charsadda, is that assertedly 803 grams
meth amphetamine(Ice) were recovered from a plastic
bag held by him; while 707 grams of contraband stuff
was statedly recovered from co-accused Zubair. This is
to say without exaggeration that initially these accused
were faced with charges in another case FIR No.467
dated 29.07.2022, registered under Sections 457/380
PPC, at Police Station Nisatta, District Charsadda. While

alike request for post arrest bail was sagged by the
NS

learned Additional Sessions Judge-Il/MCTC, Charsadda
vide his order dated 19.08.2022; hence this application
has been preferred

2. Having heard this application partly, some
facts cropped up involving in this FIR were brought into
the notice of this Court to the effect that the petitioner-
accused and his co-accused were earlier booked in a
theft case, which was compromised by the two sides
subsequent to mutual understanding. It be in line for to
state here that the alleged wrong custody of petitioner
and co-accused was questioned under Section 491
Cr.PC. Later, however, the petitioner and the other one
were disclosed of their involvement in the present case.
To dig out the facts and verify so as to reach to the
bottom of issue, the Seizing Officer Muhammad Kashif
ASI and SHO concerned were summoned. They
appeared before the Court and were asked to explain vis-
a-vis implication of the petitioner. They did not spell out
the truth and it was not found worthy of credence.
Thereafter, the worthy District Police Officer, Charsadda
was summoned and directed to bring to light the actual
facts qua the offence, whose report submitted in due
course, was found inadequate and not worthy of

consideration vide order dated 17.10.2022, thereby he
was asked for his personal appearance with report which
he submitted eventually and so placed on file.

3. Learned counsel for accused-petitioner
while seeking for the petitioned relief, has levelled very
serious allegation that the local police groping to hunt
for gratification of Rs.35,000/- from the petitioner’s
father whilst the District Police Officer, Charsadda has
submitted in his report that the police officers/officials
have been strictly directed that in future, subsequent to
recovery of huge quantity of narcotics, proper
investigation/ inquiry must precede registration of FIR,
so that only actual culprit is implicated/ apprehended
reducing chances of sufferings of innocent people. The
sort of report of the District Police Officer and the
submission offered before the Court do not absolutely
indicate the allegation of illegal gratification which
accusation requires patent proof, which though is
lacking in the circumstances, still the allegations of
incriminating the petitioner accused in the FIR, owing to
the alleged recovery of meth amphetamine subsequent to
his refusal to please the local police with the inducement
is to haunt the District Police Officer, who being the

disciplinarian enforcer of the District Police besides
performing other responsibilities of the police under
him.

4, The above being the backdrop of this case
which makes it certainly one of further inquiry and also
keeping in view the part recovery allegedly effected
from the present petitioner-accused, the offence though
grave in nature yet when the involvement of the
petitioner may be on account of skepticism and on
tentative assessment this case has been made out for
grant of bail.

5. The police must lay heavy hands on the
culprits involved in this ever rising filthy business of
narcotics to salvage our society from its evils but it is
equally the responsibility of police to remain candid and
unbiased in pursuit of controlling crimes especially
those involving narcotics and false implication of
innocent people. While a strict law is necessary to
control organized crime like drug trafficking and protect
our youth from the menace of drugs abuse its brutal
provisions are sometimes misused by the investigation
agency and checking teams leading to false implication;
thereby prolong unjustified and unlawful detention of
individuals. In cases of recovery of contrabands

particularly charas and Ice the police neither associates
private witnesses to authenticate such recovery nor do
they offer plausible explanation for their omissions.

6. To avoid malice of unscrupulous
policemen and even otherwise in cases when resourceful
accused could win over independent witnesses, the
police as a worthy force and body is required to switch
over/turn over to Qanun-e- Shahadat Order 1984
(“Order”) and make good use of Article 164 of ibid
order. This provision through the legislature has
provided that the evidence made available because of
modern devices and techniques could be allowed by the
Courts for consideration. The wordings of Article 164 of
ibid provides as:-

164. Production of evidence that has
become available because of modern
devices, etc. — In such cases as the Court
may consider appropriate, the Court may
allow to be produced any evidence that may
have become available because of modern
devices or techniques.

7. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in
cases of “Ali Haider alias Pappu Vs The State Jameel
Hussain and others” (PLD 2021 Supreme Court 362),
Mian Khalid Perviz Vs _The State through Special
Prosecutor ANF and another” (2021 SCMR 522), the
Hon’ble Islamabad High Court in Criminal Appeal

No.255-P/2019, titled, “Mian Khalid Pervaiz VS_ The
Pe

State & another, and the Hon’ble Uttarakhand High
—__—_—_—enen ed ihe f10n ble Uttarakhand High

Court), in case of Shahrukh Vs State of Uttarakhand,

have laid emphasis on this aspect by observing that
Courts have been empowered to receive and make use of
such evidence collected through modern technologies in
order to arrive to actual truth.

8. The reference found in the order and the
case laws of the Hon’ble superior Courts suggest that the
idea of making videography during narcotics recovery
proceeding is not entirely novel. The police officials in
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are generally equipped with smart
phones which would enable them to video-graph
recovery proceedings. The videography as a device for
crucial evidence can be presented in a credible manner.
Even otherwise, reliance on technology would instill
fairness, impartiality and confidence inspiring in the
investigation process and shall not portray the
impression of biasness and malice by some policemen
during such proceedings. Where any police
officer/Seizing officer/ Investigation Officer complains
of non availability of video cameras, their own
Department/Provincial Government can allocate
requisite funds to purchase/provision of video cameras

for making videography of recovery proceedings of
drugs seizure and involvement of an accused beyond any
doubt. The videography will certainly at best avoid false
implication especially in drugs cases which has become
practice of police to either gain for personal benefits or
for the outcome of the nefarious designs of influential
involving their enemies through ill reputed odd police
officials.

9. The Courts must also mention the bitter
reality of Anti Narcotics Force (ANF), Excise, Taxation
& Narcotics Control and Customs Authorities, which are
disciplined forces but at times also enrope innocent
individuals in narcotics cases and; same is there with
police of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, against which
complaints are pouring in regard to untrue implication of
innocent persons in such cases. The Court reiterate that
the only solution to assuage the allegations whether false
or true, of planted recovery of narcotics lies in making
recourse to the spirit of the order for use of videography
right from seizing, when the recovery in the reported
mode and manner, is effected and the investigation is
also lasted with the belief that the same has actually
been made from such persons or from the dwelling
houses or from the vehicles so every recovery for

proceeding of narcotics when especially the quantity of
&

narcotics is considerably huge, the Seizing Officer shall
make a video recording of the recovery proceedings,
which shall be made available before the Court at bail
stage while disposing the bail application failing which
the credibility of the provincial police or any other force
dealing to curb the menace of narcotics will be at stake
while the individual under arrest may whisk of detention
setting the prosecution case against him at naught.
Suffice it to say that for any plausible reason if at all the
Seizing Officer/ Investigation officer or Incharge of
Police Station are unable to proceed in line with the
shown technology based parameter, for any reason
beyond their control, the reasons for the omission must
be recorded in the investigation conducted/challan for
appraisal of Courts.

10. The Provincial Police Officer, Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, Director Anti Narcotics Force Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Peshawar, Director General, Excise
Taxation and Narcotics Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Chief
Collector Customs Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, to whom the
copy of this order be communicated by the office of the
worthy Registrar of this Court, are directed to ensure
that at all costs, the recovery by the respective Police

Force in narcotics cases shall be supported by
videography, so that only the real culprits be kept behind
the bars and punished while those innocent persons are
not entangled and further any more afflicted to severe
mental and physical as well as financial agonies due to
spurious/ bogus/ phony recoveries. In case of
contingency of non availability of smart phones or video
cameras with any of the Seizing Officer/ Investigation
Officer of concerned Police Station to video-graph
recovery proceedings of narcotics, the authorities
concern will be under inevitable obligation to arrange
the facility of video cameras or alike equipments to
record events in either form in all respective Police
Stations throughout Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The worthy
Provincial Heads of the above narcotics forces shall pass
on the directions contained in this order to the field
officers/ personnel for strict compliance accordingly.

11. Not least of all, let it be clear in very lucid
explicit manner that the Courts concerned of the District
Judiciary including Special Court(s) seized with the bail
applications shall be ultra leery and avoid inertia to grant
bail with creditable, bonafide and confidence inspiring
reasons wherein allegations of malice and dishonesty are
levelled and sensed against the officers/officials of

police and personnel of these forces and where they
10

could not support the charge of recovery of narcotics
cases falling under the prohibitory limb of Section 497
Cr.PC, specifically and all other cases in routine
generally, with videography. Howbeit the department(s)
concerned will require to prove their investigation in line
with the above observations, all such Courts shall
proceed in the matter in the illustrated direction after
15" April 2023, so that the quarters concerned till then
could put in place their investigative apparatus
accordingly.

Copy of this order shall be transmitted to
the learned Judges of District Judiciary through learned
Sessions Judges and Presiding Officers of the Special
Court(s) of the province for compliance of the supra
mentioned directions in letter and spirit.

12. In light of above observations, this Court
finds that the petitioner is seemingly said to have been
unjustly implicated in the case by giving the impression
of false recoveries of narcotics, therefore, with such
apprehension in my mind, I allow this bail petition and
admit the petitioner to bail subject to furnishing bail
bonds in the sum of Rs.100,000/- (One lac) with two

sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
11

learned Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate/ trial Court
concerned.
13. Suffice it to say that this order shall not
prejudice the mind of the learned trial Judge conducting
trial of petitioner-accused as the same is to be conducted
and concluded on merit deciding wheel of fortune in
either acquittal or conviction of accused.

The above are the detailed reasons of my

short order of even date.
