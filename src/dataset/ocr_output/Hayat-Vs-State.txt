ORDER

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- Petitioner

Hayat Muhammad Khan, seeks bail in case FIR No.359
dated 12.10.2015, registered under sections
324/148/149/109 PPC, in Police Station Battagram,
wherein he alongwith co-accused is charged for attempting
at the lives of complainant Hamayun and Sabez Ali as well
as causing firearm injury to Sabaz Ali on 12.10.2015 at
1615 hours on a thoroughfare situated in Daulat Pura
Batagram, on a motive of land dispute.

2. Arguments heard and record perused.

3. As per FIR, total ten accused have been
charged by the complainant for the incident. No doubt, the
role of effective firing has been assigned specifically to the
petitioner but complainant has not sustained any injury
while as per medico legal report Sabaz Ali has sustained a

solitary injury, and that too, on his non-vital part of the

body i.e. heel and ankle, therefore, intention of the
petitioner to kill when the injured and complainant were
squarely at his mercy is yet to be determined during trial
after recording evidence. At the moment the injury of the
injured would fall within the definition of Badiâ€™ah
punishment of which has been provided under section
337-F (11) PPC, which does not fall within the Prohibitory
Clause of S.497 Cr.P.C., therefore, the petitioner is entitled
to concession of bail.

5. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he
furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two
local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD concerned.
