JUDGMENT

Respondent/State ... Rakes Ke be AAGa.. beseeeees .

ABDUL SHAKOOR, J:- Ghulam Nabi, petitioner,

seeks his release on bail in case FIR No.561 dated
31.05.2017 registered under Section 9 (c ) CNSA,
Police Station Faqir Abad, Peshawar.

2. Precise allegation against the petitioner, as
contained in the FIR, is that on 31.05.2017 at 1930
hours complainant Asad Khan SI along with other
police officials during the gusht were present at
Bashir Abad, on spy information petitioner was
apprehended, on his personal search one plastic bag of
heroin was recovered from the fold of his shalwar;
that on weighing the heroin, it was found 1 100 grains,
one gram from the recovered heroin was separated for
chemical analysis and sealed into parcel No.1, while

the remaining heroin 1099 grams was sealed into
parcel No.2 and affixed 3/3 monogram of S.K, hence
the aforesaid FIR was registered against the petitioner. .

3. After hearing of the learned counsel for the

petitioner, learned Assistant Advocate General for the,

State and perusing the material available on record,
this Court has noticed that when petitioner was :

apprehended, 1100 grams heroin allegedly recovered

from the plastic bag which was having in the fold of

his shalwar. On the Court query the learned Assistant

AG after going through the recovery memo available

on the file of police record, could not show that the

recovered heroin was weighed along with the plastic
@ bag or otherwise. If the recovered heroin was weighed
along with the plastic bag, prima facie the weight of
the heroin without plastic bag, if weighed might have
come to 1000 grams or less then that and .in that
eventuality, the case of the present petitioner would
have fallen within the ambit of Section 9 (b) of
CNSA 1997. Even otherwise it creates serious doubts
in the mind of prudent person that how one can carry
a plastic bag of more then one KG in the fold of his

shalwar. In this background, the case of petitioner

becomes one of further inquiry falling within the

Procedure.

4. In view of the above discussions, this petition is
