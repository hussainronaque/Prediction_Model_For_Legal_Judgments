2. As per contents of the FIR, the
complainant Hameem Zada, PW-7, uncle of
the deceased Sahib Zada on 25.5.2013 at
23:15 hours reported the incident to
Muhammad Khalid, Sub Inspector, who
appeared during proceedings u/s 512 Cr.P.C
as PW-2 at emergency ward of Dagger
hospital about the unnatural death of both the
deceased who were allegedly killed by father
of the female deceased Mst. Rugia namely
Umar Zada (the present appellant) and his son
namely Habibullah (absconding accused)
through fire arms. The complainant also
advanced specific motive, which was stated to
be illicit relations of both the deceased. The
report of the complainant was incorporated in

‘Murasila’ Ex. PA/1, which culminated into

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
FIR ibid Ex. PA being registered against the
present accused-appellant and other
absconding co-accused at PS concerned on
26.05.2013.

3: Initially, both the accused were
avoiding their lawful arrest, therefore, upon
completion of investigation, challan u/s 512
Cr.P.C was submitted against them before the
Court of learned Sessions Judge/Zila Qazi
Buner and upon conclusion of the said
proceedings, both the accused were declared
proclaimed offenders by the said learned
Court vide judgment dated 11.02.2014.

4. The present appellant was
arrested in the case on 11.8.2014 and was sent
for trial. During the course of trial, the
prosecution examined as many as 13
witnesses whose statements were recorded and
placed on file. On closure of the prosecution
evidence, accused was examined under section
342, Cr.P.C, wherein he denied the charges,
claimed innocence and stated to have falsely

been implicated in the case.

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
5. On conclusion of the trial, the
learned trial Court convicted the accused/
appellant vide judgment impugned herein,
hence, the present appeal.

6. Arguments heard and record of
the case was perused with the able assistance
of learned counsels for the parties including
the learned Astt: Advocate General appearing
on behalf of the State.

Ds As per prosecution story, the
complainant Hameem Zada, PW-7 on
25.05.2013 at 23:15 hours reported
the matter to Muhammad _ Khalid,
Sub Inspector at emergency ward of
Dagger hospital to the effect that he
along with his nephew (deceased Sahib
Zada) and other family members were
jointly living in one house. His nephew

used to go to the ‘Baitak’ of one

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Bakhtshad and on the day of occurrence he
went to the said Baitak as usual. At about
21:30 hours, he was informed that his nephew
Sahib Zada and Mst. Ruqia daughter of Umar
Zada were killed by the said Umar Zada (the
present appellant) and his son Habibullah
(absconding accused). The dead bodies of
both the deceased were lying in the
Baitak/house of the said Umar Zada. In
pursuit of such information, when the
complainant in the company of his brother
Zameer Zada, PW-11 reached at the spot there
they found dead bodies of both the deceased.
The dead bodies were then shifted to Dagger
hospital with the help of inhabitants of the
locality. Both the deceased were killed by the
Umar Zada and his son Habibullah on account

of illicit relations through fire arms. The

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
motive behind the occurrence was disclosed to
be illicit relations of the deceased.

8. It is an admitted fact surfacing on
the record that the occurrence is unseen and
un-witnessed. Even the complainant Hameem
Khan, PW-7, uncle of the deceased Sahib
Zada is not the eye-witness of the occurrence.

9, Likewise, the prosecution has
also produced one Naseeb Zada as PW-10
who is the father of the deceased Sahib Zada.
This PW is also not the eye-witness of the
occurrence as at the relevant time he was
present in the house when the complainant
and his brother Zameer Zada upon receipt of
information went to the spot. During cross-
examination he has confirmed that he is not
the eye-witness of the occurrence.

10. Similarly, the brother of the

complainant Zameer Zada was examined by

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
ase

the prosecution as PW-11, who also admitted
during his cross-examination that he is not
eye-witness of the occurrence.

11. No doubt, there is a statement of
mother of the deceased Mst. Nargas, PW-13
available on file. In respect of the said
witness, the prosecution had moved an
application for declaring her to be hostile
witness. However, her cross-examination is
worth perusal wherein she totally deposed
against the version of prosecution and had
shown complete ignorance about the death of
her real daughter. This PW has stated during
cross-examination that at the relevant time she
was in the house of one Mst. Rukhsar and
when returned to her house she found the dead
body of her daughter alongwith a body of a

boy.

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
12. From above-referred glimpses of
the prosecution evidence it is crystal clear that
on all counts the occurrence is unseen and un-
witnessed, as none has come forward who
could have seen the unfortunate death of both
the deceased.

13. Thus, the only circumstance
which remains in field against the appellant is
that admittedly the deceased Mst. Ruqia was
his daughter and she died unnatural death at
his Baitak, however, it discerns from record
that apart from deceased, his other family
members were residing in the said house, and
the absconding accused, who is his son is also
charged for the offence. True, it has been
settled by the august Supreme Court of
Pakistan in number of judgments that with
regard to vulnerable members of the society,

such as children, women and the infirm, who

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr, Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Fd

were living with the accused or was last seen
in his company before their death, the accused
ought to offer some explanation as to what
happened to them and when instead offering
explanation, the accused remained silent or
offers a false explanation he casts a shadow
upon himself. However, mere this
circumstance that the deceased remained in
custody of her father and dies unnatural death
was never alone considered a sufficient proof
for conviction of an accused. In “Saeed
Ahmad vs the State (2015 SCMR 710), the
august Supreme Court of Pakistan while
upholding the conviction of the appellant
therein has held that:- “That with regard to

vulnerable members of society, such as children,
women and the infirm, who were living with the
accused or were last in his company the accused
ought to offer some explanation of what happened

to them. If instead he remains silent or offers a false

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
oi

-10-

explanation he casts a shadow upon himself. This
does not mean that the burden of proof has shifted
onto the accused as it is for the prosecution to prove
its case, however, in respect of the helpless or the
weak that require protection or care it would not be
sufficient for the accused to stay silent in
circumstances which tend to incriminate him, and if
he elects to do so he lightens the burden of the
prosecution. Article 122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat
Order too stipulates that if a particular fact is
especially within the knowledge of any person the
burden of proving that fact is upon him. In the
present case the prosecution had established its case
against the appellant; two eye-witnesses had deposed
against him and the medical evidence confirmed
strangulation of the deceased. The appellant did not
attend to the last rites of his wife who had died
whilst residing with him, he also did not inform the
police nor took his wife to a hospital and
disappeared for two months, such circumstances

corroborate the prosecution case in the absence of

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
gi

«Fil =

the appellant offering a reasonable explanation Sor

his unnatural conduct.”

However, in the above-referred
case all the Courts had believed the testimony
of the eyewitnesses who have witnessed
strangulation of the deceased at the hands of
the appellant and the brother of the appellant
who had facilitated her strangulation by
holding her down and the statements of the
said eyewitnesses were also corroborated by
the medical evidence.

In the recent judgment reported
as “Arshad Khan vs the State (2017 SCMR
564)”, the august Supreme Court of Pakistan
has elaborately held in Para 4 of the judgment
that:- “It may be true that it has been held by this
Court in the cases of Arshad Mehmood v. The State
(2005 SCMR 1524) and Saeed Ahmed v. The State
(2015 SCMR 710) that in such cases some part of the
onus lies on the accused person to explain as to how
and in which circumstances the accused person's
wife had died an unnatural death inside the confines
of the matrimonial home but at the same time it has
also been clarified by this Court in the case of Abdul

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
ae

Majeed v. The State (2011 SCMR 941) that where
the prosecution completely fails to discharge its
initial onus there no part of the onus shifts to the

accused person at all.”
The said view was also

re-affirmed by the august Supreme Court of

Pakistan in “Nazir Ahmad vs The State
(2018 SCMR 787).

14. In the context of the present case,
no one has witnessed the tragic incident of
death of both the deceased and even the
complainant and other witnesses who are
related to the deceased were admittedly not
the eye-witnesses of the occurrence. For the
offence not only the appellant but his
absconding son is also charged. Thus, the
allegations are based on_ suspensions.
Therefore, in such circumstances, we have
reached at the conclusion that the only
circumstance that the deceased was the
daughter of the appellant and died unnatural
death in his Baitak alone is not sufficient for

his conviction, then, in such a eventuality, we

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
=f3=

have no other choice but to extend the benefit
of doubt to the present accused/appellant.

15. The appellant who was declared
as proclaimed offender, was arrested on
11.8.2014 and in respect whereof, although no
plausible explanation has been given.
However, it is settled law that absconsion is a
corroborative piece of evidence and in cases
where direct evidence does not exist,
corroborative piece of evidence is of no worth.

Reliance is placed on “Abdullah Vs.

Muhammad_Ali" (PLD _1971_ SC 541),
"Muhammad Arshad Vs. Qasim Ali" (1992
SCMR-814) and "Muhammad Salim _Vs.
Muhammad _Azam__and_ another" (2011
SCMR-474).

16. Thus, after reappraisal of the
entire evidence, we are of the firm view that
the prosecution case against the appellant has
not been proved beyond any reasonable doubt
and the judgment of learned trial Court is
based on wrong appreciation of evidence.

Hence, we accept this appeal and set-aside the

impugned judgment rendered by the learned
trial Court. Resultantly, the appellant is
acquitted of the charges leveled against him.
He is in custody and be set free if not required
in any other case.

17, These are the reasons of our short

order of even date.
