ISHTIAO IBRAHIM, J.- Through this criminal appeal,’
the appellant has challenged judgment dated 08.02.2019
rendered by learned Additional Sessions Judge,
Chakdarra, Camp Court at Timergara, District Dir
Lower, in case F.LR No.539 dated 20.11.2007 registered
u/s 302 PPC at Police Station Balambat, District Dir

2. According to the contents of murasila
Ex.PA, on 20.11.2007 at 11:30 hours, complainant
Muhammad Siyasat Khan (PW-6) reported the matter

before the police in his house to the effect that’ his

deceased daughter namely Mst. Risalat Bibi was married

Sanz al (0.8) HONBLE MR, JUSTICE ISHTIAG IBRAHIM
to the appellant some 9/10 years ago. Out of said
wedlock, four children were born. On fateful day, her
dead body was brought on a cot to his house. There was a
sign of fire shot on her dead body, while her husband
(appellant) has fled away. The complainant has alleged in
his report satisfaction regarding murder of her daughter
deceased Mst. Risalat Bibi by her husband/appellant due
to some unknown motive. On the basis of report/murasila
(Ex.PA), the instant FIR (Ex.PW1/1) was registered

against the appellant.

3. Initially, the appellant was absconding.
Challan u/s 512 Cr.P.C was submitted before the learned
trial Court. After recording the prosecution evidence in
absentia of the appellant, vide order dated 30.01.2008,
the appellant was declared as proclaimed offender and
perusal warrant of arrest was issued against him, in
execution whereof, on 30.06.2016, he was arrested vide
his card of arrest (Ex.PW9/1). After completion of
investigation, supplementary challan was submitted
against the appellant before the learned trial Court. On
10.08.20216, the appellant was charged sheeted, to which
he did not plead guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution
produced and examined as many as ten (10) witnesses in
support of its case besides transposition of statement of

HON:BLE MR, JUSTICE WIQAR AHMAD
lady Dr. Rukhsana Bashir recorded during proceedings
u/s 512 Cr.P.C as PW-7. Then, statement of the accused
was recorded u/s 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he denied the
allegations of prosecution, however he neither wished to
be examined on oath nor desired to produce evidence in
defence. On conclusion of trial, the trial Court vide
Judgment dated 08.02.2019 convicted & sentenced the

appellant in the manner mentioned above, hence, this

appeal. ~
4. Arguments heard and record perused.
5. It is evident from the impugned judgment

that the report of Lady Dr. Rukhsana Bashir, who had
examined the dead body of the deceased, was considered
by the learned trial Court only on the strength of her
transposed statement recorded during proceedings u/s 512
Cr.P.C as PW-7. However, she was not examined before
the learned trial Court. She was alive and posted at
HMC Peshawar. In this regard, the learned trial Court
has examined Iqbal-ud-Din, Junior Clerk DHQ Hospital
Timergara as CW-2, which is reproduced for ready

reference;

No doubt, several summons were issued in
the name of the said PW/lady doctor, however, coercive
measures for procuring her attendance were not adopted
by the learned trial Court and on 19.01 .2019, her
statement recorded during proceedings u/s 512 Cr.P.C as
PW-7 was transposed to the present trial on the basis of
an unjustified ground on record that she could not be
traced. Thus, said transposition would not be conclusive
because the witness was alive, healthy and still serving at
HMC Peshawar. Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan
while giving its judgment in the case of “Naseer Khan v/s
Said Qadeem & others” (2020 SCMR 293) in a situation
where statement of the prosecution witness was
transposed for the reason that he was living abroad and
upheld the decision of this Court, wherein transposition
of statements of witnesses under section 512 Cr.P.C was

not approved by observing that;

“Be that as it may the fact remains that before
the trial in the present criminal case had come
to a close and before a stage was reached
when the learned trial court could consider
the evidentiary value of the un-cross-
examined statements of the prosecution
witnesses recorded under section 512, Cr.P.C.
respondent No. 1, had been arrested and he
was brought before the learned trial court to
face his trial. This, therefore, was a case
where before conclusion of his trial
respondent No. | had appeared before the
learned trial court and he wanted an
opportunity to cross-examine the above
mentioned prosecution witnesses which
opportunity was denied to him by the learned

SepzAl" (0.8) HON:OLE MA, JUSTICE ISHTIAG JGRAHIM
HON:BLE MR, JUSTICE WIQAR AHMAD
trial court. After introduction of Article 10A
in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of
Pakistan, 1973 fair trial has become a
fundamental right and now in all situations
wherein an apparent injustice may appear to
be imminent a trial court is to resolve such
issues in the light of the cherished principles
of fairness, particularly when no_ serious
prejudice is likely to be caused to the opposite
party. The learned counsel for the petitioner
has maintained before us that the prosecution
witnesses who had got their statements
recorded under section 512, Cr.P.C. are
presently working out of the country and,
thus, the complainant party is in no position
to produce them before the learned trial court
again. We have, however, remained unable to
subscribe to this submission of the learned
counsel for the petitioner because the case in
hand is a State case and it is not the
responsibility of the complainant party to
produce witnesses before the trial court. In
such a case it is the responsibility of the State
to produce its witnesses before the trial court
and if the State fails to do that then it is for
the court itself to use all permissible methods

for procuring attendance of such witnesses
even if it has to resort to some coercive

measures.”
(Underlined supplied)

This Court too while rendering judgment in

the case of “Jbraheem Khan v/s The State through A.A.G

& another” (2021 YLR 995 ) has observed that; .

“In the case in hand also the mere statement
of DFC was made the basis for transporting
the statement of the prosecution witness
recorded under section 512, Cr.P.C, which
was not a safer course and cannot be allowed
in the circumstances of the case. It was a
serious issue as the accused had been facing
trial under the charge of commission of an
offence carrying a capital punishment. The
importance of the witness both for the
prosecution as well as the defence also
required that the learned trial Court should
have exercised due diligence in the matter.
Being the sole eye-witness of the occurrence
as well as complainant in the case he was not
only important for the prosecution but for the
defence as well (for the purpose of his cross-
examination). His cross-examination would

Sabz At (0.8) HON:BLE MR, JUSTICE ISHTIAG I9RAHIM
HON-BLE MR, JUSTICE WIGQAR AHMAD
have also been beneficial for the trial Court as
well as this Court for achieving its due
satisfaction for the purpose of safe
administration of justice.

8. By now the right to a fair trial has
been included in the fundamental rights of a
citizen by insertion of Article 10(A) in the
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan,
1973. Safeguards earlier taken by the Hon'ble
Courts in our jurisdiction were mostly
anchored in criminal procedural laws, beside
those developed in judge made laws in
pursuance to the intrinsic desire of the
Hon'ble Courts for ensuring right of fair trial
to the accused. But now the situation requires
added care and caution as the nature of right
to fair trial has been converted from a legal
right to a fundamental right by way of the
Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act
2010. Right to cross-examination is the most
cherished part of the right of an accused
during the trial. The said right may or may
not prove beneficial to the accused in a
particular case but same has always been
beneficial to the Courts in deciphering the
hidden facts, in discovering the real issues, in
uncovering the buried realities and thus
reaching at the right and just conclusions. It is
due to the efficacy of this practice of cross-
examination that Courts of law are able to
unearth the reality and discover the facts even
from mouths of untruthful witnesses. section
512, Cr.P.C. is not the normal course but an
exception to the normal practice of
conducting a criminal trial. As held by the
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of "Arbab
Tasleem v. The State" reported as "PLD 2010
Supreme Court 642" the general rule of
evidence is that only such statement is legal
and admissible which is given during the
course of judicial proceedings on oath and is
taken by a person authorized under the law to
take down the evidence and it is made in the
presence of the adverse party giving him right
to cross-examine the deponent. It further
provided that there were two exceptions to the
general rule one being an exception provided
by Article 46 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984 which is commonly known as dying
declaration and the.other being a statement of
a witness recorded under section 512, Cr.P.C.
A statement under section 512, Cr.P.C. being
an exception to the general rule can only be
resorted to when the conditions precedent for
adopting such a practice are adhered to.”

The perusal of record transpires that the
learned trial Court has not taken concrete steps for
procuring attendance of the prosecution witness namely
lady Dr. Rukhsana Bashir. The essential precautions to be
taken before allowing transposition of statement of a PW
have not at all been taken into consideration by the
learned trial Court. In such circumstances, reading of her
statement as evidence of the prosecution would definitely
have the potential of causing prejudice to the case of the
appellant. In this case, the witness was admittedly alive
and the only factor that she was posted at Peshawar is not
a satisfactory excuse of the prosecution qua her not
production before the Court. Needless to say that no
substantial evidence was brought on record by the
prosecution to prove that the transposed PW namely lady
Dr. Rukhsana Bashir was living abroad or due to any
other valid reason, she was unable to appear before the
learned trial Court during trial. In other words, procuring
attendance of the transposed PW was neither impossible,
nor inconvenient for the prosecution. It was also not the
case that her attendance could be procured only with an
inordinate delay. Undeniably, statement of a witness

recorded under section 512 Cr.P.C may be allowed to be

Sapz al (0.8) HON-OLE MR, JUSTICE ISHTIAG IBRAHIM
transposed to the record of trial of an absconding accused
who is arrested later on, but only in the cases where
procuring of attendance of such a witness is really a
difficult task for the prosecution in a sense that the
amount of delay or expense required for procuring his
attendance is found unreasonable in circumstances of the

case, which is not the case before us.

6. In view of the foregoing discussion, we do
not find anything on the record that the learned trial Court
has made sufficient efforts for procuring attendance of
the witness namely lady Dr. Rukhsana Bashir before
ordering her statement to be transposed to the record of
trial of the appellant and thus considering her statement
in the impugned judgment has prejudiced the appellant.
Hence, remand of the case to the learned trial Court for
procuring attendance of the lady doctor in accordance
with law is inevitable. This appeal is therefore allowed,
the impugned judgment is set aside and case is remanded
to: the learned trial Court with directions to adopt all
possible & coercive measures for procuring attendance of

PW lady Dr. Rukhsana Bashir, including attachment of

her salary. It is responsibility of the State to procure

f

attendance of a witness as held by Hon’ble Supreme

Court of Pakistan in the case of Naseer Khan Supra, as

such, a copy of this Judgment should be forwarded to the
Worthy Director General Prosecution Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa as well as worthy Director General Health
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for ensuring attendance of the
witness before the learned trial Court, without any
amount of delay. Even then, if the PW is either
untraceable or her attendance cannot be procured without
an amount of delay, expense or inconvenience or she is
incapable of giving statement then the learned trial Court
shall pass an appropriate order regarding transposition of
her statement recorded during proceedings u/s 512 Cr.P.C
in accordance with law. Thereafter statement of the
accused shall also be recorded u/s 342 Cr.P.C. The parties
shall appear before the learned trial Court on 20.10.2021.
The appellant shall be treated as under trial prisoner. The
needful be done positively within a period of 02 months
positively after the above referred date i.e. 20.10.2021.
