JUDGMENT
WIQAR AHMAD, J- Appellant is aggrieved of
his conviction and “sentence awarded vide order
dated 05.12.2019 of the Court of learned
Additional Sessions Judge-l/Judge Special
Court Swat in case FIR No. 1462 dated
05.11.2018 registered under section 9 (b) CNSA
at Police Station Mingora District Swat. )
an FIR in the case in hand
was registered on the basis of ‘Murasila’
(Ex. PW-1/3), wherein it was narrated that the
local police got information that appellant had
been busy in selling narcotics. In pursuance to

receipt of such information the local police went

NAWAB (0.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlaq !brahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
to the spot on 05.1 1.201 8, where they arrested the
appellant at 16:45 hours. During his body search,
the local police recovered 106 grams heroin from
his side pocket.. They separated one gram of
heroin as representative sample, sealed it
separately in parcel No. 1 for the purpose of
chemical analysis in Forensic Science Laboratory
(hereinafter referred to as “FSL”). 105 grams of
heroin was separately sealed in parcel No. 2. ©
Recovery memo Bx, PW-1/1 was also prepared
separately. Card of arrest of appellant Ex. PW-
1/2 was also issued. The allegedly recovered
contraband was sent to FSL for the purpose of
chemical analysis, report whereof was received,
indicating that the representative sample was
heroin.

3. On completion of investigation,
complete challan was put in Court on
22.11.2018. Charge was framed against appellant
on 21.01.2019. The accused did not plead guilty
to the charge and claimed trial. During trial, an
application was filed by. the appellant for
deciding the case on the basis of pleading his
guilt. The learned trial Court accordingly

NAWAB (D.B) Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Ishtlaq !brahimn
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
announced its order dated 05.12.2019 whereby
the appellant was convicted for commission of an
offence under section 9 (b) CNSA and was
sentenced for four (04) days simple
imprisonment. Feeling aggrieved from his
conviction and sentence appellant has filed the
instant criminal appeal.

4. Learned counsel for appellant stated
that the stigma of conviction in a case under
section 9 (b) CNSA, has been causing great
hardships to the appellant. He further added that
application had been obtained from the appellant
by the Court staff, in absence of his counsel and
he had been convicted on the application despite
the fact that he had not pleaded guilty to the
charge on 21.01.2019 and had been contesting
the allegations leveled therein. He also added that
"a number of prosecution witnesses had already
been examined and had the appellant been having
the intention of pleading guilty, he would have
done $0 at the start of trial.

5. | Learned counsel appearing on
behalf of State raised an objection towards
maintainability of the instant appeal and stated

NAWAB (0.8) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
that an appeal against conviction based on
pleading of guilty is not maintainable.

6. We have heard arguments of
learned counsel for appellant, learned
counsel appearing on behalf of State and perused
the record.

7. | Perusal of record reveals that when
charge was framed on 21.01.2019 the appellant
did not plead guilty thereto. He had contested the
allegations of the prosecution and had claimed
innocence. Statements of four prosecution
witnesses have been recorded on different dates
thereafter. It was on 05.12.2019 that thumb
impression of the appellant has been shown
obtained on a preprinted form, wherein certain
blank spaces have been filled with black ink. On
the said date second charge was framed, and that
also on preprinted form wherein blank spaces
have just been filled with black ink. The
appellant was shown to have pleaded his guilt to
this charge by affixing his thumb impression.
Statement of the appellant has also been shown
recorded on a preprinted form in the ‘above-
mentioned manner, but strangely enough, it

NAWAB {D.B) Hon’ble Mr, Justice Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
indicates a date of 05.1 1.2019. Record in the trial
had been transferred to the learned trial Court on
04.12.2019, wherein notice had been issued to
appellant for the following date ie. 05.12.2019.
On said date all the above-mentioned proceedings
have been shown conducted, but in absence of
counsel for the appellant. Appellant had already
engaged a counsel in the trial and was being
represented through his counsel, but the day he
has been shown to have pleaded his guilt, all the
proceedings have been conducted in absence of
his counsel. It is strange that the appellant had
once been charge-sheeted, wherein he had
pleaded innocence and claimed trial, then how
was a second charge framed in the case? Such a
procedure adopted by the learned trial Court in
the case in hand, is totally alien to the law of
criminal procedure governing the trial.

8. Section 265-D Cr.P.C provides that
if the trial Court is of the opinion, after perusing
the police report or the complaint, all other
documents and statements filed by the
prosecution, that there is ground for proceeding

with the trial of the accused it shall frame a

NAWAB. ({0.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
charge against the accused in writing. Section
265- E (1) requires that charge so framed, shall
be read and explained to the accused and he shall
be asked whether he is guilty or has any defence
to make. Sub-section (2) thereof provides that if
the accused pleads guilty the Court shall record
the plea, and may in its discretion convict him
thereon. Section 265-F CPC provides that if the
accused does not plead guilty or the Court in its
discretion does not convict him on his plea, the
Court shall proceed to hear the complaint and
take all such evidence as may be produced in
support of the prosecution.

9. Once charge was framed and the
appellant did not plead guilty to it, prosecution
was asked to lead its evidence wherein statements
of four prosecution witnesses had also been
recorded. There was no occasion for the trial
Court to have framed a second charge, and that
also in the manner as stated above. This Court in
its earlier judgment in the case of “Habib-ur
Rehman v/s The State” reported as 1997 P Cr.
LJ 1930, while faced with a similar situation has

held;

NAWAB (0.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
“

The discretion in recording conviction on
plea of guilty has also got nexus to the
punishment, In case of a charge of carrying
minor punishment the Court may on the plea of
guilt by the accused convict him there and then
but where the charge is of an offence carrying
capital punishment of death or transportation of
life, the Court is required to examine the
prosecution evidence even if the guilt is admitted
-by the accused in response to a charge, as
discussed ‘in the case of Loung v. The State 1976
PCr.LJ 204, After complying with section 265-E,
Cr.P.C., and when the accused did not plead
guilty and claimed trial, there is no other way for
the Court but to call for the prosecution evidence
in support of the charge from the stage when the
charge‘was charged and answered by the accused
till the statement of the accused under section
342, CrP.C. and the conclusion of the
Prosecution evidence. There is no other stage or
section of law enabling the Court to ask the
accused of the charge Ievel.leu against him. After
pleading not guilty the accused can only be
allowed to accept the charge in his statement
under section 342, Cr.P.C.”

Conviction recorded in the instant
case has not been made according to law, nor was
the sentence justified on the basis of such a
conviction.

10. So far as objection of the learned
State counsel regarding maintainability of the
instant appeal, is concerned, it has no doubt been
provided under section 412 Cr.P.C that a
conviction based on plead of guilt of an accused
Shall not be appealable and a limited window of

appeal has only been provided therein. Said

NAWAB (D.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
provision of law being relevant is reproduced

hereunder for ready reference;

S412, No appeal in certain cases when accused
pleads _guilty. Notwithstanding anything
hereinbefore contained where an accused
person has pleaded guilty and has been
convicted by a High Court, a Court of Session
or Magistrate of the first class on such plea,
there shall be no appeal except as to the extent
or legality of the sentence.”

There is no doubt that an accused
who plead guilty cannot appeal against his
conviction, and he can only impugn the resultant
sentence in its legality and magnitude. But the
High Court, while dealing with such an appeal,
may also look into legality of the conviction
under the powers vested in it by section 439
Cr.P.C. Hon’ble Dhaka High Court in its
judgment given in the case of “Loung v/s The
State reported as 1976 P Cr.LJ 204 has held, in
this respect, as follow;

“The discretion in recording conviction on plea
of guilty has also got nexus to the punishment.
In case of a charge of carrying minor
punishment the Court may on the plea of guilt
by the accused convict him there and then but
where the charge is of an offence carrying
capital punishment of death or transportation of
life, the Court is required to examine the
prosecution evidence even if the guilt is
admitted .by the accused in response to a
charge, as discussed ‘in the case of Loung v.

The State 1976 PCr.LJ 204, After complying
with section 265-E, Cr.P.C.,, and when the

NAWAB (D.8) Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
accused did not plead guilty and claimed trial,
there is no other way for the Court but to call
for the prosecution evidence in support of the
charge from the stage when the charge. was
charged and answered by the accused till the
Statement of the accused under section 342,
Cr.P.C, and the conclusion of the prosecution
evidence. There is no other stage or section of
law enabling the Court to ask the accused of the
charge Ievel.leu against him. After pleading not
guilty the accused can only be allowed to accept
the charge in his statement under section 342,
CrP.C.”

Further reliance may also be placed
on judgment of the Hon’ble Baluchistan High
Court in the case of “Nehal Khan v/s The State
reported as 2003 P Cr. LJ 1278.

11. In light what has been discussed
above, the instant appeal is allowed, conviction
and sentence recorded vide impugned order dated
05.12.2019, framing of a second charge
as well as the procedure adopted for recording
statement of appellant dated 05.11.2019 are set
aside. Learned trial Court shall conduct trial from
the stage where it had been transferred to it on
04.12.2019 and shall proceed further according to
law. The appellant is directed to appear
before learned trial Court on 03.11.2020.
Since the appellant has already been

granted bail by learned trial Court during the

NAWAB (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-10-

course of trial, therefore same concession shall be
available to him subject to his furnishing bail
bonds in the sum of Rs. 50,000/- with two
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction
of learned trial Court. Said bonds ‘shall be
submitted before the learned trial Court within a
period of one week after receipt of judgment
from this Court.
