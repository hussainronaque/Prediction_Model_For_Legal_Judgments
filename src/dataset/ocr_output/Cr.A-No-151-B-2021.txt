SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.— The appellants Umer Gul and

Said Awal Badshah alias Bhutto have called in question the
judgment dated 09.9.2021, rendered by learned Additional
Sessions Judge, Karak at Takht-e-Nasrati, whereby they have
been convicted under section 302(b) of the Pakistan Penal
Code and sentenced to life imprisonment as Ta’zir with
Rs.5,00,000/- (five lac), as compensation under section 544-A
Cr.P.C. to be paid to the legal heirs of the deceased or in
default thereof, to undergo six months simple imprisonment.
The appellants were also convicted under sections 324/34
P.P.C and sentenced to undergo five years rigorous
imprisonment, each convict shall also pay fine to the tune of

Rs. 50,000/- and in default thereof shall further undergo S.I
for three months. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C was

extended to the convict/appellants.

2. The complainant Hidayat Ullah moved criminal
revision petition No.40-B/2021 for enhancement of sentence
of the appellants. Since both the matters have arisen out of
one and the same judgment, therefore, we intend to decide the

same through this common judgment.

3. Brief facts of the case according to narration of
the F.LR, are that on 28.02.2018 at 10:00 hours complainant
Hidayat Ullah along with the dead body of his uncle Hazrat
Bilal lodged report to the local police in emergency room of
Civil Hospital Takht-e-Nasrati to the effect that on the day of
incident he and his deceased uncle went out from their house
and proceeded to NADRA office Taikht-e-Nasrati for
renewal of CNIC of the deceased Hazrat Bilal. After
submission of form in NADRA office, they went out from
NADRA office and started towards their house. After
covering some distance both the convict/appellants came to
the place of incident on motorcycle. On seeing the
complainant party, accused Bhutto commanded his co-
accused Umer Gul to kill, upon which accused Umer Gul
drew his pistol and started firing at them, as a result of which

Hazrat Bilal got hit, sustained injuries and died on the spot
while the complainant escaped unhurt luckily. The accused
decamped from the spot on their motorcycle, driven by
accused Bhutto, after the occurrence. Motive for the offence
was stated to be based on the honour of women folk. Hence,

the F.LR (ibid).

4, On completion of investigation, the prosecution
submitted challan against the accused before the trial Court
where at the commencement of trial, the prosecution
produced and examined as many as thirteen (13) witnesses,
whereafter, statements of the accused were recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein they professed innocence and
false implication, however, neither they wished to be
examined on oath as provided under section 340(2) Cr.P.C,
nor opted to produce defence evidence. After hearing
arguments from both the sides, the learned trial Court vide
impugned judgment dated 09.9.2021, convicted the accused/
appellants and sentenced them, as mentioned above. Hence,
the instant criminal appeal and the connected criminal

revision.

5. We have heard learned counsel for the parties
alongwith learned A.A.G for the State at length and with their

valuable assistance, the record was gone through.
6. The unfortunate incident claimed life of the deceased
when after accomplishing his task in the local NADRA office
was leaving the premises in the company of the complainant.
The deceased after receiving firearm injuries was rushed to
Civil Hospital Takht-e-Nasrati, where the complainant
reported the matter to the local police, charging the
appellants for death of the deceased. The police after
receiving information reached to the hospital and after
drafting the Murasila, injury-sheet and inquest report of the
deceased were prepared. The dead body was sent to the
doctor under the escort of a constable for post mortem
examination. The dead body was received by the doctor a
little before 10:30 am. who started his post mortem
examination at 10:30 a.m. The investigating officer after
receiving copy of the F.I.R, visited the spot and on pointation
of the complainant prepared the site plan. During spot
inspection the investigating officer collected blood stained
earth from place of the deceased and two empties of .30 bore
from the place of the accused. The convict/ appellants were
arrested and after framing of the charge the trial commenced
which on conclusion led to the conviction of the appellants as
stated above. The appellants feeling aggrieved approached

this Court through the instant criminal appeal.
7. The record was scanned through with the
valuable assistance of learned counsel for the parties with the
only quest to know as to whether the learned trial court was
Justified to convict the appellants. Though the learned trial
judge after application of his judicial mind to the collected
material and recorded statements held the appellants
responsible for death of the deceased, but we are to see as to
whether the approach of the learned trial Court was correct
and as to whether the available evidence was properly
appreciated. As life and liberty of the appellants are involved,
so this Court is under the obligation to re-assess the available
evidence, so that to ascertain as to whether the reasons given
by the learned trial judge get support from the available
record. If on one hand we have the deceased with a bereaved
family waiting for justice, on the other we have the appellants
and their family looking for fair trial as Court is the custodian
of the rights of the people involved, so the life and liberty of
the people is a sacred trust which the Court must protect.
True that in the incident two accused were charged, one for
facilitation and the other for effective fire-shots and that the
effective role of firing has been attributed to the convict/
appellant Umer Gul, so in essence it is the case of a single
accused. True that in case of a single accused substitution is a

rare phenomenon, but equally true that the same is not the
rule of thumb, under all circumstances the courts are to
search for independent corroboration. The charge against a
single accused will never absolve the courts of its liability to
search for corroboration and also to apply its judicial mind to
the collected material and in no circumstances where a single
accused is charged, he is to be held responsible for
commission of the offence, under all circumstances, this is
and this should be the responsibility of both the trial as well
as the Court of appeal to take extra care in case of single
accused to avoid miscarriage of justice. In the instant case we
have before us the complainant as a single eye witness, but
even here the prosecution should not suffer as it is the quality
and not the quantity of evidence which is to be produced. In
the attending circumstances of the present case when on one
side there is a single accused charged for effective firing
upon the deceased, waiting for his fate, we have the single
eye witness as well to depose against the appellant and in
such circumstances we must walk with extra care to punish
the guilty and to rescue the innocent.

8. The incident occurred in a local market where
office of National Database & Registration Authority
(NADRA) is situated. It is the case of the prosecution that the
deceased along with the complainant left his house to get his

Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) renewed; that
after doing the needful when the deceased left the office in
the company of the complainant, the assailants i.e. the
convict/appellants attracted to the spot and started firing at
the deceased. The record tells that out of the two the
appellant Said Awal Badshah was riding the motorcycle
whereas appellant Umer Gul was occupying the pillion; that
on reaching to the place of incident, the appellant Umer Gul
started firing at the deceased who after receiving firearm
injuries fell to the ground and the convict/ appellant Umer
Gul was driven away by his co-accused on his motorcycle
from the place of incident. It is pertinent to mention that
adjoining to the place of incident the local police station is
situated, but the deceased soon after receiving firearm
injuries was shifted to Tehsil Head Quarters Hospital Takht-
e-Nasrati with the only hope to save his life, but it could not
be saved. The local police after hearing about the occurrence
rushed to the hospital where the complainant reported the
matter and the Murasila was drafted. It was argued by learned
counsel for the appellants that the complainant was not
present at the time of incident and that his attendance was
procured from his village. In order to appreciate this
particular aspect of the case we deem it essential to scan
through the record of the case. There is no denial to the fact

that the village of both the deceased and the complainant is
situated at about 20/25 kilometers away from the place of
incident and that in such a quick succession the procurement
of the complainant from his village is beyond imagination. In
order to ascertain as to whether the submissions of the
learned counsel for the appellants has substance in it, we feel
it appropriate to go through the report made by the
complainant. The record tells that the incident occurred at
09:40 a.m. whereas the matter was reported at 10:00 a.m. in
hospital to the local police. The record further transpires that
the dead body was received by the doctor at 10:15 a.m. and
he started his post mortem examination at 10:30 a.m. The
quick succession of events rebut the submissions of the
learned counsel for the appellants and we see no possibility
or interest on part of the police officials to procure the person
of their choice to report the matter and as such he was termed
as an interested witness, but we are not in agreement with the
learned counsel for the appellant and even the apex court
took an otherwise view in case titled “Talib _Hussan_and

another Vs the State and another (2009 SCMR 825).

“As regards the contention raised by
the learned counsel for appellant
Shahid Mahmood that since ocular
evidence consists of interested
witnesses, therefore, it could not have
been believed, it may be pointed out

here that no doubt eye-witnesses in the
instant case are related to the deceased
but they by no stretch of imagination
could be termed or regarded as
interested witnesses. It is well-settled
that an interested witness is one who is
partisan or inimical towards the
accused or has a motive previously or
cause of his own to falsely implicate
the accused in the crime. Mere
relationship of a witness with the
deceased or the very fact that he is
interested in prosecution of the
accused on account of the occurrence,
would not dub him as an interested
witness.”

9. The site plan depicts that the prosecution
succeeded in establishing the place of incident as the
investigating officer collected two empties of .30 bore from
the place of the accused and blood stained earth from the
place of the deceased. The collected empties were sent to the
Fire Arms Expert wherefrom an opinion was received that
the empties were fired from one weapon. We are to see as to
whether the complainant was accompanying the deceased
from his village to the place of incident, the record tells, yes
he was accompanying the deceased at the relevant time as it
was he who with the help of the people, available at the place
of incident, shifted the deceased to the hospital and reported

the matter within 20 minutes. The complainant was examined
-10-

as PW-7 who stated that on the day of incident he along with
the deceased left his village, as the deceased was intending to
renew his CNIC; that they left their village and reach the
NADRA office where the deceased stood in a queue and
thereafter succeeded in submitting his documents regarding
the renewal of his CNIC. It was questioned time and again
that neither the complainant produced the relevant documents
to the investigating officer to establish their presence and
purpose nor the investigating officer collected anything from
the office in that regard. True that none of the sides could
produce and could collect the same, but equally true that the
deceased lost his life near the NADRA office which was his
destination. The defence could not succeed to tell otherwise
as the complainant and the deceased had no other purpose in
the vicinity. The learned counsel for the appellants invited
the attention of this Court to the lack of interest on the part of
the investigating officer to record statements of independent
witnesses. True that the investigating officer did not record
statements of officials from the NADRA office, but that
alone will not discredit the eye witness account, rather the
defence is to travel an extra mile to convince us otherwise. It
is interesting to note that during trial the complainant
submitted an application along with the renewed CNIC of the

deceased, to the trial Court with a request for requisitioning
-ll-

the relevant record from the concerned NADRA office and to
place on record copy of the renewed CNIC of the deceased.
Though the application could not pave its way to achieve the
desired target, but copy of the renewed identity card is still
available on file. For the ends of justice we put a glance over
the attested copy of the identity card submitted before the
Court, we found the date of issuance as 31.3.2018. There is a
common practice in the NADRA office that when applicant
approaches for renewal of the CNIC after submitting the
relevant documents a token is issued and it takes nearly two
months in getting the renewed copy, while applying the
ordinary mode. The date of occurrence and date of renewal of
CNIC of the deceased leaves no ambiguity that the deceased
visited the NADRA office on the day of incident. We could
not subscribe to the submissions made by the learned counsel
for the appellants regarding non-examination of witnesses
from the nearby shops and of the officials witnesses from
NADRA office, regarding its adverse impact on the
prosecution case, as the complainant succeeded in
establishing on record that on the day of incident he in the
company of the deceased visited the office. The defence
could not succeed in discrediting the veracity of the
complainant and it could not convince us to hold another

view. The record is silent regarding the interest of the
-12-

complainant to charge the appellants for ulterior motive. True
that the relation between the convict/appellant Umer Gul
with the deceased was strained as mother of the appellant
was killed many years back which put both the families at
daggers drawn. The attending circumstances of the present
case leave no ambiguity in mind that the incident occurred in
the mode and manner and at the stated time.

10. The post mortem was conducted on the dead
body of the deceased at 10:30 a.m. where the doctor gave the
detail of the injuries caused. It was highlighted that the
injuries were from up to downwards and that the same were
possible only and only when the assailants occupies a place
in height, but we are not persuaded as it is for the bullet to
choose a passage for itself. Even otherwise when the bullet
touches the hard surface then it always changes its direction
and the present case is no exception. The presence of the
complainant was questioned on the plea that neither the
complainant was cited as a witness of identification in the
column of the inquest report nor in the relevant column of the
post mortem report and that the witnesses so cited belong to
the village of the complainant and that the same tells nothing,
but that the matter was reported after preliminary
investigation. We are not persuaded with what the learned

counsel for the appellants submitted as we could not gather
-13-

any interest of the police officials from the record to procure
the attendance of the complainant from his village, as the
complainant was the sole eye witness, so it was not necessary
for him to be the complainant as well as identifier of the dead
body, but as the prosecution succeeded in proving its case to
the hilt, so this plea of the appellants is hardly of any service
to them. It is not obligatory that the complainant must be the
witness of identification in every criminal case, rather the
importance of his identification varies from case to case and
the present case is no exception. The time given by the
doctor between injury and death and between the death and
post mortem leaves no ambiguity that the deceased lost his
life at the stated time. We are conscious of the fact and so is
held by the superior courts that the medical evidence is
confirmatory in nature, but we cannot forget that in presence
of strong eye witness account the medical evidence is to play
a little role, as this evidence is confirmatory in nature, so its
weakness otherwise has no impact on the prosecution’s case
provided it otherwise succeeds, as in the present case right
from the beginning till the end the complainant succeeded in
establishing his presence on the spot and he succeeded in
convincing us in respect of the mode and manner of the
occurrence, so we are not persuaded to form another view.

As there is no conflict between the eye witness account and
-14-

the medical evidence, so we are not in a happy mood to dilate
anymore on this particular aspect of the case.

11. True that both the investigating officer and the
complainant could not bring on record independent evidence
in respect of the alleged motive, but that alone will not help
the appellants. There is no cavil to the proposition that
weakness or absence of a motive in itself is not sufficient to
discredit the veracity of the witnesses and overshadow the
clarity of the prosecution case. Weakness or absence of
motive plays a little role, that too, in different cases. It is not
the yardstick that in all cases where the alleged motive could
not be established the prosecution will suffer, rather the same
can be pressed into service for limited purpose, more
particularly in determining quantum of sentence.

12. The moot question for determination before this
Court is to see as to whether the learned trial court was
justified to convict the appellants under section 302(b) P.P.C
and as to whether both the appellants played the same role.
There is no denial to the fact that the appellant Said Awal
Badshah has been attributed the role of facilitation and
according to the prosecution it was he who brought the actual
culprit to the place of incident and we are to see as to whether
the prosecution succeeded in establishing this particular

aspect of the case. We are confronted with a situation where
-15-

two accused are charged for the death of the deceased one
with effective fire shots whereas the other with the role of
Lalkara and facilitation. In order to appreciate this aspect of
the case we deem it essential to travel through the collected
evidence once again. The complainant while making report
attributed the role of effective fire shots to the appellant
Umer Gul whereas to the co-accused the role of command
and facilitation was attributed. In order to see as to whether
the co-accused had an interest in the episode and as to
whether the prosecution succeeded in creating a nexus
between the co-accused and the motive, we deem it
appropriate to revisit the attending circumstances of the
present case. In order to gauge the role played by the co-
accused it is a must that the background which led to the
death of the deceased, be taken into consideration. Right
from the beginning till the end the prosecution could not
succeed in establishing the relationship between the appellant
Said Awal Badshah and the deceased and even the
investigating officer could not collect anything in positive,
that both the accused shared common intention. This is
interesting to note that the role of command has been
attributed to convict/appellant Said Awal Badshah, but the
record is silent that what prompted him to command the

appellant Umer Gul, to kill the deceased. When the appellant
-16-

Said Awal Badshah had nothing against the deceased then in
such eventuality it does not appeal to a prudent mind that he
would ask the co-accused to kill the deceased as the motive
was stated to be between Umer Gul and the deceased. It was
disclosed that many years back mother of the convict/
appellant Umer Gul was done to death where the deceased
was held responsible for killing of his mother. When the
motive was between the two i.e. the deceased and the
appellant Umer Gul then it was Umer Gul who was to take
the revenge and in that eventuality there was hardly an
occasion for the co-accused to command. If we take what the
complainant stated to be correct then the command is always
issued by a person whose interest is greater than the killer,
but in the present case it was the appellant Umer Gul who
had a greater interest in the deceased than the co-accused.
The prosecution could not collect any positive evidence
which could help us in forming an opinion that the convict/
appellant Said Awal Badshah had shared common intention
with the principal accused. It was argued that the principal
accused was brought to the spot on motorcycle by the co-
convict and that his facilitation in killing the deceased speaks
nothing, but that he too was equally responsible for the death
of the deceased. We cannot ignore the importance attached to

section 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code, the intent and purpose
-17-

of the legislature behind, but while convicting an accused,
that too, for sharing common intention, extra ordinary
circumstances and confidence inspiring evidence is needed.
It is simple to charge for sharing common intention, but it is
not so simple to convict as much is needed from the
prosecution to establish a charge against an accused charged
under this particular section of law. The record tells that the
co-convict Said Awal Badshah is not the resident of either of
the village of the complainant or the principal accused and
even the record is silent regarding his previous ill-will both
the complainant and the deceased. Despite efforts we could
not lay hands on any substantial evidence which could
convince us that he shared common intention with the
principal accused and that it was he who facilitated him in
coming to the place of incident. Though while reporting the
matter it was mentioned by the complainant that the accused/
appellant arrived to the place of incident on a motorcycle, but
neither the registration number nor the model of the
motorcycle was disclosed. The investigating officer could not
collect any documentary evidence which could tell that it was
the ownership of the co-convict Said Awal Badshah and in
such eventuality we lurk no doubt in mind that the
prosecution could not succeed in connecting the appellant

Said Awal Badshah with commission of the offence, that too,
-18-

under section 34 P.P.C. We are conscious of the fact that the
complainant is the sole witness of the incident and that
bifurcation of both the appellants in respect of commission of
the offence is a bit tricky, but while bifurcating the role of the
co-convict the prosecution story will not suffer to an extent to
dislodge its credibility against the principal accused as the
role of the co-convict is that of facilitator and of command,
so the complainant could not bring material against him to
convince this Court regarding his involvement with the
purpose and that alone is sufficient to tell that the co-convict
Said Awal Badshah needs benefits of the same. As is held in

case titled “Ali Hussain and another Vs Mukhtar and two

others” (1983 SCMR 806).

“As regards the appeals of the other two
accused/respondents Sabi and Mukhtar, we
do not find any evidence to saddle them with
the responsibility of sharing common
intention with Mumtaz accused/appellant.
They might have been present at the time of
occurrence and played the role attributed to
them but without knowing that Mumtaz
accused/appellant would whip out a knife
and cause a fatal injury to the deceased.
Thus, appeal against the acquittal of Sabir
and = Mukhtar, respondents, stands

dismissed.”
-19-

13. While appreciating the evidence available on file
this Court reaches to an inescapable conclusion that the
prosecution could not succeed in connecting the
accused/convict Said Awal Badshah with commission of the
offence. For what has been discussed above, the instant
criminal appeal is partially accepted, the impugned judgment
of conviction dated 09.9.2021, rendered by learned
Additional Sessions Judge, Karak at Takht-e-Nasrati, is set-
aside to the extent of appellant Said Awal Badshah alias
Bhutto and consequently appellant Said Awal Badshah alias
Bhutto is acquitted of the charges leveled against him. He be
set at liberty forthwith if not required in any other case while
the impugned judgment of conviction to the extent of
appellant Umer Gul is maintained.

14. The connected criminal revision No.40-B/2021
has been filed by the complainant, requesting the
enhancement of the already awarded sentence. Keeping in
view the peculiar circumstances of the present case and the
background of bitterness between the parties, that too, when
mother of the principal accused was killed where the
deceased and others were held responsible, so in that
eventuality it was a sense of revenge that was haunting the
mind of the principal accused who could not resist the same

and killed the deceased. It is the motive between the parties
-20-

which turned to be the cause of killing and when the
circumstances are such then we are not hesitant to hold that
the learned trial Court was fully justified to award the
awarded sentence. We do not see any reason to interference
and as such the instant criminal revision being bereft of merit
is hereby dismissed. As is held in case titled “Amjad Shah
Vs the State (PLD 2017 SC 152).

“Notwithstanding that the participation of the

appellant in the commission of offence is duly

established, his intention, guilty mind or

motive to commit the same remains shrouded

in mystery and is therefore unproven. In such

like cases where the motive is not proved or is

not alleged by the prosecution, the Court for

the sake of safe administration of justice,

adopts caution and treats the lack of motive as

a mitigating circumstance for reducing the

quantum of sentence awarded to a convict.”

These are the detailed reasons of the short order of
even date.
