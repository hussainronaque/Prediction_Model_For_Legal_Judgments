JUDGMENT
Date of hearing. 27.03.2019
Petitioner(s) by: Mr. Zahir Shah Marwat
Advocate.
State by: Mr. Moeenuddin Humayun
AAG.

IKRAMULLAH KHAN, J:- Through the instant

criminal revision petition under Section 435 Cr.PC read
with 439 Cr.PC, petitioner/convict Niazuddin has assailed
the impugned order dated 05.12.2017, rendered by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-II, Charsadda, whereby
application of petitioner/convict for remission of death
penalty on nine(9) counts on the basis of compromise was
turned down.

2. In essence, petitioner/convict alongwith co-
accused Subhanuddin etc were charged in case FIR No.373

dated 14.8.1996 registered under Sections
302/171/449/148/149 PPC, at Police Station Sardheri,
Charsadda. At conclusion of trial, both the accused were
found guilty and they were convicted under Section 302
PPC for the murder of nine deceased and sentenced them to
death under each count by learned trial Court vide
judgment dated 21.12.2002.

3. Lateron, petitioner/convict Niazuddin effected
compromise with legal heirs of deceased and _ filed
application before the learned trial Court for his acquittal
on the basis of compromise. The learned Court below
recorded statements of some of legal heirs of deceased but
some of them well mentioned in the impugned
order/judgment dated 22.12.2014 did not record their
statements, as such provisions contained in Section 345
Cr.PC was not fulfilled therefore, the application of
petitioner/convict under Section 338-E PPC was turned
down by learned trial Court vide above order. Lateron,
petitioner/ convict submitted another application before
the learned trial Court for remission of death sentence on
the basis of compromise, which was also turned down vide
impugned order dated 5.12.2017, hence the instant criminal

revision has been preferred by petitioner/convict for
remission of his death penalty (9 counts) as well as his
release from jail on the basis of partial compromise.

4. The instant case was fixed for 5.3.2019 before
this Court, on which date the left over legal heirs of
deceased appeared in Court and conceded that they have
also effected compromise with the petitioner/convict
however, for satisfaction, this Court sent the case to the
learned trial Court to record statements of those legal heirs
who were not examined during course of pendency of
application under Section 338-E PPC. The learned trial
Court after recording statements of legal heirs submitted its
report before this Court, according to which all the legal
heirs of nine deceased have effected compromise with the
petitioner/ convict.

5. Now adverting to the relief asked by the
present petitioner for his release and remission on the basis
of partial compromise, which in view of Section 345 Cr.PC
was not possible however during pendency of instant
criminal revision petition, as per report of learned trial
Court below, all the legal heirs of nine deceased have
effected compromise with the petitioner/convict so the

relief was amended verbally by learned counsel for
petitioner/convict with the prayer to acquit the petitioner
on the basis of compromise.

6. No doubt, the offences falling under Chapter
XXIV of the Criminal Procedure Code 1898, is
compoundable however, it is admitted that the appeal filed
by petitioner/convict against his conviction has already
been dismissed by this Court and this Court ceased of the
matter while on the other hand sub-section 2 of Section
338-E PPC, empowers, confers jurisdiction only upon the
trial Court for determination.

7. As this is a criminal revision petition, which is
also against an order rendered under Section 338-E PPC, by
learned trial Court below so this Court while exercising its
jurisdiction under Section 435/ 439 Cr.PC, have no
jurisdiction at all to acquit the accused on the basis of
compromise keeping in view sub section 2 of Section 338-E
PPC. However, the application under Section 338-E PPC
filed by petitioner was dismissed by learned trial Court in
view of Section 345 Cr.PC, where compromise was not
effected by all the legal heirs of nine deceased. So now when
all the legal heirs of deceased have effected compromise

with the petitioner/convict therefore, this criminal revision
petition is allowed and the case is remanded to the learned
trial Court in view of sub section 2 of Section 338-E PPC for
further proceedings.
8. Before parting with the judgment, it would be
expedient to give reference to the amendment introduced
through Act XLII of 2016 dated 22.10.2016, which reads
as:-

“Provided further that where an

offence under this Chapter has

been committed and the principle

of fasad-fil-arz is attracted, the

Court having regard to the facts

and circumstances of the case

Shall punish an offender with

imprisonment or fine as provided

for that offence.
9. The learned trial Court after its satisfaction and
hearing both the parties may pass an appropriate, just and
fair order in respect of compromise effected between the
parties keeping in view the recent amendment introduced

in Section 338-E PPC accordingly.

Announced:
27.03.2019.
