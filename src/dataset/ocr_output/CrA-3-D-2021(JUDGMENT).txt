MUHAMMAD _FAHEEM WALI, J.- This
“judament shall also dispose of the connected Criminal
Revision No.01-D/2021, as both the matters are the

outcome of one and the same judgment dated

14.01.2021, rendered by learned Judge, Model

Rs.3,00,000/- (three lacs) to be paid to the legal heirs

2. The prosecution story as disclosed in the
FIR Ex.PA, registered on the basis of murasila
Ex.PA/], in brief, is that on 10.8.2017 at about 20:45
hours, complainant Muhammad Mushtaq (PW-6A),
while present with the dead body of his brother Mehdi
Hassan, reported the matter to the focal police in
emergency room of Civil [Jospital, Paharpur, to the
effect that on said date at about 8:00 PM, after
offering Maghrib prayer, he alongwith his brother
Mehdi Hassan, Muhammad Aslam  (PW-7),
Habibullah and other co-villagers, were on the way to
their houses; that his brother was ahead of them; that
when they reached in a thoroughfare near the house of
one Maulana Muhammad Ali, meanwhile, the accused
appeared, raised Lalkara upon his brother that today
he would not be spared, pulled out his pistol from the
folds of his shalwar and fired at him, as a result
whereof, he was hit and fell! down; that after
commission of the occurrence the accused fled away
from the spot; that they attended to their injured
brother who while shifting to Civil Hospital, Paharpur,
succumbed to his injuries on the way. Besides the
complainant, the occurrence was stated to be
witnessed by Muhammad Aslam (PW-7), Habibullah

and other co-villagers. Motive for the offence was
-3-

stated to be a dispute over the landed property. He
charged the accused for the commission of offence.

3. On completion of the investigation,
complete challan against the accused was submitted
before the learned trial Court where at the
commencement of trial, the prosecution produced and
examined as many as twelve (12) witnesses,
whereafter, statement of the accused under section
342 Cr.P.C, was recorded wherein he professed
innocence and false implication, however, neither he
wished to be examined under section 340(2) Cr.P.C,
nor produced defence evidence. On conclusion of trial
and after hearing arguments, learned trial Court
convicted the appellant and sentenced him, as
mentioned above, which has been assailed by the
appellant through the instant criminal appeal, whereas
the connected criminal revision has been filed for
enhancement of sentence.

4. We have heard the learned counsel
representing the appellant, the learned State Counsel
assisted by learned private counsel at length and with
their valuable assistance, the record was scanned.

5. It is the case of prosccution that on
10.8.2017 at about 8:00 PM, after offering Maghrib
prayer, the complainant alongwith his brother Mehdi

Tassan, Muhammad Aslam (PW-7), Llabibullah and
-4-

other co-villagers, were on the way to their houses;
that brother of the complainant was ahead of them and
when they reached on the spot, the accused appeared,
raised Lalkara upon brother of the complainant that
today he would not be spared, pulled out his pistol
from the folds of his shalwar and fired at him, as a
result of whereof, he was hit and fell down and while
shifting to Civil Hospital, Paharpur, he succumbed to
his injuries on the way. Although the learned trial
Court while rendering the verdict under challenge,
highlighted material aspects of the case, yet this being
the Court of appeal is under obligation to re-assess the
already assessed evidence, in order to avoid
miscarriage of justice. [his Court is to see as to
whether the approach of the learned trial Court to the
material aspects of the case was correct and as to
whether reasons advanced for conviction in the
impugned judgment get support from the material
available on file. We are conscious of the fact that if
on one hand in case of single accused substitution is
held to be the rarest phenomenon, then on the other,
the Court deciding the fate of the accused is under
obligation to scarch for independent corroboration and
must be vigilant while assessing the inherent worth of
the evidence produced. It is advisable that the learned

trial Court in case of a single accused must not be
-5-

swayed with the impulse that substitution is a rare
phenomenon and that it must not take it for granted
that in case of single accused, the prosecution is not
under obligation to prove its case and that once an
accused is charged, he would outrightly be declared
guilty, if the trial Court travels with the impulse then
the criminal justice system will always be in peril and
in that eventuality one cannot think otherwise, but
miscarriage of justice will always occasion which
approach is neither permissible nor finds a room in the
system, as Courts are the custodian of the rights of the
parties and in all eventualitics, they will follow the
guidelines provided and the principles evolved. In the
like situation, it is incumbent upon both the trial as
well as the appellate Court to appreciate the evidence
collected to avoid miscarriage of justice.

6. In the present case, we have observed with
great concern that neither the murasila was signed/
thumb impressed by the complainant, nor Abdur
Rahim constable No.791, who allegedly brought the
murasila to the police station was cited in the calendar
of witnesses. This fact has created a serious dent in the
prosecution case. Fazal Hussain Shah S.I, while
appearing as PW-2, stated before the Court that he
transmitted murasila to the police station through

constable Abdur Rahim No.791. ‘The Moharrir (PW-4)
-6-

also stated that actually the murasila was brought by
said constable, but this alone is not sufficient to
believe that actually the murasila (not signed or thumb
impressed) was brought to the police station by said
constable, when his name does not figure in the
calendar of witnesses, what to talk of his appearance
in the witness box. Ref: ‘Javed and 2 others Vs. The
State’ (2020 YLR Peshawar-311.

7. The case of prosecution mainly hinges on
testimony of the complainant and Muhammad Aslam,
who testified before the Court as PW-6A and PW-7,
respectively, therefore, we would like to discuss their
evidence in the light of principles enunciated by
criminal dispensation of justice. Complainant while
appearing in the witness box narrated almost same
story as mentioned in the FIR, however, he added that
they identified the accused in the light of a bulb lit at
that moment. He further added that after recording his
report the dead body was referred to the Medical
Officer for postmortem while he and PWs Muhammad
Aslam and {abibullah were directed by the police to
reach the spot which they did accordingly and on
reaching the spot, on arrival of the Investigating
Officer, they pointed out the relevant places of their
presence as well as that of the accused. Fic further

added that during the course of investigation the site
-7-

plan was prepared by the Investigating Officer, who
also seized blood from the place of presence of his
brother, one bullet led and three empty shells besides
one live round of pistol from the place of presence of
accused, onc bulb (energy saver) installed in the street
outside the shop of one Muhammad Younas. During
cross-examination, he was confronted with his report
and statement/supplementary statement recorded
during investigation to which the answers tendered by
him were not recorded so, rather it appears that he
made dishonest improvement while testifying in the
witness box. ‘There is no denial to the fact that the
deceased was younger brother of the complainant,
who according to the prosecution story, was ahead of
the complainant and the eyewitnesses, however, it is
not appealable to a prudent mind that elder brother
was following the younger brother which is against
the norms of our socicty. It remained the stance of
complainant that at the time of occurrence, the
deceased was ahead of them, who was fired at by the
accused from front, but his this deposition is totally in
conflict with the medical evidence because the
concerned Medical Officer (PW-5) noted a laccrated
wound over scalp, an entry wound on the back of head
with its exit on left side of nose with visible brain

matter, an entry wound on left side of back (over
-8-

scapula), an irregular wound with everted margin (exit
wound on the front of chest (right side), a round entry
wound with inverted margin on left lumber region and
an irregular cxit wound on left lateral aspect of
abdomen. If the accused had fired upon the deceased
from front side, surely all the bullets should have
landed on front of the deceased, which is not the case
here. Ref: ‘Mansab Ali Vs. The State’ (2019 SCMR
1306). It is also not appealable to common prudence
that soon after making report, the complainant left the
dead body of his brother in the hospital and went to
the spot alongwith the PWs for spot inspection.
Arranging transport for shifting the deceased then
injured to the hospital was also not mentioned in the
FIR. Even the complainant while testifying before the
Court did not mention the source of transportation of
the dead body from the spot to the hospital, in his
examination-in-chief, however, he stated during cross-
examination that the dead body was transported to the
hospital in a pickup. To a question, although he
replicd that one Ramzan was the driver of pickup
through which the injured was transported to the
hospital and said Ramzan attracted there because they
heard the fire shots, however, said Ramzan has not
been cited as witness in the present case to support

stance of the complainant. It is also astonishing when
-9-

he stated that the dead body of his brother was
received by one Mubarak Ali at the hospital after
postmortem examination, but said Mubarak Ali was
abandoned by the prosecution. This witness stated that
the distance between the place of occurrence and
Masjid is about 6/7 paces, which is negated by the
Investigating Officer (PW-8), who stated that the
Masjid was far away from the place of occurrence,
that’s why he had not noted/shown the same in the site
plan. The complainant further testified that the blood
was oozing from the body of injured which may have
stained the cot as well, however, this stance is not
supported by the Investigating Officer, who stated that
he did not remember that whether the hands of the
complainant and the witness were besmeared with the
blood of deceased. Identification of the accused in the
light of bulb, as stated by the complainant in his
statement before the Court, is yet another major
improvement, which can simply be brushed aside. To
this effect, he stated that there was an electric bulb
installed on western side of the wall of shop owned by
one Muhammad Younas, however, he admitted it
correct that he had not stated in his initial report about
the installation of bulb on the shop of Muhammad
Younas. Even otherwise, stance of the complainant is

negated by Muhammad Aslam (PW-7), who stated
-10-

that when the police reached the spot the bulb was lit,
the police officials later brought a search light during
spot inspection and the bulb was not lit at that time.
Even otherwise, the bulb was produced by PW-8 in
pieces. Needless to mention that such type of bulbs
are easily available in the market. Scanning of
statement of this witness shows that it remained a
mystery that where the deceased breathed his last.
Last but not the least, keeping in view the alleged
motive, the complainant was at the mercy of the
accused, but he was not fired at, rather as per stance of
the complainant, before firing the accused raised
Lalkara at his brother. The accused spared the
complainant to create evidence against himself is
nothing but a mystery in itself because the accused
had every opportunity to settle the score keeping in
view the alleged motive. In view of the above, we
have come to an irresistible conclusion that the
complainant was not present at the time of occurrence
and the events of the incident narrated by him are not
in line with the story mentioned in the FIR.

8. The other eyewitness namely Muhammad
Aslam was examined as PW-7, who narrated same
story as mentioned in the FIR with additions as stated
by the complainant in his examination-in-chief,

however, during cross-examination, he stated that the
-ll-

deceased was a little ahead of them. This witness was
confronted with his 161, Cr.P.C. statement and he
gave answers which are not so recorded in said
statement, meaning thereby that he wanted to bring his
deposition in line with the testimony of complainant.
He admitted that the complainant and the deceased are
his maternal cousins. He admitted that his house is
situated at a distance of half kilometer from Masjid.
He explained that it may have taken about five
minutes while carrying the injured on a cot from the
spot to the main road and further 2/3 minutes in
reaching of the pickup. The Datsun driver was called
by another person who after the occurrence ran
towards the house of driver situated nearby, however,
he was unable to recall the name of said person who
informed the driver. This deposition is contradicted by
the complainant, who stated that after hearing the fire
shots the driver himself attracted there. Although he
stated that his hands and clothes were smeared with
blood of injured, however, he admitted that he had not
shown his hands and clothes to the police officer who
recorded the report. Again, it is surprising when he
stated that the distance between the spot and Madjid
would be 8/10 paces, but his this deposition is negated
by the Investigation Officer, as discussed in previous

paragraph. To a question, he answered that he did not
-12-

remember the time at which Mehdi Hassan died. He
also admitted that he had not signed any document in
the hospital, rather he put signatures whenever
required. He further deposed that the police remained
on the spot for half hour when he returned back from
the hospital. It is also astonishing when he stated that
when police reached to the spot the bulb was lit,
however, he stated that the police officials had
subsequently brought a search light during spot
inspection and the bulb was not lit at that time. He
stated that he returned to his house being relieved
from the spot. His deposition regarding firing by the
accused from front side is also negated by the medical
evidence as discussed in previous paragraph. He
admitted that Younas shopkeeper was not examined
by the Investigating Officer. From the above, it can
safely be concluded that this witness tried to bring his
testimony in line with the deposition of the
complainant, who has already been disbelieved by us
while discussing his statement in previous para. It is
pertinent to mention here that other alleged
eyewitness, namely Habibullah was abandoned by the
prosecution. Presumption would be that, had he been
produced, he would have not supported the

prosecution case.
-13-

9. In addition to the above, the case was
investigated by Zulfiqar Khan S.1, who was examined
in the present case as PW-8. He stated that on
reaching to the spot, he prepared site plan, collected
blood-stained dearth from the place of the deceased
then injured, one bullet led from the place of accused,
three empty shells and one live round of .30 bore
around the place of accused. He seized one bulb
energy saver installed at the corner of the shop of one
Muhammad Younas. He examined PWs u/s 161,
Cr.P.C. He received blood stained garments of the
deceased sent by the Medical Officer, placed PM
documents on judicial file. He examined PWs Syed
Siftain Shah and Syed Rehmat Ali Shah with respect
to motive. He also examined father of the deceased.
He arrested accused on 31.8.2017 and from his
personal search recovered .30 bore pistol alongwith fit
magazine containing five live rounds. He prepared
pointation memo on pointation of the accused. He
placed FSL reports Ex. PK and Ex. PK/1 on the file.
He was cross-examined where he admitted it correct
that he has not shown Masjid in the site plan. He was
questioned about sending of the empties/recoveries to
the FSL, but he could not answer as no application in
that respect was available on the file. He admitted that

he had not recorded statement of any police official
-14-

for keeping the recovered empties in safe custody.
This witness did not investigate the case regarding
mode of transportation of the deceased then injured to
the hospital. He admitted that neither the cot used for
transportation of the deceased then injured to the
hospital was taken into possession by him, nor any
blood was secured from the vehicle used for the said
purpose. He admitted that the Masjid was far away
from the place of occurrence, that’s why he had not —
shown the same in the site plan. He admitted it correct
that complainant had not disclosed to him while
recording his supplementary statement that on his
arrival to the spot, in his presence blood was seized
from the place of his brother, one bullet led and three
empty shells beside one live round of pistol from the
place of accused and one bulb energy saver installed
in street outside the shop of Muhammad Younas. He
admitted that the column meant for identification of
the dead body has been left blank in the postmortem
examination. With regard to condition of the bulb
Ex.P-1, he stated that no expert report is available on
file to ascertain that the same was in workable
condition. At this stage on the request of defence
counsel, the parcel was opened and a broken energy
saver of 24 watt was found in pieces, packed into one ,

packet containing title of ‘Power incandescent Bulb’.
-15-

It is an element of surprise when he stated that
constable Faridullah, who brought the postmortem
documents and garments of the deceased was not
examined under section 161, Cr.P.C. He admitted that
name of said Faridullah was not mentioned in the
calendar of witnesses. He admitted that he had not
recorded the statement of any police official who took
the crime articles including the alleged recoveries to
the FSL. He further admitted that he had not verified
the status of ownership of any shop of Muhammad
Younas. To a question, he stated that the door of said
shop opens towards the main street, however, he had
not shown the door of said shop in the site plan. He
did not remember that who took the empties and pistol
to the FSL. He admitted that the pistol was recovered
on 31.8.2017, whereas it was received in the FSL on
14.9.2017, however, he had not annexed any
document on file regarding safe custody of the above
articles. He further admitted that he did not annex the
daily diary (Roznamcha) dated 10.8.2017 regarding
his departure and arrival to the police station. In view
of the discrepancies highlighted above, such statement
could not be made the basis to sustain conviction on a
capital charge.

10. Regarding recovery of pistol, marginal

witnesses i.e. Mishkat Ullah HC and Muhammad
-16-

Asghar Khan SHO were examined as PW-3 and
PW-9, respectively. PW-3 during cross examination
admitted it correct that except Muhammad Aslam PW,
the Investigating Officer had not associated any other
notable person from the area in connection with Ex.
PW 3/1, but nothing of the sort is forthcoming from
the statement of said PW Muhammad Aslam.
Similarly, the other marginal witness to the recovery
i.e. PW-9 stated that he made entry in daily diary of
the even date but the same is not available on the
judicial file. It is pertinent to mention here that during
course of cross-examination of this witness, the parcel
was de-sealed on the request of learned defence
counsel and No.FA663634/17 with some sharp object
on the body beside the trigger was found on the pistol
allegedly recovered from the accused, but
astonishingly as per recovery memo Ex. PW 3/2, .30
bore pistol without number having fit magazine
containing five rounds of .30 bore was allegedly
recovered from the accused. In this view of the matter,
recovery of pistol from the accused is disbelieved. It is
to be observed that in such state of affairs, such type
of pistols could easily be procured and after making
some fire shots, the same alongwith empties are sent
to the FSL to make the prosecution case a success.

Needless to mention that why the empties allegedly
-17-

recovered from the spot were not sent to the FSL,
rather same were sent to the FSL after arrest of the
accused.

11. So far as the FSL report regarding the
crime pistol allegedly recovered from the accused and
empties collected from the spot is concerned, suffice it
to say that the empties were collected on 10.8.2017,
but the same were not sent to the FSL after those were
recovered. Even there is nothing on the record which
could suggest that the same remained in safe custody
till those were received in the FSL on 14.9.2017
alongwith .30 bore pistol allegedly recovered on
31.8.2017, on the date at which the accused was
arrested. As discussed earlier, the Investigating
Officer stated that he could not find any application
regarding sending of above articles to the FSL nor he
remembered the name of official who took the same to
the FSL. In this view of the matter, the positive FSL
report could not be taken into consideration for
sustaining conviction. Besides, when the ocular
account of the prosecution case has been disbelieved,
mere recovery of the pistol and crime empties, would
not be sufficient for recording conviction in light of
ratio of the judgment of apex Court in case titled,
"Mst. Sughra Begum and another v. Qaisar Pervez
and others" (2015 SCMR 1142), wherein it has been
-18-

held that once the ocular account was disbelieved then
no other evidence, even of a high degree and value,
would be sufficient for recording conviction on a
capital charge.

12. Recovery of blood from the spot, the last
worn blood-stained garments of the deceased and
unnatural death of the deceased with firearm as per
postmortem report, prove the factum of murder of the
deceased, but never tell the name(s) of the
culprit/killer. Such pieces of evidence are always
considered as corroborative pieces of evidence and are
taken along with direct evidence and not in isolation
as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in ‘Riaz

Ahmed's case (2010 SCMR 846), Ijaz Ahmed's case

1997 SCMR 1279 and Asadullah's case (PLD 1971

SC 541). It has been held by the apex Court in case
titled, "Saifullah v. The State" (1985 SCMR 410
that when there is no eye-witness to be relied upon,
then there is nothing, which can be corroborated by
the recovery.

13. So far as motive is concerned, it is always
considered a double-edged weapon which cuts both
sides. True that motive could be a reason for
involvement of an accused and equally true that the
same could be a reason for false implication of an

accused. In the present case, although motive was
-19-

stated to be a dispute over landed property, but the
evidence in this respect is deficient, therefore, same
could not be taken into consideration.

14. The !carned trial Court has not appreciated
the evidence in its true perspective and thereby fell in
crror by convicting the appellant. We have minutely
perused the judgment under challenge through all
angles, which cannot face the test of judicious scrutiny
and the same invites indulgence of this Court.

15. For what has been discussed above, we
are of the firm opinion that the prosecution has
miserably failed to establish the case against the
appellant, otherwise to extend benefit of doubt so
many circumstances are not required. The instant
criminal appeal is, therefore, allowed, the impugned
judgment is sct aside, resultantly, the appellant is
acquitted of the charges levelled against him. He shall
be released forthwith, if not required to be detained in
connection with any other criminal case. Since we
have set aside the conviction and sentence awarded to
the appellant, therefore, the connected criminal
revision for enhancement of sentence has become

infructuous which stands dismissed accordingly.
-20-

16. Above are the detailed reasons of our short
order announced on 17.5.2022, which is reproduced
herein below:-

“For reasons to be recorded later in the
detailed judgment, we allow this appeal,
set aside the impugned conviction and
sentence awarded to the appellant Arshad
Ali son of Muhammad Jan, vide judgment
dated 14.01.2021, rendered by learned
Judge, Model Criminal Trial Court,
D.L.Khan. Resultantly, appellant — is
acquitted of the charges levelled against
him in the said case. He be released
forthwith, if not required to be detained in
any other criminal case. Since the
impugned conviction has been set aside,
therefore, the connected Cr.R.No.01-
D/2021, for enhancement of sentence
stands dismissed for having become
infructuous.”
