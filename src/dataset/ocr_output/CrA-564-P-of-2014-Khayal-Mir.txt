KRRRK

LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- Through this
judgment, we shall also decide Cr.R.No.
126-P of 2014 as both the matters are
the outcome of same judgment
dated 25.09.2014 of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-lll, Mardan, delivered in
case FIR No.125 dated 15.02.2011
registered u/s 302 PPC at Police Station
Shahbaz Garhi, Mardan, whereby the
appellant has been convicted for the
qgatl-i-amd of Karim Khan and sentenced to
imprisonment for life with payment of
Rs.5,00,000/- as compensation payable to
the legal heirs of the deceased or in
default whereof to further suffer simple
imprisonment of six months. Benefit

u/s 382-b Cr.P.C. was given to him.
2. Brief facts of the case are that on
15.02.2011, deceased Karim Khan, the then
injured, reported to ASI Zahir Shah (PW-9)
in the casualty of Civil Hospital, Mardan to
the effect that he was busy in cutting grass
in the fields of Khaista Mir when in the
meanwhile, appellant fired at him with pistol
with which he was hit and got injured. Motive
for the crime was stated to be previous
ill-will. The injured was taken to the hospital
where he lodged the report whereafter he
was referred to LRH, Peshawar for further
treatment but he could not survive and
succumbed to his injuries on 20.02.2011 in

the hospital.

3. After arrest of the accused and
completion of investigation, the appellant
was indicted for the offence by the learned
trial court to which he pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. Prosecution in order to prove
its case produced 16 witnesses in all
whereafter statement of the accused was
recorded, wherein, he _ professed his
innocence. The learned trial court, after
conclusion of the trial, found the appellant

guilty of the charge and while recording his
conviction sentenced him as mentioned

above, hence the instant appeal.

4. Arguments heard and record gone
through.
5. Perusal of the record would show that

there is no eyewitness to the occurrence
and the one, who was the complainant, died
subsequent to lodging the _ report.
Prosecution has relied upon the First
Information Report (Ex.PA/1) by treating it
as a dying declaration of the deceased but it
is well settled that dying declaration has
always been considered and treated as a
weak type of evidence because it is not
tested by cross examination. It has been
held umpteenth times by the superior courts
that a dying declaration can be made a base
for conviction provided that same _ is
corroborated by strong independent
circumstantial evidence, otherwise, no
credence could be attached to it. In the case
in hand surrounding circumstances hardly
support the FIR-cum-dying declaration of the
deceased and in this respect worth perusal
is the site plan of the case (Ex.PB),
which has been prepared by the

Investigating Officer (PW-15) on his own.
When neither the deceased accompanied
the Investigating Officer to the spot nor
anyone else pointed out the crime spot to
him, then the question would arise that how
the Investigating Officer reached the spot
and prepared the site plan citing therein
various points qua presence of the
deceased and the crime empties. Besides,
from the crime spot, neither any cut grass
was recovered nor any sickle was found.
Likewise, the Investigating Officer has not
cited any place wherefrom the grass was cut
by the deceased or was in the process of
cutting, hence the site plan does not support
the dying declaration so made by the

deceased.

6. Another important aspect of the case
is that the deceased had died after 5 days of
the occurrence. The sole injury sustained by
him was on posterior lateral side of his left
thigh, which is a non-vital part of human
body. At the time of making the report, he
was conscious and oriented. Question would
arise that when the declarant was conscious
and oriented at the time of lodging the report,
then what was the need to give a Certificate

by the doctor on the murasila regarding his
consciousness. Ibid aspect of the case
shows some overactiveness on the part of
the Investigating Officer and it appears that
when the deceased passed away after five
days, then the Investigating Officer obtained
the Certificate regarding consciousness of
the deceased on murasila. Besides, the
dying declaration gets no corroboration from
independent circumstantial aspects of the
case, therefore, for safe administration of
justice, it cannot form a base for conviction

of the appellant.

7. No doubt, the prosecution has sought
corroboration from the positive report of FSL,
whereby the crime weapon recovered from
the appellant was used in the commission of
offence but as the pistol was recovered on
24.09.2011 and was received at the
laboratory on 08.10.2011, i.e. after a delay
of 14 days of its recovery, therefore, no legal
worth could be given to the recoveries and

the positive report of FSL (Ex.P-Z).

8. Furthermore, there is no postmortem
report of the deceased in absence of which
it cannot be ascertained with certainty that
what was the cause of his death. True that

there is Death Certificate (Ex.PW 14/1) of
the deceased but in the ibid Certificate the
cause of death of the deceased has been
given as “F.A.| Causing multi-organ failure”,
which is a very vague term, hence the cause
given by the doctor qua the death of the
deceased is not reliable and when the cause
of death is not clearly known, then the
statement of an injured can hardly be
considered as a dying declaration. Moreso,
the prosecution has not produced the
treatment chart of the deceased on the basis
of which the Death Certificate was issued,
hence on this score too the ibid Certificate

has no legal worth.

9. Thorough and careful examination of
the case record would show that neither
medical evidence nor site plan of the case
supports the prosecution's case qua
involvement of the appellant in the crime.
The prosecution has failed to bring home
guilt to the appellant-accused through any
reliable and confidence inspiring evidence. It
is well settled that in order to record
conviction of an accused, the prosecution
has to prove its case beyond all reasonable
doubts, which is’ hallmark of criminal

jurisprudence. Furthermore, it is also a
century old principle of criminal law that a
slightest doubt arising in the prosecution
case is sufficient for acquittal of the accused,
which principle fully applies to the instant
case in respect of the appellant. The learned
trial court has not appreciated the case
evidence in its true perspective and has
fallen in error to record conviction of the
appellant for which its judgment is not

sustainable.

10. For what has been discussed above,
this appeal is allowed, the impugned
judgment is set aside and the appellant is
acquitted of the charge leveled against him.
He be set free forthwith, if not required to be

detained in any other case.

11. As we have accepted the appeal
against conviction, therefore, the connected
Cr.R.No.126-P of 2014 has become

infructuous, which is accordingly dismissed.

12. Above are the reasons of our short

order of even date, which reads as under:-

“For the reasons to be recorded later, this appeal
is allowed, conviction and sentence passed by
learned Additional Sessions Judge-lll, Mardan
vide impugned judgment dated 25.9.2014
delivered in case FIR No.125 dated 15.2.2011
u/s 302 PPC of Police Station Shahbaz Garhi,

Mardan, are set aside. The appellant is acquitted
fo the charge leveled against him and he be set
free forthwith, if not required to be detained in any

other case”.
