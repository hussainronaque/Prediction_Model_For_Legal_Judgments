Suleman and 7 others Vs. Jawad Khan and 2 others

Present: Mr. Aurangzeb, Advocate for petitioners.
Nemo for respondents being Motion case.

Date of hearing: 16.01.2024.
JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- Through instant petition
under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of
‘Pakistan, 1973, the petitioners have challenged the order of the
learned Additional Sessions Judge/Judge Child Protection Court,
District Swat dated 18.12.2023 whereby objection of the petitioners
was turned down and bailiff of the Court was directed to hand over
possession of the property in question to legal heirs of complainant -

in presence of patwari halqa.

2. Brief facts of the case are that complainant Ghafoor Khan,
father of respondent No.1, filed a complaint under Section 3 of the
Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 (The Act) against the petitioner
along with application under Section 7 for restoration of possession
of land fully mentioned in Para-1 of the complaint. As per averments
of the petitioners, the learned trial Court directed SHO of the
concerned police station three times for inquiry ’and reports which

were accordingly submitted. The petitioners filed an application for

SabzAH/* — (S.B} HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE M MMAD NAEEM ANWY,

dismissal of the complainant and another application for inquiry
against the respondent No.1. The learned trial Court heard
application of complainant u/s 7 of the Act along with the referred to
above applications of the petitioners, resultantly, the application for
restoration of possession u/s 7 of the Act was accepted vide order
dated 19.03.2021 whereas the application of petitioners for dismissal
of complaint was dismissed leaving their application for inquiry
against respondent No.1 unattended. The said order was maintained
by this Court vide judgement dated 23.10.2023 in W.P No. 170-
M/2021 filed by petitioners. Complainant Ghafoor Khan died during
pendency of the writ petition, therefore, on receipt of case file by
learned trial Court, learned counsel for the petitioners raised the
objection that complainant Ghafoor Khan has died while respondent
No.1 namely Jawad Khan is not the sole legal heir of Ghafoor Khan.
The learned trial Court vide order dated 18.12.2023 turned down the
objection and directed the bailiff to hand over possession of the land

in question to respondent No.1, hence, instant petition.

Iw

Arguments heard and record perused.

4. Mian contention of learned counsel for the petitioners is that
complainant Ghafoor Khan has died whereas his son Jawad Khan
(respondent No.1) is pursuing the matter under the Act as attorney
for legal heirs of the complainant. He further contended that there is
no concept of power of attorney in criminal law, as such, the learned
trial Court has illegally proceeded with the matter. The main

question for resolution before this Court is if the complainant dies

SabzAli/* —(S.B) HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR

during pendency of a private criminal complaint whether the
complaint be continued by his successors or the case would come to
an end? The record shows that complainant Ghafoor Khan had filed
the complaint under Section 3 of the Act with a view that the
petitioners have illegally dispossessed him from the landed property
mentioned in the complaint. After his death, his son Jawad Khan
pursued the complaint on behalf of other legal heirs of the deceased
complainant which was objected to by petitioners on the sole ground
that there is no concept of power of attorney in criminal proceedings.
Admittedly, the complainant had filed the complaint in respect of
land he was claiming to be his ownership and same is the position of
his legal heirs before the learned trial Court. None of the remaining
legal heirs of the complainant has raised any objection against
respondent No.1 rather he is their duly authorized attorney, therefore,
the objection raised by petitioners before the learned trial Court was

rightly turned down.

5. A similar issue came before the Supreme Court of India in the

case titled “Ashwin Nanubhai Vyas Vs. State of Maharashtra and
Anr” (AIR 1967 Supreme Court 983) wherein it was held that:

‘The later view is distinctly in favour of absence of the
complainant allowing the prosecution to continue except
in those cases where the Code is sled says that on the
absence of the complainant the accused must be either
acquitted or discharged. The present is not one of those
case and in our judgment the Presidency Magistrate
was right in proceeding with the inquiry by allowing the

mother to carry on the prosecution, and under S. 495

Sabz All/* — (S.B) N’BLE MR, JUSTH JHAMMAD NAEE! ‘AR

the mother may continue the prosecution herself or
through a pleader. We see no reason why we should be
astute to find a lacuna in the procedural law by which
the trial of such important cases would be stultified by
the death of a complainant when all that the S. 198

requires is the removal of the bar.

Another judgment in this regard is that of Punjab-Haryana
High Court in the case titled “Kalbir Kaur Vs. Dalip Singh”
reported as 1987 Cr.LJ 1555 wherein complainant filed a complaint
u/s 494/114/109/34 IPC, however, she died during pendency of the
complaint upon which one of the accused filed an application for
dismissal of the complaint because of her absence. The trial Court
dismissed the application by allowing father of the complainant to
continue the proceedings in the said complaint. The High Court,
while entertaining a petition against the said order, made discussion
on Section 249, Cr.P.C. (India) and dismissed the petition by

observing that:

“] have heard the counsel for the parties at length and
am of the view that in such a situation, as in the present
case, the trial Court has the discretion to continue the
proceedings and for that purpose it can allow any other
person to prosecute and, in its discretion, it has allowed
Dalip Singh, father of the complainant deceased, to

continue the complaint against the petitioner and Ors.

We have also a similar provision i.e., S. 247, Cr.P.C. dealing with
deliberate absence of the complainant as suggested by plain reading
of the said provision and in that eventuality the Court has the

discretion to acquit the accused. However, in the present case, the

issue before this Court is death of the complainant after filing of

Sabzali/* (SB) Nt Ay if i Ay D NAEEM ANW,

complaint u/s 3 of the Act, therefore, in absence of any clear-cut
provision in this regard, it would be against the norms of justice to
deprive legal heirs of the complainant to proceed with the complaint
filed by their predecessor. Further reliance is placed on the judgment

of High Court of Orisa in_Crl. Rev No. 579 of 2011 titled “Afr

Sanjit Kumar Mishra & Others vs Ranjit Mishra” decided on 6"

September, 2022. While referring to various judgments, it was
observed in the said judgment that the law is now fairly well settled
that the legal heirs of the deceased complainant can be substituted in

his place,

6. It was not disputed by the petitioners that in the complaint
they were not put on notice rather they have been put on notice and
the cognizance was taken by the learned Judge and an order under
section 7 of the Act was passed by the learned trail Court and
thereafter the complainant died. It may be added that the alleged
offence was not person specific which could be held to have been
abated by the death of the complainant as held by the apex Court in
the case of Mir Shakeelur Rehman and others vs. Yahya Bakhtiar
and others (PLD 2010 SC 612) where a complaint was filed under
Ss.500, 501 and 502, P.P.C. against accused for publishing report
against the complainant but he died during pendency of the
complaint and her daughter filed an application to pursue the

complaint, Hon’ble Supreme has held:

The case in hand does not fall in the category of cases
where the complaint would survive the complainant. A

bare reading of the libel published which subject matter
‘Sabz AU/* — (5.8) /BLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR

of this case would show that it was directed against the
person of the complainant alone. It could be totally
wrong and scandalous. But the fact remains that it was
person specific and transaction specific. In the
complaint filed and the statement made by the
complainant before the trial Court, there is no
allegation that the libel had in any manner injured the

reputation of his family or relatives.

7. Moreover, in the case titled Munib vs. Ali Mardan_ and 6

others (2020 YLR_ 457) the complaint filed under Illegal
Dispossession Act 2005 was at initial stage where on the receipt of
report from the local police, the complaint was dismissed and
criminal petition was filed before Hon’ble Sind High Court however,
during pendency of criminal miscellaneous the complainant expired
and it was held by the Court that since the complaint was at initial
stage therefore, the legal heirs of the deceased may file a fresh
complaint under Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 if advised so.
However, the circumstance of the matter in hand are distinguishable
as an order under section 7 of the Act has been passed by the trial
Court and that was upheld by this Court thus, there is no illegality to

allow the son of the complainant to pursue the complaint.

8. In light of the above discussion, it can safely be concluded
that in the event of the death of the complainant, if it is not person
specific, when the accused has been put on notice after taking the
cognizance, the legal heir of the complainant may continue to
proceed with the complaint. In such an eventuality, the learned trial

Court has rightly held that death of complainant is not fatal to the

:

@:

maintainability of complaint and presence of all the legal heirs is not

a legal requirement for continuation of complaint under Section 3 of

the Act. The impugned order, being in accordance with law, cannot

be interfered with by this Court. Resultantly, instant petition is

dismissed in limine.
