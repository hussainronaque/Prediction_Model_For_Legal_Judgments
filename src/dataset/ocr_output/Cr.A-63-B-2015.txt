Kalashnikovs and started firing upon Haji Mir Abbas
Khan with the intention to kill him and as a result he was
hit, both the accused also fired upon the complainant and
his brother Gul Wali Khan with the intention to cause
death, but they luckily escaped unhurt. They being empty
handed could not do anything, and the respondents/
accused after commission of offence decamped from the

PW 10/10-A. The Investigating Officer recorded
-9-

statements of witnesses under section 161 Cr.PC. and on
completion of investigation handed over the case file to

the S.H.O for submission of complete challan.

14. The prosecution also examined one Jalil
Khan inspector as PW-11, who incorporated the contents

of Murasila into F.].R Ex: PA.

15. Thereafter statements of accused under
section 342 Cr.P.C were recorded, wherein they
professed innocence, however, they did not wish to
produce defence evidence or to be examined on oath as
provided under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. Learned trial Court
after hearing arguments from both the sides, vide
impugned judgment dated 25.03.2015, acquitted the
accused/ respondents. The complainant moved instant

criminal appeal against acquittal of accused/respondents.

16. The learned counsel for the parties alongwith Asstt:
Advocate General were heard at length and with their

valuable assistance the record was gone through.

17. It is well settled and entrenched principle of
criminal jurisprudence that the prosecution has to prove
guilt of accused through cogent, convincing and reliable
evidence and beyond any shadow of doubt, however, if the

prosecution evidence is found shaky and material
-10-

inconsistent and at the same time suffers from the
contradictions, then benefit of doubt is to be extended to the

accused.

18. Analyzing the prosecution evidence upon this
touch stone, it is clear that the complainant has alleged in
his report Ex: PW 3/1, that the occurrence had taken place at
17:30 hours, that he along with the deceased and other
brothers, namely, Gul Wali Khan were returning from the
house of Sardar Ali Khan, there other brother, when they
were attacked by the respondents/accused. The F.I.R reveals
that the report was lodged at emergency room of City
Hospital, Lakki Marwat at 20:45 hours. The complainant as
per report, when approached to his brother he, at that time
was already expired. It is also in his report that the distance
in between the spot of occurrence and Police Station Lakki
Marwat was 12/13 KM, however, it took the complainant
and his brother 3-hours and 15-minutes to take the dead-
body to the City Hospital Lakki Marwat, however, the delay
in lodging the F.I.R has not been explained in the report, as
well as the statement recorded before the court. It has been
noticed that in many cases the complainant party shift the
expired relatives to the hospital, whereas the police station
or police post is always at a short distance and in case of

report at Police Station/ Police Post, they may have saved a
-1l-

lot of precious time to timely report the mater/ occurrence,
which may avert the argument of consuming time for
consultation and deliberation, but it has been commonly
observed that despite the fact that the deceased had already
succumbed to injuries, the dead-body is shifted to the
hospital, with no explanation for doing so, as there exists no
chance to save the life of the deceased. In such a situation
the lodging of Murasila is always to be viewed with
suspicion because it is scribed on a plain white paper,
whereas the F.I.R is lodged in the Police Station on duly
prescribed form and manipulation therein is always difficult.
Anyhow, in the present case there is clear delay of more
than three hours in lodging the report, for which no

satisfactory and plausible explanation is forthcoming.

19. The complainant Taj Ali Khan and his brother
Gul Wali Khan have posed themselves to be the eye-
witnesses of the case. As asserted in the report Ex: PA/1,
they were proceeding along with the deceased at a short
distance and allegedly had some dispute of land with the
respondents /accused and in that situation if respondents/
accused had fired upon the deceased Haji Mir Abbas then
being inimical to the complainant and his brother Gul Wali
Khan, the respondents/accused would also not have spared

them, however, in the incident they have not received even
-12-

a scratch at the hands of respondent/ accused. This further
gives the impression that the complainant and his brother
Gul Wali were not present at the relevant time of

occurrence.

20. The prosecution case mainly hinges on the
testimony of PW 07, Taj Ali Khan (complainant) and PW-
08, Gul Wali Khan. The complainant in his report has
alleged that at the relevant time of occurrence he along with
Gul Wali Khan were accompanying the deceased Haji Mir
Abbas Khan and when they reached near the house of
Mehboob Shah, the respondent/ accused assaulted them
with Kalashnikovs and as a result deceased Haji Mir Abbas
Khan was hit and died at the spot. During his statement
complainant Taj Ali Khan was unable to state any plausible
reason for accompanying the deceased. It is in his cross-
examination that after the occurrence PW Gul Wali had
gone to arrange Datson to shift dead-body of the deceased to
the hospital and that he returned with the Datson at
18:45/19:00 hours. Despite arrangement of vehicle at the
stated time, the complainant party further took one hour and
45-inutes to shift dead-body to the hospital despite the fact
that Police Station was at a distance of 12/13 KMs from the
spot and they could have reach there within 10/15 minutes.

It is further replied by the PW Taj Ali Khan that cot was
-B-

also brought by same Gul Wali Khan. He further replied that
when Datson reached with PW Gul Wali, he himself and
nephews were present at the spot. Surprisingly, PW Gul
Wali was active in arranging the cot as well as Datson,
whereas it is in his cross-examination that several nephews
of the complainant were present at the spot. It does not
appeal to prudent mind that several able bodied nephews
were present, but their uncle Gul Wali was running from
pillor to post for making arrangements of datson and cot.
The site-plan reveals that the occurrence had taken place in
a street close to the house of Gul Badshah another brother of
complainant, but despite firing in the street neither Gul
Badshah was attracted to the spot nor he made any
arrangement to bring cot from the nearby house. The cross-
examination of PW Taj Ali Khan further reveals that at the
time of lodging report Gul Wali Khan was not present with
him, which also does not appeal to the mind because
throughout the incident he was making arrangements for
shifting dead-body to the hospital but at the crucial moment
of lodging report he is shown to be absent. The complainant
further answered in cross-examination that police arrived to
the spot at 08:40 p.m, whereas he lodged the report and after

narrating contents to him he signed the report at 09:20 p.m.
-14-

21. To the contrarily, perusal of the Murasila
reveals that the matter was already reported to the police at
08:45 p.m whereafter the Murasila was sent to the Police
Station and F.1.R was chalked out at 21:45 hours and had he
signed the report 09:20 p.m. then it would not have been
possible to register the case at 09:45 pm. In cross-
examination he also replied that both the accused made
firing in shot burst manner and after few seconds they also
made shot burst upon them. He further replied that at the
time of firing at his deceased brother they were standing and

never tried to run away or take shelter.

22. PW Gul Wali in his cross-examination replied
that the dead-body was shifted from the place of occurrence
to the hospital at 07:00 p.m, whereas occurrence had taken
place at 17:30 hours. He further replied that he brought cot
from his house and then on arrival of Datson put the dead-
body in the Datson and till arrival of the Datson the dead-
body was placed on the cot. He further replied that prior to
arrival of Datson, complainant and his nephews were
present with the dead-body, and that, police arrived to the
spot at 10:45 p.m. and he remained with the police till their
departure. He further replied that his statement was recorded
by the police at 11:40 p.m, after conducting house search of

the accused. In response to another question he replied that
-15-

he do not know interse distance between graveyard and the
spot and that he cannot say in how much time he reached to
the place of hiring of Datson and that he cannot remember
as to where he offered Asar Prayer, but replied that it was
after dispatching dead-body to the hospital. He also
answered that soon after the occurrence he went to the house
for bringing the cot and he cannot say that how much time
was spent on bringing the cot. He also answered that they
did not attempted to escape from the firing in the nearby
street towards his house and that houses of Gul Badshah,
Mehboob Shah and Hashim Khan were also situated around
the spot and that these people did not came out from their
houses after the occurrence. He also answered that fire was

not repeated after first round of ineffective firing upon them.

23. Thorough consideration of evidence of PW Taj
Ali Khan and Gul Wali Khan reveals that they have not
disclosed the reason and purpose as to why they were
accompanying the deceased at the relevant time. More so,
had they been present with the deceased the respondent
being inimical towards all the three brothers would have not
spared them to leave an eye-witness for deposing against
them during trial. At the same time, if they would have been
present they may not have consumed more than three hours

to shift the dead-body of the deceased to the hospital and
-16-

reporting the matter to the police. Their evidence also shows
that allegedly they were also fired, but to this effect both
these witnesses have contradicted each other, because PW
Gul Wali Khan has stated that after first fire shot the
accused did not repeated the firing, whereas PW Taj Ali
Khan in cross-examination replied that after first burst the
accused also made 2"™ burst upon them. The incident has
allegedly taken place right in front of the house of another
brother of complainant Taj Ali Khan, whereas there are also
other houses on both the sides of the street, but surprisingly
no one from said houses came out after the firing, which is
an unnatural conduct because people do come out of their
houses to enquire after firing takes place in front of their
houses. Both the above PWs are closely related to the
deceased and were interested witnesses and, therefore, their
evidence required independent corroboration, but none from
the vicinity came forward to support the prosecution case. It
is also evident that PW Gul Wali Khan, despite being
resident of the same area had no knowledge of inter-se
distance between graveyard and the spot of occurrence,
while as per site-plan (Ex: PW 10/12/Ex: PB) the graveyard
is shown right at the end of street/residential houses. It is
also evident that the complainant himself did nothing to
shift dead-body of the deceased to the hospital or Police

Station and PW Gul Wali was arranging the vehicle for
-17-

shifting the deceased to the hospital or Police Station as well
as arranging the cot from his own house, whereas the house
of his another brother, namely, Gul Badshah shown right in
front of the spot of occurrence in the site-plan. From the
evidence of these witnesses as well as record there is no
doubt in our mind that it was an unseen occurrence and after
getting knowledge of the incident both the PWs arrived to
the spot, where after they consumed more than three hours
in shifting the dead-body of the deceased to the hospital,
hence, without independent corroboration the evidence of
these interested witnesses could not be relied upon. In the

case of “Khalid Mehmood and another Vs the State” 2021

SCMR_ 810 [Supreme Court of Pakistan], while

disbelieving the presence of eye-witness on the spot have

held that:

“All the circumstances highlighted
above lead us to a_ definite
conclusion that the presence of eye-
witnesses at the place of occurrence
at the relevant time is not above
board and prosecution has failed to
prove its case against the petitioner
beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore,
the instant jail petition is converted
into an appeal and the same is
hereby allowed. The conviction and

sentence of appellant Khalid
- 18-

Mehmood is set aside. He is
acquitted of the charge framed
against him. He is behind the bars
and is ordered to be released
forthwith, if not required to be

detained in any other case.”

24. In this case the investigation was carried out by
the PW-10, Abdur Rahim SI and he collected blood from
the spot of occurrence and also prepared site-plan at the
instance of complainant Taj Ali Khan and PW Gul Wali.
His statement reveals that he remained on the spot of
occurrence from 22:45 till 24:00 midnight, however, no
source of light is shown on the spot in which he conducted
investigation at the spot. PW Gul Wali in his cross-
examination stated that co-villagers informed them about
arrival of police at the spot, whereafter they proceeded to
the spot, while PW-10 Abdur Rahim in his cross-
examination replied that on his way to the spot of
occurrence he called upon the complainant through a child
present nearby, who was aged about 12/13 years. Besides
the contradictions between Investigating Officer and the
complainant party, it is also worth noticing that how a child
of 12/13 years of age was present when the Investigating
Officer arrived to the place of occurrence at 22:00 hours.
During cross-examination he has also admitted that, he has

not recorded statement of constable who took case property
-19-

to the F.S.L, nor he placed copy of Register No.19 on file to
ascertain that the case property was handed over to the
Moharrir for onward dispatch to F.S.L. He replied in cross-
examination that the injury sheet and inquest report was
produced to him at the place of occurrence at 11:00 p.m, or
11:15 p.m, in the presence of complainant, eye-witness and
police officials. In cross-examination he furnished his

following answers.

“Particularly, in supplementary
Statement, the complainant never stated
that eye-witness was present with him on
the spot at the time of occurrence, but he
stated that whatsoever the contents of the
F-LR which he narrated to the police that

is correct and is his statement.”

He next replied in cross-examination that the complainant
and the eye-witness had not stated duration of firing for
which it continued nor the direction in which the accused
escaped, self stated that, they have stated that accused went
to a side. From the above statement of Investigating Officer,
it not only contradict the statement of eye-witness, but at the
same time, it is not believable in normal course that
investigation is conducted at such belated time without
showing any source of light. His reply during cross-
examination that he informed the complainant party through

a child of 12/13 years of age at odd hours also does not
-20-

appeal to the prudent mind. He has left material lacunas
during investigation and for not placing extract of register
No.19, the authenticity of recovered articles have been

jeopardized

25. The medical evidence is always a corroborative
piece of evidence and lent support to the prosecution case in
respect of time of occurrence, seat of injuries, nature and
diameter of the injuries, but it in no way point out to the
accused in any manner. In this case, the postmortem report
reveals the unnatural death of the deceased Haji Mir Abbas
Khan through fire arm. The medical officer noted and
reported nine entry and equal number of exit wounds at the
time of report and during the evidence prosecution case is
that both the respondents/ accused were present duly armed
with Kalashnikovs and on their arrival they started firing at
the deceased and as a result thereof he was hit and fell on
the ground. This shows that both the respondents/ accused
were attributed the role of firing through Kalashnikovs,
however, despite been shown at the same distance from the
deceased, the injuries sustained by the deceased through the
same weapon of offence were shown to have been inflicted
different size/ diameter ranging from 3 inches to 4 inches in
injuries No.1 to 5, while injuries No.6 and 7 are totally of

different size with 2x3 inch and Ixlinch. Similarly injury
-21-

No.8 is 1/4x1/4 inch in diameter and similar is the position
of exit wounds with different size and diameter, thus when
the deceased was fired from points No.3 and 4 with the
same weapon then size and diameter of the injuries must
have been the same, however, due to different in size and
diameter there is every possibility that the different weapons
were used for firing upon the deceased resulting into

different size of injuries.

26. Motive of the commission of offence also play
a very vital role in criminal cases and prosecution is
expected that once motive is alleged for the commission of
an offence, then the same must be proved convincingly,
however, in the instant case except mere assertions, dispute
over landed property with the respondents, the prosecution
has not brought anything on record to prove that such
motive did existed at the relevant time which prompted the
respondents/ accused to take the life of the deceased. In
absence of any such proof the motive aspect of the case has

not been proved beyond doubt.

27. For all the above reasons, we are of the view
that the prosecution has been unable to prove their case
through cogent and reliable evidence. There are serious
doubts about the presence of the PWs Taj Ali Khan and Gul

Wali Khan at the time of occurrence; report was lodged after
-22-

delay of considerable time for which no explanation has
been forwarded and it has to be presumed that such has been
consumed for consultation and deliberation to falsely
implicate the respondents in the case; the medical evidence
also does not support the prosecution story in respect of
kind of weapon used in the offence, whereas motive alleged
in the F.I.R has also not been proved convincingly and
therefore, learned trial court after correctly appreciating the
record has rightly acquitted the respondents/accused in the
case, hence, the impugned judgment is maintained and the

appeal in hand being devoid of merits is hereby dismissed.

Announced.
