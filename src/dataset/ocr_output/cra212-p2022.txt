JUDGMENT SHEET

PESHAWAR HIGH COURT, PESHAWAR
(JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT)

Cr.A. No. 212-P/2022

Hashmat vs. The State

JUDGMENT

Date of hearing: 15.08.2022

Appellant (s) by: Mr. Kifayatullah Shahabkhel,
Advocate.
State by: Mr. Inamullah Yousafzai, AAG.

Dr. Khurshid Iqbal, J.-

1. The appellant (Hashmat) has appealed from the judgment dated
28.02.2022 of the learned Additional Sessions Judge-XV, Peshawar, by which he
has been convicted under section 9-D of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of
Narcotic Substances, Act, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Act, No. XXXI OF 2019) and
sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for a period of six years and a fine of Rs.
1,00,000/- (one lac) in default whereof, he was further directed to undergo
simple imprisonment for six months, with benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C.
extended to him.

2. Facts of the case, as stated in the murasila, are that on 21.01.2021, a police
party led by Imtiaz Alam, SHO (PW.1) was on search and strike operation at
Achini Bala Nehir near Sangu Qabristan in the locality, when it came across the
appellant who was allegedly coming from Bara, District Khyber. On entertaining
a suspicion about him, he was searched which resulted in the recovery of 8
packets of chars, each weighing 1160 grams (total 9280 grams). The seizing
officer prepared a recovery memo of the contraband chars, drafted an application
to the FSL. He also drafted the murasila, which he forwarded to the police
station where the case was registered at the strength of FIR No. 91 dated
21.01.2021 under section 9-C CNSA of Police Station Sarband, Peshawar.

3. Investigation was entrusted to Khaista Khan, SI (PW.2). He prepared site
plan, received case property, produced the accused before the Judicial Magistrate

for police remand and finally sent him to the judicial lock up. He also recorded

statements of the PWs under section 161, Cr.P.C. and obtained the FSL report.
On completion of investigation, challan was submitted before the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-XV, Peshawar. Copies of the relevant documents
were supplied to the accused in compliance of section 265-C Cr.P.C. Charge was
framed against the accused on 03.06.2021, to which he pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial.

4. The prosecution examined as many as 5 PWs. The gist of its evidence is

5. At the close of the prosecution evidence, the appellant was examined
under section 342, Cr.P.C. in which he was afforded an opportunity to record
evidence in defence or statement on oath, which he did not avail.

6. After hearing arguments of both the parties, the learned trial Judge
convicted and sentenced the appellant, as per details given in para-1 of the

judgment.

7. I have heard arguments of Mr. Kifayatullah Shahabkhel, learned counsel
for the appellant and learned AAG for the State and perused the record.

8. The prosecution introduced two versions of the place of the occurrence.
As per the FIR story, the complainant (PW.1) arrested the appellant at Achini
Bala Nehr near Sangu Qabristan. The IO (PW.2) and one of the marginal witnesses
(ASI Jaffar Shah PW.3) introduced another version. The latter—who

Page 2 of 8
¥

accompanied the seizing officer at the time of arrest of the appellant—stated that
the accused was arrested at “Sarband Nehir canal”. He deposed: “The accused
reached to the Sarband Nehir at about 08:00 PM and we arrested the accused there.”

9. The former (PW.2) deposed that he reached to the spot i.e. Sarband Nehir
within 30 minutes. He even offered an explanation, saying that the place of the
occurrence is located at a distance of 1 kilometer from Sarband Nehir. He denied
a suggestion that his explanation was an afterthought. PW.3 even went further,
stating that the police party first visited Sarband Nehir on the place of occurrence.
The site plan simply shows the presence of the appellant near the graveyard of
Sangu and a path. It does not show the Bara road on which allegedly the
appellant was coming towards Sangu and/or Achini village. Nor does it depict
the Nehr (canal). Arguably, if at all, the Sengu graveyard and Sarband Nehir are
the same place, then it should have been depicted in the site plan. Then, even the
Bara road was not shown in the site plan. It is thus, not proved as to which

version whether the graveyard of village Sangu or the Sarband Nehir is correct.

10. Three other aspects are worth consideration. First, the complainant stated
that the police party had two mobile vans at the time of the occurrence. But in
the site plan, none of the vehicles was shown. Second, the occurrence took place
at 2000 hours (08:00 PM) in the month of January and the murasila was
prepared at 2050 hours, whereas, the FIR was chalked at 21.10 hours. The site
plan was prepared the same day, i.e. 21.01.2021, but it does not show the source
of light used at that time, in which it was prepared. Third, in the site plan, the
house of one Hussan Dar was shown near the place of the occurrence. The
complainant deposed that the place of the occurrence is surrounded by houses. It
was not explained how the complainant came to know that the house was that of
Hussan Dar as no one from the locality was stated to be present. Then, other

houses, as stated by the complainant, were not shown in the site plan.

11. As regards the shape and nature of the contraband chars, in the murasila,
it was shown to be comprising of 8 packets, each weighing 1160 grams. The
complainant (the seizing officer) while under cross examination expressed. his
lack of knowledge as to whether it was pukhta or garda chars. Of greater
significance is his deposition that the contraband chars in question was one slab.
Arguably, a reference may be made to the recovery memo and the FSL report,
which show that 8 packets were received there. Be that as it may, the very star
witness of the prosecution i.e. the complainant himself wiped out his contention
by saying that the contraband chars was one slab. The complainant offered no
explanation regarding one slab. Either he wanted to give a concession to the
appellant or it was a mistake by a slip of tongue. The prosecutor also did not pay

Page 3 of 8
any heed to this important aspect as, in case of the former situation he could
have requested to the Court for declaring him hostile or in the latter case, his re-
examination. Looking at this part of the statement of the complainant in
juxtaposition with other evidence, it could have said that the contraband chars
was either one slab or in 8 packets. The FSL report does not show the nature—
pukhta or garda—of the contraband chars. PW-3, the marginal witness to the
recovery memo also failed to show the exact nature of the chars. When asked
whether he had seen the chars, he replied that he did have a@ look of the
contraband chars at the time of the recovery. This answer suggests that he had
just a cursory glance at the contraband chars. As an eye witness of the recovery,
he was supposed to be fully cognizant of the incriminating material seized and
sealed in his presence. The IO (PW.2) also did not sort out the contraband chars
when he received it. On 23.12.2021, when his statement was recorded before the
learned trial Court, he admitted that when the case property was handed over to
him, he then handed it over to the Muharrar and that he had never seen it yet. In
view of the above, the fact that the complainant and his accompanying police
Officials seized 8 packets of chars, stands disproved.

12. The prosecution has categorically admitted that no report was recorded in
the police Daily Diary (DD) by the police contingent led by the complainant
while departing from and arriving back into the police station. Rather the
complainant at one place in his cross-examination stated that he had made entry
in the DD regarding his departure and arrival, but at another place admitted that
he made no such entry in the DD. The IO has also admitted that he has placed
no DD. The learned Addl. AG argued that the placement of a copy of the DD is
necessary only when a police party proceeds for conducting a raid and not
otherwise. In this respect finding it hard to agree with his argument, I would like
to refer to paras 22.48 and 22.49 of the Police Rules, 1934, in order to ascertain
the actual legal position.

“22.48 Register No. II.- (1) The Daily Diary shall be maintained in
accordance with Section 44 of the Police Act. It shall be in Form 22.48(1)
and shall be maintained by means of carbon copying process [...]

(2) The daily diary is intended to be complete record of all events
which take place at the police station. It should, therefore, record not only
the movement and _ activities of all police officers, but also visits of
outsiders, whether officials or non-officials, coming or brought to the
police station for any purpose, whatsoever. [underlining supplied]

G){--.]

@L..]

22.49 Matters to be entered in Register No. 11.— The following
matters shall, amongst other, be entered.—

(a) [...]

(b) [...]

Page 4 of 8
(c) The hour of arrival and departure on duty at or from a police
station of all enrolled police officers of whatever rank, whether posted at
the police station or elsewhere, with a statement of the nature of their
duty. This entry shall be made immediately on arrival or prior to the
departure of the officer concerned and shall be attested by the latter by
signature of seal.

(d) Every police officer of or above the rank of head constable,
when returning from duty other than an investigation in which case
diaries are submitted, shall have an entry made in the daily diary by the
station clerk or his assistant showing the place he has visited and the
duties performed by him during his absence from the police station.

(e) to (m) [...]-

13. The value of recording entries in the DD was emphasized by a learned
Division Bench of this Court in Rehmatullah vs. The State 2020 PCrLJ Note 184
[Peshawar (Bannu Bench)j:

“9. It is turning to be a common practice with the Investigating Officers
that they are lacking their interest to collect the material evidence in the
case and even no heed is paid to collect the daily diaries from the police
stations regarding the arrival and departure of all concerned with the
investigation of a particular case, as these are the documents which can
correctly explain the status of the witnesses, their presence at the spot at
the time they consume in reaching to the spot and the names of police
officials who accompany them. If these documents are brought on record,
the Investigating Officer will lose the courage to manipulate the cases in
police stations. In the present case, when the Investigating Officer was
questioned regarding the arrival and departure from the police station to
spot, he blatantly answered that he did not place on record the daily diary
in this respect. His this lack of seriousness tells nothing but to stamp him
as an interested witness and his testimony cannot wholeheartedly be
(S74 relied upon. In case titled Pir Noroz Ali Shah v. The State (2019 PCr.LJ
457) [Peshawar (Abbottabad Bench)], it was held that: ;
In order to establish’ the movement of police officials through
confidence inspiring evidence, the production of daily diary of the
police station showing the departure, constitution of raiding team,
its members and subsequent arrival, was a material piece- of
evidence in favour of prosecution. Indeed the daily diaries are
maintained under the erstwhile Police Rules, 1934. Under Rule
28.48 it is mandatory for every police official to make entry of his
departure, arrival and all proceedings conducted between the
intervening, period of departure and arrival. Non-production of
the daily diary has caused serious doubts in the prosecution case
regarding the mode and manner of raid.”

14. Another key aspect of the case is that the complainant—Imtiaz Alam—
after having sealed the chars during the recovery proceedings put a seal on the
parcel with a monogram that carried the letters ‘LS’. He admitted that the
aforesaid letters are not the initials of his name. He offered no explanation. In
Akhtar Igbal vs. The State 2015 SCMR 291, the seizing officer had used the
monogram of another police official and did not explain as to why “he had not

Page 5 of 8
put his own monogram on the seals of the parcels prepared by him [...]”.
[p291]

15. In compliance with the direction of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of
Pakistan in its order dated 12.05.2020, in Criminal Petition No. 419 of 2020, the
National Police Bureau and Ministry of Interior, Government of Pakistan has
published a “Hand Book of Criminal Investigation in Pakistan, 2021”. In the
Hand Book, the following instructions have been laid down in respect of
monogram:

Seals must display the date when sealed. They must also be tamper
evident, this means that if seals are opened or tampered, it becomes
visibly evident. The seal must display the initial of the personnel creating
it. [...p50]. The evidence be labeled and property with at least case
number and item number [...p163]. The labels should also have a seal;
the same which was used in the fastening of the container. Seal should all
be similar and the wax would be of the same kind. It should be the
ordinary office seal and should be kept under lock and key [p170].

16. There is evidence that the police contingent led by the complainant left
the police station twice; once, when it had left the police station and arrested the
appellant, and another, when it came back to the police station, brought the
appellant in custody and left again for the purpose of a search and strike
operation. In the earlier round, the complainant sent the murasila to the police
station through constable Javaid. When he reached to the police station, he saw
constable Javaid there. When asked, whether constable Javaid accompanied him
on the search and strike operation, he failed to recall that constable Javaid
accompanied him on the search and strike operation. There could have been an
explanation whether he accompanied constable Javaid on the first departure or
on the second one from the police station. By offering no explanation, he made
questionable as on which search and strike operation, constable Javaid
accompanied him. The prosecution also did not attend to this fact by making a
request to the learned trial Court for re-examination, nor did it produce
constable Javaid to clarify this position. One may argue that the deposition of
Muharrir Wasiullah (PW.3) sufficiently answer this question. The significance of
this aspect lies in the facts that all prosecution witnesses are police officials; a
copy of the DD was not produced, nor was any independent witness associated
in the case. In this perspective, the entire evidence need to be examined carefully
and cautiously, most particularly when huge quantity of contraband chars are
alleged to have been found in possession of the appellant. In case of Munir
Hussain alias Munawar alia Muno vs. The State, reported as 2019 YLR 51 [Sindh
(Sukkur Bench)], it was held that while there is no doubt that police officials are

good and independent witnesses and their evidence may be relied upon in

Page 6 of 8
recording conviction, it is also an established principle that such witnesses must
be trustworthy and confidence inspiring.

17. As discussed above, the IO didn’t check the contraband chars. Nor did he
conduct any meaningful investigation into the allegations on basis of which the
case was registered. Reference may be made to Rule 25.3 (3) of the Police Rules
which state:

“25.2 Powers to Investigating Officers.-(1) [...]

(2) [...]

(3) It is duty of an investigating officer to find out the truth of matter

under investigation. His object shall be to discover the actual facts of the

case and to arrest the real offender or offenders. He shall not commit

himself prematurely to any view of the facts for or against any person.”
18. The IO is not obliged to limit investigation to the bald assertions made in
the FIR and then lead evidence to that extent only. In other words, his job is to
discover the truth and reality of the version jotted down in an FIR. The record
shows that almost all the investigation was conducted by the raiding and
arresting police officer (PW.1), who is also complainant in the case. Legally,
another police officer from the investigation branch was supposed to conduct the
investigation.

19. The IO in instant case, did not, for example, record statement of any
independent person despite the fact that a house of one Hassan Dar was shown
in the site plan and the complainant deposed that there are houses near around
the place the occurrence. He collected no evidence worth the name whether the
appellant was previously involved in such like cases, or was a seller of
contraband chars, or had any clients in the locality, or was really coming from
Bara town. Nor did he probe as at which particular place the appellant was in
fact arrested. Indeed, what the complainant had done on the spot the IO simply
took it for granted. The separation of investigation from other functions of the
police (see Section 26 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police Act, 2017) was not
without plausible justification. In case of Taj Wali and 6 others vs. The State,
reported as PLD 2005 Karachi, 128, it was held as under:

“...The offence involves capital punishment and the case rests upon
only ANF officials, therefore, heavy responsibility lies upon the
prosecution to produce a solid piece of evidence, which eliminates
all possibilities of false involvement of an accused person, and the
evidence should be free from all doubts. In these types of cases, the
Court should also scrutinize the evidence very minutely. If a single
doubt appears in the evidence, then it should be liberally given to the
accused, because it is very easy to involve an innocent person in
he: eS Cc as witnesses are_invarial oli
witnesses and subordinate to the complainant who is also invariably
an Investigation Officer. The complainant is highly interested in the
case as he had detected the offence and would like to see that the
accused should be convicted. efore he should be_ made

Page 7 of 8
judge of his own cause. As such his version should be investigated
by another officer, which will ensure the fair investigation of the
complaint of the complainant. [pp140-141] (underlining supplied)

20. To sum up the above discussion, the prosecution has failed to prove the
exact place of the occurrence. The eyewitness to the recovery of the contraband
chars was not proved to have meaningfully seen the case property at the time of
the recovery. The exact shape of the contraband chars was negated by the
complainant/seizing officer. The copy of the DD was not placed on the record
to prove that the police party was in fact on a search and strike operation,
notably in the first round in the circumstances of the case. The initials of the
monogram not being compatible with the name of the complainant/seizing
officer, no explanation, let alone a plausible one, was offered. Above all, the IO
simply and solely toed the main line, the complainant/seizing officer had drawn
in the first report of the occurrence. The IO did not see the case property even at
the time of recording his statement before the trial Court. In other words, he
simply took it for granted, blindly subscribing to the assertion made by the
complainant/seizing officer in the first information of the occurrence. Thus, the
prosecution case suffers with material doubts. It is an established principle of law
that even a single reasonable doubt is enough to acquit an accused person. As
regards, the argument of the learned AAG regarding imposition of lesser fine
than the mandatory minimum as per section 9-C, since the prosecution has

failed to prove the charge, I hold that is not necessary at all.

21. In view of the above, appeal is allowed and the appellant Hashmat son of
Ateeq Ullah is acquitted from the charge leveled against him. He shall be sent
free forthwith, if not required to be detained in any other case.

22. These are the details reasons of my short order of even date.
