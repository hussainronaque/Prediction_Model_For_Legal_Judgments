FAZAL SUBHAN, J.-. Having failed to get the

concession of bail from the learned Court below,
petitioner Qudrat Ullah alias Ghani son of Mir Sahib
Khan seeks his release on bail through the instant bail
application, in case FIR No. 323 dated 25.7.2023,
registered under sections 324 PPC of police station Lakki
City, District Lakki Marwat.

2. Facts emanating from the FIR are that on

25.7.2023 complainant Saad Ullah Khan son of Hukam
Khan reported the matter that on 24.7.2023, he along with
his son were coming to their village and when they reached
within the limits of village Begu Khel, it was about 12:30
hours when Qudrat Ullah alias Ghani son of Mir Sahib Khan
(petitioner) duly armed with pistol, was present and on their
arrival he immediately started firing upon his son Hafiz
Zeeshan and as a result he was hit on the elbow of right
hand, whereafter the accused decamped from the spot of
occurrence. Motive for the occurrence was mentioned that
accused was enticing his son for boy-play, whereas his son
was reluctant to have friendship with him. On the report
lodged by Saad Ullah Khan in emergency room City
Hospital, the present case was registered.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for petitioner,
learned counsel for complainant assisted by learned AAG for
the State heard and record perused.

4. After tentative assessment of record it is clear
that the occurrence has allegedly taken place on 24.7.2023 at
12:30 hours while the report was lodged on 25.7.2023 at
10:20 hours, thus there is a delay of almost 22 hours in
lodging the report for which at present no_ plausible
explanation has been given. Though the injury-sheet and

MLC of the injured are available on file, however, at the
time of search of the spot neither any blood was recovered
nor any empties were taken into possession. Except the
complainant no other independent witness is cited to support
the prosecution version. Investigation in the case is already
completed and as per card of arrest the age of petitioner is
also 15/16 years and, therefore, in view of section 2 (h) of
the Juvenile Justice System Act, 2018 the petitioner having
not attained the age of 18 years is a juvenile and under
section 6 sub-section (1) of the said Act, he is to be released
on bail, if he is not involved in any heinous offence defined
in section 2 (g) of the Act. In this view of the matter a case
for grant of bail is made out in favour of the petitioner. In
identical ruling of this Court reported in “Muhammad Ali
Shah Akhtar_alias Ali-Vs-The State and another” reproted
in 2018 YLR Note 73, it was held that:-

“Having heard the arguments of learned

counsel for the parties, it appears from the

record that no doubt the role of effective fire

shot on the person of the injured complainant,

has been specifically assigned to the petitioner

coupled with the fact that the incident is of a

broad day-light and reported with promptitude

at 10.30 hours, but the non-recovery of blood,

any crime empty from the spot, the medical

examination of the injured complainant .at

10.30 hours i.e. 10 minutes prior to the

registration of the FIR, and _ blackening/

charring marks observed by the medical

Officer on his wound as well as keeping in
mind the motive advanced by complainant, are
the disturbing circumstances giving rise to a
doubt in a prudent mind about the mode and
manner of the occurrence as alleged by the
complainant.”

Similarly, in the case of Bakhtiar-Vs-The State and

another, reported in 2017 YER 2526 Peshawar (Bannu

Bench) this Court while considering the bail petition of a
juvenile offender has held that:-

“The bare reading of proviso quoted above
depicts the intention of the legislature that a
child who is below 15 years is to be granted
bail notwithstanding the nature of the charge.
Case of the petitioner is not falling within the
above category as his age has been
mentioned 14 years in Card of Arrest
prepared by the Investigation Officer on
20.8.2016. Till date none from the
complainant or prosecution has challenged
the same before any forum. Without dilating
upon the merits of the case the petitioner is
entitled to the grant of bail under Section 10
of juvenile Justice System Ordinance 2000.”

5. For the above mentioned reasons, the case of
petitioner is found to be one of further inquiry into his guilt
as well as he deserves his release on bail on the ground of
juvenility, hence this petition is accepted and petitioner is
released on bail provided he furnishes bail bonds of Rs.

5,00,000/-(Rupees Five Lac) with two local and reliable
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of trial
Court/ Illaqa Judicial Magistrate/ MOD concerned.
These are the detailed reasons of my short order of

even date.
