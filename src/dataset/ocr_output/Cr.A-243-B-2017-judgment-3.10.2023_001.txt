3. On 13.08.2011 at 19:30 hours, the complainant Noor
Muhammad brought the dead bodies of Sher Nawaz and Asghar
Khan to RHC Domel and reported in injured condition that on
the eventful day, he, along with Shah Alam Khan were
proceeding on one motorcycle, while Sher Nawaz Khan and
Asghar Khan, on another. When reached near the house of one
Muhammad Sharif, they saw in a thoroughfare accused Hazrat
Ghulam, Noor Nawaz, Umer Saeed Khan, Ikram Ullah and
Sadiq Ali, duly armed with Kalashnikovs. The accused stopped
the motorcycles of the complainant party, asking them not to
use this thoroughfare, and the same moment, also started firing
at them with their respective Kalashnikovs in order to commit
their gatl-i-amd. As a result, complainant and Shah Alam were
hit and injured; whereas, Sher Nawaz Khan and Asghar Khan
were hit and died on the spot. Motive for the occurrence is
stated to be a dispute over the thoroughfare. The occurrence is

stated to have been witnessed by the people present at the spot.
Page - 4 - of 16

4. Initially, all the accused went into hiding. After
completion of investigation, complete challan under section 173
Cr.P.C was submitted against them for proceedings under
section 512 Cr.P.C. Later, accused Hazrat Ghulam and Noor
Nawaz were arrested. They faced a full-fledged trial before the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Bannu. On conclusion of
their trial, they were convicted and sentenced vide judgment,
dated 21.10.2017, as stated above. They filed the instant
criminal appeal against it. The complainant being aggrieved
with the quantum of the sentence, preferred the connected
Criminal Revision No.53-B/2017. During its pendency, accused
Muhammad Saeed Khan was also arrested. Supplementary
challan was submitted against him. Hence, the judicial record
was sent to the learned trial court for the purpose of trial and
this appeal and the revision were adjourned sine die till the fate
of the arrested accused vide order, dated 25.02.2020. On
conclusion of his trial, the appellant Muhammad Saeed Khan
was also convicted and sentenced vide judgment, dated
15.09.2022, as mentioned above. Hence, he assailed it through
the connected Criminal Appeal No.178-B/2022. All the three
matters are being take up for disposal through this common
judgment.

5. We have anxiously considered the submissions advanced
at the bar and perused the record.

6. The injured complainant Noor Muhammad was
examined twice: firstly, as PW-09, on 15.04.2017, at the trial of
Hazrat Ghulam and Noor Nawaz, appellants in the instant
appeal and secondly, as PW-05, on 21.02.2022 at the trial
against Muhammad Saeed Khan, the appellant in the connected
appeal. He was accompanying all the three deceased on the day
of the occurrence at the relevant time. He is the victim and the

sole survivor of the incident. He got injured with fire shots. His
Page - 5 - of 16

testimony as an injured complainant is of vital importance in
the case.

7. In his examination-in-chief, he narrated the initial story
of the incident recorded in the murasila. While under cross
examination, he was challenged on several key aspects, such as,
the place and time of the occurrence; the direction of his and his
companions’ journey; the mode and manner of the occurrence;
the shifting of the two deceased Sher Nawaz and Asghar and
Sher Alam (then injured) from the scene of the occurrence; and
the presence of passersby, including notably of Shadiullah
(PW-10), brother of Shah Alam; and the motive. He
categorically deposed in his cross examination that he didn’t
fell unconscious after having been hit with fire shot and was in
his full senses. He verified the scene of the occurrence to the
1.0. after having been discharged from the hospital. He told that
he and his companions had left their house at 04.00 / 04.30
hours on motorbikes and they all were going to Bodin Khel
Adda, a place some 1-1/2 km away from the scene of the
occurrence. He correctly stated that there are date trees on both
sides of the scene of the occurrence; that the accused party was
on their left side (shown towards south in the site plan). He
stated that when both the parties confronted each other, they
didn’t exchange hot words with each other before the firing by
the accused party. Though, he had stated in the murasila that the
accused party asked them that they wouldn’t allow them going
on the thoroughfare (use of the thoroughfare stated as motive).
However, that was the accused party’s unilateral stance. The
complainant party didn’t answer or maybe they either didn’t
find an opportunity or the accused party didn’t allow them to
say something harsh in response. He reiterated that near the
scene of the occurrence, the house of Sharifullah (father of

Ikramullah, one of the absconding accused) is situated. He
Page - 6 - of 16

confirmed that none of their motorbikes was hit with fire shot.
He told that the villagers arrived at the spot and after about 20-
25 minutes, they were able to shift the two deceased and Sher
Alam then in injured condition to the Rural Health Centre
(RHC) of Domel town. He lodged the report there at 07.30
hours, thereby confirming the time of the report he had
mentioned in the murasila.

8. During his examination for the second time, he recorded
the same statement-in-chief. But he was cross examined more
bitingly. He was asked what may be called certain new
questions; for example, the time the complainant had spent in
Bodin Khel Adda, which he stated was about 1-1/2 hour; when
they reached the scene of the incident, the deceased Asghar and
Sher Nawaz was ahead him and Shah Alam, an information he
had mentioned in the murasila; the accused party raised lalkara
to stop them from using the thoroughfare; and the duration of
the firing as 7-8 seconds. The remaining cross examination was
almost on the same aspect as discussed above.

9. As regards, the presence of the passersby, particularly,
Shadiullah, in the earlier statement, he was not candidly cross
examined. Shadiullah was named only twice in the cross
examination: firstly, and indeed not straightforwardly that
Shadiullah contacted the villagers via a cell phone; and
secondly, while lodging the report, he had told to the police
official that Shadiullah was the eye witness. He was confronted
with the murasila and the trial court observed that the
information was missing in the murasila. We shall discuss the
legal status of this discrepancy later in this opinion. Regarding
other passersby, he replied negatively, stating that he named no
such person. In the latter statement, he directly challenged.
When asked, he replied that he had not seen Shadiullah at the

time of the incident. He reiterated from his earlier deposition
Page - 7 - of 16

that Shadiullah came to the spot and informed the family
members about the incident. Then, he said Shadiullah had
accompanied the dead body of Shah Alam to the RHC Domel.
Next, he spelt out a very important fact that Shadiullah didn’t
inform the police officials in the RHC, right at the time of
making of the first information report that he was the eye
witness of the incident. Another important fact he stated was
that Shadiullah accompanied the I.O. to the scene of the
incident, on whose behest the latter prepared the site plan,
which he, later on, verified after having been discharged from
the hospital. Yet another, rather most important fact he revealed
was that Shadiullah was on the way back from village Amel
Khel and he witnessed the incident. Before we proceed to
discuss this aspect of the case in greater details later while
evaluating the testimony of Shadiullah, it seems pertinent to
examine the complainant’s testimony from the perspective of
motive. The complainant did refer to previous blood feud of his
family. However, nothing was brought from his mouth that the
instant incident was committed by their other adversaries in the
village. He specifically testified that the dispute between them
and the accused party was over the use of the thoroughfare on
which they were going at the eventful day at the relevant time.

10. Shadiullah was examined as PW-10 at the trial against
Hazrat Ghulam and Noor Nawaz and as PW-06 at the trial of
Muhammad Saeed Khan. On both occasions, he recorded one
and the same examination-in-chief. He deposed that on the
eventful day, he had gone to village Amal Khel in connection
with some urgent work. On the way back to his village by foot,
when he reached around 06:30 pm to the place of the incident,
he saw both the parties; amongst the accused party, he heard
appellant Hazrat Ghulam questioning the complainant party

why it was using the thoroughfare, which is stated to be
Page - 8 - of 16

prohibited for them, then, they opened fire with which all the
four persons of the complainant party were hit; two amongst
them died on spot and the other two seriously injured. He
rushed to the spot, saw the two injured, one of whom Shah
Alam was his brother. He informed the family members on a
cell phone; in response, people reached the place of the incident
in two Datsun pickups and took the injured and the deceased to
RHC Domel, where the complainant lodged the report at 07:30
pm. He pointed to the 1.0. the place of the incident which led
the latter to prepare the site plan of incident.

11. While under cross examination, he deposed that he and
the complainant party were unaware about each other having
reached to the place of the incident. The critical aspects of his
cross examination are: firstly, at the time of incident, appellant
Hazrat Ghulam questioned why the complainant party had used
the disputed thoroughfare. This is deviation from his
examination-in-chief where he stated that all the accused
persons said so. Secondly, in his earlier statement, he said that
he had gone to village Amal Khel for an urgent work; in the
latter, he said he had gone there in connection with construction
of a mosque. Thirdly, one Irfadullah, a resident of village Amal
Khel, had taken him there on motorbike; he was coming back
on foot and intended to board a vehicle for his village from the
near around the place of incident. Fourthly, he stated that the
accused persons started firing at the complainant party when
they reached near them. This deviation from his examination-
in-chief where he said that the appellant Hazrat Ghulam had
questioned the complainant party about the use of the disputed
thoroughfare. Fifthly, he didn’t inform the police officials in
RHC Domel that he was the eye witness. He added that he told
to one Aqleem Khan who disclosed this fact to the police

officials.
Page - 9 - of 16

12. It would be pertinent to evaluate these critical aspects in
juxtaposition with his remaining cross examination. His
remaining cross examination reveals that he was able to
correctly say that he had left his house at 03:30 pm in the
company of Irfadullah, who took him to his village Amel Khel;
on the way back, he wanted to catch a passenger vehicle for
village from the disputed thoroughfare on which such vehicles
ply. He pointed out the place of the incident to the I.O.
correctly, showing positions of the parties at the time of the
occurrence, the existence of thick dates trees near around the
crime scene; the house of Muhammad Sharif near there;
distance at which he had seen the accused party and his own
point of presence. Above all, he told that he had no prior
information of the complainant party’s visit to the area. He
confirmed having seen both the parties at the place of the
incident at the relevant time and more so, all the accused
persons having fired at each one of the complainant party;
amongst whom his brother Shah Alam died later on.

13. His sudden appearance on the place of incident—
particularly when it is admitted position that he is the brother of
deceased Shah Alam and close relative of others—prompts a
question that he might have been planted there. But the fact that
the complainant Noor Muhammad had not seen him before the
happening of the incident appears to be true. The reason is that
had the complainant seen him before the incident, he would
have surely nominated him as the eye witness. His close
relationship is undeniably a factor that matters regardless of the
fact whether he was introduced as a chance witness or a natural
eye witness. One may think that the I.O. should have examined
Irfadullah as a witness of the fact that he had taken Shadiullah
on his motorbike to his village Amal Khel. But that might not

have been wholly helpful, because he didn’t accompany him on
Page - 10 - of 16

the way back to his village. No doubt, he rushed to complainant
Noor Muhammad soon after the happening of the incident and
managed to send information of the incident to the village.
However, he correctly pointed out the crime scene to the I.O.
There is nothing on the record that the complainant Noor
Muhammad might have tutored him about the mode and
manner of the incident. Last, but not the least, the deposition of
Shadiullah in examination-in-chief that appellant Hazrat
Ghulam questioned the complainant about the use of the
disputed thoroughfare or raised lalkara and his deviation in the
cross examination that all the accused opened fire soon after the
complainant party alighted from motor bikes is a minor
discrepancy, as his statement categorically shows that he was
present on the crime scene. As the testimony of PW Shadiullah
is found natural and confidence inspiring, therefore, the mere
fact that his name does not figure in the FIR is no ground to
discard his statement. In somewhat similar circumstances, this
Court in Rahat Ali v. The State and another (2018 PCr.LJ 206)

observed:
The significant piece of
evidence before us is the
hy statement of Abdar Ali Shah
a (PW-7). As stated earlier, he
has not been named in the

FIR to be the eye-witness of
the occurrence. Learned
counsel for the appellant
during the course of his
arguments vehemently urged
that since the name of Abdar
Ali Shah is not mentioned in
the FIR, therefore, his
testimony is not worth
consideration. He was of the
view that the safer course is
to keep his statement out of
Page - 11 - of 16

consideration. We know that
as a rule of prudent, Courts
should keep out of
consideration the testimony
of a witness whose name is
not figured in the FIR but it
is not a rule of law. The Court
in a fit case may go for
consideration of the
testimony of such a witness if
it is corroborated with other
reliable evidence on record
and in this view of the matter,
we would see as to whether
Abdar Ali Shah has witnessed
the occurrence and, if so, up
to what degree it has been
corroborated.

14. Even otherwise, if the statement of above said PW
Shadiullah is kept out of consideration, still we have before us
the direct testimony of injured complainant Noor Muhammad.
We found it natural, trustworthy, and confidence inspiring. It
finds complete support from the medical evidence as well as the
circumstantial evidence. It was not convincingly shattered by
the defence. The well entrenched principle of criminal
jurisprudence is that it is not the quantity, but the quality of
evidence which matters. Even a single testimony of an eye
witness is sufficient to sustain conviction if it has the ring of
truth. Reliance is placed on Muhammad Sadig v. The State
(2022 SCMR 690), wherein the Supreme Court held:

Even otherwise, if we keep
aside the testimony of Mst.
Zubaida Bibi (PW-6) even
then the petitioner can be
convicted on the solitary
statement of Ahmed Nawaz
Page - 12 - of 16

(PW-7) as it is an established
principle of law _ that
testimony of a solitary eye-
witness is sufficient to
sustain conviction of an
accused if the same rings
true and inspires confidence
and it is the quality of the
testimony of a witness that
has to be weighed and not
the quantity of witnesses.

15. Adverting to corroborative evidence, we would examine
recoveries now. As many as 17 empties of 7.62 bore were
recovered from the place of the incident. The presence of all the
appellants and firing by each one of them coupled with the FSL
report that the empties were fired from different weapons
substantiates the prosecution case. This aspect not only
excludes the possibility of the offence being committed by a
single assailant, but also points towards the involvement of
more than one assailant in the commission of the offence. The
bloodstained earth from the respective places and their
bloodstained garments with their positive FSL reports further
strengthen the prosecution case. The site plan, as discussed
above in detail, also fully buttress the prosecution case.
Moreover, the medical evidence has established that all the
three deceased and the injured complainant received injuries on
the fronts of their bodies. It lends full support to the ocular
account as far as the nature, locale, time and impact of the
injuries on the persons of the deceased and the injured are
concerned.

16. As far as motive is concerned, though the thoroughfare is
stated to be bandobasti, not privately owned by the accused
party, both the complainant and the eye witness candidly
testified that the accused party was not happy that the
Page - 13 - of 16

complainant party should use it. It is not necessary that the
accused party was preventing the complainant party from its
use because they claimed their ownership over the disputed
thoroughfare. The aforesaid PWs admitted having enmity with
other persons in the village, but they remained firm in their
depositions that they had no other dispute with the accused
party other than the use of the thoroughfare. Even otherwise,
the mere fact that the prosecution has failed to prove motive is
not by itself a reasonable ground for acquittal, especially when
the ocular account is natural, trustworthy and finds complete
support from the medical and circumstantial evidence. The
failure to prove motive may, however, react against the
quantum of sentence on a charge of murder as held by the
Supreme Court in Nadeem Ramzan v. The State (2018 SCMR
148). The relevant part of the judgment reads:

It has been held by this Court
in many cases that if the
prosecution asserts a motive
but fails to prove the same
then such failure on the part
of the prosecution may react
against a sentence of death
passed against a convict on a
capital charge and a
reference in this respect may
be made to the cases of
Ahmad Nawaz v. The State
(2011 SCMR 593), Iftikhar
Mehmood and another v.
Qaiser Iftikhar and others
(2011 SCMR 1165),
Muhammad Mumtaz v. The
State and another (2012
SCMR_ 267), Muhammad
Imran alias Asif v. The State
(2013 SCMR_ 782), Sabir
Hussain alias Sabri v. The
State (2013 SCMR_ 1554),
Zeeshan Afzal alias Shani and
Page - 14 - of 16

another v. The State and
another (2013 SCMR 1602),
Naveed alias Needu and
others v. The State and others
(2014 SCMR 1464),
Muhammad Nadeem Waqas
and another v. The State
(2014 SCMR 1658),
Muhammad Asif v.
Muhammad Akhtar and
others (2016 SCMR 2035)
and Qaddan and others v.
The State (2017 SCMR 148).
In the case in hand we find
that in the absence of proof of
the asserted motive the real
cause of occurrence had
remained shrouded in
mystery and this factor has
put us to caution in the
matter of the appellant's
sentence of death.

17. Appellant Muhammad Saeed Khan recorded his
statement on oath under section 340, Cr.P.C. He set up a
defence that during the days of the incident, he was not present
in the locality. He stated that two months prior to the incident,
he had a money dispute with appellant Hazrat Ghulam, his elder
brother. Due to that dispute, he added, he had gone to village
Dua Manzai where he was residing with one Gul Faraz. He
further added that after 10-15 days of Eid-ul-Fitr, he returned to
his village and then left for Karachi for some labour job. While
under cross examination, he couldn’t satisfactorily establish
that he was not available in the locality. He admitted that his
sister has been married to the brother of Gul Faraz. It is not
appealing to a prudent mind that his sister wouldn’t have been
informed about the occurrence. He opted to produce Gul Faraz
as his witness. But he failed to do so despite as many as five
opportunities given to him by the trial court. He thus failed to

prove his defence plea.
Page - 15 - of 16

18. The conclusion of the above discussion is that it has been
fully established that the appellants fired at the complainant
party with the intention to commit qatl-e-amd of each one of
them. They proved successful in their bid as three amongst
them—Asghar Khan, Sher Nawaz and Shah Alam—were killed
and complainant Noor Muhammad seriously injured. The
complainant being injured in the incident furnished direct, clear
and cogent evidence of having seen and identified the
appellants duly armed on the place of the incident, fired with
their respective firearm weapons with their criminal intention to
commit murder of all the four persons of the complainant party.
Even if the testimony of Shadiullah is ignored, the testimony of
the complainant is sufficient for conviction as it is direct,
substantial and confidence inspiring. The ocular account has
been fully supported by recovery of empties of 7.62 bore from
the places of presence of the appellants and bloodstained earth
from the places of presence of the three deceased and the
complainant as well as their blood stained garments with their
respective positive FSL reports. The motive has been proved.
However, even if motive is ignored, still direct evidence
couldn’t be discarded. Moreover, non-proof of motive could be
considered as a mitigating circumstance in awarding of
punishment as held by the Supreme Court in Ghulam
Muhammad _and_another_v. The State and another (2017
SCMR 2048). The same is true of the non-specific role
attributed to the appellants. Rather, each one of them is
responsible for each murder and attempted murder. It follows
that on proof, each one is liable to punishment on three counts
coupled with attempted murder of and injuries caused to the
complainant. It is thus abundantly clear that the prosecution has
been successful in establishing the charge against the appellants

beyond any shadow of doubt. However, as regards the quantum
Page - 16 - of 16

of sentence, we find that as many as five persons have been
nominated. It is not clear that whose fire shot proved fatal. The
occurrence appears to have happened at the spur of the moment.
The element of premeditation or preplanning is not discernable
from the facts and circumstances of the case. These factors
being apparent on the record, have rightly been taken as
mitigating circumstances to award the sentence of life
imprisonment. The quantum of sentence is thus found to be in
consonance with the principles laid down under the criminal
jurisprudence.

19. For the aforesaid reasons, we are firm in our view that
the impugned judgments are based on proper appraisal of
evidence on the record. The conclusions drawn and reasons
given are cogent and convincing which find complete support
from the record of the case. Hence, no interference is called for.
Consequently, both the appeals, along with the criminal

revision petition being without any substance, are hereby

dismissed.
