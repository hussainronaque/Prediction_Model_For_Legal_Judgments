JUDGMENT

ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- Through the instant
Criminal Revision, the petitioners have challenged
the order dated 03.03.2022 rendered by learned
Addl: Sessions Judge-XII, Peshawar, whereby the
application of the petitioners for their acquittal u/s
265-K Cr.P.C, on the basis of compromise was
turned down.

2. Shorts facts of the case are that
respondent Mst.Kainat d/o Nasar Ullah Khan
charged the petitioners in case FIR No.482 dated

12.04.2018 under section 506 PPC r/w section %
-2-

Ghag Act/ 25 Tel Act registered at Police Station,
Pishtakhara.

3. The petitioners applied to the competent
court for their interim pre-arrest bail which was
accordingly granted to them and latter on the pre-
arrest bail of the petitioners was confirmed vide
order dated 23.05.2018 passed by learned Addl:
Sessions Judge-XI, Peshawar on the basis of
compromise effected between the parties.
Thereafter, complete challan was put in Court for
trial against the petitioners and during pendency of
the trial, the petitioners submitted an application for
their acquittal u/s 265-K Cr.P.C The learned trial
Court after hearing arguments of learned counsel for
the parties, rejected the application. Hence, this
Criminal Revision petition. |

4. Learned counsel for the petitioners,
contended that a genuine compromise was effected
between the parties during bail stage with their
sweet will and without any duress and coercion and
to this effect a compromise deed was produced
before the court and statement of the complainant
was recorded on the basis of which the petitioners’
pre-arrest bail was confirmed. He further contended

that it is a settled principle of law and it has also
-3-
been held by the superior court that once
compromise is always compromise and the learned
trial court failed to apply his judicial mind to the
above mentioned facts and passed the impugned
order. He requested that the impugned order of
learned Addl: Sessions Judge-XII, Peshawar may be
set aside and the petitioners may be acquitted form
the charges on the basis of compromise.

3. Learned counsel for the respondents
opposed the arguments of learned counsel for the

petitioners and contended that compromise effected

at bail stage cannot be considered during trial of the

petitioners/accused.
6. Arguments heard and record perused.
Zz. The question as to whether compromise

effected at bail stage can be considered for acquittal
of accused at trial or otherwise, is the main
controversy involved in this case which needs to be

addressed by this Court. While deciding the case

titled “Syed Iftikhar Hussain Shah Vs. Syed Sabir
Hussain Shah and 2 others” (1998 SCMR 466) the
august Supreme Court refused leave to appeal
against the judgment of High Court whereby the trial
Court had been directed to acquit the accused on the

basis of compromise arrived at between the parties
-4.
at the time of pre-arrest bail. Observations of the
Hon’ble apex Court in the above referred judgment
are reproduced below.

“It may be true that while accepting
revision application, the learned Judge in
Chambers should have directed the
learned Sessions Judge to dispose of the
case in accordance with law but it is
submitted before us that the learned
Sessions Judge has already acquitted the
accused in the case which has not been
challenged by the petitioner. Be that as it
may, after reading the statement of the
petitioner recorded by the learned
Additional Sessions Jduge while disposing
of the pre-arrest bail application of
respondents, we are in no doubt that a
sum of Rs.4,000/- was received by the
petitioner as compensation for settlement
of the case as as such it is not a fit case in
which leave should be granted. The order
of the learned Judge in chamber is a just
and proper order in the circumstances of
the case and no case is made out for
interference with this order. Petition is,
accordingly, dismissed and leave to appeal

is refused”.

The principle underlying in the above
observations of the Hon’ble apex Court, so far this
Court gathers, is that once compromise effected at
bail stage can be considered for acquittal of accused

during trial.
-5-

This view was distinguished by the
apex Court in a subsequent judgment in the case of
“Muhammad Akram Vs. Abdul Wahab _and_03

others” (2005 SCMR 1342) wherein leave to appeal

was refused against the order of Lahore High Court

Multan Bench. It would be appropriate to reproduce
the observations of High Court which were

confirmed by the Hon’ble apex Court.

"(3) I have heard the learned counsel for the
petitioner at length, also have gone through
the impugned order as also the contents of
this petition. Under subsection (2) of section
345, Cr.P.C. the offences mentioned in the
first two columns given in the said section
may, with the permission of the Court
before whom any prosecution for such
offence is pending, be compounded by the
persons mentioned in the third column given
thereunder. It is an admitted position that
compromises were effected during the
pendency of petition for bail before arrest,
when the prosecution of the offences was not
pending before the learned trial Court. Such
a compromise cannot be made basis for
acquittal of the petitioner as under section
345(2), Cr.P.C. it is the trial Court which
has to satisfy itself and grant permission to
compound the offence being tried by it. I
find no illegality or jurisdictional error in
the impugned orders and maintain the same.
The case-law cited by the learned counsel
for the petitioner is not applicable to the

facts and circumstances of this case."
-6-

The august Supreme Court in the case
of Muhammad Akram supra while deciding the
CPLA against the above order of the Lahore High

Court, observed that:

“5. We have considered the contentions of
the learned counsel for the petitioner and
carefully scanned the record available.
Admittedly the petitioner was granted bail
solely on the ground that the complainant
party including injured filed affidavits in
favour of the petitioner; that he may be
released on _ bail. Subsequently, after
completion of the investigation, police
submitted charge-sheet against him before
the trial Court where the case is pending for
trial. The trial Court and the learned High
Court rightly rejected the application of the

petitioner”.

According to the principle laid down in
the above referred judgment, compromise effected at
bail stage cannot be considered during trial of the
accused.

8. In a recent judgment rendered by the

‘

august Supreme Court in the case titled “Tariq
Mehmood Vs. Naseer_Ahmad_and_others” (PLD
2016 Supreme Court 347), two categories of cases
mentioned in sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) of
section 345, Cr.P.C were discussed and it was held
that compromise effected in the cases categorized

under sub-section (1) of Section 345, Cr.P.C take
-7-
effect from the moment it is effected by the parties
and none of them can resile from it at subsequent
stage of the case while compromise at bail stage in
the cases falling under sub-section (2) of section
345, Cr.P.C could not be taken effect to at the stage
of trial if the complainant party resiles from the
compromise. The principles laid down by the apex
Court in this regard are as under:-

“Subsection (1) of Section 345, Cr.P.C enlists
the offences which may be compounded by the
specified persons without any intervention of
any Court and in some of the above
mentioned precedent cases it had been
clarified that compounding in such cases takes
effect from the moment the compromise is
completely entered into by the parties, the
relevant Court which is to try the offence in
issue is left with no jurisdiction to refuse to
give effect to such a compromise and a party
to such a compromise cannot resile from the
compromise at any subsequent stage of the
case. On the other hand subsection (2) of
section 345, Cr.P.C deals with cases in which
the offences specified therein can be
compounded only with the permission of the
Court and in all such cases any compromise
arrived at between the parties on their own at
any stage is not to take effect at all unless the
Court permits such compromise to be given
effect to and the relevant Court for the
purpose is the Court before which prosecution

for the relevant offence is pending”.
-8-
9. In the present case the petitioners are
charged under Section 506 PPC r/w section 3/4
Ghag Act/25 Tel Act. Sections 3/4 Ghag Act / 25
Tel Act are not compoundable while section 506
PPC though compoundable but cannot be
compounded without intervention of the trial Court.
The compromise in this case was arrived at between
the parties before the Court which was seized of the
pre-arrest bail of the accused/petitioners and was
undoubtedly not the trial Court. For convenience
section 345(1) is reproduced as under:-

345. Compounding of offences. (1) The
offences punishable under the sections of the
Pakistan Penal Code (XLV of 1860) [specified in
the first two columns of the table next following
may be compounded by the persons mentioned in
the third column of that table:-

10. From the bare reading of above provision of
law, it is clear that offences mentioned in the table
which is part of this sub section can be compounded
at any stage and the compromise shall be effective
for subsequent proceedings. Section 345 (2) Cr.P.C
provides mechanism for the compounding of

offences but with the permission of the trial Court.
-9-
For convenience section 345 (2) CrP.C_ is
reproduced as under:

(2) [Subject to sub-section (7), the offences
punishable under the sections of the Pakistan
Penal Code specified in the first two columns of
the table next following may, with the permission
of the Court before which any prosecution for
such offence is pending, be compounded by the
persons mentioned in the third column of that
table:- In case of Tariq Mehmood Vs Naseer
Ahmad and others Supra the Hon’ble Apex Court
has already laid to rest this question and in
unequivocal terms has held that offences coming
under the purview of section 345 (1) Cr.P.C if once
compounded then that compromise for all practical
purposes shall be considered in the subsequent
proceedings. While the offences mentioned in
section 345(2) Cr.P.C can only be compounded with
the permission of the trial court, therefore, a full
fledge mechanism has been laid down in section 345
of the Cr.P.C for the composition of the offences,
submission of the learned counsel that in all cases
once compromise is effected, the same shall be
considered for the acquittal of the accused during

subsequent proceedings is misconceived being
-10-

against the mandate of law as well as the dictum laid
down by the Hon’ble Apex Court in the above
referred judgments.

11. In the present case as already observed two of
the sections are non-compoundable while section
506 PPC as per table which is part of 345 (1) Cr.P.C
is compoundable only when the offence is not
punishable with imprisonment for seven years, in
other words when the offence under section 506
PPC comes under the part-1 of the ibid section than
the provision of section 345(1) Cr.P.C will come
into play, otherwise if it is covered by para-2 of
section 506 PPC then permission of the trial court is
necessary and without permission of the trial court,
compromise at bail stage shall not be considered in
the subsequent proceedings. Furthermore, perusal of
compromise deed as well as statement of the
complainant recorded before the learned trial would
reveal that the complainant had compromised the
matter with the petitioners only to the extent of
confirmation of pre-arrest bail of the petitioners and
there is no mention with regard to the acquittal of
the petitioners at trial stage.

12. In light of the above discussion, this

Court arrives at the conclusion that
-1ll-
petitioners/accused cannot be acquitted on the basis
of compromise effected by the complainant at bail
stage in view of the principles laid down in the ibid
judgment of the august Supreme Court lastly
mentioned as the compromise had been effected at
bail stage which was not effective at the stage of
trial. The impugned order is not suffering from any
illegality or irregularity which does not warrant
interference by this court. Resultantly, this Criminal
Revision is dismissed.

Announced.
