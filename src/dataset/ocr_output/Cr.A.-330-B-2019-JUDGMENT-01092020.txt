SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J- Through the instant

criminal appeal, the petitioner has assailed the judgment dated
22.10.2019 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge-V,
Bannu, dated 22.10.2019, whereby the appellants involved in
case F.].R No. 380 dated 05.07.2018 registered at Police Station
Domel, Bannu were convicted under section 302(b) P.P.C and
sentenced to imprisonment for life alongwith compensation
Rs.2;00,000/- (two lac) (on two counts) to the legal heirs of
deceased under section 544-A Cr.P.C or in default to undergo six
months SI on two counts. They were further convicted under
section 148/149 P.P.C and sentenced to three years RI on two

counts with fine of Rs.20,000/- each on two counts and in default
Azam (PS? (D8) Hon ble Ms justice Musarrat Hilali & Han ble Mr Justice Sahibcade Asatullah
of payment of fine to further undergo four months SI. It was
directed that all the sentences shall run concurrently and benefit
of section 382-B P.P.C was also extended in their favour. The
complainant Habib-ur-Rehman and Saadullah Khan also filed
Cr. R No.64 -B/2019 for enhancement of sentence against the
appellants, hence this judgment shall decide both.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on 05.07.2018 at
10.45 hours, complainant Habibur Rehman alongwith dead-
bodies of Sajjad Khan son of Habibur Rehman and Aminullah
son of Saadullah, in Khalifa Gulnawaz Hospital, Bannu
township, reported the matter to Asar-ul-Islam ASI, to the effect
that he alongwith his son Sajjad Khan, Aminullah and Ala Khan
were sitting in front of the shop of Raheemullah. In the
meanwhile at about 10.00 hours, accused Baitullah, Sanaullah,
Hanifullah Saifullah and Zainullah armed with pistols appeared
and started indiscriminate firing at them, as a result of which
Sajjad Khan and Aminullah hit and fell down, while the
complainant and Ala Khan luckily escaped unhurt. The accused
after commission of offence decamped form the spot. The
complainant party could do nothing being empty handed. When
they attended. the injured, they had died. Motive alleged to be
altercation betweei-the’.déceased and the accused party, some
days prior to. thie oveumrence. The report of complainant was
reduced in shape of Murasila Ex:PW-03/1, and.sent to the Police

Station through constable Aslam No.701, which-was culminated

into F.I.R Ex:PA. After preparing the injury sheets Ex:PW 5/2
and 5/5, and inquest reports Ex:PW-5/6 and 5/3 the deceased
were sent to the doctor under the escort of Rahat No. 5821 (PW-
07) for their post mortem examination. After completion of
investigation challan was submitted before the learned trial
Court. On commencement of trial, the learned trial Court
summoned the accused from jail, who were produced in custody.
The learned trial Court after complying with the provision of
section 265-C, Cr.P.C, framed the charge against the appellants,
to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The
prosecution in order to prove its case, produced and examined
(12) twelve witnesses in support of its case and on conclusion of
trial the learned trial court recorded statement of accused/
appellants under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein they professed
their innocence, however, they did not opt to produce defence or
to be examined on oath as provided under section 340(2) Cr.P.C.
The learned trial Court after hearing arguments of learned
counsel for the parties vide impugned judgment dated
22.10.2019 convicted and sentenced the appellants as mentioned
above. The accused/ appellants challenged the impugned
judgment through instant criminal appeal, while the complainant
filed Cr.R No.64-B/2019 for enhancement of sentence.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties and
learned Addl: A.G representing the State heard and with their

valuable assistance the record gone through.
4, The incident occurred at 10.00 a.m on 05.07.2018,
where the deceased Aminullah son of Saadullah and Sajjad son
of Habibur Rehman lost their lives, which resulted into a charge
against the accused/ appellants. The matter was reported by one
Habibur Rehman son of Mir Tajam Khan, who happened to be
the father of deceased Sajjad. The matter was reported to the
local police of Police Station Domel, when on information they
reached to Khalifa Gulnawaz Hospital, where the dead-body of
the deceased were transported by the co-villagers, accompanied
by the complainant and the abandoned eye-witness Alla Khan.
The complainant reported that on the eventful day he alongwith
Alla Khan and the deceased were present in front of the shop of
one Raheemullah when the appellants / accused appeared duly
armed with 30 bore pistols and started indiscriminate firing on
them as well as the deceased, where they luckily escaped unhurt
and the deceased Sajjad and Aminullah got hit who breathed
their last.

5. The learned counsel for the appellants submitted
that both the eye-witnesses were not present at the spot at the
time of incident and that it was after receiving the information
regarding the incident they attracted to the spot. He further
submitted that the prosecution could not establish its case against
the accused/ appellants through cogent, convincing and
confidence inspiring evidence; and that the circumstances do not

support case of the prosecution. It was lastly submitted that the
purpose of presence of the witnesses is not established from
record and that the medical evidence is in conflict with the
ocular account.

6. The record transpires that the incident was stated to
occur in front of the shop of one Raheemullah, where the
complainant, Alla Khan (the abandoned eye-witness) and the
deceased were sitting on cots. We are to see as to whether the
complainant established his presence on the spot with the
deceased at the time of incident and as to whether the purpose
for presence advanced by the complainant appeals to a prudent
mind. There is no denial to the fact that the complainant happens
to be the father of deceased Sajjad and that the motive advanced
was an altercation between the appellants and the deceased, few
days ago. The complainant was examined as PW-06, who stated
that on the eventful day he alongwith Alla Khan and the
deceased were leaving for Peshawar in order to conduct medical
fitness tests for the deceased to acquire Visa and that at the time
of incident they were sitting in front of the shop when the
accused /appellants appeared and resorted to indiscriminate
firing. The contention of the complainant is lacking substance, as
he could not produce anything in this respect to the Investigating
Officer, that they were leaving for medical checkup and even
this was admitted on record by: the Investigating Officer that
nothing was recovered from the bodies of the deceased, which

could support the claim of the complainant. The complainant
was thoroughly cross-examined who went on improving his case
constantly and as such his statement is replete with dishonest
improvements. He stated that when the accused/ appellants
appeared he saw them from a distance of 10-paces, holding
pistols in their hands and that when they fired at the deceased he
alongwith Alla Khan ran away from the spot and the accused/
appellants fired at them as well, where they luckily escaped
unhurt, but in his report he kept mum regarding this particular
aspect of the case. The complainant stated that the motive for
commission of the offence was an early altercation between the
deceased and the appellants, when so, we are surprised that why
the complainant and the eye-witness were fired at, when they
had no nexus to the stated motive. The record tells that five real
brothers are charged for murder of the deceased but the
prosecution remained unsuccessful to convince this Court as to
what magnitude of the motive was that put all the real brothers to
do away with the deceased. The complainant miserably failed to
explain the motive and its intensity which led to the present
tragedy. Neither the complainant could produce independent
witness in this respect nor the Investigating Officer could collect
anything from the surroundings, which could substantiate the
claim of the complainant. The complainant went on to say that
only three out of the accused had altercated with the deceased,
but he could fot explain that when and where this altercation

took place. The complainant introduced the shop keeper, namely,
Raheemullah, who was Chachazad of deceased Aminullah who
was examined as PW-11, who stated that prior to the incident he
was standing at the door step of his shop and at the time of firing
he took shelter inside his shop, when this witness was further
cross-examined he stated that he did not see the appellants while
firing at the deceased and that it was after the firing was made he
came out of his shop. This witness went in glaring contradiction
with what the complainant stated, as he stated that the accused
when reached near the deceased they drew out their pistols and
started firing, whereas the complainant stated that was from a
distance of ten paces, he noticed the appellants having pistols in
their hands. We are surprised to see that when PW Raheemullah
was inside his shop and he did not see the accused at the time of
firing, how could he say and how could he see the accused
/appellants pulling out their pistols before the firing was made.

7. The presence of the complainant is further doubted
when he admitted in his cross-examination that it was not his
routine to enjoy the’ company of the deceased, rather the medical
checkup at Peshawar brought them together on the day of
occurrence. The complainant stated that soon after the incident
the accused/ appellants decamped form the spot, where after he
came towards the. deceased and with the help of co-villagers
shifted them to cots, but the Investigating Officer did not notice
as to whether his hands were besmeared with blood or not. The

complainant stated: that the deceased were shifted in a datsun to
~.

Khalifa Gulnawaz Hospital and he after making the report came
back to his village in the company of Alla Khan. We are
surprised to see that how a real father and real brother could
leave the dead-bodies of the deceased unattended and unescorted
and that why they did not take the pains to accompany the dead-
bodies to the hospital for post mortem examination. The conduct
of the complainant is not only unnatural but abnormal as well,
when he went back to his village in an unholy haste.

8. The report was made to one Asar Islam ASI, who
was examined as PW-03, who stated that he received
information in Police Station Domel and after getting
information he rushed to the hospital where the complainant
reported the matter. It is pertinent to mention that the place of
incident is nearer to-RHC Domel than Khalifa Gulnawaz
Hospital, but surprisingly, the dead-bodies were transported to
Khalifa Gulnawaz Hospital instead of RHC Domel. It further
increases our anxiety that when the matter was reported at
Khalifa Gulnawaz Hospital then what for the dead-bodies were
taken to RHC Domel. The presence of the complainant is further
doubted that neither he nor the eye-witness Alla Khan are the
witnesses of identification before the police at the time of
preparation of the injury sheets and inquest reports. Similarly
none of the witnesses identified the dead-bodies before the
doctor at the time of their post mortem examination, which leads

us nowhere, but to hoid that the complainant was not present at
the time of incident and the report was made when his
attendance was procured. This tells nothing but that the report
was made after preliminary investigation. There is no cavil to the
proposition that reports which are made after preliminary
investigation loses its sanctity and the Court must be on guards
while convicting the accused that too on capital charges.

9. The Investigating Officer visited the spot and on
pointation of the complainant six empties of 30 bore alongwith
blood stained earth from the places of the deceased were
recovered. The empties collected from the spot were sent to the
office of the chemical examiner (FSL), to ask an opinion as to
whether these were fired from one weapon or more. The
Laboratory report was received on 10.07.2018 which tells that
the recovered empties were fired from one weapon. The accused
Baitullah was arrested on 10.07.2018 and a 30 bore pistol was
recovered from his possession while, in police custody another
pistol was recovered on his pointation, the pistol and empties
were sent again for an opinion to the Forensic Sciences
Laboratory but the report was received in negative.

10. The prosecution examined two witnesses namely,
the complainant and the shop keeper Raheemullah but both the
witnesses went on constant improvements with the sole purpose
to bring their statements in line with the prosecution story. The
record tells that the complainant did not utter a single word in his

report that they ran away from the spot and the appellants fired at
-10-

them, whereas in his court statement he stated that when the
accused/ appellants reached to the place of incident and started
firing on the deceased he alongwith the eye-witness ran away
from the spot and the accused were firing at them from behind,
but surprisingly no empty was recovered as it is in the statement
of the complainant that the appellants made ten fire shots at
them. The complainant while making the report did not mention
the shop keeper, namely, Raheemullah to be the eye-witness of .
the occurrence but later on after hectic efforts he was brought
before the Court during trial and was examined as prosecution
witness. The Investigating Officer prepared the site-plan at the
instance of the complainant where Raheemullah was shown at
point Nos. just in middle of the door of the shop and an
impression was given that at the time of firing he was watching
the incident, but this witness stated that he rushed inside the shop
to take shelter and that he came out when the accused/ appellants
had left the spot. When he realized the blunder he committed, he
went on to say that he saw the accused before firing while
pulling out their pistols. This witness failed to convince us of his
presence at the spot, particularly when he went in open
contradiction with the complainant. These improvements on part
of the witnesses caused a greater damage. to the case of the
prosecution and the witnesses have lost their worth and
credibility. PW Raheemullah was not willing to appear before

the Court and an attempt was made through the trial court to
-ll-

compel his appearance and it was after a month or so from
recording of statement of the complainant that he turned up. This
witness was self confused, as he stated that owing to his
presence at Peshawar in pursuit of his livelihood he could not
appear before the Court in time, but his this explanation turned
surprising as he was shown of having a permanent shop at his
village, which finds mention in the site-plan. If we say yes, to
what he stated then his presence at his village as shop keeper in
the days of occurrence is beyond understanding.

11. This is astonishing that Alla Khan was abandoned
despite the fact that he happened to be a brother of one of the
deceased and his non-production tells nothing but that he was not
ready to support the false charge of the complainant. We cannot
ignore that in the episode two persons were done to death, one
son of the complainant and the other brother of the eye-witness,
so both of them having equal grudge and anger, but what we
gather from is that in fact the complainant and eye-witness
reached to the place of occurrence after the deceased were done
to death and that it was the complainant who initially persuaded
the eye-witness Alla Khan to charge the appellants but on later
realization he was not ready to support the false claim of the
complainant. Withholding of the best possible evidence favours
none but the accused. Article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat
Order, 1984, caters for the situation and the Courts are left with

no option but to apply the principle of negative inference, as has
-12-

been held by the apex Court in case titled, “Riaz Alimad Vs the

State” (2010 SCMR 846), wherein it is held that:

“One of the eye-witnesses Manzoor
Hussain was available in the Court
on 29-7-2002 but the prosecution did
not examine him, declaring him as
unnecessary witness without
realizing the fact that he was the
most important, only serving witness,
being an eye-witness of the
occurrence. Therefore, his evidence
was the best piece of the evidence,
which the prosecution could have
relied upon for proving the case but
for the reasons best known, his
‘evidence was withheld and he was
not examined. So a _ presumption
under Illustration (g) of Article 129
of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984
can fairly be drawn that had the eye-
witness Manzoor Hussain. been
examined in the Court his evidence
would have been unfavourable to the

prosecution.”

12. We cannot ignore that five real brothers have been
charged, where one of the deceased received one firearm injury
and the other two firearm injuries and the Investigating Officer
collected six empties of 30 bore from the place of occurrence.
The number of injuries do not commensurate with the number of

accused and even the Forensic Sciences Laboratory report does
-13-

not support the case of the prosecution, as the collected empties
after chemical examination were found to have been fired from
one 30 bore pistol. This piece of evidence has lost its integrity
and cannot be taken against the appellants as valid piece of
evidence. The seat of injuries on persons of the deceased and the
places of the assailants where they were standing at the time of
firing find no support from the medical evidence, as one of the
deceased had received two firearm injuries from the back side
whereas the other from left to right, whereas the circumstances
suggest that the deceased were facing the accused at the time of
incident. One of the deceased received an entry wound from his
right with its exit to left which further belies the stance of the
prosecution, had he been facing the accused or having his back
exposed to the accused then either the entry would have been on
the front or back, but not from left to right, so it can safely be
held that the medical evidence does not support the case of
prosecution.

In case titled “Akhter Saleem and another Vs the

State and another” (2019 MLD 1107), it is held that:

“12,.The above factors, material
contradictions between ocular and
medical evidence create serious
doubts in the happening of alleged
occurrence and it is well settled law
that even a single doubt, if found

reasonable, would entitle the accused
-14-

person to acquittal and not a

combination of several doubts.”

13. The motive advanced was stated to be an
altercation between the parties few days prior to the occurrence,
but neither the complainant could produce an independent
witness in that regard nor the investigating officer took the pains
to collect any evidence in that respect. The complainant could
not explain that when, where and how the altercation took place
and with which of the accused/ appellant. The complainant was
examined on this particular aspect of the case, he stated that only
three of the accused out of the appellants had altercated with the
deceased. The joining hands of five real brothers to do away with
the deceased that too for an altercation does not appeal to a
prudent mind. We know that prosecution is not bound to setup
motive in every case but once it is alleged and not proved, then
ocular account is required to be scrutinized with great caution.

In case titled "Muhammad Ashraf alias Acchu Vs
The State" (2019 SCMR 652 Para-7), wherein it has been held

that: -

"7, The motive is always a double-
edged weapon. The complainant Sultan
Ahmad (PW9) has admitted murder
enmity between the parties and has
also given details of the same in his
statement recorded before the trial
court. No doubt, previous enmity can

be a reason for the appellant to commit
[7A

-15-

the alleged crime, but it can equally be
a reason for the complainant side to
falsely implicate the appellant in this

case for previous grouse."

14. After thoroughly evaluating the evidence available —
on file this court reaches to an inescapable conclusion that the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case against
accused/appellants. Resultantly, this appeal is, therefore,
allowed, the conviction and sentence of the appellants recorded
by the learned trial court is set-aside and they are acquitted of the
charge by extending him the benefit of doubt, they shall be
released forth with from jail, if not required to be detained in
connection with any other case. As the appeal has been allowed

so Cr. R No.64-B of 2019 stands dismissed.
