IN THE HIGH COURT OF SINDH, BENCH AT SUKKUR

Crl. Bail Application No.S- 252 of 2021.

­­­
1.     
For Orders on office objection. 
2.    
For hearing of Bail Application
03-05-2021.
            Mr. Sohail
Ahmed Khoso, advocate for the applicant.
Mr.
Aftab Ahmed Shar, APG for the State. 
>>>>>>>…<<<<<<<<
Irshad Ali Shah, J; It
is alleged that the applicant with rest of the culprits, after having formed an
unlawful assembly and in prosecution of their common object, committed murder
of Zia-ul-Haq by causing him hammer, iron rod blows and then went away by
insulting and causing fists, kicks and butt blows to complainant Irshad-ul-Haq
and PW Mazhar-ul-Haq, for that the present case was registered.
2.         The applicant on having been refused
pre-arrest bail by learned Additional Sessions Judge-II, Naushahro Feroze, has
sought for the same from this Court by way of instant bail application under
Section 497 Cr.P.C.
3.         It is contended by learned counsel for
the applicant that applicant being innocent has been involved in this case falsely
by the complainant party; the FIR of the incident has been lodged with delay of
about one day and injury to the attributed to the applicant as per post mortem
report was not found sustained by the deceased, therefore, the applicant is
entitled to be released on bail on point of further inquiry. 
4.        It is contended by learned APG for the
State that the applicant is neither innocent nor is involved in this case
falsely by the complainant; the delay in lodgment of the FIR is explained and
injury sustained by the deceased, which is attributed to the applicant is very
much available on his head, therefore the applicant is not entitled for grant
of post arrest bail as his case is not calling for further inquiry. 
5.         I have considered the above arguments
and perused the record.
6.        The applicant is named in FIR with
specific allegation that he caused iron rod blow to the deceased on his head.
Whatever is stated in the FIR is taking support from ancillary evidence. In
that situation, it would be premature to say that applicant being innocent has
been involved in this case falsely by the complainant party. The delay in
lodgment of FIR by one day is explained in the FIR itself, same even otherwise
could not be resolved by this Court at this stage. The deceased as per post
mortem report, was found sustaining injury on left temporo frontal region of his
head and same apparently is attributed to the applicant. The deeper
appreciation of the facts and circumstances even otherwise is not permissible
at bail stage. There appear reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant is
guilty of the offence with which he is charged. No case for grant of bail to
the applicant is made out; consequently the instant bail application is
dismissed.
