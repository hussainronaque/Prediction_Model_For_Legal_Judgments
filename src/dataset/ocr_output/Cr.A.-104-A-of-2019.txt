III IIR RRR IK

WIQAR_ AHMAD, J.- After being indicted for
the murder of Noor Alam Shah (deceased) in
case FIR No. 120 dated 24.08.2015
registered under Section 302 PPC at Police
Station Banna Tehsil Allai District Battagram,
learned Additional Sessions  Judge-|
Battagram has also found appellant (Noor
Habib Shah) guilty, convicted him under
Section 302 (b) PPC and sentenced to life
imprisonment with a fine of Rs.2,00,000/-,
payable as compensation under Section 544-
A Cr.P.C, or in default to suffer six (06)
months S.I with benefit of Section 382-B
Cr.P.C vide judgment dated 04.04.2019
Aggrieved from ibid judgment,
complainant (Muhammad Hassan Shah) has

also filed Cr.Revision No. 17-A/2019 for
enhancement of sentence of the appellant
from life imprisonment to normal penalty of
death, therefore, through this single judgment
both these matters are proposed to be
decided together.

2. According to the prosecution story,
as explained in the murasila (Ex.PA), on
24.08.2014 at 14:39 hours complainant
namely, Muhammad Hassan Shah (PW-03)
while accompanying dead body of his brother
(Noor Alam Shah) at Emergency Ward of
Tehsil Headquarter Hospital Banna lodged
report of the crime to Imtiaz Ali Shah, ASI
(PW-01) where he alleged that on the fateful
day at 14:00 hours appellant (Noor Habib
Shah) had been cutting maize crops near his
house. He (complainant) and his deceased
brother (Noor Alam Shah) had prevented him
from doing so, upon which the appellant
started firing at his brother as a result of
which the latter had sustained injuries on left
side of his chest and died on the spot. The
appellant was stated to have decamped from
the spot. The occurrence was also witnessed

by his brother namely, Syed Hameed Shah
(PW-04) besides him. Motive for the crime
was shown the dispute that arose because of
cutting maize in their field. On report of
complainant (PW-03), Murasila (Ex.PA) was
drafted by Imtiaz Ali Shah, ASI (PW-01) and
same was sent to Police Station, whereupon
the ibid FIR (Ex.PA/1) was registered at the
Police Station.

3. After completion of investigation,
challan was submitted before the learned trial
court. Formal charge was framed against
appellant, to which he pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. In order to prove its case,
prosecution produced twelve (12) witnesses,
whereafter accused was examined under
Section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he denied the
allegations and professed innocence. At the
conclusion of trial, learned trial Judge
convicted and sentenced the appellant as
mentioned above vide impugned judgment.
Aggrieved from the ibid judgment, appellant
has filed the instant appeal.

4. We have heard arguments of learned

counsel for the parties as well as the learned
Additional Advocate General and gone
through the record.

5. Perusal of record reveals that
appellant was solely charged for commission
of the offence by the complainant, to whom
he had not been inimical earlier. The place of
occurrence was in front of complainant’s
house. Complainant has stated in his first
report that the appellant had been cutting
maize crops in their landed property near their
house, when he came out of his house
alongwith his deceased brother (then alive)
namely, Noor Alam Shah, for preventing the
appellant from cutting the crop. When his
deceased brother reached near the appellant,
he made firing on him, as a result of which,
his brother received injury on left side of his
chest and died at the spot while the appellant
fled away from the scene. The occurrence
was also stated to have been witnessed by
their third brother Syed Hameed Shah (PW-
04). The time of occurrence was shown as
14:00 hours on 24.08.2015 while report
thereof was lodged at 15:45 hours on same

day. Distance between spot of occurrence
and police station was shown to be 10 / 11
kilometers in the mountainous area of Allai,
District Battagram and, therefore, the report
can be considered as a promptly lodged one
by keeping in view the distance through which
the complainant had to take dead body to the
hospital or police station both of which were
situated nearby. The doctor was examined as
PW-10, who has_ given the following

narrations of injuries;

1. No mark of ligature on neck.

2.A healthy body of young man
wearing the brown color shalwar
kamez which was stained with
blood. The clothes were signed
and handed over to the police.

3. Rigor mortis developed.
4. Wounds.

A.Entry wound. A 1x1 cm wound
on left shoulder joint anteriorly
just above the axilla. The wound
is bleeding.

B.Exit wound. No exit wound
present. Bullet present in chest
cavity as shown in X-Ray chest.

Note: Bullet not recovered after
trying my best from chest.

5. Scalp, skull and vertebrae. Skull
not opened.

6. Left lung and blood vessel of
thorax were damaged.
7. Pericardium full of blood. Other
organs of chest were normal as
mentioned in my report.

In my opinion the cause of death
was due to damage to the heart
vessel (aorta) and left lung, as the
bullet traveled in medial direction
towards the heart vessels. The
probable time between injury and
death is sudden and between death
and post mortem 4-10 hour.
He was also subjected to cross-examination
but nothing beneficial to the case of appellant
could be solicited from his mouth. Statement
of the complainant was_ found _ fully
corroborated by medical evidence.
6. The other eyewitness namely, Syed
Hameed Shah, was examined as PW-04. He
has also given similar narration of the
occurrence in his examination-in-chief. In his
cross-examination no major contradiction
could be solicited from his mouth. The
witness has, however, stated in reply to one
of the question in cross-examination that it
was a vacant place (not covered by maize
crops) where occurrence had taken place. He
has also stated in the sentence following

thereafter that when his brothers had gone to

refrain the appellant from cutting maize crops,
he had been present at home. He has kept on
saying that the appellant had made firing from
the maize crops. It was also stated that he
might have cut 3 / 4 maize plants by then.
The complainant while deposing in his cross-
examination had also stated that they, at the
time of spot inspection, had shown the
appellant in an open place and not in the field
of maize crops. Taking these two excerpts
from statements of the eyewitnesses learned
counsel for the appellant had tried to develop
an argument that the eyewitnesses had not
been consistent in respect of the place where
the accused had been present at the time of
occurrence. He has also contended that the
other witness i.e. PW-04 (Syed Hameed
Shah) was not present at the spot of
occurrence, but was rather present in his
home. We would not be able to agree with the
learned counsel for the appellant in this
regard. When the statement is read in its
context, things becomes manifestly clear.
Regarding the former mentioned objection of
the learned counsel, it is apparent that site

plan shows the appellant at margin where the
maize crop starts. He had not been shown
inside the maize crop and same was the
statement given by complainant that they had
shown accused at open place and not inside
maize crops, in the site plan. The other
witness had also given a similar narration for
the reason that outside the margin of maize
crops there was open field and appellant was
present there. Even otherwise, a part of site
plan where the investigating officer tries to re-
enact happening of an occurrence is not a
substantive piece of evidence. Reliance in
this respect may be placed on the judgment
of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the
case of “Taj Muhammad Vs. Muhammad
Yousaf & 02 others” reported as PLD 1976
SC 234 wherein it has been held;

“It was hardly realized that the site
plan itself is not a substantive piece
of evidence which, could be used to
contradict or _ discredit the
unchallenged evidence of the three

eye-witnesses.”

Further reliance in this respect may
also be placed on the judgment delivered by

Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the
case of “Javed Ishfaq Vs. The State” reported
as 2020 SCMR 1414.

7. Objection of learned counsel for the
appellant that the eyewitness Syed Hameed
Shah (PW-04) had not been present at the
spot, is also arising from misinterpretation of
the relevant sentence in his cross-
examination. It is important to be noted that it
was in reply to a question of the cross-
examiner where also the witness had stated
that when the two brothers i.e. complainant
and deceased had been leaving their house,
he had been present at home. It means that
he was not absent from his house but present
therein. The time of leaving the house was
slightly prior to the occurrence. From this, it
cannot be detected that he had not followed
his two brothers even when there was
likelihood of the dispute and when the place
of dispute was just in front of their house.
Statement of this witness had also remained
fully consistent with the complainant
regarding all the facts that had taken place at
the time of, prior and after the occurrence.

Both the witnesses had stated that their sister
10

had brought cot for taking the deceased to
hospital. Both have stated that they had not
attempted to catch the appellant after the
occurrence and that they had rather attended
to their falling brother. Both the witnesses had
also stood consistent in rest of their
testimonies. Besides, manufactured
inconsistencies created in statements of
eyewitnesses due to efforts of a relentless
cross-examiner should not be overweighed.
When presence of a PW is believable at the
spot, intrinsic worth of his testimony is
acceptable and the witness is not found
inimical and biased but truthful in respect of
his narrations made in his examination in
chief, then statement of such witness should
not be discarded for any inconsistency that is
crafted during course of his cross-
examination through skills of a learned cross
examiner. Honourable Supreme Court of
Pakistan, while giving its judgment in the case
of “Roshan & 04 others Vs. The State”
reported as PLD 1977 SC 557 has laid down
the following principle for appreciation of

evidence in such cases:-
11

“Some counsel devotes all their
energies to create contradictions,
and to this end lengthy cross-
examination is conducted for hours
and days which is intended to
confuse, even an_ intelligent
person, and is not calculated to
elicit any useful information. This
exercise is undertaken because
Courts give undue importance to
contradictions found in the
statements of the prosecution
witnesses. The primary
consideration in appraising the
evidence given by a witness is to
determine, firstly, why has he
offered to testify? Has he seen the
occurrence? If so, has the Witness
a motive to implicate a person who
was not among the culprits or to
exaggerate the part played by any
of them? If a witness satisfies
these two tests, then the Court
should watch the — general
demeanor of the witness in order
to judge the quality of his
perception and his faculty to recall
the past incidents: A witness may
make contradictory statements on
some of the details of the incident
in respect of which he is deposing
in Court. The variation may be due
to mere lapse of memory or the

confusion caused in his mind by a
12

relentless cross-examiner. Very
often a witness gives an incorrect
statement because he must
answer every question regardless
of the fact whether he knows the
answer to it or not. It is not
uncommon that the — cross-
examiner puts words in the mouth
of witnesses and the presiding
officer is not vigilant enough to
check it. It is also common
experience that, without any
particular intent, even educated
people exaggerate when
describing an event. Some
witnesses may be prone to it more
than others. Mere contradictions,
therefore, do not lead to the result
that whatever the witness has said
on the salient features of the case
and which conforms to the other
evidence on the record is to be

thrown over-board.”
8. Learned counsel for the appellant has
also relied upon judgment of Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan delivered in the
case of “Rehmatullah Vs. Muhammad Iqbal &
others” reported as 2006 SCMR 1517 and
contended that both the brothers i.e. PW-03
and PW-04 stood as spectators and had not

tried to save their brother or catch the
13

appellant after commission of the offence
and, therefore, their conduct should be
dubbed as unnatural one. In this respect it is
important to be noted that there had not been
an enmity earlier and the complainant party
may not be expecting such a reaction from
the appellant. It is mentioned in first report of
the occurrence that the moment the deceased
(then alive) went towards the appellant, he
was fired at. The occurrence had taken place
all of a sudden where both the witnesses
stated that they had attended to their
deceased brother immediately after the
occurrence. This was very much natural that
they would have rushed towards their brother
so as to save him. There were also maize
crops in the vicinity as apparent from the
evidence, therefore, the appellant would not
have faced much difficulty in disappearing
from the spot of occurrence. In the given
circumstances of this case, we do not find any
unnatural conduct, being displayed by any of
the eyewitnesses.

9. Learned counsel for the appellant has

also taken a stance that the appellant was
14

alleged to have been fired with a 30-bore
pistol, and the fact that the bullet had
remained stuck inside the body of deceased,
could not be sufficiently explained because
30-bore pistol was supposed to be a powerful
weapon and the bullet should have gone
through and through. The doctor in his
examination in chief stated that despite efforts
he could not extract the bullet. It is not clear
which organs the bullet had touched inside
body of the deceased besides his main artery.
Stucking of the bullet might be because of its
confrontation with the bone or because of
substandard ammunition used in making of
the bullet. No hard and fast rule can be laid in
this regard, moreso, when the weapon and
ammunitions (used) are locally manufactured
for which there are no settled standards. The
phenomena of bullet going through and
through depends on lot of factors which varies
from case to case.

10. Prosecution has also been relying on
recovery of pistol and its matching report with
the empty recovered at the spot but in that

respect it is important to be noted that the
15

pistol had not been recovered from or on
pointation of the appellant rather same had
been shown recovered from house of the
appellant on 29.09.2015 while he had been
arrested on 24.08.2016. After his arrest,
identification memo has been prepared by the
Investigating Officer, showing that he had
identified the pistol to be his own but marginal
witness to the recovery memo namely, Gul
Faraz while appearing in the witness box as
PW-12 has stated that when the appellant
was being confronted with the pistol same
had not been in sealed form. Such evidence
of recovery from a house which could not be
proved to have been in exclusive possession
of the appellant cannot, therefore, be called to
be believable. It is, however, important to be
noted that it was a corroboratory piece of
evidence and case of the prosecution which
was otherwise based upon direct testimony of
two eyewitnesses was found well established.
Testimony of both the eyewitnesses were
confidence inspiring, consistent and coherent.
Intrinsic worth of the direct evidence of

prosecution was sufficient for bringing home
16

guilt of the appellant. Besides, there were
ample corroborations from medical evidence
and the factum of absconsion. After
commission of the offence appellant had gone
in absconsion. He could not deny knowledge
of the occurrence because the deceased was
his near relative. Prosecution has also
examined Fayaz-ud-Din (PW-06) who has
stated that he had obtained warrant under
Section 204 Cr.P.C and searched appellant in
the locality but he could not be found
whereafter the warrant was_ returned
unexecuted. He had also been entrusted with
the Proclamation under Section 87 Cr.P.C.
He stated that he had affixed copies of the
Proclamation on the outer door of appellant’s
house and notice board of the court while
third copy thereof had been returned to
Investigating Officer of the case with his
report (Ex.PW-6/2A). It was on 26.08.2016
after almost a year of the occurrence that the
appellant could be arrested by the local
police. Absconsion by itself is not sufficient to
declare a person offender but such evidence

may be used for the purpose of corroborating
17

other evidence of the prosecution. Reliance in
this respect may be placed on the judgment
of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan
delivered in the case of “Riaz Hussain Vs.
The State” reported as 2001 SCMR 177.

11. In light of what has been discussed
above, prosecution has been able to prove
case against the appellant beyond reasonable
doubt. The learned trial court has rightly found
him guilty for commission of the offence. His
conviction recorded by the learned trial court
under Section 302 (b) PPC was, therefore,
found justified on the basis of evidence
present before the court below, warranting no
interference by this court. Resultantly, the
instant appeal was, therefore, found divested
of any merit and same _ is_ accordingly
dismissed.

12. So far as Cr.Revision No. 17-A/2019
filed by complainant for enhancement of
sentence of appellant is concerned, it is
observed that while awarding life
imprisonment, the learned trial court has
stated that the occurrence had not been

committed in a pre-planned manner and that
18

it had happened all of a sudden. Findings of
the learned trial court as well as the ensuing
decision was also found by us to be
appropriate in the given circumstances. The
occurrence had no doubt happened all of a
sudden where the appellant had fired a single
fire shot and that also when the deceased
had approached him as per story narrated in
the FIR. In such circumstances, award of
alternate punishment of life imprisonment was
not found inappropriate. Learned counsel for
the complainant was heard, but he could not
convince us on revisiting the sentence
already awarded to the convict. The criminal
revision was also found meritless and same is
accordingly dismissed.
