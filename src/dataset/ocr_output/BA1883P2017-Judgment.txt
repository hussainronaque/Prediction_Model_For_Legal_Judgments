JUDGMENT.

Cr.Misc:B.A No.1883-P/2017
Date of hearing...... 08.09.2017

Azam Khan Vs State & another.

petitioner(s) by: Mr. Muhammad Tariq Javed, Advocate.
State by: Mr. Muhammad Sohail, AAG.

Complainant by:- Mr. Asad Jan Durrani, Advocate.

IJAZ ANWAR, J:- Petitioner Azam Khan seeks post arrest
bail in case FIR No.844 dated 28.07.2017 registered u/s 336 .
PPC/39 Child Protection Act at Police Station Chamkani,
Peshawar.

2. Earlier bail petition of accused/petitioner was refused by
the learned Additional Sessions Judge-XIV, Peshawar vide order
dated 09.08.2017.

3. Brief facts as per contents of FIR are that the complainant
Noor Khan through Mad No.i0 dated 24.07.2017 appeared in
Chowki Shah Pur and reported the matter through written
application that his son Azlan Shah is student of Iqra Rozat-ul-
Atfal Trust Dalazak Road, Peshawar and doing Hifaz. On the day of

occurrence his teacher namely Azam Khan has slapped him on right
So"

side of face and due to which blood started oozing from his right
ear. Now the child is feeling severe pain in his ear and cannot hear
anything. Hence this FIR.
4. Arguments heard and record perused.
5. Perusal of the record reveals that there are some
contradiction about the timing of medico legal report, similarly,
initially the petitioner/accused was charged under Section 337-A
(5) PPC, that was changed subsequently and replaced with section
336 PPC/39-Child Protection Act, besides the statement of the
witnesses examined by the police makes the case of the accused as
one of further inquiry. Moreover, detail scrutiny of the available
record is neither advisable nor warranted at this stage, lest it would
prejudice the case of either party.
6. The observation recorded above, shall have no bearing
on the merit of the case and it will be decided on its own
independent evidence. In PLD 2009 Lahore-312 the larger bench
of the Lahore High Court held that:-
“In view of what has been discussed above we have
entertained no manner of doubt that in all cases of hurt
provided for in Chapter XVI of the Pakistan Penal
Code, 1860 the normal punishment to be awarded to
an offender is payment of Arsh or Daman and the
optional additional punishment of imprisonment as
Ta’zir provided for the relevant offence can be
awarded to an offender only where the offender “is a
previous convict, habitual or hardened, desperate or

dangerous criminal or the offence has been committed
by him in the name or on the pretext of honour” and in
the case of such an offender the sentence of
imprisonment as Tazir is not to be less than one-third
of the maximum imprisonment provided for the hurt
caused. This, to us, is the only interpretation of the
provisions of subsection (2) of section 337-N, P.P.C.
as they stand today and if the legislature intends
otherwise then it may suitably and appropriately
amend the relevant provisions”.
7, Thus, in view of the above, the accused/petitioner has
made out a case for the grant of bail provided he furnishes bail
bonds to the tune of Rs.200,000/- (rupees two lac), with two
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned
Illaqa Judicial Magistrate, concerned, who shall ensure that the
sureties are local, reliable and men of means.
8. Before parting with judgment, this Court observe that it
is a sensitive issue and relates to the children (future of this nation),
hence, it is necessary to give an awakening call.to those who
matters in such cases, firstly will give an outlook of the matter.
Corporal Punishment in school is defined in Wikipedia as, “school
corporal punishment refer to cause deliberate pain or discomfort in
response to undesired behaviour by students in schools and is a
physical punishment intended to cause physical, pain on a person. It
is most often used where there is substantial disparity of power
between punisher and punished”.

9. . Though section 89 PPC gave protection to such

punishments, it is reproduced for convenience:-
Vo B.

10.
International and Regional Human Rights treaties require States to
prohibit corporal punishment of children in all settings of their lives.
Corporal punishment is a violation of their rights to respect for their

human dignity and physical integrity, allowing such punishment is

Section 89. Act done in good faith for benefit
of child or insane person, by or by consent of
guardian._ Nothing which is done in good faith for
the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or
of unsound mind by or by consent either express or
implied, of the guardian or other person having
lawful charge of that person, is an offence by reason
of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the
doer to cause or be known by the doer to be likely to
cause to that person.

Provided: First. That this exception shall not
extend to the intentional causing of death, or to the
attempting to cause death;

Secondly. That this exception shall not extend
to the doing of anything which person doing it knows
to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than
the preventing of death or grievous hurt or the curing
of any grievous disease or infirmity;

Thirdly. That this exception shall not extend to
the voluntary causing of grievous hurt or to the curing
of any grievous disease or infirmity;

Fourthly. That this exception shall not extend to
the abetment of any offence, to the committing of
which offence it would not extend.

The UN Convention on the rights of the child and other

against rights of the children to equal protection under the law.

11.

Recent studies show that about (52) States have prohibited

all corporal punishment of children, including in the family home.
\ aS,

12. Pakistan being part of this global village has also expressed
its commitment of prohibiting corporal punishment of children, including
at home, at the meeting of the South Asia Forum in 2006. In July, 2014, °
the Government of Pakistan has re-affirmed its commitment to Law
Reforms in the context of launching a National Campaign against
Corporal Punishment. The Government of Sindh took precedence and
passed law to ban corporal punishment for children, called as the Sindh
Prohibition of Corporal Punishment Act, 2017 promulgated on
22.3.2017; similarly the Prohibition of Corporal Punishment Act, 2017
prohibits corporal punishment to children in Islamabad Capital Territory.
13. This Court is oblivious of the fact that corporal punishment
in schools and work place is a routine. This treatment metted out to the
children/student in the name of reformation/education is in fact violating
their dignity, self respect and eliminating their sense of forbearance. This
is infact one of the reasons of desperation and intolerance in our society,
as in this way, these children learn to enforce their opinion through
violence.

14. We have in this province, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child
Protection and Welfare Act, 2010, that caters with the care, maintenance,

welfare, training, education, rehabilitation and integration of children at

risk in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, however, till date, we have no law on

banning Corporal Punishments at School etc. Off and on cases of corporal

punishment in schools is reported and come up before the Courts,
however, in the absence of any special law banning such punishment in
schools; it carries on and continues as a permissible practice. This Court
would thus be failing in its duty to protect the fundamental rights of
children, as such, the Registrar of this Court is directed to send the copies
of this judgment to the Chief Secretary, and Secretary to Government of

KPK, Elementary and Secondary Education, Peshawar to look into the

‘matter and help the future of this nation by recommending appropriate

legislation banning corporal punishments in schools.

These are the reasons of my short order of even date.

Announced.
