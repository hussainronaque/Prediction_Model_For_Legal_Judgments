each.
Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C. has been
extended to the appellants, however, the substantive

2. Feeling aggrieved, the appellants have questioned
their conviction and sentences through the instant Jail
Criminal Appeal, while the learned trial Court has sent
Murder Reference No.6 of 2017, for confirmation of
death sentence of the convicts.

3. As both the matters are the outcome of one and
the same judgment of the learned trial Court, therefore,
we propose to decide and answer the same through this
single judgment.

4. The prosecution’s case as per First Information
report (FIR) ExhPA is that on 09.11.2013 one
Musharraf, driver of taxi motorcar bearing Registration
No.RT.699-Islamabad, went missing along with his taxi
and qua his missing, one Sangeen Khan, owner of the
taxi made report in Police Station West Cantt, Peshawar,

which was incorporated in daily diary No.18 dated
3

11.11.2013. Upon his report, inquiry under section
156 (3) Cr.P.C. was initiated during which Gulzar,
brother of taxi driver Musharraf, recorded statement
under section 161 Cr.P.C. wherein he charged unknown
culprit(s) for abduction/kidnapping of Musharraf along
with taxi for ransom. According to Sangeen Khan, as per
mobile cell phone data his driver Mushaff was located
going towards Tall City, but thereafter his cell phone was
found switched off. He suspected illegal confinement of
Musharraf in Tall City District Hangu. Initially, case FIR
No.568 dated 05.12.2013 under section 365-A PPC was
registered in Police Station West Cantt Peshawar against
unknown culprit(s). During investigation, Azmat Ullah
and Hukman Shah, the appellants, were arrested along
with co-accused Sher Zaman and Muhammad Saeed on
07.12.2013 and 11.12.2013 by Toheed Inspector. On the
pointation of appellants Azmat Ullah and Hukman Shah,
decomposed dead body of abductee Musharraf was
recovered from a dry well of Poultry Farm of appellant
Azmat Ullah in presence of doctor and Mr. Muhammad
Mushtaq Judicial Magistrate-II, Hangu.

5. At the time of recovery of dead body of Musharraf
deceased, deadbody of one Fazal-ur-Rehman, deceased
of the present case, was also recovered by the police on
the pointation of the appellants from the same Well

inside Poultry Farm of appellant Azmat Ullah. Raja
Mehmood Sultan complainant (PW.7), present at the spot
reported to Said Khan DSP (PW.9) to the effect that
Fazl-ur-Rehman deceased was his driver and was plying
motorcar bearing registration No.LRQ.4773 as a taxi
from Islamabad Airport; that on 02.11.2013 Taxi of the
deceased was hired by a young man from Islamabad to
Tall Hangu in his presence and when he did not return,
his son Jafar reported about his missing in Police Post
Islamabad Airport; that he along with relatives of the
deceased was in search of Fazal-ur-Rehman for the last
so many days when in the meantime that he learnt about
availability of a human dead body in a Well situated in
the limits of Darsamand, therefore, he along with
relatives of the deceased proceeded to Darsamand where
the police on the pointation of the appellants, recovered
dead body of Fazl-ur-Rehman deceased which was
decomposed. Similarly, the police also recovered another
dead body which was identified to be that of taxi driver
Musharraf. He identified appellant Hukman Shah at the
spot to be the person who had hired taxi of Fazl-ur-
Rehman deceased in his presence from Islamabad Airport
to Tall. He charged both the appellants for commission of
the offence. Ali the proceedings were conducted at the
spot in presence of Illaqa Judicial Magistrate and
Medical Officer. Report of complainant Raja Mehmood

Sultan was recorded in the shape of Murasila on the basis
of which FIR No.581 dated 11.12.2013 under sections
302, 386, 392, 412 and 34 PPC was registered against the
appellants at Police Station Doaba Hangu. The dead body
of Musharraf deceased, was taken into possession by the
police of Police Station West Cantt Peshawar in case FIR
No.568 (ibid).

6. Dr. Qasim Gul (PW.5), conducted autopsy on the
dead body of Fazl-ur-Rehman deceased and found the

1. Entry wound on right posterior occipital
region about 2x2 cm, exit wound at right eye
about 3x4 cm.

Head hair absent clean shaved, mustache

due to perforated injury on his skull and
brain due to firearm injury.

Probable time between injury and
death: 10-30 minutes approximately and
between death and postmortem: 20 to 30
days approximately.

7. Investigation of the case was entrusted to Habib

Ullah Inspector (PW.6), who after registration of the FIR
6

proceeded to the spot and prepared site plan Exh.PB on
the pointation of complainant in presence of IIlaqa
Judicial Magistrate and Medical Officer, recorded
statements of the PWs under section 161 Cr.P.C., draw
pictures of the spot which are Exh.PW.6/1, placed on file
postmortem report of the deceased. As the appellants
were already arrested in case FIR No.568 (supra),
therefore, he arrested them from Peshawar Jail in the
present case vide arrest card Exh.PW.6/3 and shifted
them from Peshawar to Hangu vide application
Exh.PW.6/4. On 19.12.2013, he obtained physical
remand of the appellant from learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate. On 20.12.2013, he prepared sketch
Exh.PW.6/6 of the place where motorcar of the deceased
was sold on the pointation of the appellants which is
Exh.PW.3/1. On 23.12.2013 he produced the appellants
before the learned Judicial Magistrate, where they
recorded their confessional statements. He also initiated
proceedings under sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. against
absconding co-accused Riaz to whom taxi motorcar of
the deceased was sold, recorded statement of the Seizing
Officer who recovered 30 bore pistol along with 05 live
rounds of the same bore from appellant and placed on file
FSL report Exh.PW.6/11. On completion of investigation
he handed over case file to SHO, who submitted challan

against the appellants before the learned trial Court.
8. On receipt of challan by the learned trial Court, the
appellants were summoned and formally charge sheeted
to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To
prove its case, the prosecution examined as many as
twelve witnesses. After closure of the prosecution’s
evidence, statements of the appellants were recorded
under section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein they denied the
prosecution’s allegation and professed their innocence.
They, however, declined to be examined on oath under
section 340(2) Cr.P.C. or to produce evidence in defence,
On conclusion of trial, the learned trial court, after
hearing both the sides, convicted and sentenced the
appellants as mentioned in the initial paragraph of the
judgment, hence, this appeal and Murder Reference.

9. We have heard the exhaustive arguments of
learned counsel for the parties and perused the record and

evidence with their valuable assistance.

10. Admittedly, there is no ocular account in the
present case and entire prosecution’s case is built on the
circumstantial evidence in the shape of recovery of the
dead body of Fazal-ur-Rehman deceased from a Well
situated in Poultry Farm of appellant Azmat Ullah on the
disclosure/pointation of the appellants, confessional
statements of the appellants and evidence of the last seen

of the deceased in the company of appellant Hukman
Shah, furnished by complainant Raja Muhammad Sultan
(PW.12), owner of taxi motorcar bearing Registration
No.4773-Lahore. It may be noted that all judicial
evidence is either direct or circumstantial. By direct
evidence is meant when the principal fact is attested
directly by witnesses, things or documents. To all other
forms, the term circumstantial evidence is applied. It is
well settled principle of law that conviction can be
recorded even in case carrying death sentence on the
basis of circumstantial evidence if it excludes all
hypothesis of innocence of accused. The prosecution is
duty bound to prove every circumstance independently
as is so connected with other circumstances which
constitutes an unbroken chain that leads to no other
inference but to the guilt of accused. Reliance can be
placed on the case of Mohammad Basharat y. Saqib
Shah (2013 P.Cr.L.J 619), wherein it was held as
under:-
“The superior Courts while appreciating the

circumstantial evidence which is always

considered to be a weak type of evidence, have

held that there is no rule of law or practice to
prevent a Court from sentencing an accused
person to death merely on the circumstantial
evidence provided that in a case resting on a
circumstantial evidence, no link in the chain
should be missing and _all the circumstances
must lead_to the guilt of the accused. The

circumstantial evidence can only form basis for
Cy

conviction when it is incompatible with the
innocence of accused or the guilt of any other
person and in no manner be incapable of
explaining upon any reasonable hypotheses
except that of the guilt of accused. Every link
in circumstantial evidence should be proved by
cogent evidence and if not then no conviction
could be maintained or awarded to an
accused."

The Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled, Munawar
Hussain v. Imran Waseem (2013 SCMR 374), has
observed as under:-

"Even, death penalty can also be awarded on

circumstantial evidence but it should be

beyond any shadow of doubt. The chain of

facts be such that reasonable inference can be

drawn that accused has committed the offence.
All the facts established should be consistent
only with the hypotheses of guilt of the
accused. If any link is missing that will destroy
the whole links of such evidence and all the
links of the circumstances must lead to the
guilt of the accused. It is not a such type of
evidence, but it is sufficiency and quality
which matters. The circumstantial evidence
should be so interconnected that it forms such a
continuous chain that its one end touches the
dead body and the other the neck of accused
thereby excluding all hypothesis of his

innocence."

11. Taking the case in hand at the touch stones of the
principles enumerated in the judgments (supra), first we
are taking for discussion confessional statements of the
appellants so as to determine whether these are voluntary

and free from coercion, torture and inducement and to
-

10

what extent these finds corroboration from other
independent circumstances. For the sake of convenience
and ready reference, we deem it appropriate to reproduce
confessional statements of appellants below:-

Hukman Shah

“Stated that, during those days I was residing in

Islamabad. On telephone information of Azmat
Ullah (co-appellant), I booked a taxi motorcar on
special trip from Islamabad to Doaba Hangu and
when we reached Doaba, I contacted Azmat Ullah,
who came out from his house. We took the taxi
driver along with taxi to Poultry Farm situated in
front of the house of Azmat ullah and then its
driver inside the Poultry Farm, where we tried to
tie him so as to snatch key of the taxi from him, but
he being a healthy man was resisting, therefore,
Azmat Ullah fired at him two shots, as a result, he
got hit and died on the spot. We then threw his
dead body in a Well inside the Poultry Farm and
put stones and mud over in the Well. We sold the
taxi motorcar to one Riaz of Darsamand in lieu of
sale consideration of Rs.1,90,000/-, out of which he
paid us Rs.90,000/- in cash while the remaining sale
consideration was agreed to be paid by him within
two week; after 9/10 days of the aforesaid incident,
I went to Peshawar Airport wherefrom a booked
another taxi motorcar to Darsamand Doaba. On
our arrival to Doaba, I contacted Azmatullah who

was already present in his Poultry Farm. We
11

parked the taxi motorcar in front of the Poultry
Farm and took the driver inside the Farm where
Azmat Ullah committed his murder with pistol and
thereafter we threw his dead body inside the Well
of Poultry Farm. From the pocket of the deceased
we recovered Rs.18000/- in cash, one mobile cell
phone, CNIC and driving license. The CNIC and
driving license were burnt by Azmat Ullah while
cash amount was divided by us whereas the mobile
cell phone of the deceased was kept by me. We also
sold taxi motorcar of the second deceased to said
Riaz in lieu of sale consideration of Rs.3,70,000/-
which amount was also divided by us. I then
proceeded to Islamabad. ”

Azmat Ullah

“Stated that Hukman Shah was residing in
Islamabad. I contacted and told him to book a taxi
motorcar from Islamabad Airport so as to commit
murder of the taxi driver and sell his motorcar.
Hukman Shah brought a taxi motorcar to Doaba
and contacted me. We took the taxi in front of
Poultry Farm and took its driver inside the Poultry
Farm. We tried to snatch key from the driver but
he was not willing, therefore, I opened fire at him,
as a result, he got hit and died on the spot. We
threw his dead body in a Well inside the poultry
Farm and sold his motorcar to one Riaz in lieu of
sale consideration of Rs.1,90,000/-, out of which he
paid Rs.90,000/- in cash at the spot while the

remaining sale consideration was agreed to be paid
12

by him after 10/11 days; that from pocket of the
deceased we recovered rupees one thousand in cash
and mobile cell phone. I kept the mobile with
myself while handed over rupees one thousand to
Hukman Shah. Thereafter I sent Hukman Shah to
Peshawar Airport where he hired another taxi
motorcar and brought to Doaba. We also took the
said taxi motorcar along with its driver to Poultry
Farm where I committed murder of the driver and
threw his dead body in the same Well. We sold his
taxi motorcar to said Riaz in lieu of sale
consideration of Rs.3,70,000/- which amount was
paid by him and divided by us. Thereafter Hukman
Shah went to Islamabad. I confess my guilt of
committing murder of two taxi drivers.”

12. Perusal of confessional statements of the
appellants would reveal that both are in line with each
other on the points as to how car of driver Fazl-ur-Rehman
deceased was booked by Hukman Shah appellant on the
direction of appellant Azmat Ullah from Islamabad
Airport and taken to Doaba Hangu where he was done to
death inside Poultry Farm of appellant Azmat Ullah and
his dead body was thrown by both the appellants in a dry
Well and his taxi motorcar was sold to absconding
co-accused Riaz. From confessional statements of the
appellants it is also manifest that appellant Hukman Shah
has played the role of taking the deceased from

Islamabad Airport on special trip to Doaba so as to
13

snatch motorcar from him and on resistance of the
deceased, his murder was committed by appellant Azmat
Ullah. No doubt, appellant Hukman Shah has not made
any firing at the deceased, however, in throwing dead
body of the deceased in a Well and selling his taxi
motorcar followed by distribution of the sale
consideration, both the appellants have played equal role.
13. The confessional statements of the appellants is
corroborated by the testimony of Said Khan DSP (PW.9),
who deposed that he along with other police officials,
Ilaqa Judicial Magistrate, doctor and inhabitants of the
locality went to the place known as Zer Khawari
Darsamand and on the disclosure/pointation of the
appellants recovered two human dead bodies from a well
located inside Poultry Farm owned by appellant Azmat
ullah; that out of the two deceased, one was identified to
be that of Musharraf deceased of case FIR No.568 of
2013 Police Station Gharbi Peshawar, while another was
identified by complainant and relatives to be that of
Fazal-ur-Rehman deceased of the present case.
Complainant present at the spot identified appellant
Hukman Shah to be the person who had hired taxi
motorcar of the deceased from Islamabad to Thall. On
the report of complainant Mursila Exh.,PW.9/1 was
drafted on the basis of which FIR Exh.PA was registered

against the appellants. He prepared pointation memo
14

Exh.PW.2/1, which was duly certified by the Judicial
Magistrate on the spot. The testimony of Muhammad
Mushtaq Khan Judicial Magistrate (PW.11) is consistent
with testimony of Said Khan DSP (PW.9) with regard to
recovery of dead body of the deceased from a dry Well
inside Poultry Farm of Azmat Ullah appellant, on the
‘pointation of the appellants. He deposed that on the
written request of local police, he was directed by the
learned Sessions Judge Hangu to accompany the police
for discovery of body of the deceased; that he along with
local police, appellants, doctor and his staff proceeded to
the spot situated in village Darsamand; that as per
instructions of the appellants they reached the spot i.e.
Poultry Farm where on their pointation two dead bodies
were recovered from a dry Well; that in this regard SHO
Police Station Doaba prepared pointation/discovery
memo which is Exh.PW.2/1 and the same was certified
by him.

14. The testimony of Raja Mohammad Sultan
complainant (PW.12), also corroborates statements of the
above named two PWs. He deposed that during those
days he was running the business of Rent A-Car in
Islamabad; that on 02.11.2013 at about 09.00 AM one of
the accused (at this stage he pointed towards Hukman
Shah appellant present in the trial court), came to him

and asked for a taxi car on a pretext that he has been
15

arrived from Dubai and due to demise of his father he has
to rush to Darsamand Hangu; that he settled rent of the
taxi car as Rs.8000/- and directed his driver Fazal-ur-
Rehman deceased to accompany appellant Hukman Shah
to Doaba in a motorcar bearing registration No.4773
Lahore; that despite lapse of about 1 or 2 months, his
driver did not return; that they were searching for him,
during which course from mobile phone data of Fazl-ur-
Rehman deceased his last location was traced in
Darsamand Hangu; that on 11.12.2013, the local police
of Police Station Doaba informed him to visit Darsamand
Hangu, upon which he along with his son Raja Nadeem
as well as relatives of the deceased came to Darsamand;
that on the pointation of the appellants dead bodies of
two persons were recovered from a dry Well situated in
Poultry Farm of appellant Azmat Ullah; that out of the
two deceased, one was identified by him and relatives of
the deceased to be that of driver Fazal-ur-Rehman
deceased; that in respect of recovery of the dead body of
the deceased his statement was recorded; that he also
signed pointation memo Exh.PW.9/1 in presence of the
doctor, the local police and the Judicial Magistrate; that
after completion of the proceedings on the spot, we took
the dead body of the deceased Fazl-ur-Rehma deceased
to village. He charged both the appellants for murder of

the deceased.
16

15. The above named material witnesses of the
recovery of the dead body of the deceased on the
discovery of the appellants have been cross-examined at
length by the defence but nothing of the sort that the
police was already in the knowledge of the place of the
recovery of the dead body could be extracted from them.

16. Another circumstantial piece of evidence is the
confessional statements of the appellants against each
other. Under Article 43 QSO consideration of proved
confession affecting person making it and others jointly
under trial for the same offence, such confession can be
used against the accused making it and against
co-accused as circumstantial evidence. At this juncture
Article 43 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 is
reproduced below:-

“43. Consideration of proved confession
affecting person making it and others jointly

under_trial_for_same_offence:- When more

persons than one are being tried joinly for the

same offence, and a confession made by one of

such persons is proved.

(a) Such confessional shall be proof
against the person; making it; and

(b) The court may take into
consideration such confession as
circumstantial evidence against such
other person.

Ilustrations:

(a) A and B are jointly tried for the murder of C. It is
proved that A said, “B and I murdered C”. The
court may consider the effect of this confession
against B.
17

(b) A is on his trial for the murder of C. There is
evidence to show that C was murdered by A and
B, and that B said “A and I murdered C”.
This statement may not be taken into
consideration by the Court against A as B is not
being jointly tried,

Perusal of Article 43 of the Order (ibid), reveals that
confession of an accused can be used against him as well
as against co-accused being jointly tried for the same
offence. In the instant case, both the appellants have been
tried jointly and they have made confession which has
been proved by the prosecution through confidence
inspiring evidence corroborated by other reliable and
cogent evidence. Thus we are firm in our view that
confessional statements of the appellants can be used
against each one of them as a circumstantial piece of
evidence.

17. Another piece of circumstantial piece of evidence
is the testimony of Raja Mehmood Sultan complainant
(PW.12), who has furnished evidence of last seen of the
deceased in company of appellant Hukman Shah. He
while appearing before the learned trial court in the
witness box has deposed that during those days he was
running a business of Rent A-Car business and Fazl-ur-
Rehman deceased was his driver; that on 02.11.2013 at
about 09.00 AM one of the accused, this time (he pointed
towards appellant Hukman Shah present in the trial
court) came and hired his taxi motorcar against rent of

Rs.8000/- from Islamabad to Doaba on a pretext that he
18

has arrived from Dubai and due to demise of his father he
has to rush to Doaba Hangu; that he directed his driver
Fazl-ur-Rehman deceased to take him in a Taxi motorcar
bearing Registration No.4773, whereafter his driver
along with taxi disappeared. Argument of learned
counsel for the appellants that no identification parade of
the appellants has been conducted is unpersuasive
because at the time of recovery of the dead body of the
deceased on the pointation of the appellants, the
complainant identified appellant Hukman Shah at the
spot by stating that he was the person who hired taxi
motorcar of the deceased from Islamabad Airport to
Doaba and he has duly mentioned this fact in the FIR. By
considering the above fact we are of the view that
holding of identification parade was not the legal
requirement in the circumstances of the case. Record
shows that the deceased went missing on 02.11.2013
while his dead body was recovered on 11.12.2013 i.e.
after one month and nine days. The Téstimony of
Dr. Qasim Gul (PW.5), who has conducted autopsy on
the dead body of the deceased supports the testimony of
complainant and confessional statements of the
appellants as on examination he found the dead body of
the deceased decomposed and one entry wound on his
right posterior occipital region about 2x2 cm having

corresponding exit about 3x4 cm. According to statement
19

of the Medical Officer, whole body of the deceased was
decomposed and swollen with foul smelling. Tip of his
nose was falien and his fingers were partially damaged.
He has opined probable time between death and
postmortem as 20 to 30 days approximately which
support the testimony of complainant keeping in view the
date of missing of the deceased. Undoubtedly, "last seen
evidence" is an important link in the chain of
circumstances that would point towards the guilt of the
accused with some certainty. The "last seen evidence
theory” holds the courts to shift the burden of proof to the
accused and the accused to offer a reasonable explanation
as to the cause of death of the deceased. It is well settled
that it is not prudent to base conviction of an accused
solely on "last seen evidence". "Last seen evidence"
should be applied taking into consideration case of the
prosecution in its entirety and keeping in mind the
circumstances that precede and follow the point of being
so last seen. If a person is last seen with the accused, the
accused must offer an explanation as to how and when he
parted company with the deceased. He must furnish an
explanation which appears to the court to be probable and
satisfactory. If he does so he must be held to have
discharged his burden but if he fails to offer an
explanation on the basis of facts within his special

knowledge, he fails to discharge the burden cast upon
20

him. In a case resting on circumstantial evidence if the
accused fails to offer a reasonable explanation in
discharge of the burden placed on him, that itself
provides an additional link in the chain of circumstances
proved against him. It may not be out of context to
mention here that the “Last seen theory” does not entirely
shift the burden of proof in a criminal trial upon the
accused, which is always upon the prosecution, however,
it lays down the rule that when the accused does not
throw any light upon facts which are specially within his
knowledge and which could not support any theory or
hypothesis compatible with his innocence, the court can
consider his failure to adduce any explanation, as an
additional link which completes the chain. In this regard
Article 122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984
(“Order 1984), is of worth perusal, according to which
when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any
person the burden of proving that fact is upon him. For
the sake of convenience Article 122 of the Order, 1984 is
reproduced below:-

“122, Burden of proving fact especially
within knowledge:- When any fact is especially
within the knowledge of any person the burden

of proving that fact is upon him.”

Article 122 is an exception to Article 117 Illustration (a)

which lays down the general rule that in a criminal case
21

the burden of proof is on the prosecution. Article 122 is
certainly not intended to relieve the prosecution from its
duty, however, it is designed to meet certain exceptional
cases in which it would be impossible or at any rate
disproportionately difficult for the prosecution to
establish facts which are “especially” within the
knowledge of the accused and which he could prove
without difficulty or inconvenience. The word
“especially” stress that it means facts that are pre-
eminently or exceptionally within the knowledge of the
accused. In the instant case, the deceased was last seen in
the company of appellant Hukman Shah, who has not
furnished any explanation so as to point towards his
innocence, rather the explanation furnished by him in his
confessional statement the deceased was taken to Poultry
Farm of Azmat Ullah appellant where he was done to
death and his taxi motorcar was snatched.

18. The above discussed circumstantial pieces of
evidence make an unbroken chain that its one end
touches the dead body of the deceased and another neck
of the appellants. No doubt, the appellants have retracted
from their confessional statements but it is settled law
that conviction can be recorded on the basis of retracted
judicial confession, if the same is proved voluntary, true
and corroborated by other strong circumstances of the

case. Mere denial of accused from confessional
22

statement, in statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. that the
same was involuntary or that he has not made any such

statement would not make his confessional statement

inadmissible. In case titled, “Manjeet_Singh vs the
State” (PLD 2006 Supreme Court 30), it has been held

by the Hon’ble Supreme Court that retracted confession
either judicial or extra judicial, if found truthful and
confidence inspiring as well as qualified the test of
voluntariness can be used for conviction without looking
for any other sort of corroboration. The Hon’ble Apex
court in the judgment (supra) has further observed that no
tule of criminal administration of justice existed to the
effect that the court having found the retracted confession
voluntary and true must look for the corroboration and
that in absence of corroborative evidence, conviction
cannot be maintained. Retraction of a judicial or extra
judicial confession itself is not an infirmity to be
considered sufficient to withhold the conviction because
evidentiary value of a confession is not to be diminished
by the mere fact that it was retracted by the maker at the
trial. Even an independent corroboration thereof from
other sources direct or circumstantial, cannot be insisted
in every case as a mandatory rule, rather the rule of
corroboration is applied by way of abundant caution and

is a case depending entirely on the confessional statement
23

of a person or only on the circumstantial evidence, and
this rule is applied more cautiously.

19. Muhammad Mushtaq Khan, learned Judicial
Magistrate (PW.11), who has recorded confessional
statements of the appellants has deposed that on
23.12.2013, the appellants were produced before him for
recording their confessional statements; that he after
observing all legal and codel formalities and putting all
relevant and necessary questions to the appellants, one by
one, recorded their confessional statements under his
own hand writing. He exhibited confessional statements
of the appellants as Exh.PW.11/5 and Exh.PW.11/6. The
learned Judicial Magistrate has been subjected to lengthy
cross-examination by the defence but nothing of the sort
that the confessional statements of the appellants were
involuntary and result of torture, coercion or inducement
could be extracted from him.

20. In view of what has been discussed above, we are
firm in our view to hold that confessional statements of
the appellants are voluntary and true as well as free from
any force and inducement and are corroborated by
circumstantial and medical evidence discussed above.

21. Yet there is another important aspect which further
strengthens the prosecution’s case. For murder of the
second deceased, namely, Musharraf, was taken from

Peshawar Airport by appellant Hukman Shah and was
24

done to death in the way as the deceased of the present
case was done to death, separate case vide FIR No.568
dated 05.12.2013, under section 365-A, 302, 382 PPC
and 7 ATA 1997 was registered against the appellants in
Police Station West Cantt (Gharbi) Peshawar. The
appellants after facing regular trial, were convicted and
sentenced vide judgment dated 21.03.2015, against which
the appellants preferred Cr.A. No.204-P of 2015, before
this court but the same was dismissed vide judgment
dated 08.11.2017. From the facts and circumstances of
both the cases it is proved that appellants are habitual of
abducting/kidnapping taxi drivers from different
Airports, thereafter committing their murder and selling
their taxi motorcars.

22. On reappraisal of the prosecution’s evidence, we
have reached to an irresistible conclusion that the
prosecution has proved the guilt of appellants under
section 302(b), 386, 392 PPC. So far as conviction of the
appellants under section 412 is concerned, it pertains to
dishonestly receiving property stolen in the commission
of a dacoity, therefore, this section as per available
evidence has relevancy with the role of absconding
co-accused Riaz, to whom the taxi of the deceased was
allegedly sold by the appellant. The learned trial court
has rightly held appellants guilty of offences under

section 302, 386 and 392 PPC, however, has erred in law
25

which recording their conviction and sentence under
section 412 PPC. Besides, sentence of death awarded by
the learned trial court to appellant Hukman Shah also
requires serious consideration. From the entire
prosecution’s evidence as well as confessional statements
of the appellants it is proved that it was appellant Azmat
Ullah who fired at the deceased, as a result, he got hit and
died on the spot. No doubt, appellant Hukman Shah has
not fired at the deceased; however, the prosecution has
proved his role of abetment in the commission of offence
as he was the person who brought the deceased from
Islamabad Airport to Doaba Darsamand Hangu on a
pretext, where he was done to death by Azmat Ullah
appellant, however, his dead body and taxi motorcar
were disposed of by both the appellants. In this view of
the matter, death sentence of appellant Hukman Shah
under section 302(b) PPC is altered to of rigorous
imprisonment for life would meet the ends of justice.

23. For what has been discussed above, this appeal is
disposed of in the terms that conviction and sentences of
appellant Azmat Ullah under section 302(b), 386 and 392
PPC are maintained. Conviction and sentences of
appellant Hukman Shah under section 302(b), 386 and
392 PPC are also maintained, however, his sentence of

death under section 302(b) PPC is altered from death to
26

rigorous imprisonment for life. Both the appellants are
acquitted under section 412 PPC,

24. Another legal point is that the learned trial court
while recording conviction and sentence of the appellants
has not adhere to the mandatory provisions of section
544-A Cr.P.C. as no compensation has been ordered by it
to be paid by the appellants to legal heirs of the deceased,
which was the mandatory requirement of section 544-A
Cr.P.C., which for the sake of convenience and ready
reference is reproduced below:-

“8.544-A Cr.P.C. Compensation to the heirs of
the person killed, etc: (1) Whenever a person is

convicted of an offence in the commission
whereof the death of or hurt, injury or mental
anguish or psychological damage to any person is
caused or damage to or loss or destruction of any

property is caused, the Court shall when

convicting such person, unless for reasons to be
recorded in writing it otherwise directs, order the
person convicted to pay to the heirs of the person
hose death has been caused, or to person hurt or
injured, or to the person to whom mental anguish
or psychological damage has been caused, or to
the owner of the property damaged, lost or
destroyed, as the case may be, such compensation
as the court may determine having regard to the
circumstances of the case; and

(2) The compensation payable under sub-section
(1) shall be recoverable as an arrear of land
revenue and the court may further order that, in
default of payment or of recovery as aforesaid the
person ordered to pay such compensation shall
suffer imprisonment for a period not exceeding

six months, or if it be a court of the Magistrate of
27

the third class, for a period not exceeding thirty
days.

(3) The compensation payable under sub-section
(1) shall be in addition to any sentence which the
court may impose for the offence of which the
person directed to pay compensation has been
convicted.

The learned trial court has not recorded any reason for
not awarding compensation under section 544-A Cr.P.C.
In this view of the matter, in addition of sentence under
section 302(b) PPC, each of the appellant shall pay
rupees ten lac to legal heirs of the deceased as
compensation in terms of section 544-A Cr.P.C. and in
default thereof shall further undergo six months simple
imprisonment each. The substantive sentences of
imprisonment shall run concurrently with each other.

25. In view of the above, Murder Reference
No.6 of 2017 to the extent of sentence of the appellant
Azmat Ullah is answered in the Affirmative while to the
extent of appellant Hukman Shah the same is answered in
the Negative.
