5. Upon completion of investigation
and conclusion of proceedings under section
512 Cr.P.C, the accused/appellant was

declared “proclaimed offender” by the

learned trial Court vide its order dated

Ghafoor Khan (appellant) expecting his arrest,
the accused could not be arrested however,

We On 23.03. 2015 the present

Appellant was arrested, a supplementary

é

challan was submitted against him before the
learned trial Court. During the trial, the
prosecution examined as many as 16
witnesses whose statements were recorded and
placed on file. On closure of the prosecution
evidence, accused was examined under section
342, Cr.P.C, wherein he denied the charges,
posed innocence and stated to have falsely
been implicated in the case.

8. It is pertinent to mention here that
despite the fact that the complainant Nasib
Gul was available for recording his evidence
on six (6) consecutive dates of hearing i.e.
from 09.6.2015 to 28.09.2015, however, the
learned counsel representing the accused on
every occasion requested for adjournment and
as such the said PW had left the country,
resultantly, his statement recorded under
section 512 Cr.P.C was transposed to the file
of present case. The same order of
transposition was challenged before this Court
as well as before the august Supreme Court of

Pakistan but was concurrently affirmed.

9, On conclusion of the trial, the
learned Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla
Qazi Dir Lower at Chakdara convicted and
sentenced the accused/appellant vide the
judgment impugned herein, hence these
connected matters.

10. The learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the appellant has drawn the attention
of this Court to the statement of Badshahzad
Gul whose statement was recorded as PW-4 in
proceedings under section 512 Cr.P.C and
stated that he has narrated altogether a
different story, which contradicts the
allegations of the complainant. He has further
argued that although the statements of the
PWs were transposed to the present case but
the documents exhibited during proceedings
under section 512 Cr.P.C were not transposed
and some the documents do not contain
signature of the presiding officer, therefore,
the said documents cannot be relied upon. He
next argued that both PWs are interested

witnesses and in absence any independent

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
corroboration their testimony cannot be taken
into consideration. Conversely, the learned
counsel for the complainant and learned
A.A.G appearing on behalf of the State have
argued that it was a broad day light occurrence
and the prosecution has established its case
beyond reasonable doubts. They have further
argued that the witnesses were although
related to the deceased but were not interested
witnesses as there was no motive to substitute
the present Appellant for actual culprit.

11. Arguments of the learned
counsels were heard at length and the record
was perused with able assistance.

12. It is the case of prosecution that
the then Sub-Inspector Muhammad Iqbal now
dead, PW-12 (transposed witness) in pursuit
of information when reached to the hospital
situated in village Gul Abad, where he found
dead body of deceased Sher Zada. The
complainant Naseeb Gul (PW-1) on 05.7.2002
at 14:00 hours reported him the matter that on

the day of occurrence he (complainant)

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
74

alongwith his brothers Shams Gul (PW-13)
and Sher Zada (deceased) had gone to Tehsil
Courts Chakdara and after attending the Court
proceedings, they were on their way back to
home. All of them (complainant-party) when
reached to village Asbanr, boarded in the
vehicle of accused Ghafoor Khan and on the
way conductor of the vehicle demanded fare
of Rs. 15/- for three (3) persons from his
brother Sher Zada (deceased) but instead he
gave him Rs. 10. Due to which an altercation
had taken place between both of them,
therefore, we (complainant-party) de-boarded
from the vehicle and proceeded towards our
village on foot. At about 12.30 hours when the
complainant-party reached to the place of
occurrence, the accused Ghafoor Khan duly
armed with Kalashnikov came there in his
vehicle and made a fire shot upon the
deceased in order to commit his Qatl-e-amd.
Due to a fire shot of accused, brother of the
complainant Sher Zada was hit on his right

side and succumbed to the injury on the way

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
at

rs

le

to hospital. The Complainant in his statement
had put forward the motive for the
commission of offence as altercation on far.
In addition to the complainant the occurrence
is stated to have been witnessed by his brother
Shams Gul (PW-13).

13. In support of the prosecution case
although the complainant Nasib Gul did not
record his statement before the trial Court in
the subsequent proceedings for obvious
reasons that despite his availability, the
learned counsel for the accused for more than
three (3) months ie. from 09.6.2015 to
28.9.2015 dragged the matter and did not
make himself available for cross-examination
of the complainant. Resultantly, the said
witness had to leave the country for his
livelihood abroad and his testimony recorded
in proceedings under section 512 Cr.P.C was
transposed to the present case as PW-1. The
said order of transposition was upheld up to
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan. The

said PW in his statement has attributed a

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr, Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-ll-

single fire shot to the present appellant and the
motive behind the said act is altercation on
fare while they were travelling in the Suzuki
of the appellant. His statement is also
supported by the medical evidence, which also
suggest that the deceased had received a single
firearm injury on his body. In this regard, the

report Ex. PW-6/1 is reproduced as under:-

1. Oval round wound % inch
all around edges inverted 9
inches below armpit towards
right side at lumber area
(entrance).

2. Oval round wound 2 inches
from all side with averted edges 6
inch below nipple 2 cm later to
meet axillary line.

3. Weapon: firearm.

4. Postmortem may be
needed for confirmation of cause
of death if needed.

We are also conscious of the fact

that the august Supreme Court of Pakistan
while affirming the transposition of PW-1
Nasib Gul to the record of the present case has
observed that the evidentiary value of his
testimony is to be considered by the trial
Court. It is by now settled that the evidence of
the eyewitness in the form of examination-in-
chief was an admissible piece of evidence

NAWAB/PS* DB: ‘Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan

Mr, Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-12-

which could be taken into consideration by the
Court in peculiar facts and circumstances but
with extra care and caution i.e. its
corroboration by medical and other evidence.
In the similar situation, the august Supreme
Court of Pakistan has relied upon such a
testimony in case of “Arbab Tasleem vs. The
State” reported as PLD 2010 Supreme Court
642.

14, Be that as it may, however, it is
not the sole statement of the complainant
which was considered for the conviction of the
appellant but in support of his testimony the
other eyewitness who is also the brother of the
deceased appeared as PW-13, who fully
supported the incident. Though there are
certain minor discrepancies in his cross-
examination but the same are for obvious
reason that the occurrence had taken place on
05.07.2002 and he was cross-examined on
04.11.2016, therefore, with passage of time it
is human nature that he would not remember

the scene with photographic view and

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr, Justice Syed Arshad Ali
=f =

precision of the happening. Hence, on that
minor discrepancy, his testimony cannot be
disregarded.

15. We are also conscious of the fact
that these said two witnesses are the real
brothers of the deceased but in absence of any
deep rooted enmity they are not expected to
substitute the actual culprit for the present
appellant. We do not agree with the learned
counsel for the Appellant that they are
interested witness, because interested witness
is a person who had a motive to falsely
implicate the other person and mere their
relationship with the deceased cannot be made
a base to discard their testimony. In this regard
wisdom is drawn from the law laid down by
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan reported
as ‘’Niaz_vs_ the State PLD 1960 Supreme
Court 387’’,Sharafat Ali vs the State 1999
SCMR 329”’, “Abdur Rauf vs the State, 2003

SCMR 522”’, “Dilawar Hussain vs the State,

PLD 2008 S.C. 131”’.

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
-14-

In Sharafat Ali’s case Supra, the
august Supreme Court of Pakistan while
considering the testimony of the witnesses,
one of whom was the husband of the sister of
the deceased and the other was his brother has
held:- “Considering the testimony of these
two eye-witnesses on the touchstone of the
aforesaid criteria, we do not find that their
testimony is tainted or they had any motive to
falsely implicate the appellant nor any
enmity worth the name has been brought on
record to show that they were implicating the
appellant in this case falsely.”

In Abdur Rauf ‘s case Supra, it
was held by the august Supreme Court of
Pakistan:- “ We may observe that relationship
itself is no ground to discard and discredit
the testimony of eye-witnesses unless it is
shown that they are partisan and interested
witnesses. The eye-witnesses in the present
case undoubtedly are related to the deceased
but they have been found entirely

independent and truthful, therefore, their

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-15-

testimony without looking for any other
corroborative evidence, would alone be
sufficient to establish the charge. The
evidence of related witnesses who are not
found inimical and are confidence-inspiring
would hardly need any corroboration.
However, in the present case as discussed
above, the ocular account is seeking ample
support from the motive, the medical
evidence and the attending circumstances.”
In Dilawar Hussain’s case Supra
regarding the relationship of the witnesses, the
august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held:-
“The parties as well as the witnesses were
closely related inter se and also have good
relations except that appellant was annoyed
with the deceased for his purchase of land
from his father and thus in absence of any
enmity or ill-will, mere relationship is not a
valid ground to discard the evidence of a
person and similarly a witness non-resident
of locality, is not as such unnatural witness,

therefore the evidence of such witness cannot

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-16-

be excluded from consideration for mere
reason that he was related to the deceased or
was not resident of the area in which crime
was committed.”

Therefore, the learned trial Court
has relied upon their testimony.
16. Furthermore, we are also
convinced from their testimony that their
presence at the spot was confidence inspiring
because not only they promptly lodged the
FIR but their statements that the deceased had
sustained a single firearm injury on right side
of his body was also corroborated by the
medical evidence. Although, the prosecution
has failed to establish the recovery of
Kalashnikov from the appellant, however, the
non-recovery of the Kalashnikov is no ground
to disbelieve the prosecution case because the
ocular testimony of the prosecution witnesses
is duly corroborated by the circumstantial
evidence i.e. recoveries effected from the spot
of blood-stained earth and garments of the

deceased alongwith one crime empty of 7.62

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-[7-

bore fully established the prosecution case
against the present appellant.

17. Moving on to the arguments of
the learned counsel that statement of PW-4
recorded during proceedings under section
512 Cr.P.C narrates altogether a different
story cannot be considered, because the said
statement was not part and parcel of the record
of the present case as the same was neither
transposed by the prosecution nor the defence
has taken the same as his defence. The
assertions of learned counsel that the exhibited
documents were not transposed alongwith the
statement of PW-1 Nasib Gul, the complainant
is also without any substance because the
testimony of PW-1 and PW-12 were
transposed in its full form and furthermore all
the materials i.e. Murasila Ex. PA/1, FIR Ex.
PA, injury sheet Ex. PW-2/1, sketch memo
Ex. PE, medical report of the doctor
concerned Ex. PW-6/1, site plan Ex. PB, and
other recoveries being effected from the spot

were also put to the accused/appellant for his

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-18-

defence in his statement recorded under

section 342 Cr.P.C, therefore, no prejudice

was caused to him and he was duly confronted

with the said recovery memos.

18. In view of the above discussion,
we do not find any merits in the appeal on the
question of guilt of the accused/appellant,
therefore, the judgment of conviction and
sentence recorded by the learned trial Court is
maintained and this appeal is dismissed
accordingly.

19. Regarding the revision petition for
enhancement preferred by the complainant-
petitioner, we have noted that in view of the
present facts and circumstances of the case the
conviction of life imprisonment awarded to the
accused/respondent is justified and does not
warrant further enhancement. Therefore, the
criminal revision in hand for enhancement also
stands dismissed.
