2. On 23.06.2013, at 12:00 AM,
Chanzeb/complainant alongwith dead
body of deceased Mst. Misbah, his wife
reported the matter to the local police in
emergency ward of DHQ, Hospital,
Haripur that he and his father are barbers
by profession, working in Deh Pind
Hashim Khan. That on that day at
morning time, his father Muhamamd Riaz
went to the house of Ahmed Khan in
Mohallah for cooking meal in connection
with Khatam Sharif, while he along with
his mother Rashida Bibi and wife Mosbah
Bibi were present at their house, when at
about 08:00 AM, his paternal cousin
Azam son of Abdul Rasheed came to their
house and after staying for a while, when
out back after some time and thereafter,
he alongwith Azam proceeded towards
the house of Ahmed Khan, however, in
the way Azam returned to (complainant’s)
asking him to bring his meal there to their
house. That he alongwith his father were

serving the guests in the house of Ahmed
Khan, when at about 11:00 AM, he heard
firing shots from his house’s upon which
he alongwith his father rushed towards
their house, where they saw, Azam having
pistol in his hand, came out from their
house and decamped towards village
Maira and when he alongwith his father
entered the house, his wife Mst. Misbah
Bibi was lying near the door of room in
injured condition, while dead body of his
mother Mst. Rashida Bibi was lying
inside the room. Mst. Misbah Bibi
succumbed to injuries while shifting to
hospital. Motive behind the occurrence
was stated to be dispute over the wall of
house between his father and his paternal
uncle, Abdul Rasheed, father of
accused/Azam.

3. After completion of investigation,
complete challan was put in Court.
Provision of section 265 (C) Cr. P.C were
complied with, thereafter, charge was
framed against the accused. In order

prove its case against appellant,
prosecution examined as many as 14
witnesses. After recording of prosecution
evidence, statement of accused was
recorded under section 342 Cr. P.C.
Learned trial Court after hearing of
arguments, vide impugned judgment
convicted the appellant as mentioned
above, hence, aggrieved from the
conviction and_ sentence, appellant
preferred this appeal.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for
appellant as well as Additional Advocate
General heard and record perused.

5. Perusal of record reveals that
appellant/convict was charged in the case
for the murder of Mst. Rashida Bibi
(mother) and Mst. Misbah Bibi (wife) of
the complainant Chanzeb son of
Muhammad Riaz. Initially he remained
absconder, however, he was later on
arrested at Chaman (Quetta) Baluchistan
province and was transferred to Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa. His card of arrest is on file,

wherein, his age is recorded as 18/19
years at the time of his arrest, whereas,
the occurrence took place on 23.06.2013
i.e almost one year prior to his arrest.
Similarly, in the formal charge framed on
25.08.2014, his age is recorded as 18/19
years. On our query, it is intimated that
the date of birth of the appellant is
02.01.1998 and after calculation his age at
the date of alleged commission of offence
comes to be about 15-1/2 years and
therefore, on the date of occurrence, he
was a child within the meaning of section
2 (b) of the Juvenile Justice System
Ordinance, 2000, which is now repealed
and substituted by Juvenile Justice System
Act, 2018, (Act of 2018). Child in the
repealed Ordinance and Act of 2018, is

defined as:

Child: “means for the purpose of this Act a person

who has not attained the age of eighteen years”.

Similarly, Juvenile is defined in section 2
(h), which means “a child who may be
dealt with for an offence in a manner

which is different from an adult”. The
Act of 2018, in section 7 has provided the
procedure of investigation of Juvenile
cases, which is reproduced herein below:
Investigation in juvenile
cases- (1) A Juvenile shall be
interrogated by a_ police
officer not below the rank of
sub-Inspector under
supervision of Superintendent
of Police or SDOP.
(2) The investigation officer
designated under sub-section
91) shall be assisted by
probation officer or by a
social welfare officer notified
by the Government to prepare
social investigation report to
be annexed with the report
prepared under section 173 of
the code.
Similarly, a special procedure for
determination of age has been provided in
section 8 of the Act of 2018, which is as

following.
Determination of age. ---(1)
Where a person alleged to have
committed an offence physically
appears or claims to be a juvenile
for the purpose of this Act, the
officer-in-charge of the police
station or the investigation officer
shall make an inquiry to determine
the age of such person on the basis
of his birth certificate, educational
certificates or any other pertinent
documents. In absence of such
documents, age of such accused
person may be determined on the
basis of a medical examination
report by a medical officer.

(2) When an accused person who
Physically appears to be a juvenile
for the purpose of this Act is
brought before a Court under
section 167 of the Code, the Court
before granting further detention
shall record its findings regarding
age on the basis of available

record including the report
submitted by the police or medical

examination report by a medical

Officer.

6. From the record, we have noticed
that the age of appellant/convict is
recorded 18/19 years in the card of arrest
but the investigation officer has failed to
conduct any inquiry to determine his age
on the basis of birth certificate, education
certificate or any other document, nor he
has been medically examined. Similarly,
the Court granting custody of the
appellant/convict has also failed to
discharge its functions in light of section
8(2) of the ibid Act. On the face of record,
when the appellant at the time of arrest
was 18/19 years, while the occurrence
took place 1 year before his arrest, then,
presumption arises that he was under 18
years of age at the time of alleged offence
and was juvenile. Non observance of
mandatory provisions of law regarding
determination of his age has deprived him

of the special rights and _ protection
available to him as a child/juvenile. In
the case of Sultan Ahmed-Vs-Additional
Sessions Judge-I, Mianwali and 2 others,
reported in PLD 2004 Supreme Court
758, it has been authoritatively held that:

The opening phrase of the said
section is, ‘IF A QUESTION
ARISES’ and not 'IF A QUESTION
IS RAISED': The selection by the
legislature of _ the words
comprising this expression is
sufficient to demonstrate that the
commencement of an exercise to
find out the age of an accused
person is not dependent upon such
a question being raised by some
party to the proceedings i.e. the
accused person himself or the
State or even by the complainant
or by a WALL in cases involving
QATL-I-AMD. The word 'ARISE'
means ‘TO RISE UP' WHILE THE
WORD -RAISE' means ~TO
CAUSE TO RISE'. ARISES’ thus
indicates rising up by itself
whereas ‘RAISES’ involves
someone else causing it to rise.
Therefore, what is meant by the
said provisions of the said section
is not that the Courts are required
to wait to undertake an inquiry to
determine the age of an accused

person till such a question is
10

raised before them. Dispensation
of justice is the obligation cast on
the Courts of law. The parties;
their agents; their learned counsel;
their witnesses and others are only
an instrument provided to them for
the proper discharge of the said
duty. It would be horrendous to
visualize 'CHILD' or a 'MINOR'
being hanged to death only
because the question of his
minority had not been raised
before the relevant Court. It is the
function of a Court to ensure that
no illegality is permitted to occur
and no injustice is allowed to
creep into its decisions. To
conclude, therefore, it is stated
that irrespective of the fact
whether the issue of the age of an
accused person is or is not raised
before the Court, it is the
obligation of the learned Presiding
Officer to suspend all further
proceedings in a trial and to hold
an inquiry to determine the age of
an accused person if and whenever
it appears to him that such a
determination was necessary.

7. For the above reasons and
while relying on the above referred case
law, we are of the affirmed view that the
question of determination of age was vital

before putting the appellant/convict to
11

trial, hence, without dilating upon merits
of the case, this appeal is accepted and
impugned conviction and sentence is set-
aside, and case is remanded to the Child
Protection Court to first determine the age
of appellant/accused and if it is proved
that at the time of alleged offence, he was
minor/juvenile, then to conduct fresh trial
under the relevant law. In the meanwhile,
appellant/accused shall remain under trial
prisoner.

Announced.
