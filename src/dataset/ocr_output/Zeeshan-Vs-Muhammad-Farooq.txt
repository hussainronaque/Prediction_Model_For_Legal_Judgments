JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- At a trial

held by learned Additional Sessions Judge-III, Mardan,
appellants 1. Zeeshan and 2. Faizan, having been found
guilty of various offences, vide impugned judgment dated
14.02.2015, have been convicted and sentences as under:-

Under section 324/34 PPC:-To undergo

05 yers RI. and to pay a fine of

Rs.20,000/- or in default thereof to

undergo 02months S.I. further.

Under section 337-D PPC: To undergo

05 years R.I. and to pay Arsh equal to

1/3" of diyat amounting to Rs.7,24,859/-

to victim Muhammad Farooq.

Under section 427 PPC:- To undergo 06

months R.I..

The sentences have been directed to run

concurrently. Benefit of $.382-B Cr.P.C.

has been extended to the appellants-

convicts.
2. During the course of arguments, it came to
light that the learned Trial Court while recording
conviction and sentence of the appellants-convict under
section 427 PPC, has not specifically charge-sheeted the
appellants under the said section of law which clearly
depicts that the appellants have been misled in their
defence which has cause prejudice to them. It is well
settled principle of law that charge against accused shall be
specific, fair and clear in all respects to provide an
opportunity to the accused to defend himself in due course
of trial. Charge is a brief formulation of specific
allegations made against accused person, who is entitled to
know its nature at the very early stage of the trial. It must
convey to the accused with sufficient transparency and
clarity as to what the prosecution intends to prove against
him. Under section 232 Cr.P.C. Appellate Court is vested
with the power to direct a new trial or quash the
conviction, if it is found that on account of omission of
particulars in framing charge, prejudice has been caused to

the accused and that he has not been provided an

opportunity of clear understanding of the charge to defend
himself. According to mandatory provisions of section 233
Cr.P.C. for every distinct offence, a separate charge sheet
should be framed in order to enable the accused to defend
himself against the accusations levelled against him while
under section 235 Cr.P.C. a proper mechanism for trial of
an accused, charged for more than one offence, has been
provided. The learned Trial Court has not complied with
the mandatory provisions of section 233 Cr.P.C. by not
framing separate charge under section 427 PPC against the
appellants-convicts.

3. It appears from the impugned judgment that
the learned Trial Court has also convicted and sentenced
the appellants under section 337-D, PPC, on the basis of
hospital record/ discharge slips of victims Muhammad
Farooq Exh. PW.12/1 and Exh.PW.12/2, respectively,
showing his treatment history in the hospital. Both these
documents have been strongly objected by the defence at
the time of production and exhibition in the statement of
victim Muhammad Farooq. The objection of the defence
read as under:-

“STO by the defence counsel that these
discharge slips are not to be exhibited

because these were not handed over to the

1.0. during the course of investigation and

being false, factitious certificate having no

legal worth and value. Neither these

documents were produced to the I.O nor to

the accused at the time of delivering the

copies under section 265-C Cr.P.C., hence

in admissible in evidence”.
This material objection of the defence has neither been
answered by the learned Trial Court at the very first
instance nor at the time of final judgment. Keeping in view
the quantum of sentence under section 337-D PPC, in the
interest of justice, it was essential for the learned Trial
Court to meet this objection in light of the law of evidence.
Thus, recording of conviction of the appellants by the
learned Trial Court under section 337-D PPC, without
answering the objection of the defence, would be against
the law and norms of justice.
4, Besides, the learned Trial Court while
convicting the appellants-convicts under section 337-D
PPC and sentencing them thereunder, has not directed the
mode of payment of the Arsh i.e. whether to be paid in
lump sum or in installments as contemplated under section

337-X PPC. Similarly, the consequences to be faced by the

convicts in case of their failure to pay arsh, has also not
been mentioned in the judgment.

5. Keeping in view the above mentioned
irregularities and illegalities causing miscarriage of justice,
I, while setting aside the convictions and sentences of the
appellants convict, hereby remand the case to the learned
trial Court for formulation of charge against the appellants
under section 427 PPC, and trial denovo. If any such
objection is raised again by the defence at the time of
production of documentary evidence in respect of proof of
offence under section 337-D PPC, the learned Trial Court
shall met the same by recording specific findings in
accordance with law. It would be appropriate to mention
here that the learned Trial Courts in each and every case is
bound to meet the objections raised by either party during
trial at the time of exhibition of certain documents in even
at the very first instance or at the time of recording final
judgment.

6. During the period of trial denovo the
appellants shall remain as under trial prisoners. Since, the
appellants are behind the bars from the last two years and
three months, therefore, the learned Trial Court shall
proceed with the trial on day to day basis and conclude the

same as early as possible, but not later than a month, from

the date of receipt of the record. In case of failure to
conclude the trial within the specified period, if delay was
not on the part of the appellants or anybody acting on their
behalf, they would be at liberty to file an application for
bail which shall be disposed of independently. Office is
directed to send the record to the learned Trial Court

within two days, without fail.

7. This appeal stands disposed of in the above
terms.
8. The Additional Registrar of this Court is

directed to send copy of this judgment to the learned
Sessions Judge, Mardan with the direction to circulate
copy of the same among the Additional Sessions Judges, in
District Mardan, for future guidance, with intimation to
this Court.

7. For what has been discussed above, Suo motu
notice given to accused Shakir stands withdrawn. He is
admitted to bail on already existing bail bonds, on merits.
Since this court has already directed expeditious
conclusion of trial while dealing with the bail petition of
co-accused Farman, therefore, office is directed to send the
record to the quarter concerned within two days, positively.
