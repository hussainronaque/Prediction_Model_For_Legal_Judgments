JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.-

Being unsuccessful before the two Courts below

to get the concession of bail, petitioners (1) Sher

Zaman and (2) Imtiaz, through this further

petition, seek bail from this Court in case FIR

No.3 dated 02.01.2015, registered under sections

302/324/34 P.P.C., in Police Station Faqir Abad,

wherein they alongwith Hafiz ud Din and

Haroon (absconding co-accused), are charged

for committing the Qatl-e-Amd of Ali Asghar

deceased with firearms, attempting at the life of

complainant Ali Hassan Khan by firing at him

ineffectively and causing injury on the person of

PW Inayat ur Rehman by inflicting Butt blows

on his head, on a motive of children brawl. In

addition to the complainant the incident is stated

to have been witnessed by his brother Ali Johar

and injured Inayat ur Rehman.

2. Arguments heard and record perused.

3. It appears from the First Information

report that petitioners have not been nominated

therein directly, rather one Hafiz ud Din

absconding co-accused has been named in the

very initial report i.e. Murasila, but later on,

digits 5/6 persons have been inserted above his

name on two occasions. On 08.01.2015,

complainant while recording his statement u/s

164 Cr.P.C., nominated the petitioners and

other co-accused to be the said 5/6 persons. If

insertion/ addition of digits 5/6 persons in the

first part of the murasila is considered to be a

clerical mistake, then repetition of same

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

exercise in subsequent part of murasila above

the name of co-accused Hafiz ud Din, is beyond

my comprehension which smells mala fide on

the part of the complainant to throw a net wider

on the entire family. Again in the initial report

all the accused i.e. absconding accused Hafiz

ud Din and 5/6 persons, have been nominated

for firing, but PW Ali Johar in his statement

recorded under section 164 Cr.P.C. only

attributed the role of fatal shot to absconding

co-accused Hafiz ud Din (Fazal Amin).

Similarly, injured PW Inayat ur Rehman has

charged nobody for his injuries as according to

him there was a brawl inter-se the deceased and

absconding co-accused Hafiz ud Din over

children and that in the process of separation he

sustained injuries and became unconscious. He

has not disclosed about presence of the

petitioners on the spot at the time of incident.

Besides, as per autopsy report, the deceased has

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

sustained a solitary firearm entry wound with

exit for which more than 6 persons have been

charged, however, on the face of record, the

case of the petitioners is on different footing

from that of absconding co-accused Hafiz ud

Din, who has been directly nominated for the

occurrence. On tentative assessment all these

circumstances require further probe into the

guilt of the petitioners, hence, they are entitled

to concession of bail. It is settled law that bail

may not be withheld as a punishment as a

mistaken relief of bail can be repaired by

convicting the accused, if proved guilty, but no

proper reparation can be offered for unjustified

incarceration, albeit, his acquittal in the long

run. As regard abscondance of the petitioners, it

has been held by the august Apex Court in case

titled, “Qamar alias Mitho Vs The State and

others” (PLD 2012 Supreme Court 222) that

right of bail could not be refused to accused

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

merely on account of his alleged abscondance
which is a factor relevant only to propriety. The
relevant part of the judgment is reproduced
below for ready reference:-
“It has vehemently been argued by
the learned Additional Prosecutor-
General, Punjab appearing for the
State that the petitioner had
remained a Proclaimed Offender
for a period of about four years and,
thus, he is not entitled to any
indulgence in the matter of bail. We
have, however, not felt persuaded to
agree with the learned Additional
Prosecutor-General in this regard.
It has already been held by this
Court in the cases of Ibrahim v.
Hayat Gul and othes (1985 SCMR
382) and Muhammad Sadiq V
Sadiq and others PLD 1985 SC 182)

that in a case calling for further

inquiry into the guilt of an accused
person bail is not to be allowed to
him as of right and such right
cannot be refused to him merely on
account of his alleged abscondance
which is a factor relevant only to
propriety”.

Same view has been reiterated by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled, “Ikram
ul Haq Vs Raja Naveed Sabir and others”
(2012 SCMR 1273) in the following words:-

“It has vehemently been argued by
learned counsel for the petitioner
that respondent No.1 had remained
a fugitive from law and had been
declared a Proclaimed Offender,
and ths, he was not entitled to be
extended the concession of bail. We
have, however, remained unable to
subscribe to this submission of the

learned counsel for the petitioner

because the law is by now settled

that in a case calling for further

inquiry into the guilt of an accused

person bail is to be allowed to him

as a matter of right and not by way

of grace or concession. Bail is

sometime refused to an accused

person on_ account of his

absconsion but such refusal of bail

proceeds primarily upon a question

of propriety. It goes without saying

that whenever a_ question of

propriety is confronted with a

question of right the latter must

prevail”.

For the reasons discussed above and

taking guidance from the dictum of the Hon’ble

Supreme Court, I am inclined to exercise the

discretion of bail in favour of the petitioners.

Resultantly, this petition is allowed.

Accused/petitioners are admitted to bail,

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

provided each one of them furnishes bail bonds

in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two sureties

each in the like amount to the satisfaction of

learned [Illaqa Judicial Magistrate/MOD,

concerned. The sureties must be local, reliable

and men of means.
