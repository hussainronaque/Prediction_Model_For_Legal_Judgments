MOHAMMAD IBRAHIM _ KHAN, J:-.
Through this bail petition, petitioner
Zeeshan alias Shanay seeks his release on
bail in case FIR No.215 dated 28.04.2022,
registered under Section 9-D KP CNSA
2019, at Police Station Tordher, District
Swabi.

2. As per prosecution case, after
obtaining search warrant from the competent
Court, the house of petitioner was raided by

local police; where in presence of petitioner
from a cupboard of his residential room, five
packets of Charas total weighing 4975
grams were recovered. Consequently the
contraband was taken into possession,
petitioner was arrested and a case vide FIR

mentioned above was registered against him.

3. Arguments heard and available record
gone through.
4. Perusal of record reveals that though

search warrant for conducting raid on the
house of petitioner was obtained from the
Court of learned JM-III, Lahor (Swabi) but
neither date of its issuance nor the date for
which said warrant has been issued for raid
on the house of petitioner is mentioned
therein. Moreover, no independent witness
has been associated by local police at the
time of raid on the said house, which is
mandatory under Section 31 KP CNSA
2019, according to which in case of search
of dwelling house Section 103 Cr.PC shall
strictly be observed. No other family

member of petitioner has been arrested
during raid upon the said house, nor shown
present at relevant time, making it a case of
further inquiry under Section 497(2) Cr.PC.
5. No document qua ownership of the
house is available on file; which could
suggest that the said house was ownership of
petitioner. Besides, the alleged contraband
has not been recovered from immediate
possession of petitioner; rather it has been
recovered from a cupboard of a residential
room of the house occupied jointly, so it
could not be stated with certainty that the
alleged contraband was ownership of
petitioner; which fact could better be
determined by learned trial Court after
recording prosecution evidence.

6. Apart from above, petitioner and his
other family members had filed numerous
complaints against the SHO and other police
officials of P.S. Tordher before the DPO
Swabi as well as I.G. Police Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, for harassing the petitioner

and their family members. Even an
application under Section 22-A Cr.PC was
also submitted before the learned Justice of
Peace for registration of FIR against the
above officials, due to which the question of
false implication of petitioner in the instant
case could not be ruled out.

7. So far as registration of other criminal
cases against petitioner is concerned,
admittedly in two of the said cases,
petitioner has been acquitted by the learned
trial Court vide judgment/order dated
09.06.2021 and 24.06.2022 respectively;
whereas he has not been convicted in the
remaining cases. Besides as per observation
of apex Court held in case of “Qurban Ali
Vs The State” (2017 SCMR 279); impact
of the other criminal record against accused
is not relevant for disposal of the instant
petition; rather this Court is only seized of
the instant bail application. Despite
remaining in police custody for sufficient
time neither any further recovery of

incriminating article has been recovered
from the possession of petitioner nor he
made any confession before the competent
Court which could connect him with the
commission of offence. He is behind the bar
since his arrest and no more required to the
Investigation Agency for further
interrogation; therefore, this bail petition is
allowed and petitioner is admitted to bail
subject to furnishing bail bonds in the sum
of Rs.200,000/- (Two lac) with two sureties
each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
learned [laqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate/ trial
Court concerned, who shall ensure that the
sureties are local, reliable and men of
means.

The ibid observations are the tentative
assessment of the material available on the
record of the case, which shall not influence
the mind of the learned trial Court in any
manner at the time of trial.

Announced.
