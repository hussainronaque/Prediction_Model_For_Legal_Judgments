SAHIBZADA_ ASADULLAH |, J.- Through this

single judgment we intend to dispose of instant
Criminal appeal as well as Cr. Revision No.11-D of
2018, titled Tariq Nawaz Vs Ehsanullah and
Criminal Revision petition No.07-D of 2019, titled
“The State Vs. Ehsanullah”, being arisen out of one

and same judgment dated 30/11/2018.

2. Ehsanullah alias Ahsan Ali Sunny, the

appellant/convict through present criminal appeal

preferred under section 410 Cr.P.C has impugned the

judgment dated 30/11/2018, passed by the learned

Additional Sessions Judge-VI, D.I.Khan, whereby he

was convicted and sentenced in case FIR No.1260

dated 22/12/2015, under section 302 PPC, registered

at Police station Cantt. D.I.Khan, the details whereof

are as under:-

ii.

U/S 302(b) PPC, he was convicted
and sentenced for Qatl-e-Amd of
Kamran Zafar to imprisonment for
life with . compensation of
Rs.2,00,000 ( rupees two lac) payable
to the legal heirs of the deceased as
provided U/S 544-A Cr.P.C, or to
undergo further six months SI
indefault whereof.

Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C is
also extended to the  convict/

appellant.

3. The complainant Tariq Iabal has also

filed a criminal revision No. 11-D of 2018 against the
convict / appellant Ehsanullah alias Ahsan Ali Sunny,
while other Cr. Revision No.07-D/2019 has been
moved by the State against the appellant/convict for
enhancement of his conviction.

4, According to the prosecution version as

disclosed in the F.LR Ex:PW-2/1, lodged by the
complainant Tariq Iqbal in the emergency room of
civil Hospital D.I.Khan are that on the eventful day,
he was present in his house when received a phone
call that Kamran has been fired at and has been
shifted to the hospital in injured condition; that he
rushed to the hospital where found his brother dead
due to fire arm injury. He came to know that Ehsan
Alik alias Sunny, i.e appellant/accused came to their
house, where his brother Kamran and PW Muhammad
Umar were standing outside the house in the street.
Appellant/accused called his brother Kamran, and he
accordingly started walking with him and when

reached at the corner of the street, the appellant took
out of his pistol and fired at his brother Kanran, who
got injured and lateron succumbed to his injuries.

Hence FIR (ibid).

5. After completion of investigation,

complete challan was submitted before the trial
court against appellant/accused Ehsanullah and the

trial commenced.

6. In order to prove its case, prosecution
examined as many as (11) witnesses. After closure
of the prosecution evidence, statement of appellant/

accused Ehsanullah was recorded under section

é
Ba 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he professed innocence. He

neither wished to be examined on oath, as required
under section 340 (2)Cr.P.C. nor opted to produce
defence evidence. After hearing the prosecutor and
defence, learned trial court convicted and sentenced
appellant/ accused, as mentioned earlier, hence the

instant appeal.

7. It is the contention of learned counsel for

the convict/ appellant that the impugned judgment is
the result of misreading and non-reading of the
evidence; that the testimony of the PWs are full of
contradictions and discrepancies; that the ocular
account is inconsistent with the medical evidence as
well as circumstantial evidence and the site plan; that
motive set up by the prosecution is false, un-natural
and the motive advanced by the complainant was
neither explained nor proved; that the learned trial
Court by not adverting to the facts and circumstances
of the case has erred in law and therefore, the
impugned judgment is liable to reversal. Lastly, he
argued that the occurrence has not taken place in the

mode and manner as disclosed by the prosecution.

8. As against that AAG assisted by learned

counsel for the complainant argued that the
prosecution has fully established the guilt of the

appellant through cogent, coherent and confidence

inspiring ocular account supported by circumstantial
evidence in the shape of recovery of blood from the
venue of occurrence and as well through medical
evidence and thus he has rightly been convicted by

the learned trial Court.

9. In support of the criminal revision,

learned counsel for the complainant contended that
the prosecution has proved the guilt of the appellant
up to the hilt and hence in the attending
circumstances of the case, he was liable for maximum

sentence provided for the offence.

CO 10. We have considered the submissions of

Y

learned counsel for the parties, AAG for the state and

gone through the record of the case.

ll. The tragic incident was reported in the
Civil Hospital, Dera, by the complainant which was
pen down by Fazal Hussain SI (PW-11) through

murasila (Ex.PW 1/1). In the report, the
yy

complainant stated that he .was telephonically
informed that the deceased alongwith Muhammad
Umer was present in front of his house that the
accused called him who followed, the accused
pulled out his pistol and fired at him; that the
deceased, then injured was taken to the hospital by
Muhammad Umer (PW-10) but before reaching
hospital the deceased breathed his last. The motive
advanced was that a day prior the deceased entered
into marriage with one Mst. Samina, the aunt of the
appellant and the accused was unhappy with the

marriage.

12. The incident occurred at 1.00 p.m
whereas the report is made at 2.00 p.m by the
complainant despite the fact that the hospital is
situated in close proximity and the deceased was
rushed there and then by the eye witness
Muhammad Umer. The subsequent events in the

hospital raise suspicion regarding the presence of

Muhammad Umer (PW-10) on the spot at the time
of occurrence and his arrival to the hospital with the
dead body, it is admitted on record that the hospital
has its reporting centre, naturally the police officials
are present for the purpose to enter the reports,
surprisingly PW-10 who is not only the eye witness
of the occurrence but also brother-in-law of the
deceased, when asked to lodge report he did not
and waited till the complainant arrived. This
witness when cross-examined he laid it open that
that after 30 minutes of arrival of the dead body to
the hospital, the complainant reached and the report
was made. This witness did not say that it was PW-
10, who informed the complainant with details of
the incident and even the complainant did not
mention as to who informed him. This conduct of
the witness and the complainant leaves us nowhere
but to hold that the incident is un-witnessed and the

report was made after consultation. Both the

witnesses openly contradicts each other regarding
their presence in the hospital, the time they received
the dead body after post mortem and the time they
left the hospital, The eye witness contented that he
left for home after thirty minutes of the report when
yet the post mortem was not finalized, he further
stated that the IO recorded his 161 statement in the
hospital and then in the house of deceased Kamran
Zafar at 3.00 p.m. The complainant who appeared
as PW-9, when examined stated that PW-10 was
present with him from the time of report till
4.00/5.00 p.m when the dead body was received
after the post mortem examination. PW-10
Muhammad Umer went on to say that after
recording his 161 Cr.P.C statement by the
investigating officer at 3.00 p.m in the house of the
deceased, he never met again the police officials

especially the Investigating officer, if so, the

-10-

question arises that on whose pointation, the site

plan was prepared, is still a mystery.

13- The doctor who was examined as PW-
5, this witness when cross-examined stated that it
was 2.00 p.m when the dead body was produced by
the police, he did not say that it was PW
Muhammad Umer who brought the dead body to
the hospital. The status of said Muhammad Umer as
independent witness vanishes when he did not opt

for report as the dead body reaches to the hospital

/ and even in the column meant for identification

whether this is the post Mortem report or the
inquest report, he figures nowhere. All, whether
these are the police officials or the private witnesses
struggled hard to make the prosecution case a

success even if at the cost of an innocent person.

14- Though the trial court was heavily
influenced that it was a case of single accused and

substitution a rare phenomena but it is not the

-ll-

universal truth, the courts are to see each case
according to its own peculiar circumstances. Yes,
single accused is charged but will it alone be
sufficient for conviction that too, on a capital
charge, if we hold it “yes”, then result will be

dangerous and drastic.

15- The prosecution case is full of dents
and a conscious attempt was made to make it a
success admittedly, the hospital has its own
reporting center where police are present round the
clock but neither the report was made to them nor
they tried to enter the arrival of the dead body to the
hospital. We are astonished to see that the scribe,
Fazal Hussain SI (PW-11) when came to the
witness box made an open departure from what the
complainant and eye witness had said. This is
admitted on record that the casualty has its police
and they are only to examine and report when the

dead bodies are brought to the hospital. It was at

-12-

1.30 p.m when the dead body was brought to the
hospital then why the need was felt to import Fazal
Hussain SI, who infact was an ASHO attached to
the PS, as a scribe and why per Fazal Hussain
statement, the dead body was initially taken to the
casualty police who made entry in the hospital at
1.50 p.m, and why those police are not witnesses to
the proceedings. The structure created by the
prosecution received further jolts when the scribe
stated that he did not draft the murasila, he frankly
admitted that neither the injury sheet nor the inquest
report was prepared by him. He candidly admitted
that the time of occurrence in murasila is tampered
and he found over writing there, he went on to say
that even the name of the accused was cut and
corrected. When this is the attitude, character and
integrity of the witnesses, then what presumption
can be drawn and no court will feel hesitation but to

hold that preliminary investigation was conducted.

-13-

The overall situation gives an open impression that
the eye witness and complainant were procured and
consultation and deliberation was made to charge
the accused, cannot be ruled out. In case titled
Abdul Jabbar Vs the State (2019 SCMR 129), it has

been held that:-

“ It is the settled principle of law that once
a single loophole is observed in case
presented by the prosecution much less
glaring conflict in the ocular account and
medical evidence or for that matter where
presence of eyewitnesses is not free from
doubt, the benefit of such loopholeNacuna
in the prosecution case automatically goes
in favour of an accused. At the cost of
alteration, it has been observed by us that,
in a case where the learned appellate
court, after reappraisal of entire evidence
available on record, has reached the
conclusion that there is unexplained delay
in holding the FIR, the presence of
eyewitnesses is not established, there are
irreparable dents in the case of
prosecution; the recovery is ineffective and
is of no consequence; the ocular account
is belied by the medical evidence; the

motive behind the occurrence is far from

-14-

the being proved and almost non-exist ant,
the said court fell in gross error in
maintaining the conviction of the
appellants particularly on a capital charge.
In these circumstances and after an
independent evaluation of evidence
available on record, we have no manner of
doubt in our minds that the prosecution
has not been able to prove its case against

the appellants beyond reasonable doubt”.

16- The record indicates that the house of
PW Muhammad Umer has not been shown in the
site plan and the presence of this witness at the
given time does not seem natural as his house is
away from the place of occurrence. The mode and
manner of occurrence casts | shadow over the
veracity of this witness. The motive was introduced
by this witness as the unhappiness of the accused on
the marriage of deceased with Mst. Samina a day
prior to the occurrence, Samina is the aunt of the
accused and the age of the accused was 18/19 years

whereas that of the deceased was 36 years, what
-15-

relation the accused could have with his aunt that
too when their ages were the ages of respect for
each other and again the age of the accused and the
deceased cannot welcome such motive and such
dispute, the motive advanced was neither explained
nor proved and yet again why the prosecution did
not produce Mst. Samina, had she been produced,
her production would have fumed the tale, but she
was not produced as she was not ready to support

the false charge.

17- The prosecution stressed that after the
occurrence, the accused decamped and remained
fugitive till his arrest on 01-03-2017 but this fact
alone is not sufficient to bring conviction on capital

charge.

18- The mode, manner and time of
occurrence is shrouded in mystery. The conduct of
Muhammad Umer is not natural, rather abnormal

and the way he presented the story, is not plausible,
«

-16-

had he been present on the spot, he would have
easily over powered the accused as the accused
according to the site plan, was in the catching
distance, he surprised us that he put the dead body
in Quingqi/Rikshaw but who helped him in
transporting the dead body to the hospital, is not
known and till date they are undisclosed. He admits
his relation with the deceased being brother in law
but he could not prove his presence on the spot at

the relevant time.

19- The discussion made above leads us to
an inescapable conclusion that the prosecution had
failed to prove its case against the accused/appellant
beyond reasonable doubt. This ‘appeal is, therefore,
allowed. The conviction and sentence of the
appellant recorded by the learned trial court is set
aside and is acquitted of the charge by extending

him the benefit of doubt. He shall be released

24

-17-

forthwith from Jail, if not required to be detained in

connection with any other case.

20- The connected Cr. Revision No. 11-D of
2018, filed by complainant Tariq Iqbal and Cr.
Revision No.07-D of 2019, filed by the State, against
the appellant are dismissed.

21- These are the detailed reasons of my

short order of even date.

Announced.
