2. Precisely, the facts of the present case are
that on 09.09.2019 at 14.30 hours, complainant
Azmat Ali son of Ahmad Zaman (who is
respondent No.2 herein) alongwith his real brother
Nayyar Zaman, both in injured condition, lodged
report to Sarfraz Khan IHC (PW-8) in Emergency
Ward of THQ Hospital Ghazi to the effect that he
alongwith his brother Nayyar Zaman was present
at their shop situated at Pahai; when in the
meanwhile, Meesam Abbas (who is appellant
herein) equipped with Churri came to their shop
and as soon as reached there, he stabbed the
Churri (knife) on left side of chest of his real
brother with intent to murder him; when he moved
forward to rescue his brother, appellant also
stabbed the Churri (knife) in his abdomen with
intent to murder him also; thereafter appellant fled
away from the spot; the occurrence besides him
was stated to have been witnessed by Sabir son of
Ghulam Hassan (PW-11) and Qasim son of Qamar
Zaman (abandoned) who were present on the spot
and they took them to the hospital for treatment.
No previous enmity/motive was mentioned in the

FIR. He charged the appellant for commission of

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat ‘Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
/

offences. The said IHC prepared the injury-sheets
of both the injured and reduced the report of the
complainant into writing in shape of Murasila
(Ex.PW-8/1) and the same was sent to the Police
Station through constable Dildar No.49 for
registration of case; resultantly instant FIR
(Ex.PW-6/1) was registered. Lateron, one of the
injured namely Nayyar Zaman succumbed to
injuries. In the wake thereof, appellant was
arrested.

3. After the completion of investigation, the
complete challan was submitted before the court
against the appellant upon which a full-fledged trial
was conducted. Prosecution in order to prove its
case against the appellant, produced as many as
seventeen (17) witnesses including the important
statements of Azmat Ali as PW-10, who is the
complainant of this case and narrated almost the
same facts which he recorded in his report Ex.P W-
8/1. PW-11 is Sabir Ali son of Ghulam Hassan. He
being eyewitness of the occurrence also narrated
the facts regarding the occurrence while toeing the

complainant/PW-10. PW-12 is Waseel Ahmad son

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
rd

of Muhammad Ashraf. He too, provided ocular
account of the occurrence and shifted injured
Azmat to hospital through motorcycle. PW-13 is
Malik Basharat Ali son of Abdul Qadir. He is also
stated to have witnessed the occurrence and to
have sent both the injured Azmat Ali through PW
Waseel Ahmad, and Nayyar Zaman through
Suzuki Van of Asad to the hospital. He also stated
to have caught hold of appellant and snatched
knife from him and handed it over to police
through Sher Azam Khan who appeared as PW-
15. PW-16 is Arshad Khan Sub-Inspector. He
conducted investigation after the conduct of initial
investigation by Javed Khan IHC/PW-3. When
prosecution closed its evidence, statement of the
appellant was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C
before the learned trial court, wherein he claimed
innocence. However, he neither wished to produce
the defense evidence nor desired to be examined
as witness under section 340(2) Cr.PC. After
hearing arguments of both the sides, the learned
trial court passed convictions and sentences

against the appellant under the relevant sections of

(Jamil) (DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
law as stated hereinabove, through order and
judgment dated 12.08.2022 which order and
judgment has now been challenged by the
appellant through the instant criminal appeal.

4. Arguments of the respective learned counsel
for the appellant as well as learned Assistant
Advocate General assisted by the learned counsel
for complainant were heard in considerable detail
and record perused with their able assistance.

5. It is the case of prosecution as reported by
PW-10 namely Azmat Ali to PW-8 namely Sarfraz
Khan IHC to the effect that on the day and time of
occurrence when his brother namely Nayyar
Zaman was present in his shop when in the
meanwhile, the appellant who was equipped with a
knife came to their shop and as soon as he
reached, he stabbed his brother with the knife on
his left side of chest and when he rushed for the
rescue of his brother, the appellant also gave him a
Churri blow on his belly and then he fled away
from the spot. The said occurrence was stated to
be witnessed by Sabir who appeared as PW-11 and

Qasim who was abandoned. It has also been

(Jamil) (DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
specifically stated that two PWs namely Sabir and
Qasim have shifted them to the hospital and
motive was stated to be no previous enmity. It is
also part of the record that the occurrence has
taken place at 1.30 hours, whereas the report has
been made at 14.30 hours and it was soon there-
after when the injured brother of the complainant
namely Nayyar Jamal succumbed to his injury and
died approximately two hours after the occurrence.
6. In order to prove the charge, the prosecution
has produced the ocular account through PW-10
Azmat Ali who has also received a stab wound on
his belly and PW-11 who was shown as an
eyewitness of the occurrence in the FIR, whereas
one witness Waseel Ahmad was also produced as
PW-12. The evidence of the injured PWs was
gone through word by word and the same was
found in complete conformity and in line with the
charge as set up in the First Information Report
and since he has himself sustained injury in the
occurrence, therefore, being an injured witness his
evidence could not be lightly ignored. His

statement confirms the time, mode and manner of

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.

the occurrence, place of occurrence as well as his
presence at the relevant time. Though learned
counsel for the appellant tried to shatter his
evidence, however, we do not find ourselves to
hold his evidence as unbelievable.

7. We have also noted that as per the First
Information Report, the occurrence has taken place
at 1.30 hours and the same was promptly reported
at 02.30 p.m. which fact alone excludes the
possibility and hypothesis of any consultations or
deliberations on the part of the complainant party.
It was also noted that the appellant as well as the
complainant party belong to the same village and
occurrence has been taken place at broad daylight,
therefore, the element of misidentification or wrong
identification could not even be inferred which
stamps the case of prosecution with truthfulness
and correctness. It is also part of the record that the
appellant has singularly and specifically been
charged for causing fatal stab blows to the
deceased then injured as well as to the

complainant (PW-10) and thus a single accused

(Jamil) (DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
/

has been nominated for causing fatal injuries to
the two persons.

8. The medico-legal evidence available on file
would show that the appellant was all out to make
a murderous assault on two persons. As per
record, the deceased then injured has received a
fatal blow on left side of his chest which was
lateron proved fatal for his life whereas the
complainant too has received an injury on his
belly which has caused his intestines out of the
cavity/trunk, therefore, in the given facts and
circumstances, the intention of the appellant to
make a murderous assault on two persons is
established on the face of record.

9. During the course of arguments, learned
counsel for the appellant made much stress that
infact the injuries on both the victims were of
such a nature and their condition was opined as
critical by Dr.Qasim (PW-5 ), therefore, they
would not have been able to make the report or to
verify the same as alleged by the prosecution,
however, his this stance is, prima facie,

misconceived as in the case of both the injured,

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-10-

the doctor has opined and has found their clinical
condition as “vital stable” which means that their
respiratory system, pulse, heartbeat and blood-
pressure were normal and thus when they were
normal in terms of the above factors then they
could have also made the report or to verify the
same. It is also established on the face of record
that the occurrence has occurred at place, where
the same has been alleged, as PW-3 namely Javed
Khan IHC in his court statement has categorically
stated that after receiving of the copy of FIR, he
rushed to the place of occurrence where he took
into possession blood through cotton from the
places of deceased Nayyar Zaman as well as of
the complainant Azmat Ali. Similarly, the blood
stained Bunyan and Shalwar of the deceased and
cloth. (Chadar) of injured were also taken into
possession and when the same were sent to the
Forensic Science Laboratory, the same was found
to have human blood and of same group.

10. It was also argued on behalf of appellant
that the complainant in the First Information

Report has only stated regarding the injury

(Jamil) (DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran I layat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-ll-

sustained by his deceased brother on his chest and
he has not uttered a single word regarding the
injury sustained by his deceased brother on his
thigh, however, when the said complainant
appeared in the court as PW-10, in his cross-
examination, a specific question was asked from
him and he has explained the same that when he
saw the appellant by giving Churri blow on the
chest of his brother, he ran to rescue him through
the second door of the shop during which
moment accused might have caused the second
blow, therefore, such objection of learned counsel
for appellant too is misconceived.

11. The prosecution has not only relied on the
statement of PW-10 Azmat Ali but they have also
produced other PW namely Sabir who appeared
as PW-11 and he too, has furnished a consistent
evidence qua the material particulars of the
occurrence and the defence has not been able to
shatter his evidence as well and thus in view of
the above, the prosecution has been able to
produce consistent, trustworthy and confidence

inspiring evidence through PW-10 and PW-11.

(Jamil) (DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-12-

12. Apart from the ocular account, the
prosecution has also been able to prove their case
through circumstantial evidence as __ stated
hereinabove that the blood from the places of
deceased (then injured) and injured/PW-10 have
been shown recovered. Similarly, the blood
stained cloths of the deceased as well as Shawal of
injured have also been taken into possession
through recovery memo and were produced in the
court.

13. In view of the above discussion and the
material available on file as well as the evidence
as produced by the prosecution, the prosecution
has been able to prove the guilt of the appellant
and thus he has rightly been convicted, however,
whether on the available record, the learned trial
court has rightly awarded the maximum
punishment of death to the appellant? or as to
whether on the available record the capital
punishment was not legally justified? These
questions are to be answered hereinafter.

14. As observed, discussed and held in the
preceding paras of this judgment that the

prosecution has been able to prove the guilt of the

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-13-

appellant, however, there are certain mitigating

circumstances available on file which could be

considered for reduction of capital punishment of

death into imprisonment for life, which are as

under:

()

(Jamil)

As per the contents of First Information
Report, the complainant/ PW-10 has not
set any motive for the said occurrence.
Similarly, when he appeared in the court
as PW-10 there too, he has not uttered a
single word regarding the existence of
any motive, however, when the other PW
Sabir Ali who was duly mentioned in the
First Information Report as eyewitness
and he appeared in the court as PW-11,
he during his cross-examination has
clearly stated that altercation between the
appellant and the deceased inside the
shop remained round about for 2 to 3
minutes in his presence. He has further
stated that on the notice of altercation
inside the shop he had not went inside
the shop, which obviously means that
PW-10 and PW-11 are not in line qua the
motive of the occurrence or at least
complainant/PW-10 Azmat Ali has
suppressed the motive and it is still

shrouded in mystery what thing flared up

(DB) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)

-14-

the appellant or had the deceased enraged
the appellant which resulted into the
occurrence. This aspect of the case is one
of the circumstances which could
mitigate severity of punishment of
appellant qua reduction from capital
punishment of death into imprisonment
for life. In the case titled “ZAFAR
IQBAL alias ZAFARULLAH KHAN ys.
The STATE” reported as 2017 SCMR
1721 the august Supreme Court has held
that as far as awarding of death sentence
to the appellant by the Courts below is
concerned, we have observed that the
occurrence had taken place at the spur of
the moment due to sudden provocation
without any pre planning and pre-
mediation. The mode and manner of the
occurrence would further reveal that
there was a single shot fired at the
deceased without repeating the same.
There was no motive for the appellant to
commit Qatl-i-amd of the deceased. All
these aspects compel us to exercise
caution in the matter of appellant's

sentence of death.

(DB) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Kamran Hayat Miankiel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)

-15-

(I) If the consistent plea of the complainant

qua non-existence of any previous
motive is taken and considered as true
and correct then even absence of any
motive between the appellant and
deceased could be considered as a
mitigating circumstance for reduction of
sentence of death into that of
imprisonment for life. In the case titled
“BAKHT MUNIR and another vs. The
STATE and another” reported as 2020
SCMR__588 the Apex Court has
converted the sentence of death of the
convict into imprisonment for life by
holding that it is crystal clear that there
was no previous enmity between the
parties. The circumstances of the case
unequivocally suggest that the
occurrence had taken place at the spur of
the moment without any premeditation

on the part of the appellant.

(IID) It is also part of the record and as stated

by PW-11 that before the occurrence,
there was altercation between the
appellant and the deceased and it was
during the said altercation when the

appellant flared up, however, the

(DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran. Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)

-16-

appellant has opted only for a single stab
blow at the vital part of the deceased and
has not repeated any blow thereafter,
therefore, it is a case of a single stab
blow as well as in the aforementioned
context it appears to be an occurrence
that took place at the spur of the moment
which fact too, can be considered as a
mitigating circumstance for reduction of
capital punishment of death into
imprisonment for life. In the case titled
“REHMAT KHAN and another ys. The
STATE _and_ others” reported as 2017
SCMR__2034 the Apex Court has
observed that in appeal, the learned
Division Bench of the Lahore High Court
after taking into consideration the
mitigating circumstances of the case i.e.
single fire shot attributed to the petitioner
and the alleged recovery of pistol being
inconsequential rightly converted his

death sentence to life imprisonment.

(IV) It is also part of the record that soon after

the occurrence, one PW Malik Basharat
who is stated to have attracted to the spot
and who snatched knife from the

appellant, however, as per record/FSL

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.

(Jamil)

-17-

report, neither the said knife was stained
with any blood nor the same was
produced to the police by aforesaid PW
Malik Basharat rather the same was
produced to the police by one Sher Azam
who appeared as PW-15 but he did not
utter a single word that this knife was
used in the commission of offence,
obviously for the reason that he himself
is not an eyewitness of the occurrence,
therefore, whether it was the same knife
which was used in the commission of
offence or not is a question which could
neither have been explained nor
answered by the prosecution, hence, this
aspect of the case too, can be considered
as a mitigating circumstance for
reduction of capital punishment of death

into imprisonment for life.

It is also part of the record and as stated
by PW-3 namely Javed Khan IHC that on
the day of occurrence he got the
information that the appellant is at home
and thus when he went towards the house
of appellant where he was found present

and accordingly he was arrested,

(DB) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
(Jamil)

-18-

therefore, his presence at the home after
the occurrence instead of opting to flee
away speaks volume of an unnatural
conduct rather it speaks of an innocent

character.

(VI) It is also part of the record that though

the deceased then injured has received
injury on his thigh, however, when his
Shalwar was produced, the same was
neither stained with any blood nor the
same is having any corresponding cut
which fact too, can be considered as a
mitigating circumstance for reduction of
capital punishment of death into

imprisonment for life.

(VI) It was also noted that the complainant

party has alleged that at the time of
occurrence, complainant (PW-10) and
deceased Nayyar Zaman, PW Sabir, PW
Qasim and PW Waseel Ahmad were
present, whereas the appellant was
shown all alone, however, despite the
fact that the complainant party was
comprising of five persons but they could
not overpower a single person i.e. the
appellant or at least to stop him from

further/maximum damage.

(DB) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.

15. Keeping in view the above aspects of the
case, this court has come to the conclusion that as
like the concept of benefit of doubt for considering
the question of guilt or otherwise, the court of law
could also consider any mitigating circumstance(s)
for awarding lesser penalty keeping in view the
facts and circumstances of the case. The aforesaid
principle of appreciating of evidence qua
considering the mitigating circumstances for the
purpose of reduction in capital punishment was
applied by the Apex Court in the case titled “Mir
Muhammad alias Miro ys. The State” reported as
2009 SCMR_ 1188 where the Apex Court
converted the death sentence awarded to the
accused into that of life imprisonment. Similarly,

in the case titled “Mir Muhammad alias Miro vs.

The State” reported as 2007 SCMR 1413, it has
been observed by the Apex Court that normally
penalty for an act of commission of Qatl-i-Amd
provided under the law is death, but since life
imprisonment also being a legal sentence for such
offence must be kept in mind wherever the facts

and circumstances warrant mitigation of sentence,

(Jamil) (DB) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-20 -

because no hard and fast rule can be applied in
each and every case. In view of the above
discussion and for mitigating circumstances as
highlighted in the preceding Paras of this
judgment, the sentence of appellant awarded to
him under section 302(b) PPC is reduced from that
of death to the imprisonment for life.

16. In view of the above discussions and
expositions of law on the subject, this court while
maintaining the conviction of the appellant
recorded by learned trial court vide its order and
judgment dated 12.08.2022, however, his sentence
of death recorded under section 302(b) PPC as
ta’zir is converted and altered to imprisonment for
life under section 302(b) PPC as ta’zir, whereas
rest of the convictions and sentences awarded to
the appellant under section 324 PPC as well as
under section 337-D PPC, by the learned trial
court through the aforesaid order and judgment
are maintained. The compensation amount of
Rs.500,000/- awarded by the learned trial court
under section 544-A Cr.PC shall also remain

intact. All the sentences shall run concurrently to

Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.

each other and the benefit of section 382-B Cr.PC
shall also be extended to him. With the aforesaid
modification, the appeal in hand is partially
allowed, while the Murder Reference No.5-A/
2022 sent by the learned trial court for
confirmation of death sentence is answered in
negative.

The above are the detailed reasons of the

short order of even date.
