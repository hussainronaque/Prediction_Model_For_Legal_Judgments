SYED
MUHAMMAD FAROOQ SHAH, J.:- Through this application, the applicant
Nadeem Akhtar seeks bail in FIR No. 238 of 2013, registered under section
392/34 PPC, at police station Ferozabad, Karachi. 
            
Prosecution
story as narrated in the FIR by complainant Sajid Hussain is that two persons
one of them was armed with TT pistol, on gun point snatched mobile phone QE-6
and Rs.500/-. In the meanwhile police mobile of police station Ferozabad
reached there and on commotion surrounded the culprits and caught hold of
them.  
 
It
is alleged that Muhammad Zahid was holding 30 bore pistol with live bullets in
magazine and a mobile phone QE-6, cash Rs. 500/- and mobile phone Nokia C2 has
been recovered from his possession. It is alleged that from the possession of
co-accused applicant Nadeem Akhtar son of Jala Javed Akhtar nothing was
recovered. Mashirnama of recovery and arrest was prepared in presence of the complainant
Sajid Hussain and PC Maqsood by duty officer SI Safdar Khan of Ferozabad police
station. Bail application filed earlier was dismissed by IIIrd Additional
Sessions Judge, Karachi (East) on 16.07.2013. Hence the instant bail
application.  
 
Learned
counsel at the very outset submitted that nothing was recovered from the
possession of applicant Nadeem Akhtar and that he has falsely been implicated
in this case due to malafide of concerned police. Learned counsel further submitted
that section 392 Cr.P.C. is not attracted to the applicant as neither he was
holding any weapon nor incriminating article was recovered from his possession
which shows that applicant was not having guilty intention to commit such
offence. It is next contended that no independent person has been cited as witness
of recovery except the complainant. Lastly, it is contended by learned counsel
that challan has already been submitted and the applicant is no more required
for further investigation particularly the complainant did not specifically
assign any role t the applicant of commission of alleged offence. To support
her contentions learned counsel has relied upon the cases reported as MUHAMMAD
ISMAIL V/S THE STATE (2009 MLD 30), KHALID @ KHADI V/S THE STATE (2002 MLD
1471), JAFAR HUSSAIN @ JOJO V/S THE STATE (2008 P.CR.L.J. 1444) AND MST. RIAZ
BIBI V/S SHO POLICE STAITON SAHIRPIR (2002 P.CR.L.J. 530).
 
Conversely,
learned Assistant Prosecutor General, Sindh admitted that no specific role in
commission of crime has been assigned to the applicant but since his presence was
shown there, hence he raise objection for grant of bail to the applicant.
 
Admittedly
no specific role in commission of robbery/dacoity has been assigned to the
applicant who was allegedly apprehended at the scene of occurrence and no
incriminating articles including arm has been recovered from his possession, therefore,
vicarious liability of the applicant is yet to be resolved by the trial court
at the time of evidence. The case of the applicant falls within the ambit of further
enquiry within the provisions of section 497(2) Cr.P.C. Consequently, the bail
application is allowed. The applicant is admitted to bail subject to his
furnishing surety in the sum of Rs. 50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only) and
P.R.Bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court.
