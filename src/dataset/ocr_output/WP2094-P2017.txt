JUDGMENT

with the following prayer:-

That on acceptance of this writ petition,
this Hon’ble Court may graciously be

pleased to declare the impugned second

Respondent(s) : (The Govt. of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, —
Peshawar and others) by Syed Qaiser Ali Shah, AAG.

ABDUL SHAKOOR, J .- Petitioner has filed the .

instant petition for issuance of an appropriate writ,

show cause notice dated 05.05.2017 on

the same set of allegations for which
petitioner was once punished, as

without lawful authority and hence of

no legal effect and this august Court ©

may further be pleased to strike down
the same being against the
constitutional mandate and the Khyber

Pakhunkhwa Police Rules, 1975 and

direct the respondents to act in the
matter in accordance with law and to
refrain from taking any disciplinary

action on the basis of same.

2. Brief facts leading to the instant

’ petition are that petitioner, at the relevant time,
‘ when one Siraj lodged a complaint against his illegal

detention before the Worthy Chief Minister of

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar, was SHO at Police
Station, Hastnagri. As on the complaint of said Siraj

who was in custody at police station of petitioner, in

connection with case FIR No.1072 dated 08.12.2014

registered under section 382 PPC, the worthy Chief
Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa alongwith high-up of

police on 10.12.2016 came to Police Station,

Kotwali and directed the DSP namely Rokhan Zeb.

to produce the said Siraj before him at that Police
Station. Accordingly, the said DSP and petitioner
produced the aforesaid accused Siraj before the

worthy Chief Minister..The Worthy Chief Minister

without going into deep passed a decree that the said

accused was kept in unlawful custody. On account

of that decree of Chief Minister petitioner was

WINER

Say High Court
suspended from the service vide order dated
11.12.2016. Accordingly, an Inquiry Committee was
constituted to probe as to whether or not the accused

Siraj was illegally confined. The petitioner

explained his position before the Inquiry Committee

vide his written statement and denied the charge of

illegal confinement of the above said Siraj. The
Inquiry Committee in his report recommended
suitable punishment to petitioner and Moharrir
Police Station, Kotwali. In the light of said Inquiry
Report the high-ups of the police directed the
respondent No.3 the competent authority to proceed
against the petitioner and the concerned DSP.
Accordingly, the respondent No.3 issued a show
cause notice dated 23.12.2016, which was properly
replied by the petitioner and it resulted into order of
respondent No.3. dated 10.1.2017 through which
petitioner was awarded minor punishment of
censure and reinstated him in service. The petitioner
despite being punished on account of alleged illegal
detention of aforesaid Siraj in term of issuance of
censure vide order dated 10.1.2017 of respondent

No.3 again issued a show cause notice dated

05.05.2017 by the respondent No.3 regarding the
same charge of detention of aforesaid Siraj. The
petitioner being aggrieved from the issuance of
show cause notice dated 05.05.2017 which amounts

to double jeopardy in terms of Article-13. of the

~ Constitution, filed the present petition. _

3. The respondents have filed the

 parawise comments but they could not offer any

justification for issuance of show cause notice dated
05.05.2017. |
4. We have heard learned counsel for the
petitioner as well learned AAG and have carefully
gone through the record.

5. A bare look at show cause ‘notice
impugned herein and show cause notice dated
23.12.2016 shows. that both are having the same

charge against the petitioner. As it is an admitted fact

that petitioner as a result of show cause notice dated

23.12.2016 has been awarded minor punishment by
the competent authority i.e. respondent No.3 in term
of censure. In this view of the matter, the respondent

No.3 according to the command of Article-13 of the

Constitution of Pakistan no way could issue sho

lf

ws

Cogs
cause notice dated 05.05.2017 for proceeding against
the petitioner on the basis of the charges against
which he has already been punished. This act on the

part of the respondent No.3 amounts to double

_ jeopardy which is not permissible under the terms of

" Article-13 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of

Pakistan, 1973.
6. This court is fully in agreement with the

contention of learned counsel for the petitioner that

once the competent authority has awarded the

punishment to the petitioner against the charge of

illegal detention then whatever the case may be the
respondent No.3/competent authority could not
initiate fresh proceeding against the said charge of
illegal detention of aforesaid Siraj and this amount to

vexing twice for the same cause/charge. In this

regard, he has referred to this court two cases, one of

Apex Court reported in 1989 SCMR 1224 and |

second of Lahore High Court, reported as 2000 PLC
(CS) 1373.

7. As the matter regarding the charge of
illegal detention of Siraj after the punishment of the

petitioner in term of censure has attained the finality,

OF AUG 2817
thus by no principle of law same matter could be
reopened for purpose of imposing higher penalty
even on the ground that discovery of fresh material
had pointed to the grave misconduct of petitioner.

8. _In the circumstances, referred to
hereinabove, this petition is allowed and initiation of
fresh proceeding against the petitioner by means of
impugned show cause notice dated 05.05.2017 on
the same facts and charges for which he has already
been punished in terms of censure is declared as
without lawful authority, of no legal effect and
violation of Article-13 of Te. Constitution of

Pakistan. “Le Mh po te
