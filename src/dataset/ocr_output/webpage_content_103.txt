1.    Urgent motion is accorded.

counsel for the applicant, inter alia,
submits that the applicant has falsely been implicated in this case i.e. FIR
No.04/2016 under section 161/34 PPC of Police Station ACE Sukkur by the
complainant with malafide intention and ulterior motives. Learned counsel
further contends that the applicant intends to surrender before the trial court
to face the trial but having apprehension of his maltreatment, disgrace,
humiliation from the hands of police, if arrested, he has approached this Court
for grant of protection. 
 
Since
the applicant intends to appear before the trial court to face the trial and
seek further remedy in accordance with law, without touching the merits of the
case, protective bail for ten days from today is granted to the applicant on his
furnishing solvent surety in the sum of Rs.50,000/-
(Rupees fifty thousand only) and P.R.Bond in the like
amount to the satisfaction of the Nazir of this court. 
 
This
concession of protective bail shall cease to have force on 11.06.2016 or when
the applicant surrenders himself before the trial court, whichever is earlier. 
 
This
bail application stands disposed of in the above terms.
