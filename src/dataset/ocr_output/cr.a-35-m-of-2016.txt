appeal alongwith murder reference are going to be decided

through this common judgment.

5. Learned counsel for the appellant argued that there
is considerable delay.,in lodging the F.I.R, which is fatal to
the case of prosecution. It appears to have been lodged with
due deliberation, consultation and preliminary investigation
by the police. He further argued that complainant is alleged
eye witness of the occurrence, but he was abandoned. The
place of alleged occurrence is the front of Manzoor Hotel, but
said Manzoor was not produced by the prosecution, therefore,
non production of important witnesses goes to the roots of the
case of prosecution. He vehemently argued that the learned
trial court has wrongly relied upon the statement of
complainant recorded during proceedings under section 512
Cr.PC, despite the fact that on 23.12.2015 the complainant
was present, but his statement was not recorded and was
abandoned being won over. He lastly argued that there is no
legal evidence, which connects the appellant with the
commission of offence, therefore, the learned trial court has

committed serious illegality by awarding capital punishment

to the accused, which is not maintainable and liable to be set

at naught.

6. On the other hand learned Addl: A.G for the

State and learned coynsel for the LRs of deceased, argued . :
that single accused is charged for murder of an innocent

person in a broad day light, witnessed by a disinterested

persons, whose statements are fully corroborated by the other

materials, recorded during proceedings under section 512

Cr.PC, which is admissible under Article 47 of the Qanun-e-

Shahadat Order and has been kept away by the appellant. He .

went on to say that the crime empty of 30 bore pistol was

recovered from the place of occurrence, while the deceased

received single firearm wound, which | corroborate’s the :

version of prosecution. He vehemently argued that the

accused after the occurrence went into hiding and remained

fugitive from law for a considerable period of long fifteen
years. His further argument was that there is strong motive
behind the occurrence, which is fully established. He lastly

argued. that ocular account, medical evidence and other
ATTESTED

DilKhan Bec, NV]

circumstantial evidence are in corroboration and prima facie

;
:
establish guilt of accused/ appellant, therefore, the learned

trial court has rightly convicted and sentenced the accused/
appellant, which needs not to be interfered with. In alternate
he prayed for remand of the case for proper transposition of

wa

the statement of PW Gandapur.
7. Arguments heard and record perused.

8. Before adverting to thé present case, we would
like to discuss the provisions of law, which provide
exceptions to the general rule, that oral evidence must be

direct. In view of this Court there are mainly two exceptions

(1) Dying declaration (under Article 46 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984) and (2) statement recorded under
section 512 Cr.PC read with Article 47 of the Qanun-e-

Shahadat Order 1984.

9. The above mentioned two provisions are
exceptions to ordinary rule of law, as evidence is to be
recorded in presence of the accused as provided under section
353 Cr.PC. The above referred two categories of evidence

take away the right of accused of recording evidence in his
ATTESTEU

wins

“egnawar High Court

presence. Evidence/ Dying declaration can be treated as
substantive evidence and accused can legitimately be
convicted on the strength of the ibid statements, subject to
certain limitations prescribed by the law. Both the above

referred statements can be admitted in evidence without

cross-examination.

10. Now adverting to the facts of the present case, in
this case PW Gandapur lodged the report, though he has not
named any person as witness to the tragedy, but during the
course of investigation one Manzor was also examined. It is
pertinent to mention here that after the occurrence appellant
absconded and statement of PW Gandapur was recorded
under section 512 Cr.PC on‘17.05.2006. After arrest of the
appellant supplementary challan was submitted and charge
was framed on 28.09.2015. On 23.12.2015 PW Gandapur
(the complainant) appeared before the trial Court and was
brought to the dock by the prosecution, but was abandoned

being won over through a joint statement duly signed by the

For convenience section 512 CrPC

reproduced as:

“512. Record of evidence in absence of
accused. (I) If it is proved that an accused
person has absconded, and that there is no
immediate prospect of arresting him the Court
competent to try or send for trial, to the Court of
Session or High Court such person for the
offence complained of may, in his absence,
examine the witnesses (if any) produced on
behalf of the prosecution, and record their
depositions. Any such’ deposition may, on the
arrest of such person, be given in evidence
against him on the inquiry into, of trial for the
offence with which he is charged, if the
dependant is dead or incapable of giving
evidence or his attendance cannot be procured
without an amount of delay, expense or
inconvenience which, under the circumstances

of the case, would be unreasonable.

(2) Record of evidence when offender
unknown. If it appears that an offence
punishable with death or imprisonment for life
has been committed by some person unknown,
the High Court may direct that any Magistrate
of the first class shall hold an inquiry and
examine any witness who can give evidence
concerning the offence. Any deposition so taken

may be given in evidence against any person

who is subsequently accused of the offence, if
the deponent is dead or incapable of giving

evidence or beyond the limits of Pakistan.”

Depositions recorded under section 512 Cr.PC

“47, Relevancy of certain evidence for
proving, in subsequent proceeding the truth of
facts therein stated. Evidence given by a
witness in a judicial proceeding, or before any
person authorized by law to take it, is relevant
for the purpose of Proving, in a subsequent
judicial proceeding, or in a later stage of the
Same judicial proceeding, the truth of the facts
which it states, when the witness is dead or
cannot be found, or is incapable of giving
evidence, or is kept out of the way by the
adverse party, or if his presence cannot be
obtained without an amount of delay or expense
which, under the circumstances of the case, the

Court considers unreasonable.
Provided that--

The proceeding was between the same

parties or representatives-in-interest;

the adverse party in the first proceeding

had the right opportunity to cross-examine;

the questions in issue were substantially
the same in the first as in the second

proceeding.”

Article 47 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984

lays down certain limitations for admitting statement of
witnesses in evidence recorded earlier in accordance with

law. There are five instances, which are as under:

1. When the witness is dead;
2. When he cannot be found;
3. When he is incapable of giving evidence;

4. When he is kept out of the way by the adverse
party; and .

5. When his presence cannot be obtained without

an amount of delay of expense which the Court

considers unreasonable,”

12. While in the instant case, the point for
determination is, when a witness to the lis, who is present in
the Court, is abandoned by the prosecution being won over,
whether his statement recorded under section 5 12 Cr.PC can
be transposed? In our view, the answer is in negative,

because of the reason that he does not qualify any of the five

. Nwimton .

- “esnawar High Court

awr'

-12-
Order, 1984, rather the same is in contravention of section
353 of the Criminal Procedure Code, wherein it is clearly
embedded that evidence is to be recorded in presence of

accused.

13. The word “shall” has been used in section 353
Cr.PC, which clearly manifests the intention of legislature,
Section 353 Cr.PC is reproduced as under:
“353, Evidence to be taken in presence
of accused. Except as otherwise expressly
provided, all evidence taken under Chapters XX,
XX, XXII and XXH-A shall be taken in the
presence of the accused, or, when his personal

attendance is dispensed with, in presence of his

pleader.”

The only exception in the ibid provision 353 of
the Cr.PC is that if accused waives his tight by dispensing
with his presence and is represented by pleader. In the
present case learned trial Court adopted the procedure which
is alien to the law provided under the Code as well as under

the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order.

N 14. There is no cavil to the proposition that cross-
UNOS

Dikhasé “examination is indefeasible right of the accused, which

-13-
cannot be taken away except in exceptional circumstances, as

referred in the preceding paragraphs.

15, Contention of the learned counsel that the
witness has been “Kept away” by the appellant is
misconceived, as he was physically present before the Court
instead of abandoning him the prosecution could have
examined and would have declared him hostile in case he
was not supporting the charge or case of the prosecution.

Reliance is placed on case titled “Braj Ballabh V. Akhony,

(AIR 1926 Cal 705), wherein it is held that, when a witness,

who has made a statement in a prior proceeding, is in
collusion with a party and avoids appearance before a
court in a subsequent proceeding, his previous statement
may be proved. The proof, that the witness was kept out
of the way, is essential for admission of his or her
Previous statement. The fact that a witness is kept out of

the way by the adversary must strictly be proved.

not formally transposed the statement of complainant PW
Gandapur and due to the reason, the case be remanded back
for transposition of his statement, whose maker was present
in the court and was abandoned being won over. In our view,
this would amount to putting the cart before the horse, hence

repelled.

17. In view of this legal position, the statement of
complainant Gandapur, recorded during earlier trial, cannot
be transposed in the event of presence of complainant before
the court during subsequent trial and as he was abandoned
him by the counsel of complainant and learned DPP, his
previous statement could not be considered in subsequent
trial against the appellant. From the available record that is
the F.LR and PM report shows the parentage of both the
deceased and complainant as Baran, caste Jalal Khel .
Pawanda, though that has not been clarified in evidence, but
parentage of the deceased and the abandoned PW/
complainant is same, then how, he was abandoned being won
over as apparent from the record he appears to be the brother

of the deceased.

-15-
18. Further more, other merits of the case are
concemed, it is alleged by the complainant that other people
who were present in the adda have seen the occurrence, but
no one has been brought before the Court, even one Manzoor,
in front of whose hotel the occurrence took place has not
been produced rather abandoned being witness of the same
facts as PW Gandapur. If the complainant Gandapur, was not
examined being won over, the witness of same facts namely

Manzoor could have been produced, but the prosecution has

' withheld the best evidence and adverse inference can be

ATTESTEL

drawn, that if he is produced he would also have not

supported the prosecution version, as that of the complainant.

19. Mere fact that single accused is charged is not an
absolute rule regarding his guilt, rather it is bounden duty of
the prosecution to firstly establish presence of the witness
who has allegedly seen the accused and secondly to believe
the testimony of eye witnesses, requires strong independent
corroboration to prove guilt of the accused. In the present
case, the alleged eye-witnesses have not been produced rather

abandoned, which gives a serious blow to the prosecution

-16-
case. When there is no ocular account or circumstantial chain
to connect the accused with the commission of offence, mere
corroborative evidence in shape of recovery of crime empty,

blood stained clothes, site plan, post mortem report, is of no

help to the prosecution case.

20. Recovery of one crime empty of 30 bore from

the spot is concerned, it is of no use to the prosecution

because no weapon of offence has been recovered, same is
tar a Se

the situation of motive which is a double edge weapon, cuts

either way.

21. It is evident from the record that appellant/
accused Nazak remained absconder for a sufficient long time.
In this part of the country people do abscond not because
they are guilty, but because of fear and torture of the police. -
Even otherwise absconsion is not substantive piece of
evidence, it is a corroborative piece of evidence and in cases
where direct evidence fails, corroborative piece of evidence
is of no avail, as in the instant case, where the evidence of

eye-witness have been disbelieved being defective, while
AITESTEL,

osha F. F
esnewar righ Cour:

P29 ARIE Eh AG mS ae

abscondence can neither cure the inherent defect of the ocular

account nor by itself is sufficient to sustain conviction. In this

respect reference can be made to case “Islam Badshah and

two others Vs the State”( PLD I 993 Peshawar 7). There are

plethora of judgments of the august Supreme Court that the

abscondance per se is not proof of the guilt of an accused
person and in which respect wisdom can also be drawn from |

the case “Rasool Muhammad Vs Asal Muhammad and 3

others” (1995 SCMR 1373), Again reference can be made to

case “Murad Khan and another Vs The State’ (2003 P
Cr. L J. 1295) [Peshawar], where it has been held that in the
absence of any other corroborative evidence, evidence of
abscondence, even if found convincing would not be
sufficient by itself to warrant conviction of accused on a

charge of murder.

22. It is the centuries old principle of administration
of criminal justice that prosecution is bound to prove its case
beyond any shadow of doubt. If any reasonable doubt arises

in the prosecution case, the benefit of the same must be
. APieD ew
Nsesamivon Vall

- 18 -
extended to the accused not as a grace or concession, but as a

matter of right lest no innocent be punished.

23. Likewise, it is also well embedded principle of
criminal justice that there is no need of so many doubts in the
prosecution case, rather any reasonable doubt arising out of
the prosecution evidence, pricking the judicious mind is
sufficient for acquittal of the accused. Reliance is placed on
case law “Tariq Pervaz Vs the State” (1995 SCMR 1345).
The same principle has been reiterated by the Hon’ble

Supreme Court in Muhammad Akram’s case (2009 SCMR

230), wherein it is held that:

“13. The nutshell of the whole discussion is that
the prosecution case is'not free from doubt. It is
an axiomatic principle of law that in case of
doubt, the benefit thereof must accrue in favour
of the accused as matter of right and not of
grace. It was observed by this Court in the case
of Tariq Pervez v. The State 1995 SCMR 1345
that for giving the benefit of doubt, it was not
necessary that there should be many

circumstances creating doubts. If there is

ATTESTEL circumstance which create reasonable doubt in

of doubt not as a matter of grace and

concession but as a matter of right.”

24. The learned trial Court has erred in law by
convicting appellant on the basis of such a weak type of
evidence. It would not be safe to maintain conviction on the
basis of such shaky and scanty evidence. Consequently,
appeal is allowed appellant/convict Nazak is acquitted while
murder reference is answered in negative, vide our short

order of the even date, which is reproduced as below:

“For the reasons to be recorded later, Criminal
Appeal No.35-D/2016 is accepted, the impugned
judgment of conviction and sentence dated
06.06.2016 recorded by learned Sessions Judge,
Tank is set aside and the appellant Nazak is
acquitted of the charges levelled against him in
this case. He shall be set free forthwith if not

required in any other case.

2. Murder reference No.5-d/2016 is answered

in negative.”
