JUDGMENT.
Date of hearing 8" October, 2018.

Tahir Khan & another................06 VS...ccceseeeeeeeserees dhe State.

Petitioner(s) by Mr. Muhammad Saleem Shakir, advocate.

State by Mr. Rab Nawaz Khan, Additional Advocate General.

WAQAR AHMAD SETH, CJ: - Accused-petitioners,
Tahir Khan & Rustom Khan sons of Badi uz Zaman,
charged in case vide FIR No. 745 dated 04.09.2018, under
section 9-C CNSA, registered in Police Station Shaheed
Gulfat Hussain, Peshawar, have approached this Court for
their release on bail, which was refused to them by learned
Judge Special Court-IV/Additional Sessions Judge-IV,
Peshawar, vide order dated 13.09.2018.

2. As per contents of FIR, the case of prosecution
is that, complainant Sheriyar Khan, SI on spy information,
made barricade on the place of occurrence and as per

h information, the vehicle bearing registration No. LE-4909,
Lahore, Silver Colour, coming from GT road, on seeing the
police party, diverted, however, overpowered by the
complainant party and on cursory investigation, driver
disclosed his name as Tahir Khan while another sitting on
front seat disclosed his name as Rustom Khan, brother
interse. On search of the vehicle, from beneath of both the
front seat, 2/2 KG charas were recovered, wherefrom five
grams were separated for chemical analysis and the instant
FIR was lodged.

3. I have heard learned counsel for the accused-
petitioner, learned AAG for the State and available record
gone through.

4. Perusal of available record would depict that
both the accused-petitioners have been arrested by the
complainant party on the allegations of having contraband,
allegedly to be smuggled to Peshawar, but neither the nature
of contraband either Garda or Pukhta charas was mentioned
in the FIR, nor their destination and nor their alleged place
of communication fromwhere the charas was dispatched, has

A been brought on record. Furthermore, nothing was brought
on record in respect of the seized vehicle, whether it was in
the name of accused-party or otherwise nor previous history
of accused-petitioners has been brought on record to show
their involvement in such like activities. Since their arrest,
accused-petitioners have been investigated / interrogated but
neither any further recovery has been made nor they
confessed their guilt. Moreover, a mistaken relief of bail
may be repaired by convicting the accused, if proved guilty,
but no proper reparation can be offered for his unjustified
incarceration, albeit, his acquittal in the long run. Reliance is
placed on the case of Zaigham Ashraf versus the State
and others, reported _in 2016 SCMR-18. Investigation is
complete and they are no more required to the prosecution,
hence keeping them behinds the bars for indefinite period
would serve no useful purpose, when their case falls within
the subsection-2 of section 497 Cr.PC, entitling them to the
concession of bail.

5. From the tentative assessment of record

petitioner has made out a case arguable for the purpose of

A bail, resultantly the same is allowed and accused-petitioners
be released on bail, provided they furnish bail bonds to the
tune of Rs. 4, 00,000/- with two sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned trial Court, who shall

ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men of means.

7. These are the reasons of my short order of even date.
