State by: Mr. Jawad Ali, AAG.

JUDGMENT

AHMAD ALI, J. The appellant (Mst. Rubina w/o

Ghulam Murtaza) through the instant appeal has
questioned the judgment of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-IV/Judge, Special Court, Nowshera,
dated 28.10.2019, delivered in case FIR No.26 dated
23.03.2019 under section 9-C CNSA, PS, Railway
Police Peshawar Cantt, whereby she was convicted and
sentenced to three years RI with fine of Rs.50,000/- or in
default thereof to suffer six months S.I. Benefit of
Section 382-B Cr.P.C. was, however, extended to her.

2. Brief facts of the case, as per contents of FIR, are
that the complainant alongwith another police official
was present on checking duty at the platform of Railway
Station Jehangira. At the time of arrival of train

(Rahman Baba 48DN) at 1050 hrs, besides other
passengers, a woman was sitting on a bench. On query,
she disclosed her name as Rubina w/o Ghulam Murtaza
(present appellant). A white colour bag was lying with
her on the bench. Upon checking, two packets of charas
were recovered lying inside the bag. The accused-
appellant was taken to reporting room and the high-ups
were informed accordingly and on their arrival, her
personal search, through a lady constable, led to
recovery of four more packets of charas from her worn
jacket. Each packet turned out to be of 1200 grams, thus,
total 6 packets, weighing 7200 grams, of contraband
were recovered from the accused-appellant. She was
arrested and FIR ibid was registered accordingly.

3. On completion of investigation, complete challan
against the accused-appellant was submitted in Court
where she was charge-sheeted, however, she pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution in order to
prove its case, produced and examined as many as six
witnesses whereafter statement of the accused was
recorded, wherein, she professed her innocence.

4. The learned Trial Court, after conclusion of trial,
found the appellant guilty of the charge and, while
recording conviction, sentenced her as mentioned above.
Feeling aggrieved, the appellant has filed the instant

appeal before this Court
5. Arguments heard and record gone through.

6. Allegation against the appellant is that, 7.2 kgs of
charas were recovered from her bag, when she was
waiting for the train.

7. Perusal of record of the instant case unfolds that
the occurrence took place at 1050 hrs whereas murasila
was received in the police station at 1730 hrs, after a
considerable delay of about 7 hours which went
unexplained. Astonishingly, the record further suggests
that all the investigation was conducted before lodging
of FIR.

8. It is alleged by the prosecution that complainant/
PW-4 recovered two packets of contraband from the bag
of accused-appellant lying at bench at a public place in
presence of one Shaida Muhammad Constable, but
surprisingly, said constable neither made witness to the
recovery memo nor was produced during trial in support
of the version. The situation not only hits Article 129(g)
of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984, but also hint at the
legal inference that if said witness was entered into the
witness box, he would have not supported the
prosecution’s version. It is also evident from the record
that no independent witness has been associated with the
recovery process. Even, the complainant/PW-4 did not

bother to associate other police officials as witnesses,
present in said police post, as is clear from the statement
of PW-3/SHO. We are afraid to note that the
complainant himself stood one of the marginal witness
to the recovery memo (Ex.PW3/2). Same is the position
of PW- 5/Salma, the 2" marginal witness thereto.

9. Generally, any railway station is always crowded
with passengers etc. Some people arrive, while some
people wait to depart. This fact went unattended during
trial that when the complainant left the checking point
and proceeded towards the accused-appellant whether
anyone else was present for checking of other passengers
or not. In the stated situation, it also does not appeal to
the prudent mind that why the accused-appellant was
sitting in a visible bench near the checking point, having
narcotics hidden in bag as well as in worn jacket. When
the purpose was clear and the consequence well-known,
why the accused-appellant kept/hidden the narcotics
separately.

10. So, far as recovery of 04 packets of charas from
the worn jacket of the accused-appellant is concerned, in
this respect the cross examination of PW-3 is very
important and necessary to be gone through. It seems
that this witness was having butterflies in his stomach.
The relevant portion(s) is reproduced below for ready

reference:
“XX.....It is correct that the Banyan/jacket bears
no FIR number nor any date. It is correct that
such like jackets are usually available in
markets....... The accused remained in our
custody till her handing over to women police
station Peshawar. I have not produced the
accused facing trial for obtaining her police
remand/custody. It is correct the Ex.PW-3/6 is in
my hand writing but I did not produce myself the
accused facing trial before the Court of Judicial
Magistrate, and was produced by Muhambar
Khan SI before the Illaqa Magistrate...... It is
correct that in the calendar of witnesses the name
of Muhambar Khan is not mentioned. It is
correct that the bag bears the name of the
accused, Fir number and section of law but not
the date of occurrence. It is correct that in the
statement of HC Nasir Khan nowhere it is
mentioned that at which point the accused body
search was made nor it has been mentioned in his
statement recorded by me _ that separate
management was made for her body search........
We are having two female police constables
deputed at Railway Police Post Nowshera. At the
time of receiving information I was not
accompanied by lady constable Mst.
Salma...... No one except the accused facing trial
was present on the spot....... No information
except the two packets already recovered from
the possession of the accused was given to us.
Only lady constable was present at the time of
making body search of the accused facing trial
and was made inside the help centre...... The
constable Salma, produced to me the remaining

recovered contraband.

11. Be that as it may, suffice it to say that when the
officials who recovered the contraband themselves stood
the witnesses then, the controversy remained unresolved

that who substantiated their versions qua the separate
recoveries made by them from the accused-appellant.
Guilt of any accused is not only required to be supported
by the testimony of complainant but also required to be
substantiated by other unimpeachable, irresistible,
circumstantial and independent evidence. Unfortunately,
the present case badly lacks such evidence. Statement of
PW-3 and the facts depicted from the record suggest that
the recovery, in the mode and manner, as narrated by the
prosecution seems to be seriously doubtful and not
appealable to the general prudence, rather concocted and
fabricated.

12. Moreso, statement of PW-3 also does not transpire
that to whom he handed over the case property and
samples for keeping the same in safe custody. PW-1

deposed during course of trial that;

“During the days of occurrence I was posted as
Moharrir in Police Station Railway Peshawar
Cantt. On receipt of murasila sent by Javed
Khan Inspector/SHO through Khalid Nawaz
constable NO. 398. I correctly incorporated its
contents in the shape of FIR. Today I have seen
the FIR Ex.PA which is correct and correctly

bears my signature.”

Whereas PW-6 deposed in the following

manner;

“During the days of occurrence I was posted as
Moharrir in Police Post-Railway Nowshera. On
27.03.2019, I sent 06 parcels/samples to FSL for

chemical examination through constable
Muhammad Yaseen No. 228. In this respect I
received Raseed Rahdari/road certificate which

is Ex.PW-6/1.”

The statements of above mentioned important witnesses
suggest that PW-1 has not received any case property
with the murasila. Statement of PW-6 also does not
suggest that from whom he received the samples for
handing over to Muhammad Yaseen # 228/PW-2.
Therefore, in the situation explicit manipulation with the
case property and samples cannot be ruled out. The
learned trial Court totally ignored this important aspect
of the case and blindly held the accused-appellant
responsible for the episode.

13. There is no record or any assertion that the
samples and case property were ever kept in Malkhana.
Had it been, the Register No.19 would have been
produced and, at least, the relevant page having the
entry, exhibited. In the scenario, the safe custody of the
samples and case property is not proved. We are
forfeited to seek guidance from the case law reported in
2019 SCMR 608 wherein it was held by the apex Court

that;

“In a case where safe custody of the
recovered substance or _ safe
transmission of samples of the
recovered substance was not proved
by the prosecution through
independent evidence, it could not be

concluded that the prosecution had
succeeded in establishing its case
against the accused beyond

reasonable doubt’.

Similar views have also been taken by the apex court in

2018 SCMR 2039, & 2019 SCMR 903.

14. The record is further suggestive of the fact that the
contraband was recovered on 23.03.2019 and samples
were received in FSL on 27.03.2016, with a considerable
delay of 4/5 days. Such delay was, however, not

explained by the prosecution during trial. In case titled

“Tkramullah and others Vs the State reported in 2015

SCMR_1002” it has also been held by the apex Court

that;

“No such police official was
produced before Trial Court to
depose about safe custody of
samples entrusted to him for being
deposited in office of Chemical
Examiner---Prosecution was not
able to establish that after alleged
recovery of substance so recovered
was either kept in safe custody or
that samples were taken from
recovered substance had safely been
transmitted to office of Chemical
Examiner without the same being
tampered with or replaced while in
transit---Prosecution failed to prove
its case against accused persons

beyond reasonable doubt”
Likewise, in case reported in 2012 SCMR 577 it has
also been held by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan

that;

“Although prosecution sought to

corroborate testimony of recovery witnesses

with report of Forensic Science Laboratory

to the effect that contraband item recovered

from secret cavities were charas, yet

sanctity of report of Laboratory was eroded

by evidence of official who could not be

correctly reply as to where samples

remained between the dates when those

were allegedly taken into possession from

car and the date those were received by

Forensic Science Laboratory ”.
15. In present case, where the recovery is doubtful
and safe custody of the recovered substance as well as
samples thereof is not established by the prosecution
through cogent evidence, there it cannot be said with
confidence that the prosecution had proved its case
against the accused-appellant beyond reasonable doubt.
16. Keeping in view the contradictions on certain
material points occurred in the statements of PWs and
handling of the contraband as hinted above created
serious doubts in the prosecution case qua its recovery

and safe custody, which suggests that occurrence has not

taken place in the mode and manner as alleged by the
10

prosecution. Wisdom can be derived from the case law
reported in 2019 SCMR 608.

17. The above discussion has led this Court to believe
that the learned trial court has erred in appreciating the
case evidence in its true perspective. It has been held,
time and again by the superior courts, that a slightest
doubt occurs in the prosecution case is sufficient to
acquit an accused. For extending the benefit of doubt, it
is not necessary that there should be many circumstances
creating doubts. Single circumstance, creating
reasonable doubt in the prudent mind about the guilt of
accused, makes him entitled to its benefit, not as a matter
of grace or concession, but as a matter of right. Reliance
could be placed on 2009 SCMR 230, 2011 SCMR 664,
2011 SCMR 646, 1984 PLD SC 433, 2012 MLD 1358,
2007 SCMR_ 1825, 2008 P.Cr.L.J_ 376, 1994 PLD
Peshawar 114, 2012 PLD Peshawar 01, 1999 P.Cr.L.J
1087, 1997 SCMR_ 449, 2011 SCMR 820 & 2006
P.Cr.L.J_SC_ 1002. The conclusions drawn by the
learned trial Court are not borne out of the case
evidence, therefore, the impugned judgment is not
sustainable.

18. For what has been discussed above, it is termed
that prosecution built its case on sand and made bricks

without straw. Therefore, while extending benefit of
11
doubt to the appellant, we have no hesitation to accept
the instant appeal. Consequently, the appeal in hand is
allowed, the impugned judgment is set aside and the
appellant is acquitted of the charge levelled against her.
She be set at liberty forthwith, if not required to be
detained in any other case.
19. Above are the reasons of short order of even date.
