JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- This appeal under section
417 Cr.P.C., filed by Khyber Khan son of Haji Gulfat
Khan, calls in question the legality and propriety of
judgment dated 10.02.2004 of learned trial Court/ Sessions
Judge, Nowshera, whereby he acquitted Shahid Zaman, the
accused-respondent, in case FIR No.266 dated 10.07.1987,
registered under section 302 PPC at Police Station Aza
Khel, District Nowshera.

2. As per contents of FIR (Exh.PA)/report of
complainant Muhammad Ishfaq, on the fateful day he had
gone to the house of his relative, namely, Ghawar. At
10.15 hours, when on report of commotion he came out

from the house and inquired about the commotion from the
accused/respondent standing on the roof of his house
armed with rifle, he opened fire at him; as a result, he got
hit. Asghar Khan, brother of complainant is stated to have
witnessed the occurrence. On the report of deceased then
injured, initially FIR mentioned above was registered
under section 307 PPC, but on the next date he succumbed
to injuries in LRH, Peshawar, hence, section 307 PPC was
converted into 302 PPC in the FIR.

3. Autopsy on the dead body of the deceased was
conducted on 10.07.1987 by Dr. Khalid Mehmood
(PW.10). He noticed a single firearm entry wound on right
inguinal region with corresponding exit on left buttock of
the deceased. His stomach was found empty and healthy.
As per opinion of the doctor, cause of death of the
deceased was severe shock and bleeding leading to
pulmonary embolism and pulmonary infarction due to
injuries to his blood vessels and pelvic region caused by
firearm.

Habib ul Haq S.I (PW.2) conducted investigation
in the case. He proceeded to the spot and prepared site plan
ExhPW.2/1, recorded statements of the PWs u/s 161
Cr.P.C., took into possession the bloodstained last worn
clothes of the deceased, sent the same to the FSL, report
whereof is Exh.PW.32/4 and initiated proceedings under
sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. against the

accused/respondent. Later on, accused/respondent was
arrested and supplementary challan was submitted against
him before the learned trial Court, where he was tried and
ultimately acquitted vide impugned judgment, hence, this
appeal.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record perused.

5. The prosecution has relied upon the ocular account
furnished by purported eyewitness Asghar Khan. His
statement was got recorded as PW.1, during trial of the
accused under section 512 Cr.P.C.. Since at the time of
trial of the accused, he had died, therefore, his statement
was transposed. The prosecution has also relied upon the
testimony of Mst. Zarsheda (PW.1), as well as dying
declaration of the deceased.

6. A look over the testimony of Mst. Zarsheda
reveals that she is not the eyewitness of the occurrence as
she has categorically stated in her statement that after the
occurrence she noticed the deceased in injured condition in
a street, who told her that he had been fired at by the
accused. Though, testimony of PW Asghar, is in line with
the story mentioned in the FIR, however, site plan and
medical evidence negate the same. In the site plan
Exh.PW.2/11, the accused has been shown on the roof top
of house of accused at point No.5, having height of more
than 10-1/2 feet. The deceased has been shown at point

No.2 i. in front of the house of Ghawar. If height of an
average man is added with the height of aforesaid roof, it
will come to 15/16 feet. In such eventualities, direction of
firearm entry wound on the person of the deceased should
have been from upward to downward but contrary to
above, the deceased has sustained firearm entry wound in
the pubic region with corresponding exist on his left
buttock depicting travel of missile as through and through.
Neither any crime empty nor any blood have been shown
recovered from the spot despite the fact that according to
post mortem report the cause of death of the deceased is
profuse bleeding, hence, this aspect further makes the
prosecution case highly doubtful. Ghawar whose house had
been allegedly visited by the deceased and the purported
eyewitness has not been examined. Similarly, no inmate of
his house has been produced as a witness in support of
establishing the presence of the deceased and the purported
eyewitnesses at the spot. According to FIR, the occurrence
has taken place at 1015 hours, which has been reported at
1045 hours in Police Station. As per medico legal report,
the deceased then injured had been shown received in the
hospital at the aforesaid time of report i.e. 1045 hours. The
presence of the deceased then injured at the same time on
two different places is quite astonishing, which not only
speaks volumes about the behavior and demeanor of the
police but also that of the Medical Officer. As per prosecution

version, report about the occurrence was made at Police
Station by the deceased then injured which was recorded
by Shaukat Ali SHO (PW.7). Not only the facts that who
brought the deceased then injured to the hospital and who
accompanied him to Police Station, are shrouded in
mysteries, but the scriber of FIR has also failed to note
down a single word in the FIR that deceased then injured
was conscious and perceiving the surroundings at the time
of making report. Again, when allegedly shifted to the
hospital, the deceased then injured was examined by
Casualty Medical Officer, but the alleged dying declaration
of the deceased then injured, does not bear the endorsement
of any medical Officer to the effect that he was conscious,
well oriented in time and space and capable to make
statement. Similarly, medico legal report of the deceased
then injured is also silent about the factum of his
orientation in time and space and his capability to make
statement. For believing a dying declaration, inter alia, one
of the essential ingredient is that the prosecution shall
establish through cogent evidence that the dying man was
in full senses, conscious and alert to the surroundings, was
fully oriented in space and time and was able to make a
coherent statement and the doctor present at the occasion
shall give a fitness certificate about the condition of a
dying man, but such is not the case herein. Besides, the
essential ingredients/requirements under rule 25-21 of the

Police Rules,1834, have not been complied with before
recording the alleged dying declaration of the deceased
then injured. For the sake of convenience and ready
reference the aforesaid rule is reproduced below:-

25-21 Dying Declaration:- (1) A dying
declaration shall, whenever possible, be
recorded by a magistrate.

(2) The person making the declaration shall, if
possible, be examined by medical officer with
a view to ascertaining that he is sufficiently in
possession of his reason to make a lucid
statement.

(3) If no magistrate can be obtained, the
declaration shall, when a gazetted police
officer is not present, be recorded in the
presence of two or more reliable witnesses
unconnected with the police department and
with the parties concerned in the case.

(4) If no such witnesses can be obtained
without risk of the injured person dying before
his statement can be recorded, it shall be
recorded in the presence of two or more police
officers.

(5) A dying declaration made to a police
Officer should, under section 162, Code of
Criminal Procedure, be signed by the person
making it.

7. In view of the above discussed doubtful
circumstances, we are of the firm view that the incident has
not taken place in the mode and manner as alleged by the
prosecution, rather in some other mode, which on the face
of record, is shrouded in mystery. It is universal principle
of criminal justice that dying declaration by itself is not

strong evidence being not tested by way of cross-
examination. The only reason for accepting the same is the
belief phenomenon of the Court of law that a person
apprehending death due to injuries, caused to him, is
ordinarily not expected to speak a false hood. To believe or
disbelieve a dying declaration, is thus left to the ordinary
human consideration, however, the courts always insists
upon strong, independent and reliable corroboratory
evidence for the sake of safe dispensation of justice.
Relying blindly and without proper scrutiny on a dying
declaration, would be no less dangerous approach on the
part of the Courts.

8. In this case, neither the First Information Report
nor the medical evidence nor other circumstances, much
less strong, independent and reliable, corroborate the
alleged dying declaration; therefore, the alleged dying
declaration of the deceased has rightly not been relied upon
by the learned trial Court. The prosecution evidence is
pregnant with doubts, contradictions and discrepancies
benefit of which has rightly been extended to the
accused/respondent by the learned trial Court. The cardinal
principle of criminal administration of justice is based on
the concept of justice in Islam which is to be observed
more consciously and carefully. Benefit of doubt features
appearing in the case invariably are required to be given
full effect while deciding the ancillary matters in a criminal

case. Benefit of doubt, if any favourable to the accused
cannot be withheld in the exercise of discretion of the
Court.

9. Moreover, it is also settled law that when an
accused is acquitted by a competent court of law he earns
the presumption of double innocence which cannot be
disturbed by the appellate Court unless it is established
through cogent and tangible evidence available on record
that such acquittal is fanciful, erroneous or has resulted into
grave miscarriage of justice. Guidance derived from the
judgments of Hon’ble Supreme Court reported in 2004
SCMR 249, 2009 SCMR 288 and 2009 SCMR 946.

10. For what has been discussed above, the trial court
was completely justified in acquitting the
accused/respondent of the charge. We find that the findings
recorded by the trial court are absolutely just and proper
and in recording the said findings, no illegality or infirmity
has been committed. Resultantly, this appeal is hereby
dismissed.
