Secondly, Mst. Ulfat Bibi knowingly that she

Thirdly, accused Farhad Khan after

Mst. Ulfat Bibi, supported the statement of Wasif

Zaib PW-1. PW-3 Nawab Said is the real brother of

the accused/Appellant Mst. Ulfat Bibi, who has

back his sister was married to Wasif Zaib. PW-4
Nawab

-3-

Muhammad Badshah who is Taxi driver and he has
been given the role to the extent that he driven away
accused/Appellant Mst. Ulfat Bibi from her house to
a place known as Sabsezai Mandi Mardan. PW-5
Muhammad Umar who is close relative of the
accused/Appellant Farhad Khan and _ he
accommodated the accused in his house. PW-6 Fazal
Ghafoor Khan ASI, who has obtained permission for
initiation of an inquiry U/S 156 (3) Cr.P.C through
an application Ex. PW-6/1, recorded statements of
the prosecution witnesses under sections 161 & 164
Cr.P.C. He has collected the record pertaining to the
CDR data and Nikah-Nama (Ex. PW-3/1) in between
Wasif Zaib and Mst. Ulfat Bibi was taken into
possession vide recovery memo. PW-7
Lal Shehzada, who is police official being witness to
the recovery memo Ex. PW-7/1. PW-8 Arshad Iqbal

THQ  Chakdara who has’ examined the

file as Ex. PW-9/1. PW-10 is Dr. Rehana Medical

Officer THQ Chakdara, who has examined the
Nawab

-4-

accused/Appellant Mst. Ulfat Bibi. According to her
report Ex. PW-10/1 she has given the following
opinion:-

“She has conducted intercourse. She was
pregnant for a period of 8 weeks and 6
days. According to ultrasound report
period of gestation was of two months.
Nothing case said about the date of
intercourse”

PW-11 is Akbar Ali Khan Judicial
Magistrate Chakdara, who has recorded confessional
statement of the accused/Appellant Farhad Khan,
which appears on pages No. 45 & 46 of the
proceedings of trial Court as Ex. PW-11/2 while
certificate is Ex. PW-11/3.

4. After closure of the prosecution evidence,

accused/Appellants were separately examined under

section 342, Cr.P.C, wherein they denied the

charges, posed innocence and stated to have falsely

been implicated in the case. They however wished to

produce no defence, not to examine themselves on

oath as required under section 340(2), Cr.P.C.

5. Evidence of the prosecution entailed

Judicial prudent mind of the Presiding Officer of the
Nawab

-5-

Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zila
Qazi Chakdara, therefore sentences thought for were
passed.

6. Having heard arguments of the learned
counsel for the accused/Appellants, learned counsel
for the complainant and learned A.A.G, record gone
through with their assistance.

7. We have noticed that the
accused/Appellant Farhad Khan has been charged for
enticing away accused/Appellant Mst. Ulfat Bibi to
contract an unlawful marriage with her, therefore the
offence is covered U/S 365-B PPC. The charge was
framed but in contrast accused/Appellant Mst. Ulfat
Bibi was charged to have contracted an unlawful
marriage with co-accused/Appellant Farhad Khan,
thereby charge within the meaning of section 494
PPC was framed against her. Under the 3" head of
the charge accused/Appellant Farhad Khan has been

further arraigned U/S 493-A PPC that he has
Nawab

-6-

co-habitated with Mst. Ulfat Bibi through deceitful

means of a lawful marriage.

8. In compass very closely observed that

as far as prosecution evidence which pertains to levy

of section 365-B PPC and are clear in our mind that

the element of Section 365-B which is a perquisite

condition that after a woman is kidnapped or

abducted with intent that she may be compelled or

knowing it to be likely that she will be compelled to

marry any person against her will, in order that she

may be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse, it

invites a punishment for imprisonment for life with

fine.

9. Here forceful illicit intercourse in between

the accused/Appellants is lacking, as after the

recovery the statement of Mst. Ulfat Bibi recorded

under section 161 Cr. P.C does not signal her

abduction or elsewhere has been subjected to illicit

intercourse. There is no kidnapping or abduction as
Nawab

-7-

all the witnesses of the prosecution are silent to this

effect.

10. If at all depositions under section 494 PPC

against the accused/Appellant Mst. Ulfat Bibi were

to be proved, the prosecution at least the

Investigating Officer should have brought any

evidence to the effect that from 25.10.2014 till the

accused/Appellants were arrested they had

contracted an unlawful marriage. Either some

witnesses should have been examined or at least the

Nikah-Nama to that effect in black & white would

have been part of the evidence.

11. The last charge against the

accused/Appellant Farhad Khan is that he abducted

Mst. Ulfat Bibi and co-habitated with her through

deceitful means for a lawful marriage. Coming to the

statement of PW-10 Dr. Rehana Medical Officer

THQ Chakdara, although she has formed an opinion

that Mst. Ulfat Bibi has conducted intercourse and

she was pregnant for a period of 8 weeks and 6 days,
Nawab

-8-
but there were no signs of fresh intercourse as she
plainly stated in her medical report that she could not
give the exact date of intercourse.

12. There is confusion about the pregnancy
report that if at all Mst. Ulfat Bibi was found
pregnant for 8 weeks and 6 days, on the calculation
from the date 03.11.2014 on which date she was
examined for her medical checkup. By the said date
ie. 3.11.2014 she might have got pregnant
approximately on 1“ September, 2014. Nikah-Nama,
Ex. PW-3/1 pertaining to the marriage of the
complainant Wasif Zaib and his wife Mst. Ulfat Bibi
was prepared on 28.9.2014 and it was registered on
30.10.2014. It suggest that the accused/Appellant
Mst. Ulfat Bibi was even pregnant prior to her
consummation with her husband a month earlier.
Obviously, this pregnancy is not during the time
when it is as asserted that Mst. Ulfat Bibi was

kidnapped on 25.10.2014.
Nawab

13. Coming to the confessional statement of
the accused/Appellant Farhad Khan, in this respect
statement of Akbar Ali Khan Judicial Magistrate
Chakdara was recorded as PW-11. His cross-
examination is of paramount importance. This
witness deposed in his cross-examination as under:-

25) US ty sang 2 set 98 ple AS os Cun pa ag"
Ex. PWI/1 1 eX cal Capead (9S 3 9S sinal Gly LS Gul
"we id ga os Ex. PW-11/36

As far as_ identification of the
accused/Appellant before the Judicial Magistrate is
concerned, the same has also been doubted. There is
no cavil with the legal proposition that while
evaluating the confessional statement main object of
law is to ensure the voluntariness and truthfulness of
the statement. It would be a right place to mention
here that a greater duty is casted upon the Magistrate
recording confession to be satisfied that such
confession is voluntarily made and to that end he
must make an inquiry before recording the

confession.
Nawab

-10-

14. No doubt, conviction can be based on the

retracted confession alone but if it is found

voluntary, true and confidence inspiring. Honourable

Supreme Court in a case titled Bahadur Khan _ys.

The State (PLD 1995 S C 336) it has been held that

"retracted confession has to be accepted only if it is

corroborated by clear, cogent and independent

evidence’. Court is called upon to act upon a

retracted confession to enquire into all the material

points and surrounding circumstances and satisfy

itself fully that the confession cannot but be true."

In such state of affairs, it can safely be

held that the so called retracted confession was

neither voluntary nor true. In the instant case, the

very voluntary nature and truthfulness of the

retracted confession is under cloud, so, no reliance

can be placed on the same.

15. Regarding the golden principle of benefit

of doubt, reference can be made to the celebrated

judgment of the apex Court title "Muhammad
Nawab

-l1ll-

Luqman Vs. The State (1970 S.C.-10), where the

Hon'ble Bench have observed that:-

"It may be said that a finding of guilt
against an accused person cannot be
based merely on_ the _ high
probabilities that may be inferred
from evidence in a given case. The
finding as regards his guilt should be
rested surely and firmly on the
evidence produced in the case and
the plain inferences of guilt that may
irresistibly be drawn from that
evidence. Mere conjectures and
probabilities cannot take the place of
proof. If a case where to be decided
merely on_ high probabilities
regarding the existence of non-
existence of a fact to prove the guilt
of a person, the golden rule of
"benefit of doubt" to an accused
person, which has been a dominant
feature of the administration of
criminal justice in this country with
the consistent approval of the
superior Courts, will be reduced to a
naught".

16. The dicta laid down in the above

precedent has been re-enforced by the august Supreme

Court in the cases of Tariq Parvez Vs. The State

(1995 SCMR-1345), Muhammad Khan and another

Vs. The State (1999 SCMR-1220) and Muhammad

Akram Vs. The State (2009 SCMR-230).

17. In view of the above, we do not hesitate to

accept this appeal, set aside the conviction and
Nawab

-12-

sentences recorded by the learned trial Court. Ergo

acquit the accused/Appellants from the charges

levelled against them in the present case. They shall be

released forthwith, if not required in any other case.

By our short order of even date, we had

accepted the appeal and acquitted the

accused/Appellants. Hereinabove are reasons for the

same.

Announced.
