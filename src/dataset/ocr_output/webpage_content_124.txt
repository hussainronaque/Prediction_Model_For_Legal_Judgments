            By
this order, I intend to dispose of Cr. bail applications No. 258 and 348 of
2008 filed by applicants Rind and Shabir, in crime No. 11 of 2008 of police
station Sarhad.
            Case of the prosecution is that on 3.2.2008
when complainant alongwith his cousin Hidayatullah and nephew Kambar Ali was
sitting in his house, both these accused persons along with their six more
companions named in the FIR, duly armed with weapons entered into his house and
on account of some dispute previously happened, on the instigation of applicant
Rind, accused Yaseen fired with K.K. on complainant with intention to kill him
which hit on his forehead and accused Zahoor fired with K.K. on the wife of
complainant Mst. Zareena, who also received injuries. Accused Mitho and Sher
also gave hatchet blows to complainant’s wife,
who subsequently succumbed.
            It is contended by learned counsel for applicant
Rind that only allegation against this applicant is of instigation to other
culprits who caused injuries to the complainant and his wife. Referring to
report of AIGP CR & Investigation, Sukkur region made on 15.3.2008 to the
AIGP (Investigation), Karachi,  it is contended
by learned counsel that AIGP CR & Investigation, Sukkur in his report
observed that the case is false and frivolous and has recommended for disposal
of it as cancelled case. But further papers in the matter show that it was not
accepted by the learned Magistrate, therefore, challan was submitted. 
            It
is further contended by learned counsel that the versions of complainant and
prosecution witnesses, who are said to be in company of company at the time of incident,
are contradictory to each. According to complainant incident took place in his house
whereas P.Ws. Hidayatullah and Kambar are not confident as to the place of
happening of incident. In first part of their 161 CrPC statements, it was deposed
that incident took place at the house of complainant whereas in second part of
their statements, they deposed that incident took place in their respective
houses. If statements of all three persons are considered it create confusion
as to the place of incident, which make-out a case of further enquiry.
            Learned
AAG opposing the grant of bail to applicant Rind stated that he was absconder,
therefore, is not entitle for the grant of bail, but this  argument of learned AAG in view of date of
arrest of applicant on 14.2.2008 i.e. after about 11 days of incident does not
have any weight therein.
            So
for as the case of applicant Shabir is concerned, though in the FIR specific
role of him alongwith co-accused Mitho causing hatchet injuries to complainant’s wife is there, but according to learned counsel for
applicant Shabir, as per medical report injury No.4 has been disclosed as cause
of death of Mst. Zareena. It is stated by him that in presence of two persons
it is hard to say that the said injury was caused by whom. Formally it can be assumed
that it was common intention of both applicants, but in view of contradictory
version of complainant and his witnesses about place of incident at this stage
and having no evidence of recovery of crime weapon, no definite opinion against
to any person can be formed.
            Accordingly,
these bail applications are allowed. Applicants are allowed to be released on
bail subject to furnishing solvent surety in the sum of Rs.500,000/-(Five lacs)each
with P.R. bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of learned trial Court.

Mr.

            Applicant, who has furnished surety on
behalf of accused Roshan and others in protective granted to them by this
Court, has prayed for return of surety papers stating that accused after
obtaining protective bail have surrendered themselves before  the Sessions Court at N. Feroze and have
been admitted to bail before arrest, therefore, these papers are no more
required. 
            Learned
AG has no objection.
            Surety
papers be returned to surety subject to proper verification.
