Dilabaz Khan
Vs

The State and another.

JUDGMENT
Case FIR No.165 dated 27.6.2023 under sections
302/34 PPC of PS Kakki, District Bannu.

Date of hearing . 05.9.2023
For petitioner:- | Mr. Anwar-ul-Haq, Advocate.

For State:- Mr. Umer Qayum Khan, AAG.
For respondents:- Mr. Faroog Khan Sokari, Advocate.

FOR OK
FAZAL_SUBHAN, _J.-_ Through instant petition, the

petitioner Dilbaz Khan alias Dilabaz Khan seeks his post
arrest bail in the above referred case.

2. Brief facts of the case as per contents of FIR
are that on 27.6.2023 at 20:10 hours complainant
Muhammad Ibrar while present with dead body of his
nephew Khushnood Ali Khan, lodged report, at DHQ
Hospital Bannu to the effect, that on the day of occurrence a
scuffle took place between one Musawar Khan son of

Dilabaz Khan and deceased Khushnud Ali Khan. Thereafter
Musawar Khan went to his house while he (complainant)
along with Khushnud Ali Khan went towards an under
construction house and were busy in construction work. In
the meanwhile Dilbaz Khan (the present petitioner) and
absconding co-accused Wajahat Khan, at about 18:45 hours
came duly armed with Kalashnikovs and started firing at
Khushnud Ali Khan with the intention to commit his murder,
resultantly he was hit and got injured, whereafter accused
managed to decamp from the spot. Motive for the offence
was described to be scuffling between Khushud Ali Khan
and Musawar Khan (son of the petitioner). He shifted the
injured but he succumbed to his injuries while being shifted
to the hospital. The complainant, therefore, charged the
petitioner and his co-accused for the murder of deceased
Khushnud Ali Khan.

3. With this background of the case arguments of
learned counsel for the parties and learned AAG for the State
heard and record scanned through.

4. From the assertions in the FIR, it is clear that
petitioner and absconding co-accused are directly charged
for firing upon the deceased Khushnud Ali Khan in a
promptly lodged report. It is a day light occurrence and

the parties being co-villagers are known to each other,
hence there is no chance of mistaken identity. During
investigation, the I.O recovered blood through cotton
from the place of deceased, 4 empties of 7.62 bore from
the place of co-accused coupled with positive FSL report.
The site plan shows that at the relevant time of
occurrence, the deceased was present at point No.1
which is stair case while petitioner was at point No.3 a
place inside the under construction house and point B is a
spot wherefrom a spent deshaped bullet was recovered,
hence prima facie the presence of spent deshaped bullet
shows that it could be fired from point-3. The non-
recovery of empty from point-3 has been explained by the
investigation officer in the site plan.The medical evidence
is also in line with the prosecution story and established
the unnatural death of deceased. Thus presently
reasonable grounds exist to believe that the petitioner is
prima facie connected with the offence, which is
punishable with death or imprisonment for life, hence on
merits, the petitioner is not found to be entitled to
concession of bail. |

5. The petitioner has taken plea of alibi
alleging to be not present on the spot at the time of

occurrence and in this respect he moved an application
alleging his innocence, however, for the time being he
has not produced any convincing evidence to support his
plea of alibi. Though the plea of alibi if taken at the
earliest shall not out rightly be rejected, but that varies
from case to case and keeping in view the attending
circumstances of the present case, determination of the
genuineness of the plea of alibi by this court at this
stage may cause prejudice to either side, which is not
desirable, particularly while hearing post arrest bail
petition and hence better be left for the determination of
trial court. Reliance in this respect can safely be placed

on case titled “Jhsanullah-Vs-State” reported in PLJ

1999 Cr.C (Lahore) 387” [D.B], wherein it was held

that:-

“We refrain from discussing deeper
merits of the case including the finding |
of innocence recorded in favour of the
above mentioned accused persons, lest it
might cause prejudice to them at the trial.
Suffice it to observe that the petitoners’
plea of alibi is oral and was supported by
some shop-keepers of the Adda who were
interrogated by the I.O/DSP_ in May,
1997, more than one year after the
occurrence. It cannot be preferred at this
stage over the eye-witness account
furnished by Akhtar Ali, complainant,
Muhammad Arif, Abdur Rahman and
Muhammad _ Siddiq, who in _ their
statements recorded under Section 161 of
the Cr.P.C. fully implicated the petitoenrs
c

6.

and supported the prosecuton story
narrated in the FIR. It is true that the plea
of alibi can be considered at the bail
stage as held in the case of Ch.

Muhammad Shafi vs. Ch. Muhammad —

Anwar Samma and another (1975 SCMR
219) and Muhammad Azam vs. Khalid
Javed Gillan etc (1981 SCMR 734).
However, weight to be given to the plea

of alibi at bail stage depends upon the ©

quality of material brought on the record
in each case. If the pela of alibi is
promptly raised and is supported by

reliable material then it can be safely

made basis for grant of bail.”

In light of the available record, the petitioner

is prima facie found connected with the offence, which

falls within the prohibitory limb of section 497 Cr.P.C,

disentitling him to the grant of bail.

7.

For the reasons, mentioned herein above, this

bail petition is dismissed.

Announced.
