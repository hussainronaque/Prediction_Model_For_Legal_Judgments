JUDGMENT.

Ms. Raazia Gul, advocate for State,

WAQAR_ AHMAD SETH, J:- Accused-petitioner

Shams-ur-Rehman seeks post arrest bail in case FIR
No.538 dated 20/07/1999 under sections 302/324/34 PPC
registered at Police Station, Badaber District Peshawar
which was refused to him by the Courts below

2- Briefly stated the facts of the case are that on
20/07/1999 at 06.40 hours Jamil Khan brought his nephew
Samiullah aged about 10/11 years in an injured condition to
the casualty of LRH, Peshawar where he lodged the report to
the effect that on the same day at 06.00 hours he alongwith
his nephew Samiullah were present in the house, when in
the meanwhile accused Zareef Khan alongwith his brothers
Shamsur Rehman and Lais Khan duly armed with deadly
weapons came there and started firing at them as a result of

which his nephew Samilullah sustained injuries while he
escaped unhurt. Motive is stated to be the land dispute.
Besides the complainant the occurrence is stated to have
witnessed by Sher Rehman and Tilawat Khan. Subsequently
on the following day the injured succumbed to his injuries in
the Hospital.

3- | have heard the learned counsel for the parties and
have also gone through the record with their able assistance.
4- Before releasing the accused on bail, the Court is
required to apply its mind keeping in view the provisions
contained in subsections (1) and (2) of section 497 Cr.P.C.
in its totality and the sine qua non for releasing an accused
on bail is that the Court should come to the conclusion that
there are no reasonable grounds to believe that he has
committed a non-bailable offence as provided in subsection
(1) of section 497 Cr.P.C. or to prevent the abuse of the
process of Court or to do justice, keeping in view the
particular facts of each case. The bail in the case of
commission of a non-bailable offence and particularly falling
in the prohibitory clause in subsection (1) of section 497
Cr.P.C. is not to be granted as a matter of course, with the
simple sentence that it is a case of further inquiry and without
keeping in view the entire provisions of section 497 Cr.P.C.
5- It is settled principle of law that at bail granting stage
the material available on record is to be sifted through in

order to establish whether prima face the petitioner before
the Court can be connected with the crime in question and
hence, no detailed inquiry is to be made by the Court.

6- It is, undoubtedly, within the discretion of the
competent criminal Courts to grant bail to the accused, even
in appropriate murder cases. They are, however, under
heavy duty to exercise their discretion fairly, justly and
properly which, in any case, should be based on good
grounds to meet the ends of justice. The appreciation of
evidence and the drawing of conclusions therefrom in
relation to all the circumstances is the function exclusively of
the trial Court. It cannot be anticipated by a superior Court
dealing with an ancillary matter i.e. the grant of bail pending
trial.

7- Perusal of the record reveals that the accused-
petitioner has been directly charged in the promptly lodged
FIR for the murder of deceased Samiullah. The version of the
complainant has been fully supported by the medical
evidence, recovery of blood stained earth and recovery of, 20
empties of 7.62 bore from the spot. Moreover, the
occurrence has taken place on 20/07/1999 and the accused-
petitioner went into hiding and was arrested in the case on
29/10/2014 after more than fifteen years for which no
plausible explanation has been given by him. Warrant under
section 204 and proclamation under section 87 Cr.P.C. were

issued against him and ultimately he was proceeded against
under section 512 Cr.P.C. by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-Il/JSC, Peshawar vide his order dated 12/06/2001. No
justifiable reason for his non-appearance in the trial of his co-
accused has been furnished by the petitioner. The petitioner
surrendered himself only after recording acquittal of his co-
accused. The order of acquittal of co-accused was concluded
with the following finding qua the petitioner:-

“As a prima facie case exists
against absconding co-accused namely
Shamsur Rehman, so he is hereby
declared as_ Proclaimed Offender.
Perpetual warrant of his arrest be
issued against him and the quarter
concerned be directed to enter his
name in the list/registers of P.Os. Case
property be kept intact till the
arrest/trial of the aforesaid absconding

accused”.

8- The evidence recorded in absence of an accused
could not be used against him and fate of such an accused is
to be decided on the evidence recorded in his presence.
When the evidence recorded in absence of an accused
cannot be used for his conviction the same can also not be
used for the benefit of that accused. In this regard the case
of “Sardar....Vs....The State” (P_L_D 1979 Peshawar 16

can advantageously be reproduced as below:-
“Accused '__ petitioner remaining
outlaw after occurrence for about
eight years and his trial to be held
independently of previous _ trial
resulting in acquittal of his co-
accused----Contention that other
accused in case’ having’ been
acquitted and evidence being same in
both cases, petitioner exonerated
from charge of murder---Held: Not
correct----Acceptance of contention
amounts to examining of witnesses in
petitioner’s case as a matter of mere
formality or there being no need to
examine such witnesses for reasons
of such evidence having already been
taken into consideration in previous
case and such course not permissible

in law---Bail application rejected.”

9- The abscondance may be either deliberate or due to
lack of knowledge about the registration of the case or may
be due to the fear of Investigating Agency or for any other
just cause. The superior judiciary has time and again
considered the factum of abscondance in a number of cases.
There are cases wherein concession of bail is refused to an
absconder when the Court arrived at a conclusion on
tentative assessment from the available record that
abscondance was wilful and noticeable, however, there are

cases wherein the accused are allowed _ bail on making
tentative assessment of the prosecution evidence and
ignoring the factum of abscondance for reasons. This
practice that an accused went into deliberate abscondance to
wait for the result of co-accused trial and surrender only
when under-trial co-accused earned acquittal is highly
deplorable and cannot be allowed, the concession of bail
which shall amount granting permission on the mockery of
law. Allowing concession of bail to a wilful absconder would
create a sense of insecurity among people and disturbance
in the society and offenders shall prefer abscondance after
the commission of offence and shall surrender only when
acquittal of an under arrest accused is recorded. No outlaw
deserves the concessionary relief which could be extended
to those who surrender before law. In the instant case the
accusea-petitioner deliberately avoided his arrest, although
he was well-aware of the charge against him as his real
brother Zareef Khan co-accused was arrested and put on
trial. The petitioner was waiting for the result of the trial of his
co-accused and when he earned acquittal he surrendered
himself. The conduct of the petitioner speaks of his guilty
mindedness and he cannot be given benefit of his
abscondance on the sole ground of acquittal of the co-
accused and this type of conduct of the petitioner would be

sufficient to disentitle him for the concession of bail.
10-  Resultantly, this bail petition is dismissed. However,
the trial Court is directed to conclude the trial expeditiously
but not later than two months. Office is directed to send the
record to the quarter concerned immediately.

Needless to observe that the above observations are
tentative in nature and the trial Court shall not be influenced,
in any manner, while deciding the case.

JUDGE
8- In writ petition No.2114-P/2013 respondent-
husband has challenged the judgment and order of both
the courts below in respect of dower of half share of the
house mentioned in the heading of the plaint. While in
writ petition No.2266 filed by petitioner-wife, she has
challenged the judgment of the appellate court whereby
the decree passed by trial court in respect of house
No.121 Street No.12 Sector F-8 Phase-VI, Hayatabad
Peshawar was modified to the extent that instead of half
share in the house as dower, the market price thereof is
decreed in her favour. While in writ petition No.2265 she
seeks the constitutional jurisdiction of this court and
questioned the judgment of both the courts below with
regard to non-payment of ten tolas golden ornaments as

dower.
10

9- It is contended by the plaintiff-wife that her
nikah was performed with defendant-husband in
consideration of tolas gold ornaments, half share of her
house and Rs.2000/- as maintenance allowance. In
support of her claim she produced three witnesses. She
appear as P.W.1 and given the detail of execution of
nikahnama Ex.PW-1/1 and affidavit Ex.PW-1/2.
Rehmatullah and Wazirzada were examined as PW-2
and PW-3 respectively. Both the witnesses have
supported the contents of nikahnama and categorically
stated that it was executed in her favour. Defendant-
husband was examined as DW-1. He stated that nikah
between the spouses was performed orally and an
affidavit was executed before nikah between the parties.
He stated that half share of the house was given to the
plaintiff in lieu of dower which is situated in his village
District Karak. He further stated that ten tolas of gold
ornaments were fixed as dower out of which five tolas
was prompt and remaining five tolas as deferred. He
admitted his signature on the affidavit Ex.PW-1/2. In
cross examination he showed his ignorance about the
fact that whether the nikan was oral or in writing. He also

could not disclose the name of the witnesses in whose
11

presence nikah was performed. Though he denied the
execution of nikahnama and contended that she
annexed bogus and tempered documents with her plaint
and made tempering in nikahnama. But from the record,
it reveals that the defendant miserably failed to prove
that she had made any tempering in the nikahnama or
prepared bogus documents. Though, in his statement he
admitted the dower and share in the house which was
given to her in lieu of her dower which is situated in his
native village but such stance is not mentioned in the
written statement. It is settled law that parties can not go
beyond the pleadings. Thus, his evidence is not
admissible. The defendant-husband himself admitted his
signature on affidavit Ex.PW-1/2. He has not been able
to prove any tempering in the nikahnama. While plaintiff-
wife has proved the nikahnama through oral and
documentary evidence. In the nikahnama Ex.PW-1/1 the
name of Rehmat Ullah and Amir Daraz Khan are
mentioned in its column No.8. Plaintiff produced both
these witnesses as PW-2 and PW-3. Defendant also
admitted the presence of these PWs at the time of nikah.
In column No.13 to 17 of nikahnama the detail of dower

is mentioned which included half share in the house
12

situated in Hayatabad, ten tolas gold ornaments and
Rs.2000/- per month as maintenance allowance.

10- In writ petition No.2114-P of 2013
respondent/defendant contended that it is clear from the
pleading of the parties and supporting documents
annexed thereto that dower claimed by plaintiff-wife is of
deferred category and could be claimed only in case of
dissolution of marriage by death or divorce, but this
material fact has been overlooked by both the courts
below, which amounts to departure from evidence and
not permissible under the law and rules governing the
subject. These arguments were rebutted by learned
counsel for the plaintiff-wife and contended that the
dower has great significance in the contract of marriage
in the Islamic society. It was obligatory upon the
husband to pay dower to the wife happily. According to
learned counsel, the question of paying of dower happily
in the eventuality of dissolution of marriage by divorce
did not arise, in as much as the parties were afflicted
with bad feelings against each other, therefore, no
husband would pay it happily at the time of divorce.
Hence according to the learned counsel, the whole

dower has to be paid on demand. He also contended
13

that dower is a gift given by the bride grown to the bride.
That Holy Quran is silent on two type of dower i.e.
prompt and deferred dower. He relied on sura Al-Nisa V
4.4 of Holy Quran and sated that according to the
command of Allah “SWT given in the Holy Quran (Sura
Al-Nisa, V.R.4) read as under:-

“At the time of marriage, give the women their dowers
willingly as an obligation; but if they, by their own free
will, give up to you a portion of it then you may enjoy it
with pleasure “. Record shows that during the course of
trial respondent-defendant submitted an application for
deletion of part B from the suit pertaining to deferred
dower being pre-mature in view of section 290 of
Muhammadan Law. This application was contended by
plaintiff and the learned trial court vide order dated
12.7.2010 while relying in 2006 YLR-33 dismissed the
application by holding that dower whether prompt or
deferred was inalienable right of wife and after
consummation same would become vested right for a
wife at that time. This order has not been challenged by
the respondent-husband. At appellate stage he had
challenged the order/judgment dated 15.3.2012 on the

sole score that the same is liable to be set aside, as the
14

right of further cross examination and production of
additional evidence was illegally struck off by the trial
court. In appeal, he has not challenged the order dated
12.7.2010. Now, through this constitutional petition, he
challenged it. First, we want to see whether the dower
fixed in favour of wife was prompt or deferred. As
discussed above, the plaintiff-wife has been able to
prove the contents of nikahnama Ex.PW-1/1 which has
got much authenticity then any other documents. The
detail of dower is given in para No.13 and 17 of the
Nikah Nama. Here we deem it proper to reproduce the
relevant para of the Nikahnama (Para No.13, 14, 15, 16

and 17) as under:--
15

With regard to the dowered house, it is not mentioned
that it is deferred. In para No.16 it is clearly mentioned
that share of 7 marlas house situated at phase No.VI F-
8, Hayatabad, Peshawar has been given. Only in
respect of ten tolas gold ornaments, five tolas has been
declared as prompt and five tolas as deferred and it is
cleared from record that no decree in respect of golden
ornaments has been given. The respondent-husband
has not been able to prove his contention. So far the
contention of plaintiff-wife in Writ Petition No.2266 of
2013 with regard to the decree of market value (price) of
the half share in house no.121 Street No.12 Sector F-8,
Phase-VI, Hayatabad, Peshawar is concerned, learned
counsel for the petitioner at the very outset stated at the
bar that he does not want to press the writ petition
because plaintiff is ready to receive the market price of

the house noted above instead of its half share.

11- Petitioner-wife filed writ petitionNo.2265 to
the effect that both the courts below have erred in not
passing the decree of gold ornaments weighing 10 tolas
claimed by her in the suit. From the perusal of plaint, it

reveals that no such relief of ten tolas gold has been
16

claimed by the plaintiff in the heading of the plaint and in
the last para the plaintiff seeks only the grant of relief
which has been claimed in the heading of the plaint.
Both the courts below have rightly confined themselves
to the decree/relief as claimed for and refused to grant
decree for gold ornaments which has not been alleged
by the petitioner/plaintiff.

12- In view of the above discussion, we hold that
the petitioners have not been able to substantiate their
claim in their respective writ petitions. The findings of
both the courts below on the basis of evidence are not
amenable in the writ jurisdiction. The High Court in
exercise of its extra ordinary jurisdiction under Article
199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan,
1973 can neither substitute findings of facts recorded by
courts below nor give its opinion regarding adequate
evidence. Such matter should be decided by courts
below vested with jurisdiction to decide them.
Assessment of evidence is the function of Family Court
which is vested with exclusive jurisdiction to decide
matter. No misreading or non-reading of evidence by
courts below was pointed out by the counsel for the

petitioners. The concurrent findings of courts below
17

cannot be successfully assailed in writ petition. Thus, all
the three writ petitions being without force are hereby

dismissed.
