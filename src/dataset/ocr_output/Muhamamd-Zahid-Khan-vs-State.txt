ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:-Accused Zahid Khan,
Rasheed Khan, Kashif Khan and Ramzan Khan, were
jointly tried by learned Additional Sessions Judge/Judge
MCTC, Mardan in case FIR No.368 dated 29.10.2014,
registered under sections 302/34 PPC, at Police Station
Rustam Mardan, on conclusion whereof, accused
Muhammad Zahid having been found guilty of committing
murder of his wife Mst. Tabasum, has been convicted
under section 302(b) PPC and sentenced to undergo
imprisonment for life and to pay Rs.4,00,000/-, as
compensation to LRs of the deceased in terms of section
544-A Cr.P.C. and in default thereof to undergo 01 year

S.I., however, co-accused Rasheed Khan, Kashif Khan and
Ramzan Khan, have been acquitted vide judgment dated
20.07.2019.

2. The instant appeal has been filed by convict
Muhammad Zahid Khan against his conviction and
sentence. Jawad Khan petitioner has filed Cr.R. No.
179-P/2019, seeking enhancement of sentence of convict
from life imprisonment to normal penalty of death as
provided for the offence. He has also filed Cr.A.
No.998-P/2019, against acquittal of co-accused, named
above.

3. As, all the three matters are the outcome of one
and the same judgment of the learned trial Court dated
20.07.2019, therefore, we propose to decide the same
through this common judgment.

4. Appellant Muhammad Zahid Khan is the husband
of Mst. Tabasum Begum. Acquitted co-accused, namely,
Rasheed is the brother of appellant Muhammad Zahid
whereas acquitted co-accused Ramzan Khan and Kashif
are the sons of co-accused Rasheed.

On 22.10.2014 at 1900 hours, appellant
Muhammad Zahid in company of dead body of his wife
Mst. Tabasum Begum deceased reported to police in DHQ
hospital Mardan to the effect that deceased was married to
him some twenty years back. On the night of occurrence an
altercation took place between him and the deceased on

some domestic affairs, during which course he slapped the
deceased on which she annoyed and did not talk him entire
night. At morning he left for Mardan and at 3.00 p.m when
returned home he noticed his deceased wife laying in
unconscious condition on a cot (charpai). He with the help
of his brothers and other people shifted her dead body to
the hospital. He did not charge anyone for murder of his
wife and disclosed that smell of wheat preservation pills
from the mouth of the deceased shows that she has
committed suicide. His report was incorporated in daily
diary No.7 dated 22.10.2014 by Zahoor Khan SI (PW.5).
He prepared injury sheet and inquest report of the deceased
Exh.PW.5/1 and Exh.PW.5/2, respectively and shifted her
dead body to the mortuary for postmortem examination. As
the cause of death of the deceased was unknown, therefore,
during postmortem examination contents from stomach
and liver of the deceased were taken by the Medical
Officer. Inquiry under section 174 Cr.P.C. was initiated by
Muqadam Khan SHO (PW.3), who visited the spot and
prepared site plan Exh.PB and vide recovery memo
Exh.APW.3/1 he took into possession the contents of
stomach and piece from liver of the deceased preserved by
the Medical Officer during postmortem and sent the same
to Forensic Medicine MMC Mardan.

5. On 29.10.2014, Jawad Khan (brother of the
deceased), recorded his statement under section 164

Cr.P.C. before the learned Judicial Magistrate, wherein he
charged the appellant and acquitted co-accused for murder
of his deceased sister by administering her poison,
resultantly, FIR mentioned above was registered against
the accused. Sher Bahadur SI (PW.9), arrested the
accused/appellant and issued their arrest card Exh.PW.9/2,
obtained their physical custody, interrogated them and
recorded their statements under section 161 Cr.P.C. He
also placed on file the Forensic Medicine report as
Exh.PK/1 and on completion of investigation handed over
case file to SHO for submission of challan against the
accused.

6. On receipt of challan by the learned trial Court, the
accused/appellant were summoned, tried and ultimately,
convicted and sentence the appellant as mentioned above,
however, acquitted the co-accused named above vide
judgment impugned herein.

7. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record perused.

7. It appears from record that no one has furnished
ocular account of the occurrence. Jawad Khan (PW.8),
brother of the deceased is also not the eyewitness of the
occurrence. No doubt, in his statement recorded under
section 164 Cr.P.C. on 29.10.2014, he has directly charged
the appellant and co-accused for murder of the deceased,
but has not disclosed the source of information on the basis

of which he got satisfied about culpability of the accused.
The only circumstance on the basis of which he charged
the appellant is the motive which he has furnished in his
statement that from the wedlock of his deceased sister and
the appellant three daughters have born while they were
having no male child. The appellant used to blame her for
not giving birth to a male child which was a perpetual
cause of altercation between them. He also advanced
another motive that the appellant had eloped with another
woman and the deceased was not allowing him to get
marry her, on which the appellant used to beat her.
However, on thorough search of record an iota of evidence
was not found in support of the above mentioned
contentions of PW Jawd to prove the alleged motives.

8. FSL report Exh.PK/1 in respect of stomach and
liver contents of the deceased sent to Laboratory were
opined by the analysts that “the stomach and liver samples
are analyzed and found Negative for poison/drug”. The
negative FSL report squarely shatters the entire prosecution
case built on the testimony of Jawad (PW.8). No direct and
circumstantial evidence is available on file to prove the
guilt of the accused upto the hilt beyond shadow of
reasonable doubt.

9. It appears from the record that two other sisters of
the complainant, namely, Mst. Azra Begum and Mst.
Najama are married to Muhamamd Aslam and Rasheed,

respectively, who were living in the same house jointly.
Initially statement of the above named two ladies were
recorded by the Investigation Officer under section 161
Cr.P.C., but during trial they were abandoned. Jawad PW.8
was cross-examined about the stance of inmates of the
house i.e. his sisters and brothers-in-law who replied in the
following manner:
“Tt is correct that I have five sisters and one brother
besides my deceased sister. It is also correct that my
sister Najma and Azra Begum are married in the
same house to accused Rasheed Khan and
Muhammad Aslam. It is correct that my sisters and
other brother Amanat had not charged the
accused........ ,
“It is correct that my sisters Najma Begum
and Azra had recorded their statements under section
161 Cr.P.C. before the local police where they stated
that the deceased committed suicide and that Jawad
complainant/PW is only pressurizing them for
transferring of their ancestral property in his name. The
witness added that in fact the police had wrongly
recorded their statements and they have not recorded

such statements.”

Besides, the conduct of the appellant i.e. shifting the
deceased to the hospital and reporting there to police about
the occurrence by furnishing the actual story as well as his
participation in the entire funeral ceremony of the deceased
being a natural conduct of a responsible husband, speaks

about his innocence. Had his hands smeared with the blood
of his deceased wife, he would have never shifted her to
the hospital, rather would have absconded. This being the
case of no evidence, the learned trial Court has erred in law
by recording conviction of the appellant on mere
presumptions and conjectures which exercise is un-
warranted in criminal justice system. Resultantly, this
appeal is allowed. Conviction and sentence of the appellant
recorded by the learned trial Court through impugned
judgment is hereby set-aside. Resultantly, he is acquitted
from the charge leveled against him. He be set at liberty
forthwith, if not required in any other case.

10. On acquittal of the convict, the connected Cr.R.
No.179-P/2019 filed by Jawad Khan, has become
infructuous which is hereby dismissed.

11. Similarly, Cr.4. No.998-P/2019, against acquittal

of co-accused being meritless is hereby dismissed.
12. These are reasons of our short order of even date,
which is reproduced below:-

“For reasons to be recorded later, we allow
this appeal, set-aside the conviction and
sentence of appellant-convict Muhammad
Zahid Khan son of Ameer Ullah, recorded by
the learned Additional Sessions Judge/Judge
MCTC, Mardan under section 302(b) PPC,
vide judgment dated 20.07.2019, in case FIR
No.368 dated 29.10.2014, under sections
302/34 PPC, at Police Station Rustam and
hereby acquit him of the charge in the cited
case. He be set at liberty forthwith, if not

confined in any other case.
