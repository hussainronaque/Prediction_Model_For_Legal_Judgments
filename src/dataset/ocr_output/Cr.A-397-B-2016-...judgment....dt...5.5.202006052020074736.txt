SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.--- The State through

Advocate-General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, assailed the
judgment dated 29.06.2019, rendered by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-IV/ Judge Special Court, Lakki
Marwat, whereby the accused/ respondent Imran involved
in case F.LR No. 167 dated 26.04.2014, charged under
section 9 (C) CNSA, Police Station Pezu, district Lakki
Marwat was acquitted of the charges.

2. Brief facts of the case as per F.I.R are that
complainant Muhammad Javed Khan, ASI, received spy
information regarding smuggling of huge quantity of
narcotic through a motorcar, when he alongwith other

police nafri was present on the picket at Indus Highway,

-2-

meanwhile a motorcar bearing No. PH/733 Islamabad,
came from Bannu side, which was signaled to stop, but
the driver accelerated the motorcar, which was chased.
After covering some distance the motorcar was found
parked near the mountain. One person deboarded from the
motorcar and make his escape good, while other person
sitting in the motorcar was apprehended, who disclosed
his name as Imran son of Muhammad Ayub r/o Karri
Marwat Tank and the name of other person, who escaped
as Naseer Muhammad son of Mumtaz r/o Umar Adda. On
checking 18200 grams chars were recovered from a gas
cylinder which was fixed in the dickey of said motorcar.
Accused was arrested, murasila to this effect was drafted
and sent to the Police Station through constable Alamgir
No.603, where the contents of murasila were culminated
into above mention F.I.R.

3. On completion of investigation complete
challan was submitted against the accused before the
learned trial Court, where after fulfilling codal formalities
under section 265-C Cr.P.C formal charge was framed
against the accused, to which he pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. The prosecution in order to prove gilt of
accused/ respondent produced and examined five
witnesses, on close of prosecution evidence, statement of
accused/ respondent was recorded under section 342
Cr.P.C, wherein he professed innocence. The accused/

respondent neither wished to produce defence nor opted

-3-

to be examined on oath under section 340(2) Cr.P.C.
Learned trial Court after hearing arguments of learned
counsel for the parties, vide impugned judgment dated
29.06.2016, acquitted the accused/ respondent, hence, the
instant appeal.

4. Accused/ respondent was summoned
repeatedly, but as per report of process server, he has
proceeded abroad. As, this appeal cannot be kept pending
for an indefinite period, arguments of learned Addl: A.G
representing the state heard and record perused.

5. Owing to spy information the complainant
alongwith police Najri laid picket on the Indus Highway,
where they saw the motorcar bearing registration No. PH-
733, Islamabad coming fast. It was signaled to stop, but
the driver accelerated the speed and was chased, where
after covering some distance it was found parked on the
roadside, whereas a little ahead in the mountain the driver
was running. The police Nafri chased the driver, but he
could not be overpowered, so they approached back the
motorcar and found a person sitting in the front seat. On
inquiry the person sitting therein disclosed his name as
Imran son of Muhammad Ayub r/o Kirri Marwat, District
Tank and divulged that the ran away accused was Nasir
Muhammad son of Mumtaz r/o Umar Adda, District
Tank. The complainant searched the motorcar and found
chars in the gas cylinder fitted in the dickey of the car,

which on weighment came out to be 18200 grams. The

-4-

accused was arrested and on arrival of the Investigating
Officer the site-plan was prepared at the instance of the
complainant and eye-witnesses.

6. The complainant was examined as PW-03,
who stated that after receiving information he alongwith
six others reached to the spot a little early and found the
car coming with enormous speed and after it was signaled
to stop it went ahead with accelerated speed and was
chased through his Alto/ Suzuki motorcar. The statement
of the complainant is a little disturbing that how an Alto
motorcar could accommodate seven police officials duly
armed with weapons, including him and that when the
motorcar was signaled to stop and it did not, how in the
shortest span of time all the seven boarded the motorcar
and chased the vehicle containing narcotics. This is
astonishing that the distance between the place where the
picket was laid and the place where the motorcar was
parked when the driver deboarded and ran away was
stated to be one kilometer. It troubles a little when the
complainant stated that, when they reached they found the
motorcar parked with the driver missing if this deposition
of the complainant is accepted then there was ample
opportunity for both the driver and the front seater /
respondent to run away; and that why the accused /
respondent could not get the benefits when allegedly the
police Nafri was chasing the driver in the mountain. If we

accept the testimony of the complainant to be correct then

-5-

we can presume that either the respondent was not present
in the motorcar or he was not in the knowledge regarding
the narcotics.

7. The complainant further stated that on their
arrival near the motorcar he recovered the narcotics from
the gas cylinder fitted in the dickey. It adds a little to our
worries that how without the pointation of the respondent
the complainant went straightaway to the dickey and
recovered the narcotics without searching rest of the
motorcar. It was further stated that the gas cylinder was
removed by all seven and was placed on the ground where
after with the help of instruments i.e. screw driver it was
opened and the recoveries were effected. Ayub Khan SI
was examined as PW-05, who stated that when he reached
near the motorcar he found the gas cylinder intact in the
dickey and without dislodging it the recovery was
effected. The complainant stated that the weighment was
made with the help of a digital scale lying in his motorcar,
whereas the Investigating Officer stated that he himself
made the weighment with the help of a manual scale by
using different bots.

8. The prosecution case runs with
abnormalities that despite the fact the police officials were
armed with sophisticated weapons but they did not resort
even to areal firing to compel the decamping accused to
stop and apprehend and we are surprised that why an open

opportunity was extended to him to leave the scene. The

S

-6-

witnesses ran with glaring contradictions and
improvements and they never remained consistent on
material points of the case. In this respect reference can be
made to PW-04 Kaleemullah who on every step went to
improve the prosecution story when was confronted
thoroughly with his 161 Cr.P.C statement. PW-04 stated
that he disclosed the details of the quantity of each packet
to the Investigating Officer and that he also stated in his
statement that it was he who informed the Investigating
Officer that the murasila was taken by one Alamgir from
the spot to the Police Station. He went on to say that the
Investigating Officer prepared the site-plan at his instance
but when his 161 Cr.P.C statement was taken into
consideration nothing of these details were found therein.
The witnesses went on conscious improvements with the
sole purpose to connect the respondent with the narcotics
by all means. The seizing officer stated that he made the
recoveries on his own and not on the pointation of the
respondent meaning thereby that the respondent was not
in the knowledge of the narcotics in the motorcar and his
conscious knowledge could not be established.

In case titled Muhammad Mansha Vs. The

State (2018 SCMR 772), it was held that:-

“Once the Court comes to the
conclusion that the eye-witnesses had
made dishonest improvements in their
statements then it is not safe to place
reliance on their statements. It is also
settled by this Court that whenever a
witness made dishonest improvement
in his version in order to bring his

-7-

case in line with the medical evidence

or in order to strengthen the

prosecution case then his testimony is

not worthy of credence. The witnesses

in this case have also made dishonest

improvement in order to bring the

case in line with the medical evidence

(as observed by the learned High

Court), in that eventuality conviction

was not sustainable on the testimony

of the said witnesses”.
9. This was left unresolved as to whose
ownership the motorcar was, the Investigating Officer did
not collect anything on record which could tell of the
background of the motorcar and its owner. The
Investigating Officer when came to the witness box stated
that when the respondent was investigated, he divulged
that the chars belonged to one Naseer Muhammad,
Asghar and Yousaf, but the Investigating Officer despite
these information did not array them as accused nor the
case was investigated on these lines. The witnesses went
on telling nothing but lie as the complainant stated that at
the time of recovery he photographed the motorcar and
the process of recovery, but when the Investigating
Officer was asked regarding this particular aspect of the
case, he blatantly refused to have been provided with any
photographs. The lack of interest of the Investigating
Officer can be gathered from the fact that he did not try
to consult the concerned Excise and Taxation Office, so

that to know that who was its original owner. One of the

devastating aspect of the case is that neither the motorcar

-8-

nor the gas cylinder wherefrom the recoveries were
effected was exhibited.

10. The narcotics was recovered on 26.04.2014
and so the application was addressed to the Director
Forensic Sciences Laboratory but the test samples were
received to the laboratory on 06.05.2014 ie. after a
considerable delay of 10-days. The Investigating Officer
was questioned time and again regarding the remaining
case property and its safe custody, who initially stated that
he did not know that where was it lying but later on stated
that it was lying in the custody of the Moharrir of the
concerned Police Station. This is admitted on record that
neither the statement of the Moharrir was recorded nor an
abstract from register No.19 was collected and placed on
the record. The official who was deputed to take the test
samples to the laboratory was not examined when so the
recovery, its safe custody and its smooth transmission to
the Forensic Sciences Laboratory could not be established
beyond reasonable doubt and this piece of evidence loses
its worth and cannot be taken into consideration, as a
reliable piece of evidence against the respondent. We are
convinced that dispatch of the of the test samples from the
Police Station to the Forensic Sciences Laboratory has not
been established in the way and in the manner as is
commanded by the law, hence, the FSL report so

collected cannot be accepted and relied upon.

In case titled Kamran Shah and others Vs.

The State and others (2019 SCMR 1217), it was held that:

It is not disputed that the narcotic
substance recovered in this case had
been recovered from some secret
cavities of a vehicle in which the
present appellants were travelling at
the relevant time as passengers and the
said vehicle was being driven by Saeed
Ahmed co-convict. It was, _ thus,
incumbent upon the prosecution to
establish conscious possession of the
contraband substance on the part of the
present appellants but no evidence
worth its name had been brought on the
record in that respect. The record of
the case shows that safe custody of the
recovered substance at the local Police
Station had not been established by the
prosecution during the _ trial.
Muhammad Afzal, Moharrir (PW3) had
been produced by the prosecution
before the trial Court but he had said
nothing about receipt of the case-
property or its safe custody by him.
Even safe transmission of the samples
of the recovered substance from the
local Police Station to the office of the
Chemical Examiner had not been
proved by the prosecution.

11. The Control of Narcotic Substances Act,
1997 has provided stringent punishment for those
involved and also the law enforcing agencies have been
put under a heavy responsibility to bring solid and
material evidence against the accused and even the
laboratories concerned have been provided a mechanism
which they are to follow while analyzing the test samples.
The law as well as the apex Court time and again
emphasized that while dealing with the test samples and
preparing the reports on its strength, the concerned

laboratories are under heavy obligation to adhere to the

-10-

procedure in this respect and especially to specify the
protocols of the test applied and this is the duty of the trial
Courts to examine the contents of report and to assess its
evidentiary value.

In case titled Ikramullah_and_others Vs.

The State (2015 SCMR 1002), it was held that:-

“We have particularly noticed that the
report submitted by the Chemical
Examiner (Exhibit-P.W.2/5) completely
failed to mention the basis upon which
the Chemical Examiner had come to a
conclusion that the samples sent to him
for examination contained  charas.
According to Rules 5 and 6 of the
Control of Narcotic Substances
(Government Analysts) Rules, 2001 a
complete mechanism is to be adopted by
the Chemical Examiner upon receipt of
samples and a report is then to be
submitted by him referring to the
necessary protocols and mentioning the
tests applied and their results but in the
case in hand we note that no protocol
whatsoever was mentioned in the report
submitted by the Chemical Examiner
and no test was referred to on the basis
of which the Chemical Examiner had
concluded that the samples sent to him
for examination contained charas”.

12. It is turning to be a common practice with the
Investigating Officers that they are lacking their interest to
collect the material evidence in the cases and even no heed
is paid to collect the daily diaries from the police stations
regarding the arrival and departure of all concemed with
the investigation of a particular case, as these are the
documents which can correctly explain the status of the
witnesses, their presence at the spot, the time they consume
in reaching to the spot and the names of police officials

who accompany. If these documents are brought on record,

-ll-

the Investigating Officer will lose the courage to
manipulate the cases in police stations. In the present case,
when the Investigating Officer was questioned regarding
the arrival and departure from the police station to spot, he
blatantly answered that he did not place on record the daily
diary in this respect. His this lack of seriousness tells
nothing but to stamp him as an interested witness and his

testimony cannot wholeheartedly be relied upon.

In case titled Pir Noroz Ali Shah Vs. The
State (2019 P.Cr. L.J. 457 [Peshawar (Abbottabad

Bench)], it was held that:

In order to establish the movement of
police officials through confidence
inspiring evidence, the production of
daily diary of the police Station
showing the departure, constitution of
raiding team, its members and
subsequent arrival, was a_ material
piece of evidence in favour of
prosecution. Indeed the daily diaries
are maintained under the erstwhile
Police Rules 1934. Under Rule 28.48 it
is mandatory for every police official to
make entry of his departure, arrival
and all proceedings conducted between
the intervening period of departure and
arrival. Non-production of the daily
diary has caused serious doubts in the
prosecution case regarding the mode
and manner of raid.

13. The recovery so effected could not get
support from both ie. the complainant and the
Investigating Officer as they stated that the recovered
narcotics was consisting of slabs and that it was chars
pukhta but when the case property was produced before

the trial Court, on request of the learned counsel for the

-12-

respondent it was opened, where on one hand some of the
seals were found broken, whereas on the other it was in
pieces, this contradiction further disputes the veracity of
the witnesses on one hand and the identity of the
recovered narcotics on the other, when such was the state
of affairs then it was hard for the learned trial Court to
convict the respondent.

14, Besides the above, generally the order of
acquittal cannot be interfered with because the
presumption of innocence of the accused is further
strengthened by acquittal. The golden thread which runs
through the web of administration of justice in criminal
cases is, that, if two views are possible on the evidence
adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the
accused and the other to his innocence, the view which is
favourable to the accused should be adopted. The
paramount consideration of the Court is to ensure that
miscarriage of justice is prevented. A miscarriage of
justice which may arise from acquittal of the guilty is no
less than from the conviction of an innocent. In a case
where admissible evidence is ignored, a duty is casted
upon the appellate Court to re-appreciate the evidence in a
case where the accused has been acquitted, or the purpose
of ascertaining as to whether the accused committed the
offence or not. The principle to be followed by this Court
considering the appeal against the judgment of acquittal

is, to interfere only when there are compelling and

-13-

substantial reasons for doing so. If the impugned
judgment is clearly unreasonable, it is a compelling
reason for interference.

15. For the reasons mentioned hereinabove, this
appeal being without merit and substance is hereby
dismissed.

Announced.
