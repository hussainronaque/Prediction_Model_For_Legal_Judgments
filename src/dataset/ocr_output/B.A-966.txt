JUDGMENT

Dr. Khurshid Iqbal, J.-

1 Through this single order, I intend to
dispose of instant bail petition as well as the connected
B.A No. 968-M/2022, as both have arisen out of one

and the same FIR.

2. Facts shortly are that on 23.11.2022, the
complainant Usman Ullah reported to the local police
that during the night between 22-23/11/2022, at
unknown time, his three shops, situated in Pataw
Bazaar, within the criminal jurisdiction of Police
Station Sahib Abad, District Dir Upper, were put on
fire. Resultantly, the goods (shoes and cloths) lying
inside the shops were completely burnt. He stated that

he “firmly believes” that the offence in hand has been

committed by Nazim (Nizam Ullah), Amir (Amar
Ullah) and Suhrab Khan, residents of Pataw of Tehsil

Wari, District Dir Upper, the petitioners/ accused.

3. I have heard arguments of learned counsel
for the parties and the learned Assistant Advocate

General, for the State and perused the record.

4, No doubt, there could be no eye witness
of the commission of the offence in hand. Needless to
say, the offence was reported to have been committed
during the night between 22 and 23.11.2022 at
unknown time. Despite this, the contention of the
complainant that he firmly believes that the petitioners/
accused have committed the offence, is not prima facie
supported by any source of such information. In a
murder case, titled as Mst. Nooran Bibi alias Bano v.
The State and another reported as 2014 P Cr. LJ 237
[Lahore], it has been held that involvement of an
accused person for the commission of an offence by a
complainant on the basis of “firm belief” could not be
taken as an admissible piece of evidence. The reason
the learned Court has mentioned is that such a
statement is a speculation about the involvement of the

accused,

5. The record further shows that statement of
the Chowkidar of the market has not been recorded.
Moreover, there is nothing on the record to show that
structures of the shops have been damaged as only the
goods lying inside the shops were stated to have been
burnt. Reliance is placed on Noor Muhammad v. The
State (1993 P Cr. LJ 2522). Yet another relevant
aspect is the vicarious liability of the petitioners/
accused in the circumstances of the case. Such liability
is to be determined at the trial stage as to how they
conspired for the commission of the offence in hand.
This aspect is further strengthened from the statements
of two persons, namely, Naseerullah and Badshah
Islam, which show that the petitioner/accused Suhrab
Khan purchased some petrol for using it in a chainsaw
to cut certain trees. These statements create a scope of

further inquiry.

6. In view of the above, the petitioners/
accused are entitled to the concession of bail.
Resultantly, the instant bail petition as well as the
connected B.A No. 968-M/2022 are allowed. The
petitioners/accused be released on bail, provided they
furnish bail bonds in the sum of Rs. 100,000/- (one

hundred thousand) each with two sureties each in the

like amount to the satisfaction of the learned trial

Court, who shall ensure that the sureties are local,
reliable and men of means. The observations recorded
hereinabove are purely tentative in nature and should,
in no way, prejudice an independent mind of the

learned trial Court during the course of trial.

7. These are the reasons of my short orders

of even date.
