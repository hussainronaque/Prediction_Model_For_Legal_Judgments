under Article 199 of the Constitution of
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973
(constitution) the petitioner has prayed for as

"It is therefore humbly prayed

2. Record reveals that the respondent

maintenance, dowry articles, possession of
house and perpetual injunction and whereas

money against the present petitioner. The
parties, after attendance filed written

desired evidence, where-after, the learned trial

dated 08.09.2020 decided the case as
following: -.

3. Aggrieved from the said judgment
and decree, the respondent filed family appeal
No.44/FC of 2020 which was_ partially
accepted and the impugned consolidated
judgment & decree dated 08.10.2020 was set
aside to the extent of prayer Daal & Ray
regarding the landed property measuring 03
Marlas and the plaintiff/wife may approach
proper forum for such relief, whereas rest of
the findings of the learned trial court were
maintained, hence the petitioner filed this writ
petition.

4. Arguments of learned counsels for
petitioner and learned counsel for respondent
heard and record gone through.

5: Learned counsel for petitioner
vehemently objected to the validity of the
procedure adopted by the Family Courts while
recording statements of the parties during pre

and post reconciliation proceedings and
contended that the statute has prescribed any
such procedure and therefore the procedure
adopted by the Family Courts in this regard
has no legal backing and value. He contended
that decree of 3 tolas golden ornaments was
passed against the petitioner on the sole
ground of admission made during pre-trial
reconciliation proceedings, hence, the same
needs to be strike down. Regarding the decree
in respect of dowry articles it was contended
that respondent claimed her dowry articles in
the suit and during trial the Family Court
deputed bailiff of the court and whatever
dowry articles were present in the room, these
were handed over to her, hence, awarding
decree of missing articles, being not part of her
claim could not be granted to the respondent.

6.Learned counsel for respondent defended
the judgments of the two courts below and
submitted that suit of the respondent was

rightly decreed in her favour, hence, being
based on correct appreciation of record cannot
be disturbed.

ds The arguments of learned counsel for
petitioner, to the extent of recording of
statements of the parties at the time of
reconciliation proceedings, was duly
considered in its legal perspective. Section
10(3) of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act,
1964 (Act) prescribed a procedure for the
Family Court to attempt and bring a
reconciliation between the parties. Though law
has not made it incumbent upon the court to
record statements, however, it does lay a
procedure to narrow down the controversy
between the parties. The words “court shall
ascertain the point at issue between the
parties” has a much wide implication and
therefore Family Court can adopt any
procedure to find out the actual dispute
involved in the case. Through the said
provision Family Court has to make all-out

efforts to effect compromise between the
parties, to meet the very purpose of
expeditious disposal of matrimonial affairs as
enumerated in the preamble of the Act, and
therefore, when, as a result of such efforts a
possibility of amicable solution to the dispute
is expected then Family Court may record the
statement of the parties. On the other hand, if
such efforts end in failure the court shall have
a clear vision of the controversy at hand.
Keeping in view these aspects of the case in
mind, this court, in the case of “Dr. Fakhr-ud-
Din Vs Mst. Kausar Takreem and another’,
reported in PLD 2009 Peshawar 92
specifically in Para 33 and 38, has held that;

33. Before parting with this
judgment, we deem it essential to
hold that the obligations of
Family — Courts/Qazis while
exercising powers under the
proviso to section 10(4) of the
Family Courts Act have now been
increased manifold. They shall
have to make all-out efforts to
conduct the proceedings in a
professional investigative manner

while probing the subject matter
and shall strive to discover the
truth as to who amongst the
spouses is at fault and that
meaningful attempts must be
made to preserve the marriage
because in an Islamic Welfare
State, a family is a primary unit,
any sort of disturbance therein or
its frequent break up would
destabilize the society as a whole.
Peaceful and happy union
between spouses would serve as a
linchpin for the peaceful and
healthy society as a whole. In
view of the radical changes
introduced through the proviso,
the reconciliation efforts now to
be conducted must bear fruits.
Careless dispensation and casual
approach on the part of the
Family Court Judges in this
regard would increase the
incidents of dissolution of
marriage on the basis of ‘Khula'
which would be — counter-
conducive and detrimental to the
society at large and any evils
would surge out there from.

38. It is emphatically directed that
minutes of the reconciliation
efforts must be — separately

recorded with reasonable details,
be read over to the parties or their
agents/counsel and the signatures/
thumb-impressions of the parties be
obtained thereon so that this Court
or Court of appeal is in a position
to ascertain the nature of the
efforts made by the Family Court
during reconciliation proceedings
and to see as to what were the
respective stances of the parties.

8. This would lay at rest the arguments
of learned counsel for petitioner in respect of
recording the statements of parties at the stage
of reconciliation. So far as the statements
recorded in the instant case at pre-trial
reconciliation stage is concerned, the
petitioner made a clean breast of it that the 3
tolas dowered gold ornaments are lying with
him and after this admission, his subsequent
denial has become meaningless, and therefore
the decree of 3 tolas gold ornaments were
rightly awarded against him.

9. So far as the dowry articles are
concerned, though respondent in her suit

claimed dowry articles as per list or its market
value, but in her statement she failed to
mention anything about the list of articles nor
produced or exhibited any list of dowry
articles. It is clear from the record that on the
directions of the Family Court bailiff prepared
a list of dowry articles which she denied and
alleged the missing of certain articles. The
respondent, in that situation was required to
convincingly prove the preparation of those
articles, to produce the relevant receipts or the
shop keepers concerned, however, the
available record is totally silent about these
facts, hence, she could not established the
missing of any articles and therefore in the
absence of any proof in this respect, she may
not have been held entitled to the alleged
missing dowry articles, hence, findings to the
extent of missing articles is not sustainable in
the eye of law and decree passed in favour of
respondent to the extent of dowry articles is

set aside.
10 In light of the aforesaid discussion,
this petition is partially allowed to the extent
of dowry articles while the writ petition to the
extent of remaining relief is dismissed.
