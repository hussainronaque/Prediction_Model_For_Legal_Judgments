which he was convicted and sentenced as follows;

(D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
© USS 302 (b) PPC to life imprisonment (on two
counts) along with compensation of Rs.
300,000/-- (three hundred thousand) under
section 544-A Cr.P.C payable to legal heirs of

accused shall further undergo six months
simple imprisonment. The compensation was
ordered to be recoverable as arrears of land

© The Appellant was also extended the benefit of
section 382-B Cr.P.C.

2. The appellant faced trial in the criminal
case registered vide FIR No. 783 dated 31.08.2002
under section 302 PPC at Police Station Daggar
District Buner, on the basis of ‘Murasila’ (Ex.PA/1)
sent by Qasim Jan Khan, Sub Inspector (retired)
(APW-10) to the police station concerned on
31.08.2002. The complainant namely Ghaffar Khan
reported the matter to local police that his deceased
niece namely Mst. Nasia was married to one
Bakht Rehman one year prior to the present
occurrence. She was having illicit relations with Waris
Khan (deceased) and she has come to the house of her
parents about four days back. On the fateful day, the
accused namely Zahireen (the appellant herein) while
being duly armed with firearms, (who is brother-in-law
(os) of Mst. Nasia) went to the house of Waris Khan
and started firing at him, as a result of which he got

hit and died on the spot. Afterwards, the accused/

(0.8.) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
S

appellant Zahireen went to the house of parents of Mst.
Nasia where she was also killed by firing at her. The
occurrence was witnessed by one Mst. Nasib Zaroon.
Motive behind the occurrence was stated to be illicit
relations of Mst. Nasia with the male deceased namely _
Waris Khan.

3. Initially, the accused was avoiding his
lawful arrest, therefore, proceedings under section 512
Cr.P.C were initiated against him and upon completion
of the same he was declared proclaimed offender vide
order dated 02.06.2005 of the Court of learned
Sessions Judge Buner. Upon arrest of the accused,
supplementary challan was submitted against him
before the learned trial court and charge was also
framed against him, to which he pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. The prosecution was invited to produce
its evidence, who accordingly examined twelve (12)
witnesses in support of their case. Thereafter,
statement of the accused was recorded under section
342 Cr.P.C. On conclusion of proceedings in trial, the
accused/appellant was convicted by the learned
Sessions Judge Buner at Daggar vide judgment dated
25.04.2019 and sentenced to life imprisonment (on

two counts) under section 302 (b) PPC along with

(D.B.} Hon’bie Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad [jaz Khan
compensation of Rs. 300,000/- payable to both the
legal heirs of the deceased, or in default thereof to
suffer six months simple imprisonment.

4. The aforesaid judgment of conviction
was challenged by the appellant by filing criminal
appeal No. 210-M of 2019 before this Court. This
Court vide judgment dated 25.05.2021 while allowing
appeal of the appellant set aside the judgment of
conviction dated 25.04.2019 and the case was
remanded back to learned trial Court to first frame a
charge against the accused and then re-examined
certain prosecution witnesses and shall also provide
an opportunity of cross-examination to the defence.

5. After remand, the learned trial after
compliance of the directions of this Court (as given in
the aforesaid judgment), convicted and sentenced the
appellant vide the impugned judgment dated
30.10.2021. The appeilant has challenged the aforesaid
judgment of his conviction and sentence by filing the
instant appeal before this Court, while the petitioner
has also filed the connected Criminal Revision No.
75-M_of 2021 for enhancement of the sentence

awarded to the accused/respondent namely Zahireen.

(D.B.) Hon’bte Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
6. Arguments of learned counsel for the
parties as well as learned Astt: A.G. appearing on
behalf of the State were heard in considerable detail
and the record perused with their able assistance.

7, In this case the story of prosecution as
narrated by the complainant namely Ghaffar Khan
(who was not produced as a witness during the course
of trial) that the local police visited the house of the
deceased where he made report to the effect that one
the deceased namely Mst. Nasia is his niece (sie)
who has married to one Bakht Rahman about one year
back, however, his niece Mst. Nasia was having illicit
relations with one Waris Khan and four days prior to
the happening of present occurrence her niece came to
the house of her parents and as such it was yesterday
on 30.08.2002 when at about 03 o clock the appellant
namely Zahireen, (who was brother-in-law (3) of
her niece) entered the house of Waris
Khan and killed him through firearm and
thereafter the appellant namely Zahireen went to
the house of parents of Mst. Nasia where the
complainant was also present and he made a

fire at Mst. Nasia through firearm and

{0.8.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
GY

kill her. After the occurrence, the appellant made his
good escape. The occurrence was stated to be witnessed
by one Mst. Nasib Zaroon (mother of the deceased).
Motive behind the occurrence was stated to be illicit
relationship between Waris Khan and Mst. Nasia.

8. In this case the record reveals that the
occurrence has taken place on 30.08.2002 at 15:00
hours whereas the report has been lodged by the
complainant namely Ghaffar Khan on the next day of
the occurrence i.e. on 31.08.2002 inside the house of

one of the deceased at 13:00 hours and as such there is

22 hours delay in lodging of the First Information
Report_and that too when the local police visited the
house of the complainant, In the case of “Muhammad
Akram v/s The State” reported as 2009 SCMR 230

the Hon’ble Apex Court has held that conduct of the

father of the abductee, who knew the accused, lodged
the FIR after an ordinate delay of six months of the
abduction and recovery of his son, had cast heavy
doubt on the veracity of the FIR.

9. In this case, the site plan (Ex. PB) was
prepared on the pointation of the complainant namely
Ghaffar Khan as well as other alleged eyewitnesses of

the occurrence which shows that the houses of the two

(D.B.} Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
deceased though are situated in affront of each other,
but at a distance of 300 yards. The site plan further
stipulates that Mst. Nasia was shown at point “B”
which is inside her room whereas the complainant
Ghaffar Khan has been shown at point No. 5 and the
mother of the deceased namely Mst. Nasib Zaroon has
been shown at point No.6, whereas the other deceased
namely Waris Khan has been shown at point No. 1 at
the veranda of his house, whereas PWs Bakht Sherin
Khan and Mst. Bibi Zaroun have been shown at point
No. 3 & 4 inside the house and as such the
complainant at point No. 5 could not see the places
assigned to both the deceased.

10. In order to establish the guilt of the
appellant the prosecution has produced ten (10)
witnesses and the ocular account in this case has been
furnished by APW-7 namely Mst. Bibi Zaroun, who is
the mother of the deceased Waris Khan and APW-8
namely Mst. Nasib Zaroun, who is the mother of
deceased Mst. Nasia. The APW-7 namely Mst. Bibi
Zaroun has clearly stated in her statement that at the
relevant time her deceased son was sitting outside the
house when in the meanwhile the accused came there
and started altercation with the allegation of illicit

(D.B.} Hon’bte Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad IJaz Khan

relations of my son with the sister-in-law (14) of the
accused/appellant namely Mst. Nasia and he then fired
upon his son and shot him dead with three fire shots.
She has candidly stated that it was 03:00 p.m. and on
the next day of the occurrence the local police came to
the spot and who prepared site plan on her pointation
and the police also recovered three empty shells and
blood stained earth from the scene of occurrence. The
aforesaid statement of APW-7 has presented a totally
different picture when it is seen in juxta position with
the site plan. In the site plan the deceased namely .
Waris Khan has been shown at point No. 1 which is
inside the veranda of the house of APW-7 and as such
her statement alone is sufficient that the prosecution
has not been able to prove the mode and manner of this
occurrence as the statement of this APW-7 goes a long
way to contradict the First Information Report as well
as the site plan which was prepared on pointation of
the complainant and other eyewitnesses of the
occurrence. In the case of “Igbal Shah vs the State”
reported as 1998 P Cr.LJ 1177, this Court has held

that the site plan was referred not for the reason that

it a solid piece of evidence but its utility cannot be

{D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
ignored being the first reflection of the spot as
indicated or pointed-out by the _eye-witnesses
furnished a panoramic view_of the occurrence to
scrutinize the evidence tendered at the trial by
prosecution witnesses.

11. Another alleged eyewitness of the
occurrence namely Mst. Nasib Zaroun (mother of the
deceased lady Mst. Nasia) appeared in the Court as
APW-8 and she in her examination-in-chief has
straight-away stated that she does not want to
prosecute the present appellant. In view of the
aforesaid only two statements of the alleged
eyewitness, the prosecution has not been able to
bring on record any other ocular-account of the
occurrence.

12. It is also relevant to mention here that
the prosecution has not been able to prove the
contents of the First Information Report for the
reason that the complainant namely Ghaffar Khan,
the very maker of the report has not been produced
as witness in the Court to support the contents of the
FIR and as such when the very foundation of the

prosecution case has not been established, then any

{D.8.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-10-

superstructure built upon it through production of
any other witnesses would be of no fruitful result for
the prosecution.

13. It is also astonishing to mention here
that in this case the fathers, brothers or any other
male members of both the deceased have not come
forward to charge the present appellant and both of
them have opted to just produce the old ladies in the
Court i.e. mothers of both the deceased, which
conduct of the complainant-party prima facie shows
that they have suppressed the mode and manner and
real facts of the occurrence.

14, As stated earlier, that in this case as per
the contents of the ‘Murasila’ (Ex. PA/1) the
occurrence has taken place on 30.08.2002 at 15:00
hours whereas the report was made to local police on
the next day i.e. on 31.08.2002 at 13:00 hours, after
22 long hours of the occurrence, however, APW-1
namely Dr. Sultanul Mulk when appeared in the
Court he has stated that on 31.08.2002 at about
18:00 hours i.e. after 27 hours of the occurrence

when he examined the two deceased fresh blood was
oozing from their injuries, which fact alone_is

(0.8.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad ijaz Khan
-ll-

sufficient to cast a serious doubt as how fresh blood
could be oozed from the injuries after 27 hours and

that too in hot summer weather.

15. In this case though the prosecution has
alleged motive of illicit relations between the two
deceased, however, the prosecution has not brought
on record an iota of evidence to prove the same and
if at all there was a motive (as alleged by the
prosecution in the FIR), then the same has no
relevancy with the present appellant when
admittedly husband of the deceased namely Mst.
Nasia, her father and brother are still alive as it could
be a matter of honour for them at the first hand and
not for the present appellant, therefore, it is too
unreasonable and improbable that a person with such
a remote relationship would act in such a manner, as
alleged by the prosecution.

16. It is also settled law that for giving
benefit to an accused, it is not essential that there
should be many grounds for the same, even a single
doubt is sufficient to extend its benefit to an accused
person as it is the cardinal principle of criminal

administration of justice that let hundred guilty

(0.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-12-

persons be acquitted but one innocent person should
not be convicted. In the case of “Muhammad
Mansha_v/s The State” reported as 2018 SCMR
772, the Hon’ble Apex Court has held that while
giving the benefit of doubt to an accused it is not

necessary that there should be many circumstances
creating doubt. If there is a circumstance which

creates reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about
the guilt of the accused, then the accused would be
entitled to the benefit of such doubt, not as a matter
of grace and concession, but as a matter of right. It
is based on the maxim, "it is better that ten guilty
persons be acquitted rather _than_one_innocent
person be convicted". Reliance in this behalf can be
made upon the cases of Tariq Pervez v. The State
(1995 SCMR 1345), Ghulam Qadir and 2 others v.
The State (2008 SCMR 1221), Muhammad Akram
v. The State (2009 SCMR 230) and Muhammad
Zaman v. The State (2014 SCMR 749. In the case of

“Tarig_ Pervaiz v/s The State” reported as 1995
SCMR 1345 , the Hon’ble Apex Court has held that
the concept of benefit of doubt to an accused

person is deep-rooted in our country. For giving

{0.B.} Hon‘bte Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-13-

him benefit of doubt, it is not necessary that there
should be many circumstances creating doubts. If

there is a circumstance which creates reasonable

ee EE ER EPOCH) PCUN UNUM

doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of the

accused, then the accused will be entitled to the

benefit not as a matter of grace and concession but
as a matter of right.

Further reliance in this regard may also

be placed on the following judgment;

1) Muhammad Akram v/s The Bashar

(2009 SCMR 230).
2) Faryad Ali v/s The _ State
(2008 SCMR 1086).
17. In light of what has been discussed

above, the instant appeal is allowed, the
accused/appellant namely Zahireen is extended the
benefit of doubt and resultantly acquitted of the
charges leveled against him by setting aside the
impugned judgment of conviction and sentence of
the Court of learned Sessions Judge Buner at
Dagger dated 30.10.2021. He be released forthwith
from the Jail, if not required in any other

case. Similarly, the connected criminal revision
