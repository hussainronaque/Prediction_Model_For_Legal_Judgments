hours, he in the company of S.H.O Khan Zada Khan
(PW-2), Muhammad Siraj Khan S.I (deceased) and
other police contingents raided the house of the
present appellant/convict, who was proclaimed
offender and required to police in Case F.I.R No.
101 dated 08.06.2002 w/s 324 P.P.C, F.LR No.

started firing on police officials with his pistol
thereby causing serious injuries to SHO Khan Zada,

constables Muhammad Ismail No. 327 and Mubarak
Zeb No. 5689. The police also fired in their defence
as result of which the present appellant was hit and

produced and examined nine PWs in support of its
case and closed its evidence. After examination of
the appellant u/s 342, Cr.P.C, the learned trial Court
vide impugned judgment convicted and sentenced

him as mentioned above, hence, these appeals.

4. After hearing learned counsel for the
appellant and learned Assistant A.G on behalf of
State, it transpired that the present appellant/convict
had filed an application u/s 22-A, Cr.P.C before the
learned Justice of Peace, Dir Upper at Camp Court
Wari which was allowed vide order dated
13.04.2015, resultantly, cross case vide F.I.R No. 55
dated 16.04.2015 was registered at P.S Jagaam
wherein he charged the injured PWs namely Khan
Zada S.H.O, Bahrul Mulk ASI and constables
Muhammad Ismail and Mubarak Zeb u/s 324, 337-
FGi)/34 P.P.C for attempting at his life by causing
him firearm injuries in the same occurrence. The
record shows that only medical report of the injured
appellant/convict was exhibited as Ex.PW-7/10 in
support of which Dr. Jehanzeb was examined as
PW-7 who in his statement has referred to the

aforesaid medico-legal report alongwith other

reports of the injured police officials examined by
him on the same day. However, neither the
remaining important documents of the cross case
were exhibited in the present case nor the respective
witnesses were examined. It was the duty of the
defence to have brought on the record the relevant
documents of the other file to the file of the present case.
Even at the same time the trial Court as well as the
prosecution were supposed to bring on the record the
real facts of the case and all the available material
which, in our view, have not been done. Reliance is
placed on an unreported judgment dated 09.08.2011 in
the case titled Munawar Bacha V/s. The State (Cr.A No.

884/2010) by holding that:

“As in the absence of such
evidence/documents, we are unable to
decide the case according to the settled
principles of law and justice otherwise,
we have to endorse the judgment given
in vacuum by the trial Court thus, for
doing substantial justice remand of the
case has become essential”.

5. In absence of the important evidence/
documents of the cross case, we are unable to adjudge
the matter according to the settled principles of criminal

justice. Thus, without discussing merits of the case lest it

prejudice the case of either side and for doing substantial

justice in the matter, remand of the case has become
imperative. Therefore, this appeal is partially allowed,
the impugned judgment is set aside and the case is
remanded to the trial Court with directions to examine or
re-examine all essential witnesses of the alleged cross-
case (F.I.R No.55) as Court witnesses who authored the
report, site plan, recovery memos and other relevant
documents which in the opinion of the trial Court are
essential for the just decision of the case and bring the
same on the file of the present case through the authors
of those documents in accordance with law. The learned
trial Court shall look into the matter and may summon
any other witness relevant to the facts and circumstances
of the case by affording fair opportunity of cross-
examining of the witnesses to both the parties.
Thereafter the learned trial Court shall examine the
accused under Section 342, Cr.P.C and decide the case
after hearing the parties. Needless to mention that the
appellant shall be treated as under trial prisoner and he
shall .be provided all the privileges available to other
under trial prisoners under the law. The learned trial
Court shall procure record of the cross case from the
concerned quarter and conclude the proceedings .
positively within two months after receipt of copy of this

judgment. The connected Cr.A No. 50-M/ 2017, being
