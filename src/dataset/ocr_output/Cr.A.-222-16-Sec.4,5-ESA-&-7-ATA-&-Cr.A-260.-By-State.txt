MUHAMMAD NASIR MAHFOOZ, J:- By this common
judgment, we shall also decide Cr.A No.260-M/2016, as
both the appeals have arisen from the judgment dated
03.11.2016 of the learned Judge Anti-Terrorism Court-
IH, Swat at Timergara, Lower Dir, delivered in case FIR
No.04 dated 15.01.2016 under sections 4/5 Explosive
Substance Act, 15 Arms Act, read with Section 7 Anti-
Terrorism Act, 1997 of police station CTD Malakand
Region.

2. Through the impugned judgment, appellant
Raees Khan has been convicted under Sections 4/5
Explosive Substance Act and sentenced to 7 & 3 years
R.I, respectively and under section 15 AA for one year
R.I. Benefit under Section 382-B, Cr.P.C has been given

to him. The convict/appellant has impugned his
conviction and sentence by filing Cr.A.No.222-M/2016
whereas the complainant/State has prayed for
enhancement of sentence of the convict/appellant through
Cr.A.No.260-M/2016. As stated earlier, both the appeals
are being decided through this single judgment.

3. Brief facts of the case are that on 15.01.2016 at
08:45 hours, during search operation at a place known as
‘Terkha’ Chakdara, the appellant was found in suspicious
condition. From his personal possession, one 30 bore
pistol with ten live rounds and one hand grenade were
recovered. On the basis of ibid recovery, case under
sections 4/5 Explosive Substance Act, 15 Arms Act, read
with Section 7 Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 was registered
against him. After completion of investigation,
complete challan was put in Court, which indicted the
accused for the charge to which he pleaded not guilty
and claimed trial. In order to prove its case,
prosecution examined four witnesses whereafter
statement of the accused was recorded wherein he
professed innocence. On conclusion of the trial, the
learned trial Court found the appellant guilty of the
charge and on conviction sentenced him, as

mentioned above.
4. Learned counsel for the convict/appellant
contended that the impugned order is arbitrary and
passed without application of judicial mind and legal
formalities have not been fulfilled by the prosecution;
that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case
against the appellant and the learned trial Court has fallen
in error to pass the impugned judgment of conviction;
that there is no ground to believe that the accused has
committed any act of terrorism as provided under
sections 6 and 7 of ATA.

5. As against the above, learned counsel
representing the State while supporting the judgment of
conviction, argued that the prosecution has been able to
prove its case against the convict through convincing
evidence, which is worth reliable. He contended that
there are strong grounds to believe that sections 6 (1) (b)
ATA alongwith Sub-section (2) (EE) besides section 7
apply to the instant case but also contended that the
learned trial court has wrongly passed a lesser sentence
whereas accused-appellant deserves maximum sentence
provided under the law.

6. We have heard learned counsel for the parties

and also gone through the case record.
7. Prosecution in support of its case has produced
four witnesses. Muhammad Iqbal Khan SI Investigation
PS CTD Malakand was examined as P.W.1 who deposed
that he had investigated the case and allegedly recovered
one pistol of 30 bore marked P-1 country made with 10
rounds of the same bore P-2 and a hand grenade P-3. The
recovery memo is Ex.PA. He stated to have drafted
murasila EX.PA, which was sent to police station for
registration of the case wherein FIR Ex.P.A/1 was
registered.

8. P.W.2 Muhammad Aslam Khan, SI police station
CTD Malakand Region had deposed that he is the
marginal witness of recovery memo Ex.P.W.1/1.

9. P.W.3 Ajab Khan. Head Constable deposed that
he had examined the alleged recovery of 30 bore pistol
with 10 rounds vide his report Ex.P.W.3/1.

10. P.W.4 Ameer Shah, Inspector PS CTD Chitral
deposed that after registration of the case, investigation
was marked to him. He visited the spot and prepared the
site plan Ex.PB. He also obtained expert opinion of the
armourer regarding the pistol and also placed on file the
FSL report regarding the hand grenade Ex.PC.

11. The contention of learned counsel for the

appellant has got force that hand grenade alleged to be
recovered vide Ex.P.W.1/1 was in fact taken into
possession on 15.01.2016 but by manipulation and
overwriting it has been changed to 16.01.2016 and when
the same was sent on the same day then why it took two
days by sending the same to FSL for examination as
apparent from the FSL report Ex.PC. As according to
court query, learned State counsel could not give a
satisfactory answer to this question. In addition to this,
the said official besides the official who drafted murasila
have also been abandoned and not examined so as to
explain this position. Moreover, cross-examination of
Muhammad Iqbal, SI Investigation shows that he had
affixed the monogram with the words as in the seal but
the same is not present even in the cross-examination the
lacuna mentioned above has not been properly answered.

12. As it is well established practice in criminal cases
that slight doubt arising in the case of prosecution goes in
favour of the accused and he gets benefit that is sufficient
for acquittal. In the present case, prosecution has failed to
bring home the guilt as charged against accused-appellant
to prove that he had in fact intended to be involved in a
case under section 7 ATA. So far as the alleged recovery
and applicability of sections 4/5 Explosive Substance Act

is concerned, the date of manipulation vide which the
subject hand grenade was sent to the FSL from
15.01.2016 to 16.01.2016 besides the lack of explanation
of delay of two days for sending the same to FSL proved
that the prosecution has failed to discharge the burden of
proof heavily laid on them.

13. It may also be mentioned, that it is sine qua non
for applicability of provision of Anti-Terrorism Act,
1997 that joint investigation team in compliance of
section 19 of ibid Act has to be formed by District Police
Officer. This essential pre-requisite is also lacking.
Section 19 is reproduced below.

“19. Procedure and powers of Anti-Terrorism
Court.- (1) The offences under this Act shall be
investigated by a police officer not below the rank
of inspector. The Government, if deems necessary,
may constitute a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) of
the officers from other law enforcement agencies
including intelligence agencies for assisting the
investigation officer. The investigating officer or
the JIT shall complete the investigation in respect
of cases triable by the court within thirty working
days and forward a report under section 173 of the
Code directly to the court.”

Learned counsel for appellant referred to Bashir

Ahmed Vs. Muhammad Siddique & others (PLD 2009

S.C 11) para 9 of the said judgment is reproduced as
under;

“9. From the entire resume, it is manifest on
record that intention of the respondents was not at
all to create sense of insecurity or destabilize the
public-at-large or to advance any sectarian cause.
Thus, we are of the view that the design or purpose
of the offence as contemplated by the provisions of
section 6 of the Act is not attracted. Reference can
be made to the case of this court reported as Bashir
Ahmad v. Naveed Iqbal PLD 2001 SC 521 whereby
sprinkling of spirit on the person of victim was
made within the boundary walls of the house of
petitioner which was not a public place and
accordingly the element of a striking terror or
creating sense of fear and insecurity in the people
or any section of the people was found missing,
therefore, the order of transferring the case to the
court of learned Sessions Judge passed by the High
Court was upheld.”

He further placed reliance on the case of Aftab
Ahmad Vs The State (2004 MLD 1337) para 8 of which
is reproduced as under;

“8. Another co-incidence which sets the court on
its guards and constrains it to scrutinize the
evidence against the appellants with much greater
care and circumspection is that the recovery of
hand-grenades from the possession of the
appellants was not witnessed by any independent
witness. No doubt Police Officials are as good
witnesses as any other from the public but in the
circumstances of the case, when the _ very
occurrence on the alleged date and spot is highly
doubtful, the recovery of the incriminating material
in the absence of independent witness has to be
looked askance at.”

Reliance is also placed on Muhammad Ahmad
alias Danyal Vs. The State (2005 YLR 954) para No.31
of which is reproduced as under;

“31. It is not out of place to mention here that the
prosecution has cited three eyewitnesses namely
Feroz Khan, Alain Sher and Abdul Fhaffar as
disclosed by the investigation officer P.W.12 Pir
Munawar Shah. Out of them two witnesses, Feroz
Khan and Alain Sher were examined but the third
witness Abdul Gaffar was not produced before the
trial court for recording his statement. When one
witness out of the two witnesses examined in the
court was declared Hostile then it was incumbent
upon the prosecution to have examined the third
eye-witness namely Abdul Gaffar. The prosecution
did not furnish any reason for not examining this
witness. Theefore, a presumption under illustration
“g” of Article 129 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order can
fairly be drawn that had the P.W Abdul Gaffar been
examined in court, he would have not supported the
prosecution case or his evidence would have not
been favourable to the prosecution. Non-
examination of P.W Abdul Gaffar in the
circumstances of the present case has adversely
affected the prosecution story.”

He further placed reliance on an unreported
judgment of this court passed in Cr.A.No.114-P of 2014
para 9 of the judgment is reproduced as under;

“9. Apart from above, it is also in the statement
of Seizing Officer that the packets were having the
seal of ‘JK’ but it is remained unexplained that why
he didn’t affix the monogram of his own stamp,
which fact also makes the recovery doubtful. When
this being the state of things, we come to the safe
conclusion that the mode and manner of arrest of
the accused and recovery of contraband are highly
doubtful as the prosecution didn’t prove its case
beyond any shadow of doubt and any doubt, if
arising in links of the chain of prosecution story,
the benefit of same would go to accused and such
like dents in the prosecution evidence doesn’t
justify the conviction and sentence of the appellant
for the safe administration of criminal justice.”

Nevertheless, police officials could not be left
free to misuse their official position in such like situation.
14. For what has been discussed above, we are of the
view that the prosecution has failed to prove its case
against the appellant and the learned trial court has fallen
into error to convict the appellant on the present available
evidence on record. Therefore, we accept the instant
appeal, set aside the impugned judgment of sentence and

acquit the appellant of the charges leveled against him. It
is directed that the appellant be released forthwith if not
required to be detained in any other case.
Above are the reasons of our short order of even

date.
