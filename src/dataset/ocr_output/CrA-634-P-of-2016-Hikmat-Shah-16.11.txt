LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- This criminal
appeal is directed against the judgment
dated 08.10.2016 of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-V, Charsadda delivered in
case FIR No.34 dated 10.01.2015 u/s 302
PPC of Police Station Charsadda, whereby
on conviction u/s 302 (b) PPC, the appellant
has been sentenced to death with payment
of Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation to legal
heirs of the deceased.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on
10.01.2015, Bakhttiar Knan (PW-9) reported
to SI Gul Zar Khan of PS Charsadda
(PW-10) to the effect that he was present in
his house when got information regarding
murder of his daughter on which he rushed

to the spot where he saw her dead body. He
charged the appellant i.e. his son-in-law in
the case for causing qatl-i-amd of his
daughter. Motive for the crime was stated to
be soaring relations between the couple.

3. On arrest of the appellant and
completion of investigation, complete
challan was put in court, which indicted him
for commission of the offence to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order
to prove its case against the appellant,
prosecution examined 11 witnesses in all
whereafter statement of the accused was
recorded u/s 342 Cr.P.C., wherein, he
professed his innocence. The learned trial
court, after conclusion of the trial, found the
appellant guilty of the charge and while
recording his conviction sentenced him as
mentioned above. The appellant has
impugned his conviction through the instant
appeal whereas the learned trial court has
sent murder reference for confirmation of the

death sentence.

4. Arguments heard and record gone
through.
5. Of course, there is no eyewitness to

the occurrence but circumstantial evidence
of the case fully connects the appellant with

commission of the offence. Record shows
that the appellant was husband of the
deceased, who was done to death in her
house and that after his nomination in the
case as accused, he went into hiding and
remained fugitive from law for 51 days.

6. In the case in hand, abscondence of
the appellant is very relevant. Normally
abscondence hardly is taken into account for
recording conviction of an accused but when
a husband absconds after his nomination as
accused for the murder of his wife, then
such abscondece would matter being a
relevant fact leading to his guilt in the case
as per Article 21 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat
Order, 1984. According to the card of arrest
(Ex.PW11/8), the appellant was arrested in
the case on 03.03.2015 while his wife was
done to death on 10.01.2015. He has not
offered any explanation for avoiding his
lawful arrest in the case. The appellant’s
conduct for his remaining fugitive from law
goes a long way to connect him with
commission of murder of his wife. Record
also shows (Ex.PW 11/6) that the appellant
has parents, 7 sons and 3 daughters. He
was supposed to be in touch with his family
members about the affairs of his house but

he did not liaison with them, even he did not
attend the funeral of his wife. Ibid conduct of
the appellant has laid bare him as culprit in
the murder of his wife.

7. Another pronounced aspect of the
case is that the appellant has taken the plea
that his wife had committed suicide. This
stance of the appellant is not only baseless
but supports the charge against him as not
only medical examination of the victim belies
the appellant’s version qua suicide of the
deceased but there is no material on record,
which could show that the deceased had
become fed up of her life and wanted to get
rid of herself.

8. Further noticeable aspect of the case
is that from the crime spot, the Investigating
Officer had recovered one empty of .30 bore
and also had taken into possession one
30 bore pistol from the appellant’s
possession when on 03.03.2015 he was
arrested. The investigating agency had sent
the crime empty and recovered pistol to FSL
to ascertain whether the crime empty was
fired from the pistol recovered from the
appellant. The FSL report is (Ex.PW 11/4),
which affirms that the .30 bore crime empty

was fired from the .30 bore pistol.
9. In addition, there is nothing on record
to show that the complainant had falsely
implicated the appellant for the murder of his
daughter. Even, otherwise, no sane person
would ever substitute the actual culprit for
another.

10. Thorough and careful examination of
the case record shows that the prosecution
has successfully proved its case against the
appellant for his involvement in the case
albeit there is no ocular account in the case
but circumstantial evidence of the case in
the shape of appellant's abscondance,
recovery of empty of .30 bore from the crime
spot, recovery of crime pistol from the
appellant's possession, positive report of
FSL (Ex.PW 11/4), conduct of the appellant
and motive for the crime fully connects him
with murder of his wife and the learned trial
court has committed no legal error to record
his conviction, which is hereby maintained,
however, regarding the sentence, we are not
in agreement with the learned trial court.
Record shows that the appellant has minor
sons and daughters, who have already lost
their mother and if they are further deprived
of their father, then in that eventuality they

would suffer to the maximum because in
absence of their parents, they would
become shelterless. Above aspect of the
case, in the considered opinion of this court,
is a mitigating circumstance to award lesser
punishment to the appellant than the one
awarded to him.

11. In view of the above, we maintain the
conviction but reduce the appellant's
sentence from death to imprisonment for life
with benefit u/s 382-B Cr.P.C. The appellant
shall also pay an amount of Rs.1,00,000/- as
compensation to legal heirs of the deceased
or in default whereof to suffer further six
months SI.

12. Appeal partly allowed in the above
terms while the Murder Reference sent by
the learned trial court for confirmation of the

sentence is answered in the negative.
