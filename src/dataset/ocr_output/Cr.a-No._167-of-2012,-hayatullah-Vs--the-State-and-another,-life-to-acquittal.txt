ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.---_ This criminal appeal has been

learned Additional Sessions Judge-II], Bannu, whereby

337-Y of the P.P.C. However, he was extended benefit of

section 382-B Cr.PC and the awarded sentence was ordered to

be run concurrently.

2. The complainant Ali Abbas has also filed Cr.R

No.52-B/2012 for enhancement of sentence of appellant. As

both the criminal appeal and criminal revision are outcome of

the same impugned judgment and F.I.R are going to be decided

through this single judgment.
3. The complainant Ali Abbas, on 13.06.2005 at

19.30 hours, in injured condition at Emergency room of Civil

Hospital, Bannu reported the matter to Ayub Khan ASI, to the

effect that on the same date, he alongwith his brothers Sabz Ali,

Tariq Khan, Hamza Ali, Imran, Sardar Ali Khan and his

nephew Sakhi Zaman son of Tariq Khan were busy in preparing

of Embankment in their fields situated in village Kotka Ghulam

Qadir Dakhli Bragi. Meanwhile, his co-villagers accused (1)

Tehsil Khan (2) Bahader Khan (3) Gul Daraz (4) Shamaraz (5)

Thsanullah (6) Sharif (7) Hayatullah (8) Latif Khan (9) Atlas

Khan (10) Muhammad Nawaz (11) Rehmatullah (12) Gul

Zaman (13) Saifullah (14) Yousaf Khan and (15) Muqarab, all

armed with Kalashnikovs, appeared, forbidden them not to

make embankment and asked one another to kill, let they may

not escape alive. All the accused with intention to commit their

qatl-e-Amd, started firing at them, as a result whereof his

brothers Tariq Khan, Sardar Ali and his nephew Sakhi Zaman

hit and died at the spot, while the complainant and his brother

Sabz Ali sustained injuries, whereas Hamza Ali and Imran

escaped unhurt. Accused after the occurrence decamped from
the spot. Motive behind the offence as stated by the

complainant was dispute over landed property. It is pertinent to

mention here that the injured Sabz Ali was referred to

Peshawar, but on the way he succumbed to the injuries.

4. Ayub Khan ASI, reduced the report of complainant

in shape of Murasila, read over and explained to him, who after

admitting contents of the same as correct, signed the same.

Murasila was sent to the Police Station through Constable

Abdur Rehman No.665, which culminated into above

mentioned F.I.R. Ayub Khan ASI, prepared injury sheets,

inquest reports and sent the injured and dead bodies of the

deceased to Doctor for medical examination of the injured and

Post mortem examination of the deceased. Copy of F.I.R sent to

the investigation officer Amanullah Khan SI, who proceeded to

the spot and prepared site plan (Ex: PW 12/2) on the pointation

of PW Imranullah Khan, collected blood stained earth from the

place of deceased Tariq Khan, blood stained hay (bhosa) from

the place of deceased Sardar Ali Khan, and injured Sabz Ali

and complainant, vide recover memo Ex:PW 12/1. He received

blood stained garments of deceased vide recovery memo Ex:
PW 12/3. Placed on file F.S.L result regarding garments of

deceased vide Ex:PW 12/4. He recorded statements of PWs. On

completion of investigation he submitted case file to the S.H.O.

concerned on 27.06.2005, as at that time all the accused were

absconding, challan under section 512 Cr.PC was submitted

before the court. The learned trial court after completion of

trial, vide order dated 24.02.2006 declared proclaimed

offenders and perpetual warrants of arrest were issued against

them. On 12.07.2006 accused Sharifullah, on 14.08.2006

accused Gul Daraz Khan and Shama Raz were arrested and

after completion of investigation against them, supplementary

challan was submitted before the learned Additional Sessions

Judge-V, Bannu, but during trial on materialization of

compromise, the arrested accused alongwith accused Tehsil

Khan were acquitted on the basis of compromise vide order

dated 25.09.2006. Thereafter, accused Saifullah was arrested on

18.12.2006, on completion of investigation against him

supplementary challan was submitted on 26.01.2007. The

learned trial court on conclusion of trial convicted and
sentenced the accused vide judgment dated 03.06.2008, by the

learned Additional Sessions Judge-III, Bannu.

5. The present accused/ appellant Hayatullah was

arrested on 05.05.2011 and after completion of investigation

against him, supplementary challan was submitted on

10.05.2011. After complying with legal formalities under

section 265-C Cr.PC, the accused/ appellant was charge sheeted

on 02.10.2012, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

The prosecution in order to prove guilt of accused/ appellant

produced and examined as many as fifteen (15) witnesses. After

close of prosecution evidence, it was pointed out by learned

counsel for the parties, that accused/ appellant has not been

charge sheeted to the extent of in effective firing at Imran Khan

and Hamza Ali, due to which recharge was framed to that

extent. Learned counsel for the parties, recorded their statement

that they do not want to lead further evidence and rely upon the

evidence already recorded. Thus, statement of accused was

recorded under section 342 Cr.PC, wherein he professed his

innocence, he did not opt to produce defense evidence or to be

examined on oath as provided under section 340 (2) Cr.PC.
The learned trial court, after hearing arguments of learned

counsel for the parties, convicted and sentenced the accused/

appellant vide impugned judgment dated 06.10.2012. The

accused/ appellant challenged his conviction through this

appeal, while the complainant filed criminal revision petition

for enhancement of sentence, hence, both, appeal and revision

are going to be decided through this single judgment.

6. Learned counsel for the accused/ appellant argued

that the complainant exaggerated the charge by spreading wide

net and implicated fifteen persons of different families of the

village, in a delayed report lodged after consultation and

deliberation. He further argued that no specific role has been

attributed to the accused, while general role of firing has been

given to all the accused. He developed his arguments by

arguing that ocular account being closely related to deceased is

smeared with interestedness and witnesses are not worthy of

credence. He went on to say that no crime empty, whatsoever,

was recovered from the spot, meaning there by that the

occurrence has not taken place in the mode and manner as

alleged by the complainant. He fortified his arguments by
saying that regarding the alleged motive F.I.R No.54 dated

08.06.2003 was registered, which was compromised, hence, on

such motive no one can dare to commit such brutal offence. He

further supplemented that medical as well as circumstantial

evidence are in conflict with the ocular version and do not

support the prosecution story. His last argument was that the

accused/ appellant was away from the country since 1997, and

was also arrested from UAE, but despite that learned trial court,

being influenced by the conviction of co-accused Saifullah by

learned Additional Sessions Judge- III, Bannu and the order of

this court dated 01.06.2011, wherein the conviction of co-

accused was upheld, while the present case is altogether on

different footings. He concluded his arguments by saying that

the prosecution has miserably failed to establish his case

beyond any reasonable doubt, therefore, the judgment of

learned trial court requires reversal.

7. On the other hand, learned Addl: A.G assisted by

learned counsel for complainant vehemently opposed the

arguments advanced by learned counsel for accused/ appellant

by contending that the accused/ appellant is directly charged in
a broad day light occurrence for brutal murder of four deceased

and causing injuries to the complainant with a strong motive,

supported by F.I.R No.54 registered earlier. They went on to

say that ocular as well as circumstantial and medical account

very much supports the version of complainant and on the

testimony of these witnesses co-accused namely Saifullah has

been convicted by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-III,

Bannu which judgment has been confirmed by this Court vide

judgment dated 01.06.2011 and upheld by the august Supreme

Court by refusing the leave to him, hence no exception could be

taken. Their last argument was that the prosecution also has

been able to prove guilt of accused/ appellant beyond any

shadow of doubt, therefore, the judgment of learned trial court

needs not to be interfered with, rather by accepting criminal

revision petition, of the complainant/petitioner the sentence

awarded to the appellants/ convicts be enhanced.

8. Arguments heard and record perused.

9. Before dilating upon the merits of the present case

first we would like to discuss, the main grounds of prosecution
-10-

case, that evidence against co-accused namely Saifullah was

believed and his Cr.A No.50/2010 was dismissed, vide

judgment dated 01.06.2011, by this court and leave to appeal

was also refused in Jail petition No.48 of 2012 by the apex

Court vide order dated 18.12.2012. Law has provided holding

independent trial to each accused, whenever he is arrested.

Court is under obligation to assess the evidence led by the

prosecution independently, without being influenced from

acquittal or conviction of co-accused, whose trial was

conducted earlier. Rationale behind holding of fresh trial would

be a futile exercise, if courts subscribe to the result of trial

conducted earlier. Our view is fortified by seeking guidance

from the judgment rendered by this court in case of “Zalay Mir

Vs the State” 1997 PCr. LJ 510) and “Sher Akbar Vs Mst.

Sajida and another” (2011 YLR 1014), wherein this Court has

dealt almost similar situation and has rendered judgments

different to those earlier discussed.

10. We are conscious of the fact that evidence has

been believed qua the convicted co-accused Saifullah, with

utmost regards to the reasoning advanced by this court and
-l1ll-

leave refusing order of the apex court, we proposed to differ

with findings, while dealing with the case in hand, on the

following grounds.

11. Ocular account in this case was furnished by

complainant PW-13, Ali Abbas and PW-14, Hamza Ali Khan.

Both these PWs are brothers of the three deceased and uncle of

one deceased Sabz Ali, they are closely related to each other,

therefore, their testimony is to be judged with care and caution.

There is no denial that interestedness or disinterestedness is not

the yardstick for believing or disbelieving a witness, rather

intrinsic worth or inherent merit of the testimony of a witness is

to be considered. In order to believe an interested witness first

the prosecution has to satisfy the Court regarding presence of

the witnesses at the spot and secondly whether they are credible

truthful witnesses and thereafter conviction can be based on

testimony of interested witness, if same is corroborated by

some strong corroborative piece of evidence. Reliance is placed

on case titled “Haroon alias Harooni Vs _ the State and

another” (1995 SCMR_1627) and “Haji Rab Nawaz Vs
-12-

Sikandar Zulgarnain and 7 others” 1998 SCMR 25), wherein

it is held that:

“One salutary principle laid down by
this Court in this behalf and which is
now firmly established is, that in a case
involving capital punishment, — the
Courts will not base conviction of an
accused solely on the testimony of
interested witness unless such evidence
finds corroboration by some _ other
independent and _— unimpeachable
nature of evidence or circumstance in
the case. This rule of prudence though
not statutory in nature, has been
followed by Courts so consistently
through years that it has come to be
recognized almost as a rule of law. The
departure from this rule is to be found
rarely and in very exceptional
circumstances of a case. Therefore, to
say that the evidence of an interested
witness is to be accepted solely on the
ground that it remained unshaken
during cross-examination is not a

correct proposition.”

12. Complainant Ali Abbas no doubt sustained injuries

during the incident. It is not the case that he got injuries

somewhere else. We are not oblivion of fact that stamp of

injuries are indicative of the presence of a witness and not of his
-13-

truth. Reliance is placed on case titled “Naseeb-ur-Rehman

and 3 others Vs the State and another (2016 P Cr. LJ Note 17)

wherein it is held that mere presence of stamp of injuries on the

person of a witness, is not a yardstick for determining the

truthfulness or falsehood of a witness. Every injured witness

would not speak the truth and every uninjured eye-witness

would tell a lie. Circumstances of the case and intrinsic worth

of statement of witness would determine the veracity and his

credibility.

13. Undoubtedly, its quadruplet murder case wherein

four persons lost their lives, while complainant received fire

arm injuries and for that fifteen persons are charged for

indiscriminate firing equipped with sophisticated weapons, i.e.

Kalashnikovs. Site plan would reveal that all the accused except

Latif are standing in one row, firing at the complainant party,

but strange enough not a single empty has been recovered from

the crime scene, how the prosecution would reconcile the

situation, where fifteen persons are charged for indiscriminate

firing, more so, without specification or attribution of role to

any accused.
-14-

14. Post Mortem report of all the deceased including

medical report of complainant, shows that total injuries are

seventeen in number out of which eleven (11) are entry

wounds, while five are graze wounds.

1. Ali Abbas Injured | One entry wound

2. Tariq Three entry wounds

3. Sabz Ali Khan Two entry wounds
Two graze wounds

4. Sardar Ali Three entry wounds
Three graze wounds.

5. Sakhi Zaman Two entry wounds.

If fifteen persons armed with Kalashnikov resort to firing

the dead bodies would have been ridden with bullets, when the

distance shown in the site plan is 16 to 20/22 paces. Even a

single person can inflict or cause much more damage as to that

of the present and most particularly when he is equipped with

formidable weapon like Kalashnikov. Reliance is placed on

case titled, “Sohni Vs Bahaduri_and 5 others and the State”

(@LD 1965 SC 111), wherein it is held that:

-15-

“In view of number and nature of
injuries one may legitimately ask
whether this could possibly have been
the result of assault by six accused
persons or that they could have been
easily caused by two or three persons.
Viewing all the circumstances we are
satisfied that the High Court was right
in insisting on some corroboration of
the evidence of the eye-witnesses
connected the accused with the crime.
As such corroboration was lacking, the
High court was justified in giving the

benefit of doubt to the accused persons.

15. Apart from that all the entry wounds on the
complainant as well as the deceased are of % X % dimensions,
which further negate the version of complainant qua the
participation of the accused nominated in the F.I.R. Reliance is
placed on case titled “Farman Ali and 3 others Vs The State

(PLD 1980 SC 201), wherein it is held that:

“It is true that according to the
prosecution each one of the three
appellant brothers was armed with a
.32 bore pistol: But the type of injuries
suffered by Rashid Khan rather suggest
that it was the work of one man. It is
common knowledge that .32 bore pistol

is an automatic weapon carrying in its
-16-

charger seven bullets. The fact that the
deceased was found to have suffered
seven inlet wounds, three of them in his
left Knee joint, one on his left elbow,
two in his abdomen and one in
backward direction to his right supericr
iliac spine, the inlet -size of all of which
is said to be the same, would go a long
way to show that this could as well be
the work of a single person and not of
the three appellants. There. is no
evidence on the record to show,
however, as to which one of the three
had caused him the said injuries,
therefore, no option is left but to hold
that the prosecution has failed to bring
home its case against any one of the

appellants.”

In spite of the fact that firing at all the deceased was made from

different directions and distances simultaneously.

16. Record also shows that prior to the present

occurrence complainant side has so many blood feud in the area

and even they were present at crime venue empty handed and

were not possessing any firearm, which in our view and most

particularly in this area is improbable and does not stand to

reason rather it can be safely adjudged that the occurrence has
-17-

not taken place at the time mode and manner as asserted by

prosecution.

17. Story of the prosecution that they were busy in

making the embankment (Bana) is not supported by any

independent evidence, only the IO has shown that embankment

(Bana) in site plan, he has not bothered to take into possession

the instruments through which the work was carried out, which

was incumbent upon him, but it is not the case here. Reliance is

placed on case titled, “The Stae Vs Muhammad Akram” (PLD

1985 Peshawar 116), wherein it is held that:

“In the least, the non-recovery of
sickles from the spot did create a doubt
as to the correctness of the prosecution

story disclosed at the trial.”

18.. From the above assessment of evidence it is

discernible that the charge made by the complainant party is

exaggerated, as fifteen persons of three different families have

been implicated on the strength of the simple motive, to delete

their enemies in one stroke. Reliance is placed on case titled

“Muhammad Zaman Vs the State and others” (2014 SCMR

749), wherein it is held that:
-18-

“The number of assailants in the
circumstances of the case appears to
have been exaggerated. It seems that
most of the persons including the
respondents have been charged
because of previous enmity. The
tragedy may have been enacted by
Mukhtar who has gone into hiding or
Munawar who has been acquitted
because the deceased shabbier was
alleged to have illicit relation with their
sister, but many who have no visible
nexus with this part of the story have
also been roped in. It is so because it is
customary in this part of the country to
throw wide net of implication to rope in
all those who could possibly pursue the
case or do something to save the skin of
the one who is innocent or who is
actually responsible for the commission
of the crime. The court, therefore, is
required to exercise much greater care
and circumspection while appraising

evidence.

19. The prosecution version is that, all the fifteen

accused persons have made indiscriminate firing at the

complainant party. No specific role has been attributed to any

of the accused. During the trial prosecution has failed to

establish role of each accused and the event of non-recovery of
-19-

crime empties from the spot has went a step ahead to disprove

the factum of firing by one person or more. It has been held that

in view of size and number injuries inflicted upon the body of

deceased and complainant, one person can inflict such number

of injuries. On the other hand, six amongst the fifteen have been

acquitted on the basis of compromise. In such events, who were

the actual culprits, the persons who have effected compromise

or the accused/ petitioners is in mystery, which creates serious

dent in the prosecution case. It is the principle enshrined in

Islamic jurisprudence, fourteen hundred years ago that “it

would be better to acquit hundred culprits than convicting one

innocent soul.” Which has now been transformed into the form

of the principle that, “acquitting by error would be better than

convicting by error”. The said commandment has evolved into

the theory of benefit of doubt, which, invariably, is extended to

the accused for safe administration of criminal justice.

20. It is well embedded principle of criminal justice

that there is no need of so many doubts in the prosecution case,

rather any reasonable doubt arising out of the prosecution

evidence, pricking the judicious mind is sufficient for acquittal
-20-

6

of the accused. Reliance is placed on case law “Tarig Pervaz Vs

the State” (1995 SCMR 1345). The same principle has been

reiterated by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Muhammad

Akram’s case (2009 SCMR 230), wherein it is held that:

“13. The nutshell of the whole
discussion is that the prosecution case
is not free from doubt. It is an
axiomatic principle of law that in case
of doubt, the benefit thereof must
accrue in favour of the accused as
matter of right and not of grace. It was
observed by this Court in the case of
Tariq Pervez v. The State 1995 SCMR
1345 that for giving the benefit of
doubt, it was not necessary that there
should be many circumstances creating
doubts. If there is circumstance which
created reasonable doubt in a prudent
mind about the guilt of the accused,
then the accused would be entitled to
the benefit of doubt not as a matter of
grace and concession but as a matter of

right.”

21.. The learned trial Court has erred in law by

convicting appellant on the basis of such a weak type of

evidence. It would not be safe to maintain conviction on the

basis of such shaky and scanty evidence, consequently, this
-21-

criminal appeal (Cr. A No.167-B/2012) is allowed, the
impugned judgment of conviction dated 06.10.2012 of learned
Additional Sessions Judge-III, Bannu is set aside and accused/
appellant Hayatullah is acquitted of the charges leveled against
him. While Cr. R No. 52-B/2012 filed by complainant Ali
Abbas stands dismissed. These are the reasons of our short

order of the even date, which is as under:

“For the reasons to be recorded later,
this criminal appeal is accepted, the
impugned judgment of conviction dated
06.10.2012, rendered by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-II, Bannu
is set-aside and consequently appellant
Hayatullah is acquitted of the charges
leveled against him. He be set at liberty
forthwith, if not required in any other
criminal case. Cr.r No.52-B of 2012
filed by complainant Ali Abbas, stands

dismissed.
