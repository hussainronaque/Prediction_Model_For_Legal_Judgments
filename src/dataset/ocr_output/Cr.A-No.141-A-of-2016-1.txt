SYED MUHAMAMD ATTIQUE SHAH, _J:-
Appellant, Yaseen Ali son of Dilawar Khan alongwith
co-accused(convict), Hayat Khan son of Fazal Karim
was tried by learned Additional Sessions Judge-VI/
Judge Special Court, Abbottabad, for the offence of
recovery of five kilograms ‘charas’ and _ three
kilograms of ‘heroin’, and convicted them under
section 9-C CNSA and sentenced them to five years
Rigorous Imprisonment each with fine of Rs.50,000/-
each or in default of payment of fine, they shall suffer
three months Simple Imprisonment and benefit of
section 382-B Cr.P.C was also given to the them, vide
judgment dated 27.10.2016. The appellant has

challenged his conviction and sentence by filing the
instant appeal under section 48 of Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 1997. However, convict Hayat Khan
has not filed any appeal before this
Court against his conviction.

2. The case of the prosecution, as set up in case
F.LR No.234 (Ex.PA) dated 05.04.2016, for offence
under Section 9 (c) of Control of Narcotics Substance
Act, 1997 Police Station Havelian, Abbottabad, was
that on 05.04.2016 at 12.00 hours, Junaid Khan, SHO
Police Station Havelian alongwith Kamran, Bilal,
Shoaib, Mazhar, Mohsin, constables and Saeed Akbar
Head constable were present near Ayub Bridge
opposite Kohisar Filling Station, Mansehra Road in
connection with blockade (Naka Bandi), when a
motorcar No.LEC-4165 white colour came from
Haripur side. On noticing the police checking/Naka
Bandi, the driver of motorcar took a ‘U’ turn towards
Haripur but due to heavy traffic, he could not take
away motorcar from the site of occurrence. The SHO
alongwith police party upon reaching the car alighted
the driver from the vehicle, who disclosed his name as
Yasin Ali son of Dilawar Khan, resident of Katti

Ghari, Mardan and while introducing himself as
Islamabad Police employee, has produced his service
card. On suspicion, the person sitting on front seat
was also overpowered and car was taken aside. He
introduced himself as Colonel in Pak Army and
disclosed his name as Hayat Khan son of Fazal
Karim, resident of Khair Abad, Nowshera. Apellant
Yaseen told that he was going to Abbottabad,
Mansehra in order to distribute invitation cards of
marriage ceremony of his cousin. However, on search
of the car, two pairs of Islamabad police uniform
lying on the rear seat alongwith three packets
containing ‘heroin’ and five packets having ‘charas’
kept in secret cavity of rear seat were recovered. On
weighing the contraband ‘heroin’ and ‘charas’ on the
spot, the same was found to be three kilograms and
five kilograms, respectively, which were taken into
possession vide recovery memo (Ex.PW3/1). The
SHO separated five grams from each packet of
‘heroin’ and ‘charas’ and sealed the same in parcels
No.1 to 9 for chemical analysis. The complainant
SHO drafted Murasila (Ex.PA/1) and sent the same to
the PS for registration of the case against the appellant

and co-accused-convict Hayat Khan. After completion
of investigation, challan of the case was sent to Judge
Special Court for trial of the appellant and co-
accused/convict Hayat Khan.

3. The present appellant alongwith co-accused
(convict) was charged by the trial Court on
25.07.2016, which was denied by the appellant and
co-accused-convict and they claimed trial. The
prosecution produced five witnesses, including
Ashfaq Ahmad, MHC (PW-1), who on receipt of
Murasila, registered the case vide FIR (Ex.PA) and
also sent the samples to the FSL for chemical analysis
vide road Certificate (Ex.PW 1/1). Naseer Ahmad,
constable (PW-2) took samples to the FSL, which
were handed over by him in the laboratory vide
receipt (Ex.PW 1/1). Kamran HC (PW-3) was
marginal witness to recovery memo (Ex.PW 3/1) vide
which (PW-4) recovered three KGs of ‘heroin’ and
five KGs of ‘charas’ from the back of rear seat of car
No.4165 and separated samples therefrom and sealed
the same in his presence. Junaid Khan, (PW-4) was
complainant of the case, who recovered contraband
‘chars’ and ‘heroin’ from the rear seat of motorcar and

separated samples therefrom for sending the same to
the FSL_ vide recovery memo (Ex.PW 3/1). He
drafted Murasila and sent the same to the PS for
registration of the case. He also prepared sketch
(Ex.PW 4/1) of the place of occurrence and drafted
application (Ex.PW 4/3) for sending samples of
contraband to the laboratory. He arrested both the
accused and handed over the investigation to PW-5,
Ashiq Hussain,  I[.0O. After completion of
investigation, he submitted complete challan against
the accused. (PW-5) Ashiq Hussain I.O conducted
investigation of the case and issued card of arrest of
accused (Ex.PW 5/1 and Ex.PW 5/2). He verified
the recovery sketch (Ex.PW 4/1) through
eyewitnesses. He recorded statements of PWs under
section 161 Cr.P.C. He placed on record positive
report of FSL (Ex.PW 5/6) and extract from Register-
19 (Ex.PW 5/7).

4. Thereafter, the present appellant alongwith
co-accused-convict recorded his statement under
Section 342 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1898,
wherein, they pleaded innocence and false implication
and denied the recovery of contraband, however, they

wished not to produce defence or to be examined on
Oath as their own witnesses. The trial Court after
considering the evidence produced by the prosecution,
convicted the appellant and co-accused Hayat Khan
and sentenced them, as mentioned hereinabove.

5. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
parties heard and perused the record with their
valuable assistance.

6. In this case, the prosecution relied upon
the evidence of five witnesses, who all are police
officials. However, on analysis of the evidence of the
prosecution, we found noticeable contradictions on
material aspects of the case in the statements of
marginal witness (PW-3) of recovery memo Ex.PW
3/1 and complainant (PW-4), as the former stated that
recovery was effected from the rear seat of the car
No.4165, while the latter stated that he recovered the
contra band from the secret cavities made behind the
rear seat. However, at the time of exhibition of car,
no effort was made by the prosecution to exhibit the
secret cavities of the car. It is also evident from
record of the case, that the car in question was also
not examined by an expert with respect to the said

secret cavities. PW-3, Kamran stated that the
Murasila (Ex.PA/1), recovery memo (Ex.PW 3/1)
and site plan (Ex.PW 4/1) were in the handwriting of
PW-4 and he put his signatures on these documents in
his presence. However, there is marked difference
between handwriting of Murasila (Ex.PA/1), site plan
(Ex.PW 4/1) and recovery memo (Ex.PW 3/1) as
well as signature of PW-4 thereon.

7. There are also noticeable discrepancies in the
prosecution case. The complainant (PW-4) admitted
during cross-examination that name of Constable
Mohsin No.674 mentioned in Murasila, was not
mentioned in Daily Diary No.13 and 20 (Ex.PW 4/2),
showing departure and arrival of PW-4 alongwith
police party to the police station. It is also important
to note that the parcels mentioned in recovery memo
(Ex.PW 3/1) mentioned the stamps in the name of
“SK”, whereas, the name of PW-4 complainant is
Junaid Khan, thus, the said parcels should have
contain stamp of (JK) instead of (SK). It is also
noteworthy that vide Ex.PW 5/7 (copy of Register-
19) parcels of samples were shown to have sent to
FSL through Receipt No.86/21, whereas Ex.PW 4/3

(Application for sending parcels to FSL) contained
number of receipt Rahadari as 84/21 instead of
receipt No.86/21. Moreover, there is nothing
available on record of the case, which could establish
that the FSL has ever received the samples through
Receipt No.86/21 sent to it on 12.04.2016 for
chemical examination. | Apart from the above, the
application (Ex.PW 4/3) also does not contain the
date. Moreover, there was delay of one week in
sending the said parcels to the FSL, as the alleged
recovery was effected on 05.04.2016 and the parcels
were received in the FSL, Peshawar on 12.04.2016
and no explanation has been furnished for the delay in
sending the said samples. PW-1 has also admitted
that there was overwriting on Ex.PW 1/1, having
without any initial thereon. Additionally, nothing is
forthcoming in the evidence of the prosecution with
regard to safe custody of the samples during the
intervening period. The aforementioned material
contradictions and discrepancies created major dents
in the case of prosecution against the appellant.

8. All these contradictions and discrepancies in
the prosecution evidence create serious doubts about

the recovery of contra band from the possession of the
accused, as alleged by the prosecution. It is well
settled law that even a single doubt, if found
reasonable, would entitle the accused person to
acquittal and not a combination of several doubts.
Reliance is placed on case titled Ghulam Qadir Vs.
The State (2008 SCMR 1221), wherein, it has held

that:

“It needs no reiteration that for the purpose
of giving benefit of doubt to an accused
person, more than one infirmity is not
required, a_ single infirmity crating
reasonable doubt in the mind of a
reasonable and prudent mind regarding the
truth of charge-makers the whole case
doubtful. Merely because the burden is on
accused to prove his innocence it does not
absolve the prosecution to prove its case
against the accused beyond any shadow of
doubt in this duty does not change or vary in
the case.”

Reliance is also placed on case law reported as_2009
SCMR 230 and 1995 SCMR 1345.

9. Accordingly, for the reasons _ stated
hereinabove, we hold that the prosecution has failed to
prove its case beyond any reasonable doubt against
the appellant, hence, we accept the appeal of Yaseen
Ali, set aside the conviction and sentence awarded to
him by the learned trial Court vide impugned
judgment dated 27.10.2016 and while extending

benefit of doubt to the appellant, acquit him of the
10

charge leveled against him in the present case. He be
released forthwith, if not required in any other case.
Above are the detailed reasons for short
order of this Court of even date.
10. So far as the case of co-accused convict
Hayat Khan is concerned, though he has not filed appeal
against his conviction before this Court, however, in view
of the acquittal of appellant Yaseen Ali and keeping in
view the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present
case, when particularly his role is also not distinguishable
from the appellant, both on legal as well as on factual
premises, hence, it would be inappropriate to withheld
the benefit of this judgment on the ground that he has
not filed an appeal against his conviction before this
Court. In this respect, this Court placed reliance on
dicta of the august Apex Court in case titled
Muhabbat Ali and another Vs. The State (1985
SCMR 662), wherein, it was observed that:

“In view of the above discussion, we are
satisfied that the prosecution has failed to
establish the case against the appellants
beyond reasonable doubt. We would,
therefore, allow the appeal, and acquit the
appellants, who should be set at liberty
forthwith unless required in connection with
some other case. As regards the non-
appealing convict, Muhammad Ramzan, we

direct that the benefit of acceptance of this
11

appeal shall also be extended to him who
Shall stand acquitted and will be set at
liberty forthwith if not required in any other
case. In granting such benefit to
Muhammad Ramzan, we are supported by
decision of this Court in the case of
Muhammad Aslam and 5 others v. The
State 1972 SCMR 194.”

Similarly, the august Apex Court has recently

extended benefit of acquittal to non-appealing accused

in Hashim Qasim’s case (2017 SCMR 986), and in

this regard has observed that:

11.

“So far as the case of non-appealing
accused, Shoaib Ahmed is concerned,
as we have already mentioned that
notice for enhancement of sentence was
given to him in Crl. P. 161/13, and
when his case too is not distinguishable
on any factual and legal premises from
the appellants, therefore, he is also
entitled to and deserves the same
treatment. Reference may be made to
the cases of Haji Syed Rafi Ahmed vy.
Additional Sessions Judge, Rawalpindi
and others (PLD 1992 SC 251) and
Muhabbat Ali v. The State (1985 SCMR
662). Accordingly, he (Shoaib Ahmed)
too is extended the benefit of doubt and
is acquitted of all the charges leveled
against him. All the accused, including
Shoaib Ahmed (non appealing accused)
be set free forthwith, if not required in

any other case.”
(Emphasis provided)

Therefore, while drawing wisdom from

the aforementioned decisions of the august Apex

Court, we also extend the benefit of this judgment to
12

the non-appealing convict (Hayat Khan). He is,
therefore, acquitted of the charges leveled against him
in this case. He be also released forthwith, if not

required in any other case.
