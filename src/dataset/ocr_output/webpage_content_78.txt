Mr. Muhammad Saleem GN Jessar, advocate for applicant. 
Miss Rubina, State counsel.
                   -----
 
          Heard
the learned counsel for the applicant and the learned State counsel. This is a
bail application under section 497, Cr.P.C on behalf of the applicant/accused
Abdullah s/o Shah Muhammad Khatian, who has been was arrested on 28.4.2008 on
account of the F.I.R bearing Crime No. 56/2008 Police Station Warrah under
section 302, 120-B, 34, P.P.C registered on 13.4.2008 at 1900 hours in respect
of the incident of the same day at 1800 hours in which the complainant alleged
that out of the four persons he was one of them armed with 222 Rifle and made
firing and caused death of deceased Wazir Ali, the brother of the complainant. 
          The
learned counsel contended that his application is only on the ground of alibi
because the applicant was not even in Pakistan at the time of alleged incident.
He has relied upon the Passport and the Ticket, annexures ‘E’ and ‘F’, which
show that he left Pakistan through Qaid-e-Azam Airport, Karachi on 13.3.2008 at
1-00 p.m. and reached at Dubai on the same day and then came back on 15.4.2008
after knowing that a false case has been registered against him but when he
returned, he was arrested. He has produced the originals of these two documents
i.e. Passport and the Air Ticket for the inspection by the Court. 
          The
learned State counsel did not oppose the above arguments and contended that
since the applicant has produced sufficient material to show that at the time
of the alleged incident he was not present in Pakistan, therefore, he is
entitled to the concession of bail as the case is covered under subsection (2)
of Section 497, Cr.P.C.
          I have
carefully considered the above arguments in the light of the record and
examined the Air Ticket as well as Passport of the applicant/accused specially
both the entries and stamps of Immigration Officials for entries and exits at
Karachi and Dubai Airports which clearly show that the applicant had left
Pakistan from the Quaid Azam Airport Karachi at 1-00 pm  On 13.4.2008 and
entered Pakistan from the same Airport on 15.5.2008 whereas the incident has been
shown to have taken place in the F.I.R at 6-00 p.m. on 13.4.2006 therefore,
prima facie the contention of the learned counsel for the applicant has immense
force that the applicant was not present even in Pakistan at the time of
incident. In these circumstances, he is granted bail subject to furnishing
surety in the sum of Rs.100,000/- and P.R bond in the like amount to the
satisfaction of the trial Court.
