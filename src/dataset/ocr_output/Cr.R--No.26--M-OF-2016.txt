ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- This Criminal

Revision under 439 Cr.P.C is directed against
the order dated 17.2.2016 rendered by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zila
Qazi-VI, Swat, whereby complaint of the

petitioners was dismissed.

2. | Background of the instant
revision petition is that the present
respondents filed a complaint against the
petitioners before the Deputy Commissioner,
Swat, thus, the petitioners also brought a

complaint u/s 500 P.P.C against them in the

Sabz Ail" (5.8) HON’BLE MR, JUSTICE ISHTIAO IBRAHIM
C,

Court of Sessions Judge/Zila Qazi, Swat who
entrusted the same to the learned Additional
Sessions Judge/Izafi Zila Qazi-VI, Swat. Later
on, the petitioner filed an application for
withdrawal of the said complaint with
permission to present it before the proper
forum, they were allowed and consequently
they filed a fresh complaint before the learned
Judicial Magistrate/Illaqa Qazi-Il, Swat and
after recording statements u/s 200 Cr.P.C, the
complaint was forwarded to the learned
Sessions judge u/s 190 (2) Cr.P.C as the same
was triable by the Court of Session, which was
assigned to the learned Additional Sessions
Judge/Izafi Zila Qazi-VI, Swat for disposal.
The respondents were summoned and after
arguments on maintainability of the
complaint, it was dismissed vide the impugned
order dated 17.2.2017 on the ground that once
the petitioners have already withdrawn their

complaint of similar nature and subsequent

Sabz Ali" ($.8) HON’ BLE MR, JUSTICE ISHTIAO IBRAHIM
complaint is not competent, hence, this

revision petition.

3. ‘Learned counsel for the
petitioners contended that the according to law
the petitioners were granted permission by the
Court at the time of withdrawal of the first
complaint to file a fresh one, whereafter they
have filed the subsequent complaint which
was entrusted to learned trial Court for
disposal; that the impugned order is not
| appealable but it is revisable as the
respondents have not been acquitted; that the
provisions of section 248 Cr.P.C are
applicable only to those cases which are
pending before the Court of Magistrates and
these are not applicable to the complaints
which are triable by the Court of Session, as
such, the learned trial Court has not applied
its judicial mind while dismissing complaint
of the petitioners has not followed the law in
its true perspective, therefore, the learned trial

Court by passing the impugned order has

SabzAli* (SB)  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAO IBRAHIM
committed gross illegality. He further
contended that complaint of petitioners was
not dismissed on merits but was dismissed on
technical ground to present it before proper
forum, thus, there was no bar in filing of the
subsequent complaint. He requested for
reversal of the impugned order of the learned

trial Court.

4. Learned counsel for the
respondents strongly opposed the above
contentions by stating that as the petitioners
have withdrawn their complaint and as per
section 248 Cr.P.C, the subsequent complaint
dismissed through the impugned order was not
competent; that the revision of the petitioners
not competent as the learned trial Court has
dismissed whole complaint and that the
impugned judgment given by the learned trial
Court is well reason, which is not open to any
interference or exception, therefore, the same

is liable to be dismissed.

SabzAl/” (SB)  HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE ISHTIAO IBRAHIM
5. Learned Additional Advocate
General supported the contentions of learned

counsel for the petitioners and requested for

acceptance of the revision petition.

6, Before proceeding further with
this revision petition, it is necessary to see as
to whether the impugned order of the learned
trial Court is revisable under 439 Cr.P.C or
appealable under 417 (2) Cr.P.C and as to
whether a complaint withdrawn would
amount to acquittal of the accused and the
subsequent complaint would be barred u/s 403

Cr.P.C or otherwise.

7. The provision of section 248 of

the Cr.P.C in unequivocal terms provides that:

“248. Withdrawal of Complaint. If a
complainant, at any time before a
final order is passed in any case
under this Chapter, satisfies the
Magistrate that there are sufficient
grounds for permitting him to
withdraw his complaint the
Magistrate may permit him to
withdraw the same and _ shall
thereupon acquit the accused.”

Sabz Ali” (S.B) HON’ BLE MR. JUSTICE [SHTIAO JBRAHIM
The above provision of the Code
of Criminal Procedure is only for the
Magistrate and no reference is there with
regard to the complaint pending in the Court
of Session or an offence which is triable by
the Court of Sessions Judge. Section 248 is
embodied in Chapter XX of the Criminal
Procedure Code, which deals with the cases
triable by the Magistrates, therefore, this
Court cannot by implication consider section
248 Cr.P.C as applicable in complaint cases
which are triable by the court of Session
because Chapter XXII-A of the Cr.P.C
provides independent mechanism for the trial

of offences by the Court of Session.

8. Moreover, by virtue of an
amendment made in the Pakistan Penal Code
in the year 2004, section 502-A PPC was
inserted therein. For convenience, section

502-A P.P.C is reproduced herein below.

“502-A, Trial of offence under this
Chapter. Notwithstanding anything
contained in the code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898), the

Sabz All" (S.B) = HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAO IBRAHIM
Court of Session shall have the
Jurisdiction to try an offence under this
Chapter and decide it within a period of
ninety days.”

So, in view of this amendment,
the Court of Session can entertain a complaint
filed u/s 500 of the CRP.C as the amendment
in the relevant chapter XXI of the P.P.C
relating to the matter of defamation. Wisdom
in this regard, can well be derived from the
judgment of this Court reported as 2016 P Cr.

L J 1469, wherein it has been held that:

“16. In view the above
discussion, it can safely be held
that the offences under Chapter
XXI of PPC shall be tried only
by Court of Session, however,
cognizance is to be taken by the
Magistrate under section 190,
Cr.P.C. No Court of Session
Shall take cognizance of any
offence as a Court of original
jurisdiction unless the case is
sent to it by a Magistrate under
section 193, sub-section (1) of
the Code of Criminal
Procedure.”

9. In addition to the above, the
complaint was referred to the learned trial
Court by the Judicial Magistrate after

compliance of the provision of section 190 (2)

Sabz Ali/* (S.B) HON’ BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAO IBRAHIM
Cr.P.C. Needless to say that order of

withdrawal of the first complaint is not an

order construing acquittal of the accused. In

other word, there is nothing which would

attract the provision of section 403 of the

Cr.P.C. In this regard, I would like to refer

herein below section 403 of the Cr.P.C for

ready reference.

Sabz Ali (8.8)

“403. Persons once convicted or
acquitted not to be tried for the same
offence. (1) A person who has once
been tried by a Court of competent
jurisdiction for an offence and
convicted or acquitted of such offence
shall, while such conviction or acquittal
remains in force, not to be liable to be
tried again for the same offence, nor on
the same facts for any other offence for
which a different charge from the one
made against him might have been
made under section 36, or for which he
might have been convicted under
section 237.

(2) A person acquitted or convicted for
any offence may be afterwards tried for
any distinct offence for which a
separate charge might have been made
against him on the former trial under
sections 235, subsection (1).

(3) A person convicted of any offence
constituted by any act causing
consequences which together with such
act, constituted a different offence from
that of which he was convicted, may be
afterwards tried for such last-mentioned
offence, if the consequence had not
happened, or were not happened, or

HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE ISHTIAO IBRAHIM
were not known to the Court to have
happened, at the time when he was
convicted.

(4) A person acquitted or convicted of
any offence constituted by any acts may,
notwithstanding such acquittal or
conviction, be subsequently charged
with, and tried for any other offence
constituted by the same acts which he
may have committed if the Court by
which he was first tried was not
competent to try the offence with which
he is subsequently charged.

(5) Nothing in this section shall affect
the provision of section 26 of the
General Clauses Act, 1897, or section
188 of this Code.

Explanation. The dismissal of a
complaint, the stopping of proceedings
under section 249 [or the discharge of
the accused] is not acquittal for the
purposes of this section.”

The above explanation to this
section apparently shows that the dismissal of
a complaint as well as stopping of
proceedings under section 249 Cr.P.C or the
discharge of an accused is not acquittal. In
this regard, reliance is placed on the case of
‘Azmat Bibi and another Vs. Asifa Riaz and
3_other’ reported as PLD 2002 Supreme

Court 687, wherein the following precedent

was laid down:

fonnnnS 248----Withdrawal of
complaint—Provision of 8.248 Cr.P.C-

Sabz Ali" (S.B) HON’BLE MR, JUSTICE ISHTIAO IBRAHIM
-10-

--Applicability—Where the complaint
was dismissed for non-prosecution, the
provision of S.248 Cr.P.C would not be
attracted---Provision of S.248 Cr.P.C
would be applicable only in those cases
where the trial had commenced.”

As stated earlier that there exists
no order with regard to the acquittal or
conviction of the accused, however, it is
crystal clear that the earlier Complaint has
been withdrawn by the petitioners with the
condition to file a fresh complaint, therefore,
in these circumstances the provision of
section 248 Cr.P.C would not be applicable to
the case in hand. Moreso, record reveals that
the previous complaint was withdrawn by the
petitioners only on the ground to file a fresh
complaint before the proper forum, thereafter
they have brought fresh complaint which after
compliance of the provisions of section 190
(2) Cr.P.C was referred to the Court of
Session being triable by it. The application for
withdrawal of the complaint is clear to the
effect that they be given permission to
approach proper forum but the words “with

permission to file a fresh complaint before

Sabz Al" (S.8)  HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTJAO IBRAHIM
-1l-

proper forum” are not mentioned in the order
dated 16.11.2015, whereby in light of the
application of the petitioners, their complaint
was dismissed as withdrawn. However, the
said order is also mute that why they were not
granted permission for filing fresh complaint
before proper forum, so, in _ these
circumstances, it can safely be said that it
would be the result of inadvertence.
Therefore, the subsequent complaint filed by
the petitioners before the learned trial Court
was competent in view of the conditional
withdrawal of the earlier complaint. Reliance
is placed on the case of ‘ Nazar Ahmad Vs.

Muhammad _Aslam_ and 2 others (1988 P

Cr.LJ 1787), wherein it has been held as
under:

“S$, 248-Complaint, case—Withdrawal

of ---Challenge to---Whether
complaint can be withdrawn by
Complainant—Question of---A

complaint in summons case triable
under Chapter XX can only be
withdrawn with permission of
Magistrate--- Instant case was not
triable under Chapter XX of Cr.P.C.
Held: Additional Sessions Judge had
no authority to permit complainant to
withdraw complaint or to dismiss it as

Sabz Ali” (S.B)  HON’BLEMR. JUSTICE JSHTIAO JBRAHIM
-12-

having been withdrawn—Case
remanded for proceedings in
accordance with law”.

Situation in the above referred
case and that of this case is almost similar as
in light of the above judgment, the learned
trial Court ie. the Court of Additional
Sessions Judge was having no authority to
permit the withdrawal of the complaint. In
this case most particularly through an
application the earlier complaint was
withdrawn with permission to file a fresh one
in accordance with law. Moreover, the earlier
complaint was not decided on merits rather
the same has been withdrawn on the ground
of procedural defect coupled with the fact that
the respondents have not earned their
acquittal, therefore, the question of acquittal
does not arise here. It is also settled principal
of law that no person should be knocked out
in respect of his rights on the basis of mere
technicality. Therefore, this revision petition
is very much competent in the circumstances

highlighted above.

10. For what has been discussed
above, this revision petition is allowed. The
impugned order dated 17.2.2016 is set aside
and resultantly complaint of the petitioners is
restored with the directions to the learned trial
Court to proceed further with the complaint in
accordance with law. It is pertinent to note
here that the learned trial Court shall not be
swayed by the above observations of this
Court as the same are limited only for the
disposal of this revision petition.
