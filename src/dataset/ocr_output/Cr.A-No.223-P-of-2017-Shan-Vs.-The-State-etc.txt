JUDGMENT

Appellant(s)...(Shan): By M/S Shabbir Hussain Gigyani and Farman

Ullah Sailab, Advocates.

Respondent(s)/State: By Mr. Muhammad Riaz Khan Paindakhel,
AA

QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- This criminal
appeal by Shan, appellant/accused, is
directed against the judgment/order of the
learned trial Court/Additional Sessions Judge-
III/Judge Special Court, Peshawar, dated
06.04.2017, whereby, the appellant was
convicted under section 9 (c) CNSA and
sentenced to eight years R.l. and fine of
Rs.50,000/- and in default thereof to further

S.| for six months.
2. The impugned judgment, conviction
and sentences emanated from case FIR
No.1281 dated 17.09.2015 under section 9 (c)
CNSA, registered in Police Station,
Hayatabad, Peshawar, on the report of Akram
Khan, complainant/ASI, who was present on
routine patrol duty when received spy
information about smuggling of heroin in
Datsun bearing No.J-1107 from tribal territory,
whereupon he laid a barricade and stopped
the said Datsun. The driver of the Datsun
disclosed his name as Shan son of Umar Gul
resident of Afghanistan, presently residing in
Shahkas, Jamrud; and search of the Datsun
led to the recovery of ten packets of heroin,
weighing ten kilograms, from a secret cavity
on the driver side. The complainant/ASI
separated 1/1 gram heroin from each of the
ten packets as samples for chemical analysis
in the FSL, and sealed the same in parcels,
while separately sealed the remaining heroin;
and took into possession the Datsun, and also

arrested the appellant/accused; and sent the
murasila to Police Station Hayatabad,
Peshawar, where case was registered, as
mentioned hereinabove. The samples were
received in the FSL on 28.09.2015, and
chemical examiner furnished his positive
report on 05.10.2015. After recording
statements of PWs under Section 161 Cr.P.C
and completion of investigation, complete
challan was submitted against the
appellant/accused to the _ learned _ trial
Court/ASJ-III/Judge, Special Court, Peshawar.
3. The learned = trial Court/ASJ-III,
Peshawar, after compliance with the
mandatory provision of Section 265-C Cr.P.C,
framed formal charge against the
accused/appellant, under Section 9 (c) CNSA,
to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed
trial. In order to prove its case against the
accused facing trial/appellant, the prosecution
produced six PWs, including Akram
Khan(PW.1), complainant/ASI; (Muhammad
Riaz Khan ASI (PW.2), witness who received

the case property consisting of the remaining
quantity of heroin, samples and Datsun
bearing No.J-1107; Khalid Khan SI (PW.3)
registered FIR (EXPA) on the receipt of
murasila in the P.S; Malik Habib Khan SHO
(PW.4) submitted complete challan after
completion of investigation; Anwar Ali Oll
(PW.5) conducted investigation in the case;
and Sikandar Khan constable (PW.6),
marginal witness to the recovery memo
(EXPW1/1). After prosecution closed its
evidence, statement of the accused was
recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein,
he refuted allegations of the prosecution but
declined to be examined on oath or produce
defence. Thereafter, the learned trial Court
ASJ.III/Judge, Special Court, Peshawar,
heard arguments of learned APP on behalf of
the State and learned counsel for the
accused: and rendered the impugned
judgment dated 06.04.2017, whereby, the
accused/appellant was convicted under
Section 9 (c) CNSA and awarded the

sentences of imprisonment for eight years and
fine of Rs.50,000/-, or in default thereof, to six
months S.l; which are impugned herein
through the instant appeal.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for the
appellant/accused and learned Additional AG
heard; and record perused.

5. The case of the prosecution against
the appellant/accused is that he was driving
Datsun No.J-1107 at the relevant time when
recovery of ten packets of heroin weighing ten
kilograms was made from a secret cavity on
the driver side; but statements of the PWs
were not consistent on this point as Anwar Ali
Oll (PW.5) stated that the secret cavity was
prepared in the door of the driver side of the
Datsun and Constable Sikandar Khan (PW.6)
stated that the secret cavity was available on
the right side of the driver; while the
complainant/ASI (PW.1) contradicted them by
saying that the secret cavity was made in the
rear partition (portion) of the vehicle in
question and that from the rear Partition

(portion) he meant floor of the Datsun in
question. No doubt, police officers/officials are
as good witnesses as any other witnesses;
but their testimony need to be accepted with
great care and caution, particularly, when
there is prior information and_ the
complainant/Police Officers have sufficient
time to arrange presence of independent
witnesses. In this case, the complainant/ASl,
however, preferred to cite police officials, and
his subordinates, as marginal witnesses to the
recovery memo. In such a situation, the
material contradictions with regard to the
alleged recovery, pointed out above, would
prove fatal for the case of prosecution.
Besides, there is nothing on the record to
prove that the appellant/accused was owner
of the Datsun or that he was driver and driving
the Datsun at the time of alleged recovery
from the Datsun. It is an admitted fact that
neither anything incriminating was recovered
from the personal search of _ the
appellant/accused by the complainant/ASl,

nor there was any record of involvement of the
appellant/accused in such like case or in any
other criminal activity in the past.

6. Moreover, the samples, reportedly,
separated from the recovered heroin after the
alleged recovery on 17.09.2015 were received
for chemical analysis in the FSL_ after
considerable delay of 11 days on 28.09.2015,
without either any explanation for such an
inordinate delay or evidence with regard to
safe custody of the samples during the
intervening period from the date of recovery
up-to receipt of the samples in the FSL; rather
evidence of the prosecution in this regard
indicate total confusion, as according to the
1.0 (PW.5), he recorded statement of Muharrir
of the P.S regarding sending the sample on
17.09.2015 and that the Muharrir told him that
he had already sent the samples to FSL
through Mustafa constable; but neither
Mustafa Constable was mentioned as a PW in
the challan form; nor, as such, produced as a
PW in the Court. Even registers No.19 and 21

were not produced in the Court, and only
unattested photo copies of the said registers
were produced, which could hardly prove safe
custody of the samples while they were lying
in the Police Station before their dispatch to
the FSL so as to make report of the FSL

credible and worthy of reliance.

7. Needless to say that in such like
cases evidence pertaining to recovery,
together with report of the FSL, form the two
material pieces of evidence, and once they
are declared not worthy of reliance, nothing is
left to warrant conviction of an accused for a
charge under CNSA. Keeping in view the
foregoing discussion, the prosecution was
unable to prove its case against the
appellant/accused beyond any shadow of
doubt, therefore, his conviction on the basis of
material available before the learned trial
Court would not be sustainable.

8. Consequently, the appeal is accepted,
and the impugned judgment of the learned

trial Court dated 06.04.2017, conviction of the
appellant/accused under Section 9 (c) CNSA
and sentences of imprisonment for eight years
and fine of Rs.50,000/- awarded to him by the
learned trial Court are set aside. The
appellant/accused is acquitted of the charges;

and be set free forthwith, if not required in any

other case.

Announced.
