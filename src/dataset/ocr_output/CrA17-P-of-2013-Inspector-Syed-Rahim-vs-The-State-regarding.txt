2. The background of proceedings against
the three police officers by the learned Judge
Anti-Terrorism Court-lll, Peshawar, briefly stated
is that on the report of one Gul Zaman,
complainant, the case mentioned hereinabove
was registered about kidnapping for ransom of his
brother Shah Zaman alias Zalmay, who was
recovered subsequently and accused in the main
case were also arrested; and after initial inquiry
under section 156(2) Cr.P.C, and investigation,
challan was submitted to the trial Court/Anti-
Terrorism Court; where, after trial, accused in the
case were acquitted; and the accused police
officers alongwith DSP Shah Nawaz Khan were
charge sheeted as under;

“1, That you DSP Shah Nawaz Khan was
under obligation to perform your duties
as per law/rules governing the same.
That case property i.e. motorcars were

unauthorizedly taken out of PS
Nowshera Cantt soon after its recovery
by you with the connivance of the then
SHO PS Nowshera Cantt Mr. Sher Afsar
Khan and the same were kept with fake
number plates and found in tidy condition
at the time of exhibition before the court
suggesting its use for private purpose
and thus you have committed breach in
the discharge of your duties i.e. to keep
and secure material evidence of the
crime and do not create circumstances

pregnant with mala-fide and doubt;

That you Inspector Sher Afsar Khan as
SHO of PS Nowshera Cantt during the
days of occurrence was under obligation
to perform your dirties honestly and in
accordance with law/rules. You has not
only failed to discharge your duties with
the required care and caution besides be
honest and truthful in actions as appear

from the following;-

You have deposed before the court

that on 01/03/2012 you received spy
information of transportation of
abductee Shah Zaman by the
acquitted accused in two motorcars and
thus placing Naka Bandi, you
succeeded in arrest of the accused and
recovery of abductee leading to
recoveries including three pistols with
cartridges from possession of acquitted
accused Khan Mohammad, Abdul Sattar
and Mohammad Saleem and prepared

recovery memo of the same under your
I.

MM.

signature of the said date available on
case file of FIR No.132 u/s 13 AO
registered by you separately against the
aforesaid accused. Zamima-A and Fard
Khulasa_ both available under your
signature of 01.03.2012 bear the facts of
production of aforesaid accused before
the court of Judicial Magistrate within the
time of 08:30 to 1200 hours and
thereafter obtaining their judicial remand
and handing over them to jail authorities.
The aforesaid record of you under your
signature has not only rendered false
your version of arrest and recovery at
16:40 hours on 01.03.2012 but has
apparently made the record about their
arrest, recovery and sketch fabricated
which is criminal office on its own
besides evidence of committing breach in

discharge of your duties.

You have handed over motorcars soon
after its alleged recovery bearing
registration No.MBV-712 Islamabad and
9653-RIA to Sls Chiragh Shah and
Jehanzeb to be handed over to DSP
Shah Nawaz posted at police line and
thus committed breach in discharge of
your obligatory duties to keep and secure
case property material evidence of a

case and save it from misuse etc.

That you SI Irshad Khan was handed
over enquiry u/s 156 of Cr.P.C by the
SHO PS Nowshera Cantt on receipt of
IV.

Vi.

application dated 26.12.2011 of the

complainant Gul Zaman.

That you proceeded with the enquiry
without getting permission of the
concerned Magistrate as per law and
thus violated the mandatory law for such

proceedings.

That you have conducted enquiry but the
enquiry file is not handed over to IO to be
placed on judicial record and as such
possibility of suppression of material
evidence by you cannot be ruled out.
Legally you were bound to have handed
over the enquiry file to the IO on
registration of case and would have
entered the reference of proceedings
conduced by you in register No.2 of PS
an obligation you appears to have

violated;

That recording statement as PW-04, you
have suppressed the fact of your posting
at PP Badrashai on the day of alleged
arrest and recovery in the case and
knowingly stated wrongly that you were
member of investigation staff of the PS
and was present with SHO at Naka
Bandi while on record you were available
in Police Lines Nowshera at the relevant
time of recovery and arrest as per DD
No.8 and No.13 of PP Badrashai dated
01/03/2012 and as such have committed

breach in discharge of you duties
Vil.

besides recording false statement before

the court a criminal offence on its own;

That you Said Raheem Khan Inspector
conducted investigation in the subject
criminal case and was under obligation to
find out truth about the alleged abduction
and arrest of accused and recovery of

abductee on the relevant dates;

Vill. That you failed to enquire about the fact

IX.

XI.

of abduction of Shah Zaman in the area
where he was allegedly carrying out
business of cloth and no evidence
whatsoever worth name was collected in

this respect.

That the enquiry file in the case
conducted by SI Irshad Khan was also
not brought on judicial record to ascertain
properly and definitely the whole
proceedings conducted by him since
26/12/2011 till the date of registration of
FIR i.e. 20/02/2012;

That as IO you were under obligation to
questions SI Irshad Khan about his
application for information of CDR and
location of cell number 0332-8599488
and 0300-8583786 when these numbers
were not at all referred to by the

complainant party.

You did not question SI Irshad Khan
about another important fact showing his
intimacy with the occurrence when he
recorded in application dated 27/12/2011
that mobile number 0332/0300-8599488
Xi.

were with the abductee at the time of his
abduction as to how these information
were obtained by SI Irshad Khan when
not disclosed by complainant in his
application and in statement of Ismail
and Haji Gulab.

That another important fact found
reference in Zemini dated 21/02/2012
and in statement of abductee recorded
on 01/03/2012 that the motorcar of
abductee was_ received by the
complainant party after settlement with
the abductors. A material fact to have
been enquired upon that may have led to
the truth has not been enquired and you

failed to investigate the case on this line;

XIII. Similarly motorcars MB 712 Islamabad

and 9653-FIA were not taken into
possession and similarly no investigation
was conduced in this regard while
actually both the motorcars were taken
out of the jurisdiction of concerned PS
and were apparently used with a fake

number;

XIV.That relevant facts of case file under

section 13 AO against three of the
acquitted accused of the case were not
even touched by you to show an attempt
on your part to find the truth which on
perusal was found with documentary
proof of their arrest prior to the alleged

recovery and arrest on 01/03/2012;
XV. That PW Irshad Khan was shown to be
present at the time of arrest of accused
and recovery of abductee at Naka Bandi
while on record he was found to be
present at police line Nowshera at the
relevant time as per record of PP
Badrashai and you failed to find out this
important fact thus as a whole you have
never attempted to fine out the truth and
failed to dig out those facts which were
found during trial proceedings. As IO you
did not question the three separate
proceedings carried about one case and
its consequences on trial besides
creating shadow of doubts and mala-fide.
As a whole you failed to (carry out
investigation properly and your these
acts of omission and commission
constitute an offence of defective
investigation).

And whereas you were asked to
submit reply to the aforesaid lapses in
investigation constituting offence of
breach in discharge of duties defective
investigation on your parts respectively
and your replies in this respect were
found non satisfactory, therefore this
court decided to charge you u/s 27 Anti-
Terrorism Act, 1997 which falls in the
jurisdiction of this court and as such |
Syed Asghar Ali Shah,  ATC-IIl,
Peshawar do hereby charge you
accused under section 27 ATA, 1997 and
direct that you will be tried by this Court

under the said charges.”
3. DSP Shah Nawaz Khan, however,
approached this Court and sought quashment of
notice under section 27 ATA, 1997 dated
29.09.2012 through writ petition No.3158-P/2012,
which was allowed and notice issued to him was
withdrawn vide judgment/order dated 04.12.2012,
therefore, rest of the proceedings were conducted
against the remaining three police officers i.e. the
appellants in these two connected criminal
appeals, during which, they submitted their
replies, which were found unsatisfactory; and
their statements were also recorded in question
and answer format; followed by the impugned
judgment whereby all the three police
officers/appellants were convicted under section
27 ATA, and awarded the punishment of payment
of fine of Rs.10000/-,each, and in case of failure
to pay the fine, to undergo simple imprisonment
for one month; hence the instant two criminal
appeals.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for the
appellants and learned AAG heard; and record
perused.

5. The judgment/order dated 29.09.2012 of

the learned Judge Ant-Terrorism Court,
Peshawar, impugned in criminal appeal No.635-
P/2012 would show that accused in the main
case were acquitted, mainly, on the basis of
discrepancies, shortcomings, contradictions,
improvements and, above all, defective
investigation by the appellants, who remained
associated with enquiry and investigation in the
case at different stages; but demonstrated
irresponsible, inefficient and incompetent
behavior, which proved detrimental to the
prosecution case.

6. From the very inception, after the
complainant, Gul Zaman, reported disappearance
of his brother, Shah Zaman, on 15.12.2011, when
he left his home situated in Regi Lalma,
Peshawar alongwith one Ismail in motorcar
No.APL-2011 for Islamabad, the local police
failed to conduct the initial enquiry and then
investigation in accordance with the requirements
of law and police rules; as neither FIR was
registered nor order of the Magistrate for
conducting enquiry was obtained; and even
record of the enquiry was not made available so
as to ascertain what proceedings were conducted

by SI Irshad Khan who was entrusted with
enquiry under section 156 Cr.P.C by the SHO PS,
Nowshera Canit, on the receipt of
application/complaint of Gul Zaman complainant
dated 26.12.2011. This conduct of SI Irshad Khan
gave rise to the suspicion that he might have
suppressed material facts and evidence which
could lead to conviction of the accused in the
case. The said SI while recoding his statement as
PW-4 also made a misstatement about his
posting in PP Badrashai during the period of
alleged arrest and recovery in the case and
deliberately furnished wrong information that he
was member of investigation staff of the Police
Station and was present with the SHO at Naka
Bandi (barricade) while the record, particularly DD
Nos.8 and 13 of PP Badrashai, showed his
presence in Police Lines, Nowshera, on the date
of arrest and recovery i.e. 01.03.2012.

7. Likewise, Sher Afsar Khan SHO PS,
Nowshera Cantt, recorded statement in the Court
about receiving spy _ information about
transportation of abductee, Shah Zaman, by the
accused in two motorcars on 01.03.2012, and
they were allegedly intercepted at the Naka

Bandi, leading to arrest of the accused, recovery
of abductee, recoveries of three pistols with
cartridges from possession of accused Khan
Mohammad, Abdus Sattar and Mohammad
Saleem vide recovery memo bearing signature of
the SHO on the said date available on case file of
FIR No.132 under section 13 AO, registered
separately; and Zamima-A and Fard Khulasa
dated 01.03.2012 also show production of
accused before the Court of Judicial Magistrate
within 08:30 to 1200 hours, wherefrom their
judicial remand was obtained and they were
handed over to jail authorities; but the record
prepared with his signature falsify the above
facts and show the arrest and recovery at 16:40
hours on 01.03.2012, thus creating doubt about
authenticity of record of the case prepared by
him. The SHO also handed over motorcars
bearing registration No.MB-712/Islamabad and
9653-RIA to DSP Shah Nawaz posted at Police
Line, Peshawar, through Sls Chiragh Shah and
Jehanzeb immediately after the alleged recovery,
without a Court order or proper procedure for
handing over the cars to a police officer having
nothing to do with investigation of the case. The

learned Court observed that when produced in
the Court, both the cars were displaying fake
numbers and leaving no doubt about their use,
rather misuse. This act on the part of the local
police, particularly the SHO, was not only a clear
misconduct but also a criminal offence by the
police officers entrusted with the case property;
but instead of registration of a criminal case, the
learned Court only had resort to section 27 of the
Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.

8. Similarly, Inspector Said Rahim Khan was
found by the learned trial Court to have failed in
his duty of carrying out the investigation properly
and diligently and also to pursue the case
properly, as enumerated in detail in the impugned
order by the learned Judge, Anti-Terrorism Court.
The learned trial Court pointed out that the said
Inspector failed to enquire about the fact of
abduction of Shah Zaman in the area where he
was allegedly carrying out business of cloth, and
as such, collected no evidence. He also failed to
bring the enquiry file on the judicial record in
order to ascertain the whole proceedings
conducted since 26.12.2011 till the date of
registration of FIR i.e. 20.02.2012. It was also

pointed out by the learned trial Court that the
Inspector was under obligation to question Sl
Irshad Khan about his application for information
of CDR and location of cell numbers 0332-
8599488 and 0300-8583786 when these numbers
were not at all referred to by the complainant
party. According to the learned Judge, Anti-
Terrorism Court, it was still a mystery that how Sl
Irshad Khan came to know that abductee was
keeping mobile numbers 0332/0300-8599488 at
the time of abduction when neither this
information was provided to him by _ the
complainant nor the information was otherwise
available at that time. It was, indeed, intriguing
and a glaring suppression of material fact on the
part of the appellants to conceal the fact of return
of motorcar to the complainant party much before
nomination of the accused and registration of the
case. The learned Court observed that the |O was
under obligation not only to question the
complainant but also to take into custody the
motorcar as the same was material fact for
establishment of case and determination of guilt
of the accused; but reply of the 10 demonstrated
his inability and incompetency, besides his

unwillingness to work for finding out the truth.
9. All the above stated commissions and
omissions on the part of the senior police officers
of the rank of Inspectors and Sub-Inspector, in
addition to the grounds mentioned for acquittal of
the accused in the main case, and maintained by
this Court vide judgment/order of even date, not
only show dereliction in duty but also misconduct
and commission of criminal offence of breach of
trust on the part of the appellants, entrusted with
investigation of the case; thus making them liable
not only to summary proceedings under section
27 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, but also
disciplinary action for misconduct and criminal
case for breach of trust; but they were spared of
disciplinary action and criminal case for breach of
trust; and only convicted under section 27 of the
Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, and awarded symbolic
punishment of fine of Rs.10,000/-, each; which
was neither unjustified in view of overwhelming
evidence proving defective investigation because
of incompetency and lack of diligence, if not some
ulterior motive on the part of the appellants.

10. Needless to say that wherever there are
powers there must be check on the powers

through accountability of authorities exercising
such powers as a trust by the State. Obviously,
the police officers enjoy unique and vast powers
of arrest and detention, thereby curtailing the
constitutionally guaranteed rights of liberty and
freedom of the citizens. They, therefore, were to
be made accountable for misconduct or and
neglect in performance of their duty. They, as
such, deserve no leniency and were to be made
an example for others in the police force in order
to restore confidence of the general public in the
institution; which is, indeed, responsible for
protection of their life, liberty, property and
honour; and the fine of Rs.10,000/- imposed on
each of them appears akin to the letter and spirit
of law and justice.

11. Finding no merit in the appeals, both are
consequently dismissed.

Announced.
