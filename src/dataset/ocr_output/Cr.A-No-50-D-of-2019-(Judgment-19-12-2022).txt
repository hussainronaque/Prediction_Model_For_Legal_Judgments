SHAHID KHAN, J.- Through the subject
appeal, the appellant/complainant has called in
question the judgment, dated, 15.5.2019, of
learned Additional Sessions Judge/MCTC,
D.I.Khan, whereby, on conclusion of trial, the
respondents/accused namely, Hizbullah, Fazal
Rahman, Khalid Jan, Ahmad Jan, Attaullah
Khan, Abdullah Jan, Muhammad Taufeeq and
Abdul Majeed were acquitted, in case FIR

No.233, dated, 15.12.2014, under Sections 302/
-2-

324/148/149 PPC, of Police Station Daraban,

D.I.Khan.

2. The prosecution’s case, as set forth
in the crime report, is that on 25.12.2014, at
1145 hours, appellant/complainant Zeeshan Aziz
in injured condition with the dead body of his
brother Kamran Aziz, aged about 17/18 years,
reported the matter to the police, in the
Emergency Room of Civil Hospital, Daraban, to
the effect that he alongwith his deceased brother
had gone to their landed property for its
inspection. At 1100 hours, accused Hizbullah,
armed with .12 bore shotgun, Fazal armed with
30 bore pistol, Khalid Jan, armed with 30 bore
pistol, Ahmed Jan, armed with pistol, Attaullah,
armed with axe, an unknown accused son of
Attaullah and their tenants Attique son of Afzal,
Majeed son of Saeed & Makhan son of Ramzan,
armed with axe and clubs, came on the spot. The
accused Hizbullah started firing at them with his
12 bore shotgun with intention to commit their
Qatl-e-Amd, as a result of it, he and his brother
sustained injuries, whereas, his brother

succumbed to his injuries and expired on the
-3-

spot. The other accused also attacked at him with
their respective weapons due to which he
received injuries on his head and on his
eyebrow. The motive, as alleged in the report, is
dispute over landed property. The occurrence
was stated to be witnessed by the complainant as
well as his father, namely Abdul Aziz. After
commission of offence, the accused fled away.
He charged the accused for committing murder
of his brother and effective murderous attempt.
The report of the appellant/complainant was
reduced into writing in the shape of murasila
which culminated into registration of above

referred FIR.

3. On completion of investigation,
challan was drawn and routed through the
relevant prosecution’s branch followed by sent

up for trial.

4. On commencement of trial, copies
of the evidence (oral & documentary) were
delivered to the respondents/accused. They were
confronted with the statements of allegations

through formal charge, they denied the
ne

-4-

allegations and pleaded not guilty and claimed

trial.

5. The prosecution to bring home
charge against the respondents/accused, recorded
the account of twelve (12) witnesses and closed
its evidence. At the conclusion of prosecution’s
evidence, the respondents/accused were
examined under Section 342 Cr.PC. They
professed innocence and false implication in the
case. However, they neither wished to be
examined on Oath nor wanted to produce
evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial, the
learned Additional Sessions Judge/Model
Criminal Trial Court, D.I.Khan, in view of the
evidence so recorded and assistance at the bar,
arrived at the conclusion that the allegations of
respondents/accused are tainted with doubts, as
such, vide impugned judgment, dated,

15.5.2019, recorded their acquittal.

6. We have heard the arguments of
learned counsel for the parties as well as learned
Asstt: A.G, representing the State and have gone

through the record of the case.

7. It is an established principle of law
that each criminal case has its own peculiar
facts and circumstances and the same seldom
coincide with each other on salient features.
Admittedly, it is an unfortunate incident in
which brother of the appellant/complainant
namely, Kamran Aziz lost his life after
sustaining firearm injury, but to put the facts
and circumstances in equilibrium with the
touchstone of safe administration of justice, we
have scrutinized the whole evidence available
on record while weighing the same on judicial
parlance. It has been observed by us that the
prosecution has led evidence in the shape of
ocular, medical evidence, as well as
investigation besides other attending

circumstances.

8. As far as merits of the case are
concerned, we have observed that the
prosecution examined the appellant/
complainant Zeeshan Aziz as PW-2. He
disclosed in his Court statement as well as in
the murasila/FIR that on the eventful day he

alongwith his deceased brother Kamran Aziz
-6-

had gone to their landed property for its
inspection. At 1100 hours, accused Hizbullah,
armed with .12 bore shotgun, Fazal armed with
30 bore pistol, Khalid Jan, armed with 30 bore
pistol, Ahmed Jan, armed with pistol, Attaullah,
armed with axe, an unknown accused son of
Attaullah and their tenants Attique son of Afzal,
Majeed son of Saeed & Makhan son of Ramzan,
armed with axe and clubs, came on the spot. The
accused Hizbullah started firing at them with his
.12 bore shotgun with intention to commit their
Qatl-e-Amd, as a result of it, he and his brother
sustained injuries, whereas, his brother
succumbed to his injuries and expired on the
spot. The other accused also attacked at him with
their respective weapons due to which he
received injuries on his head and on his
eyebrow. The motive for the occurrence is
dispute over landed property and the occurrence
was also witnessed his father Abdul Aziz.
However, in his examination-in-cross, he
pointed out that the accused Hizbullah had
made a single fire and the accused Hizbullah
and his deceased brother were face to face at

the time of firing, whereas, the postmortem
-7-

report of the deceased shows firearm injury on
lower back of chest on left side. He further
stated that as he was injured and was not in full
senses, therefore, he cannot say that when his
brother died after sustaining injuries. He also
stated that one Fazal-ur-Rahman and Khalid
Jan also sustained firearm injuries and
admitted that a cross FIR has also been
registered, wherein, he has been nominated as
an accused. He further stated that he was
injured through the blows of hatchets and no
one has fired at him, however, his medical
report shows the injury sustained by him as
blunt. The doctor (PW-1) admitted in his
examination-in-cross that the injuries sustained

by the injured are possible by falling on earth.

9. Father of the appellant/complainant
namely Abdul Aziz is also stated to be
eyewitness of the occurrence. He was examined
as PW-3. He disclosed in his cross-examination
that the accused Hizbullah and his son Kamran
were face to face at a distance of three single
paces. He was unable to tell the exact number of

fire shots made by the accused.
-8-

10. PW-2 stated that he did not know
who shifted him as well as deceased to the
hospital as he was semi unconscious and regain
his full senses after forty minutes of the
occurrence, whereas, PW-3 stated that his
injured son Zeeshan was in complete senses after
the occurrence. PW-3 stated that they shifted the
deceased and the injured to the hospital in a
private Datsun, however, due particulars of the
vehicle, as its registration number, the name of
driver etc, are neither part & parcel of the
investigation nor that of the trial. PW-3 further
stated that so many people gathered on the spot
and took the dead body of his son as well as
injured but he was unable to disclose their
names. He stated that as he had no watch at the
time of occurrence so he cannot tell the time

between injury and death of his son Kamran.

11. The I.0 (PW-10) admitted that one
independent witness Muhammad Ayub was
allegedly present on the spot and his statement
was recorded under Section 161 Cr.PC which
is Ex.PW-10/D-2. The name of said

Muhammad Ayub is neither mentioned in the
-9-

murasila/FIR nor he has been examined in the
case as prosecution witness. He could have
strengthened the case of the prosecution; but
his non production as prosecution witness has
adversely affected its case in view of the
provisions of Article 129, Illustration (g) of
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. It is now settled
law not to produce material witnesses, an
inference can be drawn that had they stepped
into the witness box, they would have not
supported the prosecution’s case. The Hon'ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of
“Muhammad Rafique and others v. State and
others” (2010 SCMR 385) held as under:-
"that if any party withholds the best
piece of evidence then it can fairly be
presumed that the party had some
sinister motive behind it. The
presumption under Article 129(g) of
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order can fairly be

drawn that if PW would have been
examined, his evidence would have

been unfavourable to the
prosecution”.
12. The appellant/complainant (PW-2)

and his father (PW-3) taken the stance that
they were empty handed, therefore, could do

nothing. However, during cross-examination

reference was made to statement under Section

-10-

161 Cr.PC, wherein, it is mentioned that the
accused taken away his licensed pistol and
produced the same to Investigating Officer.
The appellant/complainant improved his
statement and repeatedly mentioned that he
was semi conscious. There is no second opinion
at all rather it is a settled maxim that when a
witness improves his version to strengthen the
prosecution case, his improved statement
cannot be relied upon as the witness has
improved his statement dishonestly, therefore,
his credibility becomes doubtful on the well-
known principle of criminal jurisprudence that
improvements once found deliberate and
dishonest cast serious doubt on the veracity of
such a witnesses. Reference in this respect may
be made to the case of "Farman Ahmad v.
Muhammad Inayat and others" (2007 SCMR
1825) wherein it was held as under:-
".... It is also a settled maxim when
a witness improves his version to
strengthen the prosecution case, his
improved statement subsequently
made cannot be relied upon as the
witness had improved his statement
dishonestly, therefore, his credibility
becomes doubtful on the well-known
principle of criminal jurisprudence

that improvements once found
deliberate and dishonest cast serious
aa

-ll-

doubt on the veracity of such
witnesses."

13. No doubt, appellant/complainant
(PW-2) sustained injuries on his person during
the occurrence but this fact alone cannot be
considered sufficient to hold that he has spoken
the whole truth. In the case of “Said Ahmad Vs.
Zumured Hussain” (1981 SCMR 795), it was
observed:-
"Fact of eye-witness being injured
and injuries being not self suffered---
not by itself indicative of witness
having told truth--witness closely
related to deceased while other
persons mentioned in F.ILR. not
examined---Acquittal, was rightly not
interfered with by the High Court."
Similarly, in the case of “Ghulam Sarwar
Vs. The State” (PLD 1993 Pesh. 152), it was
held that witness bearing injuries on his person,
by itself, does not indicate that he has stated
truth. Having assessed the eye-witness account
furnished by complainant Muhammad Akbar
and Mst. Parveen P.Ws., we find that the claim
of these witnesses having seen the occurrence,
stands belied by host of circumstances and
cannot be accepted in absence of corroborative

evidence. It appears that the occurrence has not

taken place in the manner as suggested by the
ae

-12-

prosecution and a wide net has been thrown by
the prosecution to implicate all the male

members of the respondents family.

14. The medical evidence can no way
pin point the accused nor can establish the
identity of the accused. It is hard fact that
medical evidence can never be considered to be
a corroborative piece of evidence and at the most
can be considered a supporting evidence only to
the extent of specification of seat of injuries, the
weapon of offence, duration, the cause of death
etc. “Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State” (2018
SCMR 772), “Tariq Hussain and another Vs.

The State and 04 others” (2018 MILD 1573

[Federal Shariat Court]).

15. The motive alleged by the
prosecution was dispute over landed property.
The burden to prove the motive part of the
occurrence was upon the prosecution but
record of the case would reveal that the same
has not been proved. So mere alleging a motive
would not be sufficient to accept and rely upon

the same.
-13-

16. The peculiar facts and
circumstances are sufficient enough that strong
presumption can be ruled out that the
occurrence has not taken place in the mode and
manner so reported and presented by the
prosecution and the prosecution failed to prove

its case beyond shadow of any doubt.

17. It is well settled, benefit of doubt is
not a grace but right of the accused and it is not
necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating doubts, even a single
circumstance, creating reasonable doubt in a
prudent mind about the guilt of accused, makes

him entitled to its benefit, not as a matter of

‘grace & concession but as a matter of right.

Reference is made to the case "Muhammad

Akram v. State" (2009 SCMR 230).

18. Beside the above, generally the
order of acquittal cannot be interfered with
because the presumption of innocence of the
accused is further strengthened by acquittal. The
golden thread which runs through the web of
administration of justice in criminal cases is that

if two views are possible on the evidence
-14-

adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of
the accused and the other to his innocence, the
view which is favourable to the accused should
be adopted. The paramount consideration of the
Court is to ensure that miscarriage of justice is
prevented. A miscarriage of justice which may
arise from acquittal of the guilty is less than the
conviction of an innocent. In a case where
admissible evidence is ignored, a duty is cast
upon the appellate Court to re-appreciate the
evidence in a case where the accused has been
acquitted, or the purpose of ascertaining as to
whether the accused committed the offence or
not. The principle to be followed by this Court
considering the appeal against the judgment of
acquittal is, to interfere only when there are
compelling and substantial reasons for doing so.
If the impugned judgment is clearly
unreasonable, only then it is a compelling reason

for interference.

19. For the afore-stated reasons, learned
counsel representing the appellant/complainant

could not point out any illegality and material
-15-

irregularity in the impugned judgment so that the

Court could incline to interfere in it.

20. Resultantly, this appeal having no

merit and substance stands dismissed.
