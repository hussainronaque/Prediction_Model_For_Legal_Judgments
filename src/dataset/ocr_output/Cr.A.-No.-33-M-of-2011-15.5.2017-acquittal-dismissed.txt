7. Learned counsel for the
complainant/Appellant relied on 2015 SCMR_ 710

“Saeed Ahmed vs the State”, 1991 P Cr. LJ 113

prayed for utter acceptance of the appeal as the

accused/Respondents have murdered the deceased

Mst. Fatima in pre-planned manner and then giving

Nawab

-7-

from the clutches of law. On the other hand, learned

counsel for the accused/Respondents vehemently

opposed the submissions/arguments advanced by

learned counsel for the complainant/Appellant by

contending that the learned Trial Court has rendered

a detailed well-reasoned judgment by reaching to an

irresistible conclusion that the version of prosecution

has not been proved in view of the medical evidence,

thus prayed for dismissal of the present appeal being

meritless.

8. We have given conscious thoughts to each

and every argument heard by us, while appreciating

determined points for acquittal of the

accused/Respondents. We are able to recognize that

on the one hand complainant of this case being father

by the name of Qasim Khan has charged both

accused/brothers Kabir Khan husband of the

deceased and Ghafoor Khan brother of said Kabir

Khan. The latter is said to have hatched the

conspiracy and on his instance/behest the deceased
Nawab

-8-

Mst. Fatima has been killed by firing at her by Kabir

Khan. When the statement of Qasim Khan recorded

as PW-6 is to be given weight on the basis of few

lines in his examination-in-chief, he stated that his

daughter Mst. Fatima was married to Kabir Khan.

Witness Ajab Sultana is his wife while PW Rozi

Khan is his brother. On the day of occurrence he was

present in his house when received information that

Mst. Fatima was killed by Kabir Khan. He rushed to

the hospital and found his daughter dead. Motive

behind the occurrence is land dispute as the said

Kabir Khan accused/Respondent time and again

asking his wife Mst. Fatima to seek her share in the

property owned by his father, so he has made the

ibid report in shape of First Information Report on

the strength of Murasila. In this whole statement he

has referred Mst. Ajab Sultana his wife and Rozi

Khan PW as his brother, but he has never disclosed

that who informed him by communicating the death

of Mst. Fatima. In this statement, in the cross-
Nawab

-9.

examination although this witness PW-6 Qasim

Khan stated that it was Rozi Khan who had informed

him about the demise of his daughter Mst. Fatima

and the time was 9.30 A.M. There is no disclosure as

to in-fact while receiving the call his wife Mst. Ajab

Sultana was present at the scene of occurrence

alongwith brother of the complainant Rozi Khan.

The accused/Respondent Kabir Khan is very close to

the complainant Qasim Khan but even being

aggrieved with him has charged him for the murder

of his daughter Mst. Fatima. The relationship is to

the extent that Kabir Khan’s two real sisters are

married to his sons. When we go through the

statement of Mst. Ajab Sultana appeared as PW-7,

we have noticed she has been introduced just to link

in chain the occurrence happened in the mode and

manner as besides Mst. Ajab Sultana no other

witness has come forward to have seen the

occurrence with naked eyes. In her examination-in-

chief she has stated about the occurrence that she
Nawab

-10-

alongwith brother-in-law Rozi Khan had gone to the

house of Kabir Khan to patch up the dispute in

between husband and wife and during the course of

compromise proceedings Mst. Fatima went inside

Godown and Kabir Khan went after her being

infuriated holding a pistol and fired at her. The site

plan Ex. PW-8/2 would not reveal any point where

the compromise proceedings were taken place and

Mst. Ajab Sultana has not disclosed that right at the

point when the deceased Mst. Fatima was killed she

was present in this Godown. If PW-7 Mst.Ajab

Sultana was present in the house there is a way

passing to Godown from the sitting place “Baitak”

where she could not witness firing upon the deceased

Mst. Fatima by her husband Kabir Khan

accused/Respondent.

9. There is no disclosure of the fact by Mst.

Ajab Sultana as to how Ghafoor Khan co-

accused/Respondent has instigated his brother Kabir

Khan to kill his own wife. This statement is also
Nawab

-ll-

silent to this effect. Another important witness could

be the statement of Rozi Khan, but for reasons best

known to the prosecution he has been abandoned.

There is however joint statement of Salah-ud-Din

SPP and Mr. Raziq Jan, Advocate appearing on

behalf of the complainant that if the statement of PW

Rozi Khan could be recorded it would be the

verbatim statement like PW Mst. Ajab Sultana,

therefore he was abandoned. Thus, it can be said

with certainty that the prosecution withheld its best

piece of evidence. Even otherwise, it is settled

principle of law that if a best piece of evidence is

available with the party and the said party fails to

produce the same before the Court then a

presumption under Article 129 (g) of Qanun-e-

Shahadat Order, 1984 can be drawn that had the said

piece of evidence been produced before the Court it

would have been unfavourable to the said party.

Such presumption can fairly be drawn in the present

case had PW Rozi Khan produced in the Court he
Nawab

-12-

would have not supported the prosecution case. Non-

examination of this material witness has materially

affected the prosecution case. Reliance is placed on

Darwesh & others Vs The State (2014 YLR 2233).

10. Whether this case falls to be suicidal

attempt as Mst. Fatima has killed herself or she has

been killed by someone else. The evidence of

prosecution to this effect is not convincing to bring

home the charges. Medical examination was

conducted by Lady Doctor Fauzia Qadeem, she was

examined as PW-4. She disclosed an entry wounds

on the left temporal occipital region of the skull

irregular inverted margins, charring marks measuring

approximately, exist wound on the right parietal

region of the skull about the right ear having

irregular averted margins measuring 7.5 x 7.5 cm wit

brain matter seen protruding the wound and noted

the kind of weapon fire arm. The medical report

suggests that Mst. Fatima was fired upon from very

close range i.e. 2/3 inches. If at all the
Nawab

-13-

accused/Respondent Kabir Khan fired upon the

deceased from a very close range then there may be

some resistance on behalf of the deceased Mst.

Fatima as no one has witnessed the firing upon her

and even the statement of Mst. Ajab Sultana is also

silent to this effect. As it has rightly been held by

the learned Trial Court that human is not a statute or

when she was to be fired upon she could at least

show some resistance at that time and there must be

further chance of miss fire shots. If at all there was

presence of Dupatta on the head of the deceased then

the attempt to commit suicide was in-fact made in

the relaxed manner.

11. In view of the Modi Medical

Jurisprudence and Toxicology favorite sites of

suicidal fire-arm are:- A suicidal firearm wound is

usually a contact wound situated on the side of the

temple, depending on which hand was used to shoot

himself, in the center of the forehead, the roof of the

mouth, in the chest or epigatrium in front or left side
Nawab

-14-

and sometimes under the chin. The firearm is usually

fired at close range. A small weapon like a revolver

or a pistol is held in the hand, while a rifle or a shot

gun is supported on the ground or against the wall.

Sometimes, the firing is done by pulling a string tied

to the trigger by the big toe. The skin around the

entry wound shows characteristics blackening.

12. If the arguments of the learned

counsel for the complainant/Appellant are taken

meaningful that Mst. Fatima deceased had received

bullet marks on left temporal occipital region then it

is not possible for a woman to commit suicide by

holding a pistol and fired upon one herself with left

hand. He further added that in all probabilities it is a

pre-planned murder. Then in such scenario keeping

the above analogy in mind, whether any question has

been put to any of the witnesses or for that matter to

the Medical Officer for the reason that the deceased

was left handed, but there is no evidence to this

effect available on the file, rather statement of the
Nawab

-15-

so called eyewitness Mst. Ajab Sultana being

step-mother of the deceased is completely silent

in this regard coupled with the fact that medical

evidence is also not in conformity with the

version advanced by the prosecution.

13. We have given deep thoughts to all

aspects of this case including arguments of

learned counsel for the complainant/Appellant,

medical evidence and oral evidence of the

deceased father Qasim Khan appeared as PW-6

and Mst. Ajab Sultana PW-7. In all probabilities

it hardly bring the case within the ambit of

conviction for which appeal would liable to be

accepted, rather the evidence of the prosecution

suggest that the learned Trial Court after proper

appreciation and appraisal of the record rendered

the impugned judgment of acquittal, to which no

exception could be made out.
Nawab

-16-

14. Even otherwise, it is the duty of the
prosecution to prove its case beyond any shadow
of doubt and now it has been settled by the Hon'ble
apex Court that a single circumstance creating
reasonable doubt is sufficient for acquittal of the
accused and if any single and slightest doubt is
created, its benefit must go to the accused, so, the
trial court has rightly extended the benefit of doubt
to the accused on valid and cogent reasons based
on proper appreciation of evidence and the
acquittal of respondent does not call for any
interference by this Court. Moreover, criterion of
appraisal of evidence in an appeal against acquittal
is quite different than an appeal against conviction,
because in case of acquittal double presumption of
innocence lies in favour of the accused. Even if
another view is possible, the view favourable to the
accused is to be preferred. Reliance in this regard
can be placed on the case of Muhammad Iqbal
vs. Abid Hussain alias Mithu and 6 others, 1994
SCMR 1928. Learned counsel for the complainant

Appellant failed to point-out any misreading or
-17-
non-reading of the evidence on record and on the
contrary the evidence was appreciated and assessed
on the settled principles of law by the learned Trial

Court.

15. In view of the above, this appeal
being short of merits stand dismissed.
