ABDUL SHAKOOR, J.-_ The petitioner seeks cancellation of

pre-arrest bail granting order dated 12.04.2017, passed by

learned Additional Sessions Judge-II], Bannu, whereby ad-

interim pr-arrest bail of accused/ respondent Kousar Hayat,

involved in case F.I.R No. 192 dated 10.03.2017 under section

408 P.P.C, registered at Police Station Cantt, Bannu, has been

confirmed.
-2-

2. Brief facts of the case are that complainant Dr.

Attaur Rehman submitted a written application to the D.I.G

Bannu, against the accused/ respondent that he was serving as

Manager of his Patrol Pump and six months ago he criminally

misappropriated the cash amount of patrol pump and left the

job, while carrying the record with himself. Before arrest

accused/ respondent moved ad-interim  pre-arrest _ bail

application, before the court of learned Additional Sessions

Judge-II, Bannu, which was allowed and _ subsequently

confirmed vide impugned /order dated 12.04.2017. Petitioner

being aggrieved from the order dated 12.04.2017 filed the

instant bail cancellation petition.

3. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of petitioner

vehemently argued that learned Additional Sessions Judge was

having no justification to confirm ad-interim bail of the

respondent/ accused, since he did not bring on the record any

element of malafide or harassment on the part of petitioner for

lodging the case F.I.R and in absence of malafide or harassment

there was no valid reason or justification before the learned

Additional Sessions Judge to confirm ad-interim bail. During
-3-

the course of arguments learned counsel for petitioner drew

attention of this court to F.I.R No. 180 lodged by accused/

respondent against the present petitioner under section 324/427

P.P.C Police Station Karak, in which one Ism Gul son of

Gulzada who was cited as witness to the alleged occurrence

during the investigation has recorded his statement under

section 164 Cr.PC, before the learned Judicial Magistrate,

Takht-e-Nasrati, Karak, wherein he termed the contents of said

F.LR as false. He contended the launching of said F.ILR

amounts to a threat to petitioner/ complainant for withdrawing

of his case F.I.R. The same is sheer misuse of the concession of

bail extended in his favour by the learned Additional Sessions

Judge, Karak.

4. Conversely, the learned counsel appearing for

respondent argued that although respondent was named in the

F.LR, but there is delay of more than six months in lodging the

same, which by itself speaks the malafide of the petitioner, thus

learned Additional Sessions Judge rightly confirmed the ad-

interim bail. He further argued that F.I.R which has been

referred to by the learned counsel for the petitioner cannot be
-4-

termed as threat to the petitioner for withdrawing his case.

More so, when alleged eyewitness of the F.I.R has termed the

contents of said F.I.R in his statement recorded under section

164 Cr.PC, as false, then the very claim of present petitioner

that it was misuse of the concession of bail does not carry any

weight to be taken into consideration.

5. I have considered the submissions of learned

counsel for the parties and also carefully gone through the

record available on file.

6. Perusal of the material available on the record

reveals that considerable delay of six months has made in

reporting the matter to the police of alleged occurrence for

which no plausible explanation has been furnished by the

complainant. Admittedly the accused/ respondent was a

manager at the Petrol Pump of the complainant then the

possibility of malafide in lodging the instant F.I.R cannot be

ruled out on the part of complainant as he had left his

employment. Further except statement of complainant nothing

is available on record which may prima facie connect the

accused/ respondent with the commission of offence alleged to
-5-

be committed, which does not fall within the prohibitory clause

of section 497 Cr.PC.

7. It is settled principle of law that once discretion

has been exercised by the court of competent jurisdiction for

grant of bail or confirmation of ad-interim bail, then the same

cannot be reversed or recalled until or unless the same is either

perverse or illegal. For cancellation of bail, strong and cogent

reasons are required to be furnished, which are lacking in the

instant case.

8. In cases, where ad-interim bail is confirmed then

the ground which are essential for cancellation of bail are as:

(i) Exceptionally strong grounds such as abuse/ misuse

of concession of bail exist;

(ii) A Court cannot cancel the bail even when the offence
is punishable with death or imprisonment for life, and
even if grant of bail is prohibited under section 497(10
Cr.PC the discretion left in the Court under section
497 (5) Cr.PC.

(iii) Grounds for cancellation of bail are pari material with
the principles which apply to setting aside the orders
of acquittal.

(iv) Bail can be recalled where the person on bail repeats
the offence;

(v) Hampers the investigation;

(vi) Makes some efforts to tamper with the evidence;

(vii) Commits some act of violence against the police;’
-6-

(viii) Prosecutes the witnesses;

(ix) Manages to flee away from the country or beyond the
control of sureties;

(x) Order of bail has been obtained through

misrepresentation or suppression of facts.

9. In light of above points, now it is well settled

proposition of law that grounds and principle for grant of bail

are totally different from the ground and principle for

cancellation of bail already granted to an accused. The only

point which required to be considered in the instant cancellation

petition is whether accused/ complainant has misused the

concession of bail or his remaining at large would be a serious

threat to the evidence brought on record against him. This

means very strong and exceptional grounds are to be required

for cancellation of bail. If we see the case of complainant in this

perspective, I do not find any material before, which may

warrant justification for the interference in the discretion

exercised by the lower Court. The only point which urged for

cancellation of bail is misuse of concession of same in terms of

lodging of afore said F.I.R against the present petitioner. The

same has already been termed as false by the eye witness cited
-7-

therein, thus, the same act on the part of accused/ respondent by

no way can be termed as misuse of concession of bail.

10. This Court has already observed, although the

petitioner was named as accused in F.I.R, but the delay of more

then six months in lodging the report has not been explained

and no valid reason has been advanced, which may appeal to

prudent mind that there was any justification for such long

delay in lodging the report.

11. The principle laid down by the three members

bench of the apex Court in the Sarwar Sultan’s case (PLD 1994

SC 133) is on all four of the case of respondent, relevant

portion of the same is reproduced herein.

"9. From legal angle, it can be said that there
is material difference between bail after
arrest as contemplated under section 497,
Cr.P.C. and bail before arrest under section
498, Cr.P.C. In non-bailable offence, an
accused is not to be released on bail by the
Court, if there appear reasonable grounds for
believing that he has been guilty of offence
punishable with death or imprisonment for
life or ten years. Of course it is also provided
that bail can be granted on exceptional
grounds of age, infirmity and sex and also if

there are sufficient grounds for further
-8-

inquiry and also on the ground of statutory
delay. As against that under section 498,
Cr.P.C. High Court or Court of Session can
grant bail at any stage and this provision is
normally used for bail before arrest. In this
provision amendment has been made and by
Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment)
Act XII of 1976 section 498-A is inserted
imposing restriction on grant of bail before
arrest to a person, who does not surrender
before the Court or against whom no case is
registered. Grant of pre-arrest bail means
that accused is exempted from joining the
investigation and by not joining the
investigation, prosecution case may suffer for
want of recovery of incriminating articles and
other material, which may be necessary to
connect him with commission of alleged
crime. The Court has to keep in view all these
factors in order to maintain balance between
both parties and would be cautious not to give
undue advantage to one party over the other
at the stage of investigation. Of course there
is no cavil about the proposition that the
Court has power to grant bail before arrest in
an appropriate case, if the Court is satisfied
that is a fit case for grant of such relief within

the limits of law also it stated above".

12. Apex Court in the case of Rana Muhammad vy.

Muhammad Rafique, (PLD 2009 SC 427) which is a Judgment
-9-
by two members' Bench summarized law in regard to ad-

interim bail as under:--

(a) Grant of bail before arrest is an
extraordinary relief to be granted only in
extraordinary situations to protect innocent
persons against victimization through abuse

of law for ulterior motives;

(b)  Pre-arrest bail is not to be used as a
substitute or as an alternative for post-arrest

bail;

(c) bail before arrest cannot be granted
unless the person seeking it satisfies the
conditions specified through subsection (2) of
section 497 of Code of Criminal Procedure
i.e, unless he establishes the existence of
reasonable grounds leading to a belief that he
was not guilty of the offence alleged against
him and that there were, in fact, sufficient
grounds warranting further inquiry into his

guilt;

(d) not just this but in addition thereto, he
must also show that his arrest was being
sought for ulterior motive, particularly on the
part of the police; to cause irreparable
humiliation to him and to B disagree and

dishonour him;

(e) such a_ petitioner should further
-10-

establish that he had not done or suffered any
act which would disentitle him to a
discretionary relief in equity e.g. he had no
past criminal record or that he had not been a

fugitive at law, and finally that;

() in the absence of a reasonable and a
justifiable cause, a person desiring his
admission to bail before arrest, must, in the
first instance approach the Court of first
instant i.e. the Court of Session, before

petitioning the High Court for the purpose.”

14. The above case-law indicates that considerations

for grant of pre-arrest bail are not at all different, as far as

merits of the case are concerned, from the considerations for

grant of post arrest bail. The only difference, which has been

highlighted in certain Judgments, is that there must be

additional basis of humiliation, harassment, mala fides,

intention to disgrace and dishonour. This particular view has to

be read in juxtaposition with view that if a person is otherwise

entitled to bail, no useful purpose shall be served by putting

such person firstly behind bars and then allowing him bail. In

Sarwar Sultan's case (supra) it has been held that the Court has

to keep a balance but it has been then observed that if a fit case
-1ll-
for grant of bail is made out, bail before arrest should be

allowed in appropriate cases.

15. For what has been discussed above, this bail
cancellation petition being devoid of any merits, stands
dismissed.

Announced.
