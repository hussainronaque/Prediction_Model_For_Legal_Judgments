2. The appellant faced trial in the criminal
case registered against him vide FIR No. 662 dated
21.12.2018 under sections 302/324/34 PPC at Police
Station Timergara District Dir Lower. As per
prosecution story, the complainant namely
Muhammad Ismail (PW-2) reported the matter to
local police at emergency ward of Timergara
hospital to the effect that on the fateful day he along
with his deceased father namely Rozi Khan, sister
namely Mst. Rifat Bibi, uncle namely Munir Khan
(the abandoned PW) and his other sister namely
Hameeda Bibi (PW-3) were present in the
thoroughfare outside their house, when in the
meanwhile, the accused namely Sher Khan
(absconding accused) and Syed (the appellant herein
namely Syed Bahadar) while being duly armed with
pistols came there and due to the firing of the
absconding co-accused namely Sher Khan his father
namely Rozi Khan got hit on different parts of his
body and died on the spot, whereas from a fire shot
of the present appellant his sister namely Mst. Rifat
Bibi got injured, whereas rest of the complainant-

party escaped un-hurt. Motive behind the occurrence

(0.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad tjaz Khan
was stated to be a previous blood feud enmity
between the parties.

3. Upon arrest of the appellant, challan
was submitted against him before the learned trial
court, whereas the proceedings under section 512
Cr.P.C were initiated against the absconding co-
accused namely Sher Khan. The charge was also
framed against the appellant, to which he pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial. In the earlier trial, the
appellant was convicted and sentenced to life
imprisonment along with compensation of
Rs. 500,0000/- payable to the legal heirs of the
deceased by the Court of learned Sessions Judge/Zila
Qazi Dir Lower vide judgment dated 20.02.2020.
Feeling aggrieved from the aforesaid judgment of
conviction, the appellant had preferred criminal
appeal No. 84-M of 2020 before this Court, which
was allowed vide judgment dated 14.01.2021 and the
case was remanded back to the learned trial Court
for framing of an amended charge.

4, After remand, the charge was framed
against the appellant on 17.02.2021, to which he

again pleaded as not guilty and claimed trial. The

(D.B.} Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
parties were afforded an opportunity to produce their
respective evidence, however, the prosecution relied
on their already recorded evidence and in this respect
a joint statement of the learned public prosecutor as
well as defence counsel was recorded. The statement
of the appellant was recorded under section 342
Cr.P.C and thereafter he also produced one Javid
Iqbal as DW-1. On conclusion of proceedings in
trial, the accused/appellant was convicted and
sentenced by the Court of learned Sessions Judge Dir
Lower vide the impugned order/judgment dated
10.02.2022, as stated hereinabove. The appellant has
now challenged the aforesaid order/judgment by
filing the instant appeal before this Court.

5. Arguments of learned counsel for the
parties as well as learned Astt: A.G. appearing on
behalf of the State were heard in considerable detail
and the record perused with their able assistance.

6. It is the case of prosecution as lodged
by the complainant namely Muhammad Ismail, son
of the deceased as well as brother of the second
deceased to the effect that his father namely Rozi

Khan after performance of Juma prayers was present

(0.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
in front of his house along with other inmates of the
house including the injured Mst. Rifat Bibi, his uncle
Munir Khan and his other sister namely Mst.
Hameeda Bibi, when in the meanwhile, the
absconding accused namely Sher Khan and the
appellant namely Syed duly equipped with their
respective pistols came there and the absconding
accused namely Sher Khan made a fire shot with his
pistol at his father due to which he sustained injury
on his right hand and chest and as such died on the -
spot, whereas from the fire shot of the appellant his
sister namely Mst. Rifat Bibi received injury on her
umbilicus and as such she too was seriously injured,
whereas from their firing rest of the complainant-
party escaped unhurt. The occurrence was stated to
be witnessed by Munir Khan and his sister namely
Mst. Hameeda Bibi and the motive was stated to be a
previous blood feud enmity between the parties.

7. In this case the prosecution has mainly
relied upon the ocular account furnished by PW-2
namely Muhammad Ismail and PW-3 namely
Hameeda Bibi who are respectively the son and

daughter of one of the deceased and brother and

(0.B.) Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad az Khan

sister of another deceased, however, on the available
record the prosecution has not been able to prove
their presence on the spot, which is a pre-condition
before relying or discarding their evidence which is
to be highlighted as under;-

(i) As far as the presence of PW-2 namely
Muhammad Ismail on the spot and at the relevant
time is concerned, it may be noted that he has
himself admitted in his cross-examination that when
his father and sister got injured he did not try to
attend or console them or to do any other efforts to
save their lives, rather he stated that after the
occurrence the local people attracted to the spot and
they shifted the deceased and the injured to the
hospital. This conduct of PW-2 namely Muhammad
Ismail who is the real son of one of the deceased and
brother of another, is highly unnatural and
improbable. Had he been present on the spot he
would have out of psychological compulsion
attended his loving father and caring sister and in the
process of providing First aid to them he should have
been on the front foot and as such while dealing with

such seriously injured persons his hands and clothes

(0.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
ought to have been smeared with blood, however,
neither he has claimed any such exercise nor the
same is spelling-out from the record, therefore, his
presence on the spot do not fit in the matrix of this
case.

(ii) Another aspect of this case which
makes the presence of PW-2 on the spot as doubtful
is that had he been present on the scene of
occurrence and truly accompanying the deceased and
the injured to the hospital then his name should have
been reflected in the preliminary documents
prepared by the local police as well as by the doctor
in the form of injury sheets, inquest report and
medical report/post-mortem report, however, his
name is nowhere find mentioned, rather it is his
uncle namely Munir Khan whose name is reflected
everywhere, therefore, in the post occurrence events,
the presence of PW-2 is prima facie not established,
which obviously means that he has reached to the
hospital after completion of preliminary
investigations and just before the lodging of the

report.

(D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
ry

(iii) Another aspect which would reflect that
PW-2 was not present on the spot is that the doctor
namely Muhammad Saleem (PW-8) who conducted
the postmortem of his father has stated in the
opening sentence of his examination-in-chief that he
examined the deceased at 02:20 p.m and who has
admitted in his cross-examination that at the time of
conducting the postmortem report the police handed
him over the injury sheet and inquest report and who
has also admitted that before him the dead body was
identified by Munir Khan who is uncle of the PW-2,
whereas the time of lodging of report in the
‘Murasila’ is shown as 14:30 hours (02:30 p.m.)
which obviously means that at the time of arrival of
the deceased and injured to the hospital and at the
time of preparation of injury sheet, inquest report
and conducting of post-mortem report PW-2 was not
present and in-fact it was Munir Khan who was
present with the deceased and injured, therefore, this
fact too shows that PW-2 was not present at the
relevant time and in-fact the local police have waited
till 02:30 (time of lodging the report) for the arrival

of PW-2 so as to plant him as a complainant of this

{D.B.} Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
case, when by then even the injury sheet, the inquest
report, and the postmortem were already prepared/
conducted by the doctor at 02:20 p.m.

8. As far as the presence of PW-3 namely
Mst. Hameeda Bibi is concerned, the same too has
not been established on record. It is a matter of
record that the time of occurrence is peak hours of
the day and it happened to be Friday and especially
when by then people of the locality have just got free
from Namaz-e-jumma and as such at the relevant
time there ought to be hustle and bustle of the people
of the locality by leaving the Mosque and to go to
their houses and other destinations but despite that
PW-3 namely Mst. Hameeda Bibi who is a grown up
girl of 15 years of age and who has admitted in the
opening line of her cross-examination that for the
last 4/5 years she is observing Parda but even then
she was shown present in a public thoroughfare
without caring of her Parda and that too at the peak
hours of the day, therefore, the presence of PW-3 at
the relevant time and place appears to be highly
unreasonable and unnatural and thus the prosecution

has not been able to prove the presence of both these

{0.B.} Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-10-

PWs on the scene of occurrence and at the relevant
time and thus their evidence could not be relied upon
for the purpose of conviction. In the case of Liagat

Ali and another v/s The State and others reported as

2021 SCMR 780, the Hon’ble Apex Court has held
that all the circumstances highlighted above lead us
to a definite conclusion that presence of eye-
witnesses at the place of occurrence at the relevant
time is not free from doubts and the prosecution has
failed to prove its case against the appellant beyond
reasonable doubt. Similarly, in the case of Khalid

Mehmood and_another v/s The State and others

reported as 2021 SCMR 810, the Hon’ble Apex
Court has observed the same view that all the
circumstances highlighted above lead us to a definite
conclusion that presence of eye-witnesses at the
place of occurrence at the relevant time is not above
board and prosecution has failed to prove its case
against the petitioner beyond reasonable doubt.

9. The statement of PW-3 namely Mst.
Hameeda Bibi qua the specific charge by name and
role assigned to the present appellant for causing

injury to her sister is prima facie the result of

(0.8.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad IJaz Khan
-ll-

tutoring her as this PW-3 is a female of tender age of
15/16 years of age and she is residing in village Koz
Kalay Timergara whereas the appellant is resident
of another village namely Tora Tega and when both
the parties are admittedly not relatives and when
they have past history of enmity spreading over
several years and when PW-3 in her cross-
examination has admitted that she has never been to
Tora Tega (the village of the appellant) then how she
could have an opportunity to see, know and identify
their enemies including the appellant, therefore, her
statement to this extent too could not qualify the test
of prudence and reasonableness and thus it would be
too risky to rely on the evidence of such an
eyewitness for the purpose of conviction or to
maintain an order of conviction.

10. Another damaging aspect for the
prosecution case is that as transpires from the
contents of the FIR and as stated by the complainant
in his Court statement that his uncle namely Munir
Khan is one of the eyewitness of the occurrence and
it was the same Munir Khan whose name find

mentioned in all the relevant record at the time of

(D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Maz Khan
-12-

initial investigation as it was he who seconded the
contents of the report and it was he who identified
the dead body before the police and it was he who
was accompanying the deceased at the time of
conducting the postmortem and who identified the
dead body before the doctor at the time of
preparation of postmortem report Ex.PW-8/4, but
astonishingly, he was not produced by the
prosecution and was abandoned being unnecessary,
therefore, he being an important witness of the
prosecution especially when there was past history
of enmity between the parties and as against the two
eyewitnesses who are of tender age of 15/16 years,
PW Munir Khan being one of the elder of the family
would have been in a better position to clearly
identify with perfection their enemies, but he was
abandoned and the prosecution took the risk to
establish their case on the evidence of young
eyewitnesses who ought to have a rear opportunity to
see their enemies in decades long enmity and as
such the prosecution has withheld the best available
evidence, therefore, under Article 129 (g) of The

Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 an adverse inference

{0.8.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
a2

-13-

has to be drawn that had Munir Khan been produced
he would have not supported the case of prosecution.
In a similar situation akin to the present one, the
Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of “Lal Khan ws
State” reported as 2006 SCMR_1846 has held a
material witness of occurrence would create an
impression that had such witness been brought into
witness-box, he might not have supported the
prosecution and in such eventuality the prosecution
must not be in a position to avoid consequence.

Similarly, in the case of “Mandoos Khan v4 The

State” reported as 2003 SCMR 884 it was observed
by the Apex Court that prosecution must produce
best kind of evidence to establish accusation against
accused facing trial but simultaneously it has no
obligation to produce a good number of witnesses
because it has an option to produce as many as
witnesses which in its consideration are sufficient to
bring home guilt against the accused, following the
principle of law that to establish accusation, indeed it
is not the quantity but quality of the evidence, which

gets preference.

(0.8.) Hon'bte Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-14-

11. In this case the medical evidence of one
of the deceased then injured has furnished by PW-13
namely Dr. Saima who has categorically stated in
her cross-examination that at the time of examining
Mst. Rifat Bibi (who died after 76 days of the
occurrence) she was fully conscious, therefore, she
was the most natural witness being an injured
witness of the occurrence to lodge the instant report,
however, the prosecution instead of lodging the
report through her has opted to introduce PW-2 for
the same. It is also a matter of record that after 08
days of the occurrence her statement was recorded
under section 161 Cr.P.C, however, her this
statement has also not been exhibited by the
prosecution in the evidence and as such the
prosecution has tried its level best to play their cards
as per their own understanding which cast a doubt on
the authenticity and veracity of the prosecution story
and statements of PWs.

12. The record and evidence produced by
the prosecution would also show that the prosecution
has conducted preliminary investigation before the

registration of the FIR. It is part of the evidence and

{0.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
as stated by PW-8 namely Dr. Muhammad Saleem
that on the relevant day he examined the dead body
of the deceased at 02:20 p.m. He has also admitted
that before conducting the postmortem of the dead
body of the deceased the local police handed him
over the inquest report and the injury sheets which
means that the local police have already prepared
these documents, however, the time of lodging
report as transpires in the ‘Murasila’ Ex. PA is 14:30
hours i.e. 02:30 p.m, which obviously and definitely
speaks of dual eventualities firstly that there was
preliminary investigation before the registration of
this case and secondly that by then PW-2 namely
Muhammad Ismail was not present; and as such the
local police was waiting for his arrival so as to plant
and show him as a complainant of the instant case
and thus it is a classical case of preliminary
investigation before the registration of the case . In a
situation akin to the present one in the case of
Sher_Ali_v/s_The State through A.G Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa reported as 2018 YLR 1836 this Court
has held that record showed that report was lodged

in the hospital at 03.00 p.m, whereas time of

(0.8.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-16-

occurrence was mentioned as 01.55 p.m but the
postmortem report showed examination of the dead
body on the same day at 02.20 p.m, which was forty
minutes earlier than the time of report to the police
in the hospital. Said facts showed that postmortem
examination of the deceased was conducted prior to
lodging the report to the police by the complainant
and thus had shaken the very foundation of the FIR
and as such the appellant therein was acquitted of the
charge by extending him the benefit of doubt.

13. It is also an astonishing aspect of the
case that PW-2 namely Muhammad Ismail the
complainant has stated in his statement that after the
occurrence local people attracted to the spot and that
the dead body and the injured were shifted by the
locals of the area to the hospital and out of whom he
remembered the names of Amir Rehman, Ubaid and
Owais, however, none amongst them has been
produced as a witness by the prosecution to support
this stance of the complainant, therefore, on this
score too, the prosecution has not been able to

establish the very inception of its case.

(0.B.) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad jaz Khan
14, The record further shows that despite
the fact that the two persons received serious injuries
on their bodies which were later on found fatal for
them, and as per statements of PW-2 and PW-3 the
deceased/ injured were laying on the spot for 2/3
minutes but unbelievably during spot inspection by
the Investigating Officer no blood was recovered
from the spot and as such the very place of
occurrence too is doubtful.

15, It is also a matter of record that the
complainant namely Muhammad Ismail, while
lodging report has specifically stated that the motive
for the occurrence was the previous blood feud
enmity, however, when he appeared as PW-2 in the
Court he has shown his ignorance regarding the
existence of a previous blood feud enmity between
the parties by stating that he could not say about
previous enmity as by then he was a child, therefore,
the alleged motive as advanced by the complainant
in the FIR has not been proved by the prosecution. It
is true that prosecution is not bound to set a motive
as it may be in the exclusive knowledge of the

accused and deceased, however, when once a motive

(D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-18-

is set up by the prosecution then they are bound to
prove the same and as such its failure would
seriously damage their stance/case.

16. In view of the above discussion, the
prosecution has not been able to prove the presence
of alleged eyewitnesses on the spot and at the
relevant time, it has also withheld the best available
evidence, it has also took the risk to rely on the
evidence of PWs whose evidence could not qualify
the test of reasonableness and thus such lacunas and
flaws have created doubts in the prosecution case
and as such the appellant is entitled for its benefits.
17. It is settled since long that for giving
benefit to an accused, it is not essential that there
should be many grounds for the same, even a single
doubt is sufficient to extend its benefit to an accused
person as it is the cardinal principle of criminal
administration of justice that let hundred guilty
persons be acquitted but one innocent person should

not be convicted. In the case of “Bashir Muhammd

Khan v/s The State” reported as 2022 SCMR_986,

the Hon’ble Apex Court has held that single

circumstance creating reasonable doubt in a prudent

{D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-19-

mind about the guilt of accused makes him entitled
to its benefits, not as a matter of grace and
concession but as a matter of right. The conviction
must be based on unimpeachable; trustworthy and
reliable evidence. Any doubt arising in prosecution's
case is to be resolved in favour of the accused and
burden of proof is always on prosecution to prove its
case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. Similarly,

in the case of “Khalid Mehmood alias Khaloo v/s

The State” reported as 2022 SCMR_1148, the
Hon’ble Apex Court has reiterated the same
rationa] by observing that in these circumstances, a
dent in the prosecution's case has been created,
benefit of which must be given to the appellant. It
is a settled law that single circumstance creating
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the
guilt of accused makes him entitled to its
benefits, not as a matter of grace and concession
but as a matter of right. The conviction must be
based on unimpeachable, trustworthy and reliable

evidence. In the case of “Muhammad Mansha v/s

The State” reported as 2018 SCMR 772, the

Hon’ble Apex Court has also held that while

{0.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-20-

giving the benefit of doubt to an accused it is not
necessary that there should be many circumstances
creating doubt. If there is a circumstance which
creates reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about
the guilt of the accused, then the accused would be
entitled to the benefit of such doubt, not as a matter
of grace and concession, but as a matter of right. It
is based on the maxim, "it is better that ten guilty
persons be acquitted rather than one innocent
person be convicted". In the case of “Tarig Pervai

ws The State” reported as 1995 SCMR 1345 , the

Hon’ble Apex Court has held that the concept of
benefit of doubt to an accused person is
deep-rooted in our country. For giving him benefit
of doubt, it is not necessary that there should be
many circumstances creating doubts. If there is a
circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a
prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then
the accused will be entitled to the benefit not as a
matter of grace and concession but as a matter of

right.

18. In light of what has been discussed
above, the instant appeal is allowed, the impugned
order/judgment passed by the learned Sessions
Judge/Zila Qazi Dir Lower dated 10.02.2022 is set
aside and consequently the appellant namely Syed
Bahadar is acquitted of all charges leveled against
him. He be released forthwith from the Jail, if not
required in any other case, however, the
observations recorded by this Court shall not
prejudice the mind of the learned trial Court while
dealing with the case absconding co-accused
namely Sher Khan and his case is to be decided by
the learned trial Court on the basis of evidence

brought by the prosecution in his trial.
