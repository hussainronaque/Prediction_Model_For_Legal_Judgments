Station Ghazni Khel, Lakki Marwat, granted vide

order dated 15.07.2017 by the learned Judicial

Magistrate-VITI, Lakki Marwat.

2. Pithy facts of the case as per FIR
mentioned above are that complainant Muhammad
Ayaz, reported the matter to the local police on
14.07.2017 at 08.30 hours, to the effect that on
17.06.2017 when he, riding on motorcycle model

2013 Honda Delex, was going towards the house of

Jehangir Khan situated at Saeed Khel and at about

D:\Azam P.S/OS
-2-
21.20 hours, reached near the bridge, meanwhile

two persons armed with Kalashnikovs appeared,
aimed their weapons and forcibly snatched key of
motorcycle, during this another person riding on
motorcycle standing near the two persons ignited
his motorcycle and in its light, the complainant
identified one Sajjad son of Muhammad Zaman r/o
Kheru Khel. The accused fled away after snatching
the motorcycle. The complainant also alleged that
he can identify other persons, if confronted. Hence,
the FIR.

3. The accused/ respondent after his
arrest moved bail application before the learned
Judicial Magistrate-VII, Lakki Marwat, who vide

'

order dated 15.07.2017 accepted the same. The
petitioner has impugned -bail granting order dated
15.07.2017 before the Court of learned Sessions
Judge, Lakki Marwat, but in vain. Hence, this bail
cancellation petition.

4. Arguments heard in motion and

-3-

available record perused.

5. Learned counsel for the petitioner
argued that accused / respondent is directly charged
for an offence that comes within the prohibitory
clause of section 497 Cr.PC. The offence
committed is against the society at large also,
however, the learned Additional Sessions Judge has

not considered this aspect of the case and allowed

bail to the accused/ respondent. He prayed for

cancellation of bail.

6. The contents of FIR reveals that the

SD

time of occurrence is 21:20 hours, dated

17.06.2017, while the petitioner reported the
matter to the local police on 11.07.2017 at 08:30
hours. There is unexplained delay in lodging the
F.I.R. Similarly if he had identified the accused on
the crucial time then what preventing him for
waiting for about 24/25 days.

7. Learned counsel referred to an FIR

No. 316 dated 11.07.2017 under section 324/ 353/

427/ 216/ 148/ 149 PPC, 15 AA, wherein accused

® Sajjad was shown arrested in this case and then that

Ys Ss

mishap occurred. The story so put forward in the
FIR No.316 shall have its own facts and
circumstances to be dealt with separately, but under
no circumstances can be considered as an
explanation for the delay in lodging FIR in the
present case.

8. It is pertinent to mention here that it is
by now well settled that consideration for
cancellation of bail are different from the
consideration for the grant of bail. The bail can be
cancelled if the order on the face of it is perverse
and has been passed in violation of the principles
for grant of bail or it is patently illegal, erroneous,
factually incorrect and has resulted in miscarriage
of Justice. Reliance is placed on 2010 SCMR 580;
2006 SCMR_1265 and 2007 SCMR_ 482. While
considering the bail granting order, on the
touchstone of the judgements of the apex court, this

court found that the orders were neither perverse

>

\s

-5-
nor factually incorrect.

9. On granting bail to the accused there ts no
allegation that he has in any manner misused the
concession of bail. Similarly the offence alleged to
have been committed does not come within the
prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.PC, hence the
bail granting orders needs no interference.

10. It is reiterated that the superior courts
have set some principles which the courts have to
consider while granting, or refusing bail, those facts
are:

“(a) Whether there is or is not a reasonable
ground for believing that the accused has
committed the offence with which he is
charged?

(b) Whether the case requires further enquiry
into the guilt of commission of non-bailabie
offence within the scope of section 497(2),
Cr.P.C.?

(c) Whether the accused is minor, woman, sick
or infirm person?

(d) The nature and gravity of the charge.
(e) The severity ov degree of the punishment
which might follow in the circumstances of the

case on conviction.

(f) The danger of the accused absconding if he
is released on bail.

(g) The danger of witnesses heing tampered

» with.

(h) the danger of the alleged offence being
continued or repeated.

(i) The character, the means and standing of

the accused.

-6-

(j) An opportunity to the accused to prepare
his defence.

(k) The accused has already been in jail for a
considerable period and the trial is not likely
to conclude in near future at least.

() Bail should never be withheld as a
punishment.”

11. Needless to mention that the
observations so recorded above by this Court are
tentative in nature and shall have no bearing on the
merit of the case.

12. Keeping in view the above, this

petition for cancellation of bail has no merit is the

dismissed.

Announced.
