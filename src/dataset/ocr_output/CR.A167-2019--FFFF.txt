Muhammad Rahim S.I (PW-10) on 12.01.2017,
upon receiving information from Civil Hospital
Hangu, he rushed there where in emergency room
dead body of deceased Abdul Saeed s/o Abdul
Hafeez was lying and injured Muhibullah s/o Abdul
Hafeez was present. Injured Muhibullah reported the
matter to him regarding the occurrence, which he
reduced into writing in the shape of murasila Ex
PW-I/1, He prepared the injury sheet of injured
complainant Muhibullah Ex PW-10/1 as well as
injury sheet of deceased Abdul Saeed Ex PW 10/2.
He prepared the inquest report of the deceased Ex
PW-10/3 and sent the murasila through constable
Shafi ur Rehman No.782 to PS Saddar for

registration of the case.

5. On closure of prosecution evidence, the accused
were examined under Section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein they
denied the allegations and professed their innocence. They

did not wish to be examined on oath within the meaning of
section 340(2) Cr.PC, however, they opted to produce the
CD of the press conference Ex DX, available on the file.

6. On conclusion of trial, after hearing the learned
counsel for the parties and appraisal of evidence available
on the file, the learned trial Court vide impugned judgment
dated 21.02.2019 convicted and sentenced the appellant
Muhammad Akbar, as described in the opening paragraph
of the judgment whereas acquitted the respondent/accused
Noor Akbar from the charges leveled against him.

7. Feeling aggrieved from his conviction and sentence,
the appellant Muhammad Akbar has approached this Court
by filing Criminal instant appeal No.167-P/2019 with the
prayer that the impugned judgment may be set aside and he
may be acquitted from the charges leveled against him.
Muhib Ullah complainant being not satisfied from the
impugned judgment, also filed Criminal Revision No.34-
P/2019 for enhancement of sentence awarded to the
appellant and Criminal Appeal No.189-P of 2019 filed by
appellant Mohib Ullah against acquittal of co-accused Noor

Akbar.
8. We have heard arguments of the learned counsel for
the parties and perused the record carefully with their
valuable assistance.

9. Perusal of the record reveal that the occurrence has
taken place at 16:15 hours while the matter was reported at
17:15 hours at Civil Hospital, Hangi. The distance between
the place of occurrence and the police station has been
mentioned as 8/9 kilometers. Admittedly the complainant
Muhib Ullah (PW-J) has reported the matter in injured
condition and keeping in view the distance and the time
intervening between the occurrence and report it can be
safely held that a prompt report in the circumstances of the
case has been made which ruled out the possibility of
consultation and deliberation.

10. Admittedly the complainant sustained injuries in the
occurrence. It has never been suggested to the doctor or
other PWs that the injuries were self-inflicted or he got
injured some-where else and not at the place of occurrence.
His presence is duly corroborated by the recovery of blood
from the place of deceased and his testimony is also

supported by another witness Abdul Waheed (PW-2). The
narration of the witnesses is that after offering Asar prayer
they were proceeding to their house, the accused were
present there, they waylaid the complainant party and the
present occurrence took place. It is in matter of evidence
that the place of occurrence is at a distance of 25/30 paces
from the house of the complainant and deceased. They
being brothers inter-se are residing in one and the same
house. Their deposition is quite natural and not open to any
exception or any other interpretation with regard to the
mode and manner of the occurrence. In fact and
circumstances of the case, we feel no hesitation to believe
their testimony by holding that the PWs have given the
straightforward and natural narration of the occurrence and
there is no doubt that they were present at the time of
occurrence and most particularly the complainant who is
having the stamp of injuries on his person. Furthermore,
the blood stained garments of the deceased were sent to
FSL for analysis, the report whereof Ex PZ is in positive
wherein it has been opined that it was human blood and of

the same group.
10

11. The learned counsel referred to CD of press
conference which has been exhibited as Ex DX wherein
one uncle of the complainant namely Dr.Ahsan Ullah has
given the true picture of the occurrence in the press
conference who was accompanied with complainant as
well as injured eye witness in the said press conference. He
has charged Ain Ullah, Hashim Baz and Bismillah police
officials for the murder of his nephew Abdul Saeed and
that too in the police custody on an altercation of cutting of
tree. However, there is no expert report on the record which
could justify the genuineness of the said press conference
and thus has lost its evidentiary value. Otherwise the press
clippings and media reports are inadmissible for fixing the
guilt of the accused and cannot be taken into consideration
while deciding the fate of a criminal case until and unless
the same has been duly brought on record. In this regard
reliance is placed upon the judgment rendered by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled “MUHAMMAD
ASHRAF KHAN TAREEN AND ANOTHER VERSUS
THE STATE and another” reported in (1996 SC MR

1747) wherein it is held that:-
11

“Learned counsel for the appellant
wanted this Court to consider certain
newspaper cuttings about the incident.
The newspaper cuttings have not been
properly proved in the way required by
law of evidence. Particularly in a criminal
case such cuttings cannot be used either in
favour of the prosecution or in favour of
the defence, unless author of the same is
examined in Court as a witness. The case
of Ghulam Muhammad v. The State (1985
SCMR 1442) cited on behalf of the
appellant has no relevance.

Summing up, it may be mentioned
that besides ocular evidence of Taus
Khan, there is evidence of dying
declaration brought on record through
Mst.Yasmin and S.S.P. Faiz Khan and
there is evidence of recovery. In _ his
statement Exh. No.47, the appellant
denied the incident but did not give his
explanation about the circumstances
appearing against him. In his statement
the appellant did not even refer to the
newspaper reports. Overwhelming
prosecution evidence cannot be brushed
aside simply on the basis of denial of the
allegations by the appellant. In our view
the appellant was rightly found guilty of
the offences alleged against him and he

was rightly convicted”.

12. The doctor, who examined the injured as well as

conducted autopsy on the dead body of deceased, observed
12

sharp cutting wound at left ear region of deceased. He also
observed bleeding from nose, ear and mouth of deceased,
He also observed sharp cutting wound at right iliac fossa
about 6 cm and that abdominal wall, membranes and brain
at the base of skull were found injured; he opined that
death of the deceased was occurred due to injury to the
base of brain by sharp cutting weapon passed through the
left ear region and excessive bleeding, which as per the
report of the complainant were caused to the deceased by
appellant Muhammad Akbar.

13. By considering the overall facts and circumstances
of the case, by believing the eye witnesses, the arrest of the
appellant, the medical evidence and motive, the
prosecution has proved the guilt of the appellant
Muhammad Akbar through cogent and confidence
inspiring ocular/direct evidence. The PWs withstood the
test of cross-examination and nothing material could be
extracted from their mouth which could discard the
prosecution story to the extent of appellant Muhammad

Akbar.
13

14. Coming to the appeal against acquittal bearing
No.Cr.A No.189-P of 2019 filed by the complainant
against acquittal of respondent/accused Noor Akbar,
suffice it to say that the injury attributed to the present
respondent/accused is caused on the abdomen of the
deceased and that too superficial in nature in another words
the fatal injury has been attributed to the convicted co-
accused namely Muhammad Akbar. The cause of death is
also due to the injury caused to the brain/head of the
deceased. The learned trial court has rightly appreciated the
evidence and has given the benefit of doubt to the
accused/respondent. In this regard reliance is placed upon
the judgment rendered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
case titled “TAWAIB KHAN AND ANOTHER Versus
THE STATE?” reported in (P L D 1970 Supreme Court
13) wherein it is held that:-

“In the present case, judging he
dying declarations of the deceased and the
statement of Mst.Meraj Dana, in the light
of the physical circumstances of the case, I
have formed the opinion that whereas the
charge against Khwaja Muhammad who
had fired twice at the deceased, is clearly

proved, the charge against the other
14

appellant, namely, Tawaib Khan, is not at
all free from doubt. The injuries suffered
by the deceased in relation to the roles
which he has ascribed to his assailants,
furnish the best test to find out as to what
is the truth, or at least to discover what is
doubtful. According to him, he was fired
at by Khawaja Muhammad first in the
back. He says that after this he fired his
own rifle at Khawaja Muhammad
ineffectively, but the later simultaneously
fired another shot at him hitting him in
the abdomen. It seems obvious to me that
when he first saw Khawaja Muhammad
firing at him, he must have turned his
back to avoid a frontal shot. It was thus
that he received an injury on the back and
a grazing would (injury No.4) which had a
direction from backwards towards the
front. Then, he turned to fire at Khawaja
Muhammad with his own rifle without
striking him and just then he received the
second shot from him which hit him in the
front. The second shot, to my mind,
caused the two front injuries which the
deceased had sustained, one in the
abdomen and the other on his right
forearm. According to the site plan, the
firing by Khawaja Muhammad was done
from a distance of 40 paces. Therefore, the
dispersal of the pellets was quite large to

account for the distance in the injuries”.
15

Therefore, the testimony of the PW-1 in the light of
supra case, has been rightly believed by the learned trial
court to the extent of appellant Muhammad Akbar and has
been disbelieved to the extent of respondent/accused Noor
Akbar.

15. The prosecution has successfully proved its case
against appellant Muhammad Akbar through the testimony
of injured witness. It is noteworthy to highlight here that
factors in the case favoring respondent/accused Noor
Akbar could create no suspicion in establishing the
presence of the eye witnesses on the spot at the relevant
time and their credibility has not been shattered, however,
the same would only show a reasonable possibility in our
mind that participation of accused/respondent Noor Akbar
has not been duly proved by the prosecution to the hilt, as
such, for safe administration of justice he is entitled to get
benefit of doubt. At times, court extends benefit of doubt to
some of accused as an abundant caution that will not
certainly signify that the witnesses were not truthful. As
such this court holds that the learned trial court ‘has

properly evaluated the prosecution evidence brought on
16

record by extending benefit of doubt to respondent/accused
Noor Akbar and rightly convicted and sentenced the
appellant Muhammad Akbar. The acquittal of respondent
Noor Akbar will not entitle the appellant Muhammad
Akbar to outright acquittal.

16. So far as the Criminal Revision No.34/2019 filed by
the complainant for enhancement of sentence awarded to
the appellant is concerned, the reason given by the trial
court for awarding lesser sentence to the appellant
Muhammad Akbar is that motive has not been duly proved
by the prosecution and in addition to that solitary stab
wound on the deceased is attributed to the appellant
Muhammad Akbar. More so, it is on record that certain
altercation has also taken place between the parties. In view
of the above the quantum of sentence awarded to the
appellant Muhammad Akbar needs no interference.

17. For what has been discussed above, Criminal Appeal
No.167-P/2019 filed by the appellant Muhammad Akbar
against his conviction and sentences awarded to him vide
impugned judgment dated 21.09.2019 passed by learned

Additional Sessions Judge-I, Hangu in case FIR No.23
17

dated 12.01.2017 under sections 302/324/337-F(ii)/34 PPC
registered at Police Station, Saddar Hangu, is dismissed
and the impugned judgment of the learned trial court is
maintained. Needless to mention here that all the
substantive sentences awarded to the appellant shall run
concurrently and benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C is
extended to the appellant. Whereas the Criminal Revision
No.34/2019 for enhancement of sentences awarded to
appellant Muhammad Akbar (accused/respondent) and
Criminal Appeal No./89-P/2019 against acquittal of
accused/respondent Noor Akbar are also dismissed.
