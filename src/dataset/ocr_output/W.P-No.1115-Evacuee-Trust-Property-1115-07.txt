No.1 to 7,24 to 26 Mr.Asghar Ali, Advocate for respondents

No.8 to 23 & Mr. Muhammad Javed Yousafzai, AAG for

MUHAMMAD YOUNIS THAHEEM, J.- Through the

instant petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioners have called in question
the order dated 07.4.2007 passed by Secretary, Government of
Pakistan, Ministry of Minorities, Islamabad (respondent No.33)
whereby revision Petition No.3-322/2005-Rev filed by respondents
No.1 to 26 Mst: Rubina Ibad and others against the order dated
20.5.2005 passed by Chairman Evacuee Trust Property Board was

allowed.

2. This case has long checkered history. Dispute among
the parties is regarding land measuring 12 kanal and 08 marla
relating to Khata No.252 bearing Khasra No.96, situated in Mahal,
Tukra No.1 Peshawar city was declared as evacuee trust property
by the Chairman Evacuee Trust Property Board (hereinafter called

as E.T.P.B) on the strength of Revenue Record vide mutation
No.656 sanctioned on 26.06.1927 transferred to Trust under Panj
Teerath Committee and other relevant record while respondents
No.1 to 26 asserts that it was landed property leftover by the native
Handus, and so was evacuee property in simple resultantly was
included in the compensation pool by the settlement department
under the Displaced Persons (Compensation & Rehabilitation) Act
1958, hence was allotted to the refugees against their verified

claims vide RL II No.60,61,62 & 165 to:

i) Jan Muhammad 5 kanal 0 marla
ii) Ahmad Bakhsh 2kanal 08 marla
iii) Fazal Ahmad 0 kanal 12 marla
iv) Muhammad Ali 4 kanal 08 marla
12 kanal 08 marla

Above alleged allottees further sold out their shares onward to the

present respondents No.1 to 26.

3. The Chairman, E.T.P.B declared the same property as
Evacuee Trust Property shown in possession and ownership of Panj
Teerath committee under section 8 of Evacuee Trust Properties
(Management and Disposal) Act, 1975 vide order dated 25.11.1976
and transfers vide RL-II No.60,61,62 in the name of (i) Jan
Muhammad 05 kanal on 22.09.1961 (ii) Ahmad Bakhsh, Noor
Muhammad and Abdul Majid 02 kanal 08 marla on 22.09.1969 (iii)
Fazal Ahmad 12 marla on 22.09.1964 were declared validated
under 10 of E.T.P Act 1975 being bonafide purchasers prior to
target date Jun 1968 and transfer in the name of Muhammad Ali
area measuring 04 kanal 08 marla vide LR-II No.165 dated
03.04.1974 being after target date of June 1968 was declared

invalid.
4. The above order dated 25.11.1976 was challenged by
Deputy Administrator E.T.P.B by filing revision petitions u/s 17 of
E.T.P (M&D) Act 1975 bearing No.3-6/77-ETP against Municipal
Committee, Peshawar and 16 others. Similarly (1) Muhammad Ali
Khan (2) Muhammad Ibad and 03 others also challenged the same
order dated 25.11.1976 by filing their separate revision petition
No.3-7/77-ETP against Chairman E.T.P.B & 03 others before the
Revisional Authority in respect of above mentioned disputed
property contained in Khasra No.96. Both the revision petitions
were heard together being relating to same subject matter and
involving common question of law, so consolidated order dated
27.11.1979 was passed by the learned revisional authority vide
which revision petition filed by Deputy Administrator was accepted
and the impugned order dated 25.11.1976 passed by the Chairman
E.T.P.B. was set aside and case was remanded to the Chairman for
decision afresh after recording of evidence. Similarly revision
petition filed by respondents No.1 to 26 was disposed in the light of
consolidated order dated 27.11.1979. The relevant concluding para
of remand order dated 27.11.1979 is reproduced as below.

“From the reasons mentioned above, I accept

the revision petition of the Deputy

Administrator and set aside the impugned

orders of the Chairman, the case is remanded

back to him for recording fresh evidence and

deciding the case strictly in accordance with

the provisions of the law on the subject. The

revision petition of Muhammad Ali Khan and

four others is also remanded for similar
action.”

5. After remand, evidence of Patwari Halqa Tukra No.1,
Peshawar was recorded who produced revenue record and the then

Chairman Evacuee Trust Property Board, passed an order on
20.05.2005, vide which all RL-IIs in favour of claimants
respondents No.1 to 26 or from whom they purchased disputed land
were cancelled and property pertaining to Khasra No.96 was
declared as “Evacuee Trust Property” and Deputy Administrator
was directed to take over the management of trust property. The
relevant concluding para of above said order dated 20.05.2005 is
reproduced as below.

“On the request of the counsel for the parties,
they were directed to file the written
arguments which they have filed and have
been placed on record.

After hearing the arguments of the
parties and going through the statements of
witnesses and the written arguments filed by
the parties, I have come to conclusion that as
per revenue record contained in Jamabandis
for the year 1929-30 upto 1951-52 the land in
question belongs to Abadi Deh/Panj Teerath
Committee through Lal Nath Chela Chand
Nath. Moreover, copy of exemption Ex P/2 for
the year 1929-30 clearly shows that the land
in question, measuring 12 kanals & 08 Marlas
belongs to Panj Teerath and has been shown
exempted from payment of any tax. Further
as per mutation No.656 dated 26.06.1927 the
old Khasra No.55 measuring 9 Kanals & 4
Marlas, was part of the present Khasra No.96
under the management of Lal Nath Chela
Baba Chand Nath. Even_as_per mutation
No.758 dated 14.05.1929 the land in question
is a trust property under the management of
Dewan Singh s/o Narinjan Singh pertaining

to Khasra No.66 measuring 3 Kanals & 11
Marals. The respondents have miserably

failed to produce any documentary evidence
pertaining to the period prior to partition of
1947. In view of the above facts, the evacuee
trust nature of the land in question as per pre
and post partition revenue record is beyond
doubt, therefore, I have no hesitation to
declare the land in question as an evacuee
trust property. Let it be notified under the
law.

As regards validation, admittedly RL-II
No.165 was issued on 06.02.1974 i.e much
after the target date of June, 1964. The said
RL-II was got issued by the allottee in

connivance with the Settlement Department
with malafide intention despite the evacuee
trust nature of the said land. Even otherwise
the allotment is anti-dated and has been
made after the target date which cannot be
validated. Since all the mandatory conditions
for validation of such transfers as per
provisions of Section 10 of the Act ibid, are
not fulfilled hence the transfer cannot be
validated. I, therefore, cancel the RL-II No.165
dated 06.02.1974 alongwith subsequent
mutations sanctioned in respect of the land in
question. Further alienation, if any, will also
meet the same fate.”

nN

° Feeling aggrieved from the order of Chairman E.T.P

Board dated 20.05.2005 respondents No.1 to 26 (including legal
heirs of deceased respondents as well as subsequent purchasers)
filed revision petition before the Revisional Authority/Secretary to
Federal Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Minorities Islamabad,
the Revisional Authority/respondent No.33, after hearing the parties
allowed the petition vide impugned order dated 07.4.2007 and
declared the suit property relating to Khasra No.96 as an ‘Evacuee
Property’ and not ‘Evacuee Trust Property’ by giving validation
to the allotments to the allottees through different RL-IIs
No.60,61,62 & 165 by settlement department discussed above and
subsequent transfers. The concluding para of impugned order dated
07.04.2007 is reproduced as under:-

“Ihave no hesitation to conclude that the land
exclusively falling under khasra No.96
measuring 12 kanal and 08 marla is simply
an evacuee property and lawfully formed part
of the Compensation Pool for allotment to
bonafide claimants against their verified
claims. Accordingly after having concluded as
such I equally hold that transfers of land by
the Settlement and Rehabilitation
Department are maintained under the laws.
The validation of land under RL-IIs No.60 to
165 are valid alongwith subsequent transfers
against khasra No.96 given effect under the
provision of relevant laws/rules.”

7. Feeling aggrieved from the above order dated

07.04.2007 passed by Revisional Authority/Federal Secretary
respondent No.33 the present petitioners filed instant writ petition
under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of
Pakistan 1973. The same was partially allowed vide judgment dated
28.01.2015 and case was again remanded to the learned Revisional
Authority for its decision afresh after giving findings on the
maintainability and competency of proceedings before it. The
above remand order of this Court was challenged by respondents
No.1 to 26, Ghulam Farooq and others before the Hon’ble Supreme
Court of Pakistan through C.P No.456/2015 and the Hon’ble apex
Court remanded the matter back to this Court for decision a fresh
which was also agreed by learned counsel for the parties vide

judgment dated 11.02.2016 with the following guide lines:-

“We have noted from the impugned judgment
that the High Court has considered the merit
of the case considerably and whether the
proceedings before the respondent No.33 was
competent or not in the light of the judgment
of this Court in Iftikhar-ud-Din’s case (2000
SCMR 1), the same could have been adverted
to by the High Court as it was a simple
question of the maintainability of proceeding
requiring examination of the law. In the light
of the background of the case more so its long
pendency, it seems advisable that High Court
while exercising its writ jurisdiction decide
the matter including the question of
jurisdiction of respondent No.33. The remand
of the case, thus, appears to us un-necessary
and the High Court ought to have decided the
said writ petition including the question of
the maintainability of proceeding before the
respondent No.33.
The learned counsel for the
parties also agree that the matter be
remanded to the High Court for re-decision of
the writ petition on merit as well as on legal
issues.

Consequently, this petition is
converted into appeal and allowed. The
impugned judgment is set aside and the
matter is remanded to the High Court for
decision afresh of the writ petition on merits
as well as on all legal issues that are raised
before the High Court by the parties.”

8. The learned counsel for the petitioners argued that the
property pertaining to khasra No.96 became ownership of a Hindu
Religious Trust Managed by Panj Teerath Committee vide mutation
No.656 sanctioned on 26.06.1927, and was exempted from the
payment of Revenue vide Fehrist Maafiat placed on record as Ex
P-12 since it’s establishment, thereafter the name of Panj Teerath
Committee has been shown entered in the column of ownership
pertaining to year 1929-30 and onward Jamabandi till 1947. The
name of Panj Teerath Committee has been mentioned in the column
of cultivation/possession as Hisadar, however lateron after 1947
when Hindus migrated from Peshawar certain irregular entries has
been shown sometime in the name of Abadi deh or somewhere in
the possession of Peshawar Municipal Committee and some where
again in the name of Panj Teerath or Lal Nath Cheela Baba Cheena
Nath. The entries in the name of Abadi deh or in column of
cultivation in the name of Municipal Committee, Peshawar were
wrongly and illegally shown and trust property of Panj Teerath
Committee was put to compensation pool by the settlement
department illegally. Learned counsel supported the findings of

Chairman E.T.P.B passed in the impugned order dated 20.05.2005.
He added that similar kind of litigation relating to other part of
property of Panj Teerath Trust bearing khasra Nos.101,102,103 and
104 situated in Mahal Tukra No.1 Peshawar city was claimed by
one Muhammad Amin & others as their ownership which was
declared ‘Evacuee Trust Property’ under the management of Panj
Teerath Committee by Chairman u/s 8 of E.T.P (M&D) Act 1975
and order declaring it as ‘Evacuee Trust Property’ was challenged
by the then occupier before Revisional Authority, who maintained
the order of Chairman. The order of Chairman and Revisional
Authority was challenged through W.P No.204/82 which was
decided by this Court on 09.05.1983 and the same judgment of this
Court passed in W.P No.204/82 was upheld vide judgment dated
06.04.1986 by the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in CP
No.153-P/1983 in case titled as Amir Khan Vs E.T.P ete on
06.04.1986. Learned counsel further argued that impugned order
dated 07.04.2007 passed by respondent No.33 is against law, facts
and is without considering 30 years old document placed on file in
the evidence in shape of mutation No.656 and Fehrist Maafiat i.e
Revenue Record regarding exemption from payment of revenue
due to Waqf placed on record as Ex P-12 Jamabnadi pertaining to
year 1929-30. He added that same property had been correctly
declared as ‘Evacuee Trust Property’ by the Chairman by
appreciating the documents and evidence on record after remand
while learned Revisional Authority based its findings upon illegal,
irregular revenue record prepared after 1947 that also upon bogus
RL-IIs No.60,61,62 and 165. He added that ibid Act has provided
remedy of revision u/s 17 to call for record upon challenging of

order of Chairman and in this respect Federal Secretary, Ministry of
Religious and Minorities affairs exercises powers as Revisional
Authority by adding that he has wrongly and illegally exercise its
jurisdiction and impugned order dated 07.04.2007 is the result of
misreading and non-reading of evidence and record, so, he prayed
that the impugned order dated 07.4.2007 be declared null and void,
against facts and law, so, be set aside and order of learned

Chairman dated 20.05.2005 be kept maintained.

9. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents

No.1 to 26 vehemently supported the impugned order dated
07.04.2007 passed by learned Revisional Authority. He added that
disputed property bearing khasra No.96 was correctly put to
compensation pool by the settlement department as it was evacuee
land left over by native Hindus who migrated from Pakistan to
Bharat after partition of India into two independent countries i.e
Pakistan and Bharat and property in dispute was rightly allotted to
the displaced Muslims who migrated to Pakistan leaving their
landed property behind in Bharat against their verified claims for
‘Evacuee Property’ and the disputed property being ‘Evacuee
Property’ and not ‘Evacuee Trust Property’ was rightly allotted
to them vide RL-IIs No.60,61,62 & 165 and the Chairman E.T.P.B
was not authorized to declare the ‘Evacuee Property’ as ‘Evacuee
Trust Property’, so the order passed by Chairman was without
lawful jurisdiction against evidence on record particularly
jamabandies from 1929-30 till date, hence was rightly set aside by
the Revisional Authority. He further argued that in the Jamabandi
prepared during settlement operation and after 1947, it was not

entered in the name of Panj Teerath Trust, so prayed that under
-10-

E.T.P ibid Act the respondent No.33 is competent Revisional
Authority for calling record to re-examine the findings of
Chairman, who after going through entire record had revisited the
order of learned Chairman and correctly annulled it to which no

exception could be taken.

10. We have heard the arguments of learned counsel for

the parties and have gone through the available record.

11. From the perusal of record annexed with petition,
produced during recording of evidence after remand order dated
27.11.1979, it reveals that the property pertaining to Khasra No.96
measuring 12 kanal 08 marla has been entered in column No.4 in
the name of Trust Managed by Panj Teerath Committee, Peshawar
transferred vide mutation No.656 sanctioned on 20.6.1927 lying on
record in the instant petition as Annexure “B” entered as ‘Mall
wagf ba ehtimam panj teerath committee shehr Peshawar’ same
mutation has been shown incorporated in the column of owners as
Panj Teerath, Khasra No.96 alongwith other Khasra Nos relating to
Jamabandi 1929-30 while entry regarding exemption from payment
of revenue vide letter No.1370 due to Waqaf Ahle Hanood has been
made which is placed on record as Annexure “C” on page 21 of the
instant petition. According to Jamabandi 1933-34 placed on page
24 of petition the entry in the column of cultivation/possession is in
the name of “Lal Nath Chaila Baba Cheena Nath” as sharer and
lessor while Sardar s/o Faquir Muhammad is shown as lessee and
same entries continued in the Jamabandies pertaining to year 1937-

38, wherein lease is shown cancelled vide mutation No.601. In the
-ll-

Jamabandi pertaining to year 1941-42 in column of possession the
name of Lal Nath as Hissadar is appearing in the year 1947-48. The
entries in the column of cultivation in the name of Lal Nath Cheela
Cheena Nath Hissadar remain intact but when Pakistan came into
being thereafter entries started changing which seems due to
migration of Hindus but even in the year 1951-52 name of Lal Nath
Cheela Cheena Nath Hissadar alongwith entry of lease holders
subsisted. The Lal Nath chaila Baba Cheena Nath has been entered
in column No.4 as Maal Wagf Ba Ehtimam Lal Nath in the
mutation No.656. So previous to mutation No.656, it was Trust
Property under the management of Lal Nath Chaila Baba Cheena
Nath, who was disciple of Baba Cheena Nath.

12. From the perusal of shown RL-11 No.60 it has been
sanctioned on 13.07.1968. In the order Khasra No.19 in lieu of 59
units has been shown allotted while on the same RL-II, 69 units and
Khasra number are mentioned as 50 and 51 pertaining to Khata
No.9 to 11 sanctioned by Additional Settlement commissioner,
Peshawar on 22.09.1964. So this RL-II No.60 is, if genuine and
legal, then it is about some other land beside, there is no mention of
verified claim on it, moreover in the order on over leaf there is over
cutting for the name Jan Muhammad which reveals that some other
name was cut and name of Jan Muhammad was inserted and this
cutting has not been endorsed by settlement officer concerned while
area has been shown as 10 kanal 18 marla and the allotment is for
Lyallpur District of Punjab (present Faisal Abad) despite
opportunity of producing evidence no witness from Central Record
Office Lahore and rehibitation and settlement department Peshawar

has been produced to verify and testify the claims and RL-IIs. Same
-12-

is the position about RL-II No.61,62, particularly property allotted
vide RL-II No.165 is about evacuee landed property pertaining to
khasra Nos.2,689,690,837/313, 309,310,308 total area 14 kanal 3
marla situated in Mouza Gara Tajik Tehsil Peshawar besides on
RL-II No.165, there appears three orders of different settlement
officers and in each order Khasra Nos are different while order
shown dated 01.04.1972 is shown about impugned khasra No.96 to
the extent of 4 kanal 8 marla in the name of Muhammad Ali. All
allotment process shown on RL-Hs is through attorney but neither
Wasiqa No, nor Bahi No, nor date of attestation, nor office of sub-
registrar has been mentioned. In the evacuee settlement land related
records the element of fraud, manipulation, forgery and bogus
proceeding could not be ruled out, so the very RL-IIs are doubtful
and the settlement authorities without making, genuine and lawful
inquiry has put the Panj Teerath Trust Property into compensation
pool without scrutinizing revenue record in shape of mutation
No.656 and Maafiat Ex P-12 regarding khasra No.96 which was
and is Religious Trust Property then managed by Panj Teerath
Committee which was previously managed by Lal Nath Chaila
Baba Cheena Nath. The learned Revisional Authority failed to
examine the relevant revenue record in shape of mutation No.656
and exemption from payment of revenue record vide Fehrist
Maafiat Ex P-12 and other persistent entries in the column of
ownership and cultivation as Hissadar of the Panj Teerath
Committee or Lal Nath before 1947 while strong presumption of
truth is attached to the old revenue record particularly when
mutation No.656 and Maafiyat EX P-12 are still in field. The

preponderance of record is showing that disputed property is Trust
-13-

Property. In this respect reliance is placed on case titled as
“District Evacuee Trust Committee Vs Muhammad Umar &
others” (1990 SCMR 25), while the respondents No.1 to 26 and
settlement department failed to discharge burden upon them that
property is Evacuee Property and not Trust Property. In this respect
wisdom is derived from the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in
cases cited as PLD1991 SC 586 & 1991 SCMR 2206.

13. The instant petition was decided by this Court vide
judgment dated 28.01.2015, order of respondent No.33 i.e of
Revisional Authority was set aside and case was remanded to him
i.e to respondent No.33 to re-decide the matter after giving findings
on the maintainability and competency of proceedings before it in
the light of judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan cited
as 2000 SCMR 1, same remand order was assailed by filing Civil
Petition No.456/2015 and the Hon’ble apex Court observed that
same could have been adverted to and decided by this Court in the
background of this case due to its long pendency with direction to
examine the question of jurisdiction and competency of respondent
No.33 vide order dated 11.02.2016.

14. Now the question before this Court for determination
remains as to whether Revisional Authority u/s 17 of ETP (M&D)
Act 1975 has jurisdiction and is competent to examine the order
passed u/s 8 of ibid Act by the Chairman of E.T.P.B and on merit
whether property in question was or is Evacuee Trust Property or
simply Evacuee Property left over by the native Hindus who
migrated to Bharat after 1947.

15. This Court gone through the judgment passed by

Shariat Appellate Bench of Hon’ble Supreme Court cited as 2000
-14-

SCMR 1, Evacuee Trust Property Act 1975 and the Evacuee Trust
Property (Appeal and Revision) Rules 1980. Under the ibid Act
1975 provisions relating to appeal are provided in Section 16 and
according to section 16(a), if order is passed by Assistant
Administrator or Deputy Administrator the appeal lies before the
Administrator and u/s 16(b), in case order is passed by the
Administrator, not being an order passed in appeal by
Administrator confirming an order of Assistant Administrator or a
Deputy Administrator to the Chairman and in the Act as well as in
Rules 1980, no provision of appeal against original order of
Chairman is provided rather it is provided that order passed by
Chairman is final. For comprehension the provisions envisaged in
Section 8 are reproduced as below:-
Section 8:- Declaration of property as
evacuee trust property.
(1) | If a question arises whether an
evacuee property is attached to
charitable, religious or educational
trust or institution or not, it shall be
decided by the Chairman whose
decision shall be final and shall not,
except as provided in sub-section

(4), be called in question in any
Court.

16. Similarly in the ibid Act revisional powers has been
provided u/s 17 to the Federal Government to call for record of any
case or proceedings under this ibid Act which is pending or in
which the Chairman and Administrator etc for the purpose of
satisfying itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of such

an order and may pass such an order in relation thereto as the
-15-

Federal Government thinks fit. The provisions, contained in Section
17 are reproduced as below:-

Section 17:-Revision. (1) The Federal
Government may, of its own motion:-

@ If no appeal is preferred to the High
Court or as the case may be, to the
Chairman within the period allowed for
preferring such appeal, at any time
after the expiry of such period, or

(ii) If an appeal is preferred to the
Chairman, at any time during the
pendency of the appeal or after
judgment has been pronounced by him.
Call for the record of any case or
proceeding for the purpose of satisfying
itself as to the correctness, legality or
propriety of such order and may pass
such order in relation thereto as it
thinks fit.

Call for the record of any case or
proceeding for the purpose of satisfying
himself as to the correctness, legality or
propriety or such order and may pass
such order in relation thereto as he
thinks fit.

(3) No order under this section or
section 18 shall be passed revising or
modifying any order affecting any
person without giving such person a
reasonable opportunity of being heard.

17. The Hon’ble Shariat Appellate Bench of Supreme

Court of Pakistan in its judgment in case “Federation of Pakistan
through Secretary Religious Affairs/Minority Vs Mufti
Iftikhar-ud-Din” cited as (2000 SCMR 1), held that in E.T.P
(M&D) Act 1975, no provision of appeal against the original order
of Chairman has been provided, so there shall be a right of at least
one appeal, in this respect Federal Government was directed to
table the amendment bill before legislature for providing right of

appeal against the original order passed by the Chairman E.T.P.B
-16-

by 30" of July 1999 while the same cited judgment was passed on
25" of March 1989 but up till now, no same direction of Han’ble
apex Court to amend the law has been acted upon by the worthy
Federal parliament or by any Assembly of the federating unit.
Moreover the provisions of Section 8,10 and 21 of E.T.P (M&D)
Act have not been held contrary to injunctions of Holy Quran and
Sunah of Holy Prophet (PBUH) and in case titled as “Khurshid
Ahmad Vs Rana Mumtaz Ahmad & other” cited as 2016 SCMR
679, a principle has been laid down by Hon’ble apex Court, that the
final order passed by Federal Government is assailable before the
High Court in exercise of constitutional jurisdiction. The relevant
paragraph is reproduced:-

“A look at the extracts from the record of
rights for the year 1938-1939 and
onward would reveal that this property
has been entered as Gaoshala Society
Bar. These entries have been repeated
till 1960-1961. After 1960-1961 the
Auqaf Department took the control and
management of this property and had
been managing this property through
lease to different persons as is evident
from the entries made in the periodical
records of 1964-1965, 1968-1969, 1980-
1981, 1984-1985 and 1988-1989.
Respondent No.1 claims to be_ the
allottee of this property through RL-II
mentioned above but at no stage of time
any entry of its allotment to the
respondent figured in any of the
periodical records ever since 1946-1947.
The respondent alleged that this
property was confirmed in his name but
the entries in RL-II do not conform to his
claim. He moved a_ petition under
Sections 8 and 10 of the Evacuee Trust
Property (Management and Disposal)
Act No.xXIII of 1975 in the Court of
Chairman Evacuee Trust Board, Govt. of
Pakistan but he could not substantiate
his claim that the property in dispute
was evacuee and that he was its lawful
-17-

allottee. Even entries in naqsha taqseem
do not support the contention that the
property in dispute has ever been
allotted to the respondent. The evidence
led in this behalf overwhelmingly proves
that the property is Evacuee Trust Board
for_its verdict about the nature of the
property but when the verdict given by
the Board turned against him, he turned
the table on the Board and proceeded to
question its verdict through a revision
petition. Somehow_he_ withdrew _it_and
instituted _a_civil_suit_questioning the
verdict of the Chairman Evacuee Trust
Board _notwithstanding _such _verdict
being amenable to the __ revisional
jurisdiction of the Federal Government
in_the hierarchy established under the
Act_and then Constitutional jurisdiction
of the High Court, could not have been
challenged in the Civil Court especially
when its jurisdiction was barred by
Section 14 of the Evacuee_ Trust
Properties (Management and Disposal)
Act, 1975.”
