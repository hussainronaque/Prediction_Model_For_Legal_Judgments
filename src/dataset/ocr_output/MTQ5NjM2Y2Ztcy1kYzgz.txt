Criminal Bail Application No. D-06 of 2021

Hussain Dharejo, Advocate.
Respondent : The State, through Aftab Ahmed
Shar, APG.
Date of hearing : 09.02.2021
JUDGMENT

YOUSUF ALI SAYEED, J.- Vide this Application under Section
497 Cr. P.C, the Applicant, Lal Gul son of Ghulam Akbar, seeks

post arrest bail in respect of Crime No. 32/2020, registered at
Police Station, Sorah, District Khairpur (the “FIR) at the behest of
one Mst. Nazeeran (the “Complainant”) at 4 PM on 17.02.2014, in
relation to an incident said to have occurred 10 AM, earlier that

day.

2. In terms of the FIR, the Applicant stands accused of being
part of an unlawful assembly numbering 50 strong, armed
with various species of weaponry, ranging from hatchets and
lathis to pistol and assault rifles, from amongst whom, as
many as 29 persons were apparently known to the
Complainant in as much as they were identified by her by
name and parentage, with the others said to be unknown yet

identifiable if seen again.
The Applicant was named as one of the persons forming part
of that assemblage, and whilst a broad allegation was made as
to threats, aerial firing and arson, the Applicant was not one
of those specifically identified as having caused harm to

person or damage to property.

Counsel for the Applicant submitted that he had been falsely
implicated in the case due to political rivalry/enmity as he
and the other accused persons were affilaited to a different
political party from the Complainant. He submitted that the
FIR disclosed an exaggerated and unbelievable story designed
to falsely implicate a large group of persons, and pointed out
that the majority from within that group were on interim pre-
arrest bail granted by the learned trial Court and pre-arrest
bail granted to the alleged mastermind of the attack, albeit not
placed at the scene, had also been confirmed by a learned
Division Bench of this Court on 20.12.2017 in Criminal Bail
Application No. 585 of 2014.

Other than stating that the Applicant had been named in the
FIR, the learned APG did not disclose any incriminating
recovery from the Applicant or other compelling reason as to
why the concession of bail ought not to be extended. Despite

issuance of notice, the Complainant did not come forward.

At this stage, we would consciously refrain from embarking on
a dissection of the events narrated in the FIR, lest any
observation prejudice the course of the trial. However, suffice
it to say that under the given circumstances, as the matter
has already been challaned and the Applicant is no longer
required for the purpose of investigation, and as the question
of his depicted presence at the scene and guilt or innocence
remain to be determined at trial, we are of the view that a case

for the grant of bail stands made out.
7. Accordingly, through a short order made in open Court on
09.02.2021 upon culmination of the hearing, we had allowed
the Application and admitted the Applicant to bail subject to
furnishing of solvent surety in the sum of Rs.50,000/- and
execution of a P.R. Bond in the like amount to the satisfaction

of the trial Court.
