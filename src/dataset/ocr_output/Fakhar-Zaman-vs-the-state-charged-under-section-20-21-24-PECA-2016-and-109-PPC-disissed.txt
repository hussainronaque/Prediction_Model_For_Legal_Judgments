Having heard arguments of the learned

counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel for

complainant alongwith Assistant Attorney General, the

available record gone through.

Ie

Learned counsel for the petitioner relied

upon the judgments reported as 2021 SCMR 557

Muhammad Daniyal Farrukh Ansari vs the State, 2021

P Cr.L.J 506 Akhtar Khan vs the State and 2017 P

Cr.L.J_1715 Muhammad Azam Davi vs the State

through FIA. Inversely, learned counsel for the

complainant referred to the dictums reported in 2018 P

Cr.LJ_ 408 Usman Bin Mehmood vs the State and
another, 2020 PCr.L.J_705 Muhammad Usman vs the

State and another, 2021 PCr.L.J_ 119 Saleem Khalid

[>

On plain perusal of the levied sections

20, 21 and 24 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes

Act, 2016, this case within all the corners of definition

of the relevant sections of law has covered the act of

the petitioner as displaying and transmitting the

information to harm the reputation and privacy of the

complainant explicating the images in the form of

nude photos and videos in return of the same

intimidating her with sexual harassment while the

nude photos and videos under intimidation would be

sent to her husband, who is abroad to earn livelihood

for his family. These nude photos and videos available

on the record have been admitted to be in presence of

the complainant and the petitioner, which even verified

by the Assistant Director Forensic CCW FIA,

Peshawar through its report, the facts and findings

from digital forensics of the mobile phone and two
memory cards have been identified not only of the

present complainant but, besides, more explicit photos

and videos of other women have also been found. The

findings under the investigation would prima-facie

connect the petitioner leading to the recommendations

of challan against the petitioner. In all probabilities the

petitioner not only displayed the images and videos but

in order to gain financial benefits from the

complainant whose husband is abroad has received

handsome ransom hence, while the role of the

petitioner would fall within the preview of the

definition covered under his implication.

5. It is a general rule that when offences are

punishable with less than 10 years of imprisonment

ordinary, bails are granted however, in appropriate

cases, it is never compulsion over the court to grant

bail as a rule and may depart from this rule to deny any

favor to the petitioner where the complainant is

helpless has been victimized due to her nude images

and videos and blackmailed her financially to get

illegitimate demand as in the case in hand.
Complainant is stated to have been put under extortion

of sending her images and nude videos to her husband.

Thus while reliance is placed on the dictums referred

by the learned counsel for the complainant and

especially when this court is of the opinion that the

petitioner has sexually harassed the complainant, who

is a married woman while her husband is abroad doing

labour for earning livelihood for the family .

6. In view of the above observations, this

petition having no force, stands dismissed.

7. Before parting with this order, the

Investigation Officer, who is herself Sub Inspector FIA

CCRC Abbottabad, a young girl, shall seal all the

images and videos which will only be de-sealed on the

orders of the learned trial court.
