2. The brief facts of the prosecution case are that on

18.07.2013. Yaqoob Khan son of Khalil-ur-Rahman

deceased then injured was brought by his relatives to

Casualty Mardan Hospital; that the injured was conscious,

at 18.15 hours reported the matter to Muhammad Arif

Khan IHC, posted at Casualty Hospital, Mardan, to the

effect that on the day of occurrence he was busy in

irrigating his land; that in the meanwhile at 17.30 hours

Faqir Said son of Sardar-ud-Din and son Fayaz Khan duly

armed with firearms came and suddenly started firing at

him, resultantly he got hit and seriously injured. The

motive was reported to be dispute over irrigation water,

and that the occurrence was witnessed by his brother Latif-

ur-Rehman and Hayat Khan son of Ajab Khan. The report

of the complainant was reduced into writing in the shape of
murasila, which was thumb impressed by the injured as a

token of its correctness and also verified by Hayat Khan.

The author of report, prepared the injury sheet of the

injured, and referred him to the doctor for medical

treatment under the escort of constable Riaz No.1230. The

murasila was sent to police station for registration of case

FIR against the accused through constable Sohail No.2545.

The injured was examined by the doctor, and thereafter

referred to Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar. Later on, on

21.07.2013 the injured expired and section-302 PPC was

added in the case. The police prepared the injury sheet and

inquest report of the deceased and referred the dead body

to the doctor for conducting autopsy. On 07.01.2014

accused Faqir Said and Muhammad Fayaz Khan were

arrested in the case and thoroughly interrogated by the

Investigating Officer.

examination and age assessment of accused Fayaz Khan

son of Faqir Said. Accordingly, accused Fayaz Khan was

examined by the standing medical board, and he was

declared as juvenile offender and was directed to be tried
under Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000. Therefore,

separate challan against him was prepared and submitted

before the Judge Juvenile Court.

3. After completion of investigation, supplementary

challan was submitted against both the accused before the

Court. The accused was formally indicted by the trial

Court for the offence, to which he did not plead guilty and

claimed trial.

4. The prosecution in supports of its case examined

Mohammad Asif, Deputy Medical Superintendent,

DHQ, Hospital, Mardan (PW-11) deposed that he is

conversant with the hand writing and signature of Dr.

Nazeer Ahmad (late) and medicolegal report (EX PW

11/1) is in the hand writing of Dr. Nazeer Ahmad (late)

and bears his signature. Akbar Khan (PW-13) conducted

application (EX PW 13/2) he sent two empty cartridges of

12 to the Malkhana for safe custody, vide application (EX

PW 13/3) sent bloodstained garments and grass to the FSL

and received its report (EX PZ).

5. After closure of prosecution evidence, the convict-

appellant was examined under section 342 Cr.PC, wherein

he neither wished to be examined on Oath nor opted to

produce defence and denied the allegations leveled against

him. On hearing the learned counsel for the parties, the

learned trial Court vide judgment dated 29.04.2019

convicted and sentenced the appellant Faqir Said in the

manner already discussed above, hence the appellant has

impugned the judgment of the trial Court by filing the

instant Criminal Appeal before this Court.
6. We have heard arguments of learned counsel for the

parties and perused the record with their valuable

assistance.

7. It is the primary duty of the prosecution to bring

home charge against the accused beyond any reasonable

shadow of doubt, and most particularly in cases where

capital punishment is provided, the prosecution is under

statutory obligation to bring on record unimpeachable and

cogent evidence, which shall satisfy the judicial mind of

the Court with regard to the proof of charge leveled by the

prosecution against the accused indicted for the crime.

8. The deceased then injured Yaqoob Khan lodged

report (EX PA/1) in casualty of DHQ, Hospital, Mardan,

on 18.07.2013 at 18.15 hours, wherein he stated that

accused-appellant Faqir Said and co-accused Fayaz Khan

both came duly armed with firearms and started firing at

him, as a result of which he got hit and received serious

injuries. The report of the deceased then injured was

endorsed/verified by Hayat Khan (PW-9). The doctor who

examined the deceased then injured vide medicolegal

report (EX PW 14/1) also endorsed the report (EX PA/1)
10

by writing that the “patient fully conscious” and thereafter

the injured was referred to LRH, Peshawar, for further

treatment, where he succumbed to the injuries on

21.07.2013.

9. The deceased then injured Yaqoob Khan in his

report (EX PA/1) has stated that accused Faqir Said and

Fayaz Khan duly armed with “Aslaha Atasheen” came and

started firing at him without describing their individual

role. More so, the description of firearms has also not been

specified in the initial report and the general term of

“Aslaha Atasheen” has been mentioned in the initial

report. Perusal of postmortem examination report (EX PM)

reveals that the deceased received ten firearm entry

wounds on different parts of abdomen measuring 1x1 cm

each, the dimension of injuries are of one and the same

size and furthermore the seat of injuries shows that it is the

doing of one man. However, Hayat Khan (PW-9) the

eyewitness, who is father-in-law of the deceased, in his

Court statement stated that accused Faqir Said (appellant)

was armed with repeater rifle and his son Fayaz Khan

(Juvenile co-accused) was armed with rifle M-16 started
11

firing at the deceased due to which Yaqoob Khan was

injured. During spot inspection, the I.O recovered and took

into possession two empty shells of 12 bore SG. We are

fortified by the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court

rendered in Farman’s case (PLD 1980 SC 201), wherein

it is held that;

“In his dying declaration, Rashid Khan has involved the three

brothers as well as their friend, Farman Ali. But the medical
evidence and the evidence of the Ballistic Expert do seem to
cast doubt on his veracity. The evidence of Doctor Muhammad
Kamal, who had conducted autopsy on the dead body of Rashid
Khan’ is that the size of inlet of all the wounds suffered by him
was the same mearing thereby that he had been shot from one
or more than one weapon of the same caliber. it is in she
evidence of the Ballistic Expert, however, that the four empties
sent to him for examination’ were found to have been fired
through .32 bore pistol which was also sent to him by the
Investigation Officer. It would therefore follow that Rashid
Khan had been shot through a pistol and certainly not through
a rifle with which Farman Ali is said to have been armed. It is
true that according to the prosecution each one of the three
appellant brothers was armed with a .32 bore pistol: But the
type of injuries suffered by Rashid Khan rather suggests that it
was the work of one man. It is common knowledge that .32
bore pistol is an automatic weapon carrying in its charger
seven bullets. The fact that the deceased was found to have
suffered seven inlet wounds, three of them in his left Knee
joint, one on his left elbow, two in his abdomen and one in
backward direction to his right superior iliac spine, the inlet
size of all of which is said to be the same, would go a long way
to show that this could as well be the work of a single person
and not of the three appellants. There is no evidence on the
record to show, however, as to which one of the three had
caused him the said injuries, therefore, no option is left but to
hold that the prosecution has failed to bring home its case

against any one of the appellants.”
12

The same view was reiterated by the Hon’ble

Supreme Court in Muhammad _Zaman’s case (2014

SCMR 749).

10. The dying declaration of the deceased was recorded

in the Hospital, but that was in the presence of Hayat Khan

(PW-9) and it was signed by him. Possibility of prompting

and putting the names in the mouth of the deceased then

injured could not be ruled out as in suchlike circumstances,

where the dying declaration is recorded in the presence of

relatives is always looked into with suspicion by the

Courts while appraising the same notwithstanding the

condition of the deceased then injured at the time of report.

In this regard, reliance is placed upon the judgment of

Hon’ble Supreme Court in Muhammad Latif’s case (PLD

1970 SC 406).

11. Some of the tests for determining the genuineness of

dying declaration has been laid down by the superior

Courts from time to time, which are as follows:-

“1, Whether intrinsically it rings true;
2. Whether there is no chance of mistake on the
part of the dying ma in identifying or naming

his assailant; and
13

3. Whether it is free from prompting from any
outside quarter and is not inconsistent with
the other evidence and circumstances of the
case.”

In this regard, we are fortified by the judgment of this

Court rendered in Zabta Khan’s case (PLD 1963 (W.P)

Peshawar-66).

12. As discussed in the preceding paragraph, father and

son were attributed the role of firing and that too with

weapons of different caliber, the same is belied by medical

evidence as well as by the other circumstantial evidence. It

is practically impossible in the attending circumstances of

the case to hold the convict-appellant Faqir Said and his

son Fayaz Khan (Juvenile co-accused in connected

Criminal Appeal No.572-P/2019) individually — or

collectively responsible for the crime. In case of Tawab

Khan....vs.....State (PLD 1970 SC-13), wherein it was

held by the Apex Court that dying declaration like

statement of any witness is divisible, the same can be taken

into consideration against one accused and can be

disbelieved against the other accused. On the touchstone of

the principle of doctrine of “Sifting of evidence”. In case

of Hizar Hayat (PLD 2019 SC-527) the law on the subject
i.e “sifting of evidence” was evaluated by the Apex Court

by considering the law laid down by the superior Courts

right from Bakhshish Singh alias Bakhshi’s case (AIR

1925 Lahore 549) till the case of Munir_Ahmad’s case

(2019 SCMR-79) by dilating upon the entire law right

14

from 1925 till date, the Apex Court has held that;

13.

down in the ‘supra’ judgment, it is abundantly clear that

rule of “falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus” has been made

integral part of the criminal justice system, which is

applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present

“We may observe in the end that a judicial system
which permits deliberate falsehood is doomed to
fail and a society which tolerates it is destined to
self-destruct. Truth is the foundation of justice
and justice is the core and bedrock of a civilized
society and, thus, any compromise on truth
amounts to a compromise on a society's future as
a just, fair and civilized society. Our judicial
system has suffered a lot as a consequence of the
above mentioned permissible deviation from the
truth and it is about time that such a colossal

wrong may be rectified in all earnestness.

Therefore, in light of the discussion made above,
we declare that the rule falsus in uno, falsus in
omnibus shall henceforth _be_an_integral part of
our jurisprudence in criminal cases and the same
shall be given effect to, followed and applied by all

the courts in the country in its letter and spirit.”
(Emphasis provided)

While deriving wisdom from the guidelines laid
15

case, wherein we are of the firm view that element of

throwing net wide, exaggeration and falsehood is apparent

on the face of record.

14. At the time of arrest of accused-appellant Faqir Said

in case FIR No.12 dated 07.01.2014 u/s-324/353 PPC read

with section-13 A.O, the crime weapon i.e 12 bore shotgun

bearing No.10202293 with three live cartridges and one 30

bore pistol with rounds were recovered from his

possession. Perusal of record further reveals that the two

crime cartridges recovered from the spot were sent to the

Malkhana for safe custody, but the said crime cartridges

after recovery of shotgun were not sent to the FSL as to

whether the two crime cartridges recovered from the spot

were fired from the recovered shotgun or otherwise. It is

well settled principle of law that evidence of one case

cannot be read into another case.

15. Sher Ali Khan SI (PW-6) who conducted

investigation in the case, interrogated the convict-

appellant, took into possession repeater bearing

No.10202293 with three live rounds of the same bore vide

recovery memo (EX PW 6/4) produced to him by the
16

Muharrir of the P.S, as weapon of offence, however, in

cross examination he stated that the shotgun/repeater

produced to him by the Muharrir was not sealed. Mutabir

Khan (PW-7) the marginal witness to recovery memo (EX

PW 7/1) vide which the I.O took into possession

bloodstained grass from the spot and recovery memo (EX

PW 7/2) vide which the I.O took into possession two

empty cartridges of 12 bore SG Wah Industry Limited

lying in scattered condition on the spot. This witness in his

cross examination stated that Yaqoob Khan deceased was

his far relative; that his house is at a distance of about one

kilometer from the spot; that he came to know about 18.00

hours and came to the spot at 18.15 hours and by that time

the I.O also reached to the spot. He further stated that he

had not given any statement to the I.O but signed the

recovery memo. His testimony could not be believed to be

trustworthy for the reason that the deceased then injured

lodged report in DHQ Hospital, Mardan, at 18.15 hours,

his injury sheet was prepared and referred to the doctor for

treatment, sending of murasila to the Police Station, on

receipt of murasila, its contents were incorporated into
17

FIR, and thereafter the copy of FIR and murasila were

handed over to the Investigating Officer, and he proceeded

to the spot for conducting investigation, all the above

process have consumed sufficient time.

16. Hayat Khan son of Ajab Khan (PW-9) deposed that

on the day of occurrence he had to take turn of irrigating

fields from Yaqoob Khan deceased and was present at the

spot; that it was 17.30 hours when in the meantime

accused Faqir Said armed with repeater rifle and his son

armed with rifle M-16 started firing at the deceased due to

which he was injured. He also pointed out the spot to the

1.0. In cross examination, he stated that deceased Yaqoob

was his son in law and also his first maternal cousin and

their lands are adjacent to each other; that in his land, the

crops of maize and sugarcane were there; that he had come

for irrigation purpose about 30 minutes before the

occurrence; that he had brought spade for irrigation

purpose; that he had irrigated his fields for one hour or

1-1/2 hours when the occurrence took place; that after the

occurrence, he made a call to a Suzuki driver, which was

brought and the deceased in injured condition boarded it
18

while travelling a distance of 80 paces; that he had

wrapped chaddar from his injuries and little blood had

oozed while going to Suzuki. This witness has not

produced the spade, which he had taken to the fields for

irrigation purpose to the I.O. The site plan (EX PB) was

prepared at the pointation and instance of Hayat Khan

(PW-9), and in cross examination he admitted that he has

not shown his fields to the I.O at the spot and had also not

shown the irrigated portion of his land as well as the

standing crops in his fields. He also admitted that he has

not produced the revenue papers of his landed property to

the I.O. He has also not produced the chaddar through

which he had wrapped the injuries of the deceased then

injured.

17. The investigating officer during spot inspection

recovered two empty cartridges of 12 bore shotgun lying in

scattered condition, but in the site plan no separate point

has been given to the empties. Furthermore, (PW-9) in his

Court statement stated that convict-appellant Fagir Said

was armed with 12 bore shotgun while co-accused Fayaz

Khan (Juvenile) was stated to be armed with rifle M-16,
19

but not a single empty of M-16 rifle was recovered from

the place of occurrence despite the fact that the deceased

then injured in his initial report and (PW-9) in his Court

statement stated that both the above named accused had

fired at the deceased. The mode and manner of conducting

investigation, preparation of site plan at the instance of

eyewitness, recovery of empties from the spot, not

showing the fields as well as crops standing therein of

eyewitness Hayat Khan in the site plan, and production of

spade through which the deceased then injured, PW Latif-

ur-Rehman and Hayat Khan were irrigating their fields,

non-placing on record revenue papers/warbandi of landed

property owned by the eyewitness Hayat Khan (PW-9) and

deceased, all the above mentioned lacunas hammers the

case of prosecution.

18. Keeping in view the above discussion the

prosecution has not been able to bring home charge against

the appellant beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. By now

it is settled principle of law that in case of doubt, the

benefit thereof must accrue in favour of the accused as

matter of right and not of grace. In this regard we are
20

fortified by the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court

rendered in Tariq Pervez’s (1995 SCMR 1345), wherein it

was observed that for giving the benefit of doubt, it was

not necessary that there should be many circumstances

creating doubts. If there is circumstance which created

reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of the

accused, then the accused would be entitled to the benefit

of doubt not as a matter of grace and concession but as a

matter of right.

19. As a sequel to what has been discussed above, we
accept this Cr. Appeal No.573-P/2019, set aside the
impugned judgment dated 29.04.2019 passed by the
learned trial Court, and acquit the appellant of the charges
leveled against him. He be released forthwith, if not
required in any other case.

As the appellant Fagir Said has been acquitted,
therefore, Murder Reference No.14-P/2019 sent by the trial
Court is answered in negative.

Above are the detailed reasons of our short order of

even date.
