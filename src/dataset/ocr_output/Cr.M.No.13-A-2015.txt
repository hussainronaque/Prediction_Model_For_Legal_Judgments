Date of hearing

Appellant(s)/Petitioner (s)

Respondent (s)

QALANDAR_ ALI KHAN, _J:- Al-Haj
Zo » Sardar Mohazam Khan, petitioner, is a

_Heonviet prisoner in Central Jail, Haripur.

A He was tried b

| y Anti Terrorism Court,

WS Abbottabad, in a murder case and
sentenced to death, and his appeal before
this Court also failed. However, the death
sentence was remitted/reduced to life
imprisonment by the august apex Court

vide judgment dated 25.11.2014.

2. The petitioner has moved the instant

petition under Section 561-A Cr.PC for
nN

suspension of his sentence and his release

on parole on medical grounds. The
background of the application, explained

in the petition by the petitioner, is that he
contracted disease of brain tumor
(Malignant Meningioma) in the year 2010,
whereupon he underwent brain surgery

and recovered from immediate effects of

the disease, however, could not receive

\ the recommended treatment of radiation
BA “ therapy because of his confinement in the
jail, therefore, recurrence of the disease in

March, 2015, this time he also had

myocardial infarct (heart attack)causing
extensive damage to heart.

3. According to the contents of the
petition, the petitioner is presently
admitted in Neuro Ward of Ayub Medical
Complex in extremely serious condition
and his treatment has been practically

abandoned because of lack of facility and

skill available in Ayub Medical Complex or

else-where except in Gamma Radiation
3

Institute in Karachi, thus, he has been
recommended by Neuro Surgeon in Ayub
Medical complex for treatment in Medical
Institute for Gamma_ Radiation. The
petitioner has alleged, in the petition,
that his condition has reached dangerous
stage posing serious threat to life just
because he could not be properly looked
after in jail or in the hospital.

4. This case has its following unique

ZA.

’
__Zotereeterists, if not the first and only
Sy case of its kind, which are necessarily to
be kept in view at the time of
consideration of the petition under section

561-A Cr.PC.

(i) The petitioner was charged for
murder, and sentenced to death
by the trial Court, which was
upheld by _ this Court, but
remitted/reduced to life
imprisonment by the august
Apex Court.

(ii) Application under Section 561-A
Cr. PC has not been moved in

proceedings pending before a

Court.

(iii) The medical certificate/recommendation
for gamma radiation in a private
facility in Karachi is only by
Incharge, Neurosurgery
Department, Ayub Medical
Complex, Abbottabad, and not
by a Medical Board.

(iii) The petitioner is seeking his

ri? release on parole on medical

a . grounds.

wk 5, Admittedly, there are no pending

proceedings in any Court, right from

trail Court up to the august apex Court.
Additionally, the High Court is neither
the trial Court nor the final Court of
appeal in this case, so as to assume
jurisdiction under Section 561-A Cr. PC.
6. The medical certificate/recommendation

of Professor of Neurosurgery has been

obtained by the petitioner on his own,

without approaching the Standing
_—

i

ee

a

Medical Board through a Court or
concerned authority, in order to make
recommendation for release on parole
for gamma radiation in a private facility
at Karachi.

7. During arguments, learned
counsel for the petitioner referred to
PLD 1969 S.C 65, PLJ 1978 Cr.C
564, 2010 MLD 730 (Quetta), 2014

P.Cr.LJ 1598 (Sindh), 2012 YLR

.1315 and 1994 SCMR 798, all

A pertaining to pending cases and

appeals; but could not cite a single
precedent showing release of a convict
prisoner for treatment in a_ private
hospital on the basis of
opinion/recommendation of a_ single
medical officer when the courts had already
become functus officio after decision in the
case up to the august Apex Court. The
learned counsel also failed to persuade us to
exercise jurisdiction under section 561-A

Cr.PC when not a_ single precedent of

exercise of jurisdiction by the High
Court is available in a similar nature
case.

8. Consequently, the petition is
devoid of merit and is therefore

dismissed in limine.
