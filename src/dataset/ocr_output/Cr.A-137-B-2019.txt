SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.— We would like to decide instant

criminal appeal No. 137-B of 2019 filed by the convict/ appellant
Faheemullah alias Muhammad Fahim and Cr. R No.40-B of
2019,filed by the complainant Jehanzeb Khan for enhancement of
sentence against the appellant, through this single judgment, as both
the appeal and revision petition are filed against the same judgment
dated 07.05.2019, rendered by learned Additional Sessions Judge-I,
Karak, whereby accused/ appellant involved in case F.IL.R No. 213

dated 08.08.2009 registered at Police Station Latamber, District

*“Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr, Justice Sahibzada Asadullah,
Karak was convicted under section 302(b) PPC and sentenced to life
imprisonment with compensation of Rs.200000/-, payable to the
legal heirs of deceased within the meaning of section 544-A Cr.PC,
in default whereof he shall further suffer six months S.J. He was
also convicted under section 324 PPC, and sentenced to undergo
three years RI alongwith fine of Rs.20000/- in default whereof to
further undergo six-month SI.

2. The facts as gleaned from the F.LR are that on
08.08.2009 at 12.30 hours, Jehanzeb Khan complainant in the
company of his cousin Hanifullah brought the dead-body of his son
Muhammad Junaid to KDA hospital, Karak, where he reported the
matter to the local police that at 10.45 hours, he alongwith his son
Muhammad Junaid and cousin Hanifullah were sitting on the spot
for looking after Maize crop, meanwhile at about 10.45 accused/
appellant Muhammad Faheem duly armed with Kalashnikov,
appeared and fired at them, as a result of which his son Muhammad
Junaid was hit and sustained injuries, while the complainant and his
cousin Hanifullah escaped unhurt. The accused/ appellant after

commission of the offence decamped from the spot. While on their

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asaduliah,
way to the hospital the injured succumbed to the injuries. Motive

behind the occurrence alleged to be a dispute over the property, that

is the spot field.

3. Report of the complainant was reduced into Murasila.

Injury sheet was prepared and the dead-body was forwarded to

mortuary under the escort of constable Zafran No.488 for post

mortem examination, while the Murasila was sent to police station

concemed through constable Razaq No.555. After completion of

investigation, initially challan was submitted under section 512

Cr.PC, but subsequently after his arrest, supplementary challan was

submitted against him before the learned trial Court and after

complying with the provision under section 265-C Cr.PC, he was

formally charge sheeted to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed

trial

4. The prosecution in order to prove guilt of accused/

appellant produced and examined as many as twelve (12) witnesses.

After closing prosecution evidence, statement of accused /appellant

was recorded under section 342 Cr.PC, wherein he professed his

innocence. He did not wish to produce defence nor opted to be

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
examined on oath as provided under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. Learned
trial Court after hearing arguments of learned counsel for the
parties, vide impugned judgment dated 07.05.2019 convicted and
sentenced the accused/ appellant as mentioned above. Feeling
aggrieved the convict/ appellant filed instant criminal appeal, while
the complainant filed criminal revision petition for enhancement of
sentence. Both are going to be decided through the instant common
judgment.

5. We have heard learned counsels for the parties as well
as learned A.A.G representing the state at length and have gone
through the evidence available on record carefully.

6. The incident occurred on 08.08.2009, where the
deceased namely Junaid was done to death by receiving firearm
injuries. The matter was reported by the complainant Jehanzeb
Khan, who was examined as PW-4, and the report was entered by
PW-7, Muhammad Rahim SI in the KDA Hospital, Karak. In the
report the complainant explained that he alongwith deceased Junaid
and PW Hanifullah were sitting in the shadow of a tree in their field

for looking after, when in the meanwhile the accused/ appellant

*“Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice tkramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah,
appeared and started indiscriminate firing which resulted into the
death of the deceased, where they luckily escaped unhurt by lying
down on the ground. The incident occurred at 11.45 a.m. whereas
the matter was reported to the local police at 12.30 p.m with an
abnormal delay of two hours. The witnesses tried their level best to
condone the delay by advancing several explanations and they
stated that the delay occurred as the house of the enemies were in
close proximity so in order to avoid an untoward incident they
adopted different routes to reach to the hospital, if their stance is
taken to be correct, we find ourselves with disagreement that a
father would rush his son to the hospital even at the cost of his life
without fail, with utmost promptitude to save the life of his son. The
presence of witnesses is doubtful at the place of occurrence, because
one of the witness i.e. the complainant was a professor and PW
Hanifullah was a teacher by profession and their presence in such
scorching heat in the shadow of a Keeker tree does not appeal to a
prudent mind. The purpose of their presence is after thought and
surprised us that on one hand the land in which they were sitting

was barren and on the other it was fenced with a barbed wire and

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
already protected, so the reason for look after was unfounded and
had it been so then the two elderly persons instead of themselves to
stop stray goats, sheep etc would depute a servant / tenant or any
young person of the family. The overall situation leads us nowhere
but to hold that the deceased was all alone at the time when he was
done to death and none witnessed the occurrence. The complainant
and PW Hamidullah were in total conflict with each other as one
stated that they were chatting with one another, when in the
meanwhile the accused/ appellant appeared and warned them of
their presence in the spot field and thereafter started firing, which
resulted into the death of the deceased, had this been so, then the
witnesses were sitting in close proximity with the deceased and a
burst fire would have definitely hit them and there were no chances
of escape. If the statement of the witness to the extent of talking to
one another and the warning from the accused is taken to be correct
then the deceased was facing the accused so the injuries on the back
of his skull without exit on front finds no support. The presence of
the witnesses was further doubted when a question was put that

whether in routine they used to look after the fields, their reply was

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
an emphatic “NO”, so it can easily be held that the witnesses are

chance and interested. In case titled, “Mst. Anwar Begum Vs

Akhtar Hussain alias Kaka and 2 others” (2017 SCMR 1710),

wherein it is held that:-

“Both the witnesses of ocular account are
chance witnesses and had no residence or
place of business near the place of
occurrence. Ghulam Jaffar (PW3) in his
cross-examination stated that by chance he
came at the spot 2/3 minutes prior to 8.00
p.m. The Investigating Officer (PW.11) was
cross-examined on this aspect of the case

and he candidly stated during his cross-

examination that the shops or house of the
eye witnesses had not been shown in the
site plan. He further stated that he had not
seen the house of the complainant. He also
stated that he had not seen the house of the
other eye-witness. It is well settled by now
that in order to maintain conviction of a
convict on capital charge on the basis of
testimony of chance witnesses the court has
to be at guard and corroboration is to be
sought for relying upon any such evidence.
But no corroboration is available in this
case.”

7. The presence of the witnesses on the spot further

disturbs the mind of this Court when the complainant stated that

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah,
NG

after receiving firearm injuries the deceased fell to the ground and
PW Hanifullah took him in his lap and he himself went to arrange a
vehicle for shifting the deceased then injured to the hospital and the
complainant further stated that when he reached to the spot after
arranging the vehicle the blood had stopped oozing as sufficient
time had elapsed, he further stated that he shifted the deceased then
injured to vehicle but when PW Hanifullah was examined, he stated
that the deceased then injured was lying on the ground and that he
never took him in his lap, if we take it correct that Hanifullah was
holding the deceased in his lap then why his clothes and hands were
not besmeared with blood and so that of the complainant. The
witnesses went pole a part on taking the deceased to the hospital, the
witnesses were specifically questioned that numerous police stations
and police post Ahmad Abad was lying on the way, and that why
they did not take the dead-body to the Police Station to report the
matter despite the fact that the deceased had already succumbed to
his injuries that too within ten (10) minutes after receiving the fire
shots but no plausible explanation was given. The witnesses are not

in harmony with one another and who reported, where reported is

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
shrouded in mystery and no one was ready to give straight forward
explanation rather every one tried his level best to twist and conceal
the facts. The KDA hospital Karak admittedly has its own reporting
center but surprisingly the complainant stated that when he reached
no one from the police was present in the hospital and when the
scribe was examined he stated that being on routine gusht he was
informed by the Moharrir to reach the hospital, as a dead-body was
lying there. The scribe was questioned that why the report was not
made to the incharge Reporting Center in KDA hospital as the
purpose of the center was to enter medico legal cases, he replied that
the incharge was not available, so he rushed to pen down the matter,
his this explanation presents him an interested witness as he too
with the complainant was trying to cover the delay. The overall
situation indicate that the dead-body was brought by the co-villagers
and later on an attempt was made to procure the complainant being
father to report and to implicate the people of his choice. Neither the
complainant nor the eyewitness are shown as identifiers, both before
the police when the inquest report was prepared and before the

Doctor at the time of postmortem examination, so this reflects that

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah,
10

in fact it was a blind murder. The case is one of preliminary
investigation, as first the deceased was examined, documents
prepared and when the complainant was procured the report was
made. The conduct of PW Hamidullah tells a lot regarding the
veracity of this witness, when he stated that on the way the
complainant asked him to get down and inform the villagers
regarding the incident and to make further arrangements, the
situation was so tense that none of the witness had the leisure time
to think for arrangements in fact their target should have been either
the hospital or Police Station.

8. The investigating officer was examined as PW08 and
he stated that after receipt of the copy of the F.I.R he visited the spot
and on the pointation of the complainant and PW Hamidullah
recovered 15 empties of 7.62 bore alongwith blood stained earth and
prepared the site-plan, this witness stated that he reached to the spot
from the Police Station within 30 minutes, so we are surprised that
why the complainant took two hours to reach to the hospital. In fact,
there was no need to go to the hospital, as the deceased then injured

had already died and the police post and Police Station falling on the

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
11

way were not touched, so it cast an impression that in fact
preliminary investigation was conducted in the case. Even the
presence of the identifiers in the hospital keeps us on guard that how
they reached the hospital, when the complainant had not asked
anybody to accompany and even till that time no information was
conveyed to the village. The empties recovered from the spot, were
sent to the F.S.L where it was opined that all the empties were fired
from one weapon but this alone was not sufficient to single out the
accused to have committed the offence, when other evidence

miserably failed to connect. In case titled, “Muhammad Rafiq alias

Feega Vs The State (2019 SCMR 1068), wherein it is held that:

“In such circumstances, the most natural
inference would be that the delay so
caused was for preliminary investigation
and prior consultation to nominate the
accused and plant eye-witnesses of the
crime. In similar circumstances, this
Court, in the case of Irshad Ahmad v. The
State (2011 SCMR 1190), observed that
the noticeable delay in post mortem
examination of the dead body is generally
suggestive of a real possibility that time
had been consumed by the police in

procuring and planting eye-witnesses

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
12

before preparing police papers necessary

for the same.”

9. The learned counsel for the prosecution stressed
time and again that the accused/ appellant had strong motive to
commit the offence, but he went in error as the prosecution
could prove the motive and nothing was brought in black and
white which was the urging factor for the accused/ appellant to
commit the murder of the deceased and if this was so then
instead of deceased the father i.e. the complainant would have
been the prime target. The superior Courts of the country are
consistent in their approach that when motive was alleged the
prosecution was duty bound to prove the same, failing which the
prosecution will suffer. In case titled “Muhammad Ashraf alias

acchu Vs the State” (2019 SCMR 652), wherein it is held that:

“The motive is always a double-edged weapon.
The complainant Sultan Ahmad (PW9) has
admitted murder enmity between the parties
and has also given details of the same in his
statement recorded before the trial court. No
doubt, previous enmity can be a reason for the
appellant to commit the alleged crime, but it

can equally be a reason for the complainant

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadultah.
13

side to falsely implicate the appellant in this

case for previous grouse.”

10. Though the stress of the learned counsel
representing the complainant was that the accused/ appellant
soon after the occurrence absconded and to him the abscondence
is a sufficient indicator towards guilt of the accused, we are
unable to understand that how in absence of positive and
convincing evidence the abscondence alone can lead to
conviction and if we accede to the submissions so forwarded, we
are afraid of drastic results. There is no cavil to the preposition
that abscondence alone cannot be a substitute, of the direct
evidence and this aspect has been beautifully dealt with by the

apex Court in case titled, “Muhammad Sadiq Vs _the State”

(2017 SCMR 144), wherein it is held that:

“The fact that the appellant absconded
and was not traceable for considerably
long period of time could also not be made
sole basis for his conviction when the
other evidence of the prosecution is
doubtful as it is riddled with

contradictions.”

*Azam/P.S* (D.B )} MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.

11. Be that as it may, the prosecution failed to convince
this court that it was non-else but accused who killed the

deceased.

12. After thoroughly evaluating the evidence available
on file this court reaches to an inescapable conclusion that the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case against
accused/appellant. Resultantly, this appeal is, therefore, allowed,
the conviction and sentence of the appellant recorded by the
learned trial court is set-aside and he is acquitted of the charge
by extending him the benefit of doubt, he shall be released forth
with from jail, if not required to be detained in connection with
any other case. So far as the connected Criminal Revision

No.40-B/2019 is concerned, the same stands dismissed.

Above are the reasons of our short order of the even date.
