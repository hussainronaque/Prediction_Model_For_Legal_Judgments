2. The learned Trial Court has sent Murder Reference
No.05 of 2022, for confirmation of death sentence of the convict.

3. Since, both the matters are the outcome of one and the
same judgment dated 09.06.2022 of the learned Trial Court,
therefore, we propose to decide and answer the same through this
common judgment.

4. The prosecution’s case as unfolded in the First
Information Report (“FIR”) Exh.PA is that on 05.08:2020 at 1945
hours, complainant Khan (PW.3), present with the dead bodies of
his son, namely, Imran and one Mujahid son of Arsala Khan in the
casualty of Qazi Hussain Ahmad Hospital Nowshera Kalan,
reported to Usman Ghani SI (PW.1), to the effect that on
05.0%:2020 both the deceased had gone to attend the engagement
ceremony of Munir Khan. He was present in his house when
received information about murder of both the deceased in the
Baithak of Nowsher Khan, situated in village Zando and that their
dead bodies are lying at the spot. On the said information, he
reached the spot and noticed the dead bodies of his son Imran and
Mujahid deceased. He came to know that the deceased have been
done to death by Mumtaz (appellant) with firearm. The occurrence

is stated to have been witnessed by Nosheri Khan (PW.4) and Zain
Ullah (PW.5). He did not disclose motive behind the occurrence.
His report was recorded in the shape of Murasila Exh.PA/1 by
Usman Ghani SI (PW.1), which verified by Shamsher. Usman
Ghani SI (PW.1) prepared injury sheets and inquest reports of both
the deceased Exh.PW.1/1 to Exh.PW.1/4, respectively and shifted
their dead bodies to the mortuary for postmortem examination.

5. On 05.02.2020 at about 07.20 PM, Dr. Ansaar Ahmed

6. Dilaram Khan SI conducted investigation in the case,
who on receipt of copy of FIR, proceeded to the spot and prepared
site pan Exh.PW.11/2 on the pointation of eye witnesses Nosher
Khan and Zainullah. During spot inspection, he secured blood with
the help of cotton from the places of the deceased vide recovery
memo Exh.PW.8/1, 07 empties of 30 bore pistol from the place of
the appellant vide recovery memo Exh.PW.8/2, an electric energy
saver bulb vide recovery memo Exh.PW.8/3 and the last worn
bloodstained garments of the deceased vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.7/1. During trial of the appellant, PW Dilaram SI was dead
therefore, documents prepared by him during investigation were
verified and exhibited through the statement of Arshad Ahmad
SDPO (PW.11).

7. On 21.07.2020 after rejection of his BBA, appellant was
arrested by Muhammad Kashif SI (PW.10) who on the pointation of
the appellant on 26.09.2020 recovered a 30 bore Pistol without
number from a wooden cupboard. The appellant disclosed the same
to be a crime weapon. To this effect he prepare sketch of the place
of pointation as Exh.PB.1 and took the pistol into possession
through vide memo Exh.PW.2/1 in presence of its marginal
witnesses and drafted Parwana for addition of section 15 KP Arms
Act, in the FIR. On completion of investigation, he handed over
case file to the SHO who submitted challan against the appellant

before the learned trial court.
8. On receipt of challan, the learned trial court summoned
the appellant from Jail and formally charge sheeted him under
section 302 PPC and section 15 KP Arms Act 2013 to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To prove its case, the
prosecution examined as many as fourteen witnesses. After closure
of the prosecution’s evidence, statement of the appellant was
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein he denied the
prosecution’s allegation and professed his innocence. He, however,
neither wished to be examined on oath under section 340 (2)
Cr.P.C. nor opted to produce evidence in defence. On conclusion of
trial, the learned trial court after hearing both the sides convicted
and sentenced the appellant as mentioned in the initial part of the
judgment, hence, this appeal by the appellant and Murder Reference
by the learned Trial Court.

9. We have heard the exhaustive submissions of learned
counsel for the parties advanced at the bar and perused the record
and evidence with their valuable assistance.

10. In this case two persons, namely, Imran and Mujahid
deceased have been done to death with firearms for which
complainant Khan (PW.3) has directly and singularly charged
appellant Mumtaz. As per FIR, the incident has taken place on
05.03.2020 at 1815 hours (06.15 PM) inside the Baithak of one
Nosher Khan, situated in village Zando Nowshera, which has been
reported by complainant Khan (PW.3) in the casualty of Qazi
Hussain Ahmad hospital Nowshera Kalan at 1945 hours

(07.45 PM). As per version of complainant on 05.03.3030 his son
~

Imran along with one Mujahid had gone to attend the engagement

ceremony of Munir Khan. He was pregent in his house when

received information qua murder of Imran and Mujahid deceased in
the Baithak of Nosher Khan. On the said {nformation he rushed to
the spot and noticed his son Imran and Mujahid deceased lying
murdered there. He disclosed that he c: to know that both the
deceased have been done to death by Mumtaz (appellant) with
firearm and the occurrence is witnessed by Nosheri Khan (PW.4)
and Zain Ullah (PW.5). He disclosed that he does not know about
the motive behind the occurrence. He While appearing in the
witness box as PW.2 reiterated the same stdry as set forth by him in
the FIR. Bare reading of initial report,| rather admittedly, the
complainant is not an eyewitness of the odcurrence. Neither in his
report Exh.PA/1 nor in his examination-intchief he could disclose
the name of person who conveyed the information of incident to
him. He has not stated that any one from the alleged eyewitnesses,
namely, Nosheri Khan and Zain Ullah ipformed him about the
incident. His report has not been signed/thumb impressed by any of

the alleged eyewitnesses as its verifier. imilatly, none from the

alleged eyewitnesses is verifier of the “i bodies of the deceased.
Contradicting his own version, compldinant Khan in cross-

examination has stated that he was inforthed by PW Zain Ullah

through mobile cell phone, however, he has neither disclosed his

own cell phone number nor the cell phone number of PW Zain
Ullah in his report and court staterhent so much so the

Investigation officer has not made any effort to collect the cell
}!

phone number of the above mentioned witness what to say of call
data record “CDR”. He has stated that he along with other persons
including PWs Zain Ullah and Nosher picked up the dead bodies of
the deceased from the ground to the cots and thereafter shifted to
the vehicles and in the said process his hands and clothes as well as
the hands and clothes of PWs Nosher and Zain Ullah were smeared
with the blood of the deceased. He further stated that they along
with dead bodies reached hospital at 07.30 PM and at the same time
his report was recorded while the doctor started Postmortem
examination on the dead bodies of the deceased which took about
15/20 minutes or more. In his report Exh.PA/1 and statement as
PW.2, complainant has not furnished any explanation as to why the
incident was not reported by the alleged eyewitnesses, namely,
Zainullah and Nosher Khan when according both of them were
present with him in the hospital, however, answer and explanation
to the said query can be find in the statement of Usman Ghani SI
(PW.1), author of the Murasila Exh.PA/I1, who in cross-
examination has stated that “had eyewitnesses, namely, Nosher
and Zain Ullah been present in the hospital, he would have
endorsed the report of complainant from them”. Contrary the
complainant in cross-examination has categorically stated that at
the time of report both the eyewitnesses were present with him. As
stated earlier none from the alleged eyewitnesses has either reported
the occurrence or have verified report of the complainant or
identified the dead bodies of the deceased before the police and

doctor, therefore, this aspect of the prosecution’s case create serious
8

doubt in a prudent mind about presence of the alleged eyewitnesses
at the spot, particularly, at the time of occurrence. Another
disturbing aspect of the prosecution case is that in the report
Exh.PA/1 the time of occurrence is shown as 1845 hours (06.15
PM) and time of report as 1945 hours (07.45 PM), but as per
statement of Dr. Ansaar Ahmed, he conducted autopsy on the dead
body of Mujahid deceased on 05.03.2020 at 07.20 PM and on the
dead body of Imran deceased on the same day at 07.24 P.M. The
time of postmortem of both the deceased falls before the timing of
report i.e. 07.45 PM. Nosheri Khan the alleged eyewitness has
further disputed the said timing by stating that they along with dead
bodies of the deceased reached the hospital at about 06.00 PM,
whereas 06.15 is the time of occurrence. The above disclosed
contradictions in the statements of the complainant and eyewitness
Nosheri Khan cast serious doubts in the prosecution’s case.

11. Nosheri Khan while appearing as PW.4 deposed that on
05.02.2020 there was engagement ceremony of son of Munir Khan
and in this respect he along with others went to village Gedar
Gumbat Mardan. On the way to Gedar Gumbat, deceased Imran
and accused Mumtaz were making over takes each other by their
motorcar; as a result, there was an altercation between them at
Gedar Gumbt. When they returned back to village and people
dispersed, PW Zain Ullah and accused Mumtaz were present out
outside Baithak while he along with deceased Imran and Mujahid
was present inside the Baithak. In the meanwhile, all of a sudden

accused took out his pistol and started firing on Imran and Mujahid
9

deceased with which both got hit and died on the spot while the
accused decamped from the spot in a black motorcar No.6600.
According to him, the complainant was informed by PW Zain
Ullah, however, PW Zain Ullah while appearing as PW.5 has kept
mum about conveying information to the complainant. He further
stated that site plan was prepared at his instance.

12, In report Exh.PA/1 complainant Khan (PW.3) has not
disclosed that he does not know about the motive behind the
occurrence. Had PW Nosheri Khan present at the spot at the time of
occurrence and present at the time of making report by the
complainant, he would have disclosed the motive to the
complainant and the latter would have mentioned the same in his
very initial report. In cross-examination, PW Nosher Khan has
stated that his hands and clothes were smeared with the blood of the
deceased, but no such clothes have been taken into possession by
the Investigating Officer or produced by PW Nosheri Khan to the
1.0.. He has not disclosed the reasons and circumstances which
prevent him from making report. He while further contradicting the
prosecution’s case stated that it was about 07.30 PM when they
reached to village from the hospital whereas 07.45 PM is the time
of report. If at 7.30 PM they returned to village from hospital then
making report by complainant at 07.45 PM is beyond the
comprehension of a prudent mind. In the site plan distance between
the Imran deceased and appellant is shown as 18 paces and between
Mujahid deceased and appellant as 19 paces. As per postmortem

reports, injuries sustained by both the deceased were having
gl

10

charring marks. Causing of charring marks from a distance of 18
and 19 paces by the deceased is solid and sufficient proof to prove
that alleged eyewitnesses were not present at the spot at the time of
occurrence. In this view of the matter, medical evidence contradicts
the site plan prepared on the pointation of the alleged eyewitnesses.
PW Nosheri Khan in cross-examination has further stated that
distance between the house of complainant and Spot can be covered
in 8/10 minutes and same is the distance of the house of PW Zain
Ullah from the spot. He had not shown the spot of overtake and
altercation between the appellant and the deceased to the 1.0. On
reappraisal of testimony of PW Nosheri Khan we are of the
considered view to hold that he was not present at the spot at the
time of occurrence as he has miserably failed to establish his
presence at the spot through some strong physical circumstances of
the occurrence. He has not disclosed the registration number of the
motorcar/vehicle of the deceased. Similarly, no driving license in
the name of any of the two deceased has been taken into possession
by the I.O. in support of the version of the alleged eyewitness. In
this view of the matter, the learned trial court has erred in law while
relying upon the testimony of Nosher Khan which is pregnant with
doubts and suffering from material contradictions shattering the
entire edifice of the prosecution’s case.

13. Another eyewitness Zain Ullah has appeared in the
witness box as PW.5. He deposed that on 05.02.2020 he along with
his uncle Mujahid deceased participated in the engagement

ceremony of Munir Khan and were going to village Gedar Gumbt
1H

Mardan. On the way to Gedar Gumbat deceased Imran and accused
facing trail Mumtaz were making over takes over each other on
which an altercation took place between them. Mujahid and Imran
deceased were present inside the baithak with Nosheri Khan inside
the room whereas he and accused Mumtaz were present outside the
Baithak. All of sudden the accused took out his pistol and started
firing at the deceased with which the deceased got hit and died.
Accused made his escape good from the spot in a black colour
motorcar. In cross-examination he stated that after the occurrence
complainant reached the spot in a motorcar whereas according to
complainant he had reached the spot on his foot. He stated that his
hands and clothes were smeared with the blood of the deceased but
he has not handed over his clothes to the 1.0. Similarly, he had also
not shown his hands to the I.0. That it was about 07.30 P.M. when
they reached the hospital along with dead body. In post mortem
reports the time of autopsy on the dead bodies of the deceased has
been shown as 07.20 PM and 7.24 PM. He further stated that as
soon as they reached the hospital the police came to the hospital.
Contrary, PW Nosheri Khan has stated that when they reached the
hospital the police was already present in the hospital. He while
further contradicting the statement of Nowsheri Khan stated that it
was about 9.00 PM when they reached their village. He while
contradicting the site plan stated that bulb was installed outside the
baithak and at the time of taking the same into possession PW

Nosheri Khan was present at the spot. Contrary, PW Nosheri Khan
12

has stated that at the time of taking the bulb by the LO. into
possession he was not present at the spot.

14. On reappraisal of testimony of this witness we have
reached to an irresistible conclusion that he too is a procured
witness and was not present at the spot at the time of occurrence.
The learned trial court has thus erred in law while believing his
statement.

15. Recovery of blood from the spot from the places of the
deceased their last worn bloodstained garments and positive
Serologist report in respect thereof coupled with medical evidence
proves the unnatural death of the two deceased due to firearm
injuries, however, these pieces of circumstantial evidence without
direct evidence are not sufficient to tell the name of the killer(s).
Such corroborative pieces of circumstantial evidence are always
taken into consideration in aid of direct evidence. In this case, we
have disbelieved the direct evidence therefore such pieces of
evidence would not advance the prosecution’s case.

16. So far as recovery of 30 bore pistol without number
allegedly shown recovered on pointation of the appellant is
concerned, record shows that the same along with 07 empties
recovered from the spot was sent to the FSL and as per FSL report
Exh.PK/2, the empties have been fired from the said pistol. Record
depicts that the said pistol is without number. Its recovery has been
shown from a wooden cupboard from the house of the appellant.
No evidence with regard to ownership of the said house has been

brought on record. Besides, the empties have been shown sent to
13

the FSL after recovery of the 30 bore pistol on 07.02.2020. In case
titled Ghulam Akbar and another Vs. The State (2008 SCMR-
1064), it has been observed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court that law
requires that empty recovered from the spot should be sent to the
laboratory without any delay, failing which such recovery evidence
would not be free from doubt and could not be used against the
accused. Again in the case of Jehangir Vs. Nazer Farid and
another (2002 SCMR-1986), the receipt of crime empties in the
Forensic Science Laboratory after seven days was not only
condemned but it was treated as of no assistance to the prosecution
or for that matter against the accused. Reliance is also placed on a

case law titled “Muhammad Younus Khan Vs. The State” (1992
SCMR-545). It was also observed in the case of Attaullah and

others Vs. The State (PLD 1990 Peshawar-10), that the crime
empties should be immediately dispatched to Arms Expert and
should not be kept by the Investigating Officer because in that case
objection regarding manipulation of recovery will hold good. It is,
by now, well established proposition of law that if the crime empty
is sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory after the arrest of the
accused or together with the crime weapon, the positive report of
the said Laboratory loses its significance and evidentiary value.
Reliance in this respect is placed on the case of “Jehangir vs.
Nazar Farid_and_ another” (2002 SCMR_ 1986), “Israr_Ali_vs.
The State” (2007 SCMR 525) and “Ali Sher and others vs. The
State” (2008 SCMR 707).
of!

14

17. Besides, when we have already disbelieved the ocular
account, such recovery would not be sufficient for recording
conviction of accused in capital charge, because this type of
corroborative pieces of evidence are always taken into
consideration along with direct evidence. In case titled, “Noor
Muhammad Vs the State and another” (2010 SCMR 97), it has
been held by the august Supreme Court that recovery of crime
empty or rifle with matching report of FSL is a corroborative piece
of evidence, which by itself is not sufficient for conviction of the
accused in absence of substantive evidence.

18. No doubt, appellant is directly and singularly charged for
murder of two deceased and substitution of accused in such like
cases is a rare phenomenon, however, the law in this regard has
been settled by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled, “Dr.
Israr ul Haq vs Muhammad Fayyaz and another” (2007 SCMR
1427), that such phenomenon depends and varies from case to case.
It is settled principle of law that for recording conviction strong and
corroborative evidence of unimpeachable character is required and
that findings of guilt against accused must not be based on
probabilities to be inferred from evidence, rather, must rest surely
and firmly on the evidence of unimpeachable character, otherwise,
the golden rule of benefit of doubt would be reduced to naught. It is
also settled principle of law that a witness who claims to be the
eyewitness of the occurrence, must prove his presence at the spot at
the time of occurrence and shall satisfy mind of the Court qua his

presence through some physical circumstances or corroborative
15

evidence. We are also mindful of the dictum laid down by the
Hon’ble apex Court in case titled, “Mst. Sughra Begum and
another vs Qaisar Pervez and others” (2015 SCMR 1142), that
ocular account in cases of Qatl-e-amd plays a decisive and vital role
and once its intrinsic worth is accepted and believed then rest of the
evidence, both circumstantial and corroborative, will be required as

a matter of caution. To the contrary, once the ocular account was

disbelieved then no other evidence, even of a high degree and
value, will be sufficient for recording conviction on a capital
charge, therefore, probative value of the ocular account has to be
seen in light of the facts and circumstances of each case.

19. It is established law that prosecution is duty bound to
prove its case against the accused beyond any reasonable doubt
and if any single doubt arises, benefit of the same must be given to
accused as the accused is always considered a most favourable
child of law. Guidance in this regard can be derived from case
titled, “Tariq Pervaz Vs the State” (1995 SCMR 1345) and case
titled, “Muhammad Akram Vs the State (2009 SCMR 230) and
Faryad Alis case (2008 SCMR 1086).

20. The learned Trial Court has not appreicated the evidence
available on record in its true perspective, thus, has arrived at an
erroneous conclusion by holding the appellant guilty of the
offence, hence, the impugned judgment is not sustainable, as such,
is liable to be set aside. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed. The
impugned judgment along with conviction and sentences of the

appellant recorded therein are hereby set aside and the appellant is
16

acquitted of the charge leveled against him. He be set at liberty
forthwith, if not wanted to be detained in any other case.

21. On acquittal of the appellant-convict, the Murder

Reference _No.015 of 2022, sent by the learned Trial Court, is

answered in the Negative,
22. These are the reasons of our short order of even date,

which is reproduced below:-
