Advocate for accused/respondeni and Ayesha Nayah

Respondent (8) ..

Muhammad

irshad, petitioner/complainant, is seeking

a
cancellation of bail

granted to accused/
respondent No.2, Shah Nawaz, vide

impugned order dated 24.05.2014, by the
learned Additional Sessions  Judge-ll,

Mansehra,in case against him under Section

302 PPC vide FIR No.164 registered in Police

on 27.05.2003. The

Shinkiari

Station

impugned order dated 24.05.2014 would
show that the accused/respondent No.2 was
released on post arrest bail only on medical
ground.

2. In the FIR lodged by the complainant in
the police station at 03:30 hours on
27.05.2003, the accused/respondent was the
single accused nominated for the Qatl-i-Amd
of nephew of the complainant, deceased
Jabir, by firing at the deceased with his 12
bore shotgun. The motive for the offence was
cited as dispute between the deceased and
the accused/respondent over some money
transaction. The accused/ respondent
remained at large and was proceeded against
under sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C, and
challan was submitted against him under
section 512 Cr.P.C on 07.07.2003, leading to
proceedings against him under the aforesaid
provisions of law, resulting in his declaration

as a proclaimed offender, vide order of the
wep

learned trial Court/Additional Sessions Judge,
Mansehra dated 10.05.2007. The
accused/respondent was arrested by the local
police of Police Station Shahdarah, Lahore, on
31.01.2014, and formally arrested in the case
on 01.02.2014. After his arrest in the case, a
12 bore shotgun was taken into possession
by the |1O as weapon of offence, allegedly,
handed over by the accused/respondent to
the 1.0, which was found in working condition
by the Firearms Expert. After completion of
investigation, the local police submitted
supplementary . challan against the
accused/respondent on 07.02.2014,
whereupon cognizance has been taken by
the learned trial Couri/Additional Sessions
Judge-ll, Mansehra, and charge framed
against the accused/respondent on
29.02.2014.

3. The accused/respondent, after the trial

Court had taken cognizance in the case,
moved application for his release on bail,
mainly, on medical ground on 22.03.2014,
claiming therein that he was diabetic and also
suffering from heart disease, which were not
curable in jail, lacking treatment facilities. On ©
the application of the accused/respondent,
the M.S of AMC, Abbottabad, was directed by
the learned trial Court/Additional Sessions
Judge-ll, Mansehra, vide his order dated
44.04.2014, to constitute medical board
comprising a heart specialist and submit
report of the medical board; but report of the
Standing Medical Board, received in the
Court, was found incomplete, therefore, the
Medical Board was once again directed to
submit a definite report about the disease or
the accused, with further direction to mention
whether the disease of the accused was
dangerous to his life and whether treatment of .
the accused could be arranged in the jail

hospital or otherwise.
wa

4. The fresh report of the Medical Board
dated 22.05.2014, which formed basis for the
impugned order dated 24.05.2014, was to the
following effect:- |

‘

“Medical record of Mr. Shah
Nawaz was reviewed. Mr. Shah
Nawaz recently underwent
coronary angiography in Ayub
Teaching Hospital, Abbottabad.
The findings of Coronary
angiography suggest 3 vessel
coronary artery disease (3VD)
and Mr. Shah Nawaz has been
advised CABG (Coronary artery
bypass graft) by our
cardiologist.”

The learned trial Court/Additional Sessions
Judge-ll, Mansehra, on the basis of the above
report, held that the accused/respondent was
a serious heart patient and known diabetic
and had a right of treatment from a
doctor/hospital of his own choice. The
learned Additional Sessions Judge further
held that ailment of the accused/respondent

was dangerous to his life.
6

5. Arguments of learned counsel for the
petitioner/complainant, learned State counsel
and learned . counsel for the
accused/respondent heard, and_ record
perused.

6. It may be observed at the very outset
that the léarned -Additional Sessions Judge
has dealt with the bail petition in a slipshod
and cursory manner as he totally overlooked
the other material and relevant aspects of the
case such as serious charge of Qati/-i-Amd
against the accused/respondent and his
remaining fugitive from law for more than 4
decade before his arrest in Lahore on
31.01.2014. Besides, the accused/respondent
had also claimed bail on merits while
furnishing some explanation for his
absconsion in his application for bail dated
21.03.2014.

7. Apart from direct charge for broad day

light Qatl-i-Amd of the deceased only against

the accused/respondent and his prolonged
absconsion, stretching over more than ten
years, the accused/respondent also did not
qualify for release on bail on medical ground
for the simple reason that even in the report
of the Standing Medical Board, it was
nowhere mentioned that the twin ailments. of
the accused/respondent, namely, diabetes
and cardiac problem posed danger to his life,

rather the medical board suggested/advised

the treatment facility was not available in
ATH, Abbottabad, or the accused/respondent
required specialized treatment elsewhere.
Needless to say that treatment for diabeles is
available everywhere, even in jail, and even
management of diabetes for undertaking the
procedure suggested by the Standing Medical

Board are available in each and every

hospital, let alone ATH, Abbottabad.

Notwithstanding the fact that no record of
treatment or any procedure for such a
‘serious’ heart ailment was available prior to
arrest of accused/respondent and his
application for post arrest bail, even during
the period of his absconsion for more than ten
years, the record is also silent about any
treatment or ‘CABG by the accused/
respondent till date after his release on bail
on 24.05.2014, and even today the learned
counsel for the accused/respondent was
unable to show any step on the part of the
accused/respondent for treatment of his so-
called three vessels coronary artery disease
(3 VD).

8. Therefore, the only conclusion which
one can draw from the conduct of the
accused/ respondent is that the medical
ground was coined by him only to get himself
released from the jail which, indeed, was

facilitated by the Court while taking no pain to
also take into consideration the other
attending circumstances of the case,
disentitling the accused/respondent to the
concession of bail. In short, the impugned
order is arbitrary, perverse and capricious,
calling for interference by this Court. (2010
SCMIR 576, 2010 SCMR 605, 1998 P.Cr.L.J
763, 2010 P.Cr.L.J 921 and 2014 P.Cr.L.J
1526).

3. It may, however, be observed that trial
in the case has commenced, therefore, the
learned trial Court is expected to strive for
early conclusion of the trial; and at the same
time, the jail authorities are directed to make
arrangements, © whenever required, for
treatment/medical facilities to the
accused/respondent in the jail as well as in
ATH, Abbottabad, where the requisite
medical/treatment facilities for the heart

ailment of the accused/respondent are
10

available, according to the report of the
Standing Medical Board.

10. Consequently, the application is
accepted and by setting aside the impugned
order dated 24.05.2014, the post arrest bail
granted to accused/ respondent is hereby
cancelled/recalled. Accused/respondent be
taken into custody and produced before the

trial Court.
