UDGMENT

MUSARRAT HILALL, J.- Through the instant criminal

revision petition filed under Section 435/439 Cr.P.C read

with Section 561-A Cr.P.C, petitioner, Riaz, has prayed

for setting aside the orders dated 03.08.2021 &

08.04.2021 of learned Additional Sessions Judge-VI,

Peshawar.

2. Briefly stated facts of the case are that the

petitioner is an accused in case FIR No.594 dated

22.12.2015, registered under section 302/324/34 PPC, at

Police Station East Cantt., District Peshawar and is

behind the bars since his arrest and facing trial. During

his trial, one official witness namely, Muhammad
Ishaque (PW-9) was declared as hostile witness during

the cross examination without hearing the parties on legal

aspect of the case and without going to the previous

statement, hence, the instant revision petition.

Arguments heard and record gone through.

3. On perusal of the impugned order dated

03.08.2021, it appears that Additional Public Prosecutor

made an oral request to declare the witness namely,

Muhammad Ishaque as hostile on the ground that he, in

his cross examination, stated certain things which are

contrary to what he has deposed in his examination-in-

chief.

4. Before proceeding further, it would be

appropriate to first see whether the witness was hostile or

unfavourable to the party who called him as there is a

distinction between a hostile witness and an unfavourable

witness.

A hostile witness is one who, from the manner in

which he gives his evidence shows that he is not telling

the truth and resiles from his earlier statement given
during investigation and damages the case of the calling

party while an unfavourable witness is one who without

any hostile intention gives evidence which is contrary to

the interest of the prosecution.

5. Cross examination is a valuable right of an

accused to test the veracity and accuracy of a prosecution

witness’s evidence given in the examination-in-chief and

to elicit from the witness any fact which may be

favourable to the accused. A witness can be allowed to be

treated as hostile only during examination-in-chief and

not after he was cross examined by the other party. If the

opportunity of cross examination of his own witness in

such like cases is given, it would destroy the very

purpose of cross examination. No doubt, under Article

150 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, the

prosecution has the right to request the trial Court for

declaring a witness as hostile if the witness resiles from

his previous statement recorded during investigation or

any other proceedings, however, the Court shall not

exercise its discretion of declaring a witness hostile

unless the Court is satisfied that the elements of hostility
are exhibited during examination-in-chief or the witness

is not speaking truth for the party he is deposing and his

design is obvious then the Court by using its judicial

discretion can permit cross examination of the said

witness. It may not be out of place to mention here that

the testimony of a hostile witness is not totally washed

out from the record of the case and that part of the

statement of the witness which corroborates the

prosecution version can still be taken into consideration.

6. In the instant case, the prosecution witness

in an unguarded moment deposed something which is

unfavourable to the prosecution, however, no such

material exists on the record showing that the witness

was deliberately suppressing the truth or has changed his

loyalty and the intention was clear, in absence of all these

circumstances, the discretion to allow the party to

reexamine his own witness cannot be allowed.

7. As far as the specimen handwriting of PW-6

is concerned, it would be appropriate to reproduce Article

84 (1) (2) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 which

reads as under:-
84. Comparison of signature, writing or seal
with others admitted or proved: (1) In order to
ascertain whether a signature, writing or seal is
that of the person by whom it purports to have
been written or made any signature writing or
seal admitted or proved to the satisfaction of the
Court to have been written or made by that person
may be compared with the one which is to be
proved, although that signature, writing or seal
has not been produced or proved for any other
purpose.

(2) The Court may direct any person present in
Court to write any words or figures for the
purpose of enabling the Court to compare the
words or figures so written with any words or
figures alleged to have been written by such
person.

8. The aforementioned quoted Article

empowers the Court to obtain signature, writing or seal

of the person by whom it purports to have been written or

made any signature writing or seal for the satisfaction of

the Court just to arrive at right conclusion because a fair

trial includes a fair opportunity to produce any defence to

prove his innocence.

9. In view of the above, this petition is

allowed, the order of the learned trial Court dated

08.04.2021 is set aside.
