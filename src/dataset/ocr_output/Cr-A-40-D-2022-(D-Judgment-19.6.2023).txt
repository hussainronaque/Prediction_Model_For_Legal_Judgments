AK

DR. KHURSHID IOBAL, J.- This judgment shall
also dispose of the Criminal Revision No.03-D of
2022, as both the matters are the outcome of one and
the same judgment dated 15.9.2022, rendered by
learned Additional Sessions Judge-III, D.[.Khan,
whereby the appellant has been convicted under
section 302(b) PPC for committing qatl-i-amd of
Khursheed Ahmad and sentenced to imprisonment for
life and held liable to pay Rs.4,00,000/- as
compensation to the legal heirs of deceased in terms
of Section 544-A, Cr.P.C. or in default thereof to

undergo six months simple imprisonment. Benefit of
aQie

section 382-B, Cr.P.C has been extended to the
convict/appellant.

2. The prosecution story as divulged from the
FIR, registered on the strength of murasila, in brief, is
that on 01.7.2020 at 20:30 hours, complainant Saud
Khan (PW-12) brought the dead body of his brother
Khursheed Ahmad to civil hospital, D.. Khan, where
he reported the incident to the local police that he
alongwith his afore-named brother were proceeding
from Kirri Shamozai to their house in a motorcar and
at about 05:45 hours (Asar Wela) when they reached
at Kirri Shamozai-Mangal Road near graveyard, the
accused/appellant was standing there who signaled
them to stop, whereupon his brother stopped the
motorcar, deboarded therefrom and went to the
accused, the accused took out his pistol and fired at
his brother, who was hit and fell to the ground, After
commission of the occurrence, the accused fled away;
that he could do nothing being empty-hand; that he
placed the injured in the motorcar and proceeded to
civil hospital, D.J.Khan, however, the injured
succumbed to his injuries on the way. Besides the
complainant, the occurrence might have witnessed by
someone. No motive was disclosed by the
complainant. He charged the accused for the

commission of offence.

3. On arrest of the accused and after
completion of investigation, complete challan was
submitted before the trial Court where at the
commencement of trial, the prosecution produced and
examined as many as thirteen witnesses, whereafter,
statement of the accused under section 342 Cr.P.C,
was recorded wherein he professed innocence and
false implication, however, neither he wished to be
examined under section 340(2) Cr.P.C, nor opted to
produce defence evidence. The learned trial after
hearing arguments, convicted the appellant and
sentenced him, as mentioned above, which has been
assailed by the appellant through the instant criminal
appeal, while the complainant has filed the connected
criminal revision for enhancement of sentence, which
is being disposed of through this single judgment.

4. We have heard the learned counsel for the
appellant, the learned A.A.G. assisted by learned
private counsel for the complainant at length and with
their able assistance, the record was perused from
cover to cover.

5. Though the learned trial Court dealt with
the matter comprehensively, by highlighting
material aspects of the case while convicting the
appellants, yet this being the Court of appeal is

under obligation to re-appreciate the evidence, so

S&S

ae

that miscarriage of justice could be avoided. This
Court is to see; as to whether the approach of the
learned trial Court to the material aspects of the case
was correct and as to whether reasons advanced for
convicting the appellants get support from the material
available on file. We are conscious of the fact that if
on one hand in case of single accused substitution is
held to be the rarest phenomenon then on the other the
Court deciding the fate of the accused is under
obligation to search for independent corroboration and
be vigilant while assessing the inherent worth of the
evidence produced. It is advisable that the learned trial
Court in case of a single accused must not be swayed
with the impulse that substitution is a rare
phenomenon and that it must not take it for granted
that in case of single accused, the prosecution is not
under obligation to prove its case and that once an
accused is charged, he outrightly be declared guilty, if
the trial Court travels with the impulse then the
criminal justice system will always be in peril and in
that eventuality one cannot think otherwise, but
miscarriage of justice will always occasion which
approach is neither permissible nor finds a room in the
system, as Courts are the custodian of the rights of the
parties and in all eventualities they will follow the

guidelines provided and the principles evolved. In the

<i§ =

like situation, it is incumbent upon both the trial as
well as the appellate Court to appreciate the evidence
collected and after assessing the collected material the
lis is to be answered so as to avoid miscarriage of
justice.

6. It is the case of prosecution that on the day
of occurrence, the complainant alongwith his brother
Khursheed Ahmad (deceased) were proceeding from
Kirri Shamozai to their house in a motorcar and at
about 05:45 hours (Asar Wela), when they reached at
Kirri Shamozai-Mangal Road near graveyard, the
accused/appellant was standing there, who signaled
them to stop, whereupon his brother stopped the
motorcar, deboarded therefrom and went to the
accused, the accused took out his pistol and fired at
his brother, who was hit and fell to the ground. The
complainant placed the injured in the motorcar for
shifting to the hospital, however, he succumbed to his
injuries on the way. In the present case, the ocular
account of the incident was furnished by the
complainant, who was examined as PW-12. We are
conscious of the fact that no doubt mere relationship
of a witness could not be a ground to discard his
evidence, however, testimony of such witness is to be

scrutinized with great care and caution, especially the
26s

same should not be relied upon, without corroboration
for sustaining conviction on a capital charge.

hs It is pertinent to mention that the incident
in the present case allegedly occurred on 01.7.2020 at
05:45 hours, whereas the matter was reported at civil
hospital, D.L Khan on said date at about 20:30 hours.
On the face of it there is delay of two hours and 45
minutes in reporting the incident which has not been
plausibly explained by the prosecution. It is quite
surprising that as per postmortem report of the
deceased, firstly, in the column meant for “Whence
brought: village.Thana, District” name of one Abdul
Salam Khan son of Haji Alam Khan has been
mentioned; secondly, the autopsy on the dead body of
the deceased was conducted on 01.7.2020 at 08:05
hours. Now the question arises that if the complainant
was present on the spot at the time of incident and had
allegedly shifted the deceased, then injured, to the
hospital, his name should have figured in the aforesaid
column of the postmortem report. It is also quite
surprising that the postmortem was conducted prior to
the report. The afore-named Abdul Salam is identifier
of the dead body, who was examined before the trial
Court as PW-10. During cross-examination, he stated
that he visited the hospital at his own and came from

Ramak in a special vehicle. He stated that he has a

sf

shop in village Ramak and on the day of occurrence
he was present at said shop. He admitted that on his
way reaching to hospital, he did not meet with the
complainant. He reached the hospital after 08:30 p.m.
According to him, when he reached the hospital, he
thumb impressed the post-mortem report. He admitted
that he alone came to D.I.Khan hospital. He also
admitted that mouth of the deceased shown in the
picture available on file was open. The above aspects
could not simply be brushed aside as the same cut the
very roots of the prosecution case inasmuch as same
belied the presence of the complainant on the spot at
the time of incident and thereafter in the hospital. In

case titled “Abdul Jabbar _and another Vs. The

State” (2019 SCMR 129), it has been held that:-

“At the cost of reiteration, it has been
observed by us that, in a case, where
the learned appellate court, after
reappraisal of entire evidence
available on record, has reached the
conclusion that there is unexplained
delay in lodging the FIR; the presence
of eye-witnesses is not established;
there are irreparable dents in the case
of the prosecution; the recovery is
ineffective and is of uo consequence;
the ocular account is belied by the
medical evidence; the motive behind
the occurrence is far from being
proved and almost non-existent, the
said Court fell in gross error in
maintaining the conviction of the
appellants particularly on a capital
charge”.
-8-

8. It is pertinent to mention here as per
deposition of Ghulam Habib (PW-2) and Atta-ur-
Rahman (PW-8), they reached at DHQ Hospital
D.I.Khan in two hours, however, no daily diary in this
regard is available on the record. Even otherwise, as
per deposition of PW-2, it was almost 5:30/6:00 p.m
(Asar Vela) when he received information about the
occurrence, whereupon he started for D.I.Khan
hospital. In view thereof, he should have reached the
hospital at 08:00 p.m, so when he reached the
hospital, by then the postmortem on the dead body of
deceased had already commenced and thereafter, the
incident was reported at 08:30 p.m. This aspect of the
case has also jolted the very foundation of prosecution
case.

9, The complainant while appearing before
the trial Court as PW-12, reiterated same story as
narrated in the FIR, however, with regard to shifting
of his brother, he stated that he shifted his brother into
his car and proceeded towards DIQ_ hospital,
D.I.Khan where the doctor apprised him that he had
been died a while ago on the way, then he reported the
matter. While perusing cross-examination of the
complainant, it surprised us that as per his deposition,
three hospitals fall on the way to civil hospital

D.I.Khan, even then the deceased then injured was not

-9-

shifted there. The only inference which could be
drawn therefrom, is that had the complainant been
present at the crime scene and accompanied the
deceased, then injured, in such eventuality, first
priority of the complainant was that the deceased then
injured should have been shifted to the nearest
hospital in order to save his life by his brother, the
complainant. Another astonishing aspect in the
testimony of complainant is that according to him
although he supported the deceased, then injured, in
boarding him in the motorcar, however, his hands
were not smeared with blood, notwithstanding the fact
that Qameez and Shalwar of the deceased, then
injured, were soaked with blood, as per the statement
of Medical Officer (PW-7). Reliance in this regard is
placed upon the case law reported as “Bakht Nawas
and another Vs. The State and another” (2020
YLR Peshawar 1685), wherein it has been held that,
“In case complainant was present at the spot, his
clothes and hands would have been smeared with
blood of the deceased in lifting him/shifting him to the
hospital, but no such clothes had been produced
before the Investigating officer. Said circumstances
created serious doubts about presence of the
complainant at the spot at the time of occurrence”.

Even no blood was secured from the motorcar to

-10-

establish shifting of the deceased, then injured, to the
hospital, as admitted by the complainant as well as the
Investigating Officer (PW-11}. PW-11 also admitted
that in the entire investigation, he has not mentioned
the fact that the hands or the clothes of the
complainant were besmeared with blood; that no
blood stains on the hands or on the clothes of the
complainant were available.

10. Yet another intriguing aspect of the case is
that as per deposition of the Investigation Officer,
mouth and eyes of the deceased were open, which
belics the presence of the complainant on the spot or

in the hospital. In the case reported as “Muhammad

Rafique alias Feeqa Vs. The State” (2019 SCMR
1068), it has been held by the apex Court that:-

“What has further irked this Court is that
in column No.9 of the Marg Report
(Ex.PW 9/1), and even in the Post Mortem
Report (Ex. PW I0/A), the mouth of the
deceased has been stated to be open, which
clearly indicates that the dead body was not
attended to by his close relatives after being
pronounced dead. However, the stance set
up by the prosecution in the present case is
that Arshad Ali- the brother, and Nazir
Alimad- the uncle of the deceased
Muhanmad Azam were present at the time
of his death, and remained with him, even
thereafter. Thus, the said posture of the
deceased raises an adverse inference
against the prosecution’s version regarding
the presence of the said persons at the
place and time of occurrence”.
-1l-

In another case reported as “Muhammad
Asif Vs. The State” (2017 SCMR 486), it has been
held that:-

“In column No.8 of the inquest report, the
eyes and mouth of the deceased were found
open, thus, if the parents, witnesses, and
the two close friends were present then, at
least after the death as is a consistent
practice of such close relatives, they would
have closed eyes and mouth of the deceased
on his expiry. This fact by itself indicates
that none was present with the deceased till
his death and why his eyes and mouth
remained open and were not set right by
any one and his dead body was discovered
late in the night”.

In view of the above, while disbelieving
the ocular account so furnished by the complainant,
we discard the same from consideration.

11. Another witness of the prosecution is the
scribe of murasila, namely Ghulam Habib IHC, who
was examined before the trial Court as PW-2.
According to him, during the days of occurrence, he
was posted at Police Station Chaudhwan, On the
report of complainant, he drafted the murasila Ex.
PA/1, which was read over to the complainant, who
after admitting it correct signed the same, whereafter,
he handed over the same to constable Abdur Rahman
No.809, who took the same to Police Station for
registration of FIR. He also prepared injury sheet and

inquest report of the deceased and handed over the

same alongwith the dead body to constable Atta-ur-

= 12

Rahman No.836 for postmortem examination. During
cross-examination, he admitted that he received
information in the Police Station about the incident
from where he rushed to D.I.Khan hospital. However,
he had not recorded his departure in the Daily Diary
of Police Station. It is astonishing that when police
officials are available at Reporting Center of DHQ
Hospital, D.I.Khan round the clock, what prompted
this witness to proceed to the hospital at D.I.Khan.
Even he did not disclose that who informed him about
the occurrence and on whose direction he went to
DHQ Hospital, D.Il.Khan for scribing the report. He
also admitted that in the way there fall two hospitals
i.e. THQ Hospital, Daraban and Mufti Mahmood
Teaching Hospital, D.I.Khan. He was unaware about
venue of occurrence. He further stated that as soon as
he reached to the hospital, the complainant party also
reached to the hospital. This deposition is belied by
the statement of Atta-ur-Rahman constable (PW-8),
who stated that the complainant arrived prior to their
arrival at the hospital. He further admitted that the
complainant party had not informed/visited the
Reporting Center, D.J.Khan. He also admitted that he
was not in contact with the complainant on telephone.
He was confronted with his statement recorded under

section 161, Cr.P.C. regarding handing over the
-13-

murasila to constable Abdur Rahman, preparing of
injury sheet as well as inquest report and handing over
the same to constable Atta-ur-Rahman, which was not
so recorded therein.

12. So far as recoveries are concerned, same
were allegedly effected from the spot on the following
day of occurrence, however, there is nothing on record
that after the occurrence till the time of spot
inspection, the spot was secured by the police. In this
view of the matter, presence of the alleged empties
without being disturbed overnight also creates serious
doubts about its recovery. In this respect, Muhammad
Hanif Moharrir was examined before the trial Court as
PW-5, who stated nothing about the empties or .30
bore pistol being handed over to him and only stated
that on receipt of murasila, he chalked out the FIR Ex.
PA. Although Juma Khan constable (PW-6) stated in
his examination-in-chief that he took the case property
to the FSL, however, during cross-examination, he
admitted it correct that he was not in possession of
any proof regarding his visit to the FSL alongwith the
case property. Even copy of Register No.19 has not
been placed on the record in this respect. In this view
of the matter, the FSL report has lost its evidentiary
value, which could not be relied upon for sustaining

conviction and that too, on a capital charge. Moreso,

-14-

the said recoveries being corroborative piece of
evidence could not outweigh the ocular account,
which has already been disbelieved by us in the

preceding paragraphs. In case reported as “Nawab

Siraj_Ali and others Vs. The State through A.G.
Sindh” (2023 SCMR 16), it has been held that:-

“This Court in a number of cases had held
that if the crime empty is sent to the
Forensic Science Laboratory after the
arrest of the accused or together with the
crime weapon, the positive report of the
said Laboratory looses its evidentiary value.
Sending the crime empties together with
the weapon of offence is not a safe way to
sustain conviction of the accused and it
smacks of foul play on the part of the
Investigating Officer simply for the reason
that till recovery of weapon, he kept the
empties with him for no justifiable reason”.

In this respect, reliance can also be placed

on the case law reported as “Muhammad Bilal and

another Vs. The State and others” (2021 SCMR
1039).

13. The overall impact of what has been

discussed above is that the prosecution has
miserably failed to establish the case against the
appellants, otherwise to extend benefit of doubt so
many circumstances are not required to be brought
forth. In this regard, guidance is sought from a

judgment reported as “Zarig Pervez Vs. The State”

(1995 SCMR 1345), wherein it has been held that:-
-15-

“The concept of benefit of doubt to any
accused person is deep rooted in our
country. For giving him benefit of doubt,
it is not necessary that there should be
many circumstances creating doubts. If
there is a circumstance which creates
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind
about the guilt of the accused, then the
accused will be entitled to the benefit not
as a matter of grace aud concession but
as a matter of right”.

The above has been reiterated by the apex

Court in a recent judgment reported as “Ahmed _ Ali

and another Vs. The State” (2023 SCMR 781

wherein it has been held that:-

eney

“Even otherwise, it is well settled that
for the purposes of extending the benefit
of doubt to an accused, it is not
necessary that there be multiple
infirmities in the prosecution case or
several circumstances creating doubt. A
single or slightest doubt, if found
reasonable, in the prosecution case
would be sufficient to entitle the
accused to its benefit, not as a matter of
grace and concession but as a matter of
right. Reliance in this regard may be
placed on the cases reported as Tajamal
Hussain v. The State (2022 SCMR
1567), Sajjad Hussain yv. The State
(2022 SCMR 1540), Abdul Ghafoor y.
The State (2022 SCMR 1527 SC),
Kashif Ali v. The State (2022 SCMR
1515), Muhammad Ashraf v. The State
(2022 SCMR 1328), Khalid Mehmood v.
The State (2022 SCMR 1148),
Muhammad Sami Ullah v. The State
(2022 SCMR 998), Bashir Muhammad
Khan v. The State (2022 SCMR 986),
The State v. Ahmed Omer Sheikh (2021
SCMR 873), Najaf Ali Shah v. The State
(2021 SCMR 736), Muhammad Imran
v. The State (2020 SCMR 857), Abdul
Jabbar v. The State (2019 SCMR 129),
Msi. Asia Bibi v. The State (PLD 2019

Ghulam Qadir y. The State (2008 SCMR
1221) and Tarig Pervaiz v. The State
(1995 SCMR 1345)”.
14, For the aforesaid reasons, the prosecution
has miserably failed to prove its case against the
accused beyond a ray of doubt, therefore, the instant
criminal appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment of
conviction is set aside, resultantly, the appellant is
acquitted of the charges levelled against him. He be
released forthwith, if not required to be detained in
connection with any other criminal case. Since we
have accepted the captioned criminal appeal, the

connected Criminal Revision No.03-D of 2022 has

become infructuous which stands dismissed as such.

15. Above are the detailed reasons of our short
order of even date.
