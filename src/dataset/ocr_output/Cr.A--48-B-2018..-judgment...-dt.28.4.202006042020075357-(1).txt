SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- Musharaf Khan, Raqeem
Khan and Shafiullah were tried by the Additional Sessions
Judge, Takht-e-Nasrati, Karak, for committing Qatl-e-Amd
of Maula Jan and attempting at the life of the complainant
and PW Sarwar Jan ineffectively, in which respect case F.LR
No. 102 dated 16.08.2015, under sections 302/324/34 P.P.C,
at Police Station Shah Salim, Karak, was registered. The
accused Shafiullah was acquitted, while accused/ appellant

Rageem Khan was convicted under section 302 (b) P.P.C,
-2-

and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for life, with
compensation Rs.200000/- to the LRs of the deceased or in
default to further undergo six months S.I. and accused/
appellant Musharaf Khan was convicted under section 302
(c) P.P.C and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment
for five years with Rs.100000/- as compensation to the Legal
heirs of deceased, under section 544-A Cr.P.C. while they

earned acquittal for offence under section 324 P.P.C.

2. Aggrieved from the order of conviction and
sentence the appellants Musharaf Khan and Raqeem Khan
impugned the judgment dated 24.02.2018 by way of instant
Criminal Appeal No. 48-B/2018, while the complainant
preferred Cr. A No. 52-B/2018 against the acquittal of
accused Shafiullah and Cr. R No. 14-B of 2018 for
enhancement of sentence of the appellants. We intend to
dispose of both Criminal Appeals as well as Criminal

revision, through this single judgment.

3. Brief facts of the case are that on 16.08.2015 at
about 14.45 hours, the complainant Amanullah alongwith
Sarwar Jan brought the dead-body of his uncle Maula Jan to
the Civil Hospital, Takht-e-Nasrati, Karak and reported the
matter to Aqleem Khan S.H.O (PW-09) to the effect that he
alongwith Sarwar Jan and his uncle Maula Jan were present
near the shop of one Azeem Khan, it was at about 13.00

hours, that the accused i.e. Musharaf Khan, Raqeem Khan

-3-
and Shafiullah, approached on motorcycle to the spot and
started indiscriminate firing targeting them, where the fire
shots of accused Musharaf and Raqeem Khan went effective
by hitting the deceased on different parts of his body, while
. they luckily escaped unhurt. While shifting the injured to the
hospital he succumbed to the injuries. Motive behind the
occurrence was stated to be previous blood feud. The report
of complainant was reduced in the shape of Murasila
Ex:PA/1, which was sent through constable Azizur Rehman
No.112, to the Police Station, where Mohammad Ismail IHC
Mouharrir (PW1) culminated the contents of Murasila into
FI.R Ex:PA. Aqleem Khan S.H.O (PW-9) prepared the
injury sheet Ex:PM/3 and inquest report Ex:PM/2 and sent
the dead-body for post mortem examination through
constable Nazeer Ullah No844 (PW-04). After completion of
investigation complete challan under section 512 Cr.P.C. was
submitted followed by a supplementary challan, after arrest

of the accused, before the learned trial Court.

4. The accused were summoned and the
formalities under section 265-C Cr.PC were adhered to, the
charge was framed against the accused on 23.11.2016, to
which they did not plead guilty and claimed trial. The
prosecution in order to prove guilt of the accused produced
and examined as many as fourteen (14) witnesses. After
close of the prosecution evidence, statements of accused

were recorded under section 342 Cr.PC, wherein they
-4-
professed innocence. Neither they wished to produce defence
nor opted to be examined on oath as provided under section
340(2) Cr.P.C. Learned trial Court after hearing arguments of
learned counsel for the parties, vide impugned judgment
dated 24.12.2018 acquitted the accused/respondent
Shafiullah, while convicted and sentenced the accused/
appellants Musharaf Khan and Rageeb Khan. The convict /
appellants filed this Cr.A No.48-B of 2018, while the
complainant has challenged acquittal of accused/ respondent
Shafiullah vide Cr.A No.52-B/2018 and criminal revision
petition for enhancement of sentence, bearing No.14 -

B/2018. We intend to decide all the three through this

common judgment.
5. Arguments heard and record perused.
6. It was the 10" of August, 2016, when the

deceased alongwith the complainant and another reached to
the spot and were fired at by the appellants and the acquitted
co-accused Shafiullah, which resulted into the death of the
deceased while the other two escaped unhurt. The motive
was stated to be the blood feud. The place where the incident
occurred is a deserted metal road with fields situated on its
either side, though a little away from the spot was situated
the shop of one Azeem Khan, but the shop keeper could not
be examined as whenever the Investigating Officer

approached it was found closed. The time of incident was
-5-
stated to be 01.00 p.m in the month of august, a time where
presence at such a place demands nothing but urgency, as the
atmosphere was controlled by the scorching heat with no
shelter around. It will ever remain a question that what for all
the three were present there. The complainant, while making
the report did not explain the purpose of their presence and
even kept mum when appeared before the trial Court. It was
an unusual company of all the three i.e. the deceased who
had touched the threshold of 70 years of his age, the
complainant his son-in-law and PW Sarwar Jan his brother.
The eye-witness Sarwar Jan was examined as PW-12, who
stated that on the day of occurrence they left their village for
the house of his friend namely Chammo, where at 12.15 p.m
they were served with tea in his baithak, where after they
left his house and reached to the spot where the tragedy
occurred. The explanation lacks confidence when the custom
of the land is placed before. The traditions of the area cannot
be ignored, that how they were served with tea at the time
when the villagers sit for lunch and that what generosity was
shown by the person they visited. We are still travelling
under surprise that why soon after the incident the said
Chammo did not attract to the spot and that why the
Investigating Officer did not associate him with the process,
who could have better explained that whether in fact all the
three had visited him or not. Yet again, who out of the three

claimed his friendship is not known, even otherwise the
SY

-6-
deceased would not enjoy comfort in this company that too
when the visit and presence was purposeless. It was essential
for the prosecution to examine the said Chammo, as it was he
alone and alone who could have established their presence on
the spot soon after leaving his baithak, but the lack of interest
from both i.e. the Investigating Officer and the complainant
leads us nowhere but to hold that the story narrated by the
complainant is not worthy of credence rather a vague attempt
was made on part of the witnesses to make the story and the
presence appealable to mind. There is no cavil with the
proposition that when best available evidence is with held it
is the prosecution to suffer and that is what Article 129 (g) of

the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 caters for.

7. The complainant is yet to travel the hardest
journey to establish his presence with the deceased at the
time of incident. What the complainant portrayed is yet to be
accepted as he walked with abnormalities in his statement.
The Investigating Officer prepared the site-plan on pointation
of the witnesses with different points assigned to all. All are
placed at a distance of 7 to 9 feet from one another, despite
blood feud the assailants went so generous that the witnesses
were left alive with the happiest purpose to facilitate their
journey to the gallows. The complainant stated that they
were fired at but went unhurt but our understanding fails that
why having been armed with sophisticated weapons just a

few feet away the assailants could not accomplish the task

-7-
i.e. to eliminate all the three. The complainant stated that the
appellants with the acquitted co-accused arrived on
motorcycle, stepped down and started firing with their
respective weapons, where the fire shots of the appellants
went effective leading to the death of the deceased but they
were blessed with life when divinity intervened. Both the
complainant and the eye-witness remained consistent in
saying that all the three had blood feud with all the three but
they could not tell that why out of the three, it was only and
only the deceased who appeased the appetite of the
assailants. It was nothing but the abnormalities that shrouded
the episode, it was stated by the witnesses that the convicts
reached on motorcycle duly armed and soon after firing left
the motorcycle and decamped from the spot, what a conduct
was displayed by the assailants, that despite in possession of
a motorcycle they chose to walk away by leaving motorcycle
on the spot that too when the appellant Musharaf was
admittedly, unable to walk, the situation was further clarified
when one Sattar Khan, SI was examined as PW-05, who
explained the physical condition of the appellant Musharaf in
the following words “It is correct that I have correctly
recorded in my investigation paper that the accused
Musharaf Khan was disabled and was unable to ride on
motorcycle at that time”. This is again surprising that why
and how all the three duly armed with Kalashnikovs rode the

motorcycle and that why Musharaf joined hands with the
-8-
other two, who could have conveniently achieved their
desired goal, this was brought from the mouth of the
witnesses that the appellant was an elderly and notable
person who also contested election for the seat of member of
the Provincial Assembly, this was his notoriety that tightened
the noose around his neck. Both the complainant and the eye-
witnesses kept on struggling to establish their presence on
the spot, but the circumstances did not suit their conduct. The
complainant when entered the witness box stated that on
receiving fire shots the deceased while injured fell to the
ground and on arrival of charpaies (cots) he was placed there
on but neither his hands nor his clothes were stained with
blood and even the Investigating Officer did not take the note

of it.

8. The complainant was examined as PW-11, who
stated that while reaching to the hospital one is to pass
through the police station that falls in the way. It was further
admitted that the injured breathed his last while en-route to
the hospital but surprisingly, was not diverted to the police
station. The complainant stated that after their arrival the
police of police station Shah Salim reached to the hospital,
where the SHO Aqleem Khan penned down the report. The
complainant is to explain that who informed the scribe as he
was neither in possession of a mobile set nor any one was
sent to the police station for the purpose, though the scribe

was examined as PW-09, who stated that he alongwith the
-9-

Investigating Officer was present in Seerak Adda, when at
about 01.30 p.m the Moharrir of Police Station Shah Saleem
informed him and that he in the company of the investigating
officer reached to the hospital at 02.00 p.m. He further stated
that it took him 15/20 minutes in preparation of the injury
sheet and the inquest report, if so then how the report was
made at 14.25 hours. Another alarming aspect of the case is
that the post mortem examination was conducted at 13:50
hours by Dr Arif Mumtaz, who was examined as PW-07,
who stated that he conducted autopsy on the deceased at
13.50 hours and that the deadbody was brought 5/10 minutes
earlier for the purpose. There is no denial to the fact that
post mortem examination is conducted after the report is
made followed by the preparation of injury sheet and inquest
report. The scribe appeared as PW-09, who stated that he
reached to the hospital at 02.00 p.m and it take him 15/20
minutes in preparing the injury sheet and inquest report and
that it was there after that the deadbody was dispatched to the
doctor for post mortem examination, meaning thereby that all
those formalities were finalized by 02.20 p.m, we are posed
with a question that how post mortem could be conducted
when the report was not yet made. Who out of the three i.e.
the doctor, complainant or the scribe was telling the truth, we
say with certainty that it was the doctor who was telling the
truth and the two did not. The incident occurred at a deserted

place, when the deceased was all alone, who was rushed to

-10-

the hospital and after his death was placed before the doctor
at 13.50 hours and the matter was delayed till arrival of the
complainant. The murder went un-witnessed, had the
witnesses been present they would have reported the matter
at the earliest, the witnesses admitted that there was a
reporting center in the hospital with police present round the
clock, but the matter was not reported to them and it was the
later arrival of PW-09, ie. Aqleem Khan (S.H.O.) of Police
Station Shah Salim that the matter was reported to him.
Another astonishing aspect of the case is, that when the
complainant admitted that he could not inform his family as
he was not in possession of a mobile set, then how the other

relatives reached to the hospital by the time they reached.

In case “Muhammad Wasif Khan and others

ee

Vs The State and others” (2011 PCr.L_J_ 470 Lahore)

that:-

“F.LR. has a very significant role to play,
being a corner stone of the prosecution case to
establish guilt of the accused involved in the
crime-- Any doubt in lodging of F.ILR. and
commencement of investigation give rise to a
benefit in favour of accused-- F.LR. lodged
after conducting an inquiry loses _ its

evidentiary value.”
9. The scribe stated that when he reached to the
hospital the complainant was present with the dead body, he

did not mention the presence of the eye-witness with the
-ll-

complainant. Had the eye-witness been present he being the
real brother would himself have registered the case, what to
say of reporting the matter, he did not verify the report of the
complainant. None of the two i.e. the complainant and the
eye-witness identified the dead-body before the police when
the inquest report was prepared and before the doctor at the
time of post mortem examination, all this tell nothing but that
the witnesses are chance and interested witnesses. When the
record was read we found that one Amir Badshah and his
wife were murdered, where Sanab Gul son of Amir Badshah,
(the deceased) was charged who was later on killed leading
to a charge against the deceased Maula Jan and it was
suggested to the witnesses that these were the sons of
deceased Sanab Gul who killed the deceased. The veracity of
the witnesses was further doubted when PW-06 Shamim
Khan SI appeared before the trial Court and stated that the
co-accused Shafiullah took the plea of alibi that he was
present at Khushab working in a coal mine and that he was
assigned the task to visit and confirm, so he went to Khushab
and found that Shafiullah on the day of occurrence was

present at Khoshab.

In case titled “Muhammad Ashraf alias Acchu
Vs the State” (2019 SCMR 652), wherein it is held that:
“I is well settled that benefit of slightest

doubt must go to an accused and in a case

where the Court reaches a conclusion that

-12-

eye-witnesses were chance witnesses; they

had not witnessed the occurrence and the

prosecution story is concocted by the PWs,

then the case of the accused merits plain

acquittal.”
10. It was argued with vehemence that the medical
evidence was in conformity with the evidence led by the
prosecution and that the number of injuries commensurate
with the number of the assailants. It was further submitted
that the Investigating Officer recovered 20 empties of 7.62
bore, which were sent to the arms expert and that the report
was received in positive i.e. it was opined that the empties
were fired from different weapons. We would like to deal the
formulated submissions one by one. The learned counsel
representing the complainant went wrong by stating that the
medical evidence honours what the prosecution portrayed, as
this was the case of the prosecution that the deceased was
facing south when he was fired at, but while consulting the
relevant record we found that some of the injuries were
caused from the back, the dimension of the injuries tells
nothing but that it was the job of a single person. The
complainant stated that both the deceased and the accused
were standing at the time of firing but to the contrary the
doctor stated that the direction of injuries was from down to
upward. All the entry wounds were having blackening

around, that too do not support what the witnesses stated, and
-13-
we are confirmed to hold that the medical evidence is in

conflict with the ocular account.

In case titled “Akhter Saleem and another Vs
the State and another” (2019 MLD 1107), it is held that:

“12.The above factors, material
contradictions between ocular and medical
evidence create serious doubts in the
happening of alleged occurrence and it is
well settled law that even a single doubt, if
found reasonable, would entitle the
accused person to acquittal and not a

combination of several doubts.”

11. The last in row was that, the forensic report in
respect of the empties supports the charge qua the number of
accused. We cannot happily accede to what the prosecution
claimed, yet it has to pass the acid test. The empties were
collected from the spot on 16.08.2015 and received to the
laboratory on 19.08.2015, but the investigating officer did
not record the statement of the concerned official who took
the same to the laboratory for comparison. Needless to
mention that when the direct evidence fails then rest of the
evidence loses its grip and cannot be taken singularly to

facilitate conviction that too on capital charge.

In case titled “Bakht Munir Vs_the State”

ee

(2016 MLD 934), it is held that:
-14-

“11, Besides, the crime pistol had
been allegedly recovered on the same
day of incident i.e. 14.01.2012, but has
been sent to the FSL with the crime
empties on 21.01.2012 i.e. after a delay
of seven days, for which no
explanation, much less plausible has
been furnished by the prosecution as
to where and in whose custody the
pistol and empties remained for this
period and whether these were in safe
hands. Muhammad Akbar Khan S.I
(PW.7/nvestigating Officer deposed
that he has not recorded statement of
any concerned person regarding delay

in sending the articles to the FSL.”

12. We know that prosecution is not bound to setup
motive in every case but once it is alleged and not proved,
then ocular account is required to be scrutinized with great

caution. It has been held in the case titled "Hakim Ali Vs.

The State" (1971 SCMR-432), that the prosecution though
not called upon to establish motive in every case, yet once it
has setup a motive and failed to establish, the prosecution
must suffer consequences and not the defence. The above

view has been reiterated in the case of "Amin Ullah Vs. The

State" (PLD 1976.SC 629), wherein, it has been observed by
their lordships, that motive is an important constituent and if
found by the Court to be untrue, the Court should be on
guard to accept the prosecution story. It was again re-

enforced by the august Supreme Court in the case of
-15-

"Muhammad Sadiq Vs. Muhammad Sarwar" (1997 SCMR
214). Again on the same principle, case laws titled Noor
Muhammad Vs. The State and another" (201 0 SCMR 997)

.gnd "Amin Ali and another Vs. The State" (2011 SCMR-
323) can also be referred.

13. The learned counsel for the appellant
vehemently argued that the appellant remained absconder for
sufficient long time, but mere absconscion of accused is not
conclusive guilt of an accused person; it is only a suspicious
_ circumstance against an accused that he was found guilty of
the offence. However, suspicions after all are suspicions, the
same cannot take the place of proof, the value of absconcion,

therefore, depends on the facts of each case. In case titled

"Liagat Hussain and others Vs Falak Sher and others"
(2003 SCMR 611 (a), wherein it has been held:-

"(a) Eye-witnesses including the
complainant had failed to furnish a
plausible and acceptable explanation
for being present on the scene of
occurrence and were chance
witnesses-—Prosecution case did not
inspire confidence and fell for short of
sounding probable to a man of
reasonable prudence---Abscondence of
accused in such circumstances could
not offer any useful corroboration to

the case of prosecution"
-16-
14, Before parting ways with the judgment, we
deem it appropriate to caution the trial Courts from adopting
an approach, while awarding sentences, which has never
been permitted by the law. These were the whims which
swayed the trial Court while sentencing the convict/
appellant Musharaf under section 302(c) P.P.C. as we see no
justification in doing so, old age or physical deformity has
never been the determining factor for awarding lesser
sentence, while convicting an accused under section 302(c)
P.P.C, it was not the age but the circumstances of that
particular case that steers the wheel, the trial Court went
astray in awarding two different sentences to accused who
were similarly placed. Would that, the trial Court could go
through the judgment reported as PLD 1996 SC 274, “Ali

Muhammad and another Vs Ali Muhammad and another”

then the erroneous conclusion would have easily avoided.

15. After thoroughly evaluating the evidence available on
file this court reaches to an inescapable conclusion that the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case against
accused/appellant. Resultantly, this appeal is, therefore,
allowed, the conviction and sentence of the appellant
recorded by the learned trial court is set-aside and he is
acquitted of the charge by extending him the benefit of
doubt, he shall be released forth with from jail, if not

required to be detained in connection with any other case.

-17-
The connected Criminal Revision No.14-B/2018 and Cr.A

No.52-B of 2018 are dismissed.

16. Above are the reasons of our short order of the
even date.
