JUDGMENT

ISHTIAQ_ IBRAHIM, J.- This appeal has been
preferred by appellant Sher Alam against the
judgment of the learned Additional Sessions
Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi, Dir Lower at Chakdara dated
16.12.2020 rendered in case FIR No. 592 dated
28.12.1999 u/s 302/34 PPC of P.S Ouch, District Dir

being off-shoots of the same verdict, are decided

together through this judgment.

2: The report had been lodged by
complainant Mst. Noor Jehan on 28.12.1999 at
13:20 hours on arrival of police to her house.
According to her narrations as per Murasila, on the
same day, while busy in sewing clothes in her house,
she came out on hearing noise and saw that accused
Fazal Khan, Bacha Khan (already acquitted) and
Sher Alam (appellant) were firing at her husband
Sultani Mulk through Kalashnikovs as_ result
whereof he was hit and died on the spot. She further
stated that the occurrence has been witnessed by her
as well as her mother-in-law Mst. Sabaz Pari and
daughter Asia (PW-1). Motive behind the
occurrence was disclosed as dispute over barren plot

for construction (ati jt 54%),

3. Muhammad Gul Khan ASHO reduced
report of the complainant into Murasila and sent the
dead body to civil hospital Gul Abad, however, on
the request of relatives of the deceased, the dead
body was examined by Dr. Arshad Nawaz in the
house of complainant. Co-accused Fazal Khan and

Bacha Khan were arrested, however, the present

appellant went into hiding, therefore, after
completion of investigation complete challan was
put against the co-accused while proceedings under
section 512, Cr.P.C were conducted against the
appellant. Prosecution examined seven PWs in
support of its case and the co-accused were
examined u/s 342, Cr.P.C. The learned trial Court
vide judgment dated 25.02.2000 the co-accused
found innocent, hence, acquitted them of the charge,
while convicted the present appellant in absentia
under the rule of Qaza Alal-Ghayeb and sentenced
him for life imprisonment till death. It is noteworthy
that this Court has maintained acquittal of the co-
accused by dismissing Cr.A No. 106/2000 preferred

by State vide judgment dated 09.10.2013.

4. The appellant was arrested on
09.08.2018 and committed to jail to serve the
sentence awarded to him by trial Court in his
absence, so, he challenged his conviction and
sentence before this Court through Cr.A No. 208-M/
2018 which was allowed vide judgment dated
17.12.2018 and the case was remanded to trial Court
for conducting trial of the appellant in accordance

with law.

5. On receipt of the case record and copy
of judgment of this Court, the learned trial Court
summoned the appellant from jail and framed formal
charge against him to which he did not plead guilty
and opted to face the trial. Prosecution produced
Mst. Asia Bibi, Dr. Arshad Nawaz, Inspector
Ibrahim Khan, ASI Muhammad Naeem and the then
ASHO Muhammad Gul whose statements were
recorded as PW-1 and PW-5 to PW-8 respectively.
In view of illness and old age of complainant Mst.
Noor Jehan, prosecution submitted an application for
transposition of her statement recorded as PW-3
during proceedings u/s 512, Cr.P.C against the
appellant/trial of acquitted co-accused. The learned
trial Court vide order dated 07.09.2020, after
examining the complainant through Standing
Medical Board, transposed her statement to the trial
of the present appellant as (PW-2). Similarly, on the
request of prosecution, statements of PWs Abdur
Rauf SHO and Muhammad Ghani IHC previously
recorded during 512, Cr.P.C proceedings, were also
transposed to the trial of appellant because of their
illness. Their statements are PW-3 and PW-4
respectively. On closure of evidence, the appellant

was examined u/s 342, Cr.P.C. He once again denied

gi
the allegation of prosecution, however, he neither
recorded his own statement on oath nor produced
any evidence in his defence. On conclusion of trial,
the learned trial Court vide judgment dated
16.12.2020 sentenced the appellant to life
imprisonment on his conviction u/s 302(b) PPC with
compensation of Rs.200,000/- payable to LRs of the
deceased. Hence, this appeal and the connected

revision petition.

6. We have heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the parties including the learned
Assistant A.G. for State and perused the record with

their able assistance.

fe It is the version of prosecution in the
initial report that the present appellant and his co-
accused Fazal Khan and Bacha Khan had fired at
deceased Sultani Mulk as result whereof he died on
the spot. The same version is also emerging from
examination-in-chief of Mst. Asia Bibi (PW-1) as
well as complainant Mst. Noor Jehan (PW-2) whose
earlier statement recorded as PW-3 has been
transposed to the trial of the present appellant. The
said witnesses have claimed that they had seen the

appellant and his other co-accused firing at the

bie
deceased. The eye-witnesses neither in their
statements at trial stage nor the complainant in her
report has specified the role of each accused rather
they have attributed the role of effective firing to all
the accused including the appellant but, as per
medical report, the deceased has sustained a single
firearm injury on his body which proved fatal and
caused his death. After arrest of the co-accused, they
were separately tried by trial Court for the said
offence and were acquitted vide judgment dated
25.02.2000 on the ground of having been charged
for ineffective firing. The learned trial Court through
the same judgment sentenced the present appellant
to life imprisonment till death in his absentia by
holding that reliable evidence in shape of ocular
account and circumstantial evidence coupled with
his abcondence is available against him. The said
judgment to the extent of the present appellant has
been set aside by this Court and the case was
remanded back to trial Court for trial of the appellant
in accordance with law. The learned trial Court, on
conclusion of post-remand proceedings, has
convicted the appellant again mainly on the ground
of his specific role in light of the answer of

complainant in response to the Court question. It

For the time being, we have before us
the ocular account of Mst. Asia and complainant
Mst. Noor Jehan and both of them in their
examination-in-chief have attributed the role of
effective firing to all the accused including the
present appellant while the deceased has sustained a
single firearm injury on his person. Except the
above-referred Court question, role of the present
appellant has not been specified elsewhere on the
entire record and the witness i.e PW Tariq Ahmad
son of Khan Bahadar, who had specified his role in
his statement, has been abandoned by prosecution.
There are two pivotal questions for resolution before
this Court firstly, whether conviction of an accused
can be recorded on the basis of Court question, if not
then what will be the fate of the case of the appellant
when his other co-accused, having the same role in
the FIR, have already been acquitted by trial Court

and confirmed by this Court.

8 No doubt, Article 161 of Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 empowers the Court to compel a
witness to answer any question or to produce any
document that the Court may think necessary or
relevant to discover the truth or obtain proper proof of
the relevant fact, however, Courts are required to use
these powers with great care and caution. The referred
section reads:

161. Judge’s power to put question or order
production. The Judge may, in order to discover or
to obtain proper proof of relevant facts, ask any
question he places in any form, at any time, of any
witness, or of the parties about any fact relevant or
irrelevant, and may order the production of any
document or things and neither the parties nor their
agents shall be entitled to make any objection to any
such question or order, nor, without the leave of the
Court, to cross-examine any witness upon any
answer given in reply to any such question;

Provided that the judgment must be based
upon facts declared by this order to be relevant, and
duly proved;

Proved also that this Article shall not
authorize any Judge to compel any witness to
answer any question to or produce any document
which such witness would entitled to refuse to
answer or produce under Articles 4 to 14, both
inclusive, if the question were asked or the
document were called for by the adverse party; nor
shall the Judge ask any question which it would be
improper of any other person to ask under Article
14 or 144; nor shall he dispensed with primary
evidence of any document, except in the case
hereinbefore expected.

However, it is the persistent view of
superior Courts that such powers under the above
provision are to be exercised by a Judge only in cases
of absolute necessity in the interests of justice without

being persuaded by the whims and fancy of any party

aOs
and while doing so the Court should keep in mind the
benefit of defence rather than the prosecution. In this
regard we would refer the judgment of Dacca High
Court in the case of ‘The State Vs. Balahari_Das
Sutradhar’ reported as PLD 1962 Dacca 467 wherein
it was observed that:

It is true that section 165 of the Evidence Act

gives very wide power to the Judge to put any

question he pleases to any witnesses in order

to discover or obtain proper D proof of

relevant facts. This power, however, should

be used with great circumspection and only

when it is absolutely necessary in the interest

of justice and without assuming the role of

any party to the proceeding...... That being

the state of things, if the learned Additional

Sessions Judge wanted to exercise his power

under section 165 of the Evidence Act, in our

opinion, he should have done so in the

interest of justice for the benefit of the
defence rather than the prosecution.

A judge, while deciding the guilt or
innocence of an accused, should always behave
impartially without any bias otherwise he will defeat
the ends of justice. Questions asked by a Court from
a witness have a different impact on the witness as
compared to the questions asked by a counsel during
cross-examination. Thus, the possibility cannot be
ignored that a witness may get intimidated or
encouraged by questions of a judge and give the

evidence other than that he had the desire and

SB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamul/Ps*

210s
intention to give. Obviously, a Judge cannot play his
role like a lawyer due to lack of his knowledge
regarding all the facts of a case as possessed by a
counsel, therefore, when the judge apprehends that
his questions will either intimidate or encourage the
witness for which he will be blamed for favoritism,
he should not make intervention by asking questions
from a witness unnecessarily. Moreso, such powers
under Article 161 of the Qanaun-e-Shahadat Order
1984 are required to be exercised only when the
Court believes that certain ambiguities in light of
different pieces of evidence need clarification but in
the present case, both the eye-witnesses have
recorded their examination-in-chief in the line of
FIR and the defence counsel had cross-examined
them almost on each and every aspect of the case,
therefore, intervention of the trial judge by putting
questions to PWs, for filling up lacunas in
prosecution case, was not warranted under the law.
Reference may be had to Yaved Shamshad_and

others Vs. The State’ (1996 PCr.LJ 3 Karachi). It

was observed in the said judgment that:

Article 161 does not put any embargo or
limitation in exercise of the power conferred
on the Court. The proviso, however, clearly
lays down that the judgment is to be based on
the facts proved in accordance with the

SB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamul/Ps*|

affs

provisions contained in the Order. Looking
at the above proviso the proper construction’
of the said Article in its totality would be in
our humble view that the above power is to
be exercised by the Court to resolve any
ambiguity or confusion found in the evidence
and to clear away the doubts created by
different pieces of evidence but while
exercising such power the Court shall weigh
the scales of justice evenly.

In view of the above discussion, the
questions asked by learned Trial Judge in the present
case were neither necessary nor there was any
ambiguity which needed clarification by Trial Court.
The questions having been so asked by trial Court
have caused miscarriage of justice to appellant,
therefore, the answers of complainant in response of

the said questions cannot base his conviction.

9. On exclusion of the referred questions
and answers thereof by complainant from the case, the
role of the present appellant, in light of the FIR and
ocular account, remains unspecified like his co-
accused. They have already been acquitted by trial
Court and the said order has attained finality.
Complainant has charged all the accused including the
appellant for effective firing at the deceased but the
doctor has reported a single injury on the dead body.
Irrespective of the fact that the doctor had visited the
house of complainant for examination of the dead body

$B: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamul/Pse|

Pa
against the normal routine and procedure, medical
report is in conflict with ocular account, therefore, the
said report is of no avail to prosecution rather it creates
a reasonable doubt in prudent mind regarding the guilt
of the appellant. In addition, Mst. Asia Bibi (PW-1)
has improved her earlier version by stating that
accused Fazal Khan and Bacha Khan were on rooftop
of their house while the present appellant was present
on thoroughfare at the time of occurrence.
Complainant stated that the dead body had been
brought to P.S situated at a distance of 17/18
kilometres from the spot but neither any report was
lodged in the P.S nor the dead body was examined in
hospital though the same had been shifted to hospital
as per contents of Murasila. Prosecution has not
explained that why the dead body was carried back
without being examined by doctor in hospital and
medical examination of the corpse was conducted by
Dr. Arshad Nawaz on the following day of occurrence
in the house of complainant on the request of her
relatives. In addition to above, the time of report
mentioned in Murasila bears overwriting and it
appears that figure 6 has been replaced with figure 3. If
the delay of about 02 hours be considered forgiveable

in view of hilly area and long distance of the spot from

SB: Hon’ble Mr, Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Tajamul/Ps*|

-13-
P.S, even then the visible overwriting in Murasila
suggests concealment of real facts of occurrence on the
part of investigating agency. Similarly, 13 empties
recovered from the spot have not been sent to FSL for
confirmation of the fact that the same had been fired
from the same or different weapons. There are various
inconsistencies and contradictions in prosecution case
creating serious doubts and appellant is entitled to get
the benefit thereof as of right. Wisdom may be drawn
from judgment in the case of ‘Najaf Ali Shah Vs. The
State’ (2021 SCMR 736). It was observed by Hon’ble
apex Court in the said judgment that:

“once a single loophole is observed in a case

presented by the prosecution, such as conflict

in the ocular account and medical evidence

or presence of eye-witnesses being doubtful,

the benefit of such loophole/lacuna in the

prosecution's case automatically goes in
favour of an accused”,

10. We are cognizant of the alleged
vicarious liability of the appellant with his co-
accused but not only the prosecution has failed to
substantiate the said allegation against him through
reliable evidence but the co-accused, to whom the
same role had been attributed by complainant in the
FIR, have also been acquitted of the charge on the

same set of evidence, therefore, conviction and

Tajamul/Ps*|

« [Ain
sentence of the appellant cannot be sustained in the

circumstances. Reliance in this regard is placed on

‘Liagat Ali_and_ others Vs. The State _and_others’
(2021 SCMR_ 455) and ‘Umer Khursheed_and

another Vs. Syed Tufail Ahmad and others’ (2018
SCMR 1051).

il. Long abscondence of the appellant
for almost two decades cannot be denied, however,
abscondence per se has never been considered a
proof of guilt, therefore, this factor alone cannot
base conviction of the appellant when prosecution
has otherwise failed to establish his guilt through
trustworthy ocular account and circumstantial
evidence of convincing nature. Wisdom is drawn

from ‘Basharat and another Vs. The State’ (1995

SCMR 1735) wherein it was observed that:

The occurrence took place on 20-4-1988.
Basharat appellant was arrested on
28-4-1988. The blood-stained Chhuri was
alleged recovered from his house on
30-4-1988. It is not believable that he would
have kept blood-stained Chhuri intact in his
house for ten days when he had sufficient
time and opportunity to wash away and clean
the blood on it. After disbelieving the alleged
motive, exclusion of the ocular evidence and
the rejection of the incriminating recovery,
there remains circumstance of abscondence
of Ghulam Mustafa which per se is not
sufficient for conviction under section 302,

12. In light of what has been discussed
above, prosecution has not established the guilt of
appellant Sher Alam beyond shadow of reasonable
doubt, therefore, his conviction and sentence
recorded by trial Court through the impugned
judgment need reversal. Resultantly, this appeal is
allowed, the impugned judgment is set aside and
the appellant is acquitted of the charge leveled
against him in this case. He be released forthwith
from jail if not required in any other case. The
connected Cr.R No. 05-M/2021 is dismissed for
having infructuous.
