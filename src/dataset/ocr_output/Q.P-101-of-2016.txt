JUDGMENT

Date ofhearing: 15.02.2018

Petitioner:- (Said Afzal) by Mr. Abdul Qayum,

Advocate.

Respondents: (The State & others) by Malak

Sarwar _Khan_ State counsel and Muhammad
Ikram Khan, Advocate.

MOHAMMAD _IBRAHIM_KHAN, J.- Upon
registration of the case FIR No. 215 dated
10.6.2016 under sections 440,379,148,149
PPC registered at Police Station Sheringal
District Dir Upper, it pertains to the report
of Said Afzal, the Petitioner herein. Under
narration of the facts that the parties belong
to Qwanj Sheringal, the complainant is
owner of the extensive properties both
constructed and un-built properties and
some time before the accused/Respondents
by leaving their cattles in the wheat crops

Nawab (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
-Z.-

had damaged the said crops and also cut %
walnut trees. This occurrence was reported
to the Court but even then later this offence
was repeated and when the complaint was
lodged for the second time against these
accused/Respondents_ proceedings under
section 427 PPC were initiated in which the
next date of proceedings was fixed for
07.06.2016. When on 01.06.2016 at 7:00
a.m. the Respondents duly armed entered in
the wheat crops and cut the same and in this
way had caused a lot of loss to the
complainant. As the offence under the
covered sections 379,440 have been
committed, therefore, the Respondents are
to be prosecuted.

2. During the investigation, the police
officials recommended the  accused-
Respondents Mian Zarin, Nasib Zada, Mola
Muhammad, Hizbullah and Chandar and
another group Mutabar Khan, Amir Bacha,
Akbar Zada, Ihsanullah, Rahmatullah and

Jan Bacha for reasons to believe that they

Nawab (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
-3-
may not be involved in the commission of
the offences, therefore, the impugned
separate orders dated 14.06.2016 and
22.12.2016 have been passed by the learned
Judicial Magistrate Sheringal Dir Bala in
respect of discharge of the
accused/Respondents under section 63 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure. However,
they were directed to submit bonds in the
sum of Rs. 40,000/- each in two sureties in
the like amount to the satisfaction of said
learned Judicial Magistrate.

3. Aggrieved with the findings for the
discharge of the accused/Respondents
Criminal Revisions bearing Nos. 04 & 05 of
2016 were preferred before the Court of
learned Sessions Judge/Zila Qazi Dir
Upper. In verbatim form through the
judgment dated 09.12.2016 for the same
reasons particularly under Para 4 of each
judgment, the learned Sessions Judge
concerned did not interfere with the

impugned orders of the learned Judicial

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
-4-
Magistrate. The verbatim Para No. 4 of both
the judgments is reproduced herein:-

“

Honorable Superior

Courts have time and again

held that an order under this

Section is only an

administrative order and is not

susceptible to interference in

Revision Petition by the

Sessions Judge. Reliance is

placed PLD 2000 Lahore 136.

In view of the above

scenario, this Revision Petition

is dismissed on the ground of

jurisdiction.”
4. Hence, these are the separate
quashment petitions bearing Cr.M Q.P. No.
101-M & 102-M of 2016 preferred by the
complainant (herein the Petitioner) Said
Afzal against the impugned orders of the
learned Courts below inter-alia on the
grounds enumerated in each of the petition.
5. Having heard arguments of learned
counsel for the parties and learned Astt:
Advocate General appearing on behalf of

the State, record with their assistance gone

through.

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
we

6. Learned counsel for the complainant
(the Petitioner herein) referred to 2002
SCMR_239 “Engr. Bashir _Ahmad_V/S
Senior _ Superintendent ___o. Police
Islamabad”, _2006__SCMR__1920__“
Hidayatullah_ V/S_The_ State” and_2005
MLD 1883 “ The State V/S_Ubaidullah”
and accordingly prayed for the acceptance
of both these quashment petitions and
setting aside of the impugned orders of the
learned Judicial Magistrate as well as
learned Sessions Judge/Zila Qazi Dir Bala.
ie Consequent to these arguments,
learned counsel for the accused-
Respondents states that he has no objection
to take up the trial before the learned Trial
Court and conclude the same for its logic
end, however, the impugned orders of the
learned Judicial Magistrate for the discharge
of the accused/Respondents did not call for
any interference.

8. Indeed, the complaint of the present

Petitioner would require the evidence to be

Nawab (S.8.) Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
“6

adduced during the trial. The Investigation
Officer of this case has furnished the
‘challan’ and will shortly be put in Court. It
has to be seen that whether the orders of
learned Judicial Magistrate are under
appreciation of the true perspective theme
as contained in section 63 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, while
going through it reveals that:-

“ Discharge of person apprehended.
No person who has been arrested by
a police-officer shall be discharged
except on his own bond, or on bail,
or under the special order of a
Magistrate.”
This section enable the learned
Judicial Magistrate to pass an order of
discharging the accused involved in a case

where there is requirement of wa

rranting material evidence. The judgment as

reported in PLD 2001 Lahore 271 “Ashiq

Hussain V/S Sessions Judge Lodhran” of

the Hon’ble Lahore High Court authored by
Mr. Justice Asif Saeed Khosa has covered

all the aspects of section 63 in comparison

Nawab (S.B.) Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
-7-
to all the affiliated sections 173, 173 (3),
169, 170,439 and 561-A read with sections
190 & 103.Thereby, the exhaustive findings
would be more attractive to clarify the
powers under section 63 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure of a Judicial Magistrate
for discharge of an accused/Respondents in
this case. Upon submission of ‘challan’ it’s
still open that a dressed trial can be held
before the competent Court and in no way
the complainant can be precluded from
leading evidence which may implicate the
accused/Respondents during the _ trial
leading to conviction under the sections of
law levied by the prosecution.

9. In another words, learned counsel for
the accused/Respondents has shown his
willingness that let during the dressed trial
before the concerned competent Court a
charge may be framed against the
accused/Respondents while the complainant

is to lead evidence to decide the wheel of

Nawab (S.8.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
-8-

fortune of the accused/Respondents either in

acquittal or conviction.

10. In such terms both these connected

quashment petitions are not worth of

credence, hence are disposed of

accordingly. 2
