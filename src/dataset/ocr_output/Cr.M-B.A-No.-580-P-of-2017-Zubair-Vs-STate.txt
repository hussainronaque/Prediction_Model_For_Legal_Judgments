Respondent (s):-State by Mr. Rab Nawaz Khan AAG .
Nemo for complainant.

ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- Petitioners 1. Zubair and
2. Noor Nawaz, seek bail in case FIR No.442 dated
06.08.2013, registered under sections 302/324/148/149
PPC, in Police Station Duaba, District Hangu.

2. According to report of complainant Baseer
Ahmad, on the fateful day he along with his uncles,
Mohabat Khan and Ghazi Mat Khan was on the way to
Duaba Bazaar in a motorcar and reached near the house of
Yousaf Khan, Zahir Khan and Mujahid (acquitted co-
accused) along with Noor Nawaz (petitioner), intercepted
them. There was exchange of hot words between them,
however, on interference of the people/mediators, they
were separated. Consequently, he (the complainant) along
with his uncles proceeded to Duaba Bazaar where they
were busy in purchase of house hold articles when at 15.15
hours, accused Zahir Khan, Mujahid (acquitted co-accused)

and Zubair, Noor Nazwaz, (present petitioners), duly
2

armed with pistols came there on motorbikes. Accused
Mujahid opened fired at Mohabat Khan, as a result, he got
hit and died on the spot while accused Zahir Khan, Zubair,
Noor Nawaz and Afzal opened fire at the complainant and
his uncle Ghazi Mat Khan, as a result, the latter got hit and
succumbed to the injuries on the way to the hospital. The
complainant luckily remained unscathed. Motive behind
the occurrence is that one Shakir of accused’s family was
murdered some two years prior to the occurrence, for
which the accused were suspecting the family of the
complainant. Hence, this case.

3. Complainant Baseer Ahmad has been properly
served, but neither had he appeared before the Deputy
Registrar nor this Court. Being a bail matter, cannot be
kept pending for indefinite period, therefore, is being
disposed of on the available record in light of the
arguments of learned counsel for the petitioners and
learned AAG for the State.

4. The role attributed to the petitioners is that of
firing at deceased Ghazi Mat Khan and complainant, along
with co-accused Zahir Khan and Afzal. The effective shots
on the person of the deceased have not been specifically
attributed to the present petitioners. In this view of the
matter, it is yet to be determined that whose fire shots, out
of the four accused, proved fatal as well as sharing of

common intention of rest of the accused with the accused
3

of the effective shot. The role of the petitioners is not
distinguishable from co-accused Zahir Khan, who has been
acquitted by the Trial Court vide judgment dated
30.09.2016, which judgment has attained finality as the
same has not been assailed before the higher forum by the
complainant/prosecution. In the circumstances, whether the
prosecution would be able to bring home the guilt of the
petitioners on the same set of evidence on the basis of
which co-accused having similar role to that of the
petitioners has already been acquitted, is a crucial question
which requires further probe into the guilt of the
petitioners. The only ground which prevailed before the
learned lower Court for refusal of bail to the petitioners
was their abscondence for a period of three years. Such
observation of the learned Trial Court is against the dictum
laid down by the worthy apex Court in Ibrahim’s case
(1985 SCMR 382), Muhammad Sadiq’s case (PLD 1985
SC 182), Malik Mukhtar Ahmaed Awan’s case (1991
SCMR 322), Mitho Pitafi’s case (2009 SCMR 299), and
Qamar alias Mitho’s case (PLD 2012 SC 322), according
to which mere abscondence of an accused person would
not be sufficient for refusal of bail to accused, if otherwise,
on merits a case of bail has been made out.

5. For the reasons discussed above, this petition is
allowed. Accused/petitioners are admitted to bail provided

they furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs.2,00,000/- with
4
two local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD concerned.
