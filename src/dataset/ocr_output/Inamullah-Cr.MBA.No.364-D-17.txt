Date ofhearing: 15.12.2017.

Appellant-petitioner by M/S Ahmad Ali Khan Marwat &
Muhammad Kamran Niazi Advocate.

Respondent By M/S Farooq Akhtar khan Advocate and Adnan

Ali Khan AAG for the State.

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- \namullah son of Fatehullah has filed
this petition for his release on post arrest bail in crime report
No.188 dated 14.10.2017 of Police Station Kulachi, District
D.I.Khan, wherein he is charged under Sections 302/34 PPC for
the murder of Khalid, brother of the complainant.

2. The gist of the case, forming background of this case,
is that on 14.10.2017 at about 2245 hours, the complainant
Misal Khan reported the matter to the police that he alongwith
his brother were coming back at night time on foot after
attending marriage ceremony of Hikmatullah, at about 09:30
p.m. his brother Khalid Khan was going ahead of him, he was

holding a torch, all of a sudden accused Inamullah son of

Imran/* (S.B.) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
Fatehullah, Rafiullah son of Khizar Hayat while riding on one
motorbike and Khizar Hayat son of Fatehullah and Aminullah
son of Khizar Hayat on another motorbike, came behind them,
cross the complainant and reached near to his brother,
deboarded from the motorbikes and fired at him from their
respective pistols with the intention to kill him, due to which he
was hit and died on the spot. The complainant could do nothing
being empty handed. After commission of offence the accused
decamped from the spot. Motive as alleged in the FIR is dispute
over womenfolk. The accused were charged for the commission
of offence.

3. The accused was arrested on 06.11.2017. Vide order
dated 20.11.2017, the learned Additional Sessions Judge-V,
D.I.Khan declined bail to the petitioner, hence, this petition.

4. The learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that
collective/general role of firing had been levelled to the
petitioner and his other three co-accused regarding firing at
Khalid and no specific injury had been attributed to the
petitioner. Admittedly, no weapon was recovered from the
possession of the accused during the investigation of this case.
The FIR itself refers to previous dispute over womenfolk
between the parties and therefore, a possibility of spreading the

net wide by complainant party so as to falsely entangle the

Imran/* (S.B.) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
petitioner cannot safely be ruled out of consideration at this
stage. Four persons have been charged for firing at the deceased
with pistols, but, only one empty was recovered from the spot,
which shows that the assailant was not more than one. The
postmortem report does not support the contention of the
complainant. He lastly contended that the prosecution case
squarely falls within the ambit of subsection (2) of Section 497
Cr.PC, therefore, the petitioner is entitled for bail.

5. On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the respondent/complainant argued that the petitioner
and his other three co-accused have specifically been charged
for committing murder of Khalid. He next argued that the
accused were identified in the light of torch. He also argued that
postmortem report, site plan and version of the complainant are
consistent inter alia. He further argued that the deceased
sustained four wounds and number of assailants were also four
which is consistent within the version of the complainant. He
next argued that occurrence took place near the pond and there
is possibility that empties might have fallen into the pond. He
lastly argued that the offence with which the accused is charged
falls within the prohibitory part of Section 497 Cr.PC,

therefore, he does not deserve the concession of bail.

Imran/* (S.B.) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
6. From perusal of case papers, it is clear that deceased
died due to injuries received by him by discharge of firearm
injury on different parts of his body, which is supported by the
ocular evidence as well as the postmortem report. The injuries
received by deceased were sufficient to cause his death and
thereby he died too. The number of injuries sustained by the
deceased commensurate with number of accused who fired
upon the deceased. Mere non recovery of more than one empty
from the spot does not make the prosecution case one of further
inquiry into the guilt of the petitioner. Deeper appreciation of
evidence is not permissible at bail stage. Dispute over
womenfolk can be motive for commission of offence. Presence
of the petitioner on the spot alongwith other co-accused has
been tentatively established from prosecution record. Co-
accused are still at large. The petitioner is unable to make out a
case of further inquiry into his guilt. Moreso, investigation has
been completed and trial is likely to commence. In such a
situation the Courts normally or ordinarily decline to grant bail
in cases in which either Challan has been put in the Court and
trial is likely to commence shortly or the trial has begun. The
proposition lends support for the precedents of august Supreme

Court in “Mian Dad Vs. State” (1992 SCMR 1448) and “Said

Imran/* (S.B.) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
Akbar and another Vs. Gul Akbar and another” (1996 SCMR
931).

7. For the foregoing reasons, the petitioner is not found
entitled to bail, hence, his petition being bereft of merit is
dismissed. However, the prosecution is directed to submit
challan against the petitioner within a fortnight and trial Court
is directed to conclude the trial within five months from the
date of receipt of case file.

Announced.
