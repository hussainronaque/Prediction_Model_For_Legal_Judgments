JUDGMENT

Date of hearing: 20.02.2017

Appellant-petitioner Haq Nawaz by Muhammad Ismail
Khan Alizai Advocate

Respondent State by Mr. Kamran Hayat Khan
Miankhel, AAG and Mr. Muhammad

Zahid Khan Advocate for complainant.

MUHAMMAD _ AYUB_ KHAN, J.- Through this single
judgment, we propose to dispose of instant Criminal
Appeal No.31-D/2016 filed by appellant Haqnawaz
against his conviction and sentence and Murder Reference
No.4-D/2016 forwarded by learned trial Court as both the
matters are the outcome of one and the same judgment
dated 12.5.2016 rendered by learned Sessions Judge,
Tank, whereby the appellant was convicted under section
302(b) PPC and sentenced to death and also to pay
compensation of Rs.5000000/- to the legal heirs of
deceased under section 544-A Cr.P.C or to undergo six

months simple imprisonment in default.

2. The prosecution story, in brief, is that on

17.6.2009 at 1800 hours, complainant Abdur Rahim in
-2-

injured condition lodged the report at police station
Mulazai, District Tank to the effect that at about 1745
hours, he was standing near the shop of Nasrullah
Bhittani when in the meanwhile, appellant came there
duly armed with 303 bore rifle and fired at him, he got hit
on his left thigh and fell down. After the occurrence, the
appellant ran away. The occurrence was stated to have
been witnessed by one Hidayatullah. The complainant
stated that there was no motive for the occurrence and he
did not know why the appellant made firing at him.
Initially, the case was registered under section 324 PPC.
The injured complainant succumbed to injury on
18.6.2009 and section of law was altered from 324 to 302

PPC.

3. After completion of usual investigation,
complete challan against the appellant was submitted
before the learned trial Court where he was formally
charged. He did not plead guilty to the charge and
claimed trial. In order to establish the guilt of appellant,
the prosecution examined ten P.Ws. Thereafter, statement
of the appellant was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C,
wherein he professed innocence and false implication.
However, he neither appeared as his own witness on oath

nor produced any evidence in his defence. After hearing
-3-

the arguments, the learned trial Court convicted and
sentenced the appellant as mentioned above vide

impugned judgment dated 12.5.2016.

4. The learned counsel for the appellant
contended with vehemence that there were material
contradictions in the statements of witnesses, but the
learned trial Court failed to appreciate the same in true
perspective; that there was no eyewitness to the
occurrence; that the learned trial Court wrongly termed
the report of complainant as dying declaration and placed
reliance on the same. He went on to argue that the
prosecution evidence on record created reasonable doubts
regarding guilt of the appellant, the benefit of which must
have been given to the appellant but the learned trial
Court based its findings on surmises and conjectures

while convicting the appellant.

5. Conversely, the learned law officer assisted by
private counsel representing the complainant party refuted
the arguments of learned counsel for the appellant and
contended that the prosecution proved its case against the
appellant to the hilt by producing confidence inspiring
evidence, therefore, the learned trial Court has rightly

convicted and sentenced the appellant.
-4-

6. We have heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the parties and have perused the record

thoroughly.

7. The prosecution case mainly hinges on dying
declaration of the deceased, ocular account furnished by

PW Hidayatullah and medical evidence.

8. First of all, we will determine whether the
F.LR lodged by deceased then injured can be termed as
dying declaration and if so, whether it is to be believed or
not. On 17.6.2009 at 1800 hours, complainant Abdur
Rahim in injured condition lodged the report at police
station Mulazai, District Tank that at about 1745 hours, he
was standing near the shop of Nasrullah Bhittani when
appellant came there duly armed with 303 bore rifle and
fired at him. With the firing of appellant, he got hit on his
left thigh and fell down. Article 46(1) of Qanun-e-

Shahadat Order, 1984 envisages that:-

“46. Cases in which statement of relevant

fact by person who is dead or cannot be
bound, etc is relevant. Statements, written
or verbal, of relevant facts made by a
person who is dead, or who cannot be
found, or who has become incapable of
giving evidence, or whose attendance
cannot be procured without an amount of
delay or expense which under the
circumstances of the case appears to the
Court unreasonable, are themselves
relevant facts in the following cases:
(1) When it relates to cause of death.

When the statement is made by a person

as to the case of his death, or as to any of

the circumstances of the transaction which

resulted in his death, in cases in which the

cause of that person’s death comes into

question such statements are relevant

whether the person who made them was or

was not, at the time when they were made,

under expectation of death, and whatever

may be the nature of the proceeding in

which the cause of his death comes into

question.”
From the above reproduced Article, it is manifest that the
statement made by a person as to any of the
circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his
death, in cases in which the cause of that person’s death
comes into question such statements are relevant whether
the person who made them was or was not, at the time
when they were made, under expectation of death, and
whatever may be the nature of the proceeding in which
the cause of his death comes into question. In the instant
case, the deceased then injured made the report not under
expectation of death, but narrated the circumstances
which resulted in his death. It cannot be stated that he was
expecting death because the injury was on his left thigh
which is normally called non-vital part of the body.
However, according to doctor Khalid Iqbal (PW-4), the

cause of death is due to injury to main vessels leading to

extensive blood loss, shock and death. It is not necessary
-6-

for the admissibility of dying declaration that the
deceased at the time of making it should have been under
expectancy of death. The F.I.R bears the signature of
complainant and also the signature of SHO, police station
Mulazai and was lodged by the deceased then injured
himself immediately after the incident which eliminated
the possibility of any influence, therefore, it can safely be
termed as dying declaration and conviction can be based
on it. In this respect, reliance can be placed on the case of
Mst. Shamim Akhtar. Vs. Fiaz_Akhtar_and two others

(PLD 1992 SC 211) wherein it was held that:-

“Mst. Nasim Akhtar died subsequently.
The doctor who examined her injuries on
the day of incident stated that the
condition of the patient was fairly good. It
is not mentioned which requirement of law
in recording the dying declaration has
been ignored. The law does not prescribe
any special mode of recording the dying
declaration. The statement of an injured
recorded by the police under section 161
Cr.P.C during the course of investigation
is not hit by section 162 Cr.P.C. As such
the dying declaration is a good piece of
evidence and it can be relied upon by the
prosecution. It is not necessary for the
admissibility of dying declaration that the
deceased at the time of making it should
have been under expectancy of death. A
statement under section 161 Cr.P.C of an
injured is an admissible evidence even
though the injured had died much later.
The dying declaration is to be adjudged
on its own merits.”
-7-

Reliance can also be placed on the cases of Majeed. Vs.

The_ State (2010 SCMR_55) and _Farmanullah. Vs.
Qadeem Khan and another (2001 SCMR 1474).

9. Next comes the statement of Hidayatullah
recorded during proceedings under section 512 Cr.P.C.
The learned counsel for the appellant vehemently
contended that such statement is not admissible in
evidence as the witness was not subjected to cross
examination. The record reveals that PW Hidayatullah
appeared before the Court on 29.8.2015 but his statement
could not be recorded due to absence of counsel for
complainant and on 02.9.2015, said PW was abandoned
being won over. It was on 09.9.2015 when learned
counsel for the complainant submitted an application for
transferring the statement of PW Hidayatullah already
recorded during trial under section 512 Cr.P.C which was
allowed on the same date and statement of the said PW
was transferred. The witness was neither dead nor his
attendance could not be procured, but he appeared before
the Court and on the next date, he was abandoned being
won over. However, on the following date, on the
application of learned counsel for the complainant, the
statement of PW Hidayatullah recorded during trial under

section 512 Cr.P.C was transferred which is legally not
-8-

correct because the appellant was deprived of cross
examining the witness. In such circumstances, the
statement of PW Hidayatullah is not worth reliance and is
ruled out of consideration. Even if the statement of PW
Hidayatullah is ruled out of consideration, the dying
declaration of the deceased then injured is there and is
sufficient for conviction of the appellant and was rightly
relied upon by the learned trial Court while convicting the

appellant.

10. The learned counsel for the appellant
contended that according to statement of Dr. Khalid Iqbal
(PW-4), he examined injured Abdur Rahim on 17.6.2009
at about 07.00 pm and on the same date at about 09.00
am, he conducted autopsy on the dead body of deceased
whereas according to PW-9, on the following day of the
occurrence, he received information about the death of
injured at 06.10 am, which is a material contradiction in
the statements of two P.Ws touching very roots of the
case, but it has not been taken into consideration by the
learned trial Court. The contention of learned counsel for
the appellants has no force because according to Dr.
Khalid Iqbal (PW-4), on 17.6.2009 at about 07.00 pm, he
examined injured Abdur Rahim and on the same date at

about 09.00 AM, he conducted autopsy on the dead body
-9-

of deceased. It appears to be a slip of tongue because PW-
4 examined the injured on 17.6.2009 at 07.00 pm and it is
not possible that he may have conducted autopsy on the
dead body on 17.6.2009 and that too at 09.00 am, before
his death. However, he not only clarified during cross
examination that he conducted autopsy on the dead body
of deceased on 18.6.2009, but the postmortem report
bears the date as 18.6.2009 at its end. This cannot be
termed as material contradiction fatal to the prosecution
case, but can be termed as mitigating circumstance so far
as award of punishment to the appellant is concerned.
Moreover, the occurrence is stated to have taken place on
17.6.2009 at 1745 hours and the report was lodged on the
same date at 1800 hours. This report has been lodged with
promptitude keeping in view the distance between place
of occurrence and the police station and after lodging the
report, the injured was referred for medical examination.
It is a case of single accused where substitution is a rare
phenomenon. Reliance in this respect can be placed on
the case of Falak Sher. Vs. The State (NLR 2000
Criminal 188), wherein it was held that:-

“In the overall circumstances of the case,

where motive has become suspect and

where the prosecution version suffers from

inconsistencies, other than of a_ fatal
character, it appears proper not to resort
-10-

to the death penalty, touching the guilt of
the accused.”

11. So far as the quantum of sentence awarded to
the appellant is concerned, there are following mitigating
circumstances, which entitle the appellant for award of

lesser punishment:-

(i) Reportedly, there is no motive for the
occurrence. The deceased then injured categorically stated
in his report that there is no previous motive and he does
not know why the appellant fired at him. In this respect,

reliance can be placed on the case of Abbas Hussain and

another. Vs. The State and another (1992 SCMR 320)

wherein it was held that:-

“In the peculiar facts and circumstances
of the case, it has not been clarified by
either party as to what was the actual and
immediate cause of occurrence as it is in
the evidence that there was no such deep-
rooted background of enmity existing
between the parties. There appears to be a
petty dispute between the parties over the
teasing of the girls of the Mohallah. We
hold the view that something serious
happened immediately before _ the
occurrence for which the appellants while
armed with Chhuries opened an attack
upon the complainant party and murdered
two persons from the complainant side.
Even the possibility of an altercation
having taken place between the parties
cannot be ruled out. Both the parties had
been living in the same locality. We are
-ll-

convinced about the insufficiency of the

immediate cause of — unfortunate

occurrence. In this view of the matter, we

do not feel inclined to uphold the death

sentence. In the circumstances, the

sentences of the appellants are altered

from death to imprisonment for life.”
(ii) The deceased then injured received a single
fire-shot and that too on non-vital part of his body. He
was at the mercy of the appellant but the appellant did
not repeat the fire. Moreover, the injury was also inflicted
on left thigh of the deceased which is a non-vital part of
the body but unfortunately, the injury became fatal and
resulted in death of the deceased. According to Dr.
Khalid Iqbal (PW-4), at the time of examination of the
injured, he was bleeding profusely and was not in stable
condition. In cross examination, he stated that, “So far as
I remember, no first aid treatment was given to the
injured prior to his examination by me. If first aid
treatment is given to injured whose vessels are damaged,
then there are chances of his survival for about 1’ to

two hours. The main blood vessels of the injured were

damaged.”

12. In the light of above discussion, we are
mindful that the sentence of death awarded to the
appellant by the learned trial Court is not justified

keeping in view the overall facts and circumstances of
-12-

the case. Resultantly, we partially allow Criminal Appeal
No.31-D/2016 and while maintaining the conviction of
appellant, convert his sentence of death to imprisonment
for life. The compensation amount of Rs.500000/-
awarded under section 544-A Cr.P.C is also reduced to
Rs.200000/-, which shall be recoverable as arrears of
land revenue and in default, the appellant shall suffer six
months simple imprisonment. The benefit of section 382-

B Cr.P.C is also extended to the appellant.

13. Murder Reference No.4-D/2016 is answered in
negative.
14. Above are the detailed reasons for our short

order of even date.
