MUHAMMAD _FAHEEM WALT, _J.- This
judgment shall also dispose of the connected
Cr.A.No.32-D/2022, Cr.A.No.34-D/2022 and Cr.R.
No.02-D/2022, as all the matters are the outcome of
one and the same judgment dated 05.7.2022, rendered
by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Paharpur,
D.I.Khan, in case FIR No.212 dated 12.7.2018, under
sections 302/109/201/34 PPC of police station SNK,
District D.I.Khan, whereby the appellants Irfan Ullah
and Muhammad Shehzad have been convicted under
section 302(b) read with Section 34 PPC, for
committing gatl-i-amd of deceased Faisal Nawaz, and
sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for life and also
to pay compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- (Ten Lac) each

to be paid to the L.Rs. of deceased in terms of Section
-2-

544-A, Cr.P.C. or in default thereof, to undergo six
months simple imprisonment. Both the sentences have
been ordered to run concurrently, however, benefit of
Section 382-B, Cr.P.C. has been extended to both the
convicts.

2. The prosecution story as disclosed in the
FIR, registered on the basis of murasila, in brief, is
that on 12.7.2018 at 7:15 hours, complainant Tarteel
Ahmad Khan (PW-7), while present with the dead
body of his brother Faisal Nawaz, aged about 45/46
years, reported the matter to the local police on the
spot, to the effect that on 11.7.2018 at evening (Sham
Wela), deceased left the house for Panyala in order to
participate in the charity/Khairaat of late Javed Khan,
however, he did not return therefrom; that in the
morning at about 6:30 hours, his cousin Fatehullah
came to his house and told him that his (complainant)
brother was done to death by someone with firearm
and the dead body was lying in football ground of Toi
Panyala, whereupon he rushed to the spot where
several people had gathered, while dead body of his
brother was lying there, who was killed by unknown
accused in the preceding night; that his brother was
having friendship with his co-villager, namely Salman
Khan; that the occurrence might have been witnessed
by someone. It is further stated in the report that they

had no enmity/motive with anyone, however, after
-3-

satisfaction he would charge the culprits.
Subsequently, during investigation, one Muhammad
Irfan son of Faiz Ullah, in his statement under section
161, Cr.P.C. followed by statement under section 164,
Cr.P.C. disclosed that accused Irfanullah and Shehzad
committed gatl-i-amd of Faisal Nawaz at the
instigation of co-accused Abdul Latif. Later on,
accused Zahoor was also implicated as an accused in
the present case for abetment.

3. On completion of investigation, complete
challan against the accused was submitted before the
trial Court where at the commencement of trial, the
prosecution produced and examined as many as
twelve (12) witnesses, whereafier, statements of the
accused under section 342 Cr.P.C, were recorded
wherein he professed innocence and false implication,
however, neither they wished to be examined under
section 340(2) Cr.P.C, nor opted to produce defence
evidence. The learned trial Court after hearing
arguments, convicted the appellants and sentenced
them, as mentioned above, which has been assailed by
the appellants through this and connected criminal
appeal No.34-D/2022, whereas the complainant has
filed the connected criminal appeal as well as criminal
revision challenging the acquittal of co-accused and

for enhancement of sentence awarded to the
-4.

appellants, which are being decided through this
single judgment.

4. We have heard the learned counsel
representing the appellant, the learned State Counsel
assisted by learned private counsel for the
complainant at length and with their able assistance,
the record was scanned.

5. It is the case of prosecution that on
11.7.2018 at evening (Sham Wela), deceased left the
house for Panyala in order to participate in the
charity/Khairaat of late Javed Khan, however, he did
not return therefrom and in the morning at about 6:30
hours, cousin of the complainant, namely Fatehullah
came to his house and disclosed to him that his
brother was done to death by someone with firearm
and the dead body was lying in football ground of Toi
Panyala, whereupon he rushed to the spot where he
found the dead body of his brother where several
people had gathered on the spot. The complainant
while reporting the matter on the spot did not charge
anyone and also stated that they had no enmity with
anyone else, however, it was Muhammad Irfan (PW-
12), who during investigation disclosed involvement
of the accused in the commission of offence and to
this effect, his statement was also recorded under
section 164, Cr.P.C. It is worth mentioning that as per

prosecution version, Fatehullah, cousin of the
-5-

complainant informed him about the occurrence,
however, to this effect he was not examined before the
trial Court.

6. Perusal of the impugned judgment reveals
that besides other material available on file, the
learned trial Court mainly based its findings on the
testimony of alleged eyewitness Muhammad Irfan
(PW-12) and recovery of .30 bore pistol coupled with
positive report of FSL regarding the said pistol and
five empties allegedly recovered from the spot,
therefore, in view thereof, we would like to re-
appraise the evidence in order to reach at a just
conclusion. Since the occurrence allegedly occurred in
the night between 11/12.7.2018, therefore, it was
bounden duty of the prosecution to establish the mode
and manner of the occurrence and involvement of the
accused in the commission of offence. According to
PW-12, on 11.7.2018, he was called via cell phone by
accused Shehzad to come to the Baithak of co-accused
Abdul Latif, whereupon he reached there and found
both accused Shehzad and Irfan, who placed their
hands on a box pretending it to be Holy Quran and
stated that they all the three are brothers and whatever
was done by them will not be disclosed to anyone
else, whereafter accused Shehzad took out a repeater
shotgun from the said Baithak and accused Irfan also

took a repeater shotgun and a pistol, whereafter, they
-6-

went to the Baithak of Pir Altaf Shah, situated in
Panyala, where one Afnan, Thekedar and Imran were
already present. It is pertinent to mention here that
neither Afnan, nor Thekedar or Imran were produced
before the Court to support the aforesaid story
narrated by this PW. According to this PW, he
alongwith accused Shehzad remained present with
said three persons in the compound of said Baithak
while accused Irfan handed over to him his pistol! and
then he went into the room of the Baithak with Pir
Altaf Shah, however, said Altaf Shah was also not
produced before the trial Court to support such stance.
Further perusal of examination-in-chief of this witness
reveals that from the Baithak of afore-referred Altaf
Shah, he alongwith convicts/appellants went to Toi
Panyala and sat in Akbar Football ground where they
noticed few persons coming towards the football
ground at some distance, whereupon accused Irfan
asked accused Shehzad to go and inquire about those
persons; that accused Shehzad handed over to him the
repeater shotgun and went towards those persons and
on return informed accused Irfan that those persons
were from Tipi Sahiban and were going towards their
homes; that after a while another person was noticed
at some distance who was busy talking on a mobile
phone and light of his cell phone was lit; that accused

Irfan asked him to return his pistol which he handed
-7-

over to him; that accused Shehzad went to inquire
about said person and on return told accused Irfan that
it was Faisal Nawaz, a friend of one Salman, while
Salman was enemy of acquitted co-accused Abdul
Latif; that accused Irfan handed over the pistol to
accused Shehzad and asked him to kill Faisal Nawaz,
meanwhile, accused Irfan took his mobile set as well
as his repeater shotgun and threatened him not to
disclose it to anyone otherwise he would be killed;
that accused Shehzad fired five time at Faisal Nawaz
and killed him on the spot. This witness also disclosed
further story ensued after the occurrence and in view
thereof, Abdul Latif was arrayed as an accused in the
present case. However, the story narrated by this
witness is not supported by any independent witness,
especially the persons whose names have been
mentioned by him, because they were neither
associated with the investigation nor produced before
the Court. The cross-examination of this witness
reveals that he is a Munshi with some lawyer at
Paharpur and lives at D.I.Khan. Further perusal of
cross-examination of this witness reveals that
regarding most crucial questions put to him by the
defence, he answered that he was unaware of the
same, especially to a question regarding his
confinement by the accused after the occurrence, he

answered that he was unaware if his father had
-8-

reported the matter to the police about his missing and
after his return to his house, nor he was aware of the
fact that whether he had reported the matter to police.
In view thereof, testimony of this witness could not be
believed for sustaining conviction on a capital charge.
Another important witness of the
prosecution is Tarteel Ahmad Khan complainant, who
was examined before the trial Court as PW-7, he
stated that although he charged unknown accused in
his report, however, on the basis of disclosure of
PW-12 before the police and statement u/s 164,
Cr.P.C., he charged the accused for the commission of
offence, however, he did not state a single word about
recording of his statement by police or his statement
recorded under section 164, Cr.P.C. It is worth
mentioning that complainant while reporting the
matter stated that he was informed by his cousin
Fatehullah, who had come to his house in the morning
at about 6:30 AM, however, while appearing before
the trial Court deposed that he was called by said
Fatehullah on cell phone at about 6:30 AM and
informed him that his brother Faisal Nawaz was lying
dead in football ground at Toi Khulla. In this view of
the matter, the only inference which could be drawn
therefrom is that neither he was informed by his
cousin Fatehullah, nor he had been to the spot after

such information, rather he tried to bring his testimony
-9-

in line with the testimony of PW-12, whose testimony
has already been disbelieved by us in the preceding
paragraph. It is pertinent to mention here that despite
having prior information about the occurrence, the
complainant reached the spot after arrival of the
police. The anxiety of this Court prevailed with regard
to information of occurrence allegedly communicated
to the local police for the reason that the complainant
while reporting the matter neither stated in his report
to have informed the police, nor in his statement
before the trial Court. According to him, although he
accompanied the dead body to the hospital in a police
van, however, he was unaware about names of
persons present on the spot. Even he did not mention
the names of the persons who identified the dead body
before the doctor, notwithstanding the fact that as per
his admission he accompanied the dead body which
was handed over to them in the hospital after the
postmortem at 8:00 AM. Although Muhammad
Nawafil (brother of the deceased) was examined as
PW-8, who allegedly signed the inquest report and
identified the dead body before the police as well as
before the doctor, however, complainant while
appearing before the trial Court did not utter single
word regarding presence of aforesaid witness on the
spot, meaning thereby that the complainant was

neither informed about the occurrence nor he had been
-

-10-

to the spot after gaining such information, rather the
dead body was shifted to the hospital prior to his
arrival to the spot. Although Aurangzeb ASI (PW-4)
stated to have prepared the injury sheet and inquest
report on the spot, however, PW-8 (identifier of the
dead body) admitted in his cross-examination that he
signed the inquest report at the time when his
statement was recorded in the hospital. In this view of
the matter, we discard testimony of the complainant
from consideration.

7. To believe or disbelieve a witness, it
entirely depends upon intrinsic value of the
statement made by him. Even otherwise, there
cannot be universal principle that in every case
interested witness shall be disbelieved or
disinterested witness shall be believed. It primarily
depends upon the rule of prudence and
reasonableness to hold that a particular witness was
present at the scene of crime and that he is making a
true statement. A person who is reported otherwise
to be very honest, above board and very respectable
in society, if gives a statement, which is illogical
and unbelievable, no prudent man despite his
nobility would accept such statement. As a rule of
criminal jurisprudence, prosecution evidence is not
tested on the basis of quantity but quality of the

evidence. It is not the person but the statement of
-ll-

that person which is to be seen and adjudged. In case
titled “Abdul Jabbar and another Vs. The State”

(2019 SCMR 129), it has been held that:-

“At the cost of reiteration, it has been
observed by us that, in a case, where
the learned appellate court, after
reappraisal of entire evidence available
on record, has reached the conclusion
that there is unexplained delay in
lodging the FIR; the presence of eye-
witnesses is not established; there are
irreparable dents in the case of the
prosecution; the recovery is ineffective
and is of no consequence; the ocular
account is belied by the medical
evidence; the motive behind the
occurrence is far from being proved
and almost non-existent, the said Court
fell in gross error in maintaining the
conviction of _ the appellants
particularly on a capital charge”.

In another case reported as “Irfan Ali Vs.
the State” (2015 SCMR 840), it was held by the
Apex Court that:-

“To award a capital punishment in a
murder crime, it is imperative for the
prosecution to lead unimpeachable
evidence of a first degree, which
ordinarily must get strong corroboration
from other independent evidence if the
witnesses are interested or inimical
towards the accused. In a criminal trial
no presumption can be drawn against
the accused person as it is a cardinal
principle of justice that no one should be
construed into a crime without legal
prooffevidence, sufficient to be acted
upon. No care and caution was observed
in the present case in light of this
principle. No evidence of believable
nature was led with regard to the motive
in the case to lend support to the
prosecution version”.
-12-

8. So far as recovery of pistol, allegedly
used in the commission of offence is concerned,
suffice it to say that the same was allegedly recovered
by Minhaj Sikandar Circle Officer, who was
examined before the trial Court as PW-6. As per
prosecution version, although accused Shehzad was
given specific role of firing with pistol at the
deceased, however, pistol was allegedly recovered by
PW-6 from residential room of co-accused Irfan. It is
quite surprising to note that PW-6 in his cross-
examination admitted that the alleged house was
abandoned house and doors were opened at that time.
Neither he was aware of number of rooms nor he was
in a position to tell that from which room the alleged
recovery was effected. This Court is also conscious
that Section 103, Cr.P.C. would apply to a case where
the police conducts search of the house/place to
recover a thing for which search is to be made and not
to a case where anything is to be discovered in
consequence of the information given by or on the
pointation of the accused, however, in the present
case, as stated above, the alleged recovery has not
been effected on pointation of accused Shehzad, who
has been charged for firing with pistol at the deceased
and that too, in the darkness of night. In view thereof,
such type of recovery and thereafter, positive report of

FSL become inconsequential, which could not be
-13-

relied upon for sustaining conviction on a capital
charge. Even otherwise, this piece of evidence
(recovery) is a corroborative one and in cases where
direct evidence fails, corroborative piece of evidence
is of no avail as in the instant case where direct
evidence of PWs have already been disbelieved. In
this behalf, reliance can be placed on the cases
reported as “Dr. Israr-ul-Haq_ Vs. Muhammad
Fayyaz__and_ another” _(2007__SCMR__1427

“Muhammad Jamil Vs. Muhammad Akram and
others” (2009 SCMR 120), “Abid Ali and 2 others
Vs. The State” (2011 SCMR_ 208), “Muhammad
Nawaz and others Vs. The State and others” (2016
SCMR_ 267) and “Tariq Zaman Vs. Muhammad
Shafi Khan and 2 others” (2018 MLD Peshawar
854).

9. So far as call data record is concerned,
suffice it to say that call data record is not a
conclusive piece of evidence to ascertain the guilt or
otherwise of an accused. CDR in isolation does not
advance the prosecution’s case until and unless some
credible material in this regard has been collected. The
Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in case

reported as “Mian Khalid Perviz Vs. The State

through Special Prosecutor ANF and another”

(2021 SCMR 522) has held that:-
-14-

“Mere production of CDR DATA
without transcripts of the calls or end
to end audio recording cannot be
considered/used as evidence worth
reliance. Besides the call transcripts, it
should also be established on the
record that callers on both the ends
were the same persons whose calls data
is being used in evidence. While
considering such type of evidence extra
care is required to be taken by the
Courts as advancement of science and
technology, on the other hand, has also
made it very convenient and easy to
edit and make changes of one's choice
as highlighted and discussed in the
case of Ishtiag Abmad Mirza supra. We
also can lay hand on the case of Azeem
Khan vy. Mujahid Khan (2016 SCMR
274) in this regard”.

10. The overall impact of what has been
discussed above is that the prosecution has
miserably failed to establish the case against the
appellants. Resultantly, this and connected
Cr.A.No.34-D/2022, filed by convict/appellant
Muhammad Shehzad are allowed, the impugned
judgment is set aside and the appellants are acquitted
from the charges levelled against them. They shall be
released forthwith, if not required to be detained in
connection with any other criminal case. Since we
have set aside the conviction and sentence awarded to
the appellant, therefore, the connected criminal appeal

against acquittal of co-accused as well as criminal
-15-
revision for enhancement of sentence have become
infructuous which stand dismissed accordingly.

11. Above are the detailed reasons of our short

order of even date.
