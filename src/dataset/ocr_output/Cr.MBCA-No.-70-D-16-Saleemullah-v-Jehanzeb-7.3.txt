Date of hearing 08.3.2018

Appellant-petitioner By: M/S Abdur Rashid Khan and Farooq

Respondent By: M/S Saleem Ullah Khan Ranazai and Ahmad

Ali Khan Marwat Advocate and Adnan Ali Khan AAG

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- Through instant Cr. MBCA No.
70-D/2016, filed under section 497(5) Cr.P.C, the petitioner
Saleemullah Khan seeks cancellation of post arrest bail of
respondent No.l in case FIR No.22 dated 05.01.2016
registered under Sections 489-F/420/468/471 PPC at police
station Cantt, D.I.Khan.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on 13.12.2015, the
complainant Saleemullah submitted an application to the
District Police Officer, D.I.-Khan, alleging therein, that the
accused/respondent issued a cheque bearing No.2247738499
as a settlement of the dispute over the payment of money. The
cheque in question was bounced when presented to the bank
concerned for encashment. The report of the complainant was
recorded vide daily diary report No. 41 dated 04.01.2015 and

after inquiry, it was held that cognizable offence has been
-2-

committed by the accused, which resulted in registration of the
FIR.

3. Having failed to get concession of the bail from the
learned lower fora the petitioner applied for post arrest bail
before this Court through Cr.Mise No. 18-D/2016. Vide order
dated 25.8.2016, the accused was granted conditional bail, but
the conditions as enumerated in the bail granting order was not
honoured by the respondent (as alleged), hence, this petition.

4. It has mainly been argued by the learned counsel
for the complainant that while granting post arrest bail certain
conditions were imposed upon the respondent No. 1 which
were not honoured by him; that neither the arbitrators for
settlement of the disputed were contacted within 15 days from
the date of passing of the order nor petition filed under section
22-A(6) Cr.P.C was withdrawn, thus, the accused misused the
concession of bail, therefore, his bail is liable to be recalled.

5. Conversely, the learned counsel for the respondent
argued that respondent No. | is a law abiding citizen of
Pakistan and he always honoured the order passed by the
Court. In pursuance of the conditional order dated 25.11.2016,
passed by this Court, arbitrators were appointed and they
resolved the dispute between the parties which is reflected
from arbitration award dated 16.3.2016, wherein the parties as
well as arbitrators put their signatures but even after lapse of
considerable time petitioner neither acted upon the arbitration

award nor honoured the compromise produced before this
-3-

Court; that the allegations of misused of the concession of bail
is false, frivolous and after thought; that the petitioner was
reluctant to act upon the arbitration award and deviated from
the same, therefore, petition under section 22-A(6) Cr.P.C was
not withdrawn. He lastly prayed for dismissal of the petition
for cancellation of bail.

6. Arguments heard and record perused.

7. Before going to the merits of the case it will be
advantageously to reproduce the relevant portion of bail
granting order passed in Cr.MBA No. 18-D/2016 dated
25.01.2016, whereby the respondent was granted post arrest
bail, as under:-

Facts of the case needs no narration because
the parties have patched up the matter
conditionally and the complainant has got no
objection over release of the petitioner on bail.
In this respect, an affidavit sworn by the
complainant duly signed and attested by M/S
Ahmad Ali Khan and Farooq Akhtar Khan,
counsel for the parties was produced before the
court, vide which the parties have appointed
Arbitrators for settlement of the dispute
within fifteen days from today which would be
binding upon them and in case the dispute
could not be settled within the stipulated
period, the complainant would be at liberty to
move for cancellation of the bail so granted to
the petitioner and that the petitioner would
also withdrawn his application filed under

section 22-A (6) Cr.P.C.
-4-

8. A bare reading of the order referred above reflects
that the accused was released on bail conditionally. It was
observed by this Court that the parties shall settle the dispute
through arbitrators and if the dispute cannot be settled within
15 days from the date of passing of order dated 25.01.2016, the
complainant would be at liberty to move an application for
cancellation of bail so granted and the respondent No.1 would
withdraw the application under section 22-A(6) Cr.P.C moved
by him for registration of the case against the petitioner, and
failing to comply with the conditions enumerated in the
affidavit would result the withdrawal of the order of this Court.
The learned counsel representing the respondents produced the
arbitration award dated 16.3.2016, wherein both the parties
participated and arbitrators gave their award. The respondent
No.1 as well as his counsel(s) submitted at the bar that they are
willing and ready to act upon the arbitration award submitted
by the arbitrators and also bound by the terms and conditions
incorporated in the compromise deed in shape of affidavit
produced before the Court in earlier round of litigation.

9. In my view the conditions stipulated in the order
of this court dated 25.01.2016 were complied with. It was also
pointed out that the parties are wrapped in civil litigations
which are sub judice before the Court of competent jurisdiction
regarding the same subject matter, thus no case is made out to

recall the concession of bail already granted by this Court.
-5-

10. For what has been discussed above, the petition in

hand, being devoid of merits is dismissed.
