SAHIBZADA_ ASADULLAH, J.- Being booked in
case FIR No.424 dated 13.11.2018, registered under
Sections 302/324//34 PPC at police station Parova,
District D.I.Khan, accused/petitioners have approached
this Court for their release on bail. Earlier, vide order
dated 04.5.2020, they were declined bail by the Court of
learned Judge MCAC/ Additional Sessions Judge/Duty
Judge, D.I.Khan.
2. Brief account of the prosecution story, as
disclosed in the FIR, is that on 13.11.2018, complainant
Habib Ullah brought the dead body of his brother Gul
Zaman and made report in the Emergency Room of Civil
Hospital, Parova, to the effect that on the eventful day he

alongwith his brother Gul Zaman, father Inayatullah,
-2-

Muhammad Hanif, Muhammad Rafique and Mehboob
went to CRBC canal near Saifal No.3 within limits of
Jhok Abdullah and were busy to function fan of the
tractor, it was about 0730 hours, when accused
Muhammad Ashraf, armed with 303 bore rifle,
Dr. Ghulam Shabbir and Saeed, both armed with
Kalashnikovs, came there and started firing at them, as
result thereof, his brother Gul Zaman got hit and fell to
the ground, while they escaped unhurt luckily; they tried
to overpower the accused who succeeded to escape from
the spot, however, the accused/petitioner threw his 303
rifle, which was picked up by the complainant. The
injured succumbed to his injuries on the way to hospital
in a motorcar. Besides the complainant, the occurrence
was stated to be witnessed by his afore-named
companions of the complainant. Motive for the offence
was stated to be a dispute over lands. He charged the
accused for gatl-i-amd of his brother and ineffective
firing at him and his companions. On the report of the
complainant, instant case vide the captioned FIR was
registered against the accused.

3. The learned counsel representing the
petitioners argued threadbare that the accused/petitioners
are innocent and have falsely been involved in the case;
that the petitioners were not present on the spot at the

time of occurrence and were out of their village for
-3-

earning livelihood, but they have been made a scapegoat
for ulterior motives; that no independent person has been
cited as witness to support the prosecution version; that
the co-accused Dr. Ghulam Shabbir has been acquitted
by learned trial Court on 18.10.2019, therefore, on this
score too, the case of petitioners requires further probe,
being at par with the acquitted co-accused where the
learned trial Court has disbelieved the entire prosecution
evidence during trial of co-accused. The learned counsel
for the petitioners further argued that once prosecution
witnesses are disbelieved with respect to co-accused,
then they cannot be relied upon in respect of other co-
accused. He prayed that keeping in view the facts and
circumstances of the case, accused/petitioners deserve to
be enlarged on bail.

4. On the contrary, the learned Asstt: A.G.
assisted by learned counsel for the complainant argued
that the occurrence took place in a broad daylight, so no
question arises with regard to mistaken identity,
particularly when the parties are known to each other
and the complainant has charged them with a specific
motive. He further argued that while fleeing from the
spot, the accused/petitioner threw his 303 bore rifle
which was picked up by complainant and handed over to
police and the same alongwith two empties of 303 bore

recovered by the Investigating Officer during spot
-4-

inspection giving smell of fresh discharge was sent to
the FSL where it was opined that the recovered empties
were fired from same 303 bore rifle. He further argued
that acquittal of co-accused is no ground to release the
petitioners on bail, as the evidence against them is still to
be analyzed by the trial Court. He also submitted that no
credible evidence is available on the file which could
justify plea of alibi taken by the petitioners. He lastly
submitted that the material available on the file connects
the accused/petitioners with the commission of offence
falling within the ambit of prohibitory limb of Section
497, Cr.P.C., therefore, they do not deserve the
concession of bail.

5. Arguments of learned counsel for the
petitioners, the learned Asstt: A.G. assisted by learned
counsel for the complainant heard and with their able
assistance the record of the case was scrutinized from
cover to cover.

6. On scanning of the record, it surfaced that
the accused/petitioners have been directly charged for
commission of the offence. It is a broad daylight
occurrence, so no question of mistaken or false
implication arises inasmuch as the parties are known to
each other. Moreover, the investigating agency, during
spot inspection, took into possession two empties of 303

bore rifle giving smell of fresh discharge and also
-5-

secured blood from the spot. The two empties recovered
from the spot by the Investigating Officer and 303 bore
rifle thrown by the accused/petitioner while decamping
from the spot were sent to the FSL, where it was opined
that the same were fired from the said 303 bore rifle.
Furthermore, at the moment no evidence is available on
the file which could suggest that on the day of
occurrence, the petitioners were away from their village
in connection with earning their livelihood.

7. So far as argument of learned counsel for
the petitioners regarding acquittal of co-accused
Dr. Ghulam Shabbir by the trial Court is concerned,
suffice it to say that the acquittal of co-accused would
not benefit the accused/petitioners for the reason that
evidence collected by the investigating agency against

the petitioners is yet to be analyzed by the trial Court.
In case titled Habibullah Vs. Qadir Khan
& two others (2018 P.Cr.L.J. Peshawar [Bannu Bench]

481), it was held that:-

“True that in all cases co-accused have
been acquitted at an earlier trial held
before different courts, but whether
acquittal of co-accused would entitle the
accused/petitioners for concession of
bail, who were arrested subsequently
sitting on the fence, while watching the
proceedings of their co-accused, who
were arrested or surrendered earlier
and faced the trial as an under trial
prisoners. Answer is in negative, as
evidence recorded in absence of
accused/ petitioners in the case of their
acquitted co-accused cannot be taken
-6-

into consideration, neither at bail stage
nor during trial. Fate of the case of the
accused/petitioners would be decided
on the evidence recorded in their
presence and believing or disbelieving
of evidence is the exclusive domain of
trial court, where it will form its own
opinion after recording of evidence in
presence of the accused/petitioners. It is
not necessary that the trial court will
come to same conclusion which was
arrived at the trial of co-accused”.

In this respect, reliance can also be made to

the case law reported as Akbar Said Vs. Moambar and
another (2017 Cr.L.J. Peshawar Note 137).
8. Besides the above, the petitioners remained
fugitive from law for more than one and half year till
their arrest on 20.02.2020. Needless to say that no
explanation whatsoever is available on record which
could justify this long abscondence.

It is settled law that fugitive from law
loses some of the normal rights granted by the
procedural and substantive law and_ noticeable
abscondence disentitles the absconder to the
concession of bail notwithstanding merits of the case,
guidance can be gathered from the cases reported as
Awal Khan and others Vs. The State (PLD 1985 S.C.
402) and Raza Khan Vs. State (2013 MLD Peshawar-
810).

9. The available circumstances prima facie

connect the accused/petitioners with the commission of

the offence which squarely attracts the prohibitory limb
-7-

of Section 497, Cr.P.C. Thus I hold the
accused/petitioners are not entitled to the concession of
bail. Resultantly, this bail petition is dismissed.

10. Before parting with this order, it is directed
that any observations recorded in this order, being purely
tentative in nature, shall in no way prejudice the
proceedings before the learned trial Court where the case
be decided on its own merits after recording evidence.
Announced.

Dt: 29.5.2020.
