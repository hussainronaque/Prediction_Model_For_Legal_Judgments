The crime was reported by complainant

Bilal Khan (PW-7) to Ghulam Muhammad Khan ASI

on 27.02.2009 at 1130 hours in Police Post Shahbaz

Khel. While narrating the occurrence the complainant
alleged that on the fateful day, he, alongwith his

brothers namely Enjar Nawaz, Karim Nawaz, deceased

mother Mst. Man Bibi and sister Asmat Bibi alongwith

other inmates were present in the courtyard of his

house; that it was 09.00 a.m time when the appellant/

accused Habibullah son of Nizam Khan alongwith

others absconding accused Farmanullah, Habib Shah

alias Bisha sons of Ghazi khan, Habibullah and

Kalimullah sons of Abdullah Khan, duly armed with

Kalashnikovs entered into their house and started firing

at them as a result, his mother Mst. Man Bibi got hit and

fell to the ground while they escaped unhurt as they

took shelter inside the rooms of their house and the

accused decamped from the spot; that when they

attended their mother she was died. Beside him, the

occurrence was also witnessed by other inmates of the

house. Motive for the crime was that absconding

accused Farmanullah and Bisha had stolen their Cock

from their house. The complaint was made to present

appellant/accused Habibullah. His report was entered in
Daily diary vide Mad No.4 dated 27.02.2009, the

contents of which were read over to him and he put his

signature on it as a token of its correctness. He has also

prepared injury sheet and inquest report of the deceased

and send the dead-body under the escort of Constable

Javed to RHC Tattar Khel for PM examination, while

copy of Naqal Mad was sent to the Police station Pezu

for registration of case, the contents of which were

incorporated in shape of FIR No.94 dated 27.02.2009

under sections 302/ 324/ 452/ 148/ 149 PPC Police

station Pezu, Lakki by Rehmatullah ASI (PW-2).

4. One Bashir Khan S.J (PW-10) on receipt of

copy of FIR went to the spot, prepared the site plan

(Ex.PB) at the pointation of complainant as well as eye

witness Injar Nawaz and Karim Nawaz, collected blood

stained earth from the place of deceased, 12 empties of

7.62 bore from the place of the accused with 2 spent

bullets from the court yard of complainant’s house vide

Recovery memo Ex.PR. He also secured garments of

the deceased vide memo Ex.PR/1. The Chemical
Examiner’s report to that effect is Ex.PK. He also sent

the crime empties to the Arms Expert and placed on

record his report as Ex.PK/1. He recorded the

statements of the witnesses and on completion of

investigation, he handed over the case file to the SHO

for challan against the accused party in their absence.

5. Dr. Humera Tahir WMO RHC Tattar Khel

(PW-9) had conducted autopsy on 27.02.2009 at 1.00

p.m of the dead body of Mst. Man Bibi and in this

respect, she admitted her signature on PM report

Ex.P.M as correct.

6. At the conclusion of investigation and after

arrest of the appellant, charge-sheet was filed in the trial

court where-after the prosecution examined (10) PWs in

all. After conclusion of trial, the learned trial court has

convicted and sentenced the  appellant/accused

Habibullah as above, vide impugned judgment dated

29.11.2012.
Perusal of record reveals that as per FIR, the occurrence

took place on 27.2.2009 at 0900 hours whereas the

complainant Bilal Khan alongwith his brother Enjar

Nawaz and his sister Mst. Asmat Bibi reported the

matter at Police post Shahbaz Khel to Ghulam

Muhammad ASI at 1130 hours with a delay of about 2

’% hours. As the report has been lodged to nearby PP not

at the Police station or in the hospital which are far

away from the place of occurrence, hence, in such

circumstances, one could easily infer that the report has

been lodged with consultation and deliberations by

spreading wide net. Moreover, brother of the

complainant and his sister being eye witness of the

occurrence were present with the complainant at the

time of lodging report but none of them has signed or

thumb impressed the report as rider.

8. As the ocular account would play a

decisive role in the case, therefore, we would consider

the same first.
9. The complainant Bilal Khan appeared and

recorded his statement as PW-7 wherein he narrated the

same facts as mentioned in the FIR, however, he made

some improvements at the trial, by stating that all the

accused entered into the house jointly and scattered in

the court yard and started firing at once. His statement

is not only smeared with improvements but also

contradictory one, as PW-8 Enjar Nawaz who is

allegedly eye witness of the occurrence altogether

different story by stating that:-

“First of all, accused Farmanullah
and Habib Shah alias  Bisha
entered our house and on entering
our house, these two accused
started firing upon us a during the
firing of those accused, we entered
the room of our house and took

shelter in the room”

This PW made further improvement by stating that:-

“Accused Farmanullah and Habib Shah

when entered the house, they took
position near the door of the house,
situated at front of the entrance and they
did not make any fire during this, then
other accused entered the house and took
positions. After taking positions accused

party started firing”

10. The prosecution produced the complainant

as well one eye witness as PWs 7 and 8, the

statements of both the PWs are contradictory to each

other and full of improvements and such improvements

made by the witnesses in their statements subsequently

to strengthen the prosecution case would lose their

credibility and evidentiary value, hence could not be

relied upon. Further their testimonies are suffering from

glaring contradictions and discrepancies creating doubts

about their presence at the spot at the time of incident.

Reliance is place on case titled “Abdur Rahman Vs

Fateh Sher _& 8 others” (1996 SCMR 176), “Akhtar

Ali_& others Vs_The_ state” (2008 SCMR_ 6) and

“Muhammad _Rafique_and_others Vs_the State _and

others” (2010 SCMR 3835).
11. The complainant as well as eye witness

Enjar Nawaz are brothers interse and _ having

relationship of mother and sons with the deceased,

hence both the witnesses are closely related to the

deceased and interested one. Court could not base

conviction of accused solely on the testimony of

interested witnesses, unless such evidence finds

corroboration by some other independent and

impeachable piece of evidence. In the instant case, both

the PWs have made sufficient improvements and

contradicted each other and further does not corroborate

with the other pieces of evidence, hence the conviction

on such statement could not be awarded. The learned

trial court has fallen into error by not appreciating the

evidence in accordance with law and based conviction

mere on the basis of surmises and conjectures and

escaped the contradictions and improvements

mentioned above.

12. Statement of Bashir Khan SI, who is IO of

the case examined as PW-10 too does not corroborate
10

with the facts and circumstances of the case and is not

worth reliable as during cross examination he admitted

that during spot inspection the complainant had not

made pointation of the rooms where they took shelter,

although had stated to him that they took shelter in three

of the rooms of the spot house. He further stated that

during spot inspection nobody pointed him the bullet

marks present on the surrounding walls.

13. Further the IO had sent 12 empties of 7.62

bore to the FSL for Arms expert opinion and result s

available on file as Ex.PK/1 which shows that all the

crime empties were fired from one and the same 7.62

MM bore weapon, meaning thereby that the instant

occurrence is the job of one person whereas the

complainant had spread wide net. Moreover as per

version of complainant the dispute of stealing a Cock

was with the absconding accused Farmanullah and

Habib Shah alias Bisha whereas the complainant

charged five accused in all for the alleged occurrence. If

all the five accused had fired through Kalashnikov
11

rifles, fully automatic weapons then, in that case, there

was no occasion for the eye witnesses and inmates of

the crime house to be escaped unhurt, rather substantial

damage would have been caused to the deceased and

others. This fact would clearly show that the number of

accused and the charge both are highly exaggerated.

14. In view the above facts, the case of the

prosecution appears to be replete with grave doubts with

regard to the manner of the occurrence as well as the

participation of a large number of accused. These

doubtful aspects, in view of the principles of law and

justice, have to be resolved in favour of the accused-

appellant.

In the case of “Muhammad Jehangir alias

Badshah and Muhammad Naveed Vs. The State”

(NLR 1995 Cr.SC 688) the Hon’ble Apex Court has

laid down the following principles:-
“Corroborative evidence must be

exceptionally strong and sufficient enough

when eye-witnesses have judiciously been
12

found capable of involving an innocent
person and attributing him main role of

murder.”
Further held that:-

“Court would not be able to sift grain
from chaff when prosecution case is
pregnant with serious doubts and there is

confusion and darkness all around.”
It was further held that:-

“Presence of witnesses on the spot does
not mean that they are witnesses of truth.
Acid test of veracity of a witness is
inherent merit of his own statement. Eye-
witnesses not only exaggerating number
of assailants but also falsely implicating
an innocent person. They going to extent
of assigning falsely major role of murder
to accused for which he could be hanged.
They showing reckless disregard not only
for truth but for human life as well. Held:
Corroborative evidence qua each accused
would imperative for relying on such

ocular evidence.”

It was further held by the Hon’ble Apex Court
that:-

“a single doubt if found reasonable
would entitle the accused to acquittal and
not a bundle of doubts.” (Please see the
case of “Riaz Masih alias Mithoo Vs. The
State” (NLR 1995 Cr.SC 694).
13

15. To carry conviction on a capital charge, the

ocular account, in all circumstances, must come from

unimpeachable source; otherwise, evidence short of

such standard cannot be infused life to place reliance on

it even if it is corroborated. Reliance in this regard is

placed on the view held by the Hon’ble Apex Court in

the case of “Asghar Ali Vs. The State” (1992 SCMR

2088).

Same and similar was the view of Lahore

High Court Lahore in the case of “Jahangir Hayat Vs.

The State” (PLD 1999 Lahore 285) wherein the

testimony was held to have not come from

unimpeachable source, thus, in a case of single accused

the death sentence awarded was set aside.

17. For what has been discussed above, this

appeal is allowed. Conviction and sentences of the

appellant namely, Habibullah son of Naizam Khan,

recorded by the learned trial Judge vide impugned

judgment dated 29.11.2012 are set aside and he is
14

acquitted of all the charges, leveled against him. He be

set at liberty forthwith, if not required in any other case.

The above are the reasons of my short
order of the even date.
