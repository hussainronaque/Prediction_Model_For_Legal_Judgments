QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- Having been
charged and arrested for offence under
Sections 377 PPC read with Section 511
PPC vide FIR No.295 dated 08.06.2015,
registered in Police Station Nawansheher,
Abbottabad, the accused/petitioner
Waseem Bashir, approached the Courts
below for bail but without success, hence
the instant petition for post arrest bail in
the aforementioned case.

2. The report was lodged at 2020

hours on 08.06.2015 by Abid Sarfaraz,
\

\\

complainant/respondent No.2, who alleged
that his 5/6 years old son namely Hanzala
Sarfaraz who was a student of Prep class
was being taught Holy Quran by the
accused/petitioner and when at evening
time mother of the minor child namely Mst
Neelam Rani went to the ‘Baittak’ to
inquire about the child from the
accused/petitioner, she saw the
accused/petitioner to have removed
rousers of her son who was crying while
sitting in the lap of the accused/petitioner.
On the hue and cry of mother of the child,
Ihsan Ali son of Khurshid and Haji Abdul
Waheed son of Muhammad Aslam Khan
reached the scene of occurrence and
caught hold of the  ‘Qari’/accused-
petitioner, who started begging for
apology, but was handed over in the same
condition to the police which reached the

spot and received a written complaint
~

against the accused/petitioner from the
complainant.

3. After registration of the case, the
minor child was got medically examined,
and the Medical Officer furnished the

following report;

“Case _of Sodomy. On P/R

examination redness around
and canal, tight spastic and
sphincter, on further
examination mucosal tear

_ (extensive) about 4 x 5 cm at
2-4 O'clock position-1 cm from
anal verge, deep examination
was painful”

The Medical Officer also took anal
swab and referred the child to surgical
ward for examination of anal tear, but
report of the surgical ward was not found
available on the record. Likewise, the
accused/petitioner was got medically
examined and was found able to perform

sex. The anal swab of the victim taken by
the Medical Officer at the time of his
medical examination along with garments
of the accused/petitioner as well as the
victim were sent to the FSL, but the result
received there-from was in the negative.
After recording statements of mother of
the victim, and witnesses namely Ihsan Ali
and Abdul Waheed, mentioned by the
complainant in the FIR, and completion of
investigation, the local police/SHO Police
Station Nawansheher submitted complete
challan in the case on 12.06.2015.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for
the accused/petitioner, Raja Muhammad
Zubair, learned State Counsel, assisted by
counsel for complainant heard, and record
perused.

5. The FIR has been lodged by the
father of the victim aged about 5/6 years
with utmost promptitude, wherein, the
accused/petitioner is directly charged for

the despicable act, which becomes more
abhorable when seen in light of the fact
that a minor child of 5/6 years has been
subjected to the alleged act by the
‘Qari’/accused-petitioner who was
employed to Teach Holy Quran to the
victim, a student of prep class.

6. Apart from the fact that no parents
would bring such a_ nasty charge about
their minor child when there is not even a
distant suggestion to impute malafide to
the parents of the child of very tender age,
the eye witness account of mother of the
victim, corroborated by the two persons
mentioned in the FIR in their statements
under section 161 Cr.PC, together with
medical report showing redness around
anal canal and the mucosal tear
(extensive) about 4 x 5 cm at 2-4 O'clock
position-1 cm from anal verge, is too
overwhelming evidence on the available
record to prima facie connect the

accused/petitioner with the commission of
OT tlie Pe

the offence. In the circumstances, the
negative report of FSL would have no
significance, more-so, when there is no
allegation of penetration and ejaculation.
{2000 P.Cr.L.J 313 (Karachi), 2007
SCMR_ 698, 2009 P.Cr.LJ 978
(Peshawar) and 2000 P.Cr.L.J 33
(Lahore)}.

7. Having gone through the record,
there appears no reason to extend the
concession of bail to ‘the
accused/petitioner. The bail petition. is,

therefore, dismissed.

Announced.
