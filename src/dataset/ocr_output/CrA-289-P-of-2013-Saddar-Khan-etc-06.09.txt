JUDGMENT

LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- Through
this judgment, we shall also decide the
criminal revision petition bearing No.73-P of
2013 as both the matters are the outcome of
same judgment dated 30.05.2013 of the
learned Sessions Judge, Hangu delivered in
case FIR No.59 dated 27.01.2012
u/ss 302/324/34 PPC of Police Station City,
Hangu whereby appellants Saddar Khan
and Nasveel Khan have been convicted and
sentenced u/s 302(b) PPC to imprisonment
for life with compensation of Rs.2,00,000/-
each to be paid to the legal heirs of
deceased Ashraf Khan as envisaged in
Section 544-A Cr.P.C. The appellants have
further been convicted u/s 324/34 PPC for

their firing at complainant Jan Said and
sentenced to one year R.I. with fine of
Rs.10,000/- each or in default whereof to
further undergo one month — simple
imprisonment. Benefit u/s 382-B Cr.P.C.
has been extended to the appellants, who
have impugned their convictions and
sentences while the complainant Jan Said
too has filed a criminal revision for
enhancement of the sentences from life
imprisonment to the normal penalty of
death. As both the matters have arisen from
the same judgment, therefore, are being

decided through this single judgment.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on
27.01.2012, complainant Jan Said (PW-2)
reported to ASI Shaukat Hussain (PW-7) in
the emergency room of Civil Hospital,
Hangu to the effect that he and his father
were returning from Hangu bazaar to their
house and when they reached at the place
of occurrence, there both the appellants
emerged and opened firing at them with
which his father was hit and critically injured
while he escaped unhurt. The injured was
taken to the hospital where he succumbed

to his injuries.

3. After completion of the investigation,
complete challan was put in court where
both the accused were indicted for the crime
to which they pleaded not guilty. In order to
prove its case, prosecution examined 10
witnesses whereafter statements of the
accused were recorded, wherein, by refuting
the prosecution case, they professed their
innocence. The learned trial court after
conclusion of the trial found both the
accused guilty of the charge and on
conviction sentenced them as mentioned

above.

4. Learned counsel for the appellants,
while opposing the impugned judgment,
argued that complainant Jan Said was not
present with his father when the incident
had taken place and that his attendance
was procured subsequently to give impetus
to the prosecution case. He argued that no
worth reliable evidence has been produced
by the prosecution to establish its case
against the appellants. The learned counsel
also argued that the solitary eye version
account furnished by the complainant gets

no corroboration from — circumstantial

Sadig Shah PS
evidence of the case, therefore, no
credence could be given to it. It was also
argued that motive, as alleged in the FIR,

too has not been proved.

5. As against the above, learned
counsel for the complainant assisted by
learned AAG defended the impugned
judgment by arguing that the prosecution
has successfully proved its case against the
appellants. He also argued that there were
no mitigating circumstances for awarding
lesser penalty to the appellants, therefore,
by accepting the criminal revision, the

convicts be awarded the normal penalty of

death.

6. Arguments heard and record gone
through.

7. As the prosecution’s case mainly

hinges on the solitary statement of the
complainant, who happens to be a son of
the deceased, therefore, we would
scrutinize the case evidence with utmost
care and caution. No doubt, in a criminal
case, conviction can be recorded on the

testimony furnished by a solitary and related

Sadig Shah PS
eyewitness provided same is _ sufficiently
corroborated by circumstantial aspects of
the case. If circumstantial evidence of the
case is in conflict with the solitary
eyewitness account, then conviction cannot
be recorded on such evidence being a

century old principle of criminal law.

8. On the touchstone of the above, if we
look at the evidence furnished by PW-2 i.e.
the complainant, same _ hardly gets
corroboration from the circumstances of the
case. It is in the FIR that the complainant
and the deceased both were returning their
home after purchasing some commodities
from the bazaar but on the case file there is
no convincing evidence, which could
corroborate the version given by the
complainant that he had either gone with his
father to bazaar or was returning with him
when the occurrence had taken place as
none of the purchased domestic
commodities was produced before the
Investigating Officer. In addition to the
above, the occurrence had taken place at
17.25 hours on 27.01.2012 and the distance

in between the complainant and both the

Sadig Shah PS
convicts as per site plan (Ex.PB) is 73
paces, therefore, there arises the question
of proper identification of the appellants by
the complainant. Identification of an
accused by a witness from a distance of 73
paces in the month of January at 17.25
hours cannot easily be accepted as not only
at that time sunlight is decreased but
keeping in view the long distance it would
not possible for the viewer to properly
visualize the occurrence. (Wisdom is
derived from 2017 SCMR 1155 and 1977

SCMR 139.

9. Presence of the complainant on the
spot at the time of occurrence further
becomes doubtful from the fact that his
hands and clothes were not besmeared with
blood of the deceased despite the fact that
as per his deposition he had lifted his father
and took him to the hospital. Keeping in
view the multiple injuries on the body of the
deceased and oozing blood from the
wounds, it would have been natural that
hands and clothes of the complainant would
have been besmeared with blood had he

really been present on the spot and lifted

Sadig Shah PS
the deceased from the ground. Ibid aspect
of the case shows that at the critical
moment of the case the complainant was
not present at the crime venue. It is worth to
mention that as per testimony of PW-3 i.e.
Dr.Nawab Hussain, the deceased was
brought to the hospital by the police, which
aspect of the case shows that the
complainant was not present on the crime
venue when the occurrence had taken

place.

10. In addition, conduct of the
complainant too shows that he was not
present on the spot at the time of
occurrence as he did not call anyone of the
inmates of his house so as to apprise him
about the occurrence despite the fact that
his father was fired at just in front of his
house nor any one of inmates came out of
the house to know about the firing made just
near to the deceased’s house. Had the
complainant been present on the spot at the
time of occurrence, he must have made a
call to attract the inmates of his house to
inform them about the occurrence. The

unnatural conduct of the complainant has

Sadig Shah PS
led us to believe that he was not with his

father when he was fired at.

11. Apart from the above, motive of the
case i.e. blood feud between the parties too
has not been proved. No doubt, proving of
motive is not necessary to bring home guilt
to an accused as crimes are often
committed without any motive but once a
motive is alleged in the FIR, then its non-
establishment becomes fatal for the
prosecution. Not only that motive has not
been proved by the prosecution but the
defence has taken the plea that the
appellants were falsely implicated in the
case as there was a money dispute
between the parties. The factum of dispute
between the parties regarding money
has been admitted by the Investigating
Officer in his court statement, who appeared
before the court as PW-10 and stated that
the appellants had stated to him about the

money dispute with the complainant's side.

12. No doubt, in support of its case, the
prosecution has relied upon the immediate
arrest of the appellants, recovery of

klashnikoves from their possession and the

Sadig Shah PS
matching of crime empties with the
recovered klashnikoves but ibid pieces of
evidence are of no help to the prosecution
as the recovered klashnikoves were kept
un-sealed till their examination on the
following day by the armourer, therefore, no
credence could be attached to them.
Besides, both the accused were arrested at
18.30 hours on 27.01.2012 when according
to PW-8, they were seen fleeing. It is worth
to mention that in the month of January at
18.30 hours, it would be very difficult to

identify a person holding a klashnikov.

13. Thorough and careful examination of
the case record has led this court to believe
that the prosecution has not proved its case
against the appellants beyond any shadow
of doubt, which is a hallmark of criminal
jurisprudence. The prosecution case is full
of doubts benefit of which must go to the
appellants being a century old principle of
criminal law. It appears to us that the
learned trial court has not appreciated the
case evidence in its true perspective and
has fallen in legal error to convict the

appellants.

14. For what has been discussed above,
we accept the appeal, set aside the
impugned judgment of conviction and acquit
the appellants of the charges leveled
against them. They be set free if not

required to be detained in any other case.

15. So far as the criminal revision is
concerned, as we have acquitted the
appellants, therefore, the criminal revision
has become infructuous, which is dismissed

as such.

16. Above are the reasons of our short
order of even date, which is reproduced as

under:-

“For the reasons to be recorded later, this
appeal is allowed, conviction and
sentence recorded by learned Sessions
Judge, Hangu vide impugned judgment
dated 30.05.2013 is set aside. The
appellants are acquitted of the charges
leveled against them and they be set free

forthwith, if not required in any other case.
