WIQAR AHMAD, J, — This order is directed
to dispose of Jail Criminal Appeal No. 1184-P
of 2019 filed by the appellant namely Shah Zal
son of Haider Khan prisoner at Central Prison
Bannu against judgment dated 21.02.2017 of
the erstwhile FATA Tribunal Peshawar. Appeal
dated 28.09.2019 was sent to this Court vide
letter 4635 dated 20.09.2019 of the
Superintendent Central Prison Bannu.

2. Brief facts of the case, relevant for
disposal of the instant appeal, are that the

accused/appellant namely Shah Zal Khan son

Nawab (S.B,) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
of Haider Khan resident of Khapyanga faced
trial along with other co-accused before the
Court of Political Agent Kurram Agency on the
charges of committing triple murder of the
victims namely Mir Bat Khan (deceased),
Fazle-e-Amin (deceased) and Nasir Khan
(deceased) and making an attempt at the lives
of Rafiq Shah and Irfanullah by firing at them
effectively on 05.03.2001 at 08:00 p.m. on the
place of occurrence. A council of elders had
been nominated by the Political Agent Kurram
after necessary investigation of the case. The
council of elders had returned _ their
award/verdict unanimously on the terms of
reference given to them, wherein the
accused/appellant had been found guilty of the
offence along with other co-accused namely
Muhammad Umar, Tariq Shah, Hakeem Khan

and Faraz Khan. The Political Agent Kurram

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
Agency vide his order dated 09.01.2002 had
convicted all the accused to 14 years rigorous
imprisonment under section 302 of the Pakistan
Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as
“PPC”) read with section 11 of the Frontier
Crimes Regulation, 1901 (hereinafter referred
to as “FCR”) (repealed) on each account and
also to pay a fine of Rs. 500,000/- each, or in
default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a
term of 5 years each. A sentence of 10 years
under section 307 PPC had also been awarded -
to the appellant and other co-accused on two
counts. The sentences were ordered to run
consecutively. On realization of fine, Rs. one
lac was ordered to be paid to legal heirs of
deceased and Rs. 50,000/- to each injured.
Appeal was filed against the judgment of
conviction before the Court of Commissioner

FCR Kohat. On acceptance of which the

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
judgment of conviction dated 09.01.2002 was
set aside and the case was remanded to the
Political Agent Kurram Agency for denovo trial
in line with local Rewaj of TORIZONA.

3. Feeling aggrieved from the said
judgment, the prosecutor concerned filed a
revision petition before the Tribunal FCR
(former) which was accepted vide judgment
dated 26.04.2003 to the effect that the
judgment of Commissioner FCR dated
02.04.2002 was set aside and that the Political
Agent Kurram Agency dated 09.01.2002 was
restored. The convict then filed a writ petition
No. 1154 of 2007 before this Court, which was
heard along with other connected petitions and it
was finally decided that the sentences were
ordered to run concurrently, The petitions for
leave to appeal were filed before the Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan. The Hon’ble Apex

Court was pleased to convert the petitions into

‘Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
appeals and allowed the same by setting aside
the judgment of this Court dated 04.12.2008.

4. The appellant was undergoing his
sentence when he had filed another jail
criminal appeal dated 16.11.2015, forwarded
by the Superintendent Central Prison Bannu
vide his letter No. 4670 dated 18.11.2015 to the
Registrar of FATA Tribunal Peshawar. The
said appeal was dismissed vide order dated
21.02.2017 of the FATA Tribunal (former).
The appellant had filed the instant appeal
against the last mentioned order.

5. Learned counsel for the appellant
submitted during the course of his arguments
that the consecutive running of the sentences
awarded to the appellant had been against the
basic principle of law, particularly section 71 of
the PPC and sections 12 & 13 of the FCR. He

further added that since FCR had been repealed

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-6-

by way of 2st ‘Constitutional Amendment to
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of
Pakistan, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as “the
Constitution”), therefore the consecutive
running of the sentences should be reviewed
according to law and principles of criminal
dispensation of justice prevalent in the country.
6. The learned Astt: A.G, however
opposed the arguments of learned counsel for
the appellant and stated that the issue had been
a past and closed transaction, which could not
be re-agitated.

7. I have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the appellant as well as learned
Astt:A.G. for the State and perused the record.
8. Perusal of record reveals that this
Court had earlier allowed the writ petition of
the petitioner/appellant after finding the order

of consecutive running of the sentences to be

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
against law, particularly sections 12 & 13 of
the FCR as well as section 71 of the PPC. The
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan while
hearing petitions for leave to appeal in the case
in hand against the judgment of this Court, had
held as follows;

“Clause of Article 247 of the
Constitution unambiguously excludes the
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the
High Court in the matters relating to the
Federal Administered Tribal Area. The
controversy regarding the extent, to which
this jurisdiction is ousted, has been settled
by this Court in case of “Qaum Bangash”
(Supra). In criminal matters, it has been
held, that the determining factor ousting
jurisdiction of the High Court and the
Supreme Court under clause 7 of Article
247 of the Constitution is the location of the
commission of crime. If committed in the
tribal area, the jurisdiction of the Superior
Courts would stand excluded. This principle
has been consistently followed since then.
The legality or otherwise of an order passed
by any forum exercising powers under the
F.C.R. could have been examined by the
High Court only if it possess jurisdiction
under Article 199 of the Constitution. As
held the High Court did not possess
jurisdiction over trial under the F.C.R of
crimes committed in the Tribal Area, If on
the one hand the sentences on three counts
of imprisonment of 14 years have been
ordered to run consecutively and the
respondents feel aggrieved of the same, on
the other hand, they have benefited from the
trial under the F.C.R for being sentenced to
only imprisonment after having been found
guilty of murdering three young men. The
impugned judgment of the High Court
could not be sustained in law on another

‘Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
ground. The writ petitions were not
maintainable when the respondents’ earlier
writ petitions arising out of the same trial
were dismissed on account of the bar
contained under Article 247 (7) of the
Constitution.”

The judgment of this Court was
accordingly set aside by converting the
petitions into appeals and allowing the same.
The judgment of the FATA Tribunal dated
02.04.2002 which had upheld the conviction
and sentence dated 09.01.2002 of the Political
Agent Kurram Agency, was restored.

9. When the appellant filed the
second jail criminal appeal dated 16.11.2015
before FATA Tribunal, the matter had attained
finality and was a past and closed transaction.
The arguments of the learned counsel for
appellant that with the repeal of the FCR the
conviction and sentences of the appellant
should be reviewed, I am afraid, is not well
placed. FCR along with other regulations were

repealed as a result of the 25 Constitutional

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
Amendment to the Constitution. The
controversy in hand would therefore be
governed by Article 264 of the Constitution.
The said article being relevant is reproduced

hereunder for ready reference;

264. Effect or repeal of laws.

Where a law is repealed or is deemed to have been
repealed, by, under, or by virtue of the Constitution, the
repeal shall not except as otherwise provided in the
constitution,

(a) revive anything not in force or existing at the time at
which the repeal takes effect;

(b) affect the previous operation of the law or anything
duly done or suffered under the law;

(¢) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability
acquired, accrued or incurred under the law;

(d) affect any penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect of any offence committed against the
law; or

(e) affect any investigation legal proceeding or remedy
in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation,
liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment;

and any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy
may be instituted, continued or enforced, and any such -
penalty, forfeiture or punishment may he imposed, as if
the law had not been repealed.

The criminal liability incurred by
the appellant has been expressly saved by the
wordings of Article 264 of the Constitution.

The repeal of the FCR cannot be deemed to

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-10-

have been affecting the punishment imposed on
the appellant and upheld upto the august
Supreme Court of Pakistan. In the case of

“Muhammad Arif and another v/s The State

and another” reported as “1993 SCMR 1589”

the Hon’ble Apex Court had cited with
approval the judgment of the House of Lords of
England given in the case of “Wicks v/s
Director _of Public Prosecutions (1947)”,
whereby the conviction of the appellant had
been upheld under the Emergency Powers
(Defence), Act 1939, because of existence of
section 11 (3) in the said Act. The ibid section
of law provided that the expiry of the Act
should not affect its past operation, as respects
things previously done or omitted to be done.
The Hon’ble Court further held in the said
judgment as follows;

16. From the above cited cases, it is evident
that there is judicial consensus that where a law
is repealed, it will not inter alia affect any

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad.
-li-

investigations, legal proceedings or remedy in
respect of any right, privilege, obligation,
liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment, and
any such investigation, legal proceeding or
remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced,
and any such penalty, forfeiture or punishment
may be imposed as if the law had not been
repealed,

In the case of “Province of East

Pakistan v/s Sharafatullah” reported as “PLD

1970 _S.C. 514”, the Hon’ble Apex Court

observed as follows;

"In other words liabilities that are fixed or
rights that have been obtained by the operation
of law upon facts or events for or perhaps it
should be said against which the existing law
provided are not to be disturbed by a general law
governing future rights and liabilities unless the
law so intends."

This Court in the case

“Mubarak Shah v/s The State” reported

of

as

“1990_P Cr, LJ 1796” had passed the

following order by majority of the -Hon’ble

members of the bench;

By a majority, it is held that notwithstanding
the lapse/repeal of the Suppression of Terrorist
Activities (Special Courts) (Amendment)
Ordinance J (XVII of 1088) the learned Special
Court had the jurisdiction to try Syed Mubarik
Shah the appellant and his trial does not stand
vitiated.

The Hon’ble Karachi High Court

in the case of “Sher Muhammad alias Shera

Nawab (S.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-12-

v/s The State” reported as “PLD 1990 Karachi

271” had also taken a similar view in the
following words;

The petitioner was arrested on 27-10-1988,
the first judgment was pronounced on 17-1-1989
but it was set aside by the judgment of the High
Court, dated 17-6-1989 and case was remanded
Sor rehearing. In pursuance thereof the case was
reheard and decided on 31-7-1987, The learned
counsel's main contention is that as the
Ordinance expired on 12-2-1989 the Court did
not have the jurisdiction to proceed and decide
the case. The judgment was first pronounced on
17-1-1989 during the currency of the Ordinance
but the proceedings from remand to re-hearing
and passing of the impugned judgment were
held after the repeal of the Ordinance.
Therefore, it has to be considered whether the
proceedings had terminated at the time when
Ordinance was repealed by efflux of time. As the
case was pending in appeal the proceedings had
not terminated. By appellate order the case was
remanded and therefore, the proceedings
continued and shall be deemed to have remained
pending. Therefore, the proceedings taken by the
learned trial Court after the remand shall be
saved by the provisions of Article 264 of the
Constitution.”

Further reliance in respect of the
said ratio may be placed on the judgments in
the case of “Hakim Ali Zardari v/s The State
and another” reported as “PLD 1998 Supreme
Court J, as well as the judgments reported as
PLD _1967 S.C. 187, 1992 SCMR 602 and

1996 SCMR 237.

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-13-

Thus there remains no doubt that
the punishment awarded to the appellant had
attained finality before the promulgation of 25"
Constitutional Amendment on 31.05.2018 and
same shall be deemed to be protected under
Article 264 of the Constitution, despite repeal
of the FCR.

10. The appeal in hand. was also not
maintainable as the sentence in the case had
earlier been finalized till the august Supreme
Court of Pakistan and was therefore a past and
closed transaction, which could not have been
reopened by way of the instant appeal, or the
earlier second jail criminal appeal filed before
the Tribunal and disposed of vide the impugned
judgment dated 21.02.2017 of the FATA
Tribunal Peshawar. In the case of

“Syed _Masroor_Shah_and_others v/s The

State” reported as “PLD 2005 Supreme Court

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-14-

173”, the Hon’ble Apex Court has held that an
order passed by any Court irrespective of the
fact whether it was ordinary criminal Court or
Accountability Court, no appeal would lie
there-against, unless it is provided for by the
Statute. It had further been laid down that right
of appeal was a substantive right it could not be
assumed unless expressly given by the Statute.
Further reliance in this respect is also placed on
the judgments given by the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in the case “Manzoor Ali and 39 others
v/s United Bank Limited” reported as “2005
SCMR_1785”, in the case of “Muhammad
Azhar Siddique and others v/s Federation of
Pakistan and others” reported as “PLD 2012
Supreme Court 774” and in the case of “ State

Life Insurance Corporation of Pakistan

through Chairman and others v/s Mst. Sardar

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-15-

Begum and others” reported as “2017 SCMR
999”.

Right of filing second appeal

before the High Court was neither available in
the erstwhile regime nor in the dispensation put
in place in the merged area after its merger
with the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The
2nd appeal in the case in hand was therefore
not maintainable as well.
11. In light of what has been discussed
above, the appeal in hand was found to be
meritless, as well as non-maintainable and
same is accordingly ordered to be dismissed.
