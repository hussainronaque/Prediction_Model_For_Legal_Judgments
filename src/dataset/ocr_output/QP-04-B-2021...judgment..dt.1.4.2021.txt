JUDGMENT

SAHIBZADA_ ASADULLAH, J.- Petitioner through this

petition under Section 561-A Cr.PC. have called in question
the vires of Judgment dated 30.11.2020 passed by the learned
Addl. Sessions Judge-V, Bannu, whereby her revision
petition against the order dated 14.10.2019 of learned
Judicial Magistrate-III, Bannu, stood dismissed.

2. Precise facts of the present petition are that the
petitioner filed a complaint against respondents under
Section 145 Cr.PC. and contended that her husband died 8/9
months ago and being issue-less, she was residing alone in

the house. However, respondents No.1 to3 forcibly entered
entered in the house as well as her landed property 30/35
days before. Besides, respondents, who are their
neighbours, after demolishing the intervening wall of the
house took-over possession of a portion of her house. She
further asserted in her complaint that elders of the area also
gave their verdict in her favour but respondents are adamant
on their illegal possession, and there is likelihood of the
breach of peace. The learned Judicial Magistrate-III Bannu
after requisitioning the report of SHO Police Station
concerned, heard arguments of parties and thereafter,
dismissed the complaint vide order dated 14.10.2019. The
petitioner then preferred a criminal revision which too was
dismissed vide Judgment dated 30.11.2020, hence, this

Quashment petition.
3. Arguments heard and record percussed.

4. The main grievance of complainant, as divulged from
the complaint, is that she was dispossessed from her owned
property and she sought restoration of her possession over
the suit house as well as the landed property. However, it is
an admitted fact on the face of record that the petitioner is
an issue-less widow and the property, for which the present
complaint was filed, was the property of her husband jointly

owned with the present respondents No.1 to 3. As husband
AY

only inherit 1/4 from the legacy of her deceased husband.
The SHO in his report did not mention any aspect of the
breach of peace. The Patwari in his report submitted to the
inquiry officer specially mentioned that the property is joint
one and no partition has yet been taken place. The petitioner
too in her statement affirmed this factum. Now, the question
before this Court is whether a criminal Court under Section
145, Criminal Procedure Code, can initiate proceedings and
attach the property (land or water) for which no private

partition has yet taken place between the parties.

5. Section 145 Criminal Procedure Code is a beneficial
section enacted with the express object of preserving the
peace. For the attainment of this object emergency provision
for attaching the subject-matter of dispute has been provided
in it. Under this section the criminal Court can only pass a
temporary order and the rights of the parties in fact are to be
settled by the Civil Courts. Judicial requirements for

assumption of jurisdiction under section 145 Cr.P.C are:

i. Existence of a dispute.

ii. Such dispute is likely to cause

breach of peace.

iii. Dispute is concerning land, water,

building, markets, fisheries, crops
or other produce of the land and
the rents or profits of such
property.

iv. Dispossession if alleged is within
two months prior to the initial

order passed by the Magistrate.

6. The foremost requirement is the existence of dispute
but in this case, according to the record, the dispute is only
of civil nature. As to the second & third ingredient, there is
no cavil with the proposition that there is no apprehension of
any breach of peace and respondents are claiming their joint
ownership over an unpartitioned house and property. As far
the fourth ingredient is concerned, the petitioner in her
application dated 07.08.2019, moved to the SHO Police
Station Kakki alleged the date of demolition of wall and her
dispossession as 06.08.2019 but in the complaint u/s 145
Cr.P.C. she contradicted the said date by stating it to be
05.08.2019; whereas, in her statement recorded before the
Inquiry Officer she mentioned the existence of dispute from
the death of her husband 5/6 months before. Thus, in the
presence of such contradictory stance the exact date of her
dispossession is not known. It can safely be concluded that it
is a dispute of partition between parties, and there is no

possibility of the breach of peace and thus the scope for the

Cr,

Criminal Court to act under Section 145, Cr.P.C. has thus
been vanished. Jurisdiction of the criminal Court cannot be
invoked except on the ground of likelihood of breach of
peace. While rendering this view, I am fortified by the dictum
laid down in the case of “Municipal Committee Kohat Vs.

Mst. Piari” (ATR 1947 Peshawar 8) wherein it was held:

“It appears from the order of the trial
Court that though the parties were at
issue so far as the question of the
apprehension of the breach of the peace
is concerned, he gave no finding on it.
The mere existence of a dispute between
the parties does not justify the exercise of
jurisdiction conferred by S. 145,
Criminal P.C. on the Criminal Courts.
The only justification for an order by a
Criminal Court under S. 145, Criminal
P.C. is the danger to public peace. The
absence of any findings to the effect that
there was any such apprehension vitiated
the order. The settlement of dispute
lati hich liket
lead bof th is withi
Cry

Courts cannot be invoked except on the
| of the likelihood of a breach of
the peace.” (my emphasise)

7. In “Shamsuddin Ismail and others vs. The State” and
others PLD 1969 Kar. 515 a similar view was taken and the
order passed by the Magistrate was set aside and it was

observed:

"Satisfaction of Magistrate from police
report or other information that dispute
likely to cause breach of peace exists or
existed-- -Condition precedent to exercise
of jurisdiction under section ---
Complainant nowhere alleging in
complaint that dispute likely to cause
breach of peace exists or existed---
Magistrate, in circumstances, held, could
not take cognizance of case nor could he
pass attachment order under subsection
(4)---Magistrate would still have no
jurisdiction should allegations be not

supported by evidence."

8. The object of Section 145 Cr.P.C. is prevention of
breach of peace arising in respect of dispute relating to
immovable property. Settlement of dispute relating to
property which is not likely to lead to breach of peace is
within exclusive jurisdiction of Civil Court. Guidance in this
regard is derived from the case of “Qazi Gran v. Muhammad
Jan” (PLJ 1996 S.C. 1142) wherein the august Apex Court

was of the view:

Section 145 Cr.P.C. deal with the
procedure where dispute concerning
immovable property is likely to cause
breach of peace. It does not suffice for
proceedings under this section that there
should be a dispute but it is necessary
also that there should be a dispute likely
to cause a breach of peace. The primary
object of provision is the prevention of
breach of public peace arising in respect
of dispute relating to immovable
property. The settlement of dispute
relating to property which is not likely to
lead to a breach of peace is within the

exclusive jurisdiction of the civil court. If
“7

9.

of Shamshamir Khan Vs. The State and 6 others (PLD

there was/is no imminent danger to the
public peace, the magistrate need not to
determine the factum of actual physical

possession of the dispute property/Nand.”

This view was also adopted by this Court in the case

1999 Peshawar 70), in the following manner:

“16. As a result of above discussion, I
am of the considered view that the dispute
between the parties being totally of civil
nature, could not be made a ground for
proceedings under section 145, Cr.P.C.
and such proceedings would mean
nothing but to harass the petitioner. The
primary object and scope of section 145,
Cr.P.C. is the prevention of breach of
public peace arising in . respect of
dispute relating to immovable property.
Settlement of dispute relating to property,
which is not likely to lead to a breach of
peace is within the exclusive jurisdiction
of Civil Court. Where there is no

imminent danger, as in this case, to the
public peace, Magistrate need not take
cognizance of an application under

section 145, Cr.P.C.”

10. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of
Chaudhary Munir Vs. Mst. Surriya and others (PLD 2007
Supreme Court 189) provided further guidance while
dealing with the matters concerning Section 145 Cr.P.C. The

citation (b) of the referred case runs as under:

(b) Criminal Procedure Code (V of
1898)---

-—-S. 145---Prevention of breach of
peace---Powers---Object and  scope-—
Prime object of proceedings under S.145,
Cr.P.C. is to prevent breach of peace and
to maintain status quo till the controversy
is decided by civil Court of competent
jurisdiction---Purpose of proceedings
under §.145, Cr.P.C. is to meet an
emergent situation in order to maintain
peace and further to enable parties to set
the controversy at naught through civil
Court regarding title or claim of property

in dispute---It is mandatory requirement
-10-
ae
of S.145, Cr.P.C. that there must not only
be a dispute but it is essential that a

dispute is likely to cause breach of peace.

11. Further guidance may also be derived from the case
of “Husein Ali J. Merchant Vs. The State & 2 others” (2003
YLR 1742) wherein it was held that the provisions of section
145 Criminal Procedure Code, are designed to meet an
emergent situation only causing threat to the peace and the
same cannot be used for settling the rights of the parties on
their claim of title. The relevant excerpts from para-6 of the

referred judgment runs as under:

The applicant is not residing at the
alleged disputed property although the
applicant has possession of one room in
the said house. At present there is no
material that any apprehension of breach
of peace arising between the parties. The
provisions of section 145, Cr.P.C. is
designed to meet an emergent situation
only pausing threat to the peace and
cannot be used for settling the rights of

the parties on their claim of title.
-1l-

12. The law, as settled in Muhammad Iqbal Jaffer Vs.
The State & 6 others, PLJ 1989 Cr. C (Karachi) 448 clearly
gets attracted in the present case. The relevant excerpt is as

under:

6. The perusal of the application
made under Section 145 Cr.P.C. by
respondents No. 2 to 6 further reveals that
there is no allegation that respondents No.2

to 6 are asserting their rights of whatever

nature including the right of possession over
the properties in question, causing
apprehension of breach of peace. The
dispute over the possession of business does
not constitute the essential elements of sub-
section (I) of Section 145 Cr.P.C. Mere
existence of a dispute between the parties
over business does not justify the exercise of
jurisdiction conferred by Section 145

Cr.P.C. on certain magistrates.

7. All the dishonest acts in
business dealings are not criminal.
Likewise, a dispute concerning the business
is not a_ subject matter relating to

proceedings under section 145 Cr.P.C. The
-12-

criminal Court cannot be used to settled a
civil dispute. The proceedings taken against
the applicant and his wife under Section
145 Cr.P.C. are thus a clear abuse of the
process of law. Accordingly, both the
applications filed under section 561-A
Cr.P.C. are allowed and the proceedings

against the applicants are quashed.

13. Considering the above facts and circumstances,
petitioner has failed to point out any illegality or infirmity
committed by both the learned courts below while passing
the impugned judgments, which do not call for any
interference by this Court. Consequently, impugned
judgments passed by both the Courts below are maintained
and instant quashment petition stand dismissed being

devoid of merits.
