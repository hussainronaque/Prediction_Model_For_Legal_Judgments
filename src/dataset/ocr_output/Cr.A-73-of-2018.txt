U/S 148 PPC to 3 years imprisonment.

All the sentences shall run concurrently,
however, the appellant was extended the

Brief, but essential facts of the

prosecution case are that Malak Zada, SHO,

Police Station Chinglai Buner, who appeared

as PW-1 before the trial court, made a

‘Murasila’ report that on the eventful day,

while they were escorting the then Minister

Mr. Sardar Hussain Babak, some unknown

culprits started firing at them with the aim of

murderous assault. As a result of the said

firing, the Minister as well as the other

persons sustained injuries. Accordingly, the

NAWAB

DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
FIR No. 233 dated 21.08.2011 under
sections 324,353 and 427 of the Pakistan
Penal Code 1860 (“PPC”) read with section
7 of Anti-terrorism Act, 1997 (“ATA”) was
registered against the unknown accused at
Police Station Chinglai District Buner. Later,
sections 337 A (ii), 337 F (i),(ii), (v), 148,149
of the PPC, section 5 of the Explosive
Substances’ Act, 1908 (“ESA”) and section
13 of the Arms Ordinance, 1965 (“A.O”) were
also added in the FIR.

3. During initial investigation seven
(7) accused including the present appellant
were nominated for the commission of
offence. Out of said seven (7) accused, five (5)
accused were earlier arrested, interrogated and
were sent for trial, however, they were
acquitted by the learned Judge Anti-Terrorism
Court vide judgment dated 12.12.2012.
Whereas the present appellant and one another
accused were proceeded under section 512 of
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898

(“Cr.P.C”),

NAWAB DB: Mr, Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
4. On arrest of the appellant, he was
indicted and upon completion of the trial he
was finally convicted and sentenced through
the impugned judgment dated 17.01.2018 in
the mode and manner as stated above by the
learned Judge Anti-Terrorism Court District
Buner. Hence, the present jail criminal appeal.
5. Arguments heard and record of
the case was perused.

6. Admittedly, in the initial FIR no
one was charged for the murderous assault on
the police personnel as well as the then
Minister, Mr. Sardar Hussain Babak. Later,
the present appellant along with five (5)
acquitted accused and one absconding accused
were charged. On arrest of the present
appellant, supplementary  challan was
submitted before the learned Anti-Terrorism
Court and the present appellant was
summoned from jail for compliance with the
provision of section 265-C Cr.P.C. On
24.5.2017 charge was framed against the

present appellant, to which he pleaded guilty.

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
However, from physical appearance of the
appellant, the learned trial Court reached at the
conclusion that the present appellant had some
mental disease, therefore, regarding
ascertainment of his mental illness he was sent
for a medical opinion. The Medical Board
examined the present appellant on 16.11.2017
and according to the medical opinion he was
found fit and able to understand the Court
proceedings.

Ws Resultantly, the Court
proceedings were resumed and the prosecution
witnesses were summoned. Accordingly, the
prosecution has produced 10 witnesses,
however, none of the witness was cross-
examined for the reason that the present
appellant was not represented through an
Advocate. On the basis of this one sided
prosecution evidence and the fact that the
present appellant had pleaded guilty, he was
convicted and sentenced through the

impugned judgment by the learned trial Court.

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
8. Thus, without going into the
merit of the case, we hold that the present
appellant was not provided appropriate
opportunity to defend himself before the
Court. Indeed, under Articles 4 and 10-A of
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of
Pakistan, 1973 (“Constitution”), it is
inalienable right of every citizen to be treated
in accordance with law and he/she has a right
to a fair trial and due process of law to face
any criminal charge. For ready reference
Articles and 4 and 10-A of the Constitution
are reproduced as under:-
Article 4:-

“Right of individuals to be dealt
with in accordance with law,
etc... (1) To enjoy the protection
of law and to be treated in
accordance with law is the
inalienable right of every
citizen, wherever he may be,
and of every other person for
the time being within Pakistan.
Article 10-A:-

Right to fair trial

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
[10A, For the determination of
his civil rights or in any
criminal charge against him a
person shall be entitled to a fair
trial and due process.]

The phrase ‘fair trial’ has been

explained in ‘Advance Law Lexicon

Encyclopedia_of Law’’ by referring the

,

judgment titled ‘Kalyani Bask vs M.S.
Sampoornam reported as 2007 Indian
Supreme Court 258’’, wherein it was held
that:-

“The expression ‘fair trial’ includes
fair and proper opportunities allowed
by law to prove her innocence. Denial
of right of an accused to adduce
evidence in support of the defence
would amount to denial of ‘fair trial’.

Similarly, the Indian Supreme Court in

case titled “Rattiram v/s State of MP.
through Inspector of Police reported as AIR

2012 S.C. 1285”’’ has observed that denial of
fair trial is crucifixion of human life and has
held that:-

“A ‘fair trial’ is the heart of criminal
jurisprudence and, in a way, an
important factor of a democratic

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
polity that is governed by Rule of
Law. Denial of ‘fair trial, is
crucifixion of human rights. It is
ingrained in the concept of due
process of law. While emphasizing the
principle of ‘fair trial’ and the
practice of the same in the course of
trial, it is obligatory on the part of the
Courts to see whether in an individual
case or category of cases because of
non-compliance of a certain
provision, revision of judgment of
conviction is inevitable or it is
dependent on arriving at an
indubitable conclusion that
substantial justice has in fact
occurred. The seminal issue is
whether protection given to the
accused under the law has been
jeopardized as a consequence of
which there has been failure of justice
or causation of any prejudice.”

The aforesaid phrase ‘fair trial’ has

further been expounded in “Words and

Phrases Legally Defined’’ authored by Lexis

Nexis in 4" Edition as following:-

©The right to prosecute and the right
to lead admissible evidence in support
of its [the prosecution’s] case are not
subject to judicial control. Of course
when the prosecutor reaches court he
becomes subject to the directions as to
the conduct of the trial by the judge,
whose duty it then is to see that the
accused has a fair trial according to
law. What does “fair’’ mean in this
context? It relates to the process of
trial. No man is to be compelled to
incriminate himself: nemo tenetur se
ipsum prodere. No man is to be
convicted save on the probative effect
of legally admissible evidence. No
admission or confession is to be
received in evidence unless voluntary.
If legally admissible evidence be

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr, Justice Syed Arshad Ali
tendered which endangers these
principles the judge may exercise his
discretion to exclude it, thus ensuring
that the accused has the benefit of
principles which exist in the law to
secure him a fair trial; but he has no
power to exclude admissible evidence
of the commission of a crime, unless
in his judgment these principles are
endangered.’’

Whereas the Black Law
Dictionary has very precisely but aptly
defined the phrases ‘fair trial’ as under:-

°A trial by an impartial and
disinterested Tribunal in accordance
with the regular procedure; especially
a criminal trial in which the
defendant’s constitutional and legal
rights are respected.

The Indian Supreme Court while
faced with the similar situation has
emphasized on providing of legal aid being
the inherent responsibility of the trial Court in
°Muhammad Hussain v/s _the State

Govt: of NCT) Dehli__reported as 2012

SCMR 1610’ in the following words:-

“In| my view, every person,
therefore, has a right to a fair trial
by a competent Court in the spirit
of the right to life and personal
liberty. The object and purpose of
providing competent legal aid to
undefended and unrepresented
accused persons are to see that the
accused gets free and fair, just and

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-10-

reasonable trial of charge in a
criminal case.’’

9. From the afore-referred case law
as well as the explanation of the phrase fair
trial as provided in the aforesaid Legal
dictionaries and from the introduction of the
Article 10-A in our own Constitution, it is
now incumbent upon the trial Court to ensure
that the interest of the accused facing criminal
prosecution is fully protected and if the said
accused is unable to engage a counsel or the
Court feels that the accused cannot represent
himself, it is duty of the Court to provide the
assistance of the competent legal practitioner
to the accused to defend himself because by
now it is his fundamental right in view of
Article 10-A of the Constitution to have the
opportunity of a fair trial and due process of
law.

10. Thus, in view of the above and
the law laid down in the afore-referred
judgments, the impugned judgment is not

sustainable in the eye of law, therefore, on

NAWAB DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-ll-

acceptance of this appeal, the impugned
judgment is set aside and the case is remanded
to the learned trial Court with direction for
de novo trial including framing of charge
afresh. However, before framing of charge,
the learned trial Court shall ensure that a
pauper counsel be provided to the appellant at
the State expenses and he shall be treated as

under trial prisoner.
