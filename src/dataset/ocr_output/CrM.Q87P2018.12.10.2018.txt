QALANDAR __ALI_ KHAN, J.- Andaz Khan,
petitioner, being SHO Police Station Toru, Mardan,
moved the instant petition under Section 561-A Cr.PC
for quashment of the judgment/order dated 28.09.2018
of the learned Ex-Officio Justice of Peace/Additional
Sessions Judge-VIII, Mardan, whereby, application of
respondent No.1, Salma Gul,was accepted and the
District Police Officer, Mardan, was directed to
proceed under Section 154 Cr.PC.

2. Respondent No.1 had moved application
under Section 22 (a ) Cr.P.C to the learned Ex-Officio
Justice of Peace/Sessions Judge, Mardan, for legal
proceedings against the petitioner and his other
companions/police officials for trespassing her house
at midnight on 02.09.2018, and after inquiring about
her father, who was not present in the house,
subjecting women folk in the house, including her

sister-in-law, who had given birth to a son a couple of
r

days before, to severe beating, using abusive language
and searching cupboards in the residential rooms and
thus causing missing of three tola gold ornaments and
cash amount of Rs.150,000/- and also Rs.52,000/-
lying under foam of the bed. In her
application/complaint, respondent No.1 alleged that no
one in the house was required to the police as even in
the case of her father, the High Court had suspended
order of D.C Mardan, therefore, the midnight raid of
the police was probably at the behest of their rivals
who were confined in Police Station Toru, in order to
pressurize them for compromise. Respondent
No.1/complainant, as such, alleged excessive use of
authority by the police.

After going through comments of the
petitioner/SHO, wherein he had tried to justify the
midnight raid for arrest of father and uncle of
respondent No.1/complainant on the orders of D.C
Mardan under Section 3 MPO, the learned Ex-Officio
Justice of Peace/ASJ-VIII, Mardan, arrived at the
conclusion that the allegations contained in the
application constituted a cognizable offence under
Section 156 of the Police Order, 2002; and further
that veracity of the allegations regarding maltreatment
and taking away of valuables and cash amount during
the raid and also whether order of suspension of
warrant of arrest had been conveyed to the
petitioner/SHO, were the ‘area of investigation’ and

could not be determined prior to setting of law into
motion. Consequently, the learned Ex-Officio Justice
of Peace/ASJ-VIII, Mardan, accepted the petition and
directed District Police Officer, Mardan, to proceed
with the matter in accordance with law as provided
under Section 154 Cr.P.C.

4. As would be seen from a bare perusal of the
aforesaid impugned order of the learned Ex-Officio
Justice of Peace/ASJ-VIII, Mardan, that the learned
Court has properly appreciated not only facts of the
case but also the law applicable thereto; and rightly
directed the District Police Officer, Mardan, to
proceed with the matter in accordance with law as
provided under Section 154 Cr.P.C; which, though,
meant for Incharge of the Police Station, was not
expected to be invoked by the local police in view of
the fact that the complaint was against SHO and other
lice officials of the local Police Station.
5. In short, the learned counsel for the petitioner
could point out no illegality or legal infirmity in the
impugned order dated 28.09.2018, calling for
interference by this Court in a matter which is
apparently another example of high handedness by the
local police while demonstrating scant regard for
order of highest Court in the Province and resorting to
misuse of authority while taking undue advantage of
the authority vested in the police department only for
providing protection to the person, property, dignity

and honour of citizens of the Country.
6. There is, as such, no merit in the petition for
quashment of the impugned judgment/order dated

28.09.2018; hence the petition is dismissed in limine.
