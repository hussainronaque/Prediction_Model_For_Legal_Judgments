QAISER RASHID KHAN, J.- Through the present

Sessions Judge-I, Takht Bhai whereby he was

Amir-ud-Din Khan, SI (PW-10) has
investigated the case. He visited the spot and prepared
the site plan Ex:PB at the pointation of the complainant
and the eyewitnesses. He recovered blood stained earth
alongwith five empties of 30 bore from the spot and
sealed the same into a parcel vide recovery memo
Ex:PW-7/1. Likewise, vide recovery memo Ex:PW-7/2,
he took into possession the blood stained clothes of the
deceased comprising a Qamees (P.1), Shalwar (P.2) and
white jacket (P.3). Similarly, vide his applications
Ex:PW-10/4 and Ex:PW-10/5 he obtained warrant of
arrest and proclamation notices respectively against the
convict-appellant. He recorded the statement of the PWs
and on completion of investigation handed over the case
file to the SHO for the submission of challan under
section 512 Cr.P.C against the convict-appellant.
4. After the closure of the prosecution
evidence, the convict-appellant was examined under
section 342 Cr.P.C. who pleaded innocence and denied
the allegations of the prosecution brought against him.
However, he neither wished to produce any evidence in
his defence nor himself appeared as his own witness in
disproof of the allegations of prosecution as provided
under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. On conclusion of the trial,
after hearing of the learned counsel for the parties and

appraising the evidence, the learned trial Judge

“younas” (DB) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.
6

convicted and sentenced the appellant as mentioned in
para-1 of the judgment.

5. The learned counsel for the convict-
appellant vehemently attacked the impugned judgment
of conviction and sentence of the convict-appellant and
contends that he has been falsely charged in the instant
case by the complainant as his presence at the spot is not
established and in this respect he states that the
occurrence has taken place in the house of Nooran Shah
( elder brother of both the deceased and the convict-
appellant) but neither his statement was recorded by the
1.0 nor he turned up before the learned trial court to
record his statement in support of the stance of the
complainant and that the motive set up by the
prosecution has not been proved. Further contends that
from the spot, 5 empties of 30 bore have allegedly been
retrieved but the same were not sent to the FSL to
ascertain as to whether they were fired from one or
different weapons. He further contends that the site plan
does not support the version advanced by the
complainant and his presence at the spot as well. He
further contends that Imad who is marginal witness to
the recovery of memo, in his court statement as PW-7
states that the recovery memo was prepared by the LO
and he was just made to sign the same and lastly that
when the other circumstances do not support the version
advanced by the prosecution then the mere abscondance

“younas” (DB) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.
7

of the convict-appellant is not sufficient to award him
the conviction and thus he deserves acquittal. In this
respect, he placed reliance on 1999 SCMR 1220
(MUHAMMAD KHAN and another versus THE
STATE), 1998 P.Cr.LJ 990 (Peshawar), {SALIM
KHAN and another versus THE STATE}, 2001 P Cr.L
J 1740 (Peshawar) {SAEEDULLAH versus SHAH
NAZAR and another} 2003 P Cr.L J 2003 (Quetta)
(NOOR ALAM versus THE STATE) , 2002 P Cr.L J
377 (Peshawar) { The State through Advocate-General,
N.W.F.P, Peshawar versus Tawab and another} 2008
SCMR 158 {Muhammad Khalid Khan versus Abdullah
and others} ,2017 SCMR 144 (MUHAMMAD SADIQ
versus THE STATE) and 2006 SCMR 1846 (Lal Khan
versus the State) .

6. Such arguments of the learned counsel for
the convict-appellant are resisted by the learned AAG
assisted by the learned counsel for the complainant who
contend that the convict-appellant has been directly
charged by the son of the deceased namely Saleem Shah
and he has narrated the entire details in the FIR in
respect of the mode and manner of the occurrence, the
motive set up has been duly proved and the recovery of
5 empties of 30 bore from the spot lend further credence
to the story advanced by the complainant. They further
contend that the site plan prepared at the instance of the
complainant and Itibar Khan, brother of the deceased

“younas” (DB) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.
8

also supports the ocular testimony furnished by the
complainant and that the non-sending of the empties
from the spot to the FSL would not dent the prosecution
version as this exercise was not necessary in view of the
single accused being charged by the complainant.

7. Arguments heard and the available record.

8. It was the complainant namely Saleem
Shah who reported about the incident to the police on
27.03.2010 at 15:00 hours as to how he along with his
father ( deceased Saleem Shah) had gone to the house
of his uncle Nooran Shah to settle some dispute in
respect of a joint house where his grandmother Mst.
Fazal Roshan and uncle Itibar Shah were also present
and during the course of negotiations, some harsh
words were exchanged whereafter the convict-appellant
pulled out his pistol and fired at his father Saleem Shah
with which he received firearm injury and died on the
spot. Since the occurrence has taken place in the house
of Noor Shah, uncle of the complainant, therefore, his
presence at the spot was quite natural.

9. The complainant who recorded his
statement as PW-10 has furnished a straightforward
account of the occurrence and also put forth the motive
as a dispute over a joint house. He was indeed subjected
to a lengthy and taxing cross examination but barring
some minor and negligible discrepancies and
contradictions, he stuck to his stance regarding the

“younas” (DB) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Abdu! Shakoor.
9

version so advanced by him. The convict-appellant is his
real uncle so in such circumstances there was no
occasion for the complainant to falsely nominate him for
the murder of his father.

The deceased and the convict-appellant are
brothers inter se and the motive has been given as a
dispute over a joint property. The defence has badly
failed to shatter the motive set up by the prosecution.
10. So far as the arguments of the learned
counsel for the convict-appellant regarding non-
examination of Mst. Fazal Roshan and Itibar Shah are
concemed, suffice it to say that the same phenomenon
was but natural. Mst. Fazal Roshan being an old lady in
her advanced age having lost her one son in the incident
would of course have not turned up to depose against
her other son and that too, when much of the dust had
settled after the arrest of the convict-appellant after over
three years of the occurrence. The same is the case with
Itibar Shah, who is not only the brother of the deceased
but also of the convict-appellant and as such, for
obvious reasons could have not deposed against his
brother as in the process, the same would entail capital
punishment for the convict-appellant.
11. Imad son of Gul Rehman who is marginal
witness to the recovery memos Ex:PW-7/1 and 7/2 has
recorded his statement as PW-7 and in his examination-
in-chief has in clear terms stated as to how the 1.0

“younas” (DB) Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.
10

arrived at the spot and recovered the 5 empties as well
as blood and accordingly he put his signatures over the
same. He is an independent witness as no relationship
whatsoever of the said witness has been shown with the
complainant party and has given a clean breast
statement and despite being subjected to cross
examination, he stood his ground.

12. As per the report of the doctor who was
examined as PW-4, the deceased has received a single
firearm injury on his left cheek with its corresponding
firearm exit wound on the left side base of his skull
which proved fatal. The arguments of the learned
counsel for the convict-appellant in respect of the
statement of the doctor that the time between the injury
and death was within 2 hours can at best be termed to be
a probable time and would not as such cause a dent in
the ocular testimony of the complainant.

13. From the spot, 5 empties of 30 bore have
been retrieved. Since this is a case of a single accused,
therefore, there was no necessity for the prosecution to
have sent the same to the FSL for getting its report.
More so, after the commission of the offence, the
convict-appellant rather than surrendering before the
law opted to abscond and remained fugitive form law
for over three long years and he has failed to give any

plausible explanation for such long abscondance.

14. In view of the above discussion, the
prosecution has been able to prove its case against the
convict-appellant through a promptly lodged FIR,
confidence inspiring ocular testimony, single accused
motive, recovery of crime empties from the spot,
supportive medical evidence coupled with his over three
years long abscondance to the hilt and that is how the
learned trial court has rightly convicted and sentenced
him vide the impugned judgment. Reliance in this
respect is placed on 2003 SCMR 736 (Muhammad
Sadiq Versus the State), 2003 SCMR 1479 (Mukhtiar
versus the State), 2006 SCMR 1857 (Muhammad
Ehsan versus the State), 2008 SCMR 161( Maqbool
Khan versus the State), 2008 SCMR 917 ( Farooq
Khan versus the State), 2010 SCMR 1025 ( Faisal
Mehmood and another versus the State and another),
2010 SCMR 1791 ( Anwar Shamim versus the State)
and 2012 SCMR 1869 (Takdir Samsuddin Sheikh

versus State of Gujrat and another).

As a sequel to the above discussion, we
dismiss the instant appeal and maintain the conviction
and sentence of the appellant. However, the benefit of
section 382-B Cr.P.C is extended to him.
