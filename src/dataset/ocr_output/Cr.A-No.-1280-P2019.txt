JUDGMENT

KRRK

SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- Through the instant criminal appeal,

the accused/appellant Wasim, has questioned the judgment dated

14.10.2019, passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV,

Peshawar, whereby the appellant involved in case FIR No.1252,

dated 02.12.2016 registered under sections 302/34 PPC read with

section 15-AA at Police Station Badhber, District Peshawar, was

convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment along with

compensation of Rs. 1000,000/- (ten lac) under section 544-A

Cr.P.C to be payable to the LRs of deceased or in default thereof, the

same shall be recovered as arrears of land revenue, if not recovered,

he shall further suffer six months imprisonment. He was further
convicted under section 15-AA and sentenced to three years R.I

along with fine of Rs. 10,000/- or in default, he shall further suffer

three months S.I, however, benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C was

extended to him.

2. Brief and essential facts of the prosecution case, according to

the Murasila (EX PA/1) drafted by Sher Ahmad/ASI, are that while

on patrol duty he received information regarding the death of the

deceased in the house of the appellant; that soon the information was

received he left for the spot and near the spot he came across Mst.

Nazrana i.e. the complainant who reported the matter to the effect

that on the eventful day, she alongwith her brother-in-law (Arshad

Khan / deceased), who was called to their house, were present, when

in the meanwhile accused/Wasim alongwith Tila Muhammad, Syar

& Bawal attracted to spot duly armed and entered into conversation

with the deceased regarding the disputed property; that while

negotiating, the temperament rose high and the accused/appellant

started firing at the deceased who got hit & died on the spot, whereas

the co-accused commanded the appellant to kill the complainant as

well; that because of fear of her death, she rushed to the street where

she reported the matter. The same was duly thumb impressed by the
complainant and verified by one Imran Ali & Haroon Khan sons of

Asghar Ali; hence the instant FIR.

3. The accused/appellant and the acquitted co-accused were

arrested from the spot whereas one of the accused namely Jamal

alias Bawal decamped from the spot who was subsequently declared

as proclaimed offender and proceedings u/s 512 Cr.P.C were

initiated against him. It is pertinent to mention that the absconder co-

accused was arrested on 23.11.2017 and supplementary challan was

submitted before the Court of competent jurisdiction. The

accused/appellant was charge sheeted where he denied the charge

and claimed trial. On conclusion of the trial, the learned trial court

was pleased to convict the appellant u/s 302(b) PPC and the co-

accused were acquitted from the charges. It is pertinent to mention

that the trial against the co-accused Tila Muhammad could not be

concluded as during the trial he met his natural death.

4. The learned counsel for the appellant and the learned AAG

assisted by the learned counsel for the complainant were heard at

length and with their able assistance the record was scanned

through.
5. The deceased lost his life inside the house of the complainant

and that matter was reported by the complainant to the local police.

The matter was reported in the shape of murasila whereafter the

scribe visited the spot house, arrested the convict/appellant and from

his personal possession a Kalashnikov alongwith five live rounds

was taken into possession. The injury sheet and inquest report of the

deceased were prepared and the dead body of the deceased was sent

to the doctor for postmortem examination. The investigating officer

after getting copy of the FIR visited the spot and on pointation of the

complainant prepared the site plan. During spot inspection the

investigating officer collected blood stained earth from the place of

deceased and five empties of 7.62 bore near from the place of the

convict appellant. The crime weapon alongwith recovered empties

were sent to the Fire Arms Expert for determination, as to whether

the collected empties were fired from the same weapon, recovered

from possession of the appellant. The Kalashnikov and empties were

examined by the expert and a report was received in positive. The

appellant faced trial and on conclusion of the trial was convicted

vide the impugned judgment.
6. The learned Trial court took pains to appreciate the

record of the case and the inherent worth of the prosecution

witnesses and thereafter handed down the impugned judgment. The

prosecution case rests upon the sole statement of the complainant,

who too, was declared hostile. The learned Trial Court was highly

swayed by the conduct of the complainant and her subsequent

statement before the Trial Court, so it convicted the appellant for

commission of the offence. As is evident from the record that apart

from the complainant, no ocular account was produced which could

substantiate the prosecution case, so in such eventuality this Court is

under the obligation to test the veracity of the statement of the

complainant and her subsequent conduct she displayed before the

learned Trial Court. As the complainant is the star witness and that it

is her testimony which can either benefit the accused/appellant or

the prosecution, so in the attending circumstances of the present

case, we deem it essential to dilate upon the legal aspect of her status

as a hostile witness and to determine that in whose favour her

statement is to be taken into consideration. True that the learned

Trial Court dealt with the matter comprehensively and that apart

from statement of the complainant the recovery of the weapon of
offence and its positive report added to the anxiety of the Court and

as such the impugned judgment was handed down. This Court is to

see as to whether the learned Trial Court did apply its judicial mind

to the facts & circumstances of the case and that it properly

appreciated the evidence on file, so for the purpose we deem it

essential to scan through the record once again so that miscarriage of

justice could be avoided.

7. The points for determination before this Court are, as to

whether the incident occurred in the mode, manner and the stated

time; as to whether the complainant witnessed the incident; as to

whether the accused/appellant was arrested on the spot and from his

personal possession the weapon of offence was recovered. In order

to determine these particular questions, we would like to appreciate

the role of the complainant and her subsequent conduct before the

investigating agency and the learned Trial Court as well. No doubt,

the matter was reported by the complainant while running from the

spot, to one Sher Ahmad/ASI and the same was duly verified by the

real brothers of the deceased but this is for the prosecution to tell

that the incident occurred in the mode, manner and at the stated

time, that too, when the complainant resiled from her statement and
she was declared hostile. The scribe was examined as PW-2, who

stated that on the eventful day he was on his routine patrol duty

alongwith police officials when he received the information

regarding the death of the deceased; that the moment he received

information, he started towards the spot house, when the

complainant came across and reported the matter; that he went

inside the house arrested the appellant and others and from personal

possession of the appellant, the weapon of offence was recovered;

that after the recovery was effected from personal possession of the

appellant, he was arrested and the murasila was sent to the local

police station for registration of the case. This witness was cross

examined on material aspects of the case, more particularly,

regarding the place where he received information and the time he

spent while reaching to the place where the complainant reported the

matter. This is surprising to note that the information was received at

a distance of 1 4 kilometer from the spot and that the official took

more than 10-minutes to reach to the place where the matter was

reported, but the complainant was still available at a little distance

from her house. When admittedly the information was received to

the scribe when he was at a quite long distance from the place of
incident, then how he came across the complainant a little away

from her house, when admittedly she was rushing out from the

house in the state of panic. This is for the prosecution to tell that in

10/15 minutes, the complainant would have gone a greater distance

and her coming across to the scribe does not appeal to a prudent

mind. This is again for the prosecution to tell that when the matter

was reported, where from the real brothers of the deceased attracted

to the place of report and who informed them regarding the incident.

The availability of the brothers of the deceased at the time of the

report is a circumstance which goes against the prosecution case.

Had the complainant reported the matter while running away from

her house and had the scribe per chance came across her, then in

such eventuality she would have been alone and there was hardly an

occasion for the verifiers to reach. In order to appreciate this

particular aspect of the case, we deem it essential to go through the

relevant portion of the report of the complainant where she disclosed

that after the deceased was fired at, the accused wanted to kill her as

well. The report of the complainant does not support the case of the

prosecution, as the investigating officer prepared the site plan on

pointation of the complainant where the complainant has been
shown at point No.1, the deceased at point No.2 in veranda of the

house and the appellant at point No.3 near the deceased. If we admit

for a while that the deceased was called form his house to settle the

dispute regarding the disputed property then the complainant instead

of occupying point No.1, which is situated in the outer main gate of

the house, would have been present inside the house. The site plan

does not depict the initial places where the appellant and the

deceased were sitting to resolve the dispute. The attending

circumstances of the present case do tell that the incident did not

occur in the mode and in the manner. There is every possibility that

the report was never made in the street soon after the incident rather

the same was made at a belated stage when the prosecution

succeeded in procuring the attendance of the complainant. As the

prosecution case is shrouded in mystery and the complainant who

happened to be the sole eye witness of the incident did not support

the case of the prosecution, so in that eventuality it is for the

prosecution to convince this Court that apart from her statement the

prosecution succeeded in bringing home guilt against the appellant,

which to our understanding the prosecution failed to convince.
10

8. The complainant was examined as PW-3, and when her

examination in chief was recorded, she deviated from her report and

she did not support the case of the prosecution. Keeping her conduct

in mind, the prosecution requested the Court to declare her hostile

and as such she was declared hostile. The learned Trial Court after

declaring the complainant hostile provided an opportunity to both

the sides to test the veracity of the witness and as such she was re-

examined and cross-examined. It is pertinent to mention that when

the complainant was cross examined by the prosecution, the

prosecution could not succeed in bringing on record that she

willfully deviated from her report with the sole purpose to extend

benefit to the accused charged. In order to ascertain as to whether

the prosecution succeeded in discrediting the veracity of this

witness, we deem it essential to go through the report of the

complainant and the attending circumstances of the case. As

discussed earlier that the incident did not occur in the mode; and in

the manner as disclosed by the complainant and that the matter was

never reported as has been disclosed by the scribe, so in the like

circumstances, this Court is inclined in holding that first the
11

appellant was arrested, the case was investigated and thereafter the

complainant was compelled to report the matter.

9. It is interesting to note that soon after the incident, the

complainant was sent to Darul Aman, by the Court of competent

jurisdiction on the basis of an application submitted by the

investigating officer. The contents of the application tell that the

complainant was feeling threat to her life at the hands of her parents

and that she wanted to be placed in Women Shelter Home (Dar-ul-

Aman), the application was allowed and she spent there as many as

13-months. The request for sending her to Dar-ul-Aman, the

presence of the deceased in veranda of the house at the time of

incident and her presence in the main gate of house are the

circumstances which tell that there was some understanding between

the deceased and the complainant which led to the incident. The

matter was not purely a landed property dispute, had this been so,

then there was no occasion for the accused to attempt at her life. As

while reporting the matter the complainant categorically stated that

after the deceased was fired at, the co-accused commanded the

appellant to kill the complainant as well. In case of landed property

dispute there was no reason for the appellant to attempt at her life
12

but his part of her report clarifies the mist and confirms our belief

regarding the mutual understanding of the two. When the facts are

twisted from both the sides then in that eventuality it is only & only

the appellant to be benefited.

10. The legal question which this Court is to resolve is, as to

whether the statement of a hostile witness can be pressed into

service in support of the prosecution and if so, what extra is needed

to enhance its veracity and its inherent worth. There is no cavil to

the preposition that a hostile witness is the witness of none and he

speaks in two tones. The sole statement of a hostile witness is hardly

a ground to be relied upon, as such a witness by its very conduct has

lost his integrity and worth. As in this particular case, it is not the

witness who deviated from her stance, as she wanted to favour the

appellant, rather while reporting the matter she suppressed the real

facts from both, the investigating agency and the learned Trial

Court. As the landed property dispute has never been established on

record, so it can validly be held that the cause of killing is still

hidden and the availability of the deceased at the odd hours of night

in the house of the complainant is a question which is still asking for

an answer, to which the prosecution failed to answer. This state of
13

uncertainty is a factor which must be weighed in favour of the

appellant and on this score too he is entitled to the benefit of doubt.

As is held in case law reported as “PLD 2007 Supreme Court

223”, titled as “Muhammad Suleman and 4 others Vs The State”,

which is reproduced herein below:

“12. The testimony of a witness who speaks in
the different tune at different times is
certainly not reliable unless strong
confirmatory evidence of independent
character is available on record. Similarly,
the sole testimony of an interested witness,
without independent corroboration may not
be confidence inspiring to be relied upon for
conviction. The rule of independent
corroboration is a rule of abundant caution
which is followed in the interest of safe
criminal administration of justice and is not a
mandatory rule of law to be necessarily
applied in each case.”

11.‘ True that soon after his arrest the Kalashnikov was allegedly

recovered from his possession and that the collected empties from

the spot were sent alongwith the weapon of offence, to the Fire

Arms Expert and that a positive report was received in that respect,

but this is for the prosecution to tell, that when the appellant was

arrested on 02.02.2016, then why the empties and the weapon were

received to the Forensic Science Laboratory on 21.12.2016, after a

considerable delay. The delay caused in sending and receiving the

incriminating articles could not be explained and even the

investigating officer could not bring on record any evidence in
14

respect of its safe custody, when such is the state of affairs, this

Court lurks no doubt in mind that this piece of evidence has lost its

utility and the same cannot be taken into consideration. As is held in

case law reported as “2022 SCMR 1494”, titled as “Muneer Malik

and others Vs The State”; the relevant para of which is reproduced

herein below:

“12. Lecce Furthermore, the record shows
that eight empties of Kalashnikov and six
empties of T.T. pistol were recovered from
the scene of occurrence on the same day i.e.
17.05.2007 through recovery memo but the
said crime empties were neither kept in safe
custody nor sent to Chemical Examiner
immediately after recovery. The weapons of
offence and the crime empties were jointly
sent to the office of Chemical Examiner after
a delay of more than two months i.e. on
13.07.2007 for which no plausible explanation
has been given by the prosecution. In these
circumstances, the recoveries are
inadmissible in evidence and cannot be relied
upon to sustain conviction of the appellants.
We, therefore, set aside the conviction of the
appellants under section 13(e) of the Arms
Ordinance.”

12. Though the motive was alleged as the landed property

dispute, but neither the investigating officer could bring on record

the revenue papers in respect of the property nor any independent

witness was produced in that respect. The record tells that the widow

of the deceased Mst. Menaz appeared before the Trial Court as PW-

7, who stated that the deceased had purchased some land from her

father and that for the same, an amount of forty thousand was paid,
15

but the transaction was not documented. She further disclosed that

for the resolution of dispute, she time and again requested her father

but to no avail and that on the day of incident her husband was

called to the house and was killed. The statement of this witness was

recorded u/s 161 Cr.P.C where she did not mention the amount and

did not tell of her request for documentation to her father, so this

witness could not convince the learned Trial court as well as this

Court regarding the dispute brought on record. When the motive

remained unproved which was the sole purpose of killing the

deceased, then the same plays a decisive role in determining the fate

of the appellant. This particular aspect of the case takes this Court

nowhere, but to hold that the prosecution came forward with

concealed and twisted facts. The suppression of facts on part of the

prosecution has gone a long way and damaged the prosecution case

beyond repair, as is held in case law reported as “2021 SCMR 149”,

titled as “Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, JJ Vs The State”. The

operative para of which is reproduced below:

“4. We have observed that there is lack of
motive in the case in hand and what
happened prior to the scene of occurrence or
what prompted the appellant to take away
the life of the deceased-Mst. Saima Bibi are
the circumstances which have rightly been
considered by the Courts below as mitigating
16

circumstances and thus, the appellant has
rightly been dealt with by the Courts below.”

13. The cumulative effect of what has been stated above leads this

Court nowhere but to hold that the prosecution could not succeed in

bringing home guilt against the appellant and the learned Trial Court

fell into error while handing down the impugned judgment. The

impugned judgment is suffering from legal infirmity and inherent

defect which calls for interference. The instant criminal appeal is

allowed, the impugned judgment is set-aside and the appellant is

acquitted of the charges leveled against him. He shall be released

forthwith if not required to be detained in connection with any other

criminal case.
