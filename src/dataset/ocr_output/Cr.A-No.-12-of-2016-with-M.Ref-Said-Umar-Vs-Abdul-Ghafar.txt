JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- At a trial held by learned
Trial Court/Additional Sessions Judge-XI, Peshawar,
accused Said Umar (appellant herein), having been found
guilty of committing the ‘Qatl-e-Amd’ of Said Rehman
deceased, has been convicted under section 302 (b) PPC
and sentenced to death as well as to pay Rs.2,00,000/-, to
LRs of the deceased, as compensation in terms of section
544-A Cr.P.C. and in default thereof to undergo 06 months
S.I. further, vide judgment dated 07.06.2016, in case FIR
No.944 dated 08.10.2012, under section 302 PPC, Police
Station Shaheed Gulfat Hussain, District Peshawar.

2. Through instant appeal, the appellant-convict has
questioned his conviction and sentence while the learned
Trial Court has sent Murder Reference No.2 of 2016, in
terms of section 374 Cr.P.C for confirmation of death

sentence of the convict. Since, both the matters arise out
from one and the same judgment of the learned Trial Court,
hence, we propose to decide the same through this single
judgment.

3. As per contents of Murasila Exh.PA/1, based FIR
Exh.PA, on 08.10.2012 at 16.40 hours complainant Abdul
Ghafar (PW.4), in company of his injured brother Said
Rehman, reported to Rooh-ul-Amin Khan S.I. (PW.2) in
casualty of Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), Peshawar, that
his injured brother was laburer in Gurh Mandi, Peshawar.
On the fateful day, he was informed that during an
altercation, Said Umar (appellant-convict) fired at his
brother, as a result he got hit and has been shifted to LRH,
in injured condition, so he (complainant) rushed to the
hospital and found his injured lying unconscious condition.
Complainant disclosed that they had no previous enmity
with the appellant. His report was recorded in the shape of
Murasila Exh.PA/1 by Rooh-ul-Amin Khan SI (PW.2), on
the basis of which FIR No.944 dated 08.10.2012 under
section 324 PPC (Exh.PA), was registered in Police Station
Shaheed Gulfat Hussain, Peshawar. PW.2 prepared injury
sheet of the injured Exh.PW.2/1 and referred him for
medical examination.

4. Dr. Muhammad Amin MO (PW.13), LRH,
Peshawar, examined the injured and vide Medico legal
report Exh.PW.13/1, observed the following:-

Patient is unconscious and gasping.
1. Firearm entry wound at 8" left intercostals space,
measuring about % cm.
2. Exit wound at 6" right intercostals space

measuring about | cm.
After an hour, the injured succumbed to the injuries, so
Rooh-ul-Amin Khan SI (PW.2), prepared his inquest report
Exh.PW.2/2 and shifted his dead body to KMC, Peshawar
for autopsy under the escort of Constable Nawaz Khan,
wherein Dr. Muhammad Ismail MO (PW.12), on
8.10.2012 at 6.15 p.m. and vide PM report Exh.PM, found

the following injuries on his person:-

1. Firearm entry wound on right outer chest size 1x1
cm, 6 cm below right nipple and 13 cm from
midline.

2. Firearm exit wound on left outer chest, size 1.5x1

cm, 14 cm from anterior midline and 03 cm above
costal margin.

Opinion: In his opinion the deceased died due to injury to
lungs, heart and thoracic blood vessels due to firearm.

5. Muhammad Hassan S.J. (PW.10), conducted
investigation in the case. He proceeded to the spot and
prepared site plan Exh.PB on the pointation of purported
eyewitnesses Abdullah and Usman Ali. During spot
inspection, he secured bloodstained earth from the point of
the deceased and 03 empties shells of 30 bore Exh.P.4
from the point of the appellant, vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.1/1, recorded statements of the PWs under section
161 Cr.P.C. and on receipt of information about arrest of
the appellant by Malang Jan SI, rushed to Police Station

where the appellant along with 30 bore pistol Exh.P.1 and
3 live rounds of the same bore Exh.P.2 as well as recovery
memo Exh.PW.3/1 were handed over to him. He sent the
pistol and empties to the FSL for expert opinion, obtained
physical custody of the appellant, interrogated him and
recorded his statement under section 161 Cr.P.C. Vide
recovery memo Exh.PW.3/1, he took into possession the
last worn bloodstained attires of deceased consisting of
Shalwar Qameez and vest-coat Exh.P.3. Vide application
Exh.PW.10/5, he produced PW Usman Ali for recording
his statement under section 164 Cr.P.C., sent the
bloodstained articles to the FSL and received FSL reports
Exh.PY and Exh.PZ regarding the bloodstained articles and
the empties and pistol. After completion of investigation,
he handed over the case file to the SHO, who submitted
challan against the appellant before the learned Trial Court.
6. On receipt of challan by the learned Trial Court,
appellant was formally charge sheeted under section 302
PPC, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed Trial. To
prove its case, prosecution examined as many as fifteen
witnesses. After closure of the prosecution evidence,
statement of the appellant was recorded under section 342
Cr.P.C., wherein he denied the prosecution allegations and
professed his innocence. He, however, neither wished to be
examined on oath under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C., nor opted
to produce evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial, the

learned Trial Court, after hearing both the sides, convicted
and sentenced the appellant as mentioned above, hence,
this appeal.

7. Learned counsel for the appellant argued that
appellant is innocent and has been made scapegoat for an
untraced murder; that complainant Abdul Ghafar is not the
eyewitness of the occurrence and the hearsay evidence
furnished by him is nothing but a cook and bull story; that
purported eyewitness Usman Ali (PW.5) does not figure
anywhere in the FIR, therefore, his belated statement
cannot be believed and relied upon; that another purported
eyewitness Abdullah (PW.6), has badly failed to establish
his presence on the spot through some strong and physical
circumstances of the incident and his unnatural conduct
like a silent spectator at the time of incident is sufficient to
prove him as a procured witness. He submitted that if for
the sake of argument, the testimony of the purported
eyewitnesses are taken into consideration, even then the
same being full of serious contradictions, dishonest
improves and discrepancies would not be sufficient for
recording conviction in a capital charge; that arrest of the
appellant and recovery of alleged crime pistol from his
possession, in light of the two versions, one furnished by
the complainant and purported eyewitnesses and the other
advanced by Malang Jan SI, is highly doubtful, therefore,
the positive FSL report would not advance the prosecution

case; that the learned Trial Court failed to appreciate the
evidence in its true perspective and reached to erroneous
conclusion by holding the appellant guilty of the offence,
hence, the impugned judgment being against the law and
evidence on record is liable to be set at naught.

8. Conversely, learned AAG assisted by learned
counsel for the complainant contended that appellant is
directly and singularly charged for murder of the deceased
in a promptly lodged report; that substitution of the
accused charged singularly in such like incidents is a rear
phenomena; that there exists no reason or motive that the
complainant would charge innocent person for murder of
his brother by letting off the real culprit; that the
straightforward and confidence inspiring ocular account is
corroborated by red handed arrest of the appellant along
with 30 bore crime pistol, recovery of blood and crime
empties from the spot coupled with positive FSL report qua
the bloodstained articles, crime pistol and empties as well
as medical evidence, hence, the learned Trial Court has
rightly held the appellant guilty of the offence and awarded
him normal penalty of death as there is no mitigating
circumstance to warrant lesser sentence. He sought
dismissal of the appeal and requested for confirmation of
death sentence of the appellant/convict.

9. We have considered the respective submissions of

learned counsel for the parties and scrutinized the record
and evidence available on record with their valuable
assistance.

10. It appears from the record that appellant is directly
and singularly charged for murder of the deceased
committed on the roof top of Gurh Mandi on 08.10.2012 at
16.10 hours. No doubt, the substitution of single accused in
a murder charge is a rare phenomenon, but at the same time
the apex Court has also laid down the law through various
dictum that to put the rope around the neck of an accused
charged singularly, there must be ocular account of
unimpeachable character, trustworthy and confidence
inspiring, corroborated by circumstantial evidence. In case
titled, “Dr. Israr ul Haq vs Muhammad Fayyaz and
another” (2007 SCMR 1427), the Hon’ble apex Court has
observed that substitution of innocent person when a single
accused is named in a murder case is a rare phenomenon,
but it depends from case to case.

11. Since, ocular account in case of ‘Qatl-e-Amd’ as
held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled,
“Mst. Sughara Begum and another Vs Qaisar Pervez
and others” (2015 SCMR 1142), plays a decisive and
vital role and once its intrinsic worth is accepted and
believed then the rest of the evidence, both circumstantial
and corroboratory in nature, is required as a matter of
caution, but to the contrary, once the ocular account is

disbelieved, then no other evidence, even of a high degree
and value, would be sufficient for recording conviction on
a capital charge, therefore, probative value of the ocular
account is to be seen in light of the facts and circumstances
of each case on the touchstone of principle laid down in the
judgment (Supra), we would like to discuss the ocular
account, first.

12. The ocular account of the incident has been
furnished by Abdullah (PW.4) and Usman Ali (PW.5),
while complainant Abdul Ghafar (PW.4), has furnished a
hearsay evidence. PW Abdullah is the nephew and
complainant is the brother of deceased. True that
conviction can be recorded on the testimony of witnesses
having close relationship with the deceased provided the
same rings true and is corroborated by independent strong
circumstances of the occurrence.

13. According to statement of complainant Abdul
Ghafar, on the fateful day he along with his son PW
Abdullah, after closing shop at Faqirabad came to
Hashtnagri Phatak. He told Abdullah to see his uncle
(the deceased) at Gurh Mandi and also bring some Gurh
from him. When Abdullah reached Gurh Mandi, he noticed
a brawl between the deceased and the appellant. He
informed his father/complainant on mobile, who arrived at
the spot and noticed the appellant along with 30 bore pistol
in his hand coming down stairs. He asked him as to what

had happened, but the appellant did not answer him and
fled down stairs. Complainant went up the roof and saw his
brother lying there in injured condition and his son
Abdullah and Usman were lifting him. Complainant then
came down and saw that people had caught hold the
accused-appellant along with crime pistol. According to
complainant the deceased then injured was shifted to the
hospital by PW Abdullah and two other persons in a taxi
while he remained at the spot with the accused-appellant
and on arrival of the police, and arrest of the appellant, he
proceeded to the hospital.

14. Perusal of report Exh.PA/1 depicts that
complainant has not disclosed therein the above narrated
events. He has urged in his report that he on getting
information about firing at his brother by the appellant and
his shifting to LRH in injured condition by PW Abdullah
and Mehmood, rushed to the hospital and lodged a report.
He has even not disclosed the name of the person or the
source through which he was informed about the incident,
but during his statement before the Court, while taking
somersault, he has innovated a different story to bring his
version in conformity with the prosecution case. The
disclosure of the new events in his Court statement,
amounts to dishonest improvements. Even for the sake of
discussion, believing the testimony of the complainant,
shall give birth to certain crucial questions i.e. why the

complainant did not make a report to the police who
10

allegedly reached at the spot and the appellant were handed
over to them along with crime pistol? Why PW Abdullah,
the nephew of the deceased, did not make any report who
shifted the deceased then injured to the hospital and wait
for the arrival of the complainant? Why complainant did
not narrate the events stated in his Court statement in his
report when he was in the know of the same? Why PW
Abdullah did not sign and verified the report of the
complainant if at all he was there in the hospital with the
deceased then injured? The above mentioned deviation
from the normal and common order are definitely
disrupting for a prudent mind. We tried our level best to
find answers of these questions from the available evidence
but remain unsuccessful. Stay of complainant at the spot of
occurrence, not accompanying his injured brother to the
hospital is an act beyond the human imagination and
comprehension, as in such a crucial eventuality the first
priority near and dear would always be to accompany the
injured to save his precious life. It is also astonishing that
the complainant did not try to nab the appellant,
particularly, when he came across him in the stairs and that
too when he was having information of brawl between the
appellant and his brother. In such like situation, a brother
cannot be expected for such a reaction viz letting a person
free without grapple. The conduct demonstrated by the

complainant is quite against the natural human behaviour.
11

The peculiar facts and circumstances appearing from the
testimony of the complainant are rather suggestive of the
fact that he after getting information qua the incident has
straight away rushed to the hospital where the deceased
then injured had already been shifted by the people and the
complainant having no detail about the events of the
incident reported in two/three lines. He has squarely
modified his version in his Court statement which amounts
to dishonest and deliberate improvements just to bring in
line his testimony with PW Abdullah, therefore, the
learned Trial Court has landed in the field of error by
relying on the testimony of the complainant.

15. Adverting to the statement of purported eyewitness
Abdullah, we would like to mention that the prime
consideration for the Court to accept the testimony of an
eyewitness is to see whether he has established his
presence on the spot at the time of incident as it is settled
law that a witness who claims his presence at the spot must
satisfy mind of the Court through some physical
circumstances or through some corroborative evidence in
support of his presence at the spot. Abdullah while
appearing as PW.6 deposed that on the fateful day at
Hashtnagri Phatak, his father Abdul Ghaffar by giving him
money, send him to see his paternal uncle in Gurh Mandi
and also to bring some Gurh from him. When he reached

Gurh Mandi, he saw from the road that Said Rehman, Said
12

Umar and PW Usman Ali were sitting on the roof of Gurh
Mandi. He also went towards them and noticed a brawl
between the appellant and his deceased uncle. He informed
his father about the quarrel. During the quarrel, the
appellant took out his pistol and fired at Said Rehman, as a
result, he sustained injury. He and PW Usman Ali brought
the injured down stairs and shifted him to the hospital in a
taxi where he succumbed to the injuries in five minutes.

16. A look over the statement of PW Abdullah, reveals
that he has not uttered a single word about arrival of his
father at the spot when the deceased then injured was being
shifted by them to the hospital, while according to
complainant when he reached the spot, he saw his brother
in injured condition and his son Abdullah and Usman were
lifting him and that he after seeing the episode, came down
stairs. The mobile data of PW Abdullah and complainant
has also not been brought on record to corroborate their
testimony qua their contact at the time of the occurrence.
Moreso, the conduct of PW Abdullah like a silent spectator
at the time of brawl is also against the natural human
conduct, particularly, in this part of the world a nephew is
not expected to re-act like a silent spectator in such like
situation. Had there been a brawl between the deceased and
appellant before firing, PW Abdullah being a young boy of
18 years, would have definitely retaliated against the

received threat to the life of his uncle and would have
13

overpowered the appellant, but missing any such activity,
indicate symptoms of his absence at the spot, particularly,
at the occasion of scuffle. This PW has also not explained
as to why he did not make a report about the incident when
he shifted his injured uncle to the hospital and awaited the
arrival of his father/complainant. The statement of PW
Abdullah to the effect that the deceased then injured died
after five minutes of arrival at the hospital also belied the
story narrated by his father, because according to
complainant, deceased then injured was still alive till his
arrival, who statedly had stayed till arrival of the police on
the scene of occurrence and arrest of the appellant by them
which might have consumed more than five minutes. PW
Abdullah has also not furnished any explanation as to why
he did not narrate the entire episode of the incident to his
father/complainant at the time of making report. Moreso, it
is an admitted fact that PW Abdullah has neither reported
the matter to casualty police nor has signed/ verified the
report as a rider, which create a serious dent in the
prosecution case and makes the version of complainant and
alleged eyewitness doubtful regarding the mode and
manner of the occurrence. The inquest report of the
deceased Exh.Pw.2/2 does not bear the name of PW
Abdullah as identifier of the dead body. Only Abdul
Ghafar is cited in the inquest report as identifier. This

witness also deposed about arrest of the appellant by the
14

public at large along with crime weapon and handing over
to the police at the spot.

17. The above discussed facts and circumstances
appearing from the statement of PW Abdullah, we are of
the considered view that he was also not present at the spot
at the time of occurrence. Had he been present, he would
have never let off the appellant, rather his normal re-action
would have been an attack over the appellant. Likewise,
had this PW been present with the deceased then injured,
the assailant would have never speared him too, so as to
eliminate evidence behind him. In this view of the matter,
PW Abdullah has squarely failed to establish his presence
at the spot.

18. The version of PW Abdullah and complainant
Abdul Ghafar regarding arrest of the appellant on the spot
by the public at large along with crime pistol is negated by
Malang Jan S.I (PW.7), who has tendered a divergent
statement regarding arrest and recovery of crime pistol
from the appellant, as according to him on receipt of
information about presence of the appellant involved in
case FIR No.944 dated 08.10.2012 under section 302 PPC,
PS Shaheed Gulfat Hussain (the present case), he
alongwith other police officials rushed to Grain Market
Gurh Mandi and arrested the appellant and recovered 30
bore pistol loaded with three live rounds of the same bore

from his trouser folder, resultantly, separate FIR No. 945
15

dated 08.10.2012, under section 13 West Pakistan Arms
Ordinance, 1965, was registered against him. The time of
arrest of the appellant in case FIR No.945 is shown as
17.25 hours, viz after registration of the instant case FIR.
This fact found support from record, rather from having a
glance at FIR No.945, wherein reference has been made to
the FIR of the instant case. The haphazard contrastive and
incompatible stances of complainant and Malang Jan S.I.
has created a state of disarray and confusion with regard to
the time of occurrence, arrest of the appellant and recovery
of pistol from his possession. Admittedly, the appellant
was arrested at the spot in presence of the complainant and
was handed over to the police and thereafter, the
complainant left for the hospital, where he lodged the
report about the occurrence. In such an eventuality, making
reference to the instant FIR in FIR No.945 is not a mystry,
whilst artifacts suggestive on an artificial and artly
contrived story. We have also noted that Malang Jan SI has
not uttered a single word about arrest of the appellant along
with pistol by the public at large as stated by complainant
and PW Abdullah. In this view of the matter, there are two
versions about the arrest of the appellant and recovery of
the alleged crime pistol, one furnished by complainant and
PW Abdullah and the other by PW Malang Jan SI, which
one is correct, will be best known to them, however, this

create serious doubts about the arrest and recovery of the
16

alleged crime weapon, thus, the learned Trial Court has
fallen in error while believing and relying on the testimony
of this witness.

19. So far as the the testimony of PW Usman Ali is
concerned, the complainant has not named him as
eyewitness in his report/FIR. He has been introduced as
eyewitness, later on, after a delay of eight days of the
occurrence and his statement under section 164 Cr.P.C.
was recorded on 16.10.2012. Though, this PW has charged
the appellant for the commission of the offence, but has not
furnished any explanation, much less plausible, qua his
long silence. Albeit, statement of a witness recorded at a
belated stage will not be fatal if a plausible and convincing
explanation is furnished qua the delay, but where the delay
is not explained and said witness has been introduced at a
later stage purposely maneuvered to implicate the accused
such a delay would adversely affect the prosecution case
and no explicit reliance can be placed on the evidence of
such witness. Same is the position of PW Usman Ali, as
complainant Abdul Ghafar deposed that when he reached
on the roof top of the building, he saw his son Abdullah
along with one Usman Ali lifting the injured, which means
that it was in the knowledge of PW Abdullah and
complainant that Usman Ali has also witnessed the
occurrence, but this PW has neither been cited as

eyewitness nor was examined by the I.O. on the same day
17

of occurrence. In case titled, “Syed Saeed Muhammad
Shah and another Vs The State” (1993 SCMR 550), the
Hon’ble Supreme Court has laid down the principle about
testimony of such witness in following words:-
“In the absence of satisfactory nature of
explanation normally rule is that statements
recorded by police after delay and without
explanation are to be ruled out of
consideration”.
In case titled, “Ismail and others Vs the State (1983 P Cr
L J 823), referred by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
(1993 SCMR 550), evidence of witnesses was ruled out of
consideration on the ground that their police statements
were recorded after 08 days and prosecution offered no
explanation. Similarly, in case titled, “Sirajuddin Vs Kala
and another” (PLD 1964 SC 26), evidence of such a
witness was held to be not reliable for the reasons of patent
doubt as to the time as he first appeared before the police
for his statement. Same view has been reiterated by the
Hon’ble apex Court in case titled, “Muhammad Khan Vs
Maula Bakhsh and another” (1998 SCMR 570) in the
following words:-
“Tt is a settled law that credibility of a witness
is looked with serious suspicion if his
statement under section 161 Cr.P.C. is

recorded with delay without offering any

plausible explanation”.
18

Same is the view of the Hon’ble apex Court in case titled,
Ghulam Qadir & 2 others Vs the State” (2008 SCMR
1221), the hon’ble apex Court.

20. Deriving wisdom from the judgments of the
Hon’ble apex Court, the learned Trial Court has wrongly
believed and relied upon the testimony of PW Usman Ali.
21. So far as the FSL report qua the 30 bore crime
empty and pistol allegedly recovered from the appellant,
is concerned, as stated earlier, this piece of evidence being
highly doubtful about the arrest and recovery of the pistol
in light of the statement of purported eyewitnesses and
Malang Jan SI, the seizing Officer, would not advance the
prosecution case. Besides, when the ocular account of the
prosecution case has been disbelieved, mere recovery of
the pistol and crime empty, would not be sufficient for
recording conviction in light of ratio of the judgment of
apex Court in case titled, “Mst. Sughra Begum and
another Vs Qaisar Pervez and others” (2015 SCMR
1142), wherein it has been held that once the ocular
account was disbelieved then no other evidence, even of a
high degree and value, would be sufficient for recording
conviction on a capital charge.

22. Recovery of blood from the spot, the last worn
blood stained garments of the deceased and unnatural
death of the deceased with firearm as per postmortem

report, prove the factum of murder of the deceased, but
19

never tell the name (s) of the culprit/killer. Such pieces of
evidence are always considered as corroborative pieces of
evidence and are taken along with direct evidence and not
in isolation as held by the Hon’ble Suprme Court in Riaz
Ahmed’s case (2010 SCMR 846), Ijaz Ahmed’s case
(1997 SCMR 1279 and Asadullah’s case (PLD 1971 SC
541). It has been held by the apex Court in case titled,
“Saifullah Vs the State” (1985 SCMR 410), that when
there is no eyewitness to be relied upon, then there is
nothing, which can be corroborated by the recovery.

23. In light of our above discussion, we would not
hesitate to hold that the prosecution has miserably failed
to prove the guilt of the appellant through cogent and
confidence inspiring evidence, beyond shadow of
reasonable doubt, rather the prosecution evidence is
pregnant with doubts, contradictions, dishonest
improvements benefit of which has to be extended to the
appellant. It is settled law that prosecution is duty bound
to prove its case beyond any reasonable doubt and if any
single and slightest doubt is crated, benefit of the same
must got to the accused and entitled the accused for
acquittal as the accused is always considered the most
favourable child of law. Guidance in this regard can be
derived from case titled, “Tariq Pervaz Vs the State”
(1995 SCMR 1345) and case titled, “Muhammad

Akram Vs the State (2009 SCMR 230) and Faryad Alis
20

case (2008 SCMR 1086). The learned Trial Court has
failed to appreciate the evidence in its true perspective and
has arrived at an erroneous conclusion by holding the
appellant guilty of the offence, hence, the impugned
judgment is liable to be set aside.

24. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed. The
conviction and sentence of the appellant recorded by the
learned Trial Court vide impugned judgment are hereby
set aside and the appellant is acquitted of the charge
leveled against him. He be set at liberty, if not wanted in
any other criminal case.

25. On acquittal of the appellant, the Murder
Reference No.2 of 2016, sent by the learned Trial Court
for confirmation of death sentence of the appellant is
answered in the Negative.
