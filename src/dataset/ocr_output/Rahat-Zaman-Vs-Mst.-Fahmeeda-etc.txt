JUDGMENT
ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- Through

the instant petition under section 561-A Cr.P.C., petitioner
Rahat Zaman, seeks quashment of order dated 23.04.2015,
rendered by learned Trial Court/ Additional Sessions
Judge-I], Swabi, whereby he while allowing the
application of Mst. Fahmeeda alias Hameeda
(mother of Asad Amin deceased), returned case FIR
No.212 dated 21.08.2014 registered U/Ss
457/458/380/397/511/100 PPC and Ss 13 and 15 Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013, Police Station Swabi, to the
prosecution with the following directions:-
1. Place Rahat Zaman the then complainant in
column of the accused.
2. Re-investigate the case in hand to the extent
of version of Mst. Hameeda set forth by her

in her statement under section 164 Cr.P.C.

through an impartial competent police

officer.
3. Re-submit challan in the Court within 10

days positively.
2. Facts in brief, forming the background of the
instant petition are that, on 21.08.2014 at 07.00 hours,
Rahat Zaman complainant reported to local police that on
the fateful night he was sleeping in his house, situated in
the fields of Natiyan; that at 00.50 hours, on barking of pet
dog, he woke up and in the meantime, somebody fired at
the door of his room; that he in his self-defence, also fired
from inside the room and after 10/15 minutes, when he
came out from the room, noticed a person lying dead
alongwith 30 bore pistol in the courtyard of his house; that
he further noticed identity card in the name of Latif Jan son
of Rasool Shah, resident of Mohallah Kanju Khel, lying
near the Eastern wall of his house. He charged deceased
Asad Amin (dead accused) and his unknown companions
for entering into his house for the purpose of committing
theft. He produced his pistol and Identity Card of said Latif
Jan to local police on the spot. Report of the complainant
report was reduced into writing in the shape of murasila by
Fawad Ali Khan ASI, on the basis of which, FIR
mentioned above was registered. He prepared injury sheet

and inquest report of the deceased and shifted his dead

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

body to the mortuary for postmortem examination. He took
into possession the CNIC of the deceased alongwith his 30
bore pistol without number and 3 live rounds, secured
blood and 2 empties of 30 bore pistol from the place of the
deceased as well as two empties of 30 bore from the place
of Rahat Zamant complainant through various recovery
memos and prepared site plan.

3. On the next day i.e. 22.08.2014, Rahat
Zaman complainant recorded his statement under section
164 Cr.P.C., wherein he nominated the unknown culprits/
companions of dead accused to be Latif Jan and
Muhammad Abbas, and also charged them for commission
of the offence. Both the above named accused, were
arrested on 22.08.2014, who during interrogation, pointed
out the crime spot, consequent whereupon, additions were
made in the site plan. After completion of investigation,
challan was submitted against accused Latif and
Muhammad Abbas.

4. In the meantime, Mst. Hameeda, mother of
deceased Asad Amin, filed an application under section
22-A Cr.P.C., before the learned Justice of Peace Swabi,
for registration of FIR against Rahat Zaman for murder of

her deceased son, but the same was dismissed vide order

dated 27.10.2014. The operative part of the order of Justice
of Peace read as under:-
“Since the petitioner has already been allowed
by this Court (even dated order), passed in
Criminal Revision No.15/CR dated 17.10.2014
to record her statement under section 164
Cr.P.C. before the Court of Ilaqa/ Judicial
Magistrate, Swabi in case FIR No.212 dated
21.08.2014 under section 457/380/511/100 PPC
read with S.13 and 15 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Arms Act, 2013, lodged at P.S. Permooli,
earlier got registered in respect of same
occurrence, therefore, registration of second
FIR deems not appropriate. Instant petition,
therefore, dismissed being without merits”.
Statement of Mst. Hameeda under section 164 Cr.P.C. was
recorded on 11.11.2014, by the learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate, Swabi wherein she charged accused
Muhammad Abbas, Latif Jan and Rahmat Zaman
(complainant of the instant case) for committing the
murder of her son. However, on completion of
investigation, proceedings against dead co-accused were
abated and challan was submitted only against accused
Muhammad Abbas and Latif Jan before the learned Trial

Court where both the accused were summoned and

formally charge-sheeted, to which they pleaded not guilty
and claimed trial. In the meantime, Mst. Hameeda filed an
application before the learned Trial Court for arraying
complainant Rahat Zaman in panel of the accused, which
was disposed of in the above terms, as mentioned in
Paragraph first of the judgment, hence, this petition by
complainant Rahat Zaman.

5. Learned counsel for the petitioner argued
that recovery of dead body of the deceased Asad Amin
from the courtyard of the house of complainant alongwith
pistol, two crime empties near the deceased as well as
bullet marks on the door of room of house of complainant,
recovery of pistol of the dead accused coupled with
recovery of Identity card of co-accused Latif Jan, are
material pieces of evidence, which prima facie establishes
the version of the complainant that the deceased alongwith
his co-accused in order to commit theft, entered the house
of complainant and fired at the door of his room, therefore,
there was no other option with the complainant but to
re-act in his self defence in the mode and manner as
alleged by him; that the version of complainant was found
true by the Investigating Officer, therefore, he has rightly

been not arrayed as an accused. He submitted that the

impugned order of the learned Trial Court being against
the law and facts is liable to be set at naught.

6. Conversely, learned AAG contended that in
case of placing complainant Rahat Zaman in column of the
accused of the instant case, the other two co-accused
charged by him for the commission of offence in his house
would succeed in getting acquittal. However, learned
counsel for the respondent Mst. Hameeda supported the
impugned order and sought dismissal of the instant
petition.

7. I have considered the respective submissions
advanced from either side and perused the record with
their able assistance.

8. Under the law, it is an accused person to
agitate the plea of self-defence and to prove the same
during trial in light of the pre-requisites contemplated
under section 100 PPC. The impugned order of the learned
Trial Court directing the Investigating Officer to place
complainant Rahat Zaman in column of the accused of
challan of the instant case, would be quite appropriate in
case of allegation of theft and reasonable apprehension of
danger to the life and property of complainant Rahat
Zaman only against the dead accused. In such

eventualities, the complainant being a sole accused could

agitate the plea of self-defence, but situation in this
particular case is quite contrary, as the complainant has not
only charged the dead accused Asad Amin for committing
theft in his house and firing, but also charged accused Latif
Jan and Muhammad Abbas the companions of dead
accused for the commission of offence. The Identity card
of co-accused Latif Jan has also been recovered from the
house of complainant, which was handed over to the police
by him at the time of report. So, if complainant Rahat
Zaman is arrayed as an accused in this case, the
prosecution will be deprived of most important and
material evidence of the complainant against accused Latif
Jan and Muhammad Abbas, which may ultimately result
their acquittal. The learned Justice of Peace has erred in
law while refusing registration of FIR on the application
under section 22-A Cr.P.C. of mother of the deceased
against complainant Rahat Zaman as well as accused Latif
Jan and Muhammad Abbas for murder of her son Asad
Amin. Keeping in view the peculiar facts and
circumstances of the case, separate FIR against
complainant of the instant case Rahat Zaman as well as the
other two accused named above, on the application of
mother of the deceased, would be a proper course, wherein

Rahat Zaman in the capacity of an accused can take the

plea of self-defence and if during investigation, the
Investigating Officer found his plea true and the version of
Mst. Hameeda as false, he may either recommend
cancellation of the FIR, defer the arrest of the accused or
by placing him/ them in column No.2 of the challan due to
deficient evidence followed by obtaining a bond with or
without sureties as provided under section 169 Cr.P.C. and
can recommend the discharge of the accused or if
otherwise the I.O. succeeds in collecting sufficient
evidence in support of the version of Mst. Hameeda, he
may proceed against the accused in accordance with
section 170 and 173 Cr.P.C. by placing them as regular
accused in the relevant column of the challan. The findings
of the Investigating Officer in the instant case regarding
justification of the the plea of self-defence agitated by
complainant Rahat Zaman not in the capacity of an
accused, are squarely against the law because as stated
earlier it is only an accused person to agitate the plea of
self defence and not a complainant. Thus, registration of
two separate FIRs about the same incident, would be an
appropriate step to do justice with both the alleged victims
of the incident.

9. For what has been discussed above, the order

of the learned Trial Court dated 23.04.2015 and that of

learned Justice of Peace dated 27.10.2014, are hereby
quashed. Accordingly, the application under section 22-A
Cr.P.C. filed by Mst. Hameeda is allowed and SHO Police
Station Permooli is directed to register a separate FIR
against the accused named on the application of
Mst. Hameeda mother of deceased Asad Amin against the
accused nominated in her application, to investigate both
the cases independently and to submit challan within a

fortnight, positively.

10. This petition is disposed of in the above
terms.
11. The Additional Registrar (Judicial) of this

court is directed to send copy this judgment to the learned
Sessions Judge, Swabi, who shall circulate its copy among
the Additional Sessions Judges, posted in District Swabi,
for their future guidance, with intimation to this Court.
