Cr. B.A. No.S- 772 of 2020

DATE ORDER WITH SIGNATURE OF JUDGE(S)

1. For orders on office objection.
2. For hearing of main case.

05.10.2020
Syed Bakhshal Shah, Advocate for applicant.

Ms. Sobia Bhatti, A.P.G, Sindh.

ABDUL MAALIK GADDI, J.-Through this bail application, the

applicant seeks post-arrest bail in Crime No.98 of 2020, registered at Police
Station A-Section Dadu, under sections 324, 336-B, 458, 504, 147, 148, 149, 337-
A(i), 337-F(i) PPC.

2. Perusal of record reveals that earlier bail application moved by the
present applicant for grant of post-arrest bail was dismissed vide order dated
11.05.2020. Thereafter, applicant repeated his bail plea which was also
declined vide order dated 07.07.2020, passed by learned Additional Sessions
Judge-IV, Dadu in Cr. Bail Application No.989 of 2020. Then applicant

approached this Court thorough instant application for same relief.

3. As per F.LR, the allegation against the Applicant is that on 14.04.2020,
present applicant alongwith co-accused Munawar and others entered into
complainant / victim’s house, thrown acid on her person and thereby caused
injuries on her face, neck, abdomen, legs and other parts of body; she made
cries and then accused fled away. Thereafter, complainant / victim lodged

F.LR.

4, Learned counsel for the applicant during course of arguments,
reiterated the grounds as mentioned in the memo of bail application and
further submitted that after issuance of final medical certificate case of the
applicant becomes as of further inquiry; that the applicant is innocent; that the
F.LR. is false and fabricated and the applicant has falsely been implicated in
this case; that the case of the applicant does not fall within the prohibitory
clause of section 497 Cr.P.C; therefore, the applicant is entitled for bail. Under

these circumstances, he prays for grant of bail to the applicant.
5. Learned A.P.G Sindh while opposing the bail application has submitted
that applicant has sprinkled acid upon the complainant and thereby caused
injuries to her in a brutal manner; that section 336-B PPC is punishable for 14
years; therefore case of the applicant falls within prohibitory clause of section

497 Cr.P.C and he deserves no relief.
6. Arguments heard and record perused.

7. It is noted that due to matrimonial dispute on 14.04.2020 present
applicant alongwith co-accused entered the house of complainant and thrown
acid upon her which caused serious injuries on different parts of her person;
thereafter, the victim lady received medical treatment at Civil Hospital
Karachi; that the applicant has actively participated in the commission of
offence; that the applicant has been fully nominated in the F.I.R. with specific
role; that there is no question of identification because complainant party
knew the applicant prior to this incident very well and she has fully
implicated him with specific role in the commission of offence; that the alleged
offence is punishable up to 14 years, hence the case of applicant falls within

prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C.

8. Moreover, at bail stage only a tentative assessment has to be made and
deeper appreciation is not permissible. In the present case, complainant and
P.Ws have implicated the applicant with the commission of alleged offence;
hence tentatively the applicant has committed the alleged offence in the
manner as alleged in the F.LR; thus at this stage he is not entitled for any

concession.

9. In view of above, I feel no hesitation but to dismiss the instant bail
application. However, since this is a injury case of brutal nature, therefore, the
trial Court is directed to proceed with the same expeditiously and decide the
same preferably within a period of 60 working days from the receipt of this
order and submit compliance report through Additional Registrar of this

Court.

10. Needless to mention that the observations made hereinabove are
tentative in nature and the trial Court shall not be influenced upon by any of

them while proceeding with and deciding the case on merits.

11. =‘ Bail application stands disposed of alongwith pending applicant(s).
