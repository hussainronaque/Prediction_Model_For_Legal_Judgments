under sections 324/353/34 PPC, section 4/5 ESA,

section 6/7 ATA, section 15 AA of KPK at police

station CTD, Hazara Region, Abbottabad was

registered. The investigation of the case was handed

over to Hamayun Khan, Inspector CTD PW-7. On

16.07.2015 the complainant arrested accused Mula ud

Din and Abul Salam whereas accused Isam Khan,
-4-

who allegedly sold the weapon to accused Mula ud

Din, was arrested on 22.07.2016. On 25.7.2015 the

prosecution produced Musharaf Din PW-4 for

recording his statement under section 164 Cr.P.C. He

has narrated in his statement that he is plying a Jeep

for the purpose of rent from palas to pattan. On

11.07.2015 he took accused Allauddin and Asadullah

(whose names latter known to him) to Pattan in his

Jeep.

3. After completion of investigation, challan

was submitted against was submitted against accused.

The accused were summoned and after providing

relevant copies under section 265-C Cr.PC, charge

was framed against them, to which they did not plead

guilty and claimed trial. Asadullah died and

proceedings him were abated. The prosecution in

order to prove guilt of accused, produced and

examined as many as eighteen (07) witnesses. After

close of the prosecution evidence, statements of
-5-

accused were recorded under section 342 Cr.PC,

wherein they professed innocence, they did not opt to

produce defence evidence or to be examined on oath

as provided under section 340 (2) Cr.PC. Learned

trial Court after hearing arguments of learned counsel

for the parties, vide impugned judgment dated

12.03.2016. We also noted that on 27.10.2015 the

learned trial Court recorded the statement of accused

Abdul Salam, wherein he stated that the accused Mula

ud Din and Asadullah hired his care on rent of

Rs.7000/- for taking them to Tangir on the way they

were stopped by police at Matta Banda. Accused

Mula ud Din and Asadullah forced him to continue.

However, he had to stop the care and made good his

escape.

4. Learned counsel appeared on behalf of

the appellants has argued that the prosecution has

failed to produce any cogent evidence to bring home

charge against the appellants, the contents of FIR is
-6-

not supported by the site plan, although joint

investigation team was constituted but no efforts have

been made by the joint investigation team to trace the

ownership and call data regarding the mobile and the

SIM recovered from the vehicle. She further argued

that indeed this was a case of no evidence and

Musharaf Din PW was introduced to strengthen the

prosecution case, however, if his statement is perused

the same is full of contradiction and gives an

impression that the prosecution has tutored the said

witness against the appellants and no identification

parade was carried to identify the appellants.

5. On the other hand, learned Assistant

Advocate General while contoverting the arguments

of the learned counsel for appellants has argued that

the prosecution has established the case beyond

reasonable doubt and has successfully established the

names of appellants with the recovered weapons. He

further stated that Musharaf Din PW is a private and
-7-

independent witness, hence, no malafide can be

attributed to him.

6. Arguments heard and record perused.

7. The prosecution case mainly hings on the

evidence of PW Musharaf Din. As per record PW

Musharaf Din recorded his statement on 25.7.2015

after 09 days of the arrest of appellants. The question

that how Musharaf was associated with the

investigation and why his statement was recorded on

25.7.2015 is the questions which remained un-

answered before the trial Court and investigation.

Since PW Musharaf Din is a material witness, hence

his testimony has been viewed in the primes of

guidelines settled by the superior Court for

appreciating evident. The close perusal of his first

statement recorded under section 164 Cr.P.C would

suggest that he took the Allauddin and Asadullah

accused in his Jeep to Pattan. The accused were not

earlier known to him. His this statement if assumed to
-8-

be correct, even then does not connect the appellants

with the incident as narrated in the FIR. While

appearing as PW in the present case, he in cross

examination has admitted that he did not remember

that who told him the names of accused Mula ud Din

and Asadullah. He further stated that the same might

have been provided to him by SHO. In such situation

it was incumbent upon the prosecution to have

conducted identification parade of the accused under

the supervision of Judicial Magistrate to establish at

least the presence of accused Asadullah and Mula ud

Din at evening time in palas. As per statement of

Muhammad Raziq Khan PW-2 he received spy

information wherein he names of accused were

disclosed who would transport arms ammunitions in a

non-custom vehicle bearing registration

No.PSLMS/UI just half an hour before the alleged

time of intercepting the said vehicle. The most

important aspect of the case is the identity of the

accused Mulauddin, Asadullah and Abdul Salam. The
-9-

perusal of site plan would reveal that the investigation

officer has given specific place/point to Mulauddin

and Asadullah. In the site plan Ex:PW7/1. However,

neither in FIR nor Muhammad Raziq Khan S.I and

Abdul Wahab S.I in their statements have uttered a

single word about the identity of the aforesaid

accused in their statements in the Court. They do not

say that either the accused were known to them or had

identified them while they were decamping from the

place of occurrence. It is not the case of prosecution

that the complainant had identified the accused,

however, he was provided the names of accused.

Hence in order to strengthen the prosecution case

against the appellants who were arrested 16.7.2016

having no evidence against them except the spy

information. The possibility of planting Musharaf Din

cannot be ruled out as his association with the

investigation at belated stage in an un-answered query

which creates doubt in the prosecution case. Now

moving to the case of Isam Khan, the only evidence
-10-

disclosed by the investigating officer against him is

that accused Mulauddin had disclosed his name to

have purchased rocket launcher from him. Other then

statement of co-accused there is no evidence against

Isam Khan. The prosecution has not bothered to

investigate that whether Isam Khan was involved in

such like business or not. The statement of co-accused

during the police custody is inadmissible. Article

case law . Now coming to the statement of

Abdul Salam recorded before the trial Court. In the

said statement he has stated that:-

“T am driver of Taxi vehicle No.PS-LMS-U-
1. I drive the taxi on the local route. Five
days prior to the occurrence two persons
who were then not known to me but later ii
came to know them as Mulah-ud-Din and
Asad Ullah took my car on payment of
Rs.5000/-. They again after about five days
on 11/07/2015 came to me and again asked
me to give them my car for going to Tangeer
from Pattan. We struck the bargain for
Rs.7000/- and I told them that I shall take
them myself. From Pattan they loaded some
bag wrapped in a blanket which was put in
the trunk of the car and we started our
return journey. On the way we were stopped
by the police at Mata Banda but Mulah-ud-
Din and Asad Ullah forced me to continue
but then exchange of gun fire started taking
place and I went in the vehicle and ran
away. I returned to my village from where I
-ll-

was later arrested. I did not know that the
accused were carrying any contraband.”

The said statement was recorded on 27.102.015 by the

learned trial Court much before the framing of charge

against him on 24.10.2016. From such statement it

does not appear that the learned trial Court has made

any effort that the accused was made to understand

the meaning and consequences of his statement. Even

the certificate at the bottom of the statement does not

mention that the such statement was recorded in the

presence of prosecution officer, the accused was made

to understand the consequences of his statement or

either accused would read the said statement. Since at

the relevant time the accused was not represented by

his learned counsel, hence the Presiding Officer was

requested to have ensured that he statement was

voluntary and the accused understand the

consequences of the statement. Even otherwise,

subsequent to the said statement at the time of

framing charge the accused denied the allegation.

Even the said Musharaf Din in his statement under
-12-
section 164 Cr.P.C did not give any description of the
accused. He did not mention anything about the age,
height or the language being spoken by the persons

who boarded in his Jeep.

8. For what has been discussed above a
conclusion is irresistible and unavoidable that the
prosecution had failed to prove its case against the
appellants beyond reasonable doubt. These appeals
are, therefore, allowed, the conviction and sentence of
the appellants are set aside and they are acquitted of
the charges by extending benefit of doubt to them.
They shall be released from Jail forthwith if not
required to be detained in connect with any other

case.

Announced. JUDGE

JUDGE

The requirement of the criminal case is that prosecution is duty bound
to prove its case beyond any reasonable doubt and if any single and
slightest doubt is created, benefit of the same must go to the accused
-13-

and it would be sufficient to discredit the prosecution story and entitle
the accused for acquittal. It is well embedded principle of criminal
justice that there is no need of so many doubts in the prosecution case,
rather any reasonable doubt arising out of the prosecution evidence,
pricking the judicial mind is sufficient for acquittal of the accused. In
case titled, "Tariq Pervaz v. The State" (1995 SCMR 1345) the august
Supreme Court was pleased to ruled that for giving the benefit of
doubt, it is not necessary that there should be many circumstances,
creating doubt. If there is circumstance which creates reasonable doubt
in a prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, the accused would be
entitled to the benefit of doubt not as a matter of grace or concession
but as a matter of right. The same principle was reiterated by the apex
Court in case titled, "Muhammad Akram v. The State" (2009 SCMR
230) and it was observed that it is an axiomatic principle of law that in
case of doubt, the benefit thereof must occurred in favour of the
accused as a matter of right and not of grace. The above principles laid
down by the apex Court are fully in consonance with a famous maxim
that "it is better that ten guilty persons be acquitted rather than one
innocent person be convicted". Moreover, accused is always
considered as the most favourite child of law and every benefit of
doubt goes to him regardless of fact whether he has taken any such
plea or not. Reliance placed on case titled, "Faryad Ali v. State" (2008
SCMR 1086).
