R.F.A No.85-A/2017.
JUDGMENT

Date of hearing 02.11.2018.

Petitioner by: Mr. Tahir Faraz Abbasi, Advocate.

Respondent in person.

SYED MUHAMMAD _ATTIQUE SHAH, J.- The
appellants through the instant appeal have called into
question the validity and legality of judgment and decree
passed by the learned Referee Judge/Additional District
Judge-II, Haripur dated 21.06.2017, whereby while
partially accepting the objection petition of the
respondent/objector, held him entitled to receive
compensation as per Ex CW-1/I i.e. the average price of
the land in question in the year 2011/12, along with 15 %
compulsory acquisition charges and 6% simple interest
from the date of taking possession till payment.

2. Brief facts of the case are that the land of the
petitioner comprised in Khasra Nos. 520, 521, 89, 106,
105, 312, 92 and 96 of Mauza Amgah, Tehsil & District

Haripur was acquired by the appellant for Hassan Abdal-
Havelian-Mansehra Expressway (E-35) through award
No. 31 dated 26.06.2012. In the said award the
compensation of the acquired land was fixed in the light
of one year average for the year 2009/2010. Feeling
aggrieved, the land owner/respondent filed objection
petition claiming therein that the price of land is much
higher than the one assessed by the acquiring department
keeping in view the location and future potentiality and
prayed for fixation of price of acquired land as
Rs.8,00,000/- per Kanal. The said objection petition was
referred to the learned Referee Judge for adjudication. The
learned Referee Judge, on receipt of objection petition,
summoned the respondents who put appearance and
contested the same on various legal as well as factual
grounds. After framing issues and recording pro and
contra evidence, the learned Referee Judge partially
allowed the objection petition through impugned
judgment and decree dated 21.06.2017, by enhancing the

amount of compensation as per Ex CW-1/1 (one year

average for the year 2011/2012) as under:-

S.No. Kind of Land Rate per Marla | Rate per Kanal
(Rs.) (Rs.)

1. Baari 13,348/52 266,970/40

2. Maira 5933/12 118,662/40

3. Rakkar Kalsi 2966/56 59,331/20

4. Kund 8899/68 177,993/60

5. Ghair Mazroha 1483/28 29,665/60

Feeling aggrieved, the appellants have filed
instant appeal.
3% Arguments heard and record of the case was
perused with valuable assistance of learned counsel for the
patties.
4. Perusal of record reveals that Award under
Section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was issued
on 26.06.2012 whereby the landed property of the
respondent was acquired from Mauza Aamgah, Tehsil &
District Haripur. In the said Award, the worthy collector,
while assessing the market value of the land, has relied
upon one-year average price of the land from 26.03.2009
to 26.03.2010 (Ex RW-1/5) according to which the price

of different kinds of land was assessed as tabulated

below:-

S. No. Kind of Land Rate per Marla | Rate per Kanal
| (Rs.) (Rs.)

1. Baari 8561.32 171226.4

yy Maira 2853.77 57075.4

3. Rakkar Kalsi 1426.88 28537.6

4. Kund 4280.66 85613.2

5. Bangar Qadeem_| 713.44 14268.8

6. Ghair Mazroha 713.44 14268.8

Patwari Halqa (OW-1) produced revenue record in
respect of the acquired property, according to which the
property acquired from the respondent was of Bari, Kund,

Maira & Banjar Qadeem types total measuring 2 Kanals
and 15 Marlas. The respondent objector though claimed
that the acquired property was having the much higher rate
than the one assessed by the Collector, however, the
mutations produced by the Patwari Halqa (OW-1) show
that the claim of the respondent for fixation of price of the
acquired land at the rate of Rs. 800,000/- per Kanal is not
justified. However, since the Award was announced in the
year 2012, therefore, the worthy Collector was required to
have assessed the price of land in the light of one-year
average for that very year, in the light of amendment made
in Section 23 of The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 through Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Ordinance No. XVII of 2001, which is reproduced below
for ease reference:-

“23. (1) In determining the amount

of compensation to be awarded for

land acquired under this Act the

Court shall take into consider

consideration. -

[firstly, the market-value of the

Land at the date of taking

possession of the land.]----”
5. The aforementioned amendment in Section
23 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, clearly envisages
that the price of the land would be assessed in the light of

market value of the land prevailing at the time of taking its

possession. Admittedly, the appellants have taken
possession of the acquired land in the year 2012, therefore,
the learned Referee Judge was justified to enhance the
compensation of the land in the light of one-year average
for the year 2011/2012.

6. Learned counsel for the appellant has failed
to point out any misreading, nor-reading of evidence or
any legal or jurisdictional error in the impugned judgment
passed by the learned Referee Judge, therefore, appeal in

hand being devoid of any merits, stands dismissed.
