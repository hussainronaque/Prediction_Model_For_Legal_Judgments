2. Complainant Mst. Shabana Bibi (PW-3)
made a report to police on 22.06.2018 at 14:00 hours
to the effect that some two years ago her marriage
was solemnized with appellant Ghaffar son of Sahib
Zar whereas Mst. Izzat Jan daughter of Sahib Zar
was married to her father Gul Muhammad Khan
(deceased). Her mother Izzat Jan had gone to Kalail,
District Buner for celebrating Eid-ul-Fitr whereas
she herself had come to the house of her parents a
few days before Fid-ul-Fitr. On 22.06.2018 at 09:00
hours her husband and father-in-law (the appellants)
came to the house of her father situated at village
Baila Bashigram and she served them with tea
whereafter they made a demand from her father for
taking her back to their house. In reply, her father

asked them to bring his wife Mst. Izzat Jan to his

house and take his daughter. On this issue an
altercation took place between them during which
appellant Sahib Zar caught hold of her father
whereas her husband Ghaffar struck him with a
stone causing severe injuries on his head. The
appellants decamped from the spot whereas the
injured was shifted to hospital with the help of
relatives, however, he succumbed to the injuries on
the way. The complainant mentioned the motive
behind the occurrence as altercation over the females
issue and claimed that she, her brother Saddam
Hussain. (PW-4) and many other people have

witnessed the occurrence.

3. Inspector Shahinshah (PW-5), the then
SHO of P.S Madyan reduced report of the
complainant into Murasila Ex.PA and sent the same
to police station for registration of FIR. He also
prepared injury sheet as well as inquest report of the
deceased and handed over the dead body to
Dr. Tanveer Ullah Khan (PW-6) who after

ba: Hon’ble Mr. Justice tshtfaq (brahim

of the appellants. They were formally indicted for
the offence to which they did not plead guilty and
claimed trial. Prosecution examined ten PWs in
support of its case against the appellants who once
again denied allegations of prosecution during their
examination u/s 342, Cr.P.C. The trial concluded
with the arguments of learned counsel for the parties
including the learned APP for State. Finally the_
learned trial Court announced ‘its judgment on
16.09.2020 and found both the appellants guilty of
the offence, hence, convicted and sentenced them as
mentioned | earlier. Being aggrieved, both the
appellants have jointly preferred this appeal whereas
complainant has filed the connected revision petition
with the prayer for enhancement of the sentence

awarded to the appellants by learned trial Court.
a We have gone through the record with

able assistance of learned counsel for the parties

including the learned Assistant A.G. for State.

6. Prosecution has based its case on ocular
account furnished by complainant Mst. Shabana Bibi
(PW-3) and her brother Saddam Hussain (PW-4),

medical evidence and other circumstantial evidence

Tajamul/Ps*

in shape of site plan and incriminating recoveries

coupled with positive FSL report.

According to record, place of
occurrence is house of deceased Gul Muhammad
Khan situated in Nao Banda, a hilly area, at a
distance of 18/20 kilometers from police station
Madyan. According ‘to site plan Ex.PW-10/1, the
said house is surrounded by forest on two sides
while on the northern and western sides there are
ravines meant for rain water, hence, no house is
there adjacent to the house of deceased. There is
female relationship between the parties; complainant
Mst. Shahbana is wife of appellant/convict Ghaffar
Khan whereas his sister Mst. Izzat Jan was wife of
deceased Gul Muhammad Khan. Both the parties are
Gujar by caste. Family of deceased is residing in
District Swat whereas the accused side hails from
the adjacent District Buner. As emerging from the
evidence, marriages of the said two females were
result of exchange (watta satta) and both the
appellants had visited the house of deceased to take
back the complainant to their house who had come
to the house of her father on the eve of Fid-ul-Fitr.
Since, the appellants had not brought wife of

deceased Mst. Izzat Jan from Buner and they were

Taamuiyese|

be: Hon’ble Mr. Justice tshtleg Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiger Ahmed
-7-

desirous of taking back the complainant, as such,
initially an altercation took place between the
deceaséd and appellants which culminated in his
death through blows of stones by appellant Ghaffar
Khan. The motive so set up by complainant in her

report stands to reason in view of the watta satta

marriages and this relationship between the parties is’

neither disputed nor controverted by defence.

Z Complainant and her brother Saddam
Hussain are natural eye witnesses of the occurrence
being residents of the same house where the
occurrence took place. They have recorded consistent
statements wherein they have not only confirmed
presence of each other in the same house at the time
of océurrence but they have also supported each
other with regard to the time of arrival of the
appellants to their house as well as the time of
occurrence. Nothing was brought on record during
their cross-examination to create a slightest doubt
with regard to their presence in the same house at the
time when the deceased was given stone blows by
appellant Ghaffar Khan. Statement of complainant
can be given extra credence for the reason that

though she has lost her father in the same occurrence

Tapmuyrss|

>
on Marke Mr. Justice (shtlag Ibrahim

\
Tajamul/Ps*

-8-

but she: has charged her husband despite of cordial
relations with him as nothing to the contrary has been
brought on the record to this effect. No doubt, the
deceaséd was father of both the eye witnesses,
however, non-availability of an independent witness
in view of the above stated scenario is understable, as
such, prosecution could not be blamed for not
producing an inhabitant of the area as eye witness of
the occurrence. It is by now well settled principle of
criminal law that mere relationship between
witnesses and deceased is not a ground to discard
their evidence. Since both the eye witnesses have
established their presence on the spot at the time of
occurrence and their testimony has not been
shattered, therefore, their statements, being
corroborated by medical and other circumstantial
eviderice, are worth reliance and can safely be relied
upon. Reliance is placed on Anwar Shamim_and
another Vs. The State (2010 SCMR_1791). The rule
laid down by august Supreme Court in the said

judgment is as under:

It is a settled principle of law that mere
relationship between the witnesses and the.
‘deceased is not enough to discard their evidence.
It is duty and obligation of the court for requiring
corroboration of interested witnesses then it must
first ascertain whether he saw the occurrence and

0B: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon‘ble Mc. Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamnuyese|

-9-

was in a position to identify the accused and
whether he should be believed without
corroboration. The witnesses have faced lengthy
cross-examination but their veracity cannot be
shaken by the defence counsel. Both the courts
below have come to the conclusion that their
statements dre of such a nature that their
testimony must be given due weight and were .
believed.

8. ‘The ocular account gets proper
corroboration from medical and other circumstantial
evidence. While reporting the matter, complainant
stated before police that her husband Ghaffar Khan
hit her father with stone due to which he sustained
serious injuries on his head causing his death while
he was being taken to hospital for medical treatment.
Doctor Tanveer Ullah (PW-6) has reported two
wounds on head of the deceased i.e on his occipital
and left temporal regions with blunt object, hence,
medical evidence is in conformity with the contents
of FIR. The occurrence took place in hilly area as is
evident from site plan and photographs of the spot
available on record where stones are abundantly
available one of which lying nearby was lifted by
appellant Ghaffar Khan and hit therewith the
deceased during the scuffle. The blood-stained stone
with which the deceased was hit and clothes of the

deceased have been taken into possession besides

DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon‘ble Mc. Justice Winar Ahmad
-10-
the I.O has also collected blood-stained earth from
the spot. The mentioned objects have been examined
through FSL and Serologist has opined in his report
that ‘it was human blood of the same group’. Thus,
circumstantial evidence on record duly corroborates
the complainant’s version and also validly confirms
the mode.and manner of the occurrence to the extent
that deceased was killed through blows of stone in

his residential house.

9, Although | complainant has charged
both the appellants but she has attributed the role of
hitting her father with stone to appellant Ghaffar
Khan whereas charged appellant Sahib Zar by
stating that he had caught hold of her father at the
time when appellant Ghaffar Khan was giving him
stone blows. As regards the role of appellant Ghaffar
Khan, he is specifically charged for giving stone
blows to deceased which proved fatal and caused his
death. Prosecution has proved the above allegation
against appellant Ghaffar Khan through confidence
inspiring evidence and by analyzing the material
available on record no opinion could be formed

other than that the deceased had died due to the head

Tajamul/Ps*.

oe: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Tajamulypsé|

-ll-

injuries he had sustained at the stone blows of the
said appellant. However, keeping in view the
peculiar circumstances of the present case we do not
find ourselves in agreement with the findings of
learned trial Court that he had committed gatl-i-amd
of deceased punishable under section 302(b) PPC.
The admitted fact on record is that the appellants had
come to the house of deceased unarmed just for the
purpose to take the complainant back to their house
despite disagreement of the deceased, hence, he
entered into altercation with them which turned into
a sudden fight. The above mode and manner of the
occurrence suggests that neither the appellants had
come there with any pre-planning nor they had the
intention to kill the deceased. All that had happened
had occurred at spur of the moment wherein stone
was used by appellant Ghaffar Khan and unfortunately
the blows thereof took the life of deceased. If he had
the intention to kill the deceased he would have come
there duly armed with any kind of weapon i.e pistol,
knife etc. In addition, the parties belong to same caste
and they have female relations with each other
besides there is nothing on record to suggest previous

enmity or hatred between them. In _— such

DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice tshtiag Ibrahim
Hon‘ble Mr, Justies Wiser Ahmad
Talamuyps* |

-12-

circumstances, conviction of the said appellant under
section 302(b) PPC by trial Court was not a correct
conclusion rather the act of the said appellant falls
within the definition of Qatl shibh-i-amd which is an
offence under section 315 PPC punishable under
section 316 PPC. | It would be appropriate to

reproduce section 315 PPC for convenience.

315. Qatl shibh-i-amd. Whoever, with intent to
cause harm to the body or mind of any person
causes the death of that or any other person by
means of weapon or an act which in the ordinary
course of nature is not likely to cause death is
said to commit gad! shibh-i-amd.

Illustration

A in order to cause hurt strikes Z with a stick
or stone which in the ordinary course of nature is not
likely to cause death. Z dies as a result of such hurt. Z
dies as a result of such hurt. A shall be guilty of gat!
Shibh-i-amd.

In the present case, undoubtedly
appellant Ghaffar Khan has hit the deceased with
stone and such blows do not cause death in ordinary
course of nature. According to record, the
occurrence took place in house of deceased where,
as per evidence, his sons and daughters were
present, as such, he was in dominant position over
the appellants. His refusal to let his daughter go with
them also shows his stubborn attitude which led to
the unfortunate incindent. It appears that something

had happened between the parties prior to the

oe: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag [brahim
Hon‘ble Mc Justices Wigar Ahmad
Tajamul/Ps* |

-13-

occurrence which has not been brought on record. In
view of the above mentioned circumstances and in
absence of any evidence to suggest pre-planning or
intention on the part of appellant Ghaffar Khan to
commit murder of the deceased, the safe and just
conclusion in our view is that the said appellant is
liable under section 316 PPC instead of section

302(b) PPC.

10. As regards the case of co-appellant
Sahib Zar, complainant has charged him for holding
the deceased in order to facilitate his co-appellant in
committing the alleged murder. According to card of
arrest, this appellant is an aged person of 50/51 years
with normal physique whereas deceased was his son-
in-law who was a strong person. In response to a
suggestion by defence counsel, complainant stated

that:

BP WI hee sE ch Lio bell tS iny

In the mentioned situation, the version
of prosecution does not stand to reason that appellant
Sahib Zar had overpowered the deceased more
particularly in presence of his sons and daughters

who obviously could not be expected to remain silent

08: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mc Justice Winar Ahmed
-14-

spectators in such a critical situation. Moreso, there is
no evidence on record of reliable nature to prove the
said allegation against appellant Sahib Zar rather it
appears that complainant has falsely charged him by
throwing a wider net. Likewise, we have already
discussed in detail that the occurrence had taken
place at spur of the moment without any pre-planning
on the part of appellants, therefore, the allegation of
prosecution that both the appellants had acted in
prosecution of their common intention, is baseless.
Thus, involvement of appellant Sahib Zar in the
occurrence is doubtful in the circumstances and he is

entitled to get the benefit of that doubt.

il. Though the report was lodged with
delay of 4 % hours but as per contents of FIR, the
distance between the place of occurrence and police
station is about 18/20 kilometres. It is also a matter
of evidence that the place of occurrence isa hilly
area where the family of deceased resides seasonally
for the purpose of grazing herds. According to
statements of PWs especially the eye witnesses,
walking distance between Nao Banda (place of
occurrence) and Bashigram is of 1 % hours and no

facility of road is available between the said villages

Teamuyes+|

oa: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishttag [brahim
Hon’ble Me Justice Wigar Ahmad
TolamuyPs*

-15-

whereas the distance from Bashigram to Madyan
can be covered in two hours through a vehicle. Thus,
the total: distance between the spot and police station
can be covered in 3 % hours and the delay, being

well explained, is not fatal to the prosecution case.

12, In light of the above discussion, this
appeal is partially allowed, the impugned judgment
is set aside to the extent of appellant Sahib Zar and
he is acquitted of the charge. The impugned
judgment to the extent of appellant Ghaffar Khan is
modified by converting his conviction from section
302(b) PPC to section 316 PPC. The sentence of life
imprisonment awarded to him by trial Court is
reduced to fourteen (14) years with benefit of
section 382-B, CrP.C. He shall also pay Diyat to
LRs of ithe deceased according to valuation notified
by Federal Government for financial year 2018-2019
as the occurrence had taken place in relevant period
and he was also arrested there and then. He shall
also pay Rs.100,000/- to LRs of the deceased as
compensation under section 544-A, Cr.P.C and in
case of default thereof he shall undergo simple
imprisonment for six months in addition to the

substantial sentence of 14 years. The connected Cr.R
