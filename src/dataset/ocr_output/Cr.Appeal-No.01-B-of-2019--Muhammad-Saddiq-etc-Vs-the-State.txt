SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH , J.- Through this

3. The State through Asst. Advocate General

KPK Peshawar has also filed a criminal revision No. 23-B
of 2019 against the convict / appellants Muhammad
Saddiq and Faridullah, for enhancement of their
conviction.

4. Concisely the facts as enumerated in the

First information Report Ex:PW-A/1, are that on
21.10.2017 complainant Noor Seen Gul brought his son
Muhammad Irshad in injured condition to the casualty
KDA, Hospital Karak and at 08.20 hours, made a report to
the effect that on the eventful day, he along with his son
Muhammad Irshad was going on foot from Karak Bazar
to District Courts for hearing of a case, that when at 7.40
a.m they reached at Karak Bannu road near Tappi
graveyard Karak, appellants/ accused Farid Khan and
Muhammad Saddiq, sons of Ameer Gul riding a motor
cycle being driven by Farid Khan came from behind; that
on the command of accused/appellant Farid Khan,

appellant/accused Muhammad Saddiq started firing with
his pistol at them with intent to commit their gatl-i-amdl,

resultantly his son Muhammad Irshad got injured while

complainant luckily escaped unhurt. Motive as disclosed

in the FIR is blood feud enmity. Hence FIR (ibid).

5. After completion of investigation,

complete challan was submitted before the trial court

against both the appellants/accused named above and

the trial commenced.

6. In order to prove its case, prosecution

examined as many as (11) witnesses. After closure of

the prosecution evidence, statements of appellants/

accused Muhammad Saddiq and Faridullah were

recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein they

professed their innocence. They neither wished to be

examined on oath, as required under section 340

(2)Cr.P.C. nor opted to produce defence evidence. After

hearing the prosecutor and defence, learned trial court

convicted and sentenced appellants/ accused, as

mentioned earlier, hence the instant appeal.
7. We have considered the submissions of

learned counsel for the parties; AAG for the state and

with their valuable assistance, the record was read from

cover to cover.

8. The complainant with his son while on

their way to Sessions Courts Karak were fired upon,

which resulted into injuries on the person of

Muhammad Irshad, his son who was rushed to KDA

hospital Karak, where the report was made. The motive

was stated to be blood feud as father of the appellants

was murdered and the injured Muhammad Irshad and

his uncle Widan Gul were charged, on the day, on the

day, injured Muhammad Irshad was facing trial before

the court of Additional Sessions Judge at district Karak

and the appellants were prosecuting.

9. The complainant was examined as PW-9,

who stated that after deboarding from the passenger

vehicle, they were on foot and when reached to the spot

from behind, the appellants came on motorcycle where

accused Fareedullah, the younger brother commanded
Muhammad Sadeeq, his elder brother to kill. The

learned Defence counsel at the very outset challenged

the presence of the complainant on the spot at the

relevant time. This is on record that father of the

appellant was killed by the injured Muhammad Irshad

and that the accused had come to take revenge then both

the complainant and the injured were at their mercy

why father was not fired at to do away with, for two

reasons to eradicate evidence against them and to

quench their thirst.

10. The spot is situated near District Court

Karak, the Civil Hospital Karak is one kilo meter from

the place of occurrence with police station Karak just

behind the police is present round the clock in front of

Courts but no one attracted to the spot despite the fact

complainant said that injured was lying on the ground

for 9/10 minutes. The conduct of the complainant

attracts our attention as he acted and behaved in a way

which a father would not have if in fact was present on

the spot, blood was oozing, the injured was in pain and

semi conscious but the complainant was not in a hurry
to rush him to the hospital for treatment, he selected to

sit in a passenger pick up, deboarded in Karak Bazar,

then hired a taxi and reached to K.D.A Hospital Karak,

had the complainant present he would have chosen the

quickest means of transportation instead of travelling to

the hospital in intervals. His presence is again doubtful

as admittedly the police station Karak was just at the

back of the spot and so was the Civil Hospital Karak,

what precluded him to take the injured there for quick

treatment and why not to police station Karak despite

the fact that to reach K.D.A Hospital Karak from spot,

one has to pass both Civil Hospital Karak and Police

station, so it suggests nothing but that the complainant

was not present on the spot and that the injured was

taken to the hospital by the passersby.

11. The witnesses are inconsistent on the

point of arrival of police to the spot. The complainant

stated that the police did not reach to the spot and that it

was he alone who took the injured to the hospital.

Naseem Khan a police official, was examined as PW-8

who in his court statement went opposite and stated that
he with SHO came to the spot where the injured was

present, who was picked up and escorted to K.D.A

Karak, he stated that no one from the police reached to

the spot prior to their arrival, he further stated that the

SHO met injured on the spot. The witnesses remained

inconsistent regarding the manner in which the report

was made to the police at KDA hospital Karak. The

complainant when cross-examined on this particular

aspect of the case, he came forward with a strange reply

that at the time, when he reached to the hospital, none

from the police was present and it was after some time

that the police officials from the Police station Karak

reached. This explanation of the complainant leads us

nowhere but to hold that in fact the complainant was not

present at the time of occurrence and lateron he was

procured to lodge a report. The coming of the

complainant to the spot from the hospital for spot

pointation, is another factor which tells otherwise

regarding the conduct and veracity of this witness, as he

stated that he went with a constable from hospital to the

police station and the investigating officer was present
in the P.S and he in his company came to the spot,

whereas the Investigating officer, who has been

examined as PW-11 stated that while present at the spot

he contacted the complainant on his cell phone and so

his attendance was secured from the hospital. Another

aspect which brings the testimony of these witnesses at

stake is the conscious attempt on part of the SHO,

investigating officer and one Raufullah constable to

bring themselves in harmony but unfortunately they

could not and every one came forward with a different

and totally contradicting stance.

12- The manner in which the accused/

appellants were arrested, is surprising, as the

incident happened at 7.40 a.m and the FIR U/Ss 324/34

PPC was registered at 9.10 a.m in KDA hospital Karak

but the appellants were arrested at 9.35 a.m when the

SHO had laid a barricade at Jama Chowk. The very

stance of the SHO does not appeal to a prudent mind as

the main incident took place at 7.40 a.m and the

accused/appellants were shown riding a motor cycle

then why from 7.40 to 9.45 a.m, the accused remained
-10-

near and around the spot knowing the fact that the

police of the area were in hot pursuit. Another thing

which disturbs the mind of this Court that when the

accused/appellants were arrested and FIR No.549 U/S

15 AA was registered then how the SHO came to know

that FIR 548 U/Ss 324/34 PPC has already been

registered at Police Station Karak when yet he had

neither the knowledge of the incident nor he was in

possession of the FIR, so that he could pen down the

particulars and details of the injuries caused and the

case registered. In the circumstance, we can gather

nothing but to hold that the accused was arrested as the

accused/appellants were in the sessions Court, district

Karak, admittedly pursuing the murder trial of their

father where injured Muhammad Irshad and his uncle

Widan Gul were charged. The appellants were specific

that owing to their enmity with the respondents they

had come to the Courts and the pistol allegedly

recovered belonged to and in the name of their father,

was placed in safe custody of the Manager of the nearby

hotel. This factor is further substantiated that the SHO
-ll-

when recovered the pistol did not mention in the

recovery memo that the pistol was giving a smell of

fresh discharge. We are further surprised that when the

weapon was recovered along with ammunitions and

allegedly it was handed over to the Muharrir of the PS

Karak at 12.00 hours for safe custody, then how the

seals were affixed bearing monogram of GM, as the

Investigating officer when examined he laid open that

after recovery of the empties from the spot, those were

sealed into parcel and monogram in the name of GM,

was affixed. Now when the SHO had not met the

Investigating officer on the spot, then how the

monogram GM came into his possession at the time of

the arrest and recovery of the 9 MM pistol from

possession of the accused. All these suggest that in fact

the accused were arrested, as he stated and the pistol

was taken from the hotel where it was placed and it was

in the Police station when the Investigating officer came

back, the pistol and the cartridges were sealed into the

parcel. So the prosecution miserably failed to prove the

presence of the appellants on the spot and _ the
-12-

commission of offence and we can say that the

witnesses are interested and chance witnesses as is held

by the apex court.

In case titled Muhammad Asghar Vs

State (SCMR 2010 1706) wherein it is held:-

"18. After scrutinizing the evidence
available on record we are of the considered
view that the ocular evidence is insufficient to
convict the appellants. We also find that the
investigation has not been conducted honestly,
false improvements have been made in order to
involve the accused and with the particular
object the evidence was manipulated so as to
strengthen the prosecution case. Therefore, we
are not convinced with the evidence of recovery
of weapons from the possession of the

appellants."

It was also held in a case titled Noor

Muhammad Vs the State (2010 SCMR 97):-

"....even otherwise the recovery of
crime empty or riffle with matching report of
F.S.L. is a corroborated piece of evidence,
which by itself is not sufficient to convict the

accused in absence of substantive evidence."
-13-

13- The medical evidence when taken into

consideration with the ocular account and the places

given to the parties in the site plan so the seat of injuries

on person of the deceased run in counter and in fact the

ocular account is in conflict with the medical evidence.

One aspect of the case still disturbs the judicial mind of

this court that why the Investigating officer did not

record the 161 statement of the injured Muhammad

Irshad and that why the site plan was not confirmed

from the said witness despite the fact that the injured

got discharged from the hospital after three days of the

occurrence. The injured went in such a_ high

exaggeration that he stated that his statement could not

be recorded as he remained unconscious for long time

and that he is not specific as to whether said

consciousness remained for days or months.

In case titled Rahat Ali Vs the State

(2010 SCMR_584) it was held:-

""....Jt has also been observed by
this court that delay in recording the statements

without furnishing any plausible explanation is
-14-

also fatal to the prosecution case and the
statement of such witness was not relied upon
in case of Syed Muhammad Shah Vs. State
(1993 SCMR 550). Therefore, the evidence of
PW-2 is coming within the scope of above rules
laid-down by this Court. Hence, his statement
cannot be safely relied upon in the particular

facts and circumstances of the present case"

14- The Investigating officer when allegedly

recovered the two empties of 30 bore of 9 MM from the

spot, he in the recovery memo clearly mentioned that

the empties so recovered were deshaped, as heavy

traffic ply on the road. Not only this but it also aids to

our anxiety as to how for sufficient long time the

empties were not disturbed despite the fact that no

police officials were deputed to preserve the spot, in

this eventuality, the FSL report loses its sanctity as to

how the deshaped empties were put to comparison.

15- The motive alleged by the prosecution

remained far from proving as the presence of the

complainant and the injured on the spot is not

established, had this been so then the prime target of the

accused/appellants would have been the father and the
-15-

son, as no reasonable person would allow a witness

against him. The complainant admitted in his court

statement that the appellants have a house closed to his

house in the village and also another house in village

Samandri, had this been the situation, then instead of

running the risk to accomplish their plan in the vicinity

which is heavily surrounded by the law enforcing

agencies, it was easy to achieve the goal at the village

or on the way.

In case titled Muhammad Ashraf Alias

Acchu Vs The State (2019 SCMR 652) wherein it is

held:-

"The motive is always a double-edged
weapon. The complainant Sultan Ahmad (PW-
9) has admitted murder enmity between the
parties and has also given details of the same in
his statement recorded before the trial court. No
doubt, previous enmity can be a reason for the
appellant to commit the alleged crime but it can
equally be a reason for the complainant side to
falsely implicate the appellant in this case for

previous grouse."
-16-

16- After thoroughly evaluating the evidence

available on file, this Court reaches to the conclusion

that the prosecution has miserly failed to prove its case

against the appellants. Resultantly, this appeal is,

therefore, allowed. The conviction and sentence of the

appellants recorded by the learned trial court is set aside

and they are acquitted of the charge by extending them

the benefit of doubt. They shall be released forthwith

from Jail, if not required to be detained in connection

with any other case.

17- The connected Cr. Revision No. 23-B of

2018, filed by the State, against the appellants is

dismissed.

18- These are the detailed reasons of my short

order of even date.

Announced.
