WIQAR AHMAD. J. Through instant criminal
appeal filed under Section 417(2)A  Cr.PC,
appellant/complainant Faqir-ur-Rehman has
challenged impugned judgment dated 21.02.2012,
passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge-I,
Swabi, whereby accused/respondent namely Hussain
Ahmad, was acquitted from the charges levelled
against him in case FIR No.616 dated 06.09.2011
registered under Sections 302/201 PPC at Police

Station Zaida, District Swabi.
2. As per prosecution case, appellant/
complainant Faqir ur Rehman brought dead body of his
daughter namely Mst. Mahjabeen to Police Station
Zaida on 31.08.2011 and made report that his daughter
had been married to Hussain Ahmad
(accused/respondent), who on 27.08.2011 had lodged
report regarding burning of Mst.Mehjabeen due to gas
cylinder and she had been taken by Hussain Ahmad to
POF Burn Center Wah Cantt: for treatment. After death
of his daughter, complainant satisfied himself that his
daughter had been burnt by accused Hussain Ahmad and
charged him in his report for commission of offence.

3. After completion of investigation, complete
challan against accused/respondent was submitted
before learned trial Court where after framing of formal
charge against accused/respondent, the prosecution in
order to prove its case produced as many as 12
witnesses. On close of prosecution evidence, statement
of accused/respondent was recorded under Section 342
Cr.PC, wherein he denied allegations levelled against
him however, he did not opt to be examined on oath or
to produce defence evidence. After hearing arguments of

learned counsel for the parties, learned trial Court

Cr.A No.158-P/2012.
acquitted the accused/respondent from charges levelled
against him vide impugned judgment dated 21.02.2012.
Aggrieved from impugned judgment,
complainant/appellant filed instant appeal before this
Court for convicting and sentencing the accused
according to law.

4, Learned counsel for the
appellant/complainant argued that deceased had been
killed inside the house of accused/respondent and that in
report lodged by him, he had stated that deceased had
died after catching fire from gas cylinder but as per
report Ex.PW.1/1 of Dr. Zafar Iqbal (PW.1), traces of
kerosene oil had been found on the body of deceased
therefore, learned trial Court should have drawn an
inference that the lady had been burnt to death by
sprinkling kerosene oil on her.

5. On the other hand learned counsel for
accused/respondent contended that medical report
Ex.PW.1/1 had been issued on 05.09.2011 after five
days of death of lady i.e, 31.08.2011, which fact had
also been admitted by PW.1 in his cross examination. It
was further contended that said witness has also

admitted that lady had not remained under his treatment

Cr.A No.185-P/2012.
and that he had inspected the dead body after her death.
Learned counsel next contended that it has been
admitted by PW.7 that the lady after receiving burn
injuries had been taken to various hospitals for treatment
by none else but accused/respondent, which showed his
conduct immediately after the occurrence and was also
fortifying factum of his innocence.

6. Learned AAG also supported arguments
advanced by learned counsel for appellant/complainant.
7. Arguments heard and record perused.

8. Perusai of record reveals that deceased was
wife of accused/respondent Hussain Ahmad, who had no
doubt died inside house of accused/respondent but it was
apparent that accused had taken the lady to the hospital
immediately after receiving burn injuries and also
shifted her to more equipped hospital so as to save her
life. In this respect PW.7 (Mst.Naheed Akhtar) who was
sister of deceased had admitted in her cross examination
that after receiving burn injuries by deceased , she was
first shifted to Swabi hospital by accused, then to LRH
and thereafter to POF Wah Cantt:. Record also suggests
that the lady had died at POF hospital, Wah Cantt:

where she had been taken for treatment by her husband

Cr.& No.138-P/2012.
(accused/respondent). Report had also been lodged by
accused/respondent on second day of occurrence vide
Nagal Mad No.11 dated 27.08.2011 to the effect that he
alongwith other family members were present in his
house where Mst. Mahjabeen was making preparation
for ‘Sehri’ when she was burnt due to gas cylinder,
which occurrence had taken place due to her negligence
and thereafter she had been taken to POF Hospital Wah
Cantt: for treatment. He did not charge anybody for the
occurrence. In the circumstances burden lying on him
under Article 122 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984, has
also been discharged by accused/respondent wherein
sufficient explanation is available in evidence in the
shape of lodging report as well as taking lady to
hospital. Besides, there is no direct evidence of
occurrence which could connect accused/respondent
with the commission of offence.

9. Regarding plea of learned counsel for
appellant that lady has died due to sprinkling kerosene
oil, analysis of statements of PW.1 and PW.2 is deemed
necessary. PW.1 Dr. Zafar Iqbal (who was surgeon
deputed at POF Hospital Wah Cantt;) stated in his

examination in chief that as per history and record, the

Cr.4 No.155-7/2012.
deceased had got fire by kerosene oil. He also stated that
on medical examination, her body had been found
extremely burnt (upto 75% of total body area) and
expired in hospital on 31.08.2011. In cross examination
he admitted that the medical report Ex.PW.1/1 had been
issued by him on 05.09.2011. He also admitted that it
had not been mentioned that the lady has ever remained
under treatment of said doctor. He also admitted that
after death of the patient, death report had not been
issued by him. Likewise, PW.2 Dr. Munawar Latif,
Resident Medical Officer Surgeory POF, Hospital Wah
Cantt: has stated in examination in chief that he had
issued death certificate Ex.PW.2/1. In his cross
examination he admitted that death certificate had been
issued on the basis of available history of case and that
he had nowhere mentioned cause of burn to be kerosene
oil. Same record was before the two doctors but the one
issuing death certificate Ex.PW.2/1 had not mentioned
anything about kerosene oil to be cause of burn while
the other doctor ic, PW.1 (Dr. Zafar Iqbal) has
mentioned in his report that Kerosene oil has been cause
of buming of body of deceased. Latter report of Dr.

Zafar Iqbal had also been issued on 05.09.2011 after five

Cr.A No.185-P/2012,
days of death of the lady which had taken place on
31.08.2011. The complainant had also recorded
statement under Section 164 Cr.PC, on 08.09.2011, at
much belated stage. In rest of evidence there is nothing
to the effect which could have supported this factum of
burning of body through kerosene oil. This Court while
giving judgment in case o “Amir Khan Versus The
State and another” reported as 2000 MLD 766
(Peshawar), had ignored a similar report of a lady
doctor when said report had been found to be in
contradiction of well established evidence in said case.
Relevant observation is reproduced hereunder for ready
reference:-

“We are, therefore, of the view that

in this case the prosecution has

successfully proved that the deceased

was burnt with acid and the

statement of PW.9 Dr. Shahida

Naveed though positive on the point

of thermal injury yet creating doubt

with regard to the substance of

burning, cannot be made basis for

discarding the whole confidence

inspiring eye-witness account and

other strong circumstantial evidence

in the case.”
While deciding petition for leave to appeal against

above judgment, Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in

its judgment given in case of “Amir Khan Versus The

Cr No.188-P/2012.
State and another” reported as 2000 SCMR 1885 has
held;

It kas time and again been held
by the superior Court that if a
bald statement of a medical
expert is opposed to the proved
and admitted confidence
inspiring and reliable account of
the eye-witnesses or other A
material and trustworthy
evidence on record, then the
latter are to be preferred against
the former. In this case it is not
understandable how could the
lady doctor determine the nature
of the injuries by certain smell. It
is on record as referred to in the
above para. from the trial Court
judgement that the trend of
cross-examination by the defence
itself was that the deceased
received burnts/hurts with acid.
The eye-witnesses have
consistently stated that the acid
was thrown on the deceased. The
report of the Chemical Examiner
from Forensic Science
Laboratory also shows that the
clothes etc, of the deceased were
burnt with "sulphuric acid". In
view of this confidence inspiring
evidence the -gratuitous remarks
of the medical officer without
any valid basis have no
significance,

In this case also the report Ex.PW.1/1 was not found
well substantiated. Same was also issued by doctor at
belated stage and same sufficiently stood contradicted

by rest of evidence. Learned Court below through

‘Cr.A No. 165-P/2012.
impugned judgment has properly appreciated the
evidence and discussed each and every point minutely.
10. Accused/respondent has already earned the
order of acquittal from the learned trial Court and
reappraisal of evidence by this Court in an appeal
against acquittal requires a more liberal approach. “An
order of acquittal” as held by the Hon’ble Supreme
Court of Pakistan in case of “The State through A.-G.
N.-W.F.P vs Mehmood Khan and others reported as
2007 SCMR 1390, “doubles the initial presumption of
innocence of accused which would be stronger in case of
verdict of acquittal recorded by Court of record.”
Similar observation had also been recorded by the
Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of “Muhammad Shafi
Vs Muhammad Raza and another” reported as 2008
SCMR 329.

11. In light of what has been discussed
above, it is clear that prosecution has not been able to
prove the case against accused/respondent beyond
reasonable doubt. The judgment of acquittal
impugned herein is based on proper appreciation of
evidence and contains solid reasons recorded therein.

The appeal in hand was therefore found to be lacking

‘Gr.& No.188-P/2012.
substance and same is accordingly dismissed in

limine.
