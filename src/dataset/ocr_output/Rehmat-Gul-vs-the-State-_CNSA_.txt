ROOH-UL-AMIN_ KHAN, __J:-This Criminal Appeal
under section 48 of the Control of Narcotic Substances
Act, 1997 (“the Act of 1997”), filed by Rehmat Gul, the
appellant, is directed against the judgment dated
18.07.2019, passed by learned Additional Sessions
Judge-III/Judge Special Court, Kohat, whereby the
appellant has been convicted under section 9 (c ) of the Act
of 1997 and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment and to
pay a fine of Rs.2,00,000/- and in default of payment
thereof to further undergo six months simple
imprisonment, in case FIR No.216 dated 11.05.2018,
registered under section 9 (c ) of the Act of 1997, at Police
Station Usterzai District Kohat. Benefit of section 382-B

Cr.P.C., has been extended to the appellant.
2. The prosecution case as unfolded in the First
Information Report (FIR) Exh.PA is that on receipt of spy
information qua trafficking of huge quantity of narcotics
from Orakzai Agency, Qaismat Khan SHO (PW.1) along
with Constables Muhammad Yasir No.468, Aman Ullah
No.1342 (PW.2), Owais No.454, Wajat Hussain No.1321,
Muhammad Usman No.361, Attiq ur Rehman No.825 and
other police officials, on 11.05.2018 conducted a
Nakabandi at Old Marai Check Post Marai Road and at
0830 hours intercepted a flying Coach bearing Registration
No.C.2068-Kohat coming from Orakzai side. On query, its
driver disclosed his name as Rehmat Gul son of Khayal
Gul r/o Mamu Zai Meshti Bazaar Orakzai (the appellant).
He was deboarded from the flying Coach. On search of the
flying coach, 15 packets chars Gardha, each weighing
1200 grams, total 18000 grams, was recovered from its
secret cavities. The Seizing Officer (PW.1), separated 10
grams from each packet as sample for chemical analysis by
the FSL and sealed the same in parcels No.1 to 15 whereas
the remaining quantity i.e. 17850 grams were sealed in
separate parcel No.16, and thereafter took the same into
possession through recovery memo Exh.PW.1/1 in
presence of Constables Muhammad Yasir No.468 and
Amanullah No.1342 (PW.2), marginal witnesses to the
recovery memo Exh.PW.1/1. The complainant-SHO,

prepared arrest card of the appellant Exh.PW.1/2, drafted
Murasila and sent the same to Police Station through
Constable Wajahat No.321, on the basis of which FIR
Exh.PA was registered against the appellant by Mukhtiar
Ahmad HC (PW.5).

3. Arshad Mehmood SI (PW.3) was entrusted with
the task of investigation, who on receipt of FIR, proceeded
to the spot and prepared site plan Exh.PB on the pointation
of Qismat Khan SHO (PW.1). On his return to Police
Station, the case property was handed over to him by
Mukhtiar Ahmad HC (PW.5), who after examining the
same returned to the said Moharrir, interrogated the
accused, recorded his and statements of the PWs under
section 161 Cr.P.C., produced the appellant along with
case property before Judicial Magistrate along with case
property vide application Exh.PW.3/2 for recording
confessional statement but he refused. The case property in
parcel No.16 weighing 17850 grams was destroyed by the
learned Judicial Magistrate on the same day vide court
order Exh.PW.3/3, the memo of proceedings is
Exh.PW.3/4 and Certificate is Exh.PW.3/5. The I.O. sent
parcels No.1 to 15 containing samples to the FSL for
chemical analysis vide application Exh.PW.3/6 through
Aftab Ahmad LHC No.30 (PW.4), road certificate in this
regard is Exh.PW.3/7 and received the FSL report Exh.PZ
which is in positive. He also placed on file daily diaries

regarding departure of the Seizing Officer and Mad report
with regard to brining of the appellant along with case
property and samples to Police Station as well as extract of
Registrar No.19 Exh.PW.3/8 and on completion of
investigation handed over case file to SHO, who submitted
challan against the appellant.

4. On receipt of challan by the learned trial Court, the
appellant was summoned and formally charge sheeted to
which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order to
prove its case, the prosecution examined as many as six
witnesses. After closure of the prosecution evidence,
statement of the appellant was recorded under section 342
Cr.P.C., wherein he denied the prosecution’s allegation and
professed innocence. He, however, declined to be
examined on oath under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. or to
produce evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial, the
learned trial Court, after hearing both the sides convicted
and sentenced the appellant as mentioned above, hence,
this appeal.

5. We have heard the arguments of learned counsel
for the parties and perused the record with their able
assistance.

6. In support of his version, Qismat Khan SHO, the
complainant-Seizing Officer while appearing as PW.1, in
his examination-in-chief, reiterated the same story with
regard to arrest of the appellant and recovery from secret

cavities of the Flying Coach being driving by the appellant
and the proceedings conducted by him at the spot, as set
forth in the FIR, which has already been mentioned in the
earlier part of the judgment, therefore, in order to avoid
repetition, his examination in chief is not reproduced. In
cross-examination it was brought from his mouth by the
defence itself that appellant along with recovered
contraband, flying coach and samples were sent to the
Police Station through Constables Attique and Usman.

7. Amanullah FC No.1342, marginal witness to
recovery memo Exh.PW.1/1 while appearing as PW.2
deposed that during the days of occurrence he was posted
at Marai Check-post Usterzai. On 11.05.2018 he along
with other police officials was present at Nakabandi with
Qismat Khan SHO (PW.1). At 08.30 hours they intercepted
a Flying Coach bearing Registration No.2068-Kohat. On
query, its driver disclosed his name as Rehmat Gul
(appellant). On search of the flying coach, the SHO (PW.1)
recovered 15 packets of chars Gardha, each weighing 1200
grams, making the total of 18000 grams. The SHO
separated 10 grams from each packet and sealed the same
in parcels No.1 to 15 and the remaining quantity in parcel
No.16 and thereafter took the same into possession in his
presence vide recovery memo Exh.PW.1/1. He deposed
that recovery memo Exh.PW.1/1 is correct and correctly
bears his signature. In cross-examination, it was also

brought from the mouth of PW.2 that the contraband
narcotics, samples, flying coach and the appellant were
shifted to Police Station by Constables Usman and Attiq
from the spot to Police Station.

8. Both the above named PWs have furnished straight
forward and truthful account of the occurrence. Both have
been subjected to lengthy and taxing cross-examination but
nothing favour to defence could be brought from their
months. They remained stuck to their stance and
corroborated each other on all material particulars of the
occurrence such as the day, date, time and place of
occurrence, the mode and manner of arrest of the appellant
and recovery of contraband chars from secret cavities of
the flying Coach which was in the exclusive possession
and control of the appellant at the relevant time being
driven by him. No doubt, the PWs are police officials but
nothing in black & white is available on file to show their
ill will or enmity with the appellant to falsely implicate
him in case. Daily diary No.8 dated 11.05.2018
substantiate the version of the Seizing Officer and marginal
witness to the recovery memo wherein it has been
mentioned that appellant along with case property, samples
i.e. parcel No.1 to 16 and flying coach were brought by
constable Usman and Attiq ur Rehman to police Station
from the spot and handed over to Moharrir of the Police
Station who deposited the case property and samples in

Malkhana. Similarly, daily diary No.44 dated 11.05.2018
placed on file shows departure of Qismat Khan SHO along
with constables Usman, Attiq ur Rehman, Wajahat and
Rafiq.

9. Arshad Mehmood SI who has conducted
investigation in the case while appearing as PW.3 has also
corroborated the version of the Seizing Officer. He
deposed that after registration of the case he proceeded to
the spot and prepared site plan Exh.PB on the pointation of
Seizing Officer (PW.1), recorded statements of the PWs
under section 161 Cr.P.C. on the spot. On return to the
Police Station, case property was handed over to him by
the Mukhtiar Ahmad HC (PW.5), which after examination
was returned to the said Moharrir. On expiry of custody he
produced the appellant along with case property before the
learned Judicial Magistrate vide application Exh.PW.3/2,
where case property weighing 1785 grams sealed in parcel
No.16 was destroyed by the court on the same day vide
order Exh.PW.3/3, the memo of proceedings Exh.PW.3/4
and certificate Exh.PW.3/5. He deposed that before
destruction of the case property, 10 grams chars from each
packet were separated and sealed in parcel No.A to parcel
No.O Exh.PW.3 to 17 and then in one parcel. Further
stated that he sent samples containing in parcels No.1 to 15
to the FSL vide application Exh.PW.3/6, road certificate
Exh.PW.3/7, and FSL report Exh.PZ as well as placed on

file daily diary regarding departure and return of the
Seizing Officer on the fateful day. He also placed file ETO
report regarding registration of the vehicle in question.
The Investigating Officer was also subjected to lengthy and
taxing cross examination by the defence but nothing
favourable could be extracted from his mouth. In cross-
examination it was brought by the defence itself from him
that Constables Attique and Usman had brought the
samples and case property to Police Station and in this
regard daily diaries regarding their departure from Police
station and return are available on file.

10. Aftab Ahmad LHC No.30, who took the samples
to the FSL from Police Station appeared in the witness box
as PW.4 and deposed that on 14.05.2018, the I.O. handed
over him samples in parcels No.1 to 15 along with FSL
application and road certificate Exh.PW.3/7. He took the
samples to the FSL and handed over the same to FSL
authority and received endorsement on road certificate
which he handed over to the I.O. and the I.O. recorded his
statement under section 161 Cr.P.C.

11. Mukhtiar Ahmad HC who during the days of
occurrence was posted as Moharrir in Police Station
Usterzai while appearing as PW.5 deposed that on receipt
of Murasila brought by Constable Wajahat FC he
registered FIR Exh.PA. Further stated that Constables Attiq
ur Rehman and Muhammad Usman brought the appellant

along with contraband narcotics, samples, flying coach and
its registration and handed over to him, which he kept in
malkhana of the Police Station and put the appellant in the
lockup. On arrival of the I.O. to Police Station he showed
parcels No.1 to 15 i.e. samples and parcel No.16, who after
examining the same returned the same to him which he
kept in safe custody of Malkhana. On 14.05.2018, on the
request of the I.O. he handed over parcel No.16 to him who
produced the same before the learned Judicial Magistrate
for the purpose of destruction.

12. The testimony of all PWs referred above including
the Seizing Officer and the Investigating Officer are
consistent with each other on the fact that samples in
parcels No.1 to 15 and contraband narcotics in parcel
No.16 were brought by Constable Muhammad Usman
No.361 and Attiq ur Rehman No.825 to Police Station
from the spot and handed over to Moharrir of the Police
Station. Similarly, daily diaries referred to above, also
substantiate the testimony of Seizing Officer, LO. and
Moharrir of the Police Station. In the Murasila Exh.PA/1
which is the first written document at the spot show
presence of Constable Attiq ur Rehman and Muhammad
Usman with the Seizing Officer at the time of occurrence.
The prosecution has proved the chain of circumstances
under which the samples along with case property was
shifted from the spot to the Police Station, produced before

the I.0., then kept in safe custody and onward transmission
10

to the FSL for chemical analysis. All the PWs have been
subjected to lengthy and taxing cross-examination by the
defence but nothing beneficial to accused was extracted
from them nor any doubt was created in prosecution’s case,
regarding tampering with the samples or that the samples
were not in safe custody. The positive FSL report Exh.PZ
qua samples further strengthens the prosecution case.

13. As regards argument of learned counsel for the
appellant to the effect that the samples remained unsafe
during its transit from Malkhana to the FSL, we would
refer to the statement of Aftab Ahmad LHC No.30 (PW.4),
according to which samples in parcels No.1 to 15, were
handed over to him by the I.O. on 14.05.2018 along with
application and road _ certificate Exh.PW.3/6 and
Exh.PW.3/7, respectively, for its onwards transmission to
the FSL. He handed over the samples to the FSL authority
and obtained endorsement in this regard over road
Certificate Exh.PW.3/7. The application Exh.PW.3/6, road
certificate Exh.PW.3/7, endorsement thereon and FSL
report Exh.PZ, wherein the samples have been shown
received on the same date i.e. 14.05.2018, coupled with
the testimony of the I.O. corroborate the version of AFtab
Ahmad LHC (carrier of the samples). In this view of the
matter, we are firm in our view to hold that the samples
were safely transmitted to the FSL from Malakhana to the

FSL.
11

14. Argument of learned counsel for the appellant that
at the time of destruction of the case property, no notice
was given to the appellant, hence, the appellant has been
prejudiced in his defence, is not tenable because on one
hand, this objection has neither been raised by the defence
at the time of cross-examination of Raja Muhammad
Shoaib Judicial Magistrate (PW.6) who destroyed the case
property or in the cross-examination of Arshad Mehmood
SI (PW.3), who produced the case property before PW.6
for destruction, while on the other hand, notice to accused
at the time of destruction of the case property, particularly,
narcotics is not the requirement of section 33(4) of the
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 read with section
516-A Cr.P.C, which for the sake of convenience and ready
reference are reproduced below:-

“§.33(4) A narcotic drug, psychotropic
substance or controlled substance seized under
this Act shall be disposed of under section 516A
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V
of 1898).,
The 2nd and 3rd provisos attached to section 516A Cr.P.C.

provide a proper mechanism for destruction of dangerous
drug, intoxicant, intoxicating liquor or any other narcotic.
For the sake of convenience and ready reference, the

aforesaid provisos are reproduced below:-

“Provided further that if the property is dangerous
drug, intoxicant, intoxicating liquor or any other

narcotic substances seized or taken into custody
12

under Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930 (II of 1930), the
Customs Act, 1969 (IV of 1969), the Prohibition
(Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979 (P.O. 4 of 1979),

or any other law for the time being in force, the Court

may, either on_an application or of its own motion
and under its supervision and control, obtain and
prepare such number of samples of the property as it
may deem fit for safe custody and production before
it or any other Court and cause destruction of the
remaining portion of the property under a certificate
issued by it in that behalf; (Emphasis supplied).

Provided also that such samples shall_be

deemed to be whole of the property in any inquiry or

proceedings in relation to such offence before any
authority or Court.” (emphasis supplied).
15. The Statutes governing destruction of seized

narcotics do not provide any specific time for such
destruction. The phrase “such samples shall be deemed to
be whole of the property in any inquiry or proceedings in
relation to such offence before any authority or Court?
employed in 3rd proviso to section 561A Cr.P.C.
empowered the Court to pass an order of destruction of
narcotics at any stage which may even be at the time of
production of accused for physical custody before the
Magistrate or any time before the trial. The law on the
subject referred above does not make any notice mandatory
to be given to an accused before or at the time of
destruction of narcotics.

16. For the sake of discussion if we deem that issuance
of notice to the accused was essential, which otherwise is

not the requirement of the law, then the dictionary meaning
13

of word “Notice” is to be taken into account which means
“to see or become conscious of something or someone”. Here
we would refer to the testimony of Raj Muhammad Shoaib
Judicial Magistrate (PW.6), under whose supervisions the
case property was destroyed. He deposed that on
14.05.2018, the I.O. produced accused Rehmat Gul before
me for recording his confessional statement along with
case property. The accused refused to confess his guilt. He
weighed the case property contraband which came to 1785
grams. After separating 10 grams from each packet and
resealing them for the purpose of exhibition before the trial
court, I destroyed the remaining 17700 grams chars, in
presence of APP, accused and I.0. of the case. He handed
over samples to Criminal Moharrir of this court. In this
respect order is Exh.PW.3/3, memo of proceedings
Exh.PW.3/4 and certificate Exh.PW.3/5. Similar is the
statement of Arshad Mehmood SI, the Investigating
Officer, according to which at the time of destruction of the
case property the accused appellant was present in the
entire proceedings. Order dated 14.05.2018 (Exh.PW.3/3)
of the learned Judicial Magistrate, memo of proceedings
Exh.PW.3/4 and certificate Exh.PW.3/5, substantiate the
version of the Magistrate and the I.O. that at the time of
destruction of the case property the appellant was very
much present. In this view of the matter, presence of the

appellant at the time of destruction of the case property was
14

sufficient notice to him. The appellant has not raised any
objection at the time of destruction of the case property.
Similarly, as stated earlier he has also not put any
suggestion to the PWs to call in question the proceedings
regarding destruction of the case property. In case titled
“Naseer _Ahmaed ys the State” (2004 SCMR 1361), the
Honourable Supreme Court has held that:-

“So far as the non-production of the narcotics
before the trial Court is concerned, the
Investigating Officer during the trial submitted an
application under section 516 Cr.P.C. for
destruction of narcotics substance, which was
allowed by the Magistrate on 04.12.1995 and the
Destruction Certificate was issued by the
Magistrate on 05.12.1995. We are mindful of the
fact that during the trial, the petitioner did not
raise objection for the destruction of the narcotics

under the valid orders of the court”.

In case titled, “Fida Muhammad vs the State “ (2006 P
Cr _L J (Peshawar) 316) this court with regard to
destruction of case property has observed as under:-
“This court in Wajid Ali Shah Vs State 2002
MLD 1982 , where even the destruction
certificate of chars and opium was not produced
in Court, had held that non-production of
destruction certificate at the trial had not
prejudiced the case of the accused in any

manner which at the most could be considered
15

as an irregularity curable under section 537

Cr.P.C. and would not affect the factum of

recovery from the possession of the appellant

and its prove at the trial. The Judicial

Magistrate was nominated by the Special Judge

to take the sample and supervise the destruction

of seized chars vide Exh.PL and he in

compliance of the order had acted accordingly.

In Naseer Ahmad vs the State 2004 SCMR

1361, where the Investigating Officer during the

trial had submitted application under section

516 Cr.P.C. for destruction of a narcotics

substance which was allowed by the Magistrate,

the destruction certificate was also issued by the

Magistrate and the Hon’ble supreme court had

observed that the petitioner did not raise

objection for the destruction of narcotics under

the valid order of the court.”
In case in hand, the learned Judicial Magistrate, Kohat on
the direction of the learned Sessions Judge, after adopting
the mechanism provided under 2nd and 3rd provisos to
section 516A Cr.P.C. has ordered the destruction of
narcotics and in this regard has also issued a proper
certificate under his signature and seal of the Court. The
entire proceedings of the destruction of narcotics were
carried out/conducted in presence of the appellant, and the

same has been vividly proved by the prosecution through
16

cogent and confidence inspiring oral as well as
documentary evidence.

17. Besides section 33(4) CNS Act 1997 read with
proviso 2" and 3™ to 516-A Cr.P.C, we would also refer to
section 27 of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997,
so as to know the aim and object behind the scheme of
quick production of the recovered narcotics before the
Special Court at the time of production of an accused for
physical remand and expeditious disposal of the case
property, which for the sake of convenience and ready

reference is reproduced below:-

“<i

8.27. Disposal_of persons _arrested_and_articles

seized:--(1) Every person arrested and articles seized
under a warrant issued under section 20 shall be
forwarded without delay to the authority by whom the
warrant was issued; and every person arrested and
article seized under section 20 or section 21 shall be
forwarded without delay to:-

(a) The officer-in-charge of the nearest police

station; and

(b) The Special Court having jurisdiction.

(2) The authority or officer to whom any person or
article is forwarded under this section shall, with all
convenient dispatch, take such measures as may be
necessary under the law for the disposal of such person

or article.”
18. From combined study of sections 27 & 33(4) of

the CNS Act, 1997 read with section 516-A Cr.P.C., one
17

may infer the object and wisdom of the legislature that
proceedings in cases of narcotics should expedite, fair and
transparent that no innocent person be entangled in a false
case and that the narcotics recovered in one case may not
be planted against another innocent person. In this view of
the matter, we are firm in our view to hold that the
expeditious disposal/destruction of the recovered narcotics
in presence of the appellant by the court of competent
jurisdiction, has not prejudiced the appellant in his
defence.

19. On reappraisal of the evidence, we have reached to
an irresistible conclusion that prosecution has proved the
guilt of the appellant through cogent and confidence
inspiring ocular as well as documentary evidence,
corroborated by circumstantial evidence. The appellant
failed discharge his burden by proving to the contrary in
terms of section 29 of Control of Narcotic Substances Act,
1997. In cases registered under Control of Narcotic
Substances Act 1997, once the prosecution, prima facie
establishes its case against an accused, then under section
29 of Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, burden
shifts upon the accused to prove contrary to the plea of the
prosecution. The impugned judgment of the learned trial
Court is well reasoned, based on proper appreciation of
evidence and application of the law on the subject, hence

not open to any interference by this Court.
18

20. Resultantly, this appeal being meritless is hereby
dismissed. Conviction and sentence of the appellant
recorded by the learned trial Court are maintained.
