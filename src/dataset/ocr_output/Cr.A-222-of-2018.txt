filed by complainant for enhancement of the sentence
awarded to appellant namely Akbar Khan to that of

death penalty. .

3. Local police of Police Station Khurshid
Khan Shaheed, District Swat received information that
a double murder had taken place at Mohallah Manpetai
of village Awar, District Swat. They went to the spot,
where they found two dead bodies of a male and
female deceased laying lathered in blood in a room.
Appellant namely Akbar Khan was present there, and
lodged the report by stating that he had come home
after his daily labour work at evening time the day
before the occurrence. He slept in his room. He heard
some sound at about 21:30 hours and his suspicion
drew him out of the room. On coming out, he found
that the sound had been coming from his mother’s
room. His father had gone out of the house at evening
time, whereafter he had not returned and the voice
hitting his ears, had also been stranger, the appellant
therefore peeped into the room of his mother over the
door. He saw that another person namely Sherin son of
Muhammad Gul was present there, about whom he had
been hearing rumors that he had illicit relations with

his mother. He locked the door from outside, went to

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-4.

the nearby house of his. uncle namely Hakim Khan,
brought a 12 bore shotgun there-from and fired at both,
his mother as well as the other person namely Sherin
with the intention to kill them. They died as a result of
the firing. The cause of occurrence was stated to be
existence of the illicit relations between the two

deceased during their lifetime.

4. Investigation in the case ensued, during
which autopsy reports of the two deceased were
obtained. Beside, other proceedings in investigation,
weapon of offence was also shown recovered vide
recovery memo Ex PW 2/3, from the appellant. Three
empties had also been recovered from the spot, FSL
report regarding comparison of the empties of the
shotgun was also received and placed on record as Ex
PW 11/21. On completion of investigation in the case,
complete challan was put in Court. The prosecution
examined fifteen (15) number of witnesses and closed
their evidence, whereafter statement of the accused
were recorded under section 342 Cr. PC. On
conclusion of proceedings in the trial, the accused/
appellant Akbar Khan was convicted and sentenced as
reproduced above, while co-accused namely Hakim

Khan, Yar Muhammad and Muhammad Khan were

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
“ Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-5-
acquitted of the charges vide impugned judgment dated

15.09.2018.

5. Learned counsel for the accused/appellant
submitted during the course of his arguments that
prosecution have neither been having direct evidence
against the appellant, nor have they been able to
connect the appellant with commission of the offence
on the basis of circumstantial evidence. He stated that
F.LR registered on report of the appellant cannot be
given more worth than statement of an accused
recorded under section 161 Cr. PC and that beside
F.LR, the only evidence that remained against the
present accused/appellant is recovery of weapon of
offence from his home. Learned counsel stated that
PW-2 who was one of the marginal witness of
recovery memo Ex PW 2/3 has not supported such
recovery while the other witness namely Dosham Gul
had not been examined. Recovery of the shotgun on
pointation of the appellant did not stand proved in the
circumstances of the case, according to the learned
counsel. He relied upon judgments reported as PLD
1956 Supreme Court (Pak.) 420, PLD 1965 Supreme
Court 366, 2017 SCMR 2036, 2018 YLR 1900 and

2018 P Cr. L J 1633, in support of his contentions.

6. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of
complainant submitted in rebuttal that prosecution has
been able to prove their case against the appellant
through circumstantial evidence. He added that dead
bodies of both the deceased had been recovered from
the house of appellant and report of the occurrence has
been lodged by the appellant himself, wherein he has
owned his liability for commission of the offence.
Learned counsel also added that recovery of weapon of
offence has furnished the last ring in the chain of
circumstantial evidence and had therefore connected
the appellant with ‘commission of the offence,
whereafter he has rightly been convicted by the learned
trial Court for commission of the offence. Learned
counsel also made his submissions in the connected
appeal against acquittal of co-accused namely Hakim
Khan, Yar Muhammad Khan, Muhammad Khan and
stated that prosecution have also successfully proved
case against respondents/accused in Cr.A No. 230-M
of 2018, therefore their order of acquittal also deserved
reversal. He relied upon judgment reported as 2008
SCMR 222 as well as judgment of this Court passed in

the case of Haider Ali vs, The State (Cr.A No. 184-
M/2017), in support of his contentions.

7. Learned Addl:A.G adopted arguments of

learned counsel for the complainant.

8, We have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the parties, learned Asst:A.G appearing on

behalf of the State and perused the record.

9. Perusal of record reveals that there has
been no direct evidence of the occurrence. Not only the
prosecution have been relying upon contents of report
of the occurrence lodged by the present appellant, but
the learned trial Court has also made substantial
reliance thereupon while convicting the appellant. We
would therefore first discuss evidentiary value of
lodging of such a report of occurrence by the appellant.
The appellant was shown arrested on the night of
occurrence i.e. on 28.01.2016, and on the following
day i.e. 29.01.2016, he was produced by the local
police before Magistrate with a request for recording
his confessional statement. The accused refused to
confess his guilty before the Magisterial Court and
was thereafter remanded to judicial custody. While
recording his statement under section 342 Cr. PC, he

has been confronting with the factum of lodging of

Abdu! Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-8-
report of occurrence by him in question No. 9, to

which he has given the following answer;

AM KLM artang- St p25 fet FQ"

"ey lt res?
10. The fact that the accused had not recorded
judicial confession before competent forum i.e. Ilaga
Magistrate, makes lodging of the report by the
appellant, doubtful. He has subsequently denied
commission of the offence in his statement recorded
under section 342 Cr. PC on 11.04.2018. Had he
voluntarily recorded his report of the occurrence with
the assertions as contained in Murasila, he would have
also confessed his guilt before Magistrate, when he
was produced there, on the following day of his arrest.
When he has not made such a confession, a lurking
question exists about the veracity of lodging of report
by him and owning responsibility for commission of

the offence.

il. Lodging of such report even otherwise
may not be construed, more than an extra judicial
confession before the police who got attracted to the
spot as first responders. Such a confession before

Police Officer is not admissible in evidence, according

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-9.
to Article 38 of Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984.
Hon’ble Supreme Court of India while dealing with a
somewhat similar situation, had held that first
information report of the occurrence was not a
substantive piece of evidence and could not be used to
corroborate the statement of maker under section 157
of the Evidence Act. Relevant part of observations of

the august Court in the case of Nasar Ali vs. The State

of Uttar Pradesh reported as AIR 1957 S.C 366, are

reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

“A First Information Report is not a
substantive piece of evidence and can only
be used to corroborate the statement of
the maker under s. 157 of the Evidence
Act or to contradict it under s. 145 of that
Act. It cannot be used as evidence against
the maker at the trial if he himself
becomes an accused, nor to corroborate
or contradict other witnesses. In this case,
therefore, it is not evidence.”

We also find a similar treatment of the
matter in judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court of
Pakistan in the case of Muhammad Saleh vs. The

State reported as PLD 1965 Supreme Court 366,

wherein the august Court had observed;

“Muhammad Saleh himself went to the
Police Station to report the matter. What
he said was recorded at 11:30 am, on the
26" February. That statement was
inadmissible evidence on account of its
inculpatory nature.”

Abdul Sabooh/* (@.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-10-

This Court in its earlier judgment given in

the case of Muhammadullah and another vs. The

State through Additional Advocate General and
another reported as 2018 P Cr. L J 1633, has also

held;

“First Information Report _ basically
covers the information regarding a
cognizable offence given to officer
incharge of a police station the purpose of
which is to set the law in motion for
conducting investigation in the case. It is
not a substantive piece of evidence unless
the maker himself deposes in Court to
confirm the contents of the FIR entered
therein at his behest. Keeping in view the
above status of the FIR, this document by
itself cannot advance the prosecution case
except it is recorded by a person who is
near to die which is commonly known as
dying declaration but that is also
admissible in evidence under certain
principles laid down by superior Courts.”

It was also held further ahead, in said

judgment;

“To sum up, the learned trial Court has
illegally taken into account the F.LR
against appellant Muhammadullah who
allegedly made the report. Next is the
question that whether it can be used
against the co-appellant Hanifullah or
not. Admittedly, he is not nominated in
the F.LR by co-accused Muhammadullah
and was charged by relatives of both the
deceased in their 164, Cr. PC statements
recorded at a belated stage, therefore,
there arise no question of taking into
account the F.I.R against the co-appellant
Hanifullah.”

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
os

“11+
We are not inclined to take a different
view owing to the fact that preponderance of opinion
of judicial fora existed, regarding the fact that an F.LR
lodged by an accused cannot be considered as evidence
by itself, unless its maker cloth it with such a status by
recording his confession according to Jaw, or owns it

during trial of the case.

12, Oral statement of brother of the accused
recorded as PW-4, is of no worth for the prosecution as
he had resiled from his earlier statement recorded
under section 161 Cr. PC and he was though declared
hostile but nothing beneficial to the prosecution could
be extracted from his mouth, So far as statement of
father of the appellant recorded as PW-14 is
concerned, he is not an eye-witness of the occurrence
and his statement is based on hearsay, which is not
admissible in evidence. Same was the case with father
of the deceased lady recorded as PW-13. He has given
a new twist to the story by stating that accused Hakim
Khan, Yar Muhammad Khan and Muhammad Khan
had also been present with the appellant at the time of
commission of the offence. A somewhat similar
narration had also been recorded by wife of the

deceased namely Mst. Muhammadia recorded as PW-8

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-12-
but all the statements are based on hearsay and cannot
therefore be relied upon safely in absence of direct

evidence.

13. Other pieces of evidence available against
appellant were recovery of shotgun, recovered vide
recovery memo Ex PW 2/3, the empties recovered vide
recovery memo Ex PW 2/4 and its matching F.S.L
report Ex PW 11/21. One of the marginal witness of
recovery memo Ex PW 2/3 namely Bailadar Khan was
examined as PW-2. He has given a supporting
narration in his examination-in-chief but in his cross-
examination, he has stated that it was correct that his
thumb impression had been taken by the local police
on a blank paper. He has also stated that his statement
had never been recorded under section 161 Cr. PC.
This witness has resiled from his statement given in
his examination-in-chief, while the other witness
namely Dosham Khan has been abandoned. In such
circumstances, recovery of weapon of offence cannot
be taken to have been proved merely on the basis of
statement of Investigating Officer. A substantial doubt
has thus been created in respect of recovery of weapon

of offence on pointation of the accused/appellant.

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-13-_
14, So far as factum of recovery of dead
bodies from the house of appellant is concerned, it is
important that the house had not been in exclusive
possession of the appellant. As per prosecution
evidence, his father and other brother namely
Najeebullah have also been living in said house and his
uncle namely Hakim Khan has also been living nearby.
The house was not having a boundary wall around it,
according to site plan. Ex PW 11/1. In such
circumstances, criminal liability cannot be fixed on the
appellant, just for the reason that he had been living in

the house.

15, So far as judgments relied upon by
learned counsel appearing on behalf of complainant
had been rendered on the basis of totally different set
of facts, ratio of which cannot be applied to facts of
present case. It has already been explained in the
reasons recorded before that prosecution have failed in
proving case against the accused/appellant, while in the
case of Zakir Hussain vs. The State reported as 2008
SCMR 222 and relied upon by learned counsel for
complainant, there had been an eye-witness account
offered by a number of eye-witnesses, which had been

found by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan to be

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
-14.
believable. There has not been a single eye-witness
account offered in the case in hand, therefore ratio of
said judgment cannot be applied to the present case. So
far as unreported judgment of this Court rendered in
Cr.A No. 184-M/2017 is concerned, this Court had
found the chain of all links of circumstantial evidence
intact, with no link missing therein and had believed all
the pieces of circumstantial evidence, netted together
by prosecution in said case. Situation in the instant
case is however, the other way round and the
prosecution could not net together the chain of
circumstantial evidence connecting the accused with
commission of the offence. Hon’ble apex Court in the
case of Imran alias Dully and another vs. The State
and others reported as 2015 SCMR 155, has held in

this respect;

“By now, it is a consistent view that when
any case rests entirely on circumstantial
evidence then, each piece of evidence
collected must provide all links making
out one straight chain where on one end
its noose fit in the neck of the accused and
the other end touches the dead body. Any
link missing from the chain would
disconnect and break the whole chain to
connect the one with the other and in that
event conviction cannot be safely
recorded and that too on a_ capital
charge.”

-15-
Further reliance in this respect may be
placed on judgments reported as 2016 SCMR 274,

2017 SCMR 986 and 2017 SCMR 2026.

16. In light of what has been discussed above,
conviction and sentence of the appellant recorded vide
judgment dated 15.09.2018 of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge Khwazakhela, District Swat, impugned
in the instant case, is set aside by allowing the instant
appeal. The criminal revision No. 53-M/2018 filed by
complainant for enhancement of the sentence has
resultantly become infructuous and same is

accordingly dismissed.

17. So far as appeal against acquittal of
co-accused is concerned, it is stated that prosecution
has failed to prove the case against principle accused
namely Akbar Khan as well as against respondents in
the instant appeal namely Hakim Khan, Yar
Muhammad Khan and Muhammad Khan. It had
been held by this Court in Muhammadullah’s case
(2018 P_Cr. LJ_1633) in its observation reproduced
hereinabove, that contents of an F.LR disowned by
maker itself, may not be used as evidence against him

nor against co-accused, unless same is proved in

Abdul Sabooh/* {D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
STNG Hon’ ble Mr. Jxstice Wiqar Ahmad

-16-
accordance with law. There had been no direct
evidence available against respondents/accused, as
discussed above. So far statements of PW-8, PW-9 and
PW-13 are concerned, no doubt respondents-accused
have been named therein for commission of the
offence but all such statements were based on hearsay,
as held earlier, and were not reliable therefore. The
instant appeal against acquittal was found to have been

lacking substance and same is accordingly dismissed.

18. These are reasons for our short order,

which read as;

“For reasons to be recorded later, we
allow this appeal, set-aside the judgment
of conviction dated 15.09.2018 passed by
learned Additional Sessions Judge
Khwaza Khela Swat in case FIR No. 48
dated 28.01.2016 registered under
sections 302, 34 PPC read with section 15
A.A at police station Khursheed Khan
Shaheed (Khwaza Khela) District Swat
and resultantly acquit the appellant
namely Akbar Khan of the charges
leveled against him. He be released
forthwith if not required in any other
case.”
