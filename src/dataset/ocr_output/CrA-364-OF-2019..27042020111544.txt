AHMAD ALL, J:- Appellant, Abdul Haleem
son of Abdul Hayee, has called in question the
acquittal of accused/respondents, Saif-ur-Rehman son
of Qass Malook, Qazi Malook son of Sherwan,
Shikrat Khan son of Sagheer Shah and Roop Mian
son of Mamar Shah, in case F.I.R No. 677 dated
06.06.2016 under Sections 302/34 PPC of PS City,
District Mansehra, vide impugned judgment dated
26.09.2019 of the learned Additional Sessions Judge-
Il, Mansehra by filing instant appeal under section
417 (2-A) Cr.P.C.

2. Brief facts of the case are that the
complainant, Abdul Haleem son of Abdul Hayee,

lodged the report to Qaim Ali Shah, IHC, Police
Station City, Mansehra, in Emergency Ward of
KATH, Mansehra , who reached there on receipt of
information about the occurrence, on 06.06.2016 at
18.45 hours to the effect that at ‘Asar waila’ he
alongwith his brothers Shabbir Ahmad and Abdul
Malik was proceedings towards ‘Lari Adda’
Mansehra, on link road behind Pakistan Hotel; when
they reached near Kohistan Service Station, a 20D
motorcar bearing registration No.401-Sindh red
colour was already parked there and Saif-ur-Rehman
duly armed with 30 bore pistol was standing near the
car, while Qazi Malook, Shikrat Khan and Roop Mian
alighted from the motorcar; Qazi Malook commanded
to kill them, Saif-ur-Rehman, Shikrat Khan and Roop
Mian started firing at them, as a result, Shabbir
Ahmad, his brother got injured on his head with the
firing of Saif-ur-Rehman. Accused fled away from
the spot after commission of the offence. The
occurrence was stated to have witnessed by the
complainant, his brother Abdul Malik and_ other
people on the spot. Motive for the offence was stated
to be family dispute. The injured was succumbed to

his injuries on the way when he was being shifted to
ces)

hospital. He charged the accused for ‘ Qatl-i-Amd’ of
his brother, Shabbir Ahmad. The report of the
complainant was recorded in shape of ‘Murasila’
(Ex.PA) by Qaim Ali Shah, IHC (PW-4) and the
instant case was registered against him vide F.LR
(Ex.PW 5/1).

3. After completion of investigation, complete/
supplementary challans were submitted by the SHO in
the Court of Sessions for trial against
accused/respondents, named above, who were charged
for the offence under section 302/34 PPC, but they
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution
in support of its case, examined twenty one witnesses
including Abdul Haleem, complainant/eyewitness
(PW-19) and Abdul Malik, eyewitness (PW-20).
After closure of prosecution evidence, accused/
respondents were also examined under section 342
Cr.P.C, wherein, they denied the allegations of the
prosecution leveled against them in this case.
However, they wished not to produce defence
evidence or to appear on Oath as their own witnesses

under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C.
4. The learned trial Court, after hearing the
arguments of learned counsel for the parties, acquitted
the accused/respondents vide impugned judgment/
order dated 26/09/2019. Hence, the present appeal.

5. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
appellant-complainant heard. Record perused.

6. Admittedly, the alleged occurrence was stated
to have taken place on 06.06.2016 at ‘Asar Waila’ on
link Road behind Pakistan Hotel near Kohistan
Service Station Mansehra. However, the report of the
occurrence was lodged by Abdul Haleem
complainant-cum-eyewitness (PW-19) at 18.45 hours
and the occurrence was stated to have also witnessed
by his brother, Abul Malik (PW-20). In this case the
exact time of occurrence was not established and in
this regard the statements of the eyewitnesses and the
investigation officers are contradictory and the
learned trial Court has discussed this aspect of the
case in the judgment elaborately and has rightly
concluded at the very outset that the time of
occurrence was doubtful. This Court has also gone
through the evidence of the abovementioned

eyewitnesses and the scriber of ‘Murasila’, namely,
Qaim Ali Shah, IHC (PW-4) and Fida Muhammad,
investigation Officer (PW-16). Although the alleged
eyewitnesses in their statements before the Court had
taken another stance to cover up the inordinate delay
of more than four hours in lodging report qua the
occurrence by saying that due to heavy rush of traffic
on road they could not timely reach the hospital but
the above explanation of the P.Ws also could not be
substantiated by the police officials i.e. PW-4 and
PW-16 in their statements rather they belied this
stance of the eyewitnesses. Even otherwise while
keeping in view the distance between the spot and the
hospital, it would hardly take half an hour to reach the
hospital from the spot. Thus, the alleged delay in
lodging the report in view of peculiar facts and
circumstances gained much significance, as such, the
factors of deliberation, consultation and preliminary
investigation could not be ruled out.

7. The version of the alleged eyewitnesses was
that they alongwith their deceased brother, Shabbir
Ahmad were proceeding towards ‘Lari Adda’
Mansehra, when they confronted with the accused

party on link road behind Pakistan Hotel, where
accused/respondent Saif-ur-Rehman duly armed with
30 bore pistol was standing near the car, while other
three accused alighted from the car and they made
indiscriminate firing at them on the command of co-
acquitted accused Qazi Malook. The effective role of
‘Qatl-i-Amd’ of deceased Shabbir Ahmad was
attributed to accused/respondent, Saif-ur-Rehman.
Astonishingly, despite alleged indiscriminate firing by
three accused, none of the PWs tried to escape or hit
with a single fire shot and they were surprisingly
standing firm to watch minutely that the fire shot of
Saif-ur-Rehman hit the deceased on his head, which in
the ordinary course of life is impossible. It is also
beyond one's comprehension as to why the accused let
the alleged eyewitnesses to go safely to lodge report
and stand eyewitnesses against them. The minute
scrutiny of the entire evidence would lead to the
obvious inference that the occurrence had not taken
place in the mode and manner as alleged by the
eyewitnesses. The ocular version furnished by the
eyewitnesses is full of improvements and
discrepancies and also does not support by the

medical evidence.
8. It is settled law that once intrinsic wort of
ocular account is accepted and believed then the rest
of the evidence, both circumstantial and corroboratory
in nature, would be required as a matter of caution.
Conversely, once the ocular account is disbelieved
then no other evidence, even of a high degree and
value, would be sufficient for recording conviction on
a capital charge. It is also settled principle of
justice that on acquittal an accused person earns
twofold innocence. Moreover, the standard and
principle of appreciation of evidence is entirely
different from that in a case of conviction. The
findings of the trial Court could only be reversed by
this Court in its appellate jurisdiction, when the same
are found perverse, fanciful, arbitrary or based on
misreading and non-reading of material evidence
causing miscarriage of justice. Reliance can be placed
on 1995 SCMR 127, 2015 SCMR 1142, 2017 SCMR
2002, 2017 SCMR 2007, and 2017 SCMR 1710.

9. In view of above discussions, it is crystal clear
that the case of the prosecution is full of doubts and
the statements of the complainant/eyewitnesses are

contradictory, which create serious doubts about the
mode and manner of the occurrence and veracity of
the testimony furnished by the alleged eyewitnesses.
As such, the learned trial court has rightly acquitted
the accused/respondent and its judgment does not
need to be interfered with by this Court in_ its
Appellate jurisdiction.
10. It is well settled law that even a single doubt,
if found reasonable, would entitle the accused person
to acquittal and not a combination of several doubts.
Reliance is placed on case titled Ghulam Qadir Vs.
The State (2008 SCMR 1221), wherein, it has held
that:

“Tt needs no reiteration that for the

purpose of giving benefit of doubt to

an accused person, more than one

infirmity is not required, a_ single

infirmity crating reasonable doubt in

the mind of a reasonable and prudent

mind regarding the truth of charge-

makers the whole case doubtful.

Merely because the burden is on

accused to prove his innocence it does

not absolve the prosecution to prove

its case against the accused beyond

any shadow of doubt in this duty does

not change or vary in the case.”
Reliance is also placed on case law reported as 1992
SCMR 366, 1995 SCMR 1345, 1995 SCMR 1730,
2004 SCMR 215, 2004 SCMR 140, 2009 SCMR

230, 2013 SCMR 192, 2016 SCMR 2073, 2016 PSC
(Criminal) 612, 2017 PSC (Criminal) 14, 2017 S C

M R 986 and 2019 P.Cr.L.J. 337.

11. Accordingly, for the reasons _ stated
hereinabove, this Court is of the considered view that
the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond any
reasonable doubt against the accused/respondents,
hence, the instant appeal being devoid of substance is

hereby dismissed in /imine.
