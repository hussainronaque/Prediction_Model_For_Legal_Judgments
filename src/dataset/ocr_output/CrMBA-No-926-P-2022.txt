Petitioner (Doctor Khan) By Mr. Asghar Ali Khan, Advocate .

Respondent (State) By Mr. Muhammad Nisar Khan, AAG.

ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM J:- Doctor Khan son
of Jamal Khan, the petitioner, has submitted the
instant Criminal Miscellaneous application under
section-426 (2B) Cr.PC for suspension of his
sentence and his release on bail till final disposal
of the main Criminal Appeal filed by him before
the Hon’ble Supreme Court, whereby he
impugned the judgment dated 29.06.2016
rendered by this Court in Criminal Appeal
No.269-P/2014, in case FIR No. 147/2013 dated
24.03.2013 under Section-9 (c) CNSA,

registered at Police Station City, Hangu.
2. The brief facts of the prosecution case are
that on 24.03.2013 Azmat Ali SHO posted at
Police Station City Hangu, alongwith police party
had laid nakabandi at the place of occurrence and
received spy information that huge quantity of
contraband would be smuggled by Javed Khan in
truck bearing registration No.GLT-7214; that at
about 16:30 hours, the said truck reached the
Nakabandi, which was stopped for the purpose of
checking; that the driver of the truck was
deboarded, who on query disclosed his name as
Doctor Khan son of Jamal Khan while the other
person sitting on front seat disclosed his name as
Javed Iqbal son of Abdul Ghani; that during search
of the truck 104 packets of charas was recovered;
that on weighment the total weight of contraband
charas came to 113 KG; that sample of ten grams
from each packet of charas garda was separated

for chemical analysis, sealed into separate parcels
while the remaining quantity of contraband charas
were sealed into separate parcels. The
complainant arrested the accused, took into
possession the contraband alongwith vehicle in
question through recovery memo, drafted
murasila and sent the same to police station for
registration of case FIR against the accused.

3. On completion of investigation, chailan
against the accused was submitted before the
learned trial Court. On conclusion of trial, the
learned trial Court vide judgment dated
02.04.2014 convicted the petitioner and his
co-accused Javed Iqbal u/s-9(c) CNSA and both
were sentenced to imprisonment for life with a
fine of Rs.5,00,000/- each or in default whereof,
they shall further undergo three years S.I.
Petitioner Doctor Khan filed Criminal Appeal
No.269-P/2014 while the co-accused Javed Iqbal

filed Criminal Appeal No.232-P/2014 before this
Court challenging the legality of the judgment
passed by the learned trial Court. After hearing
arguments of learned counsel for the parties, this
Court vide judgment dated 29.09.2016
dismissed the appeal filed by the petitioner Doctor
Khan; while the appeal filed by the co-accused
Javed Iqbal was allowed and he was acquitted of
the charges leveled against him.

4. The petitioner Doctor Khan impugned the
judgment dated 29.06.2016 passed by this Court
before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan by
filing Jail Petition No.604/2016 and vide order
dated 21.10.2021 leave to appeal was granted.

5. Arguments heard. Record perused.

6. This Court derives its power to grant bail
pending appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme Court
against the judgment of this Court in a criminal
case from section 426 (2B) of the Criminal

Procedure Code, which reads as follows:
“426. Suspension of sentence pending appeals--
Release of appellant on bail: (1) ........

(2-B) Where a High Court is satisfied that a
convicted person has been granted special leave
to appeal to the Supreme Court against any
sentence which it has imposed or maintained, it
may, if it so thinks fit order that pending the
appeal the sentence or order appealed against be
suspended and, also, if the said person is in

confinement, that he be released on bail.”

7. The section indeed has a chequered history.
It got enacted vide Act No. IV of 1946. Before
that, the High Courts had varying interpretations
of the bail power pending special leave to appeal.
The Privy Council in Jairam Das V.s King-
Emperor, AIR 1945 PC 94 set at rest the
conflicting viewpoints and concluded that the
High Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain bail, in
case where appeal against the judgment of High
Court is pending before the Hon’ble Supreme
Court. However, in the concluding para, it
suggested conferring such power on the High

Court.
8. Significantly, while the Privy Council ruled
that the High Court lacked jurisdiction to grant
bail, it did not suspend the sentence in any of the
cases. Instead, it referred to Section 401 Cr. PC
about the provincial government powers to be
exercised in appropriate case for the ends of
justice.

9, After independence of India and Pakistan,
being alive to the situation, the Indian Law
Commission recommended in forty-first report
published in 1969, that the ibid section needs
omission from the statute. The relevant passage

from the law commission report is as follows:

“Sub-section (2-B) was inserted in 1945, when
special leave could be granted only by the Privy
Council which was far away. The Adaptation
Order of 1950 substituted “Supreme Court” for
“Privy Council” without considering whether
there is any practical need for the provision. The
Supreme Court is not far away, and when the
party has_taken_the trouble_and_ incurred the
necessary expense in obtaining special leave from
the Supreme Court, he could easily request that
Court, while_granting special leave to _be_ given
appropriate interim relief. We recommend the

omission of the sub-section (2B).

We_have also considered the suggestions
to_amend_ sub-section (2B) enabling the High
Court to grant interim relief to a person during
the interval between the date of the dismissal of
his appeal by the High Court and the date of
grant of special leave by the Supreme Court. In
our view any such widening of the scope of the
sub-section is neither_necessary nor desirable.
With _the quick means_of transport available
nowadays, it should not be difficult for a party to
approach the Supreme _Court__and__ obtain

appropriate interim relief without delay.”
(Emphasis provided)

Given the above suggestion, the law was

amended, and now the relevant section of the

Indian Criminal Procedure Code reads as follows:

“389. (1) Pending any appeal by a convicted
person, the Appellate Court may, for reasons to
be recorded by it in writing, order that the
execution of the sentence or order appealed
against be suspended and, also, if he is in
confinement, that he be released on bail, or on
his own bond.

(2) The power conferred by this section on an
Appellate Court may be exercised also by the
High Court in the case of an appeal by a
convicted person to a Court subordinate thereto.
(3) Where the convicted person satisfies the Court
by which he is convicted that he intends to

present an appeal, the Court shail,
10.

(i) Where such person, being on bail, is

sentenced to imprisonment for a term not

exceeding three years, or

(ii) Where the offence of which such

person has been convicted is a bailable

one, and he is on bail.
Order that the convicted person be released on
bail, unless there are special reasons for refusing
bail, for such period as ill afford sufficient time to
present the appeal and obtain the orders of the
Appellate Court under sub-section (1); and the
sentence of imprisonment shall, so long as he is

so released on bail, be deemed to be suspended.

(4) When the appellant is ultimately sentenced to
imprisonment for a term or to imprisonment for
life, the time during which he is so released shall
be excluded in computing the term for which he

is so sentence.”

It is clear that the reasons cited in the ibid

judgment do not apply in the post-independence

period. Similarly, Hon’ble Supreme Court of

Pakistan has taken care of the matter in question

while framing its Rules as mandated by Article-

191 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of

Pakistan, 1973.
Chapter-XXII Rule-11 of the Supreme
Court of Pakistan Rules, 1980, which reads as
under;

“11. Pending the disposal of any appeal under

this Order the Court may order that the execution

of the sentence or order appealed against be

Stayed on such terms as the Court may think fit.”

In several cases, Honorable the Supreme
Court of Pakistan suspended the sentence: see for
instance, Anwarul Haq Vv National
Accountability Bureau, (PLD 2009 SC 388),

and Sattu Khan v the State, (1988 SCMR 24).

11. But as is clear from the verdict, the
preposition was not resolved. Doubtlessly, the
High Court becomes functus officio after ruling
on a /is. Until and unless it can be shown why a
petition for the suspension of the sentence could
not be lodged in the first instance before the
Honorable Supreme Court, the High Court's seisin
does not revive.

12. From the above discussion, when the

Hon’ble Apex Supreme Court has already taken
10

cognizance of the matter and while this Court has
already dismissed the appeal and has maintained
his conviction recorded by the learned trial Court
and when there is no legal impediment in the way
of the petitioner to approach the Hon’ble Apex
Court, we deem it not proper to suspend the
sentence awarded to the petitioner and confirmed
by this Court. Hence, the instant Criminal
Miscellaneous Petition / Bail application under
section-426 (2B) Cr. PC filed by the petitioner for
suspension of his sentence is dismissed.
