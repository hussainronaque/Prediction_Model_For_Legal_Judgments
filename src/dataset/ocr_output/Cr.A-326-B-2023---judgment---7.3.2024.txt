JUDGMENT

SAHIBZADA_ASADULLAH, J. Through this single

judgment we intend to decide the instant criminal
appeal as well as the connected Cr.R No.51-B/2023
“Munir Khan Vs The State etc”, as both the cases
are the outcome of one and same judgment dated
12.07.2023, passed by learned Additional Sessions
Judge-|, Lakki Marwat, delivered in case FIR No.890
dated 30.12.2018 under sections 302/506/452/354
PPC, Police Station Lakki, whereby the appellant was
convicted and sentenced in the following manner:-

i. Under section 302 (b) of the
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 the
appellant is sentenced thereunder to
imprisonment for life (R.I) as Ta’zir with
payment of compensation of
Rs.4,00,000/- (four lac) to the legal heirs
of deceased under section 544-A
Cr.P.C, recoverable as arrears of land
revenue or in default to undergo simple
imprisonment for a period of six months.
ii. The accused was also held guilty
of trespassing into the house of
complainant in order to commit offence
punishable with death, he was convicted
under section 449 of the Pakistan Penal
Code, 1860 and was sentenced to
Rigorous Imprisonment for 06 years and
payment of Rs.10,000/- as __ fine,
recoverable as arrears of land revenue
or in default to undergo simple
imprisonment for a period of three
months.

iii. The accused was also held guilty
of criminally intimidating the complainant
Muneer Khan and eyewitness Mst.
Nasreen Bibi by threatening to cause
their murders or grievous hurt by aiming
his pistol at them and was convicted
under section 506 (ii) of the Pakistan
Penal Code, 1860 and was sentenced
thereunder to Rigorous Imprisonment
for three years and payment of
Rs.10,000/- as fine, recoverable as
arrears of land revenue or in default to
undergo simple imprisonment for a
period of one month. All the sentences
shall run concurrently. The convict was
given the benefit of Section 382-B of the
Code of Criminal Procedure.”

2. The facts merging from the contents of FIR are
that on 30.12.2018 at 16:40 hours complainant Munir
Khan brought the dead body of his sister Mst. Salma
Bibi to the police station in a Datsun pickup with the
help of co-villagers and reported the matter to the
police that on the day of incident he alongwith his
sisters Mst. Nasreen Bibi and deceased Salma Bibi
were present in their house, when the accused Zahir
Abbas armed with 30 bore pistol entered into their
house, grabbed the hand of Mst. Salma Bibi and
forcibly tried to take her along. When he (the
complainant) and his sister Mst. Nasreen Bibi tried to
intervene, the accused aimed his pistol at them and
threatened to kill them. The accused tried to take Mst.
‘Salma Bibi alongwith him, but she resisted due to

which he got annoyed and fired at her, as a result
whereof she got injured and fell down. In the
meanwhile Mst. Nasreen Bibi tried to catch hold of the
accused and during scuffle with accused, right sleeve
_ of her shirt was torn and the accused managed to
decamp. The complainant party being empty handed
could do nothing and when they attended Mst. Salma
Bibi, she breathed her last. Motive for the offence was
that accused had demanded the hand of Mst. Salma
Bibi, but they had refused, as she was already
engaged to one Tariq Zaman. He charged the accused
for commission of the offence, hence, the present FIR.
3. After arrest of the accused and completion of
investigation, complete challan was put in Court. The
provisions of Section 265-C Cr.P.C were complied with
and charge was framed against the appellant to which
he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order to
substantiate its claim, prosecution produced and
examined 10 PWs. After closure of the prosecution
evidence, statement of accused was recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C, however, neither he opted to be
examined on oath under section 340 Cr.P.C, nor
wished to produce evidence in defence. The learned
trial Court, after conclusion of the trial, found the
appellant guilty of the charge and sentenced him as
mentioned in the earlier part of this judgment, hence,
this appeal.

4. | We have considered the submissions of learned

counsel for the parties, alongwith learned AAG for the
State and with their valuable assistance the record
was scanned through.

5. ‘It was on 30.12.2018 when the deceased lost
her life, owing to firearm injuries, the dead body was
shifted to the police station, where the complainant
reported the matter and the eyewitness verified the
same. The injury sheet and inquest report were
prepared and the dead body was sent for postmortem
examination. The investigating officer received copy of
the FIR, visited the spot and on pointation of the
witnesses prepared the site plan. During spot
inspection blood stained earth was collected from the
place of the deceased and two empties of .30 bore
from the place assigned to the accused/appellant. The
accused after commission of the offence went into
hiding till his arrest on 20.11.2019.The appellant faced
the trial and on conclusion of the trial the learned trial
Court was pleased to convict and sentence him, vide
the impugned judgment.

6. The learned trial Court appreciated the evidence
and statements of witnesses and found the appellant
guilty. As single accused is charged that too for the
murder of a 16-year-old minor girl, so this Court is to
see as to whether the prosecution succeeded in
bringing home guilt of the appellant and as to whether
the learned trial Court was justified in picking the
sentence it did. There is no denial to the fact that in

case of single accused substitution is the rarest
phenomenon, but it by itself will not be the only
determining factor, rather the prosecution is to collect
independent evidence and the Courts are to apply their
judicial mind with extra caution, so that justice is not
miscarried.

Z __ The points for determination before this Court
are as to whether the incident occurred in the mode,
manner and at the stated time; as to whether the
witnesses were present at the time of incident and that
the report was made by the complainant; as to whether
the incident occurred inside the house of the
complainant and that the medical evidence supports
the case of the prosecution and as to whether the
prosecution succeeded in bringing home guilt against
the appellant.

8. The tragic event resulted in the untimely death
of a young girl who had yet to experience the fullness
of life. The motives driving the accused to commit the
crime, as well as the manner in which the victim was
killed, necessitate a thorough reevaluation of the
available evidence. In order to resolve the controversy,
we deem it essential to go through the statements of
the witnesses. The unfortunate incident occurred at
1600 hours, the matter was reported to the local police
in the police station at 1640 hours, whereas the FIR
was chalked out at 1710 hours, so apparently the
matter was promptly reported. The incident occurred

inside the house of the deceased and that the matter
was reported by the complainant i.e. her brother and
verified by the eyewitness i.e. her sister, so this Court
is to confirm from record the availability of these two
witnesses at the time of incident and thereafter. The
complainant was examined as PW-6, who stated that
on the day of incident he alongwith his family members
was present in the house; that the accused/appellant
entered the house, duly armed; warned them not to
move and dragged the deceased towards the main
gate of the house; that the deceased resisted and the
appellant fired at her; that after receiving firearm
injuries the deceased fell on the ground; that Mst.
Nasreen wanted to catch hold of the accused and
during struggle her shirt was torn; that the accused
decamped from the spot; the dead body was shifted to
the police station, where the matter was reported. The
eyewitness was examined as PW-7, who also narrated
the events which led to the tragic incident and she also
supported the report of the complainant. The
witnesses were put to the test of searching cross-
examination, but the witnesses remained consistent on
material aspects of the case. In this particular case it is
not only the eyewitness account which was taken into
consideration, rather the official witnesses also
remained consistent in respect of shifting of dead body
from police station to the hospital and in respect of the
time at which the matter was reported, the documents

were prepared and the dead body was received by the
doctor. The complainant disclosed that during the days
of incident he was posted at Mir Ali in Frontier
Constabulary and it was on an official visit that he
accompanied his high-ups to D.I.Khan and it was on
their permission that he visited his house on
27.12.2018 and remained there. He further disclosed
that it was 1600 hours, when the accused/appellant
entered the house, wanted to take away the deceased,
but on her resistance she was done to death.

9. It is pertinent to mention that during spot
inspection the respective places were shown to the
investigating officer and the site plan depicts the initial
places, where the witnesses, the deceased and the
accused/appellant were present and the subsequent
places, when the deceased was dragged and fired at.
The witnesses were examined regarding the manner in
which the incident occurred and regarding the places
where they, the deceased and the appellant were
present. The complainant explained that he was
present at distance of 15 feet from the appellant and
that when the appellant dragged the deceased, he
came few feet forward, but when the deceased was
fired at, the eyewitness rushed to the appellant and
attempted to catch hold of him. He further explained
that during the struggle the shirt of the eyewitness was
torn and the accused/appellant decamped from the
spot. When the eyewitness was examined in this

respect, she explained the circumstances, as were
explained by the complainant. When the statements of
these two witnesses are juxtaposed, we could not
come across the slightest variation between the two,
rather the witnesses remained exact and accurate
regarding the manner in which the incident occurred
and regarding their individual responses at the time
and after the incident. The witnesses were asked
regarding the remaining family members, who
explained the same and when the investigating officer
was asked as to why he did not record statements of
the remaining inmates of the house, he explained that
as three of the brothers of the complainant were
drivers by profession and were not available and that
he did. not record the statements of the remaining
family members. Defense tried to impress that no
family member other than the complainant and the
eyewitness was not willing and interested in taking part
in his prosecution. We stand unmoved, as the incident
was witnessed by the most naturally placed persons,
whose presence cannot be disputed. We are surprised
with the manner in which the witnesses responded to
the questions put to them. An attempt was made to
convince that Mst. Nasreen was not present in the
house, as she was married to one Adnan, whose
house was situated at a distance of one kilometer from
the spot house. The witnesses explained that as Mst.
Nasreen and her husband were having strained

relations, so the eyewitness left his house many years
before the incident. Both the witnesses were examined
in this respect and both the witnesses remained
consistent and they explained the circumstances in
which Mst. Nasreen left the house of her husband. The
presence of the eyewitness cannot be doubted, as it
was she who wanted to resist the killing, it was she
who attacked the appellant and it was during the
scuffle that she got her shirt torn and the same was
taken into possession by the investigating officer and
the same was duly exhibited. The eyewitness was
asked as to whether she handed over the shirt in the
police station to the investigating officer, she replied
that as at the time of report she was putting on the
shirt, so she could not, rather she handed over the
same to the investigating officer during spot inspection.
The explanation of the witness is not only convincing,
but natural as well, as she was putting on the shirt at
the time of report, so there was hardly an occasion for
her to remove the same in the police station. This
particular circumstance has_ strengthened the
prosecution case, as the incident occurred all at once,
as the dead body was hurriedly shifted to the police
station, so there was hardly an occasion for the
eyewitness to change her clothes, rather she with the
complainant shifted the dead body to the police
station. Her presence in the house at the time of
incident and in the police station at the time of report

gets support from this aspect of the case. The manner
10

in which the circumstances are explained is so
accurate that despite efforts the defence could not
create even a small dent to persuade the mind of this
Court otherwise. The dead body was shifted to the
police station in a Datsun pickup arranged from the
road and besides the complainant and eyewitness
other private people also accompanied the same. The
dead body was identified by one Suran and one
Gultiaz and admittedly these two witnesses are not
only the relatives of the deceased, but were living in
the same village and in the same area. The defence
wanted to convince that when the dead body was not
identified by the complainant and the eyewitness, then
no other inference can be drawn, but the one that they
were not present with the dead body. We are not
convinced with what was submitted, as admittedly the
incident occurred inside the house and as admittedly
the dead body was hurriedly shifted to the police
station, so the witnesses being inmates of the house
were very much available and that they accompanied
the dead body from spot to the police station. If an
attempt was made to procure witnesses, then instead
of Mst. Nasreen the prosecution would have planted a
male member from the house, but it did not. The
attending circumstances of the present case leave no
ambiguity regarding the presence of the witnesses at
the time of occurrence and at the time of report. As the

incident occurred inside the house, so availability of
11

identifiers in the hospital with the dead body is natural.
Had the incident occurred away from the village, then
the defense could convince, but in this particular case
we are not ready to subscribe to the submissions of
the learned counsel. Even otherwise, it is not
necessary that in all cases the complainant and the
eyewitness must be the identifiers and in our
understanding no procedural illegality was committed.
The identifiers were examined regarding _ their
presence in the police station and regarding their
arrival to the police station, but they validly explained
the manner in which they received information and
came to the police station. As the matter was promptly
reported, so to test the veracity of witnesses, every
individual witness was asked regarding the time at
which the dead body arrived to the police station and
regarding the time the dead body was shifted to the
hospital. The scribe was examined as PW-5, who
disclosed that while present in police station the dead
body was brought by the complainant Munir
accompanied by Mst. Nasreen and private people. He
further explained that the complainant reported the
matter and the eyewitness verified the same. The
witness explained that the dead body was dispatched
to the hospital at 1710 hours and he also confirmed
the distance between the police station and hospital as
one kilometer. In respect of the time we deem it

essential to re-consider the statement of another
12

witness who escorted the dead body of the deceased
from the police station to the hospital, who was
examined as PW-4. The witness explained that he
took the dead body from police station to hospital
alongwith injury sheet and inquest report. He further
explained that after postmortem examination he
received the dead body, postmortem report and
garments of the deceased and handed over the same
to the investigating officer on the spot. It is interesting
to note that this witness was questioned regarding the
time at which the dead body, the injury sheet and
inquest report were handed over to him, he explained
that he received the same in police station at 05:13 pm
to 05:15 pm. He also explained that he handed over
the dead body to the doctor at 05:23pm /05:24 pm and
he further confirmed that he left the hospital for the
spot at 06:30 pm. Not only these witnesses, but the
doctor also confirmed the time between injury and
death and the time between death and postmortem.
Admittedly, the postmortem was conducted at 06:00
pm, so all the three witnesses agreed in particulars
and they supported the manner in which the dead
body was brought to the police station, the report was
made and the same was received by the doctor. The
consistency amongst these witnesses by itself is
sufficient to tell regarding the veracity and trustfulness
of the witnesses. The question was put to the

complainant regarding the condition of the deceased at
13

the time of shifting to the police station, though he
disclosed that her chin and toe were tied, but when the
eyewitness was examined, she explained that she
straightened her legs and arms, but she did not tie her
chin and her toe. An attempt was made to convince
that had the witnesses been present, then the mouth
of the deceased would have been closed and her chin
and toe would have been tied. We are not convinced
with this limb of argument of the learned counsel for
the appellant, as admittedly the witnesses were in
panic, they were terrorized, so much so, the
eyewitness struggled to catch hold of the appellant, so
under these circumstances such behavior cannot be
expected from the witnesses. It has never been the
requirement of law that under all circumstances the
eyewitnesses are to close the mouth of the deceased
or must tie the chin and toe of the deceased, rather it
depends upon the particular circumstances of each
particular case. We cannot apply such rules which are
not universal and we cannot shut our eyes to the fact
that human behavior is dynamic and not static. There
is no denial to this fact that every individual responds
differently in different circumstances and in different
situations. As the dead body was hurriedly shifted to
the police station and the matter was reported within
40 minute of the occurrence, so the prompt report by
itself confirms that no consultation and no deliberation

was made. True that the witnesses are related, but
14

mere relationship of the witnesses would hardly be a
ground for excluding their presence on the spot, unless
the defence succeeds to convince that the witnesses
had an interest to falsely implicate. Reliance can be
placed on “Imran Mehmood Vs the State and
another” (2023 SCMR 795), which reads as follows: -

“However, it is by now a well-established
principle of law that mere relationship of the
prosecution witnesses with the deceased
cannot be a ground to discard the testimony
of such witnesses out-rightly. If the presence
of the related witnesses at the time of
occurrence is natural and their evidence is
straight forward and confidence inspiring,
then the same can be safely relied upon to
award capital punishment. Learned counsel
for the appellant could not point out any
reason as to why the complainant has falsely
involved the appellant in the present case
and let off the real culprit, who has brutally
murdered her father and uncle. Substitution
in such like cases is a rare phenomenon.”

410. The investigating officer, examined as PW-9,
explained as to how he and the witnesses reached to
the spot and that how the spot was pointed out and
recoveries were made from the spot. The record tells
that during spot inspection the investigating officer
collected two empties of .30 bore from the spot,
supports the stance of the complainant. It is further
_ supported by the medical evidence, as the unfortunate
deceased received two fatal firearm injuries on her

body. The investigating officer was asked regarding
‘)

15

non-examination of the other family members, who
confirmed that three brothers of the complainant were
drivers by profession, and were not available in the
house, so he recorded the statements of the
eyewitness. The non-examination of some witnesses
by itself is not a determining factor and it cannot be
weighed in favour of the appellant. As admittedly, two
trustworthy and reliable witnesses were examined, so
it is not the quantity, but the quality of evidence which
the prosecution must produce. It is the prerogative of
prosecution to select its witnesses from an available
range. As the complainant and eyewitness witnessed
the incident and as they succeeded to resist the
searching cross-examination, so non-examination of
any other witness would hardly be a circumstance to
favor the appellant. It is evident from record and so
confirmed by the witnesses that the appellant was the
resident of the same village and that he was interested
in marrying the deceased. It has been brought on
record that the deceased was already engaged to one
Tariq Zaman, but even then the appellant was
pressing for her hand and it was his stubbornness
which persuaded him to kill the deceased. True that
the statements of the mother of the deceased and that
of Tariq Zaman were not recorded, but as mentioned
earlier, the choice of witnesses is for the prosecution to
exercise, and non-production of a witness does not

damage the rest of their evidence. True that no spent
16

bullet was recovered and no bullet mark was noted on
the walls of the house, but as two empties were
recovered from the spot and two injuries were received
by the deceased, so the circumstances tell that the
appellant fired two fire shots.

11. The medical. evidence fully supports the ocular
account. As the witnesses disclosed that the deceased
was dragged and then fired upon. The doctor was
examined as PW-8, who explained the nature of
injuries in the following manner:-

F Firearm entry wound .5x5 inch on
the frontal temporal region about 02
inches from the pina of left ear.

ii. Firearm exit wound on the right
perital region about 02 inches
above the pina of right ear 1x1 in
size.

iii. | Firearm entry wound on the front of
left shoulder joint .5x5 inch in size.
Corresponding holes in Qamis f
ound.

iv. Firearm exit wound on the back

near the root of neck on right side
1x1 inch with averted margins.”

It is interesting to note that the firearm entry wounds
on the frontal temporal region were having tattoo in
around it. The presence of tattooing sufficiently
explains that the deceased was fired at from the
closest range and the same confirms the statements of
the witnesses, who disclosed that the deceased was
dragged and fired. The medical evidence is in harmony
with the ocular account. The consistency between the
two has established the prosecution case beyond

doubt and it confirms that the incident occurred in the
17

mode, manner and at the stated time. As is held in
case titled “Ansar and others Versus The State and
others”, (2023 SCMR 929), which is reproduced
herein below: -

“All these witnesses of the ocular account
remained consistent on each and every
material point qua the date, time, mode,
manner of the occurrence and the locale of
the injuries on the person of the deceased
and the injured PW. Sarfraz (PW-3) had
sustained injuries during the occurrence,
which have fully been supported by the
medical evidence given by Dr. Muhammad
Tariq, who appeared as PW-8. The
testimony of this injured PW as well as the
stamp of injuries on his person clearly
proves his presence at the place of
occurrence. These PWs _ remained
consistent on each and every material point
inasmuch as they made _ deposition
according to the circumstances surfaced in
this case, therefore, it can safely be
concluded that the ocular account furnished
by _ the prosecution is reliable,
straightforward and confidence inspiring.
These PWs were subjected to lengthy
cross-examination but their testimonies
could not be shattered.”

12. The collected empties were sent to the firearms
expert to ascertain that from how many weapons the
same were fired. After examining the same a
comprehensive report was received, telling that the
same were fired from one weapon. As single accused
is charged and as it was he who fired at the deceased,
so the laboratory report has supported the prosecution
case to a great extent. True that laboratory report is
supportive in nature, but equally true that once veracity
of the witness is not shattered, then this piece of
evidence can be taken into consideration and as such

we considered the same.
18

13. The motive was stated to be the demand of the
hand of the deceased and that as the deceased was
engaged to one Tariq Zaman, so the demand of the
appellant could not be fulfilled. True that apart from the
witnesses, no other witness was examined, but as
there was no previous ill-will between the parties, so
the arrival of the appellant to the house and killing of
the deceased, are the circumstances that lend
credence to the prosecution’s position, that the
appellant was interested in marrying the deceased. As
the unfortunate incident occurred inside the house and
as the deceased was targeted, despite the fact that
other family members were present, so it confirms the
interest of the appellant in the deceased and that he
wanted to have her at any cost. Weakness or absence
of motive hardly justifies acquittal if the charge is
otherwise established. It is well settled that absence of
motive would hardly be a circumstance for the acquittal
of an accused, provided the prosecution otherwise
succeeds in establishing its charge and in proving the
guilt of the accused. As the prosecution fully
succeeded in bringing home guilt against the
appellant, so the weakness or absence of motive
would hardly be a circumstance to come to his rescue.
414. The appellant remained absconder for sufficient
long time till his arrest on 20.11.2019. The appellant
failed to explain that why he did not surrender to the

law enforcement agency, soon after the incident. True
19

that abscondence alone would hardly be a
circumstance for the conviction of an accused, but
when the prosecution succeeds in establishing its case
and when the witnesses confirmed their trustfulness,
then abscondence as a circumstance can be taken
into consideration. As the witnesses remained firm and
consistent, so the unexplained abscondence is a
circumstance which, we are inclined to read in favour
of the prosecution.

15. The cumulative effect of what has been stated
above, leads this Court to an irresistible conclusion
that the prosecution succeeded in bringing home guilt
against the appellant and that the learned trial Court
was justified in holding him responsible for the murder
of the deceased. The impugned judgment is based on
sound reasons that do not call for interference. The
instant criminal appeal is lacking in substance; the
same is dismissed as such.

16. Now diverting to Criminal Revision No.51-B of
2023, through which the complainant has asked for the
enhancement of sentence. No doubt, the learned trial
Court while handing down the impugned judgment
dilated upon, that particular aspect of the case as well,
still this Court is eager to know as to whether the
reasons given, would serve the purpose. True that the
learned trial Court, while awarding the lesser sentence,
was influenced from the alleged motive, as to it the

motive was shrouded in mystery, but equally true that
20

the learned trial Court fell into error while appreciating
this particular aspect of the case. Despite the fact that
prosecution succeeded in establishing its case, the
learned trial Court went for lesser sentence. Although
we would have preferred to know the reasons that
prevailed with learned Court below, however, we deem
it apt to discover the areas that would enable us to
make an appropriate choice about the sentence i.e. life
imprisonment and the death sentence. We are
conscious of the fact that most of the trial Courts take
the absence or weakness of motive a circumstance for
awarding lesser sentence, but in our understanding
this conscious attempt deprives one at the cost of the
other. We note with concern that in most of the cases
the easy choice is the lesser sentence, and this
practice has virtually relegated capital punishment to
redundancy. We do not advocate for capital
punishment; however, it remains a consideration until it
is officially ruled out, and till that time it decorates the
book. Every effort was made by the legislature to curb
the crime and so, for every offence distinct punishment
is provided. We are to apply what is provided, as the
Courts are left with a limited choice to choose it like. In
the matter of sentence the Courts must apply extra
care as it is to protect the interest of the parties.
Human life is scared because from its beginning it
involves the creative action of God and it remains

forever in a special relationship with the creator, who is
21

its sole end. Intentional killing is strongly condemned
and is rewarded with the harshest punishment. The
subject in hand is dealt with in the Holy Quran in the
following manner:-

“And who ever kills a believer
intentionally, their reward will be hell-
where they will stay indefinitely. Allah will
be displeased with them, and will
prepare for a tremendous punishment.”

The Holy Quran first educated, then warned and lastly,
prescribed the punishment to be awarded. The
punishment for killing a human being finds mention in
the Holy Quran in following words:-

“O you who have believed, prescribed
for you is legal retribution for those
murdered — the free for the free, the
slave for the slave, and the female for
the female. But whoever overlooks from
his brother anything, then there should
be a suitable follow-up and payment to
him with good conduct.”

We are not surprised from the gradual attempt to
convince, as Almighty Allah created mankind and He
knew what to follow. We heard the same when the
creation of mankind was decided. The echoes of the
hot talks still occupy the air, what a reasoning that
was:-

“Call to mind, when your Lord

announced to the angels: | am about to

place a vicegerent in the earth. They

said: Will You place there someone, who

creates disorder and bloodshed, while

we glorify You with your praise and extol

your holiness? Allah admonished them: |

know that which you know not.(surah Al-

baqarah 2:30)”
It took years to legislate and the legislature took pain

to look for appropriate punishments, how Qisas is
22

enforced and after what evidence? Society changed
rapidly and so the moral values. [It was. this
degradation which led the responsible to think and
consider that whether the required evidence could be
procured and that the witnesses would qualify the test
sensing the doing an alternate was provided in shape
of Taz'ir, the scope was enlarged with the sole
purpose, behind to reward the killer with the desired
punishment. In cases where Qisas is not enforceable
under section 302 (a) PPC, for so many reasons, the
Courts are endowed with the power to punish under
Tazir under section 302 (b) PPC. Even there the
Courts are left with the choice to award Death as Taz’ir
or imprisonment for life. In our understanding we failed
to appreciate the wisdom behind. Most of us could not
balanced the scale, rather misconstrued the very
purpose. The choice to award Death as Taz’ir or life
imprisonment, under section 302 (b) PPC can never
be restricted to favour the accused, but the same
equally applies while dealing with the adversary. We
must know that if in appropriate cases Qisas cannot be
enforced, even then Death as Taz’ir can be awarded,
but also in appropriate cases the Courts have the
option to punish as imprisonment for life. An other
. alternate under section 302 (c) is also available, but
the same is irrelevant for present discussion. It is not
the matter of choice, rather these are the

circumstances of each particular case which would
23

determine the issue. To be more specific, it is for the
Court to decide whether Death as Taz'ir or
imprisonment for life. The question would arise as to
what would be the determining factor, whether
discretion or the circumstances of that particular case.
In our understanding discretion in this particular matter
alone, will lead to miscarriage of justice unless the
circumstances of that particular case qualify for the
use of discretion. Returning to this particular case, we
are to determine as to what persuaded the learned trial
Court to choose the awarded sentence. As discussed
in the early part of the judgment, that the prosecution
ideally proved its case through the most natural
witnesses. The witnesses passed through searching
cross-examination, but they stood like a rock. The
learned trial Court instead of awarding the normal
penalty of death chose to award the lesser one. We
are to see that what prevailed with the learned trial
Judge to exercise the easiest choice, that too, by
ignoring the tragic aspects of the case and by
overlooking his brutality against the deceased. What a
conduct he displayed against a poor little soul. We
despite efforts could not come across the fault of the
deceased, her only fault was to resist his unholy
wishes, but for the same she received a bad price. The
weakness of motive drifted away the learned trial
Judge from awarding the normal penalty of death, we

find no justification and even the learned Judge failed
24

to justify the same. Discretion must stand on reason
and be circumscribed by law if it is not to descend into
injustice. The trial court's integrity is above board,
however, it is human to err in application of law, and it
is our duty to set it right when noted. In order to do
justice with the little soul of the deceased we deem it
imperative to reevaluate the sentencing of the
appellant. In criminal justice in general, and in the
given circumstances of case in particular, we cannot
afford to be carried away in either direction. This
balance between rights of the individual and the
community is a tight rope walk. The learned trial Court
decided to award the lesser sentence, but it apparently
failed to fully appreciate the manner the deceased was
done to death. The circumstances of the present case
leave little for the absence or weakness of motive.
What reasons he had to kill? He was brutal; he acted
inhumanly. What justification was available to the
convict to kill, that too, by trespassing into the house.
The spot is proved, the witnesses are consistent and
the matter was promptly reported. We are hardly
persuaded from the observations rendered and are not
impressed from the conclusion drawn, so we conclude
that the convict deserves the major penalty of death,
as that would be the appropriate punishment and that
commensurate with the gravity of the offence and

would reciprocate what the appellant did. As is held in
25

case titled “Muhammad Akhtar Ali Vs The State”
(2000 SCMR 727), which reads as follows:-

“In the end, the learned counsel stressed
that it was not a case in which death
penalty could legally be imposed.
However, he was unable to refer to any
mitigating reason/circumstance which
could be considered for awarding the
lesser penalty of life imprisonment. This
was a brutal murder of a young girl of
15/16 years of age without any
justification and the petitioner acted as
desperate and hardened criminal and
fired two shots at innocent girl and so the
imposition of normal penalty of death was
fully justified.”

We, therefore, allow the instant criminal revision to the
extent of conviction under section 302(b) PPC, and
enhance the sentence from life to death; he shall be
hanged by neck till death. The remaining sentences

awarded by the learned trial Court shall remain intact. .
