kee
SHAHID KHAN, J.- Through the subject
appeal, under Section 417(2-A) Cr.PC,
Shafiullah, appellant/complainant, has called in
question the judgment dated 18.5.2018, of
learned Additional Sessions Judge-IJI, D.I.Khan,
whereby, on conclusion of trial of the
respondent/accused Junaid Khan, charged in
case FIR No.526, dated 26.5.2016, under
Sections 302/454/404 PPC, of police station
Cantt, D..Khan, he was acquitted by extending

benefit of doubt to him.
2. The facts, in brief, are that the on
26.5.2016 at 1345 hours, the appellant/
complainant namely, Shafiullah reported to the
local police in his house, situated in Iqbal Town,
that on the eventful day at 12:30 p.m, his relative
Muhammad Gul informed him through his
mobile phone that his wife Mst. Zeenat Bibi and
daughter Mst. Shahzad Bibi alias Shahzadi have
been killed, in their house, by unknown
assailants. On the subject information, he rushed
to the spot/house and found his wife and
daughter lying murdered with a sharp edge
weapon. He reported the event against unknown
accused and disclosed to have no enmity with
anyone. The report of the appellant/complainant
was reduced into writing in the shape of
murasila which culminated into registration of

above referred FIR.

3. On 29.5,2016, the  appellant/
complainant recorded his supplementary
statement, wherein, he charged the respondent/

accused for the commission of offence.

4. On arrest of the respondent/accused

followed by completion of investigation, challan

#%s
was drawn and routed through the relevant

prosecution branch followed by sent up for trial.

5. On commencement of trial, copies
of the evidence (oral & documentary) delivered
to the respondent/accused. He was confronted
with the statements of allegations through formal
charge, but he denied the allegations and pleaded

not guilty and claimed trial.

6. The prosecution to bring home
charge against the respondent/accused, recorded
the account of thirteen (13) witnesses including
CW-1 followed by closure of its evidence. At the
conclusion of prosecution evidence, the
respondent/accused was examined under Section
342 Cr.PC. He professed innocence and false
implication in the case. However, neither he
wished to be examined on Oath as required
under Section 340(2) Cr.PC nor wanted to
produce evidence in the defence. On conclusion
of trial, the learned Additional Sessions Judge-
Ill, D.I.Khan, in view of the evidence so
recorded and assistance at the bar, arrived at the
conclusion that the allegations against the

respondent/accused are tainted with doubts, as
-4-
such, vide impugned judgment, dated,
18.5,2018, his acquittal was recorded

accordingly.

7. We have heard the arguments of the
learned counsel for the parties as well as learned
State counsel and have gone through the record

of the case.

8. According to the  appellant/
complainant (PW-7), on the eventful day he was
on his routine duty as Forest Guard, whereof,
received telephonic information through his
relative, Muhammad Gul (PW-8) that someone
had killed his wife Mst. Zeenat Bibi and
daughter Mst. Shahzad Bibi alias Shahzadi in the
house. PW-8 contended that on the day of
occurrence he was present in his house. At 12:15
p-m., Hizbullah (PW-9), son of the
appellant/complainant, who was shaky and was
weeping, came and informed him that his mother
and sister had been killed by somebody. He
accompanied the PW-9 to his house and saw that
Mst. Zeenat Bibi and Mst. Shahzad Bibi were
lying dead in a room of their house. Hizbullah

(PW-9) stated in his examination-in-chief that on
aSin
the day of occurrence he had gone to his college
and on his returned to the house at about 12:10
p.m., he saw his mother and sister smeared with

blood in the bed room.

9. The subject disclosure of PW-9
(Hizbullah) is sufficient enough to prima facie
observe that the event is an unseen occurrence.
Likewise appellant/complainant Shafiullah,
Muhammad Gul & and Hizbullah on their turn
as PW-7, PW-8 and PW-9 respectively, in their
respective examination-in-cross have conceded
that they have no direct account of the event for
the reason that they are not eyewitnesses of the

occulTence.

10. Appellant/complainant on his turn
in the witness box as PW-7 did reveal facts of
the event but close perusal of his statement shall
reflect improvements in is statement to the effect
that “On 29.5.2016, I returned to the D.J.Khan
and found boxes in broken condition. I also
found missing my official Kalashnikov, 04
mobile phone, and Rs.1,50,000/. In this respect I
also recorded my supplementary statement,

wherein, I reported the same. Later on, I also
-6-
charged the accused facing trial namely, Junaid
for the commission of offence in my

supplementary statement.”

11. There is no second opinion at all
rather it is a settled maxim that when a witness
improves his version to strengthen the
prosecution case, his improved statement
cannot be relied upon as the witness has
improved his statement dishonestly, therefore,
his credibility becomes doubtful on the well-
known principle of criminal jurisprudence that
improvements once found deliberate and
dishonest cast serious doubt on the veracity of
such a witnesses. Reference in this respect may
be made to the case of "Farman Ahmad v.
Muhammad Inayat and others" (2007 SCMR

1825) wherein it was held as under:-

".... It is also a settled maxim
when a witness improves his
version to strengthen the
prosecution case, his improved
statement subsequently made
cannot be relied upon as_ the
witness had improved his
statement dishonestly, therefore,
his credibility becomes doubtful
on the well-known principle of
criminal jurisprudence that
improvements once found
deliberate and dishonest cast
serious doubt on the veracity of
such witnesses."
12. During investigation, from Call
Data Record (CDR) it surfaced that the
respondent/accused was using mobile phone of
the appellant/ complainant by installing his own
sim in it, therefore, he was arrested from
Karachi. The prosecution has not mentioned
any number of mobile phone of the appellant/
complainant which was allegedly recovered
from the respondent/accused. The appellant/
complainant stated in his examination-in-cross
that out of four mobile phones, highlighted by
him in his examination-in-chief, one was in use
of his son, the other was in the use of his
daughter and the remaining two mobile sets
were not in use of anyone. The prosecution
failed to produce a tangible evidence regarding
the ownership of mobile phone, so recovered
from the respondent/accused. Similarly, the
names of the marginal witnesses of the
recovery memo Ex.PW-5/6 in this regard, do
not figure in the list of witnesses and likewise
they could not have been highlighted in the
relevant calendar followed by have not been

produced before the Court.
13. The I.0 has taken into possession
the CDR data of the mobile of the respondent/
accused. It is not clear as to whether the
telephone/SIM number was in the name of the
respondent/accused or otherwise, as the same
fact has not been established through record.
Therefore, just by placing mobile data on the
record would hardly be of any advantage to the
prosecution. It is also to add here that the CDR
so furnished and relied by the prosecution was
neither attested nor signed by the competent/
issuing authority, nor credible witness was
either associated during the investigation nor
produced before the Court during the trial to
substantiate the same, therefore, reliance on the
subject CDR data in respect of mobile/sim
number of the respondent/accused would be
unwise and it would be appropriate as not to

rely upon such an evidence.

14. According to the pointation memo
Ex.PW-6/2, on 07.6.2016, recovery of weapon
of offence i.e. axe was effected on the
pointation of the respondent/accused from the

maize crop in the landed property of one
-9-
Abdur Rashid Dhap. PW-11, who is marginal
witness of pointation memo Ex.PW-6/2, stated
that during the search process in the fields,
accused, duly in handcuffs, was standing near
the police mobile. PW-6 is also marginal
witness of pointation memo Ex.PW-6/2. He
stated in his examination-in-cross that the axe
was recovered from the fields. He further
stated that four persons including him, the I.O,
one Aslam and the respondent/accused went
for the recovery of axe. It is not mentioned as
to whether the alleged recovered axe was
bloodstained or otherwise. Similarly, it was
also not sent to the FSL to substantiate that the
same is the weapon of offence and used in the
commission of crime. In absence of report of
Forensic Science Laboratory as it is matching
with the blood cannot be considered as the
corroborative piece of evidence against the
respondent/accused. Therefore, the prosecution
evidence as to recovery of axe to have been
used for the commission of offence is not
found sufficient enough to connect the
respondent/accused with the commission of the

offence.
-10-

15. The evidence of recoveries of
mobile phone, CDR and axe, the alleged
weapon of offence, being corroboratory in its
nature, is not capable to bring home charge
against the respondent/accused in the
circumstances where direct evidence is lacking
because it is well settled that unless direct or
substantive evidence is available conviction
cannot conviction cannot be recorded on the
basis of any other circumstantial evidence,
howsoever, convincing it may be. In the case
of “Saifullah Vs. The State” (1985 SCMR
410), it was held that when there is no
eyewitness to be relied upon, then there is
nothing which can be corroborated by the

recovery.

16. After cautious analysis of the
evidence on record and considering the pros
and cons so put forth by the learned counsel
for the parties, we have gathered that the
prosecution's entire case rests upon the
circumstantial evidence, whereas, substantive
evidence of high degree to be relied upon is

lacking. The unfortunate event of murder of a

-ll-
mother and daughter is a drastic and
unbearable trauma, having a stigmatic effect
upon all the family members in particular and
on the society in general. However, the Courts
have to decide the fate of a crime committed
by a felon on the basis of impeachable

evidence and not at the cost of emotions.

17. The circumstantial § evidence
requires to be appreciated on the dictum that in
such like matters, while appreciating the
evidence and holding an accused guilty of the
charge, the facts of the case must be consistent
with guilt of the accused, chain of evidence
must be complete in all respects leaving no
reasonable ground about the innocence of the
accused. The suspicious, however, strong,
cannot be given preference upon the proof. The
chain of events shall not break, which must be

conclusive beyond any shadow of a doubt.

18. It is well settled, benefit of doubt is
not a grace but right of the accused and it is not
necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating doubts, even a single

circumstance, creating reasonable doubt in a

= }2'.
prudent mind about the guilt of accused, makes
him entitled to its benefit, not as a matter of
grace & concession but as a matter of right.
Reference is made to the case "Muhammad

Akram y. State" (2009 SCMR 230).

19. Beside the above, generally the
order of acquittal cannot be interfered with
because the presumption of innocence of the
accused is further strengthened by acquittal. The
golden thread which runs through the web of
administration of justice in criminal cases is that
if two views are possible on the evidence
adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of
the accused and the other to his innocence, the
view which is favourable to the accused should
be adopted. The paramount consideration of the
Court is to ensure that miscarriage of justice is
prevented. A miscarriage of justice which may
arise from acquittal of the guilty is less than the
conviction of an innocent. In a case where
admissible evidence is ignored, a duty is cast
upon the appellate Court to re-appreciate the
evidence in a case where the accused has been
acquitted, or the purpose of ascertaining as to

whether the accused committed the offence or
-13-
not. The principle to be followed by this Court
considering the appeal against the judgment of
acquittal is, to interfere only when there are
compelling and substantial reasons for doing so.
If the impugned judgment is clearly
unreasonable, only then it is a compelling reason

for interference.

20. For the afore-stated reasons, learned
counsel representing the appellant/complainant
could not point out any illegality and material
irregularity in the impugned judgment so that the

Court could incline to interfere in it.

21. Resultantly, this appeal having no

merit and substance stands dismissed.

Announced.
