JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, _J.- This

appeal is directed against the judgment dated 18.05.2015,
rendered by learned Trial Court/ Additional Sessions
Judge-XII, Peshawar, whereby appellant Zeeshan has been
convicted and sentenced as under:-
Under section 324 PPC:- To undergo
imprisonment for 07 years and to pay a fine of
Rs.1,00,000/- or in default thereof to undergo
06 months S.I. further.
Under section 337-D PPC: To undergo
imprisonment for 05 years as Ta’azir and to
pay Arsh equal to one third of prevailing
Diyyat) to injured complainant within one
year from the date of judgment.
Benefit of S.382-B Cr.P.C. has been

extended to the appellant.

2. The prosecution case is that on the eventful
day, appellant-convict alongwith absconding co-accused
Aurangzeb as well as two unknown accused, duly armed
with firearms, attempted at the life of the complainant
Muhammad Jehangir and caused him firearm injuries on
ring road Kambo Adda Hayat Model School. Previous
blood feud has been alleged as motive behind the incident.
3. At the very outset during the course of
arguments, it transpired from the impugned judgment that
the learned Trial Court without formulating any charge
under section 337-D PPC, has also convicted and
sentenced the appellant-convict under the aforesaid section
of law. It is well settled principle of law that charge
against accused shall be specific, fair and clear in all
respects to provide an opportunity to the accused to defend
himself/herself in due course of trial. The charge shall be
clear and by no means, confused to prejudice the accused..
The charge must convey to the accused with sufficient
transparency and in clear terms what the prosecution
intends to prove against the accused. It shall contain all
essential details as to time, place as well as specific manner
of the alleged offence, the manner in which the offence
was committed with full description of the accusation so as

to afford the accused an opportunity to explain the

accusations with which he is confronted. Guidance in this
regard may be derived from S.A.K Rehmani’s case (2005
SCMR 364). Section 232 of the Cr.P.C. empowers the
appellate Court that in case it is found that on account of
omissions of particulars in framing charge, the accused has
been prejudiced and has not been provided an opportunity
of clear understanding of the charge to defend himself, it
may direct a fresh trial or even quash the conviction.
Section 232 Cr.P.C. speaks as under:-

“S.232. Effect of material error:- (1) If any
Appellate Court, or the High Court or [Court of
Session] in the exercise of power of revision or
its power under Chapter XVII, is of opinion
that any person convicted of an offence was
misled in his defence by the absence of a
charge by any error in the charge, it shall direct
a new trial to be held upon a charge framed in
whatever manner it thinks fit.

(2) Ifthe Court is of opinion that the facts of
the case are such that no valid charge could be
preferred against the accused in respect of the
facts proved, it shall quash the conviction”.

As per obligatory provisions contained in S.233 Cr.P.C. for
every distinct offence, a separate charge shall be framed in
order to enable the accused to defend the accusation
leveled against him. Section 233 Cr.P.C. runs as under:-
“S.233. Separate charges for distinct offences:
For every distinct offence of which any person
is accused there shall be a separate charge and
every such charge shall be tried separately,

except in the cases mentioned in sections 234,
235, 236 and 239 Cr.P.C.

S.235 Cr.P.C. provides a proper mechanism for trial of an
accused, charged for more than one offence, according to
which if, in one series of acts so connected together as to
form the same transaction, more offences than one are
committed by the same person, he may be charged with,
and tried at one trial for, every such offence. Sub-section
(2) of S.235 Cr.P.C. further clarifies the situation,
according to which if the alleged acts constitute an offence
falling within two or more separate definitions of any law
in force for the time being by which offences are defined
or punished, the person accused of them may be charged
with, and tried at one trial, for each of such offence.
Sub-section 3 of §.235 Cr.P.C. says that if several acts, of
which one or more than one would by itself or themselves
constitute an offence, constitute when combined a different
offence, the person accused of them may be charged with
and tried at one trial for, the offence constituted by such
acts when combined and for any offence constituted by any
one, or more, of such acts. The following illustrations shall
further clear the above provision of $.235 Cr.P.C.

A commits house-breaking by day with intent to

commit adultery, and commits in the house so

entered adultery with B’s wife. A may be

separately charged with, and convicted of,

offences under section 454 and 497 PPC.

A entices B, the wife of C, away from C, with

intent to commit adultery with B, and then
commits adultery with her. A may be separately

charged with, and convicted of, offences under
sections 498 and 497 PPC.

4. In view of the above discussed and law on
the subject referred above, I am of the considered view that
appellant has been prejudice in his defence by not
confronting him with the proper charge against him. When
confronted with the above legal situation, learned counsel
for the parties and AAG fairly and frankly conceded and
requested for remand of the case for trial denovo.
However, learned counsel for the appellant-convict
requested for release of the appellant on bail on the ground
that he is behind the bars from the last four year. Learned
counsel for the complainant and learned AAG opposed
release of the appellant on bail and requested for issuance
of direction to the learned Trial Court for conclusion of
trial within the shortest possible period.

5. In view of the above, the impugned
judgment dated 18.05.2015, is set-aside and the case is
remanded to the learned Trial Court for trial denovo right
from the stage of formulation of charge-sheet in light of
above observation and shall conclude the trial as early as
possible but not latter than two months from the date of
receipt of the record by proceeding with the same on day
to day basis. In case of adjournment on any reasonable and

plausible ground, its period shall not exceed three days. In

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

case of failure to conclude the trial within the specified
period, if delay was not on the part of the appellant or
anybody acting on his behalf he would be at liberty to file
application for bail before the learned Trial Court which
shall be disposed of independently. Office is directed to
send the record to the learned Trial Court within two days,
without fail.

6. Before parting with the judgment, I deem it
appropriate to mention here that this Court has observed
with great concern in plethora of cases that due to such like
legal errors and flaws in the trial the accused are
languishing in Jail for their no fault. It is the duty of the
learned Trial Court to keep vigilant eyes on each and every
proceedings conducting during trial. Formulation of charge
against an accused is the duty of the Trial Court, therefore,
it is the responsibility of the learned Trial Court to keep in
mind the relevant law on the subject discussed above
coupled with $.265-D Cr.P.C. at the time of formulating
charge against the accused so as to avoid future agonies
and injustice to the parties. Parties are directed to appear
before the learned Trial Court/ Additional Sessions judge-
XII, Peshawar on 25.01.2016.

7. The Additional Registrar (Judicial) of this

Court is directed to send copy of this judgment to the

learned Sessions Judges of each District of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa with the direction that they shall further
circulate its copy amongst the learned Judicial
Magistrates/Additional Sessions Judges of their concerned
District, for future guidance, with intimation to this Court.
