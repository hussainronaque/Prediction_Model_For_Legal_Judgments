SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- The appellants Javedullah &
Anwar Khan have called in question the judgment dated 31.07.2019,
rendered by learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, Bannu, whereby
the appellants Javedullah & Anwar Khan have been convicted under
section 302(b) P.P.C read with section 34 P.P.C and sentenced to

CrP.C has also been extended to the convicts.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on 17.08.2017 at about
19:50 hours, complainant Arab Khan alongwith dead body of his son
Abdullah reported the matter to the police at Civil Hospital, Bannu,
to the effect that on the eventful day, he alongwith his deceased son
were present outside their house; that at about 1915 hours, the
accused Javedullah & Anwar Khan duly armed with their respective
Kalashnikovs came there and at once started firing at them,
resultantly, his son got hit and fell down to the ground, while he
luckily escaped unhurt. After commission of the offence, both the
accused decamped from the spot. The complainant could do nothing
being empty handed. Motive for the occurrence was stated to be
previous blood feud between the parties.

On the report of complainant, Hidayatullah ASI (PW-8)
the then Incharge Casualty D.H.Q Hospital, Bannu drafted Murasila
EXPW-8/1, read over contents of the report to the complainant and
after admitting it correct, he thumb impressed the same. He prepared
injury sheet of the deceased and sent him to the doctor under the
escort of Constable Inam Ullah (PW-6). Murasila was transmitted to
the police station, where Khandan Khan ASI (PW-3) reduced report
of the complainant in the shape of F..R (EXPW-3/1).

After completion of investigation, prosecution submitted
complete challan against both the accused. After complying with the
provision under section 265-C Cr.P.C, the accused were charge
sheeted on 30.04.2018, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed

trial. The prosecution in order to prove its case produced and
-3-

examined as many as 14 witnesses, where after, the accused were
examined under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein they professed
innocence and false implication, however, they did not wish to be
examined on oath as provided under section 340(2) Cr.P.C, nor
opted to produce defence evidence. After hearing arguments from
both the sides, the learned trial Court vide impugned judgment dated
18.07.2019, convicted the accused and sentenced them, as
mentioned above. The convicts/ appellants filed the instant criminal
appeal against their conviction, while the complainant Arab Khan
has filed Criminal Revision, No.58-B of 2019 for enhancement of
sentence awarded to the appellants. Since both the matters are the
outcome of one and the same judgment, therefore, we intend to
dispose of the same through this common judgment.

3. The learned counsel for the parties alongwith Addl:
Advocate General representing the State were heard. at length and
with their valuable assistance the record was gone through.

4, The unfortunate incident claimed the life of a minor boy
aged about 13/14 years, which led to a charge against the appellants.
The report was made by the complainant who happens to be the
father of deceased. The tragedy occurred in front of the house of the
complainant at 07:15 p.m. and the matter was reported at 07:50 p.m.
to the casualty police of Civil Hospital, Bannu. The appellants were
arrested when they failed to get their bail before arrest confirmed.

5. It was after a full dress trial that the appellants were

convicted, which led them to this Court in an appeal against

|
i
|
-4-

conviction. Though, the matter was promptly reported, but this
Court is to see as to whether the incident occurred in the mode,
manner and at the stated time. True that complainant is the real
father and substitution is a rear phenomenon, but equally true that
the parties are involved in previous blood feud. The deadliest blood
feuds between the parties put on guard this Court, first to assess the
veracity of this witness, then to decide fate of the appellants in light
of the collected material and the produced evidence, so that
miscarriage of justice could be avoided. We cannot ignore that it
was the statement of a solitary eye witness which found favour with
the trial Court and in the like situation the Courts of law must
proceed with great care and caution, to avoid an unholy haste, which
leads to catastrophe and perpetuating injustice.

6. The deceased then injured soon after receiving firearm
injury was rushed to Civil Hospital, Bannu, where the events were
narrated to one Hidayat Ullah ASI, which led to the F.LR (ibid),
where after preparation of the injury sheet, the injured was produced
before the doctor for his medical examination. It was one Inam
Ullah, who escorted the injured to the doctor and handed over his
injury sheet. The doctor examined the injured at 07:50 pm and
prepared his medico-legal certificate.

7. The complainant was examined as PW-10, who stated
that at the time of incident he’ alongwith his deceased son was
present in front of his house, when all at once the accused appeared

duly armed, started firing at them, where he escaped unhurt, but his
-5-

son, Abdullah got injured. We cannot ignore that the parties are
locked in serious enmities, and that in that eventuality it was the
complainant who should be the prime target and not the son. It needs
appreciation that how the complainant escaped unhurt, despite the
fact that both the accused were fully loaded with sophisticated
weapons and he too was at their mercy. It is of prime importance to
mention that the investigating officer observed bullet marks on the
wall of his house just behind the complainant. Had the complainant
been present at the time of incident, the bullet instead of striking the
wall, lying. behind, would have landed on the complainant. The
complainant when appeared before the Court, stated that the
deceased was hurriedly shifted to the hospital to save his life, and
that PW Muhammad Niaz accompanied him to the hospital. We are
yet to know that why Muhammad Niaz did not verify the report
despite of his being present in the hospital. Though, the complainant
stated that at the time of report Muhammad Niaz was not by his side,
but he ignored that the injured was lying in the emergency room and
the matter was reported there, had PW Muhammad Niaz visited the
hospital, his presence would have been marked by the scribe, as he
did of the co-villagers. Both the witnesses i.e. the scribe to whom the
matter was reported and the doctor who examined the injured,
without hesitation confirmed that the injured was oriented in time
and space and was capable to talk. The scribe was asked, who
replied that the injured was capable to talk. The doctor who prepared

the medico-legal certificate, held that the injured was oriented in

-6-

time and space. If we admit that Muhammad Niaz was not in reach
at the time of report, what restrained the police official to ask
verification from the injured, as by then he was fully conscious. The
prosecution is still to answer, that why the complainant chose to
report instead of the injured, that too when the injured was fully
conscious, oriented in time and space and was declared capable to
talk. Comparing the two, we expect more honesty from the son than
the father, as the father had an axe to grind, whereas the son who
was hardly thirteen years, was alien to such influences, had he
reported, the Courts would feel less hesitation to accede. It was the
choice between the two to report, that burdened the prosecution to
do more. The scribe, who was examined as PW-8, stated that he
avoided the injured to report as he was minor, but never ever he
stated that he attempted to record his statement and that he could not
understand, as he was lacking maturity. In the situation at hand an
inference can be drawn that the complainant came forwarded with
twisted facts.

In case titled “Muhammad Javed Vs the State” (2020
SCMR 2116), it is held that:

“The deceased, in injured condition, was
medically examined at 7:15 p.m. under a
police docket carried by Aamir Mehmood
1112/C (PW-6); he was noted with an entry
wound on the right buttock; he was fully
conscious, well-oriented with stable vitals; it
is somewhat surprising that despite capacity,

he did not opt for a statement. Position taken

-7-

by the Investigating Officer that "As per
opinion of the doctor, the injured was not in a
condition to give statement" stands
contradicted by the observations recorded by
Dr. Faheem Khan, (PW-1) in MLR (Ex.PA).”

8. The witnesses failed to reconcile the time of incident, the
time of report and the time at which the injured was examined. The
complainant who appeared as PW-10, stated that it was 07:15 pm
when the incident occurred and that the matter was reported at 07:50
pm. The doctor was examined as PW-2, who stated that the injured
was produced before him at 07:50 pm. We are yet to know that how
the injured was examined at 07:50 pm, when the matter was not
reported by then. The scribe was examined as PW-8, who stated that
the incident was reported at 07:50 pm, it took 25 minutes to report
and prepare the injury sheet. In the like situation we cannot ignore
one PW Inam Ullah, who escorted the injured to the doctor
alongwith the injury sheet, who was examined as PW-6, who stated
that he produced the injured before the doctor at 20:20 hours. When
the statements of all the three are compared on this particular aspect
of the case, no other inference can be drawn but that the incident did
not occur at the stated time. This factor alone is sufficient for
holding that the complainant was not present with the deceased at
the time of incident.

9. The later entry of PW Muhammad Niaz further damaged
the case. The complainant at the time of report did not name
Muhammad Niaz to have seen the occurrence. When the

complainant was asked on this particular aspect of the case, he
-8-

replied that had Muhammad Niaz been present at the time of report,
he would have been named in the F.I.R, astonishingly, the
investigating officer stated that it was at the time of spot inspection
that Muhammad Niaz disclosed himself to be the eye witness.
Though, the site plan was prepared at the instance of the
complainant as well as the eye witness, but the abrupt appearance of
PW Muhammad Niaz tells another story.

10. It is pertinent to mention that the complainant and the eye
witness were found present at the spot when the investigating officer
reached there. The investigating officer was accompanied by few
police officials, where one of the marginal witness who was
produced as PW-12, he stated that he alongwith the investigating
officer reached to the place of incident within 20 minutes from the
Police Station after receiving copy of the F.I.R, whereas the
investigating officer stated that it consumed him one hour to reach to
the spot. The conduct of the witnesses and their presence on the spot
is not above board, as on one hand the deceased then injured was
lying before the doctor in sever condition to be treated, whereas on
the other the complainant and the eye witness had left the hospital
for the spot, despite the fact that they were not invited by the
investigating officer to reach there. We cannot ignore another aspect
of the case, that on the day of incident an F.LR bearing No.539 of
the even date was registered, where one Hamid Ullah was the
complainant, and the complainant of the present case i.e. Arab Khan

alongwith another, were the accused. Presumption could be drawn

-9-

that the complainant was not present at the time of report in the
hospital and so was his presence at the time of spot inspection, that
is the reason that PW Muhammad Niaz posed himself to be the eye
witness of the incident. PW Muhammad Niaz was not examined
rather the prosecution preferred to abandon him, the reasons
advanced for his non-production were stated to be his advanced age
and his mental disability to understand the proceedings. We are
anxious to know as to whether it was the learned counsel
representing the complainant to. determine the physical and mental
condition of the witness or that it was the trial Court to determine the
same. We are afraid to hold that it was the trial Court. Had PW
Muhammad Niaz been present at the time of incident he would have
been produced by the prosecution but his non-production takes us to
draw an inference that his appearance on the scene was nothing
more but a stopgap arrangement. Article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984, caters for the situation. In case titled, “Riaz

Ahmad Vs the State” (2010 SCMR 846), wherein it is held that:

“One of the eye-witnesses Manzoor Hussain
was available in the Court on 29-7-2002 but
the prosecution did not examine him,
declaring him as unnecessary witness without
realizing the fact that he was the most
important, only serving witness, being an eye-
witness of the occurrence. Therefore, his
evidence was the best piece of the evidence,
which the prosecution could have relied upon
for proving the case but for the reasons best

known, his evidence was withheld and he was

-10-

not examined. So a presumption under

Illustration (g) of Article 129 of Qanun-e-

Shahadat Order, 1984 can fairly be drawn

that had the eye-witness Manzoor Hussain

been examined in the Court his evidence

would have been unfavourable to the

prosecution.”
11. The investigating officer visited the spot and recovered
07 empties of 7.62 bore alongwith blood stained earth from the place
of the deceased. It is pertinent to mention that he also observed
bullet marks on the wall behind the complainant. The investigating
officer prepared the site plan on pointation of the witnesses with
specific points assigned to either side. The inter-se distance between
the complainant, the deceased and the assailants has been given as
40/45 paces and from such a long distance it was hard for the
accused to select the target, rather their prime target should have
been the complainant. The site plan belies the stance of the
complainant, had the complainant been present he would not have
escaped unhurt, as he was within the firing range of the accused.
This aspect of the case dispels the impression that the
accused/appellants were interested in killing the deceased, as the
motive was with the complainant. In case titled “Zahir Shah Vs the

State” (2019 MLD 1562), wherein it is held that:

“Admittedly, the deceased along with PW-1 to

PW-3 were standing closely and after making
indiscriminate firing there were no chances
of PWs to escape unhurt and also there was

every possibility that the deceased had

-ll-

received multiple bullet injuries, but the
picture is quite different from the
presumptions and expectations as suggests by
the situation, when the deceased had only
received two bullet injuries on his person,
while all the PWs were escaped unhurt.”

12. The empties were collected from the spot on 17.08.2017
and were received the Forensic Science Laboratory on 23.08.2017,
but the Investigating Officer could not explain the delay caused.
Neither the moharrir of the concerned Police Station was produced
nor the police official who took the same to the office of the
chemical examiner, what to say of collection of an abstract from the
register No.19, when such is the state of affairs we do not confirm
the evidentiary value of this piece of evidence and is as such
excluded of consideration.

13. Two persons are charged for a solitary injury on
person of the deceased and the prosecution is to answer that whose
fire shot proved fatal. Though joint enmity was alleged to both of the
appellants, but the prosecution could not collect the required
substance and even it failed to prove the shared intention between
the two. We cannot ignore that both the accused/ appellants were
shown armed with Kalashnikovs, but the recovery of only seven
empties from the place of incident negates the version of the
complainant, rather it tells of the involvement of a single accused,
had there been two accused the result would have been different

with greater recoveries from the spot.

-12-

14. The medical evidence does not support case of the
prosecution as the ocular account and the medical evidence are in
conflict with each other. The doctor, who examined the injured was
produced as PW-2, who stated that the deceased received a single
firearm injury on his right chest with its exit on the left side of lower
abdomen. The site plan depicts that the accused/appellants were at
points No.3 & 4, whereas the complainant and the deceased were
occupying points No. & 2, facing one another, in that eventuality
the deceased should have received the firearm entry wound on his
chest with its exit on his back, but the situation tells otherwise.
Another intriguing aspect of the case is, that the direction of the
wound is from above downwards which further negates the stance of
the complainant. This conflict between the two shakes the very
foundation of the prosecution case. True that the medical evidence is
confirmatory in nature and when direct ocular account is available
on file, then in that eventuality it is the ocular account which is to be
preferred and taken into consideration, provided it is confidence
inspiring, but in case in hand the presence of the witnesses at the
time and at the place of incident is shrouded in mystery, so the
conflict between the two cannot be ignored and it is for the

prosecution to prove otherwise. In case titled “Akhter Saleem and

another Vs the State and another” (2019 MLD 1107), it is held

that:

The above factors, material contradictions
between ocular and medical evidence create

serious doubts in the happening of alleged
-13-

occurrence and it is well settled law that even
a single doubt, if found reasonable, would
entitle the accused person to acquittal and

not a combination of several doubts.”

15. The learned counsel for the prosecution stressed time and
again that the accused/ appellants had strong motive to commit the
offence, but the prosecution could not establish the motive through
independent witnesses and from an independent source. Nothing was
brought on record in black & white, that what was the urging factor

for the accused/appellants to commit murder of the deceased, had it

been so, the complainant would have been the prime target. The
superior Courts of the country are consistent in their approach, that
when motive is alleged it was the prosecution to prove the same, if

the prosecution could not succeed then it is to reap the harvest. In

case titled “Muhammad Ashraf alias acchu Vs the State” (2019

SCMR 652), wherein it is held that:

“The motive is always a double-edged weapon.
The complainant Sultan Ahmad (PW9) has
admitted murder enmity between the parties
and has also given details of the same in his
statement recorded before the trial court. No
doubt, previous enmity can be a reason for the
appellant to commit the alleged crime, but it

can equally be a reason for the complainant

-14-

side to falsely implicate the appellant in this

case for previous grouse.”

16. It was agitated time and again that the accused/appellants
soon after the occurrence disappeared and surfaced after a long time,
which absence they failed to explain and this factor alone is
sufficient to term the accused guilty. We are unable to understand
that how in absence of positive and convincing evidence
abscondence alone can lead to conviction, if we accede to the
submissions so forwarded, we are afraid the results would be drastic.
There is no cavil to the proposition that abscondence alone cannot be
a substitute for the direct evidence and this aspect has been

beautifully dealt with by the apex Court in case titled, “Muhammad

Sadiq Vs the State” (2017 SCMR 144), wherein it is held that:

“The fact that the appellant absconded and was
not traceable for considerably long period of
time could also not be made sole basis for his
conviction when the other evidence of the
prosecution is doubtful as it is riddled with

contradictions.”
17. After evaluating the evidence available on file, this Court
reaches to an inescapable conclusion, that the prosecution could not

succeed in bringing home guilt against the accused/appellants

through confidence inspiring witnesses and that the witnesses failed

-15-

to establish their presence on the spot at the time of incident. The
learned trial Court failed to appreciate the evidence available on file
and did not apply its judicial mind to the facts and circumstances of
the case. The impugned judgment is devoid of reasons which calls
for interference, resultantly, the appeal in hand is allowed and the
appellants. are acquitted of the charges. They are to be released
forthwith if not required to be detained in connection with any other
criminal case. As the appeal filed by the appellants has succeeded,
so the connected Criminal Revision bearing No.58-B of 2019, has
become redundant, is dismissed as such.

Announced. Above are the detailed reasons.
