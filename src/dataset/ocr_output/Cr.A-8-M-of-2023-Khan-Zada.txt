JUDGMENT

Dr. Khurshid Iqbal, J.-

1. This criminal appeal u/s 24(a) of the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 2019 (KP CNSA read with
Section 410 of the Cr.PC), was filed by Khan Zada
and Imran Khan (appellants) against the judgment
of learned Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zila
Qazi/Model Criminal Trial Court, Malakand at
Batkhela, passed on 05.01.2023, whereby both the
appellants were convicted u/s.9(d) of the KP
CNSA, 2019 and sentenced each to suffer Tigorous
imprisonment for five years with imposition of

fine Rs.1,000,000/- (rupees Ten hundred

Bukht Sher Alt Khun/Steno* G.8) JON’BLE UT} JURSHI

Bie
thousand); in default of payment of fine, they, each
one of them was sentenced to further undergo six
months simple imprisonment. However, the
benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C was extended to

the appellants-accused.

2. Facts shortly are that on 28.07.2022,
Subidar Umar Wahid of PC Batkhela received spy
information about smuggling of narcotic
substances for the purpose of sale in huge quantity
by the appellants Khan Zada and Imran Khan from
the house (of Imran Khan) situated in Umar-Khel
Batkhela. On such information, he alongwith IHC
Muhammad Azam, Madad Moharir Abdul Hassan
and constable Iqrar Ali, rushed to the spot (they
mentioned as Kucha Umar-Khel) situated at near

the house of appellant Imran Khan. When they

reached there, they came across the appellants
at 17:20 hours. Imran Khan was found holding in
his right hand a blue plastic wrapper and Khan
Zada was having in his right hand a blue plastic
wrapper. They overpowered both of them,
recovered heroin from the plastic wrapper
Imran Khan was holding and chars from the

wrapper Khan Zada was having in his possession.

On weighing, the heroin was found as 2000 grams.
The chars were in four packets. When weighed,
packets No.1 to 4 were found to be 1266, 1253,
1268 and 736 grams, respectively (total 4523
grams). The Seizing Officer separated 10 grams
from the heroin and 10 grams each from the
packets of chars as representative samples for the
purpose of chemical analysis. He put the samples
and the remaining stuff of both the narcotic
substances in seven parcels and sealed each parcel
with monogram bearing UW. The Seizing Officer
recorded the report of the incident in the shape of a
Murasila (Ex:PA), which was converted into the
FIR (Ex:“A”) No.176 of 28.07.2022 u/s.9(d) of the
KP CNSA, 2019, registered in the Levy Post

Batkhela, District Malakand.

3. The final report of investigation
(challan) was put in the trial court. Copies were
supplied to the appellants in compliance with
section 265-C, Cr.P.C. Charge was framed against
them, to which, they pleaded not guilty and

claimed trial.

4, In order to bring home the guilt of

appellants, the prosecution examined as many as

Bakht Sher Afi KhaniSteno* (SB) [ON’BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr, KI HID IQBAL
05 PWs. In their examination u/s 342 Cr.PC, they
were also afforded an opportunity for evidence in
defence or their statements on oath in terms of
section 340(2), Cr.PC. They did not avail those
opportunities. After hearing arguments of the
learned DPP for the State, learned counsel for the
appellants, and perusal of the record, the learned
trial Court convicted the appellants and awarded
them the punishments referred to above vide

impugned judgment dated 05.01.2023.

5. Ms. Farhana Marwat, learned counsel
for appellant Imran Khan, and Mr. Ashfaq Ahmad
Afridi, learned counsel for appellant Khan Zada,
argued that the recovery was not proved beyond
reasonable shadow of doubt. They emphasized that
the one IHC Muhammad Azim Khan, an alleged
witness of the recovery was not examined. They
maintained that the aforesaid witness was not
present on the place of the incident as he was busy
in investigation of another narcotic case in which
he produced the accused before Judicial Magistrate

at the time when the present incident was reported

Bakki Sher All Khen/Steno* (3.B) JON’ BLE CE Dr, URS HEI iL
to have occurred. They also canvassed that the
house of the appellant Imran Khan was depicted in
the site plan but no evidence was collected to
prove him either owner or tenant of the house.
They argued that blue wrappers in which the
narcotic substances were found were not shown in
the recovery memo, nor were those produced.
They also stated that all PWs are levy officials,

as such, not independent witnesses.

6. Mr. Saeed Khan, learned AAG for the
State submitted that the narcotic substances in
question were recovered from the direct possession
of the appellants. The recovery was proved
reasonably. The prosecution successfully
established the chain of safe custody and
transmission of the narcotic substances. The
samples were sent for chemical examination within
the prescribe time. The FSL after examination
returned a positive report about both kinds of the
narcotics substances. The narcotic substances
recovered from the appellants were of huge

quantity.

7. Perusal of record reflects that Subidar
Umar Wahid and Abdul Hussain (the seizing
officer/ PW2 and one of the marginal witnesses of
the recovery memo/PW3) furnished evidence of
the recovery. The summary of their depositions is
that on 28.07.2022, pursuant to spy information,
they alongwith other levy officials, rushed to
Kucha Umar-Khel near the house of appellant
Imran Khan situated in Umar-Khel, Batkhela.
When the levy personnel reached near Shaheen
Kucha, they parked their vehicle there and entered
Kucha Umar Khel, where near the house of
appellant Imran Khan, they came across the
appellant Imran Khan and Khan Zada at 17:20
YZ hours. They found each appellant was having a
& blue plastic wrapper. They overpowered both of
them. They recovered heroin from the plastic
wrapper Imran Khan was holding and chars from
the wrapper Khan Zada was having in his
possession. On weighing, the heroin was found as
2000 grams. The chars found in packets No.1 to 4
were weighed to be 1266, 1253, 1268 and 736
grams, respectively (total 4523 grams). The
Seizing Officer separated 10 grams from the

heroin and 10 grams each from the packets of

Bakht Sher Ali KhanfSteno* (GB) )BLE MA. [USTIC!
chars as representative samples for the purpose of
chemical analysis. He put the samples and the
remaining staff of both the narcotic substances in
seven parcels and sealed each of them with
monogram bearing UW. The seizing officer
recorded the report of the incident in the shape of a
Murasila, prepared memo of the recovery
proceedings in the presence of Constable Abdul
Hussain (PW3) and IHC Azam Khan. He sent the
Murasila and the parcels containing the case
property to the Levy Post of Batkhela through
PW3 and IHC Muhammad Azim, where it was

converted into FIR.

8. Both PWs-2 and 3 were subjected to
considerable cross examination. They remained
steadfast in confirming the date, time and place of
the incident; the mode and manner of the recovery;
and the kind and quantum of the narcotic
substances. They fully confirmed that the incident
took place on 28.07.2022 at 17:20 hours, reported
the same day at 18:50 hours and in Kucha Umar
Khel in Batkhela. They also substantiated that the
recovery of heroin was made from appellant Imran
and of chars from appellant Khan Zada. PW2

supported the recovery by confirming that it was

Batht Sher Ali Khan/Steno* (8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL
carried out in his presence and that he put his
signature on the memos as one of its marginal
witnesses. However, certain aspects of their cross
examination need analysis. The Seizing Officer
was asked about the distance between the place of
incident and the levy post of Batkhela. He replied
that the aforesaid distance is about 2% kilometers.
He was further asked that in the Murasila he did
not mention the fact that the police vehicle was
parked in front of Kucha Shaheen and that there is
also no mention of Kucha Umar Khel. Perusal of
the Murasila would show that both the aforesaid
places were mentioned in the Murasila though
Kucha Umar Khel was mentioned in the head-note
and Kucha Shaheen mentioned in the main text.
During the arguments, learned counsel for the
appellants could not convince this court that it has
a substantial bearing on the case. There could be
no gainsaying the fact that the murasila has to be
read and evaluated in whole. One single sentence
couldn’t be packed and chosen in favour of one
party and to the detriment of the other. The fact
that both the appellants were apprehended in
Kucha Umar Khel and recoveries made from their
personal possession, is fully proved. The site plan

prepared at the instance of the Seizing Officer

Bakht Sher Ali KhenfSteno* (3.8) | ic URSHI
further supports the fact that the incident occurred
in Kucha Umar Khel. Another aspect, on which,
the Seizing Officer was questioned, was that the
residents of Kucha Umar Khel were frightened and
felt harassed. The Seizing Officer negated a
suggestion to this effect. Next, he was asked about
houses in Kucha Umar Khel, to which he replied
that there is a vacant house (Kandar in Pushto) of
Qazyan, which is adjacent to the house of
appellant Imran and to the South of both of them
was situated a vacant plot owned by Qazyan. He
was not crossed examined whether the residents of
Kucha Umar Khel were present at the time of the
occurrence, Though he admitted that there is no
information in the Murasila whether the appellant
Imran was the owner of the house or a tenant
therein. This court is of the view it was not
necessary. The reason simply is that the house of
the appellant Imran was not raided. In other words,
appellant Imran and Khan Zada were found inside
the Kucha and not inside the house. In this view of
the matter, there was no need to show that the
house adjacent to the vacant Kandar of Qazyan
was of the appellant Imran. It follows that the
proof about the ownership or rent deed in favour of

the appellant Imran would have been necessary

Bakht Sher All KhanfSteno" @.B) JON'BLE cl > KHURSHID I
10

had the levy personnel raided the aforesaid house
shown as that of Imran. The Seizing Officer in
reply to a question, also admitted that he did not
mention cash money and the cellphones in the
possession of the appellants. This aspect, too, was
not successfully canvassed as providing any
leverage to the appellants. Same is the position of
the fact that the Seizing Officer did not mention
the form of the Chars. However, he explained on
his own that it was in the form of slabs. He
categorically denied that the incident did not occur
at the place and time, and in the mode and manner

as he reported.

9. Coming to the cross examination of
PW3, it appears that his statement was recorded on
the spot, a path from the main road leads towards
the place of the incident, is situated at 250/300
paces from the main road and there was Abadi
inside Kucha Umar Khel. He was asked about the
house of appellant Imran. He replied that he had
not seen the house of Imran and even stated that
other levy personnel, too, had not seen it. As
already discussed above, the house of appellant
Imran has no impact on the merits of the case. On

further questions, he replied that there was no

Bathe Sher Alt BhenfSten0™ oy) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dz, KHURSHIO JOBAL
Il

private person present on the spot at the time of the
incident. He denied a suggestion that there is
considerable population near around the place of
the occurrence and that the residents were present

at that time.

10. Now the recovery from the
perspective of IHC Muhammad Azim Khan needs
to be examined. The prosecution version is that the
IHC Azim was amongst the levy personnel; he was
present at the time of the recovery, signed the
recovery memo as another marginal witness and
took, alongwith PW3, the case property and the
Murasila to the levy post. The prosecution did not
examine him as a witness. The defence developed
a plea during the cross examination of the Seizing
Officer (PW2) that on 28.07.2022, the date, on
which, the present case was registered, another
case bearing FIR No.176 was also registered
against a woman by the name Pari Begum, w/s.9(d)
of the KP CNSA. The Seizing Officer admitted
that in the aforesaid case FIR No.176, Azim was
Investigating Officer and, as such, busy in the
investigation right at the time while the incident in

the present case occurred. During the examination

Bakht Sher All Khan/Steno" (3.8) JON'BLE juste II
SN

12

of the appellant u/s. 342 Cr.P.C, the defence
produced attested photocopies of the FIR,
applications for medical examination of the
accused, recording his confessional statement and
the order of the Judicial Magistrate. The order
bears the time as 06:00 pm. The Seizing Officer
denied a suggestion that Azim was not present
with him at the place of the incident. He also
denied a suggestion that on 28.07.2022 at 19:00
hours, Azim had taken the woman accused to the

THQ Hospital, Batkhela.

11. As far as the production of the
accused before the Judicial Magistrate is
concemed, the time 06:00 pm mentioned therein is
not a part of the text of the order. Rather it has
been mentioned on the left margin of the page.
If, it is presumed to be correct, even then, it still
could not be believed. The reason is that the
Seizing Officer was asked about the distance
between the District Courts, the levy post Batkhela
and the place of the incident in the instant case.
In this respect, reference needs to be made to the
relevant portion of the cross examination of the

Seizing Officer:

12, The Murasila further supports this
version as it notes the distance between the place

of the incident and the levy post as two and half

kilometer.

13. Another key aspect of the case is the
safe shifting to, custody of the case property in the
Levy Post and safe transmission to the FSL for
chemical examination. PW2 testified that he, under
the supervision of Azim took the case property,
along with the Murasila, to the Levy Post, handed
them over to Moharrir Zakir Hussain (PW5). Next,
PWS testified that he received the case property
and the Murasila from PW2; the case property was
entered in Register No. 19. He further deposed that

the parcels containing the samples were given to

14

DFC Qaiser Khan (PW1) vide receipt rahdari
(of serial No. 105 from the Register No. 21). DFC
Qaiser Khan was examined as PW1. He fully
confirmed having received the case property, taken
it to the FSL vide the receipt rahdari, delivered it
in the FSL, where its receipt was acknowledged
and finally, he brought back the receipt to the Levy
Post. The FSL report bears the belt No. of PW1
and the date of the receipt of the samples as
29/07/2022. The samples were sent to the FSL
within the prescribed period of time and tested

positive for the heroin and chars.

14. While under cross examination, PW 5
was asked about the name of father appellant Khan
Zada as Mutabar Khan in Register No. 19. He
admitted that due his clerical mistake he entered
wrong name of father of the appellant. He then
spelt out the name correctly, stating that it is Atlas
Kha, not Mutabar Khan. He denied a suggestion
that the since case properties of many cases are
lying in the Levy Post, the levy personnel might
have used the case property of some other case as

the one in the present case. Similarly, PW1, under

Batht Sher Ali KheniSten0* 8) ON’BLE STICE I
SN

15
cross examination, told that he went to the FSL in
a passenger van (Coaster). He admitted that during
the journey, the passenger van stays at restaurants
for refreshments and prayers. But it was not
brought from him that the van he was travelling in,
did make a stay on the way. Even otherwise, the
distance between Batkhela and village Landakay
where the FSL is situated, is not that much which
necessitates a break in the journey. But even then,
a break in the journey would not necessarily means
an opportunity to tamper with the samples of the
case property. Indeed, PW1 denied a suggestion

that the van had broken its journey on the way.

15, THC Asghar Khan (PW4) conducted
investigation of the case. His testimony shows that
he inspected the place of the incident, prepared the
site plan at the behest of the Seizing Officer,
drafted application to the FSL, arrested the
appellants vide cards of arrests, interrogated the
appellants, obtained copies of extracts of Registers
Nos. 19 and 21, and examined the PWs under

section 161 Cr.PC, including particularly the DFC

De

16
Qaiser Khan who took the samples to the FSL. He
also placed on the record extracts from Register
No. 19 and copies of the daily dairy showing the
levy personnel’s times of departure from and
arrival back to the levy post. Though he was also
asked certain questions about the house of the
appellant Imran Khan, but this aspect has already
been discussed threadbare above. He refuted a
suggestion that he didn’t inspect the place of the
incident at all. He was also asked that more than
one path—in addition to the one shown in the site
plan—tleads to the place of the incident. This
aspect, too, was not successfully shown to have a
bearing on the main core of the prosecution case
that is the recovery of the narcotic substances from
the personal possession of the appellants. He also
refuted that during investigation, IHC Azim was

busy in investigation of another narcotic case.

16, Coming to the jurisprudence on the
narcotics cases now, it is now established law that
the narcotic substances’ chain of safe custody in

the Police Station and their safe transmission to the

Bekht Sher Ali KhaniSieao" (3.8) ON”! uj 1g
17
FSL for chemical analysis must be proved beyond
any reasonable shadow of doubt. Relevant cases

are:

Mst. Sakina Ramzan v. Haji__Nawaz_v,_ The
The State, (2021 State, (2020 SCMR
SCMR 451). 687).

Amjad Ali v. The  Fayaz_ and another _v.
State, (2012 SCMR The State, (2022

577) MLD 1452) [Sindh
(Hayaderabad Bench)]

Sajid Khan _v._ The
State, (2021 YLR

296) [Peshawar].

17, In the facts and circumstances of the
present case, however, the safe custody of the
narcotic substances in the Levy Post and their safe
transmission to the FSL was fully established. The
above referred cases, thus, could be of no help.
The defence counsels argued that private witnesses

were not associated with the recovery proceeding.

18. As far the argument that all PWs are
levy officials, it is now settled that police officials
are as good witnesses as any other. In Liaquat Ali
and another vs. The State (2022 SCMR 1097)
[Supreme Court of Pakistan], the Supreme Court

has observed:

Bukkt Sher Ali Khen/Steno* (3.B) ION’ ICE Dr. KHURSHID JOBAL
18

“This Court in a number of
judgments has held that testimony
of police officials is as good as any
other private witness unless it is
proved that they have animus
against the accused. However, no
such thing could be brought on
record by the petitioners in this
case. This Court has time and
again held that reluctance of
general public to become witnesses
in such like case has become
judicially recognized fact and there
is no way out to consider statement
of official as good witnesses, as no
legal bar or restriction has been
imposed in such regard. Police
officials are as good witnesses and
could be relied upon, if their
testimony remains un-shattered
during cross-examination.”

19. Similarly, in Rehmat Gul vs.
The State 2022 P.Cr.L.J 10 [Peshawar],

this Court was of the view that:

“No doubt, the PWs are police
officials but nothing in black &
white is available on file to show
their ill-will or enmity with the
appellant to falsely implicate him
in case.”

20. Another relevant case is of
Muhammad_Feaisal_vs. The State (2022
YLR 1163) [Sindh]. Its relevant paras read:

“13. [...] (a) That the arrest and
recovery was made on the spot and
the appellant was caught red
handed with the narcotics by the
police whose evidence fully
corroborates each other in all
material aspects as well as the
prosecution case. It is well-settled
by now that the evidence of a police

Bakht Sher Ali KhaniSteno* GB) M id [URSHID. iL
office wh
obfou) 23

19

witness is as reliable as any other
witness provided that no enmity
exists between them and_ the
accused and in this case no enmity
has been suggested against any of
the police PW’s and as such the
police had no reason to falsely
implicate the appellant in a false
case. Thus we believe the police
evidence which is corroborative in
all material aspects. In this reliance
is placed on Ijaz Ahmed v. The
State (2009 SCMR 99).

[.+.]

(h) That although no Independent
mashir was associated with the
arrest and recovery of the
appellant it has come in evidence
that no private person was
prepared to become an
independent mushir at the time of
arrest and recovery despite being
asked. Even otherwise section 103,
Cr.P.C. is excluded for offences
falling under the Control of
Narcotics Substances Act, 1997 by
virtue of section 25 of that Act. In
this respect reliance is placed on
the case of Muhammad Hanif v.
The State (2003 SCMR 1237).”

21. In view of the above reappraisal of
evidence, it is fully established that the prosecution
has proved the charge against the appellants-
accused by producing firm, reliable, cogent and
trustworthy evidence. Resultantly, the appeal in

hand stands dismissed being devoid of merits.
