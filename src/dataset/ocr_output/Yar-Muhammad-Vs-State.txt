JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- Through

the instant petition under section 561-A Cr.P.C., petitioner
Yar Muhammad seeks quashment of order dated
29.10.2015, passed by learned Judicial Magistrate-V,
Peshawar whereby allowing the application of the local
police, he order exhumation of dead body of Mst. Parkha
Bibi for postmortem examination and order dated
11.11.2015, passed by learned Sessions Judge-V,
Peshawar, whereby he maintained the order of learned
Judicial Magistrate by dismissing the revision petition of
the petitioner.

2. Arguments heard and record perused.

3. According to record, Mst. Parkha, was the
daughter of the petitioner, who met unnatural death due to
poisoning. Her LRs did not lodge any report before the

police as according to them the deceased herself committed

suicide, as such she was buried. The local police upon
information about the incident incorporated it in Daily
Diary No.06 dated 23.10.2015 under section 174/156 (3)
Cr.P.C. during which course, applied before the learned
Judicial Magistrate for exhumation of the dead body of the
deceased for the purpose of postmortem. The I.O. has not
collected any sort of evidence much less tangible to show
the death of the deceased to be a murder by someone by
administering poison to her. The statements of LRs of the
deceased have been recorded wherein they do not suspect
any person for murder of the deceased. Rather, as per their
statements prior to the incident the deceased had attempted
to commit suicide by adopting same exercise of taking
poison, but was luckily rescued in the hospital. Had there
been any solid evidence regarding the murder of the
deceased or any LRs charging any one for her murder, then
definitely, the situation would have been different. As
stated earlier, all the LRs of the deceased are unanimous
qua suicide of the deceased. The petitioner being father of
the deceased is the trustee of the grave of her deceased
daughter to keep it maintained not only the grave but
respect and dignity of the dead body also. Islam accords
great respect to the dead body of a Muslim. Exhumation

without any justification is a sin in Islam. Order of

exhumation must be based on detailed reasoning, logic and
fairness. I see no such reason to justify the exhumation of
the dead body of the decease.

4. In view of the above, both the courts below
have landed in the field of error and reached to a wrong
conclusion, therefore, this petition is allowed and the
impugned order of both the Courts below are hereby
quashed, resultantly, the application filed by the local
police for exhumation of dead body of the deceased
Mst. Parkha stands dismissed.
