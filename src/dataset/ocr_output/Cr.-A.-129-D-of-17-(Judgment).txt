Vs.

JUDGMENT
Date ofhearing: 27.06.2018.

Appellant: by: | Muhammad Mohsin Ali, Advocate.

Respondent: by: Haji Muhammad Shakeel,
Advocate,

State: by: Mr. Ilyas Ahmad Damani,
Advocate,

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- The petitioner, namely,
Muhammad Bilal, by filing this Criminal Appeal has
impugned the order dated 13.11.2017, passed by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-V, Dera Ismail
Khan, whereby the complaint filed under Section 3/4
of Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005, was dismissed.

2. Precisely, the facts giving rise to the
instant petition are that the petitioner filed a
complaint under Section 3/4 of the Illegal
Dispossession Act, 2005, against the respondent No.
1 to 3, alleging therein that he alongwith his brother

and sisters and mother are owners in possession of

-2-

the land in Khasra No. 696, 695 at Mouza Dewala,
Tehsil & District Dera Ismail Khan, prior to that
Karim Bakhsh predecessor-in-interest of the
petitioners was owner of the property in question
and after his death the property was inherited by
them. The house of the respondents lies towards
eastern side of the property in question. On
23.02.2011, the respondents attempted to affix a
door at western side of their wall upon which the
said Karim Bakhsh (now dead), moved an
application before SHO, police station Cantt;
DiKhan, whereon, the respondents were restrained
by the police. The respondents had purchased
adjacent property to subject property, where against
the petitioner filed a suit for possession through
exercise of right of pre-emption, which is subjudice
before the Apex Court. Again, after lapse of two
year, the respondents affixed the door. Feeling
aggrieved, the father of the petitioners moved an
application on 23.04.2013 to DPO DiKhan, which
was marked to SHO Cantt, but in vain. It was also
alleged that respondents No. 2 & 3 are police
officials, who prevailed upon the police department.
The respondents taking advantage of their position

demolished the walls of Kocha and encroached upon
-3-

a portion of disputed land by constructing a new
boundary wall. The matter was again reported to the
police by the father of the petitioner (now dead),
which was again reported to the SHO Police Station,
Cantt: but no fruitful result came out. Being
aggrieved mother of the petitioner moved an
application to the DPO, DIKhan for registration of
FIR against the respondent No. 1 to 3, but all her
efforts in this respect proved to be a wild goose
chase, which necessitated to file a complaint under
Section 22-A Cr.P.C., which was dismissed.
Therefore, the petitioner filed complaint under
Section 3/4 of Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005,
which too was dismissed by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-V, DIKhan vide order dated
13.11.2017, hence this petition.

3. It is argued by the learned counsel for
the petitioner that impugned order is illegal, without
lawful authority and without jurisdiction, that no
opportunity was given to the petitioner to prove their
case through evidence and the complaint was
dismissed summarily, which resulted in gross-
miscarriage of justice, therefore, warrants
interference; that specific allegation was levelled

that the respondents had illegally occupied the land

-4-

owned by the petitioner and recording of evidence
was necessary, hence an opportunity may be
afforded to the petitioner to prove his case and
prayed for setting aside the impugned order.

4. Conversely, the learned counsel for the
respondents argued that it is settled law that special
proceedings were to be conducted under Section 3/4
of Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005, and after receipt
of the complaint, the Court had referred the matter to
the SHO concerned for investigation, who then
submitted his report; that it was a matter of civil
nature i.e., dispute over path and no offence under
Section 3/4 of the Illegal Dispossession is made out,
therefore, the complaint was rightly dismissed
summarily; that no ground exist to proceed under the
special enactment, and prayed for dismissal of the
petition.

5. I have heard the learned counsel for the
parties and perused the impugned order as well as
the documents appended with appeal and the
relevant law.

6. In the private complaint, the petitioner
alleged that adjacent to the property in dispute, the
property of the respondents is shown to be on the

boundary line of Mauza Dewala and Mauza
-5-

Muryali. This property was possessed by the
respondents, against which father of the petitioner
filed a suit for possession through exercise of right
of pre-emption, which is now subjudice before the
August Supreme Court of Pakistan. However, till
today demarcation of the properties in question was
not carried out. Perusal of the last line of Para No. 2
of the complaint reveals that it was alleged by the
petitioner that the respondents have encroached
upon the property in question, the relevant portion of

the complaint is reproduced as under.

wee erL Serer, Pubes uidigete LL
The above allegation clearly indicates
that it is an encroachment rather than criminal
trespass or unlawful entry with the intention of
grabbing the land in dispute or of dispossession of
the appellant/complainant. Mere encroachment is
something different from Illegal Dispossession as
the former does not involve intentional grabbing of
the property, therefore, the element of mens rea is
missing in the instant case; therefore, I found that
necessary ingredient of offence under Section 3 of

the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 were not

-6-

disclosed through the complaint, therefore, it was
rightly dismissed by the learned trial Court. In this

respect reliance is placed on the case reported as

Wagar Ali and others _vs The State through
Prosecutor/AG (PLD 2011 SC 181), wherein it was
held as under:-

“$s, 3 & 5 ----Illegal dispossession---
Quashing of complaint---Word ‘Tajawaz’-
--Effect---Criminal or civil matter---
Distinction---Complaint filed against
accused persons was forwarded to police
for investigation, such assumption of
jurisdiction by Trial Court was assailed
but High Court declined to interfered in
the matter---Validity---Word ‘Tajawaz’
was used by complainant, which could
only be translated as ‘encroachment’
rather than criminal trespass or unlawful
entry with intention of grabbing disputed
land or of dispossessing complainant---
Complainant claimed to have become
aware of encroachment only after
demarcation made by revenue
functionaries---Various investigations
undertaken by police or by local
commissioner could only be treated as
prima facie evidence of a civil dispute
between the parties, which dispute was to
be decided by competent Civil or Revenue
Courts having jurisdiction in the matter---
Trial Court observed that mere
encroachment was something different
from illegal dispossession as the former
did not involve intentional grabbing of
property, however not finding element of
mens rea in complainant , Trial Court
travelled outside the complaint--- Trial
Court was required under Illegal
Dispossession Act, 2005, to act as a sieve
and to filter out those complaints which
did not disclosed requisite criminal intent-
-- Courts which were authorized to try
cases under Illegal Dispossession Act,
-7-

2005, had responsibility to see that
persons named in the complaint had case
to answer, before they were summoned to
face trial---In order for the Court to
exercise its jurisdiction by taking
cognizance, certain facts must first be held
to exist---Facts which constituted an
offence under Section 3 of Illegal
Dispossession Act, 2005, had to be evident
from complaint and documents filed in
support thereof---If necessary ingredients
of offence under Section 3 of Illegal
Dispossession Act, 2005, were not
disclosed through complaint and
accompanying documents, Trial Court was
not justified in exercising jurisdiction and
taking cognizance ---Judgment passed by
High Court and order passed by Trial
Court were set aside by Supreme Court
and complaint was dismissed --- Appeal
was allowed. [pp. 190, 191, 192, 195] F,
AK&N.”

7. It is important to note that earlier, father
of the petitioner had brought a complaint under
Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005, against the
respondents in respect of the same property, which
was dismissed by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-II, DIKhan, vide order dated 14.04.2010, and
order of the learned Additional Sessions Judge-II
was maintained by this Court vide order dated
03.12.2013.

8. For what has been discussed above, I
find no substance in the appeal in hand, therefore,

the same being bereft of merit is hereby dismissed.
