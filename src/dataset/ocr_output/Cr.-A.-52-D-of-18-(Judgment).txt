SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- This and the connected
Cr.A. No.52-D/2018, calls in question the judgment
dated 27.6.2018, passed by leamed Sessions
Judge/Judge Juvenile Court, Tank, whereby he acquitted
the accused-respondents in case FIR No.181 dated
11.4.2013, registered under Sections 302/109/34 PPC at
police station SMA, District Tank.

2. The prosecution story as disclosed in the
FIR, in brief, is that on 11.4.2013 at 1930 hours,
appellant-complainant Qaizar Khan (PW-8), made report
to Shah Nadir SI, Incharge Reporting Centre, DHQ
Hospital, Tank, to the effect that on the day of
occurrence, youngsters of the village were busy in
playing cricket match and he alongwith his brother Daud

Khan (PW-7) had gone there as spectators, where his
-2-

son Arsalan was also busy in playing cricket match; that
it was about 1745 hours, his son Arsalan exchanged hot
words with the accused-respondents Tariq and Aftab and
an altercation took place, during course of which they hit
son of the complainant on his head with bats at the
instigation of co-accused Hussain Ahmed and Said
Mehmood Khan; that when they rushed to the spot, the
accused had decamped to their houses; that when they
attended Arsalan, by then he was dead. On this report,
murasila Ex. PA/1 was drafted and sent to police station
where Muhammad Ayub ASI (PW-3) registered the case
against the respondents-accused vide FIR Ex. PA.

3. After completion of the usual investigation,
complete challan under Section 173, Cr.P.C. was
submitted in the trial Court against the respondents-
accused. After compliance of provisions of Section
265-C, Cr.P.C, charge was framed against the accused to
which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order
to prove its case, the prosecution examined as many as
nine witnesses. After closure of prosecution evidence,
the accused were examined under Section 342, Cr.P.C,
wherein, they denied the allegations and professed
innocence, however, they neither opted to be examined
on oath, nor produced evidence. The learned trial Court,
after hearing arguments from both the sides, acquitted

the accused-respondents of the charges vide impugned
-3-

judgment dated 27.6.2018, which has been assailed in
Cr.A. No.52-D/2018 & Cr.A.No.53-D/2018.

4. Arguments heard and record gone through.
5. It appears from the FIR that in the present
case, the occurrence took place on 11.4.2013 at 1745
hours, whereas the report was lodged on the same date at
about 1930 hours. Qaizar Khan (PW-8) is the
complainant of present case and he charged the
respondents alongwith co-accused Hussain Ahmed and
Said Mehmood Khan for committing murder of Arsalan,
son of the appellant. On the face of it, there is inordinate
delay of one hour and forty-five minutes in lodging the
report by the complainant. It is astonishing that when the
deceased succumbed to his injuries on the spot, then
what prevented the complainant to lodge the report in
police station, despite the fact that the distance of police
station from the place of occurrence is mentioned as
10/11 kilometers, whereas police station SMA is situated
on the way to hospital. It creates serious doubt in the
prosecution story that why the report was not lodged at
police station. Needless to say that the delay in lodging
the report cannot simply be brushed aside, as it has
assumed great significance, and it could be attributed to
consultations, taking instructions and calculatedly
preparing the report keeping in view the names of the

assailants opened for involving such persons who

-4-

ultimately the prosecution might wished to nominate. In

this respect, reliance is placed on case law reported in

(AIR 1983 _S.C.-810) titled "Ranji Suriya and another
Vs. The State of Maharashtra’, 'Allahyar_ Vs. The
State' (1990 SCMR-1134), "Mahmood Ahmad and 3
others Vs. The State and another’ (1995 SCMR-127),
‘Imran Hussain Vs. Amir Arshad and 2 others' (1997
SCMR-438) and ‘Muhammad Rafique Vs. The State’
(2014 SCMR-1698).

6. It is the case of prosecution that on the day
of occurrence, youngsters of the village were busy in
playing cricket match on threshing floor of one Gulbat
Khan and complainant Qaizar Khan (PW-8) and his
brother Daud Khan (PW-7) were present there as
spectators, where his son Arsalan alongwith other boys
were playing a cricket match. It was about 1745 hours
that his son Arsalan exchanged hot words with the
accused-respondents Tariq and Aftab and an altercation
took place, during course of which they hit son of the
complainant on his head with bats at the instigation of
co-accused Hussain Ahmed and Said Mehmood Khan,
which resulted into the death of Arsalan son of
complainant-appellant. In the present case, the ocular
account has been furnished by Daud Khan PW-7 (uncle
of the deceased) and Qazar Khan complainant PW-8

(father of the deceased), PW-7 deposed that he reached

-5-

to the spot at 5:45 p., which is the time of occurrence as
mentioned in the FIR. This version of the PW is
improbable and his presence on the spot at the relevant
time is highly doubtful. He admitted during cross-
examination that accused Aftab was present towards
eastern side of the deceased, whereas PW-8 negated the
version of PW-7 by stating that accused Aftab was
towards southern side of the deceased. PW-7 further
stated in cross-examination that besides the complainant,
Afsar, Wali Zar and 15/20 other spectators were present
at the time of occurrence and after the occurrence PW
Wali Zar arranged the datsun from nearby Adda, but
said Wali Zar has not been cited as witness or for that
matter no one among the spectators was cited as witness
of the occurrence. It is quite natural that when minor
children are fighting with each, their father or any other
blood relative would take all possible rescue steps, but
here in the present case despite alleged presence of
PW-7 and PW-8, who happened to be uncle and father
of the deceased, they remained as silent spectators
without any attempt to save their kid (deceased).
Moreover, PW-7 further stated in cross-examination that
on the following day at about 08:00 a.m, the dead body
of the deceased was handed over to them in the hospital,
whereafter, they proceeded to their village, but PW-8

negated his testimony by stating in his cross-
-6-

examination that after receiving the dead body from the
hospital, they reached to their village at 08:00 a.m.
Moreover, PW-7 also admitted that he had not signed
the report as rider of the same. It creates serious doubt
regarding his presence on the spot at the time of
occurrence. Similarly, PW-8 deposed that no blood
stained earth was recovered from the spot. He further
deposed that the Investigating Officer only prepared the
site plan on the spot. He stated that while shifting the
dead body, they straightaway proceeded to DHQ
Hospital via Chasan Katch road via Tank-Wana Road
and bypassed PS SMA, Tank. PW-8 stated that the
police party came to their village on the following day at
about 09:00/10:00 a.m. PW-9 Mazmir Khan SI belied
his statement by stating that the complainant PW-8 came
to the spot at 07:45 a.m. PW-9 admitted during cross
examination that bat was not recovered from the
accused. In view of above glaring infirmities surfacing
in the prosecution story, particularly in the statement of
alleged eyewitnesses, their presence on the spot at the
time of occurrence was highly doubtful, therefore, it was
rightly disbelieved by the learned trial Court.

7. There is no two opinion about the fact that
the cardinal principle of justice always laid emphasis on
the quality of evidence which must be of first degree and

sufficient enough to dispel the apprehension of the Court
-7-

with regard to the implication of innocent persons
alongwith guilty one by the prosecution, otherwise, the
golden principle of justice would come into play that
even a single doubt if found reasonable would be
sufficient to acquit the accused, giving him/them benefit
of doubt because bundle of doubts are not required to
extend the legal benefit to the accused. In this regard,
reliance is placed on a view held by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of "Riaz Masih alias Mithoo

Vs. State (NLR 1995 Cr.SC 694).

8. In the case reported as Bagh Ali Vs. State
(PLD_1973_ S.C. 321), it was observed that the
appraisement of the evidence of eyewitnesses has to be
based upon a full consideration and evaluation of all the
circumstances appearing in the case where there is fatal
absence of physical circumstances to connect the
accused person with the crime and there is a motive and
in such a situation, the ocular evidence must, in order to
carry conviction on a capital charge, come from un-
impeachable source and if such source is not available,
then it must be supported by some strong circumstance
which would enable the court to overcome the inherent
doubt which such evidence must necessarily create.

9. Regarding the golden principle of benefit
of doubt, reference can be made to the celebrated

judgment of the apex Court title "Muhammad Luqman
-8-

Vs. The State (1970 PLD S.C.-10), where the Hon'ble

Bench have observed that:-

"It may be said that a finding of guilt
against an accused person cannot be
based merely on the high probabilities
that may be inferred from evidence in a
given case. The finding as regards his
guilt should be rested surely and firmly
on the evidence produced in the case and
the plain inferences of guilt that may
irresistibly be drawn from that evidence.
Mere conjectures and probabilities cannot
take the place of proof. If a case where to
be decided merely on high probabilities
regarding the existence of non-existence
of a fact to prove the guilt of a person, the
golden rule of "benefit of doubt" to an
accused person, which has been a
dominant feature of the administration of
criminal justice in this country with the
consistent approval of the superior
Courts, will be reduced to a naught”.

The dicta laid down in the above precedent

has been re-enforced by the august Supreme Court in the

cases of Tariq Parvez Vs. The State (1995 SCMR-
1345), Muhammad Khan and another Vs. The State
(1999 SCMR-1220) and Muhammad Akram Ys. The

State (2009 SCMR-230).
10. In the case of "“Mst. Jallan_ Vs.

Muhammad Riaz and other" (P_L_D 2003 S.C.-644),

it was observed by the august Supreme Court that:-

"Once an accused had earned acquittal in
his favour, he enjoyed double presumption
of innocence and the Court while
examining the case of such accused must be
very careful and cautious in interfering with
the acquittal order and normally should not
set aside the same merely for the reason
that some other view was also possible---
-9-

interference, however, could be made in
exercise of powers conferred upon the
Court under S.417, Cr.P.C., if it was proved
that the Court whose judgment was under
scrutiny had misread such evidence”.

Reference can also be made to the recent

case law reported in 2017 SCMR-1639 ‘Muhammad

Zafar and another Vs. Rustam Ali and others’ and

4alar ane ae ee ee

2017 SCMR 1710 ‘Mst. Anwar Begum Vs. Akhtar

Hussain alias Kaka and 2 others’, wherein similar

view was expressed.

11. It is now settled that standard of assessing
evidence in appeal against acquittal are quite different
from those laid down from appeal against conviction.
There is a marked difference between appraisement of
evidence in the appeal against conviction and in the
appeal against acquittal. In the appeal against conviction,
appraisal of evidence is done strictly and in appeal
against acquittal, the same rigid method of appraisement
is not to be applied as there is already finding of
acquittal given by the trial Court after proper analysis of
evidence on record. In the appeal against acquittal,
interference is made only when it appears that there has
been gross misreading of evidence which amounts to
miscarriage of justice. The ordinary scope of appeal
against acquittal of accused-respondents is considered
narrow and limited, as held by the august Supreme Court

of Pakistan, in a chain of consistent judgments. In this
NS

-10-

behalf, reference may be made to the cases, reported as

Muhammad Usman and 2 others Vs. The State (1992
SCMR 498) and The State Vs. Muhammad Sharif
and others (1995 SCMR 635).

12. For what has been discussed above, we are
of the firm view that the trial Court has rightly extended
the benefit of doubt to the accused on valid and cogent
reasons by correctly appreciating the evidence on record
and acquittal of the accused-respondents does not call
for any interference by this Court, therefore, the
judgment dated 27.6.2018, passed by learned Sessions
Judge/Judge Juvenile Court, Tank, is upheld.
Consequently, both the appeals, being devoid of merits,

are hereby dismissed in limine.
