MOHAMMAD _IBRAHIM_KHAN, _CJ.-

Through this appeal, the appellant/ respondent
has called in question the order of the learned
Judge Consumer Protection Court, Peshawar
dated 22.11.2021 whereby, while dismissing
the objection petition of the appellant
/respondent, the complaint of the respondent
No. 1/complainant has been termed
maintainable.

2. Facts of the case are that the
respondent No.1/complainant filed a complaint
under section 13 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Consumer Protection Act, 1997 with the

allegations that his mother was infected with
corona virus (Covid-19), which resulted into
adverse impact on her nose and chick hence,
respondent No. 1/ complainant approached the
appellant for medical treatment of his mother
where she was examined and referred for
undergoing CT scan. Thereafter, the patient was
advised surgery to be conducted in LRH,
Peshawar on 28.06.2021 however, when the
respondent No.1 took his mother to the LRH,
the appellant refused to undergo surgery there
and directed him to approach his clinic. When
the respondent No. 1 attended the clinic of
appellant, he was directed to deposit Rs.
3,00,000/- (rupees three lacs) for surgery
despite the fact that LRH is an international
standard hospital having all operation facilities,
as a result of which the respondent No. 1 not
only suffered physical hardships but mental
torture due to the unethical and unprofessional
attitude of the appellant/respondent. Having no
other option, the respondent No.1/ complainant
approached Saidu Sharif Medical Complex for
medial treatment of her mother hence, the

present complaint.
3. The appellant / respondent
appeared before the court and hotly contested
the complaint of the complainant by filing reply
wherein, legal and factual objections have been
raised. He also filed an application for dismissal
of complaint, which was replied by the
respondent No.1/complainant. The learned
Consumer Protection Court, Peshawar after
hearing arguments on the application for
dismissal of complainant, dismissed the same
through an order dated 22.11.2021 hence, this
appeal.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for
the parties heard in detail and record with their
valuable assistance gone through.

5. Learned counsel for appellant
placed reliance on the judgment cited as PLD
2019 Lahore 429 Dr. Riaz Qadeer Khan vs
Presiding Officer, District Consumer Court,
Sargodha and others and prayed for acceptance
of this appeal. Inversely, learned counsel for
respondent NO. | placed reliance on PLD 2013
Peshawar _9 Neelab CNG Filling Station

through Managing Director vs Managing
Director, SUI Northern Gas Pipeline Lid & 4
others and prayed for dismissal of this appeal.

6. Perusal of record transpires that
the mother of the respondent No.1/complainant
at first instance was admitted in DHQ Hospital
Dager, Buner and she, being the patient of
Corona virus, was referred to Lady Reading
Hospital, Peshawar on 26.05.2021 and on the
same date, she was admitted in Covid ward
LRH, Peshawar. Thereafter, due to positive
Covid, there was adverse impact on nose and
chick of mother of the respondent
No.1/complainant hence, the ENT doctors were
consulted who conducted CT scan and the
mother of the respondent No.1/complainant was
advised for undergoing surgery for debridement
and biopsy however, on 16.06.2021, the
respondent No.1/complainant left the hospital at
their own. It is also on record that on
25.06.2021, the respondent No.1/ complainant
visited alongwith his mother to private clinic of
the appellant however, she being the patient of
positive Covid, was again referred to LRH for

proper treatment. The whole record is silent
Ww

that the appellant has examined or conducted
any surgery of the mother of the respondent
No.1/complainant except the medical
prescription dated 25.06.2021 whereby, the
appellant has examined the mother of the
respondent No. 1/complainant. The whole
record transpires that the mother of the
respondent No. 1/complainant has throughout
been examined at Lady Reading Hospital,
Peshawar.

7. Turning to another aspect of the
case whether the Consumer Protection Court is
the appropriate forum to determine whether
medical malpractice or negligence has
occurred, it is well accepted that for a claim for
medical/clinical negligence to be established, a
medical practitioner has to be found to have
breached a duty of care to a patient, who in turn
suffers injury as a result of that breach.
Demonstrating that a doctor has breached the
duty of care is the first major hurdle in any
negligence case but this is not always clear cut.
There is certainly scope for genuine differences

of opinion when it comes to diagnosis and
treatment. The complainant’s contention is that
the Consumer Protection Court lacks the
jurisdiction and it is the Commission that is to
make an assessment in that regard in view of
the standards envisaged under section 13 of the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Health Care Commission
Act, 2015. Needless to say, liability claims for
defective services, as envisaged under Section
13 of the Act ibid, would similarly entail a
breach of a duty to be determined by the

commission under section 13, it reads:

“13 Complaints---(1) An aggrieved
person may, within sixty days from
the date of knowledge of the cause of
action, file a complaint against a
healthcare service provider or
healthcare establishment by
submitting an application in writing
supported by an affidavit national
identity card number and address of

the aggrieved person.
Reliance in this respect is placed on PLD 2019
Lahore 429 Dr. Riaz Qadeer Khan vs
Presiding Officer, District Consumer Court,

Sargodha and others, the relevant is:

“For what has been discussed above,

we are persuaded to hold that
Healthcare Commission is the only
competent forum to investigate into
the allegations of maladministration
or malpractice by a health service
provided and the consumer court has
no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon
such matters. Resultantly, all these
writ petitions are allowed and the
complaints pending before the
learned consumer court are directed
to be returned for its presentation

before the appropriate forum.
8. In view of the above provision of
law, the respondent No.1/complainant has not
filed. any complaint rather approached the
Consumer Protection Court, which has no
jurisdiction to try such like complaints. Apart
from above, Section 19 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Health Care Commission Act,
2015 has given immunity to the private health

care establishment, it reads:

“19 Immunity--- No suit,

prosecution or other legal
proceedings related to provision of
private health care services shall lie
against a health care establishment

except under this act.”
Even otherwise, in view of the observations
penned in the order of the learned Consumer
Protection Court dated 22.11.2021 whereby,
this complaint before the said court was
maintained it is found that the respondent
No.1/complainant has not been deprived of any
exorbitant fee and even no surgery has been
performed by the appellant and at all no offence
or wrong has been committed by the appellant
hence, in these circumstances, the order of the
learned Judge, Consumer Protection Court is
not maintainable.

9. In view of the above observations,
this appeal is allowed whereby, the complaint
filed by the respondent No. 1/complainant

before the learned Consumer Protection Court

stands dismissed. vw
