Muhammad Islam preferred an application for
Nawab

the grant of his post arrest bail before the Court
of learned Sessions Judge/Zila Qazi Malakand
at Batkhela, who vide the order dated
03.02.2017 dismissed the same. In addition to,
through the said impugned order

law Mst. Naila also received injuries on the
fingers of her right hand. The motive behind the
occurrence is stated to be a dispute over the
landed property. In addition to the complainant-
party, the occurrence might have been

witnessed by some other people.

4. Having heard arguments of learned
counsel for parties and learned A.A.G. for the
State, the record gone through with their able

assistance.

5. Learned counsel for the Petitioner

relied on 2012 YER 2853 (Peshawar) “
Isfandyar_yvs_the State through Additional

Advocate _General_and_another”, PLJ 2012
Cr.C__(Lahore) 901 (Bahawalpur _Bench

“ Zamin Shah ys the State and another”, 2012

Additional Sessions Judge and another”, PLD
2009 Lahore 312 “ Ali_ Muhammad _vs_the
state”. In the light of these dictums of the
Hon’ble superior Courts prayed for the grant of
bail. Inversely learned counsel for the
complainant supported by learned A.A.G

referred to 1999 P Cr.L J 1677 (Peshawar) “

Babar _Khan_and_ another _vs_the State and
another”, 2005 YER 1215 (Karachi) “

2009 P Cr. L J 251 (Lahore) “ Muhammad
Igbal vs the State and vehemently opposed the
grant of bail as an innocent old aged lady has

been severely injured on vital parts of her body.
Nawab

6. Indeed on tentative assessment it
has been found that  accused/Petitioner
Muhammad Islam has been given the role to
have inflicted severe injuries upon the person of
Mst. Hameeda Bibi on her head and other parts
of her body. The injuries have been termed to be
grievous in nature. The act of causing injuries
upon the person of an old aged lady Mst.
Hameeda Bibi was so brutal that she was later
on admitted in the Lady Reading Hospital
(LRH) Peshawar for treatment and due to such
injuries the healing process is still underway
and may take a lot of time in recovery being a
known diabetic patient. This matter is not a
simple case of hurt as the allegations against the
accused/Petitioner are that he at the time of
commission of this crime was saddled to
commit ‘qgatl-e-amd’ and may be after such

injuries would have resulted likely.

7. As far as  accused/Respondent
Hamza is concerned, he has been given the role
of causing injuries upon the persons of injured-

complainant Tariq Ameen and Mst. Naheela
Nawab

Bibi, which are admittedly simple in nature and
the impugned order passed by the learned
Sessions Judge/Zila Qazi Malakand at Batkhela
is in utter appreciation of his role requiring
further probe. Thus the impugned order has
decorously been passed which calls for no

interference.

8. In view of what has been discussed
above, both these connected petitions being

shorn of merits shall stand dismissed.

9. This Court is however considering
an absolute right of each accused involved in
such like offences to conclude his/their trial
within the shortest possible period. It is as learnt
that the case has been put in Court on
07.02.2017. Thus the learned trial Court shall
by all means conclude the trial within a period
of six (6) months positively, failing which
having no objection on the part of learned
counsel for the complainant the
accused/Petitioner would be entitled to the

concession of bail subject to his furnishing bail
Nawab

bonds in the sum of Rs. 200,000/- (two lacs)
with two sureties each in the like amount to the

satisfaction of learned trial Court.

10. Before parting with this judgment, it
is pertinent to mention’ here that
Applicant/Petitioner has moved an application
No. 51-M of 2017 for correction of his name
which was inadvertently written as Muhammad
Islam instead of Islam Muhammad. Since the
mistake is apparently typographical one
therefore, this Cr.M is allowed and name of the
accused/Petitioner be read as "Islam

Muhammad" instead of Muhammad Islam.
