SYED MUHAMMAD ATTIQUE SHAH, J.- Indicted on a

murder charge, appellant, Riaz Ahmad, at a trial held by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-III Mansehra, was found
guilty for the crime and upon conviction has been
sentenced to imprisonment for life with a fine of
Rs.5,00,000/- as compensation under Section 544-A
Cr.P.C, payable to the legal heirs of deceased or in default
thereof to suffer further six (06) months S.I with benefit of
Section 382-B Cr.P.C.

2. The epitome of this tragic incident, as spelt out
from the FIR (Ex.PA), is that initially vide Mad No. 10
dated 20.02.2009 (Ex.PW-10/1) the complainant Mst. Bibi

Ayesha (PW-10) in the company of her brother-in-law
namely, Deedar (PW-11) reported to the local police of

Police Station Sarokalay District Charsadda at 10:00 hours

to the effect that her daughter Mst. Razmina (deceased)

was married to Muhammad Riaz (the convict-appellant)

some six (06) years back and both the couples were

happily living their marital life, rather her daughter was in

good visiting terms with them, however, after a year her

husband (the convict-appellant) left for Kuwait to earn his

livelihood and when he returned back to his country after

three (03) years, he blamed her daughter that she was

having illicit relation with one Wahid s/o Khiyal

Muhammad with whom she was also stigmatized to have

taken photographs as well, thus, their relations became

strained and thereafter she was stopped from visiting her

(the complainant) house. She further narrated in the FIR

that ten (10) days ago, Mst. Naz Gul, sister of the convict-

appellant, informed her that Mst. Zarmina (her daughter)

was killed by her brother and thrown the dead body in the

well, thus, she charged the convict-appellant alongwith his
brother namely, Jawad and mother Mst. Nasreen for

commission of the offence. PW Deedar also verified report

of the complainant (Mst. Bibi Ayesha), whereafter it was

sent to the Police Station City Mansehra through Deedar,

which was incorporated there vide Daily Diary No. 46

dated 22.02.2009, thus, enquiry was launched under

Section 156 (3) Cr.P.C and the matter was entrusted to

Naik Muhammad, ASI, as a result whereof, he recovered

the dead body of deceased Mst. Razmina from a well in the

house of Malik Aman at Lalazar Colony Thakra, hence,

the FIR was registered accordingly on 23.02.2009.

3. After completion of the investigation, complete

challan was submitted against the convict-appellant and

acquitted co-accused (Jawad) before the learned trial

Judge, who were formally charge sheeted, to which they

pleaded not guilty and claimed trial while the absconding

co-accused (Mst. Nasreen) was proceeded against under

Section 512 Cr.P.C. However, in order to prove its case at
the trial, the prosecution examined as many as fifteen (15)

witnesses in all.

4. After close of the prosecution evidence, statements

of the convict-appellant (Riaz Ahmad) and acquitted co-

accused (Jawad) were recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C,

wherein they denied the allegations leveled against them.

However, they neither opted to be examined on oath under

section 340 (2) Cr.P.C nor wished to produce defence

evidence, thus, the trial culminated into acquittal of the co-

accused (Jawad) and conviction of the present appellant,

who was sentenced as above, hence, the present appeal.

5. We have heard the arguments of learned counsel for

the parties as well as the learned AAG and gone through

the record with their valuable assistance.

6. Perusal of the FIR (Ex.PA) reveals that the

occurrence took place some forty five (45) days prior to

the lodging of first information report and Mst. Bibi

Ayesha (PW-10) is the complainant of the present case,

who has charged the appellant alongwith the acquitted co-
accused (Jawad) and absconding co-accused (Mst.

Nasreen) for the murder of her daughter (Mst. Razmina)

with a motive behind the offence, which was her alleged

illicit relation with one Wahid, with whom she had also

taken photographs. The occurrence is an unseen one

because according to the complainant she was informed on

telephone by Mst. Naz Gul, sister of the convict-appellant

about the incident but the latter was not examined in order

to support the case of prosecution.

7. Though there are number of witnesses in this case

but most of them are police officials, thus, the most

noteworthy piece of evidence in this case is the testimony

of complainant (PW-10), who lodged the report, Deedar

(PW-11), who identified the dead body of deceased, lady

doctor Aalia (PW-6) who conducted autopsy, Muhammad

Suleman (PW-4) who given the house on rent to the

convict-appellant, Muhammad Asif Khan (PW-2), in

whose presence the convict took the police party to the

place of occurrence wherefrom the crime weapon was
taken into possession, Naik Muhammad (PW-13), who

conducted enquiry under Section 156 (3) Cr.P.C and

Jehanzeb Khan (PW-15), who was entrusted with the

investigation of the case, gist of which is required to be

discussed.

8. First of all we would discuss the statement of

Muhammad Asif (PW-2), who is marginal witness to the

recovery memos Ex.PW-2/1 and Ex.PW-2/2. He stated that

by profession he is a retired police officer and in his

presence the convict-appellant led the police party to the

house of one Malik Aman and presented a pistol (crime

weapon) to the police, whereafter he himself pointed out

the we// in which the dead body of the deceased was

thrown. However, during the course of cross-examination

he deposed that he did not know that when and where the

dead body of the deceased was recovered as he was not

present there at the time of discovery of the dead body

while, on the other hand, he admitted as correct that he was

witness to the recovery memo of discovery of deceased’s
dead body and recovery of weapon of offence. He further

stated in his cross-examination that it is correct that the

house, wherefrom the weapon of offence recovered, was

abandoned one and he does not know that the said house

was belonged to whom, thus, his testimony cannot be

relied upon, being inconsistent.

9. Appearing as PW-4, Muhammad Suleman, stated

that the house situated at Lalazar Colony (where the

occurrence took place) is the ownership of his brother

(Malik Aman), who advised him to give the same on rent

to any body and on 05.09.2009 he handed over the same on

rent to convict-appellant in lieu of Rs.2000/- per month,

however, during the course of cross-examination he

admitted as correct that he was having no knowledge about

the presence of dead body in the said house rather stated

that he was informed by the Investigating Officer, thus, his

testimony too is of no worth to be relied upon.

Moreover, this PW has not produced ownership

documents of his brother in respect of the house
wherefrom the dead body of deceased was recovered. So

far as the photocopies of alleged agreement and CNIC of

the accused is concerned, the same cannot be taken into

consideration in absence of original as photocopies in

absence of original documents cannot be legally brought

on record of a case nor the same has any legal worth and

strength.

10. The most important piece of evidence in this case is

the statement of lady doctor Aalia, who appeared in the

witness box as PW-6 and stated that she examined the dead

body of deceased and prepared the postmortem report.

During cross-examination she deposed that dead body of

the deceased was completely mutilated and decomposed

i.e. the skin (outer) was absent and feature of the face was

not recognizable while, on the other hand, Deedar (PW-11)

stated that he identified the dead body of the deceased,

thus, there is sharp contradiction in their statements,

benefit of which must have to be extended to the convict-

appellant.
11. PW-10 (Mst. Bibi Ayesha) is the star witness of the

occurrence, being complainant of the case, who supported

the version as given in the FIR, wherein too she admitted

that she was informed by Mst. Naz Gul, sister of the

convict-appellant, some ten (10) days prior to lodging of

the report but she kept mum for no reason rather nothing in

the shape of explanation could be offered by her.

Apart from the above, during the course of cross-

examination she admitted as correct that she does not know

the exact date when the occurrence took place and also

when the informer informed her about the occurrence. She

admitted as correct that she had her own mobile, but

denied to have known the contact number of the informer,

which is a question looking askance that how it is possible

that one should not know the number of informer and that

too who informed a person regarding such an important

news, like the one in this case. Therefore, her such

immature statement too is not worth consideration and

thus, cannot be relied upon.
10

12. Deedar, who is uncle of the deceased, while

appearing in the witness box as PW-11 deposed that he

was marginal witness to the recovery of dead body of the

deceased rather he claimed to have identified the dead

body of the deceased which in other words, keeping in

view the statement of lady doctor, was not appealing to a

prudent mind as the doctor while recording her statement

handed down that the dead body was completely mutilated

and decomposed rather her outer skin was absent and

feature of the dead body was not recognizable, then, how

he could identify the same?

Besides, he himself twisted the story while stating

during his cross-examination that “it is correct that the

dead body of the deceased was mutilated / decomposed”

and again in the next line he stated that “the dead body

was partially decomposed”. \t appears that he himself

contradicted his own statement by narrating two versions

in the same breath, thus, possibility of concoction cannot

be ruled out.
11

13. Now another most important piece of evidence in

this case is the statement of Naik Muhammad, who while

appearing in the witness box as PW-13, stated that in light

of Mad No.46 dated 22.02.2009 he started enquiry and

when reached to the house of Sher Ali, he inquired from

him that since when the convict-appellant was residing in

his house, whose reply was that about fifteen (15) days

ago. However, Sher Ali further disclosed to him that prior

to it the convict-appellant was residing in the house of

Shafique Kababi, however, the prosecution has failed to

produce the said person in order to further strengthen its

case.

While cross-examining, the said PW admitted as

correct that he had neither recorded the statement of Sher

Ali under Section 161 Cr.P.C nor had taken into possession

any agreement / rent deed in respect of residence of the

convict-appellant. He further admitted as correct that Sher

Ali is not the relative of accused but only friend of him. He

further went on to say that he did not record the statement
12

of Shafique Kababi under Section 161 Cr.P.C. In reply to a

question qua maltreatment of the accused with the

deceased, he disclosed that he did not record the statement

of womenfolk, mentioned in Zimnis. He further admitted

as correct that the deceased had brothers but at the time of

discovery none from them was present with him, which is

not at all appealing to a prudent mind that on such a

serious occasion, a brother will absent himself. Further

deposed that the dead body of the deceased was so

decomposed that’s why he could not prepare the injury

sheet. Keeping in view the above glaring discrepancies,

one could reach to the conclusion that the statement of this

witness too is not up to the mark, thus, cannot be safely

relied upon.

14. Jehanzeb Khan, SHO, while appearing in the

witness box as PW-15, deposed that he was entrusted with

the investigation of the case and on 24.02.2009 he arrested

the acquitted co-accused Jawad Ali, who, on interrogation,

pointed out the place of occurrence and the we// wherein
13

the dead body of the deceased was thrown. He further

deposed that the convict-appellant was already arrested in

FIR No. 249/3 under Section 302 / 324 / 34 PPC, FIR No.

1014/3 under Section 3/4 Explosive Act read with Section

452 PPC, FIR No. 633/3 under Section 13 A.O and FIR

No. 879/05 under Section 13 A.O, thus, on application to

Magistrate, his transfer was sought from District and

Sessions Judge Charsadda and upon his transfer then his

physical custody was obtained from the learned Senior

Civil Judge Mansehra, however, astonishingly it has not

been shown anywhere either in his statement or in the

application submitted for his transfer from Charsadda to

Mansehra that from when he was in judicial lockup. He

further went on to say that during interrogation the accused

disclosed that his wife developed illicit relation with one

Wahid, whereafter he committed her murder, however,

when produced before the concerned Magistrate for

recording confession, he refused to confess his guilt, thus,

was sent to judicial lockup, hence, a question also arises
14

that if he had committed the offence and confessed his

guilt before the IO then why and for what reason he

refused to confess before the concerned Magistrate, despite

the fact that he remained in police custody for long forty

eight (48) hours.

15. | Apart from the discrepancies and contradictions in

the statements of PWs, discussed above, there are many

more things which are necessary to be debated upon.

16. According to the FIR, the complainant stated that

she was informed by Mst. Naz Gul, who is real sister of the

convict-appellant, regarding the occurrence which is not

appealing to a prudent mind because how a sister could

inform mother of the deceased in respect of the crime,

moreso, when it was committed by her real brother and

she, being the citizen of Pakistan, will, of course, have the

knowledge of consequences thereof.

17. Another intriguing aspect of the matter is that, while

informing about the tragedy, sister of the convict-appellant

(Mst. Naz Gul) called from Karachi to the complainant,
15

who is residing at Charsadda, but the prosecution has never

ever taken pain either to obtain call DATA or to get

transcript of conversation, so that to strengthen the

prosecution’s version or at least to mention the cell or

telephone numbers of the talkers.

18. Apart from the above, another interesting feature of

the case is that according to the FIR mother of the

deceased was informed by sister of the convict-appellant

some ten (10) days prior to registration of the FIR,

however, the complainant has failed to give any plausible

explanation for such a delay and otherwise too it is not

understandable that after getting information regarding

such a terrible incident then what for she kept mum for

long ten (10) days. Wisdom may be drawn from the case

law reported as 2017 SCMR 144 titled “Muhammad

Sadiq Vs. The State”.

19. | The most important piece of evidence in this case is

the statement of lady doctor Aalia, who, while examining

the dead body of deceased, mentioned that the dead body
16

of deceased was completely mutilated and decomposed

rather her outer skin was absent and feature of the face

were not recognizable, if it is so, then how the uncle of the

deceased identified her, moreso, when mother of the

deceased was also present at Mansehra but she too did not

bother to accompany her brother-in-law for identification

of the dead body.

The learned Lahore High Court in the case titled

“Javed Iqbal Vs. The State” reported as PLD 2014

Lahore 62, while placing reliance on the judgment of

Madhya Pardesh High Court reported as 1998 Cr.L.J 3934

almost in similar nature case, where too only skeleton was

found, has held that when cause of death could not be

known on postmortem for the reason that only skeleton

was produced before the doctor for conduct of postmortem,

the prosecution ought to have referred the dead body to

Anatomy Expert, which was not done and that was

considered as serious lacuna in the prosecution case, which

is the case in hand.
17

20. The entire prosecution evidence was thoroughly

searched with the valuable assistance of learned counsel

for the parties but nothing is available on record which

could show either the report regarding gender of the

deceased or sending of samples for DNA test to confirm

that the deceased was daughter of the complainant.

21. Above all, the prosecution has also failed to

examine other most important witnesses, Sher Ali,

Shafique Kababi, womenfolk of the locality and Malik

Aman, whose names were mentioned by the Investigating

Officer during his statement as Sher Ali, Shafique Kababi

and Malik Aman are the owners of the houses where the

convict-appellant was remained there on rent while the

womenfolk have been mentioned to have noticed

maltreatment of the convict-appellant towards his wife i.e.

the deceased.

22. So far as the motive i.e. illicit relation of the

deceased with one Wahid s/o Khiyal Muhammad is

concerned, the same has not been proved by the
18

prosecution. Similarly, the recovery of pistol too cannot be

believed for the simple reason that as the body of the

deceased was fully mutilated and decomposed, thus, was

not sent for anatomy expert for determination of firearm

injury on the person of deceased.

23. In the present case neither the substantive evidence

in the shape of ocular account, furnished by the star

witnesses i.e. PW-10 and PW-11, is worth reliance, being

full of contradiction nor the corroborative evidence in the

shape of motive, recovery have been proved by the

prosecution in accordance with settled principles of law,

besides even the alleged photocopies mentioned in the

statement of PW-4 were not put to the appellant in his

statement recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C. Even

otherwise, photocopy of a document in absence of its

original is not admissible in evidence. Reliance is placed

on the case law reported as (PLD 2005 SC 418) and (2007

SCMR 06).
19

24. Moreover, it is settled principle of law that when

the substantive evidence in the shape of ocular account,

furnished by the star witnesses, is not worth reliance, being

full of material contradictions, then, corroborative

evidence in the shape of motive, recovery and discovery

would be of no use to the prosecution, which otherwise, in

the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case,

are not worth reliance, being not proved and established in

accordance with the parameters set by the superior courts

of the country in the administration of criminal justice.

Wisdom can be drawn from the case law reported as (YLR

2011 Peshawar 1965).

25. It is settled principle of law that for extending

benefit of doubt to an accused person, it is not essential

that there should be bundle of doubts rather a single doubt,

if found reasonable for a prudent mind, would entitle the

accused to the benefit of it and would be entitled to

acquittal.
20

26. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in its celebrated
judgment reported as 1997 SCMR 25 titled “Muhammad
Ilyas Vs. The State” has observed that: -

“It is well settled principle of law that where

evidence creates doubt about the

truthfulness of prosecution story, benefit of

such a doubt had to be given to the accused

without any reservation”
27. The above view has further been strengthened by the
Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of “Muhammad Khan &
another Vs. The State” reported as 1999 SCMR 1220 by
holding that “conviction must be based on unimpeachable
evidence and certainty of guilt and any doubt arising in
the prosecution case must be resolved in favour of the
accused.”
28. It is the case of the prosecution that the appellant
had committed the murder of his wife but the entire
evidence collected by the prosecution is of no avail, being
full of contradictions, thus, merely on presumption that the
appellant is husband of the deceased, he cannot be
convicted. Reliance in this regard may be placed on the
cases law reported as PLD 2005 SC _ 63 titled “Pir
Mazhar-ul-Haq Vs. The State”, 2012, SCMR 754 titled

“President Balochistan High Court Bar Association Vs.
21

Federation of Pakistan” and 2017 SCMR_ 724 titled
“Nasrullah alias Nasro Vs. The State”.
29. Judged and considered from all angles and keeping
in view the combined study & careful reappraisal of the
entire evidence in the above manner, we are of the
considered view that the prosecution has failed to prove the
guilt of appellant beyond any shadow of doubt thus,
extending him the benefit of doubt, he deserves acquittal.
30. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed. The conviction
& sentences of the appellant recorded by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-III Mansehra vide judgment
dated 15.11.2010 are set-aside and he is acquitted of all the
charges, leveled against him. He be released forthwith
from Jail, if not required in any other case.

These are the detailed reasons for our short order of
the even date.
Announced:

05.10.2017.
