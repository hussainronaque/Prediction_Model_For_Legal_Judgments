JUDGMENT SHEET

Cr. M (Bail) No. 1196-A/2021.

Date of hearing 02.12.2021.

Petitioner/s (Bilal Ahmed) by Mr.
Muhammad Ishaq Battagrami, Advocate.

Respondents’ (The State) by Raja
Muhammad Zubair, AAG and nemo for
complainant.

MOHAMMAD _IBRAHIM __ KHAN, _ J.
Petitioner through the instant petition seek
his post-arrest bail in case FIR No. 789
dated: 10.11.2021 under sections 376 PPC
read with section 53 of Child Protection
Act and section 3 of TiP registered at
Police Station, Sara-e-Saleh, District,

Haripur, as the same relief was, declined

to him by the learned lower forum.

2. I have given my anxious thought to
the blue streak arguments of learned
counsel for the petitioner, learned AAG
and gone through the record with their
able assistance.

3. Complainant absent today, who

was present on previous date submitted an
affidavit stating therein, that the
accused/petitioner was nominated/charged
due to mis-conception.

4. Although, the accused/petitioner is
directly charged in the present FIR by the
complainant for committing rape with his
minor daughter, which is a heinous crime,
however, the medical report available on
file negates the version of complainant,
which reads as under:-

Description of Injuries:-

No resistant mark on body.
No bruise/rashes/redness on body.
No secretions/redness/tear noted on

examination of genitation.

It is pertinent to note here that at the end of
said report, the medical officer opined for
gynecologist advise, however, learned
AAG submitted that the complainant has
refused to conduct examination of her
minor daughter from gynecologist.

5. So far as applicability of section 53
of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child
Protection and Welfare Act, 2010
(hereinafier to be referred as the Act of

2010), is concerned, it depicts that this law
was specially introduced/enacted and
promulgated in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
with particular purposes i.e. to provide for
the care, protection, maintenance, welfare,
training, education, rehabilitation and
reintegration of ‘children at risk' in the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. For the sake of
convenience and ready reference, the
preamble of the Act of 2010, is reproduced

below:-

"WHEREAS, it is expedient to
provide for the care, protection,
maintenance, welfare, training,

education, rehabilitation and
reintegration of children at risk in
the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa".

"Child at risk" has been defined
under section 2(1)(e) of the Act in
the following words:-

"Child at risk" means a child in need
of protection, who

(i) is at risk, including an
orphan, child with disabilities, child
of migrant workers, child working
and or living on the street, child in
conflict with the law and child living
in extreme poverty.

(ii) is found begging; or

(iii) is found without having any
WL home or settled place of abode or
\ without any ostensible meaning of
subsistence; or

(iv) has a parent or guardian who
is unfit or incapacitated to exercise
control over the child; or

(vy) lives in a brothel or with a
prostitute or frequently visits any
place being used for the purpose of
prostitution or is found to associate
with any prostitute or any other
person who leads an immoral or
depraved life; or

(vi) — is being or is likely to be
abused or exploited for immoral or
illegal purposes or gain; or

(vii) is beyond the parental
control; or

(viii) is imprisoned with — the
mother or born in jail;

(ix) has lost his parents or one of
the parents and has no adequate
source of income; or

(x) is victim of an offence
punishable under this Act or any
other law for the time being in force
and his parent or guardian is
convicted or accused for the
commission of such offence; Or

(xi) is left abandoned by his
parent or parents as the case may be,
which will include a child born out

of wedlock and left abandoned by his
parent;

6. Keeping the preamble of the Act in
juxtaposition with the definition of the
"Child at risk" as contemplated under
section 2(1)(e) of the Act coupled with
the facts and circumstances of the instant
case, it could not be ascertained as to
whether the alleged victim, falls under the
definition of "Child at risk" or otherwise.
In such an eventuality, the applicability of
sections 53 of the Act of 2010, to the case
of petitioner is yet a begging question.

Wisdom can be derived from case law

reported in 2016 SCMR_ 1523, 2014

MLD 190 & 2018 YLR Note 114.

7. At the moment, there is no
incriminating evidence available on
record to show any nexus of the
accused/petitioner with the commission of
rape with minor daughter of complainant,

at least at this stage.

8. Moreover, in the instant case, no
compliance with the provision of Section
164-B Cr.P.C has been made because no
samples for DNA test have been obtained
either from the accused/petitioner or
victim despite the fact that the word
“shall” is used in the said provision,

making its applicability mandatory.

9. Investigation in the case is
complete and accused/petitioner is no
more required to the prosecution for the
very purpose. Even otherwise, in view of
the above stated facts, the case calls for
further inquiry under Sub-Section (2) of

Section 497 Cr.P.C, therefore, further
retention of the petitioner in jail will serve

no useful purpose.

10. Apart from the above, it has been
held time and again by the august
Supreme Court that bail does not mean
acquittal of accused but only change of
custody from Government agencies to the
sureties, who on furnishing bonds take
responsibility to produce the accused
whenever and wherever required to be
produced. Reliance could be placed on
case reported in 2008 SCMR 807 “Haji
Muhammad Nazir Vs State”.

11. So, by cutting the cackle, on
tentative assessment of material available
on file, a case for the grant of bail is made
out. Consequently, this bail application is
allowed and accused/petitioner is
admitted to bail provided he furnishes bail
bonds in the sum of Rs. 200,000/- (two
lakh) with two sureties, each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty
Judicial Magistrate, concerned, who shall
ensure that the sureties are local, reliable

and men of means.
12. Before parting with this order, this
court finds it necessary to mention that all
the observations recorded above are
tentative assessment just for the disposal
of bail petition and not intended to
influence the mind of trial Court, which is
free to appraise the evidence strictly in
accordance with law and merits of the
case.
