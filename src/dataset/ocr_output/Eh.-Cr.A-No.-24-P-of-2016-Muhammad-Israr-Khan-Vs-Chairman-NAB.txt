JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, J:- This appeal under section
13 (c ) of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999,
(NAO), filed by Muhammad Israr Khan and Muhammad
Javed Khan, the appellants, calls in question the legality
and propriety of judgment/order dated 07.11.2016, of
learned Accountability Court-I, Peshawar, whereby order
dated 26.10.2016 of the Director General (DG) National
Accountability Bureau (NAB), has been confirmed Bank
Accounts of the appellants, have been frozen.

2. Facts in brief forming the background of the
instant appeal are that an inquiry qua corruption and
corrupt practices in connection with procurement of
various items/ equipments by the Officers/officials of
Abdul Wali Khan’s University Mardan and others, was
initiated by the NAB, wherein accused Dr. Ihsan Ali, the

Vice Chancellor of the University and co-accused
2

including the appellants were allegedly found involved in
the commission of offence of corruption and corrupt
practices, resultantly, DG NAB, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by
invoking the provisions of section 12 of the NAO read with
section 34-A and Statutory Regulatory Order (SRO) dated
30.10.2015, froze the bank accounts of the appellants vide
order dated 26.10.2016, which order was confirmed by the
learned Accountability Court-I, Peshawar, vide impugned
order, hence, this appeal.

3. Learned counsel for the appellants argued that
under section 12 of the NA Ordinance, power to freeze
property is vested with the Chairman NAB or the Court
trying the accused for an offence under the Ordinance but
in the case in hand, the impugned freezing order has been
passed by DG NAB, who is lacking the power to do so, as
well as learned Accountability Court has also erred to
confirm it in absence of any reference before it against the
appellants, which was an essential criteria as per mandate
of section 12 of the NA Ordinance, hence, both the orders
are not tenable in the eyes of law. Elaborating his view
point, he contended that the language of section 12 NA
Ordinance, is clear and unambiguous according to which
the pendency of reference is sine qua non before the
Accountability Court for confirming the freezing order
because in absence of the reference, the Court would not be

in a position to determine the reasonable grounds for
3

believing that the accused has committed the offence. He
further contended that in the instant case neither the
freezing order has been passed by the Chairman NAB nor
was there any reference against the appellants before the
Accountability Court. He next argued that restriction under
section 12 NA Ordinance, cannot be imposed for unlimited
period. Though, learned counsel admitted delegation of
powers by the Chairman NAB under section 34-A to any
officer of the NAB, however, submitted that there was
nothing in black and white to prove delegation of such
power by the Chairman NAB to DG NAB to freeze the
bank accounts of the appellants. He submitted that the
impugned orders being nullity in the eyes are liable to be
set at naught.

4. Conversely, learned Special Public Prosecutor for
the NAB contended that the Chairman NAB has delegated
powers to the DG NAB vide SRO dated 30.10.2015, within
the meaning of section 34-A of the ordinance, hence, the
DG NAB, was competent to pass the freezing order. The
learned Accountability Court having sufficient record of
the matter, was competent to confirm the freezing Order.
He while supporting the impugned order sought dismissal
of the appeal.

5. We have considered the respective submissions of
learned counsel for the parties and perused the record with

their able assistance.

6. Undisputedly, both the appellants are accused in an
inquiry initiated by the NAB in respect of corruption and
corrupt practices in connection with procurement of
various items/equipments by the Officers/officials of
Abdul Wali Khan’s University. No doubt, under section 12
of the NAO, it is the Chairman NAB possessing the power
to freeze property, but at the same time under section 34A
of the NAO, the Chairman NAB may delegate such or any
of his power to and authorize performance of any of his
function by an officer of the NAB as he may deem fit and
proper. For the sake of convenience, we would like to
reproduce section 34A of the NAO.

‘34A. Delegation of powers: The Chairman

NAB may, by an order in writing delegate any

of his powers to and authorize performance of

any of his functions by an Officer of the NAB

as he may deem fit and proper, subject to such

conditions, if any, as may be specified in the

order, for carrying out the purposes of this

Ordinance.”
7. It has been categorically mentioned in the second
Paragraph of the impugned freezing order of DG NAB
that, he while exercising of powers under section 12 of the
NAO read with SRO dated 30.10.2015, hereby order the
freezing of the bank accounts of the appellant. So through

the aforesaid SRO, he was delegated with the powers
5

under section 12 by the Chairman NAB. Similarly, at the
time of confirmation of the freezing order of the DG NAB,
record was available before the Accountability Court as is
evident from the impugned order relevant part of which
read as, “The record made available with the replication
prima facie justify the fact that the respondents/objections
were partners in two firms namely REDCO Enterprises
and Pakistan Traders, who participated in the bids for I.T.
equipments and received payments in excess of the set
criteria of the University.”

8. The learned counsel for appellant has put a lot of
emphasis on the irremissible command of section 12 of the
NA Ordinance, i.e. pendency of reference before the
Accountability Court. We are not impressed by the
arguments of worthy counsel for the appellants because the
plain language of relevant portion of section 12 of the NA

Ordinance, run as under:-

“12. Power to freeze property: (a) The
Chairman NAB or the Court trying [an accused]
for any offence as_ specified under this
Ordinance, may, at any time, if there appear
reasonable grounds for believing that the
accused has committed such an offence, order
the freezing of his property, or part thereof,
whether in his possession or in the possession of
any relative, associate or person on his behalf.

Provided that any order of seizure,
freezing, attachment or any prohibitory order
mentioned above by the Chairman NAB, shall
remain in force for_a period not exceeding
[fifteen] days unless confirmed by the Court,
where the Reference under this Ordinance shall

6

be _sent_by the [Chairman] NAB. (emphasis
supplied).

9. The above quoted phrase from section 12 can
only be interpreted in visible/clear term that the
freezing order passed by the Chairman, shall not
remain enforce more than fifteen days, unless
confirmed by the Accountability Court, where the
reference under the NA Ordinance, shall be sent by the
Chairman NAB.

10. In this view of the matter, the arguments of the
learned counsel for the appellants are misconceived. The
impugned orders being well reasoned and based on proper
appreciation of law on the subject are not open to any
interference by this Court in its appellate jurisdiction.
Accordingly, this appeal stands dismissed.
