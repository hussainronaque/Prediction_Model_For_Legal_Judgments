(Enforcement) Custom House, Peshawar. Benefit of
Section 382-B Cr.P.C. has been extended to him.

4. The prosecution’s case as per contents of
First Information Report (“FIR”) in the instant appeal
is that pursuant to information received by Mr. Amjad

ur Rehman Collector Customs (Appraisement)
Peshawar on 19.12.2021 that an attempt will be made
to smuggle narcotics in a specially designed cavity in a
Bedford Truck bearing Registration No.C.8831 from
Afghanistan to Pakistan via Customs Station Torkham.
On the said information, Muhammad Tayyab
Additional Collector Customs _(Appraisement)
Torkham constituted a special team in the supervision
of Assistant Collector Saifullah. At 1500 hours, the
said vehicle entered at Import Terminal Customs
Station Torkham and was stopped for necessary
checking. Cursory checking of the vehicle revealed
presence of specially designed cavity which was
covered with welded metallic sheet. The same was cut
open with the help of welding machine. On query
driver of the vehicle disclosed his name as Musa Khan
Shinwari (appellant) son of Aman Khan r/o Nangarhar
Afghanistan. On search, heroin contained in eight
packets weighing total 9315 grams, Hashish contained
in eight packets weighing total 10415 grams, opium
weighing total 70681 grams and methamphetamine
(ICE) weighing 4460 grams were recovered from the
secret cavity. The Seizing Officer separated samples
from each packet of the recovered narcotics for
chemical analysis by the FSL and sealed the same into
parcels. He also sealed the remaining quantity of

heroin, opium, Hashish and ICE into a steel box and
deposited the same in State Ware House as per
procedure. The appellant was arrested and case was
registered against him.

5. The prosecution’s case in the connected
Cr.A. No.1159-P/2022 is that on 31.12.2021 at 1400
hours, at Import Terminal Custom Torkham, within the
criminal jurisdiction of Custom Station Torkham,
appellant Shah Faisal while trafficking narcotics from
Afghanistan to Pakistan in a Mazda Mini truck bearing
registration No.P.942, was intercepted by the Custom
officials and from his vehicle 368 packets of Hashish
and 323 packets of opium were recovered from secret
cavity made in floor of the truck, hence, he was
arrested and case FIR No.113/2021 dated 31.12.2021
under section 6, 7,8 and 9 (c ) of the Act of 1997 was
registered against him at Police Station Custom Station
Torkham.

6. On completion of investigation in both the
cases, challans under the relevant provisions of the Act
of 1997 were submitted against the appellants before
the learned trial Court, where the appellants were
summoned and formally charged sheeted under section
9 (d ) of the Act of 2019 instead under the Act of 1997
to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. On
closure of the prosecution’s evidence statements of the

appellant was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C.,
wherein they denied the prosecution’s allegation and
professed their innocence. They, however, neither
wished to be examined on oath or to produce evidence
in defence. On conclusion of trial, after hearing the
parties, the learned trial Court convicted and sentenced
the appellants vide judgments impugned in these
appeals.

7. On 31.10.2023, this court after hearing
learned counsel for the parties at some length passed
the following order:-

“In this case recovery has been effected at

Torkham terminal by the Custom Offices
and initially FIR was registered under
sections 6, 7 8 & 9 Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 1997 and thereafter the
charge was framed under section 9 (d) of the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 2019 on 13.04.2022 by the
learned trial Court. The attention of this
court was drawn to the order of the apex
court rendered in Criminal Petition No.7 of

2021, decided on 12.01.2022, we, therefore

put_the worthy Additional Attorney
General and the worthy Advocate

General KP on notice to _assist_us_ on the

question_that_when the recovery was
effected at the border or airport, whether
the accused would be prosecuted_under
the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa_ Control_of
Narcotic Substances Act, 2019 or under
Control_of Narcotic Substances Act,

1997?

8. We have heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the parties on the above legal point and
perused the relevant laws on the subject as well as
judgments of this court and hon’ble Apex court.

9. As stated above, as per contents of FIRs,
huge cache of narcotics consisting of heroin, Hashish,
opium, Methamphetamine (ICE), has been shown
recovered from vehicles entering into Pakistan viz
Torkham Terminal by the Customs Officials being
driven by the appellant, resultantly, FIRs under
sections 6, 7, 8 & 9 of the Act of 1997 were registered
against the appellants followed by submission of
challans under the Act of 1997, however, during trial,
the learned trial court indicted the appellants under
section 9 (d) of the Act of 2019. Admittedly, record is
silent for doing the aforesaid exercise, however, we are
mindful of the fact that the learned trial court has
proceeded with the trial of the appellants under the Act
of 2019 in pursuance of judgment of this court in WP
No.2889-P/2020. We deem it appropriate to furnish

brief history of the said judgment on the point.
10. After promulgation of the Act of 2019 on
4" September, 2019, one Muhammad Siddique filed
Writ Petition No.2889-P/2020, titled, “Muhammad

Siddique Vs Federation of Pakistan & others”

before this court wherein he questioned vires of the

Act of 2019 and sought issuance of the following
writ:-
“To declare that arrest/seizures, investigation
conducted by respondent No.4 within the
territorial jurisdiction of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa after the commencement of the
Act of 2019 as illegal, unlawful without
jurisdiction, without lawful authority,
coroum-non-judice and beyond the mandate
of the Act of 2019.
To direct the respondent not to
submit challan before the court of Judge
Special Court (CNS) under the CNS Act,

1997 against the petitioner.

The Writ Petition (ibid) was contested by the
respondents and after hearing both the sides, this court
vide judgment dated 01.12.2020, observed and held as

under:-
“The Courts established under section
22 of the Act of 2019, in view of section
23 have the exclusive jurisdiction to try all
offences cognizable under the Act of 2019,

which read as:-
“8.23. Jurisdiction_to Try
offences:- The special court

shall have the exclusive
jurisdiction to try all offences
cognizable under this Act.

Therefore, the Special Court established
under section 46 of the Act of 1997, could
not take cognizance of any offence, under
the Act of 2019, as in view of Section 45 of
the Act of 1997, such courts established
under section 46 of the Act of 1997 could
exercise __power__against _ offences,
committed under_the Act of 1997,
however, the Special Court, established
under section 46 of the CNS Act, 1997,
could proceed in accordance with law, in
cases__already registered before the
promulgation of the Act of 2019. Such
cases could not be effected thereof by
promulgation of the Act of 1997.

Therefore, for the reasons
mentioned hereinabove, this and the
connected writ petitions are disposed of

with direction to ANF, to substitute

relevant provision of law, provided
thereunder _the Act of 2019, for the
concern offence and report under section
173 CrP.C._ be submitted before the
Special Court _CNSA_established_under
section 22 of the Act of 2019, and cases
already submitted before the Special Court
CNS established under section 46 of the
11.
Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF), filed Review Petition
No.178-P/2020 for review of the judgment (supra) but
the same too was dismissed by this court vide
judgment dated 20.06.2022, for the reasons that no
mistake or error could be pointed out in the judgment
under review and secondly that the matter is subjudice

before the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Operative part of

Act of 1997, registered after promulgation
of the Act of 2019, shall be transferred to
competent Special Courts, established
under section 22 of the Act of 2019 and
the Special Courts on receipt of cases, may
substitute, charge the accused under
relevant provision of the prevailing law of
the Act of 2019, accordingly.” (Bold and

underlines are ours for emphasis).

Being discontented, the Regional Director

the judgment is reproduced below:-

“We are of the firm view that review is not
available for reconsideration or re-hearing
of the case. We find that the points urged
by the learned counsel for the petitioners
have elaborately been discussed and
answered by this court in the impugned
judgment; therefore, the same cannot be re-
opened in review petition. Nothing has
been shown by the petitioners that there has
been mistake or error apparent on the face
of the record, whereby judgment passed by
this court could be reviewed, particularly,

when civil petition for leave _to_appeal
against __the impugned judgment _is
10

sub-judice_before_the Hon’ble_ Supreme
Court of Pakistan. In the circumstances no
case for review is made out, consequently,

this review petition is dismissed.

12. It is important to mention here that judgment
dated 01.12.2020 in WP No.2889-P of 2020, was
followed and relied upon by this court in the judgment
dated 14.01.2021, rendered in WP_No.1237-P/2021,
titled, “Gul Khan Vs the State”, relevant part of
which is reproduced below for ready reference:-

“We have before us the judgment of this
Court passed in case titled, “Muhammad
Sidique Vs Federation of Pakistan” (Writ
Petition No.2889-P/2020). In the said
petition, the petitioner had challenged his
arrest and investigation by the ANF in the
cases whereby the contraband were
recovered from him. The question of
jurisdiction of ANF to investigate in the
matter and submission of challan before the
court was extensively discussed in the said
judgment. This court while considering
section 6 of the CNSA, 1997, has held that
ANF has the jurisdiction to arrest and
investigate any matter relating to narcotic.
However, in view of section 59 of the KP
CNSA, 2019 repealing the jurisdiction of
all courts established under CNSA 1997,
this _court_has_held that _ANF_after

completion of investigation shall submit
ll

challan before the Special Court

established_under section 22 of the KP

CNSA 2019. The judgment of this court
was followed in the subsequent judgment
dated_ 14.01.2021 passed_in WP No.

654-D/2020, therefore, we are not

inclined to hold a different view.

In view of the above, we direct the

ANF to submit complete challan in all
these_cases_ before the Special Court

established under section 22 of the KP

CNSA 2019 within fifteen (15) days from
receipt of this judgment. Similarly, if any

challan_is submitted before the Special
Court established under CNSA 1997, the

said Court shall transmit the cases to the

Special Court established_under section
22 of the KP CNSA 2019 forthwith. (Bold

and underlines are ours for emphasis).

In compliance of the judgments (supra) of this court all
the cases registered by the ANF, after promulgation of
the Act of 2019 and pending trial before the Special
Court (CNS) established under the Act of 1997, were
transferred to the special courts empowered under
section 22 of the Act of 2019 for trial and conclusion.

13. Admittedly, this case has been registered on
19.12.2021 i.e. after the judgments (supra) of this
court, that’s why the learned trial court, in compliance

of the judgments (ibid) has tried the appellants under
12

the Act of 2019. Though the judgments (ibid) of this
court have been questioned before the Hon’ble
Supreme Court by the Government and are still in the
field as the same have not been suspended, however,
the learned trial court has misconstrued the situation
because the mode and manner of the occurrence and
the place of recovery in the present cases is Torkham
Border Custom Terminal and the narcotics were being
smuggled inside Pakistan.

14. Though under section 59 of the Act of 2019,
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 2997 has been
repealed but to the extent of cultivation, possession,
selling, purchasing, delivery and transportation etc
within the Province to the extent of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, which for the sake of convenience and

ready reference is reproduced below:-
“8.59. Repeal_and_savings:-_ (1) The
Control of Narcotics Substance Act, 1997
(Act No.XXV of 1997), to the extent of
cultivation, possession, selling, purchasing,
delivery and transportation etc within the

Province, to the extent of the Khyber

Pakhtunkhwa is hereby repealed.” (Bold

and underlines are ours for emphasis).
The words “within the Province to the extent of the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa” are of the paramount

importance, which excludes the applicability of the Act
of 2019 to the present cases as in these cases huge
quantity of narcotics of various kinds being smuggled
from Afghanistan to Pakistan was seized at Torkham
border at Import Terminal, therefore, the provisions of
the Act of 1997 would be applicable. Besides, section
59 of the Act of 2019, has also been interpreted by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in order dated 12.01.2022,

rendered Criminal Petition No.7 of 2021, wherein the

13

following was observed:-

15.
firm in our view to hold that this and the connected

case have rightly been registered under the relevant

“Insofar as the second ground in the
impugned order regarding the repealing
effect of section 59 of the KP Act is
concerned, we may observe that the
contraband was seized at the Peshawar
Airport whilst the respondent was on his
way to take Flight No.DG.0785 to Riyadh,
Saudi Arabia via Bahrain. Consequently,

the said seizure was made on the customs

ee ————————

frontier which is within the jurisdiction of
the Federation notwithstanding section 59
ibid. With respect to such seizure the
jurisdiction of the CNS Court remains
intact. It goes without saying that as the
CNS_Act_1997_is_ valid_and_operative
within the Federal_Legislative field,
therefore, the detention and_seizure_as
well as the investigation conducted by the

ANF pursuant to the said law is valid and
legally effective.” (Bold and underlines are

ours for emphasis).

For what has been discussed above, we are
14

provisions of the Act of 1997. The learned trial Court
has misconstrued the situation, thus landed into the
field of error by trying the appellants under the Act of
2019.

16. Accordingly, convictions and sentences of the
appellants recorded by the learned trial Court vide
judgments 27.08.2022 and 07.11.2022 are hereby set
aside. The cases are remanded to the learned trial Court for
trial denovo. Challan in both the cases have been submitted
under the provisions of the Act of 1997, therefore, the
learned trial court shall frame charge against the appellants
afresh under the relevant provisions of the Act of 1997 and
thereafter shall proceed with the cases in accordance with
law. The appellants shall remain under trial prisoners. It is
expected that the learned trial court while keeping in view
the agonies of the appellants already faced by them shall
conclude the trial expeditiously. The parties would be at
liberty to place reliance on the already recorded evidence,
if they so desire and to this effect the learned trial Court

shall record their joint statement. Copy of this judgment be

placed on connected Cr.A. No.1 159-P of 2022,
