Dr. Khurshid Iqbal, J.-

1. This appeal challenges the judgment, dated 11.02.2020,
rendered by the learned Additional Sessions Judge/Judge,
MCTC, Lakki Marwat. By the judgment, the respondent was
acquitted of the charges under Section 9(c) of the Control of
Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 ("the Act") in the case FIR No.
865, dated 28.11.2017, registered at Police Station Naurang,
District Lakki Marwat.

2. Briefly, on 28.11.2017, the complainant Karim Khan,
SHO, received information that a person in Suzuki motorcar
bearing Registration No. ABL-555/Sindh, traveling from Gandi
Chowk to Karak, was engaged in trafficking charas for sale. In
response, accompanied by a police contingent, he immediately
rushed to the spot and laid a barricade. The mentioned motorcar
was intercepted, and its driver, identified as Nawab Ali, son of
Abul Jabbar, resident of Ghazni Khel, was deboarded. A search
of the vehicle revealed 14 packets concealed in brown paper

plaster within the side cover of the window, each containing
Page - 2 - of 8

charas. Upon weighing, each packet was found to be 1000
grams (14kg in toto). The recovery was documented in a memo,
dated 28.11.2017. The respondent, identified as Nawab Ali, was
arrested on the same date through vide his arrest card of even
date. A report (murasila) was drafted and forwarded to the
police station for the registration of the case, which

subsequently transformed into the ibid FIR.

3. Following the conclusion of the investigation, complete
challan was submitted for trial against the respondent. Copies
were provided to him in accordance with Section 265-C Cr.P.C.
Subsequently, a charge was framed, and upon pleading not

guilty, the respondent opted for a trial.

4. The prosecution produced a total of nine witnesses to
substantiate its case. During the trial, the respondent’s
statement under section 342 Cr.P.C was recorded, wherein he
asserted his innocence and refuted the allegations made against
him. He, however, didn’t opt to produce evidence in his defence
or to record his statement on oath as outlined in section 340(2)
Cr.P.C. Following the arguments, the learned trial court,
through the impugned judgment, dated 11.02.2020, acquitted

the respondent of the charges leveled against him.

5. We have heard the arguments of learned Assistant

Advocate General for the State and perused the record.

6. | The most significant lacuna in the prosecution's case is
the failure to adhere to the necessary protocols during the
chemical analysis of the contraband at the Forensic Science
Laboratory (FSL). The report from the Chemical Examiner of
narcotics substances, obtained under section 36 of the Act,

highlights this lacuna. The section reads:

36. Reports of Government Analysts: (1). The
Page - 3 - of 8

Government Analyst to whom a sample of any
narcotic drugs, psychotropic substance or
controlled substance has been submitted for test
and analysis shall deliver to the person submitting
it, a signed reporting quadruplicate in the
prescribed form and forward one copy thereof to
such authority, as maybe prescribed.

[..]

7. The aforementioned analysis is conducted by the
Government Analyst at the FSL in accordance with Rule-6 of
the Control of Narcotic Substances (Government Analysts)
Rules, 2001 ("the rules"), which states:

6. Report of result of test or analysis.--- After
test or analysis the result thereof together with full
protocols of the test applied, shall be signed in
quadruplicate and supplied forthwith to the sender
as specified in From-II.

8. A combined reading of the aforementioned provisions
makes it clear that section 36 of the Act addresses the process
concerning the reports submitted by Government Analysts. It
delineates the steps that a Government Analyst must adhere to
when handling samples of narcotic drugs, psychotropic
substances, or controlled substances submitted for testing and
analysis. It mandates that upon receiving a sample for testing,
the Government Analyst must furnish a signed report
quadruplicate in the prescribed form to the individual or entity
submitting the sample. Additionally, one copy of the report
must be forwarded to the designated authority as prescribed by
law. At the same time, Rule-6 of the rules, in the context of
section 36, elucidates the procedure for reporting the results
arising from tests or analysis conducted by the Government
Analyst. It serves as a complementary component to section 36,

offering more nuanced insights into the content and delivery of
Page - 4 - of 8

the test results. According to this rule, following the completion
of the test or analysis, the result, along with the ‘full protocols’
detailing the applied testing methods, must be signed in
quadruplicate. Subsequently, the signed result, accompanied by
the protocols, is to be promptly supplied to the sender, as
specified in Form-II. Essentially, the rule introduces additional
procedural specifications regarding the content and delivery of
test results. It ensures that the sender expeditiously receives not
only the results, but also a comprehensive account of the testing
protocols employed by the Government Analyst. This interplay
between Section 36 and Rule-6 establishes a robust framework
governing the reporting of test results in the broader context of

the Act.

9. Turning back to the facts of the case, it transpires that the
spaces on the back of the FSL report designated for relevant
protocols and tests are not only blank, but also crossed out from
top to bottom. This constitutes a complete violation of Rule-6
as outlined in the rules. According to section 36 of the Act, a
Government Analyst, to whom a sample of a recovered
substance is sent for examination, must provide a signed report
in quadruplicate in the prescribed form. Failure to prepare the
report in accordance with the prescribed manner and form
disqualifies it as a report under section 36, preventing it from
being treated as conclusive proof of the recovery of a narcotic

substance from the accused person.

10. In the case of Ikram Ullah & others v. The State (2015
SCMR 1002), the Supreme Court emphasized the importance
of Rule-6, stating that the Government Analyst must refer to
necessary protocols, mention applied tests, and present their
results in the report. Failure to comply with this rule not only

affects the reliability of the report, but also disqualifies it from
Page - 5 - of 8

being considered a report under section 36, thereby lacking
conclusive proof of the recovery of a narcotic substance from

the accused person.

11. Similarly, in Zhe State through Regional Director-ANF v.
Imam_Bakhsh_and_ others (2018 SCMR 2038), the Supreme

Court addressed the mandatory nature of Rule-6, emphasizing
that compliance, including mentioning the full protocols of the
test applied in the report, is necessary. The Court held that non-
compliance frustrates the purpose and object of the Act,
rendering the Government Analyst's report inconclusive and
unreliable. Since the Government Analyst did not adhere to the
prescribed manner and form, it is concluded, based on the legal
discourse and precedents cited, that the FSL report is
inconclusive and unreliable. Therefore, no conviction can be

recorded based on this report.

12. Another material weakness in the prosecution's case is
the delayed dispatch of samples’ parcels to the FSL. They were
dispatched to the FSL after 13 days of the recovery, with no
explanation at all. The secure custody of the seized substance
during the intervening period lacks substantiation through a
well-knit chain of custody. Consequently, the unexplained
delay presents an additional factor that may weigh against the
prosecution. This perspective aligns with the proposition
adopted by this Court in the case of State through Advocate-
General Khyber Pakhtunkhwa v. Agil Muhammad (2023 YLR

2599 Peshawar), wherein it was observed:

6. The recovery was shown as having effected
on 18.05.2022. But the sample separated from
it, was sent to the FSL on 24.05.2022. Thus,
there is a delay of about 06 days in sending the
representative sample to the FSL. Relevant in
this regard is Rule 4(2) of the Control of
Page - 6 - of 8

Narcotic Substances (Government Analysts)
Rules, 2001, which provides for the completion
of such exercise within 72 hours of the
recovery. The delay caused has not been
plausibly explained, so keeping it in
juxtaposition with the aforementioned facts
and circumstances, the same could be
considered as fatal to the prosecution case.

13. During the trial, 13 of the 14 packets comprising the case
property were produced. Efforts were made to trace the
remaining packet, and it was eventually traced. However, this
circumstance unequivocally indicates that not all the packets
were securely stored, as otherwise, they would have been
produced collectively. In other words, the official concerned did
not know as to where the said packet was lying. This aspect

raises concerns regarding the safe custody of the case property.

14, While the Investigating Officer did receive the case
property from the complainant/Seizing Officer and took
representative samples from the packets, there was a notable
omission. The I.O. did not cite the members of the investigation
staff in the recovery memo. Instead, ASI Najibullah and HC
Sardar Ali, both from the police operational staff, were cited.
These officials could not be regarded as independent witnesses,
as they were present with the complainant/seizing officer during

the search.

15. While section 103 Cr.P.C is not applicable under the Act,
the established precedents of the higher courts emphasize the
importance of associating private witnesses with search and
seizure proceedings when the seizing officers receive prior
information about the trafficking of narcotic substances,
ensuring fairness. This view aligns with what the Supreme
Court observed in Muhammad Aslam v. The State (2011 SCMR
Page - 7 - of 8

820). In the present case, the prosecution witnesses admitted the
presence of private persons at the scene, yet none was

associated with the proceedings.

16. While police witnesses are generally considered reliable,
there is a judicial consensus that the inclusion of private
witnesses in the recovery process adds an extra layer of caution,
as observed in various cases. For instance, in Hakim Ali v. The
State (2001 PCr.L.J 1865 [Karachi]), the conviction and
sentence were set aside due to the absence of an independent
witness despite the occurrence taking place during daylight.
Similarly, in a 2013 case (Ghulam Mustafa v. The State, 2013
PCr.L.J 860 [Sindh]), the court, while acquitting the accused,
noted that the prosecution's failure to cite private witnesses,
despite a significant number of people being present at the
crime scene, made the story unnatural. This view was also
expressed by this Court in Jmran v. The State (2013 PCr.LJ
640 Peshawar).

17. Upon a thorough scrutiny of the prosecution evidence,
we have arrived at the inescapable conclusion that despite the
recovery of significant narcotic substances, the prosecution has
failed to substantiate the charges against the respondent. A
fundamental principle of criminal law dictates that even a
single, slight, but reasonable doubt is sufficient for the acquittal
of the accused. Recently, the Supreme Court reiterated the
significance of this principle in Ahmed _Ali_v. State (2023
SCMR 781). Additionally, another cornerstone of criminal law
is the presumption of innocence granted to an accused during
trial. Upon acquittal, this presumption is doubled. It is
imperative to state that an appellate court ordinarily refrains
from overturning an acquittal unless it is manifestly perverse,

fanciful, conjectural, glaringly inconsistent with the evidence
Page - 8 - of 8

on record, and results in a miscarriage of justice. In this regard,
the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Jehangir vs.
Aminullah & others (2010 SCMR 491) is pertinent. However,

the facts and circumstances before us differ.

18. Considering the aforementioned reappraisal of the
evidence, we conclude that the prosecution has not succeeded in
proving the charges against the respondent. Consequently, we

uphold the acquittal, and, as a result, dismiss the present appeal

in limine.
