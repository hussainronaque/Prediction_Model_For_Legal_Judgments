 AMJAD ALI
SAHITO J., Through the instant Crl. Bail Application, applicants/accused Mushtaque
Ali and Arbelo both bycaste Bhanbhro
seek pre-arrest bail in Crime No. 148/2021, offence u/s 147, 148, 149,
324, 504, 506/2, 114, 337F(iii) PPC registered at police station Salehpat,
District Sukkur. Prior to this, the applicants filed such application, but the
same was turned down by learned V-Additional Sessions Judge Sukkur vide order
dated 18-02-2022, hence this bail application. 
2.       The details and
particulars of the FIR are already available in the bail application and FIR,
same could be gathered from the copy of FIR attached with such application,
hence, needs not to reproduce the same hereunder.
3.       Learned counsel for the applicants/accused
submit that applicants/accused are innocent and they have falsely been
implicated in this case by the complainant with mala fide intentions and
ulterior motives due to dispute over the landed property, which has been admitted
by the complainant in the FIR; that there is inordinate delay of about 02
months in lodging the FIR and such long delay has not been explained by the
complainant; that prior to this, applicant Arbelo has lodged the FIR No.
48/2021 at PS Salehpat against the complainant, therefore in order to
pressurize the applicants/accused party, the complainant has lodged this false
FIR; that the injured sustained by the complainant/injured is self suffered
injury and according to medical report there is blackening and charring over
the injury; that the applicants/accused have joined the investigation and they
have not misused the concession of interim pre-arrest bail, therefore, he pray
for confirmation of interim pre-arrest bail.
4.       On the other hand learned APG for the
State has opposed for grant of pre-arrest bail to the applicants/accused on the
ground that as per medical certificate, the injury No.1 & 2 of the injured
have been declared as 337F(iii) PPC, which are punishable up to three years. 
5.       I have heard learned counsel for the applicants/accused,
learned APG for the State and have gone through the material available on
record.
6.       Admittedly, there is inordinate delay of
about 02 months in lodging the FIR and such long delay has not been properly
explained by the complainant. According to provisional medical certificate of
injured Qadir Bux, issued by medical officer, Taluka Hospital Rohri, there is
blackening and charring over the injures and as per contention that of learned
counsel for the applicants/accused, that the injuries sustained by the injured
are self suffered. The injuries sustained by the injured have been declared by
the medical officer as Ghayr-e-Jaifah Mutalahima 337F(iii) PPC, which is
punishable up to three years. Further the applicants/accused have not repeated
the fire shot, from which it could be presumed that they have made the fires
upon the injured with intention to commit his murder and the injury sustained
by the injured is also on non vital part of the body. Moreover, record reflects
that prior to this, the applicant/accused Arbelo has lodged FIR No. 48/2021
against the present complainant, injured Qadir Bux and others and in order to
convert such dispute into counter version, the complainant has lodged this FIR.
Learned counsel for the applicants/accused has also pleaded malafide on the
part of complainant to falsely involve them over the landed property. The case
has been challaned and applicants/accused are no more required for further
investigation. 
7.       In view of above
discussion, learned counsel for the applicants/accused has made out a good case
for confirmation of bail in the light of sub section (2) of Section 497 CrPC, hence
the instant bail application is allowed and interim pre arrest bail already
granted to the applicants/accused is confirmed on same terms and condition. Learned
trial Court is at liberty to take action against the applicants/accused, if they
misuse the concession of bail. 
8.       Needless
to mention that the observations made hereinabove are tentative in nature and
would not influence the learned Trial Court while deciding the case of the
applicant on merits.
