Shabbir Hussain Gigyani, Advocate.

S M ATTIQUE SHAH, J.- Muntazir Khan son of

Khog Khan, the appellant, has impugned the judgment

dated 08.10.2020 passed by learned Additional Sessions

Judge/Judge, Model Criminal Trial Court, Swabi, in case

FIR No.299 dated 28.09.2001 under sections 302/34 PPC,

registered at Police Station, Yar Hussain, District Swabi,

whereby the appellant was convicted and sentenced as

mentioned below:-

(i) Under Section-302 (b) PPC to undergo
imprisonment for life as Ta’zir.

(ii) The convict-appellant was also held liable to
pay compensation under section-544-A
Cr.PC to the tune of Rs.3,00,000/- to the
legal heirs of deceased and; shall be
recoverable as arrear of land revenue or in
default of payment of such compensation the
2
Ea A

convict shall suffer further SI for six
months.

(iii) Benefit of section-382-B Cr. PC was
extended to the appellant.

2. Precisely stating the facts of the case are, that on
28.09.2001 complainant Raj Wali brought the dead body of
his brother Muhammad Ali to police station Yar Hussain
with the help of co-villagers and reported the matter to the
effect that at the time of occurrence, he was coming back
after attending the call of nature, his deceased brother
Muhammad Ali alongwith his son Qaiser Ali came out from
their house and; when reached near him; in the meantime,
Muntazir Khan (convict-appellant) and Dawar Khan
(convicted co-accused) duly armed with Kalashnikovs
arrived and started firing at his brother Muhammad Ali;
resultantly, his brother got hit and died on the spot. The
motive was reported that some 18/19 years back, sister of
the accused namely Mst. Aqal Mina had eloped with
deceased Muhammad Ali; but, that matter was subsequently
patched up. The complainant charged the accused for the
murder of his brother Muhammad Ali. Report of the
complainant was reduced into writing vide FIR (EX.PA).

After the commission of offence, the accused went into
A
erp ens

hiding thus, after completion of investigation, challan u/s

512 Cr.PC was submitted against him.

3. On 27.11.2017 the convict-appellant was arrested in
the present case and; after completion of investigation,
supplementary challan against him was submitted. He was
summoned and provisions of section-265-C Cr.PC were
complied with. Formal charge against the appellant was

framed to which he did not plead guilty and claimed trial.

4. In order to prove its case, the prosecution examined
as many as ten (10) PWs and; after closure of prosecution
evidence, statement of accused was recorded under Section
342 Cr.P.C wherein he negated the prosecution story,
professed innocence and alleged false involvement in the
present case. However, he neither wished to be examined
on Oath within the meaning of Section 340(2) Cr.P.C nor

desired to produce evidence in defense.

5.  Oncompletion of trial, after hearing the arguments of
learned counsel for the parties and appraising of evidence
on the file, the learned trial Court vide impugned judgment
dated 08.10.2020, convicted the appellant and sentenced
him as mentioned hereinabove. Feeling aggrieved from his
conviction and sentences, the appellant has approached this

Court by filing the present criminal appeal.
6. Learned counsel for the accused-appellant
vehemently contended that impugned findings of conviction
and sentence are illegal; being against the evidence so
produced by the prosecution. Further, that the prosecution
miserably failed to bring home the charge against the
accused-appellant. That case of the prosecution is full of
contradictions and improvements and; thus, not worth for
maintaining the conviction and sentence so rendered by the
learned trial court under any circumstances. Further,
contended that it was an unseen and night occurrence. That
the medical evidence is in conflict with the ocular account
so furnished by the PWs; which belies the prosecution
version. That the crime empties so recovered from the crime
spot had not been sent to the FSL to ascertain as to whether
these were fired from one weapon or more. That the learned
trial Court had wrongly been influenced from the judgement
passed in the case of the co-accused Dawar Khan. Further,
that the case of convicted co-accused and the present
accused-appellant is distinguishable from each other; that at
the time of arrest of the accused-appellant nothing
incriminating was recovered from his personal possession
nor at his pointation any discovery was effected. Mere
abscondence of accused-appellant is no ground for holding

him guilty of an offence punishable with imprisonment for
life or death sentence. Lastly, he contended that the
prosecution has miserably failed to establish its case beyond
any reasonable doubt; therefore, the judgment of the learned

trial Court requires reversal.

7. Conversely, learned counsel representing the
complainant-respondent strongly opposed the arguments so
advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant and;
argued that earlier co-accused namely Dawar Khan was
inducted in the case by the learned trial Court and; upon
conclusion of his trial he was convicted and awarded death
sentence: which was commuted to life imprisonment by this
Court; therefore, the accused-appellant deserve no leniency.
Further, that the prosecution has fully established its case
against the accused-appellant beyond reasonable doubt.
That the accused-appellant remained absconder for
sufficient long time and; he failed to provide any plausible
explanation for his abscondence. Lastly, prayed for

dismissal of the appeal in hand; being meritless.
8. Arguments heard and record perused.

9. In the present case two accused namely Dawar Khan
and Muntazir Khan were charged for the murder of
Muhammad Ali deceased. On 30.07.2003 accused Dawar

Khan was arrested and inducted in the case, after conclusion
of trial, the learned trial Court vide judgment dated
08.06.2004 convicted and sentenced him to death penalty
and; against his conviction he filed Criminal Appeal No.488
of 2004 before this Court and; vide judgment dated
30.11.2004, his conviction was maintained; however, the
sentence of death penalty was altered to life imprisonment.
On 27.11.2017 convict-appellant Muntazir Khan was also
arrested in the present case and; supplementary challan was
submitted against him before the trial Court; wherein, he
was inducted in the case and; upon conclusion of trial, vide
impugned judgment dated 08.10.2020 he was convicted u/s-

302(b) PPC and sentenced to life imprisonment.

10. In view of the contention of the learned counsel for
the complainant, so raised at the bar qua the earlier trial
and conviction of the co-accused Dawar Khan and; its
impact on present case. We would like to first discuss the
same. It is the golden principle of Criminal Justice that
evidence adduced against an accused in a trial, is to be
adjudged and scrutinized independently without being
influenced from the evidence and findings of acquittal or
conviction of co-accused so rendered in a separate trial.
For the sake of arguments if the contention of the learned

counsel for complainant is acceded to; then, certainly
holding of an independent trial of co-accused upon his
arrest would be nothing; but, a trial in futility; which is
neither, desirable; nor, permissible under the law.
Therefore, the earlier trial and conviction of the co-
accused Dawar Khan has no bearing upon the instant
case. PLD 1960 S.C (Pak) 18 titled “Allah Ditta..vs..The
State.”, P.Cr.LJ 1997-510 titled “Zalay Mir..vs.. The
State”, 2011 YLR-1014 titled “Sher Akbar..vs.. Mst. Sajida
and another”, 2018 YLR Note-43 Hayatullah V. The state

& another.

11. As charge leveled against the convict-appellant
entails capital punishment, therefore, for recording
conviction in such like cases, strong and corroborative
evidence of unimpeachable character is the required
criteria, as findings of guilt against an accused must not
be based on probabilities to be inferred from the
evidence; rather, such findings must rest surely and firmly
on the evidence of unimpeachable character, otherwise,

the golden principle of benefit of doubt would come into

play.

12. Complainant Raj Wali (PW-8) (brother of

deceased) and eyewitness Qaiser Khan (PW-9) son of
deceased Muhammad Ali had charged the convict-
appellant Muntazir Khan and convicted co-accused
Dawar Khan (brothers inter-se) for the murder of
Muhammad Ali by firing at him with their respective
Kalashnikovs during night hours on the motive that Mst.
Agal Meena, sister of the accused, eloped with the
deceased Muhammad Ali some 19 years prior to the
occurrence. However, the complainant in his report
EX.PA as well as in his Court statement stated that the
matter of elopement had already been patched up. If it is
so, then, the very murder of the deceased is beyond
comprehension against the motive so forwarded by the
prosecution. Both the PWs in their respective statements
have stated that they identified the accused in the light of
electric bulb; but, distance from the place of bulb and that
of complainant or accused has not been mentioned
therein, from which it could be ascertained that a person
from such a distance can be identified or not. Moreover,
they did not utter a single word that where the bulb was lit
at the time of occurrence. The investigating officer
prepared the site plan EX.PB at the instance of
complainant Raj Wali (PW-8) and Qaiser Khan (PW-9);

wherein the bulb has been shown to be affixed on the wall
¢

of the house of Shah Zaman son of Sher Zaman at point-A
and; was allegedly lit at the time of occurrence; while from
point-B four empties of 7.62 have been shown recovered;
but, the distance between point-A and point-B has not been
mentioned in the site plan. The distance between the house
of accused and the place of occurrence has been mentioned
as 35 paces; while the distance between the accused and
eyewitnesses have been shown as 13/14 paces; but, no point
had been allotted to the house of accused in the site plan,
whereas the house of accused and that of Shah Zaman have
been shown opposite to each other of the thoroughfare.
Although, the eyewitnesses alleged that they identified the
accused in the light of bulb, which was lit at the wall of the
house of one Shah Zaman; but, said Shah Zaman has not
been produced before the court in order to establish that at
the crucial time of occurrence, it was lit or otherwise. It is
noteworthy that the I.O has not given distance between
point-A, where the bulb was lit and points 4 & 5; where the
complainant and eyewitness have been shown respectively.
However; the distance between points 3 & 4 and 4 & 5
allotted to accused and PWs respectively had been shown as
13/14 paces respectively; whereas the distance between the
house of the accused and; place of occurrence has been

mentioned as 35 paces and; when we add the same with the
10

distance of complainant and accused i.e. 13/14 paces, that
comes 48/49 paces (140 feet). In our view from such a long
distance recognition of accused is not possible. The
complainant during cross-examination stated that the
distance between the spot and that of his house might be
250/300 paces; but, neither his house nor such distance has
been shown in the site plan by the 1.0, which was prepared
at his instance. Furthermore, the complainant in his report
EX.PA as well as in his Court statement, stated that he was
coming back after easing himself, when reached the spot, he
saw his deceased brother Muhammad Ali and his son
Qaiser Ali coming from their house towards him on the
path. During cross examination, he stated that he had shown
the place where he had gone for easing to the I.O during
investigation; but, no such reference has been given in the

site plan EX.PB, which could support his contention.

13. During investigation, the Investigating Officer
recovered four empties of 7.62 bore from the crime spot
through recovery memo EX.PC. During cross
examination the complainant stated that; “7 cannot say
regarding the number of fire shots as whether 20, 30 or
40 shots were fired by the accused. Similarly, I cannot say

as to from whose fire shots the deceased was hit.” Qaiser
é

11

Ali PW-9 in his cross examination stated that; “J cannot
give the number of fire shots at the time of occurrence nor
can say with whose fire shot the deceased was hit.”
However, perusal of recovery memo EX.PC reveals that
during spot inspection, the I.O recovered bloodstained
earth from the place of deceased Muhammad Ali, four
empties of 7.62 bore and; a bulb of 100 watt; but, the
complainant did not utter a single word qua recovery of
the bulb, which was alleged to be lit at the time of
occurrence. However, the empties of 7.62 bore so
recovered from the crime spot, were not sent to the FSL
to ascertain as to whether the same were fired from one
weapon or more than one weapon. Although both the
eyewitnesses have forwarded the ocular account of
occurrence; but, both in their respective cross
examination stated that they cannot say that with whose
fire shots the deceased was hit. It is also pertinent to
mention here that at the time of arrest of the convict-
appellant, no crime weapon has been recovered either from
his direct or indirect possession nor he has made any

discovery.

14. Qaiser Khan PW-9 in his examination in chief stated

that; “J and my deceased father took our evening meal
Fe*2e302,

12

whereafter came out from our house and were proceedings
to village side.” However, the ibid stance of PW-9 is belied
by the statement of PW-3 Dr. Inamullah Khan, who
conducted autopsy on the dead body of the deceased
Muhammad Ali; who while examining the abdomen found
that; “Walls, peritoneum, small intestine found injured.
Stomach healthy and empty.” which belies the stance so
taken by PW-9. The complainant during cross examination
stated that; “.../ have not disclosed the object of presence of
the deceased Muhammad Ali and PW Qaiser on the spot at
the time of occurrence....... After the occurrence people of
the locality attracted to the spot and lifted the deceased for
taking to the Police Station. Similarly, hands and clothes of
the PW Qaiser also not besmeared with the blood of the
deceased. It is not in my knowledge as to whether PW
Qaiser signed or thumb impressed my report as the same
will be in the knowledge of PW Qaiser. Similarly, in my
presence PW Qaiser have not made any identification of the
dead body in my presence before the police as well as
before the doctor....... I cannot say regarding the number of
people of locality who attracted to the spot after the
occurrence. Similarly, I cannot name any one among them
who attracted to the spot after the occurrence.” Qaiser

Khan PW-9 during his cross examination stated that; “....
13

that neither the time of occurrence was mentioned by me in
the police statement nor the object of our work is mentioned
on the spot. The deceased was not lifted by me or by my
uncle/complainant. I cannot say regarding the names of
those persons who lifted my deceased father from the
ground. Neither I verified the report of the complainant nor
identified the dead body of my father before the police or
before the doctor.” The deceased was real brother and
father of the eyewitnesses; albeit, the pronounced aspect of
the case is that neither, they had lifted the dead body of the
deceased from the spot; nor, could they name those persons
who attracted to the spot after the occurrence and; lifted the
dead body of the deceased to the police station; which in the
given circumstances is not appealable to a prudent mind;
being against the natural human conduct. Furthermore, both
the eyewitnesses in their respective statements have stated
that no firing was made upon them and only deceased was
fired at. It is also pertinent to mention that when both the
accused were duly armed with Kalashnikov; then why they
had not fired at the eyewitnesses; knowing well that they
would become witnesses of the occurrence and would
depose against them during the trial. On mere direct charge

of the appellant by the eyewitnesses without strong
14

corroboration of their testimony, conviction of the appellant

would be against the principles of administration of justice.

15. For maintaining conviction under capital charge,
evidence of unimpeachable character is required; which
lacks in the instant case. The prosecution miserably failed to
prove its case in the mode and manner as alleged and; upon
re-appraisal of the evidence, we have no hesitation in
holding that the occurrence was an unseen one and; the
attendance of both the PWs was procured later on, in order

to strengthen the case of the prosecution.

16. So far as, abscondence of the appellant is concerned,
it is settled law that mere abscondence of accused would not
be enough to sustain his conviction. Reliance is placed upon
the judgment rendered by the honorable Apex Court in
Muhammaad’s case (1986 SCMR 823). Since there is no
credible evidence to support the prosecution version, so
abscondence, itself, would not be sufficient to prove the

guilt of the accused.

17. In the circumstances, case of the prosecution is
pregnant with doubts and dents; benefit whereof shall go to
the appellant. We hold that the prosecution miserably failed
to prove its case against the appellant beyond reasonable

shadow of doubt. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed, the
impugned judgment dated 08.10.2020 passed by the learned
trial Court is set aside and the appellant is acquitted of the
charges leveled against him. He is in custody, be set free

forthwith if not required in any other case.

Above are the detailed reasons of short order of even

date.
