3. Murder reference has also been put up before

us for confirmation.

4. The story of prosecution as disclosed in the

FLLR Ex:PA may brietly be narrated as follows:

wh

On 14.01.2013 at 12.40 hours, the complainant
Mohi-ud-din alongwith Bakhtawar Jan in injured condition
and incorrect sen’ :s reportec' the matter to the incharge local
police at Emerpency Room of District Headquarter

Hospital, KDA Kurak, to the effect that at 11.45 hours, they

on their motorbike were going towards for condolence of

Molvi Muhammad Shafi Ahmad Khel when reached near
Mosque. village Kotay Kala Algadi, accused Aqal Zameer
alias Sarkay armed with Double Barrel shotgun was present
who on seeing. started firing at them with the intention to
kill us, as a result of which they both injured, while the
accused decamped from the spot. The occurrence was
witnessed by him and injured Bakhtawar Jan. No motive has

been alleged by the complainant in their report.

6. After writing report of the complainant, in

shape of Afurasila Ex: PW 7/1 it was read over and
explained to him. shia after admitting it to be correct signed
the same as a token of its correctness. The Murasila was
sent to the Police Station, which culminated into registration
of FIR Ex:PA. The report receiving officer, Namatullah
Khan SI. (PW-12) prepared injury sheet of both the injured
(Ex:PW 12/1 & Ex: PW12/2) and sent for medical
examination under the escort of Noor Aslam No.374 (PW-
3). Both the injured were medically examined vide medical
reports Ex:PW 1/3 and PW 1/1, while the condition of
injured Bakhtawar Jan was found serious, therefore, he was
referred to CMI Kohat, where he succumbed to the injuries
on 18.01.2013 at 1410 hours, therefore, section of law was
altered from 324 PPC to 302 PPC. Death certificate of
deceased Bakhtawar Jan is Ex:PW11/9, Raufullah S.1 (PW-
11) during investigation prepared the site plan (Ex:PB), took
into possession one Motorcycle No.LB-199 Yamaha, red

colour, blood stained white cap and blood stained chaddar,

belonging to injured- complainant, blood stained small

pebbles from the place of injured vide recovery Memo
Ex:PW 9/1. Two empties shells of 12 bore vide recovery
memo Ex. PW 2, The [O also took into possession the
blood stained garments of injured/ complainant vide
recovery memo Ex:PC and blood stained garments of
deceased including phial containing pellet recovered from
the body of deceased Ex:PW 10/1. The [O conducted raid at
the house of accused, who was not found, however, from
the residential room of accused/ convict a Double barrel
shotgun alongwith a bandolier containing 20 live rounds
was recovered, for which a separate case under section 13
AO was rewistered. Recovered blood stained garments as
well as articles were sent to FSL and report of FSL Ex:PW
11/3 and Ex: PW 11/6 were placed on file by the IO. The IO
recorded statements of PWs under section 161 Cr.PC and
alter completion of investigation submitted complete

challan for trial.

Ts For the commencement of trial, the learned

trial court complied with the provision of 205-C Cr.PC and
thereafter framed the charge against the appellant, to which
he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution in
order to prove guilt of appellant produced and examined as
many as wvelve (12) PWs. On close of prosecution
evidence, statement. of accused/appellant was recorded
under section 342 Cr.PC, wherein he professed his
innocence. however, he did not opt to be examined on oath.
The learned trial Court after hearing arguments of learned
counsel for the parties while holding guilty the appellant
convicted and sentence him vide impugned judgment as

referred above.

ie

We have heard arguments of learned counsel

for the panties and gone through the record of the case.

9. {t appears from the F.L.R (Ex: PA) that in this
case the occurrer ce took j lace on 14.01.2013 at 11.45

hours, whereas the report has been lodged on the same date

Laerie

Cite

at 12.40 hours. As per record, distance between the place of
occurrence and DMQ hospital, KDA, Karak where the
report has been lodged is about 15 K.M, hence, in view of
the facts and circumstances of the case, the report has been
lodged within reasonable time of one hour of the

occurrence.

10. The place of occurrence, as alleged by the

complainant, is ¢

blished by the recoveries of two 12 bore,
empties trom the places of the appellant-convict, recovery
of blood stained Chader, a cape, blood stained pebbles, and
a motoreyele No.199/LM, Yamaha, red colour, vide
recovery Memo Ex: PW 9/1, during spot inspection by the
1.0, While the defence has neither challenged the venue of
occurrence during the trial nor any argument has been
advanced on this aspect of the case. Besides that, the FSL
report is also in line in this regard that these were fired from
12 bore DBBL Shotgun No. B 2640, recovered from the

house of appellint/ convict. So by this recovery, it

U5

169

Che

oiGie

established that the assailant was the conviet/ appellant,

present at the spot.

lt. Now the question is left that whether the
complainant was present with the deceased at the time of
occurrence or not? According to the complainant's version,
he was proceeding for offering Fatiha in company of
deceased on motoreyele on the demise of Molvi Muhammad
Shafi Ahmed Khel, when they reached at the place of
occurrence, the appellant convict fired at them, as a result
of which both were hit and sustained injuries, while
Bakhtawar Jan lateron succumbed. FSL report regarding
blood stained pebbles from the place of occurrence, as well
as blood stained garments of the injured/ complainant and
deceased. establizhed that the complainant as well as
deceased were present at the spot. Learned counsel for
appellant could ne bring on record or even rebut the stance
that they were not present at the spot, so there is no reason

to disbelieve this version of the complainant unless there are

Pa)

w™
Ss

170

some compelling or reasonable circumstances to disbelieve

their presence.

1s Besides, it is undisputed that wives of both the

complainant and deceased Bakhtawar Jan were sisters inter
se and the deceased having blood feud with the appellant,
While complainant having neither any motive, nor any blood
feud with the appellant. Thus there is no reason to lalsely
implicate the appellant. [It is also unbelievable that the
complainant would substitute the appellant with the real
culprit by charging him falsely. Even otherwise, substitution
for the real culprits is a rare phenomenon, because nobody
would spare the actual culprits for such a heinous crime and

would falsely implicate an innocent person and that too,

when there is no previous enmity.

13. The complainant Mohi-ud-Din injured as per FIR

is the star eye-witness of the occurrence, who during the

occurrence also received injuries and his presence at the spot

mt Barris

Ge

al

has also been proved as discussed above. He narrated the same

facts, aS mentioned in the FIR,

14. Learned counsel for appellant was of the view
that the complainant in his statement made iapraneonenes; as
that “when he saw the accused aiming with his double barrel
shot gun at them, he nuned back the motorcycle” and secondly
“PW Mst. Khalida Nasreen was not mentioned as witness in
the FIR and her statement w/s 161 Cr.PC was recorded by LO

afterward who also witnessed the occurrence are

improvements.”

n

No doubt, this part of the statement has not been
mentioned in the FIR, but this fact does not shatter the entire
Prosecution case, as the fact alleged in his statement
corroborate the medical and circumstantial evidence, if at least,
its benefit extendec to the appellant, it may be considered a
mitigating circumstance in his favour,

16. So lar as witnessing of the occurrence, by Mst.
Khalida Nasreen, wife of deceased is concerned. Statedly she

was standing near the door of her house, from where she saw

Zi ibpt ¢ ‘our,
Anos Resch

arn
~

172

the occurrence which took place near Hujra adjacent to their

house and the complainant and deceased, then injured, were
taken to the hosp-tal from the place of occurrence, there is
Strong presumption that he (complainant) might have not seen
Mst. Khalida Nasreen that he was Witnessing the occurrence
behind them, hence his name is omitted in the FIR. Hence,
such omission is also not fatal to the case of prosecution.
Statements of both the eye-witnesses are in line with the
prosecution story, corroborating each other on other facts and
circumstances of the case and both were subjected to lengthy
and searching cross-examination. If statement of one witness
Mst. Khalida Nasreen is discarded, then too case against the
appellant is proved by cogent, reliable, trustworthy and natural
evidence of complainant, the eye-witness. In case titled,
“Khurshid Vs The State” PLD 1996 S C, 305, in Paragraph

No.1 1, the Hon"ble Supreme Court observed as follows:-

“The Court’s approach, while
appraising the evidence, should be

dynamic and not static. It should keep in

i

view all the facts and circumstances of
the case and if it is Satisfied that

‘ Ct
factually the person charged with the rt

offence has committed the same, it
should record the conviction though
there might have been some technical
lapses on the part of the investigating
agency/prosecution, Provided the same
have not prejudiced the accused in the
Sair trial, The People are losing Saith in
the criminal judicial system for the
reason that in most of the criminal cases

the criminals Set away without being

punished on technicalities”,

17, We are of the view that guilt of the appellant

has been proved Irom the confidence inspiring testimony of

the eye-witnesses, Which lends Support from the site plan,

recovery memos, pitticularly, recovery of crime Weapon

from the residential house of the appellant and report of

experts. It is a case of single accused and in the

circumstances, it js highly improbable to say that the

appellant has been substituted with the real culprit and thus

We have no doubt in our mind that the charge against the

appellant has been proved beyond any shadow of doubt and

that he has rightiy been convicted.

18. Now the question for determination of this
court is as to what was the quantum of sentence and whether

penalty of death would meet the ends of justice?

19. According to the F.1.R, appellant Aqal Zameer,
made firing at the complainant and as well as on Bakhtawar
Jan, as a result of which both sustained injuries, while later on
Bakhtawar Jan succumbed to his injuries. Medical report of
both the injured as well as deceased are placed on file, while
after death of Bakhtawar Jan, his death certificate has been
brought on record, while his post mortem report is not
available as he died in Combined Military Hospital Kohat and
only non-availability of Post Mortem report does not entitle
accused/appellant for his acquittal particularly in view of the

medical reports as well as ocular account. Keeping it as a

. mitigating circumstance into consideration, we are not

inclined to maintain the sentence of death of the appellant but

176

= [efi

are of the view that sentence of life shall be sufficient to meet
the ends of justice.

20. We thus as discussed above, while maintaining
the conviction of appellant under section 302 (b) P.P.C.
commute the sentence of death to imprisonment for life. The
other sentences shall remain intact. Benefit of section 382-B

Cr.P.C. shall also be extended to the appellant.

18. With above modification, we dismiss the
appeal of the app: Hant-convict and the Murder Reference is

answered in negative as death sentence is not confirmed.
