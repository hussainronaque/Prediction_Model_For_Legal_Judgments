LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- Through this
judgment, we shall also decide Cr.A.No.
367-P/2014 and Cr.R.No.25-P/2014 as all
the three matters have arisen out of the
common judgment dated 11.02.2014 of the
learned Sessions Judge, Swabi delivered in
case FIR No.378 dated 16.6.2006 u/s
302/324/427/34 PPC of Police Station, Topi

District Swabi.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on
16.6.2006, complainant Sultan Sher (PW-9)
lodged a report at police station, Topi to the
effect that he, his deceased son Islam Sher
and nephew Sher Ahmad Khan were
coming home on an earth loaded trolley

pulled by tractor. He and Sher Ahmad Khan
were sitting in the trolley while his son was
driving the tractor. No sooner than they
reached near Government High School
Zarobi, there Waheedullah (absconder) and
Mehbooullah (the appellant), were standing
duly armed with lethal weapons, who fired at
them with which his son was hit and died on
the spot while he and nephew Sher Ahmad
Khan escaped unhurt. Motive for the offence

was stated to be previous blood feud.

3. After arrest of the appellant, complete
challan was put in court where he was
indicted for the crime to which he pleaded
not guilty and opted to face the trial.
Prosecution in order to prove its case
examined 11 witnesses —_ whereafter
statement of the accused was recorded,
wherein, he professed his innocence. The
learned trial court, after conclusion of the
trial, found the appellant guilty of the charge
and while recording his conviction u/s 302 (b)
PPC _ sentenced him to rigorous
imprisonment for life and with fine of
Rs.2,00,000/- or in default whereof to further
suffer simple imprisonment of one year. The
appellant was also directed to pay

compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- to the legal
heirs of the deceased. The learned trial
court further convicted him u/s 427 PPC with
a sentence of two years rigorous
imprisonment with a fine of Rs.25,000/- or in
default to pay the fine to further undergo six
months S.l. however, the appellant was
acquitted of the charge u/s 324 PPC. Benefit

u/s 382-b Cr.P.C. was extended to him.

4. Appellant has impugned his
conviction and sentence, the State has
preferred its appeal against acquittal of the
appellant u/s 324 PPC’ while the
complainant has filed criminal revision for
enhancement of the awarded sentence from
imprisonment of life to the normal penalty of

death.

5. Learned counsel for the appellant-
convict contended that none of the two
eyewitnesses was present on the spot when
the occurrence had taken place and that
attendance of both the eyewitnesses was
procured subsequently. The learned counsel
further contended that the version given in
the FIR has been negated by medical
examination of the deceased and also by
site plan of the case. It was also argued by

the learned counsel that the unnatural
conduct of both the eyewitnesses shows
their non-presence on the spot at the time of
occurrence. The learned counsel lastly
argued that motive, as given in the FIR, has

nothing to do with the appellant-convict.

6. As against the above, learned
counsel for the complainant and the learned
AAG argued that the prosecution has proved
its case through trustworthy and confidence
inspiring evidence. They further argued that
for no valid reason lesser penalty has been
given to the convict, which needs
enhancement. The learned AAG also
entreated for conviction of the convict

u/s 324 PPC.

7. We have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the parties and with their
valuable assistance examined the case

record.

8. In support of the prosecution case,
complainant and eyewitness Sher Ahmad
Khan appeared before the learned trial court
as PW-9 and PW-10. Both have deposed
that on the fateful day they were bringing
earth in trolley, tugged by tractor, driven by
his son Islam Sher, wherein, they were

sitting. According to the eyewitnesses, as
they reached the spot there, they were fired
at by the appellant and absconding accused
Waheedullah with which Islam Sher was hit
and died on the spot while they escaped
unhurt. Escaping unhurt from the volleys of
Klashinkoves fired from a minimum distance
of 10 and maximum 30 paces excludes the
presence of both the eyewitnesses on the
spot at the time of occurrence. Had they
been present on the spot, both of them must
have sustained firearm injuries on_ their
bodies. It is not the prosecution’s case that
one, two or few shots were fired. According
to the medical examination, the deceased
has sustained five entry and three superficial
wounds on different parts of his body. Not
only the multiple injuries, which the
deceased has suffered, the Investigating
Officer has collected 41 empties from the
crime spot. As, according to the site plan,
the deceased and both the eyewitnesses
were in close proximity with each other,
therefore, there was no chance for PW-9
and PW-10 to escape unhurt particularly
when they were sitting on the earth dumped
in the trolley and were visible to the accused.
Even, if presence of both the eyewitnesses

on the spot at the time of firing is presumed.
even then it cannot be said that whatever
they deposed was the whole truth and our
this conclusion gets support from the site
plan and medical examination of the
deceased. According to the site plan
(Ex.PB), the appellant has been shown at
point No.4, which is towards the southern
side of the deceased and thus by this way
right side of the deceased was exposed to
him. But according to the medical
examination (Ex.PM), the deceased has
suffered 4 entry wounds on left side of his
body, which aspect of the case falsifies the
ocular account qua firing at the deceased by
the appellant. No doubt, on the eve of firing,
it would be natural for a victim to change his
side as he is not a statue but while sitting on
a driving seat and that too of a tractor, it is
not expected from the driver to change his
position as freely as is done by a man when
he is attacked while walking or sitting in
some open space, so the medical evidence
and site plan, being circumstantial evidence,
have falsified the ocular evidence furnished
by both the eyewitnesses qua the present

appellant.
9. Another important aspect of the case
is that regarding the 41 crime empties
recovered from the spot, there is no FSL
report to show that whether same were fired
from two weapons as is alleged. As two
persons have been charged for firing,
therefore, the Investigating Officer was
supposed to get a laboratory report to show
that more than one weapons were used in
the offence. Getting no report to the ibid
effect from FSL has caused colossal
damage to the prosecution’s case for which

it shall suffer.

10. Furthermore, motive for causing
murder of the deceased too does not relate
to the appellant. It is worth to mention that
in cross-examination, complainant has
admitted it correct that the appellant had no
enmity with them. In absence of any enmity
and motive of the appellant with the
deceased, his firing at the victim as alleged

does not appeal to prudent mind.

11. | Thorough and careful examination of
the case record would show that neither
medical evidence nor site plan of the case
have supported the prosecution’s case qua

the appellant for his involvement in the case
nor the ocular account furnished by PW-9
and PW-10 against him is trustworthy,
therefore, we hold that the prosecution has
failed to bring home guilt to the appellant-
accused. It is well settled that in order to
record conviction of an accused, the
prosecution has to prove its case beyond all
reasonable doubts, which is hallmark of
criminal jurisprudence. It is also a century
old principle of criminal law that a slightest
doubt arising in the prosecution case is
sufficient to record acquittal of the accused,
which principle fully applies to the instant

case in respect of the appellant.

12. True that the appellant after his
nomination in the case as accused has
remained outlaw for a considerable period of
time but mere abscondance of an accused,
as has been held umpteenth times by the
superior courts, alone is not enough to hold
a person guilty of offence unless charge
against him is established through concrete
evidence, which is not the case in hand,
therefore, no importance could be attached

to the appellant's abscondance.

13. For what has been discussed above,

this appeal is allowed, the impugned
judgment is set aside and the appellant is
acquitted of the charges leveled against him.
He be set free forthwith, if not required to be

detained in any other case.

14. Above are the reasons of our short

order of even date, which reads as under:-

“For the reasons to be recorded
later, this appeal is allowed,
conviction and sentence recorded
by learned Sessions Judge, Swabi
vide judgment dated 11.02.2014 is
set aside. The appellant is
acquitted of the charge leveled
against him and he be set free

forthwith, if not required in any

other case”.
