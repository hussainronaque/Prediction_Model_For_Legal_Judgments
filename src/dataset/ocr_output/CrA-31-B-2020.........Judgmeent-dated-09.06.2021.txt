JUDGMENT

ee

SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, _J.- Through the instant

criminal appeal, the appellant (Ali Nawaz) has’ called into
question the judgment dated 20.02.2020, rendered by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-III/MCTC, Lakki Marwat, in case
FIR No.266 dated 28.5.2017, under sections 302/34 PPC,
Police Station Ghazni Khel (District Lakki Marwat), whereby
the appellant has been convicted under Section 302(b) PPC
and awarded death sentence for committing Qatl-i-Amd of
deceased Farmanullah, burdened with payment of Rs.
10,00,000/-(rupees ten‘ lac) as compensation under Section

544-A Cr.P.C to the legal heirs of deceased, recoverable as
arrears of land revenue or owing to want of property or in
default thereof, to undergo six months simple imprisonment.
The appellant was directed to be hanged by the neck till
confirmation of his death by the Medical Officer in presence
of Judicial Magistrate on duty in Jail, however, ‘subject to
confirmation by this Court.

2. The prosecution story, as disclosed in the first
information report (F.I-R), in brief, is that on 28.5.2017 at
12:00 hours, complainant Qismatullah (PW-6) brought the
dead body of his brother Farmanullah, in a private Datsun to
the Police Station Ghazni Khel where he reported the matter
to the effect that on the same day, he and his brother
Farmanullah were sitting under the “keekar’/acacia tree
outside their house, meanwhile, Ali Nawaz and Haq Nawaz
sons of Muhammad Nawaz, came there on a motorbike driven
by accused Haq Nawaz, whereas accused Ali Nawaz was
sitting behind him, duly armed with repeater .12 bore shotgun;
both the accused came down from the motorcycle and
accused Ali Nawaz aimed his repeater upon him (complainant)
and forcibly took his brother Farmanullah and fled away on
said motorcycle; that he alongwith his another brother namely
Irfanullah also went behind them on a motorcycle and when

both the accused reached in the vacant field near their house,
_ they ‘deboarded Farmanullah from their motorcycle and at

about 11:15 am, accused Ali Nawaz made firing upon
Farmanullah with his repeater, resultantly, his brother
Farmanullah got hit and fell down to the ground. It is further
in the report that complainant party could do nothing being

empty handed and accused decamped from the spot after

- commission of the occurrence. When they attended their

brother, he had succumbed to his injuries. Motive for the
offence was stated to be exchange of hot words in football
game few days before the occurrence, hence, the instant FIR.
Nizam Khan ASI (PW-4) registered the case vide FIR
Ex.PA. PW-4 also prepared injury sheet and inquest report of
the deceased and sent the dead body to the doctor for
postmortem examination under the escort of constable
Waheed Khan No.62 (PW-1).
3. After completion of investigation, prosecution
submitted complete challan under Section 512 Cr.P.C against
both the accused, however, later on accused Ali Nawaz was
arrested and his supplementary challan was submitted, while
the other co-accused remained fugitive from law. Accused Ali
Nawaz being in custody was produced before the Court from
Jail; and after complying with the provision of section 265-C

Cr.P.C, he was charge sheeted on 12.12.2017, to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution in order
to prove its case, produced and examined as many as nine (9)
witnesses, whereafter, the accused was examined under
Section 342-Cr.P.C, wherein he professed innocence and false
implication, however, he did not wish to be examined on oath
as provided under section 340(2) Cr.P.C, nor opted to produce
evidence in his defence. After hearing the arguments from
both the sides, the learned trail. Court vide impugned
judgment dated 20.02.2020, convicted the accused under
Section 302(b) PPC and sentenced him, as mentioned above,
hence, this appeal.

4. The learned counsel for the parties alongwith
Additional Advocate-General representing the State were
heard at length and with their valuable assistance, the record
was gone through.

5. The unfortunate incident claimed the life of
deceased Farmanullah and the matter was reported by the
complainant at Police Station Ghazni Khel, bringing a charge
against the appellant and another. The motive was stated to be
an early altercation between the parties in football ground.

6. The appellant after his arrest faced trial and it
was on conclusion of the trial that, he was awarded death

sentence. No doubt, the trial Court took pains to appreciate
the evidence on file, but keeping in view the gravity of the
awarded sentence, we deem it appropriate to re-appraise the
collected evidence on file. Though the learned trial Court
went in detailed discussion of the evidence collected, the
recoveries effected from the spot, the manner in which the
incident occurred and the seat of injuries on the body of the
deceased, yet this Court being the Court of appeal is under
heavy obligation to apply its judicial mind to the collected
evidence so to avoid miscarriage of justice. This Court is to
see as to whether the incident occurred in the mode, manner
and at the stated time. We are to assess the presence of the
witnesses on the spot, their reaction to the events and their
subsequent conduct. There is no denial to the fact that in
criminal cases, behaviour and conduct of the witnesses and
that of the accused play a vital role, which cannot be lightly
ignored.

7. The incident occurred in front of the house of
the deceased and complainant, when they were sitting under
the shade of acacia tree. It is alleged that the appellant and
absconding co-accused arrived while riding their motorcycle,
the appellant was armed with a repeater 12-bore occupying
the pillion, whereas the absconding co-accused was driving.

The report contains that the complainant was stopped to move
ry

as the gun was aimed at him, the deceased was made to sit on
motorcycle and they drove away. It was allegedly on arrival
of eyewitness Irfan with his motorcycle from the house that
they chased the accused. The report further tells that when
they reached to the football ground, situated in front of the
house of the accused, the deceased was deboarded and fired at.
We cannot ignore the inter se relation of the complainant, the
deceased and the emotional attachment of an elder brother
with the youngest, who is hardly fifteen. The complainant is
to tell that why he did not resist the use of force by the
appellant to take the deceased, that too, on a motorcycle and
that, despite ample opportunities, no efforts were made to
overpower the appellant, especially, when the appellant was
holding the deceased, . while riding the motorcycle. The
complainant appeared before the trial Court and was
examined as PW-6, who stated that soon after the deceased
was taken on motorcycle, PW_ Irfan brought out his
motorcycle from the house, he narrated the story to him and
they started to chase. The conduct of the complainant is
unnatural, had he been present, instead of narrating the story
to his brother, he would follow in haste to rescue his brother.
The complainant stated that it was few days earlier that an

altercation took place between them, this portion of his:
statement puts us on guard that, why the youngest was
selected and that why, being the eldest, he was afforded an
opportunity to live.

8. If we admit what the complainant stated to be
correct, then what prompted the appellant to fire at the
deceased and not the complainant, while fully armed and that
why the appellant ran the risk to transport the accused to the
place situated in front of his house. What a coincidence this
was that the deceased was fired at, when the complainant and
eyewitness reached to the spot.

9. _ This is surprising that the inter se distance
between the assailants and the complainant party has been
shown as less than seven (7) feet, but neither the complainant
nor the eyewitness made any efforts to rescue their brother
from the firing made by the appellant. We are yet to know
that why the appellant did not kill the complainant and the
eyewitness, as it was in the statement of the complainant that
a few days back an altercation took place between them and
the accused. The conduct displayed by the complainant is
unnatural on one hand, whereas on the other, he is struggling
hard to establish his presence on the spot. We are eager to
know that what the appellant wanted to achieve by bringing

the deceased just in front of their house and to kill him. Had
this been the motive, the accused would have easily achieved
their target in front of the house of the complainant instead of
shifting the deceased to the spot.

10. There is no denial to the fact that both, the
complainant and the eyewitness were laborers and working in
the brick kiln of one Karim Khan and this is on record that the
distance between the place of occurrence and place of their
business is not more than two (2) kilometers. The
complainant, who was examined as PW-6, stated that after
receiving firearm injuries, the deceased fell to the ground and
survived for five minutes; and the accused decamped from the
spot. Though it has been stated that the cot was arranged from
the nearby house but the complainant categorically stated that
neither he nor the eyewitness helped in shifting the dead body
of the deceased from the ground to the cot, which ‘conduct
does not appeal to a prudent mind, as in that eventuality the
real brothers would have attracted to the dead body soon after
the incident and thereafter. This part of the statement of the
complainant gives inference that he was not present on the
spot at the time of incident and soon thereafter.

11. The dead body was shifted to the local police
station where the matter was reported by the complainant and

verified by the eyewitness. The injury sheet and the inquest
a

report were prepared after registration of the case, but
surprisingly, the inquest report does not bear the FIR number
and the sections of law. It invites our attention that when the
report was made at the police station in the shape of first
information report, then why the inquest report is lacking the
FIR number and the relevant sections of law, it cannot be
interpreted in any other way, but that the matter was not
reported in the mode and manner. Another important aspect
of the case, which puts this Court.on guard, is the manner in
which the dead body of the deceased after making the report
was shifted to the hospital for postmortem examination. There
is no denial to the fact that both, the complainant and
eyewitness are real brothers of the deceased but for no valid
reasons they did not accompany the dead body of. the
deceased to the hospital. The witnesses were examined on this
particular aspect of the case, where they explained that soon
after making the report they left the police station for their
house with the only purpose to associate the Investigating
Officer during spot proceedings. The Investigating Officer
was examined as PW-8, who stated that after registration of
the case, copy of the FIR was handed over to him for the
purpose of investigation, and while leaving the police station,

he did not notice the complainant and eyewitness with the
‘A.

dead body. This portion of the statement of the Investigating
Officer indicatés that by the time he was leaving the police
station, the dead body was lying there and if we take what the
Investigating Officer stated to be correct, then in that
eventuality, the complainant and the eyewitness must have
been present with the dead body. This explanation by the
Investigating Officer further overshadows the presence of the
witnesses at the time the dead body was brought to the police
station.

12. The witnesses are yet to explain that who, out of
the two i.e. complainant and eyewitness accompanied the
dead body from the police station to the hospital and, as to
who identified the dead body before scribe at the time the
report was made and before the doctor at the time of
postmortem examination. The complainant when appeared
before the trial Court stated that he in the company of his
brother ic. PW Irfan after making the report came to their
house and from their house they went to the spot for spot
pointation on arrival of the Investigating Officer. He further
stated that initially the eyewitness was present at the time of
spot pointation, and thereafter he went to the hospital after the
dead body. ‘This portion of the statement is hard to be

believed, as once the witnesses did not opt to accompany the
dead body from the police station to the hospital then what
urgency was there for the eyewitness to go to the hospital,
that too, at a belated stage. Another intriguing aspect of the
case is that if the statement of complainant is taken to be
correct regarding the presence of the eyewitness at the time of
spot pointation, then how his name finds mention in the
column of identification at the time of postmortem
examination. ‘When the statement of both the witnesses are
read in juxtaposition, the two contradicted each other to a
greater extent, as the complainant stated that they both
pointed out the spot to the Investigating Officer and that the
recoveries were effected from the spot in their presence, but
the eyewitness when appeared before the trial Court, he
categorically stated that he was not present with the
Investigating Officer and the complainant at the time of spot
pointation. He admits his subsequent arrival to the spot. The
overall impact of the statements of the witnesses gives an
impression, that the witnesses, more particularly, the
eyewitness Irfan was not present on the spot. The presence of
the witnesses is further doubted from the fact that instead of
absence at the time of postmortem examination, the doctor
mentioned his name in the column of identification, this

aspect of the case leads this Court nowhere but that the
postmortem examination was conducted earlier to the report
made; and so the inquest report was prepared and, we cannot
refrain ourselves from holding that preliminary investigation
was made in-the case.

In case titled “Javaid Akbar Vs. Muhammad

Amjad_and_ Jameel @ Jeela_ and another” (016 SCMR

1241), it was held that:-

Both these eye-witnesses were closely
related to the complainant party and have
given reasons of their presence of having
visited the father who was admitted in
Civil Hospital, Okara, but no
documentary proof of admission of father
and discharge from the Hospital was
produced. The appellate Court also
seriously doubted the presence of eye-
witnesses at the spot for the reason that
while Shakir Akbar was dead and Naveed
Akhtar was in injured condition, none of
the PWs had cared to carry Naveed
Akhtar, injured, to the Hospital rather the
complainant/PW-8 proceeded to Police
Station for registration of FIR. Even the
Driver of private car, who was a witness,
was not produced either during
investigation or trial to support the
prosecution version so much so that his
name was also not disclosed.

13. The prevailing circumstances put this Court on
guard regarding presence of the witnesses on the spot at the
time of report and even the atmosphere created compels us to
assess the manner in which the report was made.

14. The Investigating Officer was examined as PW-
8, who stated that while leaving the police station for the spot,

he did not see the complainant and eyewitness present in the
police station alongwith the dead body. When the
Investigating Officer could not observe the presence of the
witnesses in the concerned police station when the dead body
by then was present, then no other inference can be drawn but
that the complainant and the eyewitness did not accompany
the dead body from the spot to the police station. While
reading the cross examination of the complainant we got
surprised when he replied to a question, that the Datsun
Pickup was arranged by his maternal uncle, but in the same
breath he stated that he did not know his exact name, however,
the people used to call him “Lalo Spud”, This is surprising that
on one hand the complainant admitted the person who
arranged the Datsun Pickup to be his maternal uncle whereas,
on the other, he did not know his exact name. This tells that
even the complainant did not witness that who brought the
Datsun Pickup, to shift the dead body to the police station.

15. It finds mention in the record that the
complainant and eyewitness went to the police station on the
motorcycle, which they were in possession at the time of
incident, and they came back to their house using the same,
but astonishingly the same was not produced before the

Investigating Officer either in the police station or on the spot
during the spot pointation. Its belated production leads to an
inference that it was nothing but an attempt to heal the defects.
16. The Investigating Officer visited the spot and
during spot pointation collected blood stained earth from the
place of the deceased alongwith an empty of .12 bore and its
remainings but, the Investigating Officer did not associate any
independent witness while effecting the recoveries from the
spot. Even the Investigating Officer did not record the
statement of the inmates of the surrounding houses to confirm
the occurrence at the stated time and at the stated place. The
presence of complainant and the eyewitness with the
Investigating Officer on the spot during spot pointation is not
established from record, as regarding the presence of the
eyewitness i.e. Irfan, the complainant put forward different
explanation during his cross-examination he stated that when
the Investigating Officer approached to the spot for
investigation, he alongwith the eyewitness reached to the spot
and on their pointation the recoveries were effected and the
site plan was prepared, he further explained that lateron the
eyewitness left the spot for the hospital. Contrarily, the
eyewitness who was examined as PW-7 stated that he was not
present at the time of spot pointation and that he attracted

jateron to the spot, when these statements are read together,
we can gather an impression that there was a conscious
attempt on part of the complainant to make us believe that
both of them were present at the time of incident, at the time
of report and at the time of spot pointation. We cannot ignore
the statement of PW Irfan who himself negated his presence
at the time of spot pointation. The cumulative effect of what
has been stated, above takes us nowhere, but to hold that the
witnesses were not present at the time of incident and that the
report was not made in the manner, rather the dead body was
shifted from the spot by the co-villagers to the police station
and on arrival of the complainant, the matter was reported.
One of the witness categorically stated that the distance
between police station and hospital is about 10/11 kilometers,
if so, then it is for the prosecution to explain that when the
matter was already reported at 12:30 pm, then why the dead
body was produced to the doctor at 2:37 pm, after a
considerable delay of two (2) hours, but the prosecution could
not explain the same. The belated examination of the dead
body strengthens our belief regarding the absence of
witnesses, and their conduct. It spells out from record that
both i.e. the complainant and the eyewitness were working in
the brick kiln of one Karim Khan and a particular question

was asked in this respect, to which the witnesses confirmed.
The record is silent and even the statements of the witnesses
to give an otherwise explanation regarding their presence at
home on the day and at the time of incident, in such
eventuality, we lurk no doubt in mind that the witnesses were
present in the brick kiln in connection of their routine work.
The prosecution story receives another blow when the
complainant stated that he did not identify the dead body of
the deceased before the scribe.

In case titled “Basharat Ali Vs. Muhammad
Safdar and another” (2017 SCMR 1661), it was held that:-

“Keeping in view the above bulk of
contradictions in the statements of the
PWs., the prosecution's story cannot be
believed and that too when the same has
been disbelieved to the extent of all the
acquitted co-accused as such Respondent
No.1 has rightly been acquitted by the
High Court through the impugned
judgment. In criminal cases if material
contradictions are found in the statements
of the witnesses the benefit thereof would
go to the accused party.”

17, The Investigating Officer though investigated
the matter from different angles, but he did not take pains to
collect any evidence in respect of the alleged motive. Though
he visited the spot but he did not record the statements of any
independent witness regarding the altercation between the
parties, few days earlier to the incident. The complainant

while reporting the matter stated that the altercation took
place in the football ground, but he himself could not produce
any witness who was present at the time of altercation in the
ground. What we can gather is that, the motive is afterthought,
with an attempt to connect the appellant with the commission
of the offence. True that absence or weakness of motive
cannot be taken into consideration as a sole factor to discredit
the prosecution and to disbelieve the charge, but equally true
that once a motive is alleged then the prosecution is duty
bound to establish the same, failing which no one else but the
prosecution will suffer. Yes, every criminal case has its own
peculiar circumstances; and these are the facts of every
criminal case which need an independent application of mind;
and that the common approach and single yardstick for all
criminal cases, to be treated in the same fashion, will give
birth to drastic results. In every criminal case, the set of
circumstances are altogether different and such is the
behaviour of the people involved. In the peculiar
circumstances of the present case, as the motive was the sole
urging factor so, in case of presence of the complainant and
his brother PW-Irfan, the youngest brother i.e. the deceased,
would not have been alone, the target. After scanning the
record we could not come across any substantial evidence on

the file, which could convince us regarding the motive and its
aftermath. We are not hesitant to hold that the prosecution
could not establish the motive on record and in such
eventuality, it is the prosecution to reap the harvest.

In case titled “Hakim Ali Vs. The State" (1971
SCMR-432), it was held that the prosecution though not
called upon to establish motive in every case, yet once it has
setup a motive and failed to establish, the prosecution must
suffer consequences and not the defence. The above view has

been reiterated in the case of "Amin Ullah Vs. The State"

(PLD_1976 SC _629), wherein, it was observed by their
lordships, that motive ts an important constituent and if found
by the Court to be untrue, the Court should be on guard to
accept the prosecution story.

18. | After thoroughly evaluating the evidence
available on- file, we feel no hesitation in concluding that the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case against
accused/appellant beyond any reasonable doubt and the
learned trial Court has not appreciated the evidence in its true
perspective and fell into error by convicting the accused.
Resultantly, this appeal is allowed, the conviction and
sentence of the appellant recorded by learned trial Court is

set-aside and he is acquitted of the charge by extending him
- the benefit of doubt, he shall be released forthwith from jail, if
not required to be detained in connection with any other case.
19. As we have acquitted the appellant from the
charge, therefore, the Murder Reference No.03-B of 2020,

sent by learned Trial Court, is answered in the negative.

20. Above are the detailed reasons of short order of
even date.
