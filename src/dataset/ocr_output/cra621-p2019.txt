Shahzad vs. Akhtar Ali

JUDGMENT
Date of hearing: 27.07.2022
Appellant (s): by: Mr. Naveed Magsood Sethi,
Advocate
State by: Mr. Babar Shehzad, AAG
Complainant by: Mr. Asfandyar Yousafzai,
Advocate
Dr. Khurshid Iqbal, J.- Through this Criminal Appeal,

Shahzad son of Muhammad Amin (the appellant-accused) has
challenged the judgment of learned Additional Sessions
Judge-III, Mardan dated 07.05.2019, whereby, vide case FIR
No. 418 dated 26.05.2013 u/s 302, 449, 34 PPC, Police Station
Hoti, Mardan, he was convicted under section 302 (b), PPC,
and sentenced to life imprisonment as Tazir with a fine of
Rs.5,00,000/-, to be paid to the legal heirs of the deceased as
compensation within the meaning of section 544-A ,Cr.P.C.;
under section 449 PPC, he was sentenced to rigorous
imprisonment for five years with fine of Rs.1,00,000/-.

2. Briefly stated facts of the case are that complainant
Akhtar Ali reported the matter in the casualty hospital
Mardan, where the dead body of his brother Liaqat Ali was

lying. The complainant stated in his report that on 25.05.2013,
2

the eventful day, he, along with his brother Liaqat Ali
(deceased), was present in his house. In the meanwhile,
accused Jehad (absconding accused) and Shahzad (the present
appellant) duly armed with firearms, entered their house and
swiftly started firing at his brother Liagat Ali, as a result of
which he was hit and died on the spot. After the occurrence,
the accused decamped from the spot. However, being empty
handed, he could do nothing. Motive behind the occurrence
was that half an hour prior to the occurrence, a verbal
altercation has taken place between the deceased and the
present appellant. The occurrence was witnessed by
complainant, Mst. Amtari Bibi, his mother and other inmates
of the house. The report of the complainant was reduced in the
form of a Murasila (Ex.PA/1) by Muhammad Arif, IHC, on
the basis of which the case was registered.

3. After completion of investigation, complete challan
within the meaning of section 512 Cr.P.C. was submitted
against the accused. Later, after the arrest of present appellant-
accused, supplementary challan was submitted against him.
Charge was framed against him, to which he pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial. To prove its case, the prosecution
examined as many as eleven witnesses. After closure of the
prosecution evidence, statement of appellant-accused was
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C. wherein he denied the

allegations and professed his innocence. On conclusion of
trial, the learned trial Court, convicted the appellant-accused
as mentioned in the first para of this judgment, whereas,
declared co-accused Jehad as proclaimed offender.

4. | We have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the
appellant, as well as learned A.A.G, assisted by learned
counsel for the complainant and perused the record with their
valuable assistance.

5. The prosecution case significantly hinges on the ocular
account which Akhtar Ali (complainant/PW3), Mst. Amthari
(PW2) and Mst. Gul Naz (PW3) furnished at the trial. These
PWs are brother, mother and sister of the deceased,
respectively. In their statements recorded in examination-in-
chief they deposed that the appellant and other co-accused
having firearm weapons entered their house, opened fire at
Liaqat Ali (deceased) which resulted in the death of Liaqat
Ali. They further deposed that the firing took place in their
presence at the relevant time. While disclosing the motive,
they stated that on the eventful day, the deceased had an
altercation in a wedding with the accused. The ocular account
could be decisively seen from two perspectives: first, the
presence of the eye witnesses on the spot; and, second, the
entry of the appellant (and non else) duly armed with firearm
weapon in the house of the complainant party with the

intention to commit murder.
4

6. First, we would examine the issue of presence of the
eye witnesses. Admittedly, the occurrence has taken place
inside the house of the complainant at Asr time, and the eye
witnesses are the residents of the house, therefore, in the
normal course, their presence at the place of the occurrence
cannot be doubted. The eye witnesses unanimously confirmed
in their cross examination that they as well as the deceased
were present in their house. The complainant (PW3) and Mst.
Amthari (PW4), his mother, were asked about the jobs of the
complainant and the deceased with a view to establish that
they were not supposed to be there. PW3 replied that the he
was running a tailoring shop and the deceased, a grocery shop,
in their village bazaar. PW4 replied that the complainant and
the deceased were doing labour job and they used to work as
masons during the days of the occurrence. The question is that
of their presence on the spot and an affirmative answer has
come. As regards, the job they were doing, no doubt there is a
discrepancy in the statements of PW-3 and PW-4, however,
this is not material. The primary fact is her presence on the
spot which was not shattered. PW-4 is an old lady, apparently
illiterate, as such, it could not be expected of her to know the
exact nature of the work her sons were doing for their
livelihood. Such a statement of PW-4 could not be termed as
false. The evidence also reflects that there was a marriage

ceremony in the locality and at the time of rukhsati (called
“Janj” in Pashto) an altercation took place between the
deceased and the appellant which triggered the occurrence.
Moreover, the time of the occurrence is evening, a time on
which ordinarily people rush back to their homes from
whatever jobs they do. Thus, the plea that the deceased and the
complainant were not supposed to be present in their house
does not stand to reason.

7. Another aspect of the presence of the eye witnesses the
defence challenged was the presence of the particular persons
in the house. In the murasila, the presence was shown by
stating the words “deegar ahl-e-khana”. PW4 has confirmed
this fact in his examination-in-chief that he had stated the
words “other family members.” While under cross
examination, he stated that he had mentioned the name of his
sister Gul Naz (PW-6). However, when confronted, it was
found that the above referred Urdu words were stated there
only. In the next breath, he denied a suggestion that he
introduced Gul Naz for the first time. He further denied that he
used general words in order to introduce a witness of his
choice later on. Gul Naz, in her statement (PW-6) buttressed
the fact of her presence. It appears from her statement that she
was a student and had passed class 9 those days. The
statement of PW5 Mst. Amthari further lends support to PW-4

and PW-6 by stating the she and Gul Naz did not participate in
6

the marriage ceremony. It follows that both the women were
present on the spot.

8. The eye witnesses also testified that the IO prepared the
site plan as they pointed out the place of the occurrence. While
under cross examination, PW-4 mother of the complainant and
the deceased deposed as under;

“I was in severe shock so I do not know what happened
as soon as the deceased was hit I remained unconscious
for 2 days. Unconscious means that a person knows
nothing.”

A question arises whether this statement is confidence
inspiring. Certain points are worth consideration here. First,
the IO deposed that he prepared the site plan in the presence of
the eye witnesses, including, of course, PW4. Why the IO
would have necessarily involved PW4 if, at all, she was
unconscious, especially when the complainant and PW6 were
there to point out the spot for preparation of the site plan.
Second, the deposition of PW4 was recorded on 16/05/2018,
after about 5 years of the occurrence. This is a long time to
recollect oral facts in minute and specific details. Third, she is
an illiterate old woman, above all, mother of deceased. Her
statement that she fell unconscious need not be understood
within the literal meaning of the English words written in her
statement. When a mother comes to know about the natural
death of her son, she would be obviously gripped by severe

shock. The shock will be severer, even abrupt
7

unconsciousness, when the news is the death of her son as
murder; and that would be quite natural. For a mother the loss
of her son is a life-long heartache. If the death of the son was a
murder and right in front of her, one can imagine what will be
her persistent feelings. More so, such feelings never fade away
as the time goes by.

9. Next, the kind of weapon was shown as simple firearm
in the murasila. The complainant (PW-3) said it was a
Kalashnikov, however, during cross examination, he deposed
that he can differentiate between a Kalashnikov and a pistol.
He explained that in the murasila he stated “machine” (a word
ordinarily an ordinary person in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
would use for Kalashnikov in Pashto) and further recollected
that he stated firearms. From the spot, shells of 7.62 bore
(Kalashnikov) were recovered. It needs no emphasis that the
word “firearm” was stated in the murasila, it happened to be a
Kalashnikov though PW3 was asked about pistol. Undeniably,
both are firearm weapons. At the time of firing, an eye witness
would not be necessarily in a position to look at the kind of the
weapon used. Hence, the use of the word firearm would be
sufficient to means a Kalashnikov.

10. The place of the report is another key aspect of the
case. Admittedly, the report was made in the Casualty room of
the hospital in Mardan. PW-3 admitted that many police posts

fall on the way between the place of the occurrence and the
8

hospital. He denied that this aspect belies the fact of his
presence on the spot. If he had popped into a police post for a
report, even then he was to be referred to the hospital as post
mortem examination was to be held. Every hospital has a
police post where reports of such like crimes are lodged. The
FIR clearly reflects the report was made in the hospital at 1820
hours, 50 minutes after the occurrence. The IO (PW-11) was
also asked about the police posts lying on the way to Mardan
city. He stated that there is a police post near the graveyard of
Mayar, the village of the parties, and also the Police Station
Hoti, but he explained that there are other approach roads, too,
on which no police post/station is situated. It is not clear
which road the people followed while they were taking the
dead body to the hospital. Nor was the complainant asked
about any such road on which a police station would fall. No
suggestion relating to consultation and deliberation was put to
the complainant. Soon after a murder occurrence, people rush
to the spot and the report is never made exactly at that specific
moment. It does take a while even if the police post is around
the corner. Deliberation and consultation could be seen in the
peculiar circumstances of a case. The circumstances of the
case in hand don’t indicate any scope of such deliberation and
consultation as, noted above, the report was lodged after 50
minutes. The mere fact that the police was available on the

way couldn’t, in the circumstances, be seen as fatal as to lay
9

axe at the roots of the prosecution case. Indeed, the occurrence
took place in the daylight; reported promptly followed by
post-mortem examination, which leave no possibility of

consultation or deliberation. Reliance is placed on Rooh Ullah

and others v. The State and others, reported as 2022 SCMR

888 [Supreme Court of Pakistan], in which the honourable

Court held that:
Incident, a daylight affair, was reported a remarkable
promptitude followed by examination of the injured as
well as autopsy, circumstances that cumulatively
exclude possibility of consultations or deliberations

(para. 3).
11. PW3 denied that the dead body of the deceased was
shifted to hospital by co-villagers. In examination-in-chief, he
deposed that he shifted the dead body to the hospital. He
denied a suggestion that had he been present on the spot he
would have lodged the report in a police station lying on the
way to the hospital. These suggestions, if at all, are not
substantial enough so as to lead to an adverse inference on the
main core of the prosecution case. It is quite natural that the
village people shift the dead body and even accompany it to
the hospital to help the complainant party as the village
fraternity. Usually, those people do include nearest relatives of
the complainant party. The deposition of the complainant that
he shifted the dead body doesn’t mean he did it all alone.

Indeed, it couldn’t be assumed that the complainant did the
10

shifting literally as a single individual. Culturally, it never
happens, nor can anyone singly do it.

12. The second perspective is that the eye witnesses saw the
appellant entered their house duly armed, opened fire at the
deceased with the intention to commit his murder. The

complainant (PW-4) stated:

On 06.05.2016, I along with my deceased brother and
other family member[s] were present in our house. In
the meanwhile, at 18.40 hours the accused facing trial
Shahzad and absconding co-accused Jihad duly armed
with Kalashnikov entered into our house situated at
village Akakhel Mayar and started firing at my brother
deceased Liagat Ali in order to commit Qatl-i-Amd,
who was hit and died on the spot. Thereafter, the
accused party escaped from the spot and we being
empty handed we could not doing anything.

PW-4 (Mst. Amthari) said:

On the day of occurrence I along with complainant and

deceased Liagat Ali and PW Gul Naz were present in

E our house. After the Asr prayer the accused facing trial

along with absconding accused Jihad duly armed with

deadly weapon entered into our house and started firing

VS at deceased. Liagat Ali as a result of which he was hit
and died on the spot.

Pw-6 (Gul Naz) deposed:

On the day of occurrence I along with complainant and
deceased Liagat Ali as well as my mother Mst. Amthari
were present in our house. Meanwhile, the accused
facing trial along with absconding accused entered our
house duly armed with deadly weapon and at once
started fire at the deceased as a result of which he was
hit and died on the spot.

13. The above details the PWs spelt out are substantially

the same: the PWs were present in their house and the
11

appellant duly armed with firearm entered their house and
fired at the deceased with the intention to kill him. As
discussed above, attempts were made during cross
examinations to shatter the presence of the PWs on the spot
and we have examined that aspect. No question was asked that
the appellant didn’t enter the house of the complainant part
and/or he was not known to the PWs. PW-S stated in her cross
examination that she doesn’t know whether accused Jehad
(absconding) and Shahzad (appellant) were residing separately
or in one house. She denied a suggestion that she doesn’t
know the appellant but his name and the name of absconding
accused was put in her mouth to charge them. She maintained
that the PWs were not fired at and that the firing lasted 4/5
seconds. It amounts to rather confirmation from under cross
examination that the appellant trespassed into the house with
intention to kill the deceased.

14. To sum up, the presence of the eye witnesses on the
spot was proved. The defence failed to successfully pinpoint
deliberation and consultation on the part of the prosecution.
Neither any suggestion was made that eye witnesses were not
residing in the house, nor was that the house was not their
ownership. Further, there was also no suggestion that the
appellant was not from the same Mohallah and village.
Furthermore, no enmity or ill was set up in their evidence. In

this respect, guidance is sought from the case of Muhammad

12

Sadiq v. The State reported 2022 SCMR 690 [Supreme
Court of Pakistan], in which it was held that:
So far as the question that the complainant was
mother of the deceased, therefore, her testimony
cannot be believed to sustain conviction of the
petitioner is concerned, it is by now a well
established principle of law that mere relationship of
the prosecution witnesses with the deceased cannot
be a ground to discard the testimony of such
witnesses unless previous enmity or ill will is
established on the record to falsely implicate the
accused in the case (para.6).
15. Another point for determination before this Court is that
the murasila was verified by Irsahd Ali, brother of the
complainant. The prosecution didn’t produce Irshad Ali. The
complainant said the Irshad Ali lives separately from, at 4/5
furlongs from his house. He added that Irshad Ali came to spot
after 20 minutes of the occurrence. It follows that Irshad Ali
was not an eye witnesses of the occurrence. The prosecution,
however, produced the police official (Muhammad Arif Khan,
ASI/PW-7) who recorded the report in the shape of murasila.
PW-7 denied any deliberation and consultation was done prior
to the recording of the murasila. While under cross
examination, PW-7 deposed that he didn’t mention the names
of the relatives who accompanied the complainant, the names
of the eye witnesses and the kind of weapon used by the

appellant. These facts were not necessary to be disclosed at

that time. The first information is meant just to set in motion
13

the lawful authorities about the commission of a crime. More
and greater details come forth during investigation.

16. The spot is situated inside the house of the complainant
party in Mohallah Akakhel in village Mayar. It depicts that the
house is situated to the north of the 8-feet pukka path of
Mohalla Akakhel. To the south of the path lies the Masjid of
the Mohallah. The site plan demonstrates that the appellant
entered the house of the complainant party and while at point
# 6 there, he opened fire at the deceased from 14 feet near the
wall of a room. From point ‘A’ right the back of the appellant
(point # 6), four shells of a 7.62 bore (Kalashnikov) giving
smell of having been freshly discharged were recovered. Point
‘B’ is the wall of the room, the place where the deceased was
present and fired at by the appellant, which was hit at different
points. The bullet marks were found at four and four and a half
feet there. Blood was also recovered from point 1, the place
where the deceased was hit with fire shots and breathed his
last.

17. The post mortem report shows that one entry wound
near left exile, two entry wounds on left side of abdomen near
the left renal region and one entry wound on left temporal
region on the scalp (total four wounds) were caused on the
body of the deceased. The entry wounds were on front side. It
means the deceased was fired at his front and on vital parts

which bespeaks the criminal intention of the appellant to
14

commit murder. The injuries being of firearm weapon, the
post mortem report supports the recovery of the four shells of
7.62 bore. The post mortem also supports the site plan and the
recovery inasmuch as four shells of the bullets were found and
recovered from the spot.

18. The marginal witnesses of the memo vide which the
four shells of 7.62 bore taken into possession were not
produced as PWs. They were private persons. The reason the
prosecution showed, was that they were won over. Be that as it
may, the prosecution proved that the shells were found inside
the house of which the eye witnesses furnished direct evidence.
In other words, the eye witnesses, who had seen the firing by
the appellant and the shells having fallen on the crime scene. It
was only on the memo that two private persons were cited as
marginal witnesses. In this view of the matter, the non-
production of the marginal witnesses though does not
satisfactorily prove the recovery, but this being circumstantial
evidence, becomes of little weight in face of the direct
evidence furnished by the eye witnesses. For this view, we are
fortified by the dictum laid down the case of Haroon Rashid
and 6 others v. The State and another 2005 SCMR_ 1568

[Supreme Court of Pakistan]. For the sake of ready

reference, the relevant para. is reproduced below:

17. So far recovery of crime weapon and empties,
learned Division Bench of the High Court has rightly
observed that the same were pieces of evidence of
15

corroboration and even if recovery is not proved, in
the_presence of reliable, confidence inspiring and
unimpeachable___ocular__testimony _and__ other
circumstantial_evidence, it would not adversely
affect the prosecution case as the said weapon and its
recoveries if held to be tampered with subsequently
(underlining applied).
19. Finally, the motive the prosecution set up was that an
altercation was held between the deceased and the accused
party in a marriage ceremony in the Mohallah on the day of
the occurrence. Learned counsel for the appellant emphatically
argued that motive once shown must be proved by the
prosecution. Legally, motive is immaterial. From the evidence
of the prosecution, motive was not established. The learned
trial Judge noted that the non-attribution of specific role to the
appellant was a mitigating circumstance in determining the
quantum of the sentence. We consider the non-proof of the
motive as a mitigating circumstance in the case.
20. The appellant remained absconder for three and a half
years. He offered no plausible explanation for his absconsion.
Like motive, abscondence is also a double edged weapon.
Where the prosecution has successfully proved the charge,
absconsion will throw its weight in favour of the prosecution.
21. In the light of the above discussion, we have reached to
the conclusion that the learned trial Judge has proved the
charge against the appellant beyond reasonable shadow of

doubt on the basis of basis of unimpeachable and confidence

inspiring evidence of the prosecution. Consequently, the
16

appeal is dismissed and conviction and sentence passed by the
learned trial Judge are maintained. We hold that motive not
being proved, the learned trial Judge has rightly considered it a
mitigating circumstance while awarding life imprisonment u/s
302 PPC, as tazir. For this reason, the Criminal Revision

petition filed by the complainant is dismissed.
