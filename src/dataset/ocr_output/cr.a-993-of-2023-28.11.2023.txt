2. Appellant-convict has preferred the instant
appeal against his conviction and sentences, whereas,

11-P of 2023 for confirmation of death sentence of the
convict.

3. As both the matters are the outcome of one
and the same judgment of the learned Trial Court,
therefore, we propose to decide and answer the same
through this single judgment.

4. The prosecution’s case as unfolded in First
Information Report (“FIR”) Exh.Pw.6/1 is that on
10.06.2017 at 2015 hours, Shakeel Khan complainant
(PW.11), in company of dead bodies of Raj Wali,
Jehanzeb and Aurangzeb, the deceased, respectively,
reported to Noor Haider Khan SHO (PW.13), in
casualty of KTH Peshawar to the effect that on the
fateful day i.e. 10.06.2017, before Atari time, he along
with his uncle Raj Wali and cousins Jehanzeb and
Aurangzeb was present near his house at Kankary road
when at 2015 hours, appellant Gul Roz alias Meena

accompanied by Zahid, Saqib, Wajid and Haroon

came there and opened indiscriminate firing at them,
as a result, the above named three deceased got hit, out
of whom Raj Wali and Jehanzeb succumbed to injuries
on the way to hospital while Aurangzeb deceased
breath his last in the hospital, whereas, he
(complainant) and PW Asghar Khan marically escaped

deceased and absconding co-accused Zahid and Saqib
prior to the occurrence has been advanced as a motive
behind the occurrence. Report of the complainant was
reduced into writing in the shape of Murasila Exh.PA

deceased which are Exh.PW.13/1 to Exh.PW.13/6 and

6. Fazal Rabi Inspector (PW.14) conducted
investigation in the case, who after registration of the
FIR, proceeded to the spot and prepared site plan
Exh.PB on the pointation of eyewitnesses. During spot
inspection, he secured bloodstained soil from the
places of the three deceased vide recovery memos
Exh.PW.7/1, Exh.PW.7/2 and Exh.PW.7/4, took into
possession 6 empties of 30 bore from point-A and 3
empties of the same bore from Point-B vide recovery
memos Exh.PW.7/3 and Exh.PW.7/5, respectively, in
presence of its marginal witnesses. Vide recovery
memos Exh.PW.7/6 and Exh.PW.7/7 and Exh.PW.7/8
he took into possession the last worn bloodstained
garments of the three deceased in presence of its
marginal witnesses, recorded statements of the PWs
under section 161 Cr.P.C, sent the empties and
bloodstained articles to the FSL, reports whereof are
Exh.PZ and Exh.PZ/1. As the accused were avoiding
their lawful arrest, therefore, he applied for initiation
of proceedings under sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C.,
placed on fie postmortem reports of the deceased,
prepared list of legal heirs of the deceased and after
completion of investigation handed over case file to
SHO, who submitted challan under section 512 Cr.P.C.

against the accused.
7. On arrest of the appellant and completion of
investigation, challan was submitted against him
before the learned trial Court, where he was formally
charge sheeted to which he pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. To prove its case, the prosecution
examined as many as fourteen witnesses and after
closure of the prosecution’s evidence, statement of the
appellant was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C.,
wherein he denied the prosecution’s allegation and
professed his innocence. He, however, neither wished
to be examined on oath under section 340(2) Cr.P.C.
nor opted to produce evidence in defence. On
conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court, after hearing
both the sides convicted and sentenced the appellant as
mentioned above, hence, this appeal and Murder
Reference.

8. We have heard the exhaustive arguments of
learned counsel for the parties and worthy AAG for the
State advanced at the bar and perused the record and
evidence with their valuable assistance.

9. It appears from record that the unfortunate
incident of killing three persons has taken place at
1848 hours (before Aftari) in the Holy month of
Ramadan at Kakray road near the house of
complainant Shakeel (PW.11), which has been

reported by him with promptitude at 2015 hours in the
casualty of KTH Peshawar. In his report, complainant
has categorically stated that besides him the incident
was also witnessed by Asghar Khan (PW.12). At the
time of making report, PW Asghar Khan was present
with him and he has verified his report. The occurrence
being reported with promptitude eliminates the
possibility of consultation and deliberation on the part
of the complainant in making report. Similarly, being a
broad daylight occurrence, taken place little before
Aftari, and the parties being co-villagers as well as
close relative; there is no chance of misidentification.
Ocular account in this case has been furnished by
complainant Shakeel (PW.11) and Asghar Khan
(PW.12). The former while appearing as PW.11

deposed as under:-

“Stated that deceased Raj Wali, Jehanzeb and
Aurangzeb were my paternal uncles. PW Asghar
Khan is my first paternal cousin.

Absconding accused Zahid and Saqib are
my first paternal cousins whereas absconding
accused Haroon, Wajid are the brothers of
accused facing trial Gul Roz and also my
relatives.

On the day of occurrence, I along with PW
Asghar Khan and deceased Raj Wali, Hehanzeb
and Aurangzeb were present on the spot. In the
meanwhile, accused facing trial Gul Roz along

with the above named absconding accused while
armed with deadly weapons arrived at the spot
and on seeing us, they started firing upon us, as a
result of which all the three deceased named
above sustained injuries, whereas, I an PW
Asghar escaped unhurt. After the occurrence, we
shifted the three injured to hospital but deceased
Raj Wali and Jehanzeb succumbed to their
injuries on the way whereas deceased Aurangzeb
died in the hospital. PW Asghar Khan and other
present thereby are the eyewitnesses of the
occurrence. Motive behind the occurrence was
that before Aftari altercation took place between
my uncle Raj Wali deceased and accused Zahid
and Saqib. In the hospital I lodged report in the
shape of Murasila. I signed the same as token of
its correctness. My report was also verified by
PW Asghar Khan. Thereafter the dead bodies of
the deceased were sent to the mortuary for PM
examination. I charge the accused for
commission of the offence. Later on, at my
instance the site plan was also prepared by the
Investigation Officer”.

In cross-examination he stated that his house is
situated at a distance of 10 paces from the crime spot;
that it is correctly recorded in his report that
occurrence had taken place a bit earlier than Aftari;
that he was not separately fired by the accused rather
all of them were fired collectively by the accused; that

firing continued for second; that he and PW Asghar
10

were standing near the deceased; that the site plan was
correctly prepared at his instance. He denied the
suggestions of the defence that he was not present at
the spot at the time of occurrence.

10. Another eyewitness Asghar Khan while
appearing as PW.12 deposed as under:-

“Stated that deceased Raj Wali,
Jehanzeb and Aurangzeb were my paternal
uncles. Complainant Shakeel is my first paternal
cousin.

Absconding accused Zahid and
Saqib are my first paternal cousins whereas
absconding accused Haroon, Wajid are brothers
of accused facing trial Gul Roz and also my
relatives.

On the day and time of occurrence, I
along with complainant Shakeel and deceased
Raj Wali, Jehanzeb and Aurangzeb were present
on the spot when in the meanwhile accused
facing trial Gul Goz along with above named
absconding accused while duly armed with
deadly weapons arrived at the spot and on seeing
us they started firing on us, as a result of which
all the three deceased named above sustained
injuries whereas I and Shakeel escaped unhurt.
After the occurrence, we shifted the three
injuried to hospital but deceased Raj Wali and
Jehanzeb succumbed to their injuries on the way
whereas deceased Aurangzeb died in the
hospital. Motive behind the occurrence was that
before Affari, altercation took place between
uncle deceased Raj Wali and absconding accused
Zahid and Saqib. Thereafter the dead bodies
were shifted to the mortuary for postmortem
examination. My statement was recorded under
section 161 Cr.P.C. by the police. I charge the

accused for commission of the offence.
Except confronting PW Asghar Khan with the
suggestions that he was not present at the spot at the
time of occurrence and that he has advanced a false
motive behind the occurrence, no other material
question has been put to him in his cross-examination
by the defence.

11. Perusal of the testimony of the eyewitnesses
would reveal that they are consistent and have
corroborated each other on all material particulars of
the incident, such as the day, date, time and place of
occurrence as well as the mode and manner in which
the occurrence has taken place. They are also
consistent on motive. Despite their cross-examination,
nothing beneficial to defence or adverse to the
prosecution could be extracted from their mouths.
Defence has failed to shatter their testimony and make
their presence at the spot at the time of occurrence
doubtful. Undeniably, the occurrence has taken place
in the holy month of Ramadan before A ftari. Houses of
the eyewitnesses are situated in close proximity of the
crime spot. As a general practice and tradition, people
reached home for Affari, and male members of the
house usually remain outside near their house waiting
for the aftari time, therefore, presence of the

eyewitnesses at the spot a bit prior to Aftari is quite
12

natural and appealable to prudent mind. Both the
eyewitnesses have reasonably explained their presence
at the spot. Admittedly, there was no previous enmity
between the parties, therefore, question of substitution
or false implication does not appeal to a prudent mind,
12. Arguments of learned counsel for the
appellant the eyewitnesses despite being in close
proximity of the deceased, have not sustained any
scratch, therefore, their presence at the spot at the time
of occurrence is highly doubtful, is unpersuasive, for
the reason that motive behind the crime was an
altercation between Raj Wali deceased and absconding
co-accused Zahid and Saqib, therefore, it is quite
appealable to a prudent mind that complainant and PW
Asghar Khan were not the first target of the accused.
Even otherwise, Honourable Supreme Court in a
judgment rendered in case titled, “Noor Muhammad
ys the State and another”, (PLJ 2006 SC 177), has
held that:-

“There could not be a presumption

or rule that all the persons under

attack from fire-arms ought to

have received injuries and the fact

that some of them had not received

injuries would not make their

presence at the place and time of

incident doubtful.”
13

Similarly, in case titled, Noor Muhammad Vs the
State and another” (2006 SCMR 1958), the honble
Supreme Court has dealt with the identical issue in
Para No.9 of the judgment which is reproduced
below:-

“Relative to the contention that

presence of two eyewitnesses namely
Niaz Muhammad and Pervez Khan_is
highly doubtful__as__in__spite__of
indiscriminate firing by the petitioner
and two absconding accused they did
not receive any injury is without any
substance. It is not the first case of its
kind wherein some of the persons who
were under attack by the opposite party
did not receive any firearm injury
whereas others received one or more than
one firearm injuries. There cannot be a
presumption or rule that all the persons
who were under attack from firearms
ought to have received injuries and the
mere fact that some of them did not
receive injuries would not make their
presence at the place and time of incident
doubtful. This contention is also devoid
of force and is repelled. In support of the
above proposition judgment in the case of
Mehboob Sultan and 02 others vs the

State 2001 SCMR 163 is referred.”
14

Again in case titled, “Nasir alias Nasiree and

another _vs the State and another” (2021 SCMR
1614), the Hon’ble supreme Court has ruled that:-

“Survival of Shahbaz Ahmed (PW.1)

unscathed during the assault, by itself,

cannot imply his absence from the scene

and as such does not undermine his

status as a witness worthy of credence; a

closely related resident of the locality,

his encounter with the deceased and the

injured in the neighbourhood, does not

raise eyebrow,; steps taken by him after

the incident are in consonance with the

investigative details and thus

confirmatory to his presence. A

somewhat lengthy cross-examination

failed to tremor his testimony,

substantially in line with the ocular

account furnished by two other

witnesses that included an injured as

well”.
13. At the cost of repetition, eyewitnesses
produced by the prosecution has no reason to falsely
implicate the appellant in a case of three murders and
spare the real culprits of their beloved. Recovery of
blood stained soil from the places of the three

deceased; their last worn bloodstained garments and

positive Serologist report Exh.PZ/1 in respect thereof,
15

corroborate the ocular account furnished by
complainant and PW Asghar Khan. Similarly,
09 empties of 30 bore shown recovered from the spot
by the Investigation Officer were sent to the FSL and
as per FSL report Exh.PZ, the same have been fired
from different 30 bore weapon. This circumstantial
piece of evidence also corroborates the ocular account.
Medical evidence has been furnished by Dr. Kabir
(PW.10), according to his opinion the three deceased
met their unnatural death due to firearm injuries, also
supports the ocular account of the prosecution’s case.
14. No doubt, eyewitnesses, Shakeel (PW.11)
and Aghar Khan (PW.12) are close relatives of the
three deceased but at the same time they are also the
relatives of the accused. Both have furnished
straightforward and confidence inspiring ocular
evidence of the occurrence corroborated by strong
circumstantial pieces of evidence and supported by
medical evidence, therefore, on the sole ground of their
close association with the deceased, their testimony
cannot be discarded. In case titled, “Noor
Muhammad vs the State and another”, (PLJ_2006
SC 177), the august supreme court has ruled that:-

“Mere relationship or close association of
prosecution witnesses with the deceased,

in absence of hostility, animosity or any
16

other motive to depose falsely would not
be sufficient to hold them as interested
witnesses and their testimony would not

be discarded on such ground.”
15. On reappraisal of evidence, we have arrived
to an irresistible conclusion that prosecution has
proved guilt of the appellant through cogent and
confidence inspiring ocular account corroborated and
supported by circumstantial and medical evidence.
The learned trial Court while appreciating the
evidence in its true perspective has arrived at a right
conclusion by holding the appellant guilty of the
offence to which no exception can be taken. However,
the matter of sentence awarded by the learned trial
court to the appellant under section 302(b) PPC,
requires serious consideration. Admittedly, total five
accused including the appellant are charged for
indiscriminate firing at the complainant party as a
result three persons have lost their lives. It is uncertain
as to fire shots of which of the five accused proved
fatal. Similarly, as per report Exh.PA and testimony of
the eyewitnesses motive behind the occurrence was an
altercation between Raj Wali deceased and
absconding co-accused Zahid and Saqib, therefore,
taking the above aspects as mitigating circumstances,

we deem it appropriate and in the interest of justice
17

that sentence of imprisonment for life on three counts
under section 302(b) PPC, if awarded to the appellant,
would meet the ends of justice.

16. Accordingly, conviction of the appellant
under section 302(b) PPC is maintained, however, his
sentence of death on three counts as Taz’zir is
reduced/converted to imprisonment for life on three
counts as Ta’azir. The amount of compensation and
period of sentence in default thereof is maintained.
Similarly, conviction and sentences of the appellant
under sections 324 and 148 PPC are also maintained.
All the substantive sentences of imprisonment shall
run concurrently. Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C. is
extended to the appellant.

17. On conversion of death sentence of the
appellant to imprisonment for life on three counts
under section 302(b) PPC, Murder Reference No.11-P
of 2023, is answered in the Negative.
