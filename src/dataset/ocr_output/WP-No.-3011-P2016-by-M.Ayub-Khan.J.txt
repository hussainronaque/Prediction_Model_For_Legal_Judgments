MUHAMMAD AYUB KHAN, J. - Through

this writ petition, the petitioner has called in question
the quotas allocated to different categories of students
in admission to the Islamia College, University of
Peshawar and University of Peshawar and different
Boards of this Province. His prayer in the writ petition

seeks:-

“Im view of the foregoing, it is,
therefore, prayed that, on acceptance
of this petition, this august Court may
be pleased to issue an appropriate
writ, thereby: —

a declaring the impugned paras/parts
‘of. the prospectus, 3026 of ICP
regarding the quota seats, fee
structure, self finance scheme and the
consequent admissions/actions — as
illegal, unlawful and of no legal effect;
iidirecting the ICP authorities to ré-
process the admissions in the
intermediate classes (FA, F-Sc)
\ forthwith on open merit against all the
, seats with no allocation of reserved
seats to any category except that of the
disabled students, and to form a fee
structure for all on equality and parity
basis;

iii.directing the respondents No.1 to 2
to grant admission to the locals of
nearby villages on preferential and
priority basis, like that being done in
Govt. College, Peshawar and other
areas/districts of the Province;

iv.directing the concerned authorities
to restrain the in-service teachers at
all levels from teaching tuitions
individually or in private academies,
and to take action against those
academies which are owned by/or
where the _ in-service teachers
(professor, lectures, etc) are teaching
for monetary gain;

|

y.directing the respondents 10 and 11
to take immediate steps for
a centralization of the BISEs and
a) uniform marking of examination
; papers through out the province,
preferably before the forthcoming
matric and intermediate examinations;

and

vi.granting any other remedy to which
the petitioner is found fit in law, justice

2. The relevant facts leading to this writ
petition are that the petitioner applied for admission in
the F.Sc Pre-Medical and Pre-Engineering for both
Islamic College and University College for Boys,
Peshawar. According to the petitioner, he could not

find his admission in any of the Colleges as the open

|

merit seats were restricted to 150, while 250 seats were
allocated for self finance seat and about 120 seats
through special quotas for different categories. It was
vehemently contended how self finance seats can be
allowed in the Government Funded Educational
Institution. It was further asserted that all the allocation
of these reserved quota seats run counter to the
Articles 25 and 27 of the Constitution of the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (“Constitution”), besides
violative of the judgment of the Apex Court reported in

2001 SCMR-1161.

3. The respondents have filed their
comments. The Islamic College, Peshawar filed their
separate comments and submitted that since the
petitioner was too low in the merit list; therefore, he
could not qualify for admission. It is alleged that the
allocation of guota to different categories has not
effected the open merit; that there is no concept of
earning profit on education and the fee structure is
subsidies; that there is employees children quota,
which is over and above the open seats, therefore, it
cannot be said that employees children are benefited at

the cost of others.

4. The comments filed by the respondents
No.5 to 9, different Boards of the Province have

summarized in para-17 as follows:-

“ Under the Board of Intermediate and
Secondary Education Act, 1990, the
creation of BISEs is the mandate of the
Government and the Government by
exercising such power has created 08
boards in the Province to facilitate the
public. After establishment of further
boards in the province, so many steps
have been taken by the authorities to
prepare common papers and to
Standardize the marking in all the
Boards. For .ensuring uniformity in
awarding marks the BISEs in KP used
to prepare/set the question papers by
single subject expert and for this
purpose every year the different papers
are allocated to different boards for
preparation of question papers.
Similarly, after examination — the
answers books are marked/checked
through groups, wherein each Scorer
is allotted one question for marking
under the strict vigilance of Head
Examiner etc. Furthermore, marking
Scheme/rubrics are framed prior to the
start of marking process, which are
shared with the. Head Examiners for
onward communication to sub-
examiners. The Boards have also
started the Optical = Marking
Recognition (MOR). Due to these steps
the examinations and marking system
are very much improved and curtailed
the chances of cheating etc. It is totally
incorrect that there is a run amongst
the BISEs for awarding more and
more marks without looking at the
quality of the education. It is also
incorrect that decentralization of
BISEs has badly damaged the quality
of education. Due to population
increase and far flung areas the
centralization of BISEs is not possible.
The decentralization was adapted to
facilities the peoples/students on their

door steps. It would not be out of, ‘place
to mention here that it has always been
the endeavour of all the BISEs and
Government to bring about further
improvements in the Examinations and
Education system and to bring
uniformity”.

The Provincial Government has also filed

They admitted the stance of the petitioner and

submitted the comments as follows:-

“3. Pertains to the respondents No.1, ,

which is a public university and the
petitioner personal record. However,
the reservation of 120 seats out of 150
seats for special quota seems
extremely disproportional. The
reservation of quota for teachers’ son
with almost no fee as compared to
exorbitantly charged 250 seats
allocated to self-finance scheme is also
not justified. The Higher Education
Department Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in
its Admission Policy 2014-15 has also
reserved 5% seats for the children of
its employees on provincial basis,
which is purely filled on merit only.
There is no fee exemption for them at
all (copy of the Admission Policy as
Annex-A). The claim of the petitioner
against the respondent No.] appears
alarmingly exploitative and uncalled
for. The reservation of seats for
teacher’s son in the respondent No.1
University should be filled on merit. |

4. There should be no double
standards for those who come on merit
and those who do not come on merit
despite the conducive environment of
the university. The reservation of
quota for those who belong to
backward areas may be justified but
for the children of the University
employees in a very favourably
6

environment cannot be justified. There
should be minimum standard even for
the sons of the teachers of the
Universities. The poor standard 506
marks for the Admission in F.Sc is
unwarranted. Islamia College
University is indeed the most sought
after institutions of this province.
Teacher's son's quota should have
been filled from the children of all the
public sector universities in Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, There should not be any
concession in fees structure for them
alone. The fees structure of self-
finance and those candidates filled on
merit is too high, which needs
rationalization. It is further submitted
that universities are under sub-section
6 of section 3 read with sub-section (3)
af section 12-A of the Universities Act,
2012, have financial and
administrative autonomy therefore, the
respondent No.11 cannot interfere in
their autonomy. The respondents No.
10 and 11, fully rely on the wisdom of
this Hon’ble Court to judicially review
the claim of the petitioner in
A accordance with law.

11.The merit fixed for ICP Employees
children is 560 as compared to the
merit fixed for open merit is 1004, as
claimed by the petitioner, seems
exploitative and monopolistic. The
scheme of the autonomy for the
universities, does not envision such a
monopolistic approach which needs
review by this August Court”.

6. Arguments heard and record perused.

7. Under the Constitution through 18"
Constitutional Amendment, Article 25A has been
added, whith identifies the education, as one of the
fundamental rights of the people, the Article reads as

under:-

7

“25A, Right of education. The State
shall provide free and compulsory
education to all children of the age
of five to sixteen years in such
manner as may be determined by

8. In the successful life of an individual, the
education plays an important role. Generally, it is
considered to be the foundation of society which brings
economic wealth, social prosperity, political stability
and maintaining healthy population. Article 25 of the
Constitution secured rights of equality amongst the

citizens, it is reproduced for convenience:-

“25.(1) Equality of citizens. All
citizens are equal before law and
are entitled to equal protection of
law. :

(2)There shall be no discrimination
on the basis of sex;

(3)Nothing in this Article shall
prevent the State from making any
special provision for the protection
of women and children”.

9. The issue involved in this case is
provisions of quotas in different Universities and
Colleges. The determination of quota finds is
mentioned in Article 27 of the Constitution which

reads as under:-

wh

“27. Safeguard against discrimination
in services. (1) No citizen otherwise
qualified for appointment in the
service of Pakistan shall be
8

discriminated against in respect of
any such appointment on the ground
only of race, religion, caste, Sex,
residence or place of birth.

Provided that, for a period not
exceeding [forty] years from the
commencing day, posts may be
reserved for persons belonging to any
class or area to secure their adequate
representation in the service of
Pakistan:

Provided further that, in the interest
of the said service, specified posts or
services may be reserved for members
of either sex if such posts or services
entail the performance of duties and
functions which cannot be adequately
performed by members of the other
sex[:

Provided also that under-
representation of any class or area in
the service of Pakistan may be
redressed in such manner as may be
determined by an Act of Majlis-e-
Shoora (Parliament). ]

(2) Nothing in clause(1) shall prevent
any Provincial Government, or any
local or other authority ina Province,
from prescribing, in relation to any
post or class of service under that
Government or authority, conditions
as to residence in the Province, for a
period not exceeding three years,
prior to appointment under that
Government or authority”.

10. Finally, the most pertinent provision
relating to providing special status for students hailing
from socially and educationally backward class has

been expressly ordained in sub-Article 4 of Article 22

of the Constitution, which provides;
DY 9

-_ “Nothing in this article shall prevent any
public authority from making provisions for
the advancement of any socially or
educationally backward class of citizens.”

11. We, while examining the prospectus for

Intermediate, B.Sc, Master in Higher Studies, 2016 of
the Islamia College, Peshawar found Admission
Regulations that prescribed the following quotas for
different categories which are either area specific or for
the employees of Universities. The admission
regulation providing quota to different categories are
reproduced for ready reference:-

has out classed the open merit. Allowing quota to
employees/teachers sons of the Universities shows the
arbitrariness and authoritarianism. These Universities
are public Universities and never belonged to its

employees or its administration.

13. The Hon’ble Federal Shariat Court in
Nusrat Baig Mirza vs. Government of Pakistan and

another PLD _1992_FSC_412_ commented upon the

quota system in the following words:-

“The Holy Quran and Sunnah

should form the basis of all our
{ directions for all our spiritual as
i well as worldly endeavours as they
provide us a guidance not only
towards the good in the Hereafter
but also to attain a good life in this
world. Quota system in disregard
of merit makes the place of
domicile as the criteria and. this
has, unfortunately, been so woven
and institutionalized in our socio-
political fabric that unless we
return to the original message of
the Holy Qur’an we will be further
away from the righteous and
straight path.

14. It may be noted that allocation of quota to
different categories remained an issue before the
Superior Courts in the history of this country. In the

case of Attiya Bibi Khan vs. Federation of Pakistan

Fr ee men preg cee

PLD 2001 SC-1161, the august Supreme Court of

Pakistan has discussed in detail the allocation of seats

in the Medical Colleges. This judgment has in fact

PE SO manner, epee remem © et
MS

11

dealt with all categories that were given quota in
admission to the Medical Colleges. In this Judgment,
the allocation of seats for FATA, disabled and under
development areas were considered to have
constitutional backing, while the rest either that the
employees sons, doctors sons, defence personnel sons
etc were not considered as having any constitutional
protection and the apex court has in this judgment
decided a point of Jaw and under Article 189 of the
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 is
binding on all the educational institutions of this

country, but unfortunately that was considered as

_ specifically for the admission to the Medical Colleges.

The judgment in Attiya Bibi case has since been
implemented in the Medical Colleges and we have
noted in many cases that the prospectus prescribed that

quota only which has constitutional backing.

15. The Provincial Government has also
shown its dis-pleasure over the reservation of quota for
teachers or employees sons and considered it as
disproportionate and injustice to the deserving

candidates. According to the learned AAG in view of

Section ‘12 (a)-of the University, 2012 since these

Universities have administrative and financial
autonomy; therefore, the government cannot interfere.

16. We also found that the merit fixed for the

bi
oe

12
open merit has gone up to the candidate who got 1004
out of 1100, while the University employee’s children,

who have 560 marks, had entered these Institutions

through the impugned quotas.

17. The cases of disable persons and
candidates from backward and under developed
districts/FATA is altogether different, as per clear
dictates of Articles 22 and 27 of the Constitution,
which permits reservation of quota to students hailing

from socially and educationally backward areas.

18. One of celebrated case of the Apex Court

1991 SCMR-1041 titled “LA. Sherwani vs.

reported in

Government_of Pakistan”, which has laid down the
principle on the equal protection of law and equal
treatment before law and discussed the reasonable
classification, as contained in Articles 25 and 27 of the

Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973:-

“(i) that equal protection of law does

not envisage that every citizen is to be

treated alike. in all circumstances, but

it contemplates that persons similarly

situated or similarly placed are to be
- treated alike;

(ii) that reasonable classification is
permissible but it must be founded on

reasonable distinction or reasonable
basis;

(iii) that different laws can validly be
enacted for different sexes, persons in
different age groups, persons having

G
13

different financial standings and
persons accused of heinous crimes;

(iv) that no standard of universal
application to test responsibilities of a
classification can be laid down as
what may be reasonable classification
in a particular set of circumstances,
may be unreasonable in the other set
of circumstances;

(v) that a law applying to one person
or one class of persons may be
Constitutionally valid if there is
sufficient basis or reason for it, but a
classification which is arbitrary and
is not founded on any rational basis
is no classification as to warrant
its exclusion from the mischief of
Article 25;

(vithat equal protection of law means
that all persons equally placed be
treated alike both in privileges
conferred and liabilities imposed,

(vii)that in order to make a
classification reasonable, it should be
based:--

(a) on an intelligible differentia which
distinguishes persons or things that
are grouped together from those who
have been left our;

(bjthat the differentia must have
rational nexus to the object sought to
be achieved by such classification”.

19. On the touch stone of the above
principles, we find that reservation of quotas for all
categories in Islamia College, Peshawar, is illegal and
without lawful authority except for disabled students or
under privileged class of students or students from
FATA or under developed districts of the Province.

This Court further directs that the Public Educational

Institutions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shall follow the

law and provide no quotas for admission except for

disabled students or under privileged class of students

or students from under developed/backward areas of

the Province or FATA.

20. For the reasons discussed above, this writ

petition is allowed in the above terms.
