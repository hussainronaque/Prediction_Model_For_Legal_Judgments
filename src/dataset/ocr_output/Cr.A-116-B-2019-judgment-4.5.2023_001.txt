JUDGMENT
Dr. KHURSHID IQBAL, J.-

This appeal is directed against the judgment
dated 14.12.2018 of the Additional Sessions Judge-IIl,
Bannu, whereby he acquitted the respondent-accused,
namely, Hidayat Ullah, from the charges leveled against
him. The respondent-accused was tried u/ss. 302/324/34,
PPC, having been charged in a case registered vide FIR No.
02 dated 01.01.2004, at Police Station Saddar, District,

Bannu.

2. Facts shortly are that on 01.01.2004, the
complainant Tahir Ali Khan son of Azmar Ali Khan present
with the dead body of his deceased brother Safdar Ali Khan
reported the matter to the local police in the Civil Hospital
District Bannu, that on the day of incident at 15:15 hours he

along with his son Murad Ali and brother Safdar Ali were

HONBLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL
-2-
coming back to home from village Mandori. At about 15:45
hours on reaching the place of incident accused Hidayatullah
(respondent) and Rehmat Ullah (acquitted), armed with
Kalashnikovs, on seeing them fired at complainant party
with intention to kill. Resultantly, with the firing of
accused/respondent the brother of complainant got hit and
died there and then. However, complainant and his son
luckily escaped unhurt. Motive behind the occurrence was
stated that the deceased was suspected for the murder of the

brother of accused.

3. After completion of the investigation,
complete challan was submitted against them before the
learned trial Court. Accused were absconding, therefore,
proceedings u/s. 512, Cr. P.C were initiated against them and
they were declared proclaimed offenders on 05.08.2005.
Accused Rehmat Ullah was arrested on 15.09.2014. He
faced the trial and acquitted. The present accused/respondent
was arrested on 02.03.2017. Copies were supplied to him in
compliance with section 265-C, Cr. PC. Charge was framed

against him, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

4. The prosecution examined as many as ten (10)
PWs. As the Medical Officer was abroad, his previously
recorded statement u/s 512 Cr.P.C was_ transposed.
Statement of the respondent/accused u/s. 342, Cr. P.C, was
recorded, in which he was afforded an opportunity of

evidence in defence and/or statement on oath, but he did not

“Imranuiiah FS* (0.8) HON'BLS MB. FUSTICE FAZAL SUBHAN
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID 1OBAL
-3-
avail it. After hearing the arguments, the respondent-accused
was acquitted from the charges leveled against him by the

learned trial Court vide the impugned judgment dated

14.12.2018.

5. We have heard arguments of learned AAG for

the State/appellant and perused the record.

6. To begin with, firstly, the report was lodged
with a delay of two hours and fifteen minutes. The
occurrence was reported to have taken place on 01.01.2004
at 15:45 hours. The report was lodged at 18:00 hours, the

same day. The report is silent on explanation of the delay.

7. Secondly, in his statement recorded as PW-5,
the complainant tried to explain the delay in making the
report, stating that he sent a message to his village about the
occurrence. After the arrival of people from his village, he
shifted the dead body of the deceased to the hospital. The
complainant could not mention the name of the person
through whom he sent the information to his village. Rather
he deposed that the man was a passerby. This indicates

dishonest improvements to fill the lacuna.

8. Thirdly, the complainant in his report stated
that the accused persons opened fire at him and his
companions on seeing them. In his deposition before at the
trial, he stated that when he and his companions were past

the accused party a few paces, the latter then fired at them.

“Hmranullah PS* (0.8) HON'OLE MR. JUSTICE FAZAL SUBHAN
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL
-4-
This is a material contradiction inasmuch as it negates the

FIR story.

9. Fourthly, the medical evidence creats further
contradiction as the post-mortem report shows that injuries
were caused on the front of the dead body of the deceased. It
follows that while the post-mortem report and the FIR
support each other, the complainant’s statement contradicts

both of them.

10. Fifthly, the complainant stated nothing about
the purpose of his visit to village Mandori. While this may
not be considered as necessary, he himself made by
introducing different version in his statements recorded in
proceedings u/s 512 Cr.PC and the trial. In the earlier
proceedings, he explained that he and his companions had
gone to village Mandori to offer “Fateha” on the death of
some one. In his statement recorded at the trial, he deposed
that he and his companions had gone to village Mandori for

doing their daily laboring job.

11. Sixthly, the complainant stated that he and his
companions were going from East to West on the place of
occurrence. But the site-plan, which was prepared at his
behest, reflects that he and his companions were proceedings
from North to South. This contradiction sinks deeper when it

is seen in juxtaposition with the statement of the

‘*imranullah PS* (0.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE FAZAL SUBHAN
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL
5.

investigating officer (PW-6), who stated that there is no path

from East to South on the place of the occurrence.

12. Seventhly, the statement of the complainant
shows that while shifting the dead body of his deceased
brother from the spot, he did not touch the dead body. His
statement further shows that his co-villagers reached to the
spot 45 minutes after the occurrence. This conduct of the

complainant appears to be unnatural, as such, unbelievable.

13. Eighthly, the motive setup in the initial report
was blood feud between the parties. However, no evidence
whatever was brought on the record to prove the motive.
Legally, though motive is not relevant, it must be proved if it

is alleged in the report.

14, In view of the above, we have reached to the
conclusion that from the evidence reappraised above, the
prosecution has failed to bring home the charge against the
respondents-accused. It is a settled principle of law that the
prosecution is duty bound to prove the charge against an
accused person beyond shadow of a reasonable doubt. Any
single infirmity in the prosecution case capable of creating a
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind must be considered and
the benefit thereof must be given to an accused person.
Reliance is placed on the case titled Ahmad Ali & another
Vs The State (2023 SCMR 781), it was held that:-

12. Even otherwise, it is well settled
that for the purposes of extending the
benefit of doubt to an accused, it is not
necessary that there be multiple
infirmities in the prosecution case or
several circumstances creating doubt. A
single or slightest doubt, if found

-6-

reasonable, in the prosecution case
would be sufficient to entitle the accused
to its benefit, not as a matter of grace
and concession but as a matter of right.
Reliance in this regard may be placed on
the cases reported as Tajamal Hussain
v. The State (2022 SCMR 1567), Sajjad
Hussain v. The State (2022 SCMR 1540),
Abdul Ghafoor v. The State (2022
SCMR 1527 SC), Kashif Ali v. The State
(2022 SCMR 1515), Muhammad Ashraf
v. The State (2022 SCMR 1328), Khalid
Mehmood v. The State (2022 SCMR
1148), Muhammad Sami Ullah v. The
State (2022 SCMR_ 998), Bashir
Muhammad Khan v. The State (2022
SCMR 986), The State v. Ahmed Omer
Sheikh (2021 SCMR 873), Najaf Ali
Shah v. The State (2021 SCMR 736),
Muhammad Imran v. The State (2020
SCMR 857), Abdul Jabbar v. The State
(2019 SCMR 129), Mst. Asia Bibi v. The
State (PLD 2019 SC 64), Hashim Qasim
v. The State (2017 SCMR_ 986),
Muhammad Mansha v. The State (2018
SCMR 772), Muhammad Zaman vy. The
State (2014 SCMR 749 SC), Khalid
Mehmood v. The State (2011 SCMR
664), Muhammad Akram v. The State
(2009 SCMR 230), Faheem Ahmed
Farooqui v. The State (2008 SCMR
1572), Ghulam Qadir v. The State (2008
SCMR 1221) and Tariq Pervaiz v. The
State (1995 SCMR 1345).

In the list of cases referred to in paragraph, above, reference

may be made to Ghulam Qadir and 2 others v. The State
(2008 SCMR 1221), a relatively other case, in which it was

observed:

“It needs no reiteration that for the
purpose of given benefit of doubt to an
accused person, more than one infirmity
is not required, a single infirmity
creating reasonable doubt in the mind of
a reasonable and prudent § mind
regarding the truth of the charge, makes
the whole case doubtful.”

15. We find that the trial Court has properly

appreciated the evidence on the record and arrived at correct

“Imvaraitch PS* (DB) HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE FAZAL SUBHAN
HONTBLE WR. IUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID JOBAL
-7-

conclusion while recording acquittal. It is worth observing
that an accused person, as a matter of right, is presumed to
be innocent before the trial Court unless the charge is proved
against him/her. Acquittal at the trial gives rise to double
presumption of innocence for an accused. An appellate
Court needs to be cautious while considering the evidence
and should avoid reversal of an acquittal, unless it finds that
the acquittal is perverse, conjectural, arbitrary,
jurisdictionally defective and prompted by mis-reading or
non-reading of evidence. Even if a contrary view is formed
on re-appraisal of evidence, it should not be used to disturb
an acquittal, provided convincing evidence is available on
the record to reverse acquittal. In this respect, reference may
be made to the judgment of the Apex Court rendered in the
case of Jehangir vs. Aminullah & others reported as 2010
SCMR 491, wherein it was held:

“It is well-settled by now that there are
certain limitations on the power of the
Appellate Court to convert acquittal
into a conviction. It is well-settled that
Appellate Court would not interfere
with acquittal merely because on
reappraisal of the evidence it comes to
the conclusion different from that of the
Court acquitting the accused, provided
both the conclusions are reasonably
possible. If, however, the conclusion
reached by that Court was such that no
reasonable person would conceivably
reach the same and was impossible then
this Court would interfere in exceptional
cases on overwhelming proof resulting
in conclusive and irresistible conclusion;
and that too with a view only to avoid
grave miscarriage of justice and for no
other purpose. The important test
visualized in these cases, in this behalf
was that the finding sought to be
interfered with, after scrutiny under the
forgoing searching light, should be
found wholly as artificial, shocking and
ridiculous. The view taken by this Court
in Ghulam Sikandar v. Mamaraz Khan
PLD 1985 SC 11 is well-known that "in

‘*imranuliah PS* (0.B) HON’BLE MR, JUSTICE FAZAL SUBHAN
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL
-8-

an appeal against acquittal this Court
would not, on principle, ordinarily
interfere and instead would give due
weight and consideration to the findings
of Court acquitting the accused. This
approach is slightly different from that
in an appeal against conviction when
leave is granted only for the re-
appraisement of evidence which then is
undertaken so as to see that benefit of
every reasonable doubt should be
extended to the accused. This difference
of approach is mainly conditioned by
the fact that the acquittal carries with it
the two well-accepted presumptions: one
initial, that, till found guilty, the accused
is innocent; and two that again after the
trial a Court below confirmed the
assumption of innocence. This will not
carry the second presumption and will
also thus lose the first one if on points
having conclusive effect on the end
result the Court below: (a) disregarded
material evidence; (b) misread such
evidence; (c) received such evidence
illegally". This principle was also
followed in Muhammad Iqbal _v.
Sanaullah PLD 1997 SC 569, State v.
Farman Hussain PLD 1995 SC’ 1,
Ghulam Sikandar v. Mamaraz Khan
PLD 1985 SC 11, Ahmad v. Crown PLD
1951 FC 107, Abdul Majid v.
Superintendent of Legal Affairs,
Government of Pakistan PLD 1964 SC
426, State v. Bashir PLD 1997 SC 408,
Muhammad Sharif v. Muhammad Javed
PLD 1976 SC 452, Shahzado v. State
PLD 1977 SC 413; Farmanullah v.
Qadeem Khan 2001 SCMR 1474 and
Khadim Hussain v. Manzoor Hussain
Shah 2002 SCMR 261.”

16. Moreover, accused Rehmat Ullah whose role
is the same with the present accused/respondent, has already
been acquitted. In the light of the above reappraisal of the
evidence, we have reached to the conclusion that the

prosecution has failed to bring home the charge against the

‘*Yesronullgh PS* (0.5) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE FAZAL SUBHAN

accused. Resultantly, while upholding the acquittal, we

dismissed the instant appeal in /imine.
