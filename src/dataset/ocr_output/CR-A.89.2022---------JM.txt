5. Heard. Record perused.
6. Record shows. that the

occurrence was taken place at 00:10 hours,
which was immediately reported by
appellant No.1 in presence of appellant
No.2 at the police post. Appellant No.1 also
produced to the scribe of murasila Ex.PA/1
the crime pistol which was taken into
possession by him. Subsequently, on
pointation of both the appellants, pointation
memos were also prepared by the 1.0. Both
the appellants also recorded _ their
confessional statements while endorsing
their initial report which was made through
murasila Ex.PA/1 and; FIR Ex.PA. The
commission of occurrence inside the house
of the appellants was not denied by (P.W-
1) Sulaiman Ahmad son of the deceased,

however, he has stated that appellant No.1
10

was leading an immoral life while his
deceased father refrained her from such life
but she was not ready to give up immoral
life, and; therefore, both the appellants with
consultation took the deceased inside their
house and murdered him. However, in his
cross-examination, he stated that “/ am not
the witness of the occurrence”. He has also
stated that he has not made any complaint
to the police regarding the bad character of
appellant No.1 or taking his father inside
the house by both the appellants. He has
admitted in his cross-examination the
presence of the dead body of deceased
inside the house of appellants. He has also
admitted that there were witnesses of the
occurrence, however, neither, he could
produce them before 1.0 in support of his
stance, nor the prosecution could record
their testimony before the court at the time
of trial. He has also admitted it correct that
the husband of Mst. Laiq Zari is alive and at
the relevant time and; date of the
occurrence, he was not present at the spot.
He has also admitted it correct that he has

not brought any witness for recording
11

statement regarding the bad character of
appellant No.1 and; her immoral life.

7. Though, prosecution has
placed much reliance and; stress on the
confessional statements of the appellants'
Ex.PW-9/3 & Ex.PW-9/6, but it cannot get
any benefit therefrom as both the
appellants had endorsed their stance
regarding the occurrence as taken on the
day first in a very straightforward manner
which rings true in the peculiar
circumstances of the case. It is a settled
principle that conviction can be based upon
a solitary judicial confession of an accused
but in that eventuality, it is to be relied upon
in toto without any pick and; choose. 2023
SCMR 139 JAVED IQBAL V. THE STATE.
2015 SCMR 856 DADULLAH and another
V. THE STATE. PLD 2006 SC 30
MANJEET SINGH V. THE STATE. When
the said confessional statements are
placed in juxtaposition with the initial report
of the appellants containing in murasila
Ex.PA/1 & FIR Ex.PA the same rings true,
voluntary, and; confidence inspiring fully
endorsing their initial report qua

commission of the offence wherein they
12

both have admitted the occurrence but in
self-defence.

8. Undeniably, the occurrence
had taken place inside the house of the
appellants; but they immediately reported
the matter to the police officials in the PP
which was reduced into murasila Ex.PA/1
followed by registration of FIR Ex.PA while
taking the plea of self-defence to protect
the honour of appellant No 1. Later, they
were nominated as accused upon the
statement of (P.W-1) Sulaiman Ahmad s/o
the deceased, and got arrested and; made
confession. However, while recording their
statements under section 342 Cr.P.C both
the appellants denied the commission of
offence while abandoning the plea of self-
defence. However, it’s been long settled
that if an accused had not raised the plea
of self-defence during trial either in his
statement under section 342 Cr.P.C or at
the time of cross-examination of the
prosecution witnesses, still, the court can
infer the same from the evidence led during
the trial if it is reasonable and; appealable
to prudent mind. Safder Ali V Crown (PLD

1953 F C 93), Shamir alias Shamla v. The
13

State (PLD 1958 S C 242), P L D 1964
(W.P) Peshawar 143 and Mohammad
Zaman V. Dost Mohammad and others
(SCMR 1988 388). As earlier discussed,
both the appellants had also recorded their
confessional statements Ex.PW-9/3 &
Ex.PW-9/6 respectively while admitting the
occurrence inside their house at the
revelant time but had taken the plea of self
defence in order to protect the honour of
the appellant No 1 which squarely supports
their stance reported in Murasia Ex.PA/1 |
and; FIR Ex.PA. In the matter of self-
defence, courts have to carefully examine
and; analyze the evidence put forth by the
prosecution at the time of appraisal and;
reappraisal, and; while arriving at the
conclusion that the occurrence has taken
place as a result of self-defence, then even
though no such plea has been taken by the
accused in their statements under section
342 Cr.P.C. or while cross examining the
prosecution witnesses, the benefit of the
same can undeniably be extended to them
as a matter of right and; not as a grace
keeping in view the cumulative effect of

such evidence.

9. As discussed above the
occurrence had taken place inside the
house of the appellants at odd hours of the
night and; the dead body of deceased has
also been recovered therefrom which fact
has also been fully supported by the
prosecution evidence including Sulaiman
Ahmad s/o the deceased. Therefore, given
the peculiar circumstances of the case,
now we have to determine whether the
act/reaction in self-defence was
proportionate and; commensurate to the
threat to the honour of appellant No.1 or
otherwise. It is settled that right of self-
defence only commences when a
reasonable apprehension arises from an
attempt or threat to commit an offence and
it is always to be exercised as a preventive
measure rather than for launching an
attack. As earlier discussed, per PM report
Ex.PM. deceased had received one entry
wound of 0.5 cm at the back of right ear
with cut on that side of ear & exit wound
on left side of skull approximately 2.5
cm in length alongwith an injury on Rt
leg below knee (sharp injury), in the

middle of leg (blunt injury). The firearm
—

15

injury is attributed to appellant No.1 which
caused the death of the deceased, while
the sharp and; blunt injury had been
attributed to appellant No.2. Admittedly, the
occurrence occurred at odd hours of the
night while both the appellants were asleep
when the accused entered their house,
therefore, the reaction of both the
appellants was quite natural in state of
panic and; then obvious in the given
circumstances as the law has recognized
exercise of the right of self-defence to resist
an attack on a person to defend his life
and; honour when the same is in danger or
at stake, particularly, when the state
machinery is immediately and; readily not
available to such person, then his
reasonable use of force is justified under
the law, however, the same must be
proportionate and; commensurate to the
threat posed therein. It's long been settled
that courts while examining the question of
self-defence, would not measure the action
of an accused on a golden scale but would
extend due concession on account of
human error of judgment in such a

situation. Ali Mea V. King- Emperor (AIR
16

1926 Cal. 1012), Ahmad Nawaz V. The
State (1970 SCMR 597), and Mashal
Khan V. The State (PLD 1988 SC 25).
Keeping in view the ibid principle,
particularly deceased a neighbor of the
appellants, having sixty years of age, and;
being empty-handed at the relevant time,
therefore, in our estimation, the reaction of
appellants was justified; but, the use of
force was not. proportionate and;
commensurate to the attempt made by him
in the given circumstances.

Given the above discussion,
instant appeal is partially allowed,
convictions of appellants are converted into
Sections 302 (c)/34 PPC from Section 302
(b) PPC and; their sentence is reduced to
five years simple imprisonment, amount of
compensation is also reduced to 300,000/-
payable to the LRs of the deceased under
section 544-A or in default whereof to
undergo four months simple imprisonment.
Conviction under section 15 of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013 _ is
maintained, however, sentence is reduced
to two years. Benefit of section 382-B

Cr.P.C extended to the appellants shall
17

remain intact and; their sentences shall run

concurrently.
