Benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C was extended to
all the appellants.

Complainant has filed the connected
Cr.R No. 74-M/2019 for enhancement of the
sentences awarded to the appellants through the

impugned judgment.

2. According to the first information report
lodged at the instance of complainant Amir Hatam
(PW-12) on 29.06.2015 at 21:45 in emergency ward
of civil hospital Madyan, his brother Muhammad
Afzal had invited them to his house for Affari for
which the complainant alongwith Shahb-ud-Din,
Atta Ullah, Shah Muhammad and Momin Khan
were going to the house of Muhammad Afzal. When
they reached to the thoroughfare near the house of
Badar Munir, the appellants, who were already
present there, started firing at them resultantly

Shahab-ud-Din was hit and died on the spot whereas

Atta Ullah became seriously wounded. According to
the complainant, he as well as Shah Muhammad
(PW-13) and Momin Khan (PW-14) had witnessed
the occurrence “whereas motive behind the
occurrence was mentioned an altercation that had
taken place between appellants and deceased and
injured at afternoon on the same day. It is
noteworthy that, as per prosecution, injured Atta
Ulah had later died because of the injuries he had

sustained on his body in the same occurrence.

3. After arrest of the appellants and
completion of investigation, challan was submitted
against them before the trial Court. On
commencement of trial, they were formally indicted
on 17.02.2016 for commission of the murders to
which they did not plead guilty and opted to face the
trial. Prosecution examined as many as 15 witnesses
including PW-14 Momin Khan whose examination-
in-chief was recorded on 14.06.2017 but he was
abandoned by prosecution on 25.04.2018. It is
pertinent to mention here that sentence of appellant
Muhammad Ali was suspended by this Court vide

order dated 10.02.2020. While deciding bail

application of accused Muhammad Rehman on
31.01.2018, it also came into the notice of this Court
that injured Atta Ullah had later succumbed to the
injuries but the charge had not been altered from
section 324 to 302 PPC to his extent. Thus, the trial
Court was directed to re-visit the charge and alter the
same in accordance with law if need be. The learned
trial Court altered the charge vide order dated
13.02.2018, on the same date learned APP and
learned counsel for the complainant recorded their
joint statement to the effect that they do not want to
re-examine PW-] to PW-15 in view of the altered
charge, however, counsel for the accused submitted
an application for re-cross examination of PWs Amir
Hatham Khan, Shah Muhammad, Momin Khan and
Shah Faisal Khan. The learned trial Court turned
down the said application vide order dated

17.04.2018 against which the appellants filed Cr.R

od

No. 23-M/2018 before this Court which was allowed
vide. order/ judgment dated 19.07.2018 and the
defence was allowed to re-cross examine the PWs
on the altered charge. In compliance with the order
of this Court, the learned trial Court summoned the

PWs for re-cross examination, however, during re-

cross examination of constable Umar Rehman (PW-
9) on 25.09.2018, a question of the defence counsel
was disputed by prosecution which prompted the
accused to file Cr.R No. 52-M/2018 before this
Court which was dismissed vide order dated
23.05.2019. In light of the said order of this Court,
the learned trial Court vide order dated 24.06.2019
only summoned complainant Amir Hatham Khan
(PW-12) for re-cross examination. Similarly another
application of the accused dated 01.07.2019 for
summoning all the eye witnesses for re-cross
examination was turned down by trial Court vide .
order dated 01.07.2019 with the observations that
only the relevant witness i.e complainant Amir
Hatham Khan (PW-12) was sufficient for the
purpose of re-cross examination, hence, he was re-
cross examined on 08.07.2019. After examination of
the appellants/convicts u/s 342, Cr.P.C, they were
convicted and sentenced vide judgment dated
27.07.2019, hence, this appeal and the connected

revision petition.

4. We have heard the arguments of learned

counsel for the parties including the learned

Tajarmul/Ps*:

Assistant A.G representing the State and perused the

record with their able assistance.

5. The record depicts that examination-in-
chief of PW Momin Khan was recorded as PW-14
on 14.06.2017 but he was abandoned by learned
APP and learned counsel for the complainant on
25.04.2018 on the ground that other eye witnesses
had already been examined. Even his statement was
relied upon by trial Court at the time of passing the
impugned judgment. The observations of learned
trial Court vide Order Sheet No. 34 dated
25.04.2018 that mere production of a PW and
recording his examination-in-chief would not take
away from prosecution the right to abandon a
witness save in exceptional cases, are misconceived.
During the course of arguments, a question arose
before this Court that once a witness, whose
examination-in-chief is recorded before the trial
Court, can be abandoned by prosecution? No doubt,
prosecution or a party to a lis is at liberty to abandon
a witness but once a witness comes into the dock
and he opens his mouth with regard to facts of the

case then in that eventuality he could not be

abandoned by prosecution rather it is the duty of the
Court to take the proceedings into its own hands.
The Court has prime duty to steer, control and
regulate the course of examination of a witness on
proper lines and to strike a fair balance between the
parties before it for bringing uniformity and
consistency in process of examination. Courts are
also required to act vigilantly and not to remain
oblivious of their duty in controlling and regulating
the process of examination of a witness. But in the
present case the Court has not discharged its duty
and has acted as a silent spectator by allowing the
prosecution to deal with the witnesses according to
their own whims. While highlighting the role of
Court at the time of recording evidence, it was
observed by Karachi High Court in the case of

“Ghulam Muhammad Vs. The State” reported as

PLD 1989 Karachi 144 that:

During the whole process of recording the
evidence the Presiding Officer is expected to be
mentally alert and aware of what is going on so
that he should be in a position to exercise some
control in the process of recording evidence so
that everybody should play his part as required
under the law within the limits of legal
restrictions imposed for each stage. It is the duty
of the trial Judge to see that justice is dispensed
with strictly according to law. Trial Judge is not
supposed to play a passive role at the stage of
recording of evidence and leave it entirely to the

Tajamul/Ps*

ba: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
bs t ym
ener a ee

-8-

Advocates who are appearing for prosecution
and defence. He has to preside over proceedings
in order to see that evidence is recorded in
perfect accord with legal requirements which
control the process at different stages. Lack of
concern and interest in the recording of evidence
by Presiding Officer can result into destroying of
evidence and gross injustice. If care, caution and
interest is taken by the trial Judge at the time of
recording evidence, he can see to it that correct
and legitimate evidence which is collected comes
on the record and ‘everybody including Police
Officers, who have to play an important role at
the time of investigation, do their duties in the
Court in accordance with law.

6. Admittedly, PW Momin Khan has
appeared before the Court as PW-14 and he recorded
his examination-in-chief but he was abandoned by
prosecution on the sole reason that other eye
witnesses have been examined. Abandonment of a
witness after recording his examination-in-chief is
not within the powers of prosecution rather it is the
duty of Court to handle such situation with care and
caution. The learned trial Court in sub-para (1) of
Para 14 of the impugned judgment has observed that
prosecution has produced three eye witnesses
including Momin Khan (PW-14) by making a
special reference to his name in the beginning of the
said sub-para despite the fact that prosecution had
abandoned the said witness after recording his
examination-in-chief and defence could not get any

opportunity to cross-examine him. In other words,

Tolemules*|

DB: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wioac Ahmad
Tajarnul/PS* |

-9-
the learned trial Court has acted in violation of
Article 133(1) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984

which reads.

133. Order of examination. (1) Witnesses
shall be first examined-in-chief, then (if the
adverse party so desires) cross-examined then
(if the party calling him so desires) re-
examined.

Bare reading of the above provision
shows that statement of a witness, which is to be
considered as admissible evidence under the law,
shall commence from examination-in-chief and
thereafter the opposite party shall have the right to
cross-examine him because it is settled law that
cross-examination of a witness is not just a formality
but is a valuable right of accused. However, it is a
different matter if the accused waives off his right to
cross-examine a witness who appears in support of
the prosecution case. In the present case the situation
is altogether different because there is nothing on the
record to show that the defence have ever give up its
right of cross-examination rather the defence
counsel has time and again requested the trial Court
for re-summoning of the PWs for cross-examination.

Thus, in view of the above stated scenario, we

oe: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag tbrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamul/Ps* |

-10-
cannot proceed further with this appeal for its

decision on merits.

vA It is also pertinent to mention here that
while hearing bail petition of accused Muhammad
Rehman and Akthar Ali (now appellants), it
transpired that charge was framed against the
appellants wherein they were indicted u/s 302 PPC
only for murder of Shahab-ud-Din and u/s 324 PPC
for causing firearm injuries to Atta Ullah though he
had already succumbed to the injuries on the same
day. This Court, on observing the afore-referred
error in the formal charge, decided the bail petition

with the following observations.

“7, Before parting with this order, it is
pertinent to mention here that the charge was
framed down on 17.02.2016 wherein the
accused were indicted under section 302 PPC
only for the murder of deceased Shahab-ud-
Din while it is a matter of record that the other
injured namely Attaullah also succumbed to
the injuries later on. It is required under the
law that the learned trial Court shall revisit
the charge and alter/add the same in
accordance with law if need be”.

It would not be out of place to note that
the controversy in question mainly cropped up due
to the reason that the initial charge was defective
which not only caused delay in conclusion of trial

but also spawned numerous complications in the

op: Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Ishtlag {brahim
Vb u Td
-ll-
case. No doubt, the afore-referred error in the formal
charge was curable under section 537, Cr.P.C, but

on the contrary section 232 also provides that:

232. Effect of material error. — (1) If any
Appellate Court, or the High Court or Court of
Session in the exercise of power of revision or of
its powers under Chapter XVII, is of opinion that
any person convicted of an offence was misled in
his defence by the absence of a charge or by any
error in the charge, it shall direct a new trial to be
held upon a charge framed in whatever manner it
thinks fit.

(2) If the Court is of opinion that the facts of the
case are such that no valid charge would be
preferred against the accused in respect of the
facts proved, it shall quash the conviction.

Thus, the learned trial Court had framed
the initial charge in an oblivious and stereotype
manner against the record. The said practice
generally adopted by the trial judges with regard to
framing of charge against the law on the subject

could not be left unattended.

8. In view of the above, this appeal is
allowed, the judgment dated 27.07.2019 of the
learned trial Court is set aside and the case is
remanded to the learned trial Court with directions
to summon PW Momin Khan for his cross-
examination and thereafter decide the case after
hearing the parties. Appellant Muhammad Ali was

on bail, hence, he shall remain on bail, however, he

shall furnish fresh bail bonds in the sum of
Rs.200,000/- (rupees two hundred thousand) with
two trustworthy and reliable sureties to satisfaction
of the learned trial Court within two weeks from
18.02.2021. The Remaining appellants shall be
treated as under trial prisoners. Needless to mention
that the learned trial Court shall complete the
proceedings within 03 months positively from
18.02.2021 if not possible earlier. Parties are
directed to appear before the trial Court on
18.02.2021. The connected Cr.R No. 74-M/ 2019,
being infructuous for the time being, is

accordingly dismissed.

9. Before parting with this judgment, in
order to avoid such like complications in future,
the trial Courts throughout the province shall
revisit the charges already framed against the
accused in the pending/ running cases and shall, in
case of any errors or omissions, make alterations or
amendments in accordance with section 227, Cr.P.C.
It is further reiterated that the learned trial judges
shall frame the charge themselves and shall not rely

on the formal charge framed by stenographers or
