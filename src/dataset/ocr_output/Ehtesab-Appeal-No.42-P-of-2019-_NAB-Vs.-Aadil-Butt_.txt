Date of hearing: 07.11.2019
Mr. Muhammad Riaz Mohmand, Special Prosecutor for

the appellant/NAB.

Mr. Shahid Naseem Khan Chamkani, Advocate for
respondents/accused.

AHMAD ALI, J.- The National Accountability Bureau,
Islamabad, through its Prosecutor General has preferred
the present appeal against the Judgment dated 14.09.2018,
passed by learned Judge Accountability Court No. IV,

Peshawar, in the case Reference No.02/2012.

2. Facts of the case, essential for the decision of
present appeal as divulged in the NAB Reference
No.02/2012, are that the respondents along with

absconding co-accused Anjum Javed Butt, being real
brothers inter-se, established three property dealing office
in Peshawar and deceived many persons by taking money
from them on the pretext of high return on investment in
the property business and purchasing plots in Hayatabad
Peshawar and finally deprived them from their actual
amount. The role attributed to each of the accused by the

NAB is summarized as under:

i. That the absconding accused Anjum Javed
Butt established a property business in the
name & Style of Mashoor-e-Alam Property
Dealer who deceitfully deprived the
complainant Professor Iqbal Ahmad Awan
from a total amount of Rs.16,00,000/- on the
ploy to invest the amount in the auction of
plot at Phase-3, Hayatabad Peshawar, in the
year 1997; and in return absconding accused
handed over him three cheques of different
amounts but the same were dishonoured. The
absconding accused Anjum Javed Butt also
deceitfully received amounts of Rs.5,60,000/-
, Rs.2,00,000/- and Rs.4,40,000/- from Dr.
Sahib Dad Khan making a total of

Rs.12,00,000/- however, an amount of
ii.

Rs.1,60,000/- was returned to Dr. Sabid Dad
Khan and an amount of Rs.10,40,000/- is still
outstanding against him (Anjum Javed Butt)
whereas, the cheques of the said amount have
been dishonoured. Similarly, Mrs. Shahnaz
Javed and Zahida Gulfam, Tahir Rauf were
also defrauded by the absconding accused
who were deprived of a total amount of

Rs.73,40,000/-.

Adeel Butt, the respondent No.1, had also
established an unregistered business of
property dealing in the name & style of
Zahoor-e-Alam Property dealer and the said
respondent in connivance with his brother
Anjum Javed Butt (absconding co-accused)
succeeded in misappropriating an amount of
RS.16,60,000/- from complainant Professor
Iqbal Ahmad Awan. Likewise, one Irfan
Orakzai was also deceitfully deprived of his
amount Rs.500,000/- by respondent No.1 on

the ruse of investment.
iii. The allegations against respondent No.2 are
that, he was running a real estate business in
the name & style of Aisha Business Centre
and Mr. Gulfam Khan (late) purchased two
plots in Phase-VI Hayatabad through the
respondent No.2. However, documents were
fake and therefore, Gulfam Khan contacted
respondent No.2 for the return of his amount.
In return, the respondent No.2 executed a
promissory note dated 01.05.1993 for an
amount of Rs.3,63,000/- with an affidavit
dated 15.05.1993 in favour of Gulfam Khan.
On 06.01.1994, he executed an agreement
dated 06.01.1994 with the widow of Gulfam
Khan namely Mst. Zahida Gulfam for the

payment of amount till 02.02.1994.

3. That all three accused swindled different people by
depriving them from a total amount of Rs.98,63,000/-;
thus, affectees approached NAB Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
and lodged complaint. Initially an inquiry was initiated
which was later converted into investigation and upon
completion of investigation the Reference No.02/2012

was sent for the trial of accused wherein all the three
accused were not arrested. Only present respondents No.1
& 2 faced the trial while their co-accused Anjum Javed
Butt evaded to appear before the court, resultantly he was

declared as proclaimed offender.

4. Trial of the NAB Reference No.02/2012 was
commenced before learned Judge Accountability Court
No. IV, Peshawar, whereby the prosecution produced 17
witnesses to support the charge against accused. Having
recorded the prosecution evidence and that of the
statement of accused u/s 342 Cr.P.C, finally, after hearing
arguments, the learned Judge Accountability Court No.
IV, Peshawar, acquitted both the respondents by
extending them benefit of doubt vide Judgment dated
14.09.2018 and their properties were also unfrozen.
Hence, present appeal has been filed against the acquittal

order of respondents No.1 & 2.

5. Learned Special Prosecutor General argued that the
respondents (acquitted accused) while joining hand with
their absconding co-accused planned a setup of real estate
business at three different places of Peshawar as a ploy to
fetch the amount from general public on the pretext of

high return on investment in the real estate business. They
use to manipulate the people to invest amount in the
auction of plots in the Hayatabad Peshawar and after
receiving the amount they embezzled the same. He
maintained that respondents have played a pivotal role in
the offence of cheating public at large and actively
facilitated their absconding co-accused. The evidence so
produced by the prosecution is sufficient to establish the
charge against them but the learned court below has
acquitted respondents without recording any cogent
reasons. The leniency shown by _ the learned
Accountability Court in favour of respondents is

unfounded and without any plausible explanation.

6. Learned counsel, appearing on _ behalf of
respondents, controverted the arguments so advanced by
the Special Prosecutor General and argued that there is
nothing on the record which may connect the respondents
with the commission of crime. The material so collected
by the investigating officer is against the absconding
accused. The respondent Adeel Butt was a law student
during the relevant days and he was having no concern
with the business dealings of his brother, now absconding.
The respondents have been implicated in the present case

in order to pressurize them only for the reason that their
brother has gone into hiding. He maintained that the
learned court below has properly appreciated the facts,
evidence, record and reached at proper conclusion of the
trial by acquitting both the respondents. He prayed for the

dismissal of present appeal.

7. After arguing the case at blue streak by both the

learned counsel, the record gone through.

8. Perusal of the record reveals that the allegation
against respondent No.1 (Adeel Butt) are that, he
established an unregistered business of property dealing in
the name & style of Zahoor-e-Alam Property dealer and
the said respondent in connivance with his brother Anjum
Javed Butt (absconding co-accused) succeeded in
misappropriating an amount of Rs.16,60,000/- from
complainant Professor Iqbal Ahmad Awan. Likewise, one
Irfan Orakzai was also deceitfully deprived of his amount
Rs.500,000/- by respondent No.1 on the ruse of

investment.

9. The prosecution could not produce the said Irfan
Orakzai to depose against the petitioner and as such
allegations to this extent are scanty of the proof. Whereas,

Prof. Iqbal Ahmad Awan appeared in the witness box as
PW-16 and stated in his examination in chief that accused
Adeel Butt received a total amount of Rs.16,60,000/- from
him for investment. However, in his cross-examination,
he admitted that he received a total sum of Rs.38,00,000/-
from accused Adeel Butt on different occasions. In this
way the said PW has not only received his principal
amount but also received profit amount much more than
the actual invested amount. Therefore, the accused Adeel
Butt though took the amount for investment from PW-16
but paid him back the double of said amount with much
more profit, and as such, there exists no charge against the

respondent No.1.

10. Now adverting to the charges levelled against
respondent No.2 / Muhammad Azeem Butt are that, he
was running a real estate business in the name & style of
Aisha Business Centre and Mr. Gulfam Khan (late)
purchased two plots in Phase-VI Hayatabad through the
respondent No.2. However, documents were fake and
therefore, Gulfam Khan contacted respondent No.2 for the
return of his amount. In return, the respondent No.2
executed a promissory note dated 01.05.1993 for an
amount of Rs.3,63,000/- with an affidavit dated

15.05.1993 in favour of Gulfam Khan. On 06.01.1994, he
executed an agreement dated 06.01.1994 with the widow
of Gulfam Khan namely Mst. Zahida Gulfam for the

payment of amount till 02.02.1994.

11. There is no denial of the fact that the amount was
allegedly given to the respondent No.2/Muhammad
Azeem Butt by the deceased Gulfam Khan. There is no
iota of evidence to show that what was the purpose, terms
& conditions of the transaction between Gulfam Khan and
respondent No.2 and whether this amount was actually for
the purpose of plots or else. Also, there is nothing to
suggest that the purported fake documents of plots were
delivered by the accused Muhammad Azeem to deceased
Gulfam Khan. So far as the statement of widow of
deceased Mst. Zahida Gulfam recorded as PW-14 is
concermed, she was not personally present on the occasion
of any sort of deal between Gulfam Khan and the accused
Muhammad Azeem Butt and as such, her evidence to this
extent is only a piece of hearsay evidence, which cannot
be taken into account. Nevertheless, her statement
regarding execution of promissory note dated 01.05.1993
for an amount of Rs.3,63,000/- with an affidavit dated
15.05.1993 coupled with the agreement dated 06.01.1994

at the most constitutes civil liability. Had there been any
10

criminal intention in the mind of respondent No.2 then he
would have not bound himself under the supra pro-note,
affidavit and agreement admitting payment of
Rs.3,63,000/-. It would not be out of place to mention that
the deceased Gulfam Khan, during his lifetime, never
opted to avail any legal remedy against the respondent
No.2 for the recovery of purported amount of
Rs.3,63,000/-. Not a single document is there to connect

the respondent No.2 with the commission of offence.

12. Thus, elements of cheating, fraud and
embezzlement of the amount with criminal intent are
squarely missing against respondents No.l & 2. The
evidence so produced by prosecution is scanty and fall
short of the required standard to establish charges against
respondents No.1 & 2. It can be safely held that there is
absolutely no direct or circumstantial evidence to bring
the accused/respondent to the book; and it seems that the

prosecution tried to make bricks without straw.

13. The depositions of prosecution witnesses are totally
inconsistent with the safe administration of justice. The
rule of benefit of doubt is essentially a rule of prudence,

which cannot be ignored while dispensing justice. This
11

rule is based on the maxim “it is better if ten guilty
persons are acquitted than one innocent person is
convicted”. Under the Islamic Law too, the Holy Prophet
(PBUH) said that the “mistake of Qazi in releasing a
criminal is better than his mistake in punishing an
innocent”. Reliance could be placed on 2009 SCMR 230,
2011 SCMR 664, 2011 SCMR 646, 1984 PLD SC 433,
2012 MLD 1358, 2007 SCMR 1825, 2008 P.Cr.L.J 376,
1994 PLD Peshawar 114, 2012 PLD Peshawar 01, 1999
P.Cr.L.J_1087, 1997 SCMR_ 449, 2011 SCMR 820 &

2006 P.Cr.L.J SC 1002.

14. So, by cutting the cackle, the learned trial court has
properly evaluated the prosecution evidence and rightly
extended the benefit of doubt to both the respondents.
Charges levelled against respondents only constitute civil
liabilities, and as such, both of them have rightly been
acquitted from the charges. Resultantly this appeals fails,
hence, dismissed.
