QAISER RASHID KHAN, J. After having been
refused bail by the learned Additional Sessions Judge
Shabqadar vide order dated 14.9.2015 in case FIR No.
373 dated 11.7.2015 registered under sections
302/324/34/ 109 PPC, Police Station Shabqadar District
Charsadda, the instant application has been moved for
the same very relief.

2. The allegations against the accused-petitioner and
his absconding co-accused, Shaukat, are that at their
instance and abetment the principal accused namely,

Wilayat and Gohar, had committed the murder of the
father of the complainant with fire arms, hence the FIR

ibid.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the

accused-petitioner is innocent and has been falsely

implicated in the case; that no independent ocular or

circumstantial evidence exists to connect the accused-

petitioner with the commission of the offence; that the

accused-petitioner was not present at the spot at the time

of alleged firing by the principal accused; that except the

bare allegations in the FIR nothing is available on the

record to connect the accused-petitioner with the

commission of offence, therefore, keeping in view the

facts and circumstances, the case of the accused-

petitioner calls for further probe into the matter which

thus entitles him to the grant of bail.

4. The learned counsel for the complainant opposed

the bail petition and contended that it was on account of

blood feud that the principal accused had committed the

murder of the father of complainant at the instance and

abetment of the accused-petitioner and absconding co-
accused namely, Shaukat, and thus he is not entitled to

the concession of bail.

5. The learned AAG in all fairness did not oppose

the bail petition and stated that the available record

indeed calls for further probe into the matter.

Arguments heard & available record perused.

6. As the record reveals, it was the complainant who

reported about the murder of his father namely, Bakht

Badshah, at the hands of Wilayat and Gohar sons of

Malang with fire arms whereafter they decamped from

the spot. However, in his report he also pointed an

accusing finger at the accused-petitioner and absconding

co-accused Shaukat for having abetted the offence and

stated the motive to be previous blood feud. Whether the

accused-petitioner had indeed connived and colluded

with his absconding co-accused namely, Shaukat, who

happens to be his brother and thus abetted the murder of

the father of the complainant at the hands of his two

brothers, is not evident from the present record except

through the allegations in the F.I.R. It is still a wild
goose chase for the investigating agency to ascertain the

involvement of the accused-petitioner having abetted the

offence and that is how the situation calls for further

probe into the matter, the beneficiary of which could be

thus none other but the accused-petitioner. As such I

hold the accused-petitioner entitled to the concession of

bail.

7. Accordingly, this bail petition is allowed and the

accused-petitioner is granted bail provided he furnishes

bail bonds in the sum of Rs.100000/- (one lac) with two

sureties, each in the like amount, to the satisfaction of

the learned trial court concerned which shall ensure that

the sureties are local, reliable and men of means.

8. Before parting with this order, it is directed that
any observations recorded in this order, being purely
tentative in nature, should in no way prejudice the
proceedings before the learned trial Court where the
case be decided on its own merits after recording
evidence.
