QALANDAR_ ALI KHAN, J:- = Sher Ali,

appellant, was charged for the Qatl-i-amd of
brother of complainant Ali Yar, namely, Shah
Room vide FIR No.553 dated 27.08.2010

under section 302 PPC Police Station Yar
Hussain, Swabi; and after facing trial in the
Trial Court/Additional Sessions Judge, Lahor
(Swabi), was convicted under section 302 (b)
PPC, and awarded the sentence of death; and
also held liable to pay compensation to the
tune of Rs:500000/- or in default to suffer
imprisonment for one year, with further order
that the entire amount of compensation, if
realized, be paid to the legal heirs of the
deceased in terms of section 544-A Cr.P.C. In
his impugned judgment dated 26.07.2016, the
learned trial Court/Additional Sessions Judge,
Lahor (Swabi) observed that the sentence of
death shall be subject to confirmation by this
Court; and as such, reference was forwarded
to this Court for confirmation or otherwise of
the sentence of death in terms of section 374
Cr.P.C.

2. On 27.08.2010, the complainant, Ali
Yar son of Sher Aman Khan, brought the dead
body of his brother, Shah Room Khan, to Yar
Hussain Hospital and in the casualty of the

Hospital, he reported to Shad Ali Khan S.1,
Police Station, Yar Hussain (PW-5), who
reached the hospital on receiving information
about the occurrence, that on the eventful day
he alongwith his deceased brother Shah
Room Khan, Zahid Khan son of Bahadar
Khan and Ishtiaqg Khan son of Safdar Ali
Khan, his co-villagers, was present in his
Mosque situated in village Sokhtha after
offering Juma prayers; and, in the meantime,
the appellant-accused, Sher Ali resident of
Rashaka, presently Nazir of his younger
brother Abne Aman Khan, came there duly
armed with deadly weapon and opened fire at
Shah Room, with which the latter was hit and
died on the spot. Complainant claimed that
they were empty handed, therefore, could do
nothing, while the accused made good his
escape after commission of the offence. The
occurrence was stated to have been
witnessed beside the complainant by Zahid
Khan, Ishtiaq Khan and other people present
in the Mosque. The motive for the occurrence

was cited as_ altercation between his
deceased brother and appellant-accused in
the morning over sale/purchase of orchards.
The report of the complainant was reduced
into writing in murasila (EX.PA/1) by the Sub-
Inspector, mentioned hereinabove, and
besides the complainant, also signed by Zahid
Khan son of Khan Bahadar Khan, resident of
Dobyan.

3. The Postmortem examination of the
deceased revealed one firearm entry wound
on left side of upper lip 0.5 X 1 cm dia, no
charring; with corresponding exit wound on
right side, lower back of skull 1 X 2 cm dia.
During investigation, |.O also inspected spot,
during which, he recovered one spent bullet in
deformed shape from inside the cupboard and
also secured a blood stained piece of the
carpet in the Mosque. The blood stained piece
of carpet and blood stained garments of the
deceased were sent to the FSL, Peshawar, for
chemical analysis, and report of the chemical
examiner was received in the affirmative,

showing human blood and of the same group.
The core of the bullet was found content of
7.62 MM bore bullet by the firearms expert.
The I.O prepared site plan on the pointation of
the complainant on the same day i.e.
27.08.2010. The appellant-accused remained
at large and was, therefore, proceeded
against under Sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C
and challan was submitted against him under
section 512 Cr.P.C. The appellant-accused
was declared P.O and perpetual warrant of
arrest was issued against him vide order of
the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Lahor
(Swabi) dated 10.01.2011. He was, later on,
arrested in injured condition from LRH,
Peshawar on 26.07.2014; where he was
under treatment being an injured complainant
in case vide FIR No.98 dated 25.07.2014
under sections 302/324/148/149 PPC, Police
Station Khan Mai, Charsadda; and on his,
alleged, pointation, while in police custody, a
Kalashnikov 7.62 bore with fixed charger
containing 10 rounds was recovered from the

vacant house of Abne Aman Khan. On the
expiry of his police custody, the appellant-
accused was produced before the Judicial
Magistrate, but he did not make confessional
statement. The report of firearms expert about
the recovered 7.62 MM bore SNG rifle No.56-
1-32141006 was that the same was local
made and in proper working order in its
present condition. After recording statements
of the PWs under section 161 Cr.P.C and
completion of investigation, supplementary
challan was submitted against the appellant-
accused, leading to commencement of trial in
the Court of learned Additional Sessions
Judge, Lahor (Swabi), where, after
compliance with provision of section 265-C
Cr.P.C, formal charge under section 302 PPC
was framed against the appellant-accused, to
which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
4. During trial, the prosecution produced
eight PWs, as follows;

e Muhammad Ali DFC (PW-1), executed

warrant of arrest under section 204
Cr.P.C as well as proclamation under
section 87 Cr.P.C;

Raj Wali S.| (PW-2), registered FIR
(EX.PA) on the receipt of murasila
(EX.PA/1);

Ali Yar (PW-3), the complainant;

Ishtiaq Khan (PW-4), the eyewitness;
Shad Ali SHO/Inspector (PW-5), drafted
murasila (EX.PA/1), on the report of the
complainant, which was sent by him to
the Police Station for registration of the
FIR; and he also prepared injury sheet
(EX.PW-5/1) and = inquest report
(EX.PW5/2);

Doctor Akbar Ali Shah (PW-6),
conducted autopsy on the dead body of
deceased Shah Room Khan, and
prepared P.M report (EX.PM);

Mera Khan S.| (PW-7), arrested the
accused on 26.07.2014 and issued his
card of arrest (EX.PW/7/1); and also,
allegedly, recovered Kalashnikov on the

pointation of the appellant-accused; and
e Wafadar Khan $.l (Rtd) (P
W-8), conducted investigation in the
case;

5. Muhammad Iqbal DFC No.119 (SW-1),
recorded statement about PW Zahid Khan,
thereby, informing the Court about murder of
PW Zahid Khan in the year 2001 vide case
FIR No.365/2011 under section 302 PPC,
whereupon, PW Zahid Khan was abandoned
by the prosecution; but, later on, vide order
sheet No.20 dated 28.09.2015, statement of
PW Muhammad Zahid Khan recorded during
proceedings under section 512 Cr.P.C as PW-
2 was transferred to the present case on the
application of D.P.P; after learned defence
counsel expressed his no objection over such
transfer.

6. After prosecution closed its evidence,
statement of the accused was recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein, he, though,
refuted allegations of the prosecution, but
declined to be examined on Oath or produce

defence evidence. The _ learned _ trial
Court/Additional Sessions Judge, Lahor
(Swabi), after hearing learned Deputy Public
Prosecutor on behalf of the State, assisted by
learned counsel for the complainant, as well
as learned defence counsel, rendered
impugned judgment dated 26.07.2016,
whereby, the appellant was convicted under
section 302 (b) PPC and sentenced to death,
with further sentence to pay compensation to
the tune of Rs:500000/- or in default to
imprisonment of one year; hence the instant
appeal.

7. Arguments of learned counsel for the
appellant and learned AAG assisted by
learned counsel for the complainants, heard;
and record perused.

8. The prosecution case against the
convict-appellant, Sher Ali, was that as a
single accused directly charged in the FIR
lodged within one hour and five minutes of
the occurrence, he committed qatl-i-amd of
brother of the complainant, who received

single firearm injury, witnessed by other two
eye witnesses besides the complainant and
other several people present in the mosque
i.e. the place of occurrence, after ‘Juma
prayers; and that the occurrence was
prompted by the motive of altercation between
the deceased and_ the appellant/accused
early in the morning over sale/purchase of
orchards. However, when put to trial, inherent
defects/discrepancies in the case of
prosecution came to _ surface; which,
unfortunately, escaped the notice of the
learned trial Court while awarding capital
punishment to the appellant/accused.

9. In the report lodged in the casualty of
Yar Hussain Hospital at 1500 hours on the
eventful day i.e. 27.08.2010, the time of
occurrence was mentioned as 1355 hours; but
the postmortem report showed examination of
the dead body on 27.08.2010 at 02.20 PM, i.e.
1420 hours, which was 40 minutes earlier
than the time of report to the police in the
casualty of Yar Hussain Hospital; where, first,

report of the complainant was reduced into
writing by Shad Ali Khan/S.| P.S Yar Hussain
(PW5); and, then, inquest report was prepared
by him and the deceased was referred to
Medical Officer for P.M examination. In other
words, P.M examination of the deceased was
conducted prior to lodging of the report to the
police by the complainant, thus shaking the
very foundation of FIR. {2012 SCMR 172 and
1990 SCMR 1134}.

10. In the FIR, the complainant clearly
stated that his deceased brother, Shah Room,
was hit with the firing of the appellant/accused
and died on the spot; but it is not clear as to
why, then, the dead body was taken to the
Hospital, instead of the Police Station.
Moreover, the P.M report showing 10 to 20
minutes between injury and death, which is
approximately the same time (15/20 minutes)
for which the dead body was shown lying on
the spot, after the occurrence, in the
statement of the complainant (PW.3), without
any step taken by the complainant and other

persons present in the mosque for removing
the deceased, then injured, to the hospital:
which would also cast doubt on the
authenticity of the FIR, showing instantaneous
death of the deceased and, further, serious
doubt about presence of the complainant at
the time of occurrence. The |.0 not only
collected a blood stained piece of carpet
during spot inspection but also received
blood stained garments of the deceased from
the Medical Officer who conducted P.M
examination of the deceased; but neither
hands and clothes of the complainant nor that
of the two eye witnesses mentioned in the
FIR, were found smeared with blood, despite
the fact, the complainant was real brother of
the deceased and so-called eyewitnesses his
closed relatives, and in a natural course, if, at
all, they were present on the spot should have
helped their near and dear to remove him to
the hospital, after having received firearm
injury and blood, admittedly oozing from his

firearm injury having entry and exit wounds.
{2015 SCMR 1142, 1980 SCMR 126, 2015
P.Cr.LJ 416 (Peshawar)}

11. The very presence of the complainant
and the so-called eye witnesses in the private
mosque of the complainant and the deceased
where the occurrence allegedly took place is
open to doubt, as not only Jaamia-Masjid,
where Juma prayers were offered, was
situated at not a too distant place from the
houses of the complainant and deceased, but
the so-called eyewitnesses namely Ishtiaq
Khan and Zahid Khan were ‘chance
witnesses’ as they were not the inhabitants of
village Sokhta, where the occurrence took
place; because the former hail from village
Daulat situated at a distance of 2/3 kilometers
from the scene of occurrence, while Zahid
Khan deceased PW belonged to another
village, Dobian, situated at a distance of 5
kilometers from the place of occurrence. The
non-recording of statement of Pesh-i-lmam
and other number of persons shown present

in the mosque in the FIR and their non-
production as prosecution witnesses would
create further dent in the prosecution case,
besides making presence of the complainant
and the so-called eye witnesses on the spot at
the time of occurrence doubtful. Apart from
the above, the complainant and the so-called
eye witnesses were shown very close from
the place assigned to the deceased in the site
plan, 1/2 paces from each other; but neither
the complainant nor the so-called eye
witnesses received a single scratch as a result
of alleged firing by the appellant/accused from
backside. {2015 SCMR 1142, 1997 SCMR
441, 1995 SCMR 1293, 2010 SCMR 566,
2006 SCMR 1846, 2011 SCMR 646, 2015
P.Cr.LJ 416 (Peshawar), 2015 P.Cr.LJ 585
(Peshawar), 2015 P.Cr.LJ 1023 (Peshawar),
2016 YLR 905 (Peshawar) and 2016 MLD
757 (Peshawar)}.

12. According to the FIR, the deceased,
complainant, eye witnesses and _ other
worshipers were present in the mosque after

offering Juma Prayers, and presence of the
appellant/accused is shown on the back side
of the deceased at the time of occurrence;
but the postmortem report shows entry wound
on left side of upper lip, while exit wound on
right side, lower of scalp, thus showing the
entry wound from the front side; and in order
to cover this, apparently, conflicting positions,
improvement were made in the statement of
Ishtiaq Khan (PW4), by stating that the
appellant/accused called “Aiwaz: the decd and
made firing from front on him”. Likewise, PW
Muhammad Zahid Khan, in his statement
during proceedings under Section 512 Cr.PC
against the appellant/accused, made this
improvement that the appellant/accused
“called the deceased on which the deceased
(wrongly written as accused in the statement)
when attracted to him/accused, the accused
made a fire shot at the deceased”. These are,
indeed, fatal improvements in order to bring
the prosecution case in conformity with the
P.M report, showing entry wound from front

side, which was contrary to the FIR and the
site plan showing fire shot from backside of
the deceased. Needless to say that such
improvements caused further damage to the
prosecution case against the
appellant/accused. {NLR 2003 C.R 577
(Supreme Court), 1970 SCMR 467, 1981
SCMR 132 and 2011 SCMR 474}.

13. It needs be urged here that despite
transfer of statement of deceased PW
Muhammad Zahid Khan in proceedings under
Section 512 Cr.PC against the
appellant/accused, his statement in
proceedings under Section 512 Cr.PC having
not been subjected to cross examination
would hardly be of any help to the prosecution
case in view of judgments reported as {2017
MLD 973 (Peshawar), 2017 MLD 883
(Peshawar) and 2013 MLD 810}.

14. No doubt, the motive of altercation
earlier in the morning between the deceased
and appellant/accused over sale/purchase of
Orchards was alleged in the FIR; but nothing

was brought on record to substantiate the
motive. Admittedly, the prosecution is not
bound to establish motive in each and every
case; but once motive is alleged and not
proved, then prosecution must suffer the
consequences. (2010 SCMR 97).

15. In the wake of so much doubts and
contradictions in the case of prosecution
against the appellant, neither the
appellant/accused nominated as a single
accused in the case nor his abscondence for
considerable period would dis-entitle him to
the benefit of doubt, guaranteed to him by all
canons of justice, reflected in law of the land
in unequivocal terms. {2007 SCMR 1427,
2010 SCMR 566, 2016 YLR_= 1166
(Peshawar), 2016 YLR 905, 2016 MLD 557
and 2017 MLD 883 (Peshawar)}.

16. In short, there were discrepancies,
contradictions and improvements in the case
of prosecution; which could, obviously, not
lead to conviction of the appellant/accused,
what to speak of award of death sentence to

him; but it seems all such
doubts/discrepancies escaped notice of the
learned trial Court while awarding sentence of
death to the appellant/accused.

17. Consequently, the appeal is allowed,
and conviction and sentence recorded by
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Lahor
(Swabi) dated 26.07.2016 are set aside. The
appellant is acquitted of the charge leveled
against him and be set free forthwith, if not
required in any other case.

18. Murder Reference No.11-P/2016 sent
by the learned trial Court for confirmation of
the sentence is answered in the negative.

Announced.
