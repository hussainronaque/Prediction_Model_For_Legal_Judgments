JUDGMENT

AHMAD ALL, J. The instant appeal is directed against the
judgment and order dated 20.02.2019 passed by the
learned Sessions Judge/Judge, Special Court, Nowshera,
whereby application of the appellant for superdari of
vehicle (Heno Truck) bearing registration No. LED-18-
5525, involved in case FIR No.72 dated 09.02.2019 u/s 9©
CNSA, PS Azakhel (Nowshera), was dismissed.

2. Brief facts of the case are that the vehicle in question
was taken into custody by the local police in case FIR ibid,
being involved in transportation of narcotics.

3. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the
appellant, who is Chief Executive of registered company
“Express Logistics” and running business in transportation
of various goods since long and services of the accused
Javed Abbas and Ibn-e-Hussain were hired as drivers and

appellant is the law abiding citizen and never ever
involved in any such like activities; that on the day of
occurrence certain goods were loaded in vehicle in
question from “Express Logistics” and to this effect builty
No.17629 was prepared on 07.02.2019; and the vehicle in
question was handed over to the above named two drivers
for onward transportation to Peshawar City. The vehicle in
question was leased out in the name of “Express Logistics”
and appellant was totally unaware regarding involvement
of the drivers in smuggling of narcotics. Appellant has
joined investigation and the IO recorded 161 Cr.P.C
statement of the appellant and it was the appellant who
disclosed the names of accused as both the accused
mentioned hereinabove were not arrested by the police on
the spot and who are still absconding; and the appellant is
the lawful and genuine owner of the vehicle having no
conscious knowledge about the crime and that there is no
rival claimant. Learned AAG representing the state
contended that complete challan in the instant case has not
yet been submitted and it will be too early to accept the
instant appeal; that huge quantity of different narcotics
were recovered from the vehicle in question and it will be
decided by the learned Trial Court after recording of the
evidence what whether appellant was in knowledge of the

act of the accused-drivers.
4. We have given our anxious consideration to the
submissions made by the learned Counsel for the appellant
and learned AAG; and gone through the record of the case

with their able assistance.

5. Without dilating upon the question of ownership of
the vehicle as the appellant is not the accused in the case.
He is asking for the superdari of the vehicle on the ground
that he is the owner of the vehicle. Superdari of the vehicle
was refused to him by the learned Session Judge/JSC,

Nowshera vide his order/judgment dated 20.02.2019.

6. No doubt, Section 74 of the Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 1997 (CNSA) imposes certain conditions
on the release of any transport involved in the

transportation of narcotics and reads as follows:-

74. “Application of other laws...., if an offence
punishable under this Act, is also an offence in any
other law for the time being in force, nothing in that
law shall prevent the offender from being punished
under this Act”;

Provided that nothing contained in Section 523
of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898),
or any other provision of the said Code or any other
law for the time being in force, the custody of narcotic
drugs, psychotropic substance, controlled substance,
any material, utensils, used for production or
manufacture of such drugs or substances or any
conveyance used in import, export, transport or
transshipment thereof or for commission of an

offence under this Act, shall not be given on custody
to the accused or any of his associate or relative or

any private individual till the conclusion of the case”.
7. Question for the determination is, as to whether the
owner of the vehicle, who is not involved as an accused in
the case can be deprived of the custody of the transport
involved in the crime until the conclusion of the Trial?
8. Admitted position is that the appellant is the real
owner and there is no dispute about it.
9. The forbidding provision of Section 74 of CNSA,
1997 deprives the accused, his associate or relative or any
private individual from the pre-trial custody of the vehicle
involved which obviously means that the accused or
anyone else on his side is excluded in this connection. The
term “Private Individual” appeared in the section would
also be related to the accused’s side and purpose of adding
this term was to deprive any surcum-mention of law by the
accused’s side so that any private individual who may not
be the relative of accused or the associate of the accused in
any legal sense he was connected to the accused otherwise
be also kept within the deprived category.
10. The case of the owner of a vehicle who may be
running taxi service or rent a car service or where he
handed over his vehicle to a driver for running and earn for
him as the case in hand; and who has nothing to do with

the crime, is not an accused in the case is altogether
different, and the law will have to show its benevolence as
far as he is concerned. The interpretation of Section 74 of
the CNSA 1997, even if, strictly construed would place
such person outside the ambit of forbidding clauses of the
section. Otherwise, there would be unjust results for an
owner and this cannot be a policy of law.

11. Sections 32 of the CNSA, 1997 reads as under:-

32. Articles connected with narcotics —
(1) Whenever an offence has been committed which is
punishable under this Act, the narcotic drug,
psychotropic substance or _ controlled substance,
materials, apparatus and utensils in respect of which, or
by means of which, such offence has been committed shall
be liable to confiscation;
(2) Any narcotic drug, psychotropic substance or
controlled substance lawfully imported, transported,
manufactured, possessed, or sold alongwith, or in
addition to, any narcotic drug, psychotropic substance or
controlled substance which is liable to confiscation under
sub-section (1) and the receptacles or packages, and the
vehicles, vessels and other conveyances used in carrying
such drugs and substances shall likewise be liable to
confiscation;

Provided that no _ vehicle, vessel or other
conveyance shall be liable to confiscation unless it is
proved that the owner thereof knew that the offence was

being, or was to be, committed.

12. Two provisions of the Act deals with the disposal of
conveyance used in the commission of the crime. Section
32 provides for final disposal of the conveyance at the time

of conclusion of the trial while provision of 74 of the Act
ibid permits the grant of temporary custody of the vehicle
pending trial.

13. The present case involves interpretation of the latter
statutory proviso. Section 74 is not very happily worded
provision and the proviso to the section which deals with
the temporary custody of the vehicle involved in
trafficking narcotics has no nexus with the main provision
of the section which provides for the punishment of the
offender for an offence, in addition, to punishable under
other statutes. Having said that, proviso, relating to the
temporary custody of the conveyance involved in the
commission of the offence is couched in negative terms,
prohibiting custody to the accused or any of his associate
or relative or any other private individual....It follows that
the prohibition is neither absolute nor embarrassing.
Custody of such a conveyance can be granted to those who
do not fall within the said prohibitory, identifying accused
or his associate or relative would not ordinarily pose much
difficulty. The question that requires determination is
whether the owner of the conveyance, who otherwise does
not fall in the said class of persons, would come within the
mischief of phrase “any private individual”. The legislature
could not have intended that the said phrase should have
such an un restricted wide scope so as to include an “every

individual’ as such a _ construction would render
meaningless reference to specific persons preceding the
phrase. That part of the proviso would thus become
redundant. Obviously, the redundancy cannot be attributed
to legislature. Thus the only rational meaning to give the
phrase “any private individual” is to read it ejusdem
generis with the preceding specific word, accused or his
associate or relative.

14. By application of this Rule, the “private individual”
mentioned in the proviso refers to such individual, who has
some nexus with the offender or offence. Thus innocent
owner of the vehicle used in commission of the crime,
having no nexus, whatsoever, either with the accused or
crime, would not fall within the scope of phrase “private
individual’.

15. The provision of Section 32 of the Act, which deals
with the disposal of conveyance used in commission of the
crime at the conclusion of trial, also provides a useful tip in
interpreting the proviso of Section 74 of the Act. Section
32 empowers the trial court to order confiscation of the
vehicle used in trafficking of narcotics, with the proviso
that the vehicle shall not be confiscated unless it is proved
that the owner was aware that his vehicle was being used
in the crime. Not only that an innocent owner of the
vehicle is entitled to the return of vehicle but the burden

has been placed on the prosecution to establish that the
owner had the knowledge of his vehicle being used in the
commission of the crime. Thus, if an innocent owner of
vehicle unaware of the crime, is entitled to its return at the
conclusion of trial, has a corollary, in the absence of
express statutory provisions he shall also has the right to
obtain and retain its temporary custody pending trial.

16. In the instant case, all the ownership documents
have been produced by the appellant so much so the names
of actual culprits have also been disclosed by the appellant
and even after lapse of almost six months, challan has not
been put in court.

17. We thus conclude that the proviso to Section 74
does not forbid the release of vehicle involved in
trafficking of narcotics to his owner who is not connected
in any manner with the commission of the crime or the
accused and so unaware that his vehicle being used for the
crime. We have also noted that there is no rival claimant of
the vehicle. In these circumstances, the appellant is entitled
to the temporary custody of the vehicle.

18. Apart from the above, retention of vehicle in police
custody for an indefinite period would also not serve any
useful purpose.

19. Resultantly, the impugned order/judgment of the
learned Sessions Judge/JSC, Nowshera dated 20.02.2019 is

set aside and the vehicle (Heno Truck bearing Registration
No.LED-18-5525) is directed to be released on superdari
to the appellant provided he furnishes bail bonds in the
sum of rupees one million (Rs.1000000/-), with two
sureties, each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
learned Trial Court. The appellant shall also furnish
affidavit to the effect that he will not dispose of the vehicle
till final decision of the case; and that he will produce the
same before the learned Trial Court whenever required.
