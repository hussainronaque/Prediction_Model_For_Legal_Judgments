Date of hearing: - 17.10.2022

Petitioners: (Naseeb Khan _& others) by Mr. Hazrat
Rehman, Advocate.

Respondents:- (The State & another) by Mr. Saeed
Ahmad, Astt: A.G and Syed Abdul Hag, Advocate.

MUHAMMAD IJAZ KHAN J.- Through the instant
criminal revision petition, petitioners have challenged
the legality and propriety of the order and judgment of
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Samar Bagh Dir
Lower dated 03.02.2022 whereby the application of the
petitioners for adjourned sine die the proceedings in the
complaint filed against them was declined.

2. Precisely the facts leading to the filing of
instant petition are that the respondent/complainant
namely Muhammad Shah submitted an application to
the District Police Officer Dir Lower to the effect that
the petitioner No. 2 namely Mst. Rafia is his legally
wedded wife and being his legally wedded wife she has
entered into a second marriage with petitioner No. |
namely Naseeb Khan on the instigation of petitioner
No. 3 namely Umar Hussain. When the aforesaid

application was submitted to the D.P.O who marked

Nawab (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Jjaz Khan
-2-

the same to the SHO of Police Station Haya Serai for
report, who after recording statements of various
persons opined that it is a case of illegal and void
marriage within the meaning of section 494 PPC,
therefore, it was recommended that the parties may
approach to the family Court vide report dated
07.09.2020.

3. Thereafter, on 3% day of the aforesaid
report i.e. on 10.09.2020 the respondent No. 2 namely
Muhammad Shah filed a suit before the learned Judge
Family Court against Mst. Rafia Bibi, (petitioner No. 2
herein) for restitution of conjugal rights, in which Mst.
Rafia Bibi was summoned and who submitted her
written statement whereby she has categorically denied
the existence of her marriage with the respondent No. 2
namely Muhammad Shah.

4. It is also relevant to mention here that on
the day of filing of the aforesaid suit, the respondent
No. 2 simultaneously filed a petition under section 22-
A Cr. P.C for registration of the case against the
present petitioners and in this petition too when the
report was called from the local police it was again
reported that it is a case of illegal marriage, therefore, it
was recommended that the parties may approach to the

competent Court of law and as such the petition of

Nawab (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad ljaz Khan
<

-3-

respondent No. 2 under section 22-A Cr.P.C was
dismissed vide order and judgment dated 01.10.2020.
5. The record further shows that on 24" day
of the aforesaid order i.e. on 24.11.2020 the respondent
No. 2 then filed a complaint under section 200 Cr.P.C
with the same set of allegations which were earlier
agitated in the application to the D.P.O and then in the
petition filed under section 22- A Cr.P.C. In the
aforesaid compliant notices were issued to the present
petitioners and in the process charge has also been
framed against them.

6. The record shows that it was during the
pendency of this complaint when the present
petitioners submitted an application for adjourned sine
die of the proceedings in the instant complaint till the
decision of the family suit pending before the learned
Judge Family Court. After hearing both the parties, the
learned trial Court has dismissed the application for
adjourned sine die of the proceedings through the
impugned order dated 03.02.2022. Petitioners have
now challenged the aforesaid order and judgment
before this Court through the instant petition.

7. Arguments of learned counsel for the
parties as well as learned Astt: A.G for the State were

heard and the record perused with their able assistance.

8. It is the case of respondent/complainant
that the petitioner No. 2 namely Mst. Rafia Bibi is his
legally wedded wife and thus his allegations are that
during the existence of his marriage, the petitioner No.
1 has entered into an illegal and void marriage with
petitioner No. 2 on the instigation of petitioner No. 3,
however, it would be relevant to mention here that
when the respondent/complainant filed a suit for
restitution of conjugal rights then his alleged wife who
is petitioner No. 2 herein herself submitted her written
statement to the aforesaid suit where in preliminary
objection No. vi and Para 2 & 3 on the facts she has
categorically pleaded that the respondent/complainant
has already divorced her in September 2019 and
thereafter after observing the /ddat period she has
herself married with petitioner No. 1 in August 2020 as
by then she was ceased to be the wife of
respondent/complainant. The marriage between
petitioner No.1 and petitioner No. 2 has been admitted
by both the co-petitioner before the Court on the
ground that petitioner No. 2 was no more the wife of
respondent/complainant due to the divorce which has
already been taken place between them in September |
2019. The factum of divorce has not been alleged by
nobody else but the petitioner No. 2 herself who has

categorically pleaded in her written statements that in-

Nawab (5.B.) Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-5-

fact the respondent/complainant has since been
divorced her, therefore, she has entered into a legal and
lawful marriage with petitioner No. 1. The Court was
also informed that the couple has now been blessed
with a child as well. Whether in the given admitted
facts and circumstances the charge made in the
complaint could be brought home against the present
petitioners or not, the same is left to the wisdom of the
learned trial Court who is seized of the compliant,
however, since the existence of essential ingredients to
constitute an offence of illegal and void marriage is
totally and obviously dependent upon the existence of
the previous marriage between the complainant and
petitioner No. 2 and as these questions are to be
determined and adjudicated by the learned Judge
Family Court while deciding the suit for restitution of
conjugal rights filed by the respondent/ complainant
and as such for the time being the proceedings in the
complaint would be proceedings having an uncertain
and guessing end. It may be noted that if the
proceedings in the compliant are allowed to continue
and the present petitioners are convicted in the said
complaint and then at the end of the day the
respondent/complainant could not succeed to get a
favourable decree in the suit filed for restitution of

conjugal rights on the ground that there is no valid

Nawab (5.B.) Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Muhammad (jaz Khan
-6-

Nikah between the parties, then in such eventuality no
repair could be made of the suffering faced by the
present petitioners in the instant complaint.

9. It is settled since long that when a civil
Court and criminal Court are seized of the matter and the
result of one proceedings is having a direct bearing on
the result and outcome of another then in such state of
affairs the proceedings before the criminal Court has to
be halted till the decision of the case pending before the
civil Court. It may also be noted that an order of
adjourned sine die of the proceedings in a criminal
complaint would not at all prejudice the right of the
respondent/complainant as if he succeeds to establish
his valid Nikah with the petitioner No. 2 then he can
revive and restore the proceedings of the complaint, but
as against this, the continuation of the proceedings in the
compliant would definitely prejudice the interest of the
petitioners, as stated hereinabove, that if the same are
allowed to continue and petitioners are convicted and
thereafter the learned Judge Family Court dismissed the
suit for restitution of conjugal rights then in such
eventuality they will be allowed to suffer for no fault on
their part. In the case of “Muhammad Akbar v/s
The State” reported as PLD 1968 Supreme Court 281,
the Hon’ble Apex Court has held that normally it is
true, that criminal proceedings should not be postponed

pending the disposal of civil litigation

Nawab (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad tjaz Khan
-7-

connected with the same subject-matter. But where it is
clear that the criminal liability is dependent upon the
result of the civil litigation or is so intimately
connected with it that there is a danger of grave
injustice being done in the case if there be a conflict of
decision between the civil Court and the criminal
Court. In such event it is equally clear that the criminal
Court has not only the right to but should also stay its
hands until the civil litigation is disposed of, for, it is
not desirable that when the title to the property itself is
in dispute, the criminal Courts should give a finding in
respect of the same question. This is not a case in
which the criminal litigation is being stayed by an
order of the civil Court, but this-is a case where the
High Court, exercising its inherent criminal jurisdiction
under section 561-A of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, has in the interests of justice ordered the
stay of the criminal proceedings. Similarly, in the case
of “Abdul Ahad v/s Amjad Ali & others” reported as
PLD 2006 Supreme Court 771, the Hon’ble Apex
Court has reiterated the same rational by observing that
there is now consensus of opinion that there is no
invariable rule that a criminal proceeding should be
stayed pending the decision of civil suit but the matter
is one of discretion entirely. While exercising

discretion the guiding principle should be to see as to

Nawab (S.8.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-8-

whether the accused is likely to be prejudiced if the
criminal proceedings are not stayed in case of dispute
regarding title where it is difficult to draw a line
between a bona fide claim and the criminal action. All
the Courts below had exercised discretion in favour of
the respondent keeping in view the guiding principles
laid down by the superior Courts. See Muhammad
Akbar y. The State PLD 1968 SC 281; Sheikh Ahmad
v. Sheikh Muhammad Younis 1971 PCr. LJ 331 and
Mansharam Madhavadas_y. Chetanram_Rupchand
and others AIR 1945 Sindh 32. In a situation akin to
the present one this Court in the case of “Ikram Ullah
Khan v4 The State & 05 others” reported as 2011
YER 437 has held that normally criminal proceedings
should not be postponed pending the disposal of civil
litigation with the same subject-matter but where it is
clear that the criminal liability is dependent upon the
result of the civil litigation and is so intimately
connected with it, that there is a danger of grave
injustice being done in case if there be a conflict of
decision between the civil court and the criminal court
then in such event it is equally clear that the criminal
court not only has the right to but should also stay its
hands until the civil litigation is disposed of, for, it is

not desirable that when the title to the property is itself

a pr” |

-9-

in dispute, the criminal courts should give a finding in
respect of the same question.

10. In view of the above discussion and
exposition of law, this petition is allowed and the
consequently the impugned order and judgment dated
03.02.2022 passed by Additional Sessions Judge,
Samar Bagh Dir Lower is set aside and the proceedings
pending before the Court of learned Additional Session
Judge Samar Bagh Dir Lower in a complaint No. 1/2 of
2021 filed under section 200 Cr.P.C are adjourned sine
die till the decision of the family suit filed by the
respondent/complainant for the restitution of the
conjugal rights, however, both the parties shall be at
liberty to revive and restore the proceedings in the

instant complaint after the outcome of the aforesaid

suit.
