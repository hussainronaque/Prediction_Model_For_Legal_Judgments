SAHIBZADA_ASADULLAH, J.- Through this judgment, we

shall dispose of Cr.A. No.32-B of 2019, titled Zafar Iqbal Vs.
The State & another and connected Cr.R. No.16-B of 2019,
titled Nazirullah Vs. Zafar Iqbal, as both have arisen out of one
and the same judgment dated 14.02.2019, rendered by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-I, Karak, whereby the appellant,
charged in case FIR No.143 dated 14.4.2016, under Section
302 PPC, police station Sabir Abad, has been convicted under
Section 302(b) PPC and sentenced to imprisonment for life
with fine of Rs.2,00,000/- to be paid to ‘the legal heirs of
deceased Mir Badshah, in terms of Section 544-A, Cr.P.C. or in

default thereof to further suffer six months simple
2

imprisonment. Benefit of Section 382-B, Cr.P.C. has been

extended to the convict/appellant.

2. Facts of the case as spelt out from the FIR Ex.
PA, in brief, are that on 14.4.2016 at about 18:55 hours,
complainant Nazir Ullah (PW-14) with the help of co-villagers,
brought the dead body of his father to police station Sabir Abad
where he made report to Noor Jahan Khan S.I (PW-9) to the
effect that his father and one Aitebar Din were close friends;
that on the eventful day, he alongwith his father, uncle Khumar
Badshah went to the house of Aitebar Din and reached there at
about 17:00 hours, where accused/appellant, duly armed with
Kalashnikov came and started abusing his father, forbade him
from visiting their house, became angry and started firing, as a
result whereof, his father was hit and died on the spot. Besides
the complainant, the occurrence is stated to be witnessed by
Itebar Din and other relatives of the complainant. Motive for
the offence is stated to be friendship of father of complainant
with father of the accused upon which he was annoyed. He

charged the accused for the commission of offence.

3. On completion of investigation, challan was
submitted against the accused before the learned trial Court.
After compliance of provisions of Section 265-C Cr.P.C,
formal charge was framed against the accused to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order to prove guilt of
the accused, the prosecution examined as many as fourteen
witnesses, whereafter, accused was examined under section
342 Cr.P.C, wherein he professed innocence and false
implication, however, he opted to produce evidence in his
defence. In defence, the accused produced Shahid Nawaz,
Aitbar Din, Mst. Shamim Akhtar and Yar Muhammad as
DW-1 to DW-4, respectively. On conclusion of trial, the
learned trial Court vide impugned judgment dated 14.02.2019,
convicted the accused and sentenced him, as mentioned above,
which has been assailed by the appellant through the instant
appeal, whereas complainant Nazir Ullah has filed connected
criminal revision for enhancement of sentence awarded to the

appellant.

4. The learned counsel for the parties alongwith
Asstt: Advocate General were heard at length and with their

valuable assistance the record was gone through.
4
5. It was at 17:00 hours, when the deceased met a
tragic death resulting into a charge against the appellant. The
incident in issue allegedly occurred in the house of the
appellant and the cause of annoyance was the bromance
between the two i.e. the deceased and his father. Much was
argued regarding the innocence of the appellant and non-
presence of the witnesses at the stated time when the deceased
was done to death. The learned counsel went on to say that the
deceased lost his life at a considerable distance from the house
of the appellant/accused and that it was the father of the
appellant who with the help of the co-villagers shifted the
deceased to the police station and informed the complainant
regarding death of his father. It was lastly submitted that the
incident in issue went un-witnessed and that it was nothing but
mala fide which prompted the complainant to charge the
appellant. Contrarily, the other side advanced their arguments
in total rebuttal of what was submitted for the appellant with an

additional prayer for enhancement of sentence.

6. No doubt, the incident allegedly occurred in the
house of appellant and that the appellant is singularly charged

for murder of the deceased, but that alone is not sufficient
either to convict or maintain conviction rather the intricacies

requires much prudence and caution to avoid a confused

resolution that favours none but adds to injustice. No doubt, the

substitution of single accused in a murder charge is a rare

phenomenon, but at the same time the apex Court has also laid

down the law through various dictum that to put the rope

around the neck of an accused charged singularly, there must

be ocular account of unimpeachable character, trustworthy and

confidence inspiring, corroborated by circumstantial evidence.

In case titled, "Arshad Beg Vs. The State" (2017

SCMR 1727), it was held that:-

7.

succeeded in establishing their presence on the spot and as to

“Even otherwise this is a case of single accused
and substitution in such like cases is a rare
phenomenon as normally kith and kin of the
deceased (in this case real brothers) would not
implicate an innocent person by letting off the
real culprits. Therefore, we hold that both the
witnesses of ocular account were present at the
spot and had witnessed the occurrence. Ocular
account furnished by these witnesses is
substantially supported by medical evidence as
three firearm injuries were observed on the
person of Sharif Beg (deceased) out of which
only one was exit would whereas two were entry
wounds. Therefore, the prosecution case stood
proved against the appellant beyond any shadow
of doubt and conviction of the appellant under
section 302(b), P.P.C. is fully justified”.

We are to see as to whether the witnesses
6

whether the incident occurred in the mode, manner at the stated
time and in the house of the appellant. We cannot ignore that
the parties had no previous animosity, but the incident occurred
as the appellant did not like the constant visits of the deceased
to his father and his house. Though constant efforts were made
by the appellant to establish that the deceased was done to
death outside the house and that the death was the result of a
quarrel that took place between the deceased and the unknown
accused, it remained a mystery till the end that who were the
unknown accused, as nobody was examined by the defence to
have witnessed the quarrel, resulting into death of the deceased.
This is the prosecution case that while sitting in the courtyard
of the house the incident occurred and that father of Aitbar Din
was also present and witnessed the occurrence. This is on
record that at the time of report in the Police Station,
Aitbar Din was also present and so at the time when the

Investigating Officer visited the spot. In case titled “Aurangzeb

Vs. The State (2020 SCMR 612), it is held that:-

“The incident was reported with a
remarkable promptitude, followed by post
mortem examination that cannot be viewed
as delayed, factors excluding possibility of
deliberations and consultations, in
retrospect suggestive of witnesses’ presence
at the stated point of time, coinciding with
the durations mentioned in the autopsy
report. Though inconsequential for want of
forensic verification, nonetheless, _ the
weapon recovered on petitioner's disclosure
is consistent with the nature of fatal injury.
Occurrence being a broad daylight affair
before a large gathering, does not admit
hypothesis of substitution. Appraisal of
evidence carried out by both the Courts
below, on our own independent analysis, is
found by us in accord with the principles of
safe administration of criminal justice and
as such does not call for interference”.

8. The prosecution in support of its claim apart from
other witnesses, produced and examined the complainant as
PW-14, where the eyewitness Humar Badshah was examined
as PW-13, who stated that both the deceased and father of the
appellant were enjoying cordial relations since long and were
on constant visiting terms and that on the day of incident all the
three went to the house of the appellant to purchase woods, as
his father Aitbar Din was running the business. This stance was
not rebutted by the defence. The witness remained consistent
regarding their leaving for the spot village on motorcycle at
04:00 p.m, their reaching to the spot house and parking the
motorbike at a distance of 30 feet from the house. Both the
witnesses were put to the test of searching cross-examination,

but their testimony could not be shattered, they remained
8

consistent regarding the approach of the appellant and his
calling the deceased. The complainant stated that after
receiving fire shots, the deceased fell on the cot he was sitting
and thereafter, was shifted to another cot with the help of the
co-villagers, this fact was confirmed by PW-13, who witnessed

the incident. In case titled “Akhtar Ali Vs. The State and

another” (P.Cr.L.J. Peshawar Note 3), it was held that:-

“Both the eye-witnesses through their
trustworthy and confidence inspiring
testimony corroborated by medical and
circumstantial evidence have successfully
proved their presence on the spot with the
deceased at the time of incident. They have
not exaggerated the charge and have
furnished the true account of the incident. It
was much easier for them to charge the
appellant for attempting at their lives too,
but they did not, which shows their honesty
and truthfulness, as in routine, we have
observed that in such like incident the
witnesses try their level best to implicate the
accused under so many offences, possible
for them. There seems no material
contradiction in the statements of the eye-
witness which may negate the basic fabric of
the prosecution story. There may be some
minor discrepancies in their statements but
such like discrepancies are inbuilt proof of
truthfulness of the PWs that they have come
forward with natural account of the events,
without being tutored or any fabrication. By
now the principle of falsus in uno falsus in
omnibus, has been done away with. Rather
the Courts while appreciating evidence,
apply the principle of sifting the grain from
the chaff. It is settled law, that those
contradictions in the prosecution evidence
are considered as fatal, which totally
negates the prosecution case. Mere minor
discrepancies, occurring in the statements of
9

the PWs, which are otherwise natural one
would not be considered as fatal. Moreover,
when the witnesses are subjected to lengthy
and searching cross-examination by a
skillful hand, such discrepancies do creep in
from the simple and rustic villagers, who are
never used to such tricky questions nor are
mindful about the nature and consequences
of answers thereof. The Courts are never
supposed to decide the matter in a
mechanical manner by taking such
discrepancies as a tool to dislodge a
genuine case. Rather, the Courts are
supposed to go in depth of the evidence and
assess it at the touch stone of natural course
of events and human conduct in normal
pursuit of the society by scrutinizing its
intrinsic worth and if comes to the
conclusion on their own assessment that
such an occurrence had in fact taken place,
it costs an obligation to redress the
grievance of aggrieved party. Although,
accused is considered as a beloved child of
the Court but at the same time the aggrieved
party is also not to be treated as an alien as,
it is he, who approaches the Court for
redressal of his grievance against
aggression of accused”.

9. True, that the incident occurred at 17:00 hours,
whereas the report was made at 18:55 hours, but this can never
be taken to hold that the report was made after preliminary
investigation or that the appellant was charged after
consultation and deliberation, as we cannot forget that the
incident occurred in a remote village with no cellular facilities
and absence of such facility excludes the possibility that
someone from the village might have informed the complainant.
The absence of cellular facility in the village was confirmed by
the witnesses who stated that after putting the dead-body in the
Datsun pickup for Police Station, when they reached Samandri,

they received signals and informed the relatives who reached to
10

the Police Station after the F.I1.R was registered, this fact was
also confirmed by the Investigating Officer. It was argued that
the complainant and the eyewitness failed to identify the
deceased at the time of preparation of the inquest report and
that in the relevant column of the postmortem report, instead of
individual identification the word “relatives” is written. The
learned counsel ignored that besides the complainant, 2/3
persons from the village including father of the appellant
accompanied the dead-body to the Police Station and these
were out of the 2/3 persons who identified the deceased before
the police at the time of preparation of the inquest report. The
defence further lost sight of that the complainant stated that
after the report was made, he, the eye-witness, Aitbar Din and
two others including Satar Badshah were to stay in the Police
Station and the relatives took the dead-body under the escort of
PW-6, to the doctor for postmortem examination. The plea of
the learned counsel regarding identification before the doctor
holds no ground, as these were the relatives who took the dead-
body from Police Station to the hospital and got it identified.
The delay is nothing but natural as the incident occurred in a
remote village. The witnesses remained consistent that the
relatives reached to the Police Station after the case was
registered and the way they reached to the Police Station and
afterwards to the spot. Humar Badshah, who was examined as
PW-13, stated that he, Nazirullah and Aitbar Din accompanied

police to the spot in their vehicle, whereas Nadeem, Satar
Il

Badshah came on motorbike, this was what supported by the
Investigating Officer. The main thrust of the argument was that
the witnesses were not present on the spot and that it was the
father of the appellant who informed them, but the consistent
relevance of events overshadowed what he submitted. The
issue before us, is to determine as to whether deceased lost his
life owing to a quarrel outside the house, as stated by the Aitbar
Din, who was examined as a defence witness, or inside the
house, as stated by the witnesses. The Investigating Officer
reached to the spot and on pointation of the witnesses the site-
plan was prepared. The Investigating Officer recovered six
empties of 7.62 bore from the spot alongwith two spent bullets
from the southern and also blood-stained earth from beneath
the charpoy, where the deceased received firearm injuries. The
collected empties alongwith the spent bullets were received to
the Forensic Science Laboratory on 18.4.2016, where these
were found to have been fired from one and the same weapon.
The laboratory report confirms the involvement of a single

accused and so is the claim of prosecution.

10. We are anxious to know that whether the relation
between the parties was so cordial that all the three were taken
inside, instead asking them to sit outside the house. Both the
complainant and eyewitness remained consistent that the

parties were enjoying warm relationship and that they were on
12

constant visiting terms to the houses of each other and even the
witnesses were not suggested otherwise. The claimed
relationship has never been questioned, which proves the fact
that the deceased and witnesses had no other purpose in the
village but to visit Aitbar Din, father of the appellant. Record
tells that on 15.4.2016, father of the appellant recorded his 164
Cr.P.C. statement, where on one hand, he admitted presence of
all the three in his house and on the other, he charged the
appellant for the murder of deceased. The matter does not end
here, rather a specific question was put to the accused
regarding the 164 Cr.P.C. statement recorded by his father, to
which he replied that the statement was the result of pressure
and physical torture. It was vehemently argued that 164 Cr.P.C.
statement has no evidentiary value, as on one hand, it was
recorded in absence of the accused and on the other hand, the
Magistrate who recorded the same has not been produced. True,
that the matter was not cross-examined and equally true that
the Judicial Magistrate who recorded the same has not been
produced, but we cannot ignore that the accused while
recording his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. did not deny

the document, but questioned the manner it was executed by
13
terming it to be the outcome of threat, pressure and coercion
and his this stance was reiterated by his father Aitbar Din, who
appeared as a defence witnesses to favour his son, so in such
eventuality, the statement is accepted to have been recorded,
but stress was on its voluntariness, when so, the non-
examination of the concerned Judicial Magistrate will not help
the prosecution. What is left for this Court, is to see, as to
whether this piece of evidence could wholly be relied against
the appellant to convict him, our answer is in negative, but we
cannot reject its status as a circumstantial evidence and it can
be read for limited purpose only i.e. the coming of deceased
and witnesses to the house on the day of incident and it tells
that they had come. The appellant produced witnesses in his
defence including Aitbar Din, who was examined as DW-2 and
Shahid Nawaz, as DW-1. DW Shahid Nawaz stated that he was
serving in Frontier Constabulary and during the days of
occurrence, he was on leave. He further stated that on receiving
information, he reached to the place of occurrence situated at a

distance of 700/800 feet from the house of the appellant.

11. After evaluating the evidence on file, this Court

has reached to an inescapable conclusion that the prosecution
14
has succeeded in bringing home charges against the appellant,
through confidence inspiring evidence and that the witnesses
remained consistent on material aspects of the case.
Furthermore, the medical evidence fully supports the ocular
account with no room for substitution, even otherwise in case
of a single accused substitution is a rare phenomenon. The
instant appeal alongwith revision petition, are bereft of merits

stand dismissed.
