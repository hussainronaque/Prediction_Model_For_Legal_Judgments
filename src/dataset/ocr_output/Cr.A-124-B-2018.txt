SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.--- This single judgment is
aimed to dispose of the instant Criminal Appeal as well as the
connected Criminal Revision No. 40-B/2018 (Muhammad
Arshad Vs the State etc), as both these have arisen out of one and

the same judgment.

2- Appellants Abdul Khaliq and Zar Bakht Ali, being
aggrieved by judgment dated 17.07.2018 of the learned

Additional Sessions Judge, Banda Daud Shah, District Karak in

*M.Azam/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
Sessions Case No. 83/7 of 2016, by which the appellants were
convicted U/S.302 (b) /34 PPC, and sentenced to imprisonment
for life alongwith fine of Rs.100,000/-(one Lac), each in default
six months SI, however, the accused was given benefit U/S. 382-
B Cr.P.C. Hence, have preferred this appeal against his
conviction and sentence, while the connected Criminal Revision
No.40-B/2018 was preferred by the complainant Muhammad

Rashid, for enhancement of sentence.

3- Brief facts given in the FIR are that on 19.04.2016 at
11.30 hours, Muhammad Arshad /complainant (PW-7) brought
the dead body of his deceased father Noor Sayed to the Civil
Hospital Banda Daud Shah, and reported the matter to the effect
that on the eventful day at 07.30 hours, his father Noor Sayed
was sitting on cot in front of shop of Rooz Wali and the
complainant was present in his own shop situated at the place of
occurrence, when the accused/ appellants came on motorcycle
duly armed with their respective weapons, the accused/ appellant
Zar Bakht Ali opened firing upon the deceased, as a result of

which he was hit and started running, who was chased and again

*M.Azam/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
fired by the accused / appellant Zar Bakht Ali as a result he fell
down on the ground and that the accused decamped from the spot.
Motive behind he occurrence, alleged by the complainant was
that some eight (8) years back, father of accused/ appellants was
killed, for which the deceased Noor Syed was charged. Report of

the complainant was reduced in shape of murasila Ex:PA.

4. Initially accused/ appellant Zar Bakht Ali was
arrested, while accused/ appellant Abdul Kahliq was absconding.
After completion of investigation, complete challan was
submitted against him before the learned trial Court. During the
course of trial accused/ appellant Abdul Khaliq was arrested,
whose supplementary challan was submitted. After complying
with the provision of section 265-C Cr.P.C, they were formally
charged, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The
prosecution in order to prove its case, produced and examined as
many as ten (10) PWs. On conclusion of trial, statements of
accused / appellants were recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C,
wherein they professed innocence. They neither wished to

produce defence evidence nor opted to be examined on oath as

*M.Azam/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
provided under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. Learned trial Court after
hearing arguments of learned counsel for the parties, vide
impugned judgment dated 17.08.2018 convicted and sentenced

the accused/ appellants.

5. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard

and record gone through with their valuable assistance.

6. This was on 19.04.2016, at 07.30 am. that the
deceased was sitting in a cot in front of the shop of one Rooz
Wali whereas the complainant shown himself in his shop situated
at the place of occurrence when the accused/ appellant with the
co-accused came to the place of occurrence riding on motorcycle
and started firing over the deceased, the deceased when received
the initial firing started running, who was chased by the accused/
appellant and just behind the shops at point No.B1, he received
fatal injuries and fell down on the ground and according to the
complainant, the accused/ appellants decamped from the spot.
The complainant while reporting the matter to the local police
presented Noor Shazada as the eye-witness who was examined as

PW-8, and this Noor Shahzada is the real brother of the deceased

*M.Azam/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
and uncle of the complainant. These two witnesses were
examined before the trial Court as PW-07 and PW-08
respectively, but both of them were in stark contrast with each
other, as one of the witness stated that soon after the occurrence
the women folk including the children from the house of the
deceased attracted to the spot, whereas the other stated that no
one else attracted to the spot and kept complete silence regarding
the attraction of the women and children from the house. Both
the witnesses made conscious attempts to make their availability
appealable and both of them pointed their houses to be situated in
the close proximity but one of the witness stated that the houses
were at a distance of 500 / 600 yards, whereas the other stated
that it was some 250/200 feet from the place of the occurrence.
The witnesses did not remain consistent on material aspects of
the case, and even they went pole apart in respect of the mode,
manner and the time of occurrence. PW-07, stated that the
accused / appellant Zar Bakht Ali on reaching near the deceased
resorted to indiscriminate firing upon the deceased, but he kept

mum regarding the activities of the co-accused whereas when

*M.Azam/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
PW-08 was examined he gave a strange reply by stating that the
co-accused i.e. Abdul Khaliq aimed his gun with a warning to us

for maintaining silence.

7. The intriguing aspect of the case is that the incident
occurred at 07.30 a.m. whereas the report was made to the local
police in civil hospital Banda Daud Shah, at 11.30 a.m i.e. with
an abnormal delay of four hours and the prosecution miserably
failed to explain the delay. We are surprised that the distance
between the spot and Civil Hospital B.D.Shah is not more then
8/9 K.Ms and a metal road is available then why the eye-
witnesses could not reach with the dead body to the hospital in
time and why PW-08 statedly deboarded the Datsun pickup
which was proceeding to the hospital with the dead body therein.
The prosecution with time went on with constant improvements
and both the witnesses never ever remained consistent and stuck
to the previous stance. The malafide is evident from record that
the scribe who was examined as PW-03, when appeared as a
witness before the trial Court, he stated that it was 08.00 a.m that

he received information regarding the incident from Moharrir of

*M.Azam/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
the Police Station and he reached to the hospital at 09.30 am
where the dead body of the deceased was brought by the co-
villagers and he prepared the injury sheet, inquest report and
other formalities, but kept waiting for report when at 11.30 am
the complainant reached to the hospital and reported the matter to
him, his this statement leaves no room to hold that in fact the
incident was unwitnessed and later on people of the locality
brought the dead body to the hospital and thereafter an attempt
was made to contact the legal heirs of the deceased and were
procured and after consultation and deliberation the accused /
appellants were charged keeping in mind the blood feud as earlier
father of the appellant was murdered for which the deceased was
charged. The presence of the witnesses at the place of occurrence
went unestablished as the shops they claimed at the place of
occurrence were neither pointed out nor shown in the site-plan,
when it was prepared on pointation of the prosecution witnesses.
The shop in front of which the deceased was sitting in the
charpai was statedly belonging to one Rooz Wali, but even he

was not examined by the investigating officer, to confirm the

*M.Azam/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
factum of the incident. There are dents and dents in the
prosecution case and a conscious attempt was made by the
prosecution witnesses to make believe their presence on the spot
but we are mindful that neither they were present on the spot nor
the dead body was collected and brought to the hospital by them,
when such is the state of affairs we cannot hold otherwise, but
that the witnesses are chance and interested witnesses with the
sole purpose to implicate the appellants for a blind murder. In
case titled “Gulfam_and another Vs the State” (2017 SCMR

1189), wherein it is held that:

“The prosecution had relied upon two eye-

witnesses, ie. Muhammad Rafiq
complainant (PW-17) and Muhammad
Ishaq (PWI13) out of whom the
complainant was a brother of Muhammad
Hanif deceased and Faheem Abbas
deceased was an uncle of the complainant.
The said eye-witnesses lived at some
distance from the place of occurrence and
they had claimed that at the relevant time
they were available near a Dahi Bhalay
cart on a roadside. Availability of the said
eye-witnesses on a roadside near a cart at

about midnight and doing nothing and for

*M.Azam/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
no purpose was a circumstance which was
sufficient to raise many an eyebrow. The
said eye-witnesses were, thus, nothing but
chance witnesses who had failed to
establish any reason for their availability
near the place of occurrence at the relevant

time.”

8. The investigating officer allegedly recovered
empties from the spot alongwith blood stained pebbles and
prepared the site-plan on the pointation of the witnesses. The
distance between the assailant Zar Bakht Ali has been shown as
10 paces from the cot where the deceased was initially sitting and
10 to 12 paces when the deceased after running received second
round of firing, when these injuries are looked into two of the
injuries were having blackening and this factor further negates
the stance of the witnesses in respect of the distances mentioned
therein. The investigating officer sent the collected empties
alongwith blood stained pebbles to the office of the chemical
examiner with request to determine as to whether the empties
were fired from one or different weapons. The Forensic Sciences
Laboratory report was received and placed on file where the

expert had opined that the empties were fired from different

*M.Azam/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
10

weapons, if the stance of the complainant is read together with
the opinion so tendered by the expert then the testimony of
complainant is losing ground as the witnesses attributed the
effective role of firing on the deceased to the accused Zar Bakht
Ali. The prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case to the
hilt and when the witnesses are termed as interested and chance
then the courts are having a heavy responsibility on its shoulders
to walk with care and caution lest an innocent person should be

convicted.

9. The Doctor conducted post mortem examination of
the deceased and he was cross-examined on different aspects of
the injuries. But one thing is astonishing that if the complainant
was correct in giving the inter-se distances between the assailant
and the deceased at two different points then the blackening on or
around the injuries was not possible because in case of
Kalashnikov the maximum range where blackening can be
caused is not more than three (3) feet, so the veracity of the
witnesses goes down and we do not find ourselves in agreement

with what the prosecution has brought forward. In case titled,

*M.Azam/P.S* (D.B) Mr, Justice Ikramullah Khan and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
Il

“Barkat Ali Vs the State” (2007 SCMR 1812), wherein it is held

that:-

“It is an admitted fact that eye-witnesses
had stated that the deceased was hit by the
respondents at about 30/35 feet whereas
according to the medical report, there was
burning and blackening as is evident from
the statement of P.W.2, therefore, ocular
account furnished by the two eye-witnesses
is not in consonance with the medical
evidence which clearly contradicts the
statement of the eye-witnesses. It is a settled
law that blackening appears on the dead
body in case the deceased has received
injuries at a distance of 4 feet according to

medical jurisprudence by Modi.”

10. Though the learned counsel representing the
complainant stressed that the accused/ appellants soon after the
occurrence absconded and to him the abscondence alone is a
sufficient pointer towards guilt of the accused, we are unable to
understand that how in absence of positive and convincing
evidence the abscondence alone can lead to conviction and if we
accede to the submissions so forwarded, we are afraid the results

would be drastic. There is no cavil to the preposition that

*M.Azam/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
12

abscondence alone cannot be a substitute, for the direct evidence
and this aspect has been beautifully dealt with by the apex Court
in case titled, “Muhammad Sadiq Vs the State” (2017 SCMR

144), wherein it is held that:

“. The fact that the appellant absconded
and was not traceable for considerably
long period of time could also not be made
sole basis for his conviction when the other
evidence of the prosecution is doubtful as it

is riddled with contradictions.”

11. The prosecution has forwarded a motive that the
father of the accused / appellant was murdered for which the
deceased was charged and to them it was the revenge which
brought the appellant / accused to commit the murder of the
deceased but the motive is a double edged weapon which cuts

both ways and this view was consistently held by Hon’ble
Supreme Court, in case titled “Muhammad Ashraf alias acchu
Vs the State” (2019 SCMR 652), wherein it is held that:

“The motive is always a double-edged
weapon. The complainant Sultan Ahmad
(PW9) has admitted murder enmity

between the parties and has also given

*M.Azam/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
13

details of the same in his statement
recorded before the trial court. No doubt,
previous enmity can be a reason for the
appellant to commit the alleged crime, but
it can equally be a reason for the
complainant side to falsely implicate the
appellant in this case for previous grouse.”
12. Be that as it may, the prosecution failed to convince

this court that it was non-else but accused who killed the

deceased.

13. After thoroughly evaluating the evidence available
on file this court reaches to an inescapable conclusion that the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case against
accused/appellants. Resultantly, this appeal is, therefore, allowed,
the conviction and sentence of the appellants recorded by the
learned trial court is set-aside and they are acquitted of the charge
by extending them the benefit of doubt, they shall be released
forth with from jail, if not required to be detained in connection
with any other case. So far as the connected Criminal Revision

No.40-B/2018 is concerned, the same stands dismissed.
