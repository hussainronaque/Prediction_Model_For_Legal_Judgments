LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- Through

this judgment, we shall also decide
Cr.A.No.292-P of 2016 and Cr.R.No.
71-P of 2016 as all the three matters
have emanated from same judgment
dated 11.04.2016 of the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-V, Nowshera
delivered in case FIR  No.353
dated 18.09.2006 u/ss 302/324/337-

U/s 337-D PPC —_ Sentenced to 10

2. All the sentences were ordered to

Cr.P.C. It was also ordered by the
learned trial court that on realization of
the fine, as a recovery of land revenue,
same shall be paid to the legal heirs of

the deceased.

3. Both the appellants-convicts have
impugned’ their convictions and
sentences through their separate
appeals while the complainant has filed

criminal revision for enhancement of the

Sadig Shah PS
sentence, awarded to the appellants,
from imprisonment of life to the normal
penalty of death. As all the three matters
have arisen from same_ judgment,
therefore, are being decided through this

single judgment.

4. Brief facts of the case are that on
18.09.2006, Muhammad Musa, son of
deceased Khawaja Muhammad Khan
(PW-8) reported to Nawar Khan Sl
(PW-16) in the casualty ward of District
Headquarter Hospital, Nowshera to the
effect that on 18.09.2006 he and his
father Khawaja Muhammad Khan
(deceased) alongwith Akhtar Zeb alias
Khkuley Khan (deceased), Zafar Iqbal
(deceased), Muhammad Shafi (injured),
Iqbal Hussain and Mir Afzal (both
abandoned PWs) had come _ to
Nowshera for their some domestic
matter. According to the FIR, deceased
Khawaja Muhammad Khan, Akhtar Zeb,
Zafar Iqbal and Muhammad Shafi were

proceeding in motor car No.0910/LZG

Sadig Shah PS
while complainant and the abandoned
PWs were following them in a taxi. As
per the contents of FIR, after finishing
work at Nowshera, they left for their
village at Mardan in their vehicles and
when they reached at Rashakai
Interchange, there an Alto car and a
corolla car 1988 model overtook them.
According to the report, in the Alto car
appellant Amjid Ali son of Roshan Din
and Inayat-ur-Rehman son of Ahmad
Ashiq were present with weapons
alongwith unknown driver while Zar
Alam and Shams Alam alongwith
unknown driver were present in the
corolla motor car, who too were armed
with weapons. It is prosecution case that
on reaching Rashakai Interchange the
appellants and acquitted accused,
namely, Zar Alam opened firing at the
car, wherein, Khawaja Muhammad
Khan, Akhtar Zeb, Zafar Iqbal and
Muhammad Shafi were proceeding, who
were hit with the fire shots and

resultantly Khawaja Muhammad Khan,

Sadig Shah PS
Akhtar Zeb and Zafar Iqbal died while

Muhammad Shafi was critically injured.

5. After arrest of the accused and
conclusion of investigation, the case was
put in court, which indicted the accused
for commission of the offence to which

they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

6. Prosecution in order to prove its
case against the accused, produced and
examined 17 witnesses in all, whereafter
statements of the accused u/s 342
Cr.P.C. were recorded, wherein, they
professed innocence. The learned trial
court, after conclusion of the trial vide
judgment impugned herein, found the
appellants-accused guilty of the charge
and while recording their convictions
sentenced them as mentioned in para

No.1 of this judgment.

7. It is worth to mention that earlier
both the appellants were put to face the
trial and the learned trial court vide

judgment dated 20.11.2012 had

Sadig Shah PS
convicted them for imprisonment of life
whereagainst they had preferred appeal,
which was allowed by this court on
20.10.2015 and after setting aside their
conviction and sentence the case was
remanded to the learned trial court for
denovo trial as there was legal defect in
the formal charge. It is further worth to
mention that on the basis of compromise
co-accused Zar Alam has_ been
acquitted by the learned trial court on

04.01.2014.

8. Learned counsel for the appellants
argued that complainant of the case,
namely, Muhammad Musa (PW-8) was
not present on the spot at all and that his
presence was procured after the
occurrence just to strengthen’ the
prosecution case. It was argued that
though PW-9 bears the stamp of injury
on his person but mere stamp of injury
on the body of his person would not be
sufficient to hold that whatever he has

testified was accurate and correct to the

Sadig Shah PS
hilt qua involvement of the appellants in
the case. Learned counsel for the
appellants further argued that it was not
possible for the prosecution witnesses to
identify the appellants in the given
circumstances of the case as_ the
eyewitnesses at the relevant time were
proceeding in their cars on Highway. It
was also contended by learned counsel
for the appellants that there is no report
of FSL to show that the recovered
empties were fired from one or more

than one weapons of offence.

9. As against the above, learned
counsel for the complainant argued that
participation of the appellants in the
crime has been established through
worth reliable evidence, which has been
furnished by one injured witness and
also by son of deceased Khawaja
Muhammad Khan, who was present on
the spot when the occurrence had taken
place. He further argued that the

prosecution has successfully proved its

Sadig Shah PS
case against the appellants through
ocular and_ circumstantial evidence.
Learned counsel also argued that for no
valid reasons and justification sentence
of imprisonment for life has been given
to the appellants by the learned trial
court, which according to the learned

counsel, needs enhancement to death.

10. Learned AAG appearing for the
State adopted the arguments advanced

by learned counsel for the complainant.

11. We have heard learned counsel
for the parties and gone through the

case record.

12. Perusal of the case record would
show that in the case there are two
eyewitnesses, out of whom, one is
Muhammad Musa (PW-8), who is son of
deceased Khawaja Muhammad Khan
while the other is Muhammad Shafi
(PW-9). First of all we would take the
testimony of PW-8 for its appreciation.

As this witness is related to one of the

Sadig Shah PS
deceased, therefore, his testimony
needs cautious scrutiny and analysis.
Though testimony of a related witness
cannot be discarded on the mere ground
of his being related to a victim but at the
same time it has been held time and
again by the superior courts that
evidence of a related witness is
acceptable only if same is corroborated
by circumstantial aspects of the case
such as medical evidence of the victim,
reason of his presence on the spot,
recovery of incriminating materials from
the spot and the conduct shown by him
at the time of occurrence. On the
touchstone of the above, when we see
the testimony furnished by PW-8, we will
draw a conclusion that he was not
present on the spot at the time when the
occurrence had taken place. We have
drawn our above conclusion as the
witness has not given any explanation
for his being in the company of his father
when the deceased and other victims of

the case had left for Nowshera. He has

Sadig Shah PS
10

also not given the nature of work for
which he and his father had been to
Nowshera. In cross examination he has
admitted that his father used to visit
Nowshera off and on and that he did not
accompany him when he would visit
Nowshera. This disclosure shows that
normally his father used to go out of
Mardan without his son but on the day of
occurrence complainant joined him,
which association of the witness is open
to serious doubt. Furthermore, the
complainant did not take the
Investigating Officer to the place where
he and his father had gone to Nowshera
nor he produced someone _ from
Nowshera to tell the Investigating Officer
about presence of the complainant at
Nowshera. Bringing above facts on
record were necessary so as to give
corroboration to the testimony furnished
by PW-8 i.e. the complainant regarding
his company alongwith his father and

other victims of the occurrence.

Sadig Shah PS
11

13. Not only’ the above © but
circumstantial aspects of the case too
do not support what the complainant has
deposed. There is no report of FSL,
which could show that the firing was
made from more than one weapon of
offence. Report of FSL to the ibid effect
was material as firing has been
attributed to more than one person.
Moreover, complainant has admitted in
his cross examination that his clothes
were not smeared with blood and that
only his hands were tainted with blood
but before lodging his report, he had
washed his hands. Ibid aspect of the
case shows nothing but absence of the
complainant at the time when the
occurrence had taken place. Had he
been present on the spot at the time of
occurrence, he would have taken the
victims out of car and in that process his
clothes and hands must have been
bloodstained, which is quite natural.
Explanation furnished by the witness

that he had washed his hands prior to

Sadig Shah PS
12

lodging the report too does not fit sound
in the circumstances of the case as a
prudent man would not prefer to go toa
wash room for washing his hands
leaving his deceased father and other
victims alone. Absence of blood on his
clothes and hands would show that at
the time of occurrence he was not
present on the spot. Moreover, distance
between the car in which the
complainant was proceeding and the
one from which firing was made by the
appellants, as per site plan, is 32 paces.
It is in the complainant's statement that
at the time of firing both the vehicles
were moving. In such a situation, it was
not possible for the complainant to
identify the appellants as not only both
the parties were present inside the cars
but the firing had taken place all of a
sudden. In normal course, when some
body is traveling in a vehicle and all of a
sudden firing takes places from another
car at a distance of 32 paces, it would

not be possible to identify the assailant.

Sadig Shah PS
13

For the above reasons, we have
reached to a conclusion that the
complainant (PW-8) was not present
on the spot when the occurrence had
taken place and for safe administration
of justice, we exclude his evidence from

consideration.

14. After discarding the testimony of
PW-8, prosecution is now left with the
evidence of PW-9. No doubt, this
witness bears the stamp of injury on his
person and generally an injured witness
is deemed to be present at the time of
occurrence. There is no cavil to the
above but it has also been held
umpteenth times by the superior courts
that mere having a stamp of injury on the
body of a person would not mean that
whatever he has said is nothing but a
whole truth. Acceptance of testimony
furnished by an injured witness qua all
aspects of the matter is subject to
corroboration. If circumstantial aspect of

a case does not support the ocular

Sadig Shah PS
14

account furnished by an injured witness,
then his evidence cannot be taken into
account despite the fact that he has

suffered injuries on his person.

15. On the touchstone of the above
criteria, when evidence furnished by
PW-9 is appreciated, it would appear
that his evidence does not get
corroboration from prevailing
circumstances of the case. It is in the
statement of PW-9 that the Suzuki Alto
car, in which the appellants were
proceeding, was behind their car,
wherefrom the appellants opened firing
at them. It is also in his evidence that
after getting injury, he went unconscious.
Question arises that how PW-9 was in a
position to identify that the assailants
were the appellants. It is not in his
evidence that prior to the firing, the car
wherein the appellants were seated, had
come very close to his car and that he
had properly identified the assailants. In

the ordinary course of nature, a person

Sadig Shah PS
15

seated in a car running even at a normal
speed would not be in a position to
identify a person proceeding in another
car unless something extraordinary
happens, which could attract the
persons traveling in different cars to look
at each other, which is not the case of
PW-9. As stated earlier, it is also on
record that just after receiving his injury,
PW-9 had become _— unconscious,
therefore, it cannot be said that he had
the time to identify the appellants just
after the firing opened by them. For the
above reasons, it can be concluded that
PW-9 had no chance to identify the
appellants before or after the incident,
therefore, for the safe administration of
justice, his evidence too is kept out of
consideration, albeit he has suffered
injury on his person. Wisdom is drawn

from 2011 SCMR 323.

16. True that the appellants had
remained fugitive from law and the

complainant has given motive for the

Sadig Shah PS
16

occurrence but it is well settled that
neither abscondence alone is sufficient
to record conviction of an accused nor
motive per se can be a ground to convict
an accused as above aspects of a
criminal case are only corroboratory
pieces of evidence, which cannot

substitute for ocular evidence.

17. It is cardinal principle of criminal
law that in order to bring home guilt to an
accused, the prosecution must prove its
case through worth reliable and
confidence inspiring evidence and
beyond reasonable doubt, which is not
the case in hand. The learned trial court
has not appreciated the case evidence
in its true perspective and committed
illegality to record conviction of the

appellants.

18. For what has been discussed
above, we are of the considered view
that the prosecution has not proved its
case against the appellants beyond any

shadow of doubt, benefit of which must

Sadig Shah PS
17

go to them being a century old principle
of criminal law, therefore, we allow both
the appeals, set aside the convictions
and sentences of the appellants and
acquit them of the charges leveled
against them. They be set free forthwith,

if not required in any other case.

19. As we have accepted appeals of
the appellants, therefore, the connected
criminal revision bearing No.71-P_ of
2016 has become infructuous and is
dismissed as such.

20. Above are reasons for our short

order of even date.
