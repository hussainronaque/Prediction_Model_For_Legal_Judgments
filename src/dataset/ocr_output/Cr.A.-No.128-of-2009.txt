JUDGMENT SHEET

Cr.A. No.128-A of 2009

Date of hearing: 05/11/2015
Petitioner Tahir Khan
Respondents The State

LAL JAN KHATTAK, J. This criminal appeal is
directed against the judgment dated 02.11.2009 of the
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Ghazi, District
Haripur, delivered in case FIR No.218 dated 17.08.2007
under Sections 302/324/201/34 PPC of Police Station
Ghazi, whereby appellant Tahir Khan has been convicted
for the qgatl-e-amd of Mst. Fouzia wife of complainant
Zahoor Khan and sentenced to suffer imprisonment of life
with direction to pay an amount of Rs.1,00,000/- as
compensation to the legal heirs of the deceased or in
default to further undergo simple imprisonment of six
months. Benefit under Section 382-B, Cr.P.C., however,
has been extended to him. It is worth to mention here that
through same judgment co-accused Mst. Zeenat and
Mst.Rozina were acquitted by the learned trial Court. It is

further noteworthy that appellant was acquitted by the
learned trial Court of the charge of attempting at the life of
the complainant. Being aggrieved, the appellant has
impugned his conviction and sentences through the instant

appeal.

2- Brief facts of the case are that on
17.08.2007, complainant Zahoor Khan (PW-5) reported to
Ishtiaq Khan, SHO PS Ghazi (PW-3) in the emergency
room of Civil Hospital, Ghazi, to the effect that on the day
of occurrence at about 08.00 a.m., his brother Tahir Khan,
the appellant, told him to take the pups out of house, on
which he replied that they are too little, whereupon he hit
him with a brick on his head and further inflicted him fist
and kicks blows but their step brother Hasrat Iqbal
intervened and rescued him. It was _ further the
complainantâ€™s case that thereafter the appellant brought a
pistol from his house with which he fired at him but the
fire shot hit his wife Mst. Fauzia, who later on succumbed

to her injury in the hospital.

3- After arrest of the accused and completion
of the usual investigation, case was put in Court, which
indicted the appellant on 0512.2008 alongwith his
co-accused. All of them pleaded not guilty and claimed
trial. Prosecution in order to prove its charge examined
eight witnesses whereafter statements of the accused

under Section 342 Cr.P.C. were recorded wherein they
professed innocence. After conclusion of the trial, the
learned trial Court on 02.11.2009 acquitted the co-accused
but found the appellant guilty of the charge and on
conviction sentenced him, as mentioned above.

4- It is worth to mention that notices were
issued to the complainant of the case and father of the
deceased, namely, Abdul Qayyum. The complainant did
not appear before the court despite his service while father
of the deceased argued his case in person.

5- Arguments heard and record gone through.
6- Learned counsel for the appellant
contended that case of the prosecution against the
appellant is absolutely of no evidence; that even the
testimony of hostile witness gets no corroboration from
attending circumstances of the case; that the recovery of
pistol is of no legal worth, as same has been planted to
give strength to the prosecution case; that medical
evidence of the case negates the prosecution version and
that the site plan of the case too contradicts the
prosecution story.

7- As against the above, learned State counsel
supported the judgment of conviction on the grounds
stated therein while father of the deceased also supported
the impugned judgment of conviction.

8- In order to prove and substantiate its case

against the appellant, prosecution has placed reliance on
the testimony of complainant Muhammad Zahoor Khan
(PW-5), who has been declared hostile, recovery of crime
pistol with crime empty of .30 bore (Ex.PW4/6), report of
FSL (Ex.PW4/9), medical examination of the deceased
(Ex.PM) and site plan (Ex.PB).

9- It is worth to mention that when
complainant Muhammad Zahoor Khan, who was the only
eyewitness of the occurrence, did not depose in line with
his report (Ex.PA) he was declared hostile by the learned
trial Court on 27.08.2009 and prosecution was allowed to
cross-examine him. No doubt, a witness, who has been
declared hostile would not become unreliable and his
testimony cannot be rushed aside provided same is found
credible one but since a hostile witness speaks in different
voices, therefore, his deposition has to be evaluated with
great care and caution and utmost attempt be made to get
independent corroboration thereof from surrounding
circumstances of the case in order to base conviction of
the accused. In the case in hand necessary corroboration to
the evidence of the hostile witness is lacking very much.
Admittedly, no blood has been recovered from the scene
though mother and wife of the appellant namely Mst.
Zeenat and Mst. Rozina were charged for causing
disappearance of such evidence by wiping the blood from
the crime scene but as they have been acquitted of the

charge and there is no appeal against their acquittal,
therefore, the first corroboratory evidence i.e. the site plan
does not support and corroborate the evidence of the
complainant. Secondly, it is in the FIR, that the
complainant was also hit by the appellant with a brick on
his head but on record there is no evidence which could
show any injury on the person of the complainant despite
the fact that the learned trial Court had afforded an
opportunity to the prosecution to locate injury sheet of the
complainant but in spite of that nothing was produced
before the Court to the above effect.

10- Medical evidence of the deceased too does
not corroborate the evidence of the hostile witness.
According to the FIR the appellant had allegedly fired,
which had hit the deceased on left side of her belly but
according to the evidence of Dr.Fauzia Yasmeen (PW1),
the deceased had an entry wound on her right shoulder
just one inch behind the tip of shoulder joint with an exit
wound. The medical evidence has negated the prosecution
case. Prosecution has sought corroboration from the
recovery of crime pistol and the empty shell fired from it
but such recoveries hardly advance its case as not only the
pistol was recovered from a joint kitchen but the
independent marginal witness to the said recovery namely
Hashmat Khan was abandoned for his being unnecessary.
Furthermore, the place wherefrom the alleged crime pistol

was recovered is doubtful as in the site plan of the main
case under Section 302 PPC (Ex.PB), the kitchen has been
shown situated towards the eastern side of the house
where the occurrence had taken place whereas in the site
plan prepared pursuant to the ibid recovery, i.e. site plan
of the case under Section 13 of the Arms Ordinance, the
said kitchen has been shown situated towards western side
of the house, so the recoveries of pistol and the crime
empty are of no help to the prosecution.

11- In addition, PW-3 Ishtiaq Khan has
admitted in his cross-examination that the case murasila
was not scribed by him rather same was dictated by him to
ASI Shabir Shah (PW-4) but witness Shabir Shah has
deposed nowhere that he had drafted the murasila
pursuant to the dictation of SHO, Ishtiaq Khan. When
lodger of a report denies his making the report or resiles
therefrom then it becomes the boundened duty of the
prosecution to produce scribe of such report which has not
been done in the case in hand by the prosecution.

12- Above resume of the prosecution evidence
nowhere corroborates the version given by the hostile
witness. Of course, evidence of a hostile witness remains
admissible and conviction can be based on such testimony
but for the safe administration of criminal justice in such a
case adequate and necessary corroboration is need of the
hour sans which no conviction can be recorded on an

accused.
13- Over all aspect of the case is that the
prosecution has not proved its case against the appellant
through any reliable and convincing evidence and has
failed to bring the guilt home to him beyond any shadow
of doubt, which is the hallmark of a criminal case. It is the
cardinal principle of criminal law that one slightest doubt
is sufficient to acquit the accused because to free someone
criminal mistakenly is better than to punish someone
innocent mistakenly.

14- For what has been discussed above, in our
considered opinion, the prosecution has failed in proving
its case against the appellant, therefore, we accept this
appeal, set aside the impugned judgment of conviction and
sentence and acquit him of the charge. He is on bail and

his sureties are discharged from their liabilities.
