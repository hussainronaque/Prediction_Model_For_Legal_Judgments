(Judicial Department)

Cr. Misc | BA) No. 1413-P/2017-
Date of hearing:..------- 26.7.2017
Petitioner (Jalal Shah) by Mr. Astaghfirullah, Advocate.

The respondent-State by Mian Arshad Jan, AAG, and Syed

Azmat Ali, Advocate, for complainant.

ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.-_ On his failure to obtain bail
from the court below, Jalal Shah, the petitioner, who is
accused in case FIR No. 198 dated 10.7.2010 Under sections
302/324/34 PpPc/si2 Cr.P.C of Police Station, Nizam Pur,
has come to this Court for his release On bail on statutory

delay.

2. The precise allegations against the petitioner is
that he alongwith his co-accused Didar Shah (since dead) on
10.7.2010 at about 10.00 hours at Khawar Mohallah
Kandarkhel near the house of Sabir Shah, situated in village
Amiro Kalay, in furtherance of their common intention,
committed the murder of Nadeem Akbar and causing injury
to Noyat Akbar by firing at them besides ineffective firing at
Niaz Akbar, complainant.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

the petitioner was arrested in the case on 20.4.2015 and since

then he is in continuous custody but his trial has not yet been

concluded due to constant absence of the prosecution

witnesses as they are intentionally avoiding to attend the

Court for recording their evidence with a view to prolong the

period of confinement of the petitioner as under trial

prisoner. He next submitted that delay has not been
occasioned on the part of petitioner or any person ‘acting on

his behalf. He further submitted that since the petitioner is

behind the bars for the last more than two years, therefore, he

is entitled to be released on bail on statutory ground.

4, Learned AAG appearing on behalf of the State

and counsel for the complainant opposed the grant of bail by

submitting that the application of the petitioner is pre-mature

as his continuous confinement in the case for two years is not
complete. They next submitted that the 3 Proviso of Section

497(1) Cr.P.C is not strictly attracted to the present case
because the petitioner is hardened, desperate and dangerous
criminal as he has not only committed the brutal murder of
innocent person in the present case but he is also involved in
two other criminal cases registered against him under section
353/186/324 and 302 PPC by firing at the complainant as
well as police party at the time of his arrest in the present

case, therefore, he, at this stage, is not entitled to the

concession of bail on statutory ground.

5. I have considered the submissions of learned
counsel for the petitioner, learned AAG representing the
State and gone through the record of the case with their

valuable assistance.

6. Undisputedly, speedy and fair trial is the
fundamental right of every accused person. The policy of
criminal law is to bring accused person to justice as speedily
as possible so that if he is found guilty he may be punished
and if he is found innocent he may be acquitted and
discharged. Before the insertion of Article 10-A in the
Constitution, all the rights regarding expeditious and fair trial
were already available inthe Constitution and Criminal
Procedure Code etc. The guiding principle for the grant of
bail on the ground of inordinate delay was laid down by
Hon’able the apex Court in the case of Riasat Ali_v.

Ghulam Muhammad and the State (PLD 1968 SC 353),

wherein it has been held that:-

“Delay in prosecution of accused amounts to abuse
of process of law and is a valid ground for bailing
out accused, however, delay in prosecution of each —
case as a ground for bail is to be weighed and

judged, in each case on its merits.”
7. The third proviso to section 497 (1) of the
Cr.P.C was, later on, introduced through Ordinance No.
LXXI of 1979, which reads as under:-

“Section 497.—-(1) WHEN... .ceccccacscsseesssccsssccevsssseseesnacecs

PHOVIAEA....sosecccccesesseeecccnsscenecseaasesecctaneescccusecseas sos

PHOVECEd .. cc evvesscccccsseceeecccsnanscsceeauecessavsescssueecees

Provided further that the Court shall, except where it is of
the opinion of the court that the delay in the trial of the
accused has been occasioned by an act or omission of the
accused or any other person acting on his behalf, direct that
any person shall be released on bail.

(a) Who, being accused of any offence not punishable with
death, has been detained for such offence for a continuous
period exceeding one year or in case of a woman exceeding
six months and whose trial for such offence has not
concluded; or

(b) Who, being accused of an offence punishable with death has
been detained for such offence for a continuous period
exceeding two years and in case of a woman exceeding one
year and whose trial for such offence has not concluded.

Provided, further that the provisions of the
foregoing proviso shall not apply to a previously convicted
offender for an offence punishable with death or
imprisonment for life or to a person who, in the opinion of
the court, is a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal or
is accused of an act of terrorism punishable with death or

imprisonment for life.

The bare reading of above referred provisos would
make it-clear that it is a statutory right, which is earned by an
accused person for his post arrest bail where he has been
detained continuously exceeding two years for an offence

punishable with death or imprisonment for life and whose

trial for such an offence has not concluded, provided he, in
the opinion of the court, is not a hardened, desperate and
dangerous criminal or is an accused of an act of terrorism
punishable with death or imprisonment for life or previously
convicted person for an offence punishable with death. The
word “shall” means that where statutory period is complete,
the delay is not on the part of the accused and where his case
does not fall under any of the categories of the fourth
proviso, then the Court is left with no choice but to release
him on bail. Time and again, it has been held by the apex
Court that if a case on statutory delay in the conclusion of
trial is made out then, as a rule, bail should not be refused.
The object behind this view is that any accused person is
acquitted at the end of the trial then there is no compensation
for the wrong caused to him due to his long confinement in
prison while, on the other hand, in case if he is convicted
then he has to be rearrested and put behind the bars to serve
out his sentence and in that case no prejudice would be
caused to the prosecution/complainant. )
8. _ From the perusal of available record, it is
evident that petitioner was arrested in the present case on
20.4.2015 and his statutory period has been completed on
20.4.2017, but his trial has not been concluded so far,

therefore, under the law he is entitled to the concession of
pb neem!

bail. The perusal of all the order sheets of the trial Court
reveals that majority of the adjournments have been made
due to the absence of PWs and even the Presiding Officer of
the Court has not taken any coercive measure either against
process server/DFC concemed or the PWs, who deliberately
avoiding their attendance before the court for recording their
statements and there is nothing on the record which could
reflect that the delay occasioned in the trial is either on the
part of the accused-petitioner or any person ‘acting on his
behalf’. |
9. The arguments of learned counsel for the
complainant that the application for the grant of bail on
statutory ground is pre-mature as charge in the case has been
framed on 26.10.2015 is misconceived because the time of
detention of accused: person, who seeks bail on statutory
ground, is to be reckoned from the date of his arrest and not
from the commencement of trial. The submission of learned
AAG and counsel for the complainant that two other criminal
cases, i.e., FIR No. 66 and 33, have been registered against
the accused, where in the former he has been charged for
firing at the complainant party while in the latter for firing at
the police party at the time of his arrest, therefore, his case is
hit by the fourth proviso of Section 497 Cr.P.C, has also no

force because the three words, ‘hardened’,” desperate’ or
dangerous’ have different connotation and in the present case
the petitioner is charged for the killing and causing injury to
his opponent on the dispute over women folk and in my
humble understanding killing of a person over women folk
dispute by firing at him is not an act of desperate, hardened
or dangerous criminal. Rel: Moundar_and_ others _v. The
State (PLD 1990 SC 934). Even otherwise, the effect of the
aforesaid criminal cases registered against the petitioner is
not relevant for disposing of the instant petition. Reliance is
placed on the case “ Qurban_Ali_vs. The State (2017
SCMR 279). As far as abscondance of the petitioner in the
present case is concemed, the same pertains to merits of the
case and it does not come under the exceptional provisions of
the fourth proviso.
10. In view of the above legal and factual position,
the petitioner is entitled to the concession of bail as of right
on the basis of delay in the conclusion of his trial.
Accordingly, this petition is allowed and these are the
detailed reasons of short order of even date, which is as
follows:-
“por the reasons to be recorded later on, the
petition for the grant of bail is allowed and,
accordingly, the petitioner, Jalal Shah, involved in

case FIR No. 198 dated 10.7.2010 Under sections
302/324/34 PPC/S12 Cr.P.C of Police Station,
Nizam Pure, is admitted to bail on furnishing bail
bonds amounting to Rs. 5§,00,000/- with two
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction
of learned trial court, who shall ensure that the

sureties are local, reliable and men of means.”
