JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- Through instant
petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the Constitution), the
petitioner has prayed for quashing of FIR No. 83 dated
24.05.2023 u/s 322 PPC registered her at P.S Munda,
District Dir Lower.

2. Brief facts of the case are that Respondent No.2
Saeed-ul-Haq (complainant) brought his pregnant wife
Mst. Khadija Bibi on 29.10.2022 to Wahab Medical
Complex situated at Munda where the present
petitioner, being a lady doctor, advised her some
medicines informing her that the delivery was not
mature on the said date. The lady patient, per direction
of the petitioner, was again brought to said hospital on

31.10.2022 where she was admitted. Intravenous

cannulation (I.V cannula) line was inserted/passed,
however, after passing of a few drops, her condition
worsened. The patient accordingly informed sister of
the complainant, attending her at the relevant time,
regarding the adverse effect of the drip on her body
whereafter she was shifted by paramedical staff from
lower to upper floor of the hospital. After some time,
the complainant was informed that the patient had
died before the delivery with loss of her child as well.
The complainant reported the matter to local police
which was recorded vide DD No. 28 dated 15.11.2022.
After conducting inquiry in the matter under Section
156(3), crP.c during which exhumation of the dead
body was conducted and FSL report was received, the
referred to above FIR was registered against the
petitioner on the opinion given by the learned District
Public Prosecutor (DPP) wherein the petitioner was
charged for the offence of qatl-bis-sabab punishable
under Section 322 PPC on the ground that the lady had
died due to negligence of the petitioner. Being
aggrieved, she has filed instant petition for quashing of
the FIR.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended
that the FIR, being based on illegal opinion of the DPP,
was chalked out with mala fide for the purpose of the

petitioner’s implication in a false case. He further

np

Tpenatcs"| on: Hon'ble Mr, bustice Muhernmad Naeem Anwar
Henin Me pestice Shahid Khag

contended that the opinion of the learned DPP is not
backed by any juristic medical opinion nor the medical
and FSL reports constitute any offence, hence, there
was no legal authority for the action suggested by DPP
and officer incharge of the police station by way of
lodging of ibid FIR. That the petitioner is well-
experienced and qualified professional in her field while
the hospital ie. Wahab Medical Complex at Munda,
District Dir Lower, has earned a good name and
reputation in the area since years wherein best health
facilities are provided to public including Sehat Card.
He next argued that in view of the allegations leveled by
complainant with regard to medical negligence/
malpractice, the matter exclusively falls within the
jurisdiction of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Health Care
Commission (the Commission) established under
Section 3 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Health Care
Commission Act, 2015 which bars all other legal
proceedings against healthcare providers. The learned
counsel also submitted that it is a fundamental rule
that where a right is created by a statute which also
prescribes the manner in which that right may be
enforced, the party complaining of any infringement of
such right can only seek such remedy as provided by
that statute, therefore, the proceedings conducted

against the petitioner are against the Act which, being

Snnets*| De: Hon'ble Mr. hrstice Muhammed Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mo justice Shehid Kha

a special law, will prevail over the general law. He
requested for accepting the instant petition for
quashing of the FIR in question. He placed reliance on
“FLA through Director General, FIA and others Vs.
Syed Hamid Ali Shah and others” (PLD 2023 S.C 265),
“Muslimabad Cooperative Housing Society Ltd.
Through Secretary Vs. Mrs. Siddiqa Faiz and others”

4. The above contentions of learned counsel for

petitioner were opposed by learned counsel for
complainant by contending that a precious life was lost
due to negligence of the petitioner and the report of the
complainant constitutes a cognizable offence, as such,
the action taken against her was in accordance with
law. He further contended that the trial Court has
taken cognizance of the matter and alternate remedy by
making application under Section 249-A or 265-K,
Cr.P.C. is available to the accused petitioner, therefore,
her resort to Constitutional jurisdiction for quashing of
the FIR at this stage is not legally permissible. That the
question with regard to alleged innocence of the
petitioner would be decided by the trial Court after
recording of evidence and at this stage quashing of the
FIR would defeat the ends of justice. That it is settled
law that if, prima facie, an offence had been committed,
ordinary course of trial before the Court should not be
allowed to be deflected by resorting to constitutional
jurisdiction of High Court under Article 199 of the
Constitution. That such powers are to be exercised by

High Court in exceptional and rare cases and had to be

Biametts'| os: Hon'ble Mr, huaticr Muhammad Naeem Anwar

Hon'ble Mr tumtice Shahid Khen

done with circumspection so as not to affect due

process of law. The learned counsel added that it is
also well-settled that the inherent jurisdiction of the
High Court under Section 561-A, Cr.P.C. is neither
alternative nor additional in its character and is to be
rarely invoked only in the interest of justice so as to
seek redressal of grievances for which no other
procedure is available and that the provision should
not be used to obstruct or divert the ordinary course of
criminal procedure. He placed his reliance on “Haji
Sardar Khalid Saleem Vs. Muhammad Ashraf and
others” (2006 SCMR 1192), “Col. Shah Sadiq Vs.
Muhammad Ashiq and others” (2006 SCMR 276),
“Bashir Ahmad Vs. Zafar-ul-Islam” (PLD 2004 S.C

303), “Abdul Rehman Vs. Muhammad Hayat Khan

Baluchistan” {PLD 1971 S.C 677), “Dr. Manzoor

Peshawar), and “Ghulam Muhammad Vs. Muzammal
Khan and others” (PLD 1976 $.C 317). The learned

Assistant Advocate General representing the State ,
supported the arguments of learned counsel] for the»
complainant.

5. We have heard the arguments of learned counsel
for the parties including the learned Assistant A.G.
representing the State and perused the record available
on the instant petition in light of the case law produced
by both the sides in support of their respective
contentions.

Ss. The FIR was registered against the petitioner on
the basis of allegation that she, being a medical
practitioner in Wahab Medical Complex, negligently
and carelessly attended Mst. Khadija Bibi during her

delivery process as result whereof she died and

pnnetcs| os: Hon'ble Mr. hustice Muhammad Nagem Anwar
Hon'ble Mc Jitke Shebid Khon

consequently the baby she had conceived was also lost.
The petitioner was indicted under Section 322 of the
Pakistan Penal Code, however, the pivotal question for
resolution before this Court is to determine the legal
status of the FIR under the aforesaid offence when the
provincial Government has promulgated the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Healthcare Commission Act, 2015 (the
Act) with the aim to promote and improve patient safety
and health care service quality in public and private
sectors and to provide a mechanism for banning
quackery in all its forms with establishment of Health
Care Commission for regulating the health care
matters. Husband of the petitioner is running a private
hospital known as Wahab Medical Complex at Munda,
District Dir Lower which falls within the definition of
“healthcare establishment” under clause (i) of Section 2
of the Act. Thus, the Act is applicable to the matter in
hand in terms of Section 1(2) of the Act which reads:

1. Short title, application and commencement. -

(1) This Act may be called the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Health
Care Commission Act, 2015.

(2) It shall apply to all the health care establishments in
public and private sectors.

It is not disputed that the petitioner is
performing her duties as a lady doctor in the said
hospital under the license issued to her by Pakistan
Medical Commission, copy of which has been annexed

with the instant petition along with other medical

TFjametcs?) B: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justleg Shahid Kha

testimonials. Section 33 of the Act, being a special
enactment, gives it an overriding effect which is

replicated for ready perusal.

33. Overriding effect:-- Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in any other law, the
provisions of this Acct shall have an overriding effect
and the provisions of any such law to the extent of
inconsistency to this Act shall cease to have effect.

The above provision, especially in view of its
non-obstante clause, endorses its enforceability over
any provision in any other law for the time being in
force which is contradictory or repugnant to it. It is a
well celebrated rule that Special law always prevail over
the general law. In the present case, the complainant
has leveled the allegations of negligence against the
petitioner and a special law was available to deal with
the matter but he, without exhausting the remedy
under the Act; resorted to criminal proceedings which
cannot sustain in view of the bar contained in Section
19 of the Act according to which no suit, prosecution or
other legal proceedings related to provision of private
health care service shall lie against a health care
establishment except under the Act. It is well-settled
that when there was a conflict between a special law
and a general law, the former would prevail over the
latter. Wisdom is drawn from “Syed Mushahid Shah
and others Vs. Federal Investment Agency and
others” (2017 SCMR_1218).. Thus, keeping in view the

Sianats'| DB: Hon’bte Mr, Justice Muhammad ftmeem Ammar
Hon'ble Mr Justics Shahid Khon

-10-

aforesaid mode of the proceedings conducted on the
report of complainant, the same were illegal being
contrary to the provisions of the Act.

6. Complaints of the like nature are dealt with in

accordance with Section 13 of the Act, which needs

reproduction.

13. Complaints. (1) An aggrieved person may, within
sixty days from the date of knowledge of the cause of
action, file a complaint against a healthcare service
provider or healthcare establishment by submitting
an application in writing supported by an affidavit,
national identity card number and address of the
aggrieved person.

(2} The Commission shall not entertain an
anonymous or pseudonymous complaint against a
private health care service provider or healthcare
establishment.

(3) The Commission shall investigate in a
transparent manner, the complaints relating to
quality of health services, health services or system
and medical negligence.

(4) The Commission shall prescribe the procedure for
the conduct of investigation to be carried out by the
Commission under this Act.

The complainant in the present case, being an
agerieved person because of death of his wife due to
alleged negligence of the petitioner in her hospital, has
not made any complaint to Commission in the mode
and manner as prescribed under Section 13(1) of the
Act rather he reported the matter to local police on
which an inquiry was conducted and thereafter the FIR
in question was registered against her in total disregard
of the Act which was in the field at the relevant time
followed by - Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Health Care

Commission Conduct of Business Regulations, 2016

Tunutcs*| DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan

-ll-

(the Regulations) notified on 5 April, 2016 wherein the
entire procedure for filing of complaints has been given.
The matter in hand, pertaining to death of a lady at
delivery stage, falls in clause (a) of Section 5 of the
Regulations categorizing the act of medical negligence,
maladministration malpractice or any other act or
omission resulting in compromised healthcare service
on the basis of severity. Thus, complainant has not
agitated the matter before the proper forum and the
proceedings so conducted by police culminating into
registration of the FIR were against the relevant law. A
similar issue came before the Hon’ble Lahore High
Court, Multan Bench in the case of Dr. Malik
Muhammad Yaseen (2017 P Cr. L_ J _ 192) supra
wherein the petitioner called in question the order of
learned Justice of Peace on application of complainant
under Section 22-A, Cr.P.C. directing the police for |
proceeding with the matter in accordance with law. The
petition was accepted and order of the Justice of Peace
( was set aside in light of Sections 26 and 29 of the
Punjab Health Care Commission Act, 2010 reiterating

that no suit, prosecution or other legal proceedings

related to provision of healthcare services shall lie
against a health service provider except under the
mentioned Act. Reliance is also placed on another

judgment of the said Bench in Riaz Ahmad’s case

a

1
Tiomets*| De: Hon’ble Mr. tustice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
ee shehid Kron

supra (2022 P Cr. L J 1067. No doubt, according to

Clause (a) of Section 5(2) of the Regulations, criminal

proceedings may be initiated under the Pakistan Penal
Code or Code of Criminal Procedure in cases of severe
negligence but the same exercise may be made by the
Commission by referring the matter for criminal
proceedings after entertaining the complaint filed under
Section 13 of the Act. Since, the complainant has not
sought his remedy in accordance with the law specially
enacted for the purpose, therefore, the directions of the
learned DPP for registration of the FIR were illegal in
view of the law laid down in the case of Sultan Ali
Nanghiana supra (PLD 1949 Lahore 301) that where
a right is created by statute which also prescribes the
manner in which that right may be enforced, the party
complaining of any infringement of such right can only
seek such remedy as is provided by that statute. Thus,
registration of the FIR in question, being without lawful
authority and the investigation so conducted being of
no legal effect, are amenable to the jurisdiction of this
Court under Article 199(I)(a){ii) of the Constitution.
Guidance is taken from the judgment in the case of
Syed Hamid Ali Shah supra (PLD 2023 SC 265).

7. Adverting to the contention of learned counsel

for the complainant with regard to availability of

alternate remedy to petitioner under Sections 249-A or

Tpanett| o: Hon'ble Mr, urtice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mc Justice Shabig Khon

-]3-

265-K, Cr.P.C. suffice it to say that availability of
alternate remedy in each and every case would not bar
jurisdiction of High Court to entertain constitutional
petition. Reliance in this regard is placed on the case of

Mrs. Siddiqa Faiz {PLD 2008 SC 135) wherein it was

held that:

On the aspect whether writ lies before the High
Court when alternate and efficacious remedy is
available, it would be appropriate to refer to the
case of The Murree Brewery Co. Ltd. v. Pakistan
through the Secretary to Government of Pakistan
and others (PLO 1972 SC 279). It has been held
therein that the High Court will not entertain a writ
petition when other appropriate remedy is yet
available is not a rule of law barring jurisdiction but
a rule by which the Court regulates its jurisdiction.
When a statutory functionary acts mala fide or in a
partial, unjust and oppressive manner, the High
Court in the exercise of its writ jurisdiction has
power to grant relief to the aggrieved party.

8. Learned counsel for the complainant contended
that complainant has challenged the interim order
dated 14.06.2023 of this Court in the instant petition
before the apex Court, therefore, the prayer of
petitioner for quashing of the FIR cannot be entertained
by this Court prior to decision of the Hon’ble Supreme
Court on the law points formulated in the said petition
for consideration and verdict of the apex Court. Filing
of petition by complainant before the apex Court
against the order of this Court cannot be denied,
however, the learned counsel could not produce any
order for staying the proceedings in the instant petition

by this Court. Even the Court was apprised that the

Fjamutcs*| 08: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid khan

petition before the apex ‘Court has not been fixed for

hearing till date. In the mentioned situation, the
instant matter cannot be kept pending. The case law
referred to by learned counsel for the complainant
mainly pertains to jurisdiction of the High Court for
quashment of criminal proceedings during the
investigation in exercise of its inherent powers under
Section 561-A, Cr.P.C. However, same is not the
situation before this Court in the present case because
the petitioner seeks her remedy purely under Article
199 of the Constitution and investigation in the matter

has already been finalized, therefore, the case law

produced by learned counsel for the complainant .

cannot be applied to the present case in view of its
distinguishing facts and circumstances.

9. In light of the above discussion, instant petition
is allowed and FIR No. 83 dated 24.05.2023 under
Section 322 PPC registered against the petitioner at P.S
Munda, District Dir Lower is hereby quashed. However,
the complainant, if so advised, would be at liberty to
seek his remedy from the proper forum in accordance

with law. .

Announced.
