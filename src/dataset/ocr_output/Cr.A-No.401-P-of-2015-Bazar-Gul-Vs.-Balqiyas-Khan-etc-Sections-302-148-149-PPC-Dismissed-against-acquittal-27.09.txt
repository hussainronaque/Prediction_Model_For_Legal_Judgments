With

QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- Since Criminal
Appeal No.490-P/2015 by the State through
Advocate General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
Peshawar, also pertains to the same case,
this single judgment/order shall also dispose
of the said criminal appeal.

2. The instant appeal as well as the
aforesaid connected criminal appeal are
directed against the judgment dated

11.06.2015 of the learned Judge, Arti
Terrorism Court, Kohat Division, Kohat,
whereby, the respondents/accused in both the
appeals namely, Balgiyas Khan, Akhtar Hayat,
Arshad Muhammad, Naeem Khan, Zakirullah
and Jafer Iqbal were acquitted of the charges
leveled against them in case FIR No.395
dated 25.09.2013 under sections 302/148/149
PPC read with section 7-ATA, Police Station,
Karak, District Karak.

2. The case was registered on the report
of complainant, Bazar Gul, appellant in the
instant appeal who reported about the Qatl-i-
amd of his son, Amir Pervaiz, by the mobile
police party, when his son was returning home
after easing himself at 06:00 hours on
25.09.2013, and he was present on the
roadside. According to the complainant, his
son was trying to run away, and he also tried
to stop the police officials from firing at his
son, but their firing hit his son, and the mobile
police party left the spot by leaving his son in
injured condition. In his report, the

complainant claimed that neither his son was
armed nor involved in any crime, therefore, he
charged the mobile police party for causing
firearm injuries to his son. The injured Amir
Pervaiz later succumbed to the injuries while
on his way to Hospital at Peshawar; and
section 324 PPC was, therefore, substituted
with section 302 PPC read with section 7-ATA
and sections 148/149 PPC.

3. The initial medical examination and the
subsequent Postmortem examination of the
deceased, Amir Pervaiz, revealed one firearm
entry wound 1/1 cm posteriorly (L) occipital
region-no blackening of wound, with
corresponding exit wound and left eye
completely destroyed. The spot was also
inspected by the I.0, who secured blood from
the place assigned in the site plan to the
deceased, and nine empty shells of 7.62 bore
from one place and thirteen empty shells of
7.62 bore, freshly discharged, from another
place. In the site plan, the I.O also noted that
the deceased was present at a lower level

while the police party was at a height of 50
feet. In the site plan, prepared on the eventful
day i.e. 25.09.2013, additions of the places of
accused/respondents were made on the
pointation of the complainant on 27.09.2013.
The Kalashnikovs, allegedly used in the
commission of offence, along with chargers
and live rounds were also taken _ into
possession by the Investigation Officer.
Likewise, record of rescue 15 pertaining to
issuance of the official arms and ammunitions
was taken into possession by the Investigating
Officer. The accused/respondents were
arrested in the case. The arms and
ammunitions and empties recovered from the
spot were sent for examination to the firearms
expert, Punjab Forensic Science Agency; and
the report furnished by the agency is available
on the file as EX.P-2/1. After completion of
investigation, complete challan was submitted
in the Court, leading to trial in the Court of
learned Judge, Anti Terrorism Court, Kohat

Division, Kohat.
4. During trial, the prosecution produced
as many as 15 PWs, including Doctor
Sarfaraz Khan (PW-3), who conducted
Postmortem examination of the deceased;
Asmatullah (PW-12); Sattar Khan S.1/l.0 (PW-
13); complainant Bazar Gul (PW-14); and
Doctor Muhammad Ali (PW-15).

5. After prosecution closed its evidence,
statements of the accused/respondents were
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein,
they denied allegations of the prospection
against them; but declined to be examined on
oath or produce defence evidence; whereafter
the learned trial Court/Judge, Anti Terrorism
Court, Kohat Division, Kohat, heard
arguments of learned PP for the State
assisted by learned counsel for the
complainant and learned defence counsel,
and recorded impugned judgment of acquittal
of the accused/respondents dated
11.06.2015; hence the two appeals by the

complainant as well as the State.
6. Arguments of learned counsel for the
complainant/appellant, learned AAG = and
learned counsel for the accused/respondents
heard; and record perused.

7. In the FIR, neither anyone was
mentioned by name or description as accused
by the complainant nor motive for the offence
was disclosed, which all along remained
shrouded in mystery. Even presence of the
complainant on the spot at the time of
occurrence, which took place early in the
morning, is doubtful in view of admission of
the complainant that he had no specific work
at the spot at the time of occurrence and
came out of his house just for nothing.
Although, the complainant did not mention the
presence of anyone else on the scene of
occurrence at the relevant time; but
Asmatullah (PW-12) came forward to depose
that he rushed to the spot, where the police
boarded the vehicle and left the spot towards
Karak side and that as he reached the spot,

he saw deceased, Amir Pervaiz, lying in
injured condition. He further stated that
complainant was present on the spot when he
reached there and that one Behram Shehzad
was also attracted to the spot. According to
the PW, it was Bazar Gul, complainant, who
told them that police had injured his son by
firing, meaning thereby he was furnished a
hearsay account of firing by the police at the
son of the complainant. It may be added here
that, admittedly, the complainant had other
enmities in the village, therefore, absence of
motive on the part of the accused/respondents
would also make case of the prosecution
doubtful.

8. it appears that the
accused/respondents were, lateron, charged
by the complainant during investigation in his
statement under section 161 Cr.P.C, without a
proper identification parade as not even their
descriptions were given in the FIR. Asmatullah
(PW-12) categorically stated that he had not
identified the actual accused; and _ the

complainant stated that after perusing the
daily diary he charged the accused facing trial.
The arms and ammunitions recovered by the
1.0 were found in original condition, according
to the issuance register, indicating no firing
from the official weapons allotted to the
accused/respondents. The report of firearms
expert also did not support the prosecution
case, as the crime empties were not found to
have been fired from the places assigned to
the accused/respondents in the site plan.

9. In the site plan, the complainant was
shown at a distance of 285/300 feet from the
deceased; and a hillock of the height of 50
feet above the ground level was also shown
intervening in between the complainant and
the deceased, thus bringing credibility of the
complainant as an eyewitness under serious
doubt. The charging of the
accused/respondents by the complainant in
his supplementary statement under section
161 Cr.P.C on 27.09.2013 after the arrest of
the accused/respondents, reflected in the

daily diary, which was seen by the
complainant before charging the
accused/respondents, would further
strengthen the perception that

accused/respondents were not charged on the
basis of some credible information. In any
case, both the material witnesses i.e. the
complainant and Asmatullah (PW-12), can at
best, be regarded as chance witnesses and
their testimony not confidence inspiring.

10. The medical and postmortem
examination reports are also not supporting
version of the  complainant/prosecution,
alleging indiscriminate firing by — six
accused/respondents, while the deceased
receiving only one firearm injury, thus giving
rise to the question as to whose fire proved
effective and shot caused death of the
deceased son of the complainant. Moreover,
the accused/respondents had been shown
standing at a height of 50 feet from the
deceased, while the entry wound with
corresponding wound shown in both the

medical report as well as the postmortem
report would suggest otherwise. In short, there
was no evidence to warrant conviction of the
accused/respondents, therefore, the
impugned judgment of the learned trial
Court/Judge, Anti Terrorism Court, Kohat
Division, Kohat, dated 11.06.2015, thereby,
acquitting the accused/respondents would not
call for interference by this Court in its
Appellate Jurisdictions. Both the appeals of
the complainant as well as that of the State
are, accordingly, dismissed being devoid of

merit and substance.
