2. The petitioner has also filed connected

Quashment Petition No. 75-M/2016 under section 561-A

Cr.PC against the order 20.09.2016, whereby warrant of arrest

against the petitioner was issued and summoned his sureties in

Criminal revision No.21 of 2015, pending before the learned

lower Court. Both the petitions are going to be decided

through this single judgment.

3. Petitioner alongwith his co-accused namely Bilal

Ahmad son of Maloom Khan were charged in case FIR No.

59 dated 25.01.2014 under section 337-A(i)/ 337-F(ii) PPC

Police Talash, lower Dir. The petitioner alongwith his co-

accused were tried by learned Judicial Magistrate/ Illaqa Qazi

and were convicted vide judgment dated 29.10.2015 under the

following heads.

(i) Petitioner was convicted under section
337-A(i) PPC and was burdened to pay the
amount of Rs. 125000/- to the
complainant/ victim as Daman.

(ii) Bilal was convicted under section 337-F(ii)
PPC and was burdened to pay Rs.100000/-

as Daman to the complainant/ injured.

(iii) They were further directed to make the

requisite payment after sixty (60) days.
-3-

(iv) The petitioner alongwith ;co-accused were
also directed to furnish bonds to the tune
of Rs. 200000/- with two sureties for the
payment of Daman in the requisite period
and in case of failure of furnishing surety
bonds they were ordered to be kept in jail
indefault to undergo one year simple

imprisonment.

4. Being aggrieved the appellant assailed judgment

of learned Judicial Magistrate/ Illaqa Qazi, through Criminal

appeal filed in the Court of learned Sessions Judge/ Zilla Qazi

Lower Dir on 20.11.2015. The State also filed revision

petition for enhancement of the sentence.

5. Learned appellate court after admitting the case

for regular hearing, the sentence of petitioner and co-appellant

was suspended, vide order dated 02.11.2015 on the bonds

already executed by them.

6. On 01.03.2016 petitioner submitted an

application under section 540-A Cr.PC for his exemption on

the premise that he is proceeding to Saudi Arabia and his Visa

is going to expire on 10.03.2016. Certain documents were also

appended with the application. On the Margin of the said
-4-

application order passed by the learned Sessions Judge is that,

“Place on relevant file and notice be given to the State/

complainant for date fixed” After hearing the parties on

20.09.2016, the learned trial court passed the impugned order

and turned down the request of exemption. In addition to that

appeal against conviction to the extent of present petitioner

was also dismissed on the ground that he has left the country

without permission of the Court. The petitioner filed

connected Quashment petition as well as Criminal revision

petition for setting aside impugned judgment and by accepting

exemption application, the case be remanded to decided

afresh on merits.

7. Arguments heard and record perused.

8. First question before this Court would be that

where the appellate Court/ Court of Session can grant

exemption or not and that’s too when he has been adjudged

already by the competent Court of law/trial court.

9. Appellate Court enjoys the same powers which

are bestowed by statute upon the trial court. In other words it
-5-
is now more than settled that appeal is continuation of trial.

Reliance is placed on case titled “Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto,

MNA, Leader of the Opposition, Bilawal_ House, Karachi,
Vs. The State through Chief Ehtesab Commissioner” (1999

SCMR 1619), wherein it is held that:

“10. Mr. Aitzaz Ahsan, learned Senior
Advocate Supreme Court for the appellant
was right to rely on Muhammad Ashfaque
alias Chief v. The State 1998 PCr.LJ 1486),
to contend that in similar circumstances a
Division Bench of the Sindh High Court
allowed the appeal, in absentia, of Mr. Altaf
Hussain, Chief of the MQM (who had been
convicted of such heinous offences as under
sections 592, 394 and 395, P.P.C., i.e.
robbery and dacoity with force and firearms).
While entertaining, hearing and accepting
the appeal in the absence of the convicted
appellant the learned Division Bench had

observed:--

"The appeal is a fundamental right and is a
continuation of proceedings. When a person
can be tried in absentia, there is no reason as
to why his appeal could not be heard as

such."
-6-

I see no reason why a similar treatment be

not meted out the appellant herein.”

10. From the above judgment the guidance can

easily be inferred that the appellate court can grant exemption,

as the appeal is continuation of trial, therefore, provision of

section 540-A Cr.PC, is equally applicable to the case of

petitioner in appeal. For resolving the question of exemption

to the petitioner and to understand the intent of the law maker,

the said provision is reproduced below.

540-A. Provision for inquiries and trial
being held in the absence of accused in
certain cases. (1) At any stage of an inquiry
or trial under this Code, where two or more
accused are before the court, if the Judge or
Magistrate is satisfied for reason to be
recorded, that any one or more of such
accused is or incapable of remaining before
the Court, he may, if such accused is
represented by a pleader, dispense with his
attendance and proceed with such inquiry or
trial in his absence, and may, at any
subsequent stage of the proceedings, direct

the personal attendance of such accused.

(2) ‘If the accused in any such case is not
represented by a pleader, or if the 'Judge or

Magistrate considers his personal attendance
-7-

necessary, he may, if he thinks fit, and for
reasons to be recorded by him either adjourn
such inquiry or trial, or order that the case of

such accused be taken up or tried separately.

11. The petitioner submitted application to the

learned appellate Court, when he was present in the country

and the same was noticed to the state and complainant. In his

application he was catagoric that he is proceeding to Saudi

Arabia on 03.03.2016, while his Visa was due to expire on

10.03.2016, so there after he left the country. Had the position

been otherwise and if he had left the country without

submission of application, then of course the position would

have been altogether different. When the accused/ petitioner

left the country, then too his application may be considered, as

physical presence of an accused before the Court is not a

condition precedent for granting him exemption from

appearance. Provisions relating to exemption in the Code of

Criminal Procedure are, 116, 205, 540-A Cr.PC and even

otherwise there is nothing in the Code of Criminal Procedure

which forbade the Court for grant of exemption in the interest
-8-
of justice by keeping in view peculiar circumstances of the

each and every case.

12. No doubt grant of exemption is discretion of the

Court, but these being beneficial provisions or to be

interpreted liberally in order to meet the ends of Justice. To

give effect to form and not to the substance would certainly

defeat the ends of justice and ultimately the law itself. The

same would be an approach prejudicial to the system itself.

13. While dealing with the question of

exemption and other ancillary matters conduct of the accused

is of much relevance, therefore, it is worth mentioning here

that during trial petitioner remained on exemption throughout

and when he was ordered by the learned trial court to appear,

he accordingly appeared before the learned trial court. It is

admitted fact that petitioners were burdened only to pay

Daman to the injured. In a like situation, the Hon’ble apex

Court in case titled “Haji Aurangzeb Vs Mushtaq Ahmad

and another “(PLD 2004 SC 533), held as under:

“Incapability is word of wide import and may

cover all circumstances beyond the control of
-9-

the accused. The exemption could be granted
in absence in extremely exceptional cases like
ailment of accused which rendered his
movement difficult (like the case of paralysis)
or departure from country or station is
absolutely necessary and there is no time to
have recourse to the court for seeking

permission / exemption.

The provisions of section 540-A
Cr.PC are also to be interpreted with
benevolence, because it is an _ enabling
provision not meant to punish some one. The
section, in the circumstances, aims at
achieving three fold benefit. One benefit
being that of the exempted accused, second
being that of he co-accused under trial and
third being the convenience of the Court

itself.”

14. The accused had left the country after

submitting exemption application, as his visa was going to

expire. For granting of exemption physical presence of an

accused before the Court is not a condition precedent and the

learned trial court/appellate court may exempt the accused in

his absence. Reliance is placed on case titled “Tahir

Muhammad Vs. Mst. Arifa another” (PLD 2003 Peshawar

123).
-10-

15. When facts of the present case and prayer of the

petitioner in his application for grant of exemption are taken

into consideration in view of this Court the learned appellate

court has not exercised jurisdiction conferred by law properly

by it.

16. Learned appellate Court dismissed the appeal on

the sole ground of non-presence of petitioner, while the

learned appellate court after admitting the appeal, was under

legal obligation to peruse the record and dispose of the appeal

on merits giving reasons in support of judgment proposed to

be given even in absence of accused/ appellant therein.

Reliance is placed on case titled “Muhamamd Ashig Fazir Vs

the State” (PLD 1970 Supreme Court 177).

17. For the reasons discussed above, both the

petitions are allowed, impugned judgment and order dated

20.09.2016 of learned Sessions Judge/Zilla Qazi Dir Lower at

Timergara, are set aside, consequently criminal appeal filed

before the learned appellate Court is restored, which was

dismissed to the extent of appellant. Since there is revision for
-1l-
enhancement of sentence filed by the state, this would be
appropriate that the petitioner shall be present at the time of
announcement of judgment. As the petitioner is abroad and
these petitions have been filed by his counsel after obtaining
power of attorney, the petitioner is directed to appear before
the appellate court within four months, while appellate court
shall dispose of the same at the earliest.

Announced.
