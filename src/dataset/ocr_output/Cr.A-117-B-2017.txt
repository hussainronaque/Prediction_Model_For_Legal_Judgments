SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH , J.- Through this

single judgment we intend to dispose of instant

Criminal appeal as well as Cr. Revision No.29-B of

2017, titled Mujeeb-ur-Rehman Vs Shabeer-ur-

Rehman, being arisen out of one and same judgment

dated 13/05/2017.

*Azam/P.S* (D.B) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
Shabir-ur-Rahman, the appellant/convict

through present criminal appeal preferred under

of Rs.5,000/- or to undergo further

one month S.I indefault whereof.

iii. Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C has
also been extended to the convict/

appellant.

3. The complainant Mujeeb-ur-Rehman has
also filed a criminal revision No. 29-B of 201 against
the convict / appellant Shabir ur Rehman.

4. According to the prosecution version as
disclosed in the F.I.R, that it was on 06-10-2013 at
1100 hours, when the complainant Mujeeb-ur-
Rehman reported the matter to the local police on the
spot to the effect that on the eventful day, he
alongwith deceased brother Sadeeq-ur-Rehman had
come to their land, situated in village Tatter Khel and
after spending some time, they were coming back to
their home, when at about 10.15 hours, absconding
co-accused Naseer Khan armed with Kalashnikov
while appellant/accused Shabir-ur-Rehman, duly

armed with .30 bore pistol, riding on their motor

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullab.
cycle, reached there at the place of occurrence and

asked them that why he (complainant) and his

deceased brother had come to the land and thereafter

both of them started firing upon Sadeeq-ur-Rehman

with the intention to commit his qatl-i-amd,

resultantly he was hit and died on the spot; that

thereafter the accused also made firing at complainant

but he luckily escaped unhurt; that the motive was

stated to be the dispute over landed property. The

report was taken down into murasila (Ex.PW 6/1) by

Raham Dad HC (Rtd) (PW-6), who also prepared

injury sheet and inquest report (Ex.PW 6/2 & Ex.PW

6/3). Thereafter he sent the dead body for autopsy to

the doctor under the escort of constable Raham Niaz

No.1462, while murasila was sent to the Police

station through constable Zia Ullah, the contents of

which were incorporated into F.1.R (Ex: PW 8/1) by

Rasool Muhammad SI (Rtd) (PW-8). And handed

over copy of the same to Mumtaz Khan SI CTD

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
Kohat (PW-10), for conducting investigation in the
instant case.

5. After completion of investigation by
Mutmaz Khan SI CTD Kohat (PW-10), complete
challan was submitted before the trial court against
both the accused named above. On arrest of
appellant/accused, supplementary challan was
submitted in the trial court. He was summoned from
District Jail, Karak. After fulfillment of codal
formalities U/S 265-C Cr.P.C, he was charge sheeted
and the trial commenced against the accused.

6. In order to prove its case, prosecution
examined as many as (10) witnesses. After closure of
the prosecution evidence, statement of appellant/
accused Shabir ur Rahman was recorded under section
342 Cr.P.C, wherein he professed his innocence. He
neither wished to be examined on oath, as required
under section 340 (2)Cr.P.C. nor opted to produce

defence evidence. After hearing the prosecutor and

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramulah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadultah.
defence, learned trial court convicted and sentenced
appellant/ accused, vide the impugned judgment,
hence the instant appeal.

7. We have considered the submissions of
learned counsel for the parties, AAG for the state and
gone through the record of the case.

8. The complainant reported the matter to
the local police at 11.00 a.m on 06-10-2013 regarding
the murder of his brother Sadeeq-ur-Rehman which
was taken down vide murasila (Ex.PW 6/1). The
report shows that the complainant in the company of
the deceased had come to the fields belonging to his
uncle who was settled in Canada. It was 10:15 am
when they after taking tea in the adjoining baitak of
one Mir Wali came out to leave for their village when
the accused/appellant with his brother Naseer came on
motor cycle duly armed, they first warned them of
their coming to the spot fields and then fired with

their respective weapons on targeting both the

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
deceased and complainant. The complainant was
examined as PW-6, wherein he stated that they had
started for village when the incident occurred but the
distance between point No.1 where he was shown
present and point No.2 where the deceased shown
present is shown 47 paces which confirms that the
complainant was not accompanying the deceased at
the relevant time. The complainant stated that he was
also fired at but escaped unhurt, had he been present
being empty handed he too was at the mercy of the
assailants and they would have easily done away with
him. In case titled “Zahir Shah Vs the State” (2019
MLD 1562), wherein it is held that:

“Admittedly, the deceased
along with PW-1 to PW-3
were standing closely and
after making indiscriminate
firing there were no chances
of PWs to escape unhurt and
also. there was _ every
possibility that the deceased
had received multiple bullet

injuries, but the picture is

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
quite different from the
presumptions and
expectations as suggests by
the situation, when the
deceased had only received
two bullet injuries on his
person, while all the PWs
were escaped unhurt.”

9. The spot is lying on the metal road and
the scribe confirmed the inter-se link between police
post Ahmad Abad and the spot through a metal road.
The occurrence occurred at 10:15 a.m but no effort
was made to shift the deceased to the Police station
and to report the matter there, rather the body was
lying on the spot when a private person namely Ilyas
Khan contacted the scribe on his cell phone who
reached to the sot at 11.00 a.m, when the villagers and
relatives had already arrived and the vehicles were
available on the spot, had the complainant been
present with the deceased at the time of firing, he
would have either shifted the dead body to the police
station or to the hospital, but infact the complainant

was in the village and was informed there, where from

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
he in the company of his relatives reached to the spot
within 30 minutes. We are still struggling to know
that who was Ilyas, who informed the police and that
why his statement was not recorded? The complainant
stated that soon after the occurrence Cot was
arranged and the dead body was shifted to the baitak
of one Mirwali, we are surprised that why the “Cot”
was shifted to the baitak, rather it should have been
shifted to the police station for report, but this stance
was openly contradicted by other witnesses, i.e PW-6
Raham Dad, who is the scribe, stated that when he
reached to the spot, the dead body was lying in the
field and PW.9 Israr, who escorted the dead body to
the hospital, stated that when they reached, the dead
body was lying on the ground. The complainant
further stated that he did not accompany the dead
body to the hospital, rather preferred to stay on the
spot with PW-6, the conduct of the witness is not

natural and badly failed to convince us, as his first

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS, Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah,
-10-

priority would be to accompany the dead body to the
hospital, rather than to stay in the adjoining baithak
for hours. We are again surprised that what the scribe
was doing on the spot for two/three hours, as by then
the I.O had not reached and no further investigation
could be conducted by him as being Head constable,
was not authorized and it was then, when the
Investigating officer arrived at 1.30 p.m to the spot,
who then effected the recoveries and prepared the site
plan. Infact the attitude of the witnesses is not only
abnormal, rather an attempt was made to cover the
delay on one side and to make the presence of the
complainant/believable on the other, but they failed to
convince and we can safely hold that the witness was
interested and procured and that the FIR was
registered after preliminary investigation. In case

titled “Muhammad Ashraf alias Acchu Vs the State”

(2019 SCMR 652), wherein it is held that:

“It is well settled that benefit

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-ll-

of slightest doubt must go to
an accused and in a case
where the Court reaches a
conclusion that eye-witnesses
were chance witnesses; they
had not witnessed the
occurrence and the
prosecution story is concocted
by the PWs, then the case of
the accused merits plain

acquittal.”

10. The presence of the witness is not free
from doubt, as the complainant had no personal
property but it was the property of their uncle who
was residing in Canada and that the accused were
their first cousins, the complainant could not show the
purpose of his presence and coming to the fields.
Even the accused had got nothing on the spot, neither
the complainant was ploughing or sowing the field or
were in possession of the same which annoyed the
accused to a degree to kill the deceased. Had the
complainant been present and the accused had the

intention to kill them, no hurdle was there to stop

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-12-

them from killing the complainant as well. Infact the

prosecution is travelling with the weakest motive,

though this motive was alleged but nothing was

brought forwarded to prove the same. In case titled

“Noor Muhammad Vs_the State another” (2010

SCMR 97), wherein it is held that:

“It appears that the prosecution has
abandoned the motive. In these
circumstances, solitary statement of
the complainant without any
supporting evidence and
particularly’ when the incident
occurred on 20-9-1995 did not take
place in his presence is very unsafe
to be relied upon. Thus, the
prosecution has failed to prove the
motive. It has been held in the case
of Muhammad Sadiq v. Muhammad
Sarwar 1979 SCMR 214 that when
motive is alleged but not proved
then the ocular evidence required to
be scrutinized with great caution. In
the case of Hakim Ali v. The State
1971 SCMR 432 it has been held
that the prosecution though not
called upon to establish motive in
every case, yet once it has set up a

motive and failed to establish it, the

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-13-

prosecution must suffer
consequence and not the defence. In
the case of Ameenullah vy. State
PLD 1976 SC 629 it has been held
that where motive is an important
constituent and is found by the
Court to be untrue, the Court,
Should be on guard to accept
prosecution story.”

11. The place of occurrence is surrounded by
fields but no farmer from the adjoining lands was
made a witness. Mirwali Khan who was an important
witness though was examined U/S 161 Cr.P.C but he
did not turn up to record his statement during the trial
as he was the witness who could say that the
complainant had come in the company of the accused
and who could better explain that who shifted the
dead body of the deceased to his baitak but he
avoided to appear mainly for the reason that he was
not ready to support false charge of the complainant
and his nonproduction leads to a negative inference

against the prosecution. In case titled, “Riaz Ahmad

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS, Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-14-

Vs the State” (2010 SCMR 846), wherein it is held

that:

“One of the eye-witnesses
Manzoor Hussain was available
in the Court on 29-7-2002 but the
prosecution did not examine him,
declaring him as unnecessary
witness without realizing the fact
that he was the most important,
only serving witness, being an
eye-witness of the occurrence.

Therefore, his evidence was the

SS

best piece of the evidence, which
the prosecution could have relied
upon for proving the case but for
the reasons best known, his
evidence was withheld and he
was not examined. So a
presumption under Illustration
(g) of Article 129 of Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 can fairly
be drawn that had the eye-witness
Manzoor Hussain been examined
in the Court his evidence would
have been unfavourable to the
prosecution.”

12. The ocular account is in conflict with the

medical evidence. The deceased was facing the

accused the seat of injuries and the place of the

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-15-

deceased do not support the stance of the complainant
as one injury was from front to back but the others
were from left to right. The doctor has given the time
between death and postmortem as 3 to 4 hours which
takes the time of death earlier than the one noted. The
dead body was identified by the relative and co-
villagers, i.e before the police and before the doctor at
the time of post mortem examination, had the
complainant been present at the spot, he would have
at least identified the deceased before the police as the
Inquest report was already prepared on the spot. This
being so, we cannot hold otherwise but that it was a
blind murder. In case titled “Nasir Ali and others Vs
Sajjad Hussain_and_others (PLD 2006 Supreme
Court 560), wherein it is held that:

“The learned High Court had
given finding of fact against the
petitioner after proper
appreciation of evidence with
ocular testimony directly in
conflict with medical evidence. It

is a settled A principle of law that

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullab Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-16-

in case of conflict between the
ocular and medical evidence, then
medical evidence is to be
preferred. See Bagh Ali's case
(1983 SCMR 1292) and
Muhammad Aslam's case (1969
SCMR 462). It is pertinent to
mention here that statement of
eye-witnesses in respect of nature
and seat of injuries could not
connect the respondents as their
statements are not inconsonance
with medical evidence and this
finding was duly considered/noted
by the High Court after re-
appraisal of eye-witnesses and the
medical evidence in minutely.”

13. The learned counsel for the appellant
vehemently argued that the appellant remained
absconder for sufficient long time, but mere
absconscion of accused is not conclusive guilt of an
accused person; it is only a suspicious circumstance
against an accused that he was found guilty of the
offence. However, suspicions after all are suspicions,
the same cannot take the place of proof, the value of

absconcion, therefore, depends on the facts of each

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-17-

case. In case titled "Liagat Hussain and others Vs
Falak Sher and others" (2003 SCMR_ 61l1(a),

wherein it has been held:-

"(a) Eye-witnesses including the
complainant had failed to
furnish a_ plausible’ and
acceptable explanation for being
present on the scene of
occurrence and were chance
witnesses---Prosecution case did
not inspire confidence and fell
Sor short of sounding probable to
a man of reasonable
prudence---Abscondence of
accused in such circumstances
could not offer any useful
corroboration to the case of

prosecution"

14. Be that as it may, the prosecution
failed to convince this court that it was non-else

but accused who killed the deceased.

15. After thoroughly evaluating the evidence
available on file this court reaches to an inescapable

conclusion that the prosecution has miserably failed to

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-18-

prove its case against accused/appellant. Resultantly,
this appeal is, therefore, allowed, the conviction and
sentence of the appellant recorded by the learned trial
court is set-aside and he is acquitted of the charge by
extending him the benefit of doubt, he shall be
released forth with from jail, if not required to be
detained in connection with any other case. So far as
the connected Criminal Revision No.29-B/2017 is
concerned, the same stands dismissed.

16. Above are the reasons of our short order

of the even date.
