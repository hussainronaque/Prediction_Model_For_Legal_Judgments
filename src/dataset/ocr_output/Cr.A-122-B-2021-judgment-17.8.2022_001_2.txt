2. The’ prosecution story as disclosed in the
FIR, registered on the basis of murasila, in brief, is
that on 16.5.2020, an information regarding
transportation of the dead body to Civil Hospital Mir
Ali was communicated to Dost Ayub Khan SHO
(PW-9), during patrol duty, whereupon he alongwith
other police Nafri rushed there and found dead body
of Wagar Ahmad son of Rehman Syed Khan, where
he was informed that the deceased was done to death
by his brother (the present appellant) by firing at him
in Khaddi Bazaar, as a result of domestic dispute.

3. On completion of the investigation,
complete challan against the accused was submitted
before the learned trial Court where at the
commencement of trial, the prosecution produced and
examined as many as nine (9) witnesses, whereafter,
statement of the accused under section 342 Cr.P.C,
was recorded wherein he professed innocence and
false implication, however, neither he wished to be
examined under section 340(2) Cr.P.C, nor opted to
produce defence evidence. The learned trial after
hearing arguments, convicted the appellant and
sentenced him, as mentioned above, which has been
assailed by the appellant through the instant criminal
appeal.

4. We have heard the arguments of the

counsel but for the sake of brevity without
-3-

reproducing the same it would be ‘dealt with in the
body of this judgment at appropriate junctures.

5. There is no denial to the fact that in case
of single accused substitution is a rare phenomenon,
however, it cannot equally be denied that charge
against single accused will not absolve the prosecution
of its liability to prove the case through trustworthy
and confidence inspiring evidence. In order to
ascertain as to whether the impugned judgment is
based on proper reasoning and that the learned trial
Court correctly applied its judicial mind to the facts
and circumstances of the case keeping in view the
evidence available on the file, we deem it essential to
thrash out the evidence so as to avoid miscarriage of
justice.

6. Scanning of the record reveals that as per
prosecution version, the occurrence allegedly
occurred in Khaddi Market situated within limits of
Khaddi Adda, however, unfortunately no one
amongst the shopkeepers was cited as witness to
have seen the occurrence. Although the Medical
Officer while appearing in the witness box as PW-2
stated that the dead body was brought and identified
by Nasir ud Din and Suleman Khan, however, only
Nasir ud Din appeared before the trial Court as
PW-7, but he did not utter a single word regarding

transportation of the dead body from the spot to the
-4-

hospital. The other witness namely Suleman Khan
was not produced before the Court. Even the
complainant SHO while deposing before the Court
as PW-9, was unable to mention the name of the
person who allegedly informed him about the
occurrence on mobile phone, nor he mentioned cell
phone number of the alleged informer. He was also
unable to tell as to whether the dead body was
brought to the hospital by relatives of the deceased
or private persons. He stated that when he reached
to the Emergency Room of hospital, only medical
staff was present with the dead body. Even he was
unable to give the name of the person who identified
the dead body before him. He was also unaware
about the wounds on the dead body. He clearly
admitted that no private person as well as the
relative of the deceased had come forward for
report.

7. Since the occurrence is unseen one,
therefore, to meet the ends of justice, it would be
better to peruse the statement of Investigating Officer,
namely Qaza Khan (PW-4). It is surprising that the
spot was pointed out to the Investigating Officer by
nearby shopkeepers, however, as per deposition of this
witness those shopkeepers were reluctant to record
their statements. He stated that he had not even

mentioned their names in the investigation
-5-

proceedings. He stated that widow and aunt of the-
deceased were not the eyewitness to the occurrence.
He further stated that the widow and aunt of the
deceased were not present at the time of spot
inspection. He further stated that he had not
mentioned as to how the widow and aunt of the
deceased came to know about the incident. Besides,
this witness prepared site plan, took into possession
blood stains through cotton and an empty of .30 bore,
recorded statements of PWs as well as identifier and
received blood stained garments of the deceased at the
spot produced by police constable. In our considered
view, the shopkeepers were the star witnesses of the
occurrence, however, none amongst them came
forward to become a witness. True that in this newly
merged area, people avoid to become a witness in
such like cases, however, it is equally true that law
does not accept such type of an excuse.

8. Mst. Karishma, widow of the deceased
appeared as PW-5, who stated that on the day of
occurrence, her husband went to village Khaddai at
about 4:00 PM to propitiate his father where his step-
brother Noor Ullah committed his murder by firing at
him. During cross-examination, although this witness
stated that one or two months prior to the occurrence
some grudges arose between the deceased and his

father, however, she did not specify those grudges.
-6-

She stated that immediately after the incident she was
informed, however, she admitted that she had not
gone to police station for reporting the matter, rather
police had come to their house where her statement
was recorded. Even she was unable to testify as to
who and through what source she was informed about
the occurrence. Similar is the situation with the
statement of Mst. Hakim Gulla (PW-6), who happens
to be aunt of the appellant.

9. The record further transpires that although
an empty of .30 bore was recovered during the spot
inspection and as per statement of concerned Medical
Officer (PW-2), an entrance wound on the left side of
the neck just behind the ear and exit wound on the
forehead just above the right eye was observed,
however, since no recovery has been effected from the
accused, therefore, the alleged recovery and the
postmortem report become immaterial, as it is by now
well settled that such piece of evidence is a
corroboratory evidence which does not identify the
assailant, especially when the site plan was prepared
by the Investigating Officer on his own observation.
10. The prosecution did not succeed in
establishing the alleged motive. As the parties were
not in a blood-feud, so in such eventuality the
importance of the alleged motive gains much weight

and once alleged, the prosecution was under the
-7-

bounden duty to prove the same. True that absence or
weakness of motive will not demolish the prosecution
case, but the same principle does not apply here, as
the motive was stated to be a dispute between the
deceased and his father, so the prosecution was in all
circumstances to prove the same. With regard to
motive, specific question was put to the accused
during his statement under section 342, Cr.P.C. to
which he answered that there was no domestic issue
because their father was still alive and was serving as
a teacher at Government Middle School at ‘Gardai
Rogha’ Tehsil Dosalli. In this view of the matter,
when the prosecution has not succeeded in
establishing the motive, then it is for the prosecution
to suffer, as is held in case titled "Hakim Ali Vs, The
State" (1971 SCMR-432 that the prosecution
though not called upon to establish motive in every
case, yet once it has setup a motive and failed to
establish, the prosecution must suffer consequences
and not the defence. The above view has been
reiterated in the case of "Amin Ullah Vs. The State"
(PLD 1976 SC 629), wherein, it has been observed by
their lordships, that motive is an important constituent
and if found by the Court to be untrue, the Court
should be on guard to accept the prosecution story. It

was again re-enforced by the august Supreme Court in

the case of Muhammad Sadiq Vs. Muhammad
-8-

Sarwar _(1997 SCMR 2/4). Again, on the same

principle, case laws titled Noor Muhammad Vs. The
State and another (2010 SCMR 997) and Amin Ali
and_another Vs. The State (2011 SCMR-323) can
also be referred.

jl. There is no two opinion about the fact that
the cardinal principle of justice always laid emphasis
on the quality of evidence which must be of first
degree and = sufficient enough to dispel the
apprehension of the Court with regard to the
implication of innocent persons alongwith guilty one
by the prosecution, otherwise, the golden principle of
justice would come into play that even a single doubt
if found reasonable would be sufficient to acquit the
accused, giving him/them benefit of doubt because
bundle of doubts are not required to extend the legal
benefit to the accused. In this regard, reliance is

placed on a view held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in case titled Riaz Masih alias Mithoo Vs. State (NLR
1995 Cr.SC 694).

12. The accumulative effect of the whole
aspects taken into consideration, leads us to an
inescapable conclusion that the prosecution has
miserably failed to establish the case against the
appellant, otherwise to extend benefit of doubt so

many circumstances are not required. In the case of

Tarig Pervez Vs. The State 1995 SCMR 1345, it
-9-

was observed by Apex Court that, for giving the-
benefit of doubt, it was not necessary that there
should be many circumstances creating doubts. If
there is circumstance which created reasonable
doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of the
accused, then the accused would be entitled to the
benefit of doubt not as a matter of grace and
concession but as a matter of right. Accordingly,
the instant criminal appeal is allowed, the impugned
judgment is set aside and the appellant is acquitted of
the charges levelled against him. He shal! be released
forthwith, if not required to be detained in connection
with any other criminal case.

13. Above are the detailed reasons of our short
order of even date.
