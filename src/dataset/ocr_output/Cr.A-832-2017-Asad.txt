JUDGMENT

woke
AHMAD ALI, J. This common judgment shall also
decide the connected appeal against acquittal (Cr.A
No.289-P/2017 titled “State Ws Iftikhar”) being
outcome of one and the same judgment dated
24.02.2017. The appellant (Asad s/o Mir Dad) has
called in question the said judgment of the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-XIV/Judge, Special
Court, Peshawar, whereby the appellant was
convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment with
fine of Rs.100,000/- or in default thereof to suffer
six months S.I, in case FIR No.616 dated 14.11.2012
u/s 9-C CNSA, Police Station, Sarband (Peshawar),
whereas, accused-respondent in the above referred
acquittal appeal (Iftikhar) was acquitted.

2. Brief facts of the case, as per prosecution’s
version, are that on the eventful day, the

complainant/PW-5 (Safdar Khan, SHO), received spy
2

information regarding smuggling of narcotics from tribal
territory via Ring Road, through motorcar/Daewoo
bearing Registration # LPT-7620. Pursuant to said
information, he laid Nakabandi at the spot. In the
meanwhile, the vehicle in question came from Bara
Tribal Territory, which was stopped. On query, the
driver disclosed his name as Asad (present appellant),
whereas, the person occupying its front seat disclosed his
name as Kamran (later on found to _ be
Iftikhar/respondent in the connected appeal). Search of
the vehicle led to the recovery of 28 kgs of charas
contained in 28 packets (1000 grams each), hidden in the
secret cavities of the vehicle. 5/5 gram from each packet
were separated for chemical analysis of FSL and sealed
into parcel No.1 to 28 whereas the remaining contraband
was sealed in another parcel No.29 duly stamped with
“SK” monograms. On the basis of Murasila (Ex.PA/1),
the instant FIR (Ex.PA) was lodged against the accused.

3. On completion of investigation, complete challan
against the accused-appellant and acquitted co-accused
was submitted in Court where they were charge-sheeted,
however, they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The
prosecution in order to prove its case, produced and
examined as many as five witnesses whereafter
statement of the accused were recorded, wherein, they

professed their innocence.
4. The learned Trial Court, after conclusion of trial,
found the appellant guilty of the charge and, while
recording his conviction, sentenced him as mentioned
above. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant has filed the
instant appeal before this Court, whereas, co-accused
(Iftikhar) was acquitted from the charge and against his
acquittal, the State has preferred the connected appeal.
That is why both the appeals are taken together for
disposal.
5. Arguments heard and record gone through.
6. Allegation against the appellant is that, 28 kgs of
charas were recovered from the vehicle driven by the
appellant when he was accompanied by the acquitted co-
accused.
7. The Seizing Officer while appearing before the
Court as PW-5. Some of the important portions of his
statement are reproduced below for ready reference:-
PW-5

“I separated five grams charas from each
packet for FSL and sealed into parcels No.1
to 28 while the remaining charas already
Ex.P1 was sealed into parcel No.29 b affixing
3/3 seals of SK monograms. The contraband
alongwith motorcar and duplicate
registration were taken into possession
through recovery memo already Ex.PC in
presence of marginal witnesses. I drafted the
murasila Ex.PA and sent the same to the
Police Station for registration of case.
Similarly, I have also issued card of arrest of
both the accused Ex.PW5/1. I have also
drafted an application Ex.PW5/2 for sending
the samples to the FSL.
4

XX....The murasila was dispatched through
constable Naseer to the Police Station in
private vehicle.......... The contraband and
motorcar was brought to the Police Station
by myself. The IO was present in the police
station when I brought the contraband,
accused and motorcar to the Police Station. I
handed over the contraband to the Moharrir

for onward submission to the FSL”

8. Contrarily, the IO of the case, while appearing
before the Court as PW-1, narrated in his cross
examination, as under:-

PW-1

“XX....The FIR was handed over to me in
the police station. The case property was not
handed over to me on the spot. Self stated
that the case property has already been sent
to the PS alongwith the murasila and
recovery memo. I have conducted no
personal search of both the accused. I have
not found during my investigation regarding
the ownership of the accused facing trial
which connect them with the commission of
offence. I have personally examined the
secret cavities in the vehicle in question. It is
correct that the secret cavities were closed
during my examination. Self stated that the
complainant recovered the charas and they
closed the secret cavities. It is correct that
nothing regarding the offence such as case
property, accused or other incriminating
recovered by the complainant, handed over
to me by the complainant for investigation.
Self stated that the accused was already in
the police lock up and the case property was
shown to me by the Moharrir of the PS

which was lying in the police station.”

PW-1/IO has clearly contradicted PW-5/Complainant
on certain material points, which creates serious doubts

in the version of prosecution with regard to mode and
5

manner of the occurrence. PW-2 is the scriber of FIR,
who affirmed receipt of murasila from Naseer
constable, but negated the stance of PW-1/IO regarding
transmission of Murasila alongwith case property. This
witnesses has not offered any word regarding receipt of
any case property. PW-5, though, categorically narrated
the story of recovery and seizure of the contraband and
stated that the contraband was handed over to the
Moharrir of the police station for onward submission to
the FSL, but to our utter surprise, no such Moharrir was
ever produced before the Court. Similarly, FC No.2391,
who took the samples to FSL, was also not examined
during the trial. Record further suggests that one of the
PW, namely, Shaukat Kamal, ASI, who was the gnd
marginal witness to the recovery memo, was also not
examined for unknown reasons. All these important
witnesses, being associated with the recovered
contraband at the relevant time, were not produced
before the Trial Court. In the situation, not only adverse
inference under Article 129(g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat
Order 1984 could be safely drawn, but legal inference
could also be drawn that if these witnesses had entered
into the witness box, they would have not supported the
prosecution case.

9. There is also no record or any assertion that the
samples and case property were ever kept in Malkhana.

Had it been, the Register No.19 would have been
6

examined. In this situation, the safe custody of the
samples and case property is not proved. Guidance could
be sought from case law reported in 2019 SCMR 608

wherein it was held by the apex Court that;

“In a case where safe custody of the
recovered substance or _ safe
transmission of samples of the
recovered substance was not proved
by the prosecution through
independent evidence, it could not be
concluded that the prosecution had
succeeded in establishing its case
against the accused beyond

reasonable doubt’.

Similar views have also been taken by the apex Court in
2018 SCMR 2039, & 2019 SCMR 903.

10. Record further reveals that the contraband was
recovered on 14.11.2012 whereas the samples were
received in FSL on 16.11.2012 with a considerable delay
of about three days from an unnamed official. The
prosecution could not offer any plausible explanation for

such delay. Reliance is placed on case titled

“‘Tkramullah_ and others Vs the State reported in 2015
SCMR 1002” wherein the Apex Court has held that;

“No such police official was produced before Trial Court to
depose about safe custody of samples entrusted to him for
being deposited in office of Chemical Examiner---
Prosecution was not able to establish that after alleged
recovery of substance so recovered was either kept in safe
custody or that samples were taken from recovered
substance had safely been transmitted to office of Chemical
Examiner without the same being tampered with or
replaced while in transit---Prosecution failed to prove its
case against accused persons beyond reasonable doubt” .

11. Thus, the prosecution has not only miserably
failed to establish the safe custody of the case property,

but also failed to prove the safe transmission of the
7

samples to FSL. In a case where safe custody of the
recovered substance or safe transmission of samples of
the recovered substance was not proved by the
prosecution through independent evidence, it could not
be concluded that the prosecution had succeeded in
establishing its case against the accused beyond
reasonable doubt. Wisdom can be derived from the case
law reported in 2019 SCMR 608.

12. Apart from the above, the vehicle, from which the
alleged recovery was effected, was not produced before
the Court and was not exhibited during trial as,
according to PW-5/complainant that the said motorcar
was in damaged condition and in this regard only a naqal
mad (Ex.PWS5/3) was exhibited, which shows that the
police had malice towards the accused regarding
recovery of the contraband. Its production before the
court was the primary duty of the police in order to bring
home the guilt of the accused. Non-production of the
case property was fatal to the prosecution's case, and the
same had destroyed the very foundation of the case,
which created a dent in the prosecution case causing
serious doubt with regard to the occurrence. Reference is
made to case law reported in 2017 P.Cr.L.J 14.

13. As, the prosecution has brought nothing on record
in respect of any nexus of the appellant with the alleged
contraband as well as vehicle in question, therefore, he

cannot be held responsible for the same. It seems that the
8

prosecution, for saving the neck of actual culprit, has
falsely dragged the present appellant in the instant case.
14. Keeping in view the contradictions on material
points occurred in the statements of PWs and handling of
the contraband as hinted above created doubts in the
prosecution case qua its recovery and safe custody,
which suggests that occurrence has not taken place in the
mode and manner as alleged by the prosecution.

15. The above discussion has led this Court to believe
that the learned trial court has erred in appreciating the
case evidence in its true perspective. It has been held,
time and again by the superior courts, that a slightest
doubt occurs in the prosecution case is sufficient to
acquit an accused. For extending the benefit of doubt, it
is not necessary that there should be many circumstances
creating doubts. Single circumstance, creating
reasonable doubt in the prudent mind about the guilt of
accused, makes him entitled to its benefit, not as a matter
of grace or concession, but as a matter of right. Reliance

could be placed on 2009 SCMR 230, 2011 SCMR 664

2011 SCMR 646, 1984 PLD SC 433, 2012 MLD 1358

2007 SCMR 1825, 2008 P.Cr.L.J_ 376, 1994 PLD

Peshawar 114, 2012 PLD Peshawar 01, 1999 P.Cr.L.J
1087, 1997 SCMR 449, 2011 SCMR 820 & 2006
P.Cr.L.J_ SC 1002. The conclusions drawn by the

learned trial Court are not borne out of the case
9

evidence, therefore, the impugned judgment is not
sustainable.

16. For what has been discussed above and while
extending benefit of doubt to the appellant, instant
appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment is set aside
and the appellant is acquitted of the charge levelled
against him. He be set at liberty forthwith, if not required
to be detained in any other case.

17. As we have allowed the instant appeal, therefore,
the connected criminal appeal (Cr.A No.289-P/2017)
preferred by State, stood meritless, which is dismissed,
accordingly.

18. Above are the reasons of short order of even date.
