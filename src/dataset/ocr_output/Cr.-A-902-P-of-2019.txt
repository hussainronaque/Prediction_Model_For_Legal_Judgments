JUDGMENT

SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.-_Impugned
herein is the judgment dated 08.07.2019
rendered by learned Additional Sessions
Judge/Judge, Model Criminal Trial Court,
Swabi delivered in case FIR No.584
dated 24.07.2012 u/ss 302/34 PPC of
Police Station Yar Hussain District Swabi,
whereby upon conviction u/s 302 (b) PPC,
the appellant has been sentenced to
imprisonment for life with compensation of
Rs.3,00,000/- u/s 544-A Cr.P.C. payable to
the legal heirs of the deceased or in default
whereof to undergo further six months Sl.
Benefit u/s 382-B Cr.P.C. was extended to

him.
2. As per murasila (Ex.PA/1), on
24.07.2012, Said-ul-Abrar Khan, SI upon
receipt of information about the occurrence,
came to casualty ward of Civil Hospital
Yar Hussain, where injured complainant
Ayaz Ali (now dead) in conscious condition
in presence of CMO reported the matter to
him, in terms, that he alongwith his brother
Zulfiqgar (PW) and uncle Naseer Muhammad
(PW5-A) were proceeding to the tobacco
kiln of one Sher Aman, their co-villager. The
accused-appellant Zahir Shah was present
in front of his shop duly armed with pistol
and on sight started firing at them with the
intention to kill as a result he got hit and
sustained injuries whereas his brother
Zulfiqar and uncle Naseer Muhammad
escaped unhurt. Motive behind the
occurrence is stated to be oral altercation
took place between him and Zahir Shah
appellant upon bathing in the mosque. The
occurrence is stated to have been witnessed

by Naseer Muhammad and Zulfigar.

3. Initially, the case was registered
u/s 324 PPC but later on the complainant

Ayaz Ali succumbed to his injuries,
therefore, Section 302 PPC was inserted in

the FIR.

4. After completion of investigation,
challan was submitted in court, which
indicted the appellant for commission of
offence to which he pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. In order to substantiate its
case, the prosecution examined 11
witnesses in all, whereafter statement of
accused was recorded, wherein, he
professed his innocence. On conclusion of
trial, the learned trial court convicted and
sentenced the appellant, as mentioned
above, whereagainst he has filed the instant
appeal whereas Zulfiqar Ali, brother of
deceased, has moved Cr.R.No.180-P of
2019 seeking enhancement of sentence,
therefore, being outcome of same
FIRfudgment are decided through this

single judgment.

5. Learned counsel for the appellant
presented his case before us that the
appellant is innocent and has falsely been
implicated in the instant case, to him the
charge is based on mala fide and the

witnesses are inimical and interested. He
submitted that the deceased then injured
was in precarious position of health and
could not talk, to him the report was not
made by him rather his brother reported. He
went ahead to convince us that the appellant
was charged after consultation by letting the
real culprit scot-free, and the witnesses are
not trustworthy, hence reliance cannot be

placed on them towards capital punishment.

6. Conversely, learned Additionai
Advocate General appearing for the State
assisted by learned counsel for the
complainant has vehemently opposed the
aforesaid contentions and submitted that the
prosecution has proved its case through
independent and _ confidence _ inspiring
witnesses. They further contended that the
prosecution has no animosity to charge the
appellant and that the defence could not
point out any mala fide on part of the
prosecution. They proceeded to say that the
report is prompt and the maker at the time of

report was in full senses.

7. We generously heard the parties and
read the record from cover to cover, The

prosecution case mainly revolves around the
dying declaration of the deceased then
injured and also with the single accused with
long abscondence. The record speaks that it
was on 24.07.2017 at 7.00 PM when the
deceased received firearm injuries while in
the company of Naseer Muhammad
(PW5-A) and Zulfiqar (PW6) within 30
minutes i.e. at 7.30 PM his report was taken
down by Said-ul-Abrar, SI duly attested by
the doctor, in the casualty of Rural Health
Centre Yar Hussain. The main thrust of the
defence arguments was the dying
declaration as to the learned counsel the
bullets landed on the vital organs of the
body and in such eventuality the injured
looses his senses what to say of full
alertness to the time and space. To him, all
was engineered to give an impression that
all was well with the injured at the time of

report.

8. The defence could not persuade us to
believe and accept the picture it painted
rather this court is under legal obligation to
apply its judicial mind to the evidence
available on file. There is no denial to the

fact that the report is prompt in all respects
taken down in presence of the doctor duly
verified by one of the eyewitness and
endorsed by the doctor. The doctor was
thoroughly cross-examined, who explained
that the deceased then injured was
conscious and could talk. The defence was
not contented with the report of the doctor, it
questioned the eyewitness on this particular
aspect of the case where too the reply came
that the deceased then injured was
conscious and oriented in time and space.
The apex court in case of “Niaz-ud-Din and
another Vs. The State and another (2011
SCMR 7285) has held that “Dying declaration
is a weaker type of evidence than the
evidence subjected fo cross-examination,
but conviction can be based on the same, as
such declaration is made in extremity, when
the party is at the point of death, and when
every hope of this world is gone; when every
motive of falsehood is silenced, and the
mind is induced by the most powerful

considerations to speak the truth”.

09. It is pertinent to mention that the
deceased in injured condition was then

referred to Lady Reading Hospital
Peshawar, for further treatment where he
died on 01.08.2012, i.e. he survived for long
seven days. His survival for seven days

alone speaks of his ability to report.

10. The record is silent to tell that what
animosity the prosecution had towards the
appellant, even the defence could not point
out previous ill-will or grudge, which the
witnesses and the deceased were
nourishing against the appellant. We are not
persuaded to hold that the real culprit was
let off and the appellant was trapped, as
substitution is a rare phenomenon, that too,
in the case of single accused. The report
was made within 30 minutes as the injured
was rushed to the hospital, which excludes
every possibility of consultation on the point

of charge.

11. Beside the deceased, two other
eyewitnesses provided the ocular account
and they gave specific reasons for their
presence at the place of occurrence as
according to them they along with the
deceased were proceeding to the tobacco
barn of one Sher Aman. Although the

deceased and eyewitnesses are inter
related but they had no previous enmity or
ill-will against the accused and they could
not be termed as interested witnesses in
absence of any previous enmity. Both
witnesses remained consistent on each and
every material point. Minor discrepancies
were not helpful to the defence because the
appellant absconded and was arrested after
long time and with the passage of time such
discrepancies were bound to occur. In the
case of Khizar Hayat Vs. The State (2011
SCMR 429), the apex court has held that
‘incident was a case of single accused, who
had fired upon the deceased, therefore,
substitution of the culprit was not possible-
such was a rare phenomenon where a
witness whose close relative had been
murdered would substitute the accused with
an innocent person, thereby allowing actual

”

accused to go scot-free........”.

12. The motive was altercation in the
mosque a little early, although the
eyewitnesses were not present in the
mosque and they never said that the
accused and deceased exchanged hot

words in their presence rather it was the
deceased who while making the report

mentioned it.

13. Be that as it may, mere absence of
motive or weakness of motive attributed to
accused would not in any manner adversely
affect the prosecution case, as undoubtedly
motive was a thing which in many of the
cases remained shrouded in mystery, as it
was duly in the mind of the accused, who
had committed crime for that reason. Soon
after the occurrence, the accused/appellant
absconded and it was on 02.02.2016 that he
was arrested. Abscondence of accused,
although by itself was insufficient for
conviction, yet was a strong source of
corroboration for other direct and
circumstantial evidence in the case. The
learned trial court has legally and properly
scrutinized and assessed the evidence
without misreading and non-reading and the
conclusion arrived at by it did not warrant

any interference.

14. As far as Cr.R.No.180-P of 2019 filed
by the petitioner is concerned, since the

motive remained shrouded in mystery, so
10

the sentence awarded is adequate and

warrants no interference.

15.  Resultantly, this appeal and the
connected criminal revision, mentioned

above, being devoid of merit, are hereby

dismissed.
