CONSOLIDATED
JUDGMENT

Date of hearing: 01.12.2020

Present;
Muhammad Yar Malezai, Advocate
for petitioners.

Mr. Fawad Ahmad, Lega! Officer for
NADRA/respondents. :

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq [brahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
WIQAR AHMAD, Ji-. Through this judgment, we
intend to dispose of W.P. No. 1043-M, W.P. No.
1044-M and.W.P. No. 1045-M of 2018. Petitioners in
all the writ petitions have been having a similar case.
National Database & Registration Authority
(hereinafter referred to as “NADRA”) invited
applications for the post of Call Centre/ Customer
Service Executive in O-4 scale (NADRA Special
Scale) from eligible candidates by getting their
proclamation published in daily newspapers on
14.08.2011. Petitioners applied for appointment on
the posts. They participated in the process of
recruitment. The NADRA authorities conducted their
test and interview for the subject posts. In the end,
they were not appointed on the post of Call Centre/
Customer Service Executive in O-4 scale but were
rather appointed as Data Entry Operators for training
purposes vide appointment order dated 10.01.2012.
Petitioners have contended in their petitions that they
accepted the said offer because it had been coupled
with a promise that they would be appointed to the
advertised posts on completion of one month on-job
training after qualifying the review test and interview
which had been promised to be conducted shortly.
They further asserted that even after successful

completion of training and getting qualifying scores

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
in the review test and interview they could not be
appointed to the posts for which they had applied but
were appointed on the same posts of Data Entry
Operator on 23.04.2012. One of their colleague who
had been similarly placed with petitioners in all these
petitions had raised a similar grievance before this
Court by filing his writ petition No. 549-M/2012
which was allowed by this Court through its
judgment dated 28.03.2018. Petitioners have stated
that after knowing about successful outcome of his
similarly placed colleague, they got courage, broke
the shackles of their fear and ventured into filing the

instant constitutional petitions before this Court.

2. Respondents were summoned who filed
their comments, where in Para 2 they have mainly
supplied their defence to the instant constitutional
petitions couched in similar words in all these cases.
Said Para is reproduced from their comments in the
case of “Jawad Khan v/s Chairman NADRA &

others”’:

“That the position of Customer Service Executive for
newly established call Centre at Swat was advertised
in daily newspaper “The Mashriq” on 1g* August
2011, The eligibility criterion for the said post was
Graduation with one-year experience. The petitioner
applied for the post of Customer Service Executive
and short listed for test/interview. During interview,
the board clearly informed all the candidates who
have qualified the test that their initial selection will
be Data Entry operator (“DEO”) on daily wages basis

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
Jor a period of one month for on-job training because
no candidate was found suitable for the position of
Customer Service Executive. Office letter was issued
to the petitioner as DEO on daily wages basis vide No.
NADRA/HR/APP/35/CC/Swat dated 10 January
2012 (Copy enclosed as Annexure-A) in which all
terms & conditions were clearly mentioned regarding
. further selection as Customer Service Executive. The
petitioner accepted the offer letter and joined as DEO
on daily wages basis and the same was not objected by
him at that time. After completion of one month on-
job training as per office letter, all candidates who
have been selected as DEO on daily wages basis were
reviewed through test/interview. In this regard, review
test was held on 20" & 21° February, 2012 at Call
Centre Swat. Candidates whose performance were
outstanding during the training and also qualified the
tesV/interview were selected as Customer Service
Executive in O-4 scale at Call Centre Swat. The
petitioner appeared in review test but due to overall
poor performance during one month on-job training,
the board recommended that Mr. Jawad Khan is not
suitable for the post of Customer Service Executive.
However, instead of terminating his service, he was
posted as DEO on short term basis against
requirement of NADRA Registration Office Malakand
on 23.04.2012 for period of six months. Which has
been executed from time to time based on
Organization requirements.”

3. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of
petitioners started his arguments by submitting that
facts of the instant cases depicts worst kind of
exploitation of the petitioners and that also at the
hands of an authority created and established by the
Federal Government through a Statute, with public
money. He pressed into service the guarantee against
exploitation provided under Articles 3 and 4 of the
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973
(hereinafter referred to as “the Constitution”). In

order to bolster his submissions, he also relied upon

Nawab (D.B.) Hom'ble Mr. Justice Ishting Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
judgments reported as 1995 SCMR 650, 2005 SCMR
100, PLD 2013 Supreme Court 268, 2016 SCMR
1299, 2016 SCMR 2146, 2014 PLC (C.S.) 987, 2017
CLC 1002, 2017 PLC (C.S.) 1270, 2018 PLC (C.S.)
133, 2018 PLC (C.S.) 292, 2019 PLC (C.S.) 1139

and_2019 MLD 87. The learned counsel further
added that petitioners in the cases in hand had been
similarly placed with petitioner of W.P. No. 549-M
of 2012 whose writ petition has been allowed by this
Court, and declining the relief to petitioners would
amount to discrimination. He also relied upon
judgments of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in
the case of “Hameed _Akhtar_Niaz_v/s_The
Secretary Establishment Division, Government of
Pakistan _and_ others” reported as 1996 SCMR
1185 and the case of “Government of Punjab,

through Secretary Education Lahore and others

v/s Sameena Parveen and others” reported as 2009

SCMR 01.

4. Mr. Fawad Ahmad, Legal Officer
appearing and arguing the case on behalf of
NADRA relied upon judgments of Hon’ble Apex
Court reported as 2017 SCMR_ 571, 2017 SCMR
1979 and 2019 SCMR 984 and stated that since

tules of the corporation have not been statutory,

Nawab (D,B,} Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
therefore the petitioners in all these petitions could
not agitate their grievance before this Court which
grievances have been arising out of their services in
the corporation and the instant writ petitions have not
been maintainable. He further added that the writ
petitions were hit by the principle of laches as the
cause of action had admittedly been accrued to
petitioners on 10.01.2012 while they had approached

this Court in the year 2018.

5. We have heard arguments of learned

counsel for the parties and perused the record.

6. It was a strange way in which
petitioners, in all the writ petitions, have been treated
by the recruiting authorities in NADRA. They had
invited applications for the posts of Call
Centre/Customer Service Executive in O-4,
petitioners had applied for the said posts, their test
and interview has admittedly been conducted for the
subject posts. In the end, they have been handed over
an order of appointment as Data Entry Operators in a
grade and scale much below the posts for which they
had applied. It was also understandable that due to
the extraordinary high rate of unemployment the
petitioners would have felt themselves compelled to

accept the offer even if it was much below the post

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
for which they had applied. It is not a hidden truth
that a very high proportion of unemployed youth are
available in Pakistan, unfortunately, while relatively
lesser jobs are available. The ratio become much
worse when it comes to employment in public sector
corporations. People no doubt prefer jobs in public
sector corporations. We are therefore not inclined to
accept the plea of NADRA recruiting authorities that
petitioners had not been found qualified for the
advertised posts, therefore they had been offered
lower posts which had been accepted by them and
that they had been estopped from agitating the said
grievance before this Court. They may have felt
themselves compelled because of their circumstances
to accept the offer but it is very difficult for us to
digest or allow such like treatment to be meted to
petitioners. Job seekers in this country may have been
numerous but each one of them deserves respect
being citizen of the land as well as fair treatment
according to law as it had been their fundamental
rights guaranteed under Article 4 of the Constitution.

Said article reads;

A.4 Right of individuals _to be dealt with_in
accordance with law, _etc.-(1) To enjoy the
protection of law and to be treated in accordance
with law is the inalienable right of every citizen,
wherever he may be and of every other person for
the time being within Pakistan.

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
8

It was in such circumstances that this
Court has allowed writ petition of a similarly placed
petitioner vide its judgment dated 28.03.2018 passed

in W.P. No. 549-M/2012 by observing;

“We are not persuaded with the arguments of
. learned counsel for the respondents, that the
performance of petitioner was poor that he could
not be appointed to the subject post of Call Data
Executive, the conduct of the petitioner also
provides sufficient force to this view as he is
pursuing his remedy from the year 2012 through
the instant writ petition and by now he must have
gained sufficient experience required for the subject
post. Therefore, we feel that the instant writ petition
should be allowed and so respondents are directed
to appoint the petitioner to the post of Call Centre
Executive as advertised through advertisement in
daily newspaper dated 14.08.2011 but from today
and not with retrospective effect. There shall be no
order as to costs.”

Had the petitioners been not found
suitable for the job, they may have been refused and
the seats may have been re-advertised. It is also very
strange to note that among the whole lot of applicants
not a single person was found suitable for the job, in
this age of unemployment where normally a large
number of people apply for jobs whenever
advertised. This is common observation that
whenever jobs are advertised in public sector
corporations, people having more qualification than
the one required, and having more expertise than
needed for the job comes forth and offer their

services. In such a situation this is not believable that

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
the recruiting authorities of NADRA would not have
found even a single person capable of appointment to
the post of Customer Service Executive for simply
running a Call Data Centre in a District. It was not a
post of an astronaut nor was running of Call Data
Centre a rocket science. The plea of respondents is
therefore not found appealable to a reasonable mind.
Article 3 of the Constitution mandates the State
authorities to ensure elimination of all forms of
exploitation and gradual fulfillment of the
fundamental principle, from each according to his
ability, to each according to his work. We do not find
the petitioners to have been treated fairly over the
years and unfair treatment of the petitioners at the
hands of an employer in public sector domain is not
at all acceptable. It has been held by this Court in its
earlier judgment rendered in the case of

“Dr. _Shamsher _Ali_Khan__and_27 others v/s

Government _of Khyber _Pakhtunkhwa _through

Secretary Finance and 2 others” reported as 2019

MLD 87 that when actions of a public body were
found unfair or unreasonable, same can be corrected
by constitutional court on the principle of legitimate
expectation and promissory estoppel. It was further
highlighted in the judgment that the doctrine of

promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation were

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
10

equitable doctrine evolved by the judges while
adjudicating upon the complaints lodged by
aggrieved parties against an unfair and arbitrary
action of the government. Relevant part of the
observations is reproduced hereunder for ready

reference;

“The argument of the learned counsel for the
respondents that writ to the respondent can only be
issued, when the government or for that matter the
respondent institution has taken an action in
disregard of some law, can't be endorsed. It is by
now settled law that the actions of the respondent
while dealing with the people, if are unfair or
unreasonable, can be corrected by the
Constitutional Court on the principles of legitimate
expectations and promissory estoppel. The doctrine
of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation
are equitable doctrine evolved by the Judges while
adjudicating upon the complaint lodged by the
aggrieved party against an unfair and arbitrary
action of the government. It falls in sphere of
neither contract nor statutory estoppel. It can be
said that if the government promises to any person
and the promise is not inconsistent with the law of
the land and not against the public interest, then
afterwards the government cannot refuse to abide by
its promise and in case the government acts
inconsistent with its promise, then the said action of
the government is subject to the judicial review by
the constitutional Court.”

7. The objection of representative of
respondents regarding the instant writ petitions being
barred by principle of laches, cannot be taken to the
effect to deprive the petitioners from a right to which
they had otherwise been entitled. Petitioners were
found to have been similarly placed with petitioner in
W.P. No. 549-M/2012, which have already been

allowed by this Court and we were also informed that

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
11

said judgment had already been implemented by
respondents. When a similarly placed employee would
be working as Customer Service Executive while
petitioners are allowed to continue their job as Data
Entry Operators, they would no doubt get discriminated
and deprived from treatment according to law. Learned
counsel for respondents has additionally been relying
on one of the conditions given in the appointment order
wherein it has been stated that the terms of offer have
been strictly confidential and upon acceptance same
would form the basis of contract with NADRA. His
assertion in this respect is also considerable that the
terms of appointment being dictated to be confidential,
may have resulted in certain apprehensions in the mind
of petitioners that taking the matter to a Court of law

might cause them more harm than benefit.

8. Laches has been relevant in grant or
refusal of discretionary or equitable reliefs and is
considered relevant, but it has never been taken as an
absolute bar, in cases where petitioners were found
entitled to a relief which has already been granted by
Courts of Jaw to similarly placed other petitioner. A six
member Bench of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan

has held in the case of Saddaqat Ali Khan through

LRs and others vs. Collector Land Acquisition

Nawab (D,B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
12

and others reported as PLD 2010 Supreme Court

878, in this respect ;

“And what is further deducible from the
long line of judgments, some of which have
been quoted above, is that once a judicial
determination, be it of a point of fact or of
a point of law, has been made and if sucha
determination covers not only the ones
litigating before the Courts but some
others also, then the dictates of justice
would command that the benefits accruing
from such a determination should not be
restricted only to the litigating parties but
should be extended even to those who had
not indulged in litigation unless there were
some extra-ordinary un-exceptionable
reasons to the contrary and that all
powers, including the powers inherent in
the Courts be invoked for the purpose.
This would not only ensure justice for all
but would also have the effect of
eliminating un-necessary litigation. And
respectfully following these judgments, we
endorse the views expressed therein.”

Further reliance in this respect may be
placed on judgment in the case of Umar Baz Khan
through L.Hrs vs Syed Jehanzeb_ and_others

reported as PLD 2013 Supreme Court 268. In the

case of Hameed Akhtar Niazi vs. The Secretary,
Establishment Division, Government of Pakistan
and others reported as 1996 SCMR 1185, Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan had held that “if the
Service Tribunal or Supreme Court of Pakistan
decides a point of law relating to terms and
conditions of service of a civil servant, which

covers not only the case of civil servant who

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishting Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
13

litigated, but also of other civil servants, who may
have not taken any legal proceedings, in such a
case, the dictates and rule of good governance
demanded that the benefit of such judgment is
extended to other civil servants.” The dictates of
just administration of a public sector corporation
would also require that similar treatment is
extended to petitioners of the instant petitions and
they are given same benefit. Further reliance in this
respect may be placed on judgment of Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of
Government of Punjab, through Secretary
Education, Civil Secretariat, Lahore and others
vs Sameena Parveen and others reported as 2009
SCMR 1. The bar of laches, in such circumstance,
may conveniently be ignored by a constitutional

Court.

9. The other objection of respondents
regarding the fact that the instant constitutional
petitions have not been maintainable due to the reason
that service rules of the petitioners have not yet been
clothed with the attire of statutory rules. It is sufficient
to say that grievances of the petitioners have been
arising from unfair treatment meted to them at the time

of their appointments. Their grievance has not arisen

Nawab (D.B.} Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ishting Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
14

when the rules of NADRA authorities had become
applicable to them. In other words, they have not been
agitating any of the grievance of violation of un-
statutory rules of NADRA. Appointments were made
by NADRA authorities under the powers vested in it by
section 35 of the National Database and Registration
Authority Ordinance, 2000 (hereinafter referred to as
“the Ordinance”). NADRA has been established under
section 3 of the Ordinance. Sub-sections (1), (2) and (3)
of section 3 are relevant in this respect, which are

reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

(1) As soon as may be, but not later than thirty days
after the commencement of this Ordinance, the
Federal Government shall, by notification in the
Official Gazette, establish an Authority to be known
as the National Database and Registration Authority
for carrying out the purposes of this Ordinance.

(2) The Authority shall be a body corporate, with
power to acquire, hold and dispose of property, having
perpetual succession and a common seal and shall by
that name sue and be sued.

(3) The Authority shall consist of a Chairman, also to
be called the Registrar General of Pakistan, and [not
less than] five members to be appointed by the Federal
Government.

The purpose, objects, functions and
powers of the authority have been given in detailed in
section 5 of the Ordinance which leaves no doubt that it
had been performing governmental functions.
Reproduction of sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) of section
5 would also be beneficial for the present discourse,

which are accordingly reproduced hereunder;

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
15

(1) The purpose and objects of the Authority shall be
to formutate and impléiment policies and plans for;

(a) the development and establishment of an
improved and modernized system of registration in the
country through appropriate means including
technologically advanced, effective and efficient
means like computerization, automation, creation of
databases, data warehousing, networking, interfacing
of databases and related facilities and services;

(b) the broadening of the registration base to bring
within its purview all persons and things, wherever
and whatever they may be, to the extent and in the
manner laid down in this Ordinance; and

(c) the establishment and maintenance of multi-
purpose databases, data warehousing, networking,
interfacing of databases and related facilities and
services.

(2) The purposes of developing, establishing or
maintaining a registration or database system may
include facilitation of identification, planning, or any
other purpose permitted by law.

(3) The Authority may take such measures and
exercise such powers and perform such functions as it
considers necessary for carrying out the purposes of
this Ordinance.

The above reproduced section clearly
shows that NADRA has been performing governmental
functions, directly under the authority of the Federal —
Government which is also evident from section 3 of the
Ordinance and thus there has been no doubt that
NADRA has been amenable to the constitutional
jurisdiction of this Court. The question that writ
petition of an employee in respect of violation of non-
statutory rules of NADRA, is not maintainable is a
different question altogether. If grievance of an
employee arose out of any adverse order passed against

him during his service, under the un-statutory rules, a

Nawab (D.B.} Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
16

writ petition before a High Court would no doubt be
non-maintainable according to ratios of judgments in
the case of “Chairman NADRA Islamabad through
Chairman and another v/s Muhammad Ali Shah and
others” reported as 2017 SCMR_1979 as well as in the
case of “Maj. (Retd.) Syed Muhammad _Tanveer
Abbas_and_ another _v/s_Federation _of Pakistan
through Secretary, Ministry of Interior and another”

reported as 2019 SCMR_ 984, but as stated earlier
grievances of the petitioners have not been arising
out of violation of the un-statutory rules but their
very appointments in NADRA. Any assailed action
of NADRA authorities at the time of appointments
would no doubt be amenable to constitutional
jurisdiction of this Court, for the reason that NADRA
has itself been amenable to constitutional jurisdiction
of this Court. In. the case of “Pakistan
Telecommunication Co. LTD Through Chairman

ws _ Iqbal Nasir” reported as “PLD 2011 Supreme

Court 132”, Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has
expressly held that PTCL had been amenable to writ
jurisdiction of the High Court but writ petition of an
employee arising out of violation of non-statutory
rules would not be maintainable. The distinction
between the two questions is necessary for the

purpose of instant adjudication. Since grievances of

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
yD
‘yw WP
ais

17

the petitioners in the instant constitutional petitions
have not been arising out of violation of any service
rules of NADRA, but has been. arising out of their
first appointment in NADRA, facts of these cases
would therefore be distinguishable from facts of
cases of the private parties in the judgments reported

as 2017 SCMR 1979 and 2019 SCMR 984.

10. In light of what has been discussed
above, we allow the instant writ petitions and direct
the respondents to treat petitioners of these connected
matters similar to petitioner of W.P. No. 549-M of
2012. All the petitioners shall be appointed to the
posts Call Centre/Customer Service Executive with
effect from the date from which said petitioner has
been ordered to be given the post of Customer
Service Executive. They shall squarely be placed
equal to him in all respects and shall not be

discriminated in any manner.
