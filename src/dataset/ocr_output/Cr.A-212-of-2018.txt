2. According to MurasialalF LR lodged

on the report of complainant Gul Sangeen (PW-2)

{0.8) — Hon’ble Mr. fustice Ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon’bie Mr. justice Wigac Ahmad
Tojamuyes*|

ode
on 25.09.2013 at 15:00 hours; on the same day he
alongwith his nephew Naik Amal and Kifayat Ullah
(PW-3) were present in the barren land known as
Bakaro for collecting grass. At 12:30 hours the
present appellant came there and questioned Naik
Amal for cutting his grass. An altercation developed
during which the present appellant drew out dagger
(vas Uy) from his trouser-fold and stabbed Naik
Amal on his chest as result whereof he fell on the
ground and died. PW Kifyat Ullah tried to
overpower the appellant, however, he also caused
stab injury on his right arm. The complainant,
however, did not get closer to the appellant because
of fear. The appellant decamped from the spot to the
mountain waiving the dagger. According to the
complainant, the occurrence took place on the
motive of land dispute which was witnessed by him,
the injured Kifayat Ullah (PW-3) and Bacha Zarin
(not produced). The complainant also charged
acquitted co-accused Kamal and Haroon Taj for

abetting the offence.

3. After reducing the report of

complainant into Murasila (Ex.PB), S.H.O

{D.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice tshtlag Ibrahim
Muhammad Zaman (PW-10) prepared the inquest
report (Ex.PW-12/ 1) and injury sheet (Ex.PW-12/2)
and sent’ the dead body to Civil Hospital Puran for
medical examination. Since, injured Kifayat Ullah
had already proceeded to Civil Hospital Puran for
medical treatment, therefore, P.S Aloch was
informed for preparation of his injury sheet. The
dead body was examined by Dr. Shaukat (PW-8).

The gist of his report Ex.PM is as under:

Detail of External Examination:

A stab wound on about 1 cm in size in the
right 5" intercostal space just lateral to the
sternum. A hole was present in the shirt,
corresponding to the wound and the front of
shirt was stained with blood. When the wound
was probed, it was penetrating the chest wall
and extended deeply into the chest cavity and
chest cavity was full of blood.

Opinion:

Nature of injury: Fatal.
Weapon used: Sharp
Probable Duration: 2-6 hours.

Cause_of Death: Fatal injury to the vital
organs in the chest and heavy bleeding from
the thoracic vessel.

Similarly, the injured PW Kifayat Ullah
(PW-3) was medically examined by Dr. Zia-ud-Din

(PW-9) whose report Ex.PW-9/1 is as follows:

Stab wound on right forearm lateral and
middle aspect size approximately 3 cm in
length, edges regular, depth proximately 7 cm.
Bone not exposed.

4. The appellant remained absconder
whereas his co-accused were arrested, therefore,
challan u/s $12, Cr.P.C was put in Court against the
appellant and his co-accused were tried for the
offence, however, they were acquitted of the charge

u/s 265-K, Cr.P.C on 27.05.2015.

5. After arrest of the appellant/convict on
23.07.2016, he made pointation of the place of
occurrence and weapon of offence i.e churri was
recovered on his pointation consequent upon which
section 15 A.A was added in the case.
Supplementary challan was submitted before the
Court for his trial after completion of investigation.
He was formally indicted for the offences w/s
302/324 P.P.C read with section 15 A.A on
09.02.2016 to which he did not plead guilty and
opted to face the trial. Prosecution produced 12
witnesses in support of its case against the appellant.
When examined ws 324, Cr.P.C, the appellant
denied the allegations and claimed to be innocent,
however, he neither produced any witness in his
defence nor opted to be examined on oath in terms

of section 340 (2), Cr.P.C. During the course of

(0.6) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
-6-
arguments before the trial Court, it surfaced that the
appellant was not charge sheeted for the injury he
had caused to injured Kifiyat Ullah, thus, the charge
was altered and the appellant was also charge
sheeted u/s 337-F(iii), P.P.C. He refused to call the
PWs for re-examination or further cross-examination
when specifically asked in this regard by trial Court.
On conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court vide
impugned judgment convicted and sentenced the
appellant in the manner already mentioned in the

earlier part of this judgment, hence, this appeal.

6. We have heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the parties including the learned A.A.G.
for State and gone through the record with their able

assistance.

Zz. It is the case of prosecution against the
present appellant that he committed murder of Naik

Amal and attempted at the life of PW Kifayat Ullah

by causing to them stab injures on 25.09.2013 at

Tajamuyes*|

12:30 hours in the barren land/warsho known as
Bakaro within the area of Shatai at a distance of
24/25 kilometers from P.S Aloch. The place of

occurrence is established in view of the site plan

(0.6) Hon’ble Mr, Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim
Talamul/Ps* |

-7-

Ex.PB/I, recovery of blood from the spot through
recovery memo Ex.PW-4/2 as well ocular account
given by complainant Gul Sangeen (PW-2) and

injured Kifayat Ullah (PW-3).

8. The important evidence which is
available on the record against the appellant is in
shape of ocular account of the aforesaid witnesses
duly corroborated by circumstantial evidence on the
record. Complainant Gul Sangeen appeared before
the Court as PW-2 and stated that he was present
with the deceased and other eye witnesses Kifayat
Ullah and Bacha Zarin for collecting grass in the
land of deceased when the present appellant
approached to the spot and thereafter caused stab
injuries to deceased and injured during altercation.
He verified his report by reiterating the contents
thereof in his examination-in-chief and also
confirmed that he led the I.0 to spot alongwith the
injured PW and made pointation of the place of
occurrence in light of which ‘the site plan was
prepared. During cross-examination, this witness has
narrated in detail the mode and manner as well as

the purpose of his departure to the place of

(0.8) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ishtlag (brahim
Tajamut/Ps*

-8-

occurrence in the company of deceased and other
eye witnesses. He also confirmed that he was at a
distance of 100/120 feet from the deceased when the
appellant came closer to him. The statement of the
complainant, being straight forward and truthful
besides corroborated by other PWs and
circumstantial evidence, inspires confidence
therefore, there is no doubt regarding his presence
on the spot at the time of occurrence. His testimony
cannot be discarded on the sole ground that he was
related to deceased. It was observed by august
Supreme Court in the case of Zafar Igbal and other

Vs. The State (2014 SCMR 1227) that:

Mere relationship of prosecution witnesses
with deceased cannot render their evidence
unreliable unless it is established that they had
motive to implicate accused falsely.

9. The other eye witness of the occurrence

is Kifayat Ullah (PW-3) who also carries the stamp

of injury on his person in the same occurrence. This

witness was trying to apprehend the appellant after

he had given a dagger blow to the deceased. During

the struggle the appellant also hit him with a blow of

(0.6) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hontble Mr Justice Winer Ahmad
TafamuyPs+|

-9-
dagger causing injury on his forearm. He confirmed

in his cross-examination that:

On the eventful day along with Sangeen, Bacha
Zarin and Naik Amal Khan (deceased then alive)
proceeded to the spot from their own houses
whereas I joined them from my house and we all
proceeded to the spot....... I, Shah Rawan and
Naik Amal Khan were standing side by side at the
distance of two feet from each other. The
altercation started due to cutting of grass and
Shah Rawan told the deceased that why he cut his
grass. In response the deceased told the accused
that he has cut his own grass......... At the
moment of altercation I tried to patch up the
matter but no sooner the accused hit the deceased
and thereafter stabbed me through churri.

The statement recorded by the injured
PW as well as the stamp of injury on his person
clearly proves his presence on the spot. Learned
counsel for the appellant has objected the testimony
of this witness mainly on the ground that he has not
lodged the report himself in the hospital, however,
we do not tend to agree with the learned counsel on
the ground that this witness has no relationship with
the deceased nor having any venom against the
appellant, therefore, he can be regarded as the most
reliable and credible witness. Being injured, the
injured witness had gone to Civil hospital Puran
where the IO (PW-12) recorded his cursory
statement after preparing his injury sheet. In this

regard the 1.0 stated in his cross-examination that:

Se (CRF Se pst heel

BL F Ek Bad Sg beg SIP at
Since, the S.H.O had already left for the
place of occurrence at the time of recording the
statement of the injured PW in hospital, therefore, in
such like circumstances to discredit the testimony of
the injured PW only on the ground that he did not
lodge the repot, would not be in consonance with
principles for appraisal of evidence. It is a case of
single accused and the injured eye witness has
sustained stab injury at the hand of the present
appellant, therefore, substitution of the appellant
that’s too in the case of stabbing from a short
distance was not possible and could be possible only
in cases of firearm injuries. His statement being
worth credence and reliable can be classified in the
first category of the ocular account as mentioned by
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of
“Muhammad _Igbal_and_ others V/s. Muhammad
Akram and another”. (1996 SCMR 908) according

to which:-

(D.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice (shtlaq Ibrahim.
Ir
Tapmut/Pss|

-ll-

“Ocular evidence may be classified into three
categories; firstly, wholly reliable; secondly,
wholly unreliable; and thirdly, partly reliable
and partly unreliable. In the first category,
conviction may safely be sustained on
uncorroborated testimony. In the second
category, even strongest corroborative
evidence may not rehabilitate such evidence. In
the third category conviction cannot be
recorded unless such evidence is corroborated
by oral or circumstantial evidence coming
from distinct sources. We are of the view that
the testimony of the eye-witness in the present
case falls within first category, they are
absolutely dependable witnesses and for the
safe administration of justice in criminal cases,
conviction can safely be recorded on their
statements without further corroboration”.

8. The prosecution case gets adequate
corroboration from medical evidence. According to
medical report of the deceased (Ex.PM), Dr. Shaukat
(PW-8) found a stab injury with sharp object on the
body of deceased which extended deeply to the chest
cavity. He mentioned the cause of death as fatal
injuries to vital organs in the chest and heavy
bleeding from the thoracic vessels. Likewise, the
injured witness Kifayat Ullah (PW-3) was examined
by Dr. Zia-ud-Din (PW-9) who in his report Ex.PW-
9/1 recorded a stab wound of 3 cm on right forearm
of the injured PW. Similarly, the contents of initial

report are in consonance with the ocular account,

medical evidence and site plan.

9. Learned counsel for the appellant

during his arguments attacked the investigation by

(0.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ithtiag tbrahim
-12-
‘stating that the investigation conducted in the
present case is against the law and relevant
procedure. Mistakes on the part of Investigating
Officer, no doubt, cannot be excluded, however, the
rule laid down in this regard by superior Courts is
that it must be proved that any irregular act or
omission of the investigating agency has caused
miscarriage of justice to accused. In the present case
no fault of conspicuous nature could be found in the
entire investigation proceedings to have prejudiced
the present appellant in any manner, therefore, the
objection of learned counsel for the appellant is
repelled. Reliance is placed on Muhammad Ashraf
Khan _Tareen Vs. The State (1995 PCr.LJ 313

Peshawar) wherein it was ruled down that:

We went through the judgment cited by
either side and found in almost all of them a
common feature that any defect, irregularity
or even illegality in the investigation would
not vitiate the trial unless it is shown that it
has prejudiced the accused in any manner
and similarly no objection regarding any
flaw in the investigation or trial can prevail
at appellate or revisional stage unless it is
proved that it has brought about a
miscarriage of justice or it has occasioned
failure of justice.

10. Learned counsel for the appellant also

objected the time of death in view of medical

Tajrmuyes*| {D.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice tshtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr, Justice Winar Ahmad
~<?

-13-

evidence and the time of lodging the report.
According to prosecution version, the occurrence
took place on 25.09.2013 at 12:30 hours and the
deceased was examined in hospital at Puran on the
same date at 06:00 P.M. The doctor has mentioned
the duration as 2-6 hours which is in line with the
time of occurrence as mentioned in Murasila. Even
otherwise, the time mentioned by doctor in medico-
legal report was speculative and was based on his
personal observations, therefore, such error being
not conclusive cannot impeach the ocular account.
Reliance is placed on Haji and 4 others Vs. The
State (1972 PCr.LJ 465 Karachi). It was held in he said
judgment that:

But we are not impressed with this argument

as the time of death given by the doctor is

only conjectural and where can be possibility

of a greater error as such we are of the

opinion that the time given by the doctor

would not be conclusive on this point. For

these reasons then we find that the ocular
testimony is reliable and worthy of credence.

il. Regarding the delay in lodging the
report, no doubt, the report was lodged with delay of
2 % hours, however, the record shows that the crime
scene is situated in mountainous area at a distance of
24/25 kilometres from the police station. It is also in

the statements of the eye witnesses that the dead

Tepmuyes*| (0.82) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
-14-

body was first brought from the spot to the house of
deceased in one hour whereafter the police came to
the house of deceased and the said journey of 24/25
kilometres must have consumed time, therefore, the
delay -is well explained in view of the

aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case.

12, The complainant, while disclosing the
motive, stated in his report that the occurrence had
taken place due to land dispute. According to the
report and statements of the eye witnesses, the
present appellant on his arrival to the spot first
inquired the deceased that why he had cut his grass
and thereafter he stabbed him during the altercation
which had developed between the parties on the
same issue. In response to a question by defence
counsel, the injured eye witness (PW-3) stated in his

cross-examination that:

It is correct that there was a dispute between
accused Shah Rawan and deceased Naik Amal on
the boundaries of landed property.

Thus, the motive set up in the present

case has also been established in the present case.

13. In addition, the appellant also remained
fugitive from law for almost three years and he has

offered no plausible explanation in this regard. Thus,

Tafamuyes+| {0.6} Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtieq brahim
, Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-15-

the said conduct of the appellant further corroborates
the ocular account and can be considered as
corroborative factor of other convincing evidence
available on record against the appellant. Reliance is

placed on Qaisar Khan and others Vs. The State and
others (2009 SCMR 471) wherein it was held that:

No doubt abscondence by itself is not

sufficient to convict an accused person but is

strong piece of corroborative evidence of the

other direct and circumstantial evidence in

the case. When an accused persons remains

fugitive from the law for long time without

any plausible and reasonable explanation,

then his conduct after the occurrence

becomes indicative of his guilt when it is

considered in conjunction with the ocular

and circumstantial evidence
14, In light of the foregoing discussion, the
prosecution has proved its case against the appellant
through trustworthy and reliable evidence, therefore,
his conviction and sentence by the learned trial
Court does not call for any interference. As regards
the quantum of sentence as agitated in the connected
revision petition, though there was a land dispute
between the appellant and deceased, however, the
facts and circumstances of the case suggests sudden
fight between the parties over the issue of cutting of

grass during which the appellant caused single stab

injuries to deceased and injured. Thus, the award of

Tajamuyess|

(0.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice tshtlag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiosr Ahmad
-16-
life imprisonment to appellant by trial Court is
proper and just in the circumstances of the case.
Resultantly, this appeal as well as the connected:

Cr.R No. 48-M/2018, being devoid of merits, are

accordingly dismissed.
