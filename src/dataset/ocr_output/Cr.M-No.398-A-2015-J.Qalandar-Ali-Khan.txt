Meanwhile, the accused/petitioner was
proceeded against under sections 204 and 87
Cr.P.C. and challan was submitted against him
under section 512 Cr.P.C. The ad-interim pre-
arrest bail of the accused/petitioner was
cancelled/ recalled on 28.10.2013, wh:.reafter
supplementary challan was submitted against
him, and he was jointly charged in the case
alongwith other co-accused by the learned trial
Court / Additional Sessions  Judge-VIl,
Abbottabad on 03.01.2014. In pursuance of
report of Standing Medical Board, showing the
age of accused/petitioner as 19-20 years, thus
less than 18 years at the time of occurrence, the
police / prosecution was directed to submit
challan against him under Juvenile Justice
System Ordinance.

3. Arguments of learned counsel ‘or the
accused/petitioner, learned Assistant Acivocate

General assisted by the learned counsel for the

complainant/respondent No.2 heard, and
record perused.

“ Qazi Shams-ud-Din, Advocate, learned
counsel for the accused/ petitioner, vehi:mently
argued that while allegedly present at a lower
level than the deceased at a distance of 42 ‘feet’
(presumed ‘feet’ as neither ‘fect’ no~ ‘yard’
recorded in the site plan), pellets of +2 bore
shotgun could not be imagined to have caused
4-2 cm injuries on the deceased, that ivo,with
corresponding exit wounds on hard paris of the
body. The learned counsel pointed out that
report about the occurrence, which a'legedly
took place at Deegar Waila, was lodgi:d with
considerable delay at 18.10 hours. The learned
counsel also pointed out that statements of the
two eyewitnesses mentioned in the FIR namely
Khawar Shahzad and Sardar Waqas Ahmad
were recorded twice by the 1.0 with different

versions given by the said two so-called

eyewitnesses in their statements cn two

different occasions. In support «of his
arguments, particularly age of the accused /
petitioner, the learned counsel for the
accused/petitioner placed reliance — on
judgments reported as 2009 P.Cr.L.J 47, PLD
2009 Lahore 535, 1970 SCMR 30,2008 YER
4751 and PLD 2003 Karachi 60.

5. During his arguments, learned counsel for
the complainant/respondent No.2, Mr. fazal-i-
Haq Abbasi, was particularly critical about the
conduct of the accused/ petitioener by pointing
out that after remaining fugitive from ‘aw for
more than five months, the only object of the
accused/petitioner has been to delay irial by
frequently moving successive applications and
taking inconsistent pleas, as in his initial
application for bail alongwith other co-accused,
he simply mentioned that he was a college
student and sending him to jail would damage
his educational career, which proved otherwise

pe True COPY
i when he secured even better position when he

appeared in the examination from jail. The
learned counsel also pointed out that the plea
of a juvenile offender was intention:y not
raised in the initial bail petition so as to srolong
the agony of the complainant party by celaying
irial. The learned counsel placed on record
Detailed Marks Certificate of Class-x of the
accused /petitioner showing his date of oirth as
84 February, 1995, which showed him of more
than 18 years of age at the time of occirrence.
According to the learned counsel, the
subsequent attempts on the part of the
accused /petitioner to show his age less “han 18
years at the time of occurrence were mec with
the twin objects of delaying trial on the one
hand and securing bail under the /uvenile
justice System Ordinacne rough
misrepresentation on the other. The iearned
counsel maintained that direct charge in the
FIR, P.M and medico-legal reports, rece very of

pellecs, crime empties and weapon of offence

ie. 12 bore shot’ gun from the
accused/petitioner, his  absconsio: for
considerable time and statements of the
eyewitnesses would go a long way to connect
the accused/petitioner with the commission of
the offences which claimed two lives and
caused injuries to two others, disentitling the
accused/petitioner to the concession of bail in
the light of judgments reported as 2013
-\ p.cr.L.jJ 1105, 2002 SCMR 1842, 2013 P.Cr.L.J
675, 2012 SCMR 556, PLD 1994 SC 65, PLD
2006 Peshawar 5, 2015 P.Cr.L.j 1321, PLD
2014 Peshawar 127, 2002 SCMR 1836 and
2007 P.Cr.L.J 1004.
6. Apart from material available on record,
prima facie, connecting the accused/pctitioner
with the commission of the offence, such as his
direct charge in the FIR for an offence felling in
the prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C,

supported by medical/PM report, recoveries

weapon of offence from the accused-petitioner,,
yositive reports of Chemical Examiner and
Mjrearms Expert, his absconsion for
considerable period and, above all, his conduct
of changing his stance before the Courts with
regard to his age, the commencement of trial in
the case, but delayed due to incessant
applications of the accused/petitioner, should
nevertheless serve as restraining factor, lest
discussion on merits of the case tend to
prejudice case of either of the parties.
7. Besides, the accused/petitioner had
earlier approached this Court for post arrast
pail on almost the same grounds, which was
dismissed as withdrawn vide order/judgment
dated 02.03.2015, but only after the following
observations were made by the Hon'ble udge:-
“True that while
interpreting criminal
statutes, every endeavour is
to be made to resolve:

consequences of anarchy

and chaos confronting the

country due to lawlessness.

Such exercise cannot be

undertaken, in disregard of

very object of putting in

place the penal laws, lest i:

may defeat their purpose.”
8. Needless to say that the questions raised
during arguments by the learned cou::sel for
the accused/petitioner with regard to certain
facts relate to deep appreciation of evidence
and merits of the case which are, admittedly,
hot warranted at the bail stage; while, on the
other hand, tentative assessment of the
material on record tilt the case towards refusal
of bail to the accused/petitioner at this stage
when trial has already commenced, bu¢ so far
delayed only due to successive applications for
bail moved by the accused/petitioner and other
co-accused. Therefore, while declining bail to

the accused/petitioner, the application for his

post arrest bail is dismissed, with direction to

12

5 the learned trial Court to strive for expeditious
disposal of the case by discouraging
unnecessary adjournments and attempts on the
part of either of the parties to cause delay in

conclusion of trial.
