SAHIBZADA_ ASADULLAH __,_J.- Muhammad

Naseer, the appellant/convict through present criminal

appeal preferred under section 410 Cr.P.C has

challenged the validity of judgment dated 14.05.2019,

passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-I,

Judge MCTC, Karak, whereby he was convicted and

sentenced in case FIR No. 511 dated 06-10-2013,

*Azam/P.S* (D.B) MS, Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
under section 302/324/34 PPC, registered at Police

station Latamber, district Karak, the detail whereof is

as under:-

ii.

iii.

U/S 302(b) PPC, he was convicted
and sentenced to life imprisonment
with compensation of Rs.50,000
(rupees fifty thousand) payable to the
legal heirs of the deceased as
provided U/S 544-A Cr.P.C, or to
undergo further six months SJ

indefault whereof.

U/S 324 P.P.C he has also been
convicted for attempting at the life of
complainant namely Mujeeb-ur-
Rehman by making firing at him
ineffectively and sentenced to suffer
imprisonment for two years with fine
of Rs.5,000/- or to undergo further

one month S.I indefault whereof.

Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C has
also been extended to the convict/

appellant.

According to the prosecution version as

disclosed in the F.I.R, that it was on 06-10-2013 at

1100 hours, when the complainant Mujeeb-ur-Rehman

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
reported the matter to the local police on the spot to the
effect that on the eventful day, he alongwith deceased
brother Sadeeq-ur-Rehman had come to their land,
situated in village Tatter Khel and after spending some
time, they were coming back to their home, when at
about 10.15 hours, accused/ appellant Naseer Khan
armed with Kalashnikov while co-accused Shabir-ur-
Rehman, duly armed with .30 bore pistol, riding on
their motor cycle, reached there at the place of
occurrence and asked them that why he (complainant)
and his deceased brother had come to the land and
thereafter both of them started firing upon Sadeeq-ur-
Rehman with the intention to commit his qatl-i-amd,
resultantly he was hit and died on the spot; that
thereafter the accused also made firing at complainant
but he luckily escaped unhurt; that the motive was
stated to be the dispute over landed property. The
report was taken down into Murasila (Ex:PA) by

Raham Dad HC (Rtd) (PW-1), who also prepared

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
injury sheet and inquest report (Ex.PW 1/1 & Ex.PW

1/2). Thereafter he sent the dead body for autopsy to

the doctor under the escort of constable Raham Niaz

No.1462, while murasila was sent to the Police station

through constable Zia Ullah, the contents of which

were incorporated into F.I.R (Ex:PA/1) by Rasool

Muhammad SI (Rtd) (PW-6). And handed over copy

of the same to Mumtaz Khan SI CTD Kohat (PW-07),

for conducting investigation in the instant case.

3. After completion of investigation by

Mutmaz Khan SI CTD Kohat (PW-07), complete

challan was submitted before the trial court against

both the accused named above. On arrest of

appellant/accused, supplementary challan was

submitted in the trial court. He was summoned from

District Jail, Karak. After fulfillment of codal

formalities U/S 265-C Cr.P.C, he was charge sheeted

and the trial commenced against the accused.

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullab.
4. In order to prove its case, prosecution
examined as many as (9) witnesses, while the
statement of Israr PW-09, recorded in earlier trial of
co-accused was transposed. After closure of the
prosecution evidence, statement of appellant/ accused
Muhammad Naseer was recorded under section 342
Cr.P.C, wherein he professed his innocence. He neither
wished to be examined on oath, as required under
section 340 (2)Cr.P.C. nor opted to produce defence
evidence. After hearing the prosecutor and defence,
learned trial court convicted and sentenced appellant/
accused, vide the impugned judgment, hence the
instant appeal.

5. We have considered the submissions of
learned counsel for the parties, AAG for the state and
gone through the record of the case.

6. The complainant reported the matter to
the local police at 11.00 a.m on 06-10-2013 regarding

the murder of his brother Sadeeq-ur-Rehman which

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
ul

was taken down vide murasila (Ex.PA). The report
shows that the complainant in the company of the
deceased had come to the fields belonging to his uncle
who was settled in Canada. It was 10:15 am when
they after taking tea in the adjoining baitak of one Mir
Wali came out to leave for their village when the
accused/appellant with his brother Shabir-ur-Rehman
came on motor cycle duly armed, they first warned
them of their coming to the spot fields and then fired
with their respective weapons on targeting both the
deceased and complainant. The complainant was
examined as PW-9, wherein he stated that they had
started for village when the incident occurred but the
distance between point No.l where he was shown
present and point No.2 where the deceased shown
present is shown 47 paces which confirms that the
complainant was not accompanying the deceased at the
relevant time. The complainant stated that he was also

fired at but escaped unhurt, had he been present being

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
empty handed he too was at the mercy of the assailants
and they would have easily done away with him. In
case titled “Zahir Shah Vs_the State” (2019 MED
1562), wherein it is held that:

“Admittedly, the deceased
along with PW-1 to PW-3 were
standing closely and after
making indiscriminate firing
there were no chances of PWs
to escape unhurt and also
there was every possibility that
the deceased had _ received
multiple bullet injuries, but
the picture is quite different
from the presumptions and
expectations as suggests by the
situation, when the deceased
had only received two bullet
injuries on his person, while
all the PWs were escaped
unhurt.”

7. The spot is lying on the metal road and
the scribe confirmed the inter-se link between police
post Ahmad Abad and the spot through a metal road.
The occurrence occurred at 10:15 am but no effort

was made to shift the deceased to the Police station

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
and to report the matter there, rather the body was

lying on the spot when a private person namely Ilyas

Khan contacted the scribe on his cell phone who

reached to the sot at 11.00 a.m, when the villagers and

relatives had already arrived and the vehicles were

available on the spot, had the complainant been present

with the deceased at the time of firing, he would have

either shifted the dead body to the police station or to

the hospital, but infact the complainant was in the

village and was informed there, where from he in the

company of his relatives reached to the spot within 30

minutes. We are still struggling to know that who was

Ilyas, who informed the police and that why his

statement was not recorded? The complainant stated

that soon after the occurrence Cot was arranged and

the dead body was shifted to the baitak of one Mirwali,

we are surprised that why the “Cot” was shifted to the

baitak, rather it should have been shifted to the police

station for report, but this stance was openly

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
contradicted by other witnesses, icc PW-1 Raham Dad,
who is the scribe, stated that when he reached to the
spot, the dead body was lying in the field and PW.9
Israr, who escorted the dead body to the hospital,
stated that when they reached, the dead body was lying
on the ground. The complainant further stated that he
did not accompany the dead body to the hospital,
rather preferred to stay on the spot with PW-1, the
conduct of the witness is not natural and badly failed to
convince us, as his first priority would be to
accompany the dead body to the hospital, rather than to
stay in the adjoining baithak for hours. We are again
surprised that what the scribe was doing on the spot for
two/three hours, as by then the I.O had not reached and
no further investigation could be conducted by him as
being Head constable, was not authorized and it was
then, when the Investigating officer arrived at 1.30 p.m
to the spot, who then effected the recoveries and

prepared the site plan. Infact the attitude of the

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-10-

witnesses is not only abnormal, rather an attempt was
made to cover the delay on one side and to make the
presence of the complainant/believable on the other,
but they failed to convince and we can safely hold that
the witness was interested and procured and that the

F.LR was registered after preliminary investigation. In

case titled “Muhammad Ashraf alias Acchu Vs_the

State” (2019 SCMR 652), wherein it is held that:

“It is well settled that benefit of
slightest doubt must go to an
accused and in a case where
the Court reaches a conclusion
that eye-witnesses were chance
witnesses; they had _ not
witnessed the occurrence and
the prosecution story is
concocted by the PWs, then the
case of the accused merits plain

acquittal.”

8. The presence of the witness is not free

from doubt, as the complainant had no personal

property but it was the property of their uncle who was

residing in Canada and that the accused were their first

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-ll-

cousins, the complainant could not show the purpose
of his presence and coming to the fields. Even the
accused had got nothing on the spot, neither the
complainant was ploughing or sowing the field or were
in possession of the same which annoyed the accused
to a degree to kill the deceased. Had the complainant
been present and the accused had the intention to kill
them, no hurdle was there to stop them from killing the
complainant as well. Infact the prosecution is
travelling with the weakest motive, though this motive
was alleged but nothing was brought forwarded to
prove the same. In case titled “Noor Muhammad Vs
the State another” (2010 SCMR 97), wherein it is held
that:

“It appears that the prosecution has
abandoned the motive. In_ these
circumstances, solitary statement of
the complainant without any
supporting evidence and particularly’
when the incident occurred on 20-9-
1995 did not take place in his
presence is very unsafe to be relied

upon. Thus, the prosecution has

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-12-

failed to prove the motive. It has
been held in the case of Muhammad
Sadiq v. Muhammad Sarwar 1979
SCMR 214 that when motive is
alleged but not proved then the
ocular evidence required to be
scrutinized with great caution. In the
case of Hakim Ali v. The State 1971
SCMR 432 it has been held that the
prosecution though not called upon
to establish motive in every case, yet
once it has set up a motive and failed
to establish it, the prosecution must
suffer consequence and not the
defence. In the case of Ameenullah
v. State PLD 1976 SC 629 it has been
held that where motive is an
important constituent and is found
by the Court to be untrue, the Court,
Should be on guard to accept
prosecution story.”

9. The place of occurrence is surrounded by
fields but no farmer from the adjoining lands was
made a witness. Mirwali Khan who was an important
witness though was examined U/S 161 Cr.P.C but he
did not turn up to record his statement during the trial
as he was the witness who could say that the

complainant had come in the company of the accused

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-13-

and who could better explain that who shifted the dead
body of the deceased to his baitak but he avoided to
appear mainly for the reason that he was not ready to
support false charge of the complainant and _ his
nonproduction leads to a negative inference against the
prosecution. In case titled, “Riaz Ahmad Vs the State”
(2010 SCMR 846), wherein it is held that:

“One of the  eye-witnesses
Manzoor Hussain was available in
the Court on 29-7-2002 but the
prosecution did not examine him,
declaring him as unnecessary
witness without realizing the fact
that he was the most important,
only serving witness, being an eye-
witness of the occurrence.
Therefore, his evidence was the
best piece of the evidence, which
the prosecution could have relied
upon for proving the case but for
the reasons best known, his
evidence was withheld and he was
not examined. So a presumption
under Illustration (g) of Article
129 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984 can fairly be drawn that had

the eye-witness Manzoor Hussain

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah,
-14-

been examined in the Court his
evidence would have been
unfavourable to the prosecution.”

10. The ocular account is in conflict with the
medical evidence. The deceased was facing the
accused the seat of injuries and the place of the
deceased do not support the stance of the complainant
as one injury was from front to back but the others
were from left to right. The doctor has given the time
between death and postmortem as 3 to 4 hours which
takes the time of death earlier than the one noted. The
dead body was identified by the relative and co-
villagers, i.e before the police and before the doctor at
the time of post mortem examination, had the
complainant been present at the spot, he would have at
least identified the deceased before the police as the
Inquest report was already prepared on the spot. This
being so, we cannot hold otherwise but that it was a
blind murder. In case titled “Nasir Ali and others Vs

Sajjad Hussain and others (PLD 2006 Supreme

Court 560), wherein it is held that:

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-15-

“The learned High Court had
given finding of fact against the
petitioner after proper
appreciation of evidence with
ocular testimony directly in
conflict with medical evidence. It
is a settled A principle of law that
in case of conflict between the
ocular and medical evidence, then
medical evidence is to be
preferred. See Bagh Ali's case
(1983 SCMR 1292) and
Muhammad Aslam's case (1969
SCMR 462). It is pertinent to
mention here that statement of
eye-witnesses in respect of nature
and seat of injuries could not
connect the respondents as their
statements are not inconsonance
with medical evidence and this
finding was duly considered/noted
by the High Court after re-
appraisal of eye-witnesses and the
medical evidence in minutely.”

11. The learned counsel for the appellant

vehemently argued that the appellant remained

absconder for sufficient long time, but mere

absconscion of accused is not conclusive guilt of an

accused person; it is only a suspicious circumstance

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
against an accused that he was found guilty of the
offence. However, suspicions after all are suspicions,
the same cannot take the place of proof, the value of
absconcion, therefore, depends on the facts of each
case. In case titled "Liagat Hussain and others Vs

Falak Sher and others" (2003 SCMR 611(a), wherein

-16-

it has been held:-

12.

failed to convince this court that it was non-else

"(a) Eye-witnesses including the
complainant had failed to furnish
a plausible and _ acceptable
explanation for being present on
the scene of occurrence and were
chance _ witnesses---Prosecution
case did not inspire confidence
and fell for short of sounding
probable to a man of reasonable
prudence---Abscondence of
accused in such circumstances
could not offer any useful
corroboration to the case of

prosecution"

Be that as it may, the prosecution

but accused who killed the deceased.

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS, Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
-17-

13. After thoroughly evaluating the evidence
available on file this court reaches to an inescapable
conclusion that the prosecution has miserably failed to
prove its case against accused/appellant. Resultantly,
this appeal is, therefore, allowed, the conviction and
sentence of the appellant recorded by the learned trial
court is set-aside and he is acquitted of the charge by
extending him the benefit of doubt, he shall be released
forth with from jail, if not required to be detained in
connection with any other case.

14. Above are the reasons of our short order

of the even date.
