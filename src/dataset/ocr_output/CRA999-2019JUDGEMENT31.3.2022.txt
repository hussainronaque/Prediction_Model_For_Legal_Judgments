State by -- Mr.Muhammad Wagas Chamkani,
Special Prosecutor for ANF.

LAL JAN KHATTAK, J:- Impugned herein is
the judgment dated 24.07.2019 of the learned
Judge Special Court (CNS) Peshawar
delivered in case FIR No.23 dated 24.11.2017
under sections 9 (c)/15 of the Control of
Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 of police station
ANF, Kohat whereby the appellant has been
convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for
life with fine of Rs.1,000,000/- or in default
whereof to further suffer simple imprisonment
for one year with benefit under section 382-B
Cr.P.C.

2. On 24.11.2017, pursuant to a spy
information, received by the high-ups of Anti-
Narcotic Force regarding the smuggling of
Acetic Anhydride, a chemical used in the
process of heroin, Inspector Shafique Ahmad,

SHO of police station ANF, Kohat arranged a
nakabandi at Old Toll Plaza, Karak when in the
meantime a truck bearing registration No.C-
2575/Lower Dir reached there from D.I.Khan
side which was signaled to stop and on its
search 10 cane containing 16 Kg Acetic
Anhydride were recovered. Driver of the
vehicle disclosed his name as Abdul Jalil. From
the recovered chemical, the complainant
separated 10/10 ml for chemical analysis
through 10 sealed parcels while the rest were
sealed in separate 10 parcels.

3. On completion of investigation, challan
was put in court which indicted the accused for
the offence to which he pleaded not guilty. In
order to prove its case, prosecution examined
04 witnesses whereafter statement of the
accused was recorded wherein he professed
his innocence. After conclusion of the trial, the
learned trial court found the appellant guilty of
the charge and while recording his conviction
sentenced him as mentioned above.

4. Arguments heard and record gone
through.

5. Perusal of the case record would show
that the seizing officer had separated 10/10 ml
of Acetic Anhydride through recovery memo

(Ex.P.W.3/2) from the recovered 16 Kg of
rad

chemical for the purpose of chemical analysis
and as per the FSL report, which is available
on the case file as (Ex.P.W.3/17), the
representative samples were subjected to
chemical and instrumental analysis wherein
Acetic Anhydride was detected. So the
prosecution has only proved the recovered
chemical had contained Acetic Anhydride. Now
the question would arise that what was the
percentage of Acetic Anhydride in the
recovered chemical? Prosecution case is
totally silent in this respect and when a known
quantity of some forbidden and illegal item,
chemical or contraband is not known then on
no count, the culprit charged for its trafficking
etc. can be convicted.
6. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan
in its judgment reported as PLD 2019 S.C.669
has held as under:-
“The reports of the chemical examiner
hopelessly fail to mention the
percentage of morphine found in the
intoxicating substance, leaving it
uncertain whether it passes for a
narcotic drug. This fatal omission makes
the Reports of the Chemical Examiner
inconclusive and unreliable to support
conviction under the Act.”
7. As the report of the chemical examiner
is inconclusive because no known percentage

of Acetic Anhydride has been given therein,

therefore, following the principle laid down in
(

the ibid judgment of the Apex Court, no
conviction can be maintained.

8. For what has been discussed above,
this appeal is allowed, the impugned conviction
and sentence is set aside and the appellant is
acquitted of the charge leveled against him. He
be set free forthwith, if not required to be
detained in any other case.

9. Above are the detailed reasons for our

earlier short order of even date.
