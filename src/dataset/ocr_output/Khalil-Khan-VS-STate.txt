2. According to report of complainant
Muhammad Shoaib on 28.10.2015 at 8.00 p.m. he while

his house and on next day when he opened his shop, found
its roof locks broken and 400 tolas gold and Rs.8,00,000/-

culprits in his initial report. Later on, on 08.12.2015, he in
his statement under section 164 Cr.P.C., besides charging

absconding co-accused Najibullah, Sher Ali, Tariq, Char

Gul alias Haji, Abdul Hadi and unknown co-accused, also
charged present petitioner by attributing him the role of
instigation in the commission of offence by advancing a
motive that petitioner had rented out his shop contiguous to
his shop in lieu of Rs.9000/- as rent per month to
co-accused named above without any rent deed or surety,
against which he complained to the petitioner about his
apprehension regarding theft by the co-accused being
afghan refugees, by jumping to the third floor of his shop,
on which the petitioner annoyed.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. Except the above motive advanced by the
complainant against the petitioner in his statement
recorded on 08.12.2015, that too, after a period of more
than one and a half month from the date of incident, at the
moment there is no other piece of direct or circumstantial
evidence to connect the petitioner with the commission of
offence. Besides, the role of instigation attributed to the
petitioner can only be determined during trial after
recording evidence which is sole domain of the Trial
Court. At the moment on tentative assessment of the
material on record, participation of the petitioner in the
commission of offence requires further probe into his guilt,

therefore, he is entitled to concession of bail.

5. Resultantly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he
furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two
local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD, concerned.
