S.M. ATTIQUE SHAH, J.- Through this petition the

petitioners Imran and Mulazim Hussain have sought bail
after arrest in case FIR No.567 dated 02.9.2019 under
Sections 458/382/411 PPC read Secton 15 AA registered
at Police Station SMA, District Tank.

2. The brief facts of the case, as set forth in the
crime report, are that on 02.9.2019 at 0800 hours,
complainant Fazal-ur-Rahman reported to the local police
that on the eventful night, five accused, one armed with
Kalshnikov, two having pistols and two empty handed,
entered his house, awakened him and took away
Rs.5,00,000/- from the pocket of his wearing banyan and

Rs.3,00,000/- from his wife Mst. Salma Bibi. The
»

-2-

complainant reported that he can identify the accused if
brought before him.

3. After their arrest, the petitioners applied for
their release on bail but their bail petition was dismissed
by learned Sessions Judge, Tank vide order dated
12.11.2019, hence, this petition for the same relief.

4. Arguments heard and record perused.

5. The petitioners have been involved in this
case through statements got recorded by the complainant
under Section 164 Cr.PC on 29.10.2019 and 04.11.2019
i.e. after two months of the occurrence wherein no source
of satisfaction has been mentioned by the complainant
and stated that the accused Sikandar alias Qalandar,
Mulazim Hussain alias Pawanda (petitioner) and Surat
Khan were arrested in district Bhakkar in another case and
during investigation in that case admitted the commission
of the instant offence. Law is quite settled on the point
that the statement without source has got no value in the
eye of law. Reliance placed on “Naeem Akhtar v. The
State” 1996 SCMR 511 and “Abid Ali alias Ali v. The
State” 2011 SCMR_ 161. Moreover, in the FIR the
complainant stated that five accused entered the house
and committed the offence while in his statements under
Section 164 Cr.PC he charged six accused.

6. No test-identification parade has been held
in this case so as to positively involve the petitioners with

the commission of alleged offence despite the fact that the
oA

-3-

complainant mentioned in the FIR that he can identify the
accused if brought before him. In cases where the names
of culprits are not mentioned, holding of test-
identification parade becomes mandatory. Reliance placed

on 1997 SCMR 971, 2010 YLR 126, 2005 YLR 565

2004 PCr.LJ 1659 and 2000 YLR 80.

7. Although recovery of Rs.1,00,000/- each has
been shown effected from the petitioners yet the fact
remains that authenticity of such recovery will be
considered by the learned trial Court after recording
evidence in this case. Heinousness of an offence is no
ground to refuse bail to an accused who otherwise
becomes entitled for the concession of bail. There is no
previous record of the petitioners being convicted in such
like cases. Investigation of this case qua the petitioners is
complete and they are no more required for the purpose of
further investigation, therefore, their continuous
incarceration in jail would not serve any beneficial
purpose at this stage.

8. In view of the above, the case against the
petitioners calls for further inquiry into their guilt within
the purview of subsection (2) of Section 497, Cr.P.C. This
petition is, therefore, allowed and the petitioners are
admitted to bail on furnishing hail bonds in the sum of
Rs.200,000/- (Rupees two hundred thousand) with two
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of

Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate.

9. Needless to say that any observation made
in this order being tentative in nature should in no way
prejudice the proceedings before the learned trial Court.

10. Above are the detailed reasons for my short

order of even date.
