appellant in the instant Criminal Appeal, was
tried for the offence under Section 9 ( C )
CNSA, and convicted and sentenced to life
imprisonment and fine of Rs.200000/- or in
default of payment of fine to six months S.I,
with benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C, by the
learned Judge Special Court/Additional
Sessions Judge-V, Mansehra, vide impugned

judgment dated 26.07.2013.
2. The case set up by the prosecution
against the convict/appellant vide FIR No.1
dated 01.01.2013 under Section 9 ( C ) CNSA
P.S City, Mansehra, was that while on routine
gusht duty in official pick up along with other
police officials on Mansehra-Abbottabad road,
Amjad Khan, Inspector/SHO P.S_ City
Mansehra, complainant, reached near Faujji
Foundation Hospital at 1600 hours on
01.01.2013, and spotted a person carrying a
light green colour sack on his head coming
from Karakorum Side towards Mansehra and
tried to enter the nearby street on the sight
of police mobile but he was stopped on
suspicion and search of the sack led to
recovery of 25 packets containing ‘chars’ out
of which five packets were in yellow colour
while the rest of 20 packets were in green-
black colour and each packet weighing
1000/1000 grams contained 14/14 slabs,
total ‘chars’ weighing 25000 - grams.
According to the FIR, the complainant SHO

separated 5/5 grams sample from each
packet with a knife and sealed them in
parcels No.1 to 25 for chemical analysis in
the FSL after separately sealing them, while
the remaining ‘chars’ weighing 24875 grams
was sealed in another parcel No.26. The
person from whom the recovery of ‘chars’
was made disclosed his name as Sharafat
Khan son of Lal Khan resident of Sheikhul
Bandi, Abbottabad. He was arrested and case
was registered against him vide the FIR on
the basis of murasila drafted by the
complainant/SHO.

3. The complainant/SHO also
prepared the recovery memo wherein the
slabs were shown closely attached with each
other. The samples in parcel No.1 to 25, five
grams (each) sealed in parcels on the spot
immediately after recovery on 01.01.2013
were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory
(FSL), and received in the FSL_ on
03.01.2013, and were also subjected to
chemical analysis, and report of the chemical

examiner confirmed that it was ‘chars’ in
parcels No.1 to 25. After recording
statements of the PWs and completion of
investigation, complete challan was
submitted against the convict/appellant to
the trial Court, which took cognizance, and
charged the convict/appellant under Section
9 ( C ) CNSA. During trial, the prosecution
produced six PWs, including, Muhammad
Salim (PW.1), who took the parcels to the
FSL and handed over the same to the
concerned officer in the FSL; Bashir Khan ASI
(PW.2), marginal witness to the recovery
memo EXPW2/1 whereby 25 packets of
‘chars’ were recovered from the possession of
the convict/appellant and samples each
weighing 5/5 grams were separated and
sealed in parcels No.1 to 25 for chemical
analysis and the remaining contraband
‘chars’ weighing 24875 grams also separately
sealed in a separate parcel No.26 in his
presence; Amjad Khan Inspector/SH P.S City
Mansehra (PW.3), the complainant/SHO who

recovered the contraband ‘chars’, arrested
the convict/appellant, drafted murasila and
separated samples and separately sealed the
samples as well as the remaining ‘chars’;
Muhammad Iltaf Inspector (PW4) registered
FIR on the basis of the murasila; Gul
Muhammad _ SI/OII P.S_ City Mansehra
(PW.5), conducted investigation; and Liaqat
Hussain Shah MHC (PW.6), was entrusted
parcels No.1 to 25 and he sent the same
through road certificate dated 03.01.2013 for
chemical analysis.

4. After the prosecution closed its
evidence, statement of the convict/appellant
was recorded under Section 342 Cr.PC
wherein he refuted the allegations of the
prosecution, but declined to be examined on
oath as his own witness within the meaning
of Section 340(2) Cr.P.C or produce defence
evidence. On conclusion of trial and after
hearing arguments of learned defence
counsel as well as learned DPP and perusal of
record, the learned trial Court/ASJ-V,

Mansehra, found case of the prosecution
proved against the convict/appellant without
any shadow of doubt, therefore, convicted
the appellant/accused under Section 9 ( C )
CNSA and sentenced him to imprisonment for
life and also fine of Rs.200000/- or in default
to six months S.I, as quantity of the
recovered ‘chars’ exceeded ten kgs. The
learned trial Court also extended benefit of
Section 382-B Cr.P.C to the
appellant/accused, vide judgment dated
26.07.2013; hence the instant appeal by the
convict/appellant against his conviction and
sentence vide the impugned judgment.

5. Arguments of the learned counsel
for the convict/appellant and State Counsel
heard, and record perused.

6. It is in the evidence that a huge
quantity of 25000 grams ‘chars’ was
recovered from the possession of the
convict/appellant; which was confirmed as
such in his report by the chemical examiner
after chemical analysis of the samples

separated from the bulk. The prosecution not
only placed on record report of the chemical
examiner (EXPW5/4) but also produced
witnesses (PW1 and PW6) besides the
complainant and marginal witness to the
recovery memo in order to prove taking of
samples from each packet by the
complainant/SHO, their sealing in separate
parcels on the spot immediately after the
recovery, and their safe custody till they
were received in the FSL on 3™ day of its
recovery without being tampered with during
this period. The positive report of the FSL
confirmed recovery of ‘chars’, and thus
substantiated version of the prosecution.

7. The learned counsel for the
convict/appellant vehemently argued that
though each packet was shown containing
14/14 slabs, but samples of 5/5 grams were
taken from 25 packets and not from each of
14/14 slabs in the packet, thus rendering the
report of FSL relevant only to the extent of
125 grams, and not to the entire 25000

grams contained in 25 packets, allegedly,
recovered from the possession of the
convict/appellant by the police. The learned
counsel further argued that non association
of witnesses from the general public would
also cast doubt on the prosecution case
against the convict/appellant. The learned
counsel particularly referred to the plea of
the convict/appellant that the ‘chars’ was in
fact recovered from room of one Hafiz Ullah
situated adjacent to his room in the same
Shajee Hotel on Abbottabad road, who was
also taken into custody by the police, but was
let off after receiving illegal gratification from
him, and that he was involved in the case at
his instance. According to the learned
counsel for the convict/appellant, it was
proved on record that the convict/appellant
was running a marble shop and was made a
scapegoat in order to save the said Hafiz
Ullah.

8. Apart from the fact the
complainant/SHO recorded a note on the

recovery memo (EXPW2/1) to the effect that
the place of occurrence was a busy road but
despite his efforts no one from the public
volunteered to become a witness to the
recovery memo. Needless to say that this is
not an unusual phenomenon now-a-days. It
is equally well established that police officials
are as good witnesses as any other witnesses
unless malice can be established against
them. The convict/appellant, despite claim of
his involvement in the case by the police at
the behest of one Hafiz Ullah, could not
discharge the burden of proving malice on
the part of either the said Hafiz Ullah or local
police. He was afforded the opportunity of
both recording his statement on oath as his
own witness and producing defence, but he
failed to avail the opportunity and prove his
version, and declined to be examined on oath
as his own witness and produce defence
evidence. On the other hand, it is something
beyond imagination that the police would
stoop so low to substitute an innocent person

for the real culprit and implicate him in a
10

case of recovery of such a huge quantity of
contraband ‘chars’ when there was nothing
on record to impute the devilish role of
implication of the convict/appellant by the
police in such a concocted case, that too, at
the behest of a person namely Hafiz Ullah,
whose very nexus with the case was not
established on record, let alone recovery of
‘chars’ from him and his rescuing himself
after greasing palms of the police. The
learned counsel for the convict/appellant
vainly tried to prove defence version from the
lengthy cross examination of defence on the
PWs but miserably failed to show on record
that the plea taken in this regard by the
convict/appellant was established on record
through independent and convincing
evidence.

9. In order to arrive at a just
decision, we took the extra ordinary step to
open the sack and also the packets, but the
exercise further reaffirmed the fact that

the complainant/SHO had taken samples
11

from a corner of each slab in the packet, thus
falsifying the assertion of the defence that
samples were not taken from each of the
slabs in the 25 packets.

10 Besides, there appears no
contradiction in this respect in the
statements of PWs despite the fact they were
subjected to lengthy and searching cross
examination by the defence. Their testimony
remained consistent and coherent regarding
material facts of the case, thus proving
recovery of huge quantity of 25000 grams
from the possession of the convict/appellant,
making him liable to the punishment of not
less than imprisonment for life under Section
9 (C) CNSA.

11. In the circumstances, the
conviction of the appellant and award of
sentence of imprisonment for life to him with
fine of Rs.200000/- or in default to six
months S.I with benefit of Section 382-B
Cr.PC by the learned trial Court vide

impugned judgment dated 26.07.2013 are
12

not open to exception, which are hereby
upheld; and appeal of the convict/appellant
dismissed, accordingly.
