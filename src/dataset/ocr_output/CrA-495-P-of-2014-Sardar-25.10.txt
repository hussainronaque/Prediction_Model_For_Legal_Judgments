LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- This criminal
appeal is directed against the judgment
dated 26.07.2014 of the learned Sessions
Judge, Hangu delivered in case FIR No.77
dated 14.07.2013 u/ss 302/34 PPC of
Police Station Balyamina, Hangu, whereby
the appellant has been convicted and
sentenced to imprisonment for life with
payment of Rs.2,00,000/- as compensation
payable to the legal heirs of the deceased or
in default whereof to further undergo six
months SI. Benefit u/s 382-B Cr.P.C.

has been extended to him.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on
14.07.2013, Muhammad Rehman (PW-2)

reported to SHO Sher Bahadar Khan (PW-1)
at Ghalmina Check Post to the effect that he
and his brother Babar Khan were present in
their house when accused Haq Nawaz,
Sher Nawaz and Sardar came duly armed
out of whom accused Haq Nawaz called his
brother to come out. No sooner did they
come out of house, all the accused started
firing at his brother with which he was hit
and died on the spot. Motive for the
occurrence was stated to be infuriation of
the accused when they were reprimanded

by the deceased on their wrong doings.

3. On arrest of the accused i.e. the
present appellant, complete challan was put
in court, which indicted him for the
commission of offence to which he pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial. Prosecution in
order to prove its case examined 8
witnesses in all whereafter statement of the
accused was_ recorded, wherein, he
professed his innocence. The learned trial
court, after conclusion of the trial, found the
appellant guilty of the charge and while
recording his conviction sentenced him as

mentioned above, hence the instant appeal.
4. Arguments heard and record gone
through.
5. Perusal of the case record would

show that complainant of the case appeared
before the court as PW-2 while one Sajid
testified as PW-3. Both the witnesses
though have deposed against the accused
in line with the allegations contained in the
case FIR (Ex.PA/1) but pronounced aspect
of the case is that the appellant is father of
the two absconding accused and is an old
man of 70 years. It is worth to note that PW-
3 has stated in his cross-examination that
after firing the accused fled away towards
northern mountain. As the appellant is a
septuagenarian i.e. 70 years old, therefore,
his fleeing towards the mountain for hiding
after the occurrence is a fact, which cannot
be believed keeping in view his infirmness
as by then he had orbited around the sun for
70 times. Record reflects that the job of
firing at the deceased is not that of the three
persons as has been alleged in the FIR and
deposed by the prosecution’s witnesses. It
appears that the complainant side has
leveled an exaggerated charge so as to

enrope therein the appellant for his being
father of the two absconding accused, which

practice is very much common in the country.

6. In addition, presence of the appellant
on the spot at the time of occurrence has not
been proved as per site plan (Ex.PB)
wherefrom no empty of shot gun has been
recovered, which weapon the appellant, as
per the prosecution’s witness, was holding
at the time of occurrence. Moreso, in the site
plan, appellant has been shown at point
No.5 while the complainant at point No.1.
Keeping in view both the __localitions
mentioned above, it was not possible for the
complainant to see the appellant as_ in
between the points there is a hindrance of a

room.

7. Thorough and careful examination of
the case record and keeping in view the age
factor of the appellant, it can safely be ruled
that the prosecution has not proved its case
against the appellant beyond = any
reasonable doubt. It has been held
umpteenth times by the superior courts that
in order to record conviction of an accused,
the prosecution must prove its case through

worth reliable and confidence inspiring
evidence, which is not the case in hand. The
learned trial court has not properly
appreciated the case evidence in its true
perspective and has fallen in legal error to
record conviction of the appellant for which

its judgment is not sustainable.

8. For what has been discussed, this
appeal is allowed, conviction and sentence
of the appellant are set aside. He is
acquitted of the charge leveled against him
and be set at liberty forthwith if not required

to be detained in any other case.

9. Above are the reasons of our short

order of even date, which reads as under:-

“For the reasons to be recorded later, this
appeal is allowed, conviction and sentence of
the appellant recorded by the learned Sessions
Judge, Hangu vide impugned judgment dated
26.07.2014 delivered in case FIR No.77 dated
14.07.2013 u/ss 302/34 PPC of Police Station
Balyamina, Hangu are set aside. He is
acquitted of the charge leveled against him and
be set free forthwith if not required to be

detained in any other case”.
