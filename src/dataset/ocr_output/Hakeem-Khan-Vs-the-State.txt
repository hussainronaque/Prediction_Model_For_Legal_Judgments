JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.-

Petitioner Hakeem Khan, seeks bail in case FiR

NO.286 dated 08.04.2015, registered under

sections 302/3424/34 PPC, in Police Station

Badhber, Peshawar, wherein he alongwith his

sons (absconding co-accused) Saeed and Bacha

Khan, is charged for committing the murder of

Akhtar Ali deceased and attempting at the lives

Sifat Ullah and Asghar Khan with firearms, on a

motive of some land dispute.

2. On the previous date i.e. 25.08.2015,

learned counsel for the petitioner besides

arguing the case on merits, stressed upon release

of the petitioner on bail on the ground of his old

age and weak health. Since, for determination of

age and physical status of the petitioner, record

was not sufficient, therefore, in the interest of

justice, the petitioner was directed to be

requisitioned from concerned Jail and be

produced before the court for today.

3. Today, petitioner is before the Court in

hand cuffs. On observation, I find him too much

old with quite feeble health, having low eyesight

bearing heavy spectacles on his face.

Admittedly, old age or infirmity are physical

phenomena and which can be perceived by

seeing and no documentary evidence would be

required to hold a lame person to be a lame

person or an old person to be an old. In view of

old age and feeble physical condition of the

petitioner, coupled with the fact that on the very

next date of incident he himself has surrendered

before the police, his participation in the

incident is a debatable question to be answered

by the prosecution during trial. When confronted

with the feeble physical condition and old age of

the petitioner, learned AAG and learned counsel

for the complainant fairly and frankly expressed

their no objection on his release on_ bail,

however, requested for avoiding findings on the

merits of the case on the ground that it may

prejudice the case of the prosecution to the

extent of absconding co-accused. The request

being genuine, I am in agreement with them.

3. Accordingly, I without touching the

merits of the case, release the petitioner on bail

on the sole ground of his old age and feeble

health, provided he furnishes bail bonds in the

sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two sureties each in

the like amount to the satisfaction of learned

Illaqa Judicial Magistrate/MOD, concerned. The

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

sureties must be local, reliable and men of
means. The prosecution is directed to submit
challan against the petitioner within a week and
the learned trial court shall conclude the trial
expeditiously. Office is directed to send the
record to quarter concerned within two days,
positively.
