Social Development (NHSD), who submitted
written application to the Station House
Officer (SHO) Police Station Khan Pur,
Haripur, thereby reporting about
misappropriation of X-ray machine worth
Rs.2,500,000/- from the MCH Centre
Tarnawa, Haripur, lying there under the
administrative control of the accused/
petitioners. In his report, the complainant
alleged that they were informed about
dislocation of the machines from the Centre
by the USAID, and the said information was
confirmed by the staff of the complainant
during their visit to the Centre on 01.07.2015.
it was further alleged in the report that the
accused/petitioners while acknowledging their
negligence, handed over a cheque for an
amount of Rs.2,500,000/- to make good the
loss of the machine but they later on refused
to take responsibility, hence report about

breach of trust.

2. After registration of the case, the
accused/petitioners were arrested on
14.07.2015 and an interim challan under
Police Rules 25.56 was submitted against the
accused/petitioners as well as co-accused
Arshad on 15.07.2015, followed by another
interim challan on 16.07.2015. During
investigation, certain documents pertaining to
the case have been supplied by the
complainant to the 1.0, and an_ interim/
complete challan under section 173 Cr.P.C
as also been submitted in the case by SHO,
Police Station Khan Pur on 26.07.2015. In
view of contention: of learned counsel for the
defence that investigation in the case is
complete as complete challan in the case
has been submitted by the police/prosecution,
the SHO Police Station Khan Pur and
Mukhtaj Ali ASI/IO were summoned for
clarification whether investigation in the case
was complete or otherwise; but only the

ASIN.O appeared today and clarified that the
challan dated 26.07.2015 is interim as
investigation in the case is not yet complete
owing to the reason that the co-accused
Arshad Mehmood is still on ad-interim pre-
arrest bail vide order of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-lll, Haripur dated
23.07.2015, and that the word ‘complete’ has
inadvertently been written on the Interim
Challan Form.

3. Arguments of the learned counsel for
the accused/petitioners, learned Additional
Advocate General assisted by learned
counsel for complainant/respondent No.2
heard, and record perused.

4. In order to prove entrustment of X-ray
machine in question alongwith other costly
medical equipments to the accused/
petitioners, the Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) was palced on file,
which was signed by accused/petitioner
Nazar Ahmad as Executive Director, Dehi

Development Society (DDS) and Doctor Fozia

5

Moghees, Executive Coordinator NHSD,
envisaging therein up-gradation of Maternal!
and Child Care Centre, Tarnawa, Haripur
Project SGAFP (USAID) Tarnawa, Haripur,
and obliging the DDS to work for the smooth
running of the hospital, Lab, OPD, and also
providing for overall security of the Centre
and safety of the equipments as the
responsibility of the DDS/Doctor Habib,
accused-petitioner No.1/staff of the Hospital.
n order to further augment case against the
ccused/petitioners, the 1.0 was provided
agreement between the accused/petitioners
showing acceptance of responsibility
regarding the X-ray machine and _ their
undertaking to provide the machine to the
hospital by 1st August, 2015 and also
handing over cheque for Rs.2,500,000/- to
the NHSD by way of guarantee.

5. During arguments, the learned counsel
for the accused/petitioners contended that the

accused/petitioners could not be saddled with

ee.

6

responsibility for the missing of the X-ray
machine as NHSD had itself provided
‘chowkidar for the hospital. The learned
counsel questioned the so-called agreement
between the accused/petitioners and urged
that the same was forged by the complainant
to falsely implicate the accused/petitioners in
the case. The learned counsel pointed out
that the alleged cheque for Rs.2,500,000/-
was not available on the record, which,
ccording to the learned counsel, might also
have been forged by the complainant for the
same purpose.
6. The perusal of record, particularly MOU
between the parties, would show that after
acceptance of responsibility for safety of all
valuable equipments including = X-ray
machine, which were entrusted to the
accused/ petitioners for running the hospital,
by the NHSD, there is indeed a prima facie
case of breach of trust on the part of the

accused/petitioners when the X-ray machine
7

was found missing / dislocated. The
contention of the learned counsel for the
accused/ petitioners that the machine was
missing since long and that the‘chowkidar of
the NHSD in the hospital should have
reported the matter earlier, is also far-fetched
keeping in view the fact that the
accused/petitioners had accepted
responsibility for safe custody of the
equipments under the MOU, which is
nowhere denied by them. No doubt, the
accused/petitioners dispute execution of the
so-called agreement between them and also
cheque for Rs.2,500.000/-, but the veracity of
their such claim at this stage when the case is
still under investigation would involve deep
appreciation of evidence, which is not
permissible at the bail stage. The 1.0 who
appeared in the Court in pursuance of notice
for his appearance, stated at the bar that
since the cheque was not yet presented to

the concerned bank, the same was not taken
into possession in the case. The learned
AAG and learned counsel for the
complainant, on the other hand, informed that
the cheque has since been dishonoured on
presentation, and a case under Section 489-F
PPC has also been registered against the
accused/petitioners.

7. In view of the above-mentioned material
available on the record, there exist
reasonable grounds to prima facie connect
the accused/petitioners with the offences.
Therefore, notwithstanding the fact that the
offences with which the accused/petitioners
have been charged do not fall within the
domain of prohibitory clause contained in
section 497 Cr.P.C, accused/petitioners
would not be entitled to the concession of bail
in view of exceptional circumstances of the
case, as the equipments provided by the
USAID through NHSD for the noble cause of
treatment of ailing mothers and children have

been dislocated/removed, thereby not only
breaching the trust and bringing bad name to
the country by shattering the trust of donor
agencies, but also causing untold hardships to
the needy patients. In such circumstances,
the accused/petitioners can neither take
shelter under pendency of civil suit on the
subject and other technicalities nor can claim
the bail as a matter of right in offences which
are admittedly non-bailable. (PLD 1968 $c
349, PLD 1997 SC 545, 2000 P.Cr.L.J 105,
and 2011 P.Cr.L.J 852).

8. The bail petition is, therefore, bereft of
merit, hence dismissed.

Announced.
Dt.02.09.2015.
