JUDGMENT
MUHAMMAD IJAZ KHAN, J.- The appellant has
filed the instant appeal under section 417 of the
Criminal Procedure Code 1898, against the
order/judgment of acquittal dated 15.07.2021 passed
by the learned Judicial Magistrate/Judge Model
Trial Magisterial Court Buner at Dagger, whereby he
has acquitted respondents No. 1 to 3 from the
charges leveled against them by invoking the
provision of section 249-A Cr.P.C, in case FIR No.

07 dated 14.01.2021 registered under sections

_ 452/506/337 L (ii)/34 PPC at Police Station Gagra

District Buner.

(S.B.} Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
2. Precisely the facts of the case are that
the present appellant being a complainant registered
the aforesaid FIR whereby he has levelled clear
allegations of criminal intimidation, firing for the
purpose of terrifying the complainant’s son and
beating the complainant with knife and sticks blow,
as a result of which he sustained injuries on different
parts of his body. Motive behind the occurrence was
stated to be a dispute over the cutting of trees. After
registration of the FIR the Worthy Investigating
Officer conducted an extensive investigation by
preparing the site plan, placed on record the medical
evidence of the appellant/complainant. The
Investigating Officer has also investigated the
motive part of the case and thus at the end of his
investigation submitted complete challan to the
Court of learned Judicial Magistrate Buner for the
trial where too he has categorically opined that prima
facie the accused/respondents are connected with the
commission of offence.

3. The record shows that the charge was
framed against the acquitted respondents on

05.03.2021 and thereafter statements of eight (08)

(S.8.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
prosecution witnesses were also recorded, when in
the meanwhile, the acquitted respondents submitted
an application under section 249-A CrP.C on
12.07.2021 for their acquittal, in which notices were
issued to the State as well as to the complainant and
after hearing both parties the accused/respondents
were acquitted of the charges levelled against them
vide the impugned order /judgment of acquittal dated
15.07.2021 of the Court of learned Judicial
Magistrate Buner at Daggar, which order has now
been challenged by the appellant before this Court
through the instant appeal.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for the
parties as well as learned Astt: A.G for the State
were heard and the record perused with their able
assistance.

5. The record would reveal that the
accused/respondents were acquitted of the charges
leveled against them by the learned trial Court vide
the impugned order and judgment dated 15.07.2021
by entertaining an application filed under section
249-A Cr.P.C. The record further indicates that the

acquitted respondents were charged by the appellant/

(S.B.) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad tjaz Khan
complainant in the aforesaid FIR mainly for the
allegations that they have criminally intimidated the
complainant’s son namely Saneef Gul by extended
him threats and they have also resorted to firing in
order to terrify him. They were also charged for
beating the complainant with knife blows as a result
of which he got injured on different parts of his
body. In support of the aforesaid charge, the
appellant/complainant produced the ocular account
when he himself appeared in Court as PW-6,
however, in the middle of the way, the learned trial
Court in a very hasty and casual manner entertained
the application submitted by the accused/respondents
under section 249-A Cr.P.C and thereby acquitted
them of the charges vide the impugned order and
judgment 15.07.2021 even without waiting for
statements of the concerned doctor who examined
the injured victim and the Investigating Officer of
the case, whose evidence for the fate of
prosecution’s case was surely essential but the
leamed trial Court without procuring their

attendance has resorted for a short-cut and has

{S.B.} Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
Ne

acquitted the accused/respondents through the
impugned order/judgment.

6. It may be noted that production of the
doctor and Investigating Officer being the official
witnesses of the prosecution was the duty of the
Public Prosecutor and of the Court and to ensure
their availability before the Court for recording of
their evidence, however, without recording their
evidence the learned trial Court on the basis of its
own assumptions and presumptions has acquitted the
accused/respondent through the impugned order and
judgment, which is not sustainable in the eyes of
law.

7. In the recent past Article 10A has been
inserted in The Constitution of Pakistan, 1973 where
due process of law has been recognized and
acknowledged as one of the fundamental right of
every person, however, in the present case due
process of law has been denied to the appellant/
complainant as legally he should have been provided
a reasonable and fair opportunity to prosecute the
person(s) who has nominated them as an accused of

offences, but the record of the case speaks otherwise

(S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan

as he has been deprived of the prescribed process of
the law without any fault on his part. In the case of

“Model _Custom Collectorate Islamabad v/s Aamir

Mumtaz Qureshi” reported as 2022 SCMR 1861 it
was held by the Apex Court that there is no cavil to
the proposition that by enacting sections 249-A and
265-K, Cr.P.C., the Legislature provided power to
acquit an accused at any stage of the case if, after
hearing the prosecutor and the accused and for
reasons to be recorded, it considers that the charge is
groundless or that there is no probability of the
accused being convicted of any offence. But
acquittal, under the said sections, could be made
only if there was no probability of conviction of the
accused. However, each case must be judged on its
own special facts and circumstances and the reasons
are to be recorded in support of conclusion that
charge is groundless or that there is no probability of
accused being convicted. If there is remote
probability of conviction then of course courts are
not empowered to invoke the said provisions i.e.
249-A and 265-K Cr.P.C. Reliance in this regard

may be placed on the case of Zhe State through

(S.B.} Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
Advocate-General, Sindh High Court of Karachi y.

Raja Abdul Rehman (2005 SCMR 1544) wherein it
was held that though there is no bar for an accused
person to file application under section 249-A,
Cr.P.C. at any stage of the proceedings of the case
yet the facts and circumstances of the prosecution
case will have to be kept in mind and considered in
deciding the viability or feasibility of filing an
application at any particular stage. The Special or
peculiar facts and circumstances of a prosecution
case may not warrant filing of an application at a

stage. This Court in the case of Bashir Ahmad vy.

Zafar ul Islam (PLD 2004 SC 298) did not approve
decision of criminal cases on an application under
section 249-A, Cr.P.C. or such allied or similar
provisions of law, namely, section 265-K or section
561-A, Cr.P.C. and observed that usually a criminal
case should be allowed to be disposed of on merits
after recording of the prosecution evidence,
statement of the accused under section 342, Cr.P.C.,
recording of statement of accused under section
340(2), Cr.P.C. if so desired by the accused persons

and hearing the arguments of the counsel of the

(S.8.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad jaz Khan

parties and that the provisions of section 249-A,
section 265-K and section 561-A of the Cr.P.C.
should not normally be pressed into action for
decision of fate of a criminal case especially when
apparently there is probability of conviction after
recording evidence. In the present case, trial court
disrupted the normal course of law against the

mandate of supra judgment i.e. Bashir Ahmad y.

Zafar ul-Islam and others (PLD 2004 SC 298). In

the case of The State through Collector Customs
and Excise, Quetta v. Azam Malik and others (PLD

2005 SC 686) this Court held as under:-

"22. This brings us to the third question i.e.
whether the prosecution had sufficient
material/evidence to warrant the prosecution of
the respondents or there was no probability of
accused being convicted of any offence. We
have gone through the FIR registered against
the respondents and the absconding co-accused
as also the evidence led before the Court. There
were serious allegations that there was
tampering/overwriting/cutting of the relevant
register of bills of entry, the matter was
inquired into at the departmental level and the
allegations were found to be correct. Ex facie
there was documentary, oral and circumstantial
evidence to prove the charges. In the face of
this material the Trial Court could not have
invoked section 265-K, Cr.P.C. and acquit the
respondents."

Reliance may also be placed on the

cases of Muhammad Sharif v. The State (PLD 1999
SC 1063), Ghulam Faroog Tarar v. Rizwan Ahmad

(S.B.) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad [jaz Khan
and others (2008 SCMR 383). Similarly, in the case
of “Muhammad Amjad v/s The State” reported as
1992 P Cr.LJ 331, the Lahore High Court has held
that it was a challan case and it was the duty of the
Court itself to summon the witnesses properly and,
even to use coercive measures for their attendance.
Only after exhausting all, legal available methods for
forcing their attendance, the Magistrate could have
closed the evidence. The whole approach was illegal
and incorrect. Similarly, in the case of “Syed Anwar

Ali Shah v/s Yar Muhamamd & 03 others” reported

as “1986 P Cr.LJ 1278”, the Hon’ble Sindh High

Court has held that before parting with the case, I
would like to make a few observations with regard to
exercise of jurisdiction conferred by section 249-A,
Cr.P.C. It is noticed that there has been growing
tendency amongst the lower Courts to frequently
invoking of the above section. As has been pointed
out above the Magistrate has power to acquit the
accused under the said section even prior to framing
of charge and recording of evidence. But the order of
acquittal to be passed by him should not only be

supported by cogent and convincing reasons but

{8.B.} Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad IJaz Khan
-10-

should also be grounded on the material, which the
Magistrate is legally permitted to take into
consideration. Until the evidence is recorded, the
only material available to the Magistrate is the police
papers which are laid before him alongwith the
charge-sheet. On perusal of the police papers if he
comes to the conclusion that no offence is made out
or the material contained in the police papers is so
scanty that it is most unlikely to lead to conviction,
the accused can be acquitted even at that early stage.
But it must be borne in mind that for purpose of
exercising jurisdiction under section 249-A, Cr.P.C.
the Magistrate is not competent to consider any
extraneous material. In other words he cannot
make such material as basis of his order which has
not been brought on record in accordance with the law.
The material produced by the accused not in course of
the proceedings either through witnesses examined by
him in his defence or at the time of giving his
statement under section 342, Cr.P.C. cannot be

considered, much less made the basis of his acquittal

under section 249-A, Cr.P.C.

{S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad \Jaz Khan

8. In view of the above discussion, this
Court has no other option but to set aside the
impugned order/judgment of acquittal dated
15.07.2021 and remand the case back to the learned
trial Court to record the remaining evidence or/and at
least to record the statements of the concerned doctor
and Investigating Officer and thereafter the case ‘be
decided on merits, however, it will be appreciated if
the trial in the instant case is concluded at the earliest
preferably within a period of two months from the
receipt of judgment of this Court. The parties are
directed to appear before the learned trial Court on
20.03.2023. Needless to mention here that since during
trial the accused/respondents were on bail as transpires
from the record, therefore, they shall remain on bail in
the post remand proceedings till the final decision of

the case on merits.
