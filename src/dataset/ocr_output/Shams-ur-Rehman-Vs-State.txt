ORDER

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- Petitioner

Shams ur Rehman alias Khan, seeks bail in case FIR
No.670 dated 17.08.2010, registered under section 17 (3)
Offences Against Property (Enforcement of Hudood)
Ordinance, 1979, and S.411 PPC, in Police Station
Gulbahar.

2. Complainant Sheraz Inayat present in person
stated at the bar that he does not want to engage a counsel
and would rely on the arguments of learned AAG for the
State. He also requested for cancellation of non-bailable
warrant of arrest issued against him on the previous date.
Since the warrant has not yet been executed, therefore, the
same stands cancelled.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for the

petitioner and learned AAG for the State heard and record

perused.

4. According to report of complainant on the
fateful day he alongwith inmates of his house was present
in their house when at 1140 hours, somebody rang the bell
of his house; that when his younger sister opened the door,
a woman accompanied by five persons duly armed with
firearms entered their house and forcibly took away gold
and cash amount alongwith CNIC; that he can identify the
culprits if brought before him. Initially, lady accused
Mst. Humaira Shafiq was arrested, who disclosed the
names of other co-accused in her statement. Later on,
complainant and one Khalid Jeweler in their statements
under section 164 Cr.P.C besides charging other
co-accused, also charged the petitioner.

5. Admittedly, petitioner is not named in the
FIR. The source qua his complicity in the commission of
offence has not been disclosed by the complainant in his
statement under section 164 Cr.P.C. Neither any recovery
of the alleged snatched gold and cash amount has been
effected from direct or indirect possession of the petitioner
nor has he confessed his guilt before the competent Court
of law. Similarly, no identification parde of the petitioner
has been conducted. Thus, in the above circumstances,
connectivity of the petitioner in the commission of offence

requires further probe into his guilt. The only ground

which prevailed before the learned Trial Court for refusal
of bail to the petitioner, was his abscondence, but it has
been settled by the august Apex Court in case titled,
“Qamar alias Mitho Vs The State and others” (PLD
2012 Supreme Court 222) that right of bail cannot not be
refused to accused merely on account of his alleged
abscondance which is a factor relevant only to propriety.
No doubt, trial of the petitioner is in progress and as a
practice usually the Courts in such like circumstances
avoid disposal of the bail matter on merits with a view that
the case of any party may not be prejudice, but this
principle is not of a universal application. It has been held
by the august Apex Court in case titled, “Abid Ali alias
Ali vs the State” (2011 SCMR 161), that when prima face
case of accused appears to be one of further inquiry and is
covered under the provisions of section 497 Cr.P.C. then it
becomes right of accused that he be released on bail.
Practice of refusal of bail in cases where challan has been
submitted or trial is in progress should not be a bar to
refuse a right as bail cannot be withheld as a punishment. It
appears from the record that supplementary challan has
been submitted against the petitioner on 01.08.2015 and he
has been charge sheeted on 14.10.2015. Since 14.10.2015

till 27.01.2016, when record of the case was requisitioned

by this Court in connection with the instant bail petition,
not a single prosecution witness has been examined despite
hectic efforts of the learned Trial Court. As manifest from
the order sheets of the learned Trial Court despite process
even the complainant is not appearing before the learned
Trial Court for his evidence. It may be noted that in this
Court too, presence of the complainant was procured on
the basis of non-bailable warrant of arrest. Thus, in such
circumstances, refusal of bail to the petitioner, who
otherwise is entitled to its concession as a right, would not
be a step justified in law.

6. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he
furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two
local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD concerned.
