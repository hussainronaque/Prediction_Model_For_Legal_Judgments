Dr. Khurshid Iqbal, J.-

1. The petitioners Hizbullah son of Haji Abdullah and
Suleman alias Nikka son of Maqbool Khan seek post arrest
bail in case FIR No.236, dated 29.4.2024 (the year
mistakenly written in the memo of , bail petition as
29.4.2023), under Sections 377 (mentioned as 376, PPC)/34,
PPC read with Section 15 AA, of Police Station Saddar, D.I.
Khan.

2. Both the petitioners were booked on the complaint of
Muhammad Awais (victim) who rushed to the local police
station alongwith his father Muhammad Sharif. The story of
the incident the victim told to the police is that on 23.4.2024
at 09:00 p.m., he was present in a thoroughfare in front of his
house. In the meantime, the petitioners equipped with pistols
arrived there on a motorcycle. They sat him on the

motorcycle. They took him in the sugarcane field crop near a

-2-

place called Kokar-T, and committed sodomy with him on
gunpoint. Thereafter, they dropped him to his house and
threatened not to disclose the event to anyone otherwise they
will kill him.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioners argued for grant of
bail on the grounds of 02-days delay in lodging the report;
unclear medical report of the victim and non-receipt of the

FSL report of the swabs taken from the victim.

4, The learned A.A.G., opposed the grant of bail for the
reasons that the petitioners are directly charged with no
question of their identification, for a heinous offence
involving moral turpitude; and supportive medical report of
the victim. The record was perused with the assistance of the

learned counsels,

5. | Undeniably, the petitioners have been directly charged
for the offence of sodomy upon the victim. The medical
report of the victim is clear inasmuch as it shows a wedge
sloped tear on anterior wall of anal canal. This prima facie
indicates that penetration has taken place, which is enough
for the commission of the offence. The mere fact that the
FSL report of the swabs is awaited is not sufficient to help
create a scope of further inquiry. Delay in such like cases
doesn’t matter much for the simple reason that the honour of
the victim and his family is involved. No one would
ordinarily falsely level the charge of such an offence to
invite social stigma such an offence tends to carry. An
additional ground is the putting of the victim in fear of
instant death through the use of the pistol by the petitioners.
Thus, on merit, there exists a prima facie case against both
the petitioners, therefore, they are not entitled to the

concession of bail.

6. The petitioners raised the plea of juvenility as well.

The medical report of the petitioner Suleman alias Nikka

3.5

reflects his age about 17 years. While the medical report of
petitioner Hizbullah reveals that he is about 16. Thus, both
the petitioners are juveniles, as defined in section 2 of the
Juvenile Justice System Act, 2018 (the Act). However, no
effort under section 8 of the Act, including by the Judicial
Magistrate before whom the petitioners were produced under
section 167, Cr.P.C., was made for determination of their
juvenility. In the cards of arrest, the petitioner Hizbullah is
shown as 15/16, and the petitioner Suleman alias Nikka as
16/17 years old, This Court, thus, has to consider the cards of
arrest and the medical reports as available material for the

purpose of tentative assessment.

7. Under subsection (3) of section 6 of the Act, for the
minor and major offences a juvenile offender shall be treated
as if accused of committing a bailable offence. However,
subsection (4) of the same provision, in the case of a heinous
offence (carrying capital punishment), a juvenile over
sixteen years of age may not be granted bail if there are
reasonable grounds establishing prima facie connection with
the alleged offence. It follows that the case of a juvenile
offender of 16 years or below would be covered by
subsection (3) of section 6 of the Act. Reliance is placed on
Sahib Ullah vy. The State through A.G. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
and_another (2022 SCMR_ 1806). For this reason, the
petitioner Hizbullah being 16 years old, stands entitled to
bail on the ground of juvenility. The petitioner Suleman
being 17, as such, above 16, could be refused bail being

charge for major offence.

8. For what has been stated above, this petition is
partially allowed. The petitioner Hizbullah is admitted to bail
on furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs. 200,000/- (Rupees
two hundred thousand) with two sureties, each in the like

amount, to the satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial

-4-

Magistrate. While the bail is declined to the petitioner

Suleman alias Nikka.

9.

In a number of cases, the higher courts have observed

that the subordinate courts and police officials are not paying

proper attention to the issue of juvenility. Needless to say, it

is mandatory as per Section 8 of the Act that they must pay

due attention to this issue. For the sake of ready reference,

the provision is reproduced below:

10.

8. Determination of age. ---(1) Where a person alleged to
have committed an offence physically appears or claims to
be_a juvenile for the purpose of this Act, the_officer-in-
charge of the police station or the investigation officer shall
make an inquiry to determine the age of such person on the
basis of his birth certificate, educational certificates or any
other pertinent documents. In absence of such documents,
age of such accused person may be determined on the basis
of a medical examination report by a medical officer.

(2) When an accused person who physically appears to be a
juvenile for the purpose of this Act is brought before a

Court under Section 167 of the Code, the Court before
granting further detention shall record its findings
regarding age on the basis of available record including the
report submitted by the police or medical examination
report by a medical officer.

(Underlines are mine for emphasis)

A plain reading of the aforesaid provisions reveals that

according to the first part, when an accused appears from his

hysical condition or claims to be a juvenile, it would be the

duty of the officer-in-charge or the investigating officer to

conduct an inquiry into his age. The phrase “physically

appears” is significant as it imposes a duty on the officer-in-

charge and/or the investigating officer to inquire into the age

of the accused, regardless of whether the accused has made

any plea of juvenility or not. For this purpose, they have to

examine documents such as the birth certificate, educational

certificates, and any other relevant documents. In the

absence of such documents, they are required to conduct a

medical examination of the accused through an authorized
Medical Officer.
-5-

11. The second part imposes a duty on the Court, before
which an accused who “physically appears to be a juvenile”
is brought under section 167 of the Criminal Procedure
Code, 1898, to record its findings regarding his age. For this
purpose, the Court must consider the record before it,
including the police report concerning the age of the accused
as determined in accordance with the first part. In the
absence of such a report, the Court should examine the report
of the Medical Officer as aforesaid.

12. It may also be helpful to observe that the issue of
determination of age of juvenile offenders has been
comprehensively dealt with by the higher courts while the
repealed Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000 was in
vogue. An important case is of Sultan Ahmad v. Additional
Sessions Judge-I, Mianwali and two others (PLD 2004 SC
758). In this case, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled:

Therefore, whenever a Court is confronted with the
question of the age of an accused person, it is incumbent
upon it to hold an inquiry and the learned Presiding
Officers should always feel free to requisition the original
record; to summon and examine the authors and the
custodians of such record and documents to determine the
genuineness of the same; to summon persons, if need be,
who on account of some special knowledge, could depose
about the age of the concerned accused person and to take
such other and further steps which could help the court in
reaching the just conclusion about the said matter. As has
been mentioned above, the issue about the age of an
accused person at trial which could result in punishment of
death, was now of vital significance and the learned
presiding officer should never hasten to decide the said
issue in a summery or a slipshod manner.

25. Medical report about the age of an accused person was
a further aid placed at the disposal of a court of law for the
purpose of determining the age of an accused person. The
opinion of medical experts could offer a valuable guide to a
learned Presiding Officer in resolving the controversy in
issue. The impression that an ossification test could be
ordered only as a last resort was not correct and was thus
not legally tenable, The reluctance of the Courts to benefit
from such a mandated material was not understandable.
Therefore, whenever, question of age of an accused person
is raised or arises he must be subjected to a medical test
unless strong reasons existed or could be offered for not
doing so. Such is the only course which is in accord with
the provisions of Section 7 of Ordinance XXII of 2000

olf

which commands that “such inquiry shall include a medical
report for determination of the age.”

13. Reference may also be made to Babar Ali v. The State

(PLD _ 2007 Lahore 650). In this case, the question of

juvenility was extensively discussed and new means of
solution were explored by resorting to what the Court called
“judicial engineering”. The Court issued the following
guidelines to the subordinate courts and the police
investigators:

First, soon after the arrest of a young person on a criminal
accusation, the arresting police officer must make a
tentative assessment as to whether the arrested young
person is a “child” for the purpose of the [JISO] 2000 or
not and, thus, can he[/she] be handcuffed, etc. or not.

Second, the concerned police officer should inquire from
the accused about his/her age and also make an appropriate
inquiry to find out whether the arrested young person is a
child under the JJSO. In doing so, the concerned police
investigator should collect or consult all possible material.
Such material may include the record of hospital, the record
pertaining to entry of birth maintained at the relevant Union
Council, the record of educational institution, the record
maintained by the National Database Registering Authority
(NADRA), Electoral Roll and the marriage (Nikah)
Registrar and a medical opinion about his/her age, if
necessary.

Third, the concerned police officer should record his
tentative opinion about the age of the young accused person
in his report under section 173 Cr.P.C to be forwarded to
the concerned Magistrate.

Fourth, the police report under section 173 Cr.P.C must
mention the plea of juvenility if set up by the young
accused person and the material collected for the tentative
assessment of age.

Fifth, on receipt of a report under Section 173 Cr.P.C, a
Magistrate must examine the entire record of the
investigation, make his[/her] own assessment of the
material relevant to the question of juvenility. If the
Magistrate finds the inquiry deficient, then he/she may hold
an inquiry of his/her own to assess the age of the young
accused person. If the Magistrate finds the young accused
person as a juvenile within the meaning of the JJSO, then if
he/she is not empowered as a Juvenile Court, shall take
cognizance of the offence and forward the case to the
concemed Juvenile Court.

Sixth, if the question of juvenility is raised before a
competent Juvenile Court, such Court must decide that
question according to the provisions of Section 7 of the
JISO.

=F

Seven, if the question of juvenility is raised before an
ordinary court, to which a case has been sent for trial, the
ordinary Court shall decide the issue ,,under subsection (2)
of section 5 of the [JJSO], 2000 through an inquiry akin to
that contemplated by section 7 of the said Ordinance.

Eight, all Magistrates and trial courts must pay special
attention to the age of the accused person before them and
must record his age in the relevant record, charge sheets
and final judgments as the matter of age is important to
issues pertaining to the forum of trial, sentence and
custody, etc.

Nine, an adverse inference may be drawn in case the plea
of juvenility is raised at a belated stage of the judicial
proceedings.

14. As noted above, the petitioners, being juvenile, should
have had their age determined by the officer-in-charge and/or
the investigating officer, regardless of his plea, in accordance
with sub-section (1) of section 8 of the Act, considering his
physical appearance as a juvenile. However, they failed to
fulfill this statutory obligation. Similarly, when the petitioner
was produced before the Judicial Magistrate in terms of
section 167 Cr.P.C, the Magistrate did not adhere to the
mandate of sub-section (2) of section 8 of the Act. It appears
that neither the subordinate Courts, nor the police officers
comply with the requirements of section 8 of the Act. It is,
therefore, imperative to direct that the subordinate Courts and
the concerned police officers shall determine the age of
persons accused of an offence who “physically appear” or
“claim” to be juveniles, strictly in accordance with section 8
of the Act.

15. Another relevant aspect is the lack of non-fulfilment of
the condition of conducting DNA test in compliance with

article 164-B, Cr.P.C. The provision reads as:

Section 164B. DNA test—(1) Where an offence under
section 376, section 377 B of the Pakistan Penal Code is
committed or attempted to have been committed or is
alleged to have been committed Deoxyribonucleic Acid
(DNA) samples, where practicable, shall be collected from
the victim, with his or her consent or with the consent of
his or her natural or legal guardian and the accused during

-8-

their medical examination conducted under section 164 A,
within optimal time period of receiving information
relating to the commission of such offence.

(2) The DNA samples collected under sub-section (1)
shall at the earliest be sent for investigation to a forensic
laboratory where at these shall be properly examined and
preserved:

Provided that the confidentially of such examination
shall at all times be observed;

16. This aspect has been emphasized in greater detail by
the Lahore High Court in a bail matter in the case of
Muhammad Ayaz Shamas y. The State and another (2020
PCr.L.J 914 [Lahore] in which the necessity of such evidence
is underlined, not only in itself, but also with reference to the
Supreme Court verdict in Salman Alvan Raja and another v.
Government of Punjab through Chief Secretary, and others
2013 SCMR 203. The Court moved a step further, stating that
the Punjab Forensic Agency (PFSA), a state-of-art forensic
facility has

designed special Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kits
(SPECKs) in accordance with internationally acclaimed
protocols and has supplied them to the Medical Officer
throughout the Punjab with guidelines for collection of
forensic evidence and its preservation and transportation.

17. This Court is of the view that the establishment of a
similar forensic facility in our province is direly need. The
learned A.A.G. is advised to take up this issue with the
officials concerned of the provincial government for

appropriate action as soon as possible.

18. This Court would take an opportunity to sensitize the
investigators, prosecutors and judges of the District Judiciary
to the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Offences Relating to
Rape) Act, 2016, by which amendments have been introduced
in various provisions of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (Act
XLV of 1860), the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1989 (Act V
-9-
of 1898), and the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 (P.O. No. 10 of
1984) for the purpose of offences relating to rape. The
Sessions Judges are directed to conduct sensitization sessions
in the monthly meetings of the judges and District Criminal
Justice Co-ordination Committees, to ensure that application
of the newly introduced law is no more ignored in the larger

interest of justice and fair trial.

19. Above are the detailed reasons of my short order of

even date.
