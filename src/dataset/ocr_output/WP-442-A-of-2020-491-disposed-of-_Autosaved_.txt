JUDGMENT

KRREKK

AHMAD ALI, J. Through the present writ petition, the
petitioner has approach this court with the following prayer:-

“On acceptance of instant writ petition,
the wife of the petitioner No. 1 namely
“Yaseena D/o Gul Zareen” be released
from the illegal and improper custody
of respondent No. 4 and be brought
before the court for her immediate
release or any other relief which this
Hon’ble Court deem fit and necessary

’

be granted to the petitioner.’

2. It is averred by the petitioners that the Nikahof
detenueMst. Yaseena Bibi was performed with petitioner No. 1,

however, the Rukhsati had not taken place and meanwhile one
Raheem Shah S/o Abdul Hakeem was murdered and it is
alleged that said murder was committed due to illicit relations
between the deceased and detenueMst. Yaseena Bibi.Petitioners
further alleged that now the respondents are bent upon to
commit murder of Mst. Yaseena Bibi in the name of family
honour and as such her recovery from the clutches of
respondent No. 4 is necessary to save her life.

3. This case was fixed for 06.05.2020, but today,
learned counsel for the respondent moved an application for
early fixation of the case as the girl/detenue was also produced
by the SHO concerned in the Court today. Learned counsel for
the petitioner, present in the court room in some other case, was
put on notice, who also got no objection on fixing the case for
today. Therefore, with the consent of learned counsel for the

parties, the case is fixed for today.

4. Alleged detenueMst. Yaseena Bibi D/o Gul Zareen
was produced by the SHO concermed and her statement was
recorded wherein she negated the allegations contained in the
instant petition and stated that she was never married or
engaged to the petitioner and she was residing with her parents
with her free-will and consent who are taking care of her. She
further stated that she also filed a complaint against the

petitioners before the learned Illaqa Magistrate Mansehra for
extending threats to her and her statement was also recorded
before the said Court. She produced copies of her complaint,
statement and copy of CNIC of her father which are exhibited
as Ex PHA, PHB and PHC respectively.

5. Learned counsel for the petitioner mainly objected
on the identification of the girl produced by the SHO concerned
by contending that she is not the detenue. For the purpose of
identification of the girl, the mother of the petitioner appeared
before the Court and stated that she was not the detenue.
However, the girl was identified by her father present in the
Court, as well as by the local police to be Mst. Yaseena Bibi.

6. Now adverting to the allegations contained in the
instant petition. The petitioners alleged that the detenue was
married to the petitioner No. 1, but no proof in this respect
could be brought on record. Similarly, it is alleged that murder
of one Raheem Shah was the result of illicit relations between
deceased and the detenue, however, the copy of FIR of the said
case, available on file does not disclose such motive. The
petitioners also apprehended danger to life of the detenue,
however, the detenue herself appeared and negated such threat
and supported her stance by submitting copies of her complaint
and statement recorded before the learned Illaqa Magistrate,

wherein she has averred that she apprehends danger at the
hands of accused. In the case of “Ali Muhammad Vs. The state
(2013 SCMR 1484)”, the august Supreme Court of Pakistan
held that:-

“Tt is evident from the facts of the
present case that Mst. Naseem Akhtar
is a grown up young lady and she is not
involved in any criminal case as an
accused person. Her consistent stand
before the Lahore High Court, Lahore
and before this Court has been that she
was not in any kind of confinement or
under any restraint while living with
her father. Although she has two rival
suitors yet she has expressed a clear
desire before this Court that she wishes
to go and live with her father namely
Ali Muhammad petitioner. We have
found it to be rather disturbing that
despite her eagerness to continue living
with her father she had been deprived
of her liberty and ordered by the
learned Judge-in-Chamber of _ the
Lahore High Court, Lahore to be
lodged at a Dar-ul-Aman and that too
for an indefinite period. It is quite
ironical and shocking that habeas
corpus proceedings before the Lahore
High Court, Lahore, which were meant
to secure release of a person from an

illegal or improper custody or
confinement, had been utilized in the
present case for depriving a free person
of her liberty and the net result
achieved was that a grown up young
lady who was not found to be in any
kind of confinement or under any
restraint had been locked up and
incarcerated within the confines of a
Dar-ul-Aman for an indefinite period!
Such an approach adopted and the
result achieved by the learned Judge-
in-Chamber of the Lahore High Court,
Lahore surely ran contrary to the very
essence and purpose of awrit or
petition for habeas corpus which is
securing freedom and not curtailing

liberty.”

Similarly, in the case of “Abdul Majid Vs. S.H.O
Police Station Shujabad (1987 SCMR 282)”, the august
Supreme Court, while dismissing the petition for leave to
appeal, held that:-

“This is a petition for special leave to
appeal from the order dated 1-11-1986
of the Lahore High Court dismissing
the habeas corpus petition of the
petitioner. The alleged detenu is a
young girl. According to the petitioner
she is above 15 years of age. The

petitioner claims that she is married to
him and is being illegally detained by
her father. It may be mentioned that a
criminal case under sections 10 and 11
of the Zina (Enforcement of Hudood)
Ordinance had been registered against
the petitioner at the instance of her

father.

2. We have heard the learned counsel
and see no good ground for interfering
with the order of the High Court. The
petition for leave is, therefore,

dismissed.”

7. Proceedings under Section 491 & 491-A Cr.P.C
are summary in nature and are not intended to go beyond the
summary consideration of the questions essentially relevant to
the alleged detention i.e. whether a detenue is to be set at liberty
and as a consequence thereof, be permitted to go with the
person of his or her own choice, or to drop the proceedings
when the detention is found legal. Court while deciding an
application under Section 491/491-A Cr.P.C is not required to
go into the question of status or relationship of the parties by
holding full-fledged trial of the counter-claims and it should
concern itself only with free will of the detenue.

8. The petitioner claims that the detenue is his wife,

however, the detenue as well as the respondent No. 4 have
totally denied the said averment. It is inappropriate and
undesirable, if not illegal, for the High Court to determine the
fate of the couple by adjudicating the validity of marriage on
the touchstone of the Injunctions of Islam, in the proceedings
under Section 491 Cr.P.C.

9. There is nothing on record to suggest that either
the detenue is in illegal custody or there is any risk to her life at
the hands of respondent No. 4. The petitioner has failed to show
any locus-standi to file instant petition because as per available
record, he has no relation with the detenue. On the other hand,
the respondent No.4 is real father of the detenue and the
detenue in her statement before the court, stated that she is
comfortable in the company of her father and is not in illegal
confinement.

10. For the reasons stated above, the petition in hand
stands dismissed.
