JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR. J- Impugned through
this Criminal revision u/s 439, Cr.P.C is the order of the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-IlI/Izafi Zilla Qazi,
Swat dated 28.09.2023 whereby the learned trial Court
appointed local commission for spot inspection along
with Tehsildar and Patwari Halga and directed the
complainant to pay Rs. 25000/- to local commission and

Rs. 10000/- to Tehsildar.

2. Resume of the facts forming background of
this petition are that petitioner Zafar Khan filed a
complaint under Section 3 & 7 of the Illegal
Dispossession Act, 2005 against respondent Saddam
Hussain and 05 other unknown accused in respect of
illegal construction on his land falling in Khata No. 294
Khasra No. 1276 of the revenue estate of Malam Jabba.
According to petitioner, he along with his sons is residing

in District Mardan and visits Swat of and on. He averred

that he visited his land on 15.06.2021 at 16:30 hours

along with his sons and driver. He noticed the illegal
construction over his land and objected the same, in
response of which respondent Saddam Hussain and five
unknown accused aimed their weapons at them. The
learned trial Court, after conducting inquiry in the
matter through local police, summoned the accused and
framed formal charge against him to which he did not
plead guilty and opted to face the trial. Petitioner
produced his evidence as directed by learned trial Court
whereafter statement of the accused u/s 342, Cr.P.C.
was recorded. After hearing the final arguments, the
learned trial Court through order dated 28.09.2023
appointed Mr. Saif-ul-Malook Advocate and Tehsildar
concerned as local commission within the meaning of
539-B, Cr.P.C for spot inspection with directions to
petitioner to deposit the fee of Rs.25,000/- for Local
Commission and Rs.10,000/- for Tehsildar respectively.
Patwari Halqa was directed to assist the local

Commission with record.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

>

Petitioner/complainant has averred in his
complaint that he is owner in possession of the
mentioned land along with his son Adnan Ali Zafar on
which the accused respondent has made illegal
construction in his absence. The learned trial Court
observed in the impugned order that the stance of

accused is unambiguous that he has no concern with

Tajamul/cs"| SB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
-3-
Khasra No. 1276 and 1277 and that his cousins are
owners in khasra No. 1277 in which they have raised
construction which has been attributed by complainant
to him. The learned trial Court further observed that the
petitioner, as per his statement, had purchased the land
through registered deed of 1980 with specification of the
boundaries. Learned Judge has held that the spot
inspection is the sole option to determine as to whether
or not the alleged construction has been made within the
boundaries mentioned in the deed relied upon by the
complainant. Local commission was directed to visit the
spot and may record the statements of adjacent owners
and if found construction within the boundaries
mentioned in the deed then to report who has made
construction. The question for this Court is whether the
trail Court could appoint a local commission under
section 539-B Criminal Procedure Code 1898 for spot
inspection. For convenience, the provision is reproduced

below.

539-B. Local inspection. (1) Any Judge or
Magistrate may at any stage of any inquiry, trial
or other proceeding, after due notice to the parties
visit and inspect any place in which an offence is
alleged to have been committed, or any other place
which it is in his opinion necessary to view for the
purpose of properly appreciating the evidence
given at such inquiry or trial, and shall without
unnecessary delay record a memorandum of any
relevant facts observed at such inspection.

2) Such memorandum shall form part of the
record of the case. If the Public Prosecutor
complainant or accused so desires, a copy of the
memorandum shall be furnished to him free of
cost.

Talamui/cs*| SB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
The philosophy of empowering the Judge or a
Magistrate of local inspection is to enable him to
appreciate the evidence given at an inquiry or trial. Plain
reading of the above provision shows that the powers of
inspection of spot cannot be delegated by trial Court to
any other officer even to a subordinate Judicial Officer
rather the exercise shall be made by the by Presiding
Officer itself. The power of local inspection may be
exercised suo-motu or on the application of a party. A
Judge or a Magistrate at any stage of the trial or inquiry
or other proceedings, after due notice to the parties, is
vested with the power to visit and inspect any place in
which either an offence is alleged to have been
committed or any other place having a nexus with the
offence committed, which “as per his opinion’ is
essential to evaluate the evidence in its true perspective.
In a case reported as Tirkah vs. Nanak (AIR 1927 All.

350), it was observed that:

“If a Magistrate makes use of knowledge derived
from a ‘local inspection’ without affording the
accused an opportunity to cross-examine or to
explain the points against him, he acts with

material irregularity sufficient to vitiate the trial”.

It was also observed that “a local inspection of
the Magistrate is permitted for the purpose of properly
appreciating the evidence in this case and cannot take the

place of evidence itself’.

In the case of Bazal Ahmed Sowdagar vs.

Nur Muhammad (PLD _1963 Dacca 852) it was ruled by

the Court that:

As is clear from the language of the section itself, a
local inspection is only permitted for the purpose
of properly appreciating the evidence in the case
and cannot take the place of the evidence itself.
That being so, the impugned order passed by the
learned Magistrate is really based on no evidence

at all.

Adverting to the question that weather the

local commission could be directed to visit the spot?

Hon’ble Shariat Court in the case of Abdul Rashid_vs.

The State and others (1999 YLR 1298) ruled that:

In order to ascertain as to whether there is
substance in the respective contentions raised by
the learned counsel, for the parties, I have myself
carefully gone through record of the case. Though
while seeking relief, no provision of law was cited
in the application, dated 3-12-1997, yet the relief
sought for therein, apparently falls under section
539-B, Cr.P.C. It appears that the learned trial
Court without bothering to go through the relevant
provision and without ascertaining scope thereof
had casually passed order, dated 8-12-1997 for
inspection of the site through Local Commissioner.
Had the learned trial Judge been a little bit vigilant
he could have avoided the situation which had
arisen subsequently. A glance at section 539-B,
Cr.P.C. would reveal that a Judge or Magistrate, at
any stage of inquiry, trial or other proceedings,
after due notice to the parties may visit and
inspect any place which in his opinion, would be
necessary for the purpose of properly appreciating

the evidence, yet there appears to be no provision

in the Code for appointment of a Commissioner to

make a local inspection.

A similar issue arose before the apex Court

in the case of “Asfandyar_ and another Vs. Kamran
and_ another” (2016 SCMR 2084). In the mentioned

case,

the trial Court appointed a Magistrate under

Section 539B, Cr.P.C. to visit the spot for ascertaining

the authenticity of the site plan. The Hon’ble Supreme

Court took notice of the aforesaid illegality and observed

that:

Section 539-B, Cr.P.C. gives power to a Judge or a
Magistrate to visit and inspect the place of
occurrence or any other place after due notice to
the parties, if necessary, in the opinion of the trial
Court, for properly appreciating the evidence given
during the trial. He was also required to record a
memorandum without unnecessary delay regarding
his observation at such inspection but this power
cannot be delegated by the trial judge to any other
subordinate or even a subordinate judicial officer.
Under section 539-B, Cr.P.C., the trial Judge had
no power to appoint another person to visit the
place of occurrence as a Commission because the
report submitted by a local Commission cannot be
equated with the memorandum mentioned in sub-
section (1) of section 539-B, Cr.P.C. The trial Judge
can inspect the place of occurrence but alone and
he cannot delegate his powers under section 539-B,
Cr.P.C. and it is exclusive domain of trial Court
under said section. Judicial power has its own
sanctity and the same cannot be entrusted to
anyone. The act of the trial Court is not curable
under section 537, Cr.P.C. as it is not an
irregularity rather was an illegality. It is quite
astonishing that the learned trial Judge, while

Tajamul/Cs* |

5B: Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
-7-

appointing a Commission under section 539-B,
Cr.P.C., did not go through the said provision and
acted mechanically upon the request of defence.
The High Court has rightly observed that such an
act of the trial Court was not only prejudicial to
the other party but also detrimental to the fairness
of the procedure provided under the Code, apart

from being without jurisdiction.

6. Main theme of the above-referred dictum is
that power under section 539-B, Cr.P.C. could not be a
substitute for collection of evidence nor the Court could
assume the status of an investigating officer. There is no
cavil with the proposition that in criminal cases the
burden is always on prosecution to prove the guilt of
accused beyond shadow of doubt while in civil matters
there is preponderance of evidence according to which a
plaintiff must show in a civil lawsuit that his explanation
of events is more likely true than the defendant. It is well
settled by now that the prosecution is bound to prove its
case against the accused beyond any shadow of
reasonable doubt, but no such duty is casted upon the
accused to prove his innocence. It has also been held by
the Superior Courts that the conviction must be based
and founded on unimpeachable evidence and certainty of
guilt, and any doubt arising in the prosecution case
must be resolved in favour of the accused. In the case

of Wazir Mohammad _ vs. The State (1992 SCMR

1134), it was held by the Supreme Court that "In the

criminal trial it is the duty of prosecution to prove its case

Tajamui/cs| $B: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
-8-

against the accused to the hilt, but no such duty is casted
upon the accused, he has only to create doubt in the case
of prosecution.” The Supreme Court in another case

of Shamoon alias Shamma_vs. The State (1995

SCMR 1377), held that "The prosecution must prove its
case against the accused beyond reasonable doubts
irrespective of any plea raised by the accused in his
defence. Failure of prosecution to prove the case against
accused, entitles him/them to an acquittal. The
prosecution cannot fall back on the plea of an accused to
prove its case. Before, the case is established against the
accused by prosecution, the question of burden of proof on
the accused to establish his plea in defence does not
arise”. Reliance is also placed on the case of Naveed
Asg har_and 2 others v. The State (PLD 2021 SC
600). Section 539-B, Cr.P.C. envisages that in case spot
inspection is deemed necessary, the trial Court shall
without unnecessary delay record a memorandum of any
relevant facts observed at such inspection. This object
cannot be achieved through appointment of a local
commission because the report submitted by a local
Commission could not be equated with the
memorandum mentioned in section 539-B (1), Cr.P.C.
The learned trial Court instead of deciding the case in
light of the evidence produced by petitioner has
committed an irregularity by appointing a_ local

commission for the purpose of collecting evidence,

therefore, the impugned order cannot legally sustain in

light of the above-referred dicta.

7. Thus, in light of what has been discussed
above, instant petition is allowed, the impugned order is
set aside and the learned trial Court is directed to decide
the case in light of the evidence brought on record

during inquiry and trial.
