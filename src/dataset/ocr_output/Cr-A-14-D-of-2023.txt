DR. KHURSHID JOBAL, J.- This appeal is
directed against the judgment dated 15,3.2023,
rendered by learned Additional Sessions Judge-III,
D.I.Khan, whereby the appellant after facing trial in
case FIR No.375 dated 07.12.2021, under Section
302/34 PPC of Police Station Kulachi, has been
convicted under section 302(b) and sentenced to
imprisonment for life and also to pay compensation of
Rs.800,000/- to the L.Rs. of deceased in terms of
Section 544-A, Cr.P.C. In default thereof, the convict
shall undergo six months simple imprisonment. He
was further convicted under Section 15 Arms Act and
sentenced to one year rigorous imprisonment with a

fine of Rs.1000/-. In default thereof, to undergo ten
=Dis

days S.I. Both the sentences have been ordered to run
concurrently. Benefit of Section 382-B, Cr.P.C. has
been extended to the convict. While co-accused was
acquitted of the charge.

2. The prosecution story as divulged from the
FIR, registered on the strength of murasila, in brief, is
that on 07.12.2021, at about 11:20 hours, complainant
Mst. Musarrat Bibi alongwith the dead body of her
son Kamran, reported to the local police in the
emergency room of civil hospital, Kulachi, that her
son Kamran, Irfan @ Rizwan and Usman run
combined business of grocery in a shop, situated in
village Looni and her son used to come to house after
Isha prayer. On 06.12.2021 at about 08:30 PM, her
son came to the house after Isha prayer for taking
meal and left the house for shop. However, he did not
come back the whole night. They kept on waiting for
him and also made call on his cell phone, but without
any response due to missing of signals. On
07.12.2021, at morning time, the door was knocked at
where the complainant was told by the co-villagers
that the dead body of her son was lying in the street
near the house of one Aslam, situated in village Looni,
Mohallah Zohakzai. On this, the complainant
alongwith her sister-in-law, namely Mst. Rozina Bibi

wife of Rozi Khan proceeded to the spot, where she

found her son murdered with firearm. The
complainant explained the reason for delay in
reporting the matter, that father of the deceased was in
WANA, so she was consulting her relatives and after
getting knowledge and confirmation regarding
involvement of the convict and acquitted co-accused,
she charged them for the commission of offence.
Motive for the offence was stated to be a dispute over
combined grocery business.

3. On completion of investigation, complete
challan against the accused was submitted before the
trial Court where at the commencement of trial, the
prosecution produced and examined as many as ten
witnesses, whereafter, statements of the accused under
section 342 Cr.P.C, were recorded wherein they
professed innocence and false implication; however,
neither they wished to be examined under section
340(2) Cr.P.C, nor opted to produce defence evidence.
The learned trial Court after hearing arguments,
convicted the appellant and sentenced him, as
mentioned above, while acquitted the co-accused from
the charge levelled against him.

4. Complainant side did not want to engage
counsel and stated to rely upon the arguments of
learned A.A.G. We have heard the learned counsel

representing the appellant and the learned Additional
-4-

Advocate General at length and with their able
assistance, the record was minutely perused.

5. There is no denial of the fact that the
incident in the present case allegedly occurred in the
night of 06.12.2021 at unknown time, where the dead
body of deceased was lying in a thoroughfare near the
house of one Aslam. According to first information
report, on the following morning i.e. 07.12.2021 at
07:00 a.m, the co-villagers came to the house of
complainant and informed her regarding presence of
the dead body of her son on the spot. While reporting
the matter on 07.12.2021 at 11:20 hours, although the
complainant charged the appellant and acquitted co-
accused for committing murder of her son by firing at
him with firearms. However, it is a matter of surprise
that while reporting the matter, she stated that she was
consulting with her relatives and afler satisfying
herself, she charged the accused for the commission of
offence. The apex Court in plethora of judgments has
held that an incident reported afier due consultation
and deliberation cannot simply be brushed aside, as
the same creates reasonable doubt regarding
involvement of an accused in the commission of
offence. So far as the observation of learned trial
Court regarding the delay occurred in reporting the

matter is concerned, suffice it to say that Jaw aids the
-5-

vigilant and not the indolent. It is also astonishing that
after getting information about the dead body of her
son at about 7:00 a.m, the complainant reported the
matter after lapse of more than four hours, while as
per record the place where the dead body was lying is
at a walking distance from the house of complainant.
Needless to mention that the dead body of deceased
was received in the hospital after lapse of four hours.

6. While going through the impugned
judgment, we have observed that the learned trial
Court while convicting the appellant was mainly
swayed with the circumstantial evidence in the shape
of recovery of empties from the spot and .30 bore
pistol, allegedly recovered on pointation of the
appellant coupled positive report of FSL in that
regard. However, before we discuss the same, it would
be appropriate to have a glance over the testimony of
complainant Mst. Musarrat Bibi, who was examined
before the trial Court as PW-6. Perusal of
examination-in-chief of the complainant reveals that
she did not name Aslam, rather mentioned the house
of neighbor, where the dead body was allegedly lying.
It is also surprising when she stated that she alongwith
her sister-in-law went to the spot and found the dead
body of her son where she lodged the report to police,

which is belied by the initial report wherein it has

-6-

been stated that the matter was reported at civil
hospital, Kulachi. The cross-examination of the
complainant is also astonishing, wherein she stated
that when they found the dead body of deceased,
police arrived to her house at about 7:00 a.m, which is
the time when she was allegedly informed by her co-
villagers about the dead body of her son. She further
stated that she in the company of her sister-in-law and
all the police officials went to the spot and remained
there till 12:30 noon. It is also an element of surprise
when she stated that the dead body also remained with
them till 12:30 noon and thereafter, the police officials
took the dead body from the spot to civil hospital,
Kulachi. The above deposition, in our firm opinion,
was not sufficient to be relied upon for sustaining
conviction of the appellant, that too, on a capital
charge, as the same is totally in conflict with the
contents of FIR and medico legal evidence.

he Additionally, another witness of the
prosecution, namely Mst. Zarina Bibi (Rozamina
Bibi) was examined before the trial Court as PW-5.
Astonishingly, she stated that on the day of occurrence
she was present in her house and it was 09:00 a.m,
when some people of the vicinity came to their house
and informed about the incident. That she went near

the house of one Aslam and found the dead body of

-7-

her nephew. That she returned back to her house from
where she went to the house of deceased and informed
mother of the deceased about the dead body. That in
the meanwhile, police came to their house and in the
company of police she alongwith the complainant
went to the spot and thereafter, to hospital, where her
son PW Akhtar Zaman and the complainant lodged
the report. The above portion of examination-in-chief
is sufficient to discard the testimony of complainant
and the story narrated in the FIR. Even statement of
this witness regarding shifting of the dead body in
police mobile/Datsun is also contradicted by the
statement of scribe of the murasila (PW-10), who
stated in his cross-examination that the dead body was
brought in a private Datsun/pickup.

8. Now six empties, allegedly recovered
from the crime scene. There is no denial of the fact
that the occurrence allegedly took place at odd hours
of night in a thoroughfare. The empties
remained unattended the whole night till the
morning and that too, in a thoroughfare of thickly
populated area. The I.O at the very inception of his
cross-examination, stated that copy of FIR was
handed over to him at about 12:00 hours and he
reached on the spot at about 12:40 hours. This

deposition is in conflict with the statement of the
~8-

complainant, who stated that she alongwith the police
officials remained on the spot till 12:30 p.m (noon).
The above discrepancy in the prosecution case could
not lightly be ignored, particularly when the trial
Court while convicting the appellant has based its
findings on the recovery of aforesaid empties. Most
importantly, the extract from Register No.19 has not
been placed on the judicial file. However, extract from
Register No.21 (Ex. PW 9/4) reveals that reference
has been made to the present FIR, where surprisingly
six empties of 7.62 bore have been mentioned
alongwith .30 bore pistol with fit magazine. In this
view of the matter, the positive FSL report regarding
six empties could not be taken into account as the
same had lost its efficacy. Needless to mention that
the empties were allegedly recovered on 07.12.2021,
which were received in the FSL on 23.12.2021.
Although the IO (PW-9) stated in his cross-
examination that empties alongwith blood-stained
cotton were handed over by him to the Moharrir at
about 17:00 hours. However, the I.O did not
remember that who transmitted the case property to
the FSL. At the end of his cross-examination, the I.O
stated that he himself sent the case property to FSL on
09.12.2021. In this respect, Asmat Ullah IHC was

examined as PW-2. He stated to have registered the

-9-

case on receipt of murasila. He received parcels
containing blood stained cotton and six empties of .30
bore which were handed over to him by the I.O on his
return from the spot. He made entry in the relevant
register. He was examined by the 1.0 under section
161, Cr.P.C, The cross-examination of this witness is
worth perusal, wherein he stated that the FIR Ex. PA
is not in his handwriting. He admitted it correct that
on the day of occurrence he was not posted as
Moharrir at Police Station Kulachi. He clearly
admitted that he did not send the case property to the
FSL, except empties and blood-stained cotton which
were handed over to him at about 06/6:15 p.m.
However, he admitted that the case property remained
in his possession only for about fifteen to twenty
minutes. When such is the state of affairs, how it
could be ascertained that who dispatched the case
property to the FSL and when it was sent to the FSL.
In this view of the matter, the belated dispatch of the
case property to the FSL is shrouded in mystery.
Needless to mention that there is contradiction
between the statements of PW-2 and PW-9 with
respect to sending the case property to the FSL. In
view thereof, the FSL report regarding the empties
and the pistol allegedly recovered on the pointation of

accused is of no avail to the prosecution, therefore,
-10-

same could not be relied upon for sustaining
conviction on a capital charge.

9. The Apex Court in case reported as

“Naveed Asghar and 2 others Vs. The State” (PLD
2021 Supreme Court 600) has held that:-

“Circumstantial evidence may
sometimes be conclusive, but it must
always be narrowly examined, In cases
that rested entirely on circumstantial
evidence, it was of the utmost
importance that the circumstances
should be ascertained with minute care
and caution, before any conclusion or
inference adverse to the accused person
was drawn. The process of inference
and deduction involved in such cases
was of a delicate and perplexing
character, liable to numerous causes of
fallacy. This danger pointed the need
for great caution in accepting proof of
the facts and circumstances, before they
were held to be established for the
purpose of drawing inferences
therefrom. A mere concurrence of
circumstances, some or all of which
were supported by defective or
inadequate evidence, could create a
specious appearance, leading to
fallacious inferences. Hence, it was
necessary that only such circumstances
should be accepted as the basis of
inferences that were, on careful
examination of the evidence, found to
be well-established. A high quality of
evidence was, therefore, required to
prove the facts and circumstances from
which the inference of the guilt of the
accused person was to be drawn”.

It was further held in the supra case that:-

“The settled approach to deal with the
question as to sufficiency of
circumstantial evidence for conviction
of the accused person was that, if, on
the facts and circumstances proved, no

«l]-

hypothesis consistent with the

innocence of the accused person could
@ be suggested, the case was fit for
conviction of the accused person on
such conclusion; however, if such facts
and circumstances could be reconciled
with any reasonable hypothesis
compatible with the innocence of the
appellant, the case was to be treated
one of insufficient evidence, resulting
in acquittal of the accused person.
Circumstantial evidence, in a murder
case, should be like a well-knit chain,
one end of which touched the dead
body of the deceased and the other the
neck of the accused. No link in chain of
the circumstances should be broken and
the circumstances should be such as
cannot be explained away on any
reasonable hypothesis other than guilt
of accused person. Chain of such facts
and circumstances had to be completed
to establish guilt of the accused person
beyond reasonable doubt and to make
the plea of his being innocent
incompatible with the weight of
evidence against him. Any link missing
from the chain broke the whole chain
and rendered the same unreliable; in
that event, conviction could not be
safely recorded, especially on a capital
charge. Therefore, if the circumstantial
evidence was found not of the said
standard and quality, it would be highly
unsafe to rely upon the same for
conviction; rather, not to rely upon
such evidence would a better and a
safer course.”

RS

In the light afore-referred case law, we
have examined the case and find that there are
numerous missing links in the circumstantial
evidence, which have been duly highlighted in the
preceding paragraphs, therefore, it is concluded that

the learned trial Court has not appreciated the
-12-

evidence in its true perspective and has committed an
error by convicting the appellant.

9. The prosecution alleged motive to be a
dispute between the accused and the deceased over a
joint grocery business, however, it did not succeed in
establishing the alleged motive and even no
independent witness was produced in that respect. The
prosecution, in all circumstances was to prove the
same. When the prosecution did not succeed in
establishing the motive, then it is for the prosecution
to suffer, as is held in case reported as "Hakim Ali Vs.
The State" (1971 SCMR-432), that the prosecution
though not called upon to establish motive in every
case, yet once it has setup a motive and failed to
establish, the prosecution must suffer consequences
and not the defence. The above view has been

reiterated in the case of "Amin Ullah Vs. The State"

(PLD 1976 SC 629), wherein, it has been observed by
their lordships, that motive is an important constituent
and if found by the Court to be untrue, the Court
should be on guard to accept the prosecution story. It
was again re-enforced by the august Supreme Court in
the case of “Muhammad Sadiq Vs. Muhammad
Sarwar” _(1997_SCMR_214). Again, on the same

principle, case laws titled “Noor Muhammad Vs.

The State and another” (2010 SCMR_ 997) and

-13-

“Amin Ali and another Vs, The State” 201] SCMR-

323) can also be referred.
10. The overall impact of what has been

discussed. above is that the prosecution has
miserably failed to establish the case against the
appellant. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed, the
impugned judgment is set aside and the appellant is
acquitted from the charge levelled against him. He
shall be released forthwith, if not required to be
detained in connection with any other criminal case.

11. Above are the detailed reasons of our short

order of even date.
