JUDGMENT

SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- Through this judgment,
we intend to decide the instant criminal appeal and the
connected Cr.R No.217-P/2022, as both the matters are
arising out of one and the same judgment dated 13.10.2022,
passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-VI/JJC/
Child Protection Court, Kohat, whereby the learned Judge
found the appellant guilty of the offence and has convicted &
sentenced, being involved in case FIR No.324 dated
25.03.2021 under sections 302 PPC /53 of Child Protection
& Welfare Act, 2010, Police Station MRS, Kohat in the
following manner;

“i, Under sections 302 (b) PPC the

appellant was convicted and sentenced

to life imprisonment and was ordered to

pay Rs.200000/- (two lac) as
compensation to each legal heirs of
deceased within the meaning of Section
544-A Cr.P.C.

ii. Under Section 365 PPC the appellant

was convicted and sentenced to five

years R.I alongwith fine of Rs.50,000/-

(fifty thousand), in default whereof she

was furthered to undergo 03 months

simple imprisonment.

iii. All the sentences’ shall run

concurrently, and benefit of Section

382-B Cr.P.C is extended to the

convict/appellant.”
2. Brief but essential facts of the case as per contents of
FIR are that complainant Farhad Hussain reported the
matter to the local police regarding the missing of his little
granddaughter, Hareem Fatima, aged about 3/4 years,
daughter of Naveed Iqbal, who went outside the house at
about 1400 hours (noon) and did not come back. The
complainant could not trace her despite search in the area.
On report of the complainant an inquiry under section 156(3)
Cr.P.C was initiated. On the next day the police received
information about discovery of the dead body of the minor
named above, at 06:30 am, from a drain near the wall of
Babri Cotton Colony and consequently captioned FIR was
registered under section 302 PPC/53 Child Protection Act
against unknown accused. During investigation Mst. Rabia
Jabeen was charged for the offence on 06.04.2021, while

complainant also charged her on 27.04.2021 through his

supplementary statement recorded before the police.
3. After arrest of the accused and completion of
investigation, complete challan was submitted in the Court.
The provisions of 265-C Cr.P.C were complied with. Charge
was framed to which she pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
In order to prove its claim, prosecution produced and
examined as many as 23 witnesses and after closure of
prosecution evidence, statement of the accused was
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C wherein she professed
her innocence. The learned trial Court, after full-fledged trial,
found the appellant guilty of the charge and convicted and
sentenced her, detail of which is mentioned in the earlier part
of this judgment, hence, this appeal.

4. We have considered the submissions of the learned
counsel for the parties and with their valuable assistance
record of the case scanned through.

5. The minor Hareem Fatima went missing on
24.03.2021, when she could not be found, the matter was
reported to the local police, by Farhad Hussain, grandfather
of the minor, which was noted in the shape of Nagal Mad
No.11 dated 24.03.2021 and on the strength of that
document an inquiry was permitted under section 156(3) of
the Criminal Procedure Code. The matter was investigated
and efforts were made to find the missing child, but the
attempts went futile. It was on the next day when the dead

body of the deceased was found, the same was collected
from the spot by the father of the deceased and was brought
to KDA hospital, Kohat, where the police officials also
arrived. On receiving the dead body of the deceased, FIR
was registered, but nobody was charged, as till that time the
accused were not known. The injury sheet and inquest
report were prepared, the dead body was sent to the doctor
for postmortem examination. The doctor after conducting
postmortem examination of the dead body of the deceased
found bruises on her hands and legs and also found bruises
around her vagina and it was also noted that the hymen was
ruptured/incision. Though, the investigating officer prepared
the site plan of the house of the complainant, from where the
deceased went missing, but no substantial progress could
be made in respect of the culprits. The investigating officer
continued with the investigation and during investigation, he
reached to a hostel, maintained by one Shah Muhammad,
as he was the warden of the hostel during those days, as
CCTV Cameras were installed, from the said hostel CCTV
footages were collected and also the DVR running the
system. When the CCTV footages were looked into and
video clips were displayed, the unfortunate deceased was
noted in the company of a woman, the woman was covered
faced putting on Burga (veil). Before the CCTV Cameras
were inspected and the DVR was taken into possession, the

investigating officer associated good number of suspects in
the process, they were investigated and their blood samples
were collected for the purpose of DNA. It is pertinent to
mention that the test samples collected from the suspects
and the vaginal swab collected from the deceased, were
sent to the Department of Forensic Medicine & Toxicology
Khyber Medical College, Peshawar for matching, but the
same did not and as such the suspects were not found
connected. The negative report prompted the investigating
officer to ask for the constitution of a Standing Medical
Board, to reconfirm the opinion given by the doctor, at the
time of postmortem examination, while honouring the
request a Standing Medical Board was constituted and to
answer the anxiety. The Board concluded that no sexual
activity was done with the minor and as such it excluded the
possibility of sexual abuse, the board formed such opinion,
as the DNA report was received in negative. The conclusion
drawn by the Board influenced the investigation, and further
probe in respect of sexual abuse and rape was discontinued,
with the only focus on the video clips and CCTV footages. In
order to preserve the evidence, the CCTV footages and the
video clips were sent via whatsapp to the mobile phone of
another police official, who is also the marginal witness of
recovery memos. It is pertinent to mention that the video
clips and the CCTV footages were sent to the expert, to

know as to whether the woman in the photographs and video
recording was the appellant. A report was received in that
respect, explaining that due to poor quality of the video
recording, no proper assessment could be made, whereas in
CCTV footages the woman could be seen, but due to
covered face, her identity was not possible. As the
investigating officer visited the hostel and recovered CCTV
footages and video recording, from the cameras installed on
the outer walls of the hostel, so he also recorded the
statement of the warden of the hostel, u/s 164 Cr.P.C, and
he was also produced before the learned Trial Court, where
his statement was recorded. The prosecution mainly relied
upon the video recording and CCTV footages and the same
was sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory for ascertaining
the identity of the lady, but the same could not be
established as the expert opined regarding the poor quality
of the video recording / clips. When the most relevant
evidence failed to convince regarding the identity of the lady
as the appellant and as the laboratory declared the collected
evidence as deficient, so we are not inclined to take the
same into consideration. The like circumstances were taken
into consideration in case titled “RASHED alias CHAND
and others Versus The STATE” (2022 P Cr. L J 664),
which reads as follows: -

“15. Prosecution has also relied upon the evidence
of CCTV footage and CDR pertaining to the cell
phones of appellants and we have also given our
considered thought to the admissibility of such
evidence. So far as, the CCTV Footage is
concerned, admittedly, it was not containing the
clear visuals of the incident and the facial features
of the culprits were also blurred. On this score
alone, the evidence of CCTV footage is destined to
be discarded. As regards, Call Data Record no
person or record keeper of the cellular company
appeared in the dock to provide legal sanctity to
such evidence, thus we are constrained to declare it
too, as inadmissible.”

6. The matter was further investigated and _ the
investigating officer came across two other witnesses, who
allegedly transported the appellant and the child to a park
known as Masood Park. The names of the witnesses
surfaced as Abdur Rasheed and Anwar Iqbal. The
investigating officer recorded their statements u/s 161
Cr.P.C and they were also produced before the court of
competent jurisdiction, where their statements u/s 164
Cr.P.C were recorded. The witnesses explained the time and
the date when the deceased and the child were picked up
and dropped. The matter does not end here, rather the
investigating officer further probed into the matter and during
investigation came across two other witnesses namely,
Abdur Raziq and Saleem Badsha. The statements of these
witnesses u/s 161 & 164 Cr.P.C were recorded. PW-Abdur
Raziq explained in his statement that on 24.03.2021, while
standing near the cotton mill, that in the meanwhile a lady
wearing borqa appeared with a minor in her hand and that
she threw the dead body in the drain. The witness further

explained that after dropping the dead body, the lady ran
away and he with the help of one Saleem Badsha informed
the complainant and the local police. He went on to say, that
the complainant came to the spot and took the dead body of
the deceased. PW-Saleem Badsha supported the statement
of PW-Abdur Raziq in respect of the manner in which the
dead body was disposed of by the lady, and the complainant
was informed, who claimed the dead body to be that of the
deceased Hareem Fatima, and took the same.

7. — The investigating officer examined two more witnesses
i.e. Kamran and Khyali Wazir, their statements were
recorded u/s 161 & 164 Cr.P.C. In his statement recorded
u/s 164 Cr.P.C, Kamran disclosed that he found the dead
body of the deceased and asked the help of PW-Khyali
Wazir in that respect. PW Khyali Wazir also supported the
version of this PW. The investigating officer on the
pointation of these witnesses prepared the sketches of
different places, where the dead body was thrown and from
where the dead body was recovered. After the arrest of the
appellant, she pointed out the place where the deceased
was done to death and the place where the dead body was
thrown. She also led the police party to her house and from
the cupboard a pair of shoe, a trouser, and a shirt (qamees),
were taken into possession. The record further tells that the
appellant claimed the same to be the one she put on, on the

day of incident. Though the shoes and garments were taken
into possession, but the same were not examined from the
expert, to ascertain as to whether the same matched with
the one put on by the lady on the day of the incident, visible
in the photographs and video clips. Apart from the above,
the CCTV footages and video clips were shown to the
appellant and as per the investigating officer, she disclosed
her presence in the same.

8. As the entire case is hinging upon the circumstantial
evidence, so few witnesses from the house of the
complainant were also examined including, Mst. Sumia, aunt
of the deceased, Hassan Fawad, uncle and Naveed Iqbal,
father of the deceased. The aunt of the deceased recorded
her statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C, where she explained the inter-
se relationship between the family of the appellant and that
of the complainant. She disclosed that on 24.03.2021, the
appellant came to her house at 10:00 AM, as she was on
visiting terms to them, she further disclosed that the
appellant was wearing the clothes and the shoes as are
visible in the CCTV footages and the video clips; that the
appellant wanted to marry her brother Hassan Fawad, but he
refused; that it was the sense of revenge which led the
appellant to kill the deceased. Mst. Sumia also recorded her
statement before the learned Trial Court. Both, Hassan
Fawad & Naveed Iqbal, recorded their statements u/s 164

Cr.P.C, and endorsed the statement of Mst. Sumia, in
10

respect of the motive and they also charged the appellant for
the death of the deceased. When the investigation was
completed, challan was submitted, the appellant faced the
trial and was convicted and sentenced vide the impugned
judgment.

9. The learned trial Court while handing down the
impugned judgment took into consideration the material
aspects of the case and applied its judicial mind to the
evidence on file and thereafter passed the impugned
judgment. True that the appellant is not directly charged and
that no direct evidence came forward to tell that it was the
appellant who killed the deceased, but equally true that the
prosecution took pain to investigate the matter and that
circumstantial evidence was collected, which ultimately led
the learned Trial Court, to hold the appellant responsible for
the murder of the deceased. We are as shocked as the
others were, but the law does not permit the courts to travel
under the influence of emotions, sympathies, and sensitivity,
as in that eventuality there would always be an
apprehension of miscarriage of justice. Under all
circumstances, the Courts of law are under the obligation to
dig out the real cause, that too, from the collected evidence.
We must not allow our emotions to dictate us, rather we
must control our emotions and sentiments, while determining

the innocence and guilt of an accused, if we failed to control,
11

then the results would be drastic and its end would be a
chaos, a catastrophe which would take away the matters out
of the ambit of the guide lines laid down by the superior
courts from time to time and in that eventuality the approach,
if any, arrived to, would be against the spirit of law, which
has never been permitted and which would never be
allowed. The learned Trial Court though found the appellant
guilty through a detailed judgment, but this being the court of
appeal, is under the obligation to revisit and re-appreciate
the collected evidence, so that the guilty could be punished
and the innocent could be rescued. We are conscious of the
fact that in this particular case, the only evidence against the
appellant, is the chain created by the prosecution by
collecting different circumstances, but we cannot ignore that
when the cases are hinging upon the circumstantial
evidence, then it is obligatory for the prosecution to knit a
well-knit chain with no link missing. We are to determine the
compactness of the chain and the connectivity of the events,
and the prosecution is to convince that no link was missing.
We are to confirm that both the ends of the chain are
touching the neck of the accused and the dead body of the
deceased. As in the instant case, on one hand the
unfortunate deceased was hardly 3/4 years of age, whereas
on the other we have a lady accused, who too, is asking for

justice. We feel that this particular case needs extra care
12

and caution, as an erroneous conclusion would add to the
miseries of all concerned.

10. The moot question for determination before this Court
is as to whether it was the appellant who killed the deceased
and that the evidence collected point with certainty, her
involvement in the episode. There is no denial to the fact that
the unfortunate victim went missing on 24.03.2021 and her
dead body was found on the very next day of the incident,
away from her house. The record further tells that nobody
was charged soon after the child went missing and instead
an inquiry was imitated u/s 156 (3) Cr.P.C, and when her
dead body was found, the FIR was registered. As the
prosecution at the very inception was clueless regarding any
particular accused, so good number of suspects were
associated with the process of investigation and the
investigating officer collected their blood samples and also
collected the blood of the deceased alongwith vaginal
swabs, the same were sent to Department of Forensic
Medicine & Toxicology Khyber Medical College, Peshawar,
for its analysis, more particularly, asking a DNA report. The
same were examined by the expert and a report was
received in negative.

11. The prosecution continued its search of tracing out the
real culprits. It was after a long chase that the prosecution

succeeded to trace out the accused and as such the
appellant was held responsible for the murder of the
deceased. The appellant was arrested, investigated and ata
belated stage the complainant also charged her for the
murder of the deceased. There is no denial to the fact that
the investigating agency probed into the matter and
succeeded in collecting CCTV footages and also the video
clips, where the deceased was found in the company of a
lady, but the lady could not be identified, as right from the
beginning till the end her face remained covered and nobody
could tell with exactness that who the lady was. It is for the
prosecution to tell that how it identified and that how it picked
up the appellant, as the one in whose company the
deceased is seen. As the prosecution based its approach,
mainly on the statements of the witnesses and the CCTV
footages, so we deem it essential to go through the
statements of the witnesses and to find out that these were
the witnesses who disclosed the identity of the lady /
appellant. Two witnesses surfaced who claimed to have
transported the deceased and the lady to a park known as
Massod Park, situated in the vicinity. PW-Abdur Rashid was
examined before the learned Trial Court, who disclosed that
on 24.03.2021 it was at 3:00 PM that he picked up a child
and a lady and dropped them at Masood Park, situated in
the vicinity. PW-Anwar Iqbal disclosed that he picked up the

deceased and a lady for Masood Park and the lady paid him
14

Rs.50/- for the trip. It is surprising to note that two different
rickshaw drivers claimed to have transported the deceased
and the lady to the same destination, on the same date and
at the same time. When the statements of these witnesses
are read in juxtaposition, no ambiguity is left that the
witnesses were in conflict, as both claimed to have taken the
deceased and the lady at the same time, on the same date,
to the park in question. This is surprising to note that what
for the lady accused went to the same place in two different
intervals and that how was it possible that both the
rickshaws took them at the same time, on the same date, to
the same place. The statements of these witnesses do not
appeal to a prudent mind, coupled with the fact, that their
statements were recorded at a belated stage. One of the
witness disclosed that he hails from district Karak and so the
complainant. On one hand the intimacy between the two is
established on record, whereas on the other his statement
was recorded at a belated stage and his statement is in
conflict with that of Abdur Rashid (PW-12), so in such
eventuality this Court is still to see the evidentiary value of
his statement. Anwar Iqbal (PW-14), in his cross
examination disclosed, that he was arrested by the local
police, he remained in their custody for three days and also
his brothers. It is pertinent to mention that his arrest is not

shown on record and his arrest and that of his brothers are
15

the circumstances which put a question mark over the
impartiality of the investigating agency in general and on the
investigating officer in particular. None of the witnesses
disclosed regarding the identity of the lady and the
investigating officer did not arrange for the identification
parade. As the witnesses could not tell regarding the identity
of the lady and as her face was not exposed, so the
appearance of these witnesses would hardly help the
prosecution, more particularly, when their statements were
recorded, after a considerable long time of the incident and
of the recovery of the dead body. The delayed statements
are often taken out of consideration by the Superior Courts,
as is held in case titled “BASHIR MUHAMMAD KHAN
Versus The STATE”, (2022 SCMR 986), which is

reproduced here in below: -

“Delayed recording of statement of PW
under section 161, Cr.P.C. reduces its value
to nil unless and until it is explained
rendering justiciable reasonings. Reliance is
placed on the judgment reported as Abdul
Khaliq v. The State (1996 SCMR 1553). This
judgment was followed by this Court in
another judgment reported as Noor
Muhammad v. The State (2020 SCMR 1049)
as also in an unreported judgment passed in
Criminal Petition No. 537/2021. Keeping in
view the conduct of the PWs, it would not be
safe to only rely upon their statements to
sustain conviction of the appellant and there
must be some independent corroboration to
the extent of his involvement in commission
of the crime.”

12. Two other persons namely, Abdul Razak and Saleem
Badsha, were examined, their statements were recorded

initially u/s 164 Cr.P.C, and thereafter before the learned
Trial Court. In their statements recorded u/s 164 Cr.P.C the
witnesses confirmed that on 24.03.2021 while present near
the cotton mill a lady wearing borqa, arrived with the dead
body of the deceased; that she threw the dead body in a
drain situated near the mill and ran away; that they informed
the local police; the complainant arrived to the spot and
collected the dead body. This is surprising that both these
witnesses having stout bodies did not resist the throwing of
the dead body and no efforts were made to overpower the
lady. Had this been so, then under all circumstances the lady
would have been overpowered, but she was not and this part
of the story does not appeal to a prudent mind. Even these
witnesses failed to tell that they saw the face of the lady and
that they can identify if she is brought before. On one hand
the identity of the lady is still a mystery, whereas on the
other the conduct displayed by the witnesses does not
appeal to the judicial mind of this Court. The statements of
these witnesses were recorded after a good length of time
and even they failed to communicate the incident to the local
police, on the stated day. We are yet to know, that if these
were the witnesses in whose presence the dead body was
thrown and in whose presence the dead body was collected,
we are still to know that whether the dead body was taken
into possession in presence of these witnesses or in

presence of the other two namely Kamran and Khyali Wazir.
17

Both the sets of witnesses claimed its recovery on their
pointation, so when the two set of witnesses are placed in
juxtaposition, the one negates the other. When the
witnesses went in conflict regarding the knowledge and
regarding the recovery of the dead body, their this conflict
has further complicated the situation and it has further
damaged the veracity of the investigating agency. The
record also tells that the statements of these witnesses were
recorded after a long delay and the prosecution could not
explain that why the delay occurred.

13. After arrest of the appellant, she was investigated and
during that period she pointed out various places. It was
allegedly on pointation of the appellant that the sketches of
the places where the deceased was killed and where the
dead body of the deceased was thrown, were prepared, but
during the entire proceedings no private witness was
associated and even the investigating officer did not ask the
presence of those witnesses, in whose presence the dead
body was thrown. As during her custody no substantial
progress could be made and no incriminating article was
recovered either from her possession or on her pointation,
but only a pair of shoe and the garments, which she
allegedly claimed to be putting and wearing on, on the day of
the incident, were taken into possession. True that a pair of

shoe and garments were taken into possession, but equally
18

true that the same were never sent to the expert, to compare
the same with the one shown in the photographs and in the
video clips. When the investigating officer failed to test its’
veracity and when the same were not sent to the expert for
comparison, then in such eventuality, mere recovery of a
pair of shoe and garments would hardly help the
prosecution, more particularly, to identify the lady, as the
appellant. As the lady in the pictures was with covered face
and as no witness could tell that they had the opportunity to
see her face, so in such eventuality the identity of the lady
right from the beginning till the end remained a mystery and
the prosecution failed to clarify the same. Though the
investigating agency at the very earliest took the lady to be
the appellant, but the complainant and all related, were not
ready to accept the same. Admittedly, the dead body was
recovered on 25.03.2021 and the appellant was held
responsible, by the prosecution, soon after the dead body
was recovered, but the complainant was not ready to
charge, as he was uncertain regarding the involvement of
the appellant. To our understanding there was a struggle
between the law enforcing agency and the complainant,
regarding the involvement of the appellant, as the one was
confirmed that it was the appellant who killed the deceased
and the other was not convinced. It was the indecisiveness

on the part of the complainant which led to a belated charge.
The belated charge by the complainant and by the family
members of the deceased is a circumstance which cannot
lightly be ignored. One Mst. Sumia was examined as PW-11,
who was no other than the real aunt of the deceased, but
even she surfaced at a belated stage. This witness was
cross examined on material aspects of the case, but she
could not tell that the lady in the pictures was the appellant,
rather she admitted that the face of the lady was not visible.
True in her examination in chief she disclosed that on the
day of incident the appellant had visited her house at 10:00
AM and that she was wearing the same shoes and the same
clothes at the time of her visit to her house, but this by itself
is not sufficient to hold the appellant responsible for the
killing of the deceased. As on one hand the statement of this
witness was recorded after a long delay, that too, when she
failed to identify the lady in the pictures. The father of the
deceased was examined as PW-19, who confirmed the
motive part of the incident and his brother Hassan Fawad, in
whom the appellant was interested, also confirmed that it
was his refusal to marry which turned to be the basis for
killing. The explanation tendered by the witnesses is neither
supported by the circumstances, nor could the investigating
officer record any independent statement in that respect. We
are confirmed that the alleged motive is the brainchild of the

witnesses and that of the complainant, which by no stretch of
20

imagination would alone be _ sufficient to convict the
appellant.

14. Admittedly, the prosecution is not in possession of any
direct evidence, rather the entire superstructure has been
erected on the circumstantial evidence, so the prosecution is
under the boundened duty to create a well connected chain
with no link missing. In order to appreciate as to whether the
prosecution succeeded in reaching to the neck of the
appellant, we deem it essential to take into consideration the
most relevant aspects of the case which to our
understanding were the medical report of the deceased, the
statements of the witnesses who saw the accused while
throwing the deceased and the recoveries on the pointation
of the appellant. As admittedly no witness could tell
regarding the identity of the lady and as admittedly no
identification parade was conducted, so the question of
identity of the appellant could not be resolved and so the
statements of those witnesses played a little role in that
respect. The doctor who conducted autopsy on the dead
body of the deceased, disclosed numerous injuries on the
body of the deceased and that the nature of injuries was fully
explained, as is evident from the following: -

External Appearance:Mark of ligature on neck and
dissection etc: There was pink colour of clothes, small
child of 3-4 years with PM rigidity developed.

Condition of subject: Small child of 3-4 years with post
mortem rigidity bruises on face, nose and neck.

Wounds:
21

Bruises on face, nose and neck.

Bruises on legs, thigh and knees abraided.

Bruises around the vaginal orifice.

Hymen raptured / not present at all.

No frothing nasal orifices and mouth, however washer
woman signs in the hands and soles due to submersion in
water.

QI PON>

As admittedly vaginal swabs were collected and blood
sample of various suspects were obtained, but both the
samples did not match and as such the DNA report was
received in negative. As the doctor disclosed that the hymen
was ruptured and as the doctor noted bruises around the
vaginal orifice, so in such eventuality, an indication was
there that apart from the lady visible in pictures, some male
accused also participated, but instead of proceeding further
in that direction, the investigating officer asked for the
constitution of the Standing Medical Board. The board was
constituted and an opinion was rendered. The application
was addressed to Dr. Fazal-ur-Rehman, the Medical
Superintendent of the concerned hospital, and as such he
constituted the Standing Medical Board. The said doctor was

examined as PW-21, who explained in the following manner:

“no exhumation was conducted by the medical
board or directed by the court. It is correct that
we or any member of the board has not
personally examined the dead body of the
minor deceased. It is correct that we the board
had given general opinion in our report which
is called “verbal autopsy” on the basis of
postmortem report and department of forensic
medical and. Khyber Medical Peshawar self-
stated that the detail examination was
conducted by the lady doctor”.
22

On receiving the opinion, the investigating officer did not
proceed further in that direction and as such he concentrated
over the involvement of a single lady accused in the murder
of the deceased. As on one hand the submission of an
application for the constitution of a Standing Medical Board
was beyond understanding, whereas on the other the report
failed to convince and even the deposition of the doctor has
questioned the veracity of the board and the conclusion
drawn. When admittedly the dead body was not before the
board and when admittedly the board based its opinion over
the observation of the doctor, who conducted autopsy of the
dead body of the deceased, then in our understanding the
report is neither conclusive nor the same is the outcome of
the independent application of mind, by the members of the
board. We are surprised that what convinced the board to
take a different view from the one taken by the doctor and
that how the sexual abuse or rape with the victim could be
excluded. If the mind of the board was satisfied from the
observations of the doctor, which she rendered at the time of
postmortem examination, then in our understanding the
prosecution should have proceeded further in that direction,
but it did not, which gives birth to two possibilities, either the
prosecution wanted a hasty conclusion or that it was the
severe criticism from the people of the area, regarding the

performance and efficiency of the department, which
23

prompted the investigating officer to cut the matter short, but
the investigating officer forgot that his this approach may
lead to the conviction of an innocent person. As the
prosecution postponed to proceed and to confirm the death
of the deceased in light of the observations, rendered by the
doctor, so to our understanding the prosecution fell into
error, as the medical report confirms the involvement of
other accused as well. The nature of injuries on the dead
body of the deceased would negate the story of the
prosecution and it speaks in louder tone that had the
appellant killed the deceased, then the nature of injuries
would have been other than the noted one, as a female
accused with this kind of motive in mind, would hardly
struggle to cause such injuries. The attending circumstances
of the present case do tell that the deceased was the victim
of sexual assault and that the appellant alone would hardly
do the same. As the prosecution exercised its option, for
closing the most relevant aspect of the case, so his this
choice has added to the miseries of the complainant and that
of his family.

15. Admittedly, the prosecution case is hinging upon the
circumstantial evidence and admittedly the circumstances so
collected failed to create a well knit chain, so the links are
missing and the missing links would hardly call for

conviction. As till the end neither the witnesses nor the
24

investigating officer could uncover the face of the lady, in
whose company the deceased was found, so the identity of
the lady could not be established and even no witness
claimed to have seen the lady, as her face was covered and
no identification parade was arranged for the purpose, when
so then this Court is confident in holding that the prosecution
failed to connect the appellant with the murder of the
deceased. Apart from the above, the recovered garments
and shoes were not examined by the expert, to know as to
whether the same had any resemblance with the one put on
by the lady in the pictures, then in such eventuality this piece
of evidence could not be assessed and analyzed and as
such, it has further created dents in the prosecution case. As
in the instant case no ocular account could be produced, so
the case against the appellant is based on circumstantial
evidence and in such eventuality the investigating officer
was under the boundened duty to collect circumstantial
evidence, so that a well-knit chain could be formed, but right
from the beginning till the end the identity of the lady could
not be established, which is the missing link and as such, the
broken links could not be connected which would indicate
the involvement of the appellant in the murder of the
deceased. In this regard, wisdom can also be derived from

the judgment rendered in case titled “FAYYAZ AHMAD
25

Versus The STATE” (2017 SCMR 2026), wherein it was
held that:

“5.To believe or rely on_ circumstantial
evidence, the well settled and deeply entrenched
principle is, that it is imperative for the
Prosecution to provide all links in chain an
unbroken one, where one end of the same
touches the dead body and the other the neck of
the accused. The present case is of such a nature
where many links are missing in the chain.”

16. The overall atmosphere of the case makes it clear that
the prosecution case is full of doubt and that a single doubt,
if created or appears, would be sufficient for dislodging of the
erected structure. As in this particular case not only a single
doubt, but many doubts are available, so in our
understanding the benefit must only & only be extended to
the accused / appellant. Furthermore, the evidence collected
by the investigating officer failed to convince and the
witnesses appeared could not explain the incident, in the
manner as it occurred and even the witnesses in whose
presence the dead body was thrown, failed to tell that they
identified the lady, who disposed of the dead body. As the
circumstantial evidence is lacking coherence and as the
conscious attempt of the investigating agency, has put this
Court on guard regarding, the status of the appellant and her
involvement in the instant case, so to our understanding the
collected evidence is not sufficient to answer the claim of the
complainant. The circumstantial evidence so collected, failed

to connect the appellant with the murder of the deceased
26

and the complainant failed to point out the guilt of the
appellant. The Apex Court was pleased to answer the like
situation in case titled “FAYYAZ AHMAD Versus The
STATE” (2017 SCMR 2026), wherein it was held that:

“To carry conviction on a capital charge it is
essential that courts have to deeply scrutinize the
circumstantial evidence because fabricating of
such evidence is not uncommon as we have noticed
in some cases thus, very minute and narrow
examination of the same is necessary to secure the
ends of justice and that the Prosecution has to
establish the case beyond all reasonable doubts,
resting on circumstantial evidence. "Reasonable
Doubt" does not mean any doubt but it must be
accompanied by such reasons, sufficient to
persuade a judicial mind for placing reliance on it.
If it is short of such standard, it is better to discard
the same so that an innocent person might not be
sent to gallows, To draw an inference of guilt from
such evidence, the Court has to apply its judicial
mind with deep thought and with extra care and
caution and whenever there are one or some
indications, showing the design of the Prosecution
of manufacturing and preparation of a case, the
Courts have to show reluctance to believe it unless
it is judicially satisfied about the guilt of accused
person and the required chain is made out without
any missing link, otherwise at random reliance on
such evidence would result in failure of justice.”

17. The cumulative effect of what has been stated above
leads this Court nowhere but to hold that the prosecution
failed to bring home guilt against the appellant and that the
learned Trial Court fell into error while handing down the
impugned judgment. The impugned judgment is lacking
substance and the reasons given do not find support from
the evidence on file, the same calls for interference. The
instant criminal appeal is allowed and the appellant is

acquitted of the charges, she shall be released forthwith if
27

not required to be detained in connection with any other
criminal case

18. Now diverting to the connected Criminal Revision
No.217-P/2022, through which the complainant has asked
for enhancement of the awarded sentence. As the appeal
against conviction has succeeded and as the appellant
earned acquittal, so in such eventuality the instant criminal
revision for the enhancement of the awarded sentence has
lost its utility and the same is dismissed as such.

19. Above are the detailed reasons for our short order of
even date.
