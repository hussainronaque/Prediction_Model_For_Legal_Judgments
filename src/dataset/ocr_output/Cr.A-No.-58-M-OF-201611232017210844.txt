4. Vide order dated 13.11.2017, this
Court directed learned counsel parties as well
as learned A.A.G. to assist this Court on the |
point of maintainability of this appeal in view
of the formal charge which was framed under
Section 17(4) of the Offences Against
Property (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance,
1979 while conviction was recorded under
Section 302(b) and 392 PPC read with 13

A.O.

5 While assisting this Court on the
point of maintainability of the present appeal,
learned counsel for the appellants contended
that the Court which assumed appellate
jurisdiction, had the authority to hold, with
application of mind, that the charge had been
framed either rightly or wrongly. He further
argued that the case fell under Sections 302,
392/34 P.P.C, therefore, charge was wrongly
framed under Section 17(4) of Offences
Against Property (Enforcement of Hudood)
Ordinance, 1979 and this Court has got the

jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. He placed

reliance on 2015 P Cr. L J 203 (Federal

Shariat Court] and 2015 MLD 155 (Federal

Shariat Court,

6. As against that learned counsel
for the complainant as well as learned A.A.G.
argued that formal charge was framed against
the appellants under Section 17(4) of Offences
Against Property (Enforcement of Hudood)
Ordinance, 1979, and they were tried by the
trial court for the same offence, therefore, they
should have approached the proper forum
while assailing their conviction and sentence.
Reliance was placed on 1984 SCMR_129

(Shariat Bench), PLD 1999 Supreme Court
1063, 2010 YLR 657 (Lahore), 2017 YLR 835

(Pehsawar), 2017 YLR 888 (Karachi), PLD
2016 Karachi_191 and 2014 YLR 288

(@eshawar).

Zz We have considered the above
rival submissions of learned counsels for the
parties and learned A.A.G and gone through

the record.
8. Record would reveal that on

22.03.2014 formal charge was framed against

Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 58-M of 2016 Sangeen Khan and one other Vs. The State and one other)
Tajamul/PS*

the appellants inter alia under Section 17(4) of
the Offences Against Property (Enforcement
of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979 and they were
tried for the said offence. The trial culminated
into their conviction under Section
302(b)/392/34 P.P.C and they were awarded
death sentences. The appellants have assailed
their conviction and sentence through this
appeal the maintainability whereof has been
made disputed by learned counsels for the

complainant and learned A.A.G.

9. Prior to discussion on the point of
maintainability in light of the relevant case
law, I would replicate for the sake of
convenience the second proviso to Section 24
of the Offences Against Property
(Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979

which is relevant.

“Provided further that an offence
punishable under section 9 or section
17 shall be triable by a Court of
Sessions and not by a Magistrate
authorized under section 30 of the said
Code and an appeal from an order
under either of the said sections or
from an order under any provision of
this Ordinance which impose a
sentence of imprisonment for a term
exceeding two years shall lie to the
Federal Shariat Court”.

10. While dealing with the case of

“Muhammad _ Sharif V/s. The State” (PLD

1999 Supreme Court 1063), the Hon’ble apex

Court made an elaborate discussion with
regard to proper forum for entertaining
appeals against the judgments rendered in the

liked nature cases.

“The amendment so introduced in the
second proviso to Article 27 of the
prohibition Order and section 24 of the
Offences against Property ordinance
made the Federal Shariat Court
appellate forum against the orders
imposing punishment of more than two
years imprisonment. Legislative
history of these enactments, as was
rightly pointed out by the learned
Judge of High Court of Sindh,
Karachi, shows that the jurisdiction of
the Federal Shariat Court was
enlarged progressively and even now it
is confined to a certain category of
cases mentioned in the second proviso
and that the jurisdiction to hear appeal
against other judgments i.e conviction
entailing less than two years
imprisonment or acquittal must
necessarily be covered by provisions of
the Code of Criminal Procedure. They
are, however, not right in holding that
appeal against any order of acquittal
would lie to High Court and not to
Federal Shariat Court”.

In another judgment rendered in
the case of “Muhammad_Abbas V/s. The
State” (1984 SCMR 129), the august Supreme

Court held that:-

OB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 58-M of 2016 Sangeen Khan and one other Vs. The State and one other)
TajamuvPs*

“The next objection was in regard to
the competency of the reference before
the Federal Shariat Court, as
according to learned counsel the
reference for confirmation of the death
sentence on a murder charge could lie
only before the High Court. In this
connection, he pointed out that in fact
an appeal (Criminal Appeal No. 171 of
1983) had already been preferred
before the High Court and was still
pending there. As the trial by the
Court of Session under the provision of
the Ordinance was competent, the
appeal would lie only before the
Federal Shariat Court in view of the
fourth proviso to section 20 (P L D
1967 S C 425) and a reference for
confirmation of the death sentence, to
that Court would be competent under
subsection (1976 P Cr. L J 545) of the
said section. The objection too had
been rightly rejected by the Federal
Shariat Court”.

In the light of the above referred
judgment of the apex Court, the Lahore High
Court while confronting with almost similar
situation in the case of “Ghazanfar Ali V/s.
The_State” (2010 YLR 657) [Lahore] held

that:-

“5, Since the appellant was also
charged and tried under Section 17
(Haraba) of Offences Against Property
(Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance
VI of 1979 notwithstanding the fact
that he was acquitted from the charge
under the Hudood Ordinance but
convicted only under Pakistan Penal
Code, the appeal would lie to the
Federal Sharit Court and not before
this Court in view of the law laid down
by the Honourable Supreme Court in
case of Muhammad Abbas V/s. The
State 1984 SCMR 129 and Federal
Sharit Court decision in Fazal Din’s

case PLD 1983 FSC 33 and thus the
appeal of the convict would lie before
the Federal Shariat Court and a
reference for confirmation of death
sentence would also competent before
the said Court”.

Similar is the view of this Court
in the judgment rendered in the case titled
“Khushdil V/s. The State” (2017 YLR 835,
wherein reliance was placed on various
judgments of the apex Court including the
above referred dicta. The relevant para of the

judgment reads as under:-

“5, The order of conviction was
challenged through the instant jail
appeals before this Court, under
misconception that the appellants have
been convicted and sentenced under
the Pakistan Penal Code.
Undisputedly, the charge against the
appellants was framed under section
17(4) Haraba of the Offences Against
Property (Enforcement of Hudood)
Ordinance, 1979. The august Supreme
Court of Pakistan has settled the law in
cases titled Muhammad _Abbas_and

another y. The State (1984 SCMR_ 129),
Atta _Muhammad _y. The State (1984

SCMR 1109), Muhammad Sharif v. The
State (PLD 1999 SC_1063) and Khizar
Hayat v. Noor and others (2004 SCMR
209), according to which if an accused
person is charged with an offence
under the Hudood Laws, then in case
of conviction or acquittal the forum of
appeal would be the Federal Shariat
Court and not the High Court. The
Shariat Appellate Bench of august
Supreme Court of Pakistan
Jurisdiction in Sharif Khan's case on
scanning the entire law on the subject,
was pleased to hold that in such a
situation for the purpose of Prohibition

Order and Ordinance VI of 1979, the
word referred in section 417, Cr.P.C.
in the context would mean the Federal
Shariat Court and the appeal filed
before the Federal Shariat Court
would be competent. The above
referred view was reiterated by the
Sindh High Court in case titled Ijaz and

another v, The State (2016 P Cr. LJ 130)
and it was held that through the FIR

and charge were framed under the
Hudood laws but the sentence was
awarded under the P.P.C. Mere
passing of sentence under "Tazir" was
not the determining factor for forum of
appeal, rather it would be the "charge"
that determined the forum of appeal”.

il. In the backdrop of the above
discussion in the light of the persistent view of
the superior Courts, the present appeal against
conviction is not competent before this Court
and the proper forum for entertaining it is the
Federal Shariat Court. The case law referred
by learned counsel for the appellant cannot be
relied upon for the reason that from the very
inception the cases referred above were
ordinary offences under the Pakistan Penal
Code while in the present case the appellants
have also been convicted under Section 392

P.P.C for snatching the car of the deceased.

send the case file to Additional Registrar (J) at
