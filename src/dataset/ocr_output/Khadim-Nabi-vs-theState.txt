JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- At a trial held by learned
trial Court/Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Nowshera,
accused Khadim Nabi, having been found guilty of
committing murder of Saifullah deceased has been
convicted under section 302 (b) PPC and sentenced to
undergo imprisonment for life as Ta’azir and to pay
Rs.2,00,000/-, as compensation to legal heirs of the
deceased in terms of section 544-A Cr.P.C., in case FIR
No.168 dated 28.03.2010, registered under sections
302/324/34 PPC, at Police Station Akbarpura, District
Nowshera vide judgment dated 27.07.2016.

2. The convict has filed the instant appeal against his
conviction and sentence, whereas, Rasheed-ur-Rehman, the

petitioner/complainant has filed connected Cr.R. No.
105-P/2016, seeking enhancement of sentence of the
convict/respondent from life imprisonment to normal
penalty of death as provided for the offence under the
statute.

3. As, both the matters are arising out from one and
the same judgment of the learned trial Court dated
27.07.2016, therefore, we propose to decide the same
through this common judgment.

4. The prosecution case is that on 28.03.2010 at
19.15 hours, Rasheed-ur-Rehman complainant (PW.5), in
company of Wali Ullah (PW.6) and dead body of his son
Saifullah deceased reported in Police Station Akbarpura to
the effect that on the eventful day i.e. 28.03.2010, he along
with his deceased son and PW Wali Ullah was going to his
relative’s house, namely, Hazrat Umar. At 0815 hours,
when they reached Maskin Chowk of village Kurvi
Akbarpura, the appellant and his co-accused Fazal Nabi,
duly armed with firearms already present there, opened fire
at them, as a result, the deceased got hit and died at the
spot, whereas, he (the complainant) and PW Wali Ullah
luckily remained unscathed. A dispute over landed
property has been advanced as motive behind the
occurrence. His report was incorporated into FIR
(Exh.PW.11/1) by Safdar Khan S.I. (PW.11), which was

verified by PW Wali Ullah.
5. Safdar Khan SI (PW.11), prepared injury sheet and
inquest report of the deceased and sent the dead body of
the deceased to the mortuary for post mortem examination
under the escort of Constable Ajmal No.788.
Dr. Muhammad Hanif Sadiqui (PW.3), conducted autopsy
on the dead body of the deceased on the same day at 10.30
a.m. and furnished autopsy report Exh.PM. He opined the
probable time between injuries and death as
“Instantaneous” while between death and autopsy as
02 hours. According to his opinion, the deceased died due
to firearm injuries to his vital organ i.e. heart.

6. Shabir Hussain SI (PW.10) conducted
investigation in the case. He proceeded to the spot and
prepared site plan Exh.PW.10/1 on the pointation of the
eyewitnesses. During spot inspection, he secured
bloodstained earth from the place of the deceased Exh.P.2
vide recovery memo Exh.PW.9/1 and 16 crime empties of
7.62 bore Exh.P.4 freshly discharged from the places of the
accused vide recovery memo Exh.PW.9/3. Vide recovery
memo Exh.PW.9/3 he took into possession the last worn
bloodstained garments of the deceased vide recovery
memo Exh.PW.9/2. He sent the bloodstained articles to the
FSL, report whereof is Exh.Pw.10/3, recorded statements
of the PWs u/s 161 Cr.P.C., initiated proceedings under
section 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. against the accused and on

completion of investigation, handed over case file to the
SHO who submitted challan against the accused under
section 512 Cr.P.C..

7. On arrest of the appellant and completion of
investigation challan was submitted against him before the
learned trial Court where he was charge sheeted to which
he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To prove its case
the prosecution examined as many as eleven witnesses.
After closure of the prosecution evidence, statement of the
appellant was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein
he denied the prosecution allegations and professed
innocence. He wished to be examined on oath, however,
refused to produce evidence in defence. His statement on
oath under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. was recorded and on
conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court, after hearing
both the sides convicted and sentenced the appellant as
mentioned above.

8. We have heard the exhaustive arguments of
learned counsel for the parties and perused the record with
their valuable assistance.

9. Record divulges that the occurrence has taken
place on 28.03.2010 at 0815 hours, which has been
reported by complainant Rasheed-ur Rehman (PW.5) with
promptitude at 0915 i.e. within one hour wherein he has
directly charged the appellant and co-accused Fazal Nabi
with specific role of firing at them and the deceased.

Report of the complainant has been verified by eyewitness
Wali Ullah (PW.6). The promptly lodged report is the first
circumstance which not only eliminates the probability and
possibility of consultation and deliberation on the part of
the complainant party in charging the accused but also
lends support to the statement of complainant and
eyewitness viz PW.5 and PW.6, respectively. Being a
broad daylight occurrence and parties closely related to
each other, diminish the possibility of mistaken identity.
Both complainant Rasheed-ur-Rehman (PW.5) and Wali
Ullah (PW.6), have furnished the ocular account of the
incident. The former while appearing as (PW.2) reiterated
the same episode/version of the occurrence as set forth by
him in his initial report/FIR and charged the appellant and
his co-accused for murder of the deceased and an attempt
at their lives with firearms.

10. Eyewitness Wali Ullah, while appearing as (PW.6)
corroborated the testimony of complainant (PW.5). He
disclosed the fact that complainant is his maternal uncle
while the accused/appellant is his paternal cousin. He
deposed that on the day of occurrence he along with
Safiullah deceased and Rasheed ur Rehman was going to
the house of their relative, namely, Umar and when
reached the place of occurrence i.e. Miskeen Chowk village
Kurvi, the appellant and his co-accused duly armed with
firearms already present there opened fire at them, as a

result, the deceased got hit and died on the spot, whereas,
they narrowly escaped unhurt. He charged the appellant
and co-accused for commission of the offence. His
un-shattered statement regarding shifting of the dead body
of the deceased to Police Station where complainant lodged
report in the shape of FIR and his verification of the same
established his presence at the spot. In the same manner his
undeniable assertion about equal relation with both the
parties precludes the curiosity and concern of interested
witness. It is also on record that he identified the dead body
of the deceased before the police and doctor and to this
effect he signed the inquest report which further
supplements his association with the dead body from the
place of occurrence to the Police Station.

11. We have noted that both the eyewitnesses have
been subjected to lengthy and taxing cross-examination by
the defence but nothing beneficial to appellant could have
been be extracted from them. They remained stuck to their
stance and corroborated each other on all material events of
the incident such as the day, date, time and place of
occurrence and firing of the accused at them and the
deceased. Certain un-explained events of the occurrence
were clarified in their cross-examination by the defence
itself. Motive as alleged in the FIR was also proved by the
defence itself by putting a positive suggestion to PW Wali
Ullah to which he replied that the accused had a land

dispute with the deceased which was not resolved till the
date of occurrence. The appellant while making statement
on oath under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. has also affirmed that
the deceased Saifullah was demanding share of his
maternal grandmother from him and his brother co-
accused. The relevant part of his statement is reproduced
below:-

“The deceased had dispute with me upon the

land that is jointly owned by my father along

with his brothers and sister Iqbala i.e. on

undivided land. Mst. Iqbal my aunt was the

maternal grandmother of deceased Saifullah. The

deceased Safiullah was demanding share of his

maternal grandmother from me and my other

brothers”.
The promptly lodged report of complainant verified by PW
Wali Ullah coupled with the fact that the latter has
identified the dead body of the deceased before the police
and doctor at the time of occurrence are sufficient strong
circumstances which proves presence of the complainant
and eyewitness Wali Ullah at the spot at the time of
occurrence. So far as the question as to why only the
deceased was targeted and the PWs were let off is
concerned, if the available evidence is scrutinized it would
reveals that the appellant had direct motive with the
deceased Saifullah. The appellant Khadim Nabi in his

statement recorded as DW.1 under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C.
has categorically admitted that deceased had dispute with
them on the land jointly owned by his father, his brothers
and sister Mst. Iqbala. The said Mst. Iqbala was the aunt of
the appellant and maternal grandmother of deceased
Saifullah. The appellant further deposed that Saifullah
deceased was demanding the share of his maternal
grandmother from him and his brothers. This part of
statement of the appellant proves the motive part of the
prosecution case and does appeal to a prudent mind that
deceased was the only target of the accused and not the
complainant and PW Wali Ullah. Even in cross
examination of PW Wali Ullah it has been brought by the
defence itself that appellant is his paternal cousin of PW
Wali Ullah and he has cordial relation with him. The ocular
account furnished by the complainant and PW Wali Ullah
is trustworthy and confidence inspiring and the defence
failed to shatter their veracity and credibility. Both the
eyewitnesses are consistent with each other on all material
particulars of the occurrence.

12. No doubt, PW Rasheed-urRehman complainant is
father of the deceased and PW Wali Ullah is his maternal
cousin, but it is now almost a trend that public is reluctant
to appear and depose before the court, especially against
the culprits in criminal cases due to fear of enmity etc. It is
well established principle of law that testimony of a

witness which is trust worthy and inspiring confidence
cannot be discarded on the ground of his close relation
with the deceased. A close relative, if proved to be the
natural witness of the occurrence, cannot be termed as
interested witness. The term “interested” postulates that the
person concerned must have some direct interest in seeing
the accused person being convicted somehow or the other
either because of animosity or for some other reasons.
Thus, mere relationship of PWs with the deceased would
not detract from their veracity, as they had absolutely no
motive of his own to involve the appellant falsely by
letting off the real culprits. Reliance in this regard can be
placed on the judgments of the august apex court in case,
titled, “Saeed Akhtar and others Vs the State” (2000
SCMR 383). In case titled, “Amal Sherin and another Vs
the State through A.G.” (PLD 2004 Supreme Court
371), the Hon’ble Supreme Court while dilating upon the
evidentiary value of statement of related witnesses has
ruled as under:-

“The trial Court was not justified to reject
eyewitness account furnished by
complainant Khan Amir PW and Hakim Gul
PW merely on the ground of being related
and interested particularly when appellants
had not been able to establish on record that
the above mentioned witnesses had
nourished any grudge or ill will against them

and deposed with a specific motive”.
10

No doubt, 16 crime empties of 7.62 bore recovered from
the crime spot, have not been sent to the FSL but this
pieces of evidence corroborative in nature would not
advance the case of defence because after the occurrence
the appellant went into hiding thereby making the recovery
of crime weapon difficult, while on the other hand, the
ocular account furnished by the eyewitnesses being trust
worthy and confidence inspiring is believable, therefore, in
such eventuality there would be hardly any need of any
corroboratory pieces of evidence which are always taken
into consideration as a matter of caution. In support of our
findings we would rely upon the judgment of the Hon’ble
apex court in case titled, “Amal Sherin and another Vs
the State 22 through A.G. NWFP” PLD 2003 Supreme
Court 371), wherein it has been held that:-

“Conviction in a criminal case can be
recorded even on the statement of
eyewitnesses alone without there being any
corroboration provided their evidence
inspires confidence”.

Similar view has been reiterated by the Hon’ble Supreme

Court in case titled, “Mst. Sughara Begum and another

aisar Pervez and others” (2015 SCMR 1142) in the
following words:- “

“Ocular account in case of ‘Qatl-eAmd’ plays

a decisive and vital role and once its intrinsic

worth is accepted and believed then the rest of

the evidence, both circumstantial and
11

corroboratory in nature, is required as a

matter of caution, but to the contrary, once the
ocular account is disbelieved, then no other
evidence, even of a high degree and value,
would be sufficient for recording conviction on a
capital charge, therefore, probative value of the
ocular account is to be seen in light of the facts
and circumstances of each case”. (emphasis
supplied).
13. Recovery of blood from the place of the deceased

and his last worn bloodstained garments coupled with
positive Serologist report in respect thereof corroborates
the ocular account. Similarly, the supporting evidence i.e.
autopsy report of the deceased according to which the
deceased has sustained fourteen firearm entrance wounds
with corresponding exit on various parts of his body,
resulting, his unnatural death, supports the ocular account.
14. Deriving wisdoms and _ guidance from the
principles laid down by the August Apex Court in cases of
Amal Sherin and another and Mst. Sughara Begum (supra),
we, while accepting the intrinsic worth of the ocular
account furnished by PW Raheed-ur-Reham (PW.5) and
Wali Ullah (PW.6), are of the considered view that the
learned Trial Court has rightly held the appellant guilty of
the offence. In this regard, the findings of the learned Trial
Court are well reasoned and based on proper appreciation
of evidence to which no exception can be taken.

15. Now the moot question for determination would be

the quantum of sentence to be awarded to the appellant to
12

meet the ends of justice. The learned trial Court has
awarded life imprisonment to the appellant but has not
furnished any reason within the meaning of section 367 (5)
Cr.P.C. for not awarding the normal penalty of death
provided for the offence. On the record, there is no reason
to constitute a mitigating circumstance that’s the learned
trial Court too was unable to advance the same. From the
prosecution evidence it is not discernible as to fire shots of
which of the accused has hit which part of the body of the
deceased but it would not create a mitigating circumstance
because common intention can be proved through direct or
circumstantial evidence. It may also depended upon the
nature of an act done or motive possessed and a joint action
of more than one person itself, is an evidence of common
intention. Common intention generally involves element of
common motive, pre-plan preparation and actual pursuant
to such plan. In this case, the appellant and his co-accused
are brothers inter-se. As stated earlier the deceased was
demanding land/share of his maternal grandmother from
them, therefore, the accused had direct motive with the
deceased to remove them from the way. Arrival of the
appellant with co-accused at the spot armed with deadly
weapons, waiting for the arrival of the deceased and then
doing him away by indiscriminate firing are sufficient
strong circumstances to prove motive in the mind of the

accused and their pre-plan to commit the murder, which
13

leaves no room for any mitigating circumstance to warrant
lesser sentence. The learned Trial Court has, therefore,
erred in law by awarding lesser sentence to the appellant.
The prosecution has proved the guilt of the appellant upto
the hilt through cogent and confidence inspiring
ocular/direct evidence. There exists no mitigating
circumstance, to warrant lesser sentence, therefore, award
of normal penalty of death to the appellant, as provided for
the offence, would meet the ends of justice.

16. For the reasons discussed above, Cr.A. No.
526-P/2016 filed by the appellant/convict is hereby
dismissed, his conviction and sentence under section
302 (b) PPC is maintained, whereas, Cr.R. No.105-P/2016,
filed by Rasheed ur Rehman petitioner/complainant is
allowed, resultantly, the sentence of convict is enhanced
from life imprisonment to normal penalty of death as
Ta’azir. He be hanged by the neck till he is dead. The
sentence of fine and period of imprisonment in default
thereof shall, however, remain intact.
