3.1.2009 applicant Riaz Ali son of Muhammad Panah stood surety and submitted
certified copy of Registered Sale Deed of a residential plot, issued by the
Sub-Registrar, Larkana.

Ali in the present application requests for return of his surety papers on the

1st Additional Sessions Judge, Larkana, vide order, dated 9.1.2009. 
Certified copy is available in the file.   Learned State Counsel has no objection
to the grant of this application.

material available on record.  Under the circumstances since accused Mukhtiar
Ali has been admitted to interim pre-arrest bail by the learned 1st
Additional Sessions Judge, Larkana on 9.1.2009, therefore, this application is
granted.  Office is directed to return the original surety papers after proper
