JUDGMENT

Naeem Akhtar Afghan, J. On the basis of statement of Muhammad
Tufail son of Muhammad Akram (Complainant/PW-1), FIR No.52 was registered
with Police Station (PS’) Attock at 9:30 am on 13.02.2009 u/s 302/34 of the
Pakistan Penal Code, 1908 (PPC’).

2. As per contents of FIR No.52/2009 PS City Attock, the father Muhammad
Akram and brother Muhammad Azmat of complainant/PW-1 were in custody in
District Jail Attock in FIR No.432/2008 PS Saddar, Hasanabdal, u/s
302/452/148 and 149 PPC which was registered by Tariq son of Muhammad
Nawazish while he, his brothers Muhammad Afzal and Muhammad Gulzar, his
mother Mst. Razia Bibi, Mst. Ulfat Bibi (wife of his brother Muhammad Azmat) and

Mst. Qursia Bibi (wife of his brother Muhammad Afzal) were on bail; the trial
Crl.As.No.443/2019 etc 2

proceedings were fixed for 13.02.2009 in the Court of learned Additional Session
Judge, Attock; his father Muhammad Akram and brother Muhammad Azmat were
brought in custody to the trial Court from District Jail Attock by Shaukat Hayat
Sub-Inspector and other police officials; they had also reached the Court premises
to attend the trial proceedings; the case was called; at about 9:30 am when he
alongwith his brothers Muhammad Afzal and Muhammad Gulzar, his mother Mst.
Razia Bibi and his sisters-in-law Mst. Ulfat Bibi and Qursia Bibi reached in the
Verandah of the Court, his father Muhammad Akram and brother Muhammad
Azmat were brought hand-cuffed by Shaukat Hayat Sub-Inspector, Muhammad
Kamran Constable, Jalal-ud-Din Constable, Muhammad Imran Constable and
Zulfiqar Ahmed Constable; they were being taken towards the Court room; when
they reached the stairs of Verandah, suddenly the complainant party of FIR
No.432/2008 i.e. Iftikhar Ahmad (armed with .30 bore pistol), Abrar Ahmad
Farooq (armed with .30 bore pistol) and Ali Arif (armed with .30 bore pistol)
appeared and started indiscriminate firing; after receiving fire shots, his father
Muhammad Akram and brother Muhammad Azmat fell down; his father
Muhammad Akram succumbed to the injuries on the spot while his brother
Muhammad Azmat was taken to the hospital being seriously injured but he also
succumbed to the injuries on his way to the hospital; the police officials over-
powered the accused Iftikhar Ahmad and Abrar Ahmad Farooq on the spot
alongwith their firearms; while taking advantage of ‘rush’ accused Ali Arif
succeeded in fleeing.

Motive of the occurrence was mentioned as land dispute and previous

enmity.

3. In pursuance of above FIR investigation was conducted. On completion of
investigation, the investigating officer submitted report u/s 173 Cr.P.C. against
accused Abrar Ahmad Farooq and Iftikhar Ahmad while declaring accused Ali Arif
innocent.

4. Feeling aggrieved of declaring accused Ali Arif as innocent by the
Investigating Officer and due to non-inclusion of the provisions of Anti-Terrorism
Act, 1997 (ATA’) in the FIR, the complainant/ PW-1 submitted written complaint
dated 18.09.2009 (Ex.PD) before the Special Judge, Anti-Terrorism Court
Rawalpindi on 14.10.2009 u/s 302/34 PPC r/w section 7 ATA against accused
Iftikhar Ahmad, Abrar Ahmad Farooq and Ali Arif.

5. After recording preliminary statements of complainant, witnesses

Muhammad Afzal and Muhammad Gulzar on 19.10.2009, the nominated accused
Crl.As.No.443/2019 etc 3

were summoned to face trial for the offences u/s 302/34 PPC and section 7 (a)
ATA.

6. On commencement of trial proceedings on the basis of complaint, all the
three accused were read over charge u/s 302/34 PPC r/w section 7(a) ATA by the
learned Judge, Anti-Terrorism Court-III, Rawalpindi & Islamabad Capital Territory
(the Trial Court’).

7. The Trial Court recorded examination-in-chief of the complainant as PW-1
and of Muhammad Afzal as PW-2 on 06.11.2010. Before their cross-examination
by the learned defence counsel, the accused Iftikhar Ahmad fled from police
custody on 21.01.2011 when he was being taken to the Court of Area Magistrate
for production in FIR No.38/2011 registered u/s 13(e) of the Arms Ordinance,
1965. He was declared proclaimed offender by the trial Court and his perpetual
arrest warrants were also issued. A separate case u/s 223 and 224 PPC was also

registered against Abdul Waiz, Sub-Inspector and other police officials.

8. The trial proceedings continued against accused Ali Arif and Abrar Ahmad
Farooq. The statements of prosecution witnesses were recorded by the Trial Court.
On conclusion of the trial proceedings against accused Ali Arif and Abrar Ahmad
Farooq, the Trial Court acquitted accused Ali Arif and awarded conviction and
sentence to accused Abrar Ahmad Farooq as follows vide judgment dated

11. ©The convict Abrar Ahmad Faroog challenged his conviction and sentence by
filing Criminal Appeal No.104-T/ 2011 before the Rawalpindi Bench of Lahore High
Court (the Appellate Court’). Capital Sentence Reference No.4-T/ 2011 was also
forwarded by the Trial Court to the Appellate Court for confirmation or otherwise

of the death sentence of the convict Abrar Ahmad Farooq.

12. The convict Iftikhar Ahmad also challenged his conviction and sentence by
filing Criminal Appeal No.27-J/ 2011 before the Appellate Court. Capital Sentence
Reference No.6-T/ 2011 was also forwarded by the Trial Court to the Appellate
Court for confirmation or otherwise of the death sentence of the convict Iftikhar
Ahmad.

13. The acquittal of accused Ali Arif by the Trial Court was not challenged by

the complainant/ legal heirs of deceased.

14. Criminal Appeal No.27-J/2011 (filed by the convict Iftikhar Ahmad) and
Capital Sentence Reference No.6-T/ 2011 were decided as follows by the Appellate
Court vide judgment dated 03.02.2016:

“For the above reasons, penalty of death is altered into
imprisonment for life; benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C. shall be
extended to the appellant and all the sentences shall run
concurrently. Amount of compensation/fine and consequences in
case of default are kept intact. Capital Sentence Reference
No.6-T of 2011 is answered in NEGATIVE and death sentence
awarded to the appellant is NOT CONFIRMED.
Crl.As.No.443/2019 etc 5

15. Criminal Appeal No.104-T/ 2011 (filed by the convict Abrar Ahmad Farooq)
and Capital Sentence Reference No.4-T/2011 were decided as follows by the
Appellate Court vide judgment dated 03.02.2016:

“Consequently, Crl. Appeal No.104-T of 2011 fails. The appellant
has been reckless as he preferred to settle score on his own
instead of seeking justice from the Court by relying upon the
majesty of law. The deceased were yet to receive a guilty verdict as
they were confronting the charge of homicide under the
presumption of innocence and as such there is no mitigation to
benefit him. Resultantly, death penalty on all counts is
confirmed. Amount of compensation/fine is kept intact. Capital
Sentence Reference No.04-T of 2011 is answered in POSITIVE
and death sentence is CONFIRMED.

16. The convict Abrar Ahmad Farooq filed Jail Petition for Leave to Appeal
No.164/2016 before this Court against the judgment passed by the Appellate
Court.

The convict Iftikhar Ahmad filed Jail Petition for Leave to Appeal
No.347/2016 before this Court against the judgment passed by the Appellate
Court.

The complainant also filed Criminal Petition for leave to Appeal
No.349/ 2016 before this Court for enhancement of sentence of imprisonment for

life of the convict Iftikhar Ahmad to death penalty.

17. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court in all the above three petitions
vide order dated 23.10.2019. The office assigned Criminal Appeal No.443/2019 to
Jail Petition No.164/2016 (filed by the convict Abrar Ahmad Farooq), Criminal
Appeal No.444/ 2019 to Jail Petition No.347/ 2016 (filed by convict Iftikhar Ahmad)
and Criminal Appeal No.445/2019 to Criminal Petition No.349/2016 (filed by the

complainant for enhancement of sentence of convict Iftikhar Ahmad).

18. Learned counsel for the appellants did not press Crl. Appeal No.104-T of
2011 for acquittal of appellant Abrar Ahmad Farooq and pressed the same for
reduction of his death penalty to imprisonment for life on the grounds that the
death sentence of appellant Iftikhar Ahmad has already been reduced to
imprisonment for life by the Appellate Court and the motive of the occurrence was
revenge killing. In support of his contention, learned counsel relied upon the case
of ‘Muhammad Shabbir v. the State".

19. Learned counsel for the appellants pressed Criminal Appeal No.27-J/ 2011
for acquittal of appellant Iftikhar Ahmad on the grounds that he was falsely
implicated by fabrication at the behest of the complainant/PW-1; he was not

"2020 SCMR 1206
Crl.As.No.443/2019 etc 6

present at the place of occurrence; no firearm was recovered from him during
investigation and the prosecution has failed to prove the charge against him

beyond reasonable doubt.

20. Learned counsel for the appellants further contended that motive of the
occurrence, which had taken place in the court premises, was personal vendetta,
therefore due to entry No.4 (iii) in the Third Schedule of ATA, the trial Court had
the jurisdiction for trial of the appellants but there was no occasion for the Trial
Court to award conviction and sentence to the appellants u/s 7(@) ATA as there
was no design or purpose of the offence as mentioned in clause (6) or (c) of sub-
section (1) of section 6 ATA. In support of his contention learned counsel for the
appellants relied upon the cases of ‘Farooq Ahmed v. the State’? and ‘Ghulam
Hussain v. the State?.

21. Learned counsel for the complainant stated that the prosecution has proved
the charge against both the appellants beyond reasonable doubt; in view of
unshaken and confidence inspiring testimony of eye witnesses duly corroborated
by circumstantial evidence and in absence of any mitigating circumstance, both
the appellants are liable to be awarded normal penalty of death for committing
murder of father and brother of the complainant in court premises being hand-
cuffed/in police custody. Learned counsel for the complainant relied upon the
case of ‘Hamid Mukhtar Shah v. Muhammad Azam‘.

22. While opposing the appeals of the convicts and supporting the appeal of the
complainant for enhancement of sentence of the appellant Iftikhar Ahmad, learned
Additional PG contended that all the prosecution witnesses remained consistent
and were not shaken during cross-examination; both the appellants were over
powered by the police at the place of occurrence with crime weapons in respect
whereof positive report of firearm expert has come on record; there are no
extenuating circumstances to award lessor sentence to the appellants; on the
basis of sufficient incriminating evidence, both the appellants deserve capital

sentence.

23. After hearing learned counsel for the appellants, learned counsel for the
complainant and learned Additional PG, we have perused the available record
which transpires that while cross-examining eye witnesses, it was the plea of the
appellant Abrar Ahmad Farooq that the murder of Muhammad Akram and
Muhammad Azmat was committed by the appellant Iftikhar Ahmad; at the time of

occurrence he was present inside the Court room as prosecution witness and

> 2020 SCMR 78
> PLD 2020 SC 61
+2005 SCMR 427
Crl.As.No.443/2019 etc 7

acquitted co-accused Ali Arif (his maternal uncle) was not present at the place of

occurrence.

24. |The postmortem report of deceased Muhammad Akram reveals that he had
received three fire shots having entry wound on anterior of chest with exit on back
midline, entry wound on vertex with exit on left side of neck, entry wound on

interior abdominal wall near umbilicus with exit on back near midline.

The postmortem report of Muhammad Azmat reveals that he had received
two fire shots having entry wound on front of chest midline with exit on back
midline and entry wound on back of right ear with exit on left side of neck.

25. Statements of the eye witnesses and witnesses to the recovery memos reveal
that seven crime empties of .30 bore (C1 to C7) were recovered from the place of
occurrence; one pistol of .30 bore (P1) and one short pistol (carbine) of 12 bore
were recovered from the appellant Iftikhar Ahmad on the spot while two pistols of
.30 bore (P2 and P3) were recovered from the appellant Abrar Ahmad Farooq on
the spot.

26. The report of the firearm expert confirms that six crime empties of .30 bore
(C1 to C6) were fired from P2 i.e. pistol of .30 bore recovered from the appellant
Abrar Ahmad Farooq.

27. The report of the firearm expert erroneously mentions that crime empty of
12 bore marked as C7 was fired from pistol of .30 bore marked as P1 (recovered
from appellant Iftikhar Ahmad). In the early part of his report, the firearm expert
has mentioned C7 as crime empty of .30 bore and he has not mentioned about
any crime empty of 12 bore as C7. More so over, a cartridge of 12 bore cannot be
fired from a pistol of .30 bore. In this regard no explanation has been offered by
the prosecution before the trial Court, before the Appellate Court and before this
Court.

28. Due to the above discrepancy in the report of firearm expert, even if the
same is kept out of consideration to the extent of appellant Iftikhar Ahmad, it does
not improve his case as all the eye witnesses of the occurrence, whose presence at
the place of occurrence has not been disputed/denied by the defence, have fully
implicated him in the occurrence with the role of firing upon both the deceased
with the appellant Abrar Ahmad Farooq. Both the appellants were
overpowered/ arrested on the spot by the police with crime weapons. The evidence
on record proves that both the appellants committed murder of deceased by firing
in furtherance of common intention.
Crl.As.No.443/2019 etc 8

29. The statements of complainant/PW-1 and PW-2 Muhammad Afzal have
rightly been disbelieved by the trial Court as well as by the Appellate Court to the
extent of acquitted accused Ali Arif as he had proved his plea of a/ibi during
investigation as well as at the trial. His presence at the place of occurrence with
the appellants has not been supported by the police witnesses who were

accompanying both the deceased at the time of occurrence.

30. The trial as well as the Appellate Courts have believed the statements of
complainant/PW-1 and PW-2 against the appellants as same have fully been
supported/ corroborated by Shaukat Hayat Sub-Inspector (produced as CW1
against both the appellants), Zulfiqar Ali Constable (produced as CW2 against
both the appellants), Muhammad Kamran Constable (produced as CW3 against
appellant Abrar Ahmad Faroog and as CW12 against appellant Iftikhar Ahmad),
Jalal-ud-Din Constable (produced as CW5 against appellant Abrar Ahmad Farooq
and as CW6 against appellant Iftikhar Anmad) and Muhammad Imran Constable
(produced as CW4 against appellant Arbar Ahmad Farooq and as CW3 against
appellant Iftikhar Ahmad) who were bringing both the deceased to the Court room
for trial proceedings from lock-up (bakhshi khana) of the Court premises of the
Sessions Court Attock.

31. According to the settled principles, the police officials are as good witnesses
as any other private witness. In absence of any animus, their testimony can be
relied upon if they remained un-shattered during cross-examination. Reference in
this regard is made to the cases of ‘Salah-ud-din v. the State, ‘Qari
Muhammad Ishaq Ghazi v. the State’, ‘Zulfiqar alias Zulfa v. the State”,
‘Liaquat Ali v. the State’, ‘Ali Taj v. the State’ and ‘Nazeer Ahmed v. the
State”.

32. In the instant case record does not reveal of any animosity or ill-will on the
part of the police officials to falsely implicate the appellants. All the police officials
who had appeared at the trial as eye witnesses of the occurrence have fully
incriminated both the appellants with role of firing upon both the deceased in the
verandah of the court premises when they, being hand-cuffed, were on their way
to the court room in police custody to attend the trial proceedings. All the police
officials appearing as eye witnesses at the trial remained un-shattered despite
lengthy cross-examination by the learned defence counsel. Hence, there is no

reason to doubt veracity of their testimony as eye witnesses of the occurrence.

© 9023 SCMR 1299
Crl.As.No.443/2019 etc 9

33. On re-appraisal of the evidence available on record, we have no hesitation
to conclude that the prosecution has proved the charge against both the
appellants beyond reasonable doubt. The confidence inspiring testimony of all the
eye witnesses of the occurrence is duly corroborated by the medico legal evidence,
crime empties recovered from the place of occurrence, blood stains collected from
the place of occurrence, crime weapons recovered from both the appellants when
they were over powered by the police soon after the occurrence and positive report
of the firearm expert to the extent of firearm recovered from the appellant Abrar

Ahmad Farooq.

34. With regard to the conviction and sentence awarded to the appellants u/s
7(a) ATA, it is observed that in the instant case the motive of the occurrence was
personal vendetta i.e. previous enmity due to murder of Muhammad Nawazish
(father of both the appellants) in respect whereof FIR No.432 of 2008 was lodged
with PS Saddar Hasanabdal against the complainant/ PW-1, deceased Muhammad
Akram, deceased Muhammad Azmat and others. There is nothing on record to
show that while making firing upon the deceased in the Court premises, the
appellants wanted to create fear or terror or insecurity in or around the Court

premises.

35. Offence of firing or use of explosives by any device, including bomb blast in
the Court premises has been specified in entry No.4(iii) of the Third Schedule to
ATA as a ‘Scheduled Offence’. In absence of any motive or design to create fear or
terror or insecurity as mentioned in clauses (b) or (c) of sub-section (1) of section 6
ATA, the cases of Scheduled Offences specified in entry No.4 of the Third Schedule
to ATA, being heinous offences, are to be tried by an Anti-Terrorism Court for
speedy trial and in such cases, Anti-Terrorism Court can award punishment for
the said offence and not for committing the offence of terrorism.

Reference in the above regard is made to the case of ‘Amjad Ali v. the
State’! wherein it has been held as follows:

“The last aspect of this case highlighted in the leave granting order
is as to whether the courts below were justified in convicting and
sentencing the appellants for an offence under section 7(a) of the
Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 or not. We note in that context that a mere
firing at one’s personal enemy in the backdrop of a private
vendetta or design does not ipso fact bring the case within the
purview of section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 so as to brand
the action as terrorism. There was no ‘design’ or ‘object’
contemplated by section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 involved
in the case in hand. We further note that by virtue of item No.4(ii) of
the Third Schedule to the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 a case becomes
triable by an Anti-Terrorism Court if use of firearms or explosive,
etc. in a mosque, imambargah, church, temple or any other place of

" PLD 2017 SC 661
Crl.As.No.443/2019 etc 10

worship is involved in the case. That entry in the Third Schedule
only makes such a case triable by an Anti-Terrorism Court but such
a case does not ipso facto become a case of terrorism for the
purposes of recording convictions and sentences under section 6
read with section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. The case in
hand had, thus, rightly been tried by an Anti-Terrorism Court but
the said Court could not have convicted and sentenced the
appellants for an offence under section 7(a) of the Anti-Terrorism
Act, 1997 as it had separately convicted and sentenced the
appellants for the offences of murder, etc. committed as ordinary
crimes.”

Reference is also made to the case of ‘Farooq Ahmed’ (relied upon by the
learned counsel for the appellants) wherein it has been held as follows:

“Section 6 read with section 7 of ATA, 1997 would not be attracted
if the murder is committed to avenge private enmity. The 34
Schedule to ATA, 1997 provides list of scheduled offences that are
triable by the Special Court to the exclusion of any other Court. By
an amendment in 2005 the Anti-Terrorism Courts were conferred
jurisdiction to try an accused for firing or for the use of explosives
by any device including bomb blast in the Court premises. The
inclusion in the scheduled offences only extended the jurisdiction
upon the Anti-Terrorism court to try such an accused. However, in
order to convict him under section 7 of the ATA, 1997 his act must
fall within the scope of section 6 of the Act. As has already been
found that since the petitioner had statedly committed the murder
to avenge murder committed by the deceased his action would not
fall within the definition of terrorism under section 6 of ATA, 1997.
There was no design to create fear or terror or insecurity in the
Court premises. In this view of the matter the petitioner’s conviction
under section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act cannot be sustained and
the same is therefore, set aside.”

Similarly in the case of ‘Ghulam Hussain’ (relied upon by the learned

counsel for the appellants) it has been held as follows:

“A careful reading of the Third Schedule shows that an Anti-
Terrorism Court has been conferred jurisdiction not only to try all
those offences which attract the definition of terrorism provided
by the Act but also some other specified cases involving heinous
offences which do not fall in the said definition of terrorism. For
such latter category of cases it was provided that although those
offences may not constitute terrorism yet such offences may be
tried by an Anti-Terrorism Court for speedy trial of such heinous
offences. This distinction between cases of terrorism and cases
of specified heinous offences not amounting to terrorism but
triable by an Anti-Terrorism Court has already been recognized
by this Court in the cases of Farooq Ahmed v. State and another
(2020 SCMR 78), Amjad Ali and others v. The State (PLD 2017
SC 661) and Muhammad Bilal v. The State and others (2019
SCMR 1362). It has been clarified by this Court in those cases
that such specified heinous offences are only to be tried by an
Anti-Terrorism Court and that court can punish the person
committing such specified heinous offences only for commission
of those offences and not for committing terrorism because such
offences do not constitute terrorism. For the purposes of further
clarity on this issue it is explained for the benefit of all
concerned that the cases of the offences specified in entry No. 4
of the Third Schedule to the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 are cases
of those heinous offences which do not per se constitute the
offence of terrorism but such cases are to be tried by an Anti-
Terrorism Court because of their inclusion in the Third Schedule.
Crl.As.No.443/2019 etc 11

It is also clarified that in such cases of heinous offences
mentioned in entry No. 4 of the said Schedule an Anti-Terrorism
Court can pass a punishment for the said offence and not for
committing the offence of terrorism. It may be pertinent to
mention here that the offence of abduction or kidnapping for
ransom under section 365-A, P.P.C. is included in entry No. 4 of
the Third Schedule and kidnapping for ransom is also one of the
actions specified in section 7(e) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
Abduction or kidnapping for ransom is a heinous offence but the
scheme of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 shows that an ordinary
case of abduction or kidnapping for ransom under section 365-A,
P.P.C. is merely triable by an Anti-Terrorism Court but if
kidnapping for ransom is committed with the design or purpose
mentioned in clauses (b) or (c) of subsection (1) of section 6 of the
Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 then such offence amounts to terrorism
attracting section 7(e) of that Act. In the former case the
convicted person is to be convicted and sentenced only for the
offence under section 365-A, P.P.C. whereas in the latter case
the convicted person is to be convicted both for the offence under
section 365-A, P.P.C. as well as for the offence under section 7(e)
of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. The same may also be said
about the other offences mentioned in entry No. 4 of the Third
Schedule to the Act pertaining to "Use of firearms or explosives
by any device, including bomb blast in a mosque, imambargah,
church, temple or any other place of worship, whether or not any
hurt or damage is caused thereby", "Firing or use of explosive by
any device, including bomb blast in the court premises", "Hurt
caused by corrosive substance or attempt to cause hurt by
means of a corrosive substance" and "Unlawful possession of an
explosive substance or abetment for such an offence under the
Explosive Substances Act, 1908 (VI of 1908)". Such distinction
between cases of terrorism and other heinous offences by itself
explains and recognizes that all heinous offences, howsoever
serious, grave, brutal, gruesome, macabre or shocking, do not
ipso facto constitute terrorism which is a species apart”.

36. Since the motive of the occurrence in the instant case for the appellants
was to avenge the murder of their father and the appellants had no motive or
design to create fear or terror or insecurity in the Court premises, therefore, the
conviction and sentence awarded to the appellants u/s 7(a) ATA cannot be

sustained.

37. | For determining the quantum of sentence, each case has to be judged upon
its own facts and circumstances. A single mitigating circumstance, available in a
particular case, would be sufficient to put a Judge on guard for not awarding the
penalty of death but imprisonment for life.

In the instant case the motive of the occurrence for the appellants was to
avenge the murder of their father. In number of cases, such motive has been
considered as a mitigating circumstance to reduce death penalty to imprisonment
for life. In the case of ‘Ajun Shah v. the State’!2 the appellant’s motive for the

crime to avenge the murder of his father and brother was considered as a

PLD 1967 SC 185
Crl.As.No.443/2019 etc 12

mitigating circumstance by this Court for reducing his death penalty to
imprisonment for life.

Similarly in the case of ‘Muhammad Shabbir' (relied upon by learned
counsel for the appellants) the reduction of the sentences of the convicts u/s
302(b) PPC from death penalty to imprisonment for life by the appellate Court due
to motive of the occurrence being revenge of their father was not interfered by this

Court.

38. |The case of ‘Hamid Mukhtar Shah’ relied upon by learned counsel for the
complainant is distinguishable as same is not attracted to the facts and

circumstances of the instant case.
For the above reasons:

i) the conviction and sentence of the appellant Abrar Ahmad Farooq
u/s 7(a) ATA is set aside. While maintaining his conviction u/s 302(bY 34
PPC, his sentence of death on two counts is reduced/converted to
imprisonment for life with benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. He shall also be
liable to pay compensation of Rs.6,00,000/- (ix lac) on two counts to the
legal heirs of both the deceased as required u/s 544-A Cr.P.C. and in
default thereof to undergo simple imprisonment for six months on each
default.

With the above modification, Criminal Appeal No.443/2019 is
dismissed.

(ii) the conviction and sentence of the appellant Iftikhar Ahmad u/s
7(a) ATA is set aside. However, his conviction and sentence u/s 302(b)/ 34
PPC, altered to imprisonment for life by the Appellate Court with benefit of
section 382-B Cr.P.C., for payment of compensation of Rs.6,00,000/- (six
lac) on two counts to be paid to the legal heirs of both the deceased and in
default thereof to undergo simple imprisonment for six months on each
default, is upheld. The conviction and sentence of the appellant Iftikhar
Ahmad u/s 21-L ATA to suffer five years R.I. is maintained. Both the
sentences are ordered to run concurrently.

With the above modification, Criminal Appeal No.444/2019 is
dismissed
Crl.As.No.443/2019 etc 13

(ii) | Consequent to the above, Criminal Appeal No.445/ 2019 (filed
by the complainant for enhancement of sentence of the appellant Iftikhar
Ahmad) is dismissed.
