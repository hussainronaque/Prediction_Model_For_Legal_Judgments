undergo 25 years imprisonment with compensation
of Rs.500,000/- to legal heirs of the deceased u/s
544-A, Cr.P.C. He was also convicted u/s 13 A.O
and sentenced to undergo one year imprisonment
with fine of Rs.2000/- or in case of default thereof to

suffer one month S.] in addition.

Legal heirs of the deceased have filed
the connected Cr.R No. 42-M/206_ seeking
enhancement of the appellant’s sentence. Both the
cases, being interconnected and arising out of the
same judgment, are decided through this single

judgment.

Z. The report was statedly lodged by
deceased then injured Shahid Khan son of Wazir in
Casualty of Saidu Sharif Hospital on 29.12.2014 at
11:00 hours. He stated in his report that at previous
night he came out from his house in response to the
knocking of the present appellant Sadam who asked
him to accompany him to the river bank as he had
lost there his mobile phone. The complainant, being
friend of the appellant/convict, went to the place of
occurrence with him and started search of the
missing mobile phone in dark during which the

appellant attacked him with some sharp-edged

object thereby causing him serious injuries on his
chest and abdomen due to which he became
unconscious. On the next morning someone
informed the inmates of his house and relatives for
shifting him to hospital for treatment. The
complainant neither cited the name of any witness

nor disclosed any motive behind the occurrence.

3. Mian Sardar Badshah SI (PW-2)
recorded report of the deceased then injured in
Murasila Ex.PA/] and referred the injured to
concerned doctor for medical treatment. Thereafter
he was referred to LRH Peshawar where he died on
08.01.2015. Post-mortem on the dead body was
conducted by Dr. Naveed ‘Alam (PW-9). The
appellant was arrested on 29.12.2014 on the day
when the deceased then injured was found by his

relatives on the river bank.

4. After completion of investigation, the
appellant was challaned to trial Court where he was
formally charge-sheeted for the offence to which he
did not plead guilty and opted to face the trial.
Prosecution produced nine witnesses in support of
its case against the appellant and closed its evidence.

When examined u/s 342, Cr.P.C, the appellant

denied the allegation of prosécution and claimed to
be innocent. On conclusion of trial, the learned trial
Court vide judgment dated 28.05.2016 convicted
and sentenced him in the manner discussed above,

hence, this appeal and the connected revision

petition.

PA Arguments heard and record of the case
was perused.

6. Admittedly, the case of prosecution

mainly rests on the dying declaration of the deceased
then injured, however, the record shows that before
the report the deceased then injured was taken to
Barikot Hospital. Mian Sardar Bahadar S] (PW-2)
though was present at the time of examination of the
deceased by doctor at Barikot Hospital and he had
later recorded the report of the deceased then injured
at Saidu Sharif Hospital in shape of murasila but he
did not record the statement of the deceased then
injured at Barikot Hosiptal. Dr. Muhammad Atiq
(PW-7) who examined the deceased then injured at
Barikot Hospital on 29.12.2014 at 10:15 AM has
observed that the deceased then injured was semi-

conscious and non-cooperative and has further stated

DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice ishtlag Ibrahim:
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Winer Ahmad
-5-
that the injured was not in a position to record his

statement. The said PW stated that:

“It is correct that a the (time) of examination the
patient was semi conscious and cannot talk and
was not co-operative........ it is correct that he
was unable to talk”.

Thereafter the deceased then injured
was shifted to Saidu Sharif Hospital where his report
was recorded and his thumb impression was
obtained by Mian Sardar Bahadar S.1 (PW-2) who
During his Court statement has referred to a
certificate available on record as Ex.PW-2/1 which,
according to him, he has obtained from the
concerned doctor with regard to consciousness of the
deceased then injured. The question arising here is
that when he had prepared the injury sheet of the
deceased then injured at Barikot hospital then why
he did not chalk out his report there and then 45
minutes prior to his shifting to Saidu Sharif Hospital.
The afore-referred document ie Ex.PW-2/1 though
depicts that the deceased then injured was conscious
but the same certificate has been signed by an
unknown person and only his signature is only there
on the certificate without his name or designation.
Even the prosecution has not examined the

concerned doctor who has issued the said certificate.

Thus, the dying declaration of the deceased then
injured, which is the only substantive piece of
evidence with the prosecution, is belied by medical
evidence, hence, in view of the above mentioned
attending circumstances of the dying declaration it
can safely be held that the deceased was not able to
record his statement, as such, the said piece of
evidence is not sufficient for sustaining conviction
of the appellant. In addition, it is apparent from the
record that the occurrence took place on 28.12.2014
whereas the injured complainant died on 08.01.2015
but during this interregnum the investigating agency
neither made any effort to obtain any authentic
certificate from the doctor who had attended the
deceased during his stay in the hospital nor recorded
his statement through a magistrate as provided in

Rule 21 of Chapter XX’ of Police Rules, 1934.

7. Even otherwise, dying declaration is to
be looked into with great caution and care in the
light of facts and circumstances of each case. It is
settled law that dying declaration, being a statement
of a person without the test of cross-examination, is
a weaker type of evidence which by itself cannot be
used as admissible evidence for conviction of an

accused unless corroborated by other evidence of

0B: Hon'ble Mr. Justice ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiaar Ahmad

-7-
reliable nature. Guidance is sought from Tahir Khan
Vs. The State (2011 SCMR 646). The august
Supreme Court of Pakistan observed in the said

judgment that:

It is thus absolutely clear from the principles
laid down by this Court that a dying
declaration is a weaker type of evidence, which
needs corroboration and that conviction can
be based on the basis of such a declaration
when fully corroborated by the other reliable |
evidence. Thus, the facts and circumstances of
each case have to be kept in view and also the
credibility, reliability and acceptability of such
declaration by the Court.
8 It is the case of prosecution against the
present appellant that he has stabbed the deceased at
the bank of river Swat due to which he later on died.
The record transpires that the occurrence took place
on 28" December 2014 at 09:00 P.M and the report
was lodged on the subsequent day at11:00 hours by
the deceased then injured which was considered as
dying declaration, the last incriminating statement of
the deceased. The story of the deceased then injured
that he, after sustaining injuries, was lying on the
river bank in the month of December till the next
morning, which does not appeal to a prudent mind
for the reasons that temperature goes to minus in this

part of the province. Moreso, only blood-stained

shirt of the deceased was taken into possession by

DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishttag [brahim
Hon‘bte Me, Justice Winar Ahmed
-8-

LO and admittedly the deceased was not wearing
any jacket or sweater or any other warm upper
apparel. Thus, survival of the deceased then injured
till next morning in the mentioned circumstances
castes a doubt on the mode and manner of the

occurrence and the prosecution version.

9% So far recovery of dagger on pointation
of the appellant is concerned, the record shows that
prosecution has not associated any independent
witness with the said recovery though private
persons were present there at some distance as
voluntarily stated by constable Jawad Ahmad
(PW-8), the attesting witness of the recovery memo.
Moreso, the recovery of dagger was effected on

30.12.2014 but sketch Ex.PW- 5/6 prepared by I.O

-in this regard bears visible overwriting, thus, the

date on which the recovery was made is doubtful. In
addition, according to the report of Serologist Ex.PF,
no opinion has been given regarding the blood on
the said dagger being insufficient for analysis. Thus,
the observations of the learned trial Court that the
blood on the clothes of deceased has matched with
the blood on the recovered dagger are against the
evidence on record. Even otherwise, recovery of

crime weapon, being a corroborative piece of

evidence, by itself is not sufficient for conviction of
an accused when no direct evidence of convincing

nature is available against him on the record.

10. The leamed trial Court has relied upon
the alleged extra-judicial confession of the appellant
but the record shows that he has not confessed his
guilt rather the same is the statement before police
which has no evidentiary value under Article 38 of

Qanun-e-shahadat Order, 1984.

il. The learned counsel for the
complainant during his arguments referred to certain
irresponsible questions by defence counsel during
cross-examination of PWs but we have no doubt in
our mind that weak cross-examination or even
admissions by defence counsel will not make any
good to the case of the prosecution, when otherwise
the same is pregnant with inherent defects and
contradictions. In this regard we would refer the
judgment of the august Supreme Court in the case of
Abdul Khalig Vs. The State (1996 SCMR 1553). It
was observed by the Hon’ble Court in the said

judgment that:

Even if putting of such question in cross-
examination by the defence counsel, amounts
to an admission, the same r cannot bind the

DB: Hon'ble Mir. Justice Ishtiag brahim:

Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Wioar Ahmad
-10-
appellant. In a criminal case an accused is not
bound by the admissions made by his counsel.
12. For what has been discussed above,
' conviction and sentence of the appellant recorded by
learned trial Court cannot be sustained in the
circumstances. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed,
the impugned judgment is set aside and the appellant
is acquitted of the charge leveled against him in the
present case. He be released forthwith from jail if
not required in any other case. The connected Cr.R
No. 42-M/2016 is dismissed for having become

infructuous.

14. Above are the reasons of our short order

of the even date.
