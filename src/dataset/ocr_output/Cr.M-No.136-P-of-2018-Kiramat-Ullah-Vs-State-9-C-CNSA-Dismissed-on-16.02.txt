QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J.-_ Kiramat

accused/petitioner, is seeking post arrest bail in case

registered against him under Section 9 ( c ) CNSA in

Police Station City Charsadda, vide FIR No.934 dated

20.10.2017 on the report of Wilayat Khan SHO, who

along with police party was present on Sardaryab

Check post and during Nakabandi stopped Motorcar

No.HD-575/Islamabad, coming from Peshawar side

and occupied on the driving seat

accused/petitioner and on the front seat by co-accused

Imran. The search of the motorcar, allegedly, led to the

recovery of ten packets of chars, each weighing

1200/1200 grams, total weighing 12000 grams
concealed in secret cavities of Digi of the car. Out of
each packet, 10/10 grams chars were separated as
sample for chemical analysis in the FSL; and after
the recovery, the accused/petitioner and the co-
accused were arrested; and the aforementioned case
was registered against them. After his failure to secure
bail from the forum below, the accused/petitioner
approached this Court for post arrest bail.

2 Arguments of learned counsel for the
accused/petitioner and learned AAG heard; and record
perused.

3. The mainstay of the arguments of learned
counsel for the accused/petitioner was that the co-
accused in the case, namely, Imran had been released
on bail by this Court vide order dated 26.12.2017,
therefore, the accused/petitioner facing similar charges
in the same case would also be entitled to the
concession of bail under the rule of consistency; but
the learned counsel lost sight of the fact that the role
ascribed to the co-accused Imran in the case was
altogether different and distinguishable from that of
the accused/petitioner, as the former was occupying
front seat of the car therefore his knowledge about
presence of narcotics in the car required further
inquiry, but the accused/petitioner was on the driving
seat and his knowledge about presence of narcotics in

the car ought to be viewed differently.
4. Besides, there is a prima facie case of
recovery of huge quantity of 12000 grams narcotics,
which has been confirmed as chars in the report of
FSL after chemical analysis of the samples received in
the Laboratory within three days of the recovery on
23.10.2017.

5. In short, no case could be made out on behalf
of the accused/petitioner for his release on post arrest
bail; therefore, the application for post arrest bail is
dismissed.
