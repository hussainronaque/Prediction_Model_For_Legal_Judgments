KR
MUHAMMAD FAHEEM WALI, J.- Having been
charged in case FIR No.34 dated 20.02.2021, under
Section 9(d) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of
Narcotic Substance Act, 2019, of police station Daraban,
the petitioner seeks post arrest bail, as he was declined
bail by the Court of Jearned Additional Sessions
Judge-VI, D.l.Khan vide order dated 17.02.2022, on
ground of juvenility.
2. Brief facts of the case as narrated in the
FIR, are that on 20.02.2021, on receiving a spy
information regarding smuggling of huge quantity of
Charas in a truck from Quetta to Peshawar, complainant
Atta Ullah Khan SHO of police station Daraban

on the spot, meanwhile, a Mazda Truck bearing

aiDiz

registration No,LET-2118 came from Quetta Zhob side,
which was stopped. The driver disclosed his name as
Nasim Ali son of Ayan Ali, whereas the other person
sitting alongside driver’s seat introduced himself as
Zaman Ali son of Wilayat Khan. One Munir Ahmad, a
private mechanic was called, who cut down floor of said
truck, which led to the recovery of 412 packets
containing Charas wrapped in plastic tap from its secret
cavities, which were separately weighed with digital
scale, each packet came out to be 1240/1240 gram, total
510880 gram Charas was recovered; that during cursory
interrogation, the accused disclosed that the recovered
contraband was delivered to them at Chaman Road
Quetta by co-accused Attique, resident of Ring Road
Peshawar, which was to be delivered to him at
Peshawar, upon which both the accused were arrested,
while Attique was also arrayed as an accused in the FIR.
3. Arguments heard and record gone through.
4, Before proceeding further it is pertinent to
mention here that Juvenile Justice System Ordinance,
2000, was subsequently replaced with the Juvenile
Justice System Act, 2018. Section 6(5) of the said Act
deals with bail to a juvenile which is reproduced
hereunder:-

“(5) Where the Juvenile Court is of the
opinion that the delay in the trial of a

juvenile has not been occasioned by an
EE SSS .SSSSSS
-3'-

act or omission of such juvenile or any
other person acting on his behalf or in
ad exercise of any right or privilege under
any law for the time being in force, such
juvenile shall be released on bail if he
has been detained for a continuous
period exceeding six months and whose

trial has not been completed”.

5 It appears from the record available on file
that the petitioner was arrested on 20.02.2021, complete
challan was submitted before learned trial Court on
14.7.2021, charge was framed on 02.8.2021. It was on
04.9.2021, when the learned defence counsel submitted
an application for requisitioning the record in order to
ascertain exact age of the petitioner, notice whereof, was
given to the State. Afler hearing arguments, the learned

trial Court vide order dated 01.10.2021, declared the

a

petitioner as juvenile and pursuant thereto, prosecution
was directed to submit separate challan against the
accused and case was posted to 06.10.2021. On the said
date and subsequent dates i.e. 13.10.2021, 14.10.2021,
20.10.2021 and 28.10.2021, separate challan could not
be submitted, however, same was submitted on
29.10.2021 and pursuant thereto, charge was framed on
06.11.2021. From the above, it appears that the delay in
conclusion of trial cannot be attributed to the petitioner,
rather it occasioned in determination of age of the

petitioner. In the case reported as ‘Saleem Khan Vs. The

Pa

-4-

State and others’ (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 256), it

was held by the apex Court that:-

“Determination of age of an accused
who appears or claims to be a juvenile
is, therefore, initially the statutory
responsibility of the Police. In the
absence of which, the court of general
jurisdiction enjoys the power to
determine the age of the accused, and if
declared to be a juvenile, transfer the
case to the concerned Juvenile Court. In
the instant case, the Police had not
carried out any such exercise and
therefore the court on the application of
the petitioner issued the required
declaration. The determination of age by
the court is also a statutory obligation,
hence the time spent in obtaining the said
finding or declaration by the court
cannot possibly be termed as delay
caused in the trial by the accused, so as
to deprive him of his right to bail on the
ground of statutory delay. Any such
determination of age by the court is a
statutory requirement and forms part of

the trial”.
6. In view of what has been stated above, this
petition is allowed and the accused/petitioner is directed
to be released on bai] subject to furnishing bail bond in
the sum of Rs:100,000/- (one lac) with two sureties, each
in the like amount, to the satisfaction of learned

Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate.
