JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, J:-This criminal appeal, filed by
Mir Akbar, the appellant, is directed against the judgment
dated 26.01.2018, passed by learned trial Court/Sessions
Judge, Nowshera whereby he having been found the appellant
guilty of committing murder of Raj Mali deceased convicted
him under section 302(b) PPC and sentenced to undergo
imprisonment for life and to pay rupees two lacs as
compensation to legal heirs of the deceased in terms of section
544-A CrP.C., in case FIR No.598 dated 20.09.1995 under
section 302 PPC, registered at Police Station Nowshera Kalan.
Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. has been extended to the
appellant.

2. The prosecution’s case as unfolded in First

Information Report (FIR) is that on 20.09.1995, complainant
Muhammad Ikram (PW.1) along with Inam Akhtar (PW.2), in
company of dead body of Raj Mali deceased reported to police
that on the fateful day at 1700 hours when he reached near
Masjid Dhobiyan, he noticed the appellant and the deceased
exchanging hot words with each other which resulted into
their grappling. During altercation, the appellant took out a
pistol and fired at the deceased, resultantly, the deceased got
hit and died on the spot. Motive behind the occurrence was a
dispute over debt between the deceased and the appellant.
Besides him, the occurrence is stated to have been witnessed
by Inam Akhtar (PW.2) and Zareef Khan. Report of the
complainant was recorded into the shape of Murasila by Shah
Wali ASI, who also prepared injury sheet and inquest report of
the deceased and referred his dead body to the mortuary for
post mortem examination.

3. It is evident from the record that appellant is directly
and singularly charged for murder of the deceased in the FIR.
The occurrence had taken place on 20.09.1995 which had
been reported on the same day/date. It is worthy to mention
here that after completion of investigation, police as well as
judicial files of the instant case were destroyed in the
devastated flood in District Nowshera. The appellant was
arrested on 29.04.2016 i.e. after a long period of more than
twenty years. Thereafter the judicial as well as police
record/files were re-constructed on the direction of the learned

trial Court. On submission of challan against the appellant, the
ye

prosecution has examined seven witnesses. PW Shah Wali
ASI scriber of the Murasila and Sultan Akbar SI (1.0) could
not be examined on the ground that the latter was dead at the
time of trial while the former was not traceable, therefore,
Jehanzeb No.440 who was well conversant with the hand
writing and signatures of both the above named witnesses was
examined as PW.7, who verified the hand writing and
signatures of both the above named PWs on various
documents. Similarly, Dr. Aftab Alam was also not traceable,
therefore, Dr. Tariq Shah, being well conversant with his hand
writing and signature was examined as PW.6, who verified
signature and hand writing of Dr. Aftab Alam on the post
mortem report.

4, After arrest of the appellant by Murad Ali Khan ASI
and completion of investigation, on the strength of
reconstructed record, complete challan was submitted against
the appellant before the learned trial court, where he was
formally charge sheeted to which he pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial, however he did not object the genuineness or
veracity of any document. To prove its case, the prosecution
examined as many as seven witnesses. After closure of the
prosecution’s evidence statement of the appellant was
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C. wherein he denied the
prosecution allegation and professed his innocence. He,
however, declined to be examined on oath under section

340(2) Cr.P.C. or to produce evidence in defence. On
conclusion of trial, the leamed trial court, after hearing both
the sides convicted and sentenced the appellant as mentioned

above, hence, this appeal.

5. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record perused.
6. It appears from record that occurrence in this case has

taken place on 20.09.1995 at about 1700 hours near Dhobyan
Masjid, which has been reported by complainant Muhammad
Ikram (PW.1) with promptitude at 1730 hours. Ocular account
of the incident has been furnished by complainant Muhammad
Ikram and PW Inam Akhtar. The former while appearing as
PW.1 reiterated the same story as set forth by him in his initial
report. He once again charged the appellant for murder of the
deceased on the day, date, time and place as alleged by him in
the initial report. The latter while appearing as PW.2 deposed
that on the fateful day he had visited the house of his uncle
Muhammad Zarif. On the fateful day he along with his uncle
Muhammad Zair was going to his shop and when reached the
place of occurrence he noticed appellant Mir Akbar firing at
Raj Mali deceased with a pistol, as a result, the deceased got
hit and died on the spot. After the occurrence, the appellant
decamped from the spot. They arranged a Cot in which they
shifted dead body of the deceased to the hospital. Motive
behind the occurrence was money dispute between the

deceased and the appellant.

7. Both the eyewitnesses have been subjected to cross-
examination by the defence but nothing beneficial could be
extracted from their mouths. They remained stuck to their
stance and corroborated each other on all material aspects of
the incident, such as the day, date, time and place of
occurrence as well as the mode and manner in which the
appellant committed the murder of the deceased. The
eyewitnesses are also consistent on the motive part of the case.
Being a broad day light occurrence and appellant already
known to the eyewitnesses as they are co-villagers inter-se,
question of mistaken identity does not arise. Similarly, the
promptly lodged report within 30 minutes eliminates the
possibility of consultation and deliberation on the part of the
complainant in charging the appellant. The eyewitnesses have
directly and singularly charged the appellant for murder of the
deceased with a pistol. Nothing has been brought from their
mouths in cross-examination so as to question their presence
at the spot at the time of occurrence. Similarly, there exists no
reason, much less plausible, to suggest false implication of the
appellant by the eyewitnesses by substituting the real culprits.
8. The ocular account of the eyewitnesses is supported
by medical evidence. In the post-mortem report, the following
injuries were found on the dead body of the deceased by
Dr.Aftab Alam:-

1. Entry wound 1x1 at left 10" posterior. Exit wound at

9 ribs outering in the anterior auxiliary line.
a

2. Entry wound on top of left side neck. Exit wound on
the top of right side of neck.
3. Entry wound on the left side of neck. Exit wound on
the right side of the neck.
4. | Two exit and entry wounds on the right hand.
Opinion: According to his opinion the cause of death of the

deceased was injuries to vital structure in the neck. Probable
time between injury and death has been opined by him as
“five minutes” and between death and Post mortem as “one
hour”.

From the above statement, it is manifest that the
deceased has sustained three firearm entrance wounds with
corresponding exits which resulted into his unnatural death.
Besides, the unexplained ascendance of the petitioner for a
long period since 20.09.1995 (date of registration of case) till
29.04.2016 (date of his arrest), is yet another circumstance
which corroborates the ocular account of the prosecution’s
case. It is settled law that where ocular evidence is very clear,
convincing and the role of the accused person in the crime
stands clearly established, duly supported by medical
evidence, shall be considered sufficient to prove the
prosecution case whereas, the missing circumstantial evidence
may be of no significance. In the case in hand, the ocular
account of PW-1 and 2 that the appellant being sole accused in
the case, had made fire shots on the deceased. Besides, both
the above mentioned witnesses have proved their presence at

the spot as their evidence are natural, reliable and does not
suffer from any serious or material contradictions, therefore, it
cannot be doubted at all.

9. On reappraisal of prosecution’s evidence we have
reached to an irresistible conclusion that the prosecution has
proved the guilt of the appellant through cogent and
confidence inspiring direct evidence. In this view of the matter
the learned trial court has rightly held him guilty of the
offence to which no exception can be taken. However, it is
manifest from the FIR coupled with prosecution’s evidence
that the occurrence has taken place at the spur of moment. It is
proved on record that initially, there was exchange of hot
words between the deceased and the appellant, then an
altercation/grappling during which course the appellant fired
at the deceased, meaning thereby that the appellant had no
premeditation and intention to do away with the deceased.
Had there been any intention and premeditation then the
appellant at the very first instance would have resorted to
firing upon the deceased. The assailant has not taken undue
advantage or acted in cruel manner. In such a situation, the
cause of cruelty is not relevant, nor it is relevant that who
offered the provocation. So far the wounds caused during the
occurrence are concerned, suffice it to say that it is not
decisive factor, rather what is important is that the occurrence
must be sudden, pre-meditated and if the accused has acted in
a fit of anger, then the accused would be entitled for benefit

under section 302(c) PPC. Baring in mind the above principle
ay

coupled with the evidence of PW-1 and 2, it is manifest that
any pre-meditation for committing murder of deceased is
missing whereas, it is proved from the case of prosecution that
the accused-appellant had made fire shots in the heat of
passion. On cost of repetition, the entire prosecution evidence
and facts narrated in the FIR would go to show that during
sudden quarrel, the appellant drew his pistol and fired at the
deceased. Though the deceased had received three fire arm
inlet wounds at the hand of the accused-appellant but the
number of injuries inflicted on the deceased would not and
could not be decisive factor to decide that the assailant has
acted in a cruel manner. In this view of the matter, we convert
the conviction of the appellant from Section 302(b) PPC to
section 302(c) PPC and reduce his sentence from life
imprisonment to 08 years rigorous imprisonment. Remaining
sentence of the appellant and benefit of section 382-B CrPC
already extended to him by the learned trial Court shall remain

intact in his favour.
