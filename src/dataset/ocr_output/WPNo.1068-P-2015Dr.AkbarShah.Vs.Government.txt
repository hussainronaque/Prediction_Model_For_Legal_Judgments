despite that her services she was directed to
report Health Department of the Province on
the ground that she has not opted for

iii) W.P No.292-P/2017:- Petitioner Dr.

(BPS-17) in Khyber Teaching Hospital,
Peshawar and under new medical services
system u/s 16 of MTI Act 2015, he exercised

his option to continue his services as
Ijaz

institutional employee in the’ K.T.H,
Peshawar but vide impugned notification
dated 07.02.2017, he was directed to report
back to Health Department of the Province
with immediate effect.

3. As common question of law and
facts are involved and all the petitioners
were institutional employees and had opted
u/s 16 of MTI Act to remain employee of
K.T.H and to be dealt with u/s MTI Act and
whether the respondents have authority
under the MTI Act to pass any order for
transfer of the institutional employees to
report to Health Department were questions
which needed explanation from _ the
respondents, so the respondents were called
to submit their comments, who submitted the
same and prayed to consider sufficient in all
petitions.

4, Learned counsel for petitioners
argued that after promulgation of MTI Act
2015, the petitioners were given right to

exercise option to remain _ institutional
Ijaz

employees in view of section 16 of MTI Act
2015, so they filled option proformas well
within prescribe time u/s 16(3) of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Medical Teaching Institutional
Reforms Act 2015 within 90 days from the
date of commencement of the Act. Similarly
counsel for petitioner Mian Mohibullah Kaka
Khel argued that the transfer order of the
petitioner dated 20.01.2016 has _ been
challenged in the instant writ petition is
against law, without lawful authority as being
institutional employee, the respondents has
no authority to transfer an_ institutional
employee to direct him to report in the
Health Department. Similar are the
arguments in other connected writ petitions.
The leaned counsel for petitioners argued
that they have exercised the option u/s 16 of
the MTI Reform Act, so are _ institutional
employees could not be sent to surplus pool
or transfer from the Medical Institutional
Hospital to report at Health Department.

Learned counsel for petitioners placed
Ijaz

reliance on the judgment of this Court in W.P
No.2980-P/2014 titled Dr. Muhammad Ali
Johan Vs _ Government of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa & others dated 02.01.2014
and judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in
C.P No.157 of 2017 in case titled as Dr.
Muhammad Inam Vs Dr. Waseem Anwar
& others dated 27.02.2014.

5. Conversely, learned counsel for
respondents vehemently opposed the
contentions raised by the learned counsel for
petitioners that the petitioners have no locus
standi and argued that petitioners are civil
servants and the Director General Health is
competent to pass transfer order anywhere
in the Province and the petitioners are bound
under the law to act upon the orders of the
competent authority. He argued that the
petitioners are not aggrieved in view of
Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, 1973, as the matter
relates to transfer and services, so this Court

lack jurisdiction. He lastly argued that
Ijaz

petitioners have not opted to be institutional
employees within prescribe time of 90 days
according to the Provision contained in the
MT| Act, so petitioners were either
transferred to the other Hospitals in the
Province or were directed to report the

Health Department.

6. Arguments heard and_ record
perused.
7. From the submissions made by

the learned counsel for the parties,
examining of MTI Act, 2015 and perusal of
record, it is an admitted fact that the
petitioners prior to promulgation of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Medical Teaching Institutional
Reforms Act, 2015 were serving in Khyber
Teaching Hospital on their respective posts
and according to Section 16 of the same act
were obliged to fill proformas to exercise
option as to whether they want to continue to
serve the institution or not. For

comprehension the relevant provision of
Section 16 of the MTI Act is reproduced
below:-

“3) On the commencement of
this Act, all the civil servants
serving in an existing Medical
teaching Institution shall be
given an option either to
continue to serve the Medical
Teaching Institution as civil
servant or may opt for the
employment of the Medical
Teaching Institution. The
option shall be exercised within
a period of ninety days after
commencement of this Act.
Those employees, who don't opt
for their absorption in the
Medical Teaching Institution so
notify, shall serve the Medical
Teaching Institution concerned
on their existing terms and
conditions.

4) After the commencement
of this Act, if the provisions of
this Act are applied to any
Medicinal Teaching Institution
within the meaning of Section-
3 of this Act, all civil servants
serving in Medical Teaching
Insituti8on, shall be given an
option either to continue to
serve the Institution as civil
servant, or may opt for the
employment of the Institution.
The option shall be exercised
within a period of ninety days
after the notification of a
Medical Teaching Institution
under-3 of the Act. Those
employees, who don’t opt for
their absorption in the Medical
Teaching Institution so notify,
shall serve the Medical

Ijaz
Ijaz

Teaching Institution concerned
on their existing terms and
conditions.

5) The option under _ sub-
section (4) once exercised shall
be final. A civil servant, who
opt to serve the Medical
Teaching Institution, _ shall
cease to be civil servant from
the date of his absorption in
the service of the Medical
Teaching Institution concerned
and their seniority, pension
and other matters vis-a-vis
with the employees of the
Medical Teaching Institution,
shall be determined in the
manner, as may be prescribed
by rules.

6) If at any time, a Medical
Teaching Institution reverts to
Government for running under
its own administration and
management for any reason,
the employees appointed under
sub-section (1) shall continue
to serve the Medical Teaching
Institution, on the same terms
and conditions as applicable to
them immediately before such
reversion.”

8. According to the above Provision
the employees of the KTH were directed to
exercise their option and in this respect the
petitioners exercised their choice to opt to
serve the institution. The record reveals that
petitioner Akbar Shah after promulgation of

the said Act was transferred from KTH to
Ijaz

Health Department to serve as MS Buner
but that transfer order was suspended by
this Court vide interim order dated
14.04.2015 and thereafter petitioner Dr.
Akbar Shah submitted his option to join the
institution in view of above referred Section
16 of MTI Act 2015. With regard to transfer
of Dr. Akbar Shah it is held that the MD has
no authority to transfer the same petitioner
as firstly after promulgation he became
institutional employee by operation of law.
Secondly, petitioner was transferred without
lawful authority and illegally transferred from
Medical Teaching Institution to Provincial
Government Department and thirdly the
operation of same transfer order was
suspended by this Court vide order dated
14.04.2015, so petitioner remained an
institutional employee who exercised his
option to continue institutional employee of
MTl of Khyber Teaching Hospital within
prescribed period of 90 days. In this respect

wisdom is derived from the judgment of
Ijaz

Hon’ble Supreme Court in C.P No.157 of
2017 in case titled as Dr. Muhammad Inam
Vs Dr. Waseem Anwar & others dated
27.02.2014.

9. In the instant petition and all
connected petitions the option proformas
was perused vide which the petitioners had
opted to join and remain the Medical
Teaching Institution, so the arguments of the
learned counsel for respondents _ that
petitioners have not opted in view of Section
16 of MTI Act 2015 is not supported with any
contrary record and in this respect have not
annexed any document.

10. Moreover in the said MTI Act the MD
has not been authorized to set aside the
option exercised by the _ institutional
employee to set aside the said option. So
transferring any employee after promulgation
of MTS Act without first making offer to
exercise option is without lawful authority.
Furthermore the arguments of learned

counsel for respondents that some 150
Ijaz

12

Doctors being institutional employees have
exercised their option to continue as
institutional employee, out of which the
option exercised by 100 employees was
accepted by the MD and of rest was not
accepted is not supported by the MTI Act, so
same argument is not valid as the Act do not
authorized the MD or other respondents to
revoke the option exercised by _ the
institutional employees.

11. Thus, in view of the above
discussions, we are of the view that the
petitioners have locus standi and cause of
action being institutional employees who had
exercised their option within prescribed of 90
days. Therefore, all the petitions are allowed
and consequently impugned orders are set
aside and petitioners are declared as
employees of MTI Khyber Teaching
Hospital.

Announced.
