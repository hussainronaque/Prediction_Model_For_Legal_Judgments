MINGORA BENCH (DAR-UL-QAZA), SWAT
(Judicial Department)

Cr.M. Q.P. No. 54-M/2017
(Gul Zada vs. Hazrat Gul & others)

Present: Mr. Hazrat Rehman, Advocate for the
petitioner.

M/S Dost Muhammad Khan and Fayaz
Muhammad Qazi, Advocates for the
private respondents.

Mr. Sohail Sultan, Asst:A.G for the State.
Date of hearing: 20.06.2022

JUDGMENT
MUHAMMAD IJAZ KHAN, J.- Through the
instant quashment petition, petitioner seeks
quashment of the order and judgment of the learned
Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi, Dir
Lower at Chakdara dated 14.07.2017, whereby he
accepted the revision petition of respondent No. |
namely Hazrat Gul and thereby set aside the order
of the Worthy Assistant Commissioner, Adenzai at
Chakdara dated 28.07.2016, who vide the same had
dismissed the complaint filed by the respondent

No. | being not maintainable.

2. For the purpose of better
understanding and brevity, the respondent No. 1,
who brought the instant complaint under section
145 Cr. PC hereinafter is to be referred as First

Party, respondents No. 2 to 13 against whom the

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad liaz Khan
-2-
instant complaint was initially brought by the First

Party are to be referred as Second Party and the
present petitioner, who was not arrayed as a party
in the complaint but was later on impleaded
through his own application is to be referred as

Third Party.

3. Precisely the facts of the case are
that the First Party filed a complaint under section
145 Cr. PC stating therein that he (First Party) and
the respondents No. 2 to 13 (Second Party) are
belonging to the same village namely Tiso Bala
(YL saH), where the First Party is the owner to the
extent of 03 Pachai (local unit of measurement of
land) of land/shuwara/mountain being a purchased
owner, which he has purchased from Afghanan-e-
Ouch (g 5! obe4!), whereas the whole land/shuwara/
mountain is measuring as 72 Pachai (is>4) and that
the said land/shuwara/mountain is their joint
property and every owner is in possession to the
extent of his share, however, the Second Party (i.e.
respondents No. 2 to 13) are interfering in his
lawful possession as they have started breaking the
stones and are busy in plaining the area and in the
process, they are also cutting the trees standing

over the disputed property and as such through this

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Jjaz Khan
-3-
exercise, they are trying their level best to take

possession of the property which is in possession of
the First Party and thus this controversy may lead
to a blood feud and is also causing the breach of

peace.

4. When the aforesaid complaint was
received by the Worthy Additional Assistant
Commissioner, he asked the local SHO for
submitting his report and the same was accordingly
submitted by him alongwith a site plan, which
stipulates that the area under dispute between the
two parties is a huge area and the whole land/
shuwara/mountain has been shown as a disputed
property and as such he recommended for
attachment of the same. In view of the report
of IHC, the Worthy Additional Assistant
Commissioner passed a preliminary order, whereby
he attached the disputed property vide order dated

13.04.2015.

5. It merits to mention here that the Third
Party (present petitioner namely Gul Zada) was not
made party in the present complaint, however, after
passing of the preliminary order dated 13.04.2015,
he got knowledge of the instant proceedings

pending before the Additional Assistant

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
e

-4.

Commissioner, therefore he rushed to the said
Court and submitted an application for his
impleadment in the complaint filed by the First
Party, which was duly replied by both the parties,
where both of them are unanimous in their stances
qua the joint ownership of both the parties, whereas
the ownership-in-possession of the petitioner/Third
Party was denied. It is interesting to note that even
the Second Party is not claiming his possession
rather he is following the steps of First Party by
stating that the disputed land/shuwara/mountain is
their joint ownership-in-possession. The learned
Additional Assistant Commissioner vide order
dated 18.03.2016 allowed the application of the
Third Party for his impleadment in the aforesaid

complaint.

6. After his impleadment, the present
petitioner/Third Party filed an application for
summary dismissal of the complaint being not
maintainable due to its nature of being a civil
dispute and a dispute between the co-owners
regarding their respective shares. To this
application, both the parties submitted their replies,
however, the said application was allowed by the

Worthy Assistant Commissioner vide order and

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-5-
judgment dated 28.07.2016 and __ thereafter

dismissed the complaint filed by the First Party
terming the same as a dispute between the
co-owners over their respective shares as well as on
the ground that the same has been filed by the First
and Second Party with ill-will intention against the
Third Party. This order of the Worthy Assistant
Commissioner was challenged by the First Party
before the learned Sessions Judge/ Zilla Qazi, Dir
Lower at Timergara in a revision petition, which
was allowed vide the impugned order and judgment
dated 14.07.2017 and the complaint was remanded
back to the Worthy Assistant Commissioner for
proceeding with the same in accordance with law.
This order and judgment has now been challenged
by the Third Party, then respondent No. 13, before
this Court through the instant quashment petition,
however, it may be noted that the Second Party for
reasons best known to them, have not challenged

the aforesaid order and judgment before this Court.

7. Arguments of learned counsel for the
parties were heard in considerable detail and the
record perused with their able assistance in a day-

long arguments.

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad ijaz Khan

-6-

In this case, there are four questions

which are to be determined by this Court. The same

are as under:-

he

. Whether the language of the complaint

filed by the First Party and its reply by
the Second Party does or does not
constitute a civil dispute regarding the
partition of their respective shares?

. Whether in absence of any claim qua

the exclusive possession of the disputed
property, a complaint under section
145 Cr. PC would be maintainable?

. Whether in absence of existence of a

dispute between the parties which may
likely to cause breach of peace, a
complaint under section 145 Cr. PC
would be maintainable?

. Whether the complaint has been filed

in good-faith or with ill-intention and
as to whether the two parties through
the instant complaint have joined
hands against the present petitioner
and as an attempt to nullify the already
proceedings culminated in favour of
the present petitioner?

Determination of question (1):

Whether the language of the complaint
filed by the First Party and its reply by
the Second Party does or does not
constitute a civil dispute regarding the
partition of their respective shares?

If one perused the complaint of the

First Party on the touchstone of the above criteria, it

may be noted that it speaks that the disputed land/

shuwara/mountain is a huge area comprising of

millions of feet and as per the local unit, it is

measured as 72 Pachai of land out of which

admittedly the First Party claims his ownership to

Abdul Sabooh/*

(S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
Nem

-7-
the extent of 03 Pachai of land, whereas the Second

Party claims their ownership of 69 Pachai of land
and the ownership-in-possession of the present
petitioner/Third Party as per his assertion has been
purposely not brought on record and thus the pre-
requisite conditions for maintaining proceedings
under section 145 Cr. PC are not spelling out from
the same rather the same speaks of a suit for

possession through partition.

10. The aforesaid lacunas/flaws in the
complaint which glean from the plain reading of it
are further substantiated from the reply submitted
by the Second Party as they too follow the steps of
the First Party by stating that they are owners of the
remaining 69 Pachai of land and acknowledging
the ownership of the First Party to the extent of 03
Pachai of land with a open heart and as such both
the parties are admitting that it is a joint property

between the two rival parties.

11. Determination of question (2):

Whether in absence of any claim qua
the exclusive possession of the disputed
property, a complaint under section
145 Cr. PC would be maintainable?

If one sees the above stated stances of
both the parties against each other, then it is

undisputedly established that they are not claiming

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
)

-8-
any “exclusive possession” against each other. The

complaint itself is a vague, evasive and standing in
vacuum regarding the specific and perfect portion
of the land which is in “possession” of the First
Party and which has been interfered with by the
Second Party and as against this, it appears that
both the parties through the instant complaint under
section 145 Cr. PC are trying to ascertain their
respective portions/shares of land. It may be noted
that the pray made by the respondent No. 1 in his
complaint is of much relevance and speaks of the
hidden intention of the complainant, which is

reproduced below:-

LIB RAE Verse yt Sele cA thet"

IIIA ASAF At LGU Slugs Wyle 145 33

LE eID) hi Seo gt ttyl ae 0

"Uf bbljsleeliol
The aforesaid pray manifests that the
respondent No. ]/complainant wants that his share
may be separated and may be handed over to him,
therefore the complaint filed by him falls short
of the legal requirements for maintaining or
proceeding with the same. The question of title
or claiming share or separation of share could
not be determined in proceedings under section

145 Cr. PC and thus, this aspect of the case was

Abdul Sabooh/* {S.B.} Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-9-
rightly appreciated by the Worthy Assistant

Commissioner. In a case of this jurisdiction titled
Mst. Rifat Rana vs. Rashid Mahmood reported
as PLD 2019 Peshawar 230, it was held that
proceedings under section 145, Cr.P.C. are meant
to avoid breach of peace and in no way amounts
to be decided after discussing a title dispute or a

dispute of restoration of possession.

12. As stated above that proceedings
under section 145 Cr. PC would only be
maintainable if the two rival parties claim their
exclusive possession without having any interest or
care of the opposite party and such dispute is of
such a nature that it has either created a law and
order situation or the same is likely to create the
breach of peace, however, in the present case, the
contents of the complaint filed by the First Party
and its reply by the Second Party would manifestly
show that both the parties appear to be very
friendly as they are accepting the ownership and
possession of each other over the disputed property
which is comprising of a huge area. It also
manifests that either of the party has not claimed or
asserted their possession on any of the specific

portion of the disputed property by describing them

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Jjaz Khan
-10-
through boundaries or any other mode of

specification and as such the claims of both the
parties as per the available material are standing in
vacuum. Jt may be reiterated that nothing is
available on file to show that the said dispute has
either already caused breach of peace or is likely to
create the chance of breach of peace as both of
them admit the possession of each other with open
heart since long without any incident of any
apprehension of law and order situation. In the case
of Saleem-ur-Rehman vs. Fagir Hussain &
others reported as 2004 SCMR_667, the Hon’ble
Apex Court has held that the question of
entitlement of land is not a matter of consideration
before a Magistrate while exercising jurisdiction
under section 145 Cr. PC. Such question is always
to be decided by a civil Court. A criminal Court is
only supposed to determine the factum of actual
physical possession on the crucial dates.

13. It may also be noted that in the present
case, both the parties have not come forward to
claim possession of any specific portion of the
disputed land and as such the complaint filed by the
First Party lacks the pre-requisite conditions for

maintaining a complaint under section 145 Cr. PC.

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-ll-

In the case of Ghulam Maseih alias Gaman and
another _vs. Ch. Abdur Rehman and 3 others
reported as 1973 P Cr. L J 439, it was held that the
respondent/vendee could not prove his actual
physical possession of any specific Khasra number
out of the entire land shown to have been passed to
him and as such, the respondent at the best could be
a co-sharer with the other heirs of such property. It
was also held that proceedings under section 145
Cr. PC are not applicable to the case of parties who
are in joint possession of the property. Similarly, in
the case of Sultan Room and 6 others vs. Bakht
Karam and another reported as 2010 MLD 1669,
it was held that when one of the party was in
possession of the joint property, then the recourse
for the other party would not be under section 145
Cr. PC as it appeared from the main complaint
under section 145 Cr. PC that one party in the
complaint has admitted the possession of the other
party. Exercise of jurisdiction by the Magistrate in
such circumstances would amount to unlawful
exercise of jurisdiction and continuation of such
proceedings would certainly amount to abuse of the

process of Court.

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-12-
14. As discussed above that none of the

parties who were before the Magistrate except the
present petitioner who was claiming exclusive
possession against each other as the complaint itself

and reply to the same speaks of their compromising

position. In the case of Abdus Salam Meaji and

others vs. Abdul Kadir Bepari reported as PLD

1967 Dacca 715, it was held that Section 145 Cr.
PC contemplates dispute between two parties each
claiming exclusive possession against other and
opposing group of partners cannot claim exclusive
possession of such property and as such
proceedings under section 145 Cr. PC are not
competent, however, if the Magistrate deems
necessary, can draw up proceedings under S. 144 in
such case. It was also held that the property in
question is the subject-matter of a partnership
business, therefore, in law and in-fact, the property
is in possession of all the partners. This proceeding
was instituted at the instance of the Ist party
opposite-party in this petition. I asked the learned
Advocate for the opposite-party to point out from
the materials before me that exclusive possession
was claimed by him. He failed to do so. The
position therefore, is that neither the petitioner nor

the opposite-party claims or, can have exclusive

Abdul Sabooh/* {S.B.)  Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-13-

possession. That being so, a proceeding under
section 145 is misconceived and the impugned
order must be set aside. Similarly, the Calcutta
High Court in the case of Tarujan Bibee_v.
Asamuddi Bepari and others (4 C W_N 426) has
held that in this case the Magistrate seems to have
found that both parties are in possession, and
therefore this was not a case in which he was
competent to make an order under section 145.
Section 145 seems to contemplate a dispute
between two parties each of which claims to hold
possession as against the other. The last part of the
order is moreover manifestly bad but inasmuch as
the first part has also been declared to be bad, the

whole of the order is set aside.

15. Determination of question (3):

Whether in absence of existence of a
dispute between the parties which may
likely to cause breach of peace, a
complaint under section 145 Cr. PC
would be maintainable?

The First Party has not stated a single
word in his complaint with respect to any past
history or any active dispute between the two
parties, which may justify the existence of
apprehension of the breach of peach due to the said
dispute and as such in absence of a dispute between

the parties over the possession of the subject

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-14-

property would take such controversy from the
domain of Magistrate who is seized of a complaint
under section 145 Cr. PC. As stated above that the
dispute as find mentioned in Section 145 Cr. PC
should be of such a nature, which may likely to
cause breach of peace and in absence of such
apprehension of breach of peace, the Magistrate
would lack the jurisdiction to entertain the
proceedings. In the present case, both the parties
appear to be in friendly terms as they are accepting
each other ownership-in-possession over the
disputed property. In the case of Mukhtiar Ahmad
and others vs. Haji Muhammad Saleem and
another reported as 2013 SCMR 357, the Hon’ble
Apex Court has held that provision of Section 145
Cr. PC clearly envisages the apprehension of
breach of peace as a jurisdictional requirement,
issue of possession of a party could only be gone
into by a Magistrate after his jurisdictional
requirement is satisfied. It was further held that
Section 145 Cr. PC did not authorize a Magistrate
to exercise jurisdiction on mere existence of a
dispute relating to an immovable property as the
purpose of Section 145 Cr. PC was to prevent
imminent apprehension of breach of peace over the

immovable or movable property. In the case of

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-15-
Municipal Committee, Kohat vs. Mst. Piari

reported as AJR 1947 Peshawar 8, it was held that
it appears from the order of the trial Court that
though the parties were at issue so far as the
question of the apprehension of the breach of peace
is concerned, he gave no finding on it. The mere
existence of a dispute between the parties does not
Justify the exercise of jurisdiction conferred by
S. 145, Criminal P.C. on the Criminal Courts. The
only justification for an order by a Criminal Court
under §. 145, Criminal P.C., is the danger to the
public peace. The absence of any finding to the
effect that there was any such apprehension vitiated
the order. The settlement of disputes relating to
property which are not likely to lead to a breach of
the peace is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Civil Courts. The jurisdiction of the Criminal Court
cannot be invoked except on the ground of the

likelihood of a breach of the peace. Similarly, in the

case of Haji Shamsuddin Ismail and others vs.
The State_and others reported as PLD 1969
Karachi 515, it was held that the learned
Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Nazimabad failed to
appreciate the policy of law contained in section
145 (1), Criminal Procedure Code inasmuch as

before entering upon his jurisdiction he was

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-16-
required to be satisfied from a police-report or other

information that a dispute", likely to cause the
breach of the peace exists or existed. This was a
condition precedent to the exercise of his said
Jurisdiction whereafter alone he could competently
make an order in writing stating the ground of his
being so satisfied and requiring the parties to the
dispute to attend his Court on specified date. By
going through the complaint of respondents 2 and 3
it was noted that it nowhere alleged that any;
dispute likely to cause the breach of the peace
exists or had existed and consequently it must be
held that the leamed Sub-Divisional Magistrate
could not take cognizance of case nor could he pass
the impugned order under section 145 (4) Criminal
Procedure Code. This position would not alter the
least even if allegations of this nature were made in
a complaint but not supported by any evidence as
required by subsection (4) of section 145, Criminal
Procedure Code or admitted by the opposite-party.
Admittedly no evidence was produced before the
learned Magistrate to show that either a dispute
likely to cause the breach of the peace existed or
that the applicants had forcibly trespassed into the
Mill and taken its possession. In this view

obviously the learned Sub- Divisional Magistrate

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-17-

exceeded his jurisdiction in passing the impugned
order. In the case of Qazi Gran vs. Muhammad
Jan and State reported as PLJ 1996 SC 1142, it
was held that Section 145 Cr.P.C. deals with the
procedure where dispute concerning immovable
property is likely to cause breach of peace. It does
not suffice for proceedings under this section
that there should be a dispute but it is necessary
also that there should be a dispute likely to cause a
breach of peace. The primary object of provision
is the prevention of breach of public peace arising
in respect of dispute relatingto immovable
property. The settlement of dispute relating to
property which is not likely to lead to a breach of
peace is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the civil
court. If there was/is no imminent danger to the
public peace, the magistrate need not take
cognizance of an application under section
145 Cr.P.C. and also need not determined the
factum of actual physical possession of the
disputed property/ land. It was also held in the
case of Shamshamir Khan vs. The State and 6
others reported as PED 1999 Peshawar 70, that
the dispute between the parties being totally of civil
nature, could not be made a ground for proceedings

under section 145, Cr.P.C. and such proceedings

Abdul Sahanh/* {QR Honthle Mr Inctica Muhammad Tiaz Khan
-18-
would mean nothing but to harass the petitioner.

The primary object and scope of section 145,
Cr.P.C. is the prevention of breach of public peace
arising in respect of dispute relating to immovable
property. Settlement of dispute relating to property,
which is not likely to lead to a breach of peace is
within the exclusive jurisdiction of Civil Court.
Where there is no imminent danger, as in this case,
to the public peace, Magistrate need not take
cognizance of an application under section 145,
Cr.P.C. The record of the case does not suggest any
imminent danger of peace necessitating
continuation of proceedings under section 145,
Cr.P.C. In this case, the proceedings remained
pending for a long time but there was no breach of
peace. Section 145, Cr.P.C. deals with the
procedure where dispute concerning immovable
property is likely to cause breach of peace. It does
not suffice for proceedings under this section that
there should be a dispute but it is necessary also
that there should be a dispute likely to cause a
breach of peace. In the case of Malik Manzoor
Elahi_vs. Lala_Bishambar Dass and another
reported as PLD 1964 Supreme Court 137, the
Hon’ble Apex Court has held that the provisions of

section 145 read as a whole clearly indicate that

Abdu! Sabooh/* (S.B.} Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad [jaz Khan
-19-
there should be a continuing danger of a breach of

peace till the time the final order is made. The use
of the word ‘exists’ in the present tense in
subsection (5) connotes that the dispute must
continue to exist even at the time when the
objection is raised. The main purpose of this
section being the maintenance of public peace and
the prevention of breaches thereof it would follow
that where there is no danger at any point of time of
any further breach of public peace taking place,
then manifestly the invocation of the summary
procedure provided by this section is no longer
called for and should be put an end to. Similarly,
this Court in the case of Abdur Razaq and 3
others vs. The State and 2 others reported as PLD
2004 Peshawar 87, has also held that it is by now
well settled that jurisdiction of the criminal Court
under section 145, Cr.P.C can only be invoked on
the ground of likelihood of breach of peace and
for such purpose the Court intending to take
cognizance of the matter must consider objectively
the facts and circumstances of the case and to
satisfy itself whether likelihood of breach of peace
exists or not. The Hon’ble Apex Court in the case
of Chaudhary Munir vs. Mst. Surriya_and

others reported as PLD 2007 Supreme Court 189,

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan

-20-
has held that there is no cavil with the proposition

that the prime object of the proceedings under
section 145, Cr.P.C. is to prevent a breach of peace
and to maintain status quo till the controversy is
decided by the civil Court of competent
jurisdiction. The purpose of proceedings under
section 145, Cr.P.C. is to meet an emergent
situation in order to maintain peace and further to
enable the parties to set the controversy at naught
through civil court qua the title or claim of the
property in dispute. It is mandatory requirement of
section 145, Cr.P.C. that there must not only a
dispute but it is essential that a dispute is likely to
cause breach of peace. In the case of Husein Ali J.
Merchant vs. The State and 2 others reported as
2003 YLR 1742, it was held that the applicant is not
residing at the alleged disputed property although
the applicant has possession of one room in the said
house. At present there is no material that any
apprehension of breach of peace arising between
the parties. The provisions of section 145, Cr.P.C.
is designed to meet an emergent situation only
pausing threat to the peace and cannot be used for
settling the rights of the parties on their claim of

title.

Abdu! Sabooh/* (S.B.} Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-2)-
16. Determination of question (4):

Whether the complaint has been filed
in good-faith or with ill-intention and
as to whether the two parties through
the instant complaint have joined
hands against the present petitioner
and as an attempt to nullify the
already proceedings culminated in
favour of the present petitioner?

Now to address the fourth question
that the proceedings have been initiated by the First
Party against the Second Party with the ill-will and
malafide, where he did not implead the present
petitioner as a party as the record which is to be
highlighted would show that much before filing of
the instant complaint, proceedings initiated under
section 145 Cr. PC by the present petitioner have
been culminated into his successful delivery of
possession. The record appended with the instant
quashment petition would show that earlier an FIR
bearing No. 261 dated 16.07.2011 under sections
506/148/149/427 PPC of Police Station Ouch,
District Dir Lower was registered by the present
petitioner namely Gul Zada against 39 persons
including respondent No. 1 namely Hazrat Gul for
their interference in the disputed Shuwara (05! 9).
Later on, the local police converted the same into a
complaint filed under section 145 Cr. PC and
submitted the same to the local SHO on

17.10.2011. The local SHO prepared the site plan

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
Nes

-22-
specifically showing a portion of the disputed

property which is in possession of the present
petitioner. The said complaint after going through a
full-fledged trial culminated in favour of the
present petitioner vide order dated 07.10.2013,
whereby the petitioner was found entitled for
possession of the disputed property. Later on, the
present petitioner filed an application to the Worthy
Additional Assistant Commissioner Dir Lower at
Chakdara on 21.10.2013 for execution of the
aforesaid order dated 07.10.2013 and delivery of
possession, which was accordingly delivered to him
vide order dated 02.12.2013. The original order
dated 07.10.2013 was challenged by the Second
Party in a revision petition, however their revision
was dismissed by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi, Dir Lower at Chakdara vide

order and judgment dated 18.06.2014.

17. It also merits to mention here that non-
impleadment of the present petitioner by the First
Party in the instant complaint is an active
connivance of the Second Party as in February,
2013, a suit was filed by the Second Party against
the present petitioner for cancellation of a partition

deed dated 10.10.2004. It would be relevant to

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.)  Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-23-
mention here that the record would show that the

Second Party has executed a power of attorney in
favour of Muhammad Iqbal to pursue the aforesaid
suit, where the First Party namely Hazrat Gul has
been shown as a witness of the said power of
attorney. The written statement filed by the present
petitioner in the said suit would show the factual
position qua the entitlement of petitioner to the
extent of 01 Pachai of land and that the whole
Shuwara/ mountain is of 72 Pachai of land, where
he specifically stated that the property which is in
his possession is marked, however, interestingly the
said suit was withdrawn by the plaintiffs on
02.06.2015 with permission to file a fresh one but

till date, no suit has been filed by the respondents.

18. The record further shows that when
the revision petition filed by the First Party earlier
in the proceedings initiated by the present petitioner
under section 145 Cr. PC was dismissed by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi,
Dir Lower at Chakdara vide order and judgment
dated 18.06.2014, then the First Party soon
thereafter has filed the instant complaint just to

defeat the effect of the proceedings which were

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-24-

culminated into successful delivery of possession

of the present petitioner.

19. From the above discussion, it can
easily be gathered that non-impleadment of the
present petitioner in the instant complaint by the
First Party prima facie speaks of the active
connivance of the Second Party. It further finds
support from the concessional and compromising
position taken by both the parties against each
other. The aforesaid active connivance could also
be read from the fact that when the revisional Court
remanded the case for regular trial of the complaint
filed by the First Party, then the said order has not
been challenged by the Second Party before this
Court like the present petitioner. Even before this
Court during the course of arguments, learned
counsel representing the Second Party was
supporting the remand order of the complaint and
on the query that how he could support
continuation of the complaint and instead why not
for the out-right dismissal of the complaint, his
reply was that they too want the separation of their
portion of land but after recording of evidence. This
stance by itself speaks volume that through the

instant proceedings both the parties intend to

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad [jaz Khan
-25-
ascertain their portion of land in the disputed

land/Shuwara/mountain and as such the instant
proceedings have been filed by the two parties just
to deprive the present petitioner from the fruits of
proceedings which have already been ended in his

favour.

20. From the above exposition of law on

the subject, it is held and declared as under:-

1. That proceedings under section 145
Cr. PC could only be initiated if there
is a dispute regarding the land, water
or boundaries of land but such dispute
should be of such a nature which has
either raised or is likely to raise
apprehension of breach of peace;

2. Proceedings under section 145 Cr. PC
could not be initiated for establishment
the question of title or for the
separation of shares amongst the joint
owners;

3. Proceedings under section 145 Cr. PC
could only be maintainable if the rival
parties claim exclusive possession
against each other and such dispute has
turned them inimical to each other;

4. Proceedings under section 145 Cr. PC
could not be maintainable where the
contents and language of the complaint
speak of a civil dispute amongst the
joint owners/co-owners.

21. Accordingly, the instant quashment
petition is allowed and it is held that the Worthy
Assistant Commissioner has rightly appreciated
the facts and circumstances of this case and has

nipped the evil in the bud at the initial stage by

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-26-

dismissing the complaint while the learned
revisional Court through the impugned order and
judgment dated 14.07.2017 has wrongly remanded
the complaint back to the Worthy Assistant
Commissioner for proceeding with the same in
accordance with law, therefore the impugned order
and judgment dated 14.07.2017 passed by the
learned revisional Court is set aside whereas that of
the Worthy Assistant Commissioner dated

28.07.2016 is restored and maintained.
