ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- Petitioner Muhammad
Siyar, seeks post arrest bail in case FIR No.346 dated
25.06.2019, registered under sections 302/148/149 PPC
and section 15 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013, at
Police Station Risalpur.

2. As per contents of FIR, complainant Jamal Nasir
was serving in National Bank, Mardan. On 25.06.2019, he
was present in the Bank when received information about
murder of his father Jehanzeb Khan, so he reached DHQ
hospital Nowshera, he saw dead body of his father
murdered with firearm. He charged unknown culprit (s) for
the offence. On 22.08.2019 i.e. after about two months of
the occurrence, complainant recorded his statement under
section 164 Cr.P.C. before the leanred Judicial Magistrate,
wherein he charged the petitioner along with co-accused
Ghulam Habib, Imran and Ihsan Ullah on the ground that
petitioner Muhammad Siyar had enmity with one

Asfandyar, whereas, the accused were sure that the
deceased was supporting the said Asfandyar, hence, this
case.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record perused.

4. Record depicts that complainant is not eyewitness
of the occurrence. Similarly, no one from the public has
come forward to furnish ocular account of the occurrence.
Though complainant in his statement under section 164
Cr.P.C., recorded after two months of the occurrence, has
directly charged the petitioner along with co-accused for
murder of his deceased father, but he has not disclosed the
source on the basis of which he got satisfied about
complicity of the petitioner in the commission of offence.
Motive advanced by the complainant after two months of
the occurrence is yet to be proved during trial. Co-accused
Imran and Ihsan Ullah having similar role as that of the
petitioner, have been granted bail by the learned trial Court
vide order dated 20.09.2019, against which no bail
cancellation application has been filed by the
prosecution/State. The only ground on the basis of which
petitioner has been refused bail by the learned trial Court is
that a 30 bore crime pistol has been shown recovered on
his pointation from a box inside the residential room of his
house on 26.08.2019. At the moment, an iota of evidence is
not available to show the said house to be the sole
ownership of the petitioner or that it was in his sole
occupation. Beside, the house search of the petitioner had
been shown conducted on 22.08.2019 by the LO. but
nothing incriminating has been shown recovered from his
house, whereas, the alleged pistol has been shown from his
house on 26.08.2019 i.e. after four days, that too on joint
pointation of the petitioner and co-accused Imran. Three
crime empties of 30 bore have been shown recovered from

the spot which according to FSL report have been fired
from one weapon, whereas no FSL report is available on
file that these empties have been fired from the pistol
allegedly recovered from the house of the petitioner. In
this view of the matter, it is yet to be determined during
trial as to whether alleged pistol is the crime weapon and if
yes, what would be its evidentiary value having been
shown recovered on joint pointation of two accused. In the
pointation memo the alleged crime pistol has been shown
to have been used by co-accused Imran and the said Imran
has already been granted bail by the learned trial Court.
The above discussed circumstances make the case of the
petitioner arguable for the purpose of bail. Moreso, total
five accused including the petitioner have been charged for
the occurrence whereas as per FSL report the empties have
been fired from one weapon. In this view of the matter,
whether the occurrence is the doing of single person or
otherwise, is also a debatable question which is yet to be
answered by the learned trial Court during trial.

5. For what has been discussed above, participation
of the petitioner in the commission of offence requires
further probe hence he is entitled to the concession of bail.
Accordingly, this petition is allowed. Accused/petitioner is
admitted to bail provided he furnishes bail bonds in the
sum of rupees two lac with two local, reliable and
resourceful sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial Magistrate/MOD
concerned.
