SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- Aamad Kamal alias Kamal
Khan and Iqbal Khan, appellants herein, have impugned the
judgment dated 16.11.2021, passed by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-HI, Lakki Marwat, whereby, they were
convicted under section 302(b)/34 PPC and sentenced to
imprisonment for life as Ta’zir and were made liable to pay
Rs.500,000/- as compensation under section 544-A (2) CrPC to
the legal heirs of deceased or in default thereof, to suffer S.I for
06 months, whereas, both the appellants / convicts were
acquitted of the charge under section 324 PPC. Benefit of
section 382-B CrPC extended as well. j

2. Complainant, Naimat Ullah, moved criminal revision

petition No.46-B/2021 for enhancement of sentence of the
appellants and Cr.A No.196-B/2021 against their acquittal
under section 324 PPC. Since all these matters have arisen out
of the same judgment, therefore, we intend to decide the same
through this common judgment.

3. Case of the prosecution, as divulged in the first
information report, in brevity, is that on 03.08.2014 at 23:15
hours, complainant Naimat Ullah, in presence of dead body of
his son Rehmat Ullah, reported the occurrence to the local
police in Emergency Ward of City Hospital, Lakki Marwat to
the effect that on the night of occurrence, he alongwith his
brother Zafar Khan and his deceased son Rehmat Ullah was
going to the mosque in their village for offering Isha prayer;
that Rehmat Ullah was some paces ahead and lights in the street
were glowing; that at 21:00 hours, when they were taking turn
in the street, accused / appellants Kamal Khan and Iqbal Khan
duly armed with Kalashnikovs were present there in the street
and raised voice at the complainant party that they would not be
spared and the moment started firing at them through their
respective weapons, due to which, Rehmat Ullah got hit,
injured and fell to the ground, while complainant and Zafar
Khan luckily escaped unhurt; that the accused decamped from
the spot after the commission of offence; that complainant and
Zafar Khan took the injured to the hcspital, but he succumbed

to the injuries on the way to hospital. Motive for the offence is
alleged to be altercation which had taken place between the
deceased and accused party. Hence, the instant case FIR.

4. After completion of investigation and arrest of the
accused / appellants, prosecution submitted supplementary
challans against them, where at the commencement of trial, the
prosecution produced and examined as many as 12 witnesses.
On close of prosecution evidence, statements of accused /
appellants were recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein
they professed innocence and false implication, however,
neither they opted to be examined on oath as provided under
section 340(2) Cr.P.C, nor wished to produce defence evidence.
After hearing arguments, the learned trial Court vide impugned
judgment dated 16.11.2021, convicted and sentenced the
accused / appellants Ahmad Kamal alias Kamal Khan and Iqbal
Khan as mentioned above. Hence, the instant appeal and
revision against the judgment of conviction.

5. We have heard learned counsel: for the parties alongwith
learned A.A.G for the State at length and with their valuable
assistance, the record was gone through.

6. The unfortunate incident claimed the life of the deceased,
who, after receiving firearm injuries, lost his life and was
shifted to Civil Hospital, Lakki Marwat where the matter was
reported. The complainant, while reporting the matter, charged

the appellants for the death of the deceased and after
registration of the case, the injury sheet and inquest report were
prepared and the dead body was ‘sent to the doctor for
postmortem examination. The investigating officer, after
receiving copy of the F.IR, visited the spot and on pointation of
the eye witnesses, prepared the site plan. During spot
inspection, the investigating officer collected 21 empties of
7.62 bore from the places of the appellants, whereas,
bloodstained earth was recovered from the place of the
deceased. During spot inspection, the investigating officer took
into possession a bulb installed on the main gate of the house of
the complainant and a tube light from an electric pole near the
place of occurrence. The collected empties were sent to the
firearms expert, where a report was received in positive with
explanation that the recovered empties were fired from different
weapons. The appellant Ahmad Kamal was arrested on
07.08.2019, when he could not succeed in getting his bail
before arrest confirmed, whereas, the;accused Iqbal Khan was
arrested on 12.06.2020. The appellants after their arrest faced
trial and on conclusion of the trial, the learned trial court was
pleased to convict the appellants vide the impugned judgment.
Feeling disgruntled, the appellants approached this Court
through the instant criminal appeals.:As both the appeals are
arising out of one and the same judgment, so we intend to

decide the same through a consolidated judgment.
7. The learned trial court dealt with the matter
comprehensively and after application of judicial mind to the
collected evidence on file and the recorded statements before
the trial court, convicted the appellants as mentioned above.

8. Though, the learned trial judge applied his judicial mind
to the record of the case and while returning a guilty verdict
against the appellant, all the material: aspects of the case were
taken into consideration and thereafter, the fate of the appellants
was determined. True that in the incident, the deceased lost his
life owing to oral altercation, but equally true that the matter
was reported by his real father to the local police after shifting
the dead body to the Civil Hospital, Lakki Marwat, but the
same does not absolve the prosecution of its liability to
establish its case through independent witnesses. As in the
incident, two real brothers were charged and convicted, so we
feel it essential to scan through the record once again, so to
know as to whether the approach of the learned trial court was
correct and as to whether the learned trial judge, while passing
the impugned judgment, took into consideration the material
aspects of the case. This being the Court of appeal is under the
obligation to reassess the already assessed evidence, so that
miscarriage of justice could be avoided.

9. The tragic incident occurred on 03.08.2014 at 21:00

hours, when the deceased, in the company of his father (the
complainant) and his real uncle, were on their way to the local
mosque to perform Isha prayer. It is the case of the prosecution
that when the deceased took a turn in the street, the assailants,
who were already present, duly armed, started firing at them,
which resulted into injuries on the person of deceased and, who,
after receiving firearm injuries, rushed back and fell on the
ground at point No.1A, wherefrom the investigating officer
recovered bloodstained earth, The moot questions for
determination before this court are, as to whether the incident
occurred in the mode, manner and at the stated time; and as to
whether the complainant alongwith the deceased was present
when he received firearm injuries; and as to whether the matter
was reported in the manner and at the stated time and as to
whether these were the appellants who killed the deceased. In
order to resolve the controversy, we deem it essential to go
through the statements of the witnesses who appeared before
the trial court. The complainant was examined as PW-08 who
stated that on the day of incident, he alongwith the deceased
and the eye witness were on their way to the local mosque,
when they took a turn, the appellants were already present duly
armed, started firing at the deceased: and the deceased, after
receiving firearm injuries, fell to the ground and while shifting
to the hospital, the deceased succumbed to the injuries; that the

complainant alongwith the eye witness accompanied the dead
body to the hospital where the matter was reported to the local
police; that after doing the needful, they accompanied the
investigating officer to the spot and on their pointation, the site
plan was prepared. It is essential to note that while reporting the
matter, the complainant disclosed that soon after leaving their
house, when they took a turn in the street, the deceased was
fired at and that the accused were identified in the light of
bulbs, which were installed on different houses in the street.
The complainant was examined on this particular aspect of the
case, where he stated that the investigating officer recovered a
bulb from the main gate of his house and another, installed in
the electric pole. It is pertinent to mention that the investigating
officer, while preparing the site plan, allegedly took into
possession a bulb from the main gate of the complainant which
has been shown at point-D, whereas, the recovered tube light
from the electric pole is mentioned at point-A in the site plan.
As at the time of incident, it was pitched dark and that the
complainant and eye witness were able to identify the assailants
in the bulbs light installed at the place of incident, so its
importance cannot be overlooked and the same needs
consideration. While going through the site plan, it transpired
that the place where the deceased received firearm injuries no
electric tube light was installed. It was argued that the assailants

were identified in the tube light installed in the electric pole. In
order to ascertain as to whether the identification from such a
long distance i.e. the pole where the tube light was installed,
and the assailants wherefrom they fired at the deceased, was
possible? To resolve the controversy, we deem it essential to go
through the statements of the witnesses and that of the
investigating officer. The complainant was examined as PW-08
who stated that the inter se distance between the electric pole
and the assailants was 35 paces with further explanation that the
deceased was seven paces ahead from them, whereas, the
distance between the assailants and the deceased is given as
eight paces. Keeping in view the distance between the parties
and that of the electric pole, it does not appeal to a prudent
mind that from such a long distance of more than seventy feet
the identification was possible. It is interesting to note that the
investigating officer, during spot. inspection, took into
possession an electric bulb from the main gate of the
complainant, but he did not collect any bulb from the house
where the deceased received firearm injuries. If we admit to
what the complainant stated, as correct that different lights were
installed on the surrounding houses, then in that eventuality, it
would have been of prime importance for the investigating
officer to collect an electric bulb from the house of one Habib
Ullah, where the deceased received firearm injuries. The

circumstances do suggest that the deceased was not fired at, at
point No.1, rather he was fired at, at point No.1A, in front of his
house. The physical circumstances of the case run in conflict
with the statements of the witnesses, had the deceased received
firearm injuries at point No.1, then there was hardly an occasion
for him to rush back to point No.1A, as the injuries received by
the deceased were on the most sensitive parts of the body. If,
for the sake of arguments, we admit that the deceased received
firearm injuries at point No.1 and fell on the ground at point
No.1A, then in that eventuality, the investigating officer would
have found the trail of blood between the two points, but
neither he mentioned the same nor it was found. This
circumstance of the case negates the version of the complainant
and it gives birth to suspicion that the deceased did not receive
firearm injuries on the stated position.

10. It is pertinent to mention that .if the deceased and eye
witnesses were present on the points, as have been shown in the
site plan, then in that eventuality, the complainant and eye
witness would have also received firearm injuries, but they did
not. The complainant in his court statement stated that the street
was closed towards north, but surprisingly, the investigating
officer did not notice any bullet mark on the surrounding walls.
The complainant, when appeared before the Court, stated that
he alongwith the deceased and the witness were on their way to

the local mosque to perform Isha prayer, when the incident
-10-

occurred. This has time & again come from the mouth of the
witnesses that Isha prayer was to be performed at 09:00 PM.
We cannot ignore that the witnesses stated that it was their
routine to go to the mosque and perform prayer, if we take it
correct, then in that eventuality, the complainant, eye witness
and the deceased would have gone to the mosque a little earlier.
The record tells that it was the deceased who was walking
ahead, whereas, in this part of the country, if father and a son
would go to the mosque together, then as a matter of respect,
the elders take the lead and the youngster follows. If all the
three left the house together, then there was hardly an occasion
for the deceased to go eight paces ahead, rather all the three
would walk together. The complainant, when appeared before
the trial Court, stated that soon they took a turn, the assailants
fired at them, whereas, the site planidepicts that after taking
turn, the deceased walked eight paces towards the assailants.
So, the witnesses remained inconsistent on this particular aspect
of the case and even, the site plan contradicts the stance of the
complainant.

11. The deceased, after receiving. firearm injuries, as per
statement of the complainant, survived for considerable time
and while en-route to the hospital, succumbed to the injuries.
This is for the prosecution to explain that when the occurrence

took place at 09:00 PM, what took it to consume a long two and
-1l-

a half hours to report the matter. The eye witness was examined
as PW-09, who stated that after collecting the dead body from
the spot, they reached to the hospital at 10:00 PM, whereas, in
the same breath, he further explained that it was 10:08 PM that
they reached to the hospital. If we go with what the witnesses
stated, then it is for the prosecution to explain that why the
matter was not reported soon after reaching to the hospital. This
is intriguing to note that the dead body was received by the
doctor for postmortem examination at 11:00 PM and the same
was completed at 11:30 PM, whereas, the report was made at
11:15 PM. The prosecution remained silent on this particular
aspect of the case and even, if the statements of the witnesses
are taken to be correct, then in that eventuality, the time of
report and the time when the postmortem examination was
conducted, do not support each other.iIt is pertinent to mention
that after reporting the matter, the injury sheet and inquest
report were prepared. In the relevant column of the inquest
report, the time of death is mentioned as 21:30 hours, which
further belies the stance of the complainant regarding the time
of occurrence. In order to ascertain as to whether the deceased
received firearm injuries at 09:00 PM or earlier, we deem it
essential to go through the opinion of the doctor, who, at the
time of postmortem examination, mentioned the time between

injury and death from one to 1 — 1/2 hours. As the witnesses
-12-

went in conflict regarding the survival of the deceased after
receiving the firearm injuries and when the doctor mentioned
the time between injury and death as | — % hours, then the
statements of all these three witnesses when placed in
juxtaposition, no other opinion can be formed, but that the
incident did not occur at the stated time. Both the witnesses i.e.
the complainant and the eye witness did not support each other
regarding the place where the deceased died, as the complainant
stated that soon after receiving firearm injuries, the deceased
fell on the ground, and so the eye witness, but the complainant
never stated that after receiving firea:m injuries, the deceased
rushed back and fell at point No.1A. The conflict between the
statements of witnesses and the site plan leave no ambiguity to
hold that the deceased received firearm injury at point No.1A
and not at point No.1.

12. It was after 12:00 midnight tha: the investigating officer
visited the spot after receiving copy of the F.I.R, to be more
specific, the investigating officer, visited the spot on
04.08.2014 as the F.I.R was registered after 12:00 hours in the
night. The witnesses were examined who stated that the
investigating officer recorded their statements on 04.08.2014,
whereas, the record tells that their statements under section 161
Cr.P.C were recorded on 03.08.2014. This is for the prosecution

to explain that when the FIR was yet to be chalked out, then
“

-13-

how the investigating officer visited the spot and recorded
statements of the witnesses. The record was consulted where
initially, the date of preparation of site plan was mentioned as
03.08.2014, whereas, later on, the same was tampered and
rectified as 04.08.2014. The overall situation has created an
atmosphere of confusion which the prosecution failed to
resolve. Another important aspect of the case is that the dead
body was brought before the doctor for postmortem
examination at 11:00 PM, the time,. by then, no report was
made. The doctor was examined as PW-07, who stated that he
started postmortem examination of the dead body at 11:00 PM
and completed the same at 11:30 PM. When he appeared before
the trial Court, he stated that at 11:00 PM, the dead body was
brought before him alongwith injury sheet and inquest report.
The statement of the doctor does not find support from record
of the case, as, by then, the report was not made. We are
surprised that when the matter was reported at 11:15 PM, how
the doctor could lay hands on the injury sheet and inquest
report, as the same were admittedly prepared after the Murasila
was drafted. When all these anomalies are taken into
consideration, coupled with the column of identification, where
neither the complainant nor the eye witness stood identifiers,
then in such eventuality, an inference can be drawn that either

the dead body was shifted to the hospital by the co-villagers,
-14-

where the injury sheet and inquest report were prepared and by
then the report was not made, as the complainant was not
available or the complainant was searching for the real culprits,
who killed the deceased, and that it was after consultation and
deliberation that the appellants were charged for the death of
the deceased. The superior courts of the country interpreted the
importance of the identifiers of the dead body before the police
at the time of report and before the doctor, at the time of
postmortem examination keeping before them the particular
circumstances of a particular case. It is not the rule of thumb
that in all cases, the complainant and the witnesses must be the
identifiers of the dead body before the police at the time of
report or the doctor, at the time of postmortem examination.
Their importance is to be seen in light of the attending
circumstances of every individual case, we cannot make their
presence or absence in the columns of identification, both in the
inquest and postmortem report, as a touchstone. If the principle
is universally acknowledged then it will yield to drastic results
and that has never been the intent :and purpose behind the
pronouncements of the superior courts. In this particular case,
though the incident occurred in front of the house of the
complainant and that the complainant alongwith his relatives
shifted the dead body to the hospital, but the delay caused in

reporting the matter and thereafter, in chalking out the first
-15-

information report has increased the anxiety of this Court to a
greater extent and has compelled this Court to observe that

either the complainant was not present at the time of incident in
;

his village or that the real culprits were not known. When both
the probabilities are placed in juxtaposition, this Court is not
reluctant to go for the second choice, that is, the complainant
was not in the knowledge of the real culprits and that it was
after inquiry and consultation that the appellants were charged
and the benefit of doubt, in the circumstances, can only be

extended in favour of the appellants, as is held in case titled

“Muhammad Manshah Vs The State” (2018 SCMR 772):

“Needless to mention that while giving the
benefit of doubt to an accused, it is not
necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating doubt. If there is a
circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in
a prudent mind about the guilt of accused, then
the accused would be entitled to the benefit of
such doubt, not as a matter of grace and
concession, but as a matter of right. It is based
on the maxim: It is better that ten guilty persons
be acquitted, rather than one innocent person be
convicted”
13. The eye witness appeared before the Court as PW-09,
who stated that when the complainant was reporting the matter,
i

he was expelled from the room by the scribe and that he was

not asked to verify the report of the complainant. The overall
-16-

circumstances, as discussed above, tarnish the veracity of the
witnesses and also their credibility. The situation has been

beautifully answered by the Apex Court in case titled Khair

Muhammad and another Vs The State through P.G Punjab
and another (2021 SCMR 130):

“There is no denial to this fact that the
petitioners are nominated in the crime report.
According to the contents of the crime report, it
is mentioned that the occurrence has taken
place in the morning whereas the matter was
reported to police at 10:50 AM. Admittedly, the
inter se distance between the place of
occurrence and police station is 08 KM.
Inordinate delay qua time of occurrence and
registration clearly reveals that possibility of
deliberation and consultation cannot be ruled

out.”
14. The medical evidence does not support the case of the
prosecution, the doctor who was examined as PW-07, he
admitted that the deceased received injuries on the vital parts of
his body, his statement get support from the postmortem report.
The postmortem report tells that the most vital organs of the
body of deceased were damaged. When such was the precarious
condition of the deceased at the time of incident, we are not ina
happy mood to accept that the deceased could run from point
No.1 to point No.1A, if so then between the two places, the

investigating officer would have shown the trail of blood. The
-17-

conflict between the medical evidence and ocular account has
damaged the prosecution case beyond repair. True that the
medical evidence is confirmatory in nature and in case of
availability of strong eye witness account, it plays a little role,
but in case where the witnesses fail to establish their presence
on the spot then in that eventuality, it becomes obligatory that
the medical evidence must be respected and appreciated. In case
in hand, we lurk no doubt in mind that the witnesses failed to
establish their presence on the spot at the time of incident, so
the medical evidence is to play the decisive role and as such,
the conflict between the two has created dents in the
prosecution story.

15. It is evident from the record that the investigating officer
collected 21 empties of 7.62 bore from the place of incident, but
surprisingly, the same were not sent to the firearms expert soon
after its recovery, rather the same were received to the
laboratory on 08.09.2014, after a considerable delay of 34 days,
which the prosecution failed to explain. The investigating
officer did not record the statements of independent witnesses
regarding the safe custody of the collected empties and even no
record was collected from the concerned police station as to
where these empties were lying. Neither the Muhrrir of the
concerned police station was produced nor the police official

who took the same to the firearms expert. When the safe
-18-

custody of the collected empties could not be proved on record,
then in such eventuality, this piece of evidence cannot be taken
into consideration and as such, it has lost its evidentiary value.
16. True that the incident occurred on 03.08.2014, whereas,
one of the appellant was arrested on 07.08.2019, who could not
succeed in getting his bail before arrest confirmed and the other
on 12.06.2020, no plausible explanation was given regarding
their long abscondance. An attempt was made to convince this
Court that the long abscondance of the appellants is a sufficient
factor to help in their conviction, but we are not impressed, as
the law is settled that abscondance is a circumstance which can
be aided to the benefit of the prosecution, provided the
prosecution succeeds in establishing its case against the accused
charged, but when the prosecution is lacking evidence, then
abscondance has a little role to play. In case in hand, as the
witnesses could not succeed in establishing their presence on
the spot and the mode and manner is still shrouded in mystery,
so the abscondance cannot be taken into consideration, that too,
to convict the appellants.

17. The motive was alleged as oral altercation between the
appellants and the deceased a few days earlier to the incident,
but the complainant could not bring on record any substantial
evidence in that respect and even the‘ investigating officer did

not record the statements of independent witnesses in support of
-19-

the alleged motive. Except mere oral assertion by the
complainant, no positive evidence was produced in respect of
the motive, thus, this Court has no other option, but to hold that
the prosecution failed to establish the motive. True that absence
or weakness of motive, in itself, is not sufficient to dislodge the
prosecution story, but at the same time, we cannot ignore its
importance, more particularly in the given circumstances of the
present case. As the reason to kill was the altercation between
the deceased and accused, so the liability of the prosecution was
more than the ordinary cases. When the complainant failed to
convince this Court through reliable witnesses that a day earlier
to the incident, an altercation took place between the parties,
this Court is not hesitant to hold that the charge against the
appellants was the outcome of consultation and deliberation.

18. After evaluating the evidence from different angles, this
Court reaches nowhere, but to hold that the prosecution failed
to bring home guilt against the appellants. The learned trial
judge could not appreciate the available evidence on file and the
unique characteristics of the present case, so he fell in error
while passing the impugned judgment. We are firm in our belief
that miscarriage of justice has occasioned while passing the
impugned judgment. Not only the learned trial Court fell in
error on facts of the case, rather it misdirected itself in law and

in that eventuality, this Court reserves no option, but to
-20-

interfere and as such, the impugned judgment is set aside by
acquitting the appellants of the charges. They shall be released
forthwith, if not required to be detained in connection of any
other criminal case. The Cr.A#196-B/2021 stands dismissed.

19. As the prosecution failed in establishing its case, so the
criminal revision petition No.46-B/2021 filed for enhancement
of the sentence cannot proceed further and is dismissed 4S sch.
