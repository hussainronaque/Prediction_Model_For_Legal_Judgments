LAL JAN KHATTAK, J:- Petitioner Nasir
Abbas Noori has applied to this court for his
release on bail in case FIR No.1036 dated
26.10.2021 under sections 302/324/109/
420/468/471/34 PPC registered against him at
Police Station, City Hangu wherein he is
charged for committing the Qati-i-Amd of one
Syed Ali Murtaza Hussain.

2. Arguments heard and record gone
through.

3. No doubt, in the first information report a
specific role of firing at the deceased has been
attributed to the petitioner but important
aspect of the case is that the petitioner has
taken the plea of alibi according to which on
the date and time of the occurrence he was

performing his duties as ASI at police station
City Kohat. It is noteworthy that on 01.11.2011

ie. within a week of his nomination as
accused in the case petitioner moved an
application to S.P (Investigation), Hangu
pleading his innocence on which an inquiry
was conducted and according to the findings
of the inquiry officer petitioner is not involved
in the murder of Syed Ali Murtaza Hussain. It
is also worth to mention that as per record
annexed with the petition, petitioner had left
his police station i.e. the place of his posting
for gasht at 07:10 AM on the day of
occurrence vide daily diary No.54 and had
returned there at 03:00 PM vide daily diary
No.16. It is further worth to add that the Inquiry
Officer had recorded statements of the police
personnel who had been with the petitioner in
the gasht at the relevant time.

4. True that the plea of alibi is normally left
for the trial court to judge it but at the same
time if it is taken at the earliest and is verified
one then for the purpose of bail it can be
pressed into service and cannot out rightly be
rejected. (1997 SCMR 1829).

5. Tentative assessment of the available
record would show that the petitioner has

succeeded in making out a case arguable for
the purpose of his release on bail as his
involvement therein needs further probe in
terms of subsection (2) of section 497 Cr.P.C.
6. For what has been discussed above,
this petition is allowed and the petitioner is
directed to be released on bail provided he
furnishes bail bonds in the sum_ of
Rs.100,000/- (one lac) with two sureties each
in the like amount to the satisfaction of
Illaqa/Judicial Magistrate, who shall ensure
that the sureties are local, reliable and men of

means.
