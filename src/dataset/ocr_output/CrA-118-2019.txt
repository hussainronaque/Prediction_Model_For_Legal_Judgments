2. Brief facts of the case are that on 25.06.2015 at
about 1905 hours, complainant Ali Said (now dead) in injured

condition accompanied by the dead bodies of his father Khan

Said and brothers Siyar Khan and Anwar Said reported the
matter to Rameen Khan ASI at the DHQ Hospital Nowshera
Kalan, that on the eventful date at about 1600 hours, he along
with his deceased father and brothers and other inmates were
present in the house, when in the meanwhile, Noorul Amin,
Gul Amin, Amroz Khan, Suleman, Mudassir, Muhammad
Amin and Said Amin (appellant) duly armed arrived and

started firing at them and resultantly, his father and brothers
-3-

were hit and died on the spot while he and his sister-in-law
Mst. Nazeehat Bibi sustained firearms injuries. Motive for the
occurrence was stated to be dispute over the cattle. Hence, the
complainant / deceased then injured charged the appellant and
his co-accused for the commission of the offence and pursuant

thereto, the ibid FIR was registered against them.

3. Soon after the occurrence, all the “accused
decamped from the spot and went into hiding, hence, on
completion of investigation, the complete challan Exh.PW-5/1
was put in court on 5.10.2015 against them in their absence
and accordingly, they were proceeded under sections 204 and
87 CrPC. After having remained fugitive from law for about
two years, the convict-appellant Said Amin and his co-accused
Muhammad Amin were arrested on 21.03.2017 and
accordingly, supplementary challan Exh-PW-16/1 was put in

court against them on 28.04.2017.

Whereas, provision of section 265-C, CrPC was
complied with to the extent of the convict-appellant, the
proceedings against the co-accused Muhammad Amin stood
abated due to his natural death vide order sheet dated
30.05.2017 of the learned trial court. The charge was framed
against the convict-appellant on 06.06.2017, to which, he

pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

then injured Ali Said and sent his dead body
to KMC, Peshawar for postmortem.

The prosecution after abandoning the remaining PWs as

unnecessary closed the evidence on 26.11.2018.

5. On conclusion of prosecution evidence, the

convict-appellant was examined under Section 342, Cr.PC on
-11-

17.12.2018. He, in his statement, denied the charges, levelled
against him and pleaded innocence. He, however, did not opt
to lead any evidence in his defence or to appear as his own

witness in terms of Section 340(2), CrPC.

6. The learned Trial Court, after hearing the
arguments of both the parties and on appraisal of evidence,
convicted and sentenced the convict-appellant as stated above
through the impugned judgment. So far as the case of the
absconding co-accused is concerned, the learned trial court has
observed as under:-

“However, in the light of evidence produced by

the prosecution, a prima facie case exists

against absconding accused, namely (1) Noor-

ul-Amin s/o Kachkol, (2) Gul Amin son of Said

Amin (3) Suleman s/o Amroz Khan (4) Mudassir

s/o Amroz Khan & (3) Amroz Khan s/o Ashraf

all residents of Dargai Tehsil & District

Nowshera, therefore, they are declared as

proclaimed offenders and perpetual warrants of

arrest be issued against them. Their names be

entered in Registrar meant for proclaimed

officers by quarter concerned.”

Being aggrieved, the convict-appellant has filed the

instant appeal.

7. The learned counsel for the convict-appellant by
referring to the story narrated in the FIR and the statements of

the PWs recorded in the court, has tried to project the
-12-

inference that the occurrence has not taken place in the mode
and manner as described by the prosecution. He next
contended that in the absence of any opinion of the doctor qua
the consciousness or otherwise, the statement of complainant
Ali Shah, deceased then injured, in the shape of the murasila /
FIR cannot be termed as a dying declaration. He further
argued that the alleged occurrence had taken place at about
1600 hours but as against that,the report was lodged after three
hours at about 1905 hours and that too, as per injury sheet of
the deceased then injured, he was examined by the doctor at
about 6.55 p.m. prior to lodging the alleged report. He also
contended that the involvement of seven persons for the
alleged indiscriminate firing at the complainant party is not
appealable to a prudent mind so far as recovery of mere three
empties of 7.62 bore from the spot is concerned. He also
contended that a general role of firing has been attributed to all
the accused, which clearly suggests that the prosecution story
has been exaggerated and if all the alleged crime is committed,
then, at the most, it could be the job on one person. His next
contended that where more than one accused were charged,
then corroboration of each accused is required, which fact is
lacking in this case. He also contended that the prosecution
has failed to establish the presence of the convict-appellant
being of advanced age at the spot at the relevant time and that

too, when no empty was recovered from the place where he
-13-

was allegedly shown to be present. The learned counsel, by
concluding his arguments, contended that awarding
punishment of ‘life imprisonment’ on four counts with huge
fine to the convict-appellant, in view of the afore-noted
infirmities and loopholes in the prosecution case, is too harsh
and not justified, therefore, he be acquitted from the charges

levelled against him.

8. As against that the learned Additional Advocate
General appearing on behalf of the State duly assisted by the
learned counsel for the complainant party vehemently argued
that the ocular account being consistent and confidence
inspiring, has rightly been relied upon by the learned trial
court. They further argued that the convict-appellant along
with the absconding accused as well as the dead co-accused
Muhammad Amin were directly charged by the complainant /
deceased then injured Ali Said for the commission of the
offence in his confidence inspiring dying declaration and
despite the best efforts of the defence, such dying declaration
rings true when judged and adjudged from all the angles and
legal parameters. Non-recovery of sufficient number of crime
empties, they added, would not pre se demolish the otherwise
proved prosecution case against the convict-appellant and his
absconding co-accused and that too, when the convict-
appellant has also to his credit two years unexplained

abscondence. They by concluding their arguments submitted
-14-

that the learned trial court has already taken a very lenient
view while awarding sentence to the convict-appellant when
otherwise he deserves capital punishment for the gruesome

and brutal murder of four innocent male members of the same

family.
9. Arguments heard and the available record
perused.
10. The prosecution case is that the occurrence had

taken place on 25.06.2015 at 1600 hours and the report thereof
was made at 1905 hours in the hospital by the deceased then
injured namely, Ali Said. He narrated his story as to how on
the eventful day, he along with his deceased father and
brothers along with other inmates were present in the house,
when in the meanwhile, Noorul Amin, Gul Amin, Amroz
Khan, Suleman, Mudassir, Muhammad Amin and Said Amin
(appellant) duly armed arrived there and started firing at them
resulting in the death of his father Khan Said and brothers
Siyar Khan and Anwar Said on the spot and in the process, he
and his sister-in-law Mst. Nazeehat Bibi sustained firearms
injuries. He charged the accused party for the commission of
the offence. Motive for the occurrence was stated to be dispute
over the cattle. The said report was recorded by Rameen
Khan, ASI (PW-8) in the shape of murasila Exh.PW-8/9,

which was read over to the injured Ali Said and after
-15-
admitting it to be correct, he thumb impressed the same in the
presence of his brother Shah Said (PW-12), who also signed
the same as a verifier. For ready reference, the image of the

murasila is depicted as under:-

On receipt of murasila, Shahid Iqbal MHC (PW-15)
incorporated its contents into FIR vide Exh.PA. On the
following day i.e. 26.06.2015, the complainant succumbed to

the injuries, whose autopsy was conducted by Dr. Muhammad

-16-

Aslam, Ex-Demonstrator, KMC (PW-11) vide postmortem
report Exh.PM.
ll Since the prosecution case primarily revolves

around the dying declaration of the complainant Ali Said,
therefore, it would be more apt to reproduce the relevant
provision of Article 46(1) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984 as under:-

46(1) When it relates to cause of death: When
the statement is made by a person as to the cause
of his death, or as to any of the circumstances of
the transaction which resulted in his death, in
cases in which the cause of that person’s death
comes into question such statements are relevant
whether the person who made them was or was
not, at the time when they were made, under
expectation of death, and whatever may be the
nature of the proceeding in which cause of his

death comes into question.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court has laid down the

following principles for recording dying declaration in the

case of Farmanullah vs. Qadeem Khan & another (2001
SCMR 1474):-

“No specified forum is available before whom
dying declaration is required to be made; there
is no bar that it cannot be made before a
private person; there is no legal requirement
that the declaration must be read over or it
must be signed by its maker; it should be

influence free; in order to prove such

-17-

y “ declaration the person by whom it was recorded
should be examined; such declaration becomes
substantive evidence when it is proved that it
was made by the deceased; corroboration of
dying declaration is not a rule of law, but
requirement of prudence and such declaration
when proved by cogent evidence can be made a

base for conviction.”
Likewise, in the case of Mst. Shamim Akhtar vs. Fiaz

Akhtar & two others (PLD 1992 SC 211), the august apex

court has held as under:-

“The law does not prescribe any special mode
of recording the dying declaration. The
statement of an injured recorded by the police
under S.161, Cr.P.C. during the course of
investigation is not hit by S.162, Cr.P.C. As
such the dying declaration is a good piece of
evidence and it can be relied upon by the
prosecution. It is not necessary for the
admissibility of dying declaration that the
deceased at the time of making it should have
been under expectancy of death. A statement
; under S. 161, Cr.P.C. of an injured is an
admissible evidence even though the injured

had died much later.”

In Wazir Gul v. The State (1976 SCMR 471), it
has been observed that "the dying declaration
need not be made under immediate
apprehension' of death". Law does not insist
that for the purpose of being treated as a dying
declaration the statement should have been
made under immediate apprehension of death.

We cannot import into statutory provision any

-18-

such extraneous limitation. In the absence of
Statutory requirement in this regard, the last
incriminating statement made by the deceased
could be legitimately treated as dying
declaration. Similar view was taken in
Muhammad Aslam v. The State (PLD 1978 SC
298), Niamat Ali v. The State (1981 SCMR 61);
and Noor Muhammad v. The State (1988 SCMR
1640).”

Similarly, the Hon’ble Federal Shariat Court in the

case of Muhammad Fazil vs. State (2022 YLR 754) has

held as under:-

“In order to treat any statement as "Dying
Declaration", it must be proved that
declaration was made in extremity, at the
point of death, having no hope of this world,
compelling the maker to speak truth and
nothing but the truth "Niaz-ud-Din and
another v. The State and another" (2011
SCMR 725) and "Mushtaq Ahmad and
another v. The State" (1973 PCr.LJ 1075). In
"Sirajuddin v. The State" (1990 SCMR 588),
the deceased himself lodged FIR, which was
treated as dying declaration after his death.
Similar is the situation in the case of "Niaz
Ahmad v. The State" (PLD 2003 SC 635). In
addition to these citations, there are certain
judgments of the Apex Court in which it is
held that dying declaration is a substantive
piece of evidence, if court is satisfied about its
genuineness, it can be acted upon without any
corroboration, however, some of the tests for
determining its veracity are that whether it

intrinsically rings true; whether there is no
-19-

chance of mistake on the part of dying man in
identifying or naming his assailant; whether it
is free from prompting any outside quarter
and whether it is consistent with other
evidence and circumstances of the case;
Reference: "Mst. Amina and another v. The
State" (2013 PCr.LJ 962). This aspect of
evaluating dying declaration is also discussed
in "Hazoor Bux and 5 others v. S.I.O. Police
Station Khanpur Mahar and 3 others" (2011
PCr: LJ. 1454) [Karachi] and "Shahban Bheri
v. The State" (2014 MLD 663) [Sindh]”.

On this issue, reliance can also be placed on the
Judgments of the superior courts of the country in the cases
of Majeed vs. State (2010 SCMR 55); Niaz-ud-Din &
another vs. State & another (2011 SCMR 725): Ali
Gohar vs. State & another (2013 PCrLJ Peshawar 578)
& Haq Nawaz vs. State (2018 PCrLJ Peshawar 69).

12. In the light of the above guidelines, first of all
we would tackle the contention of the learned counsel for
the convict-appellant regarding the genuineness and
truthfulness of the dying declaration of the complainant Ali
Said, the deceased then injured, in the absence of any
certificate from the medical officer in whose presence, it
was recorded. As the age old saying goes that a dying
person is not expected to tell a lie, therefore, presumption of
truth is attached to the statement, which is being recorded by

a dying person. A perusal of the F.I.R. Exh.PA, which was
-20-

subsequently treated as a dying declaration, depicts that the
deceased then injured has given a simple and straightforward
account of the occurrence by directly charging the convict-
appellant along with his absconding and dead co-accused
Muhammad Amin for the commission of the offence with
specific motive for the occurrence. The dying declaration
bears the thumb impression of the deceased then injured as
well as signatures of its author Rameen Khan, ASI (PW-8)
and verifier Shah Said (PW-12) as is evident from the ibid

sketch / image of the murasila.

So far as the question regarding orientation and
consciousness of the deceased then injured at the time of
making report is concerned, the same is answered by Dr.
Phag Chand, MO (Retd) (PW-1) in his statement, who, on
25.06.2015, medically examined the deceased then injured
and found the following injuries on his body:-

A firearm entry wound 1 cm x 1 cm on left

lumber region.

A Firearm exit would size 3 cm x 4 cm on the

right lumber region.

Patient was referred to LRH, Peshawar after

doing first aid treatment.

He, in his cross-examination, has given the following
reply to the suggestion regarding consciousness of the

deceased then injured:-
-21-

“It is incorrect to suggest that due to the huge
amount of loss of blood the victim / patient
becomes unconscious. It is correct that I have
not given in (Ex.PWI/I) the condition of
patient / victim conscious or unconscious.
Witness volunteered that due to nature of
injuries on Lumber regions the patient may be
conscious. PW volunteered that my non-
mentioning of the word unconscious depicts

that the patient was conscious.”

13. ‘The above statement clearly suggests that at the
relevant time, the deceased then injured was fully conscious
and thus capable to record his dying declaration. His dying
declaration was recorded on 25.06.2015 at the DHQ
Hospital, Nowshera Kalan whereafter he was referred to
LRH Peshawar where he remained alive till next day i.e.
26.06.2015. Dr. Muhammad Aslam, Ex. Demonstrator,
KMC (PW-11), who conducted autopsy of the dead body
has opined that, “the deceased died due to injuries to the
small intestine, large intestine and abdominal blood vessels

(mesenteric) due to firearm”.

14, Being so, it can safely be said that deceased

then injured was fully conscious, well oriented in time and

' space and capable to record his statement / report. Such

report-cum-dying declaration of the deceased rings true on all
counts and is free from any doubt regarding the identification

of the accused party by him. It is consistent with the available
-22-

evidence on the record and could safely be relied upon while

determining the guilt of the convict-appellant.

15. The dying declaration of the deceased then
injured has in turn been corroborated / confirmed by the two
star eyewitnesses of the prosecution i.e. Mst. Bilqees (PW-
13) and Mst. Nazeehat Bibi / victim (PW-14), who have also
given simple and straightforward narrations of the occurrence
which inspire confidence and appear to be based on true facts.
At this stage, the statements of both these eyewitness require

verbatim reproduction, which read as under:-

Mst. Balqees (PW-13)

“Stated that deceased Khan Said was my
husband, deceased Ali Said, Anwar Said and
Siyar were my sons while injured Mst. Nazehat
is my daughter in law. The accused Imroz is my
brother while accused Suleman and Mudasir
are my nephews whereas accused Noorul Amin,
Muhammad Amin, Said Amin are my cousins.
Accused Gul Amin is the son of my sister. On
the day of occurrence I alongwith my deceased
husband Khan Said, deceased sons Siyar,
Anwar Said, Ali Said and my daughter in law
Mst. Nazeehat were present in our house. In the
meanwhile accused Noorul Amin s/o Kachkol,
Gul Amin s/o Said Amin, Imroz s/o Ashraf,
Suleman and Mudasir sons of Imraoz,
Muhammad Amin s/o Amin Khan, Said Amin
s/o Amin Khan entered duly armed with
firearms and started firing at us with the

intention to commit our Qatal-e-Amd as result
-23-

of which my husband Khan Said, sons Siyar and

Anwar Said got hit and died on the spot
whereas my daughter in law Nazeehat and Ali
Said complainant also sustained injuries,
however, on the following day Ali Said
succumbed to his injuries; luckily I escaped
unhurt. The motive for the occurrence was
dispute over grazing the cattle. On my
pointation IO prepared the site plan. I charge

the accused for the offence.”

Mst. Nazeehat Bibi (PW-14)

“Stated that on the day of occurrence I
alongwith my mother in law Mst. Balgees,
father in law Khan Said, my husband Siyar
Khan, Anwar Said and Ali Said brother in law
were present in our house. In the mean while
-accused Said Amin, Gul Amin, Amroz Khan,
Mudasir, Suleman, Muhammad Amin and
Noorul Amin came to our house duly armed
with firearms and started firing at us with the
intention to commit our qatal-e-amd as a result
my father in law Khan Said, my brother in law
Anwar Said and my husband Siyar Khan got hit
and died on the spot. The complainant Ali Said
my brother in law and me sustained injuries.
Mst. Balqees escaped unhurt and complainant
Ali Said succumbed to injuries on the following
day. The motive for the occurrence was dispute
over grazing the cattle in their field. I charge

the accused.”
The ocular account as spelt out in such dying

declaration and in the statements of PWs-13 & 14 is perfectly

in accordance with the medical evidence, site plan and
-24-

recoveries from the spot coupled with the two years

abscondence of the convict-appellant.

The statement of Mst. Nazeehat (PW-14) being an
injured eyewitness deserves to be given much weightage as
her presence on the spot at the relevant time is quite natural,
unimpeachable and cannot be doubted. She was subjected to a
lengthy cross-examination of the choice of the convict-
appellant but she held her ground so far as all the material
particulars are concerned including her presence at the spot,
arrival of the accused party with firearms, firing at the
complainant party resulting in the death of the four persons
and the injuries sustained by her. Regarding the injured
eyewitnesses, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has laid down the

following dictum in the case of Muhammad Shabbir &

» others vs. State (2020 SCMR 1206):-

“the presence of Mazhar Anwaar (PW-20) and
Said Rasool injured (PW-21) at the scene of
oceurrence was quite natural and beyond any
doubt and the statements of the prosecution
witnesses are consistent, confidence inspiring
and in consonance with the probability and
circumstances of the case and being worthy of
credence, which could not be brushed aside.
Injured Said Rasool (PW-21) received
firearms injures in the occurrence while
sitting in the jeep and saw the occurrence,
hence, his presence at the relevant time

cannot be considered as unnatural and
-25-

improbable and he has no enmity or malice
against the appellants and his testimony is
duly supported by medical evidence having

been found confidence inspiring, truthful and

unimpeachable.”
Likewise, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of

Saleem Zada & others vs. State & others (2019 SCMR
1309) has held:-

“We have gone through the statement of Bahri
Zaman, the sole eye-witness and found him
most confidence inspiring; he alone can
sustain the charge; being injured, his
presence cannot be doubted. Driver of the
vehicle, though reticent in his deposition,
nonetheless, has unambiguously confirmed
circumstances whereunder the occurrence
took place. Cross-examination on both the
witnesses remained inconsequential and as
such convictions and sentences consequent

thereupon do not call for interference.”

On this particular issue, reliance can also be placed on

the judgment of the apex court reported in the case of Rooh

Ullah & others vs. State & others (2022 SCMR 888).

16. So far as the delay in lodging the report is
concerned, suffice it to say that, in the presence of three
dead bodies and two injured persons, the first priority of
their family members must have been shift them to the

hospital and for making such arrangements, sufficient time
-26-

must have been consumed. Thus, the delay in lodging the
FIR appears to be natural. Wisdom is derived from the
judgments of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the following

cases:-

Sikandar vs. State (2006 SCMR 1786)

“The deceased was fired at while he was going
on a Kacha path leading to village Pattan at a
distance of about two kilometers from his house
and it being hilly area, the dead body was
brought on foot to the house of deceased
consuming about three hours and before the
matter could be reported to the police, the
S.H.O. of the concerned police station, on
coming to know about the occurrence, of his
own, reached at the house of deceased and
recorded the statement of Gul Khan
(complainant), real brother of deceased on the
basis of which case was registered, therefore, in
these circumstances, delay in the registration of

case, would be of no significance.”

Sarwar & another vs. State & another

(2020 SCMR 1250)

“The occurrence in this case took place at
0.800 a.m. on 03.09.2001 and it was reported
to the Police on the same day at 10.15 p.m.
The delay is two hours and fifteen minutes in
reporting the crime to the Police is not
material keeping in view the peculiar
circumstances of the case such as the gender
of the complainant and 11 miles distance  j
between the place of occurrence and the
Police Station. Therefore, we hold that there

was no deliberate or conscious delay in
-27-
reporting the matter to the Police.”

A similar view was also taken by the Hon’ble

Supreme Court (AJ&K) in the case of Iftikhar Khan alias

Khari & others vs. State & others [2021 PCrLJ Note 45
(Supreme Court AJ&K)] by holding that:-

“The learned counsel for the convict
submitted that there is an unexplained delay
of 1-1/2 hours towards lodging the FIR. We
do not agree with this version as in the case in
hand, the deceased did not die at the spot
rather he died later on in the hospital and in
such a situation when he was seriously
injured the first priority for the family
members of the deceased was to secure his
life. It is clear from the record that at first
they shifted him to the hospital and thereafter
they approached the police for registration of
the case; thus, in such state of affairs, the
consumption of such time in lodging the FIR

appears to be natural.”

Thus, it can be safely inferred that the delay in
lodging the report as occasioned was quite natural and in the

fitness of circumstances.

17. Another striking feature of the case is that at the
time of occurrence, injured Mst. Nazeehat Bibi (PW-14),
was pregnant having conceived a fetus in her womb, who
gave birth to a baby during her stay in the Lady Reading

Hospital, Peshawar on the same very day i.e. 25.06.2015 as
-28-
is evident from the discharge slip dated’29.06.2015, which
reflects as under:-

Disease: Fire Arm Injury (Entry wound Right
Hypochondrium. No Exit wound)

Incision: Middle

Operative

Findings: Peritoneal breach

Procedure/

Operation: Emergency Laparotomy + C-section
done. Above incision given, above
findings noted, there is gravid uterus,
gynae unit was informed where C-
Section done, baby delivered,
homeostasis secured, wash with N/S

Drain placed.

18. The presence of the convict-appellant at the
spot at the relevant time has been established from the site
plan, Exh.PW-17/1, which was prepared by the Investigation
Officer Dilaram Khan, SI (PW-17) at the instant of eyewitness
Mst. Bilgees (PW-13), which reflects that the convict-
appellant has been shown present at point No.7 and there is
no question of misidentification as the said witness in her
statement has disclosed the relationship of the accused party

with the complainant party as under:-

“States that deceased Khan Said was my
husband, deceased Ali Said, Anwar Said and
Siyar were my sons while injured Mst.
Nazehat is my daughter in law. The accused

Imroz is my brother while accused Suleman
"29.

and Mudasir are my nephews whereas
accused Noorul Amin, Muhammad Amin, Said
Amin are my cousins. Accused Gul Amin is the

son of my sister.”

This witness in her cross-examination has also given
the presence and location of the accused party and the

complainant party in the following manner:-

“The deceased Ali Said was towards east from
me, Deceased Anwar Said was towards
eastern side. Again stated that deceased
Anwar Said was present towards eastern side
Jrom me. My deceased husband was present
towards eastern side from me. The distance
between me and my deceased husband was
about 17 paces. The injured Mst. Nazeehat
was also standing from eastern side from me.
The distance between me and Mst. Nazeehat
would be 7/8 paces. The distance between me
and deceased Anwar Said was about 7/8
paces. The accused Amrooz was at distance of
13/14 paces from me. Accused Gul Amin was
present towards eastern side from me. The
distance between me and accused Gul Amin
was 13/14 paces. All the accused were almost

at the same distance from me.”

19. The other argument vehemently pressed by the
learned counsel for the convict-appellant that the number of
three crime empties of 7.62 bore recovered from the spot do
not correspond with the number of the assailants, who had
made indiscriminate firing at the complainant party and that

too, in view of the injuries stained by the deceased and the
-30-

6

injured eyewitness. The august apex court while dealing

with a similar controversy has held in the case of Qaiser

Khan & others vs. State & others (2009 SCMR 471):-

“Much emphasis has been laid on the fact that
despite indiscriminate firing alleged to have
been made by the petitioners and absconding
co-accused, at the complainant party, no crime-
empty has been recovered from the site of
occurrence indicative of the fact that the place
of incident has not been established. The
submission is misconceived. The spot is near
the village Abadi and the Investigating Officer
reached there after some time of the
occurrence. The possibility of the crime-
empties, having been taken away by the
passerby, cannot be excluded. The non-recovery
of crime-empties; in the circumstances of the
case, is not fatal to the prosecution case and

nothing turns on it. Similar objection has been

taken, regarding non-recovery of blood from
the spot. This objection is also without force.
Blood has been recovered from inside the

motorcar in question.”
Likewise, the Hon’ble Shariat Appellate Bench

(AJ&K) in the case of Muhammad Jahanzaib & others

vs. State & others (2019 YLR Note 32 [Shariat Appellate
Bench (AJ&K)] also held:-

“On the point of recoveries, it was contended
that recoveries of crime empties were not
made and only few were made from the place
of occurrence which do not match with the

crime weapon used by the convict, Jahanzaib.
-31-

A careful perusal of the evidence reveals that
it is to be determined as to whether on
account of no recoveries or there being
defective recoveries, the whole prosecution
case is to be disbelieved and discarded. The
correct legal position with regard to the
recoveries even if found defective would be
that the main case if otherwise being not
based on convincing quality evidence would
of course, be a circumstance having important
bearing on the ultimate fate of the case.
However, if the case otherwise is proved on
the basis of convincing evidence mere
defective recoveries or no recoveries would
not be sufficient to destroy the prosecution
case. The conviction could still be recorded if
other evidence is found to be of convincing
quality and of a nature on which reliance
could safely be placed. This view find support
from the case reported as 1983 PCr.LJ 898,

wherein it was held as under:-

“After careful perusal of the evidence
we find ourselves in agreement with the
learned counsel for the appellant. These
recoveries under law cannot be used in
evidence against the appellant. But it is
to be determined as to whether on
account of no recoveries or there being
defective recoveries the — whole
prosecution case is to be disbelieved
and discarded. The correct position
with regard to the recoveries found
defective would be that the main case if
otherwise being not of convincing
quality would of course be a
circumstance having important bearing

on the ‘ultimate fate of the case. If,
-32-

however, the case otherwise is proved
on the basis of convincing evidence
mere defective recoveries would still be
recorded if other evidence is found to be
convincing quality and of a nature on

which reliance could safely be placed."

In the case in hand too, seven persons have been
charged for the indiscriminate firing at the complainant
party, resulting in the death of three persons on the spot and
firearm injuries sustained by the two others, out of whom,
one succumbed to the injuries on the following day.
Though, only three empties of 7.62 bore were retrieved
from the spot but non-recovery of other crime empties is not
per se fatal to the prosecution case in view of the number of
injuries sustained by the four deceased and one injured and
that too, in the light of the ocular evidence, which has been
found to be overwhelming and confidence inspiring duly
corroborated by the medical evidence. Reliance can also be
safely placed on the judgments of the superior courts
reported in the cases of Magsood Ahmad vs. State (2006
SCMR_ 672) and Muhammad Sarwar & 2 others vs.
State (2008 MLD 592 (Lahore).

Even otherwise, as per the site plan Exh.PW-17/1, the
place of occurrence is a hilly area, which fact has also been
established from the statement of Dilaram Khan SI / IO

(PW-17/1), who in his cross-examination has stated that:-
-33-

“The place of occurrence is top of hill. It is
correct that I have not mentioned the above
facts in the site plan. Witness volunteered that
I have clearly mentioned that the place of

occurrence is hilly area.”

Being so, where the place of occurrence is admittedly
a hilly terrain, then, the chance of some of the crime
empties to have been misplaced cannot be ruled out. In such
circumstances, retrieving of all the empties could not be

possible.

20. So far as the advanced age of the convict-
appellant is concerned, as per the CNIC, available on file,
his date / year of birth is 1952. By that count, his age at the
time of the commission of the offence in the year, 2015 was
sixty-three years. In the absence of any medical record
showing the convict-appellant to be suffering from any
physical infirmity, which may have caused any handicap to
him at the time of the commission of the offence, the sixty-
three years age cannot be termed to be an advanced age in
this particular case. Wisdom is derived from the landmark
Judgment of the Lahore High Court reported in the case of
Khairdi_Khan & others vs. Crown (PLD 1951 Lahore
322), wherein the issue of advanced age has been exhaustively
discussed while enhancing the sentence of the convicts therein
from life imprisonment to capital punishment of death in the

following manner:-
-34-

The reasons given by the learned Sessions judge
Jor not awarding the usual sentence of death
are that Jahandad is an old man of 60, that
Sher Muhammad is a young man of 20 who
might have acted under the influence of his
elders and that it is not clear which

of the appellants inflicted the fatal injuries

The mere fact that a man who has taken part in
a premeditated murder is an old man of 60 is no
ground for taking a lenient view and we have
been repeatedly telling the Courts of Sessions
for many years past that where the murder is
premeditated and was committed with
the intention to kill, all acting with that
intention must be sentenced to death unless

there be some other extenuating circumstances.

The question whether a man who is not
expected to live many years should or should
not hang, or whether the sentence of death on
several men should or should not be executed is
a matter for the Government to consider. As a
Judge I am quite clear in my mind that no
ground for a lenient view exists in this case
except in regard to Sher Muhammad. I would,
therefore, accept the petition for revision and
order Khairdi Khan, Dilawar Khan and
Jahandad Khan to be hanged by the neck until
each of them be ‘dead.”
-35-

Wisdom is also derived from the judgments of the

Hon’ble Supreme Court in the following cases:-

Amir Gul vs. State (1981 SCMR 182)

“The appreciation of the prosecution case by
the Courts below is in full accord with the well-
settled principles of law and this being a case of
cruel double murder over trivial dispute calls
for no mercy under the law even though the
convict was aged 70 years at the time of

commission of the crime.”

Muhammad Sher alias Malang vs. State

(PLD 2001 SC 90)
“As regards the age factor, old-age by itself is

not a mitigating circumstance for withholding
the normal penalty for murder and imposing
lesser sentence. The view gets support from
Amir Gul v. The State 1981 SCMR 182 wherein
the contention that the accused being an old
person of 70 years at the time of occurrence
was entitled to benefit of lesser penalty of
imprisonment for life had not prevailed. In the
present case also the plea of lesser sentence
having been based on old-age alone cannot
prevail particularly when the murder committed
by the appellant is gruesome and his diabolic
conduct indicates that old-age has done no

harm to him.”

Reliance can also be placed on the judgments of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court reported in the cases of Aleeq Shah

ys. State (2010 SCMR 1590) and Muhammad Sadig vs.
State (2011 SCMR 888).
¥

-36-

Being so, the argument of the learned counsel for the
convict-appellant appears to be misconceived, hence, ruled

out.

21. Moreover, the prolonged noticeable and
unexplained abscondence of the convict-appellant for about
two years would go a long way to corroborate and strengthen
the truth of the prosecution version. Above apait, all the
prosecution witnesses were, no doubt, subjected to lengthy
cross-examination but nothing was extracted from any of
them, which could dilute the evidentiary worth of their
testimony. Minor discrepancies, no doubt, are there in the
statements of the PWs but certainly not fatal to the prosecution
case. We, therefore, have no hesitation to hold that the charge
against the convict-appellant has been proved beyond any
shadow of reasonable doubt and he has been rightly convicted

by the learned trial Court through a well reasoned judgment.

22. Accordingly, the impugned judgment is upheld,
the convictions and sentences of the convict-appellant are

maintained and in tum the appeal having no merit is

dismissed.
