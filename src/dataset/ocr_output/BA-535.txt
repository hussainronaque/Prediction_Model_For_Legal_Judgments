MOHAMMAD IBRAHIM KHAN, J... On many

folded reasons, the learned Additional Sessions
Judge/Izafi Zila Qazi Chitral while disposing of
B.A. No. 190/4 of the year 2017 titled as
"Azmat Khan vs The State " observed that the
case of Petitioner is distinguishable from the
accused who have been enlarged on bail. He has
been directly charged in the First Information
Report by assigning him effective role of
causing fire arm injury upon the person of

is duly supported by the medical evidence,
statements of the eyewitnesses recorded under

section 161 Cr.P.C, recovery of fire arm and

motive. Thus, in view of such glaring evidence
on the basis of tentative assessment bail petition

of the Petitioner stood dismissed on 10.11.2017.

2. Here the Petitioner seeks post arrest
bail in case FIR No. 281 dated 27.09.2017 being
charged under sections 324,452,147,149,427,336,
337-F (i) PPC & 15 A.A registered at Police

Station Chitral.

3. The ‘Murasila’ followed by lodging
of the First Information Report would reveal
that an ASI of PS Chitral on 27.09.2017 at
20.45 hours when was busy during routine
Ghast of the Illaqa received information that at
the vicinity of village Sherai a quarrel has taken
place and the injured were shifted to DHQ
Hospital Chitral. For confirmation and
fulfillment legal proceedings when he reached
to the hospital, where in the company of injured
Abdul Bari and Abdul Khaliq, the complainant
reported him the matter in the manner, that after
offering sha prayer he was present in his house
when accused/Petitioner Azmat Khan alias Jalil

seeing his brothers Abdul Waseh and Abdul
Bari started firing at them. The fire shot hit his
brother Abdul Bari on his right arm. The
accused was overpowered; the pistol was taken
from his possession and locked in the room. In
the meanwhile, his relatives Sharafat, Khosh
Ahmad, Shafiq, Faiz-ur-Rehman and Tayyab
rioted from outside the house of complainant
and attacked at his house through pelting stones,
as a result of which his uncle Abdul Khaliq was
injured besides damage being caused to his
house. The accused/Petitioner alongwith other
accused decamped from the spot. The
occurrence in addition to the complainant was
witnessed by Rahmat Ismail Shah and Ali

Haider.

4. Having heard arguments of learned
counsel for the Petitioner and learned Astt:
Advocate General for the State, record with
their assistance gone through. While the
complainant on 27.11.2017 appeared before the
learned Additional Registrar (Judicial) of this

Court and stated therein that he did not want to

po?

engage counsel of his choice and would rely on

the arguments of learned A.A.G.

5. Learned counsel for the Petitioner

referred to 2004 YER 431 (Peshawar) “

Dilawar _Khan_v/s The State and another”

—_————

2000 P Cr. LJ 642 (Karachi) “ Waris and 2

others v/s The State”, 2004 P Cr. LJ 1862

(Lahore) “ Muhammad _Yousaf alias Kalay
Khan _ v/s The State” and 2005 YLR 2508

(Lahore) “ Muhammad Sohail alias Jugi v/s

The State”, thereby prayed for the grant of bail.

6. It appears from the record that
though accused/Petitioner has been directly
charged in the First Information Report by the
complainant assigning him effective role of
firing upon the person of injured Abdul Bari.
Medico-legal report in respect of the injured
Abdul Bari is available on record and perusal of
the same would reveal that the injury on his
person is on non-vital part i.e. right upper arm
with no exposure of bone. It is also yet to

establish if the accused/Petitioner had intention

Nawab (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ibrahim Khan
to kill the injured he would have definitely
repeated the fire shots, which element is missing
in the present case. Hence in the given
circumstances, on this score alone the Petitioner
is entitled to the concession of bail. Moreover
applicability of section 324 PPC in respect of
the accused/Petitioner would come into play
after recording of evidence and at the moment

he is entitled to be enlarged on bail.

7. In view of the dictum of the Hon'ble

superior Courts reported in 2008 SCMR 1621

tilted _as_ "Umar Hayat vs _ the State_and

others", where the relevant citation speaks of:-

"Accused had allegedly fired 4/5 shots
from his pistol on complainant, out of
them one fire hit on his left knee. Said
injury fell within the ambit of S. 337 F (v)
PPC. Accused had rightly been granted

bail Trial Court and High Court while
jo

cancelling the same had failed to observe
whether bail granting order was
arbitrary, capricious or fanciful. Petition
for leave to appeal was converted into
appeal and allowed and accused was

granted bail in circumstances."

Nawab (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Ibrahim Khan
In further support in similar
circumstances of this case where the injury
attributed to the accused was on non-vital part

of the body, reference can be given of 2005

YER 2508 (Lahore) “ Muhammad Shoail alias
Jugi v/s The State”. The relevant citation of the

said ibid judgment is reproduced as under:-

“Injury attributed to
accused was not on the vital part of
injured. Injuries sustained by
injured at the most fell under
provision of S. 337 F (2) PPC and
did not fall within prohibitory
clause of S. 497, Cr.P.C. Accused
was behind the bars for the last 9
months and he could not be
retained in custody indefinitely as
the trial had not commenced.
Accused was admitted to bail, in

circumstances.”
In the Supra judgment of reliance
has been placed on the judgment of Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan 1994 SCMR 2051 *

Muhammad_Afgar_v/s_The_State_and_2005

MLD 425 Amanullah v/s State.

8. In view of the above, the Petitioner

is enlarged on bail subject to his furnishing bail

is pertinent to mention here that the
observations rendered above are limited only for

the disposal of this petition which shall have no
