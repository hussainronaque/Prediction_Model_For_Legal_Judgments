KRRERKK

YAHYA AFRIDI, CJ.- Muhammad Ayaz,
petitioner, seeks the Constitutional jurisdiction of
this Court in challenging the conviction awarded to
convict Muhammad Imran, by the Court Martial,
whereby, he was sentenced to death vide order
dated 28.6.2015.

2. The brief and essential facts leading
to the present petition are that convict Muhammad
Imran, being involved in terrorist activities, was
charged and tried by a Court Martial (“Military
Court”) under The Pakistan Army Act, 1952 as

amended vide Pakistan Army (Amendment) Act,
2
2015 (“The Army Act”), for the following
charges;

“First Charge.

PAA Section 59

Committing a civil offence, that is to say,
designing vehicle for terrorists act, in that
he, at Nahaqi (Mohmand Agency) during
2008, alongwith Civilians Musafir and

thereby committed an offence punishable
under Pakistan Army (Amendment)Act,
2015.

3

3. To the above charges, the accused
pleaded guilty. However, Military Court did not
convict the accused on his said plea of guilt, and
directed the prosecution to lead its evidence, as
provided under Sub-Rule (4) of Rule 42 of The
Pakistan Army Act Rules, 1954 (“The Rules”),
which reads;-

“A plea of “Guilty” shall not be
accepted in cases where the accused
is liable, if convicted, to be sentenced
to death, and where such plea is
made, the trial shall proceed and the
charge shall be dealt with as if the
plea made was “Not guilty”.

4. Accordingly, the prosecution in
support of its case produced as many as seven
witnesses, which included Interrogation Officer
(PW-1); Internment Officer (PW-2) who
produced internment report; Judicial Magistrate
(PW-5) who recorded the confessional statement
of the convict; an officer (PW-7) before whom the
accused recorded his inculpatory voluntary
statement at the time of recording summary of
evidence; and (PW-3, 4 & 6) supported the
prosecution’s case in their testimony before the

Military Court.
4

5. The Military Court also examined the
convict, Muhammad Imran, who once again
confessed his guilt, by narrating the entire events
and his involvement in the terrorist activities, in
terms that:

“1 Mohammad Imran son of Abdul Manan
joined Harkat-ul-Mujahideen in year 2004.
I went to Karachi in year 2005 where I got
affiliated with Haqqani Network and got
training from its commander Khalifa at
Miran Shah in year 2006. In year 2007, I
moved to Kurram agency and established a
camp at Ghauz Ghari Makbal near
Afghanistan border in Upper Kurram. I
took part in various attacks across the
border in Afghanistan on NATO/Allied
troop convoys. In year 2008, I got
appointed as commander of Khalifa group
in Mohmand Agency. I established my
markaz at Lakaro Walikore Qandharo and
made a pact with Commander Abdul Wali
of Tehreek-e-Taliban Mohammad. I got
training of preparation of improvised
explosive devices/ suicide jackets at markaz
of Taliban commander Abdul Wali. I
confess _to_ having prepared_a_Shahzore
vehicle borne improvised explosive that was
used on 26 October 2008 at Nahaqi check
post suicide attack. I used to roam around
in} Mohmand agency alongwith my
companions brandishing weapons and
regularly coordinated my activities
alongwith Taliban commander Abdul wali
at Mohmand agency. On 29 October 2008
upon reaching DG-II_ check post, one of
the sentries deployed on duty gave signal to
our _car for stopping. As I and my driver
companion _were_armed_ with SMG _ and
grenades so I told my companion to speed
up the car, while I started firing upon the
troops _deployed_at_check post. Upon
retaliatory firing by the troops, I got
injured at my shoulder while other person
alongside me died on spot. During the fire
fight, I abandoned the car and ran towards
nearby built up area. I tried to avoid
capture by taking shelter behind hostage
children, but_after_a prolonged fight my

5

ammunition ran out and I surrendered_to

the troops.”
(emphasis provided)

6. Valuable arguments of the worthy
counsel for the parties heard and the available
record of the case thoroughly considered.

7. The worthy counsel for the petitioner
raised a preliminary objection that with the flux of
time, the impugned conviction by the Military
Court had lost its legal force, and thus was a
nullity in the eyes of law. The legal contention of
the worthy counsel for the petitioner was that the
Military Court had sentenced the convict to death
under the provisions introduced in the Army Act
through the Sun Set legislation, which expired on
7 January, 2017, and thereafter, the sentence of
death could not be executed. The worthy counsel
placed reliance on Air _League’s_case (2011
SCMR 1254). It was further contended that as the
matter was still before this Court and the death
sentence had not been executed, it was not a closed
and past transaction, so as to rescue the
prosecution under section 6 of the General Clauses

Act, 1897. In this regard, reliance was placed on

Sheikh Liagat Hussain’s case (PLD 1999 SC
6
504), Imran’s_case (PLD 1996 Lahore 542),
Mehram Ali’s case (PLD 1998 SC 1445).
8. In response, the worthy Deputy
Attorney General vehemently opposed the
contention of the worthy counsel for the petitioner
by stating that all actions taken, decision passed by
the Military Court under the Army Act were
protected under section 6 of the General Clauses
Act, 1897. In this regard, reliance was placed on
Asad_Ali’s case (PLD 1998 SC 161), Mehram
Ali’s case and Air League’s case supra.
9. This contested legal issue does not
require a definite finding of this Court in the
instant petition, as during the present proceedings,
the Parliament introduced the Constitutional
(Twenty Third Amendment) Act, 2017 (“Act of
2017”) and the Pakistan Army (Amendment)
Act, 2017, whereby the life of the Military Courts
was extended for a further period of two years
from 07.01.2017. The relevant provision of the Act
of 2017 so introduced, reads;

“1, Short title and commence.—

(1) This Act may be called the Pakistan
Army (Amendment) Act, 2017.

(2) It shall come into force at once and
shall be deemed to have taken effect
on and from 7" January, 2017.
7

(3) The provisions of this Act shall
remain in force for a period of two
years from the date of its
commencement and shall cease to
form part of the Constitution and
shall stand repealed on the expiry of
the said period.”

10. Accordingly, the preliminary
objection of the worthy counsel for the petitioner
regarding the conviction being without any lawful
authority based on the legal premise that the Sun
Set Legislation had lapsed would be of no legal
avail to the convict.

11. During the proceeding of the instant
case, the worthy counsel for the petitioner moved
an application (C.M.No.1752-P/2016), raising a
specific plea that Major Faisal Riaz Kiyani
purporting to be a member of the Military Court
had raised serious objections to the death sentence
awarded to the three specific cases mentioned
therein. In response to the said application, the
Assistant Judge Advocate General expressly
denied the veracity of the said letter and in support
thereof filed a personal affidavit.

12. There being contesting assertions of
the parties duly supported by affidavits, this

Constitutional Court would not enter into resolving
8

the said issue in the instant constitutional petition.
In this regard, we seek guidance from the
judgment of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan
in Ghulam _Nabi’s case (PLD 2001 SC 415),
wherein it was held that;

“Tt hardly needs any elaboration
that the superior Courts should
not involve themselves into
evidence. This can more
appropriately be done in the
ordinary Civil Procedure for
litigation by a_ suit. This
extraordinary jurisdiction is
intended primarily, for
providing an expeditious remedy
in a case where the illegality of
the impugned action of an
executive or other authority can
be established without any
elaborate enquiry into
complicated or disputed facts.”

Similarly, in Shamim_Khan’s_ case
(PLD 2005 SC 792), the Full Bench of the Apex
Court has observed that;

“Controversial question of
facts requiring
adjudication on the basis
of evidence could not be
undertaken by the High
Court under its
Constitutional jurisdiction
where the material facts
were admitted by the
respondent, High Court
could interfere.”
9

This was followed by the Apex Court
in Muhammad Sadiq Vs. Ilahi Bukhsh (2006
SCMR 12) and has held that;

“High Court in exercise of its

constitutional jurisdiction is not

suppose to dilate upon the
controversial questions of facts
and interfere in the concurrent
findings on such question in the
writ jurisdiction but it is settled
law that if findings of facts are
based on misreading or non-
reading of evidence or not
supported by any evidence, the

High Court without any hesitation

can interfere in the matter in its

constitutional jurisdiction.”

And finally, the Supreme Court has

reiterated the above principles in Watan Party’s
case (PLD 2012 SC 292).
13. In view of the ‘ratio decidendi’ laid
down in the above judgments of the apex Court, it
is clear that controversies, which are based on
contentious disputed fact, should not be
entertained and adjudicated in constitutional
jurisdiction. Accordingly, the contention of the
worthy counsel for the petitioner will not be
considered while deciding the instant petition.

14. Now, moving on to the next

contention of the worthy counsel for the petitioner
10

qua the access to the record of the Military Court
leading to the impugned conviction. When
confronted, the worthy Deputy Attorney General
vehemently contested the same and submitted that
by allowing free access of the record and that too
in an open Court would be against the law and put
the life of the Presiding Officer, witnesses and
counsel representing the parties at peril.

15. In this regard, the attention of this
Court was drawn to the procedure endorsed, and
adopted by the Apex Court, in case titled, “Said
Zaman Khan Vs Federation of Pakistan &
others” (C.P.No.842 of 2016) wherein, it was held
that;-

97.The learned counsels for the petitioners
complained of limited access to the record
of the proceedings conducted by the
FGCM. We cannot ignore the fact that in
view of the peculiar nature of the offences
for the commission whereof the Convicts
have been accused, it was imperative that
efforts should be made to ensure_the
security and safety of the Members of the
FGCM. witnesses produced the
Prosecuting and the Defending Officers
andthe interpreters. Such sensitivity
necessitated by the existing extra-ordinary
circumstances has been reflected in Section
2-C of the Pakistan Army Act, incorporated
through a subsequent Amending Act dated
19.11.2015. In the instant cases through
specific Order passed by this Court, all the
learned__counsels__were__ permitted __to
examine the record of the proceedings of
the FGCM, which has been made available
to this Court. It has also been noticed that
at no point of time after the confirmation of

11

the sentence by the FGCM, any application
was filed to the Competent Authority for the
supply of the copies of the proceedings, if
so required, in terms of Rule 130 of the
Pakistan Army Act Rules, 1954. Such
applications were not even moved during
the pendency of the proceedings before the
High Courts or even before this Court.

In the circumstances, we are not persuaded
that any prejudice has been caused to the
petitioners, in this behalf.

(emphasis provided)

16. In view of the definite direction
rendered by the Apex Court, this Court decided
that the record and the proceedings should not be
made open to public, and that the recorded
proceedings leading to the impugned conviction
should only be provided to the worthy counsel for
the petitioner, and that too after due precautions
are taken to ensure that the identity of the
witnesses, Presiding Officers and the worthy
counsel for the parties in the proceedings
challenged before this Court, are not divulged or
revealed. As a further precautionary measure, the
worthy Deputy Attorney General insisted that the
copies of the written notes taken by the worthy
counsel for the petitioner during the inspection of
the record allowed by this Court be also provided

to the prosecuting team. The same being not
12

prejudicial to the defense of the convict was
allowed.

17. Accordingly, the worthy Deputy
Attorney General alongwith the official custodian
of the record were directed to provide to the
worthy counsel for petitioner, the recorded trial
proceedings at the Judges’ Library, Peshawar High
Court, Peshawar. And this Court, ensured that the
entire record of the Military Court leading to the
impugned conviction had been inspected and
examined by the worthy counsel for the convict
prior to his addressing legal submissions before
this Court.

18. Before this Court considers the merits
of the valuable submissions of the worthy counsel
for the parties, it would be crucial to first
determine the scope of judicial review mandated to
this constitutional Court in adjudicating the
challenge made to the conviction and sentence
awarded to a civilian by a Military Court under the
Army Act. This jurisdictional issue has been a
matter of great deliberation by the superior Courts
of our jurisdiction, which culminated in the

decision of the apex Court in Said Zaman Khan’s
13

case supra, wherein the worthy Supreme Court

held that;

“93. It may be noted that the actions
complained of can even otherwise be
without jurisdiction, a separate and
independent ground available to
challenge the sentences and convictions
of the FGCM, therefore, it must
necessarily be examined whether the
FGCM had the jurisdiction over the
person tried and the offence for which
such trial has taken place and to
ascertain existence or otherwise of any
other defect or a gross illegality in the
exercise of jurisdiction denuding the
same of validity.

However, we cannot lose sight
of the non-obstantive provision {in the
Constitution ic. Article 199(3)}
impeding the exercise the powers of
Judicial Review by the High Court
under Article 199 of the Constitution.
Consequently, the boundaries of the
available jurisdiction cannot be pushed
so as to negate and frustrate the said
provision of the Constitution. An
exception to the rule barring exercise of
jurisdiction cannot be extended so s to
defeat and destroy the rule itself. It is

by now a well settled proposition of law,
as is obvious from the judgments of this
Court, referred _to and _ reproduced
hereinabove, that the powers of Judicial
Review under Article 199 of the
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of
Pakistan, 1973, against the sentences
and convictions of the FGCM is not
legally identical to the powers of an

Appellate Court. The evidence
produced cannot be analyzed in detail

to displace any reasonable or probable
conclusion drawn by the FGCM nor
can the High Court venture into the
realm of the "merits" of the case.
However, the learned High Court can
always satisfy itself that it is not a case
of no evidence or insufficient evidence

or the absence of jurisdiction. ”
(emphasis provided)

19. Keeping the ratio decidendi of the

aforementioned judgment as our guiding principle,
14

it would be safe to state that this Court in its
constitutional jurisdiction has the legal mandate to
positively interfere with the decision of the
Military Courts on three fundamental grounds; if
the case of the prosecution is based, Firstly, on no
evidence, Secondly, insufficient evidence and
Thirdly, absence of jurisdiction.

20. Thus, the evidentiary value of the
prosecution evidence cannot be adjudged by this
Court as a Court of Appeal and that too on the
legal threshold required for conviction of a person
on a capital charge under the ordinary criminal
law. What this Court has to see is whether the
conviction recorded by the Military Court is based
on no or insufficient evidence or absence of
jurisdiction.

21. Even if this Court discards the entire
evidence of the prosecution witnesses, the
statement of the accused before the Judicial
Magistrate and Military Court, duly narrated
hereinabove, clearly speaks of his admission of
guilt of the charges framed against him. Needless
to mention, that prior to making his admission of

guilt before the Military Court, the convict had on
15

three previous occasions admitted his guilt;
Firstly, before the Judicial Magistrate, while
recording his statement under section 164 of
Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 (“Cr.P.C.”),
Secondly, during his period of Internment under
section 13 of the Actions (In Aid of Civil Power)
Regulation, 2011 and Thirdly, during the
proceedings of taking summary of evidence under
Rule 13 of the Rules.

22. No doubt, the challenge made to the
mode, manner and the time of the confessions
made by the accused, under the ordinary criminal
jurisprudence would seriously diminish the
evidentiary value thereof. But in view of the
limited scope available to this constitutional Court
in evaluating the evidence and the repeated
admission of guilt by the accused convict does not
warrant interference in the impugned conviction
and sentence awarded by the Military Court.

23. As far as the contention of the worthy
counsel for the petitioner that the convict was not
provided legal representation of his free choice, as
was his Fundamental Right under Article 10-A of

the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan,
16

1973 (“Constitution”) and Rules 23, 82, 83 and
87 of the Rules, it is noted that this issue was
resolved in Said Zaman _Khan’s case supra, by
Mr.Justice Faisal Arab in his separate note. It was
opined;-

“The Court in its anxiety to ensure that a crime may
not go unpunished must not lose sight of the fact
that the family members of the accused must be
given information of his arrest or detention. If in
the _present_case_had there been no categorical
admission of guilt by the convicted persons before
the Magistrate, retrial would have been the right

course to adopt.” (emphasis provided)

24. Thus, in the face of the bold repeated
admission of guilt made by the accused, the
impugned conviction and sentence does not
warrant to be set aside on this ground alone.
Moreover, in this regard, it is on record that when
confronted, the convict did not oppose or protest
the defending officer appointed to represent him
before the Military Court under Rule 23 of the
Rules.

25. Similarly, it was also argued by the
worthy counsel for the petitioner that the prosecution
had not obtained the requisite sanction of the Federal
Government and that the appeal of the convict has not
been considered and decided by the competent
authority. In response, the worthy Attorney General

produced copies of sanction of the Federal
17

Government for trial of accused by Military Court,
order of Court of Appeal whereby appeal filed by the
convict was rejected and orders of confirmation of
sentence and rejection of Mercy Petition by the Chief
of Army Staff.

26. The worthy counsel for the petitioner
further urged the Court that the charges for which
the convict was sentenced to death by the Military
Court is not an offence punishable to death under
the ordinary penal laws of Pakistan. Hence, it was
vehemently argued that the sentence of death could
not be maintained in the instant case.

27. It is an admitted position that
Muhammad Imran alias Mansoor son of Abdul
Manan is a civilian, who has been charged for four
distinct civil offences; firstly for designing a
vehicle for terrorist act and affixing thereon
improvised explosive for a terrorist attack,
secondly for attacking the law enforcing personnel
by firing with sub-machine gun, thirdly for
possessing fire arm and ammunition, and finally
for possessing grenades (explosive).

28. The two striking features in the above
charges are that firstly Muhammad Imran is not

charged for the death of any person, secondly he
18

was not charged for actually causing an explosion.

Keeping in view these two striking features of the

charges against Muhammad Imran, let us review

the jurisdictional mandate of a Military Court to

try a civilian for a civil offence, as provided under

section 59 of the Army Act. The said provision

reads:-

“59.Civil Offences.- (1) Subject to the
provisions of sub-section (2), any person
subject to this Act who at any place in or
beyond Pakistan commits any civil offence
shall be deemed to be guilty of an offence
against this Act and, if charged therewith
under this section, shall be liable to be dealt
with under this Act, and on conviction, to be
punished as follows, that is to say,-

(a) if the offence is one which would be
punishable under any law in force in
Pakistan with death or with
imprisonment for life, he shall be
liable to suffer any punishment
assigned for the offence by the
aforesaid law or such less punishment
as is in this Act mentioned; and

(b) in any other case, he shall be liable to
suffer any punishment assigned for the
offence by the law in force in Pakistan,
or rigorous imprisonment for a term
which may extend to five years or such
less punishment as is in this Act
mentioned.

Provided that, where the offence of

which any such person is found guilty is an
offence liable to Hadd under any Islamic
law, the sentence awarded to him shall be
that provided for the offence in that law.
(3) The powers of a Court martial or an
officer exercising authority under section 23
to charge and punish any person under this
section shall not be affected by reason of the
fact that the civil offence with which such
person is charged is also an offence against
this Act.

(4) Notwithstanding anything contained

in this Act or in any other law for the time

being in force a person who becomes subject

19

to this Act by reason of his being accused of
an offence mentioned in clause (d) of sub-
section (1) of section 2 shall be liable to be
tried or otherwise dealt with under this Act
for such offence as if the offence were an
offence against this Act and were committed
at a time when such person was subject to
this Act; and the provisions of this section
shall have effect accordingly.”
(emphasis provided)

29. The bare reading of clause (a) of sub-
section (1) of section 59 ibid clearly reveals that
the quantum of sentence that can be awarded by a
Military Court cannot go beyond that prescribed
for the said offence under the ordinary penal laws

enforced in Pakistan. This crucial issue came up

before the Apex Court in Brig (Retd) F.B.Ali’s

case (PLD 1975 SC 506), wherein the Homble
Court explained the limited scope of awarding
punishments being restricted to clause (a) and (b)
of section 59 of the Army Act. The apex Court
opined that;

“It is limited to an offence mentioned in
clause (d) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of
the said Act and its purpose is to make that
offence triable under the Army Act as if it
was an offence under the said Act and was
committed at the time when such person was
subject to the said Act. In the case of other
civil offences, the provisions of sub-section
(1) of section 59 are attracted. This sub-
section reads as follows;-

(1) Subject to the provisions of sub-
section (2), any person subject to this Act
who at any place in or beyond Pakistan
commits any civil offence shall be deemed

to be guilty of an offence against this Act
and, if charged therewith under this
20

section, shall be liable to be dealt with

under this Act, and on conviction, to be

punished as follows, that is to say,-

(a) ifthe offence is one which would be
punishable under any law in force
in Pakistan with death or with
imprisonment for life, he shall be
liable to suffer any punishment
assigned for the offence by the
aforesaid law or _ such less
punishment as is in this Act
mentioned;_and

(b) in any other case, he shall be liable
to suffer any punishment assigned
for the offence by the law in force in
Pakistan, or rigorous imprisonment
for a term which may extend to five
years or such less punishment as is
in this Act mentioned.

This section seems to provide that if any

person who is or has become subject to the

Army Act, commits any civil offence, he

shall be seemed to be guilty of an offence

against the said Act and, if charged

therewith, shall be liable to be tried by a

Court Martial subject to the limitations

mentioned in sub-section (2) and will be

punishable as prescribed in clauses (a) and

(b).”

30. This Court has to now consider
whether under the ordinary penal laws of Pakistan
the offences for which Muhammad Imran has been
convicted and sentenced to death carry the capital
punishment of death or otherwise.

31. There was no contest except the first
charge, which the worthy Deputy Attorney
General insisted was punishable with death under
the ordinary penal laws. For ease of reference, the
said charge is reiterated and it reads;-

“First Charge.
PAA Section 59
21

Committing a civil offence, that is to
say, designing vehicle for terrorists act,
in that he, at Nahaqi (Mohmand
Agency) during 2008, alongwith
Civilians Musafir and Farhan designed
a Shahzore vehicle by fixing improvised
explosive device for terrorist attack on
Nahaqi Check Post, Mohmand Rifles,
Frontier Corps ; and thereby committed
an offence punishable under Pakistan
Army (Amendment)Act, 2015.”

32. Now, when we canvas through the
ordinary penal laws relating to explosive and in
particular the offence for which the convict was
charged in the instant case, our attention is drawn
to the provisions of the Explosive Substances Act,
1908 (“Act of 1908”), and the more recent
legislation relating to terrorism, The Anti
Terrorism Act, 1997 (“Act of 1997”). In this
regard, let us first review section 3 of the Act of
1908, which was so rigorously relied upon by the
worthy Deputy Attorney General, contending that
the same to carry the death sentence. The said
provision provides;-

‘3.Punishment for causing explosion
likely to endanger life or property. Any
person who unlawfully and maliciously
causes by any explosive substance and
explosion of a nature likely to endanger
life or to cause serious injury to property
shall, whether any injury to person or
property has been actually caused or not
be punished with death or imprisonment

for life.”

(emphasis provided)
22

33. When we read the above provision of
law, it is but clear that the condition precedent for
saddling the said charge on any person is the very
act of explosion, which in the present case is
wanting. The charge against Muhammad Imran
was not for the act of causing an explosion. In fact,
he was charged for planting an explosive device.
This act could fall under the offences provided
under sections 4 and 5 of the Act of 1908, which at
best carry the maximum punishment for life and
not death.

34. More importantly, the Act of 1997, a
more recent legislation aimed to curb terrorism,
specifically provided in section 6 for offences
relating to explosives. The said provision reads;-

“Section 6 Terrorism.-

(1) In this Act, terrorism means the use or
threat of action where;

(a) the action falls with the meaning of sub-
section (2), and

(2) An action shall fall within the meaning of
sub-section (1), if it;

(A) ce cee cee cen cee cee cen cee ee cen aee cue een eee ee eee eae enaee
(c)..
(d)..
(C) ee cee cen cee cee cen cee cae cen aee cee eee eee ceneee ae ennaee
(ee) Involves use of explosives by any device
including bomb blast or having any
explosive substance without any lawful
justification or having been unlawfully
concerned with such explosive.

23

35. The punishment prescribed for the
above act of terrorism relating to explosives under
section 6(2)(ee) is provided in section 7 (1) (ff) in
terms that;-

“the act of terrorism committed falls under
section 6(2)(ee), shall be punishable with
imprisonment which shall not be less than
fourteen years but may extend _to

imprisonment for life.”
(Emphasis provided)

36. Thus, what we have are two penal
provisions prescribing two distinct punishments
for the same offence. Faced with such
circumstances, it is by now settled principle of safe
administration of criminal justice that the accused
is to be charged for an offence carrying a lesser
punishment. Moreover, this Court cannot lose sight
of the wisdom of the legislature, whereby it, while
enacting a law to curb terrorism has expressly
provided a lesser punishment for the offence
relating to explosive. When faced with these two
penal legislations regarding the same offence, the
one more recent has to be given precedent and
applied.

37. When confronted with the above legal
position, the worthy Deputy Attorney General

vehemently contended that Muhammad Imran
24

though not charged for the actual act of explosion,
had admitted in his statement that the Shahzore he
had laden with explosives was used in a terrorist
attack causing death to security personnel and
hence is criminally liable for the same. This Court
is not in consonance with the above contention of
the worthy Deputy Attorney General for the simple
reason that Muhammad Imran was not charged for
causing death to the security personnel, as a result
of the explosion. To saddle him with the
punishment of death would surely prejudice his
defence; an accused cannot be punished for an
offence he was not charged for. This cardinal
principle of safe administration of justice cannot
be lost sight of even in cases tried by the Military
Court under the Army Act.

38. In conclusion, keeping in view the
limited scope of judicial review mandated to this
Court and in the face of the repeated admission of
guilt made by the convict, culminating in
punishment awarded by the Court Martial, it would
not be appropriate for this Court to interfere in the
impugned conviction. However, as far as the

quantum of sentence is concerned, this Court has
25

serious reservations for awarding death sentence to

the convict for the charges he faced before the

Military Court.

38.

In view of the above deliberation, this

Constitutional Court finds that: -

(1)

(2)

(3)

The awarded of conviction by the Military
Court to Muhammad Imran does not warrant
interference by this Constitutional Court, as

it is not a case of no or insufficient evidence.

The sentence awarded to Muhammad Imran
alias Mansoor son of Abdul Manan,
however, warrants interference by this
Constitutional Court, as the Military Court
lacked legal jurisdiction to award death
penalty for the charges like the ones framed.

upon him.

The sentence of death awarded to
Muhammad Imran alias Mansoor son of
Abdul Manan and the confirmation thereof
passed by the Chief of Army Staff is set
aside and the case is remanded back to the
Military Court either to revisit the quantum

of punishment awarded or to alter the charge
26
framed against Muhammad Imran and
thereafter proceed against him under the

law.

Accordingly, for the reasons stated
hereinabove, this writ petition is disposed of, in the

above terms.
