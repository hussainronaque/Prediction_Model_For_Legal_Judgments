JUDGMENT

LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- This appeal is directed
against the judgment dated 02.10.2020 of the
learned Additional Sessions Judge / Judge Model
Criminal Trial Court, Peshawar, delivered in case
FIR No. 1611 dated 01.11.2016 under section 302
PPC of police station Chamkani, Peshawar,
whereby the appellant has been convicted under
section 302 (b) PPC and sentenced to suffer
imprisonment for life with fine of Rs. 4,00,000/-
(four lac) or in default whereof to further undergo
six months SI. Benefit u/s 382-B Cr.P.C. has been
extended to him,

2. Brief facts of the case are that on
01.11.2016, Tahir Khan SI (PW-9) sent murasila
(Ex.PA/1) to the police station stating therein that
on receipt of information about the occurrence he
rushed to the spot and found there the dead body
of one Mian Sharif son of Abdul Ghaffar lying in
Flying Coach No. C-1235/DIR, where brother of
the deceased namely Zulfiqar reported him that

his brother was stabbed to death by the appellant
in the flying coach wherein both i.e. the appellant
and the deceased were traveling to Chitral from
Peshawar. It is worth to mention that the appellant
was overpowered by driver of the coach and was
handed over to police on the spot.

3. On conclusion of investigation, challan was
put in Court which indicted the accused for
commission of the offence to which he pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial. Prosecution in order to
substantiate its case produced and examined 13
witnesses in all, whereafter statement of the
accused was recorded wherein he professed his
innocence. The learned trial court, after conclusion
of the trial, found him guilty of the charge and
while recording his conviction sentenced him as
mentioned above.

4, Arguments heard and available record
gone through.

5. Perusal of the case record would show that
in support of its case, prosecution produced and
examined 03 eyewitnesses to the occurrence
namely Abdul Wahab, Ameer Khan and Ameer-
ud-Din as PWs-4, 5 & 6 respectively. PW-4 Abdul
Wahab was driver of the flying coach wherein the
deceased was stabbed to death. He deposed
before the court that on the day of occurrence he
took his flying coach from Peshawar Adda for
Chitral with passengers and when the vehicle
reached near the cattle market, there he heard

shouting of the passengers on which he stopped
his vehicle and noted that head of the deceased
was resting against the pane of window and the
appellant was holding a knife in his hands. PW-4
is a natural witness being driver of the vehicle
wherein the occurrence took place who has
deposed in a very natural way about the
occurrence. He had no enmity or ill-will towards
the appellant to falsely implicate him in the case,
therefore, his testimony cannot be discarded.

6. The evidence furnished by PW-4 has been
supported by PW-5 and PW-6 who were traveling
in the coach. PW-5 namely Ameer Khan at the
relevant time was sitting on the last seat of the
vehicle with the appellant and the deceased. He
deposed that after covering a journey of 15/20
minutes when the vehicle reached near the cattle
market there the appellant attacked the deceased
with knife with which he received injuries on his
person whereafter other passengers present in the
vehicle overpowered him and took the knife from
him. Like evidence was furnished by PW-6 namely
Ameer ur Din who too was present in the vehicle
as one of the passengers. All the three
prosecution witnesses have deposed in a very
eloquent and natural way about the occurrence.
They were independent witnesses having no
personal grudge to depose falsely against the
appellant. The ocular account is supported by
medical examination of the deceased according to

which he had two injuries on vital parts of his body
caused by knife. Besides, from possession of the
appellant, the knife with which he had caused
injuries to the deceased too was recovered. In
addition, from the seat of the vehicle where the
deceased was sitting blood has been recovered
and also the investigation officer took into
possession the last worn blood stained clothes of
the appellant as well that of the deceased.
Furthermore, complainant of the case appeared
before the court as PW-7 who deposed quite in
line with what he had reported in his initial report
(Ex.PA/1).

7. Thorough and careful examination of the
case record would show that the prosecution has
proved its case against the appellant through
cogent and reliable evidence and beyond any
reasonable doubt and the conclusion drawn by the
learned trial Court leading to establishing the
charge against him are borne out of the case
evidence to which no exception could be taken by
this Court.

8. However, the moot question for
determination before this court is that whether the
appellant's case falls under section 302 (b) PPC
as has been held by the learned trial Court or
same comes within the purview of section 302(c)
PPC. Record shows that the appellant had no
enmity with the deceased or any of his family
members. According to the record, the appellant

and the deceased met each other by chance in
the Chitral bound flying coach and seated on rear
seat of the vehicle close to one and other when all
of a sudden the unfortunate occurrence took place
without any premeditation. Though the learned
defense counsel did not endeavor to bring the
appellant's case within the parameter of section
302 (c) PPC as no suggestion of any kind was
given to the prosecution witnesses that the
appellant had resorted to take the extreme step of
taking the deceased life under sudden and grave
provocation or under the heat of passion nor the
appellant himself took such plea in his statement
recorded under section 342 Cr.PC but in order to
know about the root cause of the incident and to
do complete justice we perused the police file by
taking it from the learned Addl. AG and found
therein the appellant's statement recorded under
section 161 Cr.PC. According to the appellant’s
ibid statement he was seated in the vehicle on its
rear seat with the deceased and shortly after
covering some distance he requested the
deceased who was seated against the window
seat to slide the window pane so that fresh air
could come as he i.e. the appellant was not feeling
well and was about to vomit which request was
turned down by the deceased by uttering in
“Pashto” on which hot words were exchanged
between the two whereupon the appellant took out
a knife and pushed it into the deceased body as a

result he received injuries with which subsequently
he died. It is worth to mention that the learned
Addl. AG and learned counsel for the complainant
did not dispute the version given by the appellant
in his 161 Cr.PC statement.

9. In the situation mentioned above, we are of
the considered view that the appellant has
committed the offence under the heat of passion
and without any premeditation and it is well settled
that where some offence is committed without any
premeditation and in the heat of passion and at
the spur of moment then in such like situation, the
courts of law normally award minimum sentence
to the accused than the normal one by bring his
case under section 302 (c) PPC.

10. Learned counsel for the complainant
vehemently argued that as the appellant had
acted harshly by inflicting two successive serious
injuries to the deceased on vital parts of his body,
therefore, his case does not fall under section 302
(c) PPC. We are not in agreement with what
learned counsel for the complainant has submitted
at the bar to the ibid effect because when under
the heat of passion some act is done then its
magnitude cannot be weighed in golden scale as it
is not expected from a mentally disturbed person
‘to main certain limits while committing a crime with
disturbed mind.

11. | Request of the appellant from the deceased
to slide the window-pane as by then he was not

feeling well and the latter's obstinacy in this
respect caused stirs in the former's disturbed mind
which though in the ordinary course of event
cannot be made a ground to downgrade the
murder but it is settled that each criminal case is
decided on its own facts and circumstances.
There is no material on the record that just before
the occurrence what else had happened than what
is disclosed by the appellant in his 161 Cr.PC
statement. Whether it was mere refusal of the
deceased to slide the window pane or he had
uttered something else towards the appellant
shrouds in mystery which aspect of the case
coupled with the fact that both the parties were not
known to each other before the occurrence and
that the exceeded action of the appellant was
neither pre-meditated one nor it was done with
any pre-existing mind can be considered to hold
that the murder committed by the appellant
squarely falls within the ambit of section 302 (c)
PPC instead of section 302 (b) PPC and it is held
So by us.

12. After holding that the murder committed by
the appellant comes within the parameter of
section 302 (c) PPC the next question would be
about the period of imprisonment to be awarded to
him. In our considered opinion, the ends of justice
would meet if a sentence of 10 years
imprisonment is awarded to him keeping in view of

the circumstances of the case.
13. For what has been discussed above, we
Partially allow this appeal, modify the impugned
judgment of the learned trial Court and
consequently conviction of the appellant is
converted from section 302 (b) PPC to section 302
(c) PPC and his sentence is reduced to ten years
(10) rigorous imprisonment with benefit u/s 382-B
Cr.PC, however, he shall pay the fine of Rs.
4,00,000/- as compensation to legal heirs of the

deceased and in default whereof shall suffer six

months SI.
