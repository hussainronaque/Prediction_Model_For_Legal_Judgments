ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.--- This criminal appeal is

by learned Additional Sessions Judge-II, Bannu, whereby

the same impugned judgment, against acquittal of

appellant under section 324/34 P.P.C.

Khandan Khan and Sher Akbar Khan left the house in

connection with some business in Bannu_ Bazar.

Accordingly, the said Sher Akbar Khan was going ahead at

some distance from them and when they reached near the

shop of Hamzali Khan on the thoroughfare at 0730 hours

absconding co-accused Rehmatullah and Farid Nawaz, duly

armed with Kalashnikovs, emerged on the spot and started

firing at them. As a result of which Sher Akbar Khan was

hit and fell down on the ground, while the complainant and

his son Khandan escaped unhurt. They being empty handed

could do nothing. The accused thereafter decamped from

Rahm Zad supplementary challan was submitted. On

After P.M examination the doctor handed over the P.M

(Ex.PW3/1) report along with Qamees, shalwar and bottle

having two bullets to the constable Sher Wali.

The statements of remaining prosecution

witnesses are formal in nature.

7. After close of prosecution evidence, statement

of accused/appellant, Rahamzad was recorded under section

342 Cr.P.C, wherein he denied the allegations leveled

against him. However, he neither opted to be examined on

oath under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C nor wished to produced

defence evidence.

8. The learned trial court after evaluating the

evidence available on record in light of arguments advanced

from both sides, found the accused/appellant guilty of the

offence and recorded his conviction, as mentioned above

vide impugned judgment dated 21.02.2015.

9. Learned counsel for the appellant argued that
-9-

impugned judgment of the learned Trial Court is against the

law, facts and evidence available on record; that the

complainant and eye witness failed to establish their

presence on the spot through cogent and confidence

inspiring evidence; that there is considerable delay in

lodging the FIR which is the result of consultation and

deliberation; that the prosecution story in shape of FIR is

not supported even by the site plan as the place of

occurrence is different from that shown in column No.4 of

the F.I.R; that the motive behind the occurrence was alleged

to be blood feud between the complainant and absconding

co-accused Rehmatullah but the complainant has failed to

explain as to why the deceased was going ahead or separate

from the complainant and eye witness; that the complainant

has also failed to explain that how he was spared when he

was the prime target of the assailants as he had committed

murder of father of the co-accused Rehmatullah; that their

testimony is suffering from material contradictions and

discrepancies creating serious doubts in the prosecution
-10-

case; that site plan and medical evidence contradict the

ocular account; that mere positive FSL report qua the crime

empties and blood stained articles of the deceased, in

absence of direct evidence of unimpeachable character and

recovery of crime weapon, would not be sufficient for

recording conviction in a capital charge; that prosecution

evidence being suffering from doubts, benefit of the same is

to be extended to the appellant and he be acquitted of the

charge.

10. Conversely, learned AAG assisted by learned

counsel for the complainant argued that appellant is directly

charged for effective firing at the deceased; that ocular

account furnished by the PWs is straightforward and

confidence inspiring which is corroborated by medical

evidence, site plan, recoveries of blood and empties from

the spot; that the occurrence has been reported within two

hours after arranging a cot for the dead body of the

deceased and then shifting the same to the Addah of

Shahbaz Azmat Khel, where a Suzuki was arranged for
-1l-
transporting the same to the hospital, hence the time
consumed has been sufficiently explained; that the FSL
report Ex.PW7/6 also corroborates the prosecution case by
elaborating that the firing has been made from different
weapons of 7.62 bore; that the prosecution has successfully
proved the guilt of the appellant through overwhelming
evidence available on record and sought dismissal of the
appeal of the appellant Rahamzad and also prayed for his

conviction under section 324/34 PPC.

11. We have heard the learned counsel for the

parties as well as the learned Addl: .AG and have gone

through the evidence on record.

12. Perusal of the record reveals that as per first

information report, the occurrence took place in the manner

that on the eventful day, when the complainant Hukam Zad

with his sons Sher Akbar Khan and Khandan Khan, were

going towards Bannu for some business and reached at the

spot, near the shop of one Hamza Ali Khan, Sher Akbar

was ahead, while they were following him at some distance;
-12-

that in the meanwhile accused /appellant and co-absconding

accused duly armed with Kalashnikovs appeared and

started firing at them, as a result of which Sher Akbar Khan

got hit sustained injures, while they escaped unhurt. The

deceased on the way succumbed to the injuries.

13 The ocular account of the occurrence has been

furnished by Hukam Zad (PW.5) and Khandan (PW-6) who

being father and brother of the deceased are closely related

with the deceased and admittedly there is blood feud

between the parties, therefore these witnesses can

legitimately be termed as interested witness and statements

of these witnesses are to be looked into with great care and

caution. Undoubtedly the statement of interested witness

which even for that matter inimical witness can be taken

into consideration but the rule of appraisal is that the same

is supported by some strong corroboration from some

independent source. In order to believe a witness first the

prosecution has to satisfy the Court regarding presence of

the witnesses at the spot and secondly whether they are
-13-

credible truthful witnesses and thereafter conviction can be

based on testimony of inimical witness, if same is

corroborated by some strong corroborative piece of

evidence.

14. The complainant in his statement as PW-5

stated that “we were proceeding to Bazar for business of

old tyres shop at Bannu Naurang road in Kotka Jumma

Khan. Both of my sons are running the said shop

jointly.” So the complainant was not going with his sons in

routine to the said shop except on the eventful, so he is a

chance witness and his explanation regarding his presence

is not satisfactory, rather inimical towards the accused.

Reliance is placed on case titled “The State Vs Mohammad

Sharif and 3 other” (1995 SCMR 635) and “Khalid Javid

and another Vs the State” (2003 SCMR 1419).

The fact of enmity has been admitted by the

complainant (PW-5) in his cross examination by stating

that:
-14-

“ It is correct that that some 17/18 years
back, I was charged in a case, wherein
Murtaza Khan, father of accused
Rehmatullah and Hagqdar Khan , first
cousins of father of accused Farid Nawaz
were murdered. It is correct that I used to
wonder with weapon whenever I come out
of my house. I cannot tell any reason that
whey Sher Akbar was ahead of us and

Khandan was behind me”.
When direct motive was with relatable to the complainant,
because he had allegedly committed the murder of father of
absconding accused Rehmatullah, then why the
complainant was spared and the deceased was done to

death. In this respect reliance is placed on case titled “Amin

Khan Vs Jana Gul and others” (1984 SCMr 937)

Khandan Khan (PW-6) during his cross

examination has admitted that:

“It is correct that I used spectacles as my eye
sight is weak. I can identify a person from the
distance of 10 to 15 paces. The accused
Rahamzad was present at a distance of 54
paces from me, Rehmatullah 50 paces and
Farid Nawaz at a distance of 46 paces from

me ”

He in his cross examination further stated that:
-15-

“IT cannot tell that from whose, firing the

deceased was hit.”

He went on to state that:

“Rehmatullah accused had come _ close
towards Sher Akbar Khan to make firing for
the second time at him, however, the same
has also not been disclosed by me to the ILO

at the time of spot inspection.”

In such a situation, when the eye witness cannot identify a

person beyond 10/15 paces, how he had identified the

accused/ appellant from a distance of 54 paces. He cannot

tell that from whose firing the deceased was hit and he only

saw accused Rehmatullah, who had come close towards

Sher Akbar Khan to make firing. In this view of the matter,

the possibility cannot be ruled out that the appellant being

maternal uncle of the absconding accused Rehmatullah has

been implicated on the strength of his relationship and

enmity with the absconding accused, otherwise he is an

aged man of 59/60 years. The statements of eye witnesses

are smeared with interestedness, seems to be the result of

inimical intent, did not inspire confidence, on the basis of
-16-
which capital punishment could not be awarded, hence, are

discarded.

15. As per first information report the occurrence

took place at 07.30 hours while the report was made at the

hospital at 09.30 hours. The record is also suggestive of the

fact that the occurrence has taken place within the limits of

city or the suburb area and the complainant along with PW

Khandan were coming to Bannu Bazar by foot, so in such

like circumstances there is strong possibility that the time

had been consumed by the police in procuring and planting

eye-witnesses and in cooking up a story for the prosecution

before preparing police papers. Moreover, the distance has

not been brought on record neither by the prosecution nor

by the defence but it is clear from the statement of the

Investigating officer that he reached to the spot within

20/25 minutes from the Police Station to the place of

occurrence. In column No.2 of inquest report (Ex.PW4/3)

distance between spot and Police Station is shown as

“towards East a km from police station”. Undoubtedly
-17-
the occurrence has taken place within the jurisdiction of
Police Station Saddar, Bannu. So the non-availability of
traffic or any other ground urged by the prosecution would
be of no use to them and delay in the circumstances of the
case when the parties are tagged in blood feud reacts on the
genuineness of the story set up by the prosecution and of
course presence of eye witnesses at the relevant time.

Wisdom is derived from case titled “State through the

Advocate General N\W.F.P Peshawar Vs. Shah Jehan”

(PLD2003 SC 70).

16. Another striking feature of case is that at the

time of report complainant (PW-5) had stated that “when

we reached near the shop of Hamza Ali Khan, the

tragedy occurred. On contrary the complainant being an

aged man of 60/62 years and resident of the same village is

supposed to be well conversant with the location of his

native village. According to the statement complainant and

FIR, the place of occurrence is a thoroughfare near the shop

of Hamza Ali, while in the site plan the deceased and the
-18-

eye witnesses have been shown in the fields. Disparity of

place of occurrence in the FIR and in the site plan clearly

manifests that the complainant and the eye witness were not

present at the relevant time. Had they been present over

there they would have definitely pointed out the exact place

where the occurrence had taken place.

17. The younger always follows the elder one as a

matter of respect and tradition of the area. The stance of the

prosecution that since they were having enmity that is why

they were at a distance from each other is not appealable to

the mind, because if they are having such intense enmity in

the same village and were roaming in the same area, then

they should have firearm with them as deposed by the

complainant mentioned above.

18. There is no denial to the fact that there are

multiple injuries, 12 entry, 11 exit one graze wound on the

person of the deceased but with a formidable weapon like

Kalashnikov ordinary magazine accommodates 30 rounds.
-19-
Now the old principle of law that multiple injuries would be
the doing of more than one person has changed after
introduction of the Kalashnikov. Now one person can inflict
as many as 30 entry wounds, so multiple number of injuries
would not ordinarily mean that it is the doing of more than

one person.

19. As per recovery memo (Ex.PR to Ex.PR/2) the

1.0 had taken into possession blood stained articles, 31
empties of Kalashnikov and a phial containing bullets on
the day of the occurrence i.e. 23.12.2013 but astonishingly
the blood stained articles were received to the FSL on
26.12.2013 while the empties and bullets were received to
the fire arms expert on 01.01.2014. Even if report of the fire
arms expert is considered to be correct then in the site plan

no points were given by the I.O to the empty shell.

20. It is settled law that for giving the benefit of

doubt it is not necessary that there should be many

circumstances creating doubts. Single circumstance creating
-20-

reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of

accused makes him entitled to its benefit, not as a matter of

grace and concession but as a matter of right. Reference is

made to case "Muhammad Akram v. State" (2009

SCMR 230). All these serious issues create doubts in our

mind regarding the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable

doubt and these material facts favouring the appellants were

not considered by the learned trial Court while appraising

the evidence of the prosecution. In the absence of truthful,

trustworthy and reliable and confidence inspiring evidence,

the learned trial Court has wrongly not extended the benefit

of doubt to the accused/appellant.

al. In view of what has been discussed above, We,

accept Criminal Appeal No.22-B/2015 filed by Rahamzad

Khan, appellant, as a result whereof, conviction and

sentence recorded by the learned trial court vide judgment

dated 21.02.2015 is set aside and the appellant Rahamzad

Khan is ordered to be acquitted of the charge in case FIR
-21-
No.666 dated 23.12.2016, under sections 302/324/34,
P.P.C., at Police Station, Saddar, Bannu. He shall be

released forthwith if not required in any other case.

22. Murder Reference No.01-B/2015 forwarded by

the learned trial court for confirmation of sentence of death

inflicted upon the convict is answered in NEGATIVE.

23. So far as Cr.A No.37-B/2015 filed by the

complainant, namely Hukamzad Khan against acquittal of
Rahamzad Khan under section 324/34 PPC, for the reasons
afore-stated, the same being devoid of any legal force is

accordingly dismissed.

Above are the reasons of our short order of the even

date.
