Date of hearing 30.11.2015
Appellant-petitioner Muhammad Haneef by Mr. Muhammad
Imran Khan Gandapur, Advocate
Respondent Muhammad Shahzad etc by Mr. Adnan Ali
Assistant AG for State and Mr. Saleem Ullah Khan Ranazai,

Advocate for accused / respondent.

MUHAMMAD GHAZANFAR KHAN, J.- Through the
instant appeal, the appellant has called in question the
judgment dated 28.4.2015 rendered by learned Resident
Judicial Magistrate, Daraban (D.I.Khan), whereby
accused/respondents Mohammad Shahzad and
Mohammad Fayaz were acquitted in case FIR No.134
dated 13.6.2013 registered under sections 506/337-
F(i)/34 PPC read with section 13 Arms Ordinance at

police station Daraban, D.I.Khan.

2. The prosecution case, in brief, is that on
13.6.2013 at 1015 hours, complainant Mohammad
Hanif reported the matter to the local police to the effect
that he alongwith his cousin Abdur Rashid, nephew
Mohammad Khalil Ahmad and Mohammad Ramzan
were present in his property, when both the accused

came there on motorcycle duly armed with pistol and
-2-

Kalashnikov and started firing at them; that during
scuffle, accused/respondent Mohammad Shahzad gave
pistol blows on the head of complainant, with which he
received injuries, | whereas = accused/respondent
Mohammad Fayaz gave blows on the head of Abdur
Rashid with ‘butt’? of Kalashnikov; that nephew of
complainant tried to snatch pistol from
accused/respondent Mohammad Shahzad but he started
firing, due to which Khalil Ahmad sustained injury on
his left. In the meanwhile, Gulistan, cousin of
complainant came to the spot and they disarmed with
the accused and recovered a Kalashnikov and 30 bore
pistol from them, where after the accused/respondents

fled away.

3. After completion of usual investigation,
complete challan against the accused/respondents was
submitted before the learned trial Court, where they
were formally charged, to which they did not plead
guilty and claimed trial. In order to establish the guilt of
accused/respondents, the prosecution examined thirteen
witnesses. The statements of accused/respondents were
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein they
professed innocence and false implication. However,
they neither appeared as their own witnesses on oath nor
produced any evidence in their defence. After hearing

the arguments of learned counsel for the parties, the
-3-

learned trial Court acquitted the accused/respondents

vide impugned judgment dated 28.4.2015.

4. The learned counsel for the appellant mainly
argued that no proper charge was framed by the learned
trial Court, as no description of Police Station was
referred and that offences were also not mentioned
under separate heads. He further argued that no separate
challan under section 13 Arms Ordinance was
requisitioned and the charge was recorded on a printed
form, thus the learned trial Court has erred in acquitting

the accused/respondents.

5. As against that, learned counsel for the
accused/respondents supported the judgment of learned

trial Court.

6. I have heard the arguments of learned counsel
for the parties and have gone through the record and law

on the subject.

7. The contention of learned counsel for the
appellant appears to be misconceived for the simple
reason that though charge has not been framed under
separate heads, but the allegations against the
accused/respondents have properly been mentioned in
the charge sheet and the non-mentioning of police

station has not prejudiced the case of appellant. Section
-4-

235 Cr.P.C deals with trial of more than one offence.
For ready reference, section 235 Cr.P.C is reproduced
below:-

“Trial for more than one offence...(1) If, in

one series of acts so connected together as

to form the same transaction, more offences

than one are committed by the same person,

he may be charged with, and tried at one

trial for, every such offence.

(2) Offence falling within two definitions.

If the acts alleged constitute an offence

falling within two or more separate

definitions of any law in force for the time

being by which offences are defined or

punished, the person accused of them may

be charged with, and tried at one trial for,
each of such offences.

From the bar reading of above reproduced section of
law, it is clear in one series of acts so connected together
as to form the same transaction, more offences than one
are committed by the same person, he may be charged
with, and tried at one trial for, every such offence and If
the acts alleged constitute an offence falling within two
or more separate definitions of any law in force for the
time being by which offences are defined or punished,
the person accused of them may be charged with, and
tried at one trial for, each of such offences. Such being
the case, no illegality appears to have been committed
by the learned trial Court in framing charge against the

accused/respondents. No other ground was agitated by
-5-

learned counsel for the appellant at the time of

arguments.

8. For the reasons mentioned above, the instant
appeal has no legs to stand upon and is, therefore,
dismissed.
Announced.
