SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- Being booked in
case FIR No.178 dated 07.7.2020, registered under
Section 324/34 PPC at police station Mullazai, District
Tank, accused/petitioner Fateh Khan has approached this
Court for his release on bail, as he was declined bail by
the Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, Tank
vide order dated 29.7.2020.

2. The story of the prosecution as disclosed in
the first information report (F.I.R.), in brief, is that on
07.7.2020 at 0910 hours, complainant Janat Meer, in
injured condition alongwith his injured brother Noor
Ullah, made report in the Civil Hospital Tank to the
effect that on the eventful day, at about 0730 hours
(morning), he alongwith his brother Noor Ullah reached

to their lands known as Toti Wala for labour work, their
-2-

cousins accused Fateh Khan and Madday Khan while
standing inside the bulwark (Morcha/Burj) situated on
rooftop of the Kotha, raised slogan to stop and opened
firing at them with their respective weapons, resultantly,
the complainant and his brother got hit and fell to the
ground, whereas his brother Rehmat Ullah, fortunately
escaped unhurt. The accused decamped from the spot
after commission of the offence. Besides the
complainant and injured PW Noor Ullah, the occurrence
is stated to be witnessed by his brother Rehmat Ullah.
Motive for the offence is stated to be a dispute over land.
He charged the accused for commission of the offence.
On the report of complainant, murasila was drafted
which was sent to police station Mullazai and was
incorporated in the captioned F.I.R.

3. I have heard arguments of learned counsel
for the petitioner, the learned State counsel assisted by
learned counsel for the complainant and perused the file
with their able assistance.

4, It is the case of prosecution that at the
eventful time, the petitioner alongwith his brother was
present inside the bulwark (Burj/Morcha) situated on the
rooftop of their Kotha and after threatening them to stop,
started indiscriminate firing which caused injuries to
both i.e. the complainant and his brother. The record was

read with the able assistance of the learned counsel for
-3-

parties and found that the place of occurrence is situated
in the agricultural land of the parties where the accused/
petitioner was shown standing inside the bulwark
situated on the rooftop of the Kotha constructed for
agricultural purposes. It is pertinent to mention that the
place wherefrom the accused/petitioner allegedly fired at
the complainant party is lying at a distance of 220 paces
which can be rounded up as 400 feet. This is what is
held by the apex Court in case titled Abdul Jabbar alias
Jabbari Vs.The State _(2017_SCMR_ 1155), “Eye-
witnesses claimed to have seen the occurrence from a
distance of about 117-1/2 feet and still they claimed to have
witnessed every detail of the incident including the different
weapons being used by the accused party, which was a claim
which could not be easily accepted’. The complainant is
yet to establish that whether from such a long distance
the voice if raised could be heard and as to whether the
accused could reasonably be seen and identified from
such a long distance that too inside the covered bulwark
(Morcha). Another intriguing aspect of the case is that
the Investigating Officer at the time of spot inspection
did not recover crime empties from the spot where the
accused were shown present at the time of firing. These
are the things when placed together makes the case of
the petitioner arguable for the purpose of bail. True, that
while hearing bail application, the Courts are to exercise

restraint and to avoid deeper appreciation of evidence,
-4-

but equally true that bail applications cannot be heard
and decided in vacuum, rather the Courts seized of the
matter should assess the available material brought
before. The situation has been beautifully dealt with by
the apex Court in case titled “Zaigham Ashraf Vs. The

State and others” (2016 SCMR 18), wherein it has been
held that:

"9, To curtail the liberty of a person is
a serious step in law, therefore, the
Judges shall apply judicial mind with
deep thought for reaching at a fair and
proper conclusion albeit tentatively
however, this exercise shall not to be
carried out in vacuum or in a flimsy
and casual manner as that will defeat
the ends of justice because if the
accused charged, is ultimately
acquitted at the trial then no reparation
or compensation can be awarded to
him for the long incarceration, as the
provisions of Criminal Procedure Code
and the scheme of law on the subject
do not provide for such arrangements
to repair the loss, caused to an v 5
accused person, detaining him in Jail
without just cause and reasonable
ground."

The apex Court in its recent judgment
reported as “Samiullah_ and another Vs. Laiq Zada
and another” (2020 SCMR_ 1115), has further
enlarged the scope of post arrest bail and preference
has been given to liberty of the persons charged rather
than incarceration in jail, in case the case on
appreciation comes to one of further inquiry, here too,
while applying the same parameters, the petitioner has

been succeeded in making out a case for bail as one of
Sf.

B

-5-

further inquiry. Resultantly, this petition is allowed and
the accused/petitioner is directed to be released on bail
subject to furnishing bail bonds in the sum of
Rs:2,00,000/- (rupees two lac) with two sureties, each in
the like amount, to the satisfaction of learned Illaga/Duty
Judicial Magistrate.

5. Needless to mention that the observations
so rendered are tentative in nature and shall not

influence the mind of the trial Court.

6. Above are the detailed reasons of my short
order of even date. LL
