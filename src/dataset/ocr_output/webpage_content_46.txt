Mr. Muntazir
Mehdi, APG. 
Mahar Khan
advocate for complainant. 
……………
 
                    During the course of
arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties, it seems to be an
admitted position that there was a dispute between the parties over an amount of
Rs.42,00,000/- and in this connection two cheques of Rs.15,00,000/- each were issued
by present applicants on 30.06.2010 while, for the remaining amount of
Rs.12,00,000/-, the two cheques of Rs.6,00,000/- each were issued by the
present applicants and one Haskeel respectively to the complainant and all
these cheques were bounced on presentation.
                    However it is also an
admitted position that the present applicants, against whom another FIR
No.286/2010 was lodged by the same complainant in respect of the earlier two
cheques dated 30.06.2011 which were allegedly bounced, have already been
granted pre-arrest bail vide order dated 17.09.2010 passed by learned 4th
Additional Sessions Judge, Karachi East, on the ground that the case requires
further enquiry. It is also an admitted fact that one Haskeel who had allegedly
issued cheque on 31.08.2010 for Rs.6,00,000/- to the complainant, has also been
granted pre-arrest bail in such case.
                    In the circumstances, there
appears no reason to deprive the applicants of similar concession that was
already extended in other cases of like nature with identical facts.
                    It has also been pointed out
that the case before the trial Court has proceeded after framing the charge and
now only two PWs remain to be examined while the applicants are present on
interim pre-arrest bail already granted by this Court to them long ago on
12.11.2010. Even otherwise, the case is not covered by the prohibitory clause of
section 497 Cr.P.C. and the civil litigation relating to the matter in
question, is also going on between the parties therefore, the present
applicants seem to be entitled for the concession of bail on account of similar
facts and circumstances under which they were extended the same relief in other
cases. 
                    Accordingly, the interim
pre-arrest bail granted to the applicants, is hereby confirmed on the same
terms and conditions.
