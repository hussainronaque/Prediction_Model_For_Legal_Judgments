MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- Through instant
appeal under Section 24 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 2019 (The Act),
the appellant has challenged the judgment of the
learned Additional Sessions Judge/Judge Special
Court, Dir Lower at Samar Bagh Camp Court Lal Qilla

Tapmucs| S.8: Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anuar
Station Sheikh Abad at 13:55 hours. During search of
the motorcycle, three packets of chars were recovered
from beneath the seat. When weighed on the spot, the
packets were found of 1084, 1224 and 1000 grams, as
such, total 3308 grams of chars were recovered from
motorcycle of the appellant. A sample of 08 grams was
separated from the first packet whereas samples of 06
grams each were taken from the second and third
packets and sealed in Parcel No. 1, 3 & 5 whereas the
remaining contraband were sealed in Parcel Nos. 2, 4 &
6. Recovery memo was prepared, the appellant was
formally arrested and the case was reported against
him through Murasila on the basis of which the
referred to above FIR was registered against him at P.S
Haya Serai.

3. After completion of investigation, complete
challan was put in Court for trial of the present
appellant. On commencement of trial, formal charge
was framed against him to which he did not plead
guilty and opted to face the trial. In order to further
substantiate its case against him, prosecution
produced and examined as many as 13 PWs. After
examination of the appellant u/s 342, Cr.P.C. the
learned trial Court vide impugned judgment convicted
and sentenced him in the manner as detailed in the
earlier portion of this judgment, hence, instant appeal.

4. Arguments heard and record perused.

5. Learned counsel for the appellant, after
giving a brief summary of the case, contended that the
chain of safe custody and safe transmission of the
samples is broken because prosecution has not
produced the police official who had carried the
samples to Forensic Science Laboratory. The learned
A.A.G. representing the State, opposed the above
contention of learned counsel for the appellant with the
submission that the I.0 had dispatched the samples to
FSL through constable Hayat Khan No. 797 but he was
mistakenly not examined during the trial in light of the
statement of the learned APP who had abandoned HC
Hayat Ullah No.641. After going through the record, it
transpired that the learned APP had never abandoned
constable Hayat Khan No. 797, the carrier of the
samples, rather HC Hayat Ullah was abandoned in
light of the statement of constable Muhammad Sohail
No.1115 (PW-1). The record shows that HC Hayat Ullah
and constable Muhammad Sohail are the marginal
witnesses of recovery memo Ex.PW-1/1. Since one of
the marginal witnesses namely constable Muhammad
Sohail was examined as PW-1, therefore, HC Hayat
Ullah was abandoned by prosecution. To this effect,
Waheed Asim, the learned DPP recorded his statement
on 03.08.2023 which is worth perusal.

Similar statement was recorded by APP
Hidayat Ullah on 25.01.2024 which is as under:

nll d- LPW-1 lo FACE ft ok
unt TSF SEO Follosf oO debe t vshle

The list of witnesses given in the final report
u/s 173, Cr.P.C. reflects that constable Hayat Khan
No. 797, carrier of the samples, has been marked as
abandoned “Ab” with red ink but to this effect neither
the statement of learned DPP nor that of the learned
APP is available on record. Thus, it has become
abundantly clear that the mistake occurred due to
almost similar names of two witnesses of prosecution
due to which constable Hayat Khan No. 797 was not
examined during the trial though he had carried the
samples to FSL and the same fact is duly verified by
road certificate and FSL report available on record.
6. Carrier of the samples was an important
witness who was mistakenly not produced before the
trial Court and the mistake surfaced in the matter for
the first time before this Court at the time of hearing
instant appeal. Section 540, Cr.P.C. confers vast and
unfettered powers on Court to summon at any stage,
either suo moto or on application of either of the
parties, any person and examine him as a witness or to

recall and re-examine any witness whose testimony is

Talamul/Cs° SB: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

deemed necessary for just decision of the case. For the
sake of convenience Section 540, Cr.P.C. is reproduced.

540. Power to summon material witness or
examine persons present. Any Court may, at
any stage of any inquiry, trial or other
proceeding under this Code, summon any
person as a witness, or examine any person in
attendance, though not summoned as a
witness, or recall and re-examine any person
already examined; and the Court shall summon
and examine or recall and re-examine any such
person if his evidence appears to it essential to
the just decision of the case.

The object of the above provision is to
ascertain the truth and to impart justice rather than to
advance the cause of prosecution or defence. The
second part of Section 540, Cr.P.C. which is mandatory
in nature, makes it imperative for the Court to recall or
re-examine a witness if the court considers the same
exercise for just decision of the case. While doing so the
question of prejudice to accused would not arise
because the aim of the Court for exercising its powers
so conferred upon it is to give effect to said provision

for arriving at a just decision. Reliance is placed on

“Ansar Mehmood Vs. Abdul Khaliq and another”
(2011 SCMR 713) wherein it has been held that:

Survey of the law undertaken by us, in no
uncertain terms, declares that powers of a
Court under section 540, Cr.P.C. are widest
in its amplitude; it is obligatory upon the
Court to summon evidence of a material
witness whose evidence is essential for just
decision; the Court exercising power under
section 540, Cr.P.C. has to guard itself from
the exploitation and shall keep the guiding
principle, what the ends of justice demands;
the avoidance to fill gaps is in negation of
justice, when a Court arrives at the
conclusion that evidence is essential for a

Tajamul/Cs* 5.8: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

just decision, and, that the delay in moving
an application is not relevant as the Court
itself is empowered, even, without
application from any of the parties to
summon the witness deemed essential for
just decision by applying its judicial mind.

7. Powers of the Court under Section 540 CrPC

were discussed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the
case of Sajid Mehmood vs. The State (2022 SCMR

1882) and it was held that:

This section is divisible in two parts. In the
first part, discretion is given to the Court
and enables it at any stage of an inquiry,
trial or other proceedings under the Code, (a)
to summon anyone as a witness, or (b) to
examine any person present in the Court, or
(c) to recall and re-examine any person
whose evidence had already been recorded.
On the other hand, the second part appears
to be mandatory and requires the Court to
take any of the steps mentioned above if the
new evidence appears to it essential to the
just decision of the case. The object of the
provision, as a whole, is to do justice not
only from the point of view of the accused
and the prosecution but also justice from the
point of view of the society. The Court
examines evidence under this _ section
neither to help the prosecution nor to help
the accused. It is done neither to fill up any
gaps in the prosecution evidence nor to give
it any unfair advantage against the accused.
Fundamental thing to be seen is whether the
Court considers this evidence necessary in
the facts and circumstances of the particular
case before it. If this results in only "filling
of lacuna" that is purely a subsidiary factor
and cannot be taken into consideration.
There is no bar that a witness, whose
statement under section 161, Cr.P.C. had
not been recorded at the time of
investigation, cannot be allowed to examine
under section 540, Cr.P.C.

Moreover, the role of the Court under section
540 Cr.P.C has been particularized by the apex Court

in the case where the prosecution has dropped material

Tapmui/cs-| SB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar
witness from being examined, in the case of Chairman,

NAB vs. Muhammad Usman and others (PLD 2018

SC 28) when it was observed that:

There may be very rare and exceptional
cases, where, the prosecution has dropped
any material witness whose evidence, if
given, may have a direct bearing on the end
result of the case, in that event, the Court is
blessed with unfettered powers to summon
and examine such witness only for the
purpose of discovery of truth, for the
purpose of doing complete justice however,
such powers are not to be exercised at
random and without application of proper
judicial mind with reasonable depth to the
facts of each case. Unmistakenly, in view of
the provision of section 540, Cr.P.C. the
witnesses are examined as ‘court witnesses'
and not for prosecution or defence,
therefore, none of the parties to a case can
claim such a right. These powers shall only
be exercised to put justice into correct
channels.

This Court in the case of Zeshan_vs.

Manzoor Aman and another (2017 P.Cr.L.J_294) has

held that the Court can summon a material witness
even if his/her name does not appear in the column of
witnesses of the challan, provided his/her evidence is
deemed essential by the Trial Court for the right
decision of the case. The power under section 540,
Cr.P.C. can be exercised if the Court feels that the
evidence of such a person is essential for the just

decision of the case.

8 In the case before this Court the witness was
neither dropped nor examined by the prosecution but

in view of similarity in the names of HC Hayat Ullah

Tajamul/cs* 5.B: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
No.641 and FC Hayat Khan No. 797 the former was
dropped in view of the statement of other marginal
witness of the recovery memorandum however, the
later was not examined whose statement is essential for
just decision of the case. Thus, viewing the entire
factual and legal aspect, in the light of precedents of
the apex Court and of this Court, as expounded above,
while exercising the power under section 540 Cr.P.C
this appeal is allowed consequently, the impugned
judgment is set aside and the case is remitted back to
learned trial Court with directions to summon PW
Hayat Khan No. 797, the carrier of the parcels
containing the samples to FSL, and record his
statement as prosecution witness by affording
opportunity to defence counsel for his cross-
examination. The learned trial Court shall thereafter re-
examine the appellant under Section 342, Cr.P.C. and
decide the case in accordance with law positively within
a period of one month. The parties are directed to
appear before the learned trial Court on 23.05.2024.
Needless to mention that during this period the

appellant shall be treated as under-trial prisoner.
