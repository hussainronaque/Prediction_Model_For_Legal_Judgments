JUDGMENT
Dr. Khurshid Iqbal, J.-
Ll. Appellant/convict Mustansar Ahmad faced
regular trial for the offence u/s 302/34 PPC in case FIR
No. 137 dated 14.05.2016 of P.S Booni, District Upper
Chitral, on the charge of committing murder of Bahadar
Ullah. On conclusion of trial, learned Additional Sessions
Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi/Judge Juvenile Court, Upper Chitral
(Trial Court) convicted him u/s 302(b) PPC and sentenced
him to undergo life imprisonment. He was also burdened for
payment of Rs.300,000/- to legal heirs of the deceased as
compensation in terms of section 544-A, Cr.P.C, in default
whereof he was directed to undergo further six months S.I.
2. Brief facts of the case are that on 30.03.2015,
THC Siraj Wali (PW-6) of P.S Booni received information

regarding existence of certain articles/belongings of some

“DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’bls Mc, Justice Br, Khurshid Igbat
-2-
unknown person in middle of Ghalshat bridge having been

lifted by Munir Hussain. For confirmation and legal action,
he proceeded to the spot where complainant Munir Hussain
(PW-23) made a report to him stating that on the previous
day i.e 29.03.2015 at 04:30 hours, his brother Bahadar Ullah
(deceased) had left at his shop in Koragh in his personal
vehicle. During night at about 10:00 P.M, someone knocked
at the door of his house, when he came out, he found Inayat
Ullah (PW-2), Najeeb Ullah (PW-2, 20) and Faisal (PW-13)
at the door who informed him that his brother Bahadar Ullah
had parked his vehicle due to some fault at Karak while he
himself was missing. They further informed him that they
had brought the vehicle and parked the same in a garage.
Consequent upon receipt of the above information, he left
his village Charoon for Koragh and asked about Amir Ali
(PW-5) who had informed the above named PWs regarding
the fault in vehicle of his brother, however, he could not be
traced out, therefore, he returned to his village. Complainant
further informed the police that he was under the impression
that his brother, due to fault in his vehicle, would have
stayed overnight with a friend. However, he left his house at
morning on the same day i.e. 30.03.2015, and started search
for his brother during which he attempted % times to contact
him through his cell phone in response whereof an unknown

person attended the call who, on his query, introduced

DB: ~ Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar om
Hon'ble Mr, justice Dy, Khurshid tobal
-3-
himself as Sanaullah (PW-15) son of Abdur Rahim who

informed him that cell phone with CNIC, purse, socks, boots
and coat of Bahadar Ullah were lying in center of Ghalshat
bridge. Hence, he went to the mentioned place and carried
belongings of his brother to his house after taking the same
into his possession. Complainant, however, expressed no
suspicion or allegation against anyone.

3. Inquiry in the matter u/s 156, Cr.P.C was
initiated by local police during which complainant recorded
his statement u/s 164, Cr.P.C on 14.05.2016 wherein he
charged the present appellant/convict Mustansar Ahmad and
his accused Saif-ud-Din son of Yurmas Baig for murder of
his brother. They were arrested the same day i.e 14.05.2016.
During investigation, the appellant/convict recorded his
confessional statement on 16.05.2016 before the Judicial
Magistrate, Tehsil Booni which is available on record as
Ex.PW-26/3. After completion of investigation, challan was
submitted before the Juvenile Court for trial of the appellant
being below the age of 18 years. Formal charge was framed
against him to which he did not plead guilty and opted to
face trial.

4. In order to further substantiate its case against the
appellant, prosecution examined as many as 26 out of 46
PWs listed in the calendar of witnesses and closed the

evidence. When examined u/s 342, Cr.P.C, appellant

” "pa: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
-4-

professed innocence by stating that he has been charged in a
false case. Though he did not produce any witness in his
defence, however, opted to be examined on oath in terms of
section 340(2), Cr.P.C which was recorded accordingly as
DW-1. On conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court
convicted him u/s 302(b) PPC vide impugned judgment and
sentenced him in the manner already mentioned in detail in
the earlier portion of this judgment. Through this appeal, he
has challenged his conviction and sentence.

5. We have paid our anxious consideration to the
arguments of learned counsel for the parties including the
learned A.A.G representing the State and perused the record

with their able assistance.

6. The occurrence has taken place on 29.03.2015 at
unknown time, as such, the same has remained un-
witnessed. The only evidence prosecution has relied upon is
the judicial confession of the appellant/convict. Several
points raised during arguments need resolution by this
Court. First and the foremost is the confession recorded by
appellant/convict who was juvenile at the time of the
occurrence. Since, in the present case, the appellant convict
has been tried as juvenile accused, therefore, that aspect of
the case is required to be looked into in light of the settled
principles and attending circumstances of the case.

Secondly, it is to be seen whether the Judicial Magistrate has

DB: _Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
‘t F, t

-5-

fulfilled the legal requirements while recording confession
of the juvenile accused in light whereof it is to be decided as
to whether it was a true, cogent, voluntary and confidence
inspiring confession or otherwise. Thirdly, the confession is
required to be adjudged in light of corroborative evidence on
record and lastly whether the learned trial Court was
justified in recording conviction of the appellant solely on
the basis of his confession especially when the same was

retracted by him.

Coming to the first point, i.e., juvenility of the
appellant/convict and as such the evidentiary value of his
Judicial confession. The card of arrest of the
appellant/convict shows that when he was arrested on
14.05.2016, alongwith his physical features his date of birth
was mentioned as 01.04.2000. A certificate (Ex.PW-10/2) in
this regard issued by the Principal Islamia Model School
Kosht, Chitral, showing his date of birth as 1 April, 2000,
was taken into possession through a recovery memo while
certificate of NADRA and birth certificate issued by
Government of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa available on record
also disclose same date of birth of the petitioner. Even
amongst the PWs, Munir Hussain (PW-23), brother of the
deceased, admitted that appellant/convict was a minor at the
time of the occurrence. In view of evidence collected by the

1.0 and opinion of DPP, separate challan under the Juvenile

“DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Or. Khurshid tabal
-6-
@ Justice System Ordinance, 2000, was submitted against the

appellant/convict for his trial, as such, separate record was
maintained by the learned trial Court. Though prosecution
had once objected to juvenility of the appellant/convict by
submitting an application before the learned trial Court for
determination of his age, however, that application was
dismissed vide order dated 27.10.2016 which has attained
finality as the said order has not been challenged by
prosecution. Thus, being a juvenile at the time of the
occurrence, the trial of the appellant/convict under the
Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000, has been

conducted in accordance with law.

Zz The next two points with regard to fulfillment or

otherwise of the legal formalities by Judicial Magistrate

before recording confession of the appellant/convict being a

Zz juvenile accused are discussed together. The questionnaire
put before the appellant/ convict comprised of as many as

Le seven questions. They relate to the introduction of the
Judicial Magistrate; the information that appellant/ convict

was not bound to make a confessional statement and, if

preferred, to be used against him as evidence; the fact that

he had the knowledge of the fact that after recording of

. confessional statement, he would not be handed back to

‘ police and would be sent to judicial lockup; that whether he

was subjected to torture or threatened or forced or induced

DB: Hor’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Dr, Khurshid labat
-7-

and promised to make a confession; the time that he spent in
police custody and whether his confession should be
recorded. He tendered ‘yes’ replies to the introduction of
Judicial Magistrate; that he was not bound to make a
confession; that in case of his refusal to confess his guilt he
will not be sent back to police custody and that his
confession should be recorded. He tendered negative reply
to the question pertaining to torture, threat, force,
inducement and promise. He tendered “yes” relies to all
questions except the one pertaining to torture etc. to which
he replied in the negative. No doubt, at the time of recording
confession of the appellant, his birth certificate was not
before the Judicial Magistrate. However, age of the
appellant/ convict had already been mentioned as 16/17
years in his card of arrest. When asked whether he had
satisfied himself that the appellant/convict was a juvenile,
the Judicial Magistrate replied that:
Si Se oh Eb ney ten£ Sule tie
SVAN en eaeircad

The Judicial Magistrate was required to have
taken extra care and caution before recording confession of
the appellant in view of his juvenility. A student of 9" class,
as he was, but also hailing from as far flung and

mountainous area of the province cannot be expected to

DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
-8-

know the significance of making confession before the
Court, therefore, he should have been provided the
opportunity of counseling and consultation of a lawyer or
guardian. Such an opportunity was declined to him. A close
scrutiny of the questionnaire would show that it missed
certain other questions of fundamental importance, such, as
an opportunity to consult a lawyer and that why he preferred
to confess his guilt. It was observed by august Supreme
Court in the case of “Hashim Qasim and another Vs. The
State” (2017 SCMR 986) that being a juvenile (minor), it
was appropriate and desirable that the accused should have
been provided counseling/consultation facility of natural
guardian or any close blood relative of mature age, having
no clash of interest with him. The questionnaire as well
certificate of the Judicial Magistrate do not bear any
description regarding provision of an opportunity to
appellant/convict for counseling and consultation. The
purpose behind giving such opportunity to a juvenile
accused is that by doing so the Judicial Magistrate could
ascertain that whatever the appellant/convict intended to
disclose before the Court were his own narrations and that
he had not been tutored before recording the confession.
Since, the learned Judicial Magistrate has provided no such

opportunity to appellant/convict, therefore, the possibility of

08: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, justice Or. Khurshid labs!
-9-

his having been tutored before recording the confession

cannot be ruled out in the circumstances.

8. When the appellant/convict was arrested on
14.05.2016, he was produced before the Judicial Magistrate

on 15.05.2016 with a request for police custody for the

. purpose of interrogation. The Judicial Magistrate allowed 05
| days police custody, directing the 1.0 to produce him again

on 19.05.2016. The I.O produced the appellant/convict
| before the Judicial Magistrate on 16.05.2016 for recording

his confessional statement. Not only the confession was

recorded while he still remained in police custody, for two

, days, but he has also stated in his confessional statement that

police had called him time and again for the purpose of

: interrogation for two months. There is nothing on the record

to show that Judicial Magistrate had physically examined
the appellant for ascertaining the fact that he was not
tortured by police before his production for the purpose of

recording his confession. He also admitted that in his

' certificate he had made no observation to the effect that the

" appellant/convict was physically and mentally in proper

health. The Judicial Magistrate also stated under his cross-

examination that:

Pokulubukidl erie te le pe tlewny
ree feu

DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Or, Khurshid {aba
-10-
The certificate the Judicial Magistrate signed on

16.05.2016 shows that the appellant/convict was produced
before him at 11:30 hours. The certificate further shows that
the proceedings of recording of judicial confession were
completed at 02:00 P.M but he was produced before the
) Medical Officer, the same day (i.e 16.05.2016) for his
‘ medical examination who noted the time of his examination
:; as 02:47 P.M, about 47 minutes after recording of his
. confession. As a natural corollary of this state of affairs, it is
absolutely established that the appellant/convict had not
been produced before the Medical Officer for his medical
examination before his production before the Judicial
Magistrate and this fact alone is sufficient to disbelieve the
_ judicial confession made by appellant/convict. Similarly,
keeping in view the fact that a school going boy, when
| police kept calling him to the police station for two months
‘from time to time for the purpose of interrogation in a
: murder case and thereafter kept him in police station for two
days, it cannot be presumed that he had volunteered to utter
the whole truth without any pressure, torture, threat, promise

or inducement by police.

9. The certificate appended to the confession does
not show where the appellant/convict was kept by the
Judicial Magistrate during the alleged 60 minutes time given

to him for thinking over his choice to make judicial

DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Or, Khurshid Iabal
-il-

confession. This is clear from the fact that he was called in
the Court at 12:40 P.M. The Judicial Magistrate was
examined as PW-26 at the trial. He deposed in his
examination-in-chief that he recorded the confessional
statement of the appellant/convict in Urdu under his own
handwriting while under cross-examination he was asked as
to who amongst the police officials had produced the
appellant/convict before him and to whom he had handed
back the appellant/convict after recording his confessional
statement, he replied like this.

SI Sultan Khan (PW-12), the Investigating
Officer, when confronted with the same question, plainly
| admitted it as correct that he had produced the
appellant/convict before the Judicial Magistrate for
recording his confessional statement whereafter he was
handed over back to him for his consignment to judicial
lockup. The Judicial Magistrate also could not recollect as to
' where he had kept the appellant/convict during the time of
60 minutes, he had given to him to freely and voluntarily
think over his choice to record his confessional statement. In

this respect, his statement is worth perusal.

It is apparent from the above statements of
Judicial Magistrate and I.O that the appellant/convict was
dealt with carelessly during and after the process of

recording his confession. It cannot be ruled out in the

| mentioned circumstances __ that appellant/convict had

' remained in the company of I.O during the mentioned 60
|
| minutes time, as such, it would be highly unsafe to hold that
_ appellant had recorded a true and voluntary confession. In

| this regard, the august Supreme Court observed in the case

of “Azeem Khan and another Vs. Mujahid Khan and

I

| others” reported as 2016 SCMR 274 that during the process
of recording confessional statement of an accused, at no
occasion he shall be handed over to any police
official/officer whether he is a Naib Court, wearing police
|uniform, or any other police official/officer, because such
careless dispensation would considerably diminish the
‘voluntary nature of the confession, made by the accused.
‘Looking at the judicial confession of appellant/convict in the
[present case with the prism of the judgment of the august
Supreme Court and attending circumstances of the case, we
are of the view that the confession so recorded by

appellant/convict is neither true nor voluntary.

~T "ae: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar

-13-

10. Now we would come to the points with regard to
admissibility of retracted confession in evidence and
corroboration thereof by circumstantial evidence on the
_ record. Though there is a judicial view that conviction may
be recorded solely on confessional statement even if

retracted, as emerging from the case law reported as

_ “Nizam-ud-Din Vs. Riaz and another” (2010 SCMR 457),
“Manjeet Singh Vs. The State” (PLD 2006 S.C 30), “Tarig
Hussain Shah Vs. The State” (2003 SCMR 938), and
' “Muhammad Amjad Vs. The State” (PLD 2008 Lahore
32). However, before relying upon a retracted judicial
confession, the Court must be satisfied that it is fully
established as true, voluntary, cogent, confidence inspiring
and corroborated by other circumstantial evidence. We have
; already held that confession of the appellant/convict was
| neither true nor voluntary. For resolution of the question
whether the confession is cogent, confidence inspiring and
gets corroboration from evidence on record, in this regard
the evidence brought on record during investigation needs
reappraisal. It is the version of the prosecution that the
: complainant, while searching the deceased who was
missing, was informed by Sanaullah (PW-15) through his
cell phone that belongings of the deceased i.e boots, coat,
mobile phone, registration of vehicle and NIC/domicile were

lying in middle of Ghalshat bridge, as such, complainant

oR Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Or, Khurshid tabal
\

-14-

went there, collected the articles and took the same to his
house. The appellant/convict, in his judicial confession,
stated that after hitting the deceased on his head with a
stone, he fell on the ground with little bleeding from his
wound and after vomiting he died; that after removing his
shoes and taking out his mobile and other things from his
pocket, he dragged him from his arms, lifted him on his back
and threw him into the river. Admittedly, the mentioned
articles have not been recovered on pointation of the
appellant/convict and except confession, there is no other
reliable evidence on the record to establish that the
appellant/convict had kept the articles on the bridge. Not
only the detail of belongings so found on the bridge does not
tally with the articles mentioned in the confession but the
PWs also do not support each other in this regard. Sanaullah
(PW-15) deposed that he came to the bridge and found the
articles. He noticed that mobile phone of the deceased was
ringing which he attended and informed the complainant
regarding belongings of the deceased accordingly. Statement
of this witness suggests that he had approached to the bridge
alone as he has not disclosed the name of any other person
accompanying him at the relevant time, but PW-19
(Mushtaq Khan) has claimed that he had found the articles
while coming to the bridge in the company of PW

Sanaullah. Statements of both the PWs do not appear natural

“pe: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Me Justice Or, Khurshid taba!
-|5-

and spontaneous otherwise they would have confirmed
presence of each other on the bridge. In this situation, no
inference could be drawn other than that the story with
regard to articles of the deceased was cooked up and put into
the mouth of appellant/ convict which he narrated in his
confession, as such, a case was prepared against him that he
had done so to make the people believe that deceased had
committed suicide. It is in the evidence of PWs that
deceased was a stout young person, therefore, his murder by
appellant/convict, a school going boy, in the mentioned
mode and manner is repellent to reason. Even otherwise, the
story emerging from the confessional statement also does
not appeal to prudent mind because after committing murder
of deceased, it cannot be expected from the appellant/
convict being a juvenile to retain belongings of the deceased
in such a tense situation for making a plan for showing the
occurrence as suicide instead of homicide. The learned trial
Court has also relied upon the statements of PWs especially
that of Amir Ali (PW-5) regarding last seen evidence. From
scrutiny of the statements of the PWs, it has become clear
that the last seen evidence originates from co-accused Saif-
ud-Din as, except him, no other witness has claimed to have
seen the deceased in the company of appellant/convict.
Regarding last seen evidence, it is settled principle of law as

held by the august Supreme Court in the case of “Altaf

DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
bh f
\

-16-
Hussain Vs. Fakhar Hussain and another” (2008 SCMR

1103) that the last seen evidence is a weak type of evidence
unless corroborated with some other piece of evidence. In
the present case, the last seen evidence by itself is based on
hearsay evidence as the PWs who deposed in this regard
have categorically stated that they had heard from co-
accused Saif-ud-Din that he had left the deceased and
appellant/convict together at Karak after accident to the
vehicle of deceased while he himself had come to the house
of PW Amir Ali for taking the damaged vehicle of the
deceased from the spot of accident. Thus, statements of the
PWs qua the last seen evidence are nothing more than
hearsay evidence and cannot be made basis of a conviction.
Reference is made to “Sajjan Solangi Vs. The State” (2019
SCMR 872). It is strange enough that deceased himself took
no pain to do something from carrying his own damaged
vehicle from the place where they had met the alleged
accident rather that trouble was taken by another person on
his behalf. It is also astonishing that the deceased and his
companion co-accused Saif-ud-Din had the option at the
relevant time to call Amir Ali through a phone call from his
house but instead Saif-ud-Din preferred to go to his house in
person. This conduct is against the normal human behavior
because in case of emergency people naturally follow the

easier way and not a tough and time consuming one. So far

te Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nagem Anwar,
Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Dr, Khurshid jabs}
-17-
the statement of co-accused u/s 164, Cr-P.C recorded by

co-accused Saif-ud-Din regarding the last seen evidence, is
concerned, the said statement is exculpatory in nature and
‘ inadmissible in evidence against his co-accused. In this

regard we would refer the judgment of the Privy Council in
| the case of “Ghulam Hussain Vs. The King” (1949 Privy

_ Council 326) wherein it was observed that:

(a) Criminal Procedure Code (V of 1898), S. 164-Accused's
statement under, not amounting to confession-Held,
inadmissible against co-accused though admissible against
himself-Evidence Act (1 of 1872), Ss. 18 to 21.

When awaiting trial Fatehsing intimated that he wished to
make a confession. Consequently, he was taken before a
Magistrate and after the formalities required by section 164
of the Code of Criminal Procedure had been carried out, he
made a statement, but it was not a confession. Although
incriminating, it was intended to be exculpatory of himself.
Its importance was that it constituted an admission by
Fatehsing that on the day of the rape Jasoda came to the
house and while she was upstairs with the appellant he acted
as watchman at the gate. Held, that the statement could not
be used in evidence against the appellant (co-accused).

Since, the statement of co-accused does not
qualify the criteria of a judicial confession, therefore, it
‘cannot be taken as corroborative evidence against the
appellant/ convict. Admittedly, the dead body has not been
recovered till date, as such, there is no other evidence on the
record to establish that the deceased had died by sustaining
injury on his head with a blunt object, as such, the fact
emerging from confession with regard to cause of death of
the deceased as result of head injury through blow of stone

is not corroborated by any evidence on the record. Similarly,

oa: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Or. Khurshid tebal
-18-

the appellant/convict was charged in the case after almost
one year of the occurrence, therefore, neither any blood has
been collected from the spot nor is there any evidence to
_ prove any disturbance on the spot which could naturally
occur there in view of the mode and manner of the
_ occurrence set forth by prosecution. Thus, confession of the
appellant is neither cogent nor confidence inspiring nor
_ corroborated by circumstantial evidence on the record.
When so, the retracted confession of the appellant/convict
cannot be relied upon for maintaining his conviction.
Reference is made to “Muhammad Ismail and others Vs.
The State” (2017 SCMR 898). The law laid down by

Hon’ble apex Court in the referred judgment is as under:

The only other piece of evidence remaining in the field was
a judicial confession allegedly made by Muhammad Iqrar,
Khalid Hussain and Shakir Ali appellants before a
Magistrate under section 164, Cr.P.C. but admittedly the
said judicial confession had been retracted by the
appellants before the trial court and in the absence of any
independent corroboration such retracted judicial
confession could not suffice all by itself for recording or
upholding the appellants’ convictions.

il. Another crucial aspect is that the defense raised
the plea that the Judicial Magistrate did not record statement
of the appellant/convict in his own handwriting. On this
score, the learned defense counsel questioned the Judicial
Magistrate but he denied this fact. In support of his plea, the
learned defense counsel placed on record a copy of a

statement in another criminal case as Mark ‘D’ recorded in

DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
-19-
the handwriting of one Muhammad Shah Bailiff of District

Courts Chitrial. He argued that by seeing the handwriting of
the confessional statement of the appellant/convict recorded
_ in Urdu in juxtaposition with the statement Mark ‘D’, both
_ appear to be in the same handwriting. When asked why
. didn’t the defense sought permission of the trial Court to
lead specific evidence on this plea, the learned counsel
| replied that he had moved an application before the learned
‘trial Court for examination of the aforesaid Muhammad
‘Shah, bailiff, as a witness but the same was not allowed.
‘Thus, the defense was left with no option but to simply place
.on file the earlier statement Mark ‘D’ allegedly recorded in
the same handwriting. Since application of the defense for
summoning of Muhammad Shah Bailiff and obtaining his
handwriting for its comparison with the handwriting of
confession has been turned down by learned trial Court vide
order dated 21.09.2021, which has not been challenged by
appellant/convict before any forum, as such, that order has
attained finality, therefore, further discussion of this Court
for deciding whether confession of the appellant/convict had
been recorded by Judicial Magistrate in his own handwriting

or not, is inconsequential.

12. The case of prosecution against the appellant/
convict is suffering from various glaring inconsistencies

creating serious doubts regarding the guilt of appellant while

08: Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr.Justion Dr, Khurshid iat!
-20-

the confession is neither true and voluntary, nor confidence
inspiring nor corroborated by circumstantial evidence on the
record, therefore, cannot be safely relied upon for conviction
of the appellant. It is settled law that a single doubt is
sufficient for acquittal of an accused if found reasonable.
Reliance is placed on “Tariq Pervez v. The State” (1995
SCMR 1345), wherein the august Supreme Court has held

that:

The concept of benefit of doubt to an accused person is
deep-rooted in our country. For giving him benefit of
doubt, it is not necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating doubts. If there is a circumstance
which creates reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about
the guilt of the accused, then the accused will be entitled to
the benefit not as a matter of grace and concession but as a
matter of right.

13. As a sequel to our above discussion, this appeal
is allowed, the impugned judgment is set aside and appellant
Mustansar Ahmad is acquitted of the charge leveled against
him by prosecution. He be released forthwith from jail if not

required in any other case.

14, Above are the reasons of our short order of the

even date.
