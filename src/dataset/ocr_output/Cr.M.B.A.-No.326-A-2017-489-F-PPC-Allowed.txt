SYED MUHAMMAD ATTIQUE SHAH, _J.-

Accused-petitioner seeks his post arrest bail in case
FIR No.274 dated 17.04.2017 under section 489-F of
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 registered at Police Station
Cantt., Abbottabad.

2. The allegation against the accused/
petitioner is that he has issued a cheque amounting to
Rs.4,400,000/- to the complainant/respondent No.2 in
connection with bargain of two vehicles, which was
dishonoured on presentation in the concerned bank

due to insufficient funds in his account.
3. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
accused/petitioner and learned State counsel heard
and record perused.

4. Perusal of record reveals that the cheque
in question was issued by the accused/petitioner in
connection with bargain of vehicles allegedly
purchased by him from the complainant. However, at
the moment there is nothing on record to suggest that
any such transaction took place between the parties, as
no documentary proof has been brought on record by
the complainant despite direction by the Investigating
Officer, which prima facie calls for further inquiry
into the matter. Although the learned counsel for the
complainant and the learned AAG have placed much
emphasized over the conduct of the accused/petitioner
as in the past as well, cases of similar nature has been
registered against him but the accused/petitioner has
been acquitted in four of the said cases, while two
other cases which includes the present case have been
recently registered on the report of the complainant
and he has to prove the criminal culpability of the
accused/petitioner regarding his dishonestly issuing
cheques during the trial of the case. Moreover, the
offence does not fall within the prohibitory clause of

section 497 Cr.P.C, as the maximum sentence under
section 489-F PPC is three years. In Zafar Iqbal’s
case (2009 SCMR 1488), a larger Bench of the
august Apex Court has explicitly expressed the
principles for considering the grant of bail, where
offences do not fall within the prohibitory clause of
section 497 Cr.P.C. The said principles have
consistently been followed by the Honourable
Supreme Court, as it has been held in Riaz Jafar

Natiq’s case (2011 SCMR 1708) that:

“Thus keeping in view the law laid down in
the case of Zafar Iqbal v. Muhammad Anwar
and others (2009 SCMR 1488) ordaining that
where a case falls within non-prohibitory
clause the concession of granting bail must
be favourably considered and should only be
declined in exceptional cases. We do not find
this to be a case where it should be refused as
an exception. Thus, this petition is converted
into an appeal and the same is allowed and,
resultantly, the petitioner is admitted to bail
subject to furnishing bail bond in the sum of
Rs. 1,00,000 (Rupees one hundred thousand
only) with two sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of the learned trial
Court.”

5. In any case, investigation in the
present case is complete and the accused/petitioner
is not required to the police for the purpose of
further investigation. In peculiar facts and
circumstances of the present case, no useful
purpose is going to be served by keeping him

behind the bars.
6. Consequently, this bail application is
accepted and accused-petitioner, Zakir Qureshi son of
Muhammad Zaman is admitted to bail, subject to his
furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.100,000/-
(Rupees one lac), with two sureties, each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of the J/laqa/Duty
Magistrate, Abbottabad.

Above are the detailed reasons for short
order of this Court of even date.
7. The observations rendered hereinabove,
would not affect the mind of the trial Court in any

manner whatsoever, during trial of the case.
