QALANDAR ALI KHAN,J:- This
revision petition by Khanzeb, petitioner,
calls in question judgment and decree of
the learned Additional District Judge-VII,
Abbottabad in Appeal No.22/13 dated
20.10.2011, whereby judgment = and
decree of the learned trial Court/Civil
Judge-XII, Abbottabad dated 25.11.2010
was upheld/maintained. The petitioner
prayed for acceptance of the revision
petition and setting aside the judgment
and decree of both the Trial as well as

appellate Courts.
2. The facts leading to the instant
revision petition, briefly stated, are that
the petitioner had lodged a suit for
declaration and_ perpetual injunction
thereby challenging notice dated
19.08.2000 requiring him to remove
encroachment on Cantonment Board path
on the ground that he had constructed his
residential house on Khasra_ No.2146
situated in Sheikh-ul-Bandi after securing
approval of construction plan from
Cantonment Board and had made no
encroachment upon Khasra No.2151/1, as
alleged in the impugned notice. Moreover,
respondents/defendants were not owners
in possession of Khasra No.2151/1 which
was ‘Shamilat-deh’ and
petitioner/plaintiff was one of the co-
owners.

3. In his plaint, the
petitioner/plaintiff further averred that at
the behest of some interested persons, the

Cantonment Board Authorities had served
him with notice for removal = of
encroachment on the said Khasra number,
therefore, he had lodged suit in the Civil
Court, but due to some formal defect the
suit was withdrawn with permission to file
fresh suit, hence the subsequent suit on
the plea that the petitioner/plaintiff had
raised construction on his own
property/land after approval of the plan by
the concerned’ authorities in the
Cantonment Board and that claim of the
respondents/defendants that the
petitioner/plaintiff had encroached upon
the path of the Cantonment Board was
totally wrong and baseless as_ neither
Khasra No.2151/1 was acquired nor any
demarcation of the said khasra number
had taken place so as to justify the notice
for removal of alleged encroachment on
the said property.

4. The suit was_ resisted by
respondents/defendants who submitted

their separate written statements, wherein
they contended that though construction
plan of the _ petitioner/plaintiff was
approved ffor raising construction on
Khasra No.2146 but the petitioner/plaintiff
had encroached upon Khasra No.2151/1,
which was Cantonment path, therefore, on
the complaint of local inhabitants
regarding blockage of the path by the
petitioner/plaintiff, which was_ verified
through revenue officials, the
petitioner/plaintiff and other persons who
had encroached upon the cantonment
path, according to the demarcation carried
out by revenue officials, were served with
notice for removal of encroachment.

5. The pleadings of the parties
were reduced to as many as 9 issues,
where after the parties led their respective
evidence, and the learned trial Court/Civil
Judge-xII, Abbottabad, eventually
dismissed the suit vide judgment and
decree dated 25.11.2010. Aggrieved of the

order of the learned trial Court, the
petitioner preferred appeal, which, too,
met the same fate, and was dismissed by
the learned appellate Court/Additional
District Judge-VII, Abbottabad vide the
impugned judgment dated 20.10.2011;
hence this revision petition, inter alia, on
the grounds that the respondents were
neither owners nor occupiers of the suit
Khasra number, therefore, the impugned
notice was baseless and issued with
malafide intention at the behest of
respondent No.4. The petitioner also
questioned the entries in favour of
respondents regarding suit khasra number
in the revenue record, and stressed that
the impugned judgments without spot
investigation had no basis at all. The
petitioner claimed that report of the
Girdawar, Imdad Hussain, was over
locked, which rendered the impugned
judgments void, wrong and against the

principles of natural justice.
6. Arguments of learned counsel
for the petitioner, standing counsel for
Cantonment Board/respondents No.1 to
3 and learned counsel for private
respondent No.4 heard, and _ record
perused.

7. Admittedly, this is a_ suit
against Cantonment Board, and Section
273 of the Cantonment Act 1924,
specifically bars a suit instituted against
a Cantonment Board for “any act done,
or purporting to have been done, in
pursuance of the Act or any Rule or bye
law made there under, until the
expiration of two months after notice in
writing has been left at the office of the
Board”, stating therein “explicitly the
cause of action, the nature of the relief
sought” etc and further the plaint shall
contain “a statement that such notice
has been so delivered or left”. In other
words, delivery of requisite notice
containing the aforementioned details is
a sine-qua-non for institution of a suit
against a Cantonment Board under the
above referred section of law; and a
suit for declaration even with prayer of
injunction as ancillary relief, unless

declaratory relief is dropped and suit is
confined to relief of injunction only,
would not be maintainable in the light
of judgment in the case of Haji Abdus
Sattar Kotriwalla Vs. The
Cantonment Board Hyderabad and
another reported as 1988 CLC 1182
(Karachi).

8. The record would show that
though a vague reference to the
requisite notice has been made in Para
No.6 of both the original and amended
plaints, but, let alone proof of leaving
the notice at the office of Cantonment
Board, even the notice has not been
placed on record/file so as to make suit
against Cantonment Board maintainable
under the above referred mandatory
provision of law. Therefore, suit of the
plaintiff was even otherwise liable to be
dismissal on this score alone.

9. On merits too, the suit was
not sustainable, as negative declaration
was sought to the effect that the
Cantonment Board had _ no_ right,
whatsoever, in respect of the suit
khasra number, but the record, right
from the settlement in the year 1904-
05, showing the suit khasra number as

a path, proved otherwise, and the
petitioners/plaintiff was unable to prove
to the contrary and establish on record
that long standing entries in the
revenue record did not reflect situation
on ground, notwithstanding the fact
that a suit in the year 2001 challenging
therein long and consistent entries in
the revenue record only after receipt of
notice for removal of encroachment was
even otherwise hopelessly time barred.

10. Even the report of Imdad
Hussain, former Girdawar (PW.3) re-
inforced the fact that a path existed all
along in the revenue record since 1905-
1906, despite reporting that path was
no more in existence on ground, which
fact was taken into consideration by
both the Courts below and it was held
by the learned appellate
Court/Additional District Judge-VII,
Abbottabad, in his impugned judgment,
that after the path was encroached
upon and included in the house of the
petitioner/plaintiff, it was but natural
that the path no longer existed and that
the said witness obviously, could not
find a path during his visit to the spot.
The close relationship of the said Imdad

Hussain with petitioner/plaintiff
notwithstanding, even he could not
come to the rescue of petitioner/plaintiff
in view of the overwhelming revenue
record, together with statements of
DWs, showing existence of the path for
more than a century.

11. In the circumstances, when
existence of path prior to encroachment
thereon by the petitioner and three
other persons mentioned in the
impugned notice is abundantly proved
not only from the record but also
through other supporting evidence, and
encroachment thereon was also evident
from the fact that path no _ longer
existed after the same was encroached
upon and made part of the construction
raised by the petitioner and the other
three persons mentioned in the
impugned notice, the Cantonment
Board, to which the path
unquestionably belonged, was. well
within its right to serve the petitioner
with notice for removal of
encroachment in the light of
demarcation of revenue staff. The suit
was, as such, bereft of merit and was
rightly dismissed by the trial Court and

the order of dismissal maintained by the
10

appellate Court, which are not open to
exception, being based on_ proper
appreciation of evidence and sound
reasoning. The revision petition, is,

therefore, dismissed with costs.
