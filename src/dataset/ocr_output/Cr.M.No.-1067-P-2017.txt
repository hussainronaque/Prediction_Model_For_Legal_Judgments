Date of hearing: 30.6.2017

Petitioner: (Yasir) by Mr. Hizar Hayat Daudzai, Advocate.

Respondent: (The State and another) by M/s Syed Qaiser
Ali Shah AAG & Astaghfirullah, Advocate.

WAQAR AHMAD SETH, J.- Petitioner, Yasir son of
Munir Khattak, who is involved in case FIR No. 235 dated
28.4.2014 under Section 302 PPC registered at Police
Station Tehkal, Peshawar, was not released on bail on
medical ground and postponed his trial under Section 465
Cr.P.C. by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-XII,
Peshawar vide order dated 15.5.2017 being incapable of
making his defence. Now he has approached this Court for
the same purpose.

2. Charge against the petitioner is that he
committed the murder of his aunt Mst. Saba Khan.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. Before going into record of the case, first I

would like to reproduce the report of Standing Medical
Board, who examined the accused-petitioner on 4.8.2016,
which reads as under:-

“The Standing Medical Board
comprising the following members
assembled in the office of the Medical
Superintendent Police/Services,
Hospital, Peshawar to examine Accused
Yasir S/O Muhammad Munir Khattak.

The Standing Medical Board is
of the opinion that the accused has a
prolonged history of chronic psychiatric
illness which is schizoaffective in
nature. He has already been treated in
different Government _ Psychiatric
facilities of the province.

The accused remained under
observation in detention Unit central
prison Peshawar. The accused remains
quallersome, impulsive, unpredictable,
at times whispering and talking to self
exhibiting hallucinatory behaviour. At
times he is not cooperative, refuses to
eat and cannot be kept in other jail
barracks.

The Standing Medical Board is
therefore finally of the opinion that the
accused still suffers from schizoaffective
illness which is a major mental illness.
At the moment due to potential risk of
dangerousness, he needs treatment in a
secure unit like detention unit of
Central Prison Peshawar. He needs
antipsychotic medication and mood
stabilizer drugs under supervision of
Psychiatrist and paramedical staff of the
Prison and Sarhad Hospital Peshawar.
His mental state will be reviewed by
Psychiatrist periodically and will be
recorded. The Board would review him
after one year. At_the_moment,_the
accused does not understand the nature

of his crime, its consequences and court
proceedings therefore; _he_is_unfit to

plead in the court of law.
The jail paramedical staff may

be directed to make sure that the
accused is on regular medication. The
jail staff needs to make sure that rest of

the jail inmates are secure due to

potential risk of dangerousness”.
5. The report of Standing Medical Board would
reveal that the accused-petitioner has a prolonged history of
chronic psychiatric illness, which is schizoaffective in
nature, and he needs treatment. However, at the moment,
the accused-petitioner does not understand the nature of his
crime. After examining, the accused-petitioner moved bail
application before the learned trial Court on medical
ground but the same was refused vide order dated
4.11.2016 and thereafter, he approached this Court for the
said purpose, which too, was refused with direction to the
learned trial Court to initiate proceedings under Sections
464/465/466 Cr.P.C. vide order dated 16.12.2016. In
compliance thereof, the learned trial Court summoned Dr.
Muhammad Idress Associate Professor Psychiatry Khyber
Teaching Hospital, Peshawar and Dr. Muhammad Tariq
Psychiatrist Govt. Sarhad Hospital, Peshawar being
members of Standing Medical Board, who examined the
accused-petitioner on 4.8.2016. Both the doctors appeared
before the Court and recorded their statements as CW-1 &
CW-2 wherein they confirmed that the accused-petitioner is
suffering from schizoaffective disorder for the last 7/8
years, which is a major mental illness and needs proper

treatment but inspite of that, the learned trial Court did not
release him on bail and postpone his trial under Section 465
Cr.P.C. till the curement of his disease. Section 466 Cr.P.C.
says that:

“Release of lunatic pending
investigation or trial. (1) Whenever an
accused person is found to be of
unsound mind and incapable of
making his defence, the Magistrate or
Court, as the case may be, whether the
case is one in which bail may be taken
or not, may release him on sufficient
security being given that he shall be
properly taken care of and shall be
prevented from doing injury to himself
or to any other person, and for his
appearance when required before the
Magistrate or Court or such officer as
the Magistrate or Court appoints in
this behalf.

(2) Custody of Lunatic.—If the
case is one in which, in the opinion of
the Magistrate or Court, bail should
not be taken, or if sufficient security is
not given, the Magistrate or Court, as
the case may be, shall order the
accused to be detained in safe custody
in such place and manner as he or it
may think fit and shall report the
action taken to the Provincial
Government:

Provided that no order for the
detention of the accused in a lunatic
asylum shall be made otherwise than
in accordance with such rules as the
Provincial Government may have
made under the Lunacy Act, 1912”.

When the learned trial Court, after initiating
proceedings under Sections 464/465/466 Cr.P.C., realized
that the accused-petitioner is incapable of making his
defence then for what purpose, he should be kept in jail for

indefinite period although section 466 Cr.P.C. is clear on
the subject, thus, the denial of such a relief to the accused-
petitioner is against the universal principle of justice. It is
the rock bed principle of justice that “let the heaven fall but
justice shall prevail”. In such like matters allowing the
public policy to make way by entering into the portals of
justice then the majesty of law shall run out through the
back door. It is the hallmark, distinctive as well as
exclusive quality of a Judge to be firm and stern in the
matter of doing justice and at no occasion shall permit
exterior elements of whatever influence, menace and
mischief to deter it from doing justice hence, the denial of
relief to the petitioner by the learned trial Court on medical
ground and such fact was also admitted by the both the
doctors in their statements, so recorded, is in disregard of
the well-settled principle of law and justice.

6. According to Article 4 of the Constitution of
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, it is indefeasible right
of every individual within the State to enjoy the protection
of law and to be treated in accordance with law. No action
with regard to the life, liberty body, reputation or property
of any person shall be taken except in accordance with law.
Again under Article 9 of the Constitution, it is the foremost
responsibility of the State to protect the life and liberty of
every person residing its territory. This obligatory duty

pertains to the realm of law enforcing agencies and the
Courts have a very little concern with that area allotted to
these agencies.

7. If a Court of law succumb to pressure tactics
or fear of threat at the hands of certain elements or a
segment of the society and on that account denies justice to
any person who is entitled to it as of right would not be
conducive for the System of Justice, the Judges would fall
prey and become hostages in the hands of those who have
no knowledge about the principle of justice. Such an
approach and attitude would definitely prove destructive for
the fair administration of justice in which the people of the
country still have unshaken faith and confidence. True that
Judges must know about the prevailing circumstances in
the society but for the purpose of evolution and
development of justice system. In my humbly opinion, the
learned trial Court was not right in refusing the grant of bail
to the petitioner on medical ground, despite the fact that
both the doctors have admitted that he is suffering from
schizoaffective being chronic and severe mental illness, and
he needs proper medication. Since the accused-petitioner is
suffering from mental disorder and incapable of making his
defence, therefore, his case is squarely covered under
Section 466 read with Section 497 Cr.P.C.

8. In view of the above, this bail application is

accepted and the accused-petitioner is admitted to bail
provided he furnishes bail bond in the sum of Rs. 700,000/-
(Rs. Seven lacs) with two sureties each in the like amount
to the satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate, who
shall ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men of
means.

9. Before parting with the judgment/order, I
must observe that the accused-petitioner shall be properly
taken care of and he shall be managed and controlled in a
manner so that he is prevented from doing/causing injury to
himself or any other person. He shall be preferably
admitted in the hospital for management and treatment
under the control and supervision of Psychiatric for his
rehabilitation. The Director General Health, Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar is directed to constitute a Medical
Board for the purpose, who shall examine the accused-
petitioner once in a month and submit its report to the
learned trial Court and when the Standing Medical Board
found the accused-petitioner that he is capable of making

his defence, then his trial be restored.

10. Above are the reasons of my short order of
even date.
