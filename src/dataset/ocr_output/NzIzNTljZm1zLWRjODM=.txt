SALAHUDDIN PANHWER, J. These five Bail Applications Nos. 572 of
2012, 576 of 2012, 365 of 2012, 384 of 2012, and 270
of 2012 under section 497 (2) Cr. P. C and one Bail Application No. 197 of 2012
under section 498 Cr P. C, have been filed by applicants in same Crime No. 11 of
2012 under sections 409/406/420/477A/109/34 PPC of Police Station FIA
Commercial Bank Circle, Karachi, therefore we would dispose of all the above

five applications by one order.

1. The relevant facts are that complainant Dr. Mirza Ikhtiar Baig, Chairman
CEO M/s Pak Denim Limited lodged written complaint to Director FIA, Sindh
Zone, Karachi in respect of funds embezzlement in his company through forged
cheques in collaboration with some employees and banking staff, encashed
through Askari Bank, Atrium Mall Branch Karachi. On written complaint, inquiry

was conducted; during inquiry it revealed that the Relation Manager of Standard
Cr Bail No. 572 of 2012 - Sohail Anwar

Chartered Bank, Muhammad Khurram Tariq, with the connivance of Syed Atif
Hussain OG-II and Atif Sheikh of Clearing Department of Askari Bank
misappropriated amount in different accounts; the fraudulent amount was credited
in a benamidar account of Kamran Latif & Co, maintained at Askari Bank,
Atrium Mall Branch Karachi; during the course of investigation all relevant
documents of account of M/s Kamran Latif and Company and account of
Muhammad Ali in Standard Chartered Bank were seized; after investigation
interim challan was submitted against accused (1) Muhammad Ali (2)
Muhammad Yousuf, (3) Ramesh Lal, (4) Syed Atif Hussain, (5) Sheikh Atif
Hussain, (6) Sohail Anwar, (7) Muhammad Khurram Tariq, (8) Shiraz Ali, (9)
Kamran Latif, (10) Adnan Qadir and (11) Saeed Rajput; that all accused persons

have committed offence of breach of trust and cheating.

2. Learned counsel for the applicants have, inter alia, contended that
applicants have been involved in false case; applicants are private persons hence
section 409 PPC is not applicable to them; that co accused Syed Atif Hussain with
specific role, has been granted bail after arrest by the trial Court and co-accused
Sheikh Atif Hussain, Kamran Latif, Saeed Ahmed have been granted bail before
arrest by trial Court vide order dated 08.05.2012 and 23.05.2012 respectively; that
applicants have almost identical role to the accused granted bail by trial Court;
complainant is private company hence offence does not fall within the jurisdiction
of Banking Court; some of applicants are still working in same company; they
have relied upon the cases of Khizar Hayat v. The State (2010 YLR 1180); 2008

SCMR 173 and Saeed Ahmed v. The State (1996 SCMR 1132).

3. Conversely, learned counsel for the complainant Mr. Nisar Ahmed Tarar
and learned Standing Counsel Ms. Iqbal Shiraz have argued that accused persons
have committed breach of trust; they have been assigned specific role in this case;

they are beneficiary of embezzled amount hence they are not entitled for bail.

4. Heard counsel for the parties. Perused record.
5. It is fact that total seven accused persons have been challaned in this case,

out of seven, one accused Syed Atif Hussain Shah has been granted bail after
arrest and accused Saeed Ahmed, Sheikh Atif Hussain and Kamran Latif have
been granted bail before arrest by the trial Court. It will be very proper and
relevant to reproduce the relevant portion of report under section 173 Cr P C to
determine, whether present applicants are entitled for bail on the rule of
consistency as they have identical case to the accused who have been granted bail
by the trial Court.

“Prior to registration of this case an enquiry was conducted at
CTW (Counter Terrorism Wing) FIA Karachi, in which it was
concluded that the case U/S 406, 420, 477A, 109, 34 PPC is made
out against accused persons namely Saeed Rajput the then CFO,
Muhammad Ali Kolachi former Purchase-in-charge, Nasir Abbas
Zaidi (Expired, death certificate placed on file), Muhammad
Yousuf Cashier (who was holding the possession of all cheque
books of company and made fake signatures on these cheques of
complainant and another authorized signatory Mirza Ishtiaq Baig),
Sohail Awan Account Manager, Shiraz Ali Ex-Employee,
Muhammad Khurram Tariq of SCB, Syed Atif Hussain OG-II and
Atif Sheikh of Askari Bank and others. It is also confirmed by the
Chairman and CEO of Pak Denim Company Limited (now
complainant) and Mirza Ishtiaq Baig another PW and signatory of
the cheques of the company, that the amount of Rs.15.05 Million
Pak Rupees was misappropriated by falsifying the books of the
account by accused Saeed Rajput the then CFO Muhammad Ali
Kolachi for Purchase Incharge. Nasir Abbas (died) death certificate
place on file. Muhammad Yousuf Cashier, Sohail Awan Accounts
Manager, Ramesh Dhiraj Lal and Shiraz Ali Ex-Employee of the
company with the collusion and abetment/connivance of each other

and bank officials”.

6. Admittedly, two accused Kamran Latif and Muhammad Ali were charged
on same allegation that both possess the account, wherefrom amount was
misappropriated; out of both accused, Kamran Latif has been granted bail by trial
Court and it is manifest in the prosecution story that accused Atif Hussasin OG-II
and Atif Sheikh being bank officials have been charged to manage false accounts
and misappropriated the amount of complainants company, both accused have
been granted bail by the trial Court. Under these circumstances, it is suffice to say
that case of applicants is at par of co-accused, who are on bail, already granted by
the trial Court thus the applicants are also entitled for equal treatment in the eyes

of law on rule of consistency.

7. Regarding contentions of learned counsel for complainant that this is a
case of breach of trust and forgery, it is pertinent to say that bail cannot be
withheld as punishment, when the case depends upon documentary evidence all
the documents are in possession of prosecution, therefore there is no chance of
tampering in prosecution case. The authenticity and admissibility of documents
can be determined at the trial stage; this proposition of law is well established, as
decided in the case of Saeed Ahmed v. The State reported in 1996 SCMR 1132, it
is observed as under:

“The case entirely depends upon documentary evidence
which seems to be in possession of the prosecution and
challan has already been submitted. The objection of the
learned counsel regarding addition of section 409 PPC may
carry some weight while considering bail application, as
there is no possibility of tampering with the evidence,
which is entirely documentary in nature and in possession
of the prosecution, petition was converted in appeal and

bail was granted”.

8. Keeping in view the dictum laid-down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case
referred above, we are convinced that the applicants have succeeded to establish

their case for bail hence they are entitled to be enlarged on bail.

9. By our short orders dated 25.07.2012, we have already granted bail to the
applicant Muhammad Ali Kolachi in Cr. Bail Application No. 365 of 2012 in the
sum of Rs.2,000,000/- (Rupees Two Million); to the applicant Ramesh Dhiraj Lal
in Cr. Bail Application No. 384 of 2012 in the sum of Rs.1,000,000/- (Rupees
One Million) and to the applicants in Cr. Bail Applications Nos. 572, 576,

and 270 of 2012 in the sum of Rs.500,000/- (Rupees Five Hundred
Thousand) each and PR Bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial

Court and these are the detailed reasons for the same.
