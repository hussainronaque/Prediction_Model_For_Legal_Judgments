QAISER RASHID KHAN, J. The accused/
petitioner, Ashfaq Ahmad, seeks bail in case FIR No.
769 dated 15.10.2014, under section 17 (3) Offences
Against Property (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance,
1979 read with sections 412 PPC and15 AA, registered
at police station Pahari Pura, Peshawar on the ground of
statutory delay in the conclusion of trial.

2. Arguments heard and available record perused.

3. Earlier, bail was declined to the
accused/petitioner on merits by this court vide order
dated 15.01.2016 in BA No. 2458-P of 2015. This time,
the accused/petitioner through his counsel has only
pressed into service the ground of delay which has
occasioned whereby his trial has not been concluded

ever since his arrest on 05.11.2014.
4. In a situation where the occurrence took place on
15.10.2014, the accused/petitioner was arrested on
05.11.2014 and has been behind the bars for the last
thirty three (33) months, where the challan has been put
in court on 08.02.2017 and the conclusion of the trial
with whatever its outcome is yet a forlorn dream for the
accused/petitioner and more so when such delay barring
a couple of months consumed while pursuing his bail
applications is not attributable to the accused/petitioner,
then he is indeed entitled to the concession of bail on the
ground of statutory delay in the conclusion of his trial
or else his further stay in the judicial lock-up may
tantamount to his pre-trial conviction.

5. Accordingly, this bail application is allowed and
the petitioner is directed to be released on bail provided
he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs.500000/- (five
hundred thousand) with two sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of the learned trial court. The
sureties must be local, reliable and men of means.

Announced:
11.09.2017.
