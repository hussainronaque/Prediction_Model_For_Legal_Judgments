Cr.M BA No.3688-P/2019
Mujtaba Hassan Vs the State ete

JUDGMENT

rere
AHMAD ALI, J. Through the instant petition, the
petitioner (Mujtaba Hassan) seeks his post arrest bail in
case FIR No.267 dated 09.08.2019 u/s 302 PPC, PS
Usterzai, Kohat. Same relief was, however, declined to
him by the learned Trial Court vide order dated
07.10.2019.

2. In view of the Judgment in case titled “Muhammad
Shakeel Vs the State” reported in PLD 2014 SC 458,
facts of the case need not to be mentioned at bail stage.
However, present petitioner is behind the bars on the
charge of murder of son of the complainant.

3. Argument of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record gone through.

4. No doubt, it was an unseen occurrence and initially
nobody was charged for the commission of offence. It so

happened, when the complainant recorded his 164 Cr.P.C
statement before the learned Judicial Magistrate on
22.08.2019, after a considerable delay of 13 days and
without disclosing his source of information in this regard.
5. Being an unseen occurrence, there is no direct
evidence to prima facie connect the present accused
petitioner with the commission of offence. Be that as it
may, suffice it to say that the evidence in shape of CDR
data regarding presence of accused in village, without any
corroborative evidence is a weak type of evidence, and
refusal of bail by the learned trial Court on the said sole
ground could not be justified, especially when it has not
been mentioned in the FIR or statement recorded under
section 164 Cr.P.C that at what time deceased was lastly
seen in the company of the accused. Reliance could be
placed on 2015 YLR 1952.

6. In the circumstances, case of accused-petitioner will
require further probe to establish his involvement in the
commission of offence through reliable evidence as
provided under Sub-Section (2) of Section 497 Cr.P.C,
where grant of bail is a rule and refusal thereof is an
exception. Besides, in view of no recovery/discovery and
no confessional statement by the accused, his involvement
in the case is required to be established through pro &
contra evidence during trial. In this regard reliance could

be safely placed on case law reported in 2017 SCMR 61,
2014 SCMR 12. Petitioner is behind the bars since his
arrest and is also no more required for further
investigation.

7. Moreover, it has been held time and again by the
august Supreme Court that bail does not mean acquittal of
accused but only change of custody from Government
agencies to the sureties, who on furnishing bonds take
responsibility to produce the accused whenever and
wherever required to be produced. Reliance could be
placed on case reported in 2008 SCMR_807_ “Haji
Muhammad Nazir Vs State”.

8. Before parting with the order, this court finds it
necessary to mention that all the observations recorded above
are tentative assessment just for the disposal of bail petition and
not intended to influence the mind of trial Court, which is free
to appraise the evidence strictly in accordance with law and

merits of the case and; as per law laid down in 1996 SCMR

1845).

9. In view of the above discussion and on tentative
assessment of material available on file, a case arguable for
the grant of bail is made out. Resultantly, this petition is
allowed and the accused-petitioner, named above, is
admitted to bail provided he furnishes bail bonds in the
sum of Rs.200,000/- with two sureties, each in the like

amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial
Magistrate, concerned, who shall ensure that the sureties
are local, reliable and men of means.
10. Above are the detailed reasons of short order of even

date.
