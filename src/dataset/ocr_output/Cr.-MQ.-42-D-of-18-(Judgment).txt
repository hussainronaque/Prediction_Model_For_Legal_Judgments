2. Common facts of these cases are that during
checking, the WAPDA authorities found the private
respondents using electricity through direct connections
without passing through the electric meters and thus on the
report of WAPDA authorities, separate FIRs under Section
462-I PPC were registered against the respondents on different
dates. After completion of investigation, complete challan
against the respondents were submitted and their cases were
pending trial. The learned Sessions Judge, D.I-Khan clubbed
all these cases and vide consolidated judgment dated
05.11.2018 held that “it would be a futile exercise to continue
with the trial of the matters when there is every likelihood of
declaration of the same as corum-non-judice. The question of
maintainability is, therefore, disposed of accordingly. Further
proceedings in the matters are stopped and the challans so

sent up are dismissed as returned. The complainant side is,
[M4007

-5-

however, left at liberty to bring complaints in all the individual
accused.” Hence, these petitions.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner at the very
outset argued that the impugned judgments are illegal and
violative of the judgment dated 16.10.2017 of this Court
passed in Cr.A.No.109-D/2016 vide which the cases were
remanded to the learned trial Court for its decision on the
question of jurisdiction. He further argued that the offence
under Section 462-O PPC is a cognizable offence and S.H.O
concemed police stations were competent to register the ibid
F.LRs. Further argued that when there is conflict between a
Statue and the Schedule, then preference is to be given to the
Schedule. Lastly, he prayed for acceptance of these petitions
and setting aside the impugned judgments/orders.

4. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
respondents, while controverting the arguments of the learned
counsel for petitioners argued that the controversy regarding
the preference of the Schedule over the Statue has already been
settled and placed reliance on 2001 YLR_ 197 (Karachi).
Further, argued that Chapter XVII-B, relating to the matters of
electricity, has already been included in the Pakistan Penal
Code vide Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2016 (Act
No.V1/2016), wherein an inbuilt provision has been provided
by Section 462-O PPC for dealing with the matters covered by
the ibid chapter, further argued that the ibid provisions of
Section 462-O PPC have specifically excluded the provisions
of Cr.P.C. 1898, as well as any other law for the time being in

force in the matters covered by Chapter XVII-B.

5. Arguments heard and record perused.
6. In these quashment petitions, the precise
question for determination before this Court is “whether the
provisions of Section 462-O PPC are applicable to the cases
covered by Chapter XVII-B of the Pakistan Penal Code
1860, or the Schedule appended to the Code of Criminal
Procedure 1898, is to be followed in respect of the ibid
offences.” For ease of reference provisions of Section 462-O
PPC are reproduced below:-

“462-0. Cognizance. (1) The Court

shall try an offence punishable under

this Chapter.

(2) Notwithstanding anything

contained in the Code of Criminal

Procedure, 1898 or any other law for

the time being in force, the Court shall

not take cognizance of any offence

under this Chapter except on a

complaint made, with reasons to be

recorded in writing along with full

particulars of the offence committed

under this Chapter, by duly authorized

officer (not below Grade 17) of the

Government or the distribution

company, as the case may be.”
7. The ibid provision of Section 462-O PPC starts
with non obstante clause i.e. “Notwithstanding” which means
“despite” or “in spite of. The very intention of the Legislature
by using the phrase ‘ ‘Notwithstanding’? in the heading of ibid
Section is to exclude all other provisions available in the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1898 as well as provisions available in
any other law for the time being in force in the matters covered
by Chapter XVII-B of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, the
application of non-obstante clause was elucidated by the

Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled "Muhammad

Mohsin Ghaman and others Vs. Government of Punjab
a

-7-

through Home Secretary Lahore and others" 2013 SCMR

85, wherein it was held that:-

"One of the foundational principles
governing the interpretation of non-
obstante clause is that it has to be read
in the context of what the legislature
intended in the enacting part of the
provision. In 'Interpretation of Statutes’
by NS Bindra, the author with
reference to specific precedent case
law precisely addresses this issue and
comments as follows:--

"It has to be read in the context of
what the legislature conveys in the
enacting part of the provision. It
should first be ascertained what the
enacting part of the section provides
on a fair construction of words used
according to their natural and ordinary
meaning and the non-obstante clause is
to be understood as operating to set
aside as no longer valid anything
contained in relevant existing law
which is inconsistent with the new
enactment. The enacting part of a
statute must, where it is clear, be taken
to control the non-obstante clause
where both cannot be read
harmoniously, for even apart from
such clause a later law abrogates
earlier laws clearly inconsistent with it.

The proper way to construe a non-
obstante clause is first to ascertain the
meaning of the enacting part on a fair
construction of its words. The meaning
of the enacting part which is so
ascertained is then to be taken as
overriding anything inconsistent to that
meaning in the provisions mentioned
in the non-obstante clause. A non-
obstante clause is usually used in a
provision to indicate that that provision
should prevail despite anything to the
contrary in the provision mentioned in
such non obstante clause. In case there
is any inconsistency between the non
obstante clause and another provision
one of the objects of such a clause is to
indicate that it is the non obstante
clause which would prevail over the
other clauses. It does not, however,
necessarily mean that there must be
repugnancy between the two
[Pted

-8-

provisions in all such cases. The

principle underlying non obstante

clause may be invoked only in the case

of ‘irreconcilable conflict”.
8. Thus, the very object and purpose of incorporating
non obstante clause in a provision is that the said provision
should prevail despite anything to the contrary provided in any
other provision of the same stature or any other law on the
same subject, and in the case of inconsistency and
irreconcilable conflict between the two clauses, the non
obstante clause would get preference over the other clause.
9, Hence, in view of the above, the offences
relating to Chapter XVII-B of the PPC shall only be covered
by the provisions of Section 462-O, which ousts the
applicability of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 or any
other law for the time being in force relating the assumption of
jurisdiction of the court in the matter. Thus the Court shall not
take cognizance of any offence under this Chapter, except on a
complaint made, with reasons to be recorded in writing along
with full particulars of the offence committed under this
Chapter, by duly authorized officer (not below Grade 17) of
the Government or the distribution company, as the case may
be. This certainly means that the Court shall not take
cognizance of any of the offences relating to Chapter XVII-B
of the PPC, but except upon a complaint provided by the
provisions of Section 462-0.
10. The term “Court” for the said purpose has been
defined in clause (a) of Section 462-G PPC to mean the Court
of Session designated as Electricity Utilities Court empowered

to take cognizance of an offence under the said Chapter.

11. Moving on further to the assertions of the
learned counsel for the Petitioners that the Schedule would
prevail over the parent statute, suffice it to mention that it is by
now a settled principle of law that when there is conflict in an
enabling provision of an Act or an Ordinance and the Schedule
thereto, then, the provisions of the main Act/Ordinance are to
prevail upon the provisions of the Schedule appended therein.
In this respect reliance is placed on the case of “Federation of
Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Finance and others

Vs. Haji Muhammad Sadiq and others” 2007 P_T D 67

[Supreme Court of Pakistan], wherein it was held that:-

“There could be cases wherein a
conflict between the Act and the
schedule could be visible and in such a
situation principle noted in the Craies
on Statute Law (seventh Edition 1971
at pg. 225) and N.S. Bindra's, The
Interpretation of Statutes (Seventh
Edition pg. 92) shall be pressed into
service. Keeping in view the above
principles, this Court in the case of
Excise and Taxation Officer v. Burma
Shell Storage (ibid) held that in case of
irreconcilable inconsistency between
the charging section and a schedule,
former is to prevail and schedule is to

yield to the Act.”
12. Moreover, it is settled principle of law that-A
communi observantia non est recedendum------ When

law requires a thing to be done in a particular manner, then it
would be a nullity in the eye of law, if not performed in that
very prescribed manner. This established principle of law has
been affirmed by the Apex court and in that respect reliance
can be placed on; The Collector of Sales Tax, Gujranwala v.

13. In view of the above, the impugned judgments
and orders dated 05.11.2018 are based on proper interpretation
of law and do not need any interference by this Court in the
present quashment petitions, therefore, the same are dismissed,
being meritless.
