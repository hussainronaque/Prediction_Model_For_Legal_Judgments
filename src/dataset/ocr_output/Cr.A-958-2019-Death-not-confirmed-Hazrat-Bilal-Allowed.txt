JUDGMENT

FRR RK

AHMAD ALL, J. Called in question herein is
the judgment of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge/Judge Model Criminal Trial
Court, Charsadda, dated 30.11.2018, whereby
appellant Hazrat Bilal s/o Shams-ul-Islam was
convicted and sentenced to death and burdened
with payment of compensation amount of
Rs.400,000/- to LRs of deceased u/s 544-A(2)
Cr.P.C or in default whereof to suffer six
months SI, in case FIR No.627 dated
14.11.2013 under section 302 PPC, Police

Station, Sardheri (Charsadda).

2. Brief facts of the case, as per

prosecution’s version, are that the
complainant/Ishfaq Ahmad reported the matter
to local police while accompanying the dead
body of deceased at the Casualty of DHQ
Hospital Charsadda to the effect that on the day
of occurrence, he alongwith his cousins i.e.
accused (Bilal), Shakil Arshad (deceased) and
Abdullah were on the way back to their village
after offering a ‘Fatiha Khwani’, in a Suzuki
motorcar (Khyber Registration No.B-1464).
Accused-appellant (Bilal) was sitting on front
seat while deceased (Shakil Arshad) was on
driving seat while the complainant alongwith
Abdullah were sitting on rear seat of the said
vehicle. When reached to the place of
occurrence, all of a sudden, accused-appellant
put out his pistol from the fold of his trouser
and make a fire on deceased (Shakil Arshad).
Resultantly, he got seriously injured. The
accused-appellant made his escape from the
spot. The deceased (then injured) was taken to
hospital for treatment but he succumbed to
injures on the way. Motive was stated to be
money dispute between deceased and accused-
appellant. On the basis of murasila Ex.PA/1,
FIR ibid was registered against the accused-

appellant.
2. On completion of investigation, challan
was submitted in Court where the appellant
was charge-sheeted to which he pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution in
order to prove its case, produced and examined
aS many as seven witnesses whereafter
statement of the accused was_ recorded,
wherein, he professed his innocence. The
learned Trial Court, after conclusion of trial,
found the appellant guilty of the charge and,
while recording his conviction, sentenced him
as mentioned above. Feeling aggrieved, the

appellant has filed the instant appeal before

this Court.

3. Arguments heard and record gone
through.

4. Perusal of postmortem report suggests

that the deceased sustained a single wound
injury on his chest. The vehicle plying in
Pakistan are right hand driving, so, it is not
appealable to a prudent mind to hit a person
with fir arm on the chest, who was driving the
vehicle and the assailant was sitting in the
front seat of the same vehicle, it could only be
possible when the assailant is left handed but

no such evidence is available on file. For
ready reference the detail of injuries is given
below:-

Wounds, bruises, position, size &
nature:

FAI entry wound on left side chest size about
1x1 cm (Frontal chest), its exit size about 2x2
cm on back chest. Charring marks are
present.

INTERNAL APPEARANCE:

Thorax: Walls, ribs and cartilages, pleurae,

left lung, pericardium and heart and blood

vessels are injured.

Muscles, bones and Joints: Muscles of the site

of injury are injured.

Remarks

The deceased died of severe shock and

bleeding caused by FAI to vital organs

mentioned above.
It is worth to mention here that in postmortem
report the word ‘charring mark’ was seemed to
be subsequently added and the hand writing
and the pen used for this word is totally
different from the other writing/pen used.
5. The postmortem report further suggests
that death of the deceased (then injured) was
instantaneous while the complainant stated in
the FIR that while he was taking the injured to
hospital, he succumbed to injures in the way

which further falsify the narrations of

complainant.
6. The record further suggests that no
identifier of the dead body was produced as
one of the identifier was also mentioned as
eyewitness of the occurrence which was
abandoned by the prosecution, so in the
circumstances, adverse inference under
Article 129(g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order
1984 can be safely drawn. In this regard
reliance could be safely placed on case law
reported in NLR 2015 SCJ 121. Even
otherwise, in the situation legal inference
could also be drawn that if the said witness
had entered into the witness box then he
would not have supported the prosecution
case. Case law refers: PLD 2016 SC 17.

7. According to FIR, it was the story of
prosecution that the occurrence took place
when they were coming back from ‘Sarbiland
Koroonda’ after condolence, but no statement
of any such person was recorded to show that
there were four persons in the said vehicle
when they come to the house of that person
for condolence. An important piece of
evidence is missing in the instant case.

8. So far as recovery of empty from the

vehicle is concerned, same was not proved as
PW-2 who was the witness of four Recovery
Memos, when examined in the Court during
trial, he recorded his statement only to the
extent of one recovery memo, and to the
extent of recovery of blood and crime empty,
this witness remained mum and it was the IO
who simply exhibited the Recovery Memo.
However, there is also nothing on record to
suggest that as to whether the spent bullet has
been recovered from the back of driving seat
of the said vehicle or not?

9. It is also a very important aspect of the
case, that as per FIR the
eyewitness/complainant after the deceased
(then injured) when got injured was removed
from the driving seat and shifted to the rear
seat, and complainant occupied the driving
seat so in that case the clothes and the hands
of the complainant must have been smeared
with the blood of the injured (now dead) but
neither his clothes were taken into possession
nor sent to the FSL for comparison. PW-4,
who scribed the Murasila (Ex.PA/1), stated
that he did not remember that whether the
hands and clothes of the complainant were

smeared with the blood or not, so in such
situation when the case of prosecution was
that injured (deceased) has got injures when
he was on driving seat, and the complainant
said that he was in the said motorcar and also
occupied the driving seat by shifting the
deceased (then injured) to rear seat, then it
was incumbent upon the complainant to
produce his blood stained clothes to the IO
and the IO was also duty bound to take the
clothes of complainant and send the same to
FSL with the garments of deceased for
grouping which could prove the presence of
complainant in the vehicle at the time of
occurrence, but in absence of such evidence,
the presence of complainant at the time of
occurrence could not be proved.

10. Moreover, as per FIR four persons
(cousins inter-se) were present in the vehicle
but other two witnesses were not produced,
here too, the adverse inference under Article
129(g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 can
be safely drawn which phenomenon has been
well explained in NLR 2015 SCJ 121 and
PLD 2016 SC 17.

11. It is the case of prosecution that

complainant brought deceased (then injured) to
hospital in the same vehicle, so the vehicle is
question was required to be available in the
hospital but PW-6/IO of the case stated in his
court statement that when he visited the spot at
about 3:30 PM the vehicle was present on the
spot. Record is totally silent that how the
vehicle was found by the IO on the spot and
that who took the vehicle to the spot.

12. The eye witness is closely related to the
deceased, who showed extraordinary strange
conduct after having seen brother-in-law
murdered and tried his level best to suppress
certain facts proving that it was an
unwitnessed occurrence and he had seen just
the deceased (then injured) and not the
occurrence in action. Exclusion of the said
witness from consideration would result that
no evidence was left on record to connect the
accused with the crime because the rest of the
evidence is corroborative piece of evidence.
Reference can be made to case law reported in
1984 SCMR 42, PLD 1981 SC 472, 1972
SCMR 578, 2007 SCMR 1825, 1990 SCMR
158 _& 2011 SCMR 474. Even, otherwise,
testimony of close related witnesses is required

to be strongly supported by unimpeachable and
worth reliance corroborative evidence as per
the law laid down in 2015 P.Cr.L.J 81.

13. So far as motive behind the occurrence
is concerned, same has not been proved. Once
the motive is set up by the prosecution then the
burden of proof is shifted to its shoulder.
The complainant had put forth in the initial
report that there was a money dispute between
the deceased and accused-appellant. The
prosecution has not brought on record even an
iota of evidence in black and white in shape of
any affidavit in respect of alleged money
dispute between deceased and accused-
appellant except a receipt of loan. But to our
utter surprise, no witness thereof, has been
produced for substantiating the said version of
the complainant.

14. In the given circumstances, the
complainant has proved himself to be a chance
witness, therefore, his ocular account is totally
disbelieved and it is held that the occurrence
had not taken place in the mode and manner as
alleged by the complainant. Wisdom could be
safely sought from the case law reported in

2019 P.Cr.L.J 401 & NLR 2015 Cr.C 186.
10

15. The above discussion has led this Court
to believe that the learned trial court has erred
in appreciating the case evidence in its true
perspective. It has been held, time and again
by the superior courts, that a slightest doubt
occurs in the prosecution case is sufficient to
grant acquittal to an accused. For giving the
benefit of doubt, it is not necessary that there
should be many circumstances creating
doubts. Single circumstance creating
reasonable doubt in the prudent mind about
the guilt of accused makes him entitled to its
benefit, not a matter of grace in concession,
but as a matter of right, as per law laid down
in 2009 SCMR 230, 2011 SCMR 664, 2011
SCMR 646, 1984 PLD SC 433, 2012 MLD
1358, 2007 SCMR 1825, 2008 P.Cr.L.J 376,
1994 PLD Peshawar 114, 2012 PLD
Peshawar 01, 1999 P.Cr.L.J_ 1087, 1997
SCMR_449, 2011 SCMR_ 820 & 2006
P.Cr.L.J_SC 1002. The conclusions drawn by
the learned trial Court are not borne out of the
case evidence, therefore, the impugned

judgment is not sustainable.

7. For what has been discussed above and

while extending benefit of doubt to the
11

appellant, this appeal is allowed, the impugned
judgment is set aside and the appellant is
acquitted of the charge levelled against him.
He be set at liberty forthwith, if not required to

be detained in any other case.

8. Above are the reasons of short order of
even date.
Murder Reference No.24 of 2019

As we have allowed the instant appeal
by acquitting the appellant, therefore, the

murder reference is answered in the negative.
