JUDGMENT

SYED _ARSHAD ALI, J:- © Muhammad Sohail son of
Muhammad Farooq, who has been nominated in the case FIR
No. 84 dated 08.02.2021 registered under Section 462-I PPC
at Police Station PESCO, Peshawar, has approached this Court
through the instant constitutional petition, seeking quashment
of the said FIR.

2. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioner has argued that the offences contained in Chapter-
XVII-B of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (“PPC”) are non-
cognizable albeit the Court can only take cognizance of the
matter on a complaint in terms of Section 462-O of the PPC,
therefore, the registration of FIR be quashed. He has placed
reliance on PESCO through Chief Executive Officer vs. The

State and 43 others (2020 P.Cr.LJ 249).

2
3. The learned Advocate General, while rebutting

the arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner, has argued
that though under Section 462-O PPC, the Court cannot take
cognizance of the matter on police report, however, this does
not mean that the police cannot investigate the matter and
register the case as the offences under Chapter-XVII of the
PPC are admittedly cognizable offences. In support of his
arguments, he placed reliance on the cases of Zeeshan Anjum
vs. State_etc_ (PLJ 2022 Cr.C 1152), Atta Muhammad
Deshani_vs. District Police Officer, Haripur_and 2 others
(2019 PCr.LJ 275) and Muhammad Nazir vs. Fazal Karim
and others (PLD 2012 SC 892).

4. Arguments heard and record perused.

5. It is evident from record that on the basis of
complaint filed by the Muhammad Sohail SDO, the Incharge
Police Station PESCO has registered the FIR wherein the
petitioner has been nominated for the theft of electricity and
has been charged under Section 462-I PPC. Chapter-XVII-B
was inserted in the PPC through Criminal Law (Amendment)
Act, 2016 (“Act, 2016”), whereby theft of electricity,
obstruction and tampering with transmission lines etc were
made offences punishable under Sections 462-H, 462-1, 462-J,
462-K, 462-L and 462-M. Similarly, through Act, 2016, the
second schedule to the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898
(“Cr.P.C.”) was also amended whereby Section 462-H to

Section 462-M PPC were also inserted being non-bailable and
3
cognizable by the police as it envisages that the police may

arrest the accused charged for such offences without warrant.
6. The phrase ‘cognizable offence’ and ‘cognizable
case’ has been defined under Section 4(f) of Cr.P.C. to mean
an offence in which the police officer may in accordance with
the second schedule of Cr.P.C. or under any law for the time
being enforced arrest without warrant.

7. Section 154 Cr.P.C. further envisages that when
an Incharge of Police Station receives any information
regarding the commission of cognizable offence, he shall
reduce the same into writing or under his direction the First
Information Report (“FIR”) to be entered in a book to be kept
by such officer. Thus, as evident from the word ‘shall’ used in
Section 154 Cr.P.C. it is manifest that the intention of
legislature is that the said provision is mandatory and on
receiving the information regarding the commission of a
cognizable offence, the police officer is required to register the

FIR. Muhammad Bashir vs. Station House Officer Okara
Cantt (PLD 2007 SC 539). Similarly, Section 173 Cr.P.C.

envisages that on completion of investigation, the Incharge of
Police Station shall through Public Prosecutor forward the
matter to a Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of
offence or send the same for trial to the competent court in
terms of Sections 190/193 Cr.P.C.

8. The procedure for trial before the Sessions Court

is provided under Chapter-XXII-A of Cr.P.C. whereas the
S

4
place of trial/jurisdiction of criminal court and inquiry has

been provided under Chapter-XV of the Cr.P.C. In the case of

non-cognizable offence the procedure of receiving information

and investigation has been provided under Section 155 Cr.P.C.
Therefore, in view of the above, the law is clear that the
registration of FIR, investigating the offence and taking
cognizance of cases by the Courts are two distinct and
independent concepts under the criminal law.

9. In view of the clear mandate of Section 173
Cr.P.C. any cases in which the police has taken cognizance,
the final challan is to be submitted before the competent court
of law by the Incharge Police Station in terms of Section 173
Cr.P.C., however, the offence of criminalizing the theft of
electricity and other ancillary matters through Act, No. VI of
2016 there is a slight departure relating in taking cognizance
of the matter by the trial Court as provided under Section 462-
O PPC inserted through the aforesaid Act, which reads as

under:-

“462-0 Cognizance.- (1) The Court shall try an
offence punishable under this Chapter.

(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 or any other law
for the time being in force, the Court shall not take
cognizance of an offence under this Chapter except
on a complaint made, with reasons to be recorded
in writing along with full particulars of the offence
committed under this Chapter, by duly authorized
officer (not below Grade 17) of the Government or
the distribution company, as the case may be”.

10. The effect of insertion of Section 462-O PPC
would be that the police after registration of the case and

completion of investigation would not be competent to file a
5
challan before the Court in terms of Section 173 Cr.P.C. but

the Court would take cognizance of the matter on the
complaint made by the authorized officer of the Distribution
Company not below Grade-17 by recording reasons for
submission of complaint, therefore, it is evident from the
aforesaid procedure that the police officer on receiving any
complaint regarding the theft of electricity shall register a
case, investigate the matter, however, for submission of the
final report; instead through the mechanism provided under
Section 173 Cr.P.C. he will place the same before the
authorized officer of the PESCO, who after scrutinizing the
investigation report shall submit a complaint before the
competent court of law. It is because that Section 462-O PPC
starts with non-obstante clause which means that the
mechanism of taking cognizance before the Court would be
through filing of a complaint and not by submitting of challan
in terms of Section 173 read with Section 190 Cr.P.C.

11. The mechanism of taking cognizance through a
complaint by a Court in cognizable and non-cognizable cases
is not novice to our legal dispensation. Under Section 196
Cr.P.C. where cognizance of certain offences is barred except
on complaint by Central or Provincial Government or
authorized officer, however, the offences referred in Section
196 Cr.P.C; for example Sections 123-B, 171-J, 153-A and
505 are cognizable, therefore, the FIR is registered under such

sections against a person charged for the said offences.
6
However, for taking cognizance, Court requires

complaint/sanction of a Central or Provincial Government or
authorized officer at the time of framing charge. In the case of

Malik Shaukat Ali Dogar and 12 others vs. Ghulam Qasim
Khan Khakwani and others “ (PLD 1994 SC 281), the Apex

Court while dealing with a similar issue has held that:-

“6. So far as the question of registration of the case
without prior sanction of the competent authority is
concerned, in the case of Emperor v. Khawaja
Nazir Ahmad (AIR 1955 Privy Council 18) the law
laid down was that the prohibition contained in
section 197, Cr.P.C. against a prosecution without
the necessary sanction is against the action of
taking of cognizance by the Court. It does not
prevent, preclude or otherwise interfere with the
power of the police in the matter of registration fo
the case and the investigation thereof. The sanction
required under section 197, Cr.P.C. is even
otherwise not required in view of decision in the
case of Zafar Awan PLD 1992 SC 72”.

Similarly, in the case of Industrial Development
Bank_of Pakistan_and_others_vs. Mian Asim Fareed and
others (2006 SCMNR 483), the Apex Court was also faced
with a similar circumstances. In the said case, the FIR was
registered under Sections 420/406/379 PPC at the instance of
an officer of the Bank, which was quashed by the Hon’ble
High Court on the ground that Section 7(4) of the Financial
Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance No. XLVI of
2001 prescribed that it was only a Banking Court which could
take cognizance of the offence under the Ordinance and that
also on a complaint in writing made by a person authorized by
the Bank in that behalf and that in the circumstances,
recording of the FIR could not be sustained. However the

Apex Court while dealing the matter has held that:-
7

“In the absence of any finding that the above
mentioned offences mentioned in the FIR were false
and malicious and in the absence of a finding that if
a particular forum or mode had been prescribed
with respect to the taking of cognizance of an
offence then the same also implied prohibition
regarding the registration of an FIR, no such order
could be passed nor the same could be approved.
Needless to add that the registration of an FIR and
taking of cognizance of cases were two distinct and
independent concepts under the criminal law; that if
the intention of the law-maker was to put any clog
on the registration of an FIR, then the Legislature
would have said so specifically and that if the law
put a condition only on the taking of cognizance
then it can never be read to imply prohibition on
registration of FIRs”.

Somehow similar view was also expressed by the
Apex Court in the case of Muhammad Nazir vs. Fazal Karim

and others (PLD 2012 SC 892), which reads as under:-

“We may observe with respect that the learned
Judge-in-Chamber of the Lahore High Court,
Lahore seems to have confused the expression
‘cognizance’ appearing in Section 195, Cr.P.C.
with the expressions ‘cognizable’ and ‘non-
cognizable’ finding mention in Sections 154 to 157
Cr.P.C. and had also failed to appreciate that
taking of cognizance of an offence by a court is a
thing quite distinct from investigation of a reported
offence by the police of any other investigation
agency The learned Judge-in-Chamber ought to
have appreciated that the provisions of section
195(1) (c), Cr.P.C. deal only with taking of
cognizance of an offence by a court and the same do
not place an embargo upon reporting such an
alleged forgery to the police, registration of an FIR
in that regard or conducting of an investigation in
respect of such an allegation. There may be
situations where a court before whom an allegation
has been levelled regarding production or giving in
evidence of a forged or tampered document may in
the first instance like to get the matter of alleged
forgery required into or investigated by a trained
investigating agency or it may require the party
levelling the allegation to report the matter to the
investigating agency for an inquiry or investigation
before making up its mind whether to lodge any
complaint in writing under section 195(1) (c),
Cr.P.C. before the trial Court or not”.

12, Having said that the police was competent to
register the case against the petitioner then in such a

circumstances on factual ground, this Court has no
8
jurisdiction to interfere with the police investigation or take

the role of investigation agency and to quash the FIR, while
exercising constitutional powers under Article 199 of the
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 or Section
561-A Cr.P.C. Shahnaz Begum vs. The Hon’ble Judges of
the High Court of Sindh and Baluchistan _and_another
(PLD 1971 Supreme Court 677), Brig. (Rtd) Imtiaz
Ahmad’s case (1994 SCMR 2142) and Dr. Ghulam Mustafa
vs. The State” (2008 SCMR 76).

13, In view of the above, we find no merit in this

petition which is accordingly dismissed.
