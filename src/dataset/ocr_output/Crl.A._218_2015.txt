3. This single judgment shall also decide connected Jail
Petitions No.249 and 454 of 2015 being the outcome of the same

identical.
Prosecution Story:

4. The initial story set up in FIR No.291/08 is that on a
source report of intelligence network that, some explosive laden
vehicles have entered Rawalpindi and the terrorists are likely to
explode the same at important public places to cause massive
destruction, both of property and human life, all law enforcing

agencies/police were put on alert.
CrL.A. 218/15 etc. 3

5. On 6.6.2008, SHO PS Sadiq Abad, Rawalpindi on a tip off
that the vehicles were parked in Awan Service Station parking lot,
situated in Dhoke Kala Khan and the terrorists were likely to make
departure for the target therefore, he along with the police party of the
PS and companies of Elite Force reached there immediately, cordoned
off the area and found (i) Abdul Manan of Murree, district Rawalpindi
(ii) Abid Khan, district Tank (iii) Muhammad Ishaq, Gulbahar Colony,
Peshawar (iv) Muhammad Kabeer, Havelian, district Abbottabad (v)
Qamar Zaman of district D.G. Khan and (vi) Zafar Ali of Darra Adam
Khel (F.R Kohat), standing thereby, who on seeing the heavy
contingent got into the three vehicles however, they were brought
down. On search of the vehicles, from the corolla car four pressure
cookers full of explosive and two tins of milk also full of explosive, nuts
and bolts were recovered. From Land-cruiser, No. LXH 7860 five
pressure cookers packed with explosive, three milk containers of the
same nature, two plastic containers full of diesel fuel, while from land-
cruiser No.JH-175 six pressure cookers and two milk containers full of
explosive, two plastic cane full of diesel fuel, three small bags
containing nuts and bolts were recovered. All of them were arrested,
as the accused had planned to indulge in subversive activities, causing
mass devastation, both of life and property. The "Muras/a” report for
crimes u/Ss. 7 ATA, 120-B PPC and sections 4 & 5 of the Explosive
Substances Act was allegedly sent to the Police Station where the

above FIR was registered at 8:40 am on the same day i.e.6.6.2008.

6. In view of the nature of the crime, the Ministry of Interior,
Government of Pakistan, constituted JIT comprising officers of FIA and
a Deputy Superintendent of Police. During interrogation Abdul Manan

accused arrested on the spot, happened to be Intikhab Ahmad Abbasi,
CrL.A. 218/15 etc. 4

appellant. During the course of investigation further recoveries were
made at the instance of the petitioners from the other set of acquitted

accused.

7. The JIT through self crafted design, gave another colour to
the alleged crime, portraying that the accused were deputed and sent
by the then terrorist commander Bait-Ullah Mehsud (dead) Qari
Hussain and others to assassinate General(R) Pervez Musharraf, the
then head of the State and Army. It was brought on record that at
some occasion unsuccessful attempt was made on his life when the
accused in the three explosive laden vehicles chased his cavalcade
from Rawalpindi to Islamabad but due to mechanical fault caught by
one vehicle, they could not execute the plan and_ returned
unsuccessful. One Mansoor was shown as their handler at Rawalpindi
who had hired room for accommodating the accused but that place is

still untraced.

8. Thereafter, as the story goes they were directed to strike
at the GHQ with explosive laden vehicles to assassinate General (R)
Pervez Musharraf however, before executing the second plan they

were apprehended by the police in the above manner.

9. Cases of such nature creating that much of sensation
always receive wide publicity like in this case when the attention of
print and electronic media both, national and international was
attracted. Therefore, in the appraisal and re-appraisal of evidence
courts are required to take extra degree of caution so that it might not
be led to a wrong conclusion due to over-smarting design of the

investigating agency.
CrL.A. 218/15 etc. 5

10. Majority of the accused from whom large quantity of the
same kind of explosive powder was recovered at the instance of the
present accused, have been acquitted by both the Courts below,

disbelieving the major portion of the prosecution case.

The Prosecution itself has divided its case into three separate
parts, which are as follows: -
“ii) The arrest of the _ petitioners/appellant along with
explosive laden vehicles, which were connected with the

batteries of the vehicles and push buttons on the front

penal, to be detonated and cause explosions;

(ii) that, some of the accused had received the command and
directions personally from the notorious commander Bait-
Ullah Mehsood and two other commanders, referred to
above, to carry out the suicidal attacks on General (R)
Pervez Musharraf and for their safe stay, their handler
namely Mansoor had hired room somewhere, where the

accused were to take rest at night;
and

(iii) except Intikhab Ahmed Abbasi, appellant, the rest of the
accused/petitioners confessed their guilt and the story of

the Prosecution so set up received confirmation.”

11. Attending to the first part, the very arrest of the
appellant/petitioners from the parking lot of Awan Service Station with
explosive laden vehicles appears to be highly intriguing one. The
heavy contingent of police raided the premises, surrounded it from all
four corners and during the arrest, recovery and seizure proceedings
not a single public witness was associated. Even the owner,
caretaker/manager and particularly the watchman, who was deputed
for the look-after and care of the parked vehicles to ensure that no

vehicle parked inside is taken away by unauthorized person, was not
CrL.A. 218/15 etc. 6

available or could not be procured. The large contingent of police
remained on the crime scene for many hours but out of all these
persons, none was available. This mysterious circumstance by itself
would bespeak about the proceedings conducted behind the blind
curtain out of the sight of such persons. Even the register maintained
in the office of the service station showing the entries about the
parked vehicles and its particulars was not taken into possession
rather it was arranged after many days. The said register was
containing lose sheets, blank pages and the rest were half filled
besides that the most disturbing aspect of the matter is that all the
three vehicles laden with explosive substance (potassium chloride)
were not mentioned therein and they were shown one day earlier at
one page. Who was the author of these entries and who among the
three was maintaining the register, still remains a begging question
yet to be answered, as on 14.6.2008 while taking the said register into
custody, the owner of the premises, Raja Qaiser, his brother Faisal
Shabbir and Caretaker Sajawal were present but none of them was
examined to ascertain the authorship of the entries in the register.
None of the three was cited as a witness in the calendar nor anyone of
them was produced at the trial and once the learned courts below
discarded this piece of primary evidence, the same had rendered the
entire story about the arrest of the accused with explosive laden
vehicles from the above premises has become unreliable. The
noticeable contradictions amongst the prosecution witnesses interse
apart, the two learned courts below have rightly discarded this primary
piece of evidence and in the absence of that no reliance can be placed

on the testimony of highly interested prosecution witnesses when the
CrL.A. 218/15 etc. 7

fairness and honesty in the course of investigation from the very
inception has become a fantasy and drastically eroded.

Even the report of NADRA about the forged identity cards
allegedly recovered from the accused was not brought on record at the
trial to prove the charge of forgery.

12. The Head of the J.I.T., Nasrullah Gondal, Assistant
Director, FIA (PW-18), to whom the accused and the explosive laden
vehicles were handed over by the SHO, Police Station, Sadiqabad,
Rawalpindi, when was asked by the defence, could not trace out or
refer any case diary showing the number of the vehicles and other
articles entrusted to him on 7.6.2008. He also could not tell the trial
court that the appellant/petitioners had made several complaints to
the Judge, Anti-Terrorism Court, Director General, FIA and other
authorities against the mode and manner of the investigation and to
record their defence plea. It is a matter of record that all the accused
were kept under tight security and during transit to the court or way
back, the level of high security was further enhanced. It is absolutely
unbelievable that this witness did not know about the nature of the
complaints lodged by the accused when he was the Incharge/Head of
the JIT all the times. The inference would that he has deliberately
suppressed the truth from the court. He also admitted cuttings, over-
writings and interpolation made in the recovery memos about the
quantity of the explosive substance, recovered from the accused. The
substituted entries were not initialed by him. He also admitted at the
trial that no Prado Jeep was mentioned in the register of Awan Service
parking Lot rather Pajero Jeep was mentioned and even the initial date

of recovery was scored off and was substituted by 8.6.2008.
CrL.A. 218/15 etc. 8

13. It is also a matter of record that the accused suffered
many injuries during their custody, however, an unbelievable and
amazing story was tailored that these injuries were suffered by the
accused when they were taken to Wah Cantt/Taxila to point out the
house of another accomplice but when they could not do so, while
coming back the accused jumped at the metalled road, started rolling
thereon and sustained the injuries. To muffle and burry deep the
torture given to the accused, he got treated the injured accused from
a private clinic instead of taking them to the government hospital. The
legitimate inference would be that due to severe torture, when the
accused got frustrated and had broken down and when they could not
point out the house of the so called accomplice they were treated
ruthlessly.

Another vital aspect of the case is that potassium chloride
allegedly recovered from the accused, was described as explosive
substance, however, the chemical formula of explosive substance is
‘potassium nitrate/black powder, sulphur, phosphorus nitrate, powder
aluminum or grain dust, potassium chlorate and many other chemicals
if are mixed together, would constitute high intensity explosive
substance to cause massive’ destruction/devastation through
explosion, therefore, a question arises as to whether potassium
chloride recovered in this case is a sole ingredient, which could be
termed high intensity and of velocity explosive substance to destroy a
well-fortified building/structure and cause destruction of both life and
property. The report of the incharge BDS thus appears to be
inconclusive and it cannot be categorized to be a right opinion on the

subject.
Crl.A. 218/15 etc. 9

14. According to the consistant stance, the conspiracy
punishable u/s 120-B PPC was hatched in South Wazirustan and Miran
Shah, the headquarter of North Wazirustan however, none of the
accused was taken to those places to point out as the investigating
agency could have easily undertaken that process with the permission
of the Interior Ministry, thus, the offence u/s 120-B PPC remained un-

established.

It is the prosecution case that the accused have not undergone
any tough training to carry out the assigned task. The nation is victim
of the terrorist activities which are carried out by highly trained and
skilled terrorists and the militant commanders would never venture to
send such raw hand and inexperienced persons for targeting the most
high profile person and the place like GHQ. Even the accused were not
taken to the place for pointing out where they first made unsuccessful
attempt on the cavalcade of the then Chief of Army Staff and this part
of the story is till a mystery. How the accused knew about the layout
plan and about the location of the office of the Chief of Army Staff
when no map or guideline materials were recovered from them, is

another lacuna in the case.

15. Within no time after the arrest of the accused ‘Muras/a Report’
was sent for registration of the case and Section 120-B PPC was also
inserted therein, when by then, the accused were neither interrogated
nor they had disclosed about the place, time where they hatched the
conspiracy and that too in FATA areas. This fact by itself would
suggest that the investigating agency from the very beginning virtually
acted under the influence of self-crafted theory of labeling the case of
a high profile. Till the close of the investigation they could not wriggle

out of that influence and did not act with fairness and application of
CrL.A. 218/15 etc. 10

independent mind. To the contrary, every effort was made albeit
fallaciously to score points in the subject case after it had got
extraordinary publicity and to earn undue fame at the cost of life of

the accused.

16. It is not denied that before the present occurrence two
unsuccessful attempts at the life of former Chief of Army Staff were
made. In the first one, a time/remote control device was detonated
under the bridge when the cavalcade of the then General had hardly
passed through the same. The second one was the most dreadful
suicidal attack which was made on his cavalcade on 25" December,
2003 near ‘Jhanda Cheechi’, Rawalpindi when explosive laden vehicle
was blasted near his car and he narrowly escaped. It is a hard fact
that after the second attack it was decided firmly to trace out the
mastermind and all suspects involved in such attacks/terrorist
activities. A massive hunt was launched by all the law enforcing
agencies and many suspects were arrested and many were released
after tough interrogation. Judged from this angel, the plea of the
appellant/petitioners gets support that they were arrested earlier by
some agency personnels and after long detention were then handed

over to the local police.

17. Considering the case in the above background, it would be
fair to draw an inference that the accused were coerced and
pressurized to make confession after remaining in the custody of the

J.1.T. for many weeks blind foldedly at unknown places.

18. It is an admitted fact that the petitioners (i) Abid (ii) Ishaq
(iii) Qamar were produced before the area Judicial Magistrate on

24.6.2008 but they refused to make confessions thus, they were
CrL.A. 218/15 etc. 11

remanded to judicial custody (prison). It is highly shocking and no
prudent mind would believe the false story that when these accused
were brought out of the court, at that point of time they disclosed to
make confessions when by then they were to be out of the clutches
and reach of the investigating agency. Here, intrigues were pressed
into service and instead of complying with the order of judicial remand
of the accused, the investigating agency disregarding the same,
applied to the District & Sessions Judge, Rawalpindi to depute Special
Magistrate for recording their confessions. The confessions thus
procured with the courtesy of the Special Magistrate besides being
irregular, have lost judicial efficacy and legal worth. Out of the two
Special Magistrates who recorded the confessions of two sets of the
accused, one was subsequently appointed on a high post in the
Directorate of Anti-Corruption probably as a reward for towing his

judicial authority with the wish and will of the investigating agency.

The two special Magistrates have acted the police way, knowing
well that the accused had remained for weeks in the custody of high
profile investigating agency but all of them were given half an hour
time to re-think and re-compose about the making of confession.
During half an hour time accused were made to sit in the retiring

rooms of the two Special Magistrates.

19. Another ludicrous mode adopted by the Magistrates was
that on each confessional statement of each accused, the signatures of
the Head of the J.I.T. were obtained. When confronted at the trial with
this novel procedure they adopted, an artificial explanation was given
to the effect that it was for the identification of the accused for making
confession before them. Every human being invariably has some

identification mark on his face, hands and trunk of the body which is
CrL.A. 218/15 etc. 12

always considered sufficient in this regard. The legitimate inference
would be that this abnormal course was adopted for the satisfaction of
the in-charge of the investigation. It is a classic example of violating

the most sacred judicial obligation and breach of duty.

20. Admittedly some of the accused were illiterate or under-
metric while some were speaking Pashto. Both the Magistrates could
not understand the words spoken by  them_~ but no
translator/interpreter was appointed within the meaning of Section 543
of Code of Criminal Procedure to record their statements in the words
exactly spoken by them. It is also strange enough that the
investigating officer recorded the statements of both the Magistrates
u/s 161 Cr.P.C. about the proceedings of the confession recorded by

them, a phenomenon absolutely alien to the judicial realm.

21. We are constrained to re-emphasize that this sacred
judicial obligation must be performed in a strict judicial manner
observing all safeguards and precautions as laid down in the High
Court Rules and Orders. Printed proforma containing questionnaire is
not to be used because it amounts to filling the blanks and is not in
accord with the requirements of law and rules. In view of the changing
trend of investigation, particularly in sensitive cases and keeping in
view the phenomenon of forced disappearance of people and because
in some cases the accused are not kept in the lock up of the notified
police station therefore, the following additional questions may be put
to accused person, when a situation of this nature arises, which is as
follows: -

(i) When and by whom you were arrested and

from which place?
CrL.A. 218/15 etc. 13
(ii) Where you were kept during custody by the
police/investigating agency?

(iii) Whether previously you were’ produced
before any other Magistrate for recording

confession and you had refused to confess?

22. The Government and all the State institutions charged with
such duty are required to chisel out the blunt tools i.e. the
investigating agencies and the prosecution to come to the expectations
of the people in the changed scenario. This requires allocation of
sufficient funds for the purpose to impart high skill and knowledge to
these agencies including training through foreign experts. At the same
time modern digital forensic labs/center of excellences in the provinces
and Federal Capital be established on urgent basis with highly qualified
staff on the subject of forensic science so that the real culprits
involved in such ruthless and detestable crimes are timely punished for
the crimes they commit. Even mobile, digital forensic laboratory be
provided as a back-up force to reach any place well in time to collect
forensic evidence from the crime scene and the surroundings. Simply
and exclusively relying on the armed forces and semi armed forces
killing the terrorists in encounter is not a complete solution to the
elimination of the monster evil of terrorism. The most effective tool is
the prevention of such crime. Effective and skillful investigation of the
same and efficient prosecution of the terrorist in judicial process
before the Anti-Terrorism Courts would suppress and eliminate this
menace of high magnitude, provided further that Anti-Terrorism Courts
are equipped with modern gadgets and all facilities provided and full
protection is given to the Presiding Judges of such courts, the

Prosecutors, Investigators and the Prosecution Witnesses. This would
CrL.A. 218/15 etc. 14

provide enough safeguards in recording of convictions in view of the

newly emerging situation in the country.

23. To prevent the occurrence of such crimes, the combined
network of all intelligence agencies shall be put into correct channel to
timely share the intelligence so collected. If the intelligence network is
properly organized and combined together it would effectively plug the
funding and secret financial sources now falling into the hands of the
terrorist organizations. It is also essential that security/guards
deployed on important installations, sensitive public places and State
institutions shall be provided modern arms & ammunitions with
protection gadgets so that they may be able to protect such
places/institutions, at random targeted by the terrorists. The amount
to be spent on such useful objectives would certainly minimize the
needed military operations going-on in the country at the heavy cost
from the public exchequer. The impossible would become possible if
the outreach of the agencies/law enforcing authorities is made
formidable and extraordinarily effective. The present system suffers
from many loopholes and deficiencies in many ways to counter the
menace of terrorism. All these suggestions and recommendations may
be forwarded to the concerned Divisions/Ministries and the
departments of the Provinces and those authorities who are assigned
the task to counter the terrorism and terrorist activities. If peace and
tranquility is fully restored it would definitely attract heavy investment

in the country.

After careful reappraisal of the evidence discussed above, we are
entertaining no amount of doubt that the prosecution has failed to
bring home guilt to the accused as the evidence furnished at the trial

is full of factual, legal defects and is bereft of legal worth/judicial
CrL.A. 218/15 etc. 15

efficacy, therefore, no reliance can be placed on the same. In view of
the above discussion, Jail Petitions No.249 and 454 of 2015 are
converted into appeals. All these three appeals including Crl. Appeal
No.218 of 2015 are allowed by extending benefit of doubt to all the
appellants and they are acquitted of all the charges leveled against
them.

These are the detailed reasons for our short order of even date,

which is reproduced below:-

“For reasons to be recorded later, Crl.Appeal No.218/15, filed by
Intekhab Ahmad Abbasi is allowed and for similar reasons, Jail Petition
No.249/15 filed by Zafar Ali and Jail Petition No.454/15 filed by
Muhammad Kabeer, Muhammad Ishaq, Qamar Zaman and Abid Khan
in case FIR No.291 dated 6.6.2018, registered by Police Station Sadiq
Abad, District Rawalpindi for crimes u/Ss.420, 468, 120-B/471 PPC
read with Ss.4 & 5 of the Explosive Substances Act and section 7 of
the ATA, are converted into appeals and accordingly allowed. All the
appellants are acquitted of all the charges leveled against them and all
the above named appellants be set free forthwith if not required in any

other case.”
