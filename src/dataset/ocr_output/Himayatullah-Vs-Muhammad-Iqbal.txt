JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, _J.- This

appeal is directed against the judgment dated 23.06.2009,
rendered by learned Senior Civil Judge/Judicial Magistrate
Charsadda whereby respondent-accused Muhammad Iqbal,
has been acquitted in case FIR No.563 dated 12.04.2004,
registered under section 489-F PPC, in Police Station
Charsadda.

2. Allegation against the respondent-accused
are that he handed over a cheque amounting to
Rs.2,50,000/- pertaining to Account No.8821871 of
National Bank Charsadda, to complainant Himayat Ullah
in respect of adjustment of some loan, but the same was
dishonoured from the concerned bank on its presentation
by complainant due to insufficient amount in the account

of the accused.

3. After completion of investigation challan
was submitted against the accused before the learned Trial
Court, where he was tried and ultimately acquitted vide
impugned judgment, hence, this appeal.

4. Learned counsel for the appellant argued that
appellant has proved the guilt of the accused/respondent
through cogent and confidence inspiring evidence but by
overlooking the same, the learned Trial Court reached to
erroneous conclusion by acquitting the respondent accused;
that about the disputed amount the appellant has also filed
a civil suit against the respondent-accused which has been
decreed in his favour; that the findings of the learned Trial
Court qua non-maintainability of criminal and civil
proceedings concurrently bout the same transaction, are
against the law as as there is no legal bar to the
maintainability of both such proceedings simultaneously
because criminal offence is altogether a different matter
from the civil liability. He sought reversal of the impugned
judgment.

5. Learned AAG supported the arguments of
learned counsel for the appellant to the extent of criminal
and civil proceedings concurrently about the same
transaction, he, however, fairly and frankly conceded that

the material evidence to prove that the accused/respondent

was legally authorized to issue the cheque on behalf
SHAMAL CONSTECH in his personal affairs has not
been put to the accused in his statement under section 342
Cr.P.C., benefit of which would definitely goes in favour
of the accused-respondent.

5. Learned counsel for the accused/respondent
contended that prosecution has miserably to prove the
account in respect of which the alleged cheque had been
issued to be the account of the accused; the decree passed
against the respondent by the learned Civil Court in respect
of the disputed amount has been set aside by the learned
Appeal Court/ District Judge-I Charsadda vide judgment
dated 07.04.2010. He produced attested copy of the
judgment of the appeal Court. He while supporting the
impugned judgment sought dismissal of the appeal.

6. Arguments heard and record perused.

7. It appears from the record that
accused/respondent was the director of a company known
as SHAMAL CONSTECH. As per partnership deed, the
said company was being run in the partnership of
two partners, namely, Mr. Iqbal Khan and Mr. Imtiaz
Ahmad. Account No.8821871 was opened in the name of
aforesaid compnay in National Bank of Pakistan

Charsadda. According to the partnership deed, the Bank

account of the company will be operated with joint
signatures of the two partners, named above. The cheque
in question has been allegedly handed over to the appellant
by respondent which pertains to account of the aforesaid
Company, but it does not bear the signatures of the two
partners. Nothing is on the record to prove that SHAMAL
CONSTECH had authorized the accused/respondent to
issue a cheque in his personal capacity. The controversy
about the loan of Rs.304000/- was allegedly between the
accused and the appellant and not between the appellant
and the Company. Though the memorandum governing the
rights of SHAMAL CONSTECH was produced during the
course of arguments, according to which any cheque issued
by the accused/ Director would be acceptable to the
Company, but neither the said document has been
exhibited during trial nor has the same been put to the
accused in his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. It is
settled law that any piece of evidence on which the
prosecution relies, if not put to an accused in his statement
under section 342 Cr.P.C., would be of no help for the
prosecution. Besides, the said document having been not
exhibited would have no evidentiary value. The grievance
of the petitioner is not against SHAMAL CONSTECH, but

against an individual/ accused, but he failed to prove the

account in respect of which the cheque in question has
been issued to be the personal account of the accused.
Rather sufficient material is available on record which
prove the account in question to be that of SHAMAL
CONSTECH Companby. Apart from above, according to
the condition No.4 of the partnership deed, the Bank
account of the company will be operated with joint
signatures of the two partners, but the cheque in question
does not bear any signature of the two partners named
above. None of these two partners has been examined to
support the version of the appellant or to justify the fact
that accused respondent was legally authorized to issue a
cheque from the account of the company in respect of his
personal affairs.

8. In view of the above discussed facts and
circumstances of the case in light of the available evidence,
prosecution has miserably failed to prove the guilt of the
accused/respondent. As regard civil suit filed by the
appellant against the respondent in respect of the same
transaction i.e. recovery of the disputed loan, no doubt, the
same had been decreed in his favour by the learned Trial
Court, but during the course of arguments, learned counsel
for the accused-respondent produced attested copy of

judgment of the learned Appellate Court/ Additional

District Judge-I, Charsadda, in C.A. No.62/13 decided on
07.04.2010, wherein the impugned judgment and decree of
the learned Trial Court/ Civil Court has been set aside.

9. The findings of the learned Trial Court qua
not maintainability of the criminal proceedings in presence
of civil proceedings about the same transaction, are
against the law because civil and criminal proceedings are
two different remedies provided by law having different
consequences therefore, both the remedies being not
overlapping can be simultaneously availed by a person
having right under the law. If different rights to commence
proceedings of civil or criminal nature has sprung up with
different results, those can be availed of, differently, and
maxim that a “a man should not be vexed twice”, would
not be applicable in such a situation.

10. In view of the above, the findings of the
learned Trial Court that “a man should not be vexed
twice”, being not applicable to the facts and circumstances
of the instant case are hereby set aside, while rest of the
findings qua acquittal of the accused/respondent are hereby
maintained. Resultantly, this appeal being without any
substance stands dismissed.
