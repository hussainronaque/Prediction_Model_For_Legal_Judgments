JUDGMENT

FAZAL_ SUBHAN, J.- Through instant criminal appeal, the
appellant has challenged the judgment dated 22.03.2022, passed by
the learned Additional Sessions Judge-II/Judge Model Criminal
Trial Court/Judge Special Court, Shabqadar, District Charsadda, to
the extent of confiscation of motorcar bearing Registration No.AGJ-
715/lslamabad.

2. Facts of the: case are that on 25.07.2020, the above said
motorcar was intercepted by the local Police of Police Station Sro
Kally, Charsadda, being driven by accused Malik Aman s/o Faqir
Hussain while co-accused Noor Zaman s/o Ali Zaman was present
on front seat and on the pointation of accused, four packets of chars,

total 4800 grams and four packets of opium, total 5100 grams were
recovered from left side back door of the motorcar and case FIR
No.207, dated 25.07.2020, under section 9-D CNSA was registered.
3. Record depicts that initially appellant applied for custody of
the vehicle before the learned trial Court/Additional Sessions Judge,
Shabqadar, but remained unsuccessful whereafter he filed criminal
appeal No.645-P/2020 before this Court, and on 14.12.2020,
directions to the following effect were issued:-

“The appellant candidly stated that he is
bonafide owner of the car in question and
was not in knowledge that the car would
be used for the commission of offence, as
the same has already been given to
Excellent Rent A Car. However, neither
the appellant has recorded his statement
under section 161 Cr.P.C, nor the owner
of the Rent A Car. Therefore, the
appellant shall record his statement
before the police that how the car under
consideration came in possession of the
accused. In this respect all the copies of
the relevant documents be handed over to
the police and statement of owner of the
Rent A Car be also recorded while after
recording statements of both, owner of
the Rent A Car as well as the appellant,
be submitted before this Court. Till then,
the case is adjourned.”

The available record, however suggest that no such exercise was
carried out because the statement of appellant and that of the owner
of Excellent Rent A Car, are not available on the record, however
certain documents are placed on file.

4. As per record, the accused of the case faced their trial and at
the conclusion of trial, the Special Court vide judgment dated

22.03.2022, convicted and sentenced the accused Malik Aman and
Noor Zaman, and through the same judgment, the motorcar in
question was ordered to be confiscated in favour of State which is
now impugned through this appeal.

5. After hearing arguments of learned counsel for appellant and
learned AAG for State, this Court is of the view that while passing
the impugned judgment to the extent of confiscation of motorcar
bearing Registration No.AGJ-715/Islamabad, the law on the subject
was not followed in its true spirit. Through Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Act No.XXXI of 2019, a new section 34B has been inserted to the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 2019
(hereinafter called -the Act), prescribing procedure for making
confiscation. The relevant section 34B(1)(2) and first proviso, being

more relevant, are reproduced for the sake of convenience and

understanding:-
34B. Procedure for making confiscation.--
2 (1) In the trial of offences under this Act,

whether the accused is convicted or
acquitted, the Special Court shall decide
whether any article frozen or seized in
connection with such offence is liable to
confiscation.

(2) Where any article seized under this
Act, appears to be liable to confiscation
under section 34A, but the person who
committed the offence, in connection
therewith, is not known or cannot be
found, the Special Court may inquire into
and decide such liability and may order
confiscation accordingly:

Provided that no order of confiscation of
an article shall be made until the expiry of
one month from the date of freezing or
seizure or without hearing any person
who may claim any right thereto and the
evidence, if any, which he produces in
respect of his claim:

An accumulative effect of the said provision is that when on
conclusion of trial the Special Court established under the Act has
come to the conclusion to pass an order of conviction or acquittal in
relation to the accused, it in all cases shall decide the fate of seized
articles (in the present case, vehicle) as to whether it/these are liable
to confiscation or otherwise. Before arriving to such a conclusion,
the Special Court may come across two kind of situations, firstly, if
owner of the seized article is not known or cannot be found, in that
case, the Special Court has to inquire the matter before passing an
order of confiscation, and secondly, if any person claim any right in
an article so seized or freezed, the Special Court shall provide him
an opportunity of hearing by recording evidence in support of his
claim, whereafter the fate of such article seized or frozen, shall be
decided. Due to the mandatory nature of the said provision, the
procedure laid down therein cannot be neglected or bypassed in any
manner, for simple reason, that non-compliance thereto may cause
immense loss to an innocent owner, who may not have any
knowledge of use of his vehicle in a crime. In the instant case
learned Special Court, before passing an order of confiscation, has

not observed the legal procedure contained in section 34B(2) first
provo of the Act despite the fact that the present appellant was
claiming ownership to the vehicle right from day one, hence the
confiscation order of the vehicle in question was illegal being
violative of the above said provision, hence by accepting this appeal
the impugned judgment to the extent of confiscation of vehicle in
question is set aside; the case is remanded to the trial Court with the
direction to adopt the proper procedure before passing any further
order. Needless to say that appellant shall be summoned and be

provided opportunity to record his evidence in support of his claim.
