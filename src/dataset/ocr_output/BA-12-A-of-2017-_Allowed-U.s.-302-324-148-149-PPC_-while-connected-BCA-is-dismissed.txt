SYED MUHAMMAD ATTIQUE SHAH, J.- Through this

single order, I intend to dispose of the present bail
application and the connected Cr.Mise. (BCA) No. 743-
A/2016 titled “Gul Khan Vs. The State & 07 others” as
both these matters are the outcome of one and same FIR
bearing No. 113 dated 01.07.2016 registered under
Sections 302 / 324 / 148 / 149 PPC at Police Station Pattan
District Kohistan. The petitioners of this petition namely,
Seerdad and Kareem Dad, are seeking their post arrest bail,
while the petitioner of the connected petition seeks
cancellation of bail granted to the accused-respondents,
seven in number.

2. Brief facts leading to the instant petition are that the
complainant, Gul Khan, while reporting the crime on the

fateful day at 19:15 hours alleged that he alongwith his
brothers Abdul Latif and Mehboob-ur-Rehman and his son
Usama had gone to the fountain for fetching water for [ftari
and when they reached near Power House Pattan, there they
came across the accused-petitioners and their co-accused
(respondents in the connected BCA) who started altercation
with them, followed by kicks, fists and stones blows, as a
result of which, Wali Dad, Khair Muhammad, Amir Zada
and Attique (accused-respondents of the connected BCA)
caught hold of Abdul Latif, brother of the complainant, and
the present accused-petitioner No.2 alongwith Mir Dad, co-
accused, had given him blows with knives and got him
injured. Similarly, Usama son of the complainant was
caught hold by Gul Dad, Hasnain, Alamzeb and Imran
(accused-respondents of the connected BCA) and was
given knives blows by Rahim Dad and Syed Anwar, co-
accused, with which he got injured, whereas his brother
Mehboob-ur-Rehman was caught hold by Rizwanullah
(accused-respondent of the connected BCA) and was given
knife blow by Gul Zada, co-accused, hence, the FIR ibid
was registered. Motive for the crime was stated to be
previous children’s quarrel.

3. Perusal of the record transpires that Imran,

accused of case FIR No. 113, too after his arrest lodged a
report vide FIR No. 118 on 02.07.2016 regarding the same
incident wherein he had charged not only the complainant
Gul Khan but his co-accused namely, Osama, Mateen,
Shehzada and Sher Muhammad. In that very transaction,
effective role of stabbing knives blows was attributed to
Shehzada and Osama.

4. Since in this case a fleet of accused have been
charged for stabbing knives blows not only to the deceased
then injured but the complainant and his son, therefore, first
of all the accused-respondents of the connected BCA,
seven in number, alongwith Said Noor, Gul Zada and
Rahim Dad have applied for their post arrest bail before the
learned Sessions Judge, Kohistan, who vide his order dated
21.09.2016 allowed bail to the accused-respondents and
declined the concession of bail to their co-accused, named
above. Thereafter, a bail petition was moved before this
court by the co-accused, which too met the same fate, thus,
lastly they approached to the Hon’ble Supreme Court of
Pakistan, where vide judgment dated 16.03.2017 the Apex
Court granted bail to Said Anwar and Raheem Dad while
refused the said concession to Gul Zada.

5. It is pertinent to mention here that the learned trial

court dismissed the plea of bail to the Said Anwar, Raheem
Dad and Gul Zada on the ground that they were attributed
specific role in the FIR, whereas this court too had declined
bail to them on the ground of being shared common
intention, while the Hon’ble Apex Court, allowing bail to
Said Anwar and Raheem Dad, has held that the question of
vicarious liability, if any, could only be decided by the
learned trial Court, however, refused bail to Gul Zada on
the ground that he was charged for causing injury on vital
part of the body of one of the injured PWs.

6. Here in this case a very intriguing aspect of the
matter is that in the FIR though effective role of stabbing
knives blows has been attributed to Seerdad and Kareem
Dad, the present accused-petitioners, but from bare reading
of the FIR it reveals that father name of Seerdad has been
shown as Attique while in the instant petition his father
name has been mentioned as Raqeeb.

7. According to the FIR the deceased then injured was
shown to have caught hold by Wali Dad, Khair
Muhammad, Amir Zada and Attique, whereas the accused-
petitioner No.1 and 2 were shown to have stabbed knives
blows on his head and stomach respectively, while the
medico-legal report is altogether different from the stance

of the complainant, taken in the FIR, because the injuries
have been shown as “an incised sharp wound 3 inches long
and ' inch in width of clear cut margins present just below
the interior border of it. Scapula on the back, an incised
sharp wound 1% x 2 inch with clear cut margin present on
the back, 4 inches below the wound in the same line, a
stitched wound present superficially on upper side of right
buttock, 1% inches long, a bruise of 2 inches x 2 inch on
the past aspect of left hand and small abrasions on anterior
aspect of right leg”.

8. Later on the complainant recorded his
supplementary statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C wherein
he has altered his stance by charging another accused
namely, Osama for the third injury on the right buttock of
the deceased, besides the accused-petitioners. The said
Osama was enlarged on bail by the court of learned
Sessions Judge Kohistan on 29.08.2016 for the reason that
his name was not mentioned anywhere in the FIR and no
BCA against him was moved. If the above statement of the
complainant is given worth, whereby another accused
namely, Osama was charged for effective knife blow on the
deceased, who was released on bail by the learned Sessions
Judge Kohistan, then on the ground of rule of consistency,

the accused-petitioners too deserve the concession of bail,
moreso, when no BCA has been moved by the complainant
against the release order of accused Osama.

9. Keeping in view the above glaring contradictions
between the medical evidence and ocular account coupled
with the change in the stance of complainant, Gul Khan, the
case of the accused-petitioners becomes one of further
enquiry and, as such, they are held entitled to the
concession of bail. Wisdom may be drawn from the case
law reported as 2017 SCMR 538 titled “Awal Khan & 07
others Vs. The State through AG KPK and another”.

10. So far as the bail cancellation application, moved by
the complainant of the case, against the accused-
respondents is concerned, not only in the FIR they have
been attributed the role of catching hold of the victims, but
the learned trial court, while deciding the bail matter, has
rightly held that vicarious liability within the meaning of
Section 149 PPC would be seen at the trial, thus, they were
held entitled to the concession of bail.

11. | Apart from the above, it is well settled principle of
law that provisions of section 497 (5) Cr.P.C were not
punitive in nature and there is no compulsion for cancelling
bail, unless bail granting order was patently illegal,

erroneous, factually incorrect and had resulted into
miscarriage of justice or where accused was found to be
making efforts to misuse the concession of bail by either
extending of threats or likelihood of tampering with
persecution evidence, which is not available in the case in
hand.

12. — Resultantly, this application for bail is allowed and
the connected bail cancellation application bearing No.743-
A/2016 stands dismissed. The petitioners Seerdad and
Kareem Dad are directed to be released on bail provided
each of them furnishes bail bonds in the sum of rupees two
lac (Rs.2,00,000/) with two sureties each in the like amount
to the satisfaction of Illaqa / Judicial Magistrate, who shall
ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men of
means.

Any observations recorded in this order, being
purely tentative in nature, shall in no way prejudice the
proceedings before the learned trial court where the case be
decided strictly on its own merits after recording evidence.

These are the detailed reasons for short order of the

even date.

Announced:
17.04.2017.
