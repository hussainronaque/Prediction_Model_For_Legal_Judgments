Dr. Khurshid Iqbal, J.-

1. This Criminal Appeal is directed against
the judgment of the learned Judge, Anti-Terrorism
Court-I], Malakand Division at Swat, dated

“U/s. 7 (ff) of the Anti-Terrorism Act,
1997, to undergo 14 years rigorous
imprisonment.”

The appellant was extended the benefit of

section 382-B, Cr. PC.

2 ~~, Facts of the case shortly are that on

15.04.2021, the complainant, Bahadar Khan, Inspector

(PW-2), received information that the appellant, Aftab,
had kept explosive substances in a rented shop situated

at Osak to Janjarait road of District Chitral. Pursuant to

such information, the complainant alongwith officials

of the CTD and police personnel searched the appellant

in the area. When he alongwith other officials reached
the Osak Bridge, he found the appellant there. His
body search was conducted, during which the
complainant recovered from him a citizenship card and
interrogated him on the spot. The appellant disclosed
himself to be a member of Jaish-e-Mohammed, a
proscribed organization. He also disclosed that he has
kept certain explosive substances in a rented shop. He
made pointation of the shop in question, wherefrom the
complainant recovered 12 plastic bags, containing
safety fuse in the shape of 95 bundles, each bundle,
having 230 meters of safety fuse and 6 plastic bags,
containing dynamite in the shape of 49 packets, each
packet of which having 39 dynamites. The complainant
prepared a memo of the recovery. He drafted Murasila
on which the instant case was registered against the

appellant in the Police Station.

3. After completion of investigation, challan

was submitted against the appellant before the learned
trial Court, whereas, against the absconding co-
accused, challan u/s. 512, Cr. P.C. was submitted.
Copies were supplied to him u/s. 265-C, Cr. PC.
Charge was farmed against him, to which he pleaded

not guilty and claimed trial.

4. The. prosecution examined as many as ten

(10) PWs. Statement of the appellant u/s. 342, Cr. PC,
was also recorded, in which he was afforded an
opportunity of evidence in defence and/or statements

on oath but he did not avail it.

5. After hearing arguments of the learned
P.P. and learned counsel for the appellant, the learned
trial Judge vide the impugned judgment dated
26.05.2022, convicted the appellant as mentioned in

para-1 of this judgment.

6, We have heard arguments of Mr. Sher
Muhammad Khan, learned counsel for the appellant
and Mr. Haq Nawaz, learned Assistant Advocate

General, for the State and perused the record.

7. To begin with, it is open to question as to
how Inspector Bahadar Khan/complainant (PW-2)
recognized the appellant when he came across him on
Osak Bridge. He mentioned in the Murasila that there
was spy information regarding the appellant. The
features of the appellant were not mentioned in the
Murasila. His testimony shows that when he,
alongwith other officials, reached the Osak Bridge, he

found the appellant, conducted his body search during

which he recovered from him a card showing that he

“ikdut Sabooh]* (0.8) HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NACEM ANWAR

was an Afghan citizen and interrogated him on the

spot. There is no mention whatsoever of the fact that
the appellant was the same person regarding whom he
had received spy information. It appears that it was per
chance that he found the appellant on the Osak Bridge.
It is further astonishing to note that the appellant very
quickly disclosed himself as a member of Jaish-e-
Mohammed, a proscribed organization, and further
disclosed that he has kept certain explosive substances
in a rented shop. Inspectors Gul Fazil Khan and
Meftah-ud-din (PWs-8 and 10), who conducted
investigation also did not attend to such key aspects of
the case as the appellant was in fact the same person
regarding whom there was a spy information, what was
his intention while he was allegedly keeping the
explosive substances in the rented shop and whether he
really belonged to the aforesaid proscribed
organization. Inspector Meftah-ud-din (PW-10) stated
even this much that he was handed over the
investigation at a later stage and that he never met the
appellant. It is beyond our understanding as to how did
he conduct the investigation when he did not
interrogate the appellant. It was also not investigated as
for what purpose the appellant, who according to the

prosecution version, is a resident of Dalazak road,

Peshawar, happened to be in Chitral. It needs no

emphasize that in an anti-terrorism case like this one,
these aspects were of fundamental importance to have
been investigated. By making no investigation in this
perspective, the prosecution failed to prove the charge
under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, coupled with the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa explosive substances Law. The
investigation, thus, could not be termed as specific and
even fair. The importance of fair and honest
investigation has been discussed by higher courts in
numerous cases, particularly in cases like the present
one. Reference may be made to a recent case of
Asadullah_ y. The State reported as 2022 P Cr. LJ
774 [Sindh]. In this case, a similar situation was before
the Court. A police official had received spy
information regarding a suspicious person, who came
across him. The suspected person disclosed his name.
His personal search led to recovery of a hand grenade
in the right pocket of his trouser as well as a
Kalashnikov without number and cash money. A case
was registered against him. The learned Court

observed:

“The 1.0. had also failed to interrogate the
appellant that with what intention,
appellant was carrying such explosive
substance.”

The learned Court further noted:

Mbdutt Sabook!* (D.B) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR, JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID [OBAL
-6-

“It appears to be very illogical that though
appellant being allegedly armed with
deadly weapons like Kalashnikov and
hand grenade but he did not resist and
calmly surrendered himself before the
police. Discrepancies pointed out by the
learned Counsel have created a reasonable
doubt in the case of the prosecution.”

8. Seeing the above infirmities being
material warranting acquittal, the learned Court relied
on Tariq Pervez v. The State (1995 SCMR 1345) and

referred its relevant paragraph as under:

“It is settled law that it is not necessary
that there should be many circumstances
creating doubts. If there is a single
circumstance, which creates reasonable
doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of
the accused, then the accused will be
entitled to the benefit not as a matter of
grace and concession but as a matter of
right.”

9. Reference may also be made to Chapter-
XXV (On Investigation) of Police Rules, 1934, Rule

25.2(3) read as under:

“25.2(3): It is the duty of an investigation
officer to find out the truth of the matter
under investigation. His object shall be to
discover the actual facts of the case and to
arrest the real offender of the case not
commit himself prematurely to any view of
the fact for or against any person.

This legal position was discussed in the
case of Muhammad Shah Khesro and another v.
The State and others reported as 2016 P Cr. LJ 606
[Peshawar]. The Court held that it is not the job of an
investigating officer to commit himself to the stance of

Abdut Sabouht* (0.8) HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAO NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID JOBAL

-7-
just one party, particularly of the prosecution. The law

requires that investigation shall be conducted honestly
and fairly on the basis of non-partisanship and
neutrality. The Court observed that it was for this
reason that the operation wing was separated from the
investigation wing under Article 18 of the Police
Order, 2002. This aspect has been analyzed by the
Courts in several other cases. Reference may be made
to the cases of Agha Qais v. The State reported as
2009 P Cr. LJ 1334 and Nazeer Ahmed v. The State
reported as PLD 2009 Karachi 191. In cases before
Police Order, 2002, for example, Ashig alias Kaloo v.
The State (1989 P Cr. LJ 601) [Federal Shariat
Court] and The State v. Bashir and others (PLD
1997 Supreme Court 408), it was opined that a police
officer could not be a complainant/raiding officer and
investigating officer at the same time. Although in the
instant case, two other police officers namely, Gul
Fazil Khan and  Méeftah-ud-din, conducted
investigation. It is fully established that the key
proceedings, such as search of the shop and the
recovery were effected by the PW Bahadar Khan
complainant and the other PWs, namely, Gul Fazil
Khan and Meftah-ud-din did not carry out any

meaningful investigation. Rather, they simply toed the

Abdul Sebook!* (D.B) ul ida AE R
a
-8-
line drawn by the complainant Bahadar Khan.

Reference may be made to the case of Taj Wali and 6
others _v. The State (PLD 2005 Karachi 128).
Although the investigating officers recorded the
statements of PWs w/s. 161, Cr. P.C., issued memo of
nomination of the appellant as an accused, obtained
warrants u/s. 204, and proclamation u/s. 87, Cr. P.C.,
against the acquitted co-accused and the CDR of the
appellant, however, key proceedings, such as, drafting
of the Murasila, the recovery memo and the sealing of
the explosive substances in parcel, were carried out by
PW Bahadar Khan complainant. All the PWs in the
case are police officials. It is a settled principle that
evidence of the police officials shall be scrutinized

closely and cautiously.

10. The next aspect of the prosecution case is
that the appellant allegedly took the police party to the
shop where he had kept the explosive substances in
question. Bahadar Khan (PW-2) recovered the
explosive substances in the presence of three marginal
witnesses, namely, $.1. Adil Ahmad Baig, constable
Zahir Khan and IHC Islam-ud-din. Amongst them
constable Islam-ud-din was produced as PW-3, who
confirmed his signature on the memo Ex PW 2/1, as

one of its marginal witnesses. Two points are worth

mentioning in respect of the recovery. Firstly, no

private witnesses were associated with the recovery
proceedings despite the fact that the recovery was
allegedly made from a shop, which required
association of private witnesses u/s. 103, Cr. P.C.
Secondly, it was not established that the shop from
which the recovery was made, was actually rented with
the appellant. The prosecution examined one Hazrat
Gul (PW-4), a tenant of one Wagar-ul-Mulk, a
landlord, under a rent deed. He deposed that he has
sublet the shop to the appellant through an oral
agreement. Thus, the prosecution failed to prove on the
basis of solid, cogent and convincing evidence that the
appellant was legally in possession of the shop. It is in
this perspective that the mere fact that the appellant
had a key of the shop at the relevant time is also not
believable, especially when there is no independent
witness of the recovery proceedings. Hazrat Gul
deposed that he pays the rent to the landlord Waqar-ul-
Mulk. He admitted that as a tenant, he could not rent
out the shop to another person. The I.Os did not inquire
through independent witness whether the appellant
carries out some business in the shop or not. The
evidence of the prosecution is silent on the fact as to

what else Bahadar Khan (PW-2), the complainant,

found in the shop other than the explosive substances,

as the site plan depicts two adjacent shops to the North
and South of the shop in question were found to be
vacant. The three shops are situated on the main Osak-
Janjarait road. Other shops also owned by Wagqar-ul-
Mulk were stated to exist though not specifically
shown. The appellant in his statement recorded uw/s.
342, Cr. P.C., specifically, denied any rent agreement

in respect of the shop.

11. For the reasons stated hereinabove, we
have reached to the conclusion that the prosecution has
failed to bring home the charge against the appellant.
Hence, we allow the instant appeal, set aside the
conviction and sentence of the appellant recoded by the
learned Judge, Anti-Terrorism Court-II, Malakand
Division at Swat, vide his judgment dated 26.05.2022
and acquit him of the charge leveled against him. He

be released forthwith, if not required in any other case.

12. These are the reasons of our short order of
the even date.
