YAHYA AFRIDI, J.- Mst. Sheerina, petitioner herein, seeks
bail in case FIR No.133 dated 04-05-2015 for an offence under
section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997

("CNSA") registered at Police Station Lachi in District Kohat.

2. As per contents of the FIR lodged on 04-05-2015 at
twelve noon, Saadat Khan SHO of Police Station Lachi
alongwith other police personnel were present for checking of
vehicles at Lachi Toll Plaza, where in a flying coach of white
colour, a veiled lady with a large plastic bag in her hand sitting
on the second seat behind the driver’s seat was de-boarded
and, on search of her bag by the lady police constable Saira
Bano, recovered five packets of ‘charas (Gardda)’, each

weighing one kilogram, therefrom. The accused-petitioner was
arrested on the spot and a ‘murasila’ was forwarded to the
concemed police station, where the present case under the

CNSA was registered against her.

3. Valuable arguments advanced by the learned
counsel for the parties were considered and the available

record perused.

4. Lest this Court passes any findings on the merits of
the case, which may prejudice the case of either party during
the trial, suffice it to state that in view of recovery effected
from the direct possession of the accused-petitioner, ‘prima
facie’, the accused-petitioner is connected with the
commission of offence, which falls within the Prohibitory
Clause of Section 497 of Cr.PC and hence, she is not entitled

to the concession of bail.

5. It would be worthwhile to mention at this stage
that this Court in the case reported as Iftikhar Khan Vs. State
(PLJ 2015 Cr.C. (Peshawar) 63), wherein the quantity of the
contraband had played a very crucial role determining the post
arrest bail of an accused, held that:

“Lest this Court passes any

findings, which may prejudice

the case of the parties during

trial, suffice it to state that
though the offence is not
bailable under Section 51 of the
CNSA but, keeping in view the
quantity of recovered
contraband, the petitioner is not
likely to get maximum
punishment provided in the
Statute because the quantum of
sentence has to commensurate
with the quantum of substance
recovered, if case against him is
proved at the trial. There is also
no evidence on record that
petitioner is a previous convict
or involved in similar cases.
Moreover, since this Court in
Cr.Misc.No.524-P/2014 decided
on 9-5-2014 has already granted
bail in 1200 grams heroin to the
petitioner herein, therefore, this
Court also follows the same.”

6. The Apex Court, however, has in a recent case,
while considering the offences punishable under the CNSA to
be heinous in nature against the society at large, repelled the
views of this Court in the above cited case in the judgment in
the case titled Socha Gul Vs. State (Cr.PLA No.15/2015) as
under:-

“It is pertinent to mention here
that offences punishable under
CNS Act of 1997 are by its nature
heinous and considered to be the
offences against the society at
large and it is for this reason that
the statute itself has provided a
note of caution under section 51
of CNS Act of 1997 before
enlarging an accused on bail in
the ordinary course. When we
refer to the standards set out
under section 497 Cr.PC for grant
of bail to an accused involved in
an offence under section 9(c) of
CNS Act of 1997, even on that
basis we find that an accused
charged with an _ offence,
prescribing various punishments,
as reproduced above, is not
entitled for grant of bail merely
on account of the nature or
quantity of narcotic substance,
being four kilograms. Firstly, as
deeper appreciation of evidence is
not permissible at bail stage and
secondly, in such _ situation,
looking to the peculiar features
and nature of the offence, the
trial Court may depart from the
normal standards prescribed in
the case of Ghulam Murtaza
(supra) and award him any other
legal punishment. Thus, in our
opinion, ratio of judgment in the
case of Ghulam Murtaza (supra)
is not relevant at bail state.”

7. Before parting with the order, this Court finds it
necessary to remind the trial Court that the observations
rendered by it while disposing of the bail application are not to
be considered during the trial of the accused. In this regard the
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in Shuaib Mehmood Butt
Vs. Iftekharul Hag (1996 SCMR 1854) has rendered clear
guidance, which is to the effect that:-

“However we would like to
point out in no certain terms
that the observations made by
the High Court in the orders
granting bail and by us in this
order are confined to tentative
assessment made for the
purpose of disposal of bail
applications and not intended
to influence the mind of the
trial court, which is free to
appraise the evidence strictly
according to its merits and the
law of the time of disposal of
the case, which of curse it is
needless to say, is the function
of the trial court”.

8. For the reasons stated hereinabove, the
application for bail being without substance is dismissed.
However, the trial Court is directed to conclude the trial of the

petitioner expeditiously.
