JUDGMENT

Date of hearing: 30.01.2023

Petitioner: (Fazal Subhan) by Miss Mehnaz, Advocate.

Respondents:- (respondents are not represented being
a motion case).

MUHAMMAD IJAZ KHAN J.- Through the instant

criminal revision petition, petitioner has challenged
the order and judgment of learned Additional

Sessions Judge 1* Bajaur dated 20.10.2022 whereby

. an application of the present petitioner for declaring

PW-12 namely Khan Badshah, ASI as hostile witness
has been dismissed.

2. Precisely the facts of the case are that an
FIR No. 131 dated 15.07.2020 under sections
302/324/34/337 A (i)/337 F (ii)/337-D PPC has been
registered against the accused/respondents No. 1 & 2
at police station Khar District Bajaur, whose trial is
in progress in the Court of learned Additional
Sessions Judge 1 Bajaur in which statements of
eleven (11) witnesses have so far been recorded and

the present controversy cropped up in the cross-

Nawab ($.8.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-2-

examination of PW-12 namely Khan Badshah, ASI
when he replied to the few questions of defence
counsel, which as per the wisdom and estimate of
the petitioner/ complainant would favour the defence,
therefore, he then and there requested to the trial
Court that the said witness be declared as hostile
witness and in this regard he also submitted an
application in which notice was given to the learned
District Public Prosecutor and after hearing both the
parties the said application was dismissed by the
learned trial Court vide the impugned order and
judgment dated 20.10.2022, which order has now
been challenged by the petitioner/complainant before
this Court through the instant petition.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for the
petitioner were heard in considerable detail and the
record perused with his able assistance.

4. The record would show _ that
petitioner/complainant has challenged the legality
and propriety of the impugned order dated
20.10.2022 whereby his application for declaring
PW-12 namely Khan Badshah, ASI as hostile witness
has been dismissed, therefore, the only question
before this Court would be that as to whether the
application filed by the present _petitioner/

Nawab (5.8.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-3-

complainant has rightly been dismissed and as to
whether PW-12 could be declared as hostile witness
during the course of his cross-examination or not? It is
relevant to mention that under Article 150 of The
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 any witness could be
declared as a hostile witness by the Court, the said
Article being relevant for the present controversy is
reproduced below;-

uestion by party to his own witness: The

Court may, in its discretion, permit the person who

calls a witness to put any questions to him, which

might be put in cross-examination by the adverse

party

The aforesaid Article unmistakably
confer discretion upon the trial Court to permit the
person who calls a witness to put any question to
him, which might be put in cross-examination by the
adverse party. There is no cavil with the aforesaid
mandate of the trial Court, however, the only
controversy in this case is that at what stage of the
proceedings a party who has called a witness is to be
permitted to put any question to such witness or in
other words when a witness could be declared as
hostile witness? It is relevant to mention here that in
this case PW-12 namely Khan Badshah, ASI is the
witness of prosecution and who recorded his
examination-in-chief which prima facie supporting

the version of the prosecution and thereafter the

Nawab (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad {Jaz Khan
-4-

defence started cross-examination of the aforesaid
witness of the prosecution and it was in the middle of
his cross-examination when the present petitioner
being complainant of the instant FIR made a request
to declare him as hostile witness, which request was
turned down by the learned trial Court vide the
impugned order and rightly so as it is settled that a
party can ask the Court to declare a witness as hostile
when it is his witness, however, when once he
complete the process of examination-in-chief and the
moment when the opposite party starts cross-
examination then such witness did not remain his
witness and thus at such stage (cross-examination) he
cannot ask the Court to declare him as a hostile
witness.

5. It may be clarified that a party can ask for
declaring the witness as hostile when the opposite
party has not started the cross-examination but when
once cross-examination starts or commence then such
request could not be entertained as after putting the
first question in the cross-examination the said witness
did not remain the witness of the prosecution or the
complainant, as the case may be. This Court in a
situation akin to the present one in the case of “Faisal
Khan v/s The State” reported as 2022 YLR 1341 has

held that there is no concept of declaring a

Nawab (5.8.) Hon’ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-5-

witness hostile during his cross-examination by the
defence. The right of cross-examination of defence is
very valuable right and if the witness knowingly or
otherwise in cross-examination makes a statement
which creates doubt qua the truthfulness of prosecution
case, the benefit of such doubt is always given to the
accused and cannot be withheld in favour of
prosecution. In the case of “Muhammad Boota &

another v/s The State & another” reported as 1984

SCMR_560@ it was held by Apex Court that a witness
who is unfavourable is not necessarily hostile, for a
hostile witness is one who from the manner in which
lie gives his evidence, shows that he is not desirous of
telling the truth to the Court ; that the witness's answer
to certain question is in direct conflict with evidence of
other witnesses and is not and can never be a reason for
allowing the witness to be treated as hostile and
permitted to be cross-examined However, section 154,
Evidence Act in no way fetters the discretion of the
Court to permit leading questions to be put by a party
to his own witnesses; the Court has unfettered
discretion to allow the prosecutor to cross-examine the
prosecution witnesses. Similarly, in the case of

“Muhammad Zafar & 04 other v/s The State &

another” reported as PLD 2013 Lahore 178 it was

held/observed by the Lahore High Court that the fact

Nawab (S.8.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-6-

that answers given by a witness to questions were in
direct conflict with the evidence of other witnesses was
not a reason for allowing the witness to be treated as
hostile and for getting permission to cross-examine
him.

6. In view of the above discussion and
exposition of law the impugned order and judgment of
learned trial Court is not open to any exception and

accordingly the instant petition being bereft of any merit is
