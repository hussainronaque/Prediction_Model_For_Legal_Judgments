FO 2 A ARO OR 2 OK

MUHAMMAD YOUNIS THAHEEM, J.--- Through the
instant criminal appeal, the appellant/accused Zakirullah has
challenged the conviction and sentence of imprisonment for
life awarded to him through impugned judgment dated
30.11.2013 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge-IX/
Judge Special Court (CNS), Peshawar with a fine of
Rs.100000/- or in default to undergo one year S.I. Benefit of
section 382-B Cr.PC was, however, extended to him.

2. Brief facts of the case as per prosecution

story are that on 28.05.2012 it was information to the

complainant Behram Khan S.I that today at any time
through Tractor trolley huge quantity of narcotics

would be smuggled from tribal area to settled area.

On this information he alongwith other contingents

made barricade near Mushtarzai Chowk Mil Dara;

that in the meanwhile a tractor trolley bearing

registration No.GAB 6707 came from Bara side

which was stopped, interrogated and the accused

who disclosed his name as Zakirullah alias Zakir.

On search of the said tractor trolley 62 packets of

charas pukhta was recovered beneath the frame in

the secret cavities. Each packet contained 1000

grams and total 62 KGs of charas was recovered.

The tractor trolley was taken into possession and the

accused was arrested, murasila was drafted and the

same was sent to the police station for the

registration of the case.

3. After registration of case, the case file

was handed over to the LO Liagat Ali Khan (PW3)

for the purpose of investigation. He went to the
spot, prepared the site plan EXPB in the presence of

complainant. The I.O also recorded the statement of

PWs u/s 161 Cr.PC. He also obtained custody of the

accused and recorded his statement u/s 161 Cr.PC.

After completion of investigation, the case file was

handed over to the SHO for onward submission.

4. On completion of investigation, complete
challan was submitted against the accused before the
Trial Court. Accused was summoned, who appeared and
provisions of section 265-C Cr.PC were complied with
charge was framed against the accused to which he did
not plead guilty and claimed trial. In support thereof, the
prosecution produced as many as 05 PWs, whose

statements were recorded and placed on file.

5. On close of the prosecution evidence,
statement of accused was recorded u/s 342 Cr.PC,
wherein he professed innocence and stated to has been
falsely implicated in the case. Neither he had wished to

produce evidence in defence, nor to examine himself on
oath as required u/s 340 (2) Cr.PC. The learned trial

Court on conclusion of trial convicted and sentenced him

for imprisonment of life, vide judgment impugned herein.

6. Learned counsel for the appellant/ accused

contended that he has been falsely implicated in the

instant case; that the learned trial Court has convicted the

appellant/accused on the basis of contradictory evidence

which creates many doubts and dents in the prosecution

case; that the learned trial Court has failed to appreciate

the fact that the alleged contrabands were not produced in

the Court, nor were exhibited in the case. He further

added that the vehicle which was used in the alleged

offence was not produced before the Court to determine

whether it contained secret cavities or not and lastly

prayed for setting aside the impugned judgment of trial

Curt and acquittal of appellant/ accused.

7. On the other hand learned AAG for the State

argued that the accused is directly charged in the FIR for

having 62 KGs of Charas pukhta in his Tractor trolley;

that the offence for which the accused was charged was
heinous in nature and the impact of the same is against

the whole society especially on youth. That the FSL

report was in positive and the evidence produced by the

prosecution has fully supported its version and prayed for

the dismissal of the instant appeal.

8. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties

heard and record carefully gone through.

9. Perusal of the record reveals that Behram

Khan, who is complainant of the instant case, was

examined as PW-1. He narrated the facts leading to

receipt of information, nakabandi, arrival of tractor

trolley, its search and recovery of 62 Kilogram Charas

beneath the trolley from its secret cavities, preparation of

recovery memo Ex: PW 1/1, separation of 5/5 gram from

each packet for sample. He also stated about drafting of

mursila Ex:PA/1 and application Ex:PW '% for sending

the samples to FSL. While investigation was conducted

by Liagat Ali SI, (PW-3) who on receipt of copy of FIR

proceeded to the spot, prepared site plan Ex:PB, recoded

statements of PWs under section 161 CrPC and drafted
application Ex:PW 3/1, collected information regarding

accused, as he was also involved in another same like

case vide mad report No.250, Ex:PW 3/2. He further

stated that he drafted application Ex:PW 3/3 for

verification of particulars to Motor Vehicle Registration

Authority; placed on file FSL report Ex:PZ, report of

tractor Ex:PZ/1 and after completion of investigation

forwarded the case to SHO Abidur Rehman Inspector

PW-4, for onward transmission.

10. So for as Ibne Abbas No.2304 is concerned,

he has been examined as PW-5 and he has stated in

support of the version of the seizing officer and admitted

the recovery memo Ex: PW 1/1 to be correct and

correctly bearing his signature.

11. Perusal of the record would show that

seizing officer, investigation officer and marginal witness

to the recovery memo were subjected to searching and

taxing cross-examination by the learned defence counsel,

but their testimony could not be shaken in any manner.

There is nothing in their cross-examination, which could
give an impression that he was involved falsely or the

matter was prompted by his enemies to foist such a huge

quantity of narcotics on him. In fact, the testimony of all

the three PWs is free from any material infirmity and in

line to the precaution case.

12. Report of FSL Ex:PZ is available on file and

it appears from the same that the stuff recovered from the

trolley of the appellant was in fact charas, hence, it has

been proved that the recovered stuff was charas and

nothing else.

13. So for as the question regarding conscious

knowledge is concerned, at the time of occurrence, the

appellant/ convict Zakirullah alias Zakir was present at

the driving seat of the vehicle, which was in his

possession and from its secrete cavities a huge quantity of

narcotics was recovered, hence it can easily be inferred

that the recovered stuff was his ownership and he was

having its conscious knowledge. The accused/ appellant

has failed to prove through evidence that he did not had

conscious knowledge of the same. In this regard reliance
is placed in case titled as “Billal Vs The State”, (2007

YLR 3096). The relevant Para of Judgment is reproduced

as:

“Nevertheless, it is different thing to
say that the prosecution should prove
that the accused was knowingly in
possession. It seems to us that by
virtue of section 29, the prosecution
has only to show by evidence that the
accused has dealt with the narcotic
substance or has physical custody of
the same or directly concerned with
it. Unless the accused proves by
preponderance of probability that he
did not knowingly or consciously
possess the article without such proof
the accused will be held guilty by
virtue of section 29 of the Act, 1997.
Reliance is placed on the case Inder
Sain Vs State of Punjab (AIR 1973
SC 2309).”

14. So for as contention of learned counsel for

appellant, that despite prior information no warrant was

obtained, suffice it to say that in such state of urgency

and exigency obtaining of search warrant would have

benefited the accused, as by then he would have escaped

and reached at his destination. Thus non-obtaining of
warrant becomes immaterial in such like situation.

Likewise compliance of section 103 Cr.P.C. has also been

dispensed with by virtue of section 25 of Control of

Narcotics Act, 1997 and the police officials are as good

witnesses, as private persons unless any animosity is

brought on record, but there is nothing on record nor even

a suggestion remotely on behalf of the appellant that he

has got any ill will or grudge with the prosecution

witnesses.

15. So far as contention of learned counsel for

the appellants that neither the recovery memo was

prepared at the spot nor the case property was sealed

there at the venue of occurrence is concerned, suffice it to

say that in view of the recovery of such a huge quantity

of narcotics, which too was very smartly paved in the

secrete cavities of Trolley and taking the vehicle

alongwith appellant to the Police Station concerned for

further proceedings and search would not amount any

illegality in prevailing law and order situation of the area,
-10-

for the purpose of thorough search by the seizing officer,

as he had no other option except above exercise.

16. In view of above, we have no doubt in our

mind that the charge against the appellant has been

proved beyond any shadow of doubt and that the

appellant has rightly been convicted. Learned counsel for

appellant could not point out any illegality, irregularity,

mis reading or non reading in the impugned judgment,

and sentence awarded to the appellant which could

warrant interference of this court. Learned trial court has

rightly appreciated the evidence and held guilty the

appellant for the offence. Wisdom is derived from the

judgment of Hon’able Supreme Court in case titled

“Tarig Mehmood Vs The State” (PLJ 2009 SC _ 113),

relevant Para is reproduced as below:

“The perusal of the record would not
show any legal or factual defect in
the current findings of the two courts
regarding the guilt of the appellant.
The Charas in huge quantity has
been recovered from the bag carried

by the appellant. The recovery was
-l1ll-

proved by the members of raiding
party, who had no personal reasons
to involve the appellant in a false
case. The explanation offered by the
appellant for false implication is not
plausible. The learned counsel for
the appellant has not been able to
point out any material discrepancy
and contradiction in the evidence
suggesting a slight doubt in the
prosecution case arising in favour of
appellant and consequently, we
would not take any exception to the

judgment of High Court.

17. For the reasons discussed above, this appeal

stands dismissed.

Announced.
