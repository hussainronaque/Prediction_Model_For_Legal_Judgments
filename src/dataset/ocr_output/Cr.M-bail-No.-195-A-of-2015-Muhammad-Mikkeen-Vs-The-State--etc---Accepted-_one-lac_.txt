Respondent...

QALANDAR_ALI_ KHAN, _J:- After

unsuccessful attempts to secure post
arrest bail from the two Courts below, the
petitioner, Muhammad  Miskeen, has
approached this Court for bail in case vide
FIR No.31 dated 05.02.2015 under
Sections 334/337-A(ii)/34 PPC Police
Station Darband, Mansehra, which was
lodged on the report of
complainant/respondent No.2, Haider
Zaman, who reported in the Police Station

about the injury caused to him on his
upper lip with axe blow’ by the
accused/petitioner thereby breaking his
upper teeth and also axe blow on the
middle finger of left hand of his daughter
in law, Mst Gulzar Bibi, by co-accused,
namely, Azim. The complainant also
alleged criminal intimidation by the
accused/petitioner and co-accused Azim
with their pistols. The complainant also
attributed kick and fist blows to other
unnamed co-accused and mentioned the
name of Miskeen son of Mir Ali and
Muhammad Yaqoob son of Ghulam Rasool
as eye witnesses in the FIR. The
motive/reason for the occurrence was
cited as complaint on 04.02.2015 by the
complainant to the accused/petitioner
regarding damage to the standing crop by
goats of the accused/petitioner.

2. During investigation, the
complainant was medically examined and

beside lacerated injury on upper lip and
bruises on gum of upper lip, with
underlying bone and gums visible, the
Medical Officer found upper five teeth
missing. The Medical Officer further found
bruises on left shoulder area of the
complainant, and referred the complainant
to King Abdullah Teaching Hospital for X-
Ray of the left shoulder as well as opinion
of the Dental Surgeon. Likewise, injured
Mst. Gulzar Bibi was also medically
examined and the Medical Officer found a
small simple lacerated injury on the left
big finger caused by blunt means. In the
King Abdullah Teaching Hospital,
Mansehra, besides cut on the upper lip,
radiographic examination showed 2/3 of
tooth present in the Socket of 3 upper

right side tooth.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for
the accused/petitioner, learned Assistant

Advocate General and learned counsel for
complainant/respondent No.2 heard, and
record perused.

4. As pointed out by the _ learned
counsel for accused/petitioner, the co-
accused and brother of the
accused/petitioner, namely, Azim has been
released on bail vide order of the learned
Sessions Judge Toor-Ghar at Oghi vide
order dated 31.03.2015, on the ground
that he was charged for causing injury on
the left hand of Mst Gulzar Bibi with Axe
blow, falling under Section 337-A (ii) PPC,
carrying maximum punishment of five
years imprisonment and_ thus falling
outside the prohibitory clause of Section
497 Cr.PC. However, the role assigned to
the accused/petitioner is a bit different as,
though charged for axe blow like co-
accused, but causing not only exposure of
underlying bone but also causing Itlaf of
tooth or teeth, falling under Section 337-U

PPC, carrying penalty of Arsh or Diyat if
itlaf of 20 or more teeth is caused. In any
case, section 334 PPC would not be
applicable as no case of Itlaf-i-udw i.e.
dismemberment, amputation or severing
of any limb or organ of body of the victim
is involved. The report of Dental Surgeon
is silent about missing upper 5 teeth,
which assumed significance in view of age
of the complainant i.e 70 years, thus
making case of the accused/petitioner that
of further inquiry. It has been held in 2005
YLR 1664 (Lahore) that “case under
Section 334 PPC was to be made out if any
organ or limb was amputated whereas
fingers of hand or toes or feet were not
organ, and similarly, teeth were not an
organ but whole jaw was an organ; case of
accused at the most fell under Secton-
337-U PPC.”

5. Besides, there is nothing on record
to suggest that the accused/petitioner is a

previous convict, habitual or hardened,
desperate or dangerous criminal. (2013
P.Cr.LJ 487 (Lahore) and 1999
P.Cr.LJ1668 (Peshawar).

6. Above all, investigation in the case
is complete, complete as challan has been
submitted in the case by the
police/prosecution on 02.04.2015, thus the
accused/petitioner is no longer required to
the police/prosecution for the purpose of
investigation.

7. Consequently, on the acceptance of
the petition, petitioner/accused is admitted
to bail subject to his furnishing bail bonds
in the sum of Rs.100,000/- with two
sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial
Magistrate. The sureties must be reliable
and men of means.
