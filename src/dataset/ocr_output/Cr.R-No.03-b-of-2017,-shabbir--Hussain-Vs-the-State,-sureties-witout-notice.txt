Vs
The State etc.

JUDGMENT

Date of hearing 17.04.2017

Appellant-Petitioner: Shabbir Hussain and Javed Khan by
Syed Umer Ali Shah Advocate.

Respondent: State by Shahid Hameed Qureshi, Addl: AG.

ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.--- Through instant criminal revision

petition, the petitioners have called in question the order dated

22.11.2016 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-

Il, Lakki Marwat, whereby bail bonds submitted by the

accused Umer Hayat, involved in case F.I.R No.165 dated

24.03.2014 under sections 9 CNSA, registered at Police

Station Serai Naurang, Lakki Marwat were forfeited in favour

of the State and petitioners being sureties were directed to
-2-

pay Rs.1,00,000-(one lac) each, the bail bond amount as

penalty.
2. Arguments heard and record perused.
3. Perusal of the record reveals that during trial,

accused Umer Hayat, he absented himself and

sureties/petitioners were summoned. On 22.11.2016 neither the

accused appeared nor his  sureties/petitioners put their

attendance, which resulted into forfeiture of bail bonds of

accused and the petitioners/sureties were held liable for

payment of Rs.100000/- (One lac) each, the bail bond amount.

The record is suggestive of the fact that no show-cause-notice

was issued to them albeit nor they were extended time to

produce the accused. On 22.11.2016, when the sureties of

accused were not in attendance, the learned trial court

straightaway passed impugned order for forfeiture of bail

bonds of accused and held the petitioners/sureties liable to

pay surety amount one lac each. The impugned order is

against the scheme of law relating to forfeiture of bond and

realization of amount as provided under section 514 Cr.PC,

which read as under:
-3-

514. Procedure on forfeiture of bond.
(1) Whenever it is proved to the
satisfaction of the Court by which a bond
under this Code has been taken, or of the

Court of a Magistrate of the first class,

or when the bond is for appearance
before a Court, to the satisfaction of such

Court.

that such bond has been forfeited, the
Court shall record the grounds of such
proof, and may call upon any person
bound by such bond to pay the penalty
thereof, or to show cause why it should

not be paid.

(2) If sufficient cause is not shown and
the penalty is not paid, the Court may
proceed to recover the same by issuing a
warrant for the attachment and sale of
the movable property belonging to such

person or his estate if he be dead.

(3) Such warrant may be executed within
the local limits of the jurisdiction of the
Court which issued it; and it shall
authorize the attachment and sale of any
movable property belonging to such
person without such _ limits, when
endorsed by the District Magistrate within
the local limits of whose jurisdiction such

property is found.
(4) If such penalty is not paid and cannot
be recovered by such attachment and sale,
the person so bound shall be liable, by
order of the Court which issued the
warrant, to imprisonment in the civil jail
for a term which may extend to six

months.

(5) The Court may at its discretion, remit
any portion of the penalty mentioned and

enforce payment in part only.

(6) Where a surety to a bond dies before
the bond is forfeited, his estate shall be
discharged from all liability in respect of
the bond.

(7) When any person who has furnished
security under section 107 or section 118
is convicted of an offence the commission
of which constitutes a breach of the
conditions of this bond, or of a bond
executed in lieu of his bond under section
514 B, a certified copy of the judgment of
the Court by which he was convicted of
such offence may be used as evidence in
proceedings under this section against his
surety, or sureties, and, if such certified
copy is so used, the Court shall presume
that such offence was committed by him

unless the contrary is proved.”
-5-

4. The above provision of law provides that it is

obligatory upon the Courts to first forfeit the bail bond, call

the surety/sureties bound by the bonds to show cause as to

why the penalty should not be paid by him/them and the

courts shall record the ground of such proof, while in the

instant case no show cause notices were issued to the sureties/

petitioners, that why the forfeited amount may not be realized

from them. It has not been mentioned that the bail bonds were

obtained by putting liability on the sureties/ petitioners

regarding appearance of accused. In absence of such notice,

the impugned order is liable to be set aside. In the case titled

“Shaukat_Ali_and another Vs the State” (1984 PCrLJ 718

Supreme Court (A J&K), it is held that:

“Moreover, section 514, Criminal
Procedure Code clearly contemplates that
final decision, regarding recovery of the
amount of the bond that has been
forfeited, should be made after issue of
notice to show cause why the amount
Should not be paid. Where show-cause
notice is issued but without such
show-cause notice being duly served, an
order for recovery is made, such an order

is not only contrary to the wholesome
-6-

provisions of section 514, Cr. P. C. but is
also in violation of the principle of
natural justice contained in the Latin
maxim : ‘audi alteram partem' which, in
fact, stems out from the principle of

Islamic Law’.

Similarly in case titled “Muhammad Siddique

khan Vs the State through Advocate-General Azad Jammu

and Kashmir, Muzaffarabad’ (2014 PCrl.J_33 Supreme

Court (AJ&K), it was held as under:

“The non-issuance of notice in absence
of prima facie proof will render the
proceedings liable to be set aside as laid
down in a case reported as Sanwan and
another v. The State (PLD 1965 (WP)
Karachi 516) wherein it has been

observed as under:--

"It is plain from a perusal of the
language of this section that it is
incumbent on a Court to first declare the
bond forfeit and to record the grounds for
such a finding before calling upon the
surety to pay the penalty thereof or to

show cause why it should not be paid."”

5. Accordingly this criminal revision is accepted

and order passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-II,
-7-

Lakki Marwat, is set aside. The case is remanded to the trial
court for decision afresh in accordance with law after
affording reasonable opportunity to the petitioners. Parties are
directed to appear before the learned trial court on 15.05.2017.

Announced.
