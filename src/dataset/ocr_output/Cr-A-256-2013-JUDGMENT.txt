Date ofhearing: 13.03.2018

Appellants: (Salim Khan and Azam Khan) By
Mr. Jalal-ud-Din Akbar Azam
Khan (Gara), Advocate.
(State) By Mian Arshad Jan,
AAG.
Mr. Saadatullah Khan Tangi,
Advocate, for complainant party.

Respondent:

ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- Through the
present criminal appeal, the appellants namely
Salim Khan and Azam Khan have impugned the
judgment dated 29.05.2013 of the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-V, Kohat vide which
they were convicted and sentenced as under:-

Under Section 302 (b) PPC: Life
imprisonment each with
compensation of Rs.2,50,000/- each
within the meaning of Section 544-A
Cr.P.C. or in default of payment 06
months S.I. and would be
recoverable as arrears of land
revenue.

2. The prosecution case, in brief, is that Naeem
Khan alias Khanoo, the deceased, then injured,

on 6.8.2011 at 7:30 p.m. reported to police at
2

Emergency Room KDA Hospital Kohat that on
the said date at 7:00 p.m. he was present in the
street known as “Charbagh”; in the meanwhile,
accused Rehmat alias Kakoo, (Respondent in
connected Cr. Appeal), Azam Khan, Salim Khan
(the appellants herein) and one unknown person,
came there and on seeing him started firing at
him, as a result thereof, he sustained injuries. The
motive attributed was previous blood feud. This
report was reduced in the shape of Murasila
(Ex.PW 4/1) which was later on incorporated in
F.LR. No. 459 dated 06.08.2011 (Ex.PA). The
complainant succumbed to the injuries on the
same day. Section of law was altered from 324
PPC to 302 PPC.

After carrying out the requisite investigation, case
was submitted for trial before Additional Sessions
Judge-V, Kohat against the appellants while
challan under Section 512 Cr.P.C. was submitted
against the absconding accused Rehmat alias
Kakoo. On 14.03.2012, the appellants were
formally charge sheeted to which they pleaded not

guilty and opted to face trial.
3

Tufail was not charged by name in the F.LR.
but was charged subsequently. He was acquitted
vide impugned judgment and no appeal has been
preferred against his acquittal.

In order to bring home charge, the prosecution
examined eight witnesses and there after the
appellants were examined under Section 342
Cr.P.C. wherein they also pleaded innocence.
They neither wished to be examined on oath nor
produced evidence in their defence. Consequently,
appellants were convicted and sentenced as
mentioned above.

We have heard arguments of the learned counsel
for the appellants, learned A.A.G. for the State
assisted by learned counsel for the complainant
and perused the record with their valuable
assistance.

The learned counsel for the appellants, inter

alia, submitted that the deceased, then
injured, was not in a position to make a
coherent statement because the alleged
dying declaration was recorded in the

hospital but even then, the same was neither
attested by the doctor nor any certificate
regarding the orientation and consciousness

of the deceased, then injured, is available on

the record, more so the medico legal
certificate is also mute regarding this aspect

of the case. He further submitted that there

is no other evidence except the so-called
dying declaration which is not getting
support from the medical evidence and other
circumstances of the case. He also added

that four persons are charged without any
specification of role and the dimension of

the three entry wounds are one and the same

size i.e. 1/8 x 1/8 inch. He lastly submitted

that even dying declaration and motive were

not put to the accused while he was being
examined under Section 342 Cr. P.C., the
same cannot be used against the appellants.

The learned A.A.G. assisted by counsel for the
complainant vehemently opposed the grounds
agitated by counsel for the appellants and
submitted that it is a daylight occurrence. The

deceased was in a position to make a coherent
5
statement; from the statement of the author of the
dying declaration, it is clear that the deceased was
in a position to make a coherent statement and the
same is supported by other circumstances of the
case, the cross report lodged by the appellants,
motive, conduct of the appellants and prayed for
dismissal of the appeal by supporting the
judgment of conviction.

In order to appraise dying declaration and its
worth, the superior Courts have laid down certain
criteria and amongst them the foremost ground for
believing the dying declaration is as to whether it
is established from the available evidence that at
the time of making statement the deceased was
capable of making such a statement. In this case,
the report of the deceased was recorded in the
emergency room of KDA Hospital Kohat by
Rafiullah ASI (Retired) PW-4 but ironically the
medico legal report Ex/PW 4/2 is silent regarding
the consciousness or otherwise of the deceased,
then injured, at that point of time, more so a
separate certificate and even endorsement on the

report of the deceased have not been taken from
6
the concerned medico legal officer to fortify the
stance of the prosecution that at the relevant time,
the deceased, then injured, was in a position to
make coherent statement. Wisdom is derived from

the case of Mst. Ghulam Zohra and another vs.

Malik Muhammad Sadig and another reported
in (1997 S C M R 449) wherein it was held by

the Apex Court:

“In the face of this medical
evidence, the learned Judges of
the High Court rightly observed
that it was the duty of the Police
Officer to have obtained a
certificate from the Doctor before
recording the statement of the
injured that he was in a fit
condition to give the statement.
Such a certificate admittedly was
not obtained and no reasonable
explanation for this omission was
given by the Police Officer. In the
circumstances, fitness of the
injured to make the statement
Exh.14 remained doubtful and
the High Court rightly so held.”

The same view was reiterated in case of Mst.

Miran _and_ another _vs. Abdur Rahim and

another reported in (PLJ 2004 SC 294).
Though at the trial, Dr. Fazal-ur-Rehman

appeared as PW-5. In cross examination, he stated
that the injured was conscious, well oriented and
was talking to him but he was further cross
examined and he stated that I have neither
mentioned this fact in my report nor he has any
reason to explain as to why he has not done so at
the time of his medico legal examination. This
appears to us that this witness has made an
abortive attempt to meet the question of
consciousness of the injured during the trial. Prior
to examination of this witness in the Court, there
is nothing on record from where it can be safely
said that the deceased, then injured, was in a
position to make coherent statement. The
documentary evidence i.e. medico legal evidence
and initial report (Murasila) recorded in the
hospital nowhere suggests that at the time of
lodging the report, the deceased, then injured, was
in a position to record his statement. Here we
have documentary evidence as mentioned above
in the shape of medico legal report/Murasila
wherein it figures nowhere that anything has been
mentioned regarding the condition of the

deceased, then injured. The attempt of PW-5 Dr.
8 7
Fazal-ur-Rehman is just an oral assertion, that too,
introduced during the course of cross examination
which in our view will not overcome the
documentary evidence prepared at the very initial
stage of the case. Almost in similar situation, the
same question has been dealt with by Apex Court

in case Azeem Khan and another vs Mujahid
Khan and others reported in (2016 SC MR

274) where a Magistrate who recorded a
confessional statement during the trial tried to
rectify the wrongs and illegalities which he had
committed while recording the said statement was
not relied upon by the Apex Court because the
documents which were produced did not contain
the said explanation. The relevant discussion is at
page 285 in paragraph 19 which is reproduced as
under:-

“At the trial, the Recording
Magistrate made crude
attempts to rectify the
wrong/illegalities, he had
committed in recording the
two confessions however, the
law of evidence is clear on this
point that documentary
evidence shall prevail over
the oral statement made
at a subsequent stage,
10.

contradicting the contents of
documents. Therefore, his
belated statement at the trial
cannot be safely relied upon.”
It is also in the prosecution evidence that at the
time of recording of the statement of the deceased,
then injured, private persons were also present
with him. Even assuming for a while that the
deceased then injured was in a position to make a
statement, the same was recorded in the presence
of the persons who were present at the relevant
time. In such circumstances, dying declaration
which is recorded in the presence of relatives or
for that matter, private persons who were present
with him, it cannot be ruled out that the names of
the accused were put in the mouth of the
deceased, then injured. In this regard, reference
can be made to Muhammad Latif and Another

vs Muhammad Hussain and 9 others (P L D

1970 Supreme Court 406) wherein it was held:

(a) Evidence Act (1 of 1872)---
--S.  32-Dying declaration—
Murder-All eye-witnesses present
in hospital when dying declaration
was being recorded-Possibility that
deceased was tutored by them
could not be ruled out.
11.

12.

All the three entry wounds sustained by deceased,
then injured, were of the one and the same
dimension i.e. 1/8 x 1/8 inch. It appears that it is
job of one person. However, in present case, three
persons were nominated by name and the fourth
unknown accused was charged. No empty was
recovered from the place of occurrence. Even in
the report-cum-dying declaration, the word Aslah
Aatasheen has been mentioned, no specific
weapon has been attributed to the accused. It
appears, this is a doing of one man, the charge has
been exaggerated and the dying declaration on
this score is liable to be thrown out of
consideration and in this regard, wisdom is

derived from Farman Ali vs The State (P L D

1980 Supreme Court 201).

The contention of the learned counsel for the
complainant and A.A.G. that cross report was
lodged on that particular day wherein the
appellants Salim and Tufail were injured and the
same establishes the presence of the appellants at

the relevant time, we are unable to subscribe to
11

these submissions of the learned A.A.G. and the
learned counsel for the complainant firstly on the
premise that no document of that case was
brought on the file of the present case by the
prosecution and secondly the same was not put to
the accused in their examination under Section
342 Cr.P.C. Furthermore, there is nothing on the
record of the present case in the shape of
document or ocular account regarding the nature
of the cross case. We are of the considered view
that the same cannot be looked into because it is
by now well settled that evidence of one case
cannot be read into another case unless that is
duly brought on record of the present case in
accordance with law. Reliance can be placed on
Wazid Moral alias Wazid Ali and 13 others vs
The State and another (1970 S C M R 256)
wherein the Apex Court held:

"This can hardly be considered to be

a satisfactory manner of disposing of

a criminal appeal on facts. It is a

well established rule that each

criminal case has to be decided upon

the basis of the evidence led in that

case. It cannot be disposed of merely

because the Court has im a
cross-case or in an appeal arising
14.

12

out of such a cross-case taken a

different view of the evidence in that

case. The High Court, clearly erred

in adopting such an unwarranted

procedure. It was incumbent upon it

to make its own independent

assessment of the evidence adduced

in the case in the other case as well."
Similar view was also expressed in case
Muhammad Gulzar _vs Muhammad Ashraf
and 3 others (PLJ 1981 Supreme Court 521).
For what has been discussed above and there is no
other evidence except the dying declaration which
suffers from patent and inherent infirmities, so in
our view, the prosecution case is pregnant with
inherent defects and material contradictions. The
prosecution has been miserably failed to prove its
case against the appellants beyond any reasonable
doubt and the appellants are entitled to the benefit
of doubt. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed,
conviction and sentence awarded to the appellants
are set aside and they are acquitted of the charges
leveled against them.

Above are the detailed reasons of our short order

dated 13.03.2018 which reads ad under:-
13

“For the reasons to be recorded later
on, this Cr. Appeal No. 256-P of 2013
is allowed, the conviction and
sentence of the appellants passed by
the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-V, Kohat on 29.5.2013 in case
F.LR. No. 459 dated 06.08.2011
under Sections 302/34 PPC Police
Station Jungle Khel, Kohat are set
aside and the appellants namely
Salim Khan and Azam Khan are
acquitted of the charges leveled
against them. They be set at liberty
forthwith if not required in any other

case.”
