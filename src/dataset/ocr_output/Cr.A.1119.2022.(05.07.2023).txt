S. M. ATTIQUE SHAH, J.- Appellant Junaid

Ahmad was charged for the murder of deceased Yahya, Mst.
Kainat, Mst. Eisha, minors Shoaib and Zohaib while acquitted
co-accused Ameer Khan was charged for abetment in the
commission of the offence. A case under sections 302 / 109 /
201 PPC was registered against them vide FIR No.286 dated
20.03.2018 in Police Station Chamkani, Peshawar. Likewise,
the appellant was separately charged under section 15 of the
Arms Act. Both of them were tried by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-XIX, Peshawar, who, on conclusion of the
proceedings / trial, convicted the appellant under Section
302(b) PPC and sentenced him to death on five counts as Tazir
with the direction to pay Rs.5,00,000/- to the legal heirs of the

deceased as compensation under Section 544-A, CrPC or in

default thereof to undergo six months S.I, however, co-
accused-respondent Ameer Khan was acquitted from the
charges levelled against him vide judgment dated 31.10.2022.
The appellant was also convicted under section 15 of the Arms
Act and sentenced to three years simple imprisonment with a
fine of Rs.5,000- or in default thereof to undergo two days S.I.
Benefit of section 382-B CrPC was, however, extended to him
by the learned trial court vide separate judgment of the even
date i.e. 31.10.2022. Against his convictions, the present
appellant filed the instant Criminal Appeal No.1119-P/2022
and connected Criminal Appeal No.1128-P/2022 while one
Fagir Muhammad, father of deceased Mst. Kainat and Mst.
Eisha, filed the connected Criminal Appeal No.1215-P/2022
against the acquittal of the acquitted co-accused. The learned
Trial Court has also forwarded Murder Reference within the
meaning of Section 374, CrPC. Since the appeals and murder
reference are interlinked with each other and outcome of the
same subject matter, therefore, these are being disposed of

through this single judgment.

Yahya where he found him murdered / killed alongwith his

The prosecution after abandoning the remaining PWs as
unnecessary closed the evidence on 26.07.2022. Out of them,
complainant Aurangzaib and PWs Shoaib and Tahseen Ullah

were abandoned being won over.

5. On conclusion of prosecution evidence, the
appellant and the acquitted co-accused were examined under
Section 342, CrPC on 01.08.2022 and 28.07.2022
respectively. They, in their statements, denied the charges,
levelled against them and pleaded innocence. They, however,
did not opt to lead any evidence in their defence or to appear

as their own witnesses in terms of Section 340(2), CrPC.
-9-

6. The learned Trial Court, after hearing the
arguments of both the parties and on appraisal of evidence,
convicted and sentenced the appellant as stated above while
acquitted co-accused Ameer Khan from the charges levelled
against him through the impugned judgment. Being aggrieved,
the appellant against his conviction and Faqir Hussain against
acquittal of acquitted co-accused have come to this court

through their respective appeals.

7. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
appellant by referring to the story narrated in the FIR and the
statements of the PWs recorded in the court, tried to project
the inference that the occurrence has not taken place in the
manner as described by the prosecution. They further
contended that it is an unseen occurrence and the charge at the
doorsteps of the appellant has been flung without any rhyme
or reason. The story, they added, also appears to be
improbable if seen in the light of statements of material
witnesses as well as medical evidence. The learned counsel by
referring to star witnesses of the prosecution namely,
Aurangzaib, complainant as well as Shoaib and Tahseen,
witnesses of recovery memo whereby fingerprints from the
spot were lifted, who were abandoned, tried to canvass at the
bar that they could have furnished actual story but their non-
production would not only militate against the veracity of the

prosecution version but also give rise to the inference that they
-10-

would have gone against the prosecution if they were
produced. They further contended that one Muntazir, in whose
name the suspected mobile number, was registered, was
neither made an accused nor prosecution witness in the case,
which itself raise eyebrow about the performance of the
investigating officers. Next argued that chain of the
circumstantial evidence is totally incomplete as fingerprints
were not lifted/secured as per standard protocols and likewise
the alleged pistol was not sealed in proper manner, then, what
to talk of evidentiary value of the same. The learned counsel,
by concluding their arguments, contended that the conviction
and sentences recorded on the basis of doubtful evidence

cannot be maintained.

8. As against that the learned Assistant Advocate
General appearing on behalf of the State duly assisted by the
learned counsel representing the father of the deceased ladies
vehemently argued that it is the case of circumstantial
evidence and the entire chain in the shape of recoveries,
fingerprints, CDR data etc., is complete insofar as the
involvement of the appellant and the acquitted co-accused is
concerned as such being consistent and confidence inspiring,
has rightly been relied upon by the learned Trial Court. By
referring to the contradictions, they contended, that the minor
discrepancies may occur in the statements of the witnesses

who are perfectly honest. Above all, they, by concluding their
-11-

arguments, contended that unexplained absconsion of the
appellant after the occurrence and despite being sole male
member of his family after the murder of his brother, sister-in-
law, two minors and sister-in-law of his brother would plug all
the loopholes, if any, in the prosecution evidence and bring
guilt home to the appellant beyond any shadow of reasonable
doubt. They by concluding their arguments submitted that the
learned Trial Court has rightly awarded death sentence to the
appellant, therefore, it does not call for any leniency or
interference in the well-reasoned judgment of the learned Trial
Court. In the same breath, the learned counsel representing the
father of the deceased ladies vehemently opposed the acquittal
of acquitted co-accused as he was the person, who actually,
responsible for the entire tragedy and without his facilitation /
help / assistance / connivance, the appellant was not able to
even think such like brutal act, and as such, he was liable to be
given full doze, which fact has not properly been appreciated
by the learned trial court while acquitting him from the

charges levelled against him.

9. Heard. Record perused.

10. Instant case is the result of an unfortunate unseen
occurrence in which five persons, three major and two minors
of one and the same family have lost their precious lives who
are closely related to the appellant, therefore, we are under

legal obligation to carefully re-appraise and analyze the entire
-12-

evidence so brought on record by the prosecution in order to
arrive to a proper conclusion qua the conviction and sentence
of the appellant as on one hand, three young persons and two
minors had lost their valuable lives while on the other hand a
young man, who happens to be their close relative i.e. brother
of deceased Yahya has been awarded death sentence on five
counts.

The inter se relation of the parties is as under:-

Deceased Yahya Appellant Junaid

Deceased Yahya and | With | Acquitted co-accused | Brothers-in-law.
appellant Junaid Ameer (husband of

(brothers of  Mst. Mst. Nihayat).
Nihayat)

Deceased Mst. Kainat Daughters
& Mst. Eisha | With PW Fagqir Hussain

Deceased minors Maternal
Shoaib and Zohaib Grandchildren

Deceased Yahya & With | Complaint Aurangzaib | Nephews
appellant Junaid

11. According to the prosecution version,

complainant Aurangzaib (abandoned PW) on the fateful day
on the receipt of information qua the commission of the
offence rushed to the house of his nephew deceased Yahya
where he found him dead along with his wife Mst. Kainat,
sister-in-law Mst. Eisha and two minor sons Shoaib and
Zohaib. The complainant neither was present on the spot nor

had witnessed the occurrence with his own eyes and as such
-13-

he is not the eyewitness of the crime and that is how he
charged some unknown culprits for the crime in his initial
report, which was lodged in the shape of murasila Ex.PA/1 by
PW Khan Zaib SI, contents whereof were reduced into FIR

vide Ex.PW-13/1.

12. The role of the complainant in the entire episode
is nothing but only as an informer. However, the record is
completely silent that, who was the person, who first seen the
occurrence and informed the complainant about the sad
incident. No investigation in this respect had been carried out
by the IO of the case nor the complainant disclosed his source
of information in his initial report and in his magisterial
statement as well, as such, identification of such an important
person is still a mystery and its credit definitely goes to the
investigating officers, who did not bother to trace him out.
Such fact was also established from the cross-examination of
Khan Zaib SI (PW-6) in the manner: -

It is a fact that as per the Murasila Ex.PA/1, the
complainant himself is not the eyewitness of
occurrence. It is also correct that as per
Murasila, it is not mentioned that who informed

the complainant regarding the occurrence.
13. In fact, the case of prosecution is fully based
upon circumstantial evidence, as the occurrence is un-
witnessed one. What tempts the Court to believe this type of
evidence is based upon the maxim that men may lie but

circumstances cannot. We rather use this centuries-old
-14-

wisdom as a touchstone for assessing and evaluating the
evidentiary worth of the circumstantial evidence. Inference
about the guilt of the accused could well be drawn from the
circumstances as are well authenticated. But where the
circumstances so reported are tampered with or manufactured
and fabricated, then the same cannot be accepted without
careful and critical analysis. We are mindful of the fact that in
such like cases, for the conviction of an accused exclusively
on the basis of circumstantial evidence, the circumstances
proved in the case must be irreconcilable with his innocence
and the chain of circumstances must be so strong as to rule out
any reasonable hypothesis of his innocence and certainly such
chain requires to start from the body of the deceased and stop
on the neck of the accused in an unbroken manner. Indeed, in
the absence of such an unbroken chain, it would be extremely
risky rather hazardous to rely upon such circumstantial
evidence, which is not of high standard and quality and as
such, the courts are supposed to take extraordinary care and
caution before relying on the same, particularly by imposing a
death penalty on an accused. Azeem Khan & another vs.
Mujahid Khan & others (2016 SCMR 274); Nasir Javaid &
another vs. State (2016 SCMR 1144) and Ayesha Khatun &

another vs. State [1968 PCrLJ (Dacca) 53].

14. In the case in hand, after the registration of the

FIR Ex.PW-13/1 on 20.03.2018, the investigating officer spur
-15-

into action to nab the actual culprits, started the investigation
through different angles being a blind occurrence and that is
how adopted a scientific manner for securing fingerprints from

the spot.

15, On 20.03.2018, the date when the occurrence
took place, the Incharge Crime Scene Unit lifted the
fingerprints from the backdoor of the house of deceased
Yahya and secured the same through the scotch tape in
presence of two witnesses namely, Tehsin Ullah Jan and
Muhammad Shoaib, vide Ex.PW-9/2. However, neither the
aforesaid Incharge was cited as witness nor was examined
before the court and it is also remained a mystery that who
called the Crime Science Unit to the spot; who secured the
fingerprints and whether he was competent enough to do so or
otherwise. When the star person who lifted / secured the
alleged fingerprints from the crime scene was not produced
before the court to be confronted with such evidence, then, a
mere positive report of such fingerprints is not sufficient for
maintaining conviction under capital charge. State vs. Ilam

Din & another [1986 PCrLJ (Lahore) 2072].

Perusal of the ibid memo clearly shows that none of the
police officials was present at that time during such
proceedings that is how the private persons were cited as
marginal witnesses of the fingerprints, lifted / secured from

the spot. Rather under prescribed rules, it was the bounden
-16-

duty of the investigating officer to call the mobile forensic lab
to respond to the crime scene, which was supposed to work
under his supervision insofar as collecting and securing of
fingerprints and gathering of other circumstantial evidence
from the spot is concerned, but in the case in hand, he did not
do so that is how only private persons namely, Tehsin Ullah
Jan and Muhammad Shoaib were cited as marginal witnesses
of the fingerprints, who too were abandoned by the
prosecution being won over, more-so, they did not disclose the
factum of securing of the fingerprints from the crime scene
which fact is also evident from the testimony of Munir Khan
Inspector / IO (PW-4) wherein, he clearly admitted that:-

I have recorded the statement of one Shoaib S/O
Fazal Elahi u/s 161 CrPC who does not mention
regarding the fingerprints has been recovered /

secured in his presence.

16. We have before us the site plan Ex.PW-9/1 and
have perused the same carefully time and again with the
support of the learned counsel representing the parties and the
worthy AAG for our own satisfaction but we are unable to
find a single word or sketch, which could disclose that indeed
the alleged fingerprints were lifted / secured from the crime
scene by any official in presence of any witness. Meaning
thereby that the site plan, which is most essential piece of
evidence does not support the prosecution version to that

extent. Such fact has also been confirmed from the cross-
-17-

examination of Shaukat Ullah, SI / IO (PW-9) in the following
manner:-

It is a fact that the finger prints were not
Secured by me from the spot rather the same
were secured by the official of the crime scene
expert. The presence of crime scene officials
have not been shown by me in the site plan. It is
correct to suggest that I have not recorded the
Statement of crime scene officials nor their
names and numbers of the said officials are

available on the record.

Further admitted that:-

It is correct that I have not mentioned as to
where from the fingerprints were taken

specifically.

With regard to the point where from the finger prints
were lifted, this PW stated that:-

As per my investigation, the fingerprints were
obtained from the main gate, rooms and

veranda.

But as against that, the memo Ex.PW-9/2 (the word
Ex.PW-9/2 has inadvertently been not mentioned), reveals that
the alleged fingerprints were lifted / secured from the

backdoor of the house of the deceased.

17. Moreover, if at all, the fingerprints were actually
lifted / secured from the spot by any official / authority in the
presence of witnesses, then, the aforesaid witness namely,

Shoaib would have definitely disclosed such factum to the
-18-

investigating officer while recording his statement under
section 161 CrPC, which is not the case in hand. The non-
examination of the marginal witnesses including the
complainant would certainly hit by the mischief of the
provision of Article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984, and as such an adverse inference would be drawn that
had those witnesses been examined before the court they
would not have supported the stance of the prosecution. Farid

Bakhsh vs. Jind Wadda & others (2015 SCMR 1044).

18. Likewise, regarding the fingerprints of the
appellant, it is evident from the record that after his arrest, his
fingerprints were obtained / secured by Munir Khan Inspector
/ TO (PW-4) on 23.03.2018 but as against that the same were
received by the FSL on 26.03.2018 as is evident from the
report Ex.PW-4/11. This fact was also affirmed by the said
PW in his cross-examination, wherein he admitted that:-
Accused was arrested on 23.03.2018 whereas the
fingerprints were sent to FSL on 26.03.2018,
however, I have not offered any explanation
regarding the delay.
19. No doubt, opinion of the Fingerprint Expert
Ex.PW-4/11 may point towards the complicity of the appellant
in the alleged commission of the offence but simultaneously
we cannot shut our eyes from the fact that the fingerprints of
the appellant were not taken/secured in proper mode and

manner as there is nothing on the record that in whose
-19-

presence, the investigating officer has taken/secured such
fingerprints and who was the person/official, through whom,
the same were sent to the laboratory for analysis and in whose
custody the same were lying/kept during the intervening
period as the record is completely silent in this respect. The IO
was also required to have obtained the fingerprints of the
appellant through Judicial Magistrate or fingerprints expert in
the presence of witnesses and certainly in absence of such
legal requirement the positive report of fingerprints is of no
avail to the prosecution. Besides, no answer much less
satisfactory comes forth regarding non-securing such evidence
in accordance with the mandate provided by the law, then, in
that case, the fingerprints evidence by itself cannot
constitute/establish a solid ground/basis for recording or
upholding/maintaining the conviction of the appellant even in
presence of positive report of the Firearms Expert
notwithstanding such type of evidence can be cooked up by
the investigating agency at later stage. Bahader Khan vs.

State [2012 PCrLJ (Peshawar) 24].

20. So far as the date of arrest of the appellant is
concerned, suffice it to say that, we have before us two
samples of his fingerprints i.e. Ex.PW-9/3 & Ex.PW-9/4,
allegedly collected / secured by Munir Khan Inspector (PW-4)
after the arrest of the appellant. However, Ex.PW-9/3 shown

the date of his arrest as 23.03.2018 while that of as per
-20-

Ex.PW-9/4 is 20.03.2018. Meaning thereby that the appellant
was arrested on 20.03.2018 but as against that, his card of
arrest Ex.PW-6/2 shown his arrest on 23.03.2018. When so,
how the investigating officer could able to secure the
fingerprints of the appellant much prior to his alleged arrest,
which has indeed disputed his alleged arrest and securing of
his fingerprints. Such fact is also strengthened from the
statement of Fagir Hussain (PW-8), father of both the
deceased ladies, who in his cross-examination categorically
admitted that:-
“My statement was recorded after three days of
the arrest of the accused facing trial. Self stated
that in P.S Chamkani the police shown me the
accused and told me that they are your culprits.”
Magisterial statement of this PW was recorded on
24.03.2018 and hope so his police statement was recorded on
the same very date or one day prior to it, then it reflects that
the appellant was arrested on 20.03.2018 and not on
23.03.2018, as alleged by the prosecution. Moreover, as per
Nagal Mad No.38 dated 23.03.2018, both the accused were
allegedly present at the place, where from they were shown
arrested by Khan Zaib SI (PW-6) but, interestingly, neither, on
seeing the police party, they made any effort to flee away from
the spot nor have showed any resistance to them, in spite of
the fact that the appellant was allegedly duly armed with a

pistol of 9mm and was standing in front of the police party
-21-

like a ‘Statue’ so as to arrest him. Rather he was having ample
opportunity to conceal or destroy each and every piece of
evidence or to throw the alleged weapon of offence anywhere
in the field, water canal, well or other place after the alleged
commission ‘of the offence instead of choosing to keep the

crime weapon with him.

21. Another important feature of the case is that, as
stated above, undoubtedly, Khan Zaib, SI (PW-6) had arrested
the appellant along with pistol of 9mm and live rounds but
strangely, this witness somehow did not disclose such arrest
and recovery while recording his statement as PW-6 and that
is how, to fill up such lacuna, he was recalled and accordingly
reexamined as RePW-6 with regard to the alleged arrest and
recovery. Moreover, the pistol was allegedly recovered. from
the possession of the appellant at the time of his arrest on
23.03.2018 but interestingly it was not sealed on the spot
which fact has also been admitted by this PW in his testimony.
Likewise, the same was sent to firearms expert for analysis on
30.03.2018 and even during the intervening period, the same
was not in sealed condition as is evident from the cross-
examination of Khan Zaib SI (PW-6), wherein he admitted
that:-

It is a fact that as per recovery memo Ex.RePW-
6/1 there is no mentioned that whether the same
was sealed or not. Self-stated that I handed over

the pistol to IO in open condition. In memo
-22-
Ex.RePW-6/1 I have not mentioned the place of
the recovery of the pistol.

This fact was also admitted by Kaleem Ullah Constable
(PW-11) in whose presence the arrest and recovery was made.
The relevant portion is as under:-

It is correct that the whole time of possession of
the pistol by us, it was lying in open condition.

Such fact was also affirmed by Munir Khan Inspector /
IO (PW-4) in his cross-examination in the following manner:-

The pistol in question was not sealed by the PW
Khanzeb rather the same was handed over to me

in open condition.

It is correct that I have recorded statement of
PW Khanzeb which does not mention a time and

place of recovery of pistol.

Further admitted that:-
I have not recorded statement of Muharrir
regarding the depositing of the case property
in store room or entry of the same in register
No.19 as well as there is nothing about the
safe custody of the case property. It is a fact
that no evidence has been brought by me on
the record of the case that with whom the case

property was lying.
22. Moreover, nothing satisfactory has come forth to
show plausible reasons for such delay in sending the alleged
crime weapon to the FSL or who dispatched the same for
analysis/opinion insofar as the prosecution evidence is

concerned. Being so, the safe custody of the recovered articles
-23-

is highly doubtful and even possibility could not be excluded
of its having been tampered with, which fact goes to the very
roots of the prosecution case. Hence, the recovery of pistol
and Firearms Expert’s repot were unworthy of reliance in the
given facts and circumstances of the case. Muhammad
Saleem vs. Shabbir Ahmad (2016 SCMR 1605); Zahid
Hussain & others vs. State [2020 YLR Note 102 (Federal
Shariat Court)] & Muhammad Karim vs. State & another

[2022 MLD (Peshawar) 1097].

23. Assuming for the sake of arguments that if at all
the recovery of pistol was actually effected from the
possession of the appellant at the time of his arrest on
23.03.2018, then, pursuant thereto a separate FIR on the same
very date should have been registered against him but in the
case in hand, no separate FIR was lodged to that extent rather
addition of section 15 of the Arms Act was made in the
existing FIR, which was indeed of dated 20.03.2018, which is
certainly beyond comprehension in the attending

circumstances of the case.

Now we are facing with two conflict situations, if we
take into account the aforesaid date i.e. 20.03.2018 as date of
arrest and recovery of the appellant, then, Naqal Mad No.38
dated 23.03.2018 and his card of arrest Ex.PW-6/2 would be

of no legal sanctity and the entire case of the prosecution
Ve

-24-

story, when seen in this backdrop, would fall like a house of
cards notwithstanding date of recovery of the alleged pistol
has been mentioned as 20.03.2018 in the charge sheet dated
07.09.2019, which of course raise the eyebrows in the given

circumstances.

24. Another striking aspect of the case is that though
as per memo Ex.PW-4/5, a mobile of one Muntazir was found
to be suspected one but as against that, neither the said person
was made an accused nor a prosecution witness and to this
effect no plausible explanation has come forth on behalf of the
prosecution. The ibid memo revels that it was exhibited in the
statement of PW-4 Munir Khan Inspector. The examination-
in-chief of the said PW was recorded in two parts one on
26.01.2021 and second on 28.04.2022 while the date of
exhibition, mentioned in the ibid memo is 28.06.2021. Even
the entire statement of the said PW did not disclose an oblique
reference to that memo, which negligence also goes to the

prosecution.

25. Now coming to the medical evidence. The
autopsies of deceased Yahya, Zohaib and Shoaib were
conducted by Dr. Mian Saad Ahmad, Assistant Professor
(PW-12) between 4.30 a.m. to 5.00 a.m. vide postmortem
reports Ex.PM/2, Ex.PM/3 & PM/4 while those of deceased
Mst. Eisha and Mst. Kainat were conducted by Dr. Saima

Noreen, TMO (PW-5) between 5.15 a.m. to 5.30 a.m. vide
-25-

postmortem reports Ex.PM & Ex.PM/1. When we minutely
peruse the postmortem reports of all the deceased, the same
reveal that time between their injury and death is
“Immediate”. However, the time between deaths and
postmortems of the two ladies and two minors deceased is one
and the same i.e. 4—8 hours while that of deceased Yahya is
2—4 hours. This fact has been affirmed by Dr. Mian Saad
Ahmad (PW-12) in his cross-examination in the following
manner:-

It is correct that there is a possibility of 08 hours
gap between death and postmortem examination
of deceased Sohaib and Zohaib.

Likewise, Dr. Saima Noreen (PW-5) also affirmed such
fact in the following term:-

The time elapsed between death and postmortem

of both the deceased was 04 to 08 hours.

Meaning thereby that the occurrence had not taken
place in one row as alleged by the prosecution rather deceased
Yahya was done to death much after the murder of two ladies
and two minors and in that event, he might have raised some
resistance or for that matter tried his level best to save the
lives of his other inmates but the prosecution story is

altogether different from it.

26. So far as the alleged CDR data is concerned,
might be some conversation was made by the appellant with

the acquitted co-accused in the crucial dates but it would be
-26-

natural fact in view of their inter se relationship, as hinted to
above in the earlier paragraphs of the judgment, as such, the
same data would not be sufficient for awarding conviction to
the appellant that too when the other material facts do not

support the prosecution version.

27. No doubt, the motive for such a brutal murder of
five innocent persons alleged to have some domestic dispute
but no investigation in this respect has been conducted by any
of the investigating officers as such they miserably failed to
bring on the record actual motive/reasons of the alleged
occurrence. Even one Nihayat, who happens to be the sister of
the appellant and deceased Yahya, was not produced before
the court so as to give actual account of the alleged dispute, as
such false implication of the appellant in untraced case could

not be ruled out.

28. Given, that the entire case based | upon
circumstantial evidence and certainly conviction can be
maintained on such evidence provided the same is trustworthy
and confidence-inspiring and forms an unbroken chain starting
from the body of the deceased and stopping on the neck of the
accused which excludes all hypothesis of his innocence. The
narrations given by the star witnesses of the prosecution, even
if true, at their best, raise suspicion as to the involvement of
the appellant in the commission of the crime as the same do

’

not provide the required link which could form an unbroken
-27-

chain and connect him therewith. Once the chain is broken and
the circumstances on the record are rendered capable of
explanation on other reasonable hypothesis, it cannot be said
that the case against the appellant is proved beyond any
shadow of doubt, because suspicion, however, strong it may
be, cannot take the place of truth. It is settled principle of
criminal jurisprudence that circumstantial evidence can only
form basis for conviction when it is incompatible with the
innocence of the accused and is incapable of explanation on
all other reasonable hypotheses than that of the guilt of the
accused. Even otherwise, where the case is resting on the basis
of circumstantial evidence, no chain in the link should be
missing and that all the circumstances must lead to the guilt of
the accused, therefore, the prosecution has miserably failed to

prove such links.

29. The learned Trial Court while awarding
conviction and sentences to the appellant had merely acted on
presumptions and probabilities. No one can be convicted on
presumptions how strong it may be or probabilities how high
it may be as the same could not be the substitute of real
evidence. The finding as regards the guilt of an accused should
be rested surely and firmly on the evidence produced in the
case and the plain inferences of guilt that may irresistibly be
drawn from that evidence rather than mere conjectures and

probabilities cannot take the place of proof. When seen in this
-28-

backdrop, we come to the safe conclusion that the prosecution
did not prove its case beyond any shadow of doubt and, any
doubt, if arising in links of the chain of prosecution story, the
benefit of same would go to accused as such type of evidence
does not justify the conviction and sentence of the appellant
for the safe administration of criminal justice. It is not
necessary that there should be many circumstances creating
doubt. If there is a circumstance, which creates reasonable
doubt in the prudent mind about the guilt of accused, then
accused will be entitled to the benefit not as a matter of grace
and concession but as a matter of right and even a single
doubt, if found reasonable, is sufficient to warrant the acquittal
of the accused. In this view of the matter, we do not think, the
case against the appellant has been proved in accordance with
the requirements of law, therefore, it will not be in accord with
safe administration of justice to maintain conviction of the
appellant as the prosecution could not prove the case against
him beyond reasonable doubt. It is settled that presumption
and probabilities howsoever strong may be, cannot be
considered as proof of a case. One of the most celebratory
principles of Islamic jurisprudence is that it's better to acquit
ten guilty persons than to convict a single person. Ayub
Masih vs. State (PLD 2002 SC 1048). Conviction can only
be based upon unimpeachable evidence and certainty of guilt,

and any doubt arising in the prosecution case must be resolved
-29-

in favour of accused. Muhammad Hussain vs. State (2011
SCMR 1127.

30. For the reasons discussed above, this and the
connected Criminal Appeal bearing No.1128-P/2022 are
allowed, the conviction and sentences recorded by the learned
Trial Court vide the impugned judgments dated 31.10.2022
are set aside and the appellant namely, Junaid Ahmad, is
acquitted of the charges, levelled against him. He be set free
forthwith, if not required in any other criminal case. Murder
Reference No.25-P/2022, sent by the learned Trial Court in
terms of Section 374, CrPC for confirmation of death sentence

of the appellant, is thus, answered in “Negative”.

31. So far as the third Criminal Appeal No.1215-
P/2022, titled Faqir Hussain vs. Ameer Khan etc., against the
acquittal of accused-respondents namely, Ameer Khan is
concemed, it was the argument of the learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the father of the deceased ladies that
the acquitted accused-respondent has fully facilitated /
supported the appellant in the execution of this tragic incident
rather he was the person, who actually, responsible for the
entire tragedy and without his facilitation / connivance, the
appellant was not able to even think such like brutal act,
therefore, instead of acquittal, the acquitted accused-
respondent is deserved to be given full doze/punishment under

the relevant law. Such argument has not impressed us for the
-30-

reason that no doubt the acquitted accused-respondent is
charged to have aided and abetted the appellant in the
commission of the offence but simultaneously as discussed
above mere conversation between them is not sufficient
ground for awarding conviction in any manner. Such argument
holds no water and is thus overruled. Even otherwise, the case
of the prosecution is full of loopholes and contradictions and
as such it could not bring home charge against the accused-
respondent, therefore, the impugned findings of acquittal are
the result of proper appreciation and; appraisal of evidence
and; material available on record of the case, which do not
require any interference by this court in exercise of its appeal
jurisdiction in terms of section 417 CrPC, which can only be
exercised where such findings are arbitrary, fanciful and
resulted into grave miscarriage of justice, which is certainly

not the case here.

32. Quite apart from this, since the initial
presumption of innocence is strengthened on the acquittal of
an accused, this Court is always very slow in interfering
therewith, even if on reappraisal of evidence, a view advanced
by the learned counsel for the appellant, is equally possible. In
this background, we do not think that the judgment recording
acquittal can be held to be arbitrary or whimsical by any
attribute, so as to justify interference therewith. Needless to

say that even a single doubt if found reasonable is sufficient to
-31-

warrant acquittal of an accused. Accordingly, Criminal Appeal

No.1215-P/2022 being without merit is dismissed.

Before parting with the judgment, we have observed
with a great degree of concern that the performance of worthy
investigating agency in the instant case is very poor as the
hidden truth qua the murder of five innocent persons is still
un-surfaced and definitely its benefit goes to the actual culprit.
Due to such like inefficiencies of investigating officers, the
culprits alone get benefits in the shape of their acquittals. In
the case in hand as earlier discussed there were two strong
pieces of circumstantial evidence, however, their evidentiary
value and worth were destroyed by the investigating officers
as the same had not been secured in accordance with law. It is
settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that conviction
under capital charge can be recorded and maintained on the
basis of circumstantial evidence, however, the same must be
of a high degree excluding thereby any doubt in its
authenticity. Therefore, the worthy Deputy Inspector General
of Police (Investigation), Peshawar is directed to look into the
matter personally and take strict disciplinary action against the
delinquent investigating officers namely, M/s Munir Khan
Inspector (PW-4) and Shaukat Ullah SI (PW-9) by conducting
proper inquiry under intimation to the Additional Registrar
(Judicial) of this Court. We wonder as to why these

incompetent and inefficient police officials are being
-32-

permitted to investigate such like sensitive cases and that too
in a very negligent, casual and callous manner as highlighted
in the preceding paras, which indeed is a big question mark on
the performance of the entire investigating agency. As such,
the worthy Deputy Inspector General of Police (Investigation),
Peshawar is also directed to look into the affairs of the
investigating agency because such poor performance of the
police certainly increases the agonies of the general public. He
is simultaneously directed to arrange proper regular trainings
and refreshment courses with modern technology to all the
investigating officers and henceforth depute those officials in
the investigating wing, who are competent, honest, well-
educated, well-trained in the field and specially serious and
sincere to their work / job. Accordingly, a copy of this
judgment be endorsed to the worthy Inspector General of
Police, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for his information and

necessary action and circulation amongst the investigating

officers.
Above are the reasons for our short order of even
date.
