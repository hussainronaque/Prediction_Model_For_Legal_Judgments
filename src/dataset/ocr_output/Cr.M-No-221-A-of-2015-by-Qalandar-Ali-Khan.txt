rescue Shoukat, accused / petitioner Raja Sher

petitioner Safeer Ahmad caught hold of him
and accused / petitioner Khan Afsar hit him
with axe on his head, forehead and nose and
Raja Sher Afzal also caused him injury on right
side of his chest with ‘churr’’. The report about

altercation on prevention of injured Shoukat
from using the path, and Shafagat son of

three wounds of Banaras complainant were
described by the medical officer as follows:

1. Mild laceration on the scalp.
2. Bruise over the nose.
3. A bruise over the right lower chest.

However, neither nature of injuries, whether
the injuries were simple or grievous, nor the
weapon used in the commission of offence have
been recorded in the medical report of the
complainant.
‘3. All the four accused have since been
arrested in the case, and out of four accused

charged in the case, accused/petitioners Mir

Afzal, Khan Afsar and Raja Sher Afzal have
recorded their confessional statements; and the
‘churr? mentioned as the weapon of offence has
been recovered on the pointation of accused/
petitioner, Mir Afzal from his house, while still
having stains of blood. Likewise, the axe used
by accused / petitioner Khan Afsar during the

allegedly used by accused / petitioner Raja
Sher Afzal has been recovered from his house
on his pointation. The two reports of Forensic
Science Laboratory with regard to blood
stained earth, blood stained garments of the
deceased and injured and both blood stained
‘Churris’ recovered on the pointation of above-
referred accused /petitioners have been
received in the affirmative. It may be mentioned
here that the accused /petitioner Mir Afzal also
odged a report to the police at 00.15 hours on
22.09.2014, which was recorded in the Daily Diary
of the Police Station at Serial No.23, whercin he
charged Sajid Deceased, Banaras complainant,
Shafagat and Shoukat for causing him and his sons
Khan Afsar and Sher Afzal injuries with stick
and axe blows. However, neither medical
reports of the said accused / petitioners are
available on the record nor a separate FIR has
been registered on the report of the

accused/petitioner, Mir Afzal. Anyhow,
as stated above, complete challan against the
accused / petitioners and supplementary
challan against accused / petitioner Safeer
Ahmad have been submitted, whereupon, trial
against all the four accused / petitioners has
also commenced with framing of charge against
all the accused charged in the case.

4. | Arguments of Mr. Shad Muhammad Khan,
Advocate, for the accused/petitioner, Raja
Zubair, Assistant Advocate General for the State
and Mr. Ghulam Mustafa Khan Swati, Advocate,
for the complainant/respondent No.2 heard,
and record perused.

5. It may be pointed out at the outset that
the accused / petitioners have been assigned
distinct roles in the FIR lodged by the injured
complainant within one hour of the occurrence.
One of the injured, namely, Sajid, who received
stab wounds on abdomen and chest succumbed
to his injuries. The role of causing him stab

FIR to accused / petitioner Raja Sher Afzal, who
recorded confessional statement before the
Magistrate, wherein he confessed causing stab
wounds to deceased Sajid with ‘Churri’. The
presence of the accused / petitioner Raja Sher
Afzal on the spot has also been admitted in the
report of accused / petitioner Mir Afzal, as Raja
Sher Afzal also, allegedly, sustained injuries as a
result of stick and axe blows by Shafagat.
Besides, the ‘churri’ used as the weapon of
offence, has also been shown to have been
recovered from his house on his pointation,
which was found stained with blood by the
chemical examiner in the FSL. The above stated
evidence collected by the investigating agency,
during investigation, prima facie, connect the
accused / petitioner, Sher Afzal, with the
commission of the offence. Therefore, the joint
petition for bail is dismissed to the extent of his

plea for release on bail.

6. Likewise, the accused / petitioner, Mir
Afzal, has been attributed role of causing stab
wound to injured Shoukat, who sustained
serious / grievous deep stab wound over the
abdomen. This accused / petitioner has also
recorded confessional statement before the
Magistrate, therein, confessing causing stab
wound to injured Shoukat with ‘churr’’, which
was also recovered from his house on_ his
pointation. His presence on the spot and
participation in the commission of the offence
is established by his own report recorded at
serial No.23 of the Daily Diary of the Police
Station dated 22.09.2014. This accused /
petitioner is charged for attempt at the life of
injured Shoukat by causing him serious /
grievous on the vital part of his body, therefore,
he is also not entitled to the concession of bail
like his son and co-accused Raja Sher Afzal,
who was charged for stab wound on the chest

and abdomen of Sajid,who Jater on succumbed

to the injuries, while injured Shoukat survived
stab wound on his abdomen. The grave charge
of causing serious / grievous injury on vital
part of inured Shoukat and thereby attempting
at his life, in view of the evidence made
available on the record, would disentitle him to
the concession of post arrest bail. Therefore,
the joint application to the extent of his plea for
bail is also dismissed.

7. The cases of the remaining two accused /
petitioners, namely, Khan Afsar and Safeer
Ahmad are quite distinguishable, as the latter is
only charged for catching hold of the
complainant, Banaras, and the former giving
him axe blows on his head, forehead and nose,
which have been described by the micdical
officer as mild laceration on the scalp, bruises
over the nose and right lower chest, without
either describing the nature of the injuries or
the nature of weapon used in the commission

of the offence. No doubt, accused / petitioner

Khan Afsar has also recorded confessional
statement but his confessional statement is
exculpatory in nature, wherein he has not
confessed his alleged act of causing axe blows
to complainant, Banaras. His role, in the
circumstances, would therefore be subject to
further inquiry, like his brother and co-accused,
Safeer, who is only charged for catching hold of
complainant, Banaras. Moreover, the School
Leaving Certificate of Safeer Ahmad would
show his date of birth as 20.02.1997, making
him entitled to the concession of post arrest
bail on that score as well. Consequently, on
the acceptance of application to the extent of
these two accused /petitioners, Khan Afsar and
Safeer Ahmad, they are admitted to bail subject
to their furnishing bail bonds in the sum of
Rs.100,000/-, each with two sureties in the like
amount to the satisfaction of Ilaqa / Duty

Judicial Magistrate, Mansehra.

&. Before parting with the order, it may be QD?
clarified that the observations recorded in this
order are based on tentative assessment of the
roles of each accused in the case, and should
have no bearing on merits of the case during
trial, which has already commenced with
framing of charge against all the accused /

petitioners.
