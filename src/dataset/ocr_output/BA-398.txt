the complainant and learned Astt: Advocate
General for the State, record with their

assistance gone through. .

5. Learned counsel for the Petitioner

placed reliance on 2017 P Cr.LJ 770 (Sindh) “
Masood Ahmed and another vs State through
Director_General_NAB, 2017 P Cr.LJ 397
(Peshawar) “ Mohsin Ihsan _vs_ the State”,
2000 P Cr.LJ 161 (Karachi) “ Hussain Haqani
vs_the State”, 2013 P Cr.LJ 318 (Sindh) “
Muhammad Boota vs the State” and 2016 YLR

prayed for the grant of bail. On the other hand,
learned counsel for the complainant assisted by

(Sindh) “ Joseph Sardar vs the State”, 2009 P

Cr.LJ 154 (Peshawar) “Azizullah vs the State”
and 2014 P Cr.LJ 494 (Peshawar) “ Shah Zaib

ys the State”. Thereby vehemently opposed the

grant of bail in favour of the accused/Petitioner.

6. According to the recovery memo
dated 03.07.2017 after the accused/Petitioner
Salah-ud-Din was taken into custody an amount
of Rs. 100,000/- each currency of notes of 5000
in denomination 20 in numbers drawn through
ATM card of the Muslim Commercial Bank in
the name of the Muhammad Idress were
recovered, Another ATM card is of the United
Bank Limited and the 3“ one is of Habib Bank
Limited. Certain cheques were also recovered

from possession of the accused/Petitioner.

7. Whether in view of the application
addressed to the DSP Circle Kabal District Swat
on 20.06.2017 and in the light of an affidavit
given by the Manager accused/Petitioner Salah-
ud-Din admitting Rs. 38 lacs to have been
-
embezzled by him this recovery would include
an amount under embezzlement. The learned

counsel for the complainant was unable to

clarify in this behalf, rather the learned A.A.G

Nawab
for the State frankly admitted that certainly an
affidavit being furnished on 19.08.2017 the
report made on 20.06.2017 even the recovery
has been effected when has been drawn on
20.06.2017 through ATM, this amount cannot
be included in the embezzled amount, which
bring this case under the scope of further
inquiry.
8. On the basis of levied section 409
PPC, which carries punishment falls within the
prohibitory clause of section 497 (1) Cr.P.C.
The relevant section 409 PPC is reproduced as
under:-
409, Criminal_ breach of trust by
public servant or by banker, merchant
or_agent. Whoever, being in any
manner entrusted with property, or

with any dominion over property in

his capacity of a public servant or in

i, the way of his business as a banker,
! “-

Nawab

merchant, factor, broker, attorney or
agent, commits criminal breach of
trust in respect of that property, shall
be punished with imprisonment for
life or with imprisonment of either

description for a term which may
thot

Nawab

extend to then years, and shall also be
liable to fine.”

It pertains to the involvement of an
accused under embezzlement, while an accused
admitting criminal breach of trust is a public
servant or a banker, merchant or agent. Prior to

section 408 PPC is referred here, which is also
reproduced:-

“408. Criminal breach of trust by

clerk_or_ servant. Whoever, being a
clerk or servant or employed as clerk
or servant, and being in any manner
entrusted in such capacity with
property, or with any dominion over
property, commits criminal breach of
trust in respect of that property, shall
be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which
may extend to seven years, and shall
be liable to fine.”

Here criminal breach of trust is
when committed by clerk or servant. Indeed the
relationship between the Manager Salah-ud-Din
accused/Petitioner and Muhammad §Idress
owner of the petrol pump known as Dada Khan
Filling Station Bara Bandai is that of master and

servant. The position of the accused/Petitioner
~——

Nawab

is not better than clerk or servant, who might
have been entrusted the property in such
capacity. This section i.e. 408 PPC invites
maximum punishment which may extend to 7
years and shall also be liable to fine. In
comparison of the above sections of law, most
appropriate is to levy section 408 of the
Pakistan Penal Code, which is applicable in the

given circumstances of this case.

9. In view of the above, the Petitioner
is entitled to the concession of bail. Hence, he is
asked to furnish bail bonds in the sum of
Rs. 10,00,000/- (Rupees ten lacs) with two
sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of learned Trial Court, who shall
ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and
men of means. The sureties shall also furnish
affidavits separately that in the event the
accused/Petitioner does not appear before the
Court for any reason each surety shall have no
objection in forfeiture of the bond to the tune of

surety amount under the bail bond.
