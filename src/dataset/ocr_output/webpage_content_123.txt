Abdul
Maalik Gaddi, J:  Through this application,
the applicant seeks his release on bail in FIR No.8/2014, registered at P.S.
Khokhrapar, Karachi East, under Section 23(i) A, Arms Ordinance, lodged on
16.01.2014 by complainant SIP Ghulam Akbar on behalf of State.
2.         Briefly, the
allegation against the applicant/accused is that he was found in his possession
one unlicensed Revolver of 32 bore with 04 rounds without number, hence this
FIR. 
3.         The post arrest bail application
of the applicant was rejected by the learned 1st Additional Sessions
Judge, Karachi East, vide her order dated 28.01.2014, hence, this bail
application. 
 
4.         I have heard the learned counsel
for the applicant, learned Addl.P.G and have gone through the case so available
before me.
 
5.         Learned counsel for the applicant
has argued that the applicant/accused is innocent and has been falsely
implicated in this case. Nothing was recovered from the possession of the
applicant/accused and the alleged recovery is foisted upon him. The applicant/accused
was arrested from his house. All the witnesses are the police officials and no
private witness of recovery was associated by the police though the place of arrest
and recovery is a thickly populated area, hence there is clear violation of
Section 103 Cr.P.C. He has further argued that the challan against the
applicant/accused has already been submitted before the trail Court and the
applicant/accused is no more required for investigation, hence according to him
the case of the applicant/accused is required further inquiry.
6.         On the other hand, learned Addl. P.G
opposed the grant of bail application on the ground that the applicant/accused
was arrested on 16.01.2014 and recovered weapon was promptly sent for FSL for
opinion. The FSL report dated 17.01.2014 is available on the record. He has
further argued that punishment of Section 23-A of the Sindh Arms Act, 2013
falls within the prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C, which shall be
punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 14 years and with
fine. As per Section 34 (a) of the Sindh Arms Act, 2013, Section 103 Cr.P.C is
not applicable. The said act has been notified vide order dated 22.05.2013. In
support of his argument, he has relied upon the case law reported in Riaz Shah
and another v. The State (1990 MLD 204).
 
7.         After hearing the learned counsel
for the parties and after perusing the record, it appears that the whole case
of the prosecution rest upon the evidence of two police officials. No doubt,
the police officials are good witnesses as others and their evidence cannot be
discarded on the sole ground that they are employees of the Police Department.
However, if the entire prosecution case depends upon the sole evidence of
police officials then their evidence must require deep and conscious
consideration and scrutiny as sometimes the police officials became witness
deeming it to be their official duty. Furthermore, the case has been challaned.
This applicant/accused is no more required for investigation. All witnesses are
police officials, therefore, there is no probability of tempering with the
prosecution evidence if the applicant is released on bail. There is also
nothing on record to show that the applicant/accused is a previous convict or
has been arrested in a case of similar nature in past. The learned Addl. P.G
has argued that the punishment of the offence under which the present
applicant/accused is challaned is upto 14 years. Reverting to the contention as
raised by the learned Addl. P.G, it is suffice to say that this is no ground to
retain the applicant/accused behind the bar and the bail cannot be declined as
punishment.
 
8.         As I have observed above, that the
challan against the applicant/accused has already been submitted before the
trial Court and this applicant/accused is no more required for investigation.
I, therefore, under the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case, admit
the applicant/accused to bail subject to his furnishing surety in the sum of
Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand) and P.R. Bond in the like amount to the
satisfaction of the trial Court. The case law cited by the learned Addl.P.G has
been perused and considered by me but did not find applicable to the facts of
the present case, hence the same is not helpful for him.
