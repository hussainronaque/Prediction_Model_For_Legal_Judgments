JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.- This

appeal has been filed by appellant Majid Sarwar

from Jail, against the judgment dated

24.03.2011, rendered by learned Judge Special

Court (CNS) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar,

whereby he has been convicted and sentenced

under section 9 (c ) Control of Narcotic

Substances Act, 1997, to undergo life

imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.1,00,000/-

or in default thereof to undergo 01 years S.I.

further.

2. On receipt of information qua

trafficking of huge quantity of narcotics by one

Majid Sarwar, from Peshawar to Punjab via

Peshawar Motorway, through vehicle

IDM-2722, Mumtaz Hussain SI (PW.3)

alongwith other ANF officials, on 02.01.2010

conducted a barricade near Toll Plaza Motorway

Peshawar. At 09.15 hours, the aforesaid

motorcar came from Peshawar side which was

intercepted, its driver was apprehended, who on

query, disclosed his name as Majid Sarwar

(appellant-convict herein). On cursory

interrogation, he disclosed about concealment of

narcotics in secret cavities of the vehicle. On his

pointation 30 packets chars Gardha, each

weighing one Kilogram, making

the total of 30 Kilograms, 69 packets Chars

Pukhta, each weighing one Kilogram, making

the total of 69 Kilograms and one packet opium

weighing 750 grams, were recovered from secret

cavities of the motorcar. From each packet of

the recovered chars and opium, 10/10 grams

were separated as samples for the purpose of

chemical analysis by the FSL and sealed in

separate parcels. The remaining quantity was

sealed separately. On personal search of the

accused, Mumtaz Hussain SJ. (PW.3),

recovered Nokia mobile set, registration book in

the name of one Liaqat Ahmad Khan, Rs.2000/-,

his CNIC, service card of Kohi Noor Mill,

DEAWOO ticket. He took into possession the

above mentioned articles alongwith narcotics

and vehicle vide recovery memo Exh.PW.3/1 in

presence of witnesses, drafted murasila

Exh.PW.3/2 and sent the same to Police Station

for registration of the case, consequent

whereupon FIR No.1 dated 02.01.2010 under

section 9 CNS, Act, 1997, was registered against

the appellant in Police Station Anti Narcotics

Force, Peshawar. He recorded statements of the

PWs and handed over the case property to

Moharrir of Police Station for safe custody and

sending the samples to the FSL. He sent the

registration of the motorcar to MRA concerned

for verification, but did not receive any report

from MRA. He through a written request sought

verification of service of the appellant from

Managing Director Kohi Noor Textile Mills

Private Ltd, but with no response. He placed on

file report of the FSL qua the samples

Exh.PW.3/11. He exhibited the motorcar

alongwith its key as Exh.PA, two bags

containing charas gardha Exh.P.1 and P.2, three

bags containing charas Pukhta as Exh.P.3 to P.5

and opium Exh.P.6, mobile phone of the accused

Exh.P.7, registration book of the vehicle as

Exh.P.8, Rs.2000/- Exh.P.9, CNIC Exh.P.10,

tick of DAEWOO as Exh.P.12.

3. On completion of investigation

challan was submitted against the appellant

before the learned trial Court, where he was

formally charge sheeted, to which he pleaded

not guilty and claimed trial. To prove its case

prosecution examined as many as five witnesses.

After closure of the prosecution evidence

statement of appellant Majid Sarwar was

recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C. wherein he

denied the prosecution allegations and professed

his innocence. He deposed that he was arrested

from DWAWOO bus stand while going to

Rawalpindi and implicated in the instant false

case. He, however, declined to be examined on

oath as his own witness under section 340 (2)

Cr.P.C. or to produce evidence in defence. On

conclusion of trial, learned Trial Court, after

hearing both the sides, convicted and sentenced

the appellant, as mentioned above, hence, this

appeal.

4. Learned counsel for the appellant

argued that prosecution case is a cook and bull

story; that in fact, appellant had been arrested

from DEAWOO Bus stand by the ANF officials

and was made a scapegoat in the instant case by

letting off the real culprit; that recovery of

DEAWOO ticket from possession of the

appellant is sufficient proof to substantiate his

stance; that the case property produced before

the court and exhibited does not corroborate the

quantity allegedly recovered from the vehicle of

the appellant, which squarely shatters the whole

structure of the prosecution case; that

prosecution has miserably failed to prove the

alleged recovery of narcotics through cogent and

confidence inspiring evidence beyond

reasonable doubt, therefore, the learned Trial

Court has erred in law while recording

conviction of the appellant on the basis of shaky

and scanty evidence, hence, impugned judgment

is liable to be reversed.

5. Conversely, learned SSP for ANF

contended that appellant has been arrested red

handed and huge quantity of narcotics has been

recovered from secret cavities of his motorcar

which was in his exclusive possession and

control; that the recovery has been proved by the

prosecution through cogent and confidence

inspiring evidence supported by positive FSL

report; that PWs having no ill or enmity with the

appellant, their testimony cannot be discarded

on mere ground that they belong to ANF force;

that mere variation in the quantity of narcotics

recovered and produced before the court, would

not damage the prosecution case as it might have

misplaced in Malkhana. He contended that

plantation of such huge quantity of narcotics in

absence of any serious enmity of the ANF

officials, does not appeal to a prudent mind,

therefore, the appellant cannot be straightaway

acquitted on the sole ground of variation in the

quantity of narcotics and at the most he can be

held guilty for the quantity produced and

exhibited before the court which also exceeds 10

Kilograms, therefore, punishment awarded by

the learned Trial Court, in such eventualities,

would be sufficient to meet the ends of justice.

He sought dismissal of the appeal.

6. We have considered the respective

submissions advanced from both the sides and

perused the record carefully.

7. It appears from the record that 30

packets chars Garhda, each weighing 01

Kilogram, total 30 Kilogram, 69 packets chars

Pukhta each weighing 01 Kilogram, total 69

Kilograms and one packet opium weighing 750

grams, have been shown allegedly recovered on

the pointation of the appellant from secret

cavities of motorcar bearing registration

No.IDM-2722. In support of proof of the

aforesaid recovery, Mumtaz Hussain, the

Seizing Officer appeared as PW.3 and Murtaza

Khan ASI, who stood as marginal witness to the

recovery memo Exh.PW.3/1, vide which the

10

alleged recovered narcotics had been taken into

possession in his presence by the Seizing

Officer, appeared as PW.4. A look over their

testimony reveals that they are consistent with

each other on the quantity of the recovered

narcotics as alleged in initial report. They

reiterated the numbers of packets of chars

Gardha to be 30, Charas Pukhta to be 69 and

opium to be one. During cross-examination of

PW Murtaz Khan ASI, on the request of learned

defence counsel, the case property was desealed,

and on examination, the learned Trial Court

found “Charas Pukhta in 23 packets instead of

69 packets and charas Gardha in 15 packets,

instead of 30 packets”. The learned Trial Court

did not find any monogram of any seal or FIR

number on any. packet. This _ glaring

contradiction which totally denies the quantity

11

of narcotics allegedly recovered from the

motorcar of the appellant, goes to the very roots

of the prosecution case, casting serious doubts

about the credibility and truthfulness of the

prosecution witnesses. No justification, much

less plausible, has been furnished by the

prosecution to convince our mind about the

above glaring contradiction in the quantity of the

narcotics, which does not tally with the one

allegedly recovered from the motorcar of the

appellant on his pointation. We, therefore, hold

that this aspect of the case if cannot be entirely

thrown out, surely cannot also be relied upon for

the purpose of recording conviction in light of

the principle of “Harder the sentence, stricter

the standard of proof.” The above aspect of the

case depicts that either the appellant has been

implicated in a false case or that the PWs have

12

purposely furnished false statements concealing

material facts, but it has direct bearing on the

fate of the case. The learned Trial Court while

recording the evidence, was very much in the

know of this disturbing aspect of the prosecution

case, but was probably influenced by the huge

quantity involved in the case and thus extended

every possible benefit to the prosecution rather

than to the defence, which is against the golden

principle of appreciation of evidence, according

to which benefit of any circumstance creating

doubt, shall be extended to the accused and not

the prosecution. The rule of benefit of doubt is

essentially a rule of prudence, which cannot be

ignored while dispensing justice in accordance

with law. In such like case, for the safe

administration of justice, it is not the quantity of

contraband, but the quality of evidence produced

13

in the court, to be considered for reaching a

correct and just decision of the case. Conviction

must be based on unimpeachable evidence and

certainty of guilt and any doubt arising in the

prosecution case, must be resolved in favour of

the accused. The said rule is based on the maxim

“it is better that ten guilty persons be acquitted

rather than one innocent person be convicted”

which occupied a pivotal place in the Islamic

Law and is enforced strictly in view of the

saying of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) that the

“mistake of Qazi (Judge) in releasing a criminal

is better than his mistake in punishing an

innocent”. Wisdom in this regard can also be

derived from the judgments of the apex court in

case titled, *Muhammad Khan and another Vs the

State” (1999 SCMR 1220) and case titled,

“Muhammad Ikram Vs the State” (2009 SCMR 230).

8. For what has been discussed above, we

are firm in our view that the prosecution has

miserably failed to bring home the guilt of the

appellant through cogent and _ confidence

inspiring evidence. Accordingly, we by allowing

this appeal and extending benefit of doubt to the

appellant, set aside his conviction and sentence

recorded by the learned Trial Court vide

impugned judgment dated 24.03.2011, and

hereby acquit him of the charge. He be set at

liberty forthwith, if not required in any other

case.

9. The Additional Registrar (Judicial)

of this Court is directed to send copy of this

judgment to the Director-General Anti Narcotics

Force, for looking into the matter and taking

action under the law against the delinquent

officials, who tampered with the case property

15

and played an important role in acquittal of the

accused, in an offence heinous in nature,

affecting the entire society, particularly the

youth, who are the future nation builders.
